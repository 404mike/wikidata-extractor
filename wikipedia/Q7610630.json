Hence, the Catholic Church does not regard itself as a party or strand within the universal church \u2013 but rather identifies itself as the universal church. Moreover, Sykes criticises the proposition, implicit in theories of via media, that there is no distinctive body of Anglican doctrines, other than those of the universal church; accusing this of being an excuse not to undertake systematic doctrine at all."]}, {"page": "August 1", "response": ["*  1939   \u2013 Stephen Sykes, English bishop and theologian (d. 2014)"]}, {"page": "St John's College, Durham", "response": ["* 1999\u20132006 Stephen Sykes"]}, {"page": "Regius Professor of Divinity", "response": ["* Stephen Sykes (1985)"]}, {"page": "Monkton Combe School", "response": ["* The Right Revd Stephen Sykes, 1939\u20132014, Regius Professor of Divinity at the University of Cambridge and Bishop of Ely"]}, {"page": "Ripon College Cuddesdon", "response": ["*Stephen Sykes \u2013 Bishop of Ely (1990\u20132000)"]}, {"page": "Anglican sacraments", "response": ["* Stephen Sykes and John Booty (eds.), The Study of Anglicanism.

Where the role of an assistant bishop is a legal part of the structure of the diocese, he or she is known as a suffragan bishop. Suffragans usually have a title named after a place within the diocese. For example, the Bishop of Jarrow is a suffragan to the Bishop of Durham. Some dioceses divide into episcopal areas, with each assigned to a suffragan area bishop. For example, the Bishop of Toronto has suffragans assisting him by providing certain delegated duties in four different geographical divisions. Sometimes a diocese may appoint a bishop as coadjutor bishop, an assistant bishop who will become diocesan bishop on the retirement of the current diocesan. This arrangement allows for greater continuity of episcopal ministry but is not very common in the Anglican Communion. Where a diocesan has not been elected or appointed, a bishop or senior priest may act as vicar general through the vacancy. Retired bishops or bishops who are pursuing ministry outside the usual episcopal ministry are usually licensed as honorary assistant bishops within a diocese (Stephen Sykes, the former Bishop of Ely who was Principal of St John's College, Durham, was also an honorary assistant bishop in Durham)."]}]}}
