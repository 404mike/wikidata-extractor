The Valley Parade pitch was very muddy; Potts wore Wellington boots to inspect the field before the game. As a result of the state of the pitch, Burnley were hindered in their passing game, and City took a 2\u20130 lead through Bobby Webb and Derek Stokes. With ten minutes remaining, Connelly dribbled through the Bradford defense and put the ball past their goalkeeper. He scored his second goal in injury time to salvage a replay for Burnley, following a scramble in City's penalty area. The second clash between the clubs took place three days later at Turf Moor, in front of an official attendance of 52,850; some of the gates were broken down, however, and many uncounted fans poured into the ground. Due to the traffic, the road from Bradford over the Moss at Colne was closed; the Bradford City supporters and numerous Burnley fans were excluded by the local police, while Connelly had to abandon his car and run to the ground. On an icey Turf Moor pitch, Burnley ran out 5\u20130 winners to advance to the sixth round, with Pointer and Robson both scoring braces and Connelly adding a further goal.Quelch (2015), pp. 155\u2013160"]}]}}
