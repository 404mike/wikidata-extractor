He was educated at Tavistock Grammar School and Exeter University and became a teacher. In the 1930s, he attended Balliol College, Oxford and read politics, philosophy and economics, returning to teaching until he entered the Royal Navy in 1942.During the Second World War he served mainly in the Mediterranean as an interpreter with the French forces. On leaving the Navy in 1946 he took up an appointment as lecturer in history at the University of Hong Kong where he remained until his retirement in 1962. As a historian and author he wrote a number of books including A History of Hong Kong, Fragrant Harbour (with A Hinton) and Government and the People. The manuscript of his last book, Hong Kong Eclipse, was almost finished at the time of his death. It was completed, at the request of the Hong Kong government, by Alan Birch, a senior member of the History Department at the University of Hong Kong who Endacott had asked to read the manuscript.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Endacott", "response": ["*George Beer Endacott (1901\u20131971), British historian."]}, {"page": "William Tarrant", "response": ["Excluded from the colonial administration, Tarrant decided to embark on a new career as a journalist, and in 1850 purchased The Friend of China, an influential Hong Kong newspaper, becoming its editor and publisher.

The historian George Beer Endacott argued that the poisoning was carried out on the instruction of Qing officials, while Jan Morris depicts Cheong as a lone wolf acting out of personal patriotism. Cheong's own clan record, written in China in 1904 at the command of the imperial court, states that the incident was entirely accidental, the result of negligence in preparing the bread rather than intentional poisoning. Yet another account says that the poisoning was carried out by two foremen at the bakery who fled Hong Kong immediately afterwards, and Cheong was uninvolved.. Lowe and McLaughlin, in their 2015 investigation of the incident, classify the plausible hypotheses into three categories: that the poisoning was carried out by Cheong or an employee on orders from Chinese officials; that the poisoning was an attempt by a rival to frame Cheong; and that the poisoning was accidental.."]}, {"page": "George Endacott", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Beer Endacott"]}]}}
