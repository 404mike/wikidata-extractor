Born in Glasgow, he climbed extensively in the Scottish mountains, where he pioneered new techniques of ice climbing.For several years, he worked for the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) of the British Antarctic Territory (BAT). On 23 November 1964, he became the first to climb Antarctica's Mount Jackson. In 1960\u201361, he was a member of the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey, serving as Station Commander at Stonington Island in 1962\u201363.

It is located in Palmer Land, within the Antarctic claims of Argentina, Chile and the United Kingdom. With an elevation of , Mount Jackson was once thought to be the highest mountain in the Antarctic Peninsula and the British Antarctic Territory, before the true height of Mount Hope (Eternity Range) was measured. Discovered by members of the United States Antarctic Service, 1939\u201341, it was named for Andrew Jackson, the seventh President of the United States. The first ascent of Mount Jackson was made by a team led by John Crabbe Cunningham of the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) in 1964. Mount Jackson's geology was studied in 1972 as part of the Palmer Island investigations by a team of geologists."]}, {"page": "Hamish MacInnes", "response": ["MacInnes was exposed to mountaineering at a very early age and by the age of 16, he had already climbed the Matterhorn. He had also built a motor car from scratch at the age of 17. In 1953, when he was 23, he made an attempt to scale Mount Everest, with his friend John Crabbe Cunningham and had almost made it before Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay scaled the mountain. He went on to complete the first winter ascent of Crowberry Ridge Direct and of Raven's Gully on Buachaille Etive M\u00f2r in the Scottish Highlands, with Chris Bonington in 1953. He was also a part of the group that scaled the Bonatti Pillar on the Aiguille du Dru, a mountain on the Mont Blanc massif of the French Alps. He performed this feat with a fractured skull, which he suffered after being hit by a rockfall."]}, {"page": "Mount Cunningham", "response": ["Mount Cunningham is a mountain at the west end of South Georgia's Esmark Glacier.
