The founders were Members of the European Parliament who had resigned from the UK Conservative Party in protest at its anti-euro stance. Their reported aim was to replace Eurosceptic William Hague as Conservative leader with Europhile Kenneth Clarke. Stevens later said that they had intended to push Ken Clarke, Michael Heseltine, Chris Patten and other pro-Europeans in the Conservative Party into \"an SDP-style breakaway, in combination with the Liberal Democrats\". The Pro-Euro Conservative Party disbanded in 2001.", "The Pro-Euro Conservative Party distributed leaflets calling William Hague \"Bill Duce\", after Mussolini, when a group of Conservative MEPs led by Daniel Hannan were reported to be planning to leave the European People's Party grouping and join with an Italian far-right party. John Stevens said Hague was \"taking the Tories into an extreme, nationalist party. This is dangerous for the country and catastrophic for the Conservative Party\". The PECP's party political broadcast showed an actor portraying Hague as \"a down-and-out in a baseball cap ranting about pride in being British and disliking 'frogs', the European single currency and anything else from the continent\", which was called \"a tacky and amateurish exercise\" by the Conservative Party.", "John Stevens received 3.8% of the vote as the PECP candidate in the 1999 Kensington & Chelsea by-election against Michael Portillo. The party announced that, owing to voter hostility to the words it contained, it planned to change its name after the by-election.", "The PECP disbanded in December 2001, expressing disappointment at failing to persuade pro-European \"grandees\" to leave the Conservative Party and cooperate with the Liberal Democrats. Leader John Stevens called the Conservative Party under their then newly elected leader Iain Duncan Smith \"a cancer of extremism and xenophobia\".
