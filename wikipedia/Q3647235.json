The same day the club confirmed that Racine and Ciss\u00e9's trials had been terminated, the club also revealed that previous shirt sponsors Jones Building Contractors had chosen not to take up the option to extend their deal and so the club were in negotiations with businesses to become the club's main sponsor for the 2012\u201313 season. Midfielder Dominic Blizzard missed the first six pre-season friendlies having suffered a broken hand in training. On 21 July, Yeovil faced League Two side Plymouth Argyle at the home of Dorchester Town The Avenue Stadium due to problems with the Huish Park pitch, Yeovil strolled to a 5\u20130 win with a hat-trick from Reuben Reid and goals from Hayter and Marsh-Brown.
