He served seven terms in the Victorian Legislative Assembly from 1885 before being defeated by F. J. Field in 1902. Joining with Labor, Outtrim successfully recontested Maryborough in 1904 and then served an additional seven terms to 1920 ending his political career as the father of the house.\nBefore the 1890s, there was no formal party system in Victoria. Party labels before that time indicate a general tendency only. From the 1880s, until after Federation in 1901, Victorian politics were dominated by Protectionist Liberals, who were opposed by Free Trade Conservatives. The Labor Party did not emerge as a major party until after 1910, which meant that Victoria was slow to develop a two-party system. Outtrim's political career reflects this strongly.\nOver the course of his 34-year parliamentary career, Outtrim changed parties several times: from 1885 to 1902 he served as a liberal and supported liberal and reform administrations. In 1902 he was defeated in Maryborough but returned representing Labor from 1904 to 1916. With the split in Labor over conscription Outtrim sided with Prime Minister Billy Hughes and became a Nationalist from 1916. Outtrim was now the father of the Victorian Assembly and in 1920 he was finally defeated by Labor's George Frost.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Victorian state by-elections", "response": ["|Alfred Outtrim", "|Alfred Outtrim", "|Alfred Outtrim", "|Alfred Outtrim", "|Alfred Outtrim", "|Alfred Outtrim", "|Alfred Outtrim"]}, {"page": "Candidates of the 1920 Victorian state election", "response": ["|Maryborough || Nationalist || |George Frost || Alfred Outtrim || Robert Laidlaw || "]}, {"page": "Candidates of the 1917 Victorian state election", "response": ["|Maryborough || Labor || Thomas Jude || || Robert Laidlaw || |Alfred Outtrim || || "]}, {"page": "Candidates of the 1914 Victorian state election", "response": ["|Maryborough || Labor || |Alfred Outtrim || James Holland ||"]}, {"page": "Candidates of the 1911 Victorian state election", "response": ["|Maryborough || Labor || |Alfred Outtrim || James Bennett ||"]}]}}
