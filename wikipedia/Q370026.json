All the jobs he embarked upon ended in disaster, sometimes with a burst of classic slapstick, sometimes with a bewildered Drake himself at the centre of incomprehensible actions by the people employing him. Bookending these sequences were the encounters between Drake and the labour exchange clerk. Running jokes included Drake's inability to manage the name of the clerk, with Mr Whittaker rendered as Mr Wicketer and then Mr Pugh variously mispronounced from a childish \"Mi'er Poo\" to \"Peeyooo\". Drake sang the theme song himself, using an old music hall number. The series was briefly revived by London Weekend Television in 1978 as a series of short sketches on Bruce Forsyth's Big Night, with Drake and McGee reprising their roles."]}, {"page": "1992 in film", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 6 || Percy Herbert || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 72 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| UK || style=\"text-align:center;\"| Actor || "]}, {"page": "1980 in film", "response": ["| The Sea Wolves || Paramount Pictures / Rank Film Distributors || Andrew V.
