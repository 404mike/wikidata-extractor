He had earlier represented his country at Junior level while with Lochee Harp.His spell at Hibs was a short end-of-season loan to aid the team in their fight against relegation in 1935\u201336, which was successful. He then signed for their Edinburgh derby rivals Hearts, where a first campaign establishing himself was followed by a goal in the first round of the 1937\u201338 season; he also scored in the club's next fixture against Hibs in the Wilson Cup, but then suffered a badly broken leg in the last minute of the match. Ferguson never played for Hearts again due to the injury, signing for Rochdale in 1939 after a short trial with Falkirk, but he only made one Football League appearance prior to the outbreak of World War II, with the matches played declared void.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alex Ferguson (disambiguation)", "response": ["Sir Alex Ferguson (born 1941) is a former Scottish football player and manager.", "Alex Ferguson or Alex Fergusson may also refer to:", "*Alex Ferguson (baseball) (1897\u20131976), American baseball player", "*Alex Ferguson (footballer, born 1903) (1903\u20131974), Scottish football player", "*Alex Ferguson (footballer, born 1913), Scottish footballer, played for Lochee Harp, St Johnstone, Hibernian, Heart of Midlothian and Rochdale.
