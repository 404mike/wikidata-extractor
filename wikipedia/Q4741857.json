Nearly eighty guns fired at the shore for a full hour. The Americans were half buried under dirt and sand, and were unable to return fire due to the smoke and dust. After the guns ceased, the British flatboats appeared out of the smoke and headed for shore. By then the Americans were in a panicked retreat, and the British began their amphibious landing."]}, {"page": "Legh Richmond", "response": ["In 1805 Richmond became assistant-chaplain to the Lock Hospital, London, for a short period.
