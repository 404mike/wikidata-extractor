She is the commissioning editor of Telos Publishing imprint Telos Moonrise. Stone's debut novel Gabriele Caccini (authored as Paigan Stone) won the silver award for best horror novel 2007 with ForeWord in the USA. She was shortlisted for the August Derleth Award for Best Novel in the British Fantasy Awards for her second novel, Futile Flame. This book was also a finalist in ForeWord's Book of the Year Awards in 2009 and the third book in the series, Demon Dance, was also a finalist for the 2010 Foreword magazine Awards and won the August Derleth Award for Best Novel in the British Fantasy Awards 2011. This made her the first female writer to win the Award since Tanith Lee did so in 1980. However, after the awards were announced, there was controversy over the voting and so Stone publicly returned the Award, not wishing to be associated with something which might have been awarded erroneously. The BFS then declared that the voting was valid, but then in a later statement announced that the Best Novel would be declared a 'No Award' for that year. Stone was not consulted in this decision. She also won the Best Short Story Award in the British Fantasy Awards in the same year.\nIn August 2012 Telos Publishing issued a press release announcing the forthcoming audio of Stone's horror collection \u2013 Zombies In New York. Telos also published her Steampunk/Horror Novella Zombies at Tiffany's.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of science-fiction authors", "response": ["*Sam Stone (fl. 2000s\u2013present)"]}, {"page": "Reeltime Pictures", "response": ["*White Witch of Devil's End (2017) \u2013 an independent drama starring Damaris Hayman as Olive Hawthorne, who made her original appearance in Doctor Who in the Jon Pertwee story The D\u00e6mons.
