Kent Opera gave its inaugural performances in 1969 with The Coronation of Poppea, sung in English at Canterbury and Tunbridge Wells with Adrian de Peyer, a high tenor, as Nero and Laura Sarti as Poppea. The edition chosen by the conductor, Roger Norrington, was that by Raymond Leppard, but in 1974, when the company was invited to Lisbon, Norrington, with the members of the Kent Opera continuo, produced a realisation closer to Monteverdi's manuscripts. Anne Pashley and Sandra Browne were now the lovers, Laura Sarti sang Ottavia and John Tomlinson Seneca. Later that year the production toured Kent and was seen at the City of London Festival: \"It comes closer to the heart of this blazing masterpiece than any other I have heard\", wrote the Sunday Telegraph. The following year, in a new translation by Platt, the opera was performed at the Proms, with Sarah Walker as Poppea. In 1986 Kent Opera toured a new production of Poppea with Patricia Rosario as Nero and Eirian James as Poppea, and Iv\u00e1n Fischer made his own new realisation of the score."]}, {"page": "Athletics at the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games", "response": ["|Anne PashleyHeather ArmitageShirley BurgessShirley Hampton||46.9"]}, {"page": "Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria discography", "response": ["|Neil Jenkins Sarah Walker Neil Mackie Anne Pashley Wynford Evans Jack Irons"]}, {"page": "List of operas performed at the Wexford Festival", "response": ["|1967 || Rom\u00e9o et Juliette ||  Gounod || French || 1867 ||  David Lloyd-Jones ||  John Cox ||  Patrick Murray ||  Richard Van Allan, Anne Pashley, Pamela Bowden, Henri Gui", "|1971 || Il re pastore ||  Mozart || Italian || 1775 ||  Kenneth Montgomery ||  John Cox ||  Elizabeth Dalton ||  Norma Burrowes, Anne Pashley"]}, {"page": "Bath Bach Choir", "response": ["|A Child of Our Time Soprano Anne Pashley, Contralto Pamela Bowden, Tenor Ronald Down, Bass Clifford Grant.", "|Nelson Mass (1965 Bath Festival).
