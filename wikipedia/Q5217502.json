His death brought general mourning in Britain and a monument to his memory was raised in St Paul's Cathedral.\nDuring his long career, Hoghton had fought on several West Indian islands, in India, Denmark, Portugal and Spain and had even spent a brief period standing in for a Royal Marines detachment in the Channel Fleet. A popular and able officer, Wellington was reported to have commented on his death: \"I understand that it was impossible for anybody to behave better than he did . . . he,actually fell waving his hat and cheering his brigade on to the charge\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Francis Leggatt Chantrey", "response": ["He executed four monuments to military heroes for St Pauls Cathedral: they commemorate Major-General Daniel Hoghton, Major-General Bowes, and Colonel Henry Cadogan, and (in a single monument) Major-Generals Gore and Skerrett.

Allied losses amounted to 5,916: 4,159 British, 389 Portuguese and 1,368 Spaniards.. In his despatch of 21 May 1811, Soult estimated British casualties as 5,000 with 800 to 1,000 captured; Spanish as 2,000 with 1,100 captured; Portuguese as 700 to 800.Gurwood, John, ed..The dispatches of Field Marshal the Duke of Wellington, Vol. V.

British historians dispute this, comparing Soult's figure of 241 officer casualties with regimental returns that total 362.. Sir Charles Oman extrapolated this figure to come up with the total number of French casualties, which he puts at approximately 7,900. In comparison, the French historians Jacques Vital Belmas and \u00c9douard Lap\u00e8ne place Soult's losses at 7,000..

He was to be noted for his caution in later actions. Colonel Baynes, to whom Prevost delegated command at Sackett's Harbor, had had little opportunity to lead troops in battle during his career. Yeo had a reputation as a fighting captain, gained by leading landing parties, but was new to the command and conditions on the lake, and cautiously kept most of his warships in deep water on 28 May. When he went ashore on 29 May to be close to the fighting, the larger British vessels were apparently left without orders and only Beresford attempted to intervene decisively."]}, {"page": "Castle Hedingham", "response": ["* Major-General Daniel Hoghton, British Army officer who served during the Napoleonic Wars with distinction."]}, {"page": "British Cemetery, Elvas", "response": ["The area containing the graves of Maj.

During the opening stages of the Battle of Albuera on 16 May 1811, Lumley replaced Robert Ballard Long in command the Allied cavalry by order of Sir William Beresford because of Long's alleged incompetence, though other reasons were given at the time. During the battle, Lumley's cavalry supported the Allied right after Daniel Hoghton's brigade was destroyed and then supported the flanks of Beresford's main assault in the final stages of the action. A few days later, Lumley was again engaged in a cavalry action at the Battle of Usagre, where two French cavalry regiments were neatly trapped and almost destroyed, but his health was failing and in August 1811 he was invalided home, never to see action again."]}, {"page": "William Inglis (British Army officer)", "response": ["Albuera would prove to be the event that ensured the memory of Inglis' name in history.

Fighting was fierce throughout the next two days, as the outnumbered French used the fortified high ground to hold back a series of frontal assaults. The British lost 84 killed and 334 wounded to French losses of over 700 casualties, and by 3 February the French had been forced back, withdrawing to Fort Desaix near the capital.James, p. 208 Progress was also made at Cape Salomon, where the appearance of British troops panicked the French defenders into burning the naval brig Carnation and retreating to the small island, Ilot aux Ramiers, offshore.
