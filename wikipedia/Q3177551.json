A few poets such as John Gower and John Milton were able to write poetry in more than one language. Some Portuguese poets, as Francisco de S\u00e1 de Miranda, wrote not only in Portuguese but also in Spanish. Jan Kochanowski wrote in Polish and in Latin, France Pre\u0161eren and Karel Hynek M\u00e1cha wrote some poems in German, although they were poets of Slovenian and Czech respectively. Adam Mickiewicz, the greatest poet of Polish language, wrote a Latin ode for emperor Napoleon III. Another example is Jerzy Pietrkiewicz, a Polish poet. When he moved to Great Britain, he ceased to write poetry in Polish, but started writing novel in English. He also translated poetry from English and into English."]}, {"page": "Jerzy Peterkiewicz", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jerzy Pietrkiewicz"]}]}}
