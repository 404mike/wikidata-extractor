One commission again proved fortunate, as it brought him back in touch with Coleridge and Wordsworth, both of whose portraits he painted, as well as one of Coleridge's son Hartley. Hazlitt aimed to create the best pictures he could, whether they flattered their subjects or not, and neither poet was satisfied with his result, though Wordsworth and their mutual friend Robert Southey considered his portrait of Coleridge a better likeness than one by the celebrated James Northcote.Wardle, pp. 76\u201377.", "Always fascinated by artists in their old age (see \"On the Old Age of Artists\"),Works, vol. 12, pp. 88\u201397. Hazlitt was especially interested in the painter James Northcote, student and later biographer of Sir Joshua Reynolds, and a Royal Academician. Hazlitt would frequently visit him\u2014by then about 80 years old\u2014and they conversed endlessly on men and manners, the illustrious figures of Northcote's younger days, particularly Reynolds, and the arts, particularly painting.", "Northcote was at this time a crochety, slovenly old man who lived in wretched surroundings and was known for his misanthropic personality. Hazlitt was oblivious to the surroundings and tolerated the grumpiness.Wardle, p. 434. Finding congeniality in Northcote's company, and feeling many of their views to be in alignment, he transcribed their conversations from memory and published them in a series of articles entitled \"Boswell Redivivus\" in The New Monthly Magazine. (They were later collected under the title Conversations of James Northcote, Esq., R.A.) But there was little in common between these articles and Boswell's life of Johnson. Hazlitt felt such a closeness to the old artist that in his conversations, Northcote was transformed into a kind of alter ego. Hazlitt made no secret of the fact that the words he ascribed to Northcote were not all Northcote's own but sometimes expressed the views of Hazlitt as much as Hazlitt's own words.As Hazlitt explained in an introductory note: \"I differ from my great and original predecessor ... James Boswell ... in ... that whereas he is supposed to have invented nothing, I have feigned whatever I pleased\". Works, vol. 11, p. 350. On the other hand, as Catherine Macdonald Maclean reminds us, \"there is much in the 'Conversations' which could only have come from Northcote, like the 'divine chit-chat' about Johnson and Burke and Goldsmith and Sir Joshua Reynolds, in which Hazlitt delighted\". Maclean, p. 551."]}, {"page": "John Mudge", "response": ["Mudge inherited a friendship with the family of Sir Joshua Reynolds, and when in 1762 Samuel Johnson accompanied Reynolds on his visit to Plymouth, Johnson became a friend and consulted Mudge as a physician.

Henry Fuseli long claimed that his planned Shakespeare ceiling (in imitation of the Sistine Chapel ceiling) had given Boydell the idea for the gallery.Friedman, 25. James Northcote claimed that his Death of Wat Tyler and Murder of the Princes in the Tower had motivated Boydell to start the project.Friedman 65. However, according to Winifred Friedman, who has researched the Boydell Gallery, it was probably Joshua Reynolds's Royal Academy lectures on the superiority of history painting that influenced Boydell the most.Friedman, 2.", "Boydell's relationships with his illustrators were generally congenial. One of them, James Northcote, praised Boydell's liberal payments. He wrote in an 1821 letter that Boydell \"did more for the advancement of the arts in England than the whole mass of the nobility put together!  He paid me more nobly than any other person has done; and his memory I shall ever hold in reverence\".Letter to Mrs. Carey, 3 October 1821, qtd. in Hartmann, 61. Boydell typically paid the painters between \u00a3105 to \u00a3210, and the engravers between \u00a3262 and \u00a3315.Burwick, \"Introduction\", 19. Joshua Reynolds at first declined Boydell's offer to work on the project, but he agreed when pressed.  Boydell offered Reynolds carte blanche for his paintings, giving him a down payment of \u00a3500, an extraordinary amount for an artist who had not even agreed to do a specific work.  Boydell eventually paid him a total of \u00a31,500.Bruntjen, 75.For present-day equivalent amounts, most payments should be increased by about two orders of magnitude. Giving precise present-day figures is difficult given the problem of measuring economic worth over time.", "The Shakespeare Gallery, when it opened on 4 May 1789, contained 34 paintings, and by the end of its run it had between 167 and 170.Friedman, 4, 83; Santaniello, 5.  (The exact inventory is uncertain and most of the paintings have disappeared; only around 40 paintings can be identified with any certainty.Santaniello, 5.) According to Frederick Burwick, during its sixteen-year operation, the Gallery reflected the transition from Neoclassicism to Romanticism.Burwick, \"Romantic Reception\", 150. Works by artists such as James Northcote represent the conservative, neoclassical elements of the gallery, while those of Henry Fuseli represent the newly emerging Romantic movement. William Hazlitt praised Northcote in an essay entitled \"On the Old Age of Artists\", writing \"I conceive any person would be more struck with Mr. Fuseli at first sight, but would wish to visit Mr. Northcote oftener.\"Qtd. in Burwick, \"Romantic Reception\", 150.", "| 1 || James Northcote || Richard II || 5.2 || Royal Albert Memorial Museum ||", "| 2 || James Northcote || Richard III || 4.3 || Collection of Richard Herner, National Trust ||", "| 10 || James Northcote || King John || 4.1 || Royal Shakespeare Company ||", "| 17 || James Northcote || Henry VI, Part 3 || 5.7 ||  ||", "| 76 || James Northcote || Henry VI, Part 1 || 2.5 || Northbrook Sale, Straton Park, 27 November 1929, no. 493 ||", "| 78 || James Northcote || Romeo and Juliet || 5.3 || Folger Shakespeare Library || 150px", "| 127 || James Northcote || Richard III || 3.1 ||  ||", "| 129 || James Northcote || Richard III || 4.3 || Petworth House ||", "| 159 || James Northcote || Henry VI, Part 3 || 1.3 ||  ||", "* King John, Act IV, scene 1 by Robert Thew after James Northcote", "* King Richard II, Act V, scene 2 by Robert Thew after James Northcote", "* Henry VI, part 1, Act II, scene 5 by Robert Thew after James Northcote", "* Henry VI, part 3, Act I, scene 3 by Charles Gauthier Playter and Thomas Ryder after James Northcote", "* Henry VI, part 3, Act V, scene 7 by Jean Baptiste Michel after James Northcote", "* Richard III, Act III, scene 1 by Robert Thew after James Northcote", "* Richard III, Act IV, scene 3 by Francis Legat after James Northcote \u2013 The Young Princes Murdered in the Tower", "* Richard III, Act IV, scene 3 by William Skelton after James Northcote \u2013 Burying of the Royal Children", "* Romeo and Juliet, Act V, scene 3 by Jean-Pierre Simon after James Northcote", "* Death of Mortimer (Act II, scene 5) by Andrew Gray after James Northcote", "* Meeting of the Young Princes (Act III, scene 1) by J.
