Annie frustrates George (Russell Tovey) because of her temperament and her tendency to constantly make tea she cannot drink, though Mitchell (Aidan Turner) is more sympathetic towards her. In the third episode, he introduces Annie to Gilbert (Alex Price), another ghost, who falls in love with her. When Owen arrives to clear a blocked pipe and produces a thong, Annie's memories of her death are triggered and shown in flashback. Owen had pushed her down the stairs after an argument; their relationship had been abusive, not the loving one she had imagined to be true. Memories of her death cause Annie to become a poltergeist able to move objects and turn machines on without touching them although she cannot control these abilities. To resolve her death Annie seeks a confession from Owen; he taunts her haunting effects as ineffectual and reveals that he was unfaithful throughout their relationship. Annie is inspired by her and George's rescue of Mitchell from a vampire coven and with their help stands up to Owen. After Owen has a mental breakdown and confesses, the Door to Death appears for Annie but she stays behind because her friends need her.

Whithouse chose the setting to be Venice, and vampires soon entered the plot as he felt they belonged in the setting. The episode was filmed in Trogir, Croatia in late 2009, with the old-fashioned village portraying Venice. The episode was seen by 7.68 million viewers in the UK and received an Appreciation Index of 86. The episode received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the comedy, production design, and acting of guests Helen McCrory and Alex Price, but thought that the plot elements were somewhat similar to a couple of other recent episodes.", "Several aspects of the episode had to be compromised due to budget constraints. The true form of the aliens could only be shown for a few seconds each as it was very expensive to do, and these shots were spread throughout the episode. In the original script a big monster rose out of the water in Isabella's death scene, but this would have been too expensive and Moffat was forced to ask Whithouse to make it \"invisible\". Many of the costumes in the episode were taken from artwork from the 15th and 16th centuries. This included veils that women wore, which were used for the vampire girls. Guido trades clothes with Rory when Rory must disguise himself as a Venetian to enter Amy into the school; this was an idea of Moffat's which Whithouse was against as he thought Guido was a \"tragic character\", but he eventually thought the sight of the character in Rory's stag party T-shirt was funny. McCrory's costume was designed to be similar to her alien creature to make the transition smooth. McCrory was coached to move like a fish, which she pursued diligently. Each pair of teeth for the vampires was unique and moulded to their mouths. They were hard to speak with and Alex Price's lines were re-voiced, though he commented he got \"quite good\" at speaking with them.", "The episode received mixed reviews. Daniel Martin, writing for The Guardian on guardian.co.uk, described it as \"beautifully shot\" and went on to write: \"the way every part of the vampire mythos was explained away by Who pseudo-science was delightful; the stand-off between the Doctor and Rosanna was beautifully played; the dialogue as cracking as you'd expect from Whithouse...and the climactic shot of the Doctor scaling the tower in the rain was just the correct level of broad brushstroke\". SFX reviewer David Bradley also reacted positively, giving the episode four out of five stars. He assessed it as \"better structured, funnier and more absorbing\" than the previous single episode \"Victory of the Daleks\" and praised the comedy and acting of Alex Price.
