It was re-issued in 1997 by React Music Limited in a new remixed version called the \"Now Voyager Mix\". This time the record reached number three, the song's highest position, and then was remixed again in 2006 with new mixes by the Shapeshifters amongst others. This time the rights to the record were picked up by EMI's Positiva label (also the label the Shapeshifters were signed to), who scored another top ten hit, when the track reached number seven.
