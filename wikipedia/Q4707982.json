On their way to promotion, the team won 8\u20132 away to Brighton & Hove Albion, managed by Brian Clough, the only 8\u20132 away win ever recorded in the third division.

Despite this he went on to appear over 200 times for the club, establishing himself as a fan favourite with the Bramall Lane crowd. He returned to his hometown club Cardiff City in September 1972 alongside teammate Dave Powell in an exchange deal for Alan Warboys. Appointed club captain, he went on to play in a variety of different roles for the club and in his first two seasons his goals helped the club win the Welsh Cup, scoring a hat-trick in the second leg of the 1973 final and once in the second leg of the 1974 final. The club suffered relegation during the 1974\u201375 season, with Reece finishing as the club's top scorer with 8 goals, but managed to win promotion on the first time of asking the following year.

However, he had to wait until February 1971 to make his debut for the club when he scored twice in consecutive substitute appearances against Oxford United and Sunderland and was handed his first start soon after. Despite being a prolific scorer in the reserve team, Parsons never managed to hold down a regular place in the first team due to the wealth of striking talent in the likes of Brian Clark, John Toshack and Alan Warboys and, in February 1973, left to join Bournemouth. His time at Bournemouth was severely hampered by injuries and he had made just 8 league appearances when he returned to Wales to sign for Newport County in March 1975. His spell at Newport was his most successful spell in The Football League, spending two seasons as a regular in the side before moving into non-league football."]}]}}
