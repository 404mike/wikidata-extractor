It was during this game that Holt got an insight into the dire state of Stanley, having discovered that the club's bar was unable to serve spectators as a result of its failure to pay its suppliers. In his first season as owner of the club, the 2015-16 Football League Two season, the club narrowly missed out on promotion to League One on the final day of the season, having been held to a 0-0 draw with Stevenage. Stanley were then defeated in the semi-final of the League Two play-offs, losing 3-2 on aggregate to AFC Wimbledon, with Wimbledon going on to defeat Plymouth Argyle 2-0 in the play-off final. At the end of the season, Stanley lost several of its players who had helped spur them on a promotion push, such as Tom Davies, Ross Etheridge and Josh Windass, who had agreed contracts with clubs in a position to offer higher wages than Stanley had been able to. With Windass and Crooks being under-24, Stanley received \u00a3120,000 for the duo's transfer to Rangers."]}, {"page": "Tony Pulis", "response": ["On 13 November 2020, Pulis returned to management after over a year out of football, joining Championship club Sheffield Wednesday, the second consecutive appointment for which he had replaced Garry Monk.

His first match in charge ended in a 1\u20130 defeat against Preston North End after Josh Windass was sent off, after 17 minutes. He got his first point the following game in another away game, a 1\u20131 draw against Swansea City, with Adam Reach getting the first goal of his reign. After the 2\u20130 defeat to Nottingham Forest, he broke the record for worst start for any manager at Sheffield Wednesday, getting 3 points from a possible 24. He won his first game as manager at the ninth time of asking against Coventry City in a 1\u20130 win, with Tom Lees getting the winning goal. On 28 December 2020, Pulis was sacked as Wednesday manager after having secured just one victory from ten league games. Sky Sports reported that major disagreements between Pulis and club owner Dejphon Chansiri over transfer plans for the upcoming January transfer window were the main cause of Pulis's dismissal.

Two weeks later, against the same opposition at Celtic Park, Halliday played the whole match at left back but was exposed several times due to his unfamiliarity with the position as Celtic won 5\u20130 to confirm the Scottish title.
