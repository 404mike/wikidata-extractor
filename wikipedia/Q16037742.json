Flinders Petrie.\nHis interest in Egyptology probably began in 1877, when the novelist Amelia B. Edwards published her best seller, \"A 1000 Miles Up the Nile\". Edwards was a long-time supporter of Petrie. Haworth and his wife read her book and they were soon following her journey up the Nile.\nHaworth was a partner in the Manchester firm of James Dilworth and Sons. As well as sponsoring Egyptology, he also collected paintings and Wedgwood ceramics.\nPetrie recalls in his autobiography \"While in England, I heard that the offer of help in excavating came from Jesse Haworth of Manchester, though the kind intervention of Miss Edwards. Just at the same time, I had an offer of assistance from Martyn Kennard who had a family interest in Egypt. Nevertheless, I did not wish to pledge my time to be entirely at the service of anyone. The plan, which worked very smoothly, was that I drew on my two friends for all the costs of workmen and transport, while I paid all my expenses. In return, we equally divided all that came to England. Thus it was in my interest to fund as much as I could.\"\nIn 1890 Haworth and Kennard presented their collection of objects from Kahun, and another Fayoum town site Gurob, to The Manchester Museum. In 1912 with the collection rapidly expanding, Haworth made a substantial contribution to the building fund to primarily house the Egyptian collections. In recognition of his generosity, and of his position as one of the first patrons of scientific excavation in Egypt, The University of Manchester conferred upon Jesse Haworth the honorary Degree of Doctor of Laws.\nIn 1919, Jesse Haworth donated a further \u00a310,000 to the museum, and under the terms of his Will, in 1921, he bequeathed a further \u00a330,000 along with his private collection of Egyptian Antiquities.\nIn 1920, Haworth approved plans for a third stage of the Museum building which would provide a further display area as well as much-needed workrooms and a storage space for the collection. His widow opened this extension in November 1927.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Manchester Museum", "response": ["Two subsequent extensions mirror the development of its collections. The 1912 pavilion was largely funded by Jesse Haworth, a textile merchant, to house the archaeological and Egyptological collections acquired through excavations he had supported. The 1927 extension was built to house the ethnographic collections. The Gothic Revival street frontage which continues to the Whitworth Hall has been ingeniously integrated by three generations of the Waterhouse family. When the adjacent University Dental Hospital of Manchester moved to a new site, its old building was used for teaching and subsequently occupied by the museum.", "The major collecting areas in archaeology have been Western Europe, the Mediterranean, Egypt and Western Asia. Large accessions of material from Egypt and Western Asia came from the excavations of Sir Flinders Petrie and subsequently archaeologists from the university have been involved in expeditions to Western Asia and brought more finds. The Egyptological collections include finds from Kahun and , presented in 1890 by Jesse Haworth and Martyn Kennard. By 1912 the growth of this area had been so great that a new wing was added for the Egyptian material to which Jesse Haworth made a major donation of funds. Its first keeper was Winifred M. Crompton."]}, {"page": "Winifred M. Crompton", "response": ["Crompton began her career at the Manchester Museum as its printer. In 1912, she became the first assistant-in-charge of Egyptology, curating a collection founded on part of Flinders Petrie's, donated to Manchester by one of his financial backers, Jesse Haworth. During her tenure she corresponded with other Egyptologists to acquire more objects and expand the collection. She was appointed the Assistant Keeper of Egyptology in 1922 and remained in that position until her death in 1932."]}]}}
