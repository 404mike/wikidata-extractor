For the replay, Abegllen took the captain's duties and all was different; Switzerland winning by the single goal.  Otherwise there were two surprises, the first went Egypt's way; 3\u20130 to the good against Hungary.  The second saw Sweden defeat the reigning gold-medallists, Belgium 8\u20131. Oscar Verbeeck's own goal set the Swedes on their way; Sven Rydell's hat-trick the feature of the match.  The Swedish outside-left Rudolf Kock (who would become chairman of the selectors in 1948 working alongside George Raynor), would have another fine game against Egypt where Sweden won 5\u20130.
