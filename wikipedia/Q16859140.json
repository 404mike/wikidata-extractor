His character has a ridicule, to say nothing more, belonging to it; it will certainly lower the dignity of the place...\" Fox suggested that Morice might be reappointed to a lesser office on the Board of Green Cloth again. Realizing the error, Bute sent his brother, James Stuart-Mackenzie, who had met Morice in Italy, to try to persuade him to change offices with Lord Charles Spencer, who was to be Surveyor of Gardens and Waters and Out-Ranger of Windsor Forest; persuasion was vain, however, and Morice was appointed to the comptrollership on 21 December 1762. Sworn of the Privy Council in January 1763, he lost the comptrollership in April when the Bute Ministry fell. The Grenville Ministry compensated him in June by appointing him Lord Warden of the Stannaries.
