Biologist Stephen Jay Gould said: \"White's and Draper's accounts of the actual interaction between science and religion in Western history do not differ greatly. Both tell a tale of bright progress continually sparked by science. And both develop and use the same myths to support their narrative, the flat-earth legend prominently among them\". In a summary of the historiography of the conflict thesis, Colin A. Russell, the former President of Christians in Science, said that \"Draper takes such liberty with history, perpetuating legends as fact that he is rightly avoided today in serious historical study. The same is nearly as true of White, though his prominent apparatus of prolific footnotes may create a misleading impression of meticulous scholarship\".Russell, Colin A., \"The Conflict of Science and Religion\", Encyclopedia of the History of Science and Religion, p. 15, New York 2000"]}, {"page": "HIST Award for Outstanding Achievement in the History of Chemistry", "response": ["* 1990 Colin A.
