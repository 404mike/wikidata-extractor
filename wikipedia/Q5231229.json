He was born at Butleigh, Somerset.\nBeal was a lower-order right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium-pace bowler who took a lot of wickets in club cricket for the Morlands Cricket Club at Glastonbury. He played three first-class matches and six one-day games for Somerset in 1991, having appeared for Somerset's second eleven since 1984. He made little impression in these matches, scoring just one run in both first-class and List A games, and achieving his best bowling in either form of cricket on his debut, in the List A match against Surrey at The Oval, when he took two wickets for 40 runs in his eight overs. He picked up a back injury in a mid-season one-day match against Middlesex and though he returned to the side late in the season, he did not play for any Somerset side after 1991.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Harry and the Hendersons", "response": ["* David Beal \u2013 drums"]}, {"page": "Greg Voelker Rack System", "response": ["The Greg Voelker Rack System is a unique drum rack used by former Megadeth drummer Nick Menza, David Beal drummer for Joe Cocker, Julian Lennon, Honeymoon Suite, Rod Morgenstein drummer for Dixie Dregs and Winger and was voted by Modern Drummer Magazine's \"Most Popular Progressive Rock Drummer\", Michael Foster, drummer for FireHouse, and Whitesnake drummer Tommy Aldridge. It was designed for its lack of stands, which serves for a flashy live look and prevents a drummer/band from knocking over cymbal/drum stands. Designed by Greg Voelker, the rack was made out of Stainless Steel and was attached to a built in riser which allows the bass drums to float. Thereby, giving the drummer more mounting flexibility as well as avoiding the clutter of stands on stage. The racks mentioned were custom made for each drummer. A \"Standard\" rack by Greg Voelker was distributed through Premier drums from the late 1980s to the early to mid-1990s."]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* David Beal (1991) 3 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Glastonbury Cricket Club", "response": ["*Best economy rate: 2.54\u00a0\u2013 David Beal", "* Director of Cricket: David Beal", "*Under 15s team manager: David Beal"]}, {"page": "Beal, David", "response": ["#redirectDavid Beal"]}]}}
