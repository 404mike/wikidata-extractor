He bought a home on Capri, named Villa Tuoro, which he shared with his lover, the photographer Algernon Islay de Courcy Lyons. Bryher supported her husband and his friend on Capri, requesting that they take into their home the aging Norman Douglas, the Scottish novelist. Douglas had been friends of Bryher and Macpherson since 1931. Macpherson remained on Capri until Douglas's death in 1952, writing an epitaph for Douglas, from which the Latin inscription, on Douglas's gravestone, a quote from the Odes of Horace (Book II, Ode 3) is derived (Omnes Eodem Cogimur\u2014we are all driven to the same place).H.D.
