She \"is engaged in an ongoing exploration of the collision between theatre and the internet.\" Since 1997 she has been working on the internet professionally. In the year 2000 Helen Varley Jamieson coined the term cyberformance. This term is a combination of two words, cyberspace and performance. Jamieson states that \"cyberformance can be located as a distinct form within the subsets of networked performance and digital performance, and within the overall form of theatre, as it is a live performance form with an audience that is complicit in the completion of the work in real time.\"Cyberformances are \"live theatrical performances in which remote participants are able to work together in real time through the medium of the internet.\" In her Master Thesis, Jamieson states that \"cyberformance, like all forms of theatre and artistic expression, offers a means to approach and respond to the changing world we exist in.\"In 2008 Helen Varley Jamieson completed her MA (research) degree in Cyberformance from Queensland University of Technology entitled \"Adventures in Cyberformance: experiments at the interface of theatre and the internet.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Elizabeth McCombs", "response": ["*Elizabeth McCombs is the main character in the play Women Like Us (1993), commissioned by the Suffrage Centenary Trust and written by Helen Varley Jamieson."]}, {"page": "Logan Park High School", "response": ["*Helen Varley Jamieson, theatre and digital artist"]}, {"page": "List of new media artists", "response": ["* Helen Varley Jamieson"]}, {"page": "Cyberformance", "response": ["The term 'cyberformance' (a portmanteau word blending 'cyberspace' with 'performance') was coined by the net artist and curator Helen Varley Jamieson. She states that the invention of this term in 2000 \"came out of the need to find a word that avoided the polarisation of virtual and real, and the need for a new term (rather than 'online performance' or 'virtual theatre') for a new genre\". Jamieson traces the history of cyberformance back to the Satellite Arts Project of 1977, when interactive art pioneers Kit Galloway and Sherrie Rabinowitz used live video mixing to create what they called \"a performance space with no geographic boundaries\".", "* Avatar Body Collision.Avatar Body Collision Founded by Helen Varley Jamieson, Karla Ptacek, Vicki Smith, and Leena Saarinen in 2002, this online performance collective uses UpStage, a web-based software purpose-built for cyberformance with a New Zealand government grant"]}, {"page": "UpStage", "response": ["* Helen Varley Jamieson", "* Francesco Buonaiuto, Helen Varley Jamieson and Vicki Smith, The Net and the Butterfly, published in International Journal of Performance Arts and Digital Media Volume 10 Issue 1, 2014 - special issue on \u201cInterdisciplinary Approaches to Documenting Performance\u201d", "* Helen Varley Jamieson and Vicki Smith, UpStage: An Online Tool for Real-Time Storytelling, published in Creative Technologies Journal, Issue 2, November 2011", "* Helen Varley Jamieson, \"UpStage: A Platform for Creating and Performing Online,\" IEEE MultiMedia, vol. 14, no. 3, pp.\u00a08\u201310, Jul-Sept, 2007", "* Patricia Jung and Helen Varley Jamieson, \"Online performances mit UpStage\" - chapter in Video: Wiedergabe, Bearbeitung und Streaming unter Linux, ed.

As part of the festival based in London If Not You Not Me at the HTTP Gallery in London (12 February till 20 March 2010) it furthered Abrahams' concept of employing traces from previous events. The adaptation is entitled as Huis Clois/No Exit \u2013 Jam; the four performers Antye Greie (Finland), Pascale Gustin (France), Helen Varley Jamieson (New Zealand) and Maja Kalogera (Spain/Croatia) were given the task to synchronize sound together whilst competing with the technological constraints such as time delay when transferring from peer to peer. As part of the whole exhibition in London, Abrahams used digital technologies that accessible to the general public and communicates the factors that create a 'disconnection' in amongst a live video/sound collaboration. This fragmented connection between peers in both the virtual and real words consequently generates a fragmented intimacy, frustrations of connectivity (real-time application), shared absences and the desperation to connect from a distance as well as the body's needs of relieving sensual longing in regards to corporeal reality. Huis Clos/No Exit was also presented at On Translation, NIMK Amsterdam, 2010, with Ruth Catlow, Paolo Cirio, Ursula Endlicher, Niciolas Frespech and Igor Stromajer."]}, {"page": "List of New Zealand women artists", "response": ["*Helen Varley Jamieson (born 1966), digital media artist, writer"]}, {"page": "Sally Rodwell", "response": ["* Demeter's Dark Ride - an Attraction (promenade performance), 2005, BATS Theatre, Wellington.
