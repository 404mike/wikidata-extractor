He was in favor of operational economics, helpful to practitioners (n\u00fctzlich).Fernand Goyens, Marktgericht: Professor M.A.G. van Meerhaeghe, ekonomie, RUG, Knack Magazine (16de jaargang), 1 September 1986 (Special edition), pp.\u00a024\u201326. Later he elaborated his criticism in Economic Theory. A Critic's Companion (Martinus Nijhoff 1980), probably his most important work. It caused quite a stir because of its unconventional approach. (K. Nakaura published a Japanese translation.) Guy Routh wrote a favourable review in The Economic Journal (Vol. 91, No. 362, June 1981, p.\u00a0591): \"Professor van Meerhaeghe's book is a masterpiece of condensation:Selectivity was indeed a characteristic of van Meerhaeghe: see e.g. the review of the textbook Economics of R.G. Lipsey and P.O. Steiner by H.J. Klok in De Economist, Vol. 115, Iss. 2, March 1967, pp.\u00a0256\u2013259. a review of economic theory from Plato to Friedman, with the faults exposed, in 109 pages of text. Six chapters deal with the main divisions of the subject (consumer behaviour, producer behaviour, price, income distribution, general level of income and prices, growth, and international trade), one with its practicability, one with its significance, and an appendix added that surveys thirteen types of theory. The preface modestly disclaims any intention of instructing fellow economists. The book is intended as a complement to an introductory course in economics. It is reminiscent of a surveyors report of a tumble-down house. It is unfit for human habitation, one would be mad to buy it, but one does, patches it up together as best one can, and inhabits it contentedly, gradually becoming inured to its defects. It is chastening to learn, from van Meerhaeghe's review, how deftly and how long ago the weaknesses of the economic edifice have been revealed. Mayer (1932),Hans Mayer (1879-1955) : Die Wirtschaftstheorie der Gegenwart (1927-32), Der Erkenntniswert der funktionellen Preistheorien (1932). Miry (1937), Triffin (1940) and many others produced cogent criticisms that, had they been heeded, would have helped to convert economics into an operational science. Instead, their names and doctrines have been forgotten, and we may be grateful to van Meerhaeghe for reminding us of them.\" G. Routh's conclusion is brief and to the point : \"This guarantees van Meerhaeghe's slim volume a long life. I fear that in ten years time its criticisms will be as valid and as relevant as they are today\". He proved to be something of an optimist: they remain as valid today as they did in 1981.E.g.
