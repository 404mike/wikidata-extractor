In lectures published long afterwards, Thomas Allen (who knew and admired Thomas Hooker, Peter Bulkley and Thomas Shepard) taught the doctrine of imputed righteousness through the Covenant of Grace, appealing to the soul's tuition by the Holy Spirit.Sermon VII: 'The Holy Ghost revealeth Christ's Righteousness', in T.

The special interconnection between the magistracy and the ecclesiastical polity of the Colony, as set forth in the Body of Liberties of 1641,Whitmore, Colonial Laws of Massachusetts, pp. 29-68. and shown in the practice of its courts, was fully embodied in the final chapter of the Cambridge Platform, binding civil powers to the enforcement of ecclesiastical judgements against actions or opinions varying from or inimical to the word preached.The Cambridge Platform of Church Discipline adopted in 1648, Chapter XVII, at pp. 82-85 (Hathi Trust).", ";Thomas Shepard, junr.", "A letter of February 1657/58 from Ezekiel Rogers, pastor at Rowley, Massachusetts, lamenting the state of the world, expresses his affection for Symmes.Mather, Magnalia Christi Americana, I, pp. 372-73 (Google).

The long absence of a Teacher at Charlestown was supplied in 1659 by Thomas Shepard (1635-1677), son of the lamented pastor of Cambridge. Shepard emerged from Harvard College in the class of 1653 and was chosen a Fellow in 1654, while the younger Zechariah Symmes was studying there.Sibley, Biographical Sketches of Graduates, pp. 327-335 and p. 489 (Google). In the absence of an Elder, the Platform now provided for ordination by elders of other churches, if at the express desire of the church ordaining: having been admitted to Charlestown on 31 October 1658 by dismissal from Cambridge, he was accordingly ordained (with prayer and fasting) to the office of Teacher at Charlestown by the imposition of hands of Symmes, and of pastors John Wilson (Boston) and Richard Mather (Dorchester). John Norton (Teacher, Boston) gave him the right hand of fellowship in the name of Boston, Roxbury, Cambridge and Watertown, as Symmes carefully recorded:S. Sewell, 'Appendix to Brief Survey of Congregational Churches and Ministers in the County of Middlesex', in B.B. Edwards and W. Cogswell (eds), The American Quarterly Register Volume XII (February 1840), pp 234-53, at p. 244. Shepard, who like Symmes was conservative in doctrine, remained with him thereafter, and the Charlestown church records are then mainly in his hand.Frothingham, History of Charlestown, pp. 161-62 (Internet Archive).", "Further admonitions in early 1664 failed to prevent Gould's continued meetings, and in May 1665 he and eight others formed a church, re-baptized, and signed articles, so instituting the First Baptist Church in Boston.Wood, First Baptist Church of Boston, pp. 55-64 (Internet Archive). The Charlestown church proceeded to excommunication in late June or July 1665, and in September\u2013October Gould, Osborne and three others, having presented a confession of faith,Wood, First Baptist Church of Boston, pp. 64-71 (Internet Archive). came before the General Court and were condemned as schismatics and disfranchised of their freedom of the Colony, under threat of immediate imprisonment. But they continued to meet until April 1666, when being called before the grand jury at Suffolk County Quarterly Court they refused to pay fines and were imprisoned. In March 1668 Gould appealed to the Court of Assistants and the Suffolk County judgement was overturned, but then reinstated.Backus, History of the Baptists, I, pp. 371-80 (Internet Archive). Governor Bellingham then agreed to sponsor the Boston Debate of 14\u201315 April 1668, ostensibly to deliberate on their views, but (as the transcript reveals) intending to defeat or incriminate them.W.G. McLoughlin and M.W. Davidson, 'The Baptist Debate of April 14\u201315, 1668', Proceedings of the Massachusetts Historical Society 3rd Series, Vol. 76 (1964), pp. 91-133 (Jstor - Login). Jonathan Mitchel (Moderating) and Thomas Shepard challenged them at length: Symmes was present, but spoke only to say he thought Gould was very sinful. Gould and another were again imprisoned, and (despite a scandalous petition to free themBackus, History of the Baptists, pp. 380-82, & ff.

It bore an epitaph which is no longer legible, but which was observed by Cotton Mather, who recorded the lines:\"A prophet lies under this stone:His words shall live, though he be gone.\" He adds that it ought to have said, \"Here lies the friend of Mr. Jeremiah Burroughs\", for he has the letters Burroughs sent to Symmes on his coming to New England, in which Burroughs compares their love to that of David and Jonathan, as a sort of sworn brotherhood from their University days.Mather, Magnalia Christi Americana, 2nd edition, I,pp. 415-16 (Google).
