In the final round, however, leader Charles played poorly opening doors to the field. Katsumata was unable to take advantage, though, shooting a 74 (+2) to finish in a tie for sixth place. The following week the played the Capitol Hills Open, also in the Philippines. After three rounds he was again in contention, this time at 216, five back of leaders Thomson and Tomoo Ishii. He again played poorly in the final round, however, shooting a 75 to finish in a tie for 10th. The following week he played the Singapore Open. He opened with a 72 (\u22121) to put him in a tie for 8th place with Frank Phillips, three back of the lead. In the second round he shot a 74 (+1) but against \"heavy rains\" this was among the better rounds of the day.
