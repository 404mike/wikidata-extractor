He played 161 games in a nine-year career in the Football League, 182 games in four seasons of play in the Southern League, and finally made 54 appearances in two Alliance Premier League campaigns.\nHe began his career at Walsall, making his debut in the 1966\u201367 season. However he featured just 13 times in four seasons before he moved on to Port Vale in July 1970. He was an ever-present in the 1971\u201372 season and made 134 consecutive appearances from his debut until he twisted his knee in March 1973. Another knee injury seven months later then caused him to be sidelined for 17 months. He took a free transfer to Nuneaton Borough at the end of the 1974\u201375 season. He made 236 league and cup appearances over the next six seasons at Nuneaton, lifting the Birmingham Senior Cup in 1980, before he retired due to other work commitments the following year.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wednesbury", "response": ["*Roy Cross, footballer, played for Port Vale in the early 1970s and transferred to Nuneaton Borough in 1975"]}, {"page": "Gordon Lee (footballer)", "response": ["Preparing for life in the Third Division, Lee released Ken Wookey, Stuart Shaw, Eric Magee, Stuart Chapman, and Gordon Logan. In their place he signed centre-half Roy Cross from Walsall, inside-forward Brian Horton from Hednesford Town, and full-back Mick Hopkinson from Mansfield Town. He steadied the ship in the midst of infighting in the boardroom, and the team went on a four-game winning streak in October that included a 2\u20130 win over fallen-giants Aston Villa. In January, he signed John Brodie from Northern Premier League side Bradford Park Avenue for \u00a3250, and noted that his team's performances were not helped by the 'boo boys' at Vale Park.

Over the course of the 1973\u201374 season he scored five goals in 36 games, and picked up the club's Player of the Year award.

On 1 October, Vale beat Wrexham 1\u20130 in an 'ugly' game that saw five players booked and Colin Tartt and opposition player Arfon Griffiths separated by police following a scrap in the tunnel. Later in the month Roy Cross badly injured his knee, and would later have to leave the professional game due to the injury. Vale slipped down the league, and by Christmas they were sixth from bottom, with only John Woodward in good form. Lee then took out striker Keith Leonard on loan from Aston Villa, and bought left-back Neil Griffiths from Chester for a \u00a35,000 fee. He also changed the formation from 4\u20134\u20132 to 4\u20133\u20133, hoping to give Brian Horton more room in the centre of the park. After an upturn in form in the new year, Bill Summerscales broke his neck, and Lee departed for the management position at Blackburn Rovers. Lee had been seen to have done an excellent job with little money. In his place club legend Roy Sproson was appointed as caretaker manager, who advocated an 'entertaining' style of play as opposed to battling for every point. Winning his first match 1\u20130 at Shrewsbury Town, he cracked his head on the concrete trainer's box after leaping up to celebrate McLaren's goal. On 17 February, 8,505 turned up at Vale Park to witness a 3\u20131 win over high-flying Bristol Rovers in an experimental Sunday game. Later Leonard returned to Villa Park at the end of his loan deal, and \u00a35,000 was not enough to tempt Villa to part with his services permanently. From mid-March Vale went eleven games without a win, and on 25 March they could have ended this run, but 'a shocking mistake' from Alan Boswell handed Walsall an equalizer as he palmed a header into his own net. The team continued to rack up yellow cards, and following a warning from The Football Association, Sproson arranged for local referee Roy Capey to lecture the players on sportsmanship. In the middle of April, Sproson was given the management job on a permanent basis, despite his team falling to fifth from bottom. Sproson stated that he was 'calculated' and 'controlled', compared to Lee who 'fizzes like a bottle of pop'. By the time they broke their poor run with a 2\u20131 home win over managerless Charlton Athletic, other results had already ensured their safety from the drop.", "|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Roy Cross"]}, {"page": "1974\u201375 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["On the financial side, a loss was made of \u00a316,964 despite donations of \u00a313,803 from the development funds.
