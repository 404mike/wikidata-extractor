Soon afterwards, Dempsey was dropped from the band because of his cold reception to material Smith had written for the upcoming album.

The album was released in 1980 and reached number 20 on the UK charts. A single from the album, \"A Forest\", became the band's first UK hit single, reaching number 31 on the singles chart. The album was a departure from the Cure's sound up to that point, with Hedges describing it as \"morose, atmospheric, very different to Three Imaginary Boys.\" In its review of Seventeen Seconds the NME said, \"For a group as young as the Cure, it seems amazing that they have covered so much territory in such a brief time.\" At the same time, Smith was pressed concerning the concept of an alleged \"anti-image\". Smith told the press he was fed up with the anti-image association that some considered to be \"elaborately disguising their plainness\", stating, \"We had to get away from that anti-image thing, which we didn't even create in the first place. And it seemed like we were trying to be more obscure. We just didn't like the standard rock thing. The whole thing really got out of hand.\" That same year Three Imaginary Boys was repackaged for the American market as Boys Don't Cry, with new artwork and a modified track list. The Cure set out on their first world tour to promote both releases. At the end of the tour, Matthieu Hartley left the band. Hartley said, \"I realised that the group was heading towards suicidal, sombre music\u2014the sort of thing that didn't interest me at all.\""]}, {"page": "Robert Smith (musician)", "response": ["On 3 and 4 April 1980 at the Rainbow Theatre in London, Robert Smith and Matthieu Hartley (also of the Magspies, Cult Hero and by this time, the Cure) were among the many guest members of a unique line-up of The Stranglers to play two protest concerts for Hugh Cornwell, who had been imprisoned on drugs charges in late 1979.Clinic No. 4, September 1980Thompson, Dave & Jo-Ann Greene, The Cure \u2013 A Visual Documentary, (1988), Omnibus Press, p. 23.
