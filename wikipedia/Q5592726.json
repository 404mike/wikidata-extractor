The current record for the Camogie course is held by Patricia Jackman of Waterford when in 2013 she completed the course in 27 pocs and 7 metres (over the end line).

Carlow bounced back with a brace of points to level the tie for the sixth time. The sides went point for point between the 46th and 67th minutes, until Carlow's late surge left the outcome of this game beyond doubt. The crucial goal arrived three minutes from time when Andrew Gaule dispatched the ball from 65 metres out into full-forward Robert Foley who powered the ball to the net. Although there were calls for a penalty after Foley was swung around in the small square by Down full-back Stephen Murray, the referee applied the advantage rule with Foley turning and planting the ball past goalkeeper Graham Clarke. Craig Doyle added a late point to seal the Carlow victory."]}, {"page": "Down county hurling team", "response": ["**2007 Graham Clarke"]}]}}
