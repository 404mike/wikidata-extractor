Corel Corp.", "response": ["In November 2017, 27 prominent art historians, museum curators and critics (including Bendor Grosvenor, Waldemar Januszczak, Martin Kemp, Janina Ramirez, Robin Simon, David Solkin, Hugh Belsey, Sir Nicholas Goodison, and Malcolm Rogers) wrote to The Times newspaper to urge that \"fees charged by the UK's national museums to reproduce images of historic paintings, prints and drawings are unjustified, and should be abolished\". They commented that \"[m]useums claim they create a new copyright when making a faithful reproduction of a 2D artwork by photography or scanning, but it is doubtful that the law supports this\". They argued that the fees inhibit the dissemination of knowledge, the very purpose of public museums and galleries, and so \"pose a serious threat to art history\". They therefore advised the UK's national museums \"to follow the example of a growing number of international museums (such as the Netherlands' Rijksmuseum) and provide open access to images of publicly owned, out-of-copyright paintings, prints and drawings so that they are free for the public to reproduce\"."]}, {"page": "George Clavering-Cowper, 3rd Earl Cowper", "response": ["Clavering-Cowper was at the time known as Viscount Fordwich.

He had ambitions to be the British representative in Florence and he tried to increase his favour with the King. He sent a small painting to the King and also sent further copies of Italian works to England. The job he wanted was held by Sir Horace Mann who despite not being as much in favour as Cowper, was still the British Resident in Florence.Hugh Belsey, \"Mann, Sir Horatio, first baronet (bap. 1706, d. 1786)\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, September 2004; online ed., May 2009.
