At the coronation of King Edward VII in 1902, the driving force had been Viscount Esher in his capacity as Secretary to the Office of Works, a position which had since been filled by Sir Schomberg Kerr McDonnell. However, in the interim, the Earl Marshal, Henry Fitzalan-Howard, 15th Duke of Norfolk, had reasserted his ancient right to organise the great state events, despite having a personal dislike of ceremonial and having little capability as an organiser. The Earl Marshal had no permanent staff and was obliged to appoint a new one for each event. This arrangement had proved highly unsatisfactory for Edward VII's state funeral, when the ceremonial directions were found to be full of errors and had to be rewritten by courtiers on the previous evening, the printed order of service was wrong, and the seating of guests was alleged to be \"a mosaic of indecision and confusion\". King George described Norfolk as \"a charming, honourable, straightforward little gentleman, the finest in the world. But as a man of business he is absolutely impossible\".Kuhn, pp. 129-130"]}, {"page": "List of Knights Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order appointed by George V", "response": ["|Hon.
