Williams, is Emeritus Professor of Clinical Psychology and Honorary Senior Research Fellow at the University of Oxford Department of Psychiatry.  He held previous posts at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, the Medical Research Council Applied Psychology Unit (now Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit) in Cambridge and the University of Wales Bangor, where he founded the Institute for Medical and Social Care Research and the Centre for Mindfulness Research and Practice.  He is a Fellow of the British Psychological Society, the Academy of Medical Sciences and the British Academy. He was educated at Stockton Grammar School, Stockton-on-Tees, and at St Peter's College, Oxford.\nHis research is concerned with psychological models and treatment of depression and suicidal behaviour. He uses experimental cognitive psychology \u2013 in particular investigations into the specificity of autobiographical memory \u2013 to help understand the processes that increase risk of suicidal behaviour in depression.  With colleagues John D. Teasdale (Cambridge) and Zindel Segal (Toronto) he developed Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT; [1]) for prevention of relapse and recurrence in depression, and several RCTs have now found that MBCT significantly decreases the recurrence rate in those who have suffered three or more previous episodes of major depression.Williams is an ordained priest of the Church of England and Honorary Canon of Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford.

According to James Shaheen, the editor of US Buddhist magazine Tricycle: The Buddhist Review, \"In the West, he's an icon. I can't think of a Western Buddhist who does not know of Thich Nhat Hanh.\" His 1975 book The Miracle of Mindfulness was credited with helping to \"lay the foundations\" for the use of mindfulness in treating depression through \"mindfulness-based cognitive therapy\", influencing the work of University of Washington psychology professor Marsha M. Linehan, the originator of Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT). J. Mark G. Williams, from Oxford University and the Oxford Mindfulness Centre, said that \"What he was able to do was to communicate the essentials of Buddhist wisdom and make it accessible to people all over the world, and build that bridge between the modern world of psychological science and the modern healthcare system and these ancient wisdom practices \u2013 and then he continued to do that in his teaching.\" One of Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh's students Jon Kabat-Zinn, went on to develop the mindfulness-based stress reduction course that is available at hospitals and medical centres across the world, and as of 2015, around 80% of medical schools are reported to have offered mindfulness training. As of 2019, it was reported that mindfulness as espoused by Nhat Hanh had become the theoretical underpinning of a $1.1 billion industry in the US.

Williams and colleagues have argued that anxious individuals tend to prioritize threat stimuli during early information processing, and direct their attention away from threats in more strategic stages of processing. This correlates with the vigilance-avoidance pattern, which is when one initially directs attention to threat, however then proceeds to avoid processing details and information in order to avoid an anxious state of mind. Conversely, others theorize that anxiety has little impact on initial detection of threats but has is more significant in modulating the maintenance of attention on the source of the threat. This can be explained by the alternative theory to the vigilance-avoidance pattern, which is that anxious individuals, once processing the threat, struggle to disengage attention from the threat stimuli due to reasons such as fear."]}, {"page": "Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy", "response": ["* Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for depression: a new approach to preventing relapse, by Zindel V.

Initial studies displayed an association between depression and a failure to remember positive events, with the explanation being that the depressed individual had an excess of negative memories.  However, in 1986, J. Mark G. Williams and Keith Broadbent examined patterns of autobiographical memory in people who recently attempted suicide.  When compared to a healthy control group, the suicidal group displayed a general memory, especially for positively valenced cues.  This study contradicted past research by explaining that the bias to remember negative events is not due to an excess of negative memories, but is because of an overgeneral memory.  Since this initial study, research on OGM has expanded and has been further implicated in the risk to and maintenance of depression and PTSD.Moore, S. A. & Zoellner, L. A. (2007).
