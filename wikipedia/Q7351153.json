He was appointed as a Fellow of the college in 1867, retaining this position until 1889.  He was ordained in the Church of England in 1868, and served as vicar of Wolvercote, Oxfordshire, from 1875 to 1879, when he became Warden of Radley College (until 1888); he was also vicar of Radley from 1880 to 1893. In 1894, he was appointed Warden of Keble College, Oxford, and made an Honorary Fellow of Merton.  He died on 15 May 1897. His writings included joint authorship (with Henry Parry Liddon) of a biography of Edward Bouverie Pusey, one of the leaders of the Oxford Movement.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Henry Liddon", "response": ["He died on 9 September 1890 at the height of his reputation, having nearly completed a biography of Pusey, whom he admired; this work was completed after his death by John Octavius Johnston and Robert Wilson. His entry in the 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica asserts that Liddon's influence during his life was due to his personal fascination and his pulpit oratory rather than to his intellect. As a theologian his outlook was old-fashioned; to the last he maintained the narrow standpoint of Pusey and Keble, in defiance of modern thought and modern scholarship. The publication in 1889 of Lux Mundi edited by Charles Gore, a series of essays attempting to harmonise Anglican Catholic doctrine with modern thought, showed that even at Pusey House, established as the citadel of Puseyism at Oxford, the principles of Pusey were being departed from. He was the last of the classical pulpit orators of the English Church, the last great popular exponent of the traditional Anglican orthodoxy, with the exception of John Charles Ryle (1816-1900), the first Anglican bishop of Liverpool (1880-1900)."]}, {"page": "Robert Wilson", "response": ["Robert Wilson may refer to:", "* Robert Wilson (crime novelist) (born 1957), British crime novelist", "* Robert Wilson (dramatist) (died 1600), English Elizabethan dramatist", "* Robert Wilson (editor) (born 1951), American magazine editor and author", "* Robert Wilson (tenor) (1907\u20131964), Scottish tenor", "* Robert Wilson (American singer) (1957\u20132010), American R&B and funk musician in The Gap Band", "* Robert Wilson (music entrepreneur) (born 1951), British musician and charity founder", "* Juice Wilson (Robert Wilson, 1904\u20131993), American jazz violinist", "* Robert Wilson (born 1980), Bobby V, American R&B singer formerly known as Bobby Valentino", "* Robert Wilson (director) (born 1941), American avant-garde stage director and playwright", "* Sir Robert Wilson (British Army officer, born 1777) (1777\u20131849), British Army general", "* Robert Wilson (British Army officer, born 1911) (1911\u20132002), British Army special operations officer", "* Robert Wilson (Missouri politician) (1803\u20131870), U.S. Senator from Missouri", "* Robert Wilson (Australian politician) (1896\u20131973), New South Wales politician", "* Robert Wilson (Manitoba politician) (born 1934), Manitoba politician", "* Robert Wilson (Texas politician), land speculator and politician in Texas", "* Robert Wilson (physician) (1829\u20131881), wrote about the British mining industry", "* Robert Wilson (astronomer) (1927\u20132002), British astronomer", "* Robert Wilson (running back) (born 1969), American football player", "* Robert Wilson (wide receiver) (1974\u20132020), American football player", "* Robert Wilson (rugby league) (1879\u20131916), rugby league footballer for England and Broughton Ranchers", "* Robert Wilson (rugby union, born 1854) (1854\u20131911), Scottish rugby union player", "* Robert Wilson (rugby union) (1861\u20131944), rugby union player for New Zealand in 1884", "* Robert Wilson (bobsleigh) (born 1954), Canadian Olympic bobsledder", "* Robert Wilson (cricketer, born 1922) (1922\u20131980), first-class cricketer", "*Robert Wilson (cricketer, born 1934)", "* Robert Wilson (Canadian rower) (born 1935), Canadian Olympic rower", "* Robert Wilson (tennis) (born 1935), tennis player in the 1960s", "* Robert Wilson (American rower) (born 1939), American Olympic rower", "* Robert Wilson (cricketer, born 1948), New Zealand cricketer", "* Robert Wilson (footballer, born 1961), English football player for Fulham", "* Robert Wilson (Scottish footballer), Scottish footballer (Partick Thistle}", "* Robert Wilson (architect) (1834\u20131901), Scottish architect", "* Robert Wilson (businessman) (born 1942/1943), British businessman", "* Robert Wilson (engineer) (1803\u20131882), Scottish engineer and inventor", "* Robert Wilson (philosopher) (born 1964), philosophy professor", "* Robert Wilson (priest) (1840\u20131897), Warden of Keble College, Oxford", "* Robert Wilson (ship captain) (1806\u20131888), Great Lakes captain who helped slaves escape", "* Robert Wilson (merchant) (1832\u20131899), New Zealand merchant and company director"]}, {"page": "List of Worthing inhabitants", "response": ["* Robert Wilson, Anglican priest, was born in Worthing in 1840"]}, {"page": "List of people with surname Wilson", "response": ["** Charles Robert Wilson (1863\u20131904), English academic and historian of British India", "** James Robert Wilson (1866\u20131941), mayor of Saskatoon and member of the Parliament of Canada", "*** Kenneth Robert Wilson (born 1965), American drummer for band Marilyn Manson, aka Kenny, better known as Ginger Fish", "* Rob and Robert Wilson (disambiguation), multiple people", "*** Robert Wilson (dramatist) (died 1600), English Elizabethan dramatist", "*** Robert Wilson (Missouri politician) (1803\u20131870), American politician and U.S. Senator from Missouri", "*** Robert Wilson (engineer) (1803\u20131882), Scottish engineer;
