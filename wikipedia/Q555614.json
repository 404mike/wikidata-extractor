Wilcox (Pub. 2006) Relations between the two men were poor, and within days of their meeting Townshend was writing letters to Nixon's superiors in India proposing himself as a better man to lead Force D.Perry, James Arrogant Armies, Edison: Castle Books, 2005 page 251.

He reported that if he could defeat the Ottomans at Kurna, he could take Baghdad at once, which led Nixon to reply that he was looking forward to riding into Baghdad in triumph on a white horse. On 23 August 1915, Townshend reported to London that if he defeated the Ottomans \"and stampeded them, as at Kurna, he was willing to take the responsibility of entering Baghdad\". He noted that it was about 500 miles from where he was to Baghdad and that he was \"undermanned as regards land and water transport\", lacking enough ships and wagons to supply a drive to Baghdad, but reflecting the optimistic mood, wrote \"Sir John Nixon told me to send him a wire if I intended a rush into Baghdad, as he might be able to come on in time to enter Baghdad with me.\" As long as the outcome of the Battle of Gallipoli was in doubt, the Ottomans exerted all of their efforts there and largely ignored Townshend's \"Regatta up the Tigris\". However, by August 1915 it was clear that Gallipoli was a stalemate following the failure of the British to break out after their landings at Suvla Bay, which ended the last British chance of victory at Gallipoli. The deadlock was strategically an Ottoman victory, as it prevented the Allies from taking Constantinople. With the Allies contained at Gallipoli, the Three Pashas who now ruled the Ottoman Empire sent a substantial force of Turkish infantrymen under General Nureddin Pasha to stop Townshend. Before the arrival of Nureddin, Townshend had been facing Ottoman Arab units which were of lesser quality as compared to the ethnic Turkish Ottoman units.Karsh, Efraim & Karsh, Inari Empires of the Sand: The Struggle for Mastery in the Middle East, 1789\u20131923, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1999 page 147. The core of the Ottoman Army had always been Turkish peasant conscripts from Anatolia, well known for their toughness and tenacity in combat.Akme\u0219e, Handan Nezir The Birth of Modern Turkey: The Ottoman Military and the March to WWI, Manchester: Manchester University Press, pages 112\u2013113 & 141.

On 24 February 1917, Kut-al-Amara fell to the joint British and Indian force, and Baghdad was captured in March 1917. A week after the capture of Baghdad, General Maude issued the Proclamation of Baghdad, which contained the famous line, \"our armies do not come into your cities and lands as conquerors or enemies, but as liberators\".
