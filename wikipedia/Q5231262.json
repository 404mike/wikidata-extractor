The cluib advanced to the third round of the League Cup where they met holders Liverpool at Anfield. In one of the club most famous victories, Grimsby held the Premier League team to a 0\u20130 draw after 90 minutes taking the game into extra time. Despite Gary McAllister scoring a penalty following a David Beharall handball to put the Reds 1\u20130 up, loan signing Marlon Broomes equalised before ex-Everton youth player Phil Jevons hit a 35-yard strike into the top corner of Chris Kirkland's goal to give the club a historic victory. Grimsby's push for promotion faltered and the team's form declined rapidly, with Lawrence being dismissed halfway into the season. Paul Groves, the skipper, was chosen to replace him and he steered them to a 19th in the final table, enough to avoid relegation, but a disappointing end to a season which had begun so promisingly. The season was overshadowed by loanee Martin Pringle's footballing career being ended after a leg-breaking tackle by Stockport County defender Dave Challinor, This was also aggravated more by the referee Mike Dean only awarding Challinor a yellow card for the horrific career ending challenge., As well as the collapse of ITV Digital putting enormous strain on finances for the club.", "* David Beharall"]}, {"page": "Beharall", "response": ["#REDIRECT David Beharall"]}, {"page": "2005 Conference National play-off Final", "response": ["|DF ||16||David Beharall"]}, {"page": "1998\u201399 Newcastle United F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|33||align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| David Beharall"]}, {"page": "1999\u20132000 Newcastle United F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|27||align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| David Beharall"]}, {"page": "2001\u201302 Newcastle United F.C. season", "response": ["|  David Beharall"]}, {"page": "David Alexander Beharall", "response": ["#REDIRECT David Beharall"]}, {"page": "Dave Beharall", "response": ["#REDIRECT David Beharall"]}, {"page": "Beharall, David", "response": ["#redirectDavid Beharall"]}]}}
