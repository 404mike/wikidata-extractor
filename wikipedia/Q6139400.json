In the autumn of that year he enrolled at the Dundee School of Art, for a four-year Diploma course in Drawing and Painting under James McIntosh Patrick and Edward Baird.

They were not well off.Patrick Hennessy,De Profundis -  Here he met Harry Robertson Craig who would become his lifelong companion.Literary Lives: Portraits from the Crawford Art Gallery and Abbey Theatre, Ireland (2010), p.62 Hennessy played a full part in the social activities of the college, winning a fancy dress award at the Christmas revels in 1935 and producing a ballet \"Paradise Lost\" the following year. He gained a First Class Pass in each year of the course along with winning first prize in 1934 and 1936 for work done during the summer vacation. He graduated with a First Class Distinction in 1937. Having gained a scholarship he continued his studies there for a further year by doing a Post-Graduate Diploma course in Drawing and Painting. He also helped out his old high school by painting the background scenery at their concert.  Within a month of gaining his Post-Graduate Diploma he held his first joint exhibition at the Art Galleries in Arbroath. In June 1938 he was awarded the Annual Travelling Scholarship for further studies in  Paris and Italy. In Paris he met up with the artists Robert Colquhoun and Robert MacBryde whom he had met the previous year, the three travelling south together to Marseilles towards the end of that year. On his return to Scotland he was selected for the residential summer school course at Hospitalfield House near Arbroath under James Cowie. Hennessy voiced some criticism of the Principal of Dundee College of Art for not recruiting locally. Two of his paintings, a still life and a self-portrait, were accepted that year by the Royal Scottish Academy for their Annual Exhibition. However, by the autumn of 1939 with war looming and feeling somewhat disenchanted on his return to Scotland after his travels abroad as well as an unhappy experience at Hospitalfield House he decided to leave Scotland and return to Ireland.Patrick Hennessy, De Profundis-published on the occasion of the exhibition-(inside back cover of book)"]}, {"page": "Scotland in the modern era", "response": ["In art, the first significant group to emerge in the 20th century were the Scottish Colourists in the 1920s: John Duncan Fergusson (1874\u20131961), Francis Cadell (1883\u20131937), Samuel Peploe (1871\u20131935) and Leslie Hunter (1877\u20131931).
