He knows how to pass a ball, but must quicken in recovery.\" He played again two weeks later, in a 3\u20132 defeat at home to Burnley, this time at right half. The same column noted that Burnley's attack flourished on their right side, while they made little impact against Whelan, a player of \"fine physique [who] makes grand use of the ball\".

He played in five of the next six matches, on either side of the half-back line, and scored once, a penalty in a 1\u20131 draw at home to Chesterfield. He spent the remainder of his Durham career as a reserve and occasional first-team stand-in. The last of his 10 senior appearances was as one of three different centre forwards tried at the beginning of the 1923\u201324 season before the arrival of Tom Elliott from Brentford filled the vacancy."]}]}}
