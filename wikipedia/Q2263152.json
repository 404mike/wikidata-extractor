The public affair caused a scandal and attracted great attention in contemporary Belgium. \nArcadie had two sons with Leopold, who were ennobled as the Barons d'Eppinghoven by Leopold's nephew, Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.  \nIn 1863 Arcadie was also awarded the title of Baronin von Eppinghoven.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Louise of Orl\u00e9ans", "response": ["After the birth of their last child in 1840, Leopold and Louise often spent their free time separately: while Leopold visited the Ardennes, Louise preferred to take her vacations in Oostende.

Louise's health, which was weakened by childbirth as well as the misfortunes of her family in France, caused the sympathies of the public to be with Louise against Leopold in this matter, and the carriage of his mistress was bombarded with filth on the street."]}, {"page": "Claret (surname)", "response": ["*Arcadie Claret (1826\u20131897), mistress of King Leopold I of Belgium"]}, {"page": "Arcadie Meyer", "response": ["#REDIRECT Arcadie Claret"]}]}}
