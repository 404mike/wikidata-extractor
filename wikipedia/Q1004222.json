In 1920 he published Bulldog Drummond, whose eponymous hero became his best-known creation. The character was based on McNeile himself, on his friend Gerard Fairlie and on English gentlemen generally. McNeile wrote ten Bulldog Drummond novels, as well as three plays and a screenplay.", "McNeile adapted Bulldog Drummond for the stage.  It was produced at Wyndham's Theatre during the 1921\u201322 season, with Gerald du Maurier playing the title role; it ran for 428 performances. The play also ran in New York during the same season, with A. E. Matthews as Drummond. Later in 1922 McNeile resigned his reserve commission with the rank of lieutenant-colonel, and moved as a tax exile to Territet, Montreux, Switzerland, with his wife; the Swiss countryside was later described in a number of his stories.", "In 1929 McNeile edited a volume of short stories from O. Henry, The Best of O. Henry; the stories had served as models for him when he had started as a writer. The same year, the film Bulldog Drummond was released, starring Ronald Colman in the title role. Colman was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor at the 3rd Academy Awards ceremony. The film earned $750,000 at the box office, and McNeile received an estimated \u00a35,000 for the rights to his novel. The same year he wrote his second play\u2014The Way Out\u2014which was staged at the Comedy Theatre in January 1930. About a year later he and his wife returned to England, and settled near Pulborough, West Sussex.", "In 1937 McNeile was working with Fairlie on the play Bulldog Drummond Hits Out when he was diagnosed with terminal throat cancer. He came to an agreement with Fairlie for the play to continue after his death and for Fairlie to continue writing the Drummond stories. McNeile died on 14 August 1937 at his home in West Chiltington, West Sussex. Although most sources identify throat cancer as the cause of death, Treadwell also suggests that it may have been lung cancer. It was \"traceable to his war service\", and attributed to a gas attack. His funeral, with full military honours, was conducted at Woking crematorium. At his death his estate was valued at over \u00a326,000.", "Bulldog Drummond Hits Out was finished by Fairlie and had a short tour of Brighton, Birmingham, Manchester and Edinburgh, before opening in London at the Savoy Theatre on 21 December 1937. The story was later turned into a novel by Fairlie, with the title Bulldog Drummond on Dartmoor. Fairlie continued to write Drummond novels, seven in total. When the Second World War broke out, Fairlie put Bulldog Drummond firmly in the anti-fascist camp, fighting for Britain.", "McNeile's early works, the war stories published before 1919, are either \"plot-driven adventure narrative[s]\", such as the short stories \"The Song of the Bayonet\" and \"Private Meyrick, Company Idiot\", or \"atmospheric vignette[s]\", such as \"The Land of Topsy Turvy\" and \"The Human Touch\". McNeile would write about 1,000 words every morning in a routine that was rarely disturbed; he took no breaks while writing and would do no re-writes until he completed his work. The academic Jessica Meyer has criticised his style as having \"little aesthetic merit, being stylised, clich\u00e9d and often repetitive\"; Richard Usborne agreed, adding that the female characters were \"cardboard\" and that McNeile was \"wonderfully forgetful\" about characters dead in one book and alive in the next. In  the Bulldog Drummond stories, Watson identifies  the central character  as \"a melodramatic creation, workable only within a setting of melodrama\". The academic Joan DelFattore points out that while the characters and plots cannot be considered to be unique, credible or well-rounded, his books \"make no claim to literary excellence\", and are instead, \"good, solid thrillers\". Usborne agrees, and believes that McNeile wrote good stories that were flawed but well told. Meyer classifies the non-war stories as middlebrow, with \"sentimental plotlines and presenting a social message about the condition of England\". His early novels, particularly Bull-Dog Drummond and The Black Gang, were structured loosely and in some ways as short stories. The academic Hans Bertens blamed this on McNeile's lack of experience and self-confidence, noting that in his later novels, McNeile \"mastered the tricks of his trade\".", "The major theme running throughout McNeile's works is the First World War. Between 1915 and 1918 he had five collections of short stories published about the war, while his post-war fiction can be seen as an extension of those stories, as \"both treat the war as a trial with manhood at stake\". His war stories were considered by contemporary audiences as anti-sentimental, realistic depictions of the trenches, and as a \"celebration of the qualities of the Old Contemptibles\". McNeile's view, as expressed through his writing, was that war was a purposeful activity for the nation and for individuals, even if that purpose was later wasted: a \"valuable chance at national renewal that had been squandered\". The positive effects of war on the individual were outlined by McNeile in The Making of an Officer, his series of articles in The Times, in which he wrote about \"the qualities of leadership and selflessness essential to 'inspire' subalterns\", a theme he returned to in his war stories\u2014particularly The Lieutenant and Others and Sergeant Michael Cassidy, R.E\u2014and then afterwards in his fictional stories, notably the Bulldog Drummond works.", "McNeile's war story collections sold well; nearly 50,000 copies of his first book, Sergeant Michael Cassidy, R.E., were purchased in its first year, and nearly 58,000 copies the following year. His thrillers were also popular, with Bulldog Drummond selling 396,302 copies between 1920 and 1939, exceeding the 100,000-copies benchmark for \"best-sellers\". At his peak in the 1920s, he was the highest paid short story writer in the world, and it was estimated that in the last five years of his life he was earning around \u00a310,000 a year; the Daily Mirror estimated that during his writing career he had earned \u00a385,000.", "McNeile's war stories were seen by reviewers as honest portrayals of the war, with British and American reviewers in the mainstream press praising his realism and avoidance of sentimentality in dealing with his subject matter. Reviewing Men, Women, and Guns for The Times Literary Supplement, Francis Henry Gribble wrote that \"Sapper has been successful in previous volumes of war stories\u00a0... When the time comes for picking out the writers whose war fiction has permanent value, his claim to be included in the list will call for serious examination.\" The reviewer of Sergeant Michael Cassidy, R.E. for The Atlanta Constitution reminded its readers that McNeile \"has been called the foremost literary genius of the British army.\" Jaillant observes that once McNeile moved from war stories to thrillers, with the concurrent re-positioning of advertising and marketing by Hodder & Stoughton, the reviewers also treated him differently, and presented him as \"a writer of thrillers, without any pretension to literary seriousness\". When reviewing Bulldog Drummond Strikes Back for The New York Times, the critic observed that \"if you like a good knock-down-and-drag-out yarn with excitement and violence on nearly every page, you can't go wrong on Bulldog Drummond\"; for the novel Bulldog Drummond at Bay, the reviewer considered that \"as a piece of fictional melodrama, the book is first rate\". In the British market, The Times Literary Supplement also characterised him as a mass-market thriller writer, which contrasted with its consideration of his earlier works.", "From the 1950s on, McNeile's work came to be viewed in the light of events of the Second World War, and journalists such as Richard Usborne highlighted aspects of the stories which he considered were \"carrying the F\u00fchrer-principle\". DelFattore agrees, and considers that the second Bulldog Drummond novel\u2014The Black Gang (1922)\u2014is when the fascist element was introduced. Jaillant notes that the accusations of fascism only came about after the Second World War, while the academic Ion Trewin considers that through the Drummond stories, McNeile was seen at the time as \"simply an upstanding Tory who spoke for many of his countrymen\"."]}, {"page": "John Howard (American actor)", "response": ["Howard played Bulldog Drummond in seven films which were produced by Paramount.

In his first performance as Drummond, Bulldog Drummond Comes Back (1937), Howard took second billing to John Barrymore who played Drummond's colleague.
