Gruen, The Last Generation of the Roman Republic (University of California 1974, 1995) at 498\u2013507. Gruen is not given to judge Caesar, but at 504 he concludes that the Republic might well have survived but for the severe damage wrought by the ferocious civil war fought between Pompey and Caesar.Cf., W. Warde Fowler, Roman essays and interpretations (Oxford Univ. 1920), \"Thomas Mommsen: His Life and Work\" 250\u2013268, at 259.W. P. Allen, \"Theodor Mommsen\" in the North Atlantic Review (1970) at 112: 445\u2013465, at 452: \"His lawyer's reverence for authority too often leads him to side with power and prerogative against impotent cravings after freedom.\" Of course, to the contrary, Mommsen the revolutionary of 1848 might have shaken his head to read this comment.Compare: William Shakespeare, The Tragedy of Julius Caesar [1599], in The Complete Plays and Poems of William Shakespeare, edited by Wm. A. Neilson and Chs. J. Hill (Cambridge MA: Houghton and Mifflin 1942) at 1012\u20131042. Shakespeare's play might yet influence how Caesar is regarded, although the above editors at 1011 comment: \"The character of Caesar is deliberately foreshortened in the play for dramatic purposes. Since Caesar must be assassinated, Shakespeare must stress those qualities in him which can justify the deed in the eyes of those who commit it and who must, temporarily, have the sympathy of the audience. Consequently, Caesar is presented without reference to the genuine springs of his greatness, emphasis being place upon his arrogance.\" To the contrary, the Republic's fall ushered in the oppressive Empire whose 'divine' rulers held absolute power. Julius Caesar as villain was an opinion shared, of course, by his knife-wielding assassins, most of whom were also nobility. Shared also without shame by that epitome of classical Roman politics and letters, Marcus Tullius Cicero (106\u201343).Cicero in his published writings refers to Caesar's assassins as \"the company who did that most glorius of deeds\". Cicero, Second Philippic against Anthony [October, 44 BCE]; in Cicero, Selected Works, edited by Michael Grant (Penguin Books 1962, 1971) at 102\u2013153, 113.Cicero in a private letter to his friend Atticus writes about one having \"feasted his eyes on the just death of a tyrant.\" Quoted by D. R. Shackleton Bailey in his Cicero (New York: Chs. Scribner's Sons 1971) at 228. Bailey at 227 remarks: \"[W]hen Brutus brandished the dagger he had just plunged into Caesar's body and shouted congratulations to Cicero by name, he knew he could count on a wholehearted response. Cicero saw the murder as a splendid feat of patriotic heroism, and the victim as a public enemy over whose fate all good citizens should rejoice and be glad.\"\"The murder of Caesar brought Cicero nothing but satisfaction.\" J.P.V.D. Balsdon, \"Cicero the Man\" in Dudley and Dorey, editors, Cicero (London: Routledge & Kegan Paul 1964) at 171\u2013214, 186. For some observers, following Caesar's assassination Cicero saved his rather erratic career in politics by his high-profile stand in favor of the Republic.H. H. Scullard, \"The Political Career of a 'Novus Homo'\", in Dudley and Dorey, editors, Cicero (London: Routledge & Kegan Paul 1964) at 1\u201325, 24. Scullar calls it \"the greatest period of his life\" with regard to Cicero's \"series of speeches, the Philippics.\" Also strong among Caesar's opponents was Marcus Porcius Cato Uticensis (95\u201346), who had long led the opimates, supporters of the republican aristocracy, against the populares and in particular against Julius Caesar. During the Imperial era the stoic Cato became the symbol of lost republican virtue.Erich S. Gruen, The Last Generation of the Roman Republic (University of California 1974, 1995) at 53\u201355.", "Nonetheless, even deadly foes could see the bright genius of Caesar; indeed, many conspitators were his beneficiaries.Cicero, Selected Letters, edited by D. R. Shackleton Bailey (Penguin Books [1965\u20131980], 1982) at 13 (Cicero), at 239 (C. Cassius Longinus), at 245\u2013246 (D.
