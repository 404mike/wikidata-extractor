She was the second daughter of the Duke and Duchess of Clarence, later King William IV and Queen Adelaide. Princess Elizabeth was a granddaughter of King George III.\nAfter having had one child who died on the day of her birth, Princess Charlotte (27 March 1819), and suffering a stillbirth, the third pregnancy of the Duchess of Clarence also did not go as expected. The Duchess delivered a girl, almost six weeks premature, on 10 December 1820 at St James's Palace. She was christened on the day of her birth at the Palace by William Howley, then Bishop of London.The Duke and Duchess of Clarence had wanted to name her Georgina, but King George IV  asked that she be named Elizabeth instead. The couple agreed and christened her \"Elizabeth Georgiana Adelaide\" (or Elizabeth-Georgiana-Adelaide).\nShe lived the remainder of her days at St James's Palace. After \"being suddenly seized with the fatal disease, an intro-susception of the bowels\" she died shortly thereafter, aged 12 weeks. After her death, her mother suffered a further stillbirth.\nElizabeth was buried at Windsor Castle, in St George's Chapel, on 10 March 1821. During her short life, she was ahead of her cousin, the future Queen Victoria, in the line of succession.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1821", "response": ["* March 4 \u2013 Princess Elizabeth of Clarence, daughter of William, Duke of Clarence (later King William IV) (b. 1820)"]}, {"page": "Queen Victoria", "response": ["At birth, Victoria was fifth in the line of succession after the four eldest sons of George\u00a0III: the Prince Regent (later George\u00a0IV); Frederick, Duke of York; William, Duke of Clarence (later William\u00a0IV); and Victoria's father, Edward, Duke of Kent.Longford, p. 24 The Prince Regent had no surviving children, and the Duke of York had no children; further, both were estranged from their wives, who were both past child-bearing age, so the two eldest brothers were unlikely to have any further legitimate children. William and Edward married on the same day in 1818, but both of William's legitimate daughters died as infants. The first of these was Princess Charlotte, who was born and died on 27 March 1819, two months before Victoria was born. Victoria's father died in January 1820, when Victoria was less than a year old. A week later her grandfather died and was succeeded by his eldest son as George\u00a0IV. Victoria was then third in line to the throne after Frederick and William.
