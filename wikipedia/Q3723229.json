She was the second daughter of the Duke and Duchess of Clarence, later King William IV and Queen Adelaide. Princess Elizabeth was a granddaughter of King George III.\nAfter having had one child who died on the day of her birth, Princess Charlotte (27 March 1819), and suffering a stillbirth, the third pregnancy of the Duchess of Clarence also did not go as expected. The Duchess delivered a girl, almost six weeks premature, on 10 December 1820 at St James's Palace. She was christened on the day of her birth at the Palace by William Howley, then Bishop of London.The Duke and Duchess of Clarence had wanted to name her Georgina, but King George IV  asked that she be named Elizabeth instead. The couple agreed and christened her \"Elizabeth Georgiana Adelaide\" (or Elizabeth-Georgiana-Adelaide).\nShe lived the remainder of her days at St James's Palace. After \"being suddenly seized with the fatal disease, an intro-susception of the bowels\" she died shortly thereafter, aged 12 weeks. After her death, her mother suffered three more stillbirths.\nElizabeth was buried at Windsor Castle, in St George's Chapel, on 10 March 1821. During her short life, she was ahead of her cousin, the future Queen Victoria, in the line of succession.", "link_mentions": {}}}
