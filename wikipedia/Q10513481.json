After 39 goals in 95 Watford games, he joined QPR on a free transfer in 1930, and moved to Coventry City the following year.Sheppard joined Walsall in January 1933, and one of his first games for the club was an FA Cup Third Round tie against Arsenal at Fellows Park, in front of 11,150 spectators. At the time Arsenal were competing for the First Division title, which they eventually won. Walsall were in the Third Division North. Sheppard played the game at inside right. After a goalless first half, Walsall centre-forward Gilbert Alsop scored the opening goal with a header in the second half. Five minutes later Alsop won a penalty kick, which Sheppard converted to double the team's lead. Arsenal were unable to overturn the deficit; Walsall won the match 2\u20130.He remained at Walsall until the end of the 1933\u201334 season. He briefly joined Chester, but returned to Walsall in October of that year, before leaving permanently in June 1935.

He forged a strong link between Coventry and Walsall, and took Bill Coward, Chris Ball, Bill Sheppard and Freddie Lee from Highfield Road to Fellows Park. The club's kit was also changed to a blue and white strip for an historic match against an all-conquering First Division Arsenal in the FA Cup in January 1933; the \"Saddlers\" achieved a famous 2\u20130 victory, and Slade's entire front line that day had previously played for Coventry. It was reported that the Arsenal paid more for their player's boots than Slade did for his entire team. The match is described by the Walsall F.C. website as \"one of the most significant days in our history\". The club finished fifth in the Third Division North in 1932\u201333, and fourth in 1933\u201334, however Slade was sacked after a poor start to 1934\u201335.
