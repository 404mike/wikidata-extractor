By 1969, he was the newspaper's New York editor, and was the first British journalist to interview the Apollo 11 astronauts.He later became consultant editor of the London Evening News, before in 1985 returning to the Daily Express. In 1986, he became editor of the Sunday Express, a post he held until 1989.
