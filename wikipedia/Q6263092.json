He was educated in Bury St Edmunds and at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, graduating BA in 1751.In 1773 he was vicar of the Parish Church of St Peter and St Paul, Wisbech.\nBefore his promotion to bishop, Warren was Archdeacon of Worcester.  During the bishop's time at Bangor, he was involved in two major controversies. In October 1793, he became involved in a dispute with the Parys and Mona Mine companies over the demolition and rebuilding of Amlwch parish church. The bishop claimed that the mining companies had promised to rebuild the church; they denied this, but eventually agreed to make a financial contribution.In 1796 the bishop was involved in another dispute, which resulted in a court case.  Warren had appointed his own nephew Registrar of the diocese of Bangor, even though the latter was under age. When the bishop attempted to sack the Deputy Registrar, Samuel Grindley, Grindley refused to leave his office, and a tussle ensued in which the bishop was threatened with a pistol and had to be dragged away by his wife.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Warren", "response": ["John Warren may refer to:", "* John Warren (surgeon) (1753\u20131815), American surgeon during the Revolutionary War", "* John Warren (1874-1928) (1874\u20131928), professor of anatomy at Harvard University", "* John Warren (Dover MP) (died 1547), MP for Dover (UK Parliament constituency)", "* John Warren (Upper Canada politician) (died 1832), merchant and politician in Upper Canada", "* John Warren (Australian politician) (1830\u20131914), Australian pastoralist and politician", "* John Warren (trade unionist) (1895\u20131960), British trade unionist", "* John Warren (South African cricketer) (1873\u20131900), South African cricketer", "* John Warren (basketball) (born 1947), NBA", "* John Warren (American football) (born 1960), punter in the NFL for the Dallas Cowboys", "* John Warren (born 1960), racing manager of Queen Elizabeth's horses", "* John Warren (Indian cricketer), played for Bengal", "*John Warren (actor) (1916-1977), British support actor and comedy scriptwriter in film and TV", "* John Warren (bishop) (1730\u20131800), Archdeacon of Worcester, Bishop of Saint David's, Wales, Bishop of Bangor, Wales", "* Jean Baptiste Fran\u00e7ois Joseph de Warren (1769\u20131830), who went by the name of John Warren, surveyor and astronomer in the English East India Company", "* John Warren (mathematician) (1796\u20131852), English mathematician and Fellow of the Royal Society", "* John Warren (British Army soldier) (died 1813), soldier, official and merchant in Upper Canada", "* John Warren (convict) (1826\u20131898), convict transported to Western Australia", "* John Warren, 3rd Baron de Tabley (1835\u20131895), English poet, numismatist, botanist and authority on bookplates", "* John Warren (journalist) (born 1937), anchored CBC Parliamentary Television Network", "* John Warren (Canadian musician) (born 1938), Canadian baritone saxophonist and composer", "* John Warren (priest) (1767\u20131838),  Dean of Bangor", "* John Warren (actor), British screenwriter and actor, wrote Two-Way Stretch", "* John Warren (mining) \"Captain Warren\" (1837\u20131910), mining engineer and mine manager in Australia"]}, {"page": "Bishop of Bangor", "response": ["| 60px John Warren"]}, {"page": "Grey Coat Hospital", "response": ["In the first two centuries of its history, Grey Coat Hospital School's charity has had many distinguished benefactors and subscribers, including Lord Hardwicke, Lord Robert Henley (afterwards Earl of Northington), George Granville (afterwards Marquis of Buckingham), the philosopher Jeremy Bentham, Henry Pelham-Clinton and his wife Lady Susan, the Earl and Countess of Lincoln (afterwards Duke and Duchess of Newcastle), Mr. Stephen Hoare, Dr. Richard Jebb (later Sir), the Earl Richard Temple (Duke of Buckingham and Chandos), The Lord Chief Justice Sir John Pratt (afterwards Marquis Camden), Lord Edward Thurlow, 1st Baron Thurlow, Henry Bathurst (Lord Aspley), Robert Grosvenor (Viscount Belgrave, afterwards Earl Grosvenor, Mr. Speaker Henry Addington (afterwards Viscount Sidmouth), Lord Bathurst, Mr. Speaker Charles Abbott (afterwards Lord Colchester), Spencer Perceval M.P.
