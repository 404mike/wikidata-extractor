He scored four goals during a 6\u20131 demolition of Swansea Town on 24 January, and in doing so scored his first hat-trick for the club. He finished the campaign as Luton's top scorer, with 18 goals from 33 matches. Injuries ruled him out for the majority of 1923\u201324 as well as the first three months of 1924\u201325 \u2014 however, he still finished as the club's joint top scorer with 12 in 26 games. 1925\u201326 saw only fleeting appearances from Reid, but by 1926\u201327 he was back as he top scored once again with 21 goals. A haul of 19 during 1927\u201328 proved to be a last hurrah \u2014 Luton now had two prolific goalscorers in Andy Rennie and Jimmy Yardley, and decided to let the injury-prone Reid go. After 81 goals in only 143 professional matches, Reid ended his playing days with Luton Amateurs."]}, {"page": "South London derby", "response": ["* Jimmy Yardley"]}, {"page": "List of Millwall F.C. seasons", "response": ["|colspan=1 rowspan=2|Jimmy Yardley"]}]}}
