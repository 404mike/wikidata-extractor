Wardroper, Lovers, Rakes and Rogues, Amatory, Merry and Bawdy Verse from 1580 to 1830 (London: Shelfmark,  1995), p. 9. Many collectors in the first revival either ignored such songs, or bowdlerized them for publication, as Francis Child and Cecil Sharp did in their collections.M. Shiach, Discourse on Popular Culture: Class, Gender, and History in Cultural Analysis, 1730 to the Present, (Stanford CA: Stanford University Press, 1989), p. 122 and 129. In the second revival, erotic folk song was much more accepted as part of the canon of traditional song, helped by the publication of books such as Gershon Legman's, The Horn Book: Studies in Erotic Folklore (1964) and Ed Cray's, The Erotic Muse: American Bawdy Songs, which printed many previously unpublished songs (1968).E. Cray, The Erotic Muse: American Bawdy Songs (Champaign, IL: University of Illinois Press, 1968) and G. Legman, The Horn Book: Studies in Erotic Folklore and Bibliography (New York: University Books, 1964). In England A. L. Lloyd was the key figure in introducing erotic songs to the canon, lecturing and publishing on the subject. He recorded The Foggy Dew and Other Traditional English Love Songs in 1959, and then The Bird in the Bush, Traditional Erotic Songs in 1966 with Frankie Armstrong, and Anne Briggs.B. Sweers, Electric Folk: The Changing Face of English Traditional Music (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), p. 216. He drew a distinction between erotic songs, i.e. those that dealt with love and suggested sexuality through innuendo (like 'The Bonny Black Hare' and 'The Bird in the Bush'), and pornographic songs that were explicit and therefore unworthy of attention.R. Pegg, Folk (Wildwood House: London, 1976), p. 76. Some authors, however, find these distinctions more difficult to maintain. Although erotic songs became part of the standard fare in folk clubs and among folk rock musicians, relatively few of the more explicit songs have been placed on record.G. Legman, 'Erotic folk songs and international bibliography' , Journal of American Folklore (1990), 16/02/09.", "Due to its lack of clear boundaries and a perceived lack of identity in its folk music, the English Midlands attracted relatively little interest in the early revivals. However, in more recent years a distinct cultural heritage has been recognised including unique folk traditions and songs, many associated with the regions industrial connections. It has also produced a number of important performers and some particular local instruments, such as the Lincolnshire bagpipes, however the last player, John Hunsley, died in the 19th century and no actual examples of the pipes have survived.The Pipers' Gathering, http://www.pipersgathering.org/PB2004.shtml, retrieved 16/02/09. From the 19th century the instruments used appear to have been much like those in other regions, with fiddles, accordions and eventually silver and brass. Although, some traditions, like Molly dance died out in the 1930s, the Midlands retained strong traditions of both ceremonial and social dance, particularly in the south Midlands and Cotswolds and in the distinctive Border Morris from Herefordshire, Worcestershire and Shropshire. The region also furnished some important material for folk songs, including a claim by Nottinghamshire for one of the most popular series of ballads, that of Robin Hood, while local places appear in songs such as \u2018The Leicester Chambermaid\u2019 and \u2018Oxford\u2019 or \u2018Worcester City\u2019.R. B. Dobson and J. Taylor, Rymes of Robyn Hood, An Introduction to the English Outlaw (London: Book Club Associates, 1976), p. 14. Folk song collecting in the first revival was much less comprehensive than for many other regions. In the 1860s Llewellynn Jewitt, collected songs from Derbyshire, and some songs were printed by Georgina F. Jackson in her study of Shropshire folk lore.L. Jewitt, The Ballads & Songs of Derbyshire, with Illustrative Notes, and Examples of the Original Music, etc. (London, 1867); C. S. Burne, ed., Shropshire Folk-Lore: A Sheaf of Gleanings, from the Collections of Georgina F. Jackson, rpt. in 2 parts (Wakefield: EP Publishing, 1973\u20134). Cecil Sharp's interest in the region was largely confined to the south, particularly the Cotswold morris villages of Oxfordshire and Warwickshire, which provided him with an archetype of English ceremonial dance. From 1905, Percy Grainger was actively collecting in Lincolnshire, acquiring recordings of songs that would provide the basis for his Lincolnshire Posy (1937).P. O'Shaughnessy, ed. Twenty-One Lincolnshire Folk-Songs from the Manuscript Collection of Percy Grainger (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1968). It was not until the early 1970s that the broader heritage of the region, including the many industrial and work songs associated with mining or The Potteries, began to gain serious attention.R. Palmer, ed., Songs of the Midlands (Wakefield: EP Publishing, 1972); M. Raven, ed., The Jolly Machine: Songs of Industrial Protest and Social Discontent from the West Midlands (Stafford Spanish Guitar Centre, 1974); R. Palmer, ed., Birmingham Ballads: Facsimile Street Ballads (City of Birmingham Education Department, 1979). Despite this neglect there was an active folk scene in the region, which produced several key artists of the second revival from the 1960s, including Anne Briggs from Nottinghamshire, The Settlers from the West Midlands and from Birmingham one of the most influential groups of the period, the Ian Campbell Folk Group, which numbered among its members later British folk rock musicians Dave Swarbrick and Dave Pegg. Slightly later a number of folk groups came out of Derbyshire, including The Druids, Ram's Bottom Band and Muckram Wakes, which included one of the most highly regarded modern performers John Tams. Lincolnshire has produced Martin Simpson, perhaps the most highly regarded folk guitarist of his generation.Salut Live! http://www.salutlive.com/2007/07/martin-simpson-.html, retrieved 16/02/09.
