A child who picked bluebells alone could be spirited away (mastered) by the fairy folk.  Even an adult who ventured into a bluebell wood by themselves was in danger of being led  by pixies to wander round and round, unable to find their way out. This folklore may originate in the poisonous nature of the bluebell bulb which can kill if eaten.  The  children\u2019s author, Beatrix Potter, made  use of these old superstitions in her only full-length novel for older children, The Fairy Caravan (1929).  "]}, {"page": "An Almond for a Parrot", "response": ["*Ani Johnson in www.thebookbag.co.uk also praises the novel \"Tully has a lot going on in her life and a shadow of great menace and danger lurking over it. She is growing while we watch, learning about human nature and her own background as much as, if not more than, her profession. Sally/Wray also provides a window on the plight of women and the politics tied up with the choice or necessity to go into prostitution. The residents of the Fairy House may have started out avoiding poverty but they come over as being in a very fortunate position compared to those out on the street or in a similar line of work but without the House's protection or scruples. Indeed, the ethos and realities within their world make fascinating reading. In some ways this book could be the literary love child of Sarah Waters and John Cleland (author of Fanny Hill) with the subtle fantasy dash of Karen Maitland yet it also feels fresh and original. This means that Wray Delaney has written a debut adult story that will generate discussing as well as entertainment, and that's not a bad thing at all.\"It's been compared with Fanny Hill but we think it's subtler and better Retrieved 10/9/21."]}]}}
