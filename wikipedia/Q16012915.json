As a youth he played for a local youth team, the 6th Northampton company of the Boys Brigade based in Kingsley. Don was introduced to the Cobblers one day when attending an injury clinic and got talking to Jack Jennings who had Tommy Mulgrew under treatment at the time. Don explained that he was on amateur forms with Chelsea, so it was suggested that he went along to the cobblers for a trial when he was fit again. From this opportunity he progressed through the A team and reserves (who used to draw 6000 crowds back in those days) to eventually play his first game for the club as a professional against Plymouth Argyle. He made 23 appearances, scoring 7 goals. \nDon played for the cobblers from 1951 to 1956 and went on to play for Bedford town and Rushden town.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Don Adams (disambiguation)", "response": ["Don Adams (1923\u20132005) was an American actor.", "Don Adams may also refer to:", "*Don Adams (country singer) 1960s, American country singer", "*Don Adams (R&B singer) (1942\u20131995), Munich based Scottish singer", "*Don Adams (rugby league), Australian rugby league footballer for Scone Thoroughbreds", "*Don Adams (boxer), British bare-knuckle boxer", "*Don Adams (basketball) (1947\u20132013), American basketball player", "*Don Adams (footballer) (1931\u20131993), English footballer", "*Don Adams (politician), Texas politician and legislator"]}, {"page": "1952\u201353 Northampton Town F.C. season", "response": ["|Don Adams||IF||||Northampton||||9||4||Apprentice||Summer 1951||N/A", "| IF || style=\"text-align:left;\" |  Don Adams"]}]}}
