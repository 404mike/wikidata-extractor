Every year boys are admitted in only two-year groups: seventh grade (D-Form) in January and eighth grade (C-Form) in April. As of May 2019, boys from 26 Indian states as well as 35 non-resident Indians and foreign nationals were studying at Doon.https://www.doonschool.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/updated-doon-school-presentation.pdf The school is fully residential, and boys and most teachers live on campus. In tenth grade, students take the Cambridge IGCSE examinations, and for the final two years can choose between the Indian School Certificate or International Baccalaureate. A broad range of extra-curricular activities, numbering around 80, are offered to the boys, and early masters such as R.L. Holdsworth, J.A.K. Martyn, Jack Gibson and Gurdial Singh established a strong tradition of mountaineering at school. The school occupies the former site of the Forest Research Institute and is home to diverse flora and fauna. Doon remains a boys-only school despite continued pressure from political leaders to become coeducational. Old boys of the school are known as 'Doscos'.", "Foot had never visited India before accepting the position of headmaster. He noted that the school appeared to be surrounded by forests and close to mountains, and the possibilities of outdoor recreation and mountaineering seem to have influenced his decision as much as the chance to create a completely new type of school in India. Foot's first action upon being offered the position was to recruit J.A.K. (John) Martyn from Harrow School as his deputy. Although Martyn had not visited India before, he took up the offer because of the opportunity it afforded him to implement the ideas of German educator Kurt Hahn at Doon; it was something he had not been able to do at Harrow. Quote: When John wrote to Hahn to tell him we was going to India, Hahn replied that he had been waiting to be able to offer him a place at Gordonstoun... Quote: The India I Love, J.A.K. Martyn - I do not think I would ever have come to India if it had not been for that remarkable German Jew, Kurt Hahn...I longed to put his ideas into practice but at conservative Harrow I had no opportunity to do so. When I read in The Times that A.E. Foot of Eton had been appointed headmaster of a new public school to be opened for Indian boys in Dehra Dun, I offered to come with him and my offer was accepted. Doon's ethos and guiding principles were determined early in its life by Foot, Martyn, R.L. Holdsworth and Jack Gibson, who went on to become principal of Mayo College, and Martyn acknowledged the influence of Hahn's ideas in the development of the school's ethos. They were soon joined in their efforts by Indians such as the artist Sudhir Khastgir (the school's first art teacher, who had trained previously in Santiniketan) and Gurdial Singh, a noted mountaineer who taught at Doon for several decades. In an essay entitled The Objects of Education published in the school magazine, Foot offered a template for a complete education for boys, which included teaching them to form a habit of choosing good over evil, think logically, express their thoughts and views clearly, and maintain a healthy body. At the opening of the school, he said, \"Our boys should leave The Doon School as members of an aristocracy, but it must be an aristocracy of service inspired by the ideals of unselfishness, not one of privilege, wealth or position\".The Doon School Sixty Years On, 1936, p.4 The annual school fees in 1935 was 1,375, and by September 1946, it had risen to 1,800. The per-capita income of India, then largely an agricultural society, in 1947 has been recorded as 252.http://www.roiw.org/1969/247.pdf ", "Halfway through each term, the boys go on a one-week \"midterm\", an expedition through the Siwalik Hills or Himalayas. Senior boys make treks of up to five days, unaccompanied by teachers, camping out in tents and cooking their own food. The trips are planned by students themselves. Alumni have recalled these midterms as formative and character-building experiences. Doon has been credited with pioneering mountaineering in India, due to the accomplishments of masters such as R.L. Holdsworth, Jack Gibson and Gurdial Singh, and alumni like Nandu Jayal, who later became the founder principal of Himalayan Mountaineering Institute. Notable climbs by staff and alumni include Bandarpunch (6,316\u00a0m) in 1950, Kala Nag (6,387\u00a0m) in 1956, Trisul (7,120\u00a0m) in 1951, Kamet (7,756\u00a0m) in 1955, Abi Gamin (7,355\u00a0m) in 1953 and 1955, Mrigthuni (6,855\u00a0m) in 1958 and Jaonli (6,632 metres) in 1964. Some of these expeditions have been noted for their idiosyncrasies. After Gurdial Singh led a successful climb of Trisul, he performed a headstand asana on the summit as a tribute to the Hindu god Shiva, who is said to abide there. Holdsworth smoked a pipe on reaching the summit of Kamet (7,756\u00a0m), during its first ascent in 1931. Two Doon pupils climbed the Matterhorn in 1951 wearing cricket boots.", "An amphitheatre known as the Rose Bowl was built largely by pupils and masters in two years during the 1930s Quote: It took two years to complete the open air theatre. The first play staged on it was \"The Merchant of Venice produced by Jack Gibson, and he had all his actors dressed in Indian costumes. and underwent a major structural change in 2009. It can seat up to 2,000 people and has been the setting for numerous plays as well as musical performances and speeches during school ceremonies such as Founder's Day. The Multi-Purpose Hall is a more modern indoor theatre that can accommodate approximately 2,000 people. Plays are regularly staged in English and Hindi, with 8\u20139 productions each year including 2 major productions, which usually have a larger cast and budget, as part of the Founder's Day celebrations. The Inter House Once-Act Play competition is held each year, alternatively in English and Hindi. The stage design, sound design, stage lighting, and much of the set construction are the responsibility of the pupils.", "* In Tenzing Norgay's autobiography Man of Everest, he refers to Bandarpunch as \"The Doon School mountain\" as the mountain was frequented by two Doon School teachers, Jack Gibson and John Martyn.", "In the early years, many teachers came from British schools, including Peter Lawrence from Eton College, Jack Gibson from Ripon Grammar School, John A. K. Martyn and R. L. Holdsworth from Harrow. The school's first art teacher was the artist Sudhir Khastgir, from Shantiniketan, who joined in 1936 and remained at school for twenty years. Many sculptures and murals on the campus today were created by him. The film director Chetan Anand taught briefly at the school from 1940 to 1944. Mountaineer Gurdial Singh joined in 1946 as a geography teacher and led the boys on many expeditions. The cricketer and mathematics teacher, Sheel Vohra, joined in 1959 and became the longest-serving master in school's history when he retired in 1998. The Fiji-Indian academic Satendra Nandan taught history at school in the early 1960s, and the sarod player Ashok Roy headed the music department from 1977 to 1988. Popular science author and theoretical physicist, Simon Singh, taught science at Doon in 1987 before embarking on his academic and writing career."]}, {"page": "Jack Gibson", "response": ["Jack Gibson may refer to:", "* Jack Gibson (rugby league) (1929\u20132008), Australian player and coach", "* Jack Gibson (ice hockey, born 1880) (1880\u20131955), ice hockey player and executive", "* Jack Gibson (ice hockey, born 1948), ice hockey player", "* Jack Gibson, musician with American band Exodus", "* Jack Gibson (schoolmaster) (1908\u20131994), English schoolmaster, scholar, academic and British Himalayan mountaineer"]}, {"page": "Kalanag", "response": ["Kalanag or Black Peak (6,387\u00a0m) is the highest peak in the Saraswati (Bandarpunch) mountain range, others being Saraswati Devi Parvat (Bandarpunch I, 6,316\u00a0m) and Hanuman Parvat (White Peak or Bandarpunch II, 6,102\u00a0m).

In 1947, when the British left, people thought that mountaineering and the club will not hold up in India.
