He is known for his work in the area of group theory.  Both Young diagrams and Young tableaux (which he introduced in 1900) are named after him.\nYoung was appointed to the position of lecturer at Selwyn College, Cambridge, in 1901, transferring to Clare College in 1905. In 1902 he collaborated with John Hilton Grace on the book The Algebra of Invariants.\nIn 1907 he married Edith Clara n\u00e9e Wilson. In 1908 he became an ordained clergyman, and in 1910 became parish priest at Birdbrook in Essex, a village 25 miles east of Cambridge. He lived there for the rest of his life, but in 1926 began lecturing once again at Cambridge.\nMost of his long series of papers on invariant theory and the symmetric group were written while he was a clergyman.\n\nYoung's ideas have had a significant impact on: (1) group representation theory, (2) combinatorics and statistics, (3) invariant theory, (4) physics and (5) chemistry. These topics intertwine sufficiently that a single result may have implications in more than one area.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Partition (number theory)", "response": ["There are two common diagrammatic methods to represent partitions: as Ferrers diagrams, named after Norman Macleod Ferrers, and as Young diagrams, named after the British mathematician Alfred Young.

As was already known in ancient India, the number of sequences with a given rank is a Fibonacci number. The Young\u2013Fibonacci lattice is an infinite modular lattice having these digit sequences as its elements, compatible with this rank structure.

He became an assistant lecturer at the University of Edinburgh and then an assistant lecturer at the University of St Andrews, where he in 1934 was promoted to \"Lecturer in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics\" and given the task of building up the department in applied mathematics. At St Andrews, he received in 1949 a D.Sc. and then became in 1952 a reader and in 1964 a professor in the Gregory Chair of Applied Mathematics. His research specialty was algebra and in particular the representation theory of symmetric groups. His most famous book, Substitutional Analysis (1948), presents his research on the Young tableaux of Alfred Young. Rutherford published some research on numerical methods in fluid dynamics.
