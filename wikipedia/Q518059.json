The situation has been compared to the Realization/Biographie versus Alexander Huber's Open Air debate on the world's first .  In fact, Huber attributes the initial conservative  grading of Action Directe that persisted for many years, despite it being eventually shown to be a \"hard 9a\", for artificially suppressing the grades of other extreme routes in the 1990s, such as Huber's La Rambla, and Weisse Rose."]}, {"page": "Johnny Dawes", "response": ["Dawes' main climbing career roughly splits into an initial period pre-1986 where he focused on gritstone in the Peak District, which was suited to his unique climbing style (e.g. Gaia, and End of the Affair).
