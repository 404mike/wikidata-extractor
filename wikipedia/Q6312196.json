Her skills in electron microscopy earned her an international reputation.In 1964, she was recruited by St Thomas's Hospital Medical School in London. By 1967, she had earned her Doctor of Science (Sc.D.) on the basis of her research and the resulting publications, while working in Canada, at Toronto's Ontario Cancer Institute and then in London at St Thomas's. she then continued her research at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School (RPGMS), which later became part of the Imperial College School of Medicine.\nAlmeida succeeded in identifying viruses that were previously unknown, including\u2014in 1966\u2014a group of viruses that was later named coronavirus,:\u200a96\u200a due to their crown-like appearance. Her immune electron microscopy (IEM) innovations and insights contributed to research related to the diagnosis of hepatitis B, HIV, and rubella, among other viral diseases. Her electron micrographs continue to be included in virology review textbooks, decades after she produced them.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Rubella", "response": ["In 1967, the molecular structure of rubella was observed under electron microscopy using antigen-antibody complexes by Jennifer M.

The name was coined by June Almeida and David Tyrrell who first observed and studied human coronaviruses. The word was first used in print in 1968 by an informal group of virologists in the journal Nature to designate the new family of viruses. The name refers to the characteristic appearance of virions (the infective form of the virus) by electron microscopy, which have a fringe of large, bulbous surface projections creating an image reminiscent of the solar corona or halo. This morphology is created by the viral spike peplomers, which are proteins on the surface of the virus.", "Scottish virologist June Almeida at St Thomas' Hospital in London, collaborating with Tyrrell, compared the structures of IBV, B814 and 229E in 1967. Using electron microscopy the three viruses were shown to be morphologically related by their general shape and distinctive club-like spikes. A research group at the National Institute of Health the same year was able to isolate another member of this new group of viruses using organ culture and named one of the samples OC43 (OC for organ culture). Like B814, 229E, and IBV, the novel cold virus OC43 had distinctive club-like spikes when observed with the electron microscope."]}, {"page": "Common Cold Unit", "response": ["The first coronavirus (B814) was found in washes from a boy with a typical common cold symptoms in 1960 during the study led by virologist David Tyrrell at the Common Cold Unit.
