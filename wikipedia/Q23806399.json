He played twice at outside right at the start of the 1936\u201337 season, but did not get a chance in his proper position until mid-November, when he took over at left back from the injured Don Ashman and kept his place to the end of the season. He scored what proved to be his only Football League goal to open the scoring in a 2\u20131 win against Accrington Stanley in November with a penaltyhe missed one against Chester a couple of weeks later. He helped Darlington reach the final of the 1936\u201337 Third Division North Cup, which they lost 2\u20131 to Chester, and in March 1936, he was reported as being watched by an unnamed Lancashire-based First Division club. Allan kept his place until March 1937, when a succession of defeats prompted major changes to the eleven. He appeared once more after being dropped, taking his appearances for Darlington in this second spell to 77 in all competitions, and was released on a free transfer at the end of the season."]}]}}
