Rigby was a suffragette recruiter, gathering new members from among the local Independent Labour Party, including Eleanor Higginson, who became a lifelong friend. Rigby took part in a march to the Houses of Parliament in London with Christabel and Sylvia Pankhurst in 1908. Fifty-seven women, including Rigby, were arrested and sentenced to a month in prison. During this time (and her subsequent sentences, seven in total) Rigby took part in hunger strikes and was subjected to force-feeding. Her activism included planting a bomb in the Liverpool Corn Exchange on 5 July 1913, and although it was later stated in court that \u2018no great damage had been done by the explosion\u2019, Mrs Rigby was found guilty and sentenced to nine months' imprisonment with hard labour.Mrs Rigby committed to trial, The Times, 18 July 1913, page 14, column c.\u2018The Explosion At Liverpool Exchange\u2019, The Times, 31 July 1913, p. 8."]}]}}
