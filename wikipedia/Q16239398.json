His ruthless business sense combined with the technical breakthroughs of Wedgwood and Spode, and made his firm a formidable force in the growing export trade from the Potteries.\nHe married Diana Ward in 1795 and they had two daughters and three sons. Davenport resided at Westwood Hall from 1813, and the running of his business began to pass to his son Henry in the 1820s. This left Davenport time to become involved in politics.
