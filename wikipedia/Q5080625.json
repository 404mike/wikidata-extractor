Gwynne left for South Australia, arriving in Adelaide aboard the Lord Goderich on 15 April 1838. His appointment as clerk of court was not confirmed and Gwynne immediately applied for admission to the bar and practised as a barrister. In 1840 he entered into partnership with William Bartley, and later was joined by Charles Mann. Gwynne established a reputation as a lawyer, especially for his knowledge of equity law and the law of property. In 1851 he was nominated to the South Australian Legislative Council, and soon afterwards brought in a bill to establish state aid to religion, which was however defeated. In 1853, during the discussion of the proposed new constitution, he spoke in favour of a nominee upper house, but it was eventually decided that the house should be an elected one with a property qualification for voters. Gwynne was defeated at the election for the council for the seat of East Torrens in 1854, but was elected unopposed to the new Legislative Council in 1857. Gwynne opposed the Robert Torrens real property bill, being afraid that it would have dangerous consequences. Though his opposition was not successful his criticisms had the effect of improving the bill. He was Attorney-General of South Australia in the John Baker ministry which lasted for only 10 days in August 1857, and in 1859 was appointed third judge of the South Australian Supreme Court. In 1867 he became second judge and primary judge in equity. From December 1872 to June 1873 he was acting chief justice, and in February 1877 received extended leave of absence to visit England.
