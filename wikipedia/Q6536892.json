The Robins gained a 2\u20130 halftime advantage when Lloyd Owusu earned and converted a penalty kick, getting it past the fingertips of Crossley. The Latics got a goal back when Chris Taylor's free kick was deflected by Cheltenham goalkeeper Shane Higgs, with the rebound falling immediately back to Taylor. In the 76th minute, Danny Whitaker equalised the game at 2\u20132 when a deflected shot crept into the corner of the net. A late robins shot from substitute Damian Spencer hit the post at the end of the match, but Oldham held on for a draw\u2014forcing a replay at Boundary Park.

Despite 17 shots to Cheltenham's three, Oldham could not muster a goal against Scott Brown. Shortly before the halftime break, Oldham was dealt a blow when Deane Smalley picked up an injury\u2014giving Matthew Wolfenden his first senior appearance of the season.
