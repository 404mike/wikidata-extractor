Due to the band being newly formed and having performed few shows, they were not set to appear until the other bands petitioned the producers of the show to add The Stands to the program, which they did and the band performed All Years Leaving, with Russell Pritchard filling in on bass. Having watched the band perform, local musician Dean Ravera asked to join the band after the show. He joined the band a week later and the band were shortly after invited to support The Coral on their imminent autumn UK tour. During the tour, Payne received a phone call from Noel Gallagher who had been given a copy of the Parr St demos by Martyn Campbell at the Oasis show at Old Trafford Cricket Ground, where Campbell was playing with support act Richard Ashcroft. Gallagher invited the band to support Oasis at their upcoming show in Liverpool at the Royal Court in December 2002, and were subsequently asked to support Oasis again for two nights at the NIA in Birmingham. In early 2003 and still unsigned without management, the band supported the likes of The Burn, Alfie, Stephen Fretwell, The Zutons and further shows with The Coral. The band were also invited to play Glastonbury, V Festival, T in the park and two further shows with Oasis at the Point Theatre in Dublin."]}, {"page": "List of music artists and bands from Manchester", "response": ["*Stephen Fretwell"]}, {"page": "Manchester v Cancer", "response": ["* Stephen Fretwell"]}, {"page": "Fiction Records", "response": ["Fiction has also released records by The Naked And Famous, Kate Nash, Athlete, Elbow, White Lies, Yuksek, Stephen Fretwell, Ian Brown, Jacknife Lee, Delays, Alberta Cross, Guillemots and Yeah Yeah Yeahs."]}, {"page": "Zebra Lounge", "response": ["*Stephen Fretwell - Paul McGrew"]}, {"page": "Magpie (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Magpie, an album by Stephen Fretwell"]}, {"page": "Tartan Heart Festival", "response": ["*Stephen Fretwell"]}, {"page": "BBC Radio 2 Electric Proms", "response": ["Liverpool: The Last Shadow Puppets; Stephen Fretwell; BBC Merseyside event with Steve Lamacq"]}, {"page": "Love + Hate (2005 film)", "response": ["*Play, Stephen Fretwell."]}, {"page": "List of performances on Top of the Pops", "response": ["* Stephen Fretwell \u2013 \"New York\""]}, {"page": "Emily", "response": ["* \"Emily\", song by Stephen Fretwell, on The Acoustic Album"]}, {"page": "Connect Music Festival", "response": ["*Stephen Fretwell"]}, {"page": "Oxegen 2005", "response": ["* Stephen Fretwell"]}, {"page": "The Edge Festival", "response": ["| Stephen FretwellEvan Crichton"]}, {"page": "Simple Twist of Fate", "response": ["\"Simple Twist of Fate\" has been covered and reinterpreted by several artists: first covered by Joan Baez on Diamonds & Rust (1975); by the Jerry Garcia Band on their 2-disc live album Jerry Garcia Band (1991) and on Run for the Roses (1982) (bonus track on 2004 rerelease); by Concrete Blonde on their Still in Hollywood (1994) collection; by Sean Costello on his self-titled album (2005); by The Format on Listen to Bob Dylan: A Tribute (2005); by Bryan Ferry on Dylanesque (2007); by Jeff Tweedy (with altered lyrics taken from a live Dylan performance) on the soundtrack for the film I'm Not There (2007); by Stephen Fretwell on Man On the Roof (2007) as a bonus track; by Sarah Jarosz on Build Me Up From Bones (2013); by Diana Krall on the 2012 charity tribute to Dylan Chimes of Freedom: Songs of Bob Dylan Honoring 50 Years of Amnesty International; and by Emma Swift on her 2020 album Blonde on the Tracks."]}, {"page": "Simone White", "response": ["White has toured in the United Kingdom, Europe and Japan headlining and supporting various bands: Nouvelle Vague, Alela Diane, Teitur, Stephen Fretwell, Little Dragon, Victoria Williams and Shugo Tokumaru.
