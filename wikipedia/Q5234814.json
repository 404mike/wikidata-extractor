After being introduced to Japanese through codebreaking during the Second World War, Hawkes studied Chinese and Japanese at Oxford University between 1945 and 1947 before studying at Peking University from 1948 to 1951. He then returned to Oxford, where he completed his D.Phil. and later became Shaw Professor of Chinese.  In 1971, Hawkes resigned his position to focus entirely on his translation of the famous Chinese novel The Story of the Stone (also known as Dream of the Red Chamber), which was published in three volumes between 1973 and 1980.  He retired in 1984 to rural Wales before returning to Oxford in his final years.\nHawkes was known for his translations that preserved the \"realism and poetry\" of the original Chinese, and was the foremost non-Chinese Redology expert.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Empson", "response": ["Just after the war Empson returned to China.

As David Hawkes puts it, \"[t]he Chu Ci poems, however popular, belonged to no canon, dealt in matters that were outlandish and unorthodox, and originated outside of the area of sanctified Western Zhou tradition.\"Hawkes (1985 [2011]), 26 However, part of the Chu Ci tradition includes a Confucian outlook, glorifying the loyal minister who prefers death over compromising his integrity. Following its Han Dynasty publication, the Chu Ci was subject to various editorial treatment, including various commentaries and editions. The order in which the sections of the Chu Ci are currently generally arranged was established through editorial re-arrangement during or following the tenth or eleventh century.Hawkes (1985 [2011]), 31 However, this is not true of The Lament. In the Wang Yi edition, it is titled \"Lisaojing\". The other works (juan) of the Chu Ci anthology generally fall in the category of zhuan, or exegesis or amplification upon the original \"classic\" text.Hawkes  (1985 [2011]), 31-32", "In addition to the translations by David Hawkes cited above, translations into English include:"]}, {"page": "Jiu Ge", "response": ["David Hawkes finds evidence for this eclectic suite of eleven poems having been written by, \"a poet (or poets) at the Chu court in Shou-chun (241-223) B.C.\"Hawkes, 98", "The \"Jiu Ge\" songs include eleven (despite the \"Nine\" in the title). Nine of the verses are addressed to deities by a type of shaman, one to the spirits of fallen warriors who died fighting far from home, and the concluding verse.Hawkes, 95 The reason for the discrepancy between the 9 verses referred to in the title and the fact that there are actually 11 is uncertain, although an important question, which has had several possible explanations put forth. Of these explanations, some may be rooted in general Chinese number magic or symbology. More specifically, David Hawkes points out that \"nine songs\" is referenced in the seminal Chu Ci work, Li Sao, referring to the nine (twice times nine?) dances of Qi of Xia.Hawkes, 97", "Critics and scholars have elaborated various hypotheses as to why the Jiu Ge (\"Nine Songs\") consists of eleven songs, rather than nine. An obvious, and common, suggestion has been that Number 1 and Number 11 songs are somehow to be classified as an introduction and a luan: examination of Song 1 and Song 11 fails to support this convenient conjecture, however.Hawkes, 99 Sinologists Masaru Aoki and David Hawkes propose that for performance purposes there were nine songs/dances performed at each a spring and at an autumn performance, with the spring performance featuring Songs 3 and 5, but not 4 or 6, and the autumnal performance 4 and 6, but not 3 or 5 (with the songs otherwise being performed in numerical order).Hawkes, 99-100 Another explanation has to do with ancient ideas about numbers and numbering, where by the use of a numeric term, an order of magnitude, estimation, or other symbolic qualities are meant, rather than a specific quantity.Hawkes, 101 11 songs could be \"about 9\" songs.", "The following table shows the eleven individual poems of the Nine Songs. The English translations are following those of David Hawkes,Hawkes, 101-118 although he uses Roman numerals for the traditional song order.", "The titles of the individual poems which follow are loosely based on David Hawkes:", "The tenth Jiu ge poem (Guo shang) is a hymn to soldiers killed in war (\"Guo shang\").

Put together, the title refers to those who meet death in the course of fighting for their country. David Hawkes describes it as \"surely one of the most beautiful laments for fallen soldiers in any language\".Hawkes, 116-117 The meter is a regular seven-character verse, with three characters separated by the exclamatory particle \"\u516e\" followed by three more characters, each composing a half line, for a total of nine lines of 126 characters."]}, {"page": "Wen Yiduo", "response": ["Wen was credited by David Hawkes as the initiator of the cult of Qu Yuan as \"China's first patriotic poet\", writing that, \"although Qu Yuan did not write about the life of the people or voice their sufferings, he may truthfully be said to have acted as the leader of a people's revolution and to have struck a blow to avenge them.
