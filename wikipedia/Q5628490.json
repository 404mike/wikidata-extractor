Former imperial capitals such as Cologne and Trier lived on in diminished form as administrative centres of the Franks. In Britain, where the break with Late Antiquity comes earliest in the 5th and the 6th century, most towns and cities had been in rapid decline during the 4th century during a time of prosperity until the last decades of the century, well before the withdrawal of Roman governors and garrisons; historians emphasizing urban continuities with the Anglo-Saxon period depend largely on the post-Roman survival of Roman toponymy. Aside from a mere handful of its continuously inhabited sites, like York and London and possibly Canterbury, however, the rapidity and thoroughness with which its urban life collapsed with the dissolution of centralized bureaucracy calls into question the extent to which Roman Britain had ever become authentically urbanized: \"in Roman Britain towns appeared a shade exotic,\" observes H. R. Loyn, \"owing their reason for being more to the military and administrative needs of Rome than to any economic virtue\".Loyn 1991:15f.

Historians find no evidence of the Anglo-Saxon monarchs (c. 500 to 1066) creating forests.The Dialogue Concerning the Exchequer. c.\u00a01180  However, under the Norman kings (after 1066), by royal prerogative forest law was widely applied.Grant, Chapter 1 The law was designed to protect the venison and the vert, the \"noble\" animals of the chase\u00a0\u2013 notably red and fallow deer, the roe deer, and the wild boar\u00a0\u2013 and the greenery that sustained them. Forests were designed as hunting areas reserved for the monarch or (by invitation) the aristocracy (see medieval hunting). The concept was introduced by the Normans to England in the 11th century, and at the height of this practice in the late 12th and early 13th centuries, fully one-third of the land area of southern England was designated as royal forest; at one stage in the 12th century, all of Essex was afforested, and on his accession Henry II declared all of Huntingdonshire forest.", "Afforestation, in particular the creation of the New Forest, figured large in the folk history of the \"Norman yoke\", which magnified what was already a grave social ill: \"the picture of prosperous settlements disrupted, houses burned, peasants evicted, all to serve the pleasure of the foreign tyrant, is a familiar element in the English national story\u00a0.... The extent and intensity of hardship and of depopulation have been exaggerated\", H. R. Loyn observed. Forest law prescribed harsh punishment for anyone who committed any of a range of offences within the forests; by the mid-17th century, enforcement of this law had died out, but many of England's woodlands still bore the title \"Royal Forest\". During the Middle Ages, the practice of reserving areas of land for the sole use of the aristocracy was common throughout Europe."]}, {"page": "History of Devon", "response": ["The date that the Anglo-Saxons began to settle in Devon is not certain.

The end of the fighting appears to have been a protracted and miserable affair. Campaigns by King Ecgberht of Wessex in Devon between 813 and 822 appear to have resulted in the defeat of the West Welsh in Cornwall but not their complete disposition. William of Malmesbury reports negotiations between King Alfred of Wessex and King Dungarth of the Cornish in c. 876 held somewhere near Exmoor in Devon; presumably Alfred would have sought reassurances over his western frontier as he conspired to defeat the Danes.Major, Albany (1913) Early Wars of Wessex, pp. 97.
