He is the first and youngest paddler to circle Iceland by kayak.Foster started paddling in Brighton, England when he was 15 in a skin-on-frame kayak. At Burwash Place Outdoor Activity Centre, Burwash, Sussex, England, Foster learned to handle whitewater, sea kayaking and surf kayaking. From 1971 to 1972 he was employed there as a \"trainee instructor\".  He enjoyed the mix of Outdoor Activity instruction and Environmental Studies education and decided to pursue this as a career. He attended a three-year teachers training course at Redland College, Bristol, and gained classroom experience with two years teaching at a school in Buckinghamshire.\nIn 1977, after his Iceland circumnavigation, Foster was employed by East Sussex County Council to teach as \"instructor/teacher\" at Burwash Place. Later in 1977 he was promoted to deputy warden.\nAt the same time he continued his explorations with trips that included the Atlantic coast of Newfoundland and a voyage from the English Channel through France down to the Mediterranean.\nIn 1981 when the center was closed as part of regional cutbacks to education spending, he was redeployed as a schoolteacher, but resigned in summer 1981 to attempt a major kayak expedition \u2013 a solo trip from Iqaluit 63\u00b044\u203255\u2033N 68\u00b031\u203211\u2033W at the SE end of Baffin Island along Frobisher Bay to Resolution Island 61\u00b030\u2032N 65\u00b000\u2032W. He had to cross the 40 miles (64 km) of open water in the Hudson Strait to reach Lacy Island 60\u00b040\u203232\u2033N 64\u00b035\u203254\u2033W, northernmost of the Button Islands and part of the Northern Coast of Labrador.The tidal range in this area may exceed 40 feet (12 m) while tidal streams may run at more than seven knots. After fighting the tidal streams in the dark near the Button Islands, suffering frostbitten fingers and loss of gear, Foster eventually gave up on this expedition. He was able to catch a ride on an oil tanker that happened to have taken shelter behind Killiniq Island 60\u00b022\u203200\u2033N 64\u00b037\u203200\u2033W. The trip was described by the editor of the BCU Canoeing Handbook in 1989 as \"arguably the most impressive of any sea kayak adventure in the world.\"After his return to England \u2013 from 1982 to 1985 \u2013 he worked as an instructor at the Plas Menai, National Water Sports Centre, North Wales, primarily instructing kayaking, canoeing, boardsailing, mountaineering, with a little water-skiing, and sailing, gaining the following British Canoe Union (BCU) national qualifications in these fields.\nBCU Level 5 Coach Sea Kayak\nBCU Level 5 Coach Surf Kayak\nBCU Level 3 Coach Inland Kayak (also 5 Star Award Inland Kayak)\nBCU Level 3 Coach Open Canoe (also 5 Star Award Open Canoe)He also served for many years on the BCU Sea Touring Committee, and the BCU Expeditions Sub-Committee. \n\nIn 1985 he left for Iceland for six weeks, helping an expedition group from Cambridge with logistics and leading the kayaking component. He returned to start his own kayaking business. He taught local groups in Denmark, Sweden, Iceland, Finland, Canada and the United States.\nThe design label \"Foster Rowe\" emerged for a while as a collaboration with two other top kayak coaches, (Andy Middleton & Ray Rowe)  with products such as paddling jackets, personal flotation devices (PFDs) and tow-systems designed for leading edge performance.Subsequently working alone, the \"Nigel Foster\" signature paddle blade was released by Nimbus in Canada, and Foster worked in a design/consultant capacity with companies including Liquidlogic, Bending Branches and Extrasport in USA. (e.g. ExtraSport Tow-system).\nIn the late summer of 2004, accompanied by Kristin Nelson, he finally completed Baffin Island to Labrador expedition by paddling from Kuujjuaq 58\u00b006\u203224\u2033N 68\u00b023\u203255\u2033W in Ungava Bay to Nain 56\u00b032\u203232\u2033N 61\u00b041\u203234\u2033W \u2013 a distance of over 675 miles (1,086 km) of uninhabited coastline \u2013 in which there were numerous encounters with polar bears.In 2008, at the 6th Annual Induction Ceremony, Foster was inducted into the International Halls of Fame: Bicycling, Rowing, Canoeing, Kayaking as a Kayaker.Since 2007 Foster has been the head of research and development at Point65. In addition to designing products forPoint65, He also acts as a spokesperson and assists the company with PR, marketing and special events. Foster presently lives in Seattle, WA with his wife Kristin Nelson.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sea kayak", "response": ["* Nigel Foster and Geoff Hunter were the first to circumnavigate Iceland in 1977.", "* Nigel Foster solo crossing of Hudson Strait from Baffin Island to Northern Labrador 1981"]}, {"page": "Outline of canoeing and kayaking", "response": ["* Nigel Foster \u2013 first and youngest paddler to circumnavigate Iceland 1977, first solo crossing of Hudson Strait from Baffin Island to Northern Labrador 1981"]}, {"page": "Nigel Foster", "response": ["Nigel Foster may refer to:", "*Nigel Foster (pianist), English piano accompanist", "*Nigel Foster (kayaker) (born 1952), English sea kayaker"]}]}}
