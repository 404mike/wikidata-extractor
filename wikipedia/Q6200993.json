He made his first team debut as a 16-year-old later that year in an Inter-Cities Fairs Cup match against Utrecht. This made him the youngest player to play for Hibs in their history, a record that stood until January 2004, when Jamie McCluskey made his first team debut. O'Rourke then became a key player in Eddie Turnbull's side of the early 1970s that reached the 1972 Scottish Cup Final and won the League Cup Final later that year. He also scored two hat-tricks for Hibs in European matches, including one against Sporting Lisbon.\nO'Rourke was controversially transferred to St Johnstone in 1974 to make way for Joe Harper, who had been brought in from Everton at great expense. O'Rourke later played for Motherwell before returning to Easter Road as an assistant coach to Eddie Turnbull.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "James O'Rourke", "response": ["* Jimmy O'Rourke (baseball) (1883\u20131955), American baseball player, son of the Hall of Fame inductee", "* Jimmy O'Rourke (footballer) (born 1946), Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "St Augustine's High School, Edinburgh", "response": ["* Jimmy O'Rourke, footballer (Holy Cross Academy)"]}, {"page": "1971\u201372 Scottish Cup", "response": ["|FW|||| Jimmy O'Rourke"]}, {"page": "Hibernian F.C. in European football", "response": ["Hibernian entered the European Cup Winners' Cup for the first (and only) time in 1972\u201373, as the Scottish Cup winners (Celtic) had also won the league championship.
