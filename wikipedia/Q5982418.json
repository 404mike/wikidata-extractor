He is the author of Isles of the West: a Hebridean Voyage and Isles of the North: a Voyage to the Realms of the Norse. Both books are concerned with apparently-virtuous environmental NGOs which operate in rural Scotland but which, in the point of view of the author, actually do damage to it. Mitchell is a critic of bodies like the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and Scottish Natural Heritage, and has compared aspects of their behavior to that of the Nazis.Mitchell was founder and director of an organisation called \"People Too,\" described by him as an \"organisation founded to defend rural communities from the imposts of centralized bureaucracy.\"Mitchell has also written a book called The Cost of a Reputation, about the Aldington-Tolstoy libel trial which took place in London in 1989 and concerned the claims that a controversial British Army operation in May 1945 handed back tens of thousands of Cossack and Yugoslav refugees from Stalin and Tito, for the most part illegally, to the dictators. The book mainly concerned the London trial, at which (Mitchell claims) Lord Aldington, who had issued the illegal orders in 1945 as Staff Brigadier, perjured himself. In this, as an ex-Deputy Chairman of the Conservative Party, he was assisted by both the Foreign Office and the Ministry of Defense.\nMitchell lived for fifteen years on the Hebridean island of Islay, where he has three children. He now lives in Moscow, where he works as a journalist and has broadcast about books on the Voice of Russia. On 6 April 2007 he delivered a lecture \"Seeing Scotland: Historical Places and Themes\" at the ELE public forum in Moscow.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Terra nullius", "response": ["According to Ian Mitchell, Rockall was terra nullius until it was claimed by the United Kingdom in 1955."]}, {"page": "Repatriation of Cossacks after World War II", "response": ["In 1997, Booker published his book A Looking Glass Tragedy, in which he wrote: \"there was almost no part of the story which we found to be free from serious error, even to the point where atrocities and massacres described at length were found not to have taken place at all. Even the general belief that most of the Cossacks had died after their return to the Soviet Union turned out to be a wild exaggeration\". In a review of A Looking Glass Tragedy, the British historian Alistair Horne alleged that four of the six massacres of Cossacks by the NKVD described by Tolstoy never took place and: \"Of the Cossacks repatriated to Russia, few were actually killed; horrendous as their privations were, the vast majority survived the Gulag.\" Horne argued that the \"absurd\" sum awarded to Aldington had made Tolstoy into a \"national martyr\", and felt that the case showed a need for reforming English libel law.  Booker described the British media as suffering from a \"Cleverdick Culture\", accusing most journalists of being overtly motivated by the need to increase sales in a very competitive business via sensationalistic stories intended to promote public outrage and of being excessively credulous, especially about topics in which the journalists knew little, thus leading journalists to accept the Tolstoy thesis uncritically. Booker noted that the BBC produced nine television or radio documentaries that largely accepted Tolstoy's allegations at face value, which he saw as an example of the \"Cleverdick Culture\". By contrast, Ian Mitchell in his 1997 book The Cost of a Reputation: Aldington versus Tolstoy : the Causes, Course and Consequences of the Notorious Libel Case argued that there had been an \"Establishment\" conspiracy against Tolstoy, claiming that the Foreign Office and the Defence ministry had deprived Tolstoy of documents that had been helpful to him at this trial.

Mitchell stated the 138th\u00a0Brigade was informed that \"the return of the Cossacks to Russia is part of an international agreement\", many were wanted for war crimes, and \"any Cossack who escapes will be a menace to British troops stationed in the area\". The men of the division were ordered \"to capture or shoot any Cossack\" who attempted escape, but were to avoid any potential mass shootings. The historian and writer Giles MacDonogh wrote the division, along with the 78th, were engaged in \"some ugly scenes\" once the Cossacks and their families realised what was happening; \"Tommies used rifles, bayonets and pickaxe handles to convince them to board the lorries that would take them to the frontier.\" These efforts resulted in 900 German officers being turned over to the Soviets, among them Helmuth von Pannwitz who was later executed."]}, {"page": "The Minister and the Massacres", "response": ["One of Cowgill's inquiry team was Christopher Booker, who had initially supported Tolstoy.Ian Mitchell, \"The Cost of a Reputation\", Topical Books, 1997, pp. 145-146,  Booker wrote in more detail in A Looking Glass Tragedy.
