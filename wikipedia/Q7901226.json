She was transferred to BBC television in London in 1952, and subsequently appointed Assistant Head of Children's Programmes under Freda Lingstrom. Hearing-impaired herself, Eason insisted that programmes for deaf children made use of signing. She also transformed a rather pedestrian series of five-minute children's programmes the BBC had acquired from France into what became a cult classic, The Magic Roundabout.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Vision On", "response": ["Vision On was conceived and developed by BBC producers Ursula Eason and Patrick Dowling to replace a monthly series For Deaf Children (1952\u201364), a programme paced slowly enough for children to read captions and subtitles. It was noted in surveys that a favourite for deaf children was Top of the Pops, due to its lively and fast-moving format and that even the profoundly deaf could still enjoy the music's lower frequency notes."]}, {"page": "Eason", "response": ["*Ursula Eason (1910-1993), BBC radio broadcaster, television producer and administrator"]}, {"page": "Pat Keysell", "response": ["Keysell worked as a personal assistant to Ursula Eason (1910\u201393) who was the Assistant Head of BBC Children's Television from 1955 to 1970. She made her debut with For Deaf Children in the late 1950s by introducing mime to the format, acted out by deaf actors. By the time of Vision On she was a production assistant with the BBC's Drama Department and went freelance in order to present the new programme. Keysell was involved in Vision On at a very early stage when the series began in 1964, being the presenter and assistant to Tony Hart. Many of her ideas were included in the very early shows which were then broadcast fortnightly. It was Keysell who delivered the catch phrase \"I'm sorry we can't return any of your pictures but we give a small prize for those that we do show\" after the programme's 'Gallery' feature."]}, {"page": "Patrick Dowling (producer)", "response": ["In 1959, Dowling directed a monthly series for deaf children for producer Ursula Eason, called For Deaf Children. This was paced slowly enough for children to read captions and subtitles, but it had been noted in surveys that a favourite programme for deaf children was Top of the Pops, due to its lively and fast-moving format and the fact that even the profoundly deaf could still enjoy the music's lower frequency notes. Dowling and Eason took the concept and turned it in 1964 into Vision On, front by mime actress Pat Keysell (Eason's former PA) and artist Tony Hart. The aim of the programme was to entertain but also to encourage imagination, with a fast-paced flow of contrasting ideas, both sane and silly. The series ran for twelve years and, while retaining a commitment to the deaf, attracted a wider following. It gained several awards including the international Prix Jeunesse and the BAFTA Award for Specialised Programmes."]}, {"page": "List of directors of BBC Children's", "response": ["|Ursula Eason"]}]}}
