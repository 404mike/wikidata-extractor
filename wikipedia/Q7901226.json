She was transferred to BBC television in London in 1952, and subsequently appointed Assistant Head of Children's Programmes under Freda Lingstrom. Hearing-impaired herself, Eason insisted that programmes for deaf children made use of signing. She also transformed a rather pedestrian series of five-minute children's programmes the BBC had acquired from France into what became a cult classic, The Magic Roundabout.", "link_mentions": {}}}
