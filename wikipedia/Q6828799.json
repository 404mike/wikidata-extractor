He went on to play in the Football League with Manchester City, Birmingham City, Wolverhampton Wanderers, Reading, Hull City, Bradford City and Chester City before finishing his career in Non-league football with Halifax Town and Burscough.\nOn 9 November 2012 he was jailed for seven years for serious drug offences.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Burscough F.C.", "response": ["* Michael Branch"]}, {"page": "Shaun Whalley", "response": ["With Chester, Whalley played mostly for the youth and reserve teams, but he made his Football League debut for the club in a 0\u20130 draw with Cambridge United on 18 September 2004, coming on as a substitute for Darryn Stamp. His debut came just one day after he signed a professional contract with Chester; manager Ian Rush had only included him on the substitutes' bench as a result of injuries to Daryl Clare and Michael Branch. The following week, he was part of the side that defeated Sheffield Wednesday at Hillsborough Stadium in the second round of the Football League Trophy.

His first league game came just over a week later as Bradford lost 1\u20130 to Gillingham. Bradford struggled for form and Wolleaston's first goal did not come until April when he gave the team hope in a crucial game against Derby County. However, Derby went on to win the game 3\u20132, which effectively ended City's hopes of avoiding relegation. City's relegation was followed by a fall into administration, and Wolleaston, along with Michael Branch and Mark Paston, was released from the club at the end of the season. He had played 15\u00a0games for Bradford, all but one of which was in the league, with his goal against Derby being the only time he scored."]}, {"page": "Branch (surname)", "response": ["* Michael Branch (academic) (born 1940), British linguist", "* Michael Branch (footballer) (born 1978), English footballer"]}, {"page": "List of Bradford City A.F.C. seasons", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Michael BranchAndy GrayDean Windass"]}, {"page": "Gavin Lynch", "response": ["Lynch was an apprentice with Everton before being released in March 2004.
