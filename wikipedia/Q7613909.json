He made his debut at the beginning of the following season, which proved a watershed campaign for Kendall's men. Despite finishing in 7th position in the Football League Championship, the season \u2013 and Kendall's job \u2013 was saved by two excellent cup runs. Steven was not selected by Kendall for the 1984 Football League Cup Final (a defeat to local rivals Liverpool after a replay), but by the time Everton lined back up at Wembley for the 1984 FA Cup Final two months later, he was in the team. Watford were the opponents, and Steven played his part in the second goal of Everton's 2\u20130 success. As he ventured down the flank, Steven sent in an early, high and very awkward ball towards the Watford penalty area, which Everton centre forward Andy Gray and Watford goalkeeper Steve Sherwood challenged for together. Though Sherwood seemed to get two hands on the ball, Gray's challenge certainly involved contact with his head and the goal was given. Steven had played his part and an FA Cup medal was his."]}, {"page": "John Sherwood (athlete)", "response": ["He is the father of tennis player David Sherwood, a member of the British Davis Cup team.

He soon replaced Steve Sherwood in Watford's goal and at the end of his second full season at Vicarage Road he won the Hornets' Player of the Season and Display of the Season awards, the latter for a clean sheet against Liverpool. He remained with the club even after their relegation from the First Division in 1988. He went on to become Watford Player of the Season for an unprecedented third time in 1989\u201390.

He was dropped from the starting line-up after a number of goalkeeping errors. He let a clearance from Watford custodian Steve Sherwood bounce over his head into an empty net and punched a cross into his own net in a 2\u20133 home defeat to Stoke City a few weeks later. Gould then declared he would not pick Avramovi\u0107 again in the post-match interview.

Watford goalkeeper Tony Coton broke a finger two weeks before the game leaving manager Graham Taylor needing to find cover for Steve Sherwood after the transfer deadline. In desperation, Taylor suggested to Eddie Plumley that they sign his son, who had by then retired from football. Plumley signed, Sherwood dislocated a finger, so Plumley played; Tottenham Hotspur won the match 4\u20131. No fee had been agreed at the time but Graham Taylor wanted to pay Plumley.

Business interests and problems commuting from his Brighton home meant that Glazier couldn't give his full commitment to the Bees and he left the club after making just 12 appearances."]}]}}
