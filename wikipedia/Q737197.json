The Festival Cup match was eventually played at Tynecastle on 4 September 2004. Both teams were well below full strength because several players were training with their national teams. Playing the game in September also meant that the game was played after the start of the 2004\u201305 Scottish Premier League season and after the end of the Festival. Hearts won the second and to date last Festival Cup match 3\u20131. The Hearts goals were scored by Craig Sives, Mark de Vries and Dennis Wyness, while Stephen Dobbie scored a penalty kick for Hibs. The match was not in played in 2005 as Hearts had a protracted search for a new head coach. It was not resurrected in 2006 and has not been contested since."]}, {"page": "Festival Cup", "response": ["The following year, pre-arranged friendlies and fixture congestion meant that the clubs found it difficult to find a suitable date within the Festival period. The international fixture weekend in early September was agreed upon, but this meant that both sides were missing players who were representing national teams, effectively reducing the game to little more than a reserve team fixture. Amongst the sides who played, Craig Sives and Calum Elliot had both yet to feature in the Hearts first team, while Hibs included untried personnel in the form of John Kane and Jay Shields."]}, {"page": "2011 Shamrock Rovers F.C. season", "response": ["|4||DF||align=\"left\"| Craig Sives", "|Craig Sives"]}, {"page": "2012 St Patrick's Athletic F.C. season", "response": ["The Saints faced Shamrock Rovers away in their next league game after a 1\u20130 win vs \u00cdBV in their last game.
