Stewart (c. 1776 \u2013 10 September 1851) was a Scottish sealer and whaler after whom New Zealand's Stewart Island is named.Stewart served in the Royal Navy from 1793 to 1797. In June 1801 he arrived in Port Jackson (Sydney), New South Wales, and used \u00a31500 to purchase a partnership in a Bass Strait sealing business with John Palmer. In 1809 he was first officer on the Pegasus which sailed to New Zealand, where he corrected two of James Cook's errors in his map of the New Zealand coast, establishing the insularity of Stewart Island and confirming that Banks Peninsula was not an island.\nIn 1826 Stewart was instrumental in the establishment of a timber, flax and trading settlement at Port Pegasus, the first European settlement on Stewart Island. Although the settlement failed within a year Stewart himself returned in 1840 to settle on the island.\nWilliam W. Stewart is sometimes confused with the John Stewart who in 1831 was involved in a massacre of more than 150 Maori at Akaroa and Port Levy.He died in Poverty Bay on 10 September 1851.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Pegasus Bay", "response": ["The Pegasus was the name of the sailing ship which surveyed part of the South Island in 1809. The brig Pegasus was the former Pegaso, captured at the Peruvian port of Trujillo on 28 July 1807 by the British frigate , commanded by Captain Charles James Johnston, during a cruise against Spanish shipping and ports along the coasts of Spanish America. Johnston dispatched Pegaso to Port Jackson, where she arrived at the end of October.John Harris to Anna Jos\u00e9pha King, 25 October 1807, Historical Records of New South Wales, Sydney, Vol.VI, 1898, p.348.

A few months later she was acquired by Thomas Moore and in May of that year she was made ready to go on the sealing trade to the southern part of New Zealand. This expedition took place between August 1808 and March 1809, when Pegasus was commanded by Captain Eber Bunker. Pegasus went on a second expedition under the command of Samuel Chase from Port Jackson to London by way of the sealing grounds in southern New Zealand from May 1809 to August 1810: William W. Stewart was first officer and made charts of the New Zealand coast, including Stewart Island, which was subsequently named after him.The Sydney Gazette, 15 May, 22 May, 29 May, 5 June 17 July, 24 July 21 August, 28 August 11 September, 18 September  1808, 19 March 12 March, 9 April 16 April, 7 May 1809. William Stewart gave Pegasus Bay its name. The captain of the ship, Captain Samuel Chase (not to be confused with his contemporary, Captain Samuel Rodman Chace), lays claim to correcting James Cook's charts by determining that \"Banks Island\" was in fact a peninsula.

Prominent Sydney merchants such as Simeon Lord, Henry Kable and James Underwood were engaged in the trade as well as the Americans Daniel Whitney and Owen Folger Smith. William W. Stewart, who claimed to have charted Stewart Island, and probably William Tucker who started the retail trade in preserved Maori heads, were present during the boom. After 1807, sealing was occasional and cargoes small, no doubt because the animals had been all but exterminated.Peter Entwisle, Taka: a Vignette life of William Tucker 1784-1817: Convict, Sealer, Trader in Human Heads, Otago Settler, New Zealand's First Art Dealer, Dunedin, Port Daniel Press, 2005, p.40-41."]}, {"page": "William Stewart", "response": ["* William W.

It appears to have been Jules de Blosseville who first applied the name Port Pegasus to South Port, on his 1824 Carte de la c\u00f4te m\u00e9ridionale de l'\u00eele de Tawa\u00ef-Po\u00e9nammou (Nouvelle-Z\u00e9lande); Blosseville was an officer on the expedition of the corvette Coquille commanded by Louis Isidore Duperrey.Ross, p.115. Duperrey's expedition did not visit the southern part of New Zealand but Jules Alphonse Rene Poret de Blosseville compiled several charts of parts of New Zealand including charts of the southern part of the South Island, from information received when the Coquille called at Sydney. De Blosseville obtained most of his information about southern areas from Captain William Edwardson of the sloop SnapperRobert McNab, Murihiku and the Southern Islands, Invercargill, William South, 1907, pp.332-333; Marjory Charlotte (Jefcoate) Thomas, Forgotten islands of the South Pacific: the story of New Zealand's southern islands, Wellington, A.H. and A.W. Reed, 1950, pp.70-71. but he also questioned captains of sealing vessels regarding New Zealand. Several charts of parts of New Zealand compiled by de Blosseville were included in the atlas dated 1827 published to accompany the account of Duperrey's voyage, Voyage autour du monde execut\u00e9 par ordre du Roi sur la corvette La Coquille pendant les ann\u00e9es 1822\u20261825, Paris, 1826). In the title of Carte de la cote meridionale de l'lle de Tawai-Poenammou... de Blosseville acknowledged the chart was drawn from original work by Captain Edwardson.Brian Hooker, \"Some Preliminary Notes on the Original and Revised Issues of the McDonnell-Wyld Chart of New Zealand\", The Turnbull Library Record, vol.16, no.2, 1983, p.114.
