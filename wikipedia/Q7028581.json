Halsman was offered the chance to stay at the Galabank outfit for the rest of the season. However, the left-sided youngster rejected this, as he attempts to force his way into Motherwell manager Stuart McCall's first-team plans. On 28 January 2011, Halsman joined Dumbarton on loan, initially for a month, but that was then extended until the end of the season as part of Nicky Devlin's transfer to Motherwell. Halsman scored his first Dumbarton goal in a 5\u20132 home win over Peterhead. On 20 January 2012, Halsman was again sent out on loan, this time to Albion Rovers of the Second Division. His loan spell ended when he was recalled by Motherwell on 21 March 2012.
