He was a leading influence during a time of significant transition in American entomology. Walsh championed the application of scientific methods to control agricultural pests. He was a proponent of biological control as an effective means to manage insects. He was also one of the first American scientists to support Charles Darwin's theory of evolution and was instrumental in securing its broad acceptance in the entomological community.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of biologists", "response": ["*Benjamin Dann Walsh (1808\u20131869), British-American entomologistAbbreviation in zoology: Walsh who studied agricultural insect pests"]}, {"page": "The Clouds", "response": ["* Benjamin Dann Walsh, The Comedies of Aristophanes, vol. 1, 1837. 3 vols.

This would create a specific name Cecidomyia vitis lituus, which is an unavailable name. In 1911, Ephraim Porter Felt incorrectly referred to this species as \"Cecidomyia lituus \", In 1878, Osten-Sacken noted that \"the gall Vitis-lituus \" was the same as his C. viticola. In 2019, this species was transferred from Schizomyia to the new genus Ampelomyia."]}]}}
