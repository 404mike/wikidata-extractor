Most biographers assumed him to be Nigel Heseltine, the future writer who published a memoir of his father in 1992. However, in that memoir Nigel denied that Puma was his mother; he was, he says, the result of a concurrent liaison between Heseltine and an unnamed Swiss girl. Subsequently, he was given to foster-parents, then adopted by Heseltine's mother.N. Heseltine, p. 123 Parrott records that the son born to Puma was called Peter, and died in infancy.Parrott, pp. 24\u201325 Smith, however, states that Puma's baby was originally called Peter but was renamed Nigel \"for reasons which have not as yet been satisfactorily explained\". Whatever the truth of the paternity, and in spite of their mutual misgivings, Heseltine and Puma were married at Chelsea Register Office on 22 December 1916.Smith 1994, pp. 106\u201307", "An inquest was held on 22 December; the jury could not determine whether the death was accidental or suicide and an open verdict was returned.Gray (1934), p. 295 Most commentators have considered suicide the more likely cause; Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and Peache both recalled that he had previously threatened to take his life by gas and the outline of a new will was found among the papers in the flat.Smith 1994, pp. 281\u201383 Much later, Nigel Heseltine introduced a new theory\u2014that his father had been murdered by Van Dieren, the sole beneficiary of Heseltine's 1920 will, which stood to be revoked by the new one. This theory is not considered tenable by most commentators.Parrott, pp. 34\u201341 The suicide theory is supported (arguably), by the (supposed, accepted) fact that Heseltine/Warlock had put his young cat outside the room before he had turned on the lethal gas."]}, {"page": "Heseltine", "response": ["* Nigel Heseltine (1916\u20131995), Welsh writer"]}, {"page": "1916 in Wales", "response": ["*3 July - Nigel Heseltine, writer (died 1995)"]}, {"page": "Llandyssil", "response": ["*Nigel Heseltine (1916\u20131995), writer and colonial administrator.
