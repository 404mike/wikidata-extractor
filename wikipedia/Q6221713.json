The Witches went on to become a dominant force in the top flight of British speedway, winning the British League Championship in 1975 and 1976, plus two Knock-Out Cup wins (doing \"the double\" in 1976). The 1975 title saw Ipswich defeat Belle Vue Aces by a solitary point. John Louis and Billy Sanders scored heavily throughout the season for Ipswich. The following year in 1976, Ipswich won their second consecutive title. The Witches team was once again headed by John Louis and Billy Sanders but this time Tony Davey also scored well with an average of 8.37, resulting in a comfortable league title success for the Suffolk team. The team then went on to claim the double on 28 October by winning the Knockout Cup."]}, {"page": "Billy Sanders", "response": ["Billy Sanders was signed by Ipswich Witches Manager/promoter John Berry in 1972 at the age of 16 and stayed with them until 1980.

He was also British League Knockout Cup winner in both 1976 and 1978 and was the British League Pairs Champion in 1976 and 1977 paired with John Louis. Sanders also won the Pride of the Midlands trophy in 1975 at the Monmore Green speedway in Wolverhampton.", "Sanders took his own life near his home in Ipswich. At the time he was suffering serious financial difficulties and had recently split from his wife. His body was identified by Ipswich promoter John Berry, who had acted as Sanders legal guardian when he had joined the Witches as a 16-year-old in 1972. Berry would later call it his worst off track experience in speedway. The lesson at his funeral was read by former World Champion Bruce Penhall, who was a close personal friend and the godfather of Sanders' two children. His ashes were flown back to Australia where they are buried in Sydney.History 1985, Ipswitch Witches website, URL retrieved 30 December 2006"]}, {"page": "Wimbledon Stadium", "response": ["Wimbledon's tenure in the top flight came to an end in the 1980s and the Greyhound Racing Association (the owners of the stadium at the time) decreed that speedway would end at the end of the 1986 season. However, a London stockbroker, David Pickles, gathered together a consortium in the 1986/87 close season that ensured that the Dons would continue to run. They employed the ex-England team manager John Berry and enjoyed reasonable success on and off the track in their first season. After a disagreement with Berry and the other members of the board, Pickles dramatically resigned as chairman of the club during the match with Exeter in September 1987, selling his shares back to the other members. With a few reshuffles at board level and the leaving of Berry, the remaining members eventually took Wimbledon back to the British League Division One in 1991, but the move proved disastrous and with only a couple of months of the season having been ridden, the financial losses proved to be so great that they were forced to disband the team. In June 1991 Wimbledon rode their final meeting, which was eventually curtailed due to the weather. Although there was no longer any league racing at the Plough Lane stadium, the team continued their league fixtures for the 1991 season moving to Eastbourne and were known during this period as the Eastbourne Dons."]}, {"page": "William Berry", "response": ["* John Berry (speedway promoter) (William John Berry, 1944-2012)"]}, {"page": "Edmonton County School", "response": ["* John Berry, speedway promoter"]}, {"page": "John Berry", "response": ["John Berry may refer to:", "* John Berry (album), debut album", "* John Berry (film director) (1917\u20131999), American film director", "* John Berry (illustrator) (1920\u20132009), British illustrator", "* John Berry (singer) (born 1959), American country singer", "* John Berry (arts administrator) (born 1961), British musician and arts administrator", "* John Berry (musician) (1963\u20132016), member of the Beastie Boys", "* John Berry (administrator) (born 1959), director of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (2009\u20132013), Ambassador to Australia", "* John Berry (congressman) (1833\u20131879), U.S. Representative", "* John Berry (New Jersey governor) (1619\u20131712), Deputy Governor of New Jersey", "* John Berry (cricketer) (1823\u20131895), British cricketer", "* John Berry (rugby) (1866\u20131930), rugby union footballer", "* John Berry (speedway promoter) (1944\u20132012), British speedway promoter and England national team manager", "* John Berry (Royal Navy officer) (1635\u20131689/90), British naval officer involved in the settlement of Newfoundland", "* John Berry (priest) (1849\u20131923), Church of England priest and Royal Navy chaplain", "* John Berry (zoologist) (1907\u20132002), Scottish zoologist and ecologist"]}, {"page": "Berry (surname)", "response": ["*John Berry (disambiguation), several people", ":* John Berry (administrator) (born 1959), US Ambassador to Australia", ":* John Berry (arts administrator) (born 1961), British musician and arts administrator", ":* John Berry (congressman) (1833\u20131879), US Representative", ":* John Berry (cricketer) (1823\u20131895), British cricketer", ":* John Berry (film director) (1917\u20131999), American film director", ":* John Berry (illustrator) (1920\u20132009), British illustrator", ":* John Berry (musician) (1963\u20132016), member of the Beastie Boys", ":* John Berry (New Jersey governor) (1619\u20131712), Deputy Governor of New Jersey", ":* John Berry (priest) (1849\u20131923), Church of England priest and Royal Navy chaplain", ":* John Berry (Royal Navy officer) (1635\u20131689/90), involved in the settlement of Newfoundland", ":* John Berry (rugby) (1866\u20131930), rugby union footballer", ":* John Berry (singer) (born 1959), American country singer", ":* John Berry (speedway promoter) (1944\u20132012), England national team manager", ":* John Berry (zoologist) (1907\u20132002), Scottish zoologist and ecologist"]}, {"page": "2012 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 3 August \u2013 John Berry, 67, speedway promoter."]}, {"page": "Deaths in August 2012", "response": ["*John Berry, 67, English speedway promoter (Ipswich Witches) and national team manager."]}]}}
