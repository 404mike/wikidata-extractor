Brogan was sacked and replaced by Kevin Drinkell. Drinkell had a terrible first season in charge: by February the club were third from bottom, and after a defeat at Brechin City the fans revolted against Drinkell. Sensing he was in the last chance saloon, he quickly brought in Paul Deas and Garry Paterson who shored up the team and took them on a 10-game unbeaten run. This run lifted the club into second on the last day of the season, when a point would have secured them an immediate return to Division 1. The Binos hosted Dumbarton at Forthbank but Dumbarton won, and the Binos were resigned to another season in the second division. However, in the 1995\u201396 season the club went on an amazing run and had the league sewn up by Christmas, and were regularly scoring six goals in their games."]}, {"page": "Kinnoull F.C.", "response": ["*Paul Deas"]}, {"page": "Deas (surname)", "response": ["* Paul Deas (born 1972), retired Scottish professional footballer"]}, {"page": "2000 Scottish Challenge Cup Final", "response": ["|DF ||6|| Paul Deas "]}, {"page": "Deas, Paul", "response": ["#redirectPaul Deas"]}]}}
