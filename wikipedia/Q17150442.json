Priestley moved back to England at the age of one or two. Although he was aware of his link to Gibraltar, Priestley stated that international football never crossed his mind because Gibraltar had not previously been a member of UEFA. Priestley made his debut for Gibraltar in a friendly on 3 July 2013 against Scottish Premiership club Hibernian after he was contacted to train with the national squad by head coach Allen Bula before Gibraltar became UEFA members. Priestley later revealed that a sports blogger from Gibraltar tweeted him after he discovered that Priestley was born in Gibraltar and gave him the contact information for someone at the Gibraltar Football Association. After Gibraltar was accepted as a full UEFA member on 24 May 2013, Priestley was one of the first eligible players to agree to represent Gibraltar following a search by the Gibraltar Football Association as they began preparations for UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying, along with former Premier League and Manchester United defender Danny Higginbotham and Bromley's Anthony Bardon."]}, {"page": "Gibraltarian football clubs in European competitions", "response": ["In the 2015\u201316 UEFA Champions League, Lincoln again represented Gibraltar, and were drawn in the first qualifying round against FC Santa Coloma, the champions of Andorra.
