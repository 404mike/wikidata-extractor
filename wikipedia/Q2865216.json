Public interest was stirred and Arnold was requested by the New South Wales Government to return to the island with a rescue party, obtaining the right to a \u00a3200 bonus if the girls were brought back. The expedition was carried out with the aid of an Aboriginal man named Tommy, who identified the Aboriginal camp near Indian Head where two girls aged about 12 and 18 were located and captured. The girls' 'excited' family/families were bribed with gifts and lies the girls would be returned soon. On taking them to Sydney, it became evident through their appearance and through their complete lack of knowledge of the English language that the girls were likely Aboriginal 'half-castes'. Arthur Macalister stated that he \"thought it very probable that these girls were half castes, and that the whole thing was a trick\". Further discredit was placed on the process when it was found that the Aboriginal people who were paid by the search party to find the girls were rewarded in worthless commemorative coins instead of real money. The girls, 'Kitty' Mundi and 'Maria' Quoheen/Coyeen, were not returned to their home but were initially kept at the Immigration Depot, where they yearned for their family. Kitty, the eldest of the two, suffered severe mental distress and died shortly afterwards. Maria survived for about 20 years, dying from pulmonary tuberculosis."]}, {"page": "Samuel Griffith", "response": ["On his return to Brisbane, Griffith studied law and was articled to Arthur Macalister, in one of whose ministries Griffith afterwards had his first portfolio. Griffith was called to the bar in 1867."]}, {"page": "Robert Herbert", "response": ["During his time as Premier, four land acts were passed, and the education question was also the subject of early measures. The governor, in writing to the secretary of state, stated that the Queensland parliament \"had passed a greater number of really useful measures than any other parliament in any of the Australian colonies\". Certainly, the first Queensland government was in marked contrast to those of the other colonies, each of which averaged half a dozen ministries in the same period. However, Herbert fell into some disfavour when financial difficulties arose. He resigned in February 1866 and was succeeded by Arthur Macalister who served premier until 20 July 1866. Herbert was anxious to return to England on account of private business but, at the request of the governor, formed a ministry which lasted less than three weeks and was merged in the second Macalister ministry. Herbert then left for England, having gained the sort of experience which was to be very useful to him in later years."]}, {"page": "James Robert Dickson", "response": ["Dickson was elected as a member of the Legislative Assembly of Queensland for Enoggera in 1873.

In the absence of Sir Samuel Griffith he was briefly Opposition Leader, and was Treasurer again 1883\u201387 after Griffith became Premier.

The Sydney Herald and the spokesmen for the settlers in the remote districts of New South Wales and Victoria, frequently leading men such as William Wentworth, typically classified the trial and execution of the offenders as \"judicial murder\". quoting Wentworth in the Legislative Council, Wednesday, 27 June 1849. Similar opinions were voiced years later in Queensland, the most populated section of the continent in terms of indigenous people, where it was the subject of numerous statements in the then newly separated parliament. In 1861, there was almost unanimous agreement that the prosecution and hanging in 1838 had been nothing less than '...judicial murder of white men in Sydney', as the government spokesman Robert Ramsay Mackenzie phrased it in his speech in the Legislative Assembly on 25 July, and that 'white troopers were \"useless\" as they could not be \"acting against the blackfellows as they wished, lest an outcry should be raised against them, and they could be prosecuted for murder.\"' Arthur Macalister, spokesman for the opposition (later three times Premier of Queensland) agreed, equally using the term \"judicial murder\". The notion seemingly almost unanimously agreed to by the first Queensland parliament was that no white man should ever be prosecuted in Queensland for the killing of a black."]}, {"page": "Richard Daintree", "response": ["However, Queensland premier Arthur Macalister was disturbed about the quality of some of the new immigrants and evidence of inefficiency and possibly worse in the office. Eventually, Macalister's concerns prompted him to travel to London personally in 1875\u201376 to investigate the office. Daintree was found to be personally honest and hardworking, and he was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in May 1876.https://www.thegazette.co.uk/Edinburgh/issue/8684/page/318/data.pdf However, the clerks responsible for routine administration were found to have conducted various malpractices, leading to their dismissal.
