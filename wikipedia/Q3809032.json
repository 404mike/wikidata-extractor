By 1769 Birmingham was developing its own orchestral resources, with concerts of \"vocal and instrumental music\" being advertised with \"the instrumental by the best performers of the town\". After 1772 the Royal Hotel in Temple Row formed the  town's main venue for concerts and polite social gatherings, hosting dancing assemblies and subscription concerts by the Birmingham Dilettanti Musical Society under Jeremiah Clarke. These combined after 1788 to provide a year-round programme featuring six grand concerts and balls during the winter months, interspersed with dancing assemblies and complemented by a second series of monthly concerts during the summer. Regular operas were performed at the King Street Theatre and from 1778 at the New Street Theatre. Highly technical advertisements for concerts in the Birmingham Gazette from the 1790s suggest that by then the Birmingham audience was well informed and maintained a high level of musically literacy. Notable late 18th century Birmingham composers included John Alcock, who wrote numerous religious compositions while organist at Sutton Coldfield, and Joseph Harris, who was born in Birmingham and returned as organist of St Martin in the Bull Ring, and is thought to be the composer of the one act pastoral Menalcas, in addition to two books of songs and six keyboard quartets that are notable for giving melodic parts to the strings, and for having slow movements of an unusually ornamental style."]}, {"page": "Drexel 4302", "response": ["200px|left|Signature of John Alcock on the first ruled page of Drexel 4302", "Subsequent owners are known from their inscriptions on the manuscript's initial pages.
