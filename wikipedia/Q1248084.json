It was revealed in the press that the new Bishop of Durham Michael Turnbull had a conviction for a gay sex offence, and OutRage! disrupted his ordination ceremony. There were other Bishops known or suspected to be gay in private, and OutRage! held a demonstration outside Church House naming ten Bishops and urging them to \"Tell the truth!\". Although the ten bishops were not named in the British Press, their names were published in the Australian gay newspaper the Melbourne Star Observer, and have since been published on the internet. At the same time, Peter Tatchell began a dialogue with the Bishop of London, David Hope as Outrage! hoped he could be persuaded to admit he was gay. Press stories speculating about the personal sexuality of Bishops led Dr Hope to  call a press conference in February 1995 at which he denounced OutRage! for putting him under pressure, while admitting that his sexuality was \"a grey area\"."]}, {"page": "Diocese of Rochester", "response": ["*2010\u2013present: Michael Turnbull, a retired former Bishop of Durham and Bishop of Rochester who lives in Sandwich in the neighbouring Diocese of Canterbury, where he is also licensed."]}, {"page": "Diocese in Europe", "response": ["*2003\u2013present: A retired former Bishop of Durham and Bishop of Rochester, Michael Turnbull, lives in Sandwich, Kent."]}, {"page": "Diocese of Canterbury", "response": ["*2003\u2013present: Michael Turnbull, retired former Bishop of Durham and Bishop of Rochester, lives in Sandwich."]}]}}
