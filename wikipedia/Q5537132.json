He played three times in the University match against Oxford University, being joint captain with George Boudier in 1843 when his 32 in the second innings of a low-scoring game contributed to a Cambridge victory. French appears to have been regarded largely as a batsman, though it is not known whether he was right- or left-handed, but he also kept wicket on occasion and took two recorded wickets as a bowler in first-class games. After leaving Cambridge University, his cricket was confined to lesser matches, but as late as 1878, when he was 57, he was playing for Suffolk in a two-day match, albeit not successfully."]}, {"page": "List of Mankading incidents in cricket", "response": ["#George Boudier by Charles Arnold, Cambridge University v Cambridge Town and County Club, 1847"]}, {"page": "Boudier, George", "response": ["#redirectGeorge Boudier"]}]}}
