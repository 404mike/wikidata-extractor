He did feature in the European Cup against Bayern Munich in Germany (the team having lost at home in the first leg), and in what proved to be his final appearance, took part in the title decider in 1991 when a depleted Rangers squad defeated Aberdeen 2\u20130; however he suffered a broken leg during the match (attempting to play on with the injury for several minutes before being substituted) and the club then signed the left back of the opposition on that day, David Robertson, to fill the position."]}, {"page": "Craig Armstrong (footballer)", "response": ["Born in South Shields, Armstrong started his career at Nottingham Forest in graduating from their youth system in 1992. Lack of first team action meant in December 1994 he moved on loan to Burnley. He made his debut for the Lancashire club in the 5\u20131 win over Southend United on 31 December 1994, playing in place of the injured Chris Vinnicombe. Armstrong appeared in three more league matches for Burnley before being recalled by Forest. In January 1996, he joined Bristol Rovers on another loan deal, again making four appearances. However, he was recalled a month later to play a further nine matches at Twerton Park. In October 1996, Armstrong was loaned to Gillingham for whom he played 13 matches as a defensive midfielder. In January 1997, he was loaned to Watford for a month, but his loan deal was cut short through injury. However, he was recalled for a further month in March 1997, with a view to a transfer. However, no move came to fruition. Armstrong scored twice during his spell at Forest with both goals coming in the League Cup in games against Walsall and Cambridge United."]}, {"page": "1994\u201395 Rangers F.C. season", "response": ["| Chris Vinnicombe ||  Burnley || \u00a30.2m"]}, {"page": "1989\u201390 Rangers F.C. season", "response": ["| Chris Vinnicombe  ||  Exeter City || \u00a30.15m"]}, {"page": "Charlie Bishop (footballer)", "response": ["Bishop made his debut for Burnley on 30 March 1996 in the 1\u20134 away defeat to Wycombe Wanderers, taking the place of Chris Vinnicombe, who was out with a broken ankle.
