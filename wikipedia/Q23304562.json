The race was first run in 1981 on a course designed by Peter Jebb.  In 1987, Peter altered the course to make it tougher and more interesting and it has remained unchanged ever since and this was the course on which the records were set.  It has now become a classic race in the fell runners calendar and this is recognised by the fact that it is regularly selected as an English championship race.  The race record is held by Colin Donnelly who, in 1988, completed the course in a time of 30:51. The women's record is held by Carol Greenwood who in 1993, finished with a time of 36:32."]}, {"page": "Snowdon Race", "response": ["| Colin Donnelly"]}, {"page": "World Mountain Running Championships", "response": ["|  Fausto Bonzi || Colin Donnelly || Martin May"]}, {"page": "Ben Nevis Race", "response": ["| Colin Donnelly", "| Colin Donnelly"]}, {"page": "Wasdale Fell Race", "response": ["| Colin Donnelly"]}, {"page": "Finlay Wild", "response": ["In May 2019, Wild ran the Welsh 3000s in a time of 4:10:48 which broke the long-standing record of 4:19 held by Colin Donnelly since 1988.British Mountaineering Council: Finlay Wild Breaks Records for Welsh 3000ers and Snowdon Horseshoe."]}, {"page": "Carnethy 5", "response": ["| Colin Donnelly and A.
