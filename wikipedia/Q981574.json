BOEN was a vehicle for governments and heads of state to invest in UK companies (subject to approval from the Secretary of State), providing they undertake \"not to influence the affairs of the company\". In its later years, BOEN was no longer exempt from company law disclosure requirements. Although a dormant company, dormancy does not preclude a company actively operating as a nominee shareholder.

He restored prescription charges (which had been abolished when Labour returned to office in 1964) and postponed the raising of the school leaving age to 16 to 1973 instead of 1971.

Jenkins ruled out increasing the income tax and so raised the taxes on: drinks and cigarettes (except on beer), purchase tax, petrol duty, road tax, a 50 per cent rise in Selective Employment Tax and a one-off Special Charge on personal incomes. He also paid for an increase in family allowances by cutting child tax allowances.Campbell, Roy Jenkins: A Well-Rounded Life, p. 319."]}, {"page": "Edward Heath", "response": ["During Heath's first year in office, higher charges were introduced for benefits of the welfare state such as school meals, spectacles, dentistry, and prescriptions. Entitlement to State Sickness Benefit was also changed so that it would only be paid after the first three days of sickness.The Five Giants: A Biography of the Welfare State by Nicholas Timmins As a result of the squeeze in the education budget, the provision of free school milk was ended for 8- to 11-year-olds (it had already been ended for older children by[Harold Wilson); the tabloid press christened Margaret Thatcher, the then Education Secretary as \"Margaret Thatcher: Milk Snatcher\". Despite these measures, the Heath government encouraged a significant increase in welfare spending, and Thatcher blocked Macleod's other posthumous education policy: the abolition of the Open University, which had recently been founded by the preceding Labour government.Edmund Dell, The chancellors: a history of the chancellors of the Exchequer, 1945\u201390 (1997) pp. 389\u2013399."]}, {"page": "Hugh Gaitskell", "response": ["Cripps returned to London on 18 August to be greeted by two memoranda from Gaitskell. One was a short paper advising a general election that autumn after devaluation. Cripps did indeed make that recommendation to Attlee, but it was rejected. The second paper was ten pages on devaluation, which in Edmund Dell\u2019s view it is unlikely he actually read. Gaitskell argued that with employment high, the balance of payments in decent shape and inflation a containable problem, the only problem was shortage of dollars, with US opinion very reluctant to help the UK any more. He recommended spending cuts to keep inflation under control \u2013 but did not say how much. He also recommended that sterling initially float within a band of $2.80-$2.60, a proposal discussed with Hall and Plowden. He recommended devaluation by 4 September, but rejected the idea that currencies become fully convertible \u2013 in the way that John Maynard Keynes had advocated at the Bretton Woods Conference \u2013 as this might prevent governments protecting full employment. Dell argues that Gaitskell\u2019s memo was full of the impatience of a young man at his elders clinging to office, but that on the other hand he himself had been slow to recognise the need for devaluation.Dell 1997, p. 122-4 Gaitskell and Wilson met with Attlee, Ernest Bevin and Cripps at Chequers on 19 August, and Bevin and Cripps agreed with some reluctance to devaluation. The decision was finally confirmed by the Cabinet on 9 August, although Cripps rejected Gaitskell\u2019s plan for a floating band.Dell 1997, p. 124-5 Devaluation (from $4.03 to $2.80) was announced on Sunday 18 September after a secret Cabinet meeting the day before. Many other countries followed suit, so it was mainly UK trade with dollar-using countries which was affected.Dell 1997, p.126", "Edmund Dell argues that neither Bevan nor Gaitskell emerge with much credit from the affair. \"Gaitskell was obsessed by Bevan and by the need to establish his authority over him\". Charges on false teeth and spectacles were \"insignificant\" in the context of the greater budget and \"financially were neither here nor there\" ... but Bevan was \"impatient and arrogant and noisy and apparently intent on exhausting the tolerance of his cabinet colleagues\". Gaitskell agreed to limit health charges to three years (subject to Parliament voting to extend them), made concessions on pensions to the Trade Union Group of MPs, and a diary entry suggests he was not happy about dividend constraints \u2013 yet he was not prepared to make significant concessions to Bevan. However, Dell argues that all chancellors have to make sticking points or they would have to give in to everybody. Gaitskell saw himself as defending the country and wanted to prove Labour a \"responsible party of government\", but the public were not yet aware of the looming inflation problem. Gaitskell told George Brown in 1960: \"It was a battle between us for power \u2013 he knew it and so did I\".Dell 1997, p.148, 155-7"]}, {"page": "Barbara Castle", "response": ["The Castle Diaries were published in two volumes in 1980 and 1984, chronicling her time in office from 1964 to 1976 and providing insights into the workings of cabinet government.
