Jones made his debut on the opening day of the season in a 1\u20130 away defeat against Darlington. During the 2005\u201306 season Jones moved on to play a central role in the team in his second season. The club made a strong start to the season in both league and cup which included a 1\u20130 victory over Tottenham Hotspur in the League Cup second round during September 2005. It was following this match that Jones who impressed at centre half was carried off the pitch by Grimsby fans. The club failed to gain automatic promotion from League Two on the final day of the season and had to settle for the play-offs. Despite beating local rivals Lincoln City in the semi-final Grimsby lost the final 1\u20130 to Cheltenham Town. Following the club's failure to secure promotion Jones was one of several key players who departed the club in the summer of 2006 with the club agreeing a deal to sell Jones to Scottish Premier League club Hibernian."]}, {"page": "Jason Brown (footballer)", "response": ["Brown began his career playing youth football as a defender for Fisher Athletic before converting to a goalkeeper at the age of 14.

His performances attracted the attention of several London based clubs, including Fulham and Queens Park Rangers. He eventually signed for Charlton Athletic after two of his friends also joined up with the club.
