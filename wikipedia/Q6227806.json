By 1943, U-boats were well-armed with anti-aircraft guns and two Victoria Crosses were won by Catalina pilots pressing home their attacks on U-boats in the face of heavy fire: Flying Officer John Cruickshank of the RAF, in 1944, for sinking U-347 (although the submarine is now known to have been U-361) and in the same year Flight Lieutenant David Hornell of the Royal Canadian Air Force (posthumously) against U-1225. Catalinas destroyed 40 U-boats, but not without losses of their own. A Brazilian Catalina attacked and sank U-199 in Brazilian waters on 31 July 1943.

The column aroused fierce criticism. Jonathan Kay, writing in the National Post, accused Mallick of \"childish vulgarity\" and \"hypocrisy\" and said that her writing \"is haunted by hateful hang-ups about Americans, country-dwellers and the political right. Some of her obsessions are downright weird \u2014 such as her prurient insistence that male conservatives embrace bad policy because they are impotent and horny.\" An investigation by the CBC ombudsman found that \"many of her most savage assertions lack a basis in fact\", and that her aspersions on the sexual inadequacy of Republican men \"would easily be seen as, at best, puerile\" if \"applied to any other group\".
