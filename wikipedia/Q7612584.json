He has wife named Lucy who together have two children, Jack and Ollie.Francis signed as an apprentice for Chelsea in July 1980,and made his debut as a 17-year-old at Southampton in the League Cup in October 1981,and made his League debut in November 1981. \nFrancis was initially a regular in the side, but the arrival of new goalkeeper Eddie Niedzwiecki in 1983 saw him relegated to the reserves for most of the next three seasons. Francis returned to the first team after an injury to Niedzwiecki, but conceded 14 goals in three games over Easter 1986 and never played for the club again. He made a total of 88 appearances in all competitions for Chelsea.Francis played in the Full Members Cup Final at Wembley in 1986 when Chelsea beat Manchester\nCity 5\u20134, Niedzwiecki was injured for this match.He left in 1987 to join Reading for \u00a315,000, where he played a further 250 games and won the club's Player of the Year award in the 1986\u201387 season, before joining Huddersfield Town in 1993.He was Huddersfield's first-choice goalkeeper for four seasons, then fell out of favour early in the 1997\u201398 season. Huddersfield loaned in goalkeepers Vince Bartram and Steve Harper before signing Nico Vaesen in the summer of 1998. Francis left in January 1999 to join Northampton Town, where he made just three league appearances.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Huddersfield Town A.F.C.", "response": ["|1994|| Steve Francis"]}, {"page": "Neil Warnock", "response": ["Warnock was quick to inject new blood into the Terriers' side, snapping up goalkeeper Steve Francis, Darren Bullock, Ronnie Jepson, Tom Cowan and Pat Scully during his first season, all of whom would go on to become mainstays in the 1994\u201395 promotion season. He also showed faith in Centre of Excellence products such as Chris Billy, Simon Baldry and Andy Booth \u2013 a player then struggling to make the breakthrough who would go on to become a club legend in modern times. Despite these acquisitions, Town struggled for most of the 1993\u201394 season, their last at Leeds Road, and Warnock was quick to offload fan favourites Iwan Roberts, Iffy Onoura and Chris Marsden while introducing a more direct style of play. The run to the 1994 Football League Trophy Final (lost on penalties to Swansea City) coincided with an upturn in league form and a mass optimism further bolstered by the move to the new Alfred McAlpine Stadium for the 1994\u201395 season. Warnock's side won the Yorkshire Electricity Cup in late 1994. Warnock's side were genuine contenders for automatic promotion until falling away in the final few games to finish 5th (the final play-off spot that season owing to league re-structuring). They triumphed on penalties over second-placed Brentford after two thrilling ties and went on to beat Bristol Rovers at Wembley Stadium. He quit Huddersfield just days after their promotion, but made a swift and surprising return to management at Plymouth Argyle, who had just been relegated to Division Three."]}, {"page": "Darren Edmondson", "response": ["Born in Coniston, then in Lancashire, Edmondson started as a trainee at Carlisle United, where he stayed for seven years before being transferred to Huddersfield Town for \u00a3225,500. He had a difficult time there however, he even scored a bizarre own goal against Ipswich Town, in which he was passing the ball back to Town's keeper Steve Francis and it somehow went through his legs and into the goal."]}]}}
