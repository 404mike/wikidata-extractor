West Yorkshire where he was living in 1881 with his family and a household of thirteen servants.

He was also  a JP, chairman  of the Chamber of Commerce and took an active role in founding and running the Yorkshire Penny  Bank. In 1866 he commenced construction of Ripley Ville an estate of \"model houses\" for the working classes. When completed it had many of the aspects of an \"industrial  model village\" - though residents were not limited to H.W. Ripley's employees. Ripley Ville can be compared with Akroydon (Halifax, built by H.W Ripley's friend and former schoolmate Edward Akroyd) and with Saltaire\nFrom 1868 he was  also  active in national politics. He was returned to Parliament for Bradford as a Liberal at the 1868 general election, but his election was overturned on petition in 1869. He was re-elected at the  1874 general election as an Independent, but was defeated at the  1880 general election when he stood as a Conservative.In 1880 he was created a baronet, of Rawdon in the County of York and Bedstone, Shropshire. He died in November 1882, aged 69, and was succeeded as second Baronet by his eldest son Edward.
