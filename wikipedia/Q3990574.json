Stories revolving around sculptures of Aphrodite were common in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Examples of such works of literature include the novel The Tinted Venus: A Farcical Romance (1885) by Thomas Anstey Guthrie and the short story The Venus of Ille (1887) by Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e, both of which are about statues of Aphrodite that come to life. Another noteworthy example is Aphrodite in Aulis by the Anglo-Irish writer George Moore, which revolves around an ancient Greek family who moves to Aulis. The French writer Pierre Lou\u00ffs titled his erotic historical novel Aphrodite: m\u0153urs antiques (1896) after the Greek goddess. The novel enjoyed widespread commercial success, but scandalized French audiences due to its sensuality and its decadent portrayal of Greek society."]}, {"page": "August 8", "response": ["*1856 \u2013 Thomas Anstey Guthrie, English journalist and author (d. 1934)"]}, {"page": "1900 in literature", "response": ["*Thomas Anstey Guthrie \u2013 The Brass Bottle"]}, {"page": "1934 in literature", "response": ["*March 10 \u2013 Thomas Anstey Guthrie (F.
