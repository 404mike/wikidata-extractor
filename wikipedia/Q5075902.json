This was compounded when Menzies stated his reason as being that there was \"no RAAF officer of sufficient age, or operational experience, to take the post of Chief of the Air Staff\", which appeared to ignore the wartime records of such figures as John McCauley and Frederick Scherger.Stephens, Going Solo, p. 73 The Daily Mirror in Sydney was one of several media outlets to voice a \"stern protest\" over the matter. Menzies also felt he could justify the appointment of an outsider on the grounds that the RAAF's geographically based command-and-control system needed reorganisation along functional lines, a system with which a senior RAF member would be familiar. Britain's CAS, Marshal of the Royal Air Force Sir John Slessor, was, somewhat reluctantly, responsible for fulfilling the Australian Government's request for a suitable officer.
