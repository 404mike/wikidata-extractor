Their opponents were Bolton Wanderers. This was also known as the White Horse Final, so named because an estimated 200,000 people came to see the match; spilling out on to the pitch, which had to be cleared prior to kick-off, by \"Billie,\" a giant white horse (actually grey) being ridden by PC George Scorey.

In honour of Billy, the footbridge outside the new Wembley Stadium has been named the White Horse Bridge. The official attendance is often quoted as 126,047.

PC Scorey had not actually been on duty that day but answered a call for emergency assistance as the throng of spectators in the stadium grew.  Some sources misattribute the name to the primitive (high-contrast) black and white newsreel footage of the era, but in existing footage it is still clear Billie was a gray horse as indicated by his dark muzzle. More likely, the general public was unaware that ostensibly white horses are generally called gray. Contrary to what is sometimes claimed, other horses were also involved, but the \"white\" horse, as the most visible in the news footage, became the defining image of the day.", "The image of Billie the white horse remains famous within English football lore, and the match is often referred to as \"The White Horse Final\".
