Kipper had his own band, One Nation. After releasing two albums with One Nation he joined the Gary Numan band playing guitar.\nAfter realizing his own music was going in a similar direction as Kipper's previous work, Numan asked him to co-produce his 1992 LP Machine and Soul. The album was a mix of funk, rock and dance pop featuring guitar playing from Kipper. Kipper also contributed to Numan's 1994 album Sacrifice although to a much lesser extent.\nYears later, Kipper helped produce and played keyboards on two of Sting's studio albums Brand New Day and Sacred Love. Both albums have been critically acclaimed and feature a modern fusion of jazz, rock, and electronic and sounds.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of one-word stage names", "response": ["* Kipper, British musician"]}, {"page": "Clay Aiken", "response": ["Aiken stated in an April 2007 interview with People that he was planning a new album, and during his May 2007 appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, he mentioned that he was in Los Angeles interviewing producers for the new album.Richards, Constance. \"Clay Aiken: 'Idol Is a Drug'\".
