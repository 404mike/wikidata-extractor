Upson played for England at full international level including at the 2010 World Cup.\nUpson started his career with Bedfordshire club Luton Town before he joined Premier League club Arsenal for a fee of \u00a32 million in May 1997. Upson struggled to force his way into the first team at Highbury making 57 appearances in 6 seasons and also spent time out on loan at Nottingham Forest, Crystal Palace and Reading.\nUpson joined Birmingham City in 2003 where he enjoyed regular first team football. However following Birmingham's relegation in 2006 he went on to join West Ham United for \u00a37.5 million in January 2007. He was made captain in 2009 following the departure of Lucas Neill. At the end of the 2010\u201311 season West Ham were relegated to the Championship and Upson left after his contract had expired. Upson signed a two-year contract with Stoke City in August 2011. After a loan spell with Brighton & Hove Albion in the 2012\u201313 season, he signed a one-year contract with the club in 2013.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Suffolk", "response": ["Suffolk's contributions to sport include Formula One magnate Bernie Ecclestone and former England footballers Terry Butcher, Kieron Dyer and Matthew Upson.

The first half was tumultuous. The Frenchman seemed to be taking some unnecessary risks outside his penalty area, and his antics began to have consequences that allowed unneeded goals for opposing teams. He was at fault for two goals in a 3\u20132 home defeat by Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a in October 2001. Ferguson said how \"eventually he will get caught out\" and it wouldn't happen again. But another couple of late errors against Arsenal in a 3\u20131 defeat at Highbury the following month put much pressure on Barthez, with two goals gifted to Thierry Henry, one of which came from a mis-hit clearance. Barthez was at the centre of further controversy when, after already being on a yellow card following an argument with Matthew Upson, he was caught by television cameras raising his middle fingers behind his back towards the Arsenal supporters, who had been taunting him for his errors towards the end of the match; the incident was missed by the referee Peter Jones, however. There was much speculation as to what was the source of Barthez's decline, and critics such as the BBC's Phil McNulty urged him to be dropped. Sir Alex Ferguson, however, had faith in his goalkeeper and stuck by him. Consequently, in the second half of the season, Barthez repaired his reputation with consistent, solid performances and the spectacular saves that he was famous for. His turn in fortunes was shown in a 2\u20132 draw with Derby County at Pride Park. Derby forward Malcolm Christie looked to have sealed his hat-trick, but referee Steve Dunn controversially disallowed the goal, ruling that Christie kicked the ball out of Barthez's hands."]}, {"page": "Eye, Suffolk", "response": ["*Matthew Upson (born 1979), professional footballer, was born in Eye."]}, {"page": "List of sports announcers", "response": ["* Matthew Upson \u2013 ITV Sport 2017, BBC Sport 2016\u2013present"]}, {"page": "Diss, Norfolk", "response": ["*Matthew Upson (born 1979), professional footballer for Arsenal F.C. and England, attended Diss High School."]}, {"page": "Fabio Capello", "response": ["England opened Capello's first competitive campaign with a 2\u20130 victory over Andorra, in Barcelona, on 6 September 2008.

Hughes' first task was to release Rory Delap, Mamady Sidibe, Matthew Upson, Dean Whitehead, Carlo Nash and Matty Lund, at the same time giving Jermaine Pennant a new contract. He made his first signing on 28 June 2013 in Dutch international left-back Erik Pieters from PSV for a fee of \u20ac3.6\u00a0million (\u00a33\u00a0million).

In a match against Sunderland, Huth was sent-off for tackling David Meyler, although replays showed that he pulled out of the challenge. Sunderland took full advantage of the extra man and scored the only goal through James McClean. Stoke attempted to have Huth's red card overturned on appeal, but failed in their efforts.
