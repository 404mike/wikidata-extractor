Barr), which was DC Comics' first 12-issue comicbook maxiseries created for the direct market.Bolland subsequently concentrated on working as a cover artist, producing the vast majority of his work for DC Comics.

O'Neil operated under the assumption that he was hired to revamp the character and as a result tried to instill a different tone in the books than had gone before. One outcome of this new approach was the \"Year One\" storyline in Batman #404\u2013407 (February \u2013 May 1987), in which Frank Miller and artist David Mazzucchelli redefined the character's origins. Writer Alan Moore and artist Brian Bolland continued this dark trend with 1988's 48-page one-shot issue Batman: The Killing Joke, in which the Joker, attempting to drive Commissioner Gordon insane, cripples Gordon's daughter Barbara, and then kidnaps and tortures the commissioner, physically and psychologically."]}, {"page": "Batman (1989 film)", "response": ["The tone and themes of the film were partly influenced by Alan Moore and Brian Bolland's The Killing Joke and Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns.

D. Bright. Immediately afterwards, the character starred in the five-issue miniseries Robin,Robin #1-5, Jan.-May 1991 written by Chuck Dixon, with interior pencils by Tom Lyle and cover art by Brian Bolland. The new Batman and Robin team went on their first official mission together in the story \"Debut,\"Batman #465 again written by Grant and penciled by Breyfogle. Lauren R. O'Connor contends that, in early Tim Drake appearances, writers such as Grant and Chuck Dixon \"had a lexicon of teenage behavior from which to draw, unlike when Dick Grayson was introduced and the concept of the teenager was still nascent. They wisely mobilized the expected adolescent behaviors of parental conflict, hormonal urges, and identity formation to give Tim emotional depth and complexity, making him a relatable character with boundaries between his two selves.\" In the Robin ongoing series, when Drake had fully transitioned into an adolescent character, Chuck Dixon depicted him as engaging in adolescent intimacy, yet still stopped short at overt heterosexual consummation. This narrative benchmark maintained Robin's \"estrangement from sex\" that began in the Grayson years. Erica McCrystal likewise observes that Alan Grant, prior to Dixon's series, connected Drake to Batman's philosophy of \"vigilantism\" as \"therapeutic for children of trauma. But this kind of therapy has a delicate integration process.\" The overcoming of trauma entailed distinct identity intersections and emotional restraint, as well as a \"complete understanding\" of symbol and self. Bruce Wayne, a former child of trauma, guided \"other trauma victims down a path of righteousness.\" Tim Drake, for example, endured trauma and \"emotional duress\" as a result of the death of his mother (father in a coma and on a ventilator). Drake contemplated the idea of fear, and overcoming it, in both the \"Rite of Passage\" and \"Identity Crisis\" storylines. Grant and Breyfogle subjected Drake to recurrent nightmares, from hauntings by a ghoulish Batman to the disquieting lullaby, \"My Mummy's dead...My Mummy's Dead...I can't get it through my head,\" echoing across a cemetery for deceased parents. Drake ultimately defeated his own preadolescent fears \"somewhat distant from Bruce Wayne\" and \"not as an orphan.\" By the end of \"Identity Crisis,\" an adolescent Drake had \"proven himself as capable of being a vigilante\" by discerning the role of fear in instigating a series of violent crimes."]}, {"page": "Vertigo Comics", "response": ["Brian Bolland and Glenn Fabry have also produced a large number of iconic covers for the Vertigo line, Fabry probably being best known for his work on one title: Garth Ennis and Steve Dillon's Preacher (and the spin-off miniseries).
