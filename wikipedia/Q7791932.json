This meeting was attended by 1,500 people. In 1898 Killeshandra would replace Drummully in the title of the co-operative. Killeshandra emerged within a few years as the largest and most successful co-operative society in Ireland. The co-op is now part of Lakeland Dairies. As the Dairy expanded, Drummully House was sold to the Missionary Sisters of the Holy Rosary in 1924 for use as a convent. The convent buildings were extended twice during the first twenty-five years. Part of the convent was opened as a retreat and conference centre in 1976, however the number of vocations continued to decline and eventually the convent was abandoned in 1985. "]}]}}
