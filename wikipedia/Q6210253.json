Born in Wednesbury, Staffordshire (now West Midlands), he played for Hindley Central and Manchester United. He joined Manchester United as a back-up half-back in May 1913 for a fee of \u00a350. In his first season with the club, he made 14 appearances on both the left and right sides of the half-back trio. In 1914\u201315, he did not make an appearance until 6 February 1915, but ended the season with 12 appearances, again split between the right- and left-half positions. His career was cut short by the outbreak of the First World War, and he left Manchester United at the end of the 1918\u201319 season, by which time he had begun playing rugby league football and Manchester United were asking for \u00a320 to transfer his registration. He played club level rugby league for Warrington and Widnes, as a wing, i.e. number 2 or 5. He made his d\u00e9but for Warrington on Saturday 6 September 1919, and he played his last match for Warrington on Saturday 24 April 1920.", "link_mentions": {}}}
