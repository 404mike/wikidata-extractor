He studied drum rudiments from Lloyd Ryan and later under Frank King, and considered this training as \"more helpful than anything else because they're used all the time. In any kind of funk or jazz drumming, the rudiments are always there.\" Collins never learned to read or write musical notation and devised his own system, which he regretted in later life. \"I've always felt that if I could hum it, I could play it. For me, that was good enough, but that attitude is bad.\""]}, {"page": "John Coghlan (drummer)", "response": ["The son of a Glasgow-born father and a London-born half-French mother, Coghlan grew up in Dulwich and was educated at Kingsdale Comprehensive School.
