A vocal anti-suffragist, Lonsdale's name appeared on the list of signatories to \"A Woman's Protest Against Female Suffrage\" published in The Nineteenth Century in 1889. Lonsdale was an early organizing member of the Women's National Anti-Suffrage League and part of the group's executive committee together with Mary Ward. Her letter published in The Times in 1907 encouraged readers to sign a petition against the woman's vote, which was presented to Parliament after collecting 37,000 signatures.In 1892, Lonsdale opened a girls' high school in Lichfield which would eventually become The Friary School. Much of her work focused on poor relief, as a member of the Charity Organization Society and board of guardians member of the Lichfield union. Lonsdale published The English Poor Laws: Their History, Principles, and Administration in 1902. She wrote the introduction to The Slippery Slope, and Other Papers on Social Subjects by William Amias Bailward, published in 1920.Her memoirs, The Recollections of Sophia Lonsdale, were edited by her cousin Violet Martineau and published in 1936.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Women's National Anti-Suffrage League", "response": ["An anti-suffrage correspondence had taken place in the pages of The Times through 1906\u201307,The Times, Wednesday, 22 July 1908; pg. 13; Issue 38705; col DThe Times, Thursday, 8 December 1910; pg. 9; Issue 39450; col E: \"Woman Suffrage. The Anti-Suffrage Movement, A New Organization.\" with further calls for leadership of the anti-suffrage movement being placed in The Spectator in February 1908. Possibly as early as 1907, a letter was circulated to announce the creation of a National Women's Anti-Suffrage Association and inviting recipients to become a member of the Central Organising Committee or a member. It was issued under the names of thirty peeresses who became prominent anti-suffragists, as well as a number of peers and MPs. However, the first meeting of the Women's National Anti-Suffrage League only took place the following year on 21 July, at the Westminster Palace Hotel with Lady Jersey in the Chair. Seventeen people were nominated to the central committee at this meeting, including Mrs Humphry Ward in the chair of the Literary Committee and Gertrude Bell as secretary. Other members were Mrs Frederic Harrison (Ethel Bertha Harrison), Sophia Lonsdale, Violet Markham, Beatrice Chamberlain and Hilaire Belloc MP."]}]}}
