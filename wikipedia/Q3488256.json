Holly has a functional IQ of 6000, although this is severely depleted by the three million years of runtime and lack of repairs. Holly is left alone after the radiation accident that kills Rimmer and the rest of the crew except for Lister and the Cat. The computer had developed \"computer senility\" before the radiation accident, rendering it functionally inert. The change in appearance for series III is explained by Holly having changed his face to resemble that of a computer from a parallel universe \"with whom he'd once fallen madly in love\".Howarth & Lyons (1993) pp. 35\u201338. Following an absence in series VI and the majority of series VII, Holly is back as his original male persona, being reset by the nanobots who stole Red Dwarf. From Back to Earth to series XII, Holly is absent once again due to Lister's bath overflowing offscreen, caused by him rushing out when hearing Kochanski had left, which got into Holly's circuity causing him to malfunction and go offline. In The Promised Land, the discovery of a backup drive allowed male Holly to return to the ship full-time.", "Alan Rickman and Alfred Molina auditioned for roles in the series, with Molina being cast as Rimmer. However, after Molina had difficulties with the concept of the series, and of his role in particular, the role was recast and filled by Chris Barrie, a professional voice-actor and impressionist who had previously worked with both the writers on Spitting Image and with the producers on Happy Families and Jasper Carrott productions. Craig Charles, a Liverpudlian \"punk poet\", was given the role of Dave Lister. He was approached by the production team for his opinion about the \"Cat\" character, as they were concerned it may be considered by people as racist.Howarth & Lyons (1993) p. 5. Charles described \"Cat\" as 'pretty cool' and after reading the script he decided he wanted to audition for the part of Dave Lister.Howarth & Lyons (1993) p. 6. Laconic stand-up comedian Norman Lovett, who had originally tried out for the role of Rimmer, was kept in the show as Holly, the senile computer of the titular ship. A professional dancer and singer, Danny John-Jules, arriving half an hour late for his appointment, stood out as the Cat immediately. This was partly due to his \"cool\" exterior, dedicated research (reading Desmond Morris's book Catwatching), and his showing up in character, wearing his father's 1950s-style zoot suit.", "In 1998, on the tenth anniversary of the show's first airing (and between the broadcast of series VII and VIII), the first three series of Red Dwarf were remastered and released on VHS. The remastering included replacing model shots with computer graphics, cutting certain dialogue and scenes, re-filming Norman Lovett's Holly footage, creating a consistent set of opening titles, replacing music and creating ambient sound effects with a digital master. The remastered series were released in a 4-disc DVD box set \"The Bodysnatcher Collection\" in 2007.", "In January 2020, the first publicity photos of the special were released, with Ray Fearon revealed as the first confirmed guest actor portraying Rodon, the \"leader of the feral cats\".

Lister vows to help them as they're being hunted by Rodon, the ruthless feral cat leader (Ray Fearon) who has vowed to wipe out all cats who worship anyone but him.\" Al Roberts was also added to the cast in an undisclosed role and Norman Lovett officially announced to be returning as Holly following his one-off guest spot in Series XII.", "The show's logo and characters have appeared on a wide range of merchandise.Howarth & Lyons (1993) p. 219. Red Dwarf has also been spun off in a variety of different media formats.

When Arnold Rimmer (Chris Barrie) sees it, he quickly believes it to be a stasis capsule carrying a dormant member of an alien race that can give him a new body. However, when he leaves it in the observation room and awaits it being cleared of quarantine, Dave Lister (Craig Charles) makes a closer inspection and finds it to be one of the ships' jettisoned garbage pods. When Holly admits to him that he didn't say anything about this to Rimmer as a joke, Lister decides to keep quiet as well.Howarth & Lyons (1993) p. 48.

When Arnold Rimmer (Chris Barrie), Dave Lister (Craig Charles), and Cat (Danny John-Jules) check the call, they learn that it was made from a service mechanoid called Kryten (David Ross), who reports that all of the crew are dead except for three female crew members.
