Newton played as a striker for several clubs in the lower divisions of the English Football League during the 1970s and 1980s. He is most notable for his first five-year spell at Hartlepool United between 1977 and 1982, where he wrote himself into club history with his 48 goals in 150 league games. Popular with Hartlepool supporters, he was later voted as the club's 'Player of the 1980s'.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hartlepool United F.C.", "response": ["Once again then, it was a huge relief for the supporters that Horner managed to make considerable improvements the following season. A large part of this was due to the strike partnership of Bob Newton and Keith Houchen; the latter would be the club's leading scorer in each of the following four seasons. There was also relative success in the FA Cup, with Crystal Palace being defeated at the Victoria Ground thanks to two goals from Newton as the club made the Fourth round."]}, {"page": "John McGrath (footballer, born 1938)", "response": ["Promotion was eventually achieved with a third-place finish in 1982\u201383.

He further sold Neville Chamberlain to Stoke for \u00a340,000, bringing in burly striker Bob Newton from Hartlepool United for \u00a315,000. Vale went top of the table despite a goalkeeping crisis which saw Barry Siddall, Neville Southall, Neil McAdam, and Andy Poole between the sticks at different points in the campaign.

McGrath had made some poor choices during his final months at the club, signing Ireland international striker Eamonn O'Keefe from Wigan Athletic for \u00a310,000 only to play him in midfield, and allowing player unrest to fester as several rejected new contracts and four stayed at the club on weekly contracts \u2013 this was despite Vale paying the third-highest wage bill in the division (\u00a39,000 a week).

The \"Valiants\" were relegated into the Fourth Division and manager John McGrath lost his job and was replaced by his assistant John Rudge. Henderson was not a popular player with fans, as he had arrived in exchange for a popular player and the club failed to win in his first 18 games.

John McGrath led the Vale to a club-record 88 points (equalled in 1993\u201394), which saw them win promotion in third place. This was some achievement considering McGrath had sold both the Chamberlain brothers and goalkeeper Mark Harrison to rivals Stoke City at the start of the season.

Also Chairman Don Ratcliffe was replaced by Jim Lloyd. Winger Steve Fox also arrived from Welsh club Wrexham on a free transfer. During the club's 2\u20131 win over Crewe Alexandra on 22 October at Gresty Road a petrol bomb was thrown at the 3,000 strong Vale crowd, though it was extinguished by police without doing 'any real damage'. On 6 November, Vale were losing 3\u20130 to Rochdale at Spotland and The Sentinel headlined their report with \"Heavy defeat for Port Vale\".

Siddall handed in his notice, whilst Bob Newton and \u00a38,000 were traded to Chesterfield for the services of Martin Henderson. Bromage walked out on the club after they refused to give him a contract lasting beyond two years. On 31 October, McGrath had to use 41-year-old coach Alan Oakes in a 1\u20130 defeat to Plymouth Argyle. Chairman Jim Lloyd then blocked McGrath's attempt to sign defender Ken Fogarty, showing how little confidence the board had in their manager. McGrath complained in the media, only to be 'gagged', instructed only to speak to the media on team affairs. Supporters began organizing demonstrations against Lloyd, and in favour of McGrath. In November Siddall and Bromage returned to sign new contracts. Steve Fox was suspended by the club for a fortnight after he refused to play in defence, and on 26 November Burnley thrashed Vale 7\u20130 at Turf Moor in front of Granada TV cameras.

The revival started the next day, with a 2\u20130 win over Sheffield United the first of four straight home wins that cut the gap to safety down to only four points. O'Keefe and Henderson formed a potent striking partnership, whilst Young added balance to the midfield. Jim Steel was sold off to Wrexham for \u00a310,000. Rudge said the battle to avoid relegation was as difficult a job as 'trying to climb Everest in a pair of pumps'. Struggling again in February, their 4\u20132 win over Newport County lifted them off the bottom spot.

At the end of the month Vale went nine league games without a loss to fire the club into the promotion race, their run including three 4\u20130 wins in Burslem as they went clear at the top of the table. With John Williams sidelined with an ankle injury, Vale's form suffered with just two wins in the following eleven games, and Vale fell to fifth place. From 11 January to 26 April the \"Valiants\" hit a run of eighteen league games unbeaten (eight draws and ten wins), thus ensuring promotion. This run was built on the striking partnership of Robbie Earle and Andy Jones, as well as a solid defence and consistent displays from keeper Arnold. During this spell Rudge failed to re-sign Bob Newton from Chesterfield, though was cheered by completing the double over Dario Gradi's Crewe Alexandra at Gresty Road. One low point was an attack by a Stockport gang on Russell Bromage following a 2\u20131 win over Stockport County at Edgeley Park.
