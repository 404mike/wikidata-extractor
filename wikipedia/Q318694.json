In February 1980, about seven months after the release of their breakthrough album Highway to Hell, Scott died of acute alcohol poisoning after a night of heavy drinking. The group considered disbanding but elected to stay together, bringing in longtime Geordie vocalist Brian Johnson as Scott's replacement.

In 2016, Johnson was advised to stop touring due to worsening hearing loss. Guns N' Roses frontman Axl Rose stepped in as the band's vocalist for the remainder of that year's dates. Long-term bass player and background vocalist Cliff Williams retired from AC/DC at the end of the Rock or Bust tour in 2016 and the group entered a four-year hiatus.

It didn't really work out because I was six and didn't really want to learn \"Mary Had a Little Lamb,\" and those were the kind of songs I was being taught. I wanted to play Elvis. I liked all the old 50s music. My dad had a bunch of old 50s records because that's when he was a teenager. Those were what I listened to, because when you're six you don't have the money to go buy stuff, so I just listened to his records. Nobody was going to teach me how to play the guitar like that, out in the country where I lived. I just gave it up until I was 13 or 14. I met a kid in school who played bass in the high school jazz band. He wanted to make some extra money and it was five bucks a lesson. He did a good job too. His name was Mike Hudson. I don't know if he plays anymore. I lost touch with him. He's the one that got me started. I always wanted to play in a band, and to learn how to play lead guitar was going to take like five years. But I really liked the sound of the bass. I liked AC/DC and figured I could do that. I thought I could learn Cliff Williams' bass parts faster than I could learn to play Angus Young's guitar parts. It was motivation, because I wanted to be in a band. I never wanted to sit around and play music by myself. I wanted to play with other people, and the fastest route to that was playing an instrument that wasn't a lead instrument, and bass was that. Now I've learned to make it a lot more difficult. I've made my job a lot harder than it probably needs to be. But it's just fun.

In the AC/DC memoir AC/DC: Maximum Rock & Roll, former manager Michael Browning states, \"I got a call one day from Malcolm and Angus.  We were in London, I went to their apartment and they told me they wanted to get rid of Mark.  Him and Angus didn't see eye to eye.  They used to have a sort of tit-for-tat thing going, but nothing that I would have ever thought was going to be gig-threatening.\"  According to Browning, the Young brothers were seriously considering Colin Pattenden of Manfred Mann fame. Browning feared that Pattenden was too old and didn't fit the band's image, so he instead pushed for Englishman Cliff Williams, who had previously played with Home and Bandit. Williams, who could also sing background vocals, passed the audition and was asked to join the band.  In a 2011 interview with Joe Bosso that appears on MusicRadar, Evans reflected on his ousting from the group: ", "Another often overlooked aspect of the record is the high quality of Bon Scott's lyrics, with biographer Clinton Walker writing in his 1994 Scott memoir Highway to Hell, \"'Gimme a Bullet' was perhaps Bon's most accomplished piece of writing to date, in which his penchant for hardcase metaphors finds even more genuine pathos and humour than it had before.\" \"What's Next to the Moon\", with its allusions to Casey Jones and Clark Kent, as well as the elusive \"Gone Shootin'\" and the unapologetic \"Down Payment Blues\" (\"I know I ain't doin' much, but doin' nothin' means a lot to me\"), clearly show that Scott's writing, much like the band's sound, had evolved from the novelties of the group's early albums. \"Bon was a street poet \u2013 he described it as 'toilet wall' poetry,\" former AC/DC manager Michael Browning explained to Peter Watts of Uncut in 2013. \"That was unknown. They signed a singer and got a lyricist, as well.\" \"Sin City\", which the band would perform frequently in concert, explores the seductive charms and dangers of Las Vegas, while \"Kicked in the Teeth\" addresses a two-faced woman with \"two-faced lies\". Musically, Powerage contains some of the band's fiercest rockers, including \"Down Payment Blues\", \"Riff Raff,\" \"Kicked in the Teeth\", and \"Up to My Neck in You\", and, as with previous albums, the songs were recorded as live as possible (on \"Up to My Neck in You\", Angus Young can clearly be heard changing from rhythm to lead for his guitar solo). In an interview with Bass Frontiers, Cliff Williams recalls the sessions fondly: \"The guys had already been in the studio for a while and we went in to do what turned out to be the Powerage album. Great work environment. Albert Studios there in Sydney was a great little rock and roll room...Great producers.  Obviously a lot of chemistry there being brothers. Just a real fiery, energetic work environment. And we had about three weeks to do it, 'cause that's about all the money we had...It was really a tremendous experience.\"", "*Cliff Williams \u2013 bass guitar, backing vocals (all tracks except \"Cold Hearted Man\")"]}, {"page": "The Razors Edge (AC/DC album)", "response": ["*Cliff Williams \u2013 bass guitar, backing vocals"]}, {"page": "If You Want Blood You've Got It", "response": ["*Cliff Williams \u2013 bass guitar, backing vocals"]}, {"page": "Fly on the Wall (AC/DC album)", "response": ["*Cliff Williams \u2013 bass guitar, backing vocals"]}, {"page": "Chris Slade", "response": ["Since that time, in addition to playing live, Slade has appeared in all promotional photos taken with the band and appeared in the music video for the single \"Rock the Blues Away\".
