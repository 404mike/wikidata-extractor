He achieved a new personal best in September at the 1998 IAAF World Cup with a run of 10.03\u00a0s for third place and won a relay gold medal. At the 1998 Commonwealth Games he was a 100\u00a0m semi finalist and set a games record as part of the 4\u00d7100\u00a0m relay team.'I thought I'd won' . Sports Illustrated (21 September 1998). Retrieved on 5 May 2009.Commonwealth Games Records . Commonwealth Games official website. Retrieved on 5 May 2009. His ability attracted the attention of former sprinter and Commonwealth Games gold medallist Mike McFarlane, who became his coach. He came first in the 100\u00a0m in the 1999 European Cup, then at a meet in Nuremberg he became only the second European sprinter (after Linford Christie) to break the ten second barrier with a time of 9.99\u00a0s. Fellow British sprinter Jason Gardener scored a time of 9.98\u00a0s in Lausanne soon after, becoming the third Briton to break the barrier. In spite of this, Chambers remained some distance behind his North American counterparts.", "With the 2000 Sydney Olympics approaching, Chambers studied the technique of other sprinters. In an interview with BBC journalist Tom Fordyce, Chambers commented on the stamina Greene and Surin had gained from running in the 200\u00a0metres event and Jason Gardener's improved acceleration through running the 60\u00a0metres event. He experimented with distances at the beginning of 2000, sprinting over 50, 60 and 200\u00a0m in various competitions. He set a personal best of 6.55\u00a0s in the 60\u00a0m event in Ghent in February. A hamstring injury caused him to miss six-weeks of training and when he returned his 100\u00a0m performances were lacklustre. He finished ninth at the Golden Gala in Rome with a slow time of 10.41\u00a0s and was seventh in a tame 10.30\u00a0s at the London Grand Prix, results that led him to consider quitting the season altogether. A late rejuvenation at the British Olympic trials guaranteed his selection as he snatched first place with 10.11\u00a0s (just one hundredth of a second ahead of Darren Campbell). Victory against in-form world record holder Maurice Greene in Gateshead raised Chambers' confidence and he stated his aim to take home a medal from the Games.", "He won the 100\u00a0m at the Commonwealth Games trials in a season's best of 10.03\u00a0s, then equalled Linford Christie's record of 10.04\u00a0s at European Cup, where he led the British team to victory as team captain. Victories over Maurice Greene followed at Oslo's IAAF Golden League meeting and in Sheffield with a wind-assisted 9.95\u00a0s. He was the favourite for the 2002 Commonwealth Games, but Chambers faced stiff competition from British newcomer Mark Lewis-Francis who was finishing fractions of a second behind him. Chambers won all his preliminary races and reached the final, along with Lewis-Francis and Jason Gardener, but he suffered a cramp mid-race and ended up in last place. The English sprinters had the three slowest times in the final, with Lewis-Francis also beset by injury.", "Amongst his British contemporaries Chambers ranks top with two 9.97\u00a0s finishes; the first in 1999 in Seville, Spain and the second in 2001 in Edmonton, Canada. Compatriot Mark Lewis Francis also scored a personal best of 9.97\u00a0s at the Edmonton World Championships. Great Britain teammate Jason Gardener's personal best of 9.98\u00a0s falls just short of Chambers'. None of his British contemporaries have broken the ten second barrier on more than one occasion; Chambers has done so five times."]}, {"page": "Dean Macey", "response": ["After his retirement from athletics, Macey accepted a challenge to attempt to qualify for the 2010 Winter Olympics in the bobsleigh.
