In the West he was best known for his criticism of the Soviet bureaucracy and appeals for getting rid of the legacy of Stalin. He was working on a three-volume collection of 11th to 20th-century Russian poetry, and planned a novel based on his time in Havana during the Cuban Missile Crisis (he was, reportedly, good friends with Che Guevara, Salvador Allende and Pablo Neruda). In October 2007, he was an artist-in-residence with the College of Arts and Humanities at the University of Maryland, College Park, and recited his poem Babi Yar before a performance of Dmitri Shostakovich's Symphony No. 13, which sets five of his poems, by the University of Maryland Symphony Orchestra and the men of the UM Choirs, with David Brundage as the bass soloist. The first performance of the two works on the same program that Shostakovich set to Yevtushenko texts, \"Babi Yar\" (Symphony 13) and \"The Execution of Stepan Razin,\" with Yevtushenko present, took place at the University of Houston's Moores School of Music in 1998, under the baton of Franz Anton Krager. The performance was the idea of the then-President of the Moores School of Music Society, Philip Berquist, a long time friend of Yevtushenko, after the poet informed him that the two works had never been performed together. Yevtushenko had told Berquist that Leonard Bernstein had wanted to do so, but it never came to realization. The first translation of Yevtushenko's poetry into English was Yevtushenko: Selected Poems, a translation by Robin Milner-Gulland and Peter Levi published in 1962.", "Yevtushenko died on the morning of 1 April 2017, at the Hillcrest Medical Center in Tulsa, Oklahoma. His widow, Maria Novikova, reported that he died peacefully in his sleep of heart failure. His son Yevgeny reported that Yevtushenko had been diagnosed with cancer about six years before and that he had undergone surgery to remove part of a kidney, but the disease had recently returned. \"His wife, Maria Novikova, and their two sons, Dmitry and Yevgeny, were reportedly with him when he died.\" Following his death, Yevtushenko was described by his friend and translator Robin Milner-Gulland as \"an absolute natural talent at performance\" on BBC Radio 4's Last Word programme. Milner-Gulland also wrote, in an obituary in The Guardian, that \"there was a brief stage when the development of Russian literature seemed almost synonymous with his name\", and that amidst his characteristics of \"sharpness, sentiment, populism, self-confidence and sheer enjoyment of the sound of language\", he was \"above all a generous spirit\". Raymond H. Anderson stated in The New York Times that his \"defiant\" poetry \"inspired a generation of young Russians in their fight against Stalinism during the Cold War\"."]}, {"page": "Peter Levi", "response": ["* Yevtushenko, Yevgeny.

The main master, responsible for the royal portrait and other major scenes on a larger scale, has been claimed to be very innovative in his technique, while a second master partly followed his style, and the third was more conservative.Dimitrova, 33-34  However non-Bulgarian historians regard the style as a somewhat conservative one which \"adhered closely to Byzantine models\".McKendrick, 56 According to Robin Milner-Gulland, \"All the painters use saturated colours, relish picturesque details and confidently handle a linear, basically twelfth-century Byzantine manner that is distinctly archaic by the standards of the fourteenth century.\"Milner-Gulland, 303"]}, {"page": "The All-Joking, All-Drunken Synod of Fools and Jesters", "response": ["Peter's creation of this group was not without controversy, both at the time and in the eyes of historians.
