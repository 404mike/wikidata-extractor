It connects the Java Sea to the Indian Ocean. The name came from Sunda Kingdom, a kingdom ruling the west part of Java (now including West Java, Banten, and some west part of Central Java).

Recent radiocarbon dating has found it to date from about 2400 BC. It is of similar age to the larger Silbury Hill about  west of the town. Legend has it that the Mound is the burial site of Merlin and that the name of the town comes from Merlin's Barrow. More plausibly, the town's name possibly derives from the medieval term for chalky ground \"marl\"\u2014thus, \"town on chalk\". However more recent research, from geographer John Everett-Heath, identifies the original Anglo-Saxon place name as Merleberge, with a derivation from either the personal name of M\u00e6rle combined with  beorg (hill), or meargealla beorg: hill where gentian grows. On John Speed's map of Wiltshire (1611), the town's name is recorded as Marlinges boroe.
