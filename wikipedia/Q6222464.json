Mr Craw was a Greek and Latin scholar, and Somerville asked him to purchase elementary books on algebra and geometry for her. He presented Somerville with Euclid's Elements and Algebra by John Bonnycastle. Somerville would rise early to play the piano, painted during the day, and stayed up late to study Euclid and algebra. When the family friend Lord Balmuto invited her to visit his family, Somerville first saw a laboratory. She also spent some time with the Oswalds family in Dunnikeir.

On the left margin stands a tree, one of its branches arching over the man, another extending up the margin and dividing the text from the header above it. || From Copy L. The man measuring the triangle refers to the concept of \"the Ratio\" as mentioned in the text. \"Ratio\" is from the Latin for \"Reason\" (\"Rationis\"), and for Harold Bloom, \"Ratio, in Blake's use, means an abstract image or ghost of an object, which in the aggregate makes up the universe of death which is the natural experience of most men.\"Harold Bloom, \"Commentary\" in Erdman (1982: 894) Similarly, for Peter Otto, the plate depicts Nebuchadnezzar II as \"Locke's Reason, closed within the 'Closet' of the mind while the triangle is one of the simple ideas that in Locke\u2019s system provide the primary building blocks of knowledge.\"Otto (2006: 264) For Eaves, Essick and Viscomi, the plate depicts enslavement to \"abstract reason and bondage to material nature. The latter is emphasised by the barren tree and other vegetation that curve over the figure as though to entrap him.\" Essick sees the illustration as visual pun; the literal application of Reason to the earth (represented by the ground) itself.Bindman (1974: 32) David Bindman speculates that Blake may have been inspired in this image by an engraving he had done in 1782 after a Thomas Stothard design for the frontispiece of An Introduction to Mensuration by John Bonnycastle, which depicts a young child measuring some triangles.Bindman (1978: 467) Eaves, Essick and Viscomi suggest Blake may have been building on Raphael's depiction of Euclid in The School of Athens (1511). Blake himself would use this image as the basis for two of his later planographic prints, Nebuchadnezzar (where he mirrors the posture) and Newton (where he mirrors the action; both c.1795/1805).
