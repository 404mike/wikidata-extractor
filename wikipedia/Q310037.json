He initially struggled with Villa, and was loaned to Mallorca, Nottingham Forest and Bolton Wanderers. Hutton then enjoyed a renaissance with Villa, where his defensive exploits earned him the moniker \"The Scottish Cafu\". He left the club after helping them win promotion in 2019.\nHutton made 50 appearances for the Scotland national team between 2007 and 2016. He was also shortlisted for selection to the Great Britain Olympic football team for the London 2012 Olympics, but did not make the final squad.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "November 30", "response": ["*  1984   \u2013 Alan Hutton, Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "1984", "response": ["* November 30 \u2013 Alan Hutton, Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "Rangers F.C.", "response": ["*  Alan Hutton \u2013 2016 Inductee, 50 Caps"]}, {"page": "DaMarcus Beasley", "response": ["On October 2, 2007, Beasley was influential in Rangers 3\u20130 win against Lyon in the Champions League group stage.
