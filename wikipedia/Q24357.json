Professor Jaggat is first mentioned by Kemp in the final episode of the first series, and is constantly referred to by both Kemp and Lloyd in the first two episodes of the second series. At the end of episode 3 Professor Jaggat is revealed to be Lucy, a doctor who has recently moved to Bristol and who has been forging a close relationship with Mitchell since episode 1 of Series 2. Despite Kemp's own prejudices against the supernatural, Lucy appears to be more willing to treat them as humans, believing Mitchell's claims that he is trying to go clean from blood- although he initially didn't explicitly reveal his vampire status to her, simply saying that he is trying to get past something- and normalising the pressure in the hyperbaric chamber when Nina is inside to save her life. When Mitchell finally revealed his true identity to her, the two actually slept together. Lucy's subsequent guilt about the liaison drove her to contact Kemp and reveal the location of a vampire stronghold, allowing Kemp to kill over thirty vampires with a bomb. Her betrayal left Mitchell disgusted with humanity, and sent him on a bloody rampage. In the Series Two finale, Mitchell was about to kill her, when Kemp dragged Annie through the door, and she was sent to the afterlife. Presumably he felt a painful reaction at her leaving (due to the fact he'd gotten so attached to her) and crumpled to the floor in pain, crawling away from Lucy and towards Kemp. Lucy is last seen at the very end of the series, walking up to Mitchell in the street. She attempts to apologise, but Mitchell refuses, distraught at the loss of Annie- he blames her partly for what happened, calling her a monster. He does however let her stay. George wakes in the night to hear Lucy scream- and he finds she'd been killed by Kemp, who had presumably gone mad (or even madder than he had been to begin with).
