Sidlow with Charlie Ashcroft and Ray Minshull were the goalkeepers vying for the number one jersey at Anfield for the 1946/47 season; the first competitive  season following the war. Even with the competition, Sidlow was given the position, which he held for 34 of the 42 games in a season that saw Liverpool win their first championship for 24 years. Much of which is owed to Sidlow as the final game of the season was a must win for the Reds. Sidlow's former employers Wolves needed just a point to win the title and Liverpool had to face them at Molineux. the Reds were a point back on their hosts and, needed a victory to win the league title.

Later in March, after he scored a 47th-minute header against Reading at Anfield, he became the first Liverpool player since Robbie Fowler in the 1995\u201396 season to score 20 league goals in a season. In April, he scored another Champions League goal, this time against Arsenal in the quarter-final second leg, as Liverpool advanced to the semi-final. This goal took him onto 29 goals for the 2007\u201308 season in all competitions, eclipsing Michael Owen's personal record for goals in a season. On 11 April 2008, it was announced Torres had made a six-man shortlist for the PFA Players' Player of the Year award, which was eventually won by Cristiano Ronaldo of Manchester United. The Spanish international was also nominated for the PFA Young Player of the Year Award, which was won by Cesc F\u00e0bregas of Arsenal and was named in the PFA Team of the Year.
