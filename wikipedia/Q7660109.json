He first played for Somerset in two matches within a week in 1912, but achieved little in them. In 1919, he returned to the team as a professional for four matches, during which he both made his highest first-class score and had his best bowling return. In the match against Gloucestershire at County Ground, Taunton, in which Sydney Rippon played for Somerset under a false name, Hardy made 38, batting at No 10 and adding 58 for the ninth wicket with his captain, Jack White. Against Surrey, he took four first-innings wickets for 22 runs. In his four matches in 1919, Hardy took 18 first-class wickets at an average of 13 runs per wicket to be top of the Somerset averages for the season."]}, {"page": "List of Gentlemen cricketers (1841\u20131962)", "response": ["* Sydney Rippon (1928)"]}]}}
