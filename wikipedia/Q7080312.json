The prime mover was Rev. Ebenezer Richard, minister at Tregaron and father of peace campaigner Henry Richard, with his trustees, and the land was provided by John Jones, the then farmer at Nant-llwyd lower down the valley of the river Camddwr. It served the people of the sheep farms for several miles round about. The congregation had fallen to 2 in 1968 and Soar was threatened with closure, but since 1973 its status has been secured. Since its formal reopening in that year, publicity has meant that some well-attended summer services with visiting preachers are now held on the last Sunday in August. The chapel also now attracts artistic attention; it was painted for example by Ogwyn Davies in 1993,http://croeso.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2007/08/23/ogwyn_davies_soar_y_mynydd.jpg); see also http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/midwales/hi/people_and_places/arts_and_culture/newsid_8654000/8654823.stm and has featured in poems for example by Harri Webb and Iwan Llwyd.:cy:Iwan Llwyd"]}, {"page": "2015 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Ogwyn Davies, 90, painter."]}, {"page": "Deaths in December 2015", "response": ["*Ogwyn Davies, 90, Welsh painter."]}, {"page": "Ogwyn", "response": ["*Ogwyn Davies (1925\u20132015), Welsh artist"]}]}}
