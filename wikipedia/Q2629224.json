A 1\u20131 away draw to Guatemala was key in allowing them to eliminate Los Chapines in the first round group. The second round was also closely contested, in part as this Canadian squad was strong defensively but had limited ability to score goals. The Canucks managed to eke out a 1\u20130 away win over Honduras, thanks to a George Pakos winner, hold Costa Rica scoreless in San Jos\u00e9, and then in their final game, one they needed to draw to qualify, beat Los Catrachos a second time, 2\u20131 in St. John's, Newfoundland, with Pakos and Igor Vrablic the goal scorers.
