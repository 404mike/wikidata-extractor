After a lineup change which saw original guitarist Mick Abrahams replaced by Martin Barre, the band released the folk-tinged second album Stand Up (1969). Stand Up saw the band achieve their first commercial success, reaching No. 1 in the UK, followed by regular tours of the UK and the US. Their musical style shifted in the direction of progressive rock with the albums Aqualung (1971), Thick as a Brick (1972) and A Passion Play (1973), and shifted again to contemporary folk rock with Songs from the Wood (1977), Heavy Horses (1978) and Stormwatch (1979). In the early 1980s the band underwent a major lineup change and shifted towards electronic rock, with the albums A (1980), The Broadsword and the Beast (1982) and Under Wraps (1984). The band won their sole Grammy Award for the 1987 album Crest of a Knave, which saw them returning to a hard rock style. Jethro Tull have sold an estimated 60\u00a0million albums worldwide, with 11 gold and five platinum albums among them. They have been described by Rolling Stone as \"one of the most commercially successful and eccentric progressive rock bands\".", "In November 1967 the band moved from the north of England subsequently basing themselves in Luton Bedfordshire, which is 43 miles from central London. They signed a management deal with Terry Ellis and Chris Wright and replaced Smith with guitarist Mick Abrahams, but quickly realised that supporting a 6-piece band was financially impractical, and the group split up. Anderson, Abrahams and Cornick decided to stay together, recruiting Abrahams' friend Clive Bunker on drums and becoming a British blues band. Cornick recalled that although Evan left, the band said he was welcome to rejoin at a later date. Anderson shared a ground-floor flat with Cornick in a large house at the top of Studley Road in Luton,Zigzag, July 1976 and worked as a cleaner for the Luton Ritz Cinema to pay the rent.BBC Radio interview, March 1979 According to Cornick, \"we were so poor that we would share one can of stew or soup between us each evening.\"", "* Mick Abrahams\u00a0\u2013 guitar, vocals (1967\u20131968)"]}, {"page": "1943 in music", "response": ["*April 7 \u2013 Mick Abrahams, guitarist (Jethro Tull)"]}, {"page": "Mick", "response": ["* Mick Abrahams (born 1943), English guitarist and band leader, original guitarist for Jethro Tull"]}, {"page": "Chrysalis Records", "response": ["* Mick Abrahams/Mick Abrahams Band"]}, {"page": "This Was", "response": ["This Was is the debut studio album by the British rock band Jethro Tull, released in 1968.

It was the first Jethro Tull album to feature guitarist Martin Barre, who would go on to become the band's longtime guitarist until its initial dissolution in 2012.  Before recording sessions for the album began, the band's original guitarist Mick Abrahams departed the band as a result of musical differences with frontman and primary songwriter Ian Anderson; Abrahams wanted to stay with the blues rock sound of their 1968 debut, This Was, while Anderson wished to add other musical influences such as folk rock.", "Jethro Tull released their debut album This Was in October 1968. During the recording of This Was, frontman Ian Anderson began writing new material which differed from the straight blues/jazz fusion style which the band were known for at the time. Anderson estimated that he wrote \"50 percent\" of Stand Up during the summer of 1968. Anderson wrote the album's songs on an acoustic guitar in his bedsit in Kentish Town, London, and cited Roy Harper, Ornette Coleman, Charlie Parker, Bert Jansch, Pentangle, Blind Faith and Jimi Hendrix as inspirations. The new material's departure from the band's blues-based style caused conflict with guitarist Mick Abrahams, who was a blues purist: Anderson recalled \"running some of [the new songs] by Mick Abrahams, and coming to the conclusion that they weren't going up to be up his street at all\" while drummer Clive Bunker stated that \"when Ian started to write new and different stuff, that's when we realised we were going to have serious problems, because Mick just didn't want to do it.\" The stylistic clash resulted in Abrahams' departure from the band in December 1968. The band initially began rehearsals for Stand Up with Black Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi, however Iommi left the band after only a few weeks as he felt he did not fit in well with the group. The job eventually went to Martin Barre, who immediately joined rehearsals for Stand Up before making his live debut with the band on 30 December 1968.", "Anderson has described the album's lyrics as composing of a mixture of made up scenarios, occasionally mixed with biographical anecdotes or experiences from his personal life. Songs like \"Back to the Family\" and \"For a Thousand Mothers\" were influenced by Anderson's rocky relationship with his parents at the time, while \"We Used to Know\" describes the band's difficult life of financial hardship before finding success. Anderson has denied that songs concerning relationships such as \"A New Day Yesterday\", \"Look Into the Sun\" and \"Reasons for Waiting\" were inspired by real life experiences, saying that \"I've always had a feeling that you don't talk about real stuff when it comes to that, and that you shouldn't betray real relationships in songs.\" Anderson wrote \"Fat Man\" as a reference to former guitarist Mick Abrahams (who was the largest member of the group), however Anderson has denied that the song was intended as an insult. \"Jeffrey Goes to Leicester Square\" references Anderson's friend Jeffrey Hammond, who was also referenced on This Was and would later join Jethro Tull as bassist in 1970."]}, {"page": "Rock festival", "response": ["|style=\"text-align:left\"|Saturday 28 June 1969.

Coincidentally this is also the first live footage of Jethro Tull ever made; no footage of the original line-up with Abrahams (December 1967 \u2013 December 1968) is known to exist. The band mimed to the album version of \"A Song for Jeffrey\" and \"Fat Man,\" so the guitar heard is actually Abrahams, and not Iommi, who may not have known his part sufficiently after only a few days in the band. The Rolling Stones forced them to cut their rehearsal time short, although Ian Anderson sings and plays flute live on \"A Song For Jeffrey\". \"Fat Man\" never made the final release, although it is not unreasonable to assume he also sang that live, as the released version (which appears on Stand Up) was not recorded until four months later.
