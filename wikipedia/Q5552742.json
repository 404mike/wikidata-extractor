Adams made his debut for the \"Saints\" on 25 March 1989, taking Derek Statham's place at left-back in a 3\u20131 defeat by Arsenal. Adams retained his place for the next seven games, before losing out to Gerry Forrest for the last few matches of the season. Adams played the first seven matches of the 1989\u201390 season before losing his place through injury to Francis Benali, who then began to form a useful full-back partnership with Jason Dodd. In April 1990, Adams was recalled alongside new signing Oleksiy Cherednyk and they played out the remainder of the season together."]}, {"page": "Ray Wallace (footballer)", "response": ["On 22 October 1988, he made his Southampton debut, replacing Gerry Forrest at The Dell against Sheffield Wednesday alongside his two brothers; this was the first time three brothers had played in the same team in the Football League First Division for 67 years. He was a virtual ever-present until September 1989, when he lost his place to Jason Dodd through suspension, after which he played only once more for the Saints. While a Southampton player, he won four caps for the England under-21 team."]}, {"page": "Tim Parkin", "response": ["He moved onto Darlington, where he was made player-coach. The \"Quakers\" finished 15th in the Third Division in 1992\u201393. Parkin took caretaker control of the team in October 1993 (with Gerry Forrest) when Billy McEwan was dismissed; Forrest and Parkin took charge of the first-team for four matches before Alan Murray took over permanently. Murray could only take the club to one place above the bottom of the English Football League in 1993\u201394. Parkin departed Feethams and moved on to Barrow of the Northern Premier League in November 1993, where he was made player-assistant manager, before retiring as a player following a broken leg."]}, {"page": "Steve Baker (footballer, born 1962)", "response": ["With Yugoslavia international Ivan Golac well established at right-back, Baker found first-team opportunities at The Dell rare, with only 20 appearances over the next three seasons, and in February 1984 he went on loan to Burnley, where he made ten Third Division appearances. He made his debut for Burnley in a 4\u20130 win over Lincoln City on 25 February 1984. Club manager John Bond made an offer to sign Baker on a permanent deal, but the bid was rejected by Southampton, and his loan spell was ended. By the start of the 1984\u201385 season, former England captain Mick Mills was now a permanent fixture at right-back, and Baker's few appearances came on the right wing. After Mills' departure, Golac returned briefly, before Baker regained the right-back position in September 1985. After a run of ten matches, new signing Gerry Forrest took over in December, with Baker again restricted to occasional appearances, often as a substitute."]}, {"page": "PFA Team of the Year (1980s)", "response": ["!scope=row|Gerry Forrest", "!scope=row|Gerry Forrest"]}]}}
