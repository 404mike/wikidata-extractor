Her fourth novel, A Different Face, was published in 1953. Set in a drab city based on Manning's hometown of Portsmouth, it chronicled the main character's attempts to leave his birthplace. The book was not well-reviewed, and as was frequently the case, Manning felt slighted, feeling that she did not get the reviews she deserved. Neurotic self-doubt and perfectionism made her difficult and easily offended, and she was very aware of younger writers outstripping her. Such an author was Iris Murdoch, with whom Manning shared an interest in flying saucers and an uneasy friendship that was tinged with jealousy at the younger Murdoch's greater success. Manning knew that she was spiteful, but could not help herself, frequently critiquing writer friends to others. She consistently praised and admired Ivy Compton-Burnett to whom she had been introduced in 1945, and whose friendship she greatly valued. She complained about her publisher Heinemann and her lack of recognition from her peers: Anthony Powell called her \"the world's worst grumbler\", and the publisher remembered that she was \"never an easy author to handle\". A friend gave her the nickname \"Olivia Moaning\", which was picked up by others, much to Manning's annoyance."]}, {"page": "Pamela Hansford Johnson", "response": ["*Ivy Compton-Burnett (Writers and their Work Series) (1951)"]}, {"page": "Dolores", "response": ["* Dolores, a 1911 novel by Ivy Compton-Burnett"]}, {"page": "Cicely Hamilton", "response": ["In 1908 she and Bessie Hatton founded the Women Writers' Suffrage League.
