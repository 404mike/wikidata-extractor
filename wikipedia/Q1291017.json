The band have never achieved the great commercial success that was widely predicted for them at the beginning of their career, but are nevertheless considered a key part of the Canterbury scene of progressive rock acts, blending psychedelic rock, jazz, and classical influences to create a distinctive sound.", "The group's original members, David Sinclair, Richard Sinclair, Pye Hastings and Richard Coughlan had all been in the Canterbury-based Wilde Flowers, albeit not at the same time. Richard Sinclair had been an early member, but left in September 1965 to study at college. Hastings had replaced Robert Wyatt as the group's singer and Coughlan as drummer in the band when Wyatt, who performed both roles, formed Soft Machine. David Sinclair joined the group in late 1966, but after future Soft Machine member Hugh Hopper left the group in June the following year, they began to run out of momentum and broke up in October 1967.", "In 2010, Pye Hastings announced that the band had resumed activity in anticipation of a one-off concert recording at Metropolis Studios for ITV, which took place in December 2010. New material was written for a debut performance and the band was joined by Mark Walker on drums and percussion, as Richard Coughlan, whilst still a member of the band, was too ill to tour with the group.  The DVD of this gig was released in May 2011 and the recording was shown on ITV as part of the Legends series.", "Caravan are considered a key example of the Canterbury scene genre. Their records generally indicate a jazz influence, and the group's lyrics have been described as whimsical and very \"English\", particularly during Richard Sinclair's tenure in the band. Following Sinclair's departure, the musical direction has been predominantly led by Pye Hastings, who preferred a softer pop rock approach. Though the group share a common history with Soft Machine, they have been considered more melodic and closer to folk music and frequently displaying a sense of humour. The group were predominantly album-oriented, but Hastings believes the group recorded enough straightforward pop that could have been hit singles if the record company had taken sufficient interest.", "* Pye Hastings \u2013 guitar, vocals (1968\u20131978, 1980\u20131985, 1990\u20131992, 1995\u2013present)", "* Pye Hastings  \u2013  guitar, vocals", "* Pye Hastings \u2013 guitar, vocals", "* Pye Hastings \u2013 guitar, vocals", "* Pye Hastings \u2013 guitar, vocals", "* Pye Hastings \u2013 guitar, vocals", "* Pye Hastings \u2013 guitar, vocals", "* Pye Hastings \u2013 guitar, vocals", "* Pye Hastings \u2013 guitar, vocals", "* Pye Hastings \u2013 guitar, vocals", "* Pye Hastings \u2013 guitar, vocals", "* Pye Hastings \u2013 guitar, vocals", "* Pye Hastings \u2013 guitar, vocals", "* Pye Hastings \u2013 guitar, vocals", "* Pye Hastings \u2013 guitar, vocals", "* Pye Hastings \u2013 guitar, vocals", "* Pye Hastings \u2013 guitar, vocals", "* Pye Hastings \u2013 guitar, vocals", "* Pye Hastings \u2013 guitar, vocals"]}, {"page": "Third (Soft Machine album)", "response": ["Lyn Dobson appears on saxophone and flute on \"Facelift\", recorded while he was a full member of the band (then a quintet), although he is credited as an additional performer.

Bassist Richard Sinclair had written \"Golf Girl\", a song about his girlfriend and future wife. Both songs were written in a straightforward pop style, in contrast to some longer pieces on the album. Keyboardist David Sinclair had composed a number of different musical segments that he wanted to link together to a suite of songs. The group helped with the arranging and joining of sections, resulting in a 22-minute piece, \"Nine Feet Underground\".

Over the course of Caravan's first three albums he developed his playing enormously on his favoured model of Hammond organ, the A100 (similar in configuration and features to the B3 and C3 models, but slightly smaller in overall bulk), culminating in his soaring work on what is perhaps their most celebrated album, In the Land of Grey and Pink (1971). Calyx, The Canterbury Website, compiled by the French music expert Aymeric Leroy, refers to him as \"master of the typical Canterbury organ sound/playing\".
