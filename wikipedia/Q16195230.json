Tawleed is the process of giving a new shade of meaning to an old classical word. For example, al-hatif lexicographically, means the one whose sound is heard but whose person remains unseen. Now the term al-hatif is used for a telephone. Therefore, the process of tawleed can express the needs of modern civilization in a manner that would appear to be originally Arabic. In the case of Arabic, educated Arabs of any nationality can be assumed to speak both their school-taught Standard Arabic as well as their native dialects, which depending on the region may be mutually unintelligible.Janet C.E. Watson, The Phonology and Morphology of Arabic , Introduction, p. xix. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2007.

Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO, 2009.  Some of these dialects can be considered to constitute separate languages which may have \u201csub-dialects\u201d of their own.Walter J. Ong, Interfaces of the Word: Studies in the Evolution of Consciousness and Culture , p. 32. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2012.  When educated Arabs of different dialects engage in conversation (for example, a Moroccan speaking with a Lebanese), many speakers code-switch back and forth between the dialectal and standard varieties of the language, sometimes even within the same sentence. Arabic speakers often improve their familiarity with other dialects via music or film."]}, {"page": "Republic of Tunisia International Prize for Islamic Studies", "response": ["*Sixth World Award, Awarded September 26, 2008 to Dr. Rawnak Hassen Hosni, professor at the University of Heriot and at the University of Durham, Great Britain and to Professor Daniel Newman, professor at the Modern Languages and Cultures school at the University of Durham."]}, {"page": "Daniel Newman", "response": ["Daniel Newman may refer to:", "* Daniel Newman (American actor) (born 1981), American actor, model and musician", "* Daniel Newman (British actor) (born 1976), British actor", "* Daniel Newman (academic) (born 1963), British writer, scholar and translator of Arabic literature", "* Daniel Newman (politician), New Zealand politician on Auckland Council"]}, {"page": "Mac transition to Apple silicon", "response": ["In June 2020, tech analyst Daniel Newman estimated that Apple accounted for $1.5 billion to $3.0 billion (about 2% to 4%) of Intel's annual revenue, and only 6.9% to 12% of the PC market in the United States and 7% globally.
