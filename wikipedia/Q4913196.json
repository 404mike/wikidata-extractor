He appeared in the Football League for Coventry City, Blackpool, Plymouth Argyle, Carlisle United, Wolverhampton Wanderers, Newcastle United, Portsmouth and AFC Bournemouth, scoring 145 goals in 468 matches. He finished his career in Portugal with spells at Louletano and Farense.\nRafferty began his league career with Coventry City after joining them from Port Glasgow but found opportunities few and far between. A move to Blackpool in 1972 saw him play and score more regularly before joining Plymouth Argyle a year later. With his striking partner, Paul Mariner, he became an important player in the Argyle side that won promotion to the Football League Second Division in 1975. Their partnership contributed 47 goals to the campaign, with Rafferty scoring 26.\nHe then joined Carlisle United where he continued to score regularly. He moved on to Wolverhampton Wanderers and Newcastle United. After Newcastle he joined Portsmouth in 1980. At Portsmouth, Rafferty once again became a key striker, winning the Third Division championship in 1983 before joining AFC Bournemouth, which would be his last league club in England.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2003\u201304 Plymouth Argyle F.C. season", "response": ["*17 January 2004: Billy Rafferty and Paul Mariner make a guest appearance at Home Park.

During a reserve team game in 1981, Johnson was knocked unconscious in a collision with teammate Neil Hards. He suffered a fractured cheekbone and damage to both eyes, which required surgery and his jawbone to be wired up.
