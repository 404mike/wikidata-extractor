Mariner scored two and Les Tibbott one in the second leg as the sides drew 3\u20133, ensuring Ipswich progressed to the third round to face Barcelona.  The first leg, played at Portman Road, was a relatively one-sided affair, with Ipswich focused on closing down the creative midfielder Johan Cruyff.  Three goals, from Gates, Whymark and Talbot, all from crosses made by Woods, ensured that Ipswich ran out 3\u20130 winners.  In something of a repeat of the events in Bruges two years prior, Barcelona overcame the first leg deficit with two goals from Cruyff and a penalty from Carles Rexach making the aggregate score 3\u20133 and sending the game to a penalty shootout.  Pedro Artola saved attempts from both Talbot and Hunter, and Ipswich were eliminated from the contest, losing 3\u20131."]}, {"page": "Ipswich Town F.C.
