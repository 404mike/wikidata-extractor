Bowden designed the coachwork of Healey's Elliott, an influential British sports car. He was also the designer of the Spacelander, a space-age bicycle which was commercially unsuccessful when in production, but has since become a collector's item.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Donald Healey", "response": ["In 1949, Healey established an agreement with George W. Mason, the president of Nash Motors to build Nash-engined Healey sports cars. The first series of the 2-seaters were built in 1951 and they were designed by Healey with styling and aerodynamic input from Benjamin Bowden. The same all-enveloping theme was used by Bowden on the Zethrin Rennsport one year later. The Nash-Healey's engine was a Nash Ambassador 6-cylinder, the body was aluminium, and the chassis was a Healey Silverstone. However, Pininfarina restyled the bodywork for 1952 and took over the production of its new steel body."]}, {"page": "Donald Healey Motor Company", "response": ["When it was introduced in 1948, the Elliott saloon was claimed to be the fastest production closed car in the world, timed at 104.7\u00a0mph over a mile. The aerodynamic body design was the work of Benjamin Bowden and unusually for the time it was tested in a wind tunnel to refine its efficiency. This was the start of aerodynamic styling for reduced drag, that culminated in Bowden's last UK offering, the Zethrin Rennsport. In 1949 the most sporting of all the Healeys, the Silverstone, was announced. It had a shorter chassis and stiffer springing and was capable of 107\u00a0mph. It is now a highly sought after car and many of the other Healeys have been converted into Silverstone replicas. These cars had numerous competition successes including class wins in the 1947 and 1948 Alpine rallies and the 1949 Mille Miglia."]}, {"page": "Squire Car Manufacturing Company", "response": ["After the war Val Zethrin pursued a new project, an updated and simplified attempt at the Squire concept, called the Zethrin Rennsport. The reliability and cost of the R1 Anzani engine had always been an issue, and post-war conditions rendered it unthinkable. Through Benjamin Bowden and John Allen's design company, contact was made with Donald Healey, who recommended using a souped up Riley Motor engine, as he had employed in the Healey-Abbott\u00b7 Suspension and modified frame from the Riley stable provided the back-bone for what was to be an interesting but doomed venture.Car and Driver Magazine October 1967 180\u00a0bhp from the heavily modified engine was forecast, coupled to a fairly advanced body, suggesting that a 135\u00a0mph maximum speed was achievable. It seems that this project went little further than a road-going prototype with rudimentary bodywork. Zethrin did not have the technical expertise of Adrian Squire, and failed to ensure sufficient industry interest in what seemed a flight of fancy, in an era of austerity. Lack of funds and backers falling away put paid to the Rennsport becoming available for purchase."]}, {"page": "Bowden (surname)", "response": ["* Benjamin Bowden (1906\u20131998), English automobile and bicycle designer"]}, {"page": "Valfried Zethrin", "response": ["Through the good offices of the Allen-Bowden design company, contact was made with Donald Healey, who recommended using a souped up Riley Motorrileyrob.co.uk/specials/index.htm engine, as he had employed in the Healey-Abbott, with all-enveloping bodywork designed by Benjamin Bowden.

Bowden named the design the Spacelander; it entered production in 1960 and sold for $89.50. Only 522 Spacelander bicycles were made in the original run. By the 1990s only a few dozen were estimated to have survived. Morrow collected 17 of the proposed 38 left in the world. The Bowden Spacelanders are some rarest bicycles in the museum.
