Philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau wrote it was \"manifestly contrary to the law of nature... that a handful of people should gorge themselves with superfluities while the hungry multitude goes in want of necessities.\""]}, {"page": "Eva Per\u00f3n", "response": ["In his essay titled \"Latin America\" published in The Oxford Illustrated History of Christianity, John McManners claims that the appeal and success of Eva Per\u00f3n are related to Latin American mythology and concepts of divinity.

American historian George V. Taylor's research established that the bourgeoisie of the Third Estate were not quite the budding capitalists they were made out to be; indeed Taylor showed the aristocrats were just as entrepreneurial if not more so. John McManners, Jean Egret, Franklin Ford and others wrote on the divided and complex situation of the nobility in pre-revolutionary France. The most significant opposition to arise in France was that of Annales historians Fran\u00e7ois Furet, Denis Richet, and Mona Ozouf. Furet in the 1960s worked in terms of the Annales School, which locates the 1789 revolution in a \"long\" history of 19th century revolutionary France."]}, {"page": "St Chad's College, Durham", "response": ["File:Portrait John McManners.jpg|John McManners, clergyman, historian of religion, and Regius Professor of Ecclesiastical History at the University of Oxford", "* John McManners, Regius Professor of Ecclesiastical History at Oxford and winner of the Wolfson History Prize"]}, {"page": "Unigenitus", "response": ["According to John McManners, \"The complicated diplomatic manoeuvring leading to its promulgation was prompted by the Jesuits and their sympathizers, enemies of Noailles, and by the aged Louis XIV, which wished to destroy the Jansenists as \u2018a republican party in Church and State\u2019, while upholding the independence of the Gallican Church.\"McManners, John.

The Chinese emperor felt duped and refused to permit any alteration of existing Christian practices.
