He was born at Dewsbury in Yorkshire.\nSmith was an effective swing bowler for Gloucestershire, and played a single Test for England at Headingley in 1997 against Australia. Graham Thorpe dropped Matthew Elliott at first slip while on 29, for what would have been Smith's first (and only) Test wicket. Elliot went on to make 199 and Australia won comfortably by an innings.\nHe was never played for England again, but remained one of the most consistent swing bowlers on the county circuit until his retirement in 2003. He later worked as an employment solicitor at Bevan Brittan in Bristol.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Michael Smith", "response": ["Michael Smith or Mike Smith may refer to:", "* Mike Smith (actor) (born 1972), Canadian actor, screenwriter, comedian and musician", "* Mike Smith (jazz saxophonist) (born 1957), American jazz saxophonist", "* Mike Smith (singer-songwriter) (born 1939), American singer-songwriter", "* Mike Smith (Dave Clark Five) (1943\u20132008), English singer-songwriter", "* Mike Smith (drummer) (born 1970), American drummer for Suffocation", "* Mike Smith (guitarist) (born 1973), American guitarist for Limp Bizkit", "* Mike Smith (record producer), Cuban American record producer and musician", "* Mike Smith (saxophonist), English saxophonist for The Ailerons", "* Mike Smith (born 1947), Welsh saxophonist (Amen Corner)", "* Mike Smith (music executive), managing director of Columbia Records UK", "*Mike Smith (Louisiana politician) (born 1948), former Louisiana state senator, member of the Long family", "*Mike Smith (Nova Scotia politician), mayor of Colchester County, Nova Scotia, Canada", "* Mike Smith (broadcaster) (1955\u20132014), English television and radio presenter", "*Mike Smith (American football coach) (born 1959), former head coach of the NFL Atlanta Falcons", "*Mike Smith (linebacker) (born 1981), former NFL linebacker, current outside linebackers coach of the NFL Green Bay Packers", "*Mike Smith (wide receiver) (born 1958), former NFL wide receiver", "*Mike Smith (footballer, born 1935) (1935\u20132013), English defender for Derby County and Bradford City", "*Mike Smith (football manager) (born 1937), manager of Egypt and Wales national football teams and of Hull City", "*Mike Smith (1890s outfielder) (1868\u20131945), MLB outfielder from 1886 to 1901", "*Mike Smith (1920s outfielder) (1904\u20131981), MLB outfielder who played in the 1926 season", "*Mike Smith (1984\u201389 pitcher) (born 1961), National League pitcher from 1984 to 1989", "*Mike Smith (1989\u20131990 pitcher) (born 1963), American League pitcher from 1989 to 1990", "*Mike Smith (infielder) (born 1969), Rotary Smith Award winner", "*Mike Smith (2000s pitcher) (born 1977), MLB pitcher in the 2000s", "*Mike Smith (basketball, born 1963), former professional basketball player from the University of South Carolina-Spartanburg", "*Mike Smith (basketball, born 1976), professional basketball player from West Monroe, Louisiana", "*Mike Smith (basketball, born 1987), professional basketball player from East Tennessee State University", "*Mike Smith (basketball, born 1997), college basketball player for the Michigan Wolverines", "*Mike Smith (Australian cricketer) (born 1973), Australian cricketer", "*Mike Smith (Scottish cricketer) (born 1966), Scottish cricketer", "*Mike Smith (cricketer, born 1967), Gloucestershire CCC and England cricketer", "* Mike Smith (rugby league), in the 1970s, and 1980s for Great Britain and Hull Kingston Rovers", "* Mike Smith (ice hockey, born 1945), general manager for Winnipeg Jets and Chicago Blackhawks", "* Mike Smith (ice hockey, born 1982), Canadian goaltender for the Edmonton Oilers", "* Mike Smith (decathlete) (born 1967), Canadian silver medalist at 1991 World Championships in Athletics", "* Mike Smith (softball), head coach of the Ole Miss Rebels softball team"]}, {"page": "Tim Munton", "response": ["Over the 1995/6 winter, Munton was called up to Nasser Hussain's England A side for their tour of Pakistan as a replacement for Gloucestershire bowler Mike Smith, who flew home with a rib injury.Wisden 1997, pp. 1076-77 In his first appearance on the tour he took 5/54 in the first innings in a first-class fixture against the PCB Patron's XI, including four wickets in 13 balls, and took 2/13 in 11 overs in the second innings.Wisden 1997, p. 1082 This performance earned him a place in the second A team Test against Pakistan A, in which he finished with match figures of 2/49 in a rain-shortened fixture.Wisden 1997, p. 1083 He  was replaced in the side for the third and final A team Test, which was also the last first class match of a tour which was criticised by Wisden for the paucity of cricket played."]}, {"page": "Jason Lewry", "response": ["Lewry returned to cricket in 1998, and in a match against Gloucestershire, he took a hat-trick with deliveries in two innings.
