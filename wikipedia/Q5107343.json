He led Southampton to the 2003 FA Cup Final, which they lost 1\u20130 to Arsenal.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Neil Warnock", "response": ["Warnock was quick to inject new blood into the Terriers' side, snapping up goalkeeper Steve Francis, Darren Bullock, Ronnie Jepson, Tom Cowan and Pat Scully during his first season, all of whom would go on to become mainstays in the 1994\u201395 promotion season. He also showed faith in Centre of Excellence products such as Chris Billy, Simon Baldry and Andy Booth \u2013 a player then struggling to make the breakthrough who would go on to become a club legend in modern times. Despite these acquisitions, Town struggled for most of the 1993\u201394 season, their last at Leeds Road, and Warnock was quick to offload fan favourites Iwan Roberts, Iffy Onoura and Chris Marsden while introducing a more direct style of play. The run to the 1994 Football League Trophy Final (lost on penalties to Swansea City) coincided with an upturn in league form and a mass optimism further bolstered by the move to the new Alfred McAlpine Stadium for the 1994\u201395 season. Warnock's side won the Yorkshire Electricity Cup in late 1994. Warnock's side were genuine contenders for automatic promotion until falling away in the final few games to finish 5th (the final play-off spot that season owing to league re-structuring). They triumphed on penalties over second-placed Brentford after two thrilling ties and went on to beat Bristol Rovers at Wembley Stadium. He quit Huddersfield just days after their promotion, but made a swift and surprising return to management at Plymouth Argyle, who had just been relegated to Division Three."]}, {"page": "Chris marsden", "response": ["#REDIRECT Chris Marsden"]}, {"page": "Lee Bullen", "response": ["After leading Dunfermline to the Scottish Cup Final, Bullen moved to English club Sheffield Wednesday on a free transfer in the summer of 2004. He immediately became an integral part of their play-off push after making his debut on 7 August in a 3\u20130 defeat on the opening day of the season at Hillsborough against Colchester United and scoring his first goal the next game on 10 August, away at Blackpool to lead the team to a 2\u20131 victory. In November 2005 the Captain's armband was passed onto him by Chris Marsden who was forced into retirement by injury. Bullen finished his first season in Sheffield with seven league goals."]}, {"page": "Carlton Palmer", "response": ["In September 1997 he was signed by Southampton manager Dave Jones for a fee of \u00a31.0 million. In the dressing room he was \"abrasive, awkward and argumentative\" but on the pitch he was \"determined, hard-working and persistent\" and his long legs made him \"a most difficult player to compete against\". Jones said of Palmer \"He covers every blade of grass out there, but that's only because his first touch is so crap\". In January 1999 he was transferred to Nottingham Forest for a fee of \u00a31.1 million and was replaced in Southampton's midfield by Chris Marsden."]}]}}
