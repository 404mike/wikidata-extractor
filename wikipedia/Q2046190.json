Those in his possession appear to have been destroyed after his death by Miss Berry, who printed fragments from them as footnotes to the edition of 1810. The correspondence between Walpole and Madame du Deffand thus remains one-sided, but seven of Walpole's letters to her were printed for the first time in the edition (1903) of his correspondence by Mrs Paget Toynbee, who discovered a quantity of her unedited letters.

There exist slightly different hypothesis of Giacomina\u2019s relationship with Alagia. Twentieth-century Dante scholar, Paget Toynbee indicates that Giacomina was Alagia\u2019s sister who was married to a Ferrarian marquis, Obizzo II di Este and was the mother of Beatrice di Este and Azzo VIII making Beatrice and Azzo VIII Alagia\u2019s niece and nephew respectively.
