He was one of eight children, all of whom grew up on the yacht Sibilla, which his British father, James Close, sailed on the Mediterranean and Adriatic Seas. Close lived on the yacht until he was five years old. His father was a banker and a business advisor to Ferdinand\u00a0II of the Two Sicilies. James taught his children based on his own ideals. Following Ferdinand\u00a0II's death in 1859, James retired and subsequently died of a heart attack in 1865 at the family home in Antibes, France. After his father's death, his French mother Anne Brooks sent Close and his three brothers to school in Marlborough, Wiltshire. From the time he was a child, Close grew up with the idea that a man can be a gentleman and earn money. Close later attended Wellington College and Trinity College, Cambridge.
