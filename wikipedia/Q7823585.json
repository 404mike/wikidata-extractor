He made a handful of appearances the following season, and scored his first goal, against Leeds United, in one of them. Towards the end of the season, he had a run in the first team, and was part of the team which won the 1970 European Cup Winners Cup scoring the winner in extra time against Portuguese club Athletico De Coimbria en route to the final. He became a first team regular in the 1970\u201371 season, acting as a utility player. He played as City won the 1972 FA Charity Shield. In 1972, under Malcolm Allison's management, Towers settled into a midfield role, usually wearing the number 11 shirt. He was part of the Manchester City side for the 1974 League Cup Final, but the final proved to be his penultimate game for the Manchester club, as two weeks later he transferred to Sunderland in an exchange deal involving Dennis Tueart and Mick Horswill.Towers made his Sunderland debut against Fulham in March 1974. His performances at Sunderland resulted in him receiving an England call-up in 1976 for the British Home Championship. He made appearances in the matches against Wales and Northern Ireland, and added a third cap two weeks later in a friendly against Italy.\nIn the 1977 close season Towers joined Birmingham City for a fee of \u00a3140,000. He made his Birmingham debut on 20 August 1977 in a 4\u20131 defeat to Manchester United. He made 92 League appearances for the club, the last coming in 1979\u201380. In 1981, Towers moved to the Montreal Manic of the North American Soccer League (NASL). He remained with Montreal through the 1983 season. He then began the 1984 season with the Tampa Bay Rowdies before being traded to the Vancouver Whitecaps, and then finishing his career back in England with Rochdale.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Montreal Manic", "response": ["*  Tony Towers (1981\u20131983)"]}, {"page": "List of Manchester City F.C. players", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Tony Towers||  || Midfielder || 1969\u20131974||165||12|| ||"]}, {"page": "1974 Football League Cup Final", "response": ["| ||6 || Tony Towers"]}, {"page": "1970 European Cup Winners' Cup Final", "response": ["|CM ||11 || Tony Towers"]}, {"page": "Manchester City F.C. in international football", "response": ["In the second round City travelled to Belgians Lierse S.K., and won the first leg 3\u20130, with two goals from Francis Lee and one from Colin Bell.James, The Big Book of City, p. 36.

The match finished goalless. At Maine Road, extra-time was required for Manchester City to break down the stubbornly defensive Coimbra.
