He was the acknowledged illegitimate son of Benjamin Franklin. William Franklin was the last colonial Governor of New Jersey (1763\u20131776), and a steadfast Loyalist throughout the American Revolutionary War. (In contrast, his father Benjamin was one of the most prominent of the Patriot leaders of the American Revolution and a Founding Father of the United States.)\nFollowing imprisonment by Patriots in 1776 to 1778, William became the chief leader of the Loyalists. From his base in New York City, he organized military units to fight on the British side. In 1782, he went into exile in Britain. He lived in London until his death.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
