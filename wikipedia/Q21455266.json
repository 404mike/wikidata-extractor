She was one of eight founding members who set up Glasgow Print Studio in 1972, while she was a student at Glasgow School of Art. In 1985 she set up the Paper Workshop in Glasgow. She studied papermaking in Barcelona with Laurence Barker and in Shiroishi, Japan, with Tadao Endo. Parry is Member of the Royal Scottish Academy. In 1984, Parry appeared in the BBC Scotland film 'The Lunch Party' (directed by Eleanor Aitken), in conversation with Liz Lochhead and Lys Hansen."]}]}}
