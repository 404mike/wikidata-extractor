On June 16 Ball State University released a report estimating that preliminary damages in the state would cost at least $126 million, with $45.8 million in damage to public infrastructure and the rest damage to private businesses and homes. Although damage estimates are likely to be revised upward, the current estimate ranks the flood as the second costliest in Indiana history. Governor Mitch Daniels said the state is compiling its own thorough estimates, with total damages expected to top $1 billion.  This would include agricultural costs (of over $800 million) and clean-up efforts not included in the Ball State University Study. The agricultural damages from this flood event varied dramatically since the timing of the flood permitted extensive replanting.  The joint Ball State University and University of Tennessee study by Mark Burton and Michael J. Hicks excluded not only agricultural damage in Indiana, but also did not include any large public structures (e.g. hospitals) located in flood plains."]}, {"page": "Iowa flood of 2008", "response": ["While the Great Flood of 1993 was greater in continental terms, in local Iowa terms, the June 2008 Midwest floods were considerably worse. Lessons learned in 1993, however, helped prevent or otherwise ameliorate damage, extensive as it was; one example is how the city of Des Moines raised its levee around its domestic water and sewage treatment plants. The extent of flooding in 2008 was probably less than during the Flood of 1851, but it is difficult to compare impacts of the two floods because of changes in population, economy, and land use. A study performed by Mark Burton at the University of Tennessee and Michael J. Hicks at Ball State University was based on post 1993 flood data.  However, the 2008 floods damaged key infrastructure outside of the model (e.g. the University of Iowa library) due both to changes in population and flood protection measures.  However, the Burton & Hicks study did identify crop damages at roughly $3 billion, which turned out to be very close to the actual damages.http://cms.bsu.edu/Academics/CentersandInstitutes/BBR/CurrentStudiesandPublications/disasterStudies.aspx"]}, {"page": "Indianapolis Business Journal", "response": ["Indianapolis Business Journal is a weekly newspaper published in Indianapolis, United States which reports on Central Indiana business.
