As the 1931 general election approached and the debate over the National Government raged, Evans was on the side of official Liberal group in Parliament led by Sir Herbert Samuel but he promised to support the National government of Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald on the basis of Macdonald\u2019s published manifesto and, despite the pledge of the Unionist candidate to do the same with the prospect of the splitting of the National vote,The Times, 27.10.31 this was enough to gain him the seat in a three-cornered contest,The Times, 19.10.31 although with hardly a safe majority of 1,214. Once elected Evans, although he called himself a free-trader, did initially support the government, voting for a Bill to authorise duties on abnormal imports, despite some declared misgivings.The Times, 19.11.31 However, in spite of this profession of loyalty to Macdonald, Evans soon crossed the floor to sit with the official Liberal group who were in opposition.The Times, 7.11.35 Nevertheless, his flirtation with the National Government had soured his relationship with Lloyd George. By 1934 Evans must have been having thoughts about the approaching general election because, according to the diary of Frances Stevenson he wrote to Lloyd George\u2019s principal private secretary, A J Sylvester, asking about a rumour he had heard that Lloyd George had told Daniel Hopkin, the former Labour MP for Carmarthen, that he would publicly support him at the next election and possibly even go down to Carmarthen to speak for him. Stevenson also records that Lloyd George thought Evans a man of limited gifts, with some oratorical skills but with only one good speech which he adapted to suit his audience. The speech apparently went down well in Wales but was coldly received in the House of Commons.", "Evans\u2019s drifting between support of and opposition to the National Government did not endear him to the Conservatives either and they decided to oppose him at the next general election in 1935. Evans\u2019s trying to ride two horses at once on the question of his support for the National Government extended into the election campaign itself. Once the Conservative candidate had put himself in the field, Evans put out a statement, undertaking to support Stanley Baldwin\u2019s administration. Had he done so earlier he might have attracted more National support but in the end Evans, who described himself on the ballot paper as a plain Liberal (rather than a Liberal National), lost by 1,942 votes to Labour candidate Daniel Hopkin, the man he had defeated in 1931."]}, {"page": "1928 Carmarthen by-election", "response": ["The Labour Party nominated Major Daniel Hopkin MC, a barrister who had been born in South Wales but educated locally at Carmarthen College."]}, {"page": "Courtenay Mansel", "response": ["Mond continued to sit for Carmarthen, now as a Conservative, until 1928 when he was given a peerage and went to the House of Lords as the first Baron Melchett.
