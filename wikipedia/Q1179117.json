The team played many internationals against the full representative sides of Europe, which were usually a mixture of amateur and professional players. The strength of the English amateur team meant they were still able to beat many of these sides and in fact they were unbeaten in 20 matches from 1906 to 1910. Whilst these England amateur matches are not considered full senior internationals by The Football Association, they are deemed to be by their opponents. As such, the England amateur side delivered the biggest defeats on several European nations; the Netherlands in 1907, Germany & Belgium in 1909, and Sweden & Hungary in 1912 (as Great Britain), beating them 12-2, 9\u20130, 11\u20132, 12-2 and 7-0 respectively."]}, {"page": "England national football team records and statistics", "response": ["; Most goals in a matchPlaying for England Amateurs, Stanley Harris scored seven goals against France on 1 November 1906 and Vivian Woodward scored six against Netherlands on 11 December 1909.

The r\u00e9gime at the school leaned heavily towards sport, in which he was neither interested nor proficient. The headmaster, Stanley Harris, was a celebrated amateur footballer and occasional first class cricketer, but he was reasonably tolerant of Lancaster's disdain for games, and on the whole Lancaster enjoyed his time at the school. His education there was, he later commented, of more importance to him than anything he learned later in his school and university career.Knox, p. 16 He left St Ronan's in 1921, aged thirteen, and went to Charterhouse, where his father and uncles had all been sent.Knox, p. 18 There he was shocked by the bullying and bad language,Boston, pp. 44\u201345 but in addition to its sporty, philistine \"bloods\",Boston, pp. 44 and 47 the school had an intellectual and aesthetic tradition. Lancaster's biographer Richard Boston writes, \"The hearty Baden-Powell, for example, was offset by Ralph Vaughan Williams and Robert Graves, while talented Carthusian artists had included Thackeray, Leech, Lovat Fraser and Max Beerbohm\".Boston, p. 47 The art master, P.J.(\"Purple\")Johnson, encouraged Lancaster, insisting that a sound technique was a prerequisite for effective self-expression in drawing or painting; in that respect the boy's time at the school was valuable, though otherwise the headmaster found him \"irretrievably gauche... a sad disappointment\".Boston, p. 46 Lancaster shared Beerbohm's view that being an old boy of the school was more pleasurable than being a pupil there."]}, {"page": "1881 in association football", "response": ["* 19 July \u2013 Stanley Harris (d. 1926), England international forward in six matches (1904\u20131906), scoring two goals."]}, {"page": "1903\u201304 British Home Championship", "response": ["|align=left|Stanley Harris"]}, {"page": "1904\u201305 British Home Championship", "response": ["|align=left|Stanley Harris"]}, {"page": "Freddie Wilcox", "response": ["The following season he was joint leading scorer in league matches, though with only eight goals, as the team established itself at the higher level.
