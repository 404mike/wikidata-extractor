One of the German POWs successfully seduces the beautiful and tough Red Army Captain Alexandra Kasalniskaya (Eva Bartok) who prefers him to the sadistic camp commandant, which as Bartov comments also is meant to show that even in defeat, German men were more sexually virile and potent than their Russian counterparts. In Hunde, wollt ihr ewig leben? (Dogs, do you want to live forever?) of 1959, which deals with the Battle of Stalingrad, the focus is on celebrating the heroism of the German soldier in that battle, who are shown as valiantly holding out against overwhelming odds with no mention at all of what those soldiers were fighting for, namely National Socialist ideology or the Holocaust.Bartov, Omer \"Celluloid Soldiers: Cinematic Images of the Wehrmacht\" pages 130\u2013143 from Russia War, Peace and Diplomacy  edited by Ljubica & Mark Erickson, London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2004 page 138. This period also saw a number of films that depicted the military resistance to Hitler. In Des Teufels General (The Devil's General) of 1954, a Luftwaffe general named Harras loosely modeled after Ernst Udet, appears at first to be cynical fool, but turns out to an anti-Nazi who is secretly sabotaging the German war effort by designing faulty planes.Bartov, Omer \"Celluloid Soldiers: Cinematic Images of the Wehrmacht\" pages 130\u2013143 from Russia War, Peace and Diplomacy  edited by Ljubica & Mark Erickson, London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2004 pages 132\u2013133. Bartov commented that in this film, the German officer corps is shown as a group of fundamentally noble and civilized men who happened to be serving an evil regime made up of a small gang of gangsterish misfits totally unrepresentative of German society, which served to exculpate both the officer corps and by extension Germany society.Bartov, Omer \"Celluloid Soldiers: Cinematic Images of the Wehrmacht\" pages 130\u2013143 from Russia War, Peace and Diplomacy  edited by Ljubica & Mark Erickson, London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2004 page 133 Bartov wrote that no German film of the 1950s showed the deep commitment felt by many German soldiers to National Socialism, the utter ruthless way the German Army fought the war and the mindless nihilist brutality of the later Wehrmacht.Bartov, Omer \"Celluloid Soldiers: Cinematic Images of the Wehrmacht\" pages 130\u2013143 from Russia War, Peace and Diplomacy  edited by Ljubica & Mark Erickson, London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2004 page 135. Bartov wrote that German film-makers liked to show the heroic last stand of the 6th Army at Stalingrad, but none has so far showed the 6th Army's massive co-operation with the Einsatzgruppen in murdering Soviet Jews in 1941.Bartov, Omer \"Celluloid Soldiers: Cinematic Images of the Wehrmacht\" pages 130\u2013143 from Russia War, Peace and Diplomacy  edited by Ljubica & Mark Erickson, London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2004 page 139."]}, {"page": "June 18", "response": ["*1927 \u2013 Eva Bartok, Hungarian-English actress (d. 1998)"]}, {"page": "1998", "response": ["* August 1 \u2013 Eva Bartok, Hungarian actress (b. 1927)"]}, {"page": "1998 in film", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1 || Eva Bartok || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 71 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| Hungary || style=\"text-align:center;\"| Actress || "]}, {"page": "John G.
