The elder brother of the twin superheroes Brian and Betsy Braddock, he is a mutant possessing the ability to manipulate reality in a variety of ways. Though his mutant powers are very powerful, he is limited in that he is also a schizophrenic who believes reality to be his own dream. Originally a supporting character in his brother's solo comic book series, the emergence of his superhuman powers and subsequent mental illness have led him to become a super-villain associated with both Captain Britain and various X-Men comics.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Captain Britain", "response": ["Captain Britain Corps comes to Earth to arrest Fantomex for the murder of the young Apocalypse.

Betsy Braddock then realizes the Goat-Devil is actually her older brother from the future and tells Captain Britain to kill him.

However, when the mutant nation of Krakoa and the dimension known as Otherworld, the mystical realm that serves as the collective subconscious of the British Isles, were plunged into conflict, Brian was corrupted by Morgana Le Fey and had to pass the title of Captain Britain to his sister Betsy Braddock. The conflict ended with Jamie Braddock on Otherworld's throne. Being an Omega level mutant who can manipulate reality itself, Jamie breaks reality by using Earth-616 as the foundation and rebuilds itself around his sister Betsy, by changing several details and allowing the new reality to \"backfill\" justifications for why it exists. In a shocking twist, Jamie then kills the alternate version of his sister, fracturing reality once again. He did this in order to restore the numbers of the Incursion crisis, which historically, were made up of Braddock family members across the Omniverse (usually Brian), although through Jamie's \"unprecedented\" measures, reality chooses new heroes in the form of the members of Excalibur that have all stood alongside Betsy Braddock's defense of Otherworld, and now they too are given versions of the Amulet of Right, thus transformed into Captains Britain.
