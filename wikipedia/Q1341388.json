Fletcher was knighted in 1916.Fletcher was Keeper of Mineralogy at the Natural History Museum from 1880 to 1909, and director from 1909 to 1919.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wollaston Medal", "response": ["*1912 Lazarus Fletcher"]}, {"page": "Ray Lankester", "response": ["There was trouble from the moment Lankester put forward his candidature for the office vacated by Sir William Flower, who was on the point of death. The Principal Librarian, Sir Edward Maunde Thompson, the palaeographer, was also the Secretary to the Trustees, and hence in a strong position to get his own way. There is good evidence that Thompson, an efficient and authoritarian figure, intended to take control of the whole Museum, including the Natural History departments.Mitchell, P. Chalmers (1937) My fill of days. London. pp. 170ff.Sir John Evans to Lankester, Lankester family papers; reported in Lester, pp. 128\u20139. In the absence of Huxley, who had led most of the battles for over thirty years, it was left to the younger generation to struggle for the independence of science, Mitchell, Poulton, and Weldon were his main supporters, and together they lobbied the Trustees, the Government and in the press to get their point over. Finally Lankester was appointed instead of Lazarus Fletcher (a relative nonentity).Lester, Chapter 11, pp. 127ff.", "Lankester was appointed in 1898, and the outcome was inevitable. Eight years of conflict with Maunde Thompson followed, with Thompson constantly interfering in the affairs of the museum and obstructing Lankester's attempt to improve the museum. Lankester resigned in 1907, at the direction of Thompson, who had discovered a clause in the regulations which allowed him to call for the resignation of officials at the age of 60. Lazarus Fletcher was appointed in his stead. There was a vast clamour in the press, and from foreign zoologists protesting at the treatment of Lankester. That Lankester had some friends in high places was shown by the Archbishop of Canterbury offering him an enhanced pension, and the knighthood that was bestowed on him the next year."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society D, E, F", "response": ["| Lazarus Fletcher||06/06/1889||3 March 1854 \u2013 6 January 1921"]}, {"page": "Keeper of Mineralogy, Natural History Museum", "response": ["*Lazarus Fletcher (1880\u20131909)"]}, {"page": "List of directors of the Natural History Museum", "response": ["* Sir Lazarus Fletcher (1909\u20131919)"]}, {"page": "Caroline Birley", "response": ["Her will directed that most of her collection of geological specimens should be donated to the London Natural History Museum, with any material not wanted there to be passed to the Manchester Museum, with the request that her material should be labelled as belonging to the \"Caroline Birley Collection\".
