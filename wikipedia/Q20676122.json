The Shawfielders were blessed with fine attacking players such as Harry Hood, Joe Gilroy, Alex Bryce, Sammy Reid and Jim McLean, and Wright helped them finish 7th in the First Division on 40 points, a record haul for a promoted side. This prompted Partick Thistle to invite him back to Firhill as trainer/coach to the first team. In hindsight it can probably be seen that Thistle were beginning a downward slide towards relegation in 1970, however in 1965\u201366 they finished level with Clyde on 30 points."]}, {"page": "Alex Bryce", "response": ["Alex Bryce (1905\u20131961) was a British screenwriter, cinematographer and film director.BFI.org"]}]}}
