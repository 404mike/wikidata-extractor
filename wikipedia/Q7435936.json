The requirement for the UK is to show probable cause. However, an independent legal review carried out by Sir Scott Baker found that \"there is no significant difference between the probable cause test and the reasonable suspicion test. There is no practical difference between the information submitted to and from the United States.\"", "In response to these concerns, the Home Secretary Theresa May appointed Lord Justice Scott Baker to conduct an official review of the UK's extradition treaties, with the assistance of two independent extradition experts. The review was directed to address evidence standards and whether the US\u2013UK extradition treaty is unbalanced. Baker's report was presented to the Home Secretary on September 30, 2011, and concluded that there is no substantial difference in evidence standards, that the treaty is balanced and that there is not \"any basis to conclude that extradition from the United Kingdom to the US ", "The Home Affairs Select Committee published a report in 2012 into the UK\u2013US extradition treaty and Extradition Act, acknowledging the low level of public confidence in the UK's extradition legislation.

The Committee had \"serious misgivings\" about some aspects of the US/UK arrangements but was at pains to recognise the importance of an effective extradition arrangement between the two countries. With respect to the differing legal standards of evidence required in support of an extradition request, the Committee accepted that there was \"little or no distinction in practice between the 'probable cause' and 'reasonable suspicion' tests\". The Committee further acknowledged that \"extradition imposes a significant burden on the accused\". On the most controversial of issues \u2013 that of forum \u2013 that campaigners have long been seeking to have introduced in British legislation, the committee delivers perhaps its strongest message to parliament: \"The Committee believes that it would be in the interests of justice for decisions about forum in cases where there is concurrent jurisdiction to be taken by a judge in open court, where the defendant will have the opportunity to put his case, rather than in private by prosecutors\". The Committee concludes by recognising that it proposes significant amendments to the current legislation given the loss of public confidence in the current system.
