Manager Arthur Turner described him as a \"wonderful prospect\". He scored six goals from 30 appearances in the 1958\u201359 season. Each of the six was the last goal of its match: his first top-flight goal, \"tearing through straight from the second-half kick-off\", helped earn his club a draw at Portsmouth, the other five all came in comfortable wins.Matthews, pp. 193\u201396, 241\u201342. Having come into the first team early in the 1959\u201360 season when Gordon Astall was injured in the home defeat of Newcastle United, Taylor suffered double vision in the reverse fixture a week later and was out for a month. He was selected regularly during October by manager Pat Beasley until a broken leg, sustained in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup semi-final win over Union Saint-Gilloise in mid-November, kept him out for a year. Though he returned to the first team, the injury had robbed him of much of his pace. He scored on his return, against Manchester United, and made 24 appearances during the remainder of the season, sharing the outside-left position with Billy Rudd: Taylor was preferred on a heavy pitch."]}, {"page": "1961 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final", "response": ["Birmingham played Hungarians \u00dajpesti D\u00f3zsa in the first round, with the first leg to be played at home. \u00dajpest twice took the lead, equalised by a Johnny Gordon header and Gordon Astall's shot. Birmingham's repeated attacks broke down near goal, until after 83 minutes Gordon headed home an Astall corner. In the away leg, \u00dajpest took a one-goal lead after an hour, that tied the scores on aggregate, before Gordon was sent off. This left Birmingham facing \"tough opposition and downright one-sided refereeing\" without their centre-forward. But Billy Rudd scored with three minutes left, then combined with debutant Ray Barlow in a \"walking-pace attack\" for Jimmy Singer to clinch the tie with a rising shot."]}, {"page": "List of footballers in England by number of league appearances", "response": ["!scope=row data-sort-value=\"Rudd, Billy\"|Billy Rudd"]}, {"page": "List of Rochdale A.F.C. players", "response": ["|align=left|Billy Rudd"]}]}}
