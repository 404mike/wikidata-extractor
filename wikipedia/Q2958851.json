His magnum opus was the compilation of the Index Animalium, an 11-volume, 9,000-page work that catalogued the 444,000 names of every living and extinct animal discovered between 1758 and 1850. This work is considered the bibliographic foundation for zoological nomenclature. In addition, Sherborn authored almost 200 books, papers, and catalogs on a wide variety topics in natural history. He made important contributions to the study of microfossils and was a founding member and first president of the Society for the Bibliography of Natural History. In recognition of his endeavours he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from Oxford University.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Megalodon", "response": ["Swiss naturalist Louis Agassiz gave this shark its initial scientific name, Carcharodon megalodon, in his 1843 work Recherches sur les poissons fossiles, based on tooth remains. English paleontologist Edward Charlesworth in his 1837 paper used the name Carcharias megalodon, while citing Agassiz as the author, indicating that Agassiz described the species prior to 1843. English paleontologist Charles Davies Sherborn in 1928 listed an 1835 series of articles by Agassiz as the first scientific description of the shark. The specific name megalodon translates to \"big tooth\", from  and \u1f40\u03b4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2 (odo\u00fas), \"tooth\". The teeth of megalodon are morphologically similar to those of the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias), and on the basis of this observation, Agassiz assigned megalodon to the genus Carcharodon. Though \"megalodon\" is an informal name for the shark, it is also often informally dubbed the \"giant white shark\", the \"megatooth shark\", the \"big tooth shark\", or \"Meg\"."]}, {"page": "Sherborn", "response": ["* Charles Davies Sherborn (1861\u20131942), British bibliographer, paleontologist and geologist"]}, {"page": "AnimalBase", "response": ["Zoological names of generic and specific taxa that were established in early zoological publications have been entered manually into the database, including original and corrected spellings of names, type localities and page numbers where these names were originally established in the publications.
