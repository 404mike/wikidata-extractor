Together they devised and wrote 1950s and 60s BBC sitcoms  including  Hancock's Half Hour (1954\u20131961), the first two series' of Comedy Playhouse (1961\u20131963), and Steptoe and Son (1962\u20131974).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Goon Show", "response": ["Sykes and Milligan, along with Ray Galton,  Alan Simpson, Frankie Howerd and Stanley (\"Scruffy\") Dale, co-founded the writers' cooperative Associated London Scripts (ALS), which over time included others including Larry Stephens. In his book Spike & Co, Graham McCann says \"the anarchic spirit of the Goon Show...would inspire, directly or indirectly and to varying extents, Monty Python's Flying Circus, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,  The Young Ones, Vic Reeves Big Night Out, The League of Gentlemen, Brass Eye and countless other strange and bold new comedies\".

Both the character played by Tony Hancock in Hancock's Half Hour, and Harold Steptoe played by Harry H. Corbett (1962\u20131965, 1970\u20131974), are pretentious, would-be intellectuals who find themselves trapped by the squalor of their lives. The Galton and Simpson comedies are often characterised by a bleak and somewhat fatalistic tone. Steptoe and Son in particular is, at times, extremely black comedy, and close in tone to Social realism drama."]}, {"page": "Frankie Howerd", "response": ["During the 1960s and 1970s, he was involved in shows for the BBC and Thames Television (as well as Frankie Howerd Reveals All for Yorkshire Television in 1980). Ray Galton and Alan Simpson wrote for him from 1964 to 1966 when he worked for the BBC and also for a one-off show for Thames, Frankie Howerd meets the Bee Gees, shown on 20 August 1968. He was known for his seemingly off-the-cuff remarks to the audience, especially in the show Up Pompeii! (1969\u201370), which was a direct follow-up from Forum. His television work was characterised by direct addresses to camera and by his littering monologues with verbal tics such as \"Oooh, no missus\" and \"Titter ye not\". A later sale of his scripts, however, showed that the seemingly off-the-cuff remarks had all been meticulously planned. Barry Cryer said of his technique: \"What he could do with a script was amazing, like all the great performers. He transformed something you'd just written \u2013 what you hoped was in a Frankie Howerd idiom \u2013 but when you heard him do it, my God, it was something else; \u2013 it was gossiping over the garden wall, the apparent waffle \u2013 he was like a tightrope walker, you thought he's going to fall off in a minute, you thought , 'Come on, Frank' , we're waiting for a laugh, and then, suddenly, Bang. He knew exactly what he was doing.\"Titter Ye Not; The Frankie Howerd Story, 15 September 2009, BBC Radio 2 Another feature of his humour was to feign innocence about his obvious and risqu\u00e9 double entendres, while mockingly censuring the audience for finding them funny."]}, {"page": "12 Angry Men (1957 film)", "response": ["The film has also been subject to parody. In 2015, the Comedy Central TV series Inside Amy Schumer aired a half-hour parody of the film titled \"12 Angry Men Inside Amy Schumer\". The BBC Television comedy Hancock's Half Hour, starring Tony Hancock and Sid James, and written by Ray Galton and Alan Simpson, was parodied in the episode broadcast on October 16, 1959. Family Guy paid tribute to the film with its Season 11 episode titled \"12 and a Half Angry Men\", and King of The Hill acknowledged the film with their parody \"Nine Pretty Darn Angry Men\" in season 3.

He remained on Whose Line until 1993. Have I Got News for You began in 1990, and two series of his own sketch show, Paul Merton: The Series, followed soon after. In 1995 he presented a documentary series celebrating the history of the London Palladium, entitled Paul Merton's Palladium Story. In 1996, Merton performed updated versions of fifteen of Ray Galton and Alan Simpson's old scripts for an ITV series, Paul Merton in Galton & Simpson's.... Six of these scripts were previously performed by Tony Hancock. These were very badly received by critics, and although a selection of episodes was initially released on VHS, it was not until June 2007 that the complete series was released on DVD."]}]}}
