On 3 October 2000, with Northwich bottom of the Conference with only 9 points from 12 games, Gardiner was sacked, joining Leek Town as a player, making his debut in a draw at Altrincham. Within a fortnight of Gardiner signing for Leek, Andy Holmes was sacked as Leek manager and on 3 November 2000, Gardiner was given his job. However, with Leek desperately short of money and struggling in the league, it was never going to be an easy task. In January 2001, Gardiner was told to cut the wage bill after having his budget cut and promptly resigned. He almost immediately joined Nantwich Town as a player, making his debut at left-back in a 2\u20130 win over Ramsbottom United.
