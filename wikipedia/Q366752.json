The anthem Steve Bloomer's Watchin' is played at every Derby home game and there is a bust of him at the Pride Park Stadium. He is also listed in the Football League 100 Legends and English Football Hall of Fame.\nDuring his career Bloomer was a prolific goalscorer for both club and country. A quick thinking forward, he was able to shoot powerfully and accurately with either foot and his speciality was the daisy cutter \u2013 a low shot, hit with great power, speed and accuracy. In 536 First Division games he scored 317 goals and, after Jimmy Greaves, he is the second highest all-time goalscorer in the top-flight of English football. He also scored 28 goals in 23 appearances for England. He helped Derby to win the Second Division title in 1911\u201312, and to reach second in the First Division in 1895\u201396; he also played on the losing side in four FA Cup semi-finals and three FA Cup finals (1898, 1899 and 1903).\nBloomer also played baseball for Derby Baseball Club and helped them become British champions three times in the 1890s. After retiring as a footballer he became a coach and worked with clubs in Germany, the Netherlands and Spain. During World War I he was interned at Ruhleben, a civilian detention camp. The highlight of his coaching career came in 1924 when he guided Real Uni\u00f3n to victory in the Copa del Rey.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 16", "response": ["*1938 \u2013 Steve Bloomer, English footballer and manager (b. 1874)"]}, {"page": "January 20", "response": ["*1874 \u2013 Steve Bloomer, English footballer and coach (d. 1938)"]}, {"page": "1874", "response": ["* January 20 \u2013 Steve Bloomer, English footballer, cricketer and baseball player (d. 1938)"]}, {"page": "Everton F.C.", "response": ["Everton has had many other nicknames over the years. When the black kit was worn, the team was nicknamed \"The Black Watch\" after the famous army regiment. Since going blue in 1901, the team has been given the simple nickname \"The Blues\". Everton's attractive style of play led to Steve Bloomer calling the team \"scientific\" in 1928, which is thought to have inspired the nickname \"The School of Science\". The battling 1995 FA Cup winning side was known collectively as \"The Dogs of War\".

In the 42nd minute Jack Fryer was unable to hold a Charlie Richards shot giving Capes a tap in for his second goal. Wragg's injury meant Forest had to change their line up with Capes dropping back to midfield. In the 86th minute John Boag headed away a corner by Forest.
