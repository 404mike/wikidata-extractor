Although the Louvre states that it was \"doubtless painted between 1503 and 1506\", art historian Martin Kemp says that there are some difficulties in confirming the dates with certainty. Alessandro Vezzosi believes that the painting is characteristic of Leonardo's style in the final years of his life, post-1513. Other academics argue that, given the historical documentation, Leonardo would have painted the work from 1513.

In 1516, Leonardo was invited by King Francis I to work at the Clos Luc\u00e9 near the Ch\u00e2teau d'Amboise; it is believed that he took the Mona Lisa with him and continued to work on it after he moved to France.

In order to hide this from the audience, she was only filmed in ways that would keep her septum hidden from view.
