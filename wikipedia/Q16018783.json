It was envisaged that Haymarket would take a 25% stake, as would the Financial Times and The Economist, of both of which Crowther was also chairman. Over the weekend Heseltine, inspired by how Donald Stokes had once won a Scandinavian bus contract for British Leyland by building a model bus, had a team led by Labovitch prepare a 96-page mock copy of what they envisaged, mostly using text cut from The Economist. Robert Heller was brought in as the first editor of what became Management Today \u2013 Heseltine initially irritated him by taking him to lunch at the Carlton Club and talking of his political aspirations, but Heller soon recognised that Labovitch was the front man whose job was to impress those who needed to be impressed, and Heseltine was \"the dynamic and real entrepreneurial brain\". The first edition came out in April 1966, just after Heseltine's election to Parliament. Haymarket went on to publish similar magazines for Marketing, Personnel Management and Computing Institutes.Crick 1997, pp. 143\u20135.", "In 1968, there were rumours that BPC was planning to sack Heseltine.Crick 1997, p. 157. Another of the titles acquired from BPC was World's Press News, largely a compilation of world press releases, which was relaunched by Masters and Robert Heller as Campaign in September 1968 (Heseltine initially opposed the title, thinking it sounded too political). It rapidly became standard reading in the world of advertising and Public Relations, for its gossipy reporting, often obtained by trading information, of who was gaining or losing accounts or being promoted or sacked. Within a year it had overtaken Advertisers Weekly for its volume of classified ads. Heseltine was forced, in the face of a strike, to recognise the National Union of Journalists among his staff. Josephine Hart (later a novelist and the wife of Maurice Saatchi, who was Heseltine's assistant at this time), further improved the advertising sales operation by recruiting a team of largely female sales staff.Crick 1997, pp. 149\u201355.", "As part of his ongoing campaign to buy titles off other publishers, Heseltine noticed a magazine called The Accountant which was easily paid for by vast amounts of advertising. Robert Heller produced a dummy edition of a Haymarket version, modelled on the Daily Telegraph, which became Accountancy Age. Following an international phone call between Heller, who was on holiday in Portugal, and Heseltine who was on a political trip to Singapore, the launch date was brought forward by three months on learning that a rival publication was to be launched. Accountancy Age was launched in December 1969, largely by Haymarket's business development manager Maurice Saatchi, and was profitable from the start.Crick 1997, pp. 155\u20136.", "Heseltine acted as a consultant to Haymarket during his period out of government office between 1974 and 1979.Michael Heseltine, Life in the Jungle, Hodder & Stoughton, 2000, , pp. 91\u20132. His role was to bring in new publishing ideas. He believed he increased performance, although Robert Heller later recorded that he did very little, for he was too busy as a member of the Shadow Cabinet. He worked from an office at Haymarket, near Regent Street, rather than in the House of Commons.Crick 1997, pp. 193\u20134. Under the management of Masters and Tindall, Haymarket continued to grow. By 1976 it was making annual profits of round \u00a31.75m. In 1976\u20131977 Heseltine, Masters, Tindall and the Finance Director David Fraser bought out the consortium's 40% share, using money borrowed from them, giving Heseltine and his family over 50% control of Haymarket.Crick 1997, pp. 196\u20137.Michael Heseltine, Life in the Jungle, Hodder & Stoughton, 2000, , p. 92. Heseltine had taken out large personal loans both to increase his stake in the company and to buy his country mansion Thenford House. Masters had also done the same to buy himself a property.Crick 1997, pp, 196-7, 324. Several titles, including Accountancy Age and Computing were sold to the rival company VNU in 1980. The transaction raised \u00a317m, half of which went to Heseltine, but in Crick's view was a bad move for Haymarket.Crick 1997, p. 324. During Heseltine's second period out of office (1986\u20131990), Masters threatened to resign if Heseltine returned to Haymarket, but once again he became a consultant on \u00a3100,000 per annum.Crick 1997, p. 297."]}, {"page": "List of business theorists", "response": ["* Robert Heller"]}, {"page": "Robert Heller", "response": ["Robert Heller, also Joseph Heller, (born William Henry Palmer; 1826\u20131878) was an English  magician, mentalist, and musician.  The year of his birth is the subject of some speculation; some sources list it as 1829 while others claim 1830.", "A reporter for the St. Louis Luminary, recorded his impressions of a Robert Heller performance of February 7, 1855, in Washington D.C.:", ":At night I went to see the performance of an acrobatic Macromancer by the name of Robert Heller, who performed some wonderful feats. He caused an orange tree to bloom and bring forth fruit. Real ripe oranges which were distributed among the crowd, and afterward butterflies came out from among its leaves. A boy was suspended upon two poles, one placed under each arm about midway from the elbow to the shoulder and the stool upon which he stood was then taken from under his feet. The boy was entirely senseless, choloriform (sic) having been administered unto him. The poles had no fastenings, but were set loose upon the floor. One of the poles was then taken from under his left arm, which left him suspended by one arm, his left hand was then touched by the Necromancer when it fell to his side; his right hand was then raised so as to rest his face upon it. His feet were then directed to a horizontal position with his head and thus he remained suspended for sometime \u2014 his whole body resting upon noting save the right arm upon the end of the pole. Money, handkerchiefs and many other articles were passed from under silver vases on one table to others at another part of the stage without seemingly any human agency. Many other wonderful feats were performed by this great Necromancer."]}, {"page": "Heller (surname)", "response": ["* H.

Essentially \"Lestoil syndrome\" describes the phenomena of innovators being copied by competitors with greater capital resources, who can employ the initial creator's strategy, but use their capital to  obtain a greater market recognition. The Lestoil detergent product was among the earliest heavy-industry cleaning detergents marketed directly to consumers; however, its initial success in obtaining a large market share was quickly overshadowed when larger competitors in the household product space took notice. These competitors began introducing similarly marketed products like Colgate-Palmolive's liquid Ajax, and Procter & Gamble's Mr. Clean, and before eventually being bought by a subsidiary of Procter & Gamble, their marketing campaigns diluted Lestoil's market share. Heller characterized this by saying they had \"reacted with multi-million dollar force, swamping Lestoil in a sea of green bubbles\"."]}, {"page": "Angela Flowers", "response": ["In 1970, Angela Flowers met the writer and business journalist Robert Heller.
