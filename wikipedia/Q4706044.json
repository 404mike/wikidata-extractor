He was born in Sutton-in-the-Elms, Leicestershire. He came to limited attention with some useful performances for the County XI during the makeshift fixture list of 1945, scoring 83 against the RAF Regiment. He played one first-class match for Leicestershire in 1946, failing to distinguish himself with either bat or ball in an eight wicket defeat against Kent at the Nevill Ground, Tunbridge Wells.", "link_mentions": {}}}
