He also won a 'B' international cap against France in 1959.\nWith Crusaders, he won the Ulster Cup and County Antrim Shield, and was part of the club's first Irish Cup-winning teams in 1967 and 1968. He was named the Ulster Footballer of the Year for the 1960/61 season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Crusaders F.C.", "response": ["The 1960s brought much more success. On 17 May 1960 they won the County Antrim Shield for the first time, repeating the feat in 1965 with a 6\u20130 victory over Larne (this was the joint-biggest margin of victory in the final of the competition until Linfields 9\u20131 victory over Bangor in 1973). With Jimmy Murdough as coach they also picked up another Ulster Cup final win on 1 October 1963, with a reply victory of 1\u20130 over Glenavon. These successes were overshadowed by two unexpected victories in the Irish Cup finals of 1967 and 1968 against the might of Glentoran and Linfield respectively. This led to Crusaders' first sojourn into European competition, against Valencia CF in August 1967. Also in 1968, they narrowly missed out on winning the Blaxnit Cup and becoming champions of all of Ireland, losing 3\u20134 on aggregate to Shamrock Rovers. The 1960s also saw the emergence of some of the greatest players in Crusaders' history, such as Albert Campbell, (who was the club's most capped international player until surpassed by Colin Coates), Danny Trainor, Joe Meldrum, Walter McFarland and Danny Hale, who scored an incredible 143 goals in just four seasons, including a club record of 55 goals in the 1965\u201366 season, which still stands to this day."]}, {"page": "1966 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 UEFA Group 5", "response": ["| DF ||align=\"left\"| Albert Campbell || 4 January 1938 || 1 || 0 || 90 || 0 || 0 || - ||bgcolor=red| 90 || - || - || - || - ||align=\"left\"|  Crusaders F.C."]}, {"page": "Ulster Footballer of the Year", "response": ["|  1960\u201361 || ||align=left| Albert Campbell || align=left| Crusaders|| "]}, {"page": "Albert Campbell", "response": ["Albert Campbell may refer to:", "*Albert Campbell (singer) (1872\u20131947), American pioneer recording artist", "*Albert Campbell (dogsled racer) (1894\u20131961), Canadian dogsled racer", "*Albert Campbell (Canadian politician) (1910\u20131973)", "*Albert Campbell (footballer) (born 1938), Northern Ireland former footballer"]}, {"page": "1967\u201368 Irish Cup", "response": ["Crusaders FC: Terry Nicholson; Alex Anderson, Billy Cathcart; Albert Campbell (c), Walter McFarland, John McPolin, Thanny Brush, Danny Trainor, Joe Meldrum, Johnny Jamison, Liam Wilson.
