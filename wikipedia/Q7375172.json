They tended to dress in shabby country wear and behaved very oddly, as befits friends of the equally eccentric Bruce, whom Bunty referred to as \"The Weirdo\". Bunty enjoyed drinking, hunting and shooting. She first met Hyacinth while looking for her lost dog (Hyacinth and Richard were staying in the cottage at the time). Unlike many of the people Hyacinth seeks to impress, Bunty didn't seem to find anything amiss in Hyacinth's genteel manner. Richard met up with her husband Dorian while helping to look for the missing dog at Hyacinth's behest, and brought Dorian back to the cottage with him. Bunty quickly became drunk and Dorian started to pursue Hyacinth amorously, which amused Bunty to no end.
