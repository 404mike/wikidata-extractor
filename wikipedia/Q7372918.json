Haynes (born c. 1925) is a British automobile designer.  Haynes worked for Ford as Model Line Director for Ford of Europe where he was responsible for the design of the 1966 Cortina MkII and worked on the design for the 1966 Ford Zodiac/Zephyr Mk4.In 1967, he was recruited to BMC by Joe Edwards, working from the Pressed Steel Fisher studios in Cowley. While at BMC, Haynes put forward a plan to build models on just five platforms and reduce the number of brands to make the company profitable.His first job was to work on the shortly to be released Austin Maxi, where he redesigned the front and rear ends. Further work was done on facelifting the successful AD016 Austin/Morris 1100 range, which failed to appear after the formation of the British Leyland (BL) in 1968 and was replaced by the Austin Allegro. Further projects included the 1969 Mini Clubman facelift for the Mini which had been planned as a hatchback in 1968 and designed the 1971 Morris Marina, which were accepted by the management team at BL with minimal modifications, which was amazing as he was up against designs by Pinifarina & Michelotti. Further projects included Project Condor which was a sports car based on the Morris Marina.\nHaynes left BL in 1969, just 16 months after joining from Ford's, as the new management team closed the Pressed Steel design studio at Cowley, moving the department to Longbridge. It was reported that the journey from his home to Essex was a step too far. Haynes was replaced as chief stylist of, what was by then, British Leyland in 1970 by Harris Mann, whom he had taken with him to BMC from Ford's.In 1976, Roy Haynes formed ElecTraction Ltd Maldon, Essex and designed several electric vehicles for the company through his other company Roy Haynes Automotive International, including the Rickshaw, Tropicana and the concept Precinct but the company closed in 1979. In 2012 in an interview with This is Total Essex, Roy Haynes was promoting his idea for a new London Airport design for Foulness Island, in Essex.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mini", "response": ["In 1969, under the ownership of British Leyland, the Mini was given a facelift by stylist Roy Haynes, who had previously worked for Ford. The restyled version was called the Mini Clubman, and has a squarer frontal look, using the same indicator/sidelight assembly as the Austin Maxi. The Mini Clubman was intended to replace the upmarket Riley and Wolseley versions. At launch all Clubmans were powered by the 998cc engine as already used in the Mini 1000, with 38bhp. A more sporting model with the 1275cc single-carburettor 59bhp engine, dubbed the 1275 GT, was slated as the replacement for the 998\u00a0cc Mini Cooper (the 1,275\u00a0cc Mini Cooper S continued alongside the 1275 GT for two years until 1971). The Clubman Estate replaced the Countryman and Traveller. The original \"round-front\" design Mini remained in production alongside the Clubman and 1275 GT in 850 and 1000 forms as lower-priced models in the new Mini range."]}, {"page": "Ford Cortina", "response": ["The second incarnation of the Cortina, designed by Roy Haynes, was launched on 18 October 1966, four years after the original Cortina. It had some styling elements in common with the third-generation US Ford Falcon. Although the launch was accompanied by the slogan \"New Cortina is more Cortina\", the car, at  long, was fractionally shorter than before. Its  of extra width and curved side panels provided more interior space. Its other improvements included a smaller turning circle, softer suspension, self-adjusting brakes and clutch, and the availability on the smaller-engined models, for the UK and some other markets, of a new five-bearing 1300 cc engine."]}, {"page": "Morris Marina", "response": ["The car was designed by Roy Haynes, the same man who designed the Ford Cortina Mark II (launched in 1966), with which it shares some stylistic similarities. Lacking the budget to develop two cars to compete directly with the Escort and the Cortina, the makers sized the ADO28 between the two benchmark Ford models. Haynes' original idea was to produce the car in coup\u00e9 and saloon versions with the coup\u00e9 pitched as a premium, sporting version, in a similar mould to the Ford Capri \u2013 a popular coup\u00e9 based on Cortina running gear \u2013 to appeal to younger buyers, while the saloon was for the crucial company car market and families.", "Haynes also attempted to put forward a system that many manufacturers now use: a common floor pan shared between models. The Marina was the first car design that used this idea. Although this idea carried great potential benefits for a company selling cars under numerous different brands across multiple market sectors it was looked on as too radical by the management of British Leyland and Triumph designer Harry Webster was drafted in to push the project forward. Roy Haynes soon left the company.", "Numerous redesigns also meant that the final design of the Marina was rushed, as the project's final deadline grew near. The car went from design stage to production in just 18 months. Consequently, the board decided to cut costs and abandon Macpherson struts in favour of an old design from the Morris Minor. They also abandoned a project to design a new 4-speed BMC gearbox. As a further cost-cutting measure the coup\u00e9 version of the Marina would now use the same front doors as the saloon version. This produced significant cost savings in tooling and assembly, but left the coup\u00e9 as obvious styling derivative of the saloon rather than having a different, more sporting image as Roy Haynes had originally proposed. This made it impossible to pitch the coup\u00e9 as a superior product, and so it was decided that the 2-door coup\u00e9 version of the Marina would be the cheaper of the two body styles, with the 1.3-litre model directly replacing the entry-level 2-door version of the Morris Minor and competing with the 2-door saloon versions of the Ford Escort and the Hillman Avenger."]}, {"page": "Harris Mann", "response": ["Harris Mann (born April 1938) is a British car designer. He took over from Roy Haynes as chief stylist at British Leyland in 1970.", "Cars on which Mann was involved at Ford included the first Escort and the Capri. His boss at Ford, Roy Haynes, persuaded Mann to go with him when, in 1967, he moved to BMC to lead the design studio at Cowley."]}, {"page": "Roy Haynes (disambiguation)", "response": ["Roy Haynes is an American jazz drummer.", "Roy Haynes may also refer to:", "* Roy Haynes (designer), car designer and stylist"]}, {"page": "Roy Haynes (car stylist)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Roy Haynes (designer)"]}, {"page": "Mini concept cars", "response": ["In 1967 Roy Haynes joined BMC from Ford Motor Company and was tasked by then Managing Director, Joe Edwards to update the existing Mini. Several designs were looked at including a booted version based upon the Riley / Wolsley Elf/Hornet and a hatchback with a rear end resembling a Morris Marina, which was also designed by Haynes. All of these were rejected except for the new front which was added to the existing Mini and named the Clubman."]}]}}
