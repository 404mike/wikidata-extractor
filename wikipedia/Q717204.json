Resident Evil also helped redefine the zombie genre, playing an important role in its shift from supernatural themes to scientific themes by using science to explain the origins of zombies. According to Kim Newman in the book Nightmare Movies (2011), \"the zombie revival began in the Far East\" mainly due to the 1996 Japanese zombie games Resident Evil and The House of the Dead. George Romero, in 2013, said it was the video games Resident Evil and House of the Dead \"more than anything else\" that popularised his zombie concept in early 21st-century popular culture.

The Daily Telegraph stated that \"Barker has achieved a fine degree of menace\". Melody Maker described it as \"the best horror film ever to be made in Britain\". Kim Newman writing for the Monthly Film Bulletin noted that the most immediately striking aspect of the movie is its seriousness of tone in an era when horror films (the Nightmare on Elm Street or Evil Dead films in particular) tend to be broadly comic.\" Newman stated that the film \"suffers from a few minor compromises: notably a decision made fairly late in shooting to change the specifically English setting for an ambiguous (and unbelievable) mid-Atlantic one.\" Newman also noted that the Cenobites were \"well used suggestive figures\" but \"their monster companion is a more blunderingly obvious concession to the gross-out tastes of the teenage drive-in audience\". Newman concluded that the film was \"a return to the cutting edge of horror cinema\" and that in more gruesome moments the film \"is a reminder of the grand guignol intensity that has recently tended to disintegrate into lazy splatter\".

The Los Angeles Timess Mark Chalon Smith declared in a 1995 retrospective review: \"Freaks is a wild ride, but it's not the monster-trip some say it is.

Jamie Russell of the BBC similarly observed in 2002: \"It's easy to see why reactions to the film have been so strong\u2014it's a catalogue of the abnormal, the bizarre, and the grotesque that's still as unsettling today as it was 70 years ago.\""]}, {"page": "M.

Kim Newman calls it the \"most influential Western of the 1950s (because) its attitudes subtly changed the societal vision of the whole (Western) genre\". The traditional format of the Western is of a strong male character leading the civilised against the uncivilised but, in this film, the civilised people fail (in a way described by John Wayne as \"un-American\") to support their town marshal. Newman draws the contrast between the \"eerily neat and civilised\" town of Hadleyville and the \"gutlessness, self-interest and lack of backbone exhibited by its inhabitants\" who will allow the town to \"slip back into the savage past\" from which Kane and his deputies once saved it. In his article, The Women of \"High Noon\": A Revisionist View, Don Graham argues that in addition to the man-alone theme, High Noon \"represents a notable advance in the portrayal of women in Westerns\". Compared with the \"hackneyed presentation\" of stereotypical women characters in earlier Westerns, High Noon grants the characters of Amy and Helen an expanded presence, the two being counterpoints. While Helen is socially inferior, she holds considerable economic power in the community. Helen's encounter with Amy is key because she tells Amy that she would never leave Kane if he were her man \u2013 she would get a gun and fight, thus predicating Amy's actions. For most of the film, Amy is the \"Eastern-virgin archetype\" but her reaction to the first gunshot \"transcends the limitations of her genre role\" as she returns to town and kills Pierce. The gang's actions indicate the implicit but very real threat they pose to women; as is suggested by the Mexican woman crossing herself when the first three ride into town. Graham summarises the many references to women as a community demoralised by the failure of its male members, other than Kane. The women, he asserts, equal Kane in strength of character to the extent that they are \"protofeminists\"."]}, {"page": "Vampire literature", "response": ["Kim Newman's Anno Dracula series (1992\u2013) returns to Stoker's Count Dracula, looking at an alternate world where Dracula defeated Van Helsing's group and conquered Britain, and gives the genre a somewhat postmodern spin.
