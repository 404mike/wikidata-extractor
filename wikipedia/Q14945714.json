The book was reviewed by David Brion Davis, Graham Farmelo, Peter Harrison, Eamon Duffy, William Gibson, Floris Cohen, and Guy Stroumsa, along with many others, including reviews in newspapers and magazines, literary publications, academic journals, and theological journals. The book's review in Publishers Weekly stated that \"Iliffe skillfully chronicles Newton's life\" and that he \"adroitly illustrates that, from the beginning, Newton displayed deep interests in scriptural interpretation, the history of the early Church, and the idea of prophecy\". The review closes by stating: \"Iliffe's fascinating study provides an absorbing glimpse into Newton's work and early modern culture\". In his review of the book, Peter Harrison stated that the book \"presents what is surely the definitive account of Newton's religious world view\" and went on to write: \"It is a remarkable work of painstaking scholarship, engagingly written, and packed with new insights into the man and his milieu\". Among other acclamations, the book made the best sellers list for the Library Journal in October 2017 and was listed as one of \"The Top 75 Community College Titles\" by Choice Reviews in December of the same year."]}]}}
