They were constructed about 1870 in brown brick with some timber framing, and clay tile roofs.  The house is to the west, is in two storeys, and has two bays, both gabled.  The western bay is smaller than that to the east and is set back; its gable is timber framed.  Between the storeys on both wings is a frieze of zigzag brickwork and plaster.  To the east of the house is a single-storey extension with a catslide roof and an arched entrance giving access to rear of the buildings; over the entrance is a timber framed gable.  The cottage is simple in form with a dormer and blue brick diapering. In 1884 the editor of The British Architect, Thomas Raffles Davison, described the building as one of the \"very pleasing buildings south of the [church] by Mr\u00a0Douglas\"."]}, {"page": "London Society (organisation)", "response": ["The society was launched to the general public on 13 January 1913 at a meeting held at the Mansion House, under the presidency of the Lord Mayor, Earl Curzon of Kedleston (later the 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston) who delivered an address that neatly described its objects as being \"to make London beautiful where it is not so already, and to keep it beautiful where it already is\".Webb, A (ed.), London of the Future, London Society, 1921, p.17 The fledgling society attracted wide coverage and interest. By the end of 1913 the society's membership was over 400, including 65 MPs and peers, 9 members of the London County Council and many practising architects and surveyors. Early members also included planners, engineers and artists. Its formation partly reflected a shift from a 19th-century philanthropic approach to urban reform to a more professional and democratic attempt to planning of the whole urban environment.Helen Beaufoy (1997), Order out of chaos: The London Society and the planning of London 1912\u20131920, Planning Perspectives, volume 12, issue 2, pp.135-164. It predated the establishment of the Royal Town Planning Institute in 1914. The journalist Thomas Raffles Davison wrote:", "Those from beyond the architectural professions included illustrator Thomas Raffles Davison, artist and president of the Royal Academy, Frank Brangwyn (who studied under William Morris and worked alongside Diego Rivera and Josep Maria Sert to decorate the concourse of the RCA Building in New York), publisher J. M. Dent (producer of the Everyman's Library series) and politician Reginald Brabazon, 12th Earl of Meath. Painter and past director of the National Gallery, Sir Edward Poynter, joined in 1913. So too did Sir Thomas Brock, sculptor of the Queen Victoria memorial. Lady Feodora Gleichen, the first woman to be made a member of the Royal Society of Sculptors, joined in 1919."]}, {"page": "T.
