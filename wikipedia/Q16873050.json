Love is accused of committing the cyber attacks as part of a \"hacktivist\" campaign in 2012 and 2013 to protest the death of Aaron Swartz, a computer programmer who committed suicide while facing up to 35 years in US prison for charges of computer misuse. In September 2016 decision has been made to extradite Love to US. Todner said she's \"as confident as I can be\" about the appeal. More than 100 MPs showed support for Love's campaign to have his extradition order overturned on health grounds. In October 2016 it was announced that MP Barry Sheerman, chair of the Parliamentary Commission on Autism will write to President Obama, asking him to throw out the extradition request before he leaves office in January 2017. On Wednesday 12 October 2016, in the House of Commons during the Prime Ministers Questions, David Burrowes MP raised the case of Lauri Love and issues such as the difficulties faced by those with various forms of autism when they come into contact with the justice system. Others, including the National Autistic Society, Liberty, and The Courage Foundation, showed their support for Love's appeal. By 24 October, 105 cross-party backbenchers signed a letter to President Obama, raising \"deep concern for safety\" of Lauri Love, pointing out that he has \"a long history of serious mental health issues, depression and some episodes of psychosis\". In November 2016 Home Secretary Amber Rudd has backed decision to extradite Love to America."]}, {"page": "Laurie Love", "response": ["#REDIRECT Lauri Love"]}]}}
