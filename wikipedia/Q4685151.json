He played for Somerset's second eleven in 1987 and made his first-class debut in the match against the West Indians at Taunton in May 1988, taking four wickets for 41 runs in the touring side's first innings. These remained his best first-class bowling figures, though he played eight further matches in 1988 and six more in 1989 for Somerset. As a batsman, his best first-class score came in 1989, with an innings of 30 in the match against Leicestershire and a share of a last-wicket partnership of 70 with Adrian Jones, whose unbeaten 43 was also his highest first-class score. Two seasons, though, were the limit of his first-class career, which was ended by back injury."]}, {"page": "Adrian Jones", "response": ["Adrian Jones may refer to:", "* Adrian Jones (sculptor) (1845\u20131938), English sculptor and painter", "* Adrian Jones (cricketer) (born 1961), English former cricketer", "* Adrian Jones (American football) (born 1981), American football offensive guard", "* Adrian Jones (musician) (born 1978), Swedish musician, member of Gjallarhorn (band)"]}, {"page": "List of Border representative cricketers", "response": ["* Adrian Jones, 1981/82"]}]}}
