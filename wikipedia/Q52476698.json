Dobie contacted the XXX Corps and the 101st Airborne Division, who approved the proposed evacuation. Dobie was appointed to lead the evacuation with Neave and Fraser as his intelligence officers.

Only a small group of the 1st Parachute Brigade, mainly elements of Lieutenant Colonel John Frost's 2nd Battalion, were able to reach the bridge.Waddy, p65 The 1st and 3rd Battalions were unable to penetrate the outer suburbs of the city and their advance stalled, so in order to support them the first lift of the South Staffords were sent forward on the morning of the 18th.Waddy, p79 When Cain arrived with the second lift they too were sent forward, arriving at the outskirts of Arnhem on the night of the 18th.Middlebrook, p188 Lieutenant Colonel David Dobie of the 1st Battalion proposed a concentrated attack on a narrow front between the Lower Rhine and the Arnhem railway line.  The South Staffords would advance toward the bridge, with the remnants of the 1st and 3rd Battalions on their right flank, while the 11th Parachute Battalion, remained in reserve.Middlebrook, p191 The Staffords moved forward at 4.30am with D Company in the lead, followed by B and A Companies with C Company in reserve.Middlebrook, p200 In the area around St Elizabeth Hospital, the lead company met heavy resistance clearing houses and B Company took the lead, getting as far as a dell near the Arnhem City Museum.  Here Cain and his men encountered enemy armour for the first time.Waddy, p89 The company was only armed with PIATs and mortars and although Cain and several of his company opened fire on the tanks and guns, they did not manage to disable any.Middlebrook, p202 By 11:30 they had run out of PIAT ammunition and the tanks now dominated the area. Their position was clearly hopeless and so Lieutenant Colonel McCardie, the commanding officer (CO) of 2nd Battalion, The South Staffordshire Regiment, ordered them to withdraw from the dell.Middlebrook, p205 Cain fell back with several of his men but few of them were able to escape, while the men of the other companies were forced to surrender. Cain was the only senior officer of the battalion to escape in what he later described as the \"South Staff's Waterloo\".Middlebrook, p203"]}, {"page": "David Theodore Dobie", "response": ["#REDIRECT David Dobie"]}]}}
