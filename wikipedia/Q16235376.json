Just 14 minutes into the game, Sheffield United's Mark Duffy was fouled by Sheffield Wednesday's Morgan Fox and was awarded a penalty, taken by David McGoldrick and saved by Cameron Dawson.

He returned to the starting line-up in mid-January and lasted a month before a muscular injury forced him out. This time, he failed to regain his starting place when he returned to fitness: Morgan Fox, who had regularly covered for him, retained the position, and Wiggins made just one more appearance, in mid-April."]}, {"page": "Michael O'Neill (footballer)", "response": ["Due to the ongoing pandemic the 2020\u201321 season began later in September with matches continuing to played behind closed doors.

Stoke began the season well with Tyrese Campbell in decent form, winning eight of their first 16 matches and were just outside the play-off places at the beginning of December. However a number of injuries to key players most notably to Tyrese Campbell saw goals dry up and the team went nine games without a win at the turn of the year.
