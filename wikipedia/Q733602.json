He was the younger brother of Professor Walter Garstang, FRS, a marine biologist and zoologist. Garstang is considered a pioneer in the development of scientific practices in archaeology as he kept detailed records of his excavations with extensive photographic records, which was a comparatively rare practice in early 20th-century archaeology.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jericho", "response": ["The first excavations of the site were made by Charles Warren in 1868.

The most high-profile example was the \"fall of Jericho\", excavated by John Garstang in the 1930s. Garstang originally announced that he had found fallen walls dating to the time of the biblical Battle of Jericho, but later revised the destruction to a much earlier period. Kathleen Kenyon dated the destruction of the walled city to the middle of the 16th century ( 1550 BCE), too early to match the usual dating of the Exodus to Pharaoh Ramses, on the basis of her excavations in the early 1950s. The same conclusion, based on an analysis of all the excavation findings, was reached by Piotr Bienkowski. By the 1960s it had become clear that the archaeological record did not, in fact, support the account of the conquest given in Joshua: the cities which the Bible records as having been destroyed by the Israelites were either uninhabited at the time, or, if destroyed, were destroyed at widely different times, not in one brief period."]}, {"page": "List of archaeologists", "response": ["*John Garstang (1876\u20131954) British; Anatolia, Southern Levant"]}, {"page": "List of Egyptologists", "response": ["*John Garstang (British, 1876\u20131956)"]}, {"page": "Formby", "response": ["*John Garstang, archaeologist (worked at Liverpool University and resided at Thornbury on Freshfield Road, FormbyWorld Biography \u2013 Volume 1 \u2013 Page 1932)"]}, {"page": "Et-Tell", "response": ["The first archaeological exploration of et-Tell was undertaken in September 1928 under the supervision of John Garstang.

It was therefore a shock when Kathleen Kenyon in the 1950s, using more scientific methods than had been available to Garstang, redated Jericho City IV to 1550 BC and found no signs of any habitation at all for the period around 1400 BC. Wood's 1990 reversion of City IV to Garstang's original 1400 BC therefore attracted considerable attention. Wood based his belief on the story in the biblical book of Joshua, Jericho was the first Canaanite city to fall to the Israelites as they began their conquest of the Promised Land - an event which Wood places at around 1406 BC due to his interpretation of . In 1999, based on a reanalysis of pottery shards, Wood argued that Jericho could have been captured in the Late Bronze Age by Joshua.

Kathleen Kenyon re-excavated the site over 1952\u20131958 and demonstrated that the destruction occurred at an earlier time, during a well-attested Egyptian campaign against the Hyksos of that period, and that Jericho had been deserted throughout the mid-late 13th century BCE, the supposed time of Joshua's battle. Sources differ as to what date Kenyon instead proposed; either ca. 1500 BC  or ca. 1580 BC. Kenyon's work was corroborated in 1995 by radiocarbon tests which dated the destruction level to the late 17th or 16th centuries BCE.

Older hypotheses followed two New Kingdom sources which credit Nebka with founding the Third Dynasty, a view that is now believed to contradict the archaeological evidence. The tomb of Nebka has not been located with any certainty and three locations have been proposed: a mastaba in Beit Khallaf attributed to Sanakht by John Garstang, a mudbrick structure in Abu Rawash seen as the tomb of Nebka by Swelim and Dodson, and the Unfinished Northern Pyramid of Zawyet El Aryan.", "Nebka's identity with respect to other Third Dynasty rulers is now partially settled. Most scholars including Thomas Schneider, Darell Baker, Peter Clayton, Michel Baud, Jarom\u00edr M\u00e1lek, Toby Wilkinson, Kenneth Anderson Kitchen, Stephan Seidlmayer, Michael Rice, Donald Leprohon and Rainer Stadelmann are convinced that Nebka was identical with Hor-Sanakht. This opinion is based on a single fragmentary clay seal discovered by Garstand in 1902 in Beit Khallaf, a locality north of Abydos. Kurt Sethe proposed that the damaged sealing shows the serekh of Sanakht next to a fragmentary cartouche housing an archaic form of the sign for \"ka\". The cartouche is believed to be just large enough to have enclosed the further sign \"Neb\". In addition, a further two dozen sealings of Sanakht were uncovered in Beit Khallaf's nearby tomb K2, which John Garstang believed to be this king's tomb.
