Despite the fact that heavier Oxbridge crews were traditionally more successful, Oxford boat club president Hudspith, himself part of the successful 2011 Dark Blue crew which defeated a heavier Cambridge crew, downplayed the disparity, \"It's a big difference but it's a very long race and you have to have the power to carry that weight down the course\".", "| Cox || Ed Bosson|| British ||  || Zoe de Toledo || British || ", "The race was restarted some thirty minutes later, after Garrett had been satisfied that both crews were located as close as possible to where the disruption took place, in rough water caused by the flotilla following the race. Within a minute of the restart, the crews drifted together with Oxford being warned by Garrett, causing a clash of oars which resulted in Oxford's number six, Hanno Wienhausen, breaking the shaft of his blade in half. Broadcast footage of the event showed the Oxford cox, Zoe de Toledo, waving her hand and shouting to the umpire as she believed the damage had been sustained within the first 100 metres and therefore that the race should be stopped; as the Boat Race is not run under World Rowing Federation rules this appeal was swiftly rejected by Garrett, effectively ending the race as a contest. Cambridge rowed away from Oxford to win by  lengths with a consolidated winning time of 17 minutes 23 seconds."]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 2016 Summer Olympics", "response": ["|align=left|Karen BennettOlivia Carnegie-BrownJessica EddieKatie GrevesFrances HoughtonZoe LeePolly SwannMelanie WilsonZoe de Toledo (cox)"]}, {"page": "List of 2016 Summer Olympics medal winners", "response": ["|Katie GrevesMelanie WilsonFrances HoughtonPolly SwannJessica EddieOlivia Carnegie-BrownKaren BennettZoe LeeZoe de Toledo"]}, {"page": "Rowing at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Qualification", "response": ["| 4 || align=left|  || align=left| Karen BennettOlivia Carnegie-BrownJessica EddieKatie GrevesFrances HoughtonZoe LeePolly SwannMelanie WilsonZoe de Toledo (cox)"]}, {"page": "2016 European Rowing Championships", "response": ["|Katie GrevesMelanie WilsonFrances HoughtonPolly SwannJessica EddieOlivia Carnegie-BrownKaren BennettZoe LeeZoe de Toledo || 6:51.46"]}, {"page": "Chronological summary of the 2016 Summer Olympics", "response": ["|Katie GrevesMelanie WilsonFrances HoughtonPolly SwannJessica EddieOlivia Carnegie-BrownKaren BennettZoe LeeZoe de Toledo"]}, {"page": "Zoe De Toledo", "response": ["#REDIRECT Zoe de Toledo"]}, {"page": "2014 British Rowing Senior Championships", "response": ["|Women 8+    || LeanderRosamund Bradbury, Katherine Douglas, Monica Relph, Karen Bennett, Pippa Whittaker, Louisa Reeve, Katie Greves, Polly Swann, Zoe de Toledo (cox)||Imperial College Donna Etiebet, Georgia Francis, Nicola Mason, Sara Parfett, Joanna Thom, Michelle Vezie, Isabell von Loga, Helen Wood, Christopher Au (cox)|| Newcastle UniversitySarah Fabes, Natasha Harris-White, Martha Dixon, Katherine Bulmer, Helen O'Riordan, Bridget Stratford, Emily Ford, Grace Hockenhull, Sasha Adwani (cox)"]}, {"page": "2013 British Rowing Senior Championships", "response": ["|Women 8+    || LeanderCaragh McMurtry, Louisa Reeve, Victoria Meyer-Laker, Pippa Whittaker, Frances Houghton, Polly Swann, Katie Greves, Victoria Thornley, Zoe de Toledo (cox)  || CompositeImogen Walsh, Melanie Wilson, Georgia Francis, Helen Wood, Beth Rodford, Zoe Lee, Helen Glover, Olivia Carnegie-Brown, Morgan Bayham-Williams (cox)||Cambridge UniversityJillian Tovey, Caroline Reid, Kate Ashley, Isabella Vyvyan, Claire Watkins, Melissa Wilson, Holly Game, Emily Day, Esther Monmcilovic (cox)"]}]}}
