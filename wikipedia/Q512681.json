The campaign involving the refusal to pay the tax, together with resistance to warrant sales which local councils held to try to recoup the money, was ultimately successful and Sheridan became a popular political figure. Sheridan denounced those who fought the police in the large-scale riot against the poll tax in London \u2013 which took place on 31 March 1990, the day before the tax was introduced in England and Wales \u2013 and publicly threatened to \"name names\". The police widely advertised for people to tell them the names of alleged rioters, and partly as a result of police acting on such information, over 100 individuals were jailed. With Joan McAlpine, he published A Time to Rage which chronicled the anti-poll tax movement of the late-1980s and early-1990s. McAlpine has since written about the Sheridan she became close to during that turbulent youthful period, with reference in particular to the defamation case."]}, {"page": "Pat Kane", "response": ["Kane was formerly married to Joan McAlpine, an SNP Member of the Scottish Parliament for the South of Scotland region.

The email was later leaked and Lythgoe publicly apologised for making unsubstantiated allegations, with the Labour Party alleging that this was a result of an SNP \"dirty tricks campaign\" against Davidson and calling for an investigation."]}, {"page": "Jim Gellatly", "response": ["He appeared on Scottish TV in STV's search for Scotland's Greatest Album. The show was a joint venture between STV, Real Radio and The Sun who convened a panel of music industry experts to select an initial short list of 60 tracks.
