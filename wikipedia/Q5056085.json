He stood unsuccessfully for the party in Rother Valley at the 1929 general election.  He moved to contest Sheffield Attercliffe at the 1931 election.  Although this was usually a safe Labour Party seat, he was able to win by just 165 votes.  He was heavily defeated at the 1935 election, and was also unsuccessful at the 1939 Colne Valley by-election. He died in Chesterfield, Derbyshire aged 70.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cecil Wilson (politician)", "response": ["At the 1922 general election, Wilson was elected MP for Sheffield Attercliffe.
