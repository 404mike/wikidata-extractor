This was based on an idea of an exclusive authenticity limited to the works of those who had fought and died in the war. It excluded other forms of experience in the war, such as mourning, nursing and the home front, which were more likely to be experienced by other demographics such as women. There were over 500 women writing and publishing poetry during World War I. Examples of poems by female poets include Teresa Hooley's A War Film, Jessie Pope's War Girls, and Mary H.J. Henderson's An Incident. In addition to giving women greater access to work, the war also gave women greater artistic freedom and space to express their identities as artists."]}, {"page": "Dulce et Decorum est", "response": ["Throughout the poem, and particularly strong in the last stanza, there is a running commentary, a letter to Jessie Pope, a civilian propagandist of World War I, who encouraged\u2014\"with such high zest\"\u2014young men to join the battle, through her poetry, e.g. \"Who's for the game?\""]}, {"page": "War correspondent", "response": ["*Jessie Pope; was a pro war journalist and poet during the first world war."]}, {"page": "Pope (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Jessie Pope, English poet"]}, {"page": "Robert Tressell", "response": ["Kathleen mentioned her father's novel in the presence of a visitor to the house where she worked,  Introduction, p. x .

Owen's poem describes a gas attack during World War I and is one of his many anti-war poems that were not published until after the war ended. In the final lines of the poem, the Horatian phrase is described as \"the old lie\".
