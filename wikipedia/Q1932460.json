It was later reduced to a variety of Lycoperdon gemmatum (as L.\u00a0gemmatum var. echinatum; L.\u00a0gemmatum is now known as Lycoperdon perlatum) by Elias Magnus Fries, but American mycologist Charles Horton Peck, who extensively studied the North American distribution of the genus, raised it again to species level in 1879. He thought it worthy of status as a species distinct from L.\u00a0gemmatum because of the different character of its warts, its much spinier appearance, and the smoother surface of the peridium underneath the spines. Miles Joseph Berkeley and Christopher Edmund Broome wrote of the fungus in 1871, but believed their specimen, collected from Reading, Berkshire, by Hoyle, represented a new species, which they called Lycoperdon Hoylei. They wrote that their specimen agreed \"exactly with an authentic specimen of Persoon's L.\u00a0echinatum externally, who could, however, scarcely have overlooked the lilac spores.\" Despite the apparent difference in spore color, L.\u00a0Hoylei is currently considered synonymous with L.\u00a0echinatum.

First described in 1854 by Miles Joseph Berkeley and Christopher Edmund Broome, it was given its current name by Cornelis Bas in 1984. It is characterized by bearing a large fruit body with a brown cap  across. The cap has charcoal-grey patches, which are easily removable. The stipe is  long, white in colour, and there is no ring on it. It is slightly tapered to the top, and has irregular cottony bands girdling the base. The universal veil is grey. Spores are white, spherical in shape, non-amyloid, and measure 10.2\u201311.7 micrometres. The mushrooms are considered edible, but field guides typically advise caution in selecting them for consumption, due to risks of confusion with similar toxic species.
