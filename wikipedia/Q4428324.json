This early line-up had about 4-5 gigs in Autumn 1998 in Oxford and then a gig in London in January 1999. A second guitarist Nik Ammar joined through mutual connections and then Jonathan met drummer Josh Breslaw. After university the band all moved to London and carried on playing together with a regular spot at an Albanian Bar called KOHA. Within a year this core line up started to solidify and the band found a fertile young Jewish urban arts scene in London to grow into and thrive.", "The band then set about auditioning new singers to replace KT Tunstall and started working on a new record. Sophie Solomon started to write for a solo project. Nick Mander went from managing elements of the band's interests and to stepping in as their manager. The band won the Edison Award in Holland.
