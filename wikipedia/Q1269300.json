Boy bands generally do not compose or produce their own material, unless the members lobby hard enough for creative control. However, some bands were created around the talent of a songwriter within the group like Gary Barlow of Take That or Tony Mortimer of East 17. It is not uncommon to find extra songs on an album written by one or more of the band members; however, their producers rarely use these as singles."]}, {"page": "1970", "response": ["** Tony Mortimer, English singer"]}, {"page": "1970 in music", "response": ["*October 21 \u2013 Tony Mortimer, British singer (East 17)"]}, {"page": "Brian Harvey", "response": ["Harvey's vocal style emulated R&B and new jack swing vocalists from the United States.

The single went on to become what was to be the band's final UK number one until their 2006 comeback a decade later. Take That gave what was thought to be their final performance in April 1996 at Amsterdam. Following the band's announcement, millions of their fans were distraught around the world and in the UK alone, teenage girls threatened suicide and were seen lining streets in tears, to the point that telephone hotlines were set up by the government to deal with counselling them. After the band broke up, highly respected music figures such as Elton John noted that Take That were different from other boy bands before and after them, in that they wrote their own material through Gary Barlow. Barlow is one of only a small number of people who have won an Ivor Novello award during their time in a boy band, with George Michael whilst in Wham! and Tony Mortimer whilst in East 17 being two others who have achieved this feat. Take That had also left a legacy of being immaculate performers with a very high work ethic, causing them to be voted in as the greatest boy band of all time."]}, {"page": "Through the Keyhole", "response": ["| 1 || Shayne WardKelly BrookJohnny Vegas || Kimberley WalshWayne SleepTony Mortimer|| 24 December 2016 || Under 3.51"]}, {"page": "United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest 1995", "response": ["Eight acts competed in the televised final on 31 March 1995.
