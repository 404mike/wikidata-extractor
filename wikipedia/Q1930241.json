The local party selected her as its candidate because, though not a dynamic public speaker, Roberts was well-prepared and fearless in her answers; prospective candidate Bill Deedes recalled: \"Once she opened her mouth, the rest of us began to look rather second-rate.\" She attracted media attention as the youngest and the only female candidate. She lost on both occasions to Norman Dodds, but reduced the Labour majority by 6,000, and then a further 1,000. During the campaigns, she was supported by her parents and by future husband Denis Thatcher, whom she married in December 1951. Denis funded his wife's studies for the bar; she qualified as a barrister in 1953 and specialised in taxation. Later that same year their twins Carol and Mark were born, delivered prematurely by Caesarean section."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1945 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Norman Dodds"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1950 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Norman Dodds"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1951 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Norman Dodds"]}, {"page": "Dartford (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Norman Dodds"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1955 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Norman Dodds"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1959 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Norman Dodds"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1964 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Norman Dodds"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1950\u20131979)", "response": ["|Norman Dodds"]}, {"page": "List of Labour Co-operative MPs", "response": ["* Norman Dodds, Dartford, 1945\u20131955; Erith and Crayford, 1955\u20131965"]}, {"page": "James Wellbeloved", "response": ["He was elected Labour Party Member of Parliament (MP) for Erith and Crayford at a 1965 by-election following the death of Norman Dodds, whose constituency chairman he had been."]}, {"page": "Erith and Crayford (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["||1955|| Norman Dodds || Labour Co-op || Previously MP for Dartford from 1945.
