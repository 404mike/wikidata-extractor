Atkins played eleven times, winning in all but his first and last attempts. He first played at Hastings 1904, the first Championship organized by the newly formed British Chess Federation.Coles 1952, pp. 4-5. He tied for first with William Ewart Napier, each scoring 8.5/11. However, Atkins lost the playoff (3\u00a0draws, 1 loss) and was thus relegated to second place.Sergeant, pp. 244, 325. Remarkably, this was to be Atkins' worst result in the Championship for a third of a century. He proceeded to win the next seven Championships: Southport 1905 and Shrewsbury 1906, again scoring 8.5/11 each time; Crystal Palace 1907 (7.5/11); Tunbridge Wells 1908 (8/11); Scarborough 1909, where he tied for first with Joseph Henry Blake, each scoring 8.5/11, but won the playoff with 2.5/3; Oxford 1910 (8.5/11); and Glasgow 1911, tying for first with Frederick Yates at 8.5/11, and winning all three games in the playoff.Sergeant, pp. 245-46, 248, 250, 252, 254, 325-27. Coles writes, \"His success in these years was all the more striking because of his lack of other first-class practice, which not infrequently caused him to get away to a bad start; yet such was his natural ability and determination that he invariably overhauled the field before the end as confidence and skill returned.\" Atkins wrote the introduction to the first edition of Modern Chess Openings (1911).The introduction is reproduced in R.
