A supporter of women running for local elections as a springboard to gaining national voting rights, she ran for office on the Bolton School Board and was successful in her second attempt in 1899. She also ran for office as a Poor Law Guardian, and was successful, but was defeated in her attempt to become a member of the borough council. As a textile worker, Reddish knew first-hand the conditions and wages women experienced and joined unions, working as a paid organiser to help women improve their situations. She was both a socialist and a radical feminist, urging women's equality in the public sphere.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Eva Gore-Booth", "response": ["1902 saw Eva Gore-Booth campaigning at the Clitheroe by-election on behalf of David Shackleton, a Labour candidate that promised Eva he would show support for the women's enfranchisement.  Shackleton was elected yet he did not act upon his promise made to Eva.  This led to the founding of the Lancashire and Cheshire Women Textile and Other Worker's Representation Committee by Eva Gore-Booth, Esther Roper and Sarah Reddish.  The setting up of this committee led to Eva Gore-Booth meeting Christabel Pankhurst who also felt strongly about women's rights.  However, in 1904, Christabel caused some controversy in the Women's Trade Union Council as she attempted to force the council to make women's suffrage one of its aims to which they refused.  This led to the resignation of Eva Gore-Booth from the council. Resigning from that particular council, Eva Gore-Booth alongside Sarah Dickenson who had also resigned, set up the Manchester and Salford Women's Trade and Labour Council.  As part of this council, Eva and other suffragists used constitutional methods of campaigning.  In the general election of 1906, they put forward their own candidate, Thorley Smith yet he was defeated.  In May 1906 Eva was present in the suffrage deputation to Campbell Bannerman.  Her true feeling of helplessness after the failure of this deputation was captured in two poems, which she wrote.  These poems were titled 'Women's Trades on the Embankment' and 'A Lost Opportunity'."]}, {"page": "Reddish (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Sarah Reddish (1850\u20131928), British trade unionist and suffragette"]}, {"page": "Thorley Smith", "response": ["She worked  in partnership with members of Women's Labour and Suffrage societies, the Lancashire and Committee, and leading (male) members of Wigan's labour movement.
