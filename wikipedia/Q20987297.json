In 1861 he went into partnership with Joshua Little (c. 1831\u20131920) as Sinclair & Little, customs and shipping agents. Little and Sinclair dissolved their partnership in January 1865, and Sinclair went into business for himself, using the same warehouse; Little went into partnership with his brother-in-law David Wylie Scott (1833\u20131887).He was a member of the South Australian House of Assembly for the seat of West Torrens from September 1876 to April 1878.\nSinclair and his son Thomas were involved in an extraordinary insolvency case: around 1874 they founded a Customs house shipping agency which over the succeeding four years did a huge amount of business, but came undone with a devaluation of shipping property. The son, who conducted his own defence with distinction, was jailed for a minor matter, and the father was criticised for exercising insufficient control.He acted as Customs Agent and Auditor to Port Adelaide Council and Clerk to the LeFevre's Peninsula District Council, Town Clerk for the Semaphore Corporation and Mayor of Port Adelaide  1866\u20131869 and 1873\u2013\u20131876.\nHe was an obstinate character, not prepared to back down when his mind was set. One time, as Mayor of Port Adelaide, he had posts driven into the road between the rails when the Government was running railway trucks down Commercial Road without consultation.  The Government were equally obstinate, and returned the compliment by placing a whole train of loaded trucks from the barricade to St. Vincent Street, completely obstructing St Vincent Street. Eventually the Mexican standoff resolved itself, but from then on the Government was more circumspect in its dealings with the Port Adelaide Council.", "link_mentions": {}}}
