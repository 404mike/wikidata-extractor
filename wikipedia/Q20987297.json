In 1861 he went into partnership with Joshua Little (c. 1831\u20131920) as Sinclair & Little, customs and shipping agents. Little and Sinclair dissolved their partnership in January 1865, and Sinclair went into business for himself, using the same warehouse; Little went into partnership with his brother-in-law David Wylie Scott (1833\u20131887).He was a member of the South Australian House of Assembly for the seat of West Torrens from September 1876 to April 1878.\nSinclair and his son Thomas were involved in an extraordinary insolvency case: around 1874 they founded a Customs house shipping agency which over the succeeding four years did a huge amount of business, but came undone with a devaluation of shipping property. The son, who conducted his own defence with distinction, was jailed for a minor matter, and the father was criticised for exercising insufficient control.He acted as Customs Agent and Auditor to Port Adelaide Council and Clerk to the LeFevre's Peninsula District Council, Town Clerk for the Semaphore Corporation and Mayor of Port Adelaide  1866\u20131869 and 1873\u2013\u20131876.\nHe was an obstinate character, not prepared to back down when his mind was set. One time, as Mayor of Port Adelaide, he had posts driven into the road between the rails when the Government was running railway trucks down Commercial Road without consultation.  The Government were equally obstinate, and returned the compliment by placing a whole train of loaded trucks from the barricade to St. Vincent Street, completely obstructing St Vincent Street. Eventually the Mexican standoff resolved itself, but from then on the Government was more circumspect in its dealings with the Port Adelaide Council.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Sinclair", "response": ["John Sinclair may refer to:", "*Sir John Sinclair, 1st Baronet (1754\u20131835), politician and writer on agriculture and finance", "*John Sinclair (Australian politician) (1807\u20131890), MLA for North Melbourne", "*Sir John Sinclair, 3rd Baronet (1825\u20131912), Scottish politician and landowner", "*John Sinclair (mayor) (1827\u20131906), mayor of Brisbane", "*John Sinclair (Ayr Burghs MP) (1842\u20131892), Liberal MP for Ayr Burghs ", "*John Sinclair (New Zealand politician) (1850\u20131940), member of the New Zealand Legislative Council", "*John Sinclair, 1st Baron Pentland (1860\u20131925), Scottish politician", "*John Sinclair, 3rd Viscount Thurso (born 1953), British Member of Parliament for Caithness and Sutherland", "*John Sinclair (poet) (born 1941), American poet and political activist", "*John Sinclair (musician) (born 1953), musician, played with Ozzy Osbourne and Uriah Heep", "*Yasus Afari (born 1962), Jamaican dub poet, born John Sinclair", "*\"John Sinclair\", a song by John Lennon on the Some Time in New York City album", "*John Sinklo, sometimes known as John Sinclair, English renaissance actor", "*John Sinclair (bishop) (died 1566), Ordinary Lord and later Lord President in the Court of Session", "*John Sinclair, Lord Murkle (died 1755), Scottish judge", "*John Sinclair, 11th Earl of Caithness (died 1789), Scottish noble", "*John Sinclair (Archdeacon of Middlesex) (1797\u20131875), Scottish Archdeacon of Middlesex", "*John Sinclair (interpreter), Canadian clergyman and interpreter among the Cree in the 19th century", "*John Sinclair (New Zealand) (1843\u20131925), New Zealand carpenter, builder, station manager and harbourmaster", "*John Sinclair (priest) (1853\u20131919), British clergyman, Archdeacon of Cirencester", "*John Sinclair (physician) (1868\u20131940), British physician, Chief Medical Officer to the General Post Office", "*Sir John Sinclair (British Army officer) (1897\u20131977), British Army general, head of the Secret Intelligence Service", "*John Sinclair (Lord Lieutenant of Caithness) (1898\u20131979), Scottish Lord Lieutenant ", "*John Sinclair (environmentalist) (1939\u20132019), Australian environmentalist", "*John Sinclair (footballer) (born 1948), Australian rules footballer for Essendon", "*John Sinclair (German fiction), fictional protagonist of a popular German \"penny dreadful\"", "*John Sinclair (sociologist) (born 1944)"]}, {"page": "Members of the South Australian House of Assembly, 1875\u20131878", "response": [": West Torrens MHA Benjamin Taylor resigned on 19 September 1876.
