He also captained his country. Rotherham is best known for his part in revolutionising half-back play in rugby union, being the first player to demonstrate how a half-back could be the connecting link between the forwards and three-quarters, and thereby paving the way for the passing game within the backs that is practised to the present day. His role in the development of rugby was recognised by the International Rugby Board in 2011 with induction to the IRB Hall of Fame under the theme of innovation and creativity.", "link_mentions": {}}}
