Upon hearing of his promotion, Judge Graves remarked, \"They must be handing out silk gowns with pounds of tea nowadays!\" He particularly loves the operas of Wagner, and his and Phyllida's children are named Tristan and Isolde. He frowns upon Rumpole's clientele, having a largely civil practice, with only an occasional criminal prosecution. Despite this attitude, Rumpole helps Erskine-Brown out in important personal matters without Erskine-Brown's knowledge, and is displeased when he makes the acquaintance of one of Erskine-Brown's schoolmates, who mentions that since Erskine-Brown was a 'pill' at school he warranted bullying. He attended Bogstead School, Winchester College and New College, Oxford.", "Rumpole of the Bailey made its Thames Television debut on 3 April 1978 in a series of six episodes.
