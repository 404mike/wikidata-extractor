He made 20 starts for the club's reserve team in 1996\u201397, and broke into the senior team for the first time the following season. He made a goalscoring debut against Bury on 12 September 1997, but did not make any further starts for the club, two substitute appearances providing his only other first team action.He subsequently played for Southend, Carlisle (where he scored once against Mansfield Town) and Doncaster Rovers. He joined Macclesfield Town in January 2005, where he later became captain, leading out the side for their 2007 FA Cup tie against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. He signed a new contract in June 2007, but left Macclesfield four months later after his contract was cancelled by mutual consent following a particularly poor performance in a 3\u20132 defeat at Accrington.Morley joined Bangor City in 2009, where he made 113 league appearances over four years, scoring twenty-one goals; he departed in July 2013 for Bala Town, where he spent the 2013-2014 season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2003 Football Conference play-off Final", "response": ["Ten minutes into the second half Doncaster were two goals in front thanks to Dave Morley's header, which a Dagenham defender got an inadvertent hand to, with the ball rebounding in off the post. Dagenham battled on and got a goal back through Mark Stein, who netted after a knock down from target man Steve West. They then levelled the scores when Tarkan Mustafa scored arguably the goal of the game. He received a good ball from Paul Terry on the right, ran at the Rovers defence and shot past Andy Warrington into the far corner of the net.", "|DF ||4 ||Dave Morley"]}, {"page": "David Morley (footballer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Dave Morley"]}, {"page": "David Morley", "response": ["* Dave Morley (born 1977), English footballer"]}, {"page": "2010 Welsh Cup Final", "response": ["|DF ||4 || Dave Morley || "]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Welsh Premier League", "response": ["| Dave Morley"]}, {"page": "2011 Welsh Cup Final", "response": ["|DF ||4 || Dave Morley || "]}, {"page": "2006\u201307 Macclesfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|4||align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Dave Morley"]}, {"page": "Tully (2018 film)", "response": ["| Robin Hackl, Dave Morley, Tara Conley & Matt Yeoman"]}, {"page": "1998\u201399 Southend United F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Dave Morley"]}]}}
