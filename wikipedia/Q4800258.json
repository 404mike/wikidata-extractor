He joined the nursery staff at Derby in 1914, but in the First World War served with the Coldstream Guards. He made his debut for Derbyshire in the 1919 season against Lancashire in May. In his second match against Leicestershire, opening the batting with Leonard Oliver, he made his top score of 73 in a game Derbyshire won by 9 wickets. Subsequently, as his performance failed to live up to his initial promise, he found himself slipping down the batting order as the season progressed. He played three matches at the start of the 1920 season before he severed his connection with Derbyshire and went to live at Stainforth, near Doncaster.Severn played 24 innings in 13 first-class matches with a top score of 73 and an average of 15.50.Severn died at Stainforth at the age of 55.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1919", "response": ["The season marked the beginning of Guy Jackson's long association with the club.
