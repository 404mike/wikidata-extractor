Rollin financed his 1973 film La Rose de Fer (The Iron Rose) himself and was convinced that it would become a failure, leading to financial ruin. Prior to production, he engaged in a deal with Impex films to direct a number of hardcore porn films in the near future in order to produce La rose de fer and ensure that it would not fail. The story follows two young lovers (Fran\u00e7oise Pascal and Hugues Quester) who meet at a wedding reception and agree to go on a date, for which they decide to take a walk in an enormous cemetery. As they make love in an underground tomb, strange and bizarre occurrences take place above ground. As night falls, they frantically try to escape from the cemetery, and with no luck, end up where they started. They are slowly overcome with hysteria and paranoia which brings about their mortality. The film was shot in the city of Amiens over a four-week period and premiered at the 2nd Annual Convention of the Fantastique in Paris in April 1973 and was initially met with a negative reception and as a result, Rollin was unable to find anyone to back his future personal projects."]}, {"page": "Mind Your Language", "response": ["* Fran\u00e7oise Pascal (29 episodes) as Danielle Favre (series 1\u20133), an amorous young French Catholic au pair who instantly grabs the attention of all the men, including Mr. Brown.

The two first met when they co-starred on a 1972 episode of the television anthology series, BBC Play of the Month, and quickly became \"firm friends\". Pascal recalled that they remained friends for several years before regretfully losing touch after Frederick married Sellers in 1977. In April 2020, a few weeks before the 26th anniversary of Frederick's death, Pascal tweeted a photo of herself and Frederick, with the caption \"I think of her very often! Always had that fresh baby face! RIP Lynne! Xxx\".", "Over time, views towards Frederick's image gradually shifted, and she soon gained a cult following through her films, and has been described as one of the most promising, talented, and beautiful young British actresses of the 1970s. Many credit the negative events in her life (the loss of her acting career, blacklisting in Hollywood, and untimely death) to her marriage to Sellers. Even Roger Lewis, who was blunt about his disdain for Frederick, admitted that \"of all of Sellers's wives, Lynne Frederick was the most poorly treated\". One of the first people to advocate for Lynne was American author, Ed Sikov, in the 2002 book, Mr. Strangelove: A Biography of Peter Sellers: \"Lynne Frederick deserves a bit of compassion herself in retrospect. It was the helpless Peter she nursed, the dependent and infantile creature of impulse and consequent contradiction. Patiently she ministered him\". Other people who have defended or come forward with positive recollections of Frederick over the years include Judy Matheson, Fran\u00e7oise Pascal, John Moulder-Brown, Mark Burns, Fabio Testi, Malcolm McDowell, and Graham Crowden."]}, {"page": "List of Penthouse Pets", "response": ["|1970 ||None||Katherine Mannering||Tamara Santerra||Ilse Hasek||Stephanie McLean||Benedikte Andersen||Christina Lindberg||Polly Anne Pendleton||Fran\u00e7oise Pascal||Tina McDowall||Heide Mann||Franca Petrov||Jennifer Furse"]}, {"page": "There's a Girl in My Soup", "response": ["* Fran\u00e7oise Pascal as Paola"]}, {"page": "Richard Johnson (actor)", "response": ["By his first marriage, to Sheila Sweet, Johnson had two children, tabletop games designer Jervis Johnson (b. 1959) and actress Sorel Johnson.
