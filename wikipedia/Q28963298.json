He was born in Redhill, Surrey and died in Balham, London.\nBullock was the son of the surveyor for the town council of Mitcham, and was long associated with the Mitcham Cricket Club. He was described as a draughtsman when he joined the Royal Flying Corps in November 1915 and then the Royal Air Force in 1918 when it was formed. His trade was a Rigger Aero until he was discharged in 1919.Bullock began playing cricket fairly regularly for Surrey's second eleven from 1920, and made his first-class cricket debut that year in a match for a \"Gentlemen of the South\" team in a game for the benefit of the \"pavilion attendant\" at The Oval; he neither batted nor bowled in a rain-ruined match. From 1922 to 1924, he played in five matches for the Surrey first team as an opening or middle-order batsman. He played as an amateur, and his highest first-class score was an innings of 40 in his first Surrey game, against Scotland in 1922. He did not play first-class cricket after 1924 and his last game for Surrey's second eleven was in 1925. In 1926 and 1927, he was employed as a cricket coach to the South Norfolk Cricket Club.Returning to the London area, in 1939 Bullock was a licensed victualler at the Regent Arms in Westminster. He later became the licensee at the King's Head, an old coaching inn next to Mitcham Cricket Green and the cricket club pavilion, and after his death in 1954 the inn, which is a Grade II listed building, was renamed the \"Burn Bullock\" in his honour: as of 2017, it is currently closed.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Australian Imperial Force Touring XI", "response": ["As advertised in the poster, Mitcham hoped to include Jack Hobbs, Andy Sandham and Herbert Strudwick but none of these took part on the day. Mitcham's sixteen was bolstered by the inclusion of three guest players, one of them Bill Stirling. The other two were Surrey wicketkeeper Dennis Sullivan, who was born in Mitcham, and amateur Burnett Bullock, who was \"mine host\" at the public house opposite the ground that now bears his name. Mitcham batted first and scored 200 all out, their captain Howard Lacey making the top score with 39. Trenerry and Collins shared twelve of the fifteen wickets while Gregory was bowled sparingly. The AIF included a couple of players from their second eleven but they won easily by five wickets, though Stirling took the wickets of Murray and Docker cheaply."]}, {"page": "Burn Bullock", "response": ["#REDIRECTBurnett Bullock"]}]}}
