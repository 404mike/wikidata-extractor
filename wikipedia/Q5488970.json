The area was the UK's leading producer of bricks for much of the twentieth century. Brick-making had been a small seasonal craft since the early nineteenth century, but during the 1890s successful experiments at Fletton using the harder clays from a lower level had resulted in a much more efficient process.Davies (pp.23\u201324). The market dominance during this period of the London Brick Company, founded by the prolific Scottish builder and architect John Cathles Hill, gave rise to some of the country's most well-known landmarks, all built using the ubiquitous Fletton Brick.London Brick: 130 Years of History 1877\u20132007  Hanson Building Products, 2007.

This follows the closure to traffic of the original junction 4 on slip road and removal of the off slip road on safety grounds. At the same time the original on slip road to the Frank Perkins Parkway which actually joined the Fletton Parkway was closed and a new direct on slip road constructed to the north of junction 4.
