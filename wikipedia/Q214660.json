His work was influenced by Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus, among others.\nAfter leaving Oxford University, Fowles taught English at a school on the Greek island of Spetses, a sojourn that inspired The Magus (1965), an instant best-seller that was directly in tune with 1960s \"hippy\" anarchism and experimental philosophy. This was followed by The French Lieutenant's Woman (1969), a Victorian-era romance with a postmodern twist that was set in Lyme Regis, Dorset, where Fowles lived for much of his life. Later fictional works include The Ebony Tower (1974), Daniel Martin (1977), Mantissa \n(1982), and A Maggot (1985).\nFowles's books have been translated into many languages, and several have been adapted as films.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "March 31", "response": ["*1926 \u2013 John Fowles, English novelist (d. 2005)"]}, {"page": "November 5", "response": ["*2005 \u2013 John Fowles, English novelist (b. 1926)"]}, {"page": "University of Oxford", "response": ["Writers associated with Oxford include Vera Brittain, A.S.

Much of it was also highly romanticised and not always historically accurate. Anning has been referenced in several historical novels, most notably in The French Lieutenant's Woman (1969) by John Fowles, who was critical of the fact that no British scientist had named a species after her in her lifetime. As Anning's biographer Shelley Emling noted, this contrasted with some of the prominent geologists who had used her finds, such as William Buckland and Roderick Murchison, who ended up with multiple fossil species named after them. The only person who did name a species after Anning during her lifetime was the Swiss-American naturalist, Louis Agassiz. In the early 1840s, he named two fossil fish species after Anning \u2013 Acrodus anningiae, and Belenostomus anningiae \u2013 and another after her friend Elizabeth Philpot. Agassiz was grateful for the help the women had given him in examining fossil fish specimens during his visit to Lyme Regis in 1834. After Anning's death, other species, including the ostracod Cytherelloidea anningi, and two genera, the therapsid reptile genus Anningia, and the bivalve mollusc genus Anningella, were named in her honour. In 2012, the plesiosaur genus Anningasaura was named after Anning and the species Ichthyosaurus anningae was named after her in 2015."]}, {"page": "Shakers", "response": ["Novelist John Fowles wrote in 1985 A Maggot, a postmodern historical novel culminating in the birth of Ann Lee, and describing early Shakers in England."]}, {"page": "Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay", "response": ["| The novel by John Fowles", "| The novel by John Fowles"]}, {"page": "Lewes", "response": ["The Collector by John Fowles is set near Lewes with the characters visiting the town, and the Roy Grace crime series by Peter James (writer) based in Brighton has scenes set in Sussex Police HQ based in Lewes.
