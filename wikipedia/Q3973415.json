They almost went a goal behind when Frank Stapleton's header forced goalkeeper Ray Clemence into action. Seven minutes before the interval, Terry McDermott scored for Liverpool. The midfielder collected a pass from Ray Kennedy who surged through the centre, turned left and from outside the penalty area struck the ball low into the bottom left-hand corner. Arsenal began the second half with more vigour, but struggled to suppress Liverpool's attacks. Alan Kennedy found space to shoot after a one-two with Ray, but his effort went over the post. Arsenal were forced to make a substitution around the hour mark after Sammy Nelson collided with McDermott and was concussed; Willie Young replaced him. Liverpool extended their lead minutes later. Alan Hansen intercepted an Arsenal attack, strode forward and passed the ball to Dalglish. The striker approached the penalty area, cut inside Steve Walford and curled the ball into the right-hand corner. John Hollins came on for David Price, at which point Liverpool scored their third. Dalglish dispossessed Liam Brady, but tripped himself in the process. Johnson collected the ball and played it back to Dalglish, who charged forward and sprayed a pass towards McDermott, the furthest forward player on the right. The midfielder's shot went under the legs of Pat Jennings and into the goal. Alan Sunderland scored a late goal for Arsenal having combined well with Stapleton. This did not dampen the spirits of the Liverpool spectators, who chanted, \"What's it like to be outclassed?\" and, \"Why are we so great?\" during the course of the 90 minutes.", "|DF ||6 || Steve Walford"]}, {"page": "List of Norwich City F.C. players", "response": ["|Steve Walford"]}, {"page": "1979\u201380 Liverpool F.C. season", "response": ["|DF ||6 || Steve Walford"]}, {"page": "1983\u201384 West Ham United F.C. season", "response": ["The season started well for West Ham with them winning their first five games.
