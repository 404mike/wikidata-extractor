G. Jung (London 1968) p. 40   The first to appear, and the closest to the ego, would be the shadow or personal unconscious - something which is at the same time the first representation of the total personality, and which may indeed be at times conflated with the Self.Barbara Hannah, Striving towards Wholeness (Boston 1988) p. 25von Franz \"Process\" p. 182-3 Next to appear would be the Anima and Animus, the soul-image, which may be taken as symbolising the whole Self.C.

Jung, Alchemical Studies (London 1978) p. 268 Ideally however, the animus or anima comes into play in a mediating role between the ego and the Self.von Franz \"Process\" p. 193 and p. 195 The third main archetype to emerge is the Mana figure of the wise old man/womanJ.

Owens, Jung in Love: The Mysterium in Liber Novus, 39\u201340. She became his primary intellectual collaborator. At the same time, their relationship became increasingly intimate. The intensity of Jung's relationship with Wolff initially caused tensions in his marriage, but eventually an understanding of sorts was reached,John Kerr, A Dangerous Method (2012) p. 503 as it became abundantly clear that Jung would not give up either his wife or Toni, whom he called his \"second wife\". He had been looking for an \"Anima woman\", and Wolff fit the role well. She was a frequent visitor to the Jung family home, occasionally working with C. G. on projects in his home office from late morning until the family lunch (from which she was excluded), and then continuing in the afternoon. Wolff usually joined the family for Sunday noonday dinners. In 1916, she, Jung, and Emma, attended the opening of the Psychology Club of Zurich. Jung was commonly accompanied by both Wolff and his wife at public and private functions.Barbara Hannah, Jung: His Life and Work, A Biographical Memoir (1976), pp. 117\u201322. This arrangement satisfied what Jung had termed \"my polygamous components\",Quoted in John Kerr, A Dangerous Method (2012) p. 209 and fit into his lifelong habit of distributing his affections for safety among a number of his so-called Jungfrauen.N. R. Goldenberg, Reinventing the Body (1993) p. 140 However, some interpreters claim that the marital arrangement undercut Toni's and Emma's self-esteem and caused both an enormous amount of pain.Claire Douglas, Translate this Darkness (1997) p. 134 Wolff and Jung spent much of their private time at Bollingen Tower, the personal retreat house that Jung built in the early 1920s.", "After his heart attack in 1944, Jung moved away from Wolff emotionally. She no longer carried his anima and no longer served as his special muse. Upon her death in 1953, Jung did not attend her memorial service. His associate Barbara Hannah cites his health, as well as his strong feelings of grief, as the primary reasons. Jung's wife attended Wolff's memorial on behalf of both of them.Barbara Hannah, Jung: His Life and Work, A Biographical Memoir (1976), pp. 312\u20133. In memory of Wolff, Jung carved a memorial stone to honor her that read, in Chinese characters arranged vertically, \"Toni Wolff Lotus Nun Mysterious\".Henderson, J.L. in Champernowne, A Memoir of Toni Wolff (1980), p. 4 Just before his death, he told his colleague, Laurens van der Post, that Wolff had supplied the \"fragrance\" of his life, while his wife, Emma, had supplied \"the foundation\".", "*Barbara Hannah"]}]}}
