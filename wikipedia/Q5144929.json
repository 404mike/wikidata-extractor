It was a pioneer of distance learning programmes in theology, and made new theological thinking and research accessible to a wide audience through its A5-sized Grove Booklet series (now published through an independent company and also available online). In the 1990s it ran the earliest forms of what would become known as context-based training in the Church of England, and latterly provided part-time pathways alongside more traditional forms of full-time residential training. In 2014 the college announced that it would be placing greater emphasis on contextual and part-time routes for licensed ministry and independent students, while maintaining and developing its ongoing provision of children's and youth ministry education, blended learning and distance learning. In February 2017 it gained planning permission for the redevelopment of its site and the modernisation of its main academic facilities. In late 2019 the college announced that delivery of its youth ministry programmes would be moving to a new location in central Leicester, and that its Distance Learning provision would be taken forward in collaboration with Queen's College, Birmingham. These changes coincided with the inauguration of a new hub of the Anglican-based St Mellitus College in central Nottingham.", "*Colin Buchanan (1979 to 1985)"]}, {"page": "Bishop of Woolwich", "response": ["|align=\"center\"| 1996 ||align=\"center\"| 2005 || Colin Buchanan || Formerly Bishop of Aston"]}, {"page": "Colin Buchanan", "response": ["Colin Buchanan  is the name of:", "*Colin Buchanan (musician) (born 1964), Australian entertainer", "*Colin Buchanan (actor) (born 1966), Scottish actor", "*Colin Buchanan (town planner) (1907\u20132001), British town planner", "*Colin Buchanan (bishop) (born 1934), Church of England bishop"]}, {"page": "St Mary's Church, Cheadle", "response": ["* Colin Buchanan, later Principal of St John's College, Nottingham and a bishop, served his curacy here.

The communion service was designed to remove any hint of consecration or change in the bread and wine. Instead of unleavened wafers, ordinary bread was to be used. The prayer of invocation was removed, and the minister no longer said \"the body of Christ\" when delivering communion. Rather, he said, \"Take and eat this, in remembrance that Christ died for thee, and feed on him in thy heart by faith, with thanksgiving\". Christ's presence in the Lord's Supper was a spiritual presence \"limited to the subjective experience of the communicant\". Anglican bishop and scholar Colin Buchanan interprets the prayer book to teach that \"the only point where the bread and wine signify the body and blood is at reception\".

In describing Cranmer's changes to the communion service in the 1552 Book of Common Prayer, Colin Buchanan writes, \"the only 'moment' is reception\u2014and the only point where the bread and wine signify the body and blood is at reception\", when the communicants remembered Christ's offering of himself on the cross.

Somewhere between the 10th and 12th centuries, a change occurred in which the table itself was moved to be fixed against the east wall, and the president stood before it, facing east, with his back to the people.\" This change, according to Buchanan, \"was possibly precipitated by the coming of tabernacles for reservation, which were ideally both to occupy a central position and also to be fixed to the east wall without the president turning his back to them.\"", "In spite of the legal prohibition, adoption of the eastward position became normal in the succeeding decades in most provinces of the Anglican Church with the exception of the Church of Ireland. Then, from the 1960s onward, the westward position largely replaced both eastward position and north side and, in the view of Colin Buchanan, \"has proved a reconciling force within Anglican usage\".Colin Buchanan.
