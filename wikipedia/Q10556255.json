Described as \"quick on his toes\", he made an encouraging debut against Colchester United on 23 September, setting up the winning goal for Henry Horton. Despite this promise, he was unable to secure a regular place in the side, with Hoskins returning after six matches. From mid-November onwards, Digby made five further appearances, including three at outside-right in place of John Flood."]}]}}
