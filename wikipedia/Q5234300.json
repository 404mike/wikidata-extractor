From the start the visitors looked like they would get goals with Dunfermline's defence being torn apart, especially by a lively Chris Humphrey. The breakthrough finally came when Keith Lasley and Michael Higdon combined with Higdon curling in from the edge of the area. Tom Hateley nearly made it two a few minutes later with a free-kick hitting the post. But it was only a short respite for Dunfermline as Motherwell scored again, Jamie Murphy strolled past Gary Mason and was given time to hit a 20-yard shot which heavily deflected off Alex Keddie and into the net. In the second half things hadn't changed with Motherwell dominating and when Chris Humphrey was allowed to cut inside into the box his shot clipped the post and into the net. Dunfermline then started to attack, pushing Motherwell back, and were rewarded when David Graham's 25-yard shot flicked off Joe Cardle and into the net, with Cardle claiming the goal. Cardle then bagged another as he cut into the box and his shot deflected off Stephen Craigan and past the helpless keeper. With two minutes to go Dunfermline pushed forward, but were counter-attacked and Higdon's late finish from a cross by Nicky Law finished the game. Final Score:2\u20134</", "The home side could have been three up within the first half an hour with Kirk, Jason Thomson and Alex Keddie all putting chances wide. Dunfermline were controlling the game until, against the run off play, Hibs scored. A throw-in on the right, just inside Dunfermline's half, was flicked on to Ivan Sproule, who walked through some poor defending to easily slot home. Hibs then took charge of the game and Paul Gallacher had to make a super one-on-one save from Garry O'Connor. However, in the second half O'Connor's shot, after being allowed to turn by Austin McCann, deflected off Keddie and past the hapless Gallacher. Dunfermline then attacked and were rewarded under two minutes later after Ryan Thomson powered through the Hibs team and finished well. A Joe Cardle drive was then parried out to J. Thomson who scuffed his shot off Paul Hanlon and into the net. Dunfermline nearly won the game with attempts from Cardle, Andrew Barrowman and the impressive David Graham, all not finding the goal. Final Score:2\u20132</", "This was a game which showed the gulf of class between the Old Firm and the rest of the league. Rangers took the lead in less than 10 minutes with a Carlos Bocanegra header from a corner. A few minutes later Maurice Edu fired home an excellent shot from 20 yards to make it 2\u20130. A penalty appeal for Rangers was then turned down, despite J Thomson appearing to be holding onto Bocanegra. Steven Naismith was then lucky not to be sent off as he elbowed Austin McCann in the face during a free-kick. The referee missed it, but he was caught by the cameras and subsequently banned.</ Allan McGregor then had his first save to make after Paul Burns's bouncing shot had to be turned away. Early in the second half a through ball by Steven Davis was slotted home by Naismith to make it 3\u20130. McGregor then was forced into a fine save after David Graham got one-on-one with him after a fine through ball by Andrew Barrowman. Naismith then finished off the scoring after a fast break by Rangers left them five on three against Dufermline and an unselfish Nikica Jelavic squared it for Naismith's second off the day. It would have been more if Paul Gallacher hadn't made some excellent saves including two free-kicks from Davis and Jelavic as well as 35-yard volley from Steven Whittaker. Dunfermline gave the ball away far too many times during the game with Gary Mason and J Thomson the worst offenders. Final Score 0\u20134</", "A dull game was won by the visitors after two mistakes cost Dunfermline two goals.</ Hearts had the best of the first half with David Templeton having an early shot deflected wide by John Potter. Later, Rudi Skacel had his shot turned round the post for a corner by Paul Gallacher. From the resulting corner front post man Kirk failed in his attempted clearance, merely flicking the ball backwards onto Andy Webster's head and from inside the 6-yard box, he could not miss. Neither side had many clear-cut chances with Dunfermline's chances coming from a sliced Paddy Boyle cross over the bar, and a mazy run from David Graham finishing with a shot straight into the keeper's arms. Hearts went close from a long shot by Danny Grainger and a header by the same. Boyle then gave the ball away with a terrible pass straight to Templeton whose shot was saved by Gallacher, but the rebound put away by Skacel. Final score 0\u20132</", "An already hard task away at one of the Old Firm was made harder in just over 5 minutes, when Paul Willis played a backwards pass straight to Gary Hooper who took two touches into the box and fired home across the box into the bottom left hand corner. Alex Keddie then gave the ball away on the half-way line and Jamie Forrest, Hooper and Kris Commons combined to switch the ball across to the left hand side to Anthony Stokes. He drove low at goal and Paul Gallacher's parry reached Hooper who flicked it backwards to Forrest, who smashed in into the roof of the net. A long range drive from Biram Kayal was then saved by Gallacher's stretched leg. Dunfermline then had a penalty appeal turned away after Daniel Majstorovi\u0107 climbed over the back off Ryan Thomson. Celtic continued to look for a second and Gallacher and Keddie combined to keep out Commons after a low cross from the left by Stokes. Stokes then somehow missed from two yards out, mistiming his back post volley. In the second half Paul Burns felled Forrest in the box, to give away a penalty. Ki then sent Gallacher the wrong way, but hit the outside of the post, from the spot. Stokes then missed a one-on-one chance, hitting the post again. Joe Cardle went close for the Pars, cutting inside from the left forcing Fraser Forster into a good low save. He then made another as Liam Buchanan was sent through, but the keep was out fast to block the attempted chip. David Graham then laid off Andrew Barrowman in the right hand corner of the box, and his low drive across goal found the net. Final score 1\u20132</", "The visitors started strongly, on a day with hollowing gales swirling through the stadium, with some early chances. Rory Fallon just failed to make contact with a low cross and Josh Magennis somehow failed to score in a goalmouth scramble. He then vented his anger by shoving the home keeper in the chest and full in the face. However, the referee inexplicably decided that the violent conduct from him merited only a yellow card. The home fans were even more infuriated when Paul Willis tried to take a quick free-kick, and apparently was deemed to have committed an equal offence as Magennis, so was yellow carded for his effort. Andy Kirk should have hit the target with a turning snap-shot, and David Graham was also guilty of missing the target with a close range diving header after an excellent move by Dufermline. Aberdeen were looking dangerous from set-pieces and deservedly took the lead right on half-time with a header by Andrew Considine from a Fraser Fyvie corner. Paddy Boyle was then lucky to escape with a yellow after his two-footed challenge on Fyvie. Dunfermline then equalised from a Graham corner, Andrew Barrowman's header was blocked on the line, but he was first on hand to put away the rebound. Then, from Willis's superb diagonal ball, Graham cut inside from the left and rifled inside the near post of David Gonzalez to take the lead. Aberdeen nearly stuck back straight away with Youl Mawene keeping the ball away from Paul Gallacher and cutting it back, only for Magennis to miss the target with no keeper in the goal. Boyle did well to turn past the defenders and force in shot which was parried to Liam Buchanan, whose first touch coming on as a sub was to make it 3\u20131. Immediately from the restart Gallacher saved one-on-one with Magennis, showing Aberdeen could score again. From a quick Martin Hardie free-kick, Buchanan cut the ball back and Barrowman looked odds on the score, only for Gonzalez to somehow tip his point blank range onto the post. Straight away Aberdeen won a corner and from it Alex Keddie headed in an own goal. From then on it was all Aberdeen, and the visitors final scored a fourth. From a long throw-in Magennis managed to turn a smash home the equaliser. Final score 3\u20133.</", "|David Graham", "|David Graham"]}, {"page": "David Graham (footballer born 1983)", "response": ["#REDIRECT David Graham (footballer, born 1983)"]}]}}
