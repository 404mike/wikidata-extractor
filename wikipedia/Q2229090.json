The Pope died in Naples on 7 December, five days after the disastrous battle of Foggia in which the papal army was soundly defeated and lost over 4,000 men.

Adams) During the election process, there was a dispute among the cardinals regarding the political orientation of the papacy. Three of them, Hugh of Saint-Cher, Guglielmo Fieschi and Ottobuono de' Fieschi supported the maintenance of the late Innocent's active foreign policy in the Holy Roman Empire and the Italian Peninsula (especially against Conradin), while John of Toledo, Ottaviano degli Ubaldini, Rinaldo di Jenne (the elected Pope Alexander IV) and Gil Torres opposed it. Alongside Jacobus de Porta, Riccardo Annibaldi and Giovanni Gaetano Orsini (future Pope Nicholas III), Stephen B\u00e1ncsa represented a neutral stance. B\u00e1ncsa subscribed regularly throughout the reign of Alexander IV as a member of the Pope's closest group of advisors. During his time in Naples, Cardinal B\u00e1ncsa served as papal Auditor in the case of Bishop Ponce of Urgel; on 15 December 1254, he confirmed the sentence against Ponce for simony, incest, and other charges, and suspended Ponce; the sentence was confirmed by Alexander IV on 7 January 1255.Registres d' Alexandre IV  Tome I, p. 24, no 93.

It was the last Hohenstaufen possession to hold out against the brothers.

Conrad, however, died suddenly, of malaria, on 21 May 1254.  On 8 October, Pope Innocent set off to the south, with a papal army commanded by his nephew, the Legate Cardinal Guglielmo Fieschi, intent upon putting an end to Manfred and end once and for all the Hohenstaufen threat to the Papacy. On 23 October 1254, Innocent, who was at Capua at the time, detached Amalfi from its traditional obedience to the Kings of Sicily and received it directly into his own power.  This was a direct threat to Manfred and his control of the Kingdom of Naples. On 26 October, Manfred fled from Teano, whose loyalty was doubtful,Nicholas of Jamsilla, 522-527 and fled to his loyal Saracens in the town of Lucera.  At Lucera he had access to the Imperial treasury, with which he could pay his troops.  From Lucera he led an army, principally composed of Germans (and deserters from the papal army), against the papal army. The armies met at Foggia on 2 December, and the Papal army was soundly defeated. Four thousand papal mercenaries were killed. Cardinal Guglielmo fled to Naples.  Five days after the battle, on the Feast of S. Andrew, 7 December, around the time of Vespers, Innocent IV himself died, attended by the spiritual ministrations of Cardinal Rinaldo dei Conti di Segni.  He and the Papal Curia had been staying in Naples, the Pope occupying the palazzo that had once belonged to Frederick II's secretary, Peter de la Vigne.
