He worked for British game developer Rare from 1995 to 2008. He was senior designer at the company. Botwood's first work was GoldenEye 007.\nHe was one of the first members of the team and worked closely with Martin Hollis and David Doak. Botwood constructed the levels and did most motion capture with head model designer, Beatrix. He next worked on Perfect Dark as level designer, wrote the story of game and designed the way weapons would work. He later worked on Perfect Dark Zero, designing the multiplayer.Botwood provided voice talent to some of the projects on which he  worked, voicing \"Andross\" in Star Fox Adventures, and \"Mr Blonde\" in Perfect Dark. He had a cameo in GoldenEye 007 as \"Naval Officer\". Botwood left Rare in 2008 and worked for Ubisoft Montpellier. He then worked at Codemasters before joining Ubisoft Toronto in 2012 as a Lead Level Designer. In 2016 he was promoted to Associate Level Design Director on an unannounced project.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "GoldenEye 007 (1997 video game)", "response": ["Work on GoldenEye 007 began in January 1995 with a team hired by Hollis: programmer Mark Edmonds, background artist Karl Hilton, and character artist B. Jones. Edmonds focused on creating a game engine that could render 3D graphics from art packages into Nintendo 64 data structures. Hilton modelled levels based on the film material, while Jones constructed characters based on photos and costumes they had. Since final Nintendo 64 specifications and development kits were not initially available to Rare, the team had to estimate the finalised console's capabilities using an SGI Onyx workstation and Nintendo's custom NINGEN development software. In the following months, designer Duncan Botwood joined the team to construct the levels. The first year was spent producing art assets and developing the engine, which originally only allowed the player and enemies to move around a virtual environment."]}, {"page": "Perfect Dark", "response": ["In spring 1999, Rare moved its headquarters from a country farmhouse in Twycross, Leicestershire to its current multi-million office complex. Although the locations are a few minutes away from each other, the move caused minor disruptions for some. Rare installed an in-house motion capture studio, which was used to capture hit animations and full walk cycles. Game designer Duncan Botwood wore a pair of heels to portray Joanna Dark in some sessions, but motion capture artist Laurie Sage performed most of her moves. Many of the game opponents were based on members of the development team, who also performed the motion capture required for their animation. Numerous secrets were added to the game to fuel the exploration efforts of players, including a piece of cheese hidden in every level. These were deliberately placed by one of the level editors as a graphical oddity for the player's confusion. The game has two hidden passwords: one found by picking up a necklace in one level and another by reaching the highest rank in the multiplayer mode. Rare had originally intended these details to access password-protected sections of promotional websites and use them for an alternate reality game."]}, {"page": "Stafford", "response": ["*Duncan Botwood (born 1972 in Stafford) video game designer and voice actorIMDb Database  Retrieved 27 January 2018."]}, {"page": "Perfect Dark Zero", "response": ["Initially, the game had a heavy anime style and Joanna Dark received many alterations throughout the development process. Lead Art Director Wil Overton explained that they \"wanted to bring her back in line with the way Rare do things. [...] We sorta wanted to stylize her up a bit and make her more iconic\". However, the designers ultimately decided to tone down the styling of the game a bit. The Xbox 360 gave the developers more possibilities to include what they always wanted and allowed them to create the game's co-operative mode, which was one of the first that could be played via Xbox Live. Designing the co-operative mode over Xbox Live was very challenging for the developers. According to Duncan Botwood, who was responsible for most of the multiplayer, \"it was quite an effort to put it in, to be honest. You have to cater for a number of eventualities you just don't get normally. We think we pulled it off, and because we pulled it off, other people might feel inspired to put the effort in, and we think that's a good thing\".", "When the game was released, new multiplayer scenarios and a Counter-Operative mode similar to that of the original Perfect Dark were originally intended to be released as downloadable content. Game designer Duncan Botwood later clarified that it was unlikely to happen due to technical issues. According to him, \"it would have required much groundwork to be laid in the core AI code, which meant that it was unlikely to be available as downloadable content post-release\". He also remarked that the Counter-Operative mode was planned during the development of the game, but the idea was ultimately discarded due to the pressure to cut planned content. In May 2006, an auto-update was made available on Xbox Live, responsible for fixing some bugs and adding new multiplayer options to the game. The bug fixes included code to prevent an ongoing problem where players could walk through the air, an issue where some weapons could make use of rapid fire, and a map-exiting glitch, among others. The new multiplayer options provided seven new bot types and the ability to use bots in DarkOps matches, since bots had only one AI variant and were only available in DeathMatch scenarios when the game was released."]}, {"page": "Conker: Live & Reloaded", "response": ["* Duncan Botwood"]}]}}
