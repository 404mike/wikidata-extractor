According to soccer historian David Wagner, New York City's \"hugely influential media was likely to make or break the entire venture.\" The New York Generals were originally founded and owned by RKO General (which at the time also owned WOR-TV) and Wall Street investor Peter Elser. The team's gold and green color scheme was based on that of the Green Bay Packers, which had been one of the more successful gridiron football teams of that time. The contrasting colors were also chosen with consideration towards viewers of black and white television, which was still fairly common in the United States at this time (as one team director said, they were \"good colors for television\"). The team's name was chosen as a direct reference to their owner, RKO General. Freddie Goodwin was selected as head coach for the team and quickly assembled a team that included players such as Barrie Wright and C\u00e9sar Luis Menotti. Pre-season training for the team was held at a high school soccer field in Florida. As part of an agreement with the New York Yankees, the Generals played their home games at Yankee Stadium.
