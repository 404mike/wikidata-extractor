Not until 1957 did Essex come back into the top half of the table, but Bailey and Barry Knight never had support of sufficient class to permit them to reach the top of the table, even when Robin Hobbs became England's last successful leg-spinner late in the 1960s."]}, {"page": "Ian Salisbury", "response": ["The cricket writer, Colin Bateman, commented, \"the selection of Ian Salisbury against Pakistan in 1992 made cricket romantics rejoice.
