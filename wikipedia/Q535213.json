During his directorship the Institute\u2014the largest archaeology department in the UK and one of the largest in the world\u2014was reorganised from a separate institution within the University of London to one affiliated with University College London, in 1986.\nEvans was educated at the Liverpool Institute from where he won an open scholarship to read English at Pembroke College, Cambridge, aged 17. His studies were interrupted by the outbreak of the Second World War, during which he served at Bletchley Park as one of the team involved in breaking each day's new Enigma code settings.\nDuring the 1940s and 1950s Evans excavated a number of the significant Megalithic sites in Malta.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Knossos", "response": ["John Davies Evans (no relation to Arthur Evans) undertook further excavations in pits and trenches over the palace, focusing on the Neolithic.

They lived in wattle and daub huts, kept animals, grew crops, and, in the event of tragedy, buried their children under the floor. In such circumstances as they are still seen today, a hamlet consisted of several families, necessarily interrelated, practicing some form of exogamy, living in close quarters, with little or no privacy and a high degree of intimacy, spending most of their time in the outdoors, sheltering only for the night or in inclement weather, and to a large degree nomadic or semi-nomadic."]}, {"page": "John Evans", "response": ["* John Davies Evans (1925\u20132011), English archaeologist"]}, {"page": "UCL Institute of Archaeology", "response": ["Mortimer Wheeler formally resigned as Honorary Director in 1944 when he became Director-General of the Archaeological Survey of India and, at the end of the Second World War, the Directorship was awarded to V.
