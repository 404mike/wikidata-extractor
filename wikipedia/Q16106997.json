Although John and Edwards later became the scourge of New Zealand, their first international pairing had an inauspicious start. On 11 November 1967, the pair played their first international together, facing Brian Lochore's touring New Zealand team. Edwards, like John, had two international games to his name, paired with Watkins in the final two matches of the 1967 Five Nations Championship. John regained his international place after Watkins had switched to professional rugby league just the month before, joining Salford for a club record fee of \u00a316,000. Wales had an error-strewn game, in a match played in a cutting, rain-laden wind which turned the pitch into a muddy field.Billot (1972) p. 196 Wales captain Norman Gale won the toss and chose to play the first half into the gale, and finished the half 8\u20130 down. John raised Welsh hopes with an early dropped goal, his first international points, but a panicked blind back pass from Wales' number\u00a08, John Jeffery, gifted Bill Davies an easy try.Billot (1972) p. 197 The game ended 13\u20136 to New Zealand, with Edwards looking uncomfortable throughout, and John's kicking inaccurate, there was little to suggest the pair would become one of the great half-back pairings in rugby history."]}, {"page": "David Campese", "response": ["In 1985 Campese won his second Hong Kong Sevens tournament \u2013 Australia's third tournament victory overall \u2013 in a 24\u201310 victory over Public School Wanderers. The Australia rugby sevens team contained: Roger Gould (QLD, captain/coach), David Campese (ACT), Phillip Cox (NSW), Glen Ella (NSW), Bruce Frame (NSW), Peter Lucas (NSW), Michael Lynagh (QLD), Simon Poidevin (NSW), Steve Tuynman (NSW). Alan Jones (Manager). Australia defeated Sri Lanka, Tonga and Ireland Wolfhounds on day one, before beating Western Samoa in the semi-final. The starting Australia national rugby sevens team for the final against Public School Wanderers consisted of: 1. Roger Gould; 2. Simon Poidevin; 3. Peter Lucas; 5. Michael Lynagh; 6. Bruce Frame; 7. David Campese; 9. Glen Ella. The Public School Wanderers from Scotland included: 1. Eric Paxton; 2. Gary Callander; 4. Bob Hogarth; 5. John Rutherford; 6. Peter Steven; 7. John Jeffery; 7. Roger Baird.", "In the second half, Public School Wanderers' Peter Steven made a line-break but threw the ball backwards to Glen Ella who intercepted the ball for Australia. Ella handed the ball to Campese, running at pace, who ran around John Jeffery to score a try behind the posts - his eighth try of the tournament, making him the leading try-scorer at the 1985 Hong Kong Sevens. Michael Lynagh converted the try to give Australia a 18\u20136 lead. Lynagh scored Australia's final try, which started with Glen Ella hurling a pass in-field to Simon Poidevin who caught a low-landing ball. Poidevin likewise threw a low pass to Roger Gould. Poidevin doubled-around Gould, who feigned a pass-attempt before moving the ball inside to Bruce Frame. Frame kicked the ball forward and Michael Lynagh caught it on the full before running more than half the length of the field to score a try under the posts, which he converted to give Australia a 24\u20136 lead. John Jeffery scored the last try of the final in the concluding play of the game, picking up the ball and placing it over the Australian try-line after Peter Steven was tackled less than a metre from it. The try was unconverted and Australia won the final 24\u201310."]}, {"page": "Oakdale, Caerphilly", "response": ["*Former pupils of Rhiw-Syr-Dafydd Infants school include Dame Patricia Morgan-Webb,Dame Patricia Morgan-Webb Opera star Dame Margaret Price, Former Wales rugby international John Jeffery, musician Glyn Hale, and Air Commodore David Davies."]}, {"page": "Cardiff Metropolitan University RFC", "response": ["*  John Jeffery"]}, {"page": "1967 New Zealand rugby union tour of Britain, France and Canada", "response": ["Wales: 15.
