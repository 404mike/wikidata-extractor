In 1893, Nagaoka traveled to Europe, where he continued his education at the universities of Berlin, Munich, and Vienna, including courses on Saturn's rings and a course with Ludwig Boltzmann on his Kinetic Theory of Gases, two influences which would be reflected in Nagaoka's later work. Nagaoka also attended, in 1900, the First International Congress of Physicists in Paris, where he heard Marie Curie lecture on radioactivity, an event that aroused Nagaoka's interest in atomic physics. Nagaoka returned to Japan in 1901 and served as professor of physics at Tokyo University until 1925.

Whittaker began holding \"research lectures\" in mathematics at the University, typically given twice a week. He was said to be a great lecturer by one of his previous attendees, who stated that his \"clear diction, his felicity of language and his enthusiasm could not fail to evoke a response\" and that he was very good with illustrations. Freeman Dyson commented on Whittaker's lecture style by saying that students were \"warmed, not only by the physical presence of a big crowd packed together, but by the mental vigour and enthusiasm of the old man\". Whittaker's efforts helped transform the Edinburgh Mathematical Society from a teachers society to an academic research society and was a major driving force in introducing computational mathematics education to the UK and America."]}, {"page": "Order of the Rising Sun", "response": ["* Knott, Cargill G.
