He struggled with injuries at the start of the 1986\u201387 campaign, but recovered to ensure his name went down in the club's history for his exploits in the FA Cup. He bagged five goals in their 1986\u201387 cup-winning run, the first being the winning goal away at Old Trafford against Alex Ferguson's Manchester United. He then scored two against Sheffield Wednesday in the quarter-finals, and one against Leeds United in the semi-finals, both games being held at Hillsborough. The final and most famous goal of the run came in the 1987 FA Cup Final in front of 98,000 spectators at Wembley Stadium in a 3\u20132 win over Tottenham Hotspur. However Houchen almost missed the match after catching food poisoning from a trout caught by reserve goalkeeper Jake Findlay. The goal came from a Dave Bennett cross and was an instinctive full-stretch diving header that was impossible for Ray Clemence to save. It levelled the score at 2\u20132 on 63 minutes, and an own goal from Gary Mabbutt in extra time won the game for Coventry. As well as his FA Cup winning medal, Houchen's header also earned him the BBC Match of the Day's Goal of the Season award for the 1986\u201387 season. This was due to the acrobatic effort involved and partly due to the incredible run he had made from deep midfield to meet the crossed ball.

Within two minutes of the kick-off, Tottenham took the lead.  Chris Waddle played in a cross from the right wing and Clive Allen beat defender Trevor Peake to the ball to head it past Steve Ogrizovic in the Coventry goal.  The scores were level seven minutes later: a deep cross from Greg Downs was headed on by Keith Houchen to Dave Bennett who rounded Ray Clemence and struck the ball past Steve Hodge into the corner of the Tottenham goal.  Coventry's Cyrille Regis had a goal disallowed and then, five minutes before half-time, Tottenham restored their one-goal lead.  A free kick from Waddle was touched on by Gary Mabbutt and bounced into the far corner of the Coventry goal.  Midway through the second half, Coventry were level once again, with Houchen converting a Bennett cross with a diving header, which would later be selected as the BBC Goal of the Season.  With the game even at full time, extra time was needed to decide the match. The only goal of extra time was scored in its first period when a cross from Lloyd McGrath looped off Mabbutt's left knee and over Clemence for an own goal, making the final score 3\u20132 to Coventry.", "In the two league matches between Coventry and Tottenham during the season, each side won their home games. The fixture at White Hart Lane in November 1986 was won 1\u20130 by Tottenham, with Allen scoring the only goal. The return match at Coventry's Highfield Road was held one month later, shortly after Christmas.  In a match described by Coventry City historian Jim Brown as an \"epic encounter\", Tottenham led 2\u20131 at half-time but Dave Bennett turned the game around after the interval with two goals in four minutes. Tottenham thought they had salvaged a point with a Nico Claesen equaliser two minutes before the end but Cyrille Regis scored in injury time to secure a 4\u20133 win for Coventry. Tottenham finished the league campaign in third place, while Coventry ended in tenth position. The 1987 final was Tottenham Hotspur's third FA Cup final in seven years and eighth overall, their most recent appearance being the 1982 FA Cup Final where they beat Queens Park Rangers 1\u20130 in a replay after drawing the original final 1\u20131.

Morgan made several signings, including brothers Gary and Dave Bennett and steered the club to ninth place before he was relieved of his role and moved into an administrative position. Dwyer described the move as \"one of the most baffling decisions I ever came across\". The club endured a disastrous run of form under Morgan's replacement, Graham Williams, failing to win a game for more than three months between December 1981 and March 1982. Williams and Morgan were both sacked in March with the club in the relegation zone and were replaced by Len Ashurst. In his first game as a manager, Cardiff won 5\u20134 over Cambridge United. Dwyer played his last game of the season on 27 February in a 2\u20130 defeat to Sheffield Wednesday before succumbing to a knee injury, caused by arthritis brought on by an operation on his cartilage earlier in his career, that ended his campaign. He finished the season having made 28 appearances in all competitions, the lowest tally of his career. In his absence, Cardiff were relegated to the Third Division after losing 3\u20132 to Luton Town in the final match of the season.

Mark Hateley, Danny Thomas and Gary Gillespie were among the high-profile names to leave. The new manager was Bobby Gould, who summed up the bleak situation at the club by saying \"I have been thrown into the lions' den\". A native of Coventry as well as a former player, Gould was very knowledgeable about the league's lower divisions, from which he began rebuilding the team by recruiting inexpensive players. The new recruits included members of the future cup-winning side, Dave Bennett, Michael Gynn and Trevor Peake, as well as Micky Adams, Sam Allardyce and Stuart Pearce, the last of whom joined from non-league Wealdstone a few months into the season. Brian \"Harry\" Roberts, one of the few players from the previous season to remain with the club, became captain. The inexperience of the side and the poor finances at the club, which were made worse by the withdrawal of Talbot's sponsorship deal, meant that once more the bookmakers had Coventry amongst the favourites for relegation. Despite supporter and pundit expectations, Coventry performed quite well in the first half of 1983\u201384, rising to fourth in the table by December through a run which included a 4\u20130 win over champions Liverpool. But once again their form deserted them after the new year, and after a run even worse than the previous season's were saved only through a last-day win against Norwich, Birmingham being relegated instead as they failed to beat Southampton.", "In 1986\u201387 Coventry won the only major trophy in their history as they beat Tottenham Hotspur at Wembley to win the FA Cup.

But this was followed up with a win over Arsenal and they didn't lose another game until 4 October. They remained in the top half of the table for the remainder of the year, with Cyrille Regis and Dave Bennett showing improved from in attack and the defence conceding few goals. They scored a notable victory against top-of-the-table Nottingham Forest in November. and on 27 December they played a thrilling game against Tottenham which finished 4\u20133, Regis scoring the winner in the final minute. The FA Cup run began with a third-round tie against Third Division side Bolton Wanderers, managed at the time by future Coventry manager Phil Neal. City won 3\u20130 in frozen conditions, Greg Downs, Regis and Bennett the scorers. Coventry's fourth round match was against Manchester United at Old Trafford. Returning from the team's brief trip to Spain to escape the cold George Curtis told the press \"Our name is on the cup\", but United were the firm favourites. The game was once again played on a frozen pitch and Coventry won the game 1\u20130 through a Keith Houchen goal. Recently appointed United manager Alex Ferguson cited City's better play for his team's defeat, saying \"their players were prepared to risk life and limb \u2013 ours weren't\".", "Another away match followed in the fifth round on 21 February, this time Second Division at Stoke City, who had suffered only one defeat since November. The home side played better in the first half but Coventry withstood the pressure and once again took the game 1\u20130, Michael Gynn scoring on the rebound after David Phillips had failed to convert a Nick Pickering cross in the 72nd minute. The quarter-final was at Hillsborough against Sheffield Wednesday and scores were level after a first-half Regis goal was cancelled out by a 67th-minute equaliser by Gary Megson. But Coventry scored twice in the final stages to progress to their first ever semi-final, against Leeds United. The semi-final was also played at Hillsborough, this time as a neutral venue, and 27,000 Coventry supporters travelled to Sheffield for the game. Leeds were in the Second Division at the time and City started as favourites, but the Yorkshire side started better, forcing goalkeeper Steve Ogrizovic to make two early saves and taking the lead after fourteen minutes. Coventry played better after going behind, with Regis going close to scoring on three occasions, and eventually equalised after 69 minutes through a Gynn goal. Houchen's goal ten minutes later gave them a 2\u20131 lead but Leeds equalised with seven minutes remaining. Dave Bennett scored nine minutes into extra time and City held on for the win.

It is generally considered as one of finest finals of all time in terms of footballing technique, fair play and sheer excitement. This also finally made archaic the famous Monty Python 'World Forum' sketch, in which Coventry City's last FA Cup win is a trick question asked in a game show, as they hadn't won the Cup to that point. Coventry City's youth team also won the FA Youth Cup in 1987 (beating Charlton Athletic 2\u20131) to secure a remarkable 'double'. Aside from Coventry, only Arsenal, Liverpool and Everton have ever won both the FA Cup and FA Youth Cup in the same season.
