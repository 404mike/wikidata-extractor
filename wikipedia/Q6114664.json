Bury's run to the final was remarkable in that they were drawn away from home in every round but won through with victories over Burnley, Notts County, cup holders Sheffield United and Nottingham Forest. The semi-final against Forest was played at Stoke and ended 1\u20131 after Bury missed a penalty. A replay was held at Bramall Lane in Sheffield and Bury began disastrously by conceding two goals in the first two minutes. Charlie Sagar pulled one back after 55 minutes and then Jasper McLuckie equalised with only five minutes to go. Extra time was played and Sagar scored the winner after 110 minutes of play. The final at the old Crystal Palace ground was played in a heatwave and Bury, captained by Jack Pray, dominated from the start. The goals in a one-sided match were scored by McLuckie (2), Willie Wood and Jack Plant. The players were on a win bonus of \u00a310 each in the final, ten times more than their usual \u00a31 per match bonus."]}, {"page": "1900 FA Cup Final", "response": ["The final was played in a heat wave and watched by a crowd of 68,945. Bury, leading 3\u20130 at half-time, dominated the match to win 4\u20130 with goals by Jasper McLuckie (2), Willie Wood and Jack Plant. When the game ended, the FA Cup trophy was presented to Bury's captain Jack Pray by Lord James of Hereford. Winning the cup proved to be profitable for Bury as the club's debts of \u00a31,230 were converted into a credit balance of \u00a31,329. Bury won the cup again in 1903 but that was their last appearance in the match. Southampton reached the 1902 final but were defeated by Sheffield United; they eventually won the cup in 1976.", "The semi-finals were staged at neutral venues on Saturday, 24 March, and Bury were drawn to play Nottingham Forest, the only other First Division team left in the competition, at the Victoria Ground in Stoke-on-Trent. The Times report criticised both teams for a poor match in which \"hard kicking and rushing marked the play throughout\" and said that the 20,000 spectators gained no satisfaction from a game in which there was \"no short passing\". Team captain Jack Pray scored a fifteenth-minute penalty but the match ended in a 1\u20131 draw after a second penalty was missed and Arthur Capes scored for Forest. For the third time in this cup run, a replay was required, this time at Bramall Lane.", "|RH || Jack Pray (c)", "Bury's former club president, Lord James of Hereford, presented the trophy to captain Jack Pray at the end of the game. James made a speech recorded in both The Observer and The Times and began by saying it was a great honour to present the cup to the Bury team. Pray responded by asking his players to \"give three hearty cheers for (Southampton)\". Also present as a guest of honour was Lord Rosebery, the former prime minister, who made a speech in which he commiserated with Southampton goalkeeper Jack Robinson for \"a gallant uphill fight against overwhelming odds\"."]}, {"page": "1894\u201395 Rangers F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\" | Jack Pray"]}, {"page": "1899\u20131900 Southampton F.C. season", "response": ["In the second half, the Saints came back into the game with Alf Milward and Harry Wood having several attempts on goal, to no avail. With ten minutes to play, Robinson made another fine save from Jack Pray, which resulted in a corner. The corner was quickly taken by Billy Richards to Plant, who shot \"low and hard\" past Robinson to complete a \"football lesson\" for the Southampton players."]}]}}
