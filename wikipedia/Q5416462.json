He became a trade union organiser in 1928 and worked in that role until 1941 when he was elected unopposed as Member of Parliament (MP) for Doncaster, having unsuccessfully contested the seat of Rossendale in 1935 and having been prospective candidate for  West Toxteth in 1939. From 1944 to 1945, he was parliamentary private secretary to the Minister of National Insurance. Re-elected in the 1945 general election, he was appointed parliamentary private secretary to the Minister of Food, and served in this role until 1946. In 1947, in the course of an investigation by the parliamentary Committee of Privileges into claims that Labour members had given information to journalists about confidential meetings of the Labour Party in return for payment, Walkden admitted revealing information to the Evening News. He was found guilty of breach of privilege by the Committee and reprimanded by the Speaker. Another MP, Garry Allighan, was expelled from the House, but Walkden was not as he admitted the offence and had paid tax on the money he had been paid. He resigned the party whip and sat as an independent until the 1950 general election, in which he did not stand.\nLord Robens commented after his death that Walkden was \"an able Trade Union official and an able Parliamentarian and worked hard to bring about reforms in the rationing systems during the war. He was a thorn in the side of the black marketeers and his activities led to the closing of many loopholes.\"\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1945 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Evelyn Walkden"]}, {"page": "Doncaster (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Evelyn Walkden", "In the 1941 Doncaster by-election, Evelyn Walkden was elected unopposed."]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1931\u20131950)", "response": ["|Evelyn Walkden"]}, {"page": "Liverpool West Toxteth (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["*Labour: Evelyn WalkdenReport of the Annual Conference of the Labour Party, 1939 "]}, {"page": "Garry Allighan", "response": ["The other member, Evelyn Walkden, admitted the offence and since he had paid taxes on the money, was permitted to remain as an MP. Allighan was charged with \"aggravated contempt and gross breach of privilege\" and expelled from the House of Commons on 30 October 1947. In the debate, the Leader of the House, Herbert Morrison, proposed six months' suspension but it was argued that this would deprive his constituents of representation for too long a period. It was also observed that after expulsion he was free to seek re-election if he believed he had been treated unfairly and, if returned, could resume his seat. However, he chose not to do this and immediately resigned from the Labour Party. He appears to have been the only MP since Charles Bradlaugh in the 19th century to have been expelled from the Commons other than for a serious criminal offence or bankruptcy."]}, {"page": "List of elected British politicians who have changed party affiliation", "response": ["|Evelyn Walkden"]}, {"page": "Walkden (surname)", "response": ["*Evelyn Walkden (1893-1970), British politician and trade unionist"]}, {"page": "1941 Doncaster by-election", "response": ["The Doncaster by-election of 1941 was held on 6 February 1941.
