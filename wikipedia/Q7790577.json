He took a degree in natural sciences from Brasenose College, Oxford. He moved to London and became a pupil of Lucie Man\u00e9n, and also served as a Vicar Choral at St Paul's Cathedral. He made his debut in 1951 as Aeneas in Purcell's Dido and Aeneas at the Mermaid Theatre, London, alongside Kirsten Flagstad as Dido.  The pair recorded the opera for EMI the same year.  He debuted at Glyndebourne in 1953. He was principal baritone at the Aachen Opera from 1953 to 1956, the Deutsche Oper am Rhein from 1956 to 1963, and the Z\u00fcrich Opera from 1962 to 1967.In 1960, Hemsley created the role of Demetrius in Britten's A Midsummer Night's Dream with the English Opera Group at Aldeburgh.  His other work in contemporary opera included his Covent Garden debut in 1970 as Mangus in Tippett's The Knot Garden, Iain Hamilton's opera The Catiline Conspiracy in 1974 at Scottish Opera as Caesar, and the role of Rev Wringhim in Thomas Wilson's opera The Confessions of a Justified Sinner (1976).  In 1965, he was the baritone soloist in only the second UK performance (and only the fourth performance in the work's history) of Delius's Requiem, in Liverpool, under Charles Groves.\nHemsley was a notable interpreter of German music, such as Beckmesser in Wagner's Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg.  Otto Klemperer specifically recommended Hemsley to the Bayreuth Festival for the role, which Hemsley sang there 1968 to 1970 and recording it under the baton of Rafael Kubel\u00edk.  In the latter part of his career, he taught at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, London and also Dartington International Summer School.\nHemsley married Gwenlliam James in 1960, and the couple had 3 sons.  His widow and sons survive him.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 12", "response": ["*1927 \u2013 Thomas Hemsley, English baritone (d. 2013)"]}, {"page": "April 11", "response": ["*  2013   \u2013 Thomas Hemsley, English actor and singer (b. 1927)"]}, {"page": "War Requiem", "response": ["* Cascavelle: Heather Harper, Peter Pears, Thomas Hemsley; Orchestre de la Suisse Romande, Radio Suisse Romande Chorus, Choeur Pro Arte de Lausanne; Ernest Ansermet, conductor (1967)"]}, {"page": "Coalville", "response": ["* Thomas Hemsley (1927\u20132013), actor and opera singer, awarded CBE in 2000"]}, {"page": "Serse", "response": ["|Maureen Forrester,Lucia Popp,Maureen Lehane,Mildred Miller,Marilyn Tyler,Owen Brannigan,Thomas Hemsley"]}, {"page": "La clemenza di Tito", "response": ["|1956(in English)||Richard Lewis,Joan SutherlandMonica SinclairAnna PollakJennifer VyvyanThomas Hemsley || John PritchardLondon Mozart Players, BBC Chorus || CD: NimbusCat: NI7967"]}, {"page": "Dido and Aeneas", "response": ["The first complete recording of the opera was made by Decca Records in 1935 with Nancy Evans as Dido and Roy Henderson as Aeneas,Darrell (1936) p. 371 followed in 1945 by HMV's release with Joan Hammond and Dennis Noble.

It seems that Delius did some of the early work himself, but his German Jewish friend Heinrich Simon contributed substantially in putting it together; so substantially, in fact, that he considered himself its true author and felt entitled to a royalty payment. Simon was the owner and editor of the Frankfurter Zeitung, and also a political economist, writer and translator, art historian, musicologist and practising musician.  How he and Delius became acquainted is not recorded. The text does not literally quote any specific author, but is derived in spirit from the writings of Friedrich Nietzsche and Arthur Schopenhauer, while also redolent of William Shakespeare, the Bible, and the text of Gustav Mahler's Das Lied von der Erde.  At one point, \"Hallelujahs\" are mingled with Arabic invocations to Allah. The published score makes no mention of the author, and Heinrich Simon's involvement only became generally acknowledged in the 1970s.  Thomas Hemsley, the baritone soloist in the 1965 Liverpool performance, described the words as \"a bit embarrassing, seeming to be rather a poor, second-hand imitation of Nietzsche\".", "Fifteen more years elapsed before the next performance \u2013 only the second in the United Kingdom \u2013 on 9 November 1965, by the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra under Charles Groves,* Cambridge Journals  with Heather Harper and Thomas Hemsley as the soloists."]}, {"page": "Ernest Lush", "response": ["The roll of artists he accompanied includes: Janet Baker, Owen Brannigan, Alfredo Campoli, Suzanne Danco, Jacqueline du Pr\u00e9 (her very first recital), Kathleen Ferrier (her last broadcast recital), Pierre Fournier, Thomas Hemsley, Nathan Milstein, Ossy Renardy, Ruggiero Ricci, Peter Schidlof, Paul Sch\u00f6ffler, Elisabeth Schumann, Igor Stravinsky, Joan Sutherland, Inia Te Wiata, Jennifer Vyvyan and  Ljuba Welitsch."]}, {"page": "Alfred Orda", "response": ["In 1948 he attended auditions at the Metropolitan Opera House but was immediately recruited by Georges Hirsch, the Director of the Paris Opera (who was in New York the time) to appear as Valentin in 'Faust'.
