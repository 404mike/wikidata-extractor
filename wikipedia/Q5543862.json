In England his collaboration with Thomas Chippendale resulted in some of the finest neoclassicist designs of the time, most notably in the Harewood House collection of Chippendale's work. In North America, the Federal style owes much to neoclassicism as practised by Adam. In Europe, Adam notably influenced Charles Cameron, the Scotsman who designed Tsarskoye Selo and other Russian palaces for Catherine the Great.Glendinning & McKechnie, p. 108 However, by the time of his death, Adam's neoclassicism was being superseded in Britain by a more severe, Greek phase of the classical revival, as practised by James \"Athenian\" Stuart. The Adam brothers employed several draughtsmen who would go on to establish themselves as architects, including George Richardson, and the Italian Joseph Bonomi, who Robert originally hired in Rome."]}, {"page": "George Richardson", "response": ["George Richardson may refer to:", "* George Richardson (footballer, born 1891) (1891\u2013?), English football outside right who played for Huddersfield Town and others", "* George Richardson (footballer, born 1899) (1899\u20131963), Scottish football wing half who played for Lincoln City, Sheffield United and Boscombe", "* George Richardson (footballer, born 1901) (1901\u2013?), English football left half or forward who played for Hartlepools United and Newport County", "* George Richardson (footballer, born 1912) (1912\u20131968), English football inside forward who played for Sheffield United, Hull City, and Bangor City", "* George Richardson (ice hockey) (1886\u20131916), NHL hockey player", "* George Richardson (baseball), Negro league baseball player, 1901\u20131903", "* George Richardson (cricketer) (1834\u20131911), Australian cricketer", "* Sir George Richardson (Indian Army officer) (1847\u20131931), British military officer and commander of the Ulster Volunteers", "* George Richardson (VC) (1831\u20131923), Irish Victoria Cross winner", "* George Richardson (Canadian politician) (1916\u20132000), Canadian politician", "* George Richardson (New Zealand politician) (1837\u20131909), New Zealand politician", "* George Richardson (architect) (1737/8\u2013c. 1813), Scottish architect and writer"]}, {"page": "John Carr (architect)", "response": ["Carr's work was influenced by the books of Sebastiano Serlio and Andrea Palladio.
