Having failed to win a contract with Rovers he also had a brief trial at Stevenage. His father then organised him a trial with Football Conference side Yeovil Town after talking to assistant Steve Thompson and reserve team manager Maurice O'Donnell, Way featured in a reserve team friendly 9\u20131 victory against Minehead in early August 2000. On 18 August 2000, Yeovil manager David Webb signed Way on a two-year contract, linking up with former Norwich youth teammate Barrington Belgrave. With manager Webb describing Way as \"a talented midfield schemer\". Way made his Yeovil debut the following day, on 19 August 2000, in a 2\u20130 victory over Kettering Town as a substitute for captain Terry Skiverton. Way scored his first goal for Yeovil with a penalty kick against Nuneaton Borough in a 2\u20130 victory, on 2 September 2000. Way immediately became a fans favourite at Yeovil earning the moniker \"Weasel\" to describe his hard working attitude. Way was part of the Yeovil side who progressed to the third round of the FA Cup, defeating Football League sides Colchester United 5\u20131 at home with Way scoring a penalty, and Blackpool 1\u20130 away with Way providing the assist for Nick Crittenden's winning goal. In the third round Yeovil travelled to Premier League side Bolton Wanderers and took the lead before succumbing to an injury time defeat. Way ended his first season with the club having made 51 appearances in all competitions, scoring twelve times, as Yeovil narrowly missed out on the Conference title. His performances in the Yeovil midfield led to his inclusion, alongside teammates Terry Skiverton and Nick Crittenden, in the 2000\u201301 Conference team of the year."]}, {"page": "List of Chelsea F.C. players", "response": ["|  Nick Crittenden"]}, {"page": "Chelsea F.C.
