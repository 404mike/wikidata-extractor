Despite this style, the album still provided more polished moments such as lead single \"Stolen Car\", the jazz-and-strings-tinged \"Sweetest Decline\", and the electro melancholy of \"Stars All Seem to Weep\" (with the haunting vocal allegedly recorded in a single take).

Due to Thorn's preoccupation with motherhood, her level of involvement in the creation of the album was scaled back, with Watt taking on a more prominent role in writing lyrics and music. Thorn recorded most of her vocals during late-night studio sessions, after the twins had gone to sleep. In her autobiography Bedsit Disco Queen (2013), she remarked that \"in a sense, [she] ended up being guest vocalist on someone else's album\".", "According to AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Temperamental was a continuation of the musical direction pursued by Everything but the Girl on their previous album Walking Wounded (1996), merging electronica with elements of folk, jazz and pop. He described the musical style of Temperamental as a minor refinement of that of Walking Wounded, eschewing its drum and bass and trip hop influences in favour of a more house-driven sound. Salon writer Amanda Nowinski wrote that Temperamental retained drum and bass breakbeats but was mostly informed by \"old-school\" garage house, while NME characterised the album as \"a left-turn into deep house ambience and trip-hop grooves\" that is \"punctuated by vulnerable lyrics and vocal performances\" from Tracey Thorn. Michael White of The Quietus viewed it as \"an aesthetic continuation of [Walking Wounded], synthesizing the most recent developments of clubland with the duo's intrinsic song-based approach\". Ben Watt incorporated production techniques that he had learned from his three years as a resident DJ at Bar Rumba and Notting Hill Arts Club into the album's songs, including cross-fading, back spinning, and filtering.
