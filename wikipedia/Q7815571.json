Another negotiator, Argyll was given an English peerage. Robert Burns is commonly quoted in support of the argument of corruption: \"We're bought and sold for English Gold, Such a Parcel of Rogues in a Nation.\" As historian Christopher Whatley points out, this was actually a 17th-century Scots folk song; but he agrees money was paid, though suggests the economic benefits were supported by most Scots MPs, with the promises made for benefits to peers and MPs, even if it was reluctantly. Professor Sir Tom Devine agreed that promises of \"favours, sinecures, pensions, offices and straightforward cash bribes became indispensable to secure government majorities\".

Professor Brian Young, a historian at the University of Oxford, notes that in 1792, the motion for immediate cessation of the slave trade was heading for certain defeat.

Others argue that it was purely economic and social factors which led to the population decline in rural Scotland. The historiographer royal in Scotland, Gordon Donaldson, was particularly cutting in his criticism and declared Prebble's books to be \"utter rubbish\".
