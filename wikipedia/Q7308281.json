This was ostensibly an economy measure although Gibbons, in later life, suspected other reasons, particularly the increasing distraction from work that arose from her relationship with  Walter Beck. The engagement had ended painfully in 1928, primarily because Gibbons was looking for a fully committed relationship whereas he wanted something  more open. Her biographer and nephew, Reggie Oliver, believes Gibbons never entirely got over Beck, even after 1929 when she met Allan Webb, her future husband.Oliver, pp. 68 and 77 She was not unemployed for long; she quickly accepted a job offer as an editorial assistant at the women's magazine, The Lady. Here, according to The Observer writer Rachel Cooke, \"she applied her versatility as a writer to every subject under the sun bar cookery, which was the province of a certain Mrs Peel.\" At the same time she began work on the novel that would become Cold Comfort Farm; her colleague and friend Elizabeth Coxhead recorded that Gibbons \"neglected her duties disgracefully\" to work on this project.Coxhead in a 1975 letter, reported in Oliver, p. 91", "From the mid-1980s Gibbons experienced recurrent health problems, not helped when she resumed smoking. In her last months she was looked after at home by her grandson and his girlfriend. She died there on 19 December 1989, after collapsing the previous day, and was buried in Highgate Cemetery, alongside her husband. At her funeral, her nephew and future biographer Reggie Oliver read two of her poems, the latter of which, \"Fairford Church\", concludes with the words: \"Little is sure. Life is hard./We love, we suffer and die./But the beauty of the earth is real/And the Spirit is nigh.\"OlIver, pp. 255\u201359"]}, {"page": "Jacksonville Sharks (WFL)", "response": ["The Sharks were one of the original franchises of the World Football League, a failed attempt to launch a major professional football league in the United States in competition with the National Football League.
