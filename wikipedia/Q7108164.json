In 1868, following the German annexation of Schleswig-Holstein, the family settled in Britain, where Oswald's work had been recommended by Freiherrin Rebecca von Kreusser to Ralph Nicholson Wornum, who was Keeper of the National Gallery at the time. The family obtained British nationality.  The young Sickert was sent to University College School from 1870 to 1871, before transferring to King's College School, where he studied until the age of 18. Though he was the son and grandson of painters, he first sought a career as an actor; he appeared in small parts in Sir Henry Irving's company, before taking up the study of art in 1881. After less than a year's attendance at the Slade School, Sickert left to become a pupil of and etching assistant to James Abbott McNeill Whistler.Baron et al. 1992, p. 34. Sickert's earliest paintings were small tonal studies painted alla prima from nature after Whistler's example."]}, {"page": "Helena Swanwick", "response": ["Born in Munich, Swanwick was the only daughter of Eleanor Louisa Henry and the painter Oswald Sickert (technically Danish, although he spoke no Danish and considered himself German).
