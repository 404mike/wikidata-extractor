After completing his degrees, Russell's prize money allowed him to keep studying and began working towards the honours school in English literature under Macneile Dixon, but in 1908 Glasgow's professor of logic, Robert Latta, encouraged him to study in the University of Cambridge as preparation for an academic career at Glasgow. He then went to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and completed an advanced course on logic delivered by W. E. Johnson; he attended these with John Laird and C. D.
