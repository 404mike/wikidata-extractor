This game was selected as one of the Football League's \"anniversary fixtures\" to mark the 125th anniversary of the first Football League season. With Harry Worley scoring the historic first League goal, a brace from Chris Zebroski and a goal from Christian Jolley 10 minutes into the second half, County won 4\u20131 and were top of the League Two table. In the next game away to Northampton, Conor Washington scored his first League goal but the club suffered a 3\u20131 loss. The next home game, the Severnside derby with Bristol Rovers saw County's highest gate of the season; Andy Sandell's first-half penalty being enough to take all three points. The next three games were all drawn 1\u20131 with County slipping out of the play-off places as a result. The next home game, against Morecambe, will forever be remembered as the \"Tom Naylor game\": Scoring within three minutes, Billy Jones had made the perfect start to his d\u00e9but game before Naylor scored an own goal to level the match. Robbie Willmott restored Newport's lead before Naylor's second own goal again levelled things. With 20 minutes remaining Naylor conceded a penalty which allowed Morecambe to take the lead and eventually win the game. County's first away win of the season in the next game at Exeter, followed by a home win to Torquay United took County back to the brink of the play-off positions, but following the next two games they were back down to 12th. County then embarked on a successful spell, losing only once at Fleetwood until visiting Burton Albion in the last game of 2013. That last game was lost 1\u20130, but County finished the year in a play-off position.", "|16||DF||align=\"left\"| Billy Jones||6 (1)||1||1 (0)||0||0 (0)||0||0 (0)||0||7 (1)||1", "|12 September 2013||DF|| Billy Jones||Unattached||Free", "|10 January 2014||DF|| Billy Jones||Released||"]}, {"page": "Billy Jones (footballer born 1983)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Billy Jones (footballer, born 1983)"]}]}}
