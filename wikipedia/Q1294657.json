The Pup began operations on the carriers in early 1917; the first aircraft were fitted with skid undercarriages in place of the standard landing gear. Landings utilised a system of deck wires to \"trap\" the aircraft. Later versions reverted to the normal undercarriage. Pups were used as ship-based fighters on three carriers: , Furious and . A number of other Pups were deployed to cruisers and battleships where they were launched from platforms attached to gun turrets.
