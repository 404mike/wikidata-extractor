The journal of the British Society for Phenomenology regularly publishes work on existential and phenomenological psychotherapy. The Society for Existential Analysis was founded in 1988, initiated by van Deurzen. This society brings together psychotherapists, psychologists, psychiatrists, counselors, and philosophers working from an existential perspective. It offers regular fora for discussion and debate as well as significant annual conferences. It publishes the Journal of the Society for Existential Analysis twice a year. It is also a member of the International Federation of Daseinsanalysis, which stimulates international exchange between representatives of the approach from around the world. An International Society for Existential Therapists also exists. It was founded in 2006 by Emmy van Deurzen and Digby Tantam and is called the International Community of Existential Counsellors and Therapists (ICECAP)."]}, {"page": "United Kingdom Council for Psychotherapy", "response": ["| 1995\u20131998 || Digby Tantam"]}, {"page": "DigbyTantam", "response": ["#REDIRECT Digby Tantam"]}, {"page": "Digby tantam", "response": ["#REDIRECT Digby Tantam "]}, {"page": "Rokeby Preparatory School", "response": ["*Prof. Digby Tantam, British psychiatrist and professor of psychotherapy"]}, {"page": "Autism Cymru", "response": ["Autism Cymru had held the Wales Autism International Conference in Cardiff 2004;\"Autism is 'positive' for Welsh painter\" WalesOnline.co.uk Retrieved 15 September 2012. speakers have included Dr Tony Attwood, Professor Christopher Gillberg, Professor Rita Jordan, Dr Temple Grandin, Dr Lorna Wing and Professor Digby Tantam.Autism Cymru ASDinfoWales.co.uk Retrieved 15 September 2012.
