At the macro level, political scientists report that xenophobia, anti-immigrant feeling, and resentment towards out-groups tend to be higher during difficult economic times. Economic crises have been associated with gains by right-wing political parties.

A study published in the British Medical Journal in 2015 found that each one percentage point increase in the rate of Jobseeker's Allowance claimants sanctioned was associated with a 0.09 percentage point rise in food bank use.

He provides two examples of widely divergent IMF estimates of the average structural fiscal balance of Ireland and Spain, for the period 2000\u20132007.

The sum of the surpluses or deficits across these three sectors must be zero by definition. For example, if there is a foreign financial surplus (or capital surplus) because capital is imported (net) to fund the trade deficit, and there is also a private sector financial surplus due to household saving exceeding business investment, then by definition, there must exist a government budget deficit so all three net to zero. The government sector includes federal, state and local governments. For example, the U.S. government budget deficit in 2011 was approximately 10% GDP (8.6% GDP of which was federal), offsetting a capital surplus of 4% GDP and a private sector surplus of 6% GDP.Financial Times-Martin Wolf-The Balance Sheet Recession in the U.S. \u2013 July 2012", "Financial journalist Martin Wolf argued that sudden shifts in the private sector from deficit to surplus forced the government balance into deficit, and cited as example the U.S.: \"The financial balance of the private sector shifted towards surplus by the almost unbelievable cumulative total of 11.2 per cent of gross domestic product between the third quarter of 2007 and the second quarter of 2009, which was when the financial deficit of US government (federal and state) reached its peak...No fiscal policy changes explain the collapse into massive fiscal deficit between 2007 and 2009, because there was none of any importance. The collapse is explained by the massive shift of the private sector from financial deficit into surplus or, in other words, from boom to bust.\""]}, {"page": "Paul Krugman", "response": ["Martin Wolf has written that Krugman is both the \"most hated and most admired columnist in the US\"."]}, {"page": "Balance of payments", "response": ["According to economics writer Martin Wolf, in the eight years leading up to 2007, \"three-quarters of the foreign currency reserves accumulated since the beginning of time have been piled up\".", "By September 2010, international tensions relating to imbalances had further increased.

Brazil has been one of the few major economies lacking a reserve currency to abstain from significant currency intervention, with the real rising by 25% against the dollar since January 2009. Some economists such as Barry Eichengreen have argued that competitive devaluation may be a good thing as the net result will effectively be equivalent to expansionary global monetary policy.

Laurence Kotlikoff and Edward Leamer agree, in a paper entitled \"A Banking System We Can Trust\", arguing that the current financial system did not produce the benefits that have been attributed to it.  Rather than simply borrowing money from savers to make loans towards investment and production, and holding \"money\" as a stable liability, banks in reality create credit increasingly for the purpose of acquiring existing assets. Rather than financing real productivity and investment, and generating fair asset prices, Wall Street has come to resemble a casino, in which trade volume of securities skyrockets without having positive impacts on the investment rate or economic growth. The credits and debt banks create play a role in determining how delicate the economy is in the face of crisis. For example, Wall Street caused the housing bubble by financing millions of mortgages that were outside budget constraints, which in turn decreased output by 10 percent.", "The financial crisis of 2007\u20132008 led to renewed interest in full reserve banking and sovereign money issued by a central bank.

Samuelson's factor price equalisation theorem  indicates that, if productivity were the same in both countries, the effect of trade would be to bring about equality in wage rates. As noted above, that theorem is sometimes taken to mean that trade between an industrialised country and a developing country would lower the wages of the unskilled in the industrialised country. However, it is unreasonable to assume that productivity  would be the same in a low-wage  developing country  as in a high-wage developed country.  A 1999  study has found international  differences in wage rates to be approximately matched by corresponding differences in productivity.Stephen Golub  Labor Costs and International Trade  American Enterprise Institute: 1999 (Such discrepancies that remained were probably the result of over-valuation or under-valuation of exchange rates, or of inflexibilities in labour markets.)  It has been argued that, although there may sometimes be short-term pressures on wage rates in the developed countries, competition between employers in  developing countries can be expected eventually to  bring wages into line with their employees' marginal products.  Any remaining international  wage differences would then be the result of productivity differences, so that there would be no difference between  unit labour costs in developing and developed countries, and no downward pressure on wages in the developed countries.Martin Wolf Why Globalization Works pages 176 to 180 Yale Nota Bene 2005", "Globalisation is seen as contributing to economic welfare by most economists \u2013 but not all.
