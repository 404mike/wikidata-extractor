Humphrey was right-handed batsman who fielded as a wicket-keeper.  He was born in Hampstead, London.\nHumphrey made his first-class debut for Surrey against Cambridge University in 1964.  In this match he scored his only first-class half century, making 58 runs in the Surrey first-innings before being dismissed by Angus McLachlan.

In these two first-class matches he scored 63 runs at a batting average of 63.00.  His average was so high due to one of his two batting innings being not out.He later made his debut for Buckinghamshire in the 1980 Minor Counties Championship against Hertfordshire.  He played Minor counties cricket for Buckinghamshire from 1980 to 1985, which included 36 Minor Counties Championship matches and 6 MCCA Knockout Trophy matches.
