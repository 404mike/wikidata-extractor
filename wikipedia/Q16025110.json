The cricket website CricInfo states that he died on 6 November 1936 but does not give a place of death, whilst CricketArchive indicates he died on 11 August 1958 at Hastings in East Sussex. A third source, the UK probate register, states that he died at St Helens Hospital, Hastings, on 1 December 1958.Birch made two appearances for the Kent Second XI in 1893 and his only first-class cricket appearance the following year for the team against MCC at Lord's scoring three runs.
