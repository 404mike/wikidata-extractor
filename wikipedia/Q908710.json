Aware of the complex semantic  issues involved in converging different areas of chemistry to address modern multidisciplinary problems,  he started investigating the use of the Internet as an information and integrating medium around  1987, focusing in 1994 on the World Wide Web as having the most potential. Peter Murray-Rust and he first introduced Chemical Markup Language (CML) in 1995 as a rich  carrier of semantic chemical information and data; and they coined the  term Datument as a portmanteau word  to better express the evolution from the  documents produced by traditional academic publishing methods  to the Semantic Web ideals expressed by Tim Berners-Lee.ACS Publications News, Imperial College London, Science & Engineering South"]}]}}
