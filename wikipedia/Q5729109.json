The idea for the Bengal Club was conceived of in a meeting of notable Englishmen at the Town Hall of Calcutta in 1826, led by Lieutenant-Colonel (later Lieutenant-General) John Finch, son of the 4th Earl of Aylesford. Finch explained at the meeting that \"nothing like a respectable hotel or coffeehouse has ever existed\" in Calcutta, and \"those who constitute the society of Calcutta have no place where they can spend an idle half hour agreeably\" The Club was formally established on 8 February 1827, with the Viscount Combermere  its first patron. In 1830, Lord William Bentinck, the last Governor of Bengal and the first Governor-General of India, became the second patron of the club. The club's original members included influential figures like Charles Metcalfe, Henry Thoby Prinsep and Sir Edward Ryan, along with senior military officials. In 1838, the club passed a resolution to reciprocate with the now-extinct Byculla Club of Mumbai (then Bombay). Later, reciprocal relations were established with the Madras Club, the Hong Kong Club and the now-defunct Shanghai Club. By the 1870s, the club was being described in travelogues as \"the most swell establishment of the kind in the East\" (by American Civil War general Robert Ogden Tyler) and \"an institution known to all the dwellers of the East\" (by scholar and historian Sir George William Forrest). By the close of the century, the Bengal Club became one of a handful of buildings in British India to be supplied with electricity."]}, {"page": "Julia Stephen", "response": ["The Pattle sisters and their families (see Pattle family tree) provided important connections for Julia and her mother. As Quentin Bell, Julia's grandson, described it, they had \"a certain awareness of social possibilities\". Sarah Monckton Pattle (1816-1887), had married Henry Thoby Prinsep (1792\u20131878), an administrator with the East India Company, and their home at Little Holland House was an important intellectual centre and influence on Julia, that she would later describe to her children as \"bohemian\". Little Holland House, a farmhouse on the Holland estate, that served as the dower house, was then on the outskirts of London, and nicknamed the \"Enchanted Palace\", where Sarah Prinsep ran the equivalent of a French salon. Quentin Bell states that Julia was \"largely brought up in\" Little Holland House. The house was also frequented by Leslie Stephen. One of the Prinsep's sons, another of Julia's many cousins, was the artist, Valentine Cameron Prinsep (1838\u20131904). Another of Maria Jackson's sisters was Virginia Pattle (1827\u20131910), who married (1850) Lord Charles Eastnor, later the third Earl Somers (1819\u20131883). Their eldest daughter (Julia's cousin) was Lady Isabella Caroline Somers-Cocks (1851\u20131921), the temperance leader, while the younger, Lady Adeline Marie (1852\u20131920) became the Duchess of Bedford. Julia and her mother were frequent guests at Eastnor Castle, the home of Lord Charles and Lady Virginia. Another maternal aunt, and also her godmother, Julia Margaret Pattle (Julia Margaret Cameron 1815\u20131879), was a celebrated photographer, who took many photographs of her niece, and created a photograph album for her sister, Maria in 1863 (the Mia Album)."]}]}}
