He is best known for a series of biographies of politicians, writers and followers of Sigmund Freud. He also wrote numerous novels, and was a dramatist.\nHe was born and brought up in London, and educated at Streatham Grammar School and Elleston School. He failed to enter university, and was found a job at a tea broker. He left home at 18 determined to write for a living. He took up residence in Bloomsbury, where he would live for the rest of his life.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of biographers", "response": ["*Vincent Brome (En, 1910\u20132004) \u2013 various writers"]}, {"page": "The Logic of Scientific Discovery", "response": ["The psychologist Harry Guntrip wrote that its publication \"greatly stimulated the discussion of the nature of scientific knowledge\", including by philosophers who did not completely agree with Popper, such as Thomas Kuhn and Horace Romano Harr\u00e9. The psychiatrist Carl Jung, founder of analytical psychology, valued the work. The biographer Vincent Brome recalls Jung remarking in 1938 that it exposed \"some of the shortcomings of science\". The philosopher Paul Ric\u0153ur endorsed \"procedures of invalidation\" similar to Popper's criteria for falsifiability. The historian Peter Gay described the work as \"an important treatise in epistemology\". The philosopher Bryan Magee considered Popper's criticisms of logical positivism \"devastating\". In his view, Popper's most important argument against logical positivism is that, while it claimed to be a scientific theory of the world, its central tenet, the verification principle, effectively destroyed all of science.Magee, Bryan. Confessions of a Philosopher. Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1997, p. 46. The physicists Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont argued that critiques of Popper's work have provoked an \"irrationalist drift\", and that a significant part of the problems that currently affect the philosophy of science \"can be traced to ambiguities or inadequacies\" in The Logic of Scientific Discovery.Sokal, Alan.
