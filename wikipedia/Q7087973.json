At the age of seven, Macfarren was sent to Dr. Nicholas's school in Ealing, where his father was dancing-master; the school numbered among its alumni John Henry, Cardinal Newman and Thomas Henry Huxley.Banister (1891), 10. His health was poor, however, and his eyesight weak, so much so that he was given a large-type edition of the Bible and had to use a powerful magnifying-glass for all other reading.Banister (1891), 13. He was withdrawn from the school in 1823 to undergo a course of eye treatment. The treatment was unsuccessful, and his eyesight progressively worsened until he became totally blind in 1860. However, his blindness had little effect on his productivity. He overcame the difficulties posed by his lack of sight by employing an amanuensis in composition. One amanuensis was composer Oliveria Prescott.Smither (2000), 350."]}, {"page": "Oliveria", "response": ["*Oliveria Prescott (1843\u20131919), English writer and composer"]}, {"page": "Oliveria Louisa Prescott", "response": ["#REDIRECT Oliveria Prescott"]}, {"page": "1919 in British music", "response": ["*date unknown \u2013 Oliveria Prescott, writer and composer, 75/76"]}]}}
