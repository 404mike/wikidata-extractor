H. Auden. Together they worked on the documentary films Coal Face and Night Mail in 1935. They also collaborated on the song cycle Our Hunting Fathers (1936), radical both in politics and musical treatment, and subsequently other works including Cabaret Songs, On This Island, Paul Bunyan and Hymn to St Cecilia. Auden was a considerable influence on Britten, encouraging him to widen his aesthetic, intellectual and political horizons, and also to come to terms with his homosexuality. Auden was, as David Matthews puts it, \"cheerfully and guiltlessly promiscuous\"; Britten, puritanical and conventional by nature, was sexually repressed.", "The Britten scholar Donald Mitchell has written, \"It is easy, because of the scope, stature, and sheer volume of the operas, and the wealth of vocal music of all kinds, to pay insufficient attention to the many works Britten wrote in other, specifically non-vocal genres.\" Maw said of Britten, \"He is one of the 20th century's great orchestral composers\u00a0... His orchestration has an individuality, incisiveness and integration with the musical material only achieved by the greatest composers.\" Among Britten's best-known orchestral works are the Variations on a Theme of Frank Bridge (1937), the Sinfonia da Requiem (1940), the Four Sea Interludes (1945) and The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra (1945). The Variations, an affectionate tribute to Britten's teacher, range from comic parodies of Italian operatic clich\u00e9s and Viennese waltzes to a strutting march, reflecting the rise of militarism in Europe, and a Mahlerian funeral march; the piece ends with an exuberant fugal finale.Richards, Denby (1977). Notes to Chandos CD 8376 The Sinfonia moves from an opening Lacrymosa filled with fear and lamentation to a fierce Dies irae and then to a final Requiem aeternam, described by the critic Herbert Glass as \"the most uneasy 'eternal rest' possible\".Glass, Herbert. \"Sinfonia da Requiem\" , Los Angeles Philharmonic, accessed 26 June 2013 Mason considers the Sinfonia a failure: \"less entertaining than usual, because its object is not principally to entertain but to express symphonically. It fails because it is neither picturesquely nor formally symphonic\". The Sea Interludes, adapted by Britten from the full score of Peter Grimes, make a concert suite depicting the sea and the Borough in which the opera is set; the character of the music is strongly contrasted between \"Dawn\", \"Sunday Morning\", \"Moonlight\" and \"Storm\". The commentator Howard Posner observes that there is not a bar in the interludes, no matter how beautiful, that is free of foreboding.Posner, Howard. \"Four Sea Interludes\" , Los Angeles Philharmonic, accessed 26 June 2013 The Young Person's Guide, based on a theme by Purcell, showcases the orchestra's individual sections and groups, and gained widespread popularity from the outset.

Several Romantic-era composers wrote only one quartet, while Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k wrote 14. In the modern era, the string quartet played a key role in the development of Arnold Schoenberg (who was the first to add a soprano in his String Quartet No. 2), B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k, and Dmitri Shostakovich especially. After the Second World War, some composers, such as Olivier Messiaen questioned the relevance of the string quartet and avoided writing them. However, from the 1960s onwards, many composers have shown a renewed interest in the genre. During his tenure as Master of the Queen's Music, Peter Maxwell Davies produced a set of ten entitled the Naxos Quartets (to a commission from Naxos Records) from 2001 to 2007.

Britten agreed, and, a Suffolk man himself, was struck with a deep nostalgia by the poem. He later said, \"I suddenly realised where I belonged and what I lacked\".
