The band were aided by additional musicians: Chris Acker playing trombone on \"Art Is Hard\" and \"A Gentleman Caller\"; Jenny Lewis singing additional vocals on \"The Recluse\",\t\"Bloody Murderer\", and \"Sierra\"; and Mogis contributed vibraphone on \"The Recluse\", keyboard on \"Butcher the Song\", bells on \"Bloody Murderer\", and guitar on \"Sierra\". \"Staying Alive\" features a choir consisting of Clark Baechle, Todd Baechle, Julee Dunekacke, Rob Hawkins, Alisa Heinzman, Renee Ledesma Hoover, Alex McManus, AJ Mogis, Conor Oberst, and Sara Wilson.", "* Rob Hawkins"]}, {"page": "List of Jericho characters", "response": ["===Rob Hawkins==="]}, {"page": "Four Winds (EP)", "response": ["* Rob Hawkins \u2013 vocals"]}, {"page": "Robert Hawkins", "response": ["*Rob Hawkins (born 1983), English rugby union player"]}, {"page": "Paul Mullen", "response": ["Mullen suggested that musically, the pairing worked so well as Yourcodenameis:milo were heading in a more melodic, pop direction with their last album They Came from The Sun, whilst The Automatic were writing heavier, more guitar driven material, thus the two \"met in the middle\" when it came to writing material. The first The Automatic release to feature Mullen, This Is A Fix was recorded in Los Angeles with producer Butch Walker and would see Mullen split lead vocal responsibilities with the band's original singer, Rob Hawkins, guitars, keyboards, synthesizers and backing-vocals were also split between Mullen, Hawkins and James Frost.", "After extensive touring across Europe in 2008 and into 2009, the band would return to Cardiff to begin working with producer Richard Jackson on their third album.

Despite getting such varied reviews, the three main rock music publications in the UK, Kerrang, Rock Sound and NME, all praised the record. Al Fox of the BBC praised the album, saying \"The album is absolutely dripping with new ideas: the band's willingness to try them for size and to drop anything that doesn't immediately seem to be working means that only the cream of a very good crop of songs has made it onto the disc\". Drowned in Sound reviewer Mike Haydock was not as enthusiastic, stating; \"This Is a Fix may be good enough to save their bacon, but only just\", criticising some of Rob Hawkins lyrics in \"Bad Guy\" and \"This Ship\". Haydock however applauded the singles \"Steve McQueen\" and \"Magazines\", overall labelling the album as \"a pleasant mess\", giving it the score 6/10."]}, {"page": "Calum Clark", "response": ["In 2012, Clark was banned for 32 weeks, the longest ban in English rugby history at the time, for deliberately hyper-extending the arm of Leicester Tigers hooker Rob Hawkins causing a fractured elbow.
