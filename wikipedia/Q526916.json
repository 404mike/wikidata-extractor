Curzon had a life largely associated with music - besides composing, he conducted and was both a pianist and a noted organist. His early life was largely in the theatre, where he was musical director in several London West End theatres. He was the organist at Shepherds Bush Pavilion for many years and from 1939 and throughout the war conducted at Llandudno Pier. In 1938, he moved to the radio. The music he wrote was mainly of the English light music genre, but he also wrote for films, radio and the theatre. Curzon worked as Head of Light Music at publishers Boosey and Hawkes.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Curzon", "response": ["* Frederic Curzon (1899\u20131973), English composer, conductor and musician"]}, {"page": "Light music", "response": ["Often, the pieces represent a mood, place, person or object, for example Farnon's \"Portrait of a Flirt\", Albert Ket\u00e8lbey's In a Monastery Garden or Edward White's \"Runaway Rocking Horse\".\"Edward White: The Runaway Rocking Horse\", Land of Lost Content, accessed 15 November 2010 The genre's other popular title \"mood music\" is a reference to pieces such as Charles Williams' A Quiet Stroll, which is written at an andante pace and has a jaunty, cheery feel.Charles Williams , Robert Farnon Society, accessed 15 November 2010 Light music pieces are usually presented individually or as movements within a suite, and are often given individual descriptive titles.
