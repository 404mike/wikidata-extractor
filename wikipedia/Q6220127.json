The college was located in South Kensington on land bought by the 1851 Exhibition Commissioners, in an area set out by Prince Albert for the purpose of science and knowledge, known now as Albertopolis. The building was built by Alfred Waterhouse. The college was set to focus on engineering, manufacturing, architecture, applied art, and chemical technology, with applicants required to sit entrance exams. The college was granted permission to award the Associateship of the City and Guilds Institute, which the faculty still awards, although it was unable to award university degrees. Amongst the first appointed professors in 1884 were William Unwin to engineering and Henry Armstrong to chemical technology. The name changed to Central Technical College in 1893, by which time the number of chemistry and engineering students exceeded 200, requiring other subjects to be displaced.
