The principal songwriters for Forever More were: Alan Gorrie and Mick Strode, writing either as individuals or co-writing. Alan Gorrie, Onnie McIntyre, and Stuart Francis all originated from Scotland, whereas Mick Strode was born in Oldbury in the West Midlands. The band toured extensively in the United Kingdom and in Europe. They recorded two LPs: \"Yours\" and \"Words on Black Plastic\".", "Scottish musicians Alan Gorrie, Onnie McIntyre and Stuart Francis had previously been part of a band called Hopscotch, alongside two other Scottish musicians, namely pianist/vocalist Graham Maitland and vocalist Hamish Stuart (later of Crocodile, and Sir Paul McCartney's Wings). Mick Strode, meanwhile, had been the lead guitarist in various bands in the Midlands and in London, most notably with Robert Plant and John Bonham in the final 1968 lineup of their pre-Led Zeppelin group Band of Joy. Early in 1969 in Shepherd's Bush, London, Mick Strode met Alan, Onnie, and Stuart of Hopscotch; and soon afterwards the four of them formed Forever More. All of Forever More also played as session musicians in various studios in London.", "Shortly before disbanding in 1971 Forever More, by means of a simple name change, morphed into a band called Glencoe. The line-up was still the same: Mick Strode, on lead electric guitar, had already incorporated his mandolin playing and acoustic guitar into their live performances; and all four members were offering vocal harmonies, although Alan Gorrie remained the principal singer with Mick Strode singing solo on some numbers, especially on his own compositions. Since Alan Gorrie played both bass and piano, Onnie McIntyre would sometimes switch to playing bass for live performances.", "Not long after Forever More's change of name to Glencoe, however, Onnie McIntyre and Alan Gorrie decided to leave the band. Determined to continue as Glencoe, Mick Strode and Stuart Francis set about recruiting two new members for their band. The first musician who joined them was Graham Maitland, a pianist who had previously played with Stuart Francis, prior to Forever More's formation. The second new member was a very young bass player called Norman Watt-Roy, whose audition to join Glencoe is described in Dr.Sonja Strode's book (2011). This line-up toured widely in the United Kingdom until April 1972 when guitarist/songwriter Mick Strode decided to leave the band. Strode was replaced by John Turnbull and they released 2 further albums \"Glencoe\" (1972) and \"Spirit Of Glencoe\" (1973).", "Having left Forever More in 1972, Alan Gorrie and Onnie McIntyre formed the Average White Band, teaming up with Scottish saxophonists Roger Ball and Malcolm Duncan who had been part of Jimmy Litherland's Brotherhood (later known as Mogul Thrash).
