He is the fellow of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and Hong Kong Institute of Surveyors.Lau is also a non-official member of the Lantau Development Advisory Committee (LanDAC), which has controversially proposed developing Lantau Island to house up to one million residents (up from the current population of around 100,000). Lau stated that the proposed developments were \"relatively small scale and would not pose much conflict with conservation\", though the area marked for \"conservation\" actually includes large-scale commercial development such as the construction of resort hotels at Cheung Sha.Lau also served as the deputy director of the election campaign of Leung Chun-ying in the run-up to the 2012 Chief Executive election. Leung won a five-year term, beginning on 1 July 2012, with 689 votes. Speaking on the upcoming 2017 election, Lau stated that CY Leung would run again, and that the grievances of young people during his administration were not \"genuine\" and that they had \"overly high expectations\". He also stated that Leung could have achieved more were it not for filibustering by pan-democratic legislators.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2004 Hong Kong legislative election", "response": ["| Kaizer Lau Ping-cheung || Architectural, Surveying and Planning ||"]}, {"page": "Architectural, Surveying, Planning and Landscape (constituency)", "response": ["| Kaizer Lau"]}, {"page": "Lau Ping-cheung", "response": ["#REDIRECT Kaizer Lau"]}, {"page": "Lau Ping-cheong", "response": ["#REDIRECT Kaizer Lau"]}, {"page": "Kaizer Lau Ping-cheung", "response": ["#REDIRECT Kaizer Lau"]}, {"page": "Cheng Chung-tai", "response": ["In 2016, he was criticised by Kaizer Lau, a member of the governing council of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University for supporting and organising violent protests and advocating for Hong Kong independence.
