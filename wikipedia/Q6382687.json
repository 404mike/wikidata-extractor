The reference to Palmers Green was prompted by the fact that Trouble had split up with his girlfriend and was at a party thrown by his friend Charles \"Charlie Farley\" Hallinan near The Fox, Palmers Green.

In 1980, following appearances on the Stiff package tours, he had a solo hit with the synthpop number \"You'll Always Find Me in the Kitchen at Parties\" co-written with fellow Brett Marvin member Keef Trouble, which he occasionally performed live with Kirsty MacColl on backing vocals. The song made the British Top 20. His next single, \"Big Shot \u2013 Momentarily\", was a hit in Germany but not in the UK. By the end of 1980, he was back in the British charts with what became his biggest UK hit, \"Stop the Cavalry\". His subsequent 1981 release, \"Louise (We Get It Right)\" reached No. 2 in Australia, and achieved chart success in other world territories. His next two singles, \"Vous et Moi\" and \"The Seed That Always Died\", both charted in France. Both \"Kitchen at Parties\" and \"Stop the Cavalry\" had also been hits in Germany at the times of their original releases in 1980 and 1981 respectively, and remained popular in Germany. In 2010 and 2011, both tracks achieved prominent positions in an all-time German chart that appeared in a high ratings TV show. Lewie performed the two songs on two episodes of The Ultimate Chart Show which was broadcast 2010 and 2011. He also talked on the 'chat' part of the show with the aid of a German interpreter."]}, {"page": "Monkey stick", "response": ["The \"zob stick\" variation of this instrument was constructed and named in 1968 by percussionist and songwriter Keef Trouble of the band Brett Marvin and the Thunderbolts and Terry Dactyl and the Dinosaurs, and included a sprung-boot attached to the bottom of the pole and a metal sleeve round its centre, to be hit with a serrated wooden stick.
