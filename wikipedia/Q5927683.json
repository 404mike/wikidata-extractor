He enlisted in the Welsh Regiment in 1914 and, after serving briefly in France, he was reposted to the Macedonian front of the First World War. During a night raid on German trenches, despite being wounded twice, he single-handedly captured three enemy soldiers before carrying a wounded officer back to safety under artillery fire. For his actions he was awarded the Victoria Cross, becoming the youngest Welsh recipient of the award. He later performed a similar feat when carrying a captain to safety in 1918 during an assault on an enemy position.\nAfter the war, he returned to Milford Haven where he married and raised three children. He continued working in the local fish market, first as a trader before becoming the foreman for an ice company at the site for over 40 years. He served in the Home Guard during the Second World War. Prior to his death in 1977, he was the last surviving Welsh Victoria Cross recipient from the First World War.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Welsh people", "response": ["*Hubert William Lewis VC (1896\u20131977)"]}, {"page": "Milford Haven", "response": ["Of those born in the town, Hubert William Lewis was awarded the Victoria Cross for acts of bravery during the First World War.vconline.org.uk W.G. \"Gugs\" Gwilliam was awarded the Conspicuous Gallantry Medal for acts of bravery whilst serving on board  during the Battle of the River Plate.Pembroke County War Memorial Retrieved 17 January 2011 Other residents include Robert Fulke Greville and his uncle Charles Francis Greville, who improved and expanded Milford Haven as a more commercial and modern settlement, and John Zephaniah Holwell, a surgeon employed by the English East India Company and survivor of the Black Hole of Calcutta, who owned \"Castle Hall\" in the 1770s.Castle Hall  Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales; Retrieved 2 January 2010 Samuel Lake is remembered for his ambitious bid to complete Milford Docks for \u00a380,000 in a mere seven months in 1880, and his subsequent bankruptcy in 1883 which delayed actual completion for a number of years.James Frederick Rees The Story of Milford, University of Wales Press, 1954 ASIN B000MYZBCQ An ecclesiastic figure to gain prominence from the town was Frederick Ebenezer Lloyd, an independent Catholic bishop who contributed to the early development of the American Catholic Church.
