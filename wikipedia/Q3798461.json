The 21st century has already seen five new translations of the novel into English. The first is by John D. Rutherford and the second by Edith Grossman. Reviewing the novel in the New York Times, Carlos Fuentes called Grossman's translation a \"major literary achievement\" and another called it the \"most transparent and least impeded among more than a dozen English translations going back to the 17th century.\"", "* J.

M. A. Screech is of this latter opinion, and, introducing his translation, he bemoans that \"[s]ome read back into the Four books the often cryptic meanings they find in the Fifth\". Donald M. Frame is of the opinion that, when Rabelais died, he \"probably left some materials on where to go on from Book 4\", and that somebody, \"after some adding and padding\", assembled the book that he does not find \"either clearly or largely authentic\". Frame is \"taken with\" Mireille Huchon's work in \"Rabelais Grammairien\",\"Rabelais grammairien. De l'histoire du texte aux probl\u00e8mes d'authenticit\u00e9\", Mirelle Huchon, in Etudes Rabelaisiennes XVI, Geneva, 1981 which he cites in support of his opinion. J. M. Cohen, in his Introduction to a Penguin Classics edition, indicates that chapters 17\u201348 were so out-of-character as to be seemingly written by another person, with the Fifth Book \"clumsily patched together by an unskilful editor.\"", "J. M. Cohen, in the preface to his translation, says Urquhart's part is \"more like a brilliant recasting and expansion than a translation\"; but criticised Motteux's as \"no better than competent hackwork... [W]here Urquhart often enriches, he invariably impoverishes\". Likewise, M. A. Screech says that the \"translation of Urquhart and Motteux [...] is at times a recasting [...] rather than a translation\"; and says it \"remains a joy to read for its own self\". Donald M.

J. J. Ratcliff's Prose of Our Time (London 1931) \"one whose pen possesses the sparkle and fascination which made the essay, in the hands of writers such as Bacon and Montaigne, a thing of beauty and interest\".Cassell's advertisement for Lucas's Studies French and English (London 1934), dust-jacket Raymond Mortimer in The Sunday Times, however, found the author \"sometimes laboured in his anxiety to be debonair\". Some reviewers expressed the view that \"The book's most obvious merit lies in its quotations\" (Rayner Heppenstall in the New Statesman). \"There are almost as many in French as in English, and their range and aptness are remarkable.\"Rayner Heppenstall, 'Prose for General Purposes', review of Style in The New Statesman and Nation, 24 September 1955, p.371-372 Others, however, felt that there should have been fewer examples from poetry and more from contemporary prose.J. M. Cohen, review of Style in The Spectator, 18 November 1955 The Listener approved \"the entertaining relevance of anecdote\".Review of Style in The Listener, September 1955 Sir Bruce Fraser praised Lucas's close analysis of faulty style: \"The passage in which he dissects a great hunk of Swinburne's prose, reduces it by more than half, recognizes that it could be made shorter still, and ends by suggesting that it need not have been written at all, is in itself worth the whole price of the book\".Foreword by Sir Bruce Fraser to 1974 Cassell reprint of Style Philip Toynbee of The Observer disliked the work and dismissed its author as \"middlebrow\": \"There have been wonderful styles which illustrate the virtues of clarity, brevity, simplicity and vitality. Other styles, no less wonderful, have exhibited obscurity, amplitude, complexity and decadence. Good writers have been urbane, gay and healthy: other good writers have been boorish, melancholic and diseased... Mr Lucas pays lip-service to the recalcitrant disorder of the scene\" but \"writes far too briefly of variety\".Philip Toynbee, review of Style in The Observer, 11 September 1955 More recently, Joseph Epstein in The New Criterion (2011) considered the book \"filled with fine things ... F. L. Lucas wrote the best book on prose composition, for the not-so-simple reason that, in the modern era, he was the smartest, most cultivated man to turn his energies to the task\".Epstein, Joseph, 'Heavy Sentences', The New Criterion June 2011  The 2011 article \"brought attention to this neglected classic and helped set in train its reissue\".F.
