Nicholas began to feature regularly for Celtic, and on 30 August scored his first goals in major competition when he netted twice during a 6\u20131 win over Stirling Albion in the Scottish League Cup. Playing up front alongside one of either Frank McGarvey or George McCluskey, he went on to score 20 goals in 23 games up to the end of December 1980. He continued to score regularly after the turn of the year, including two goals against Rangers in February 1981 as Celtic came from behind to win 3\u20131 and go top of the league.  Manager Billy McNeill praised Nicholas, stating \"It's a wonderful thing for a youngster to score twice in one of those [Old Firm] games\", adding that \"The world is going to hear a lot more about Charlie [Nicholas]\". He finished the season with a total of 28 goals, the last of which he scored in a 1\u20130 win over Rangers at Ibrox in April 1981, and Celtic went on to clinch the Scottish Premier Division title days later with a win away at Dundee United. Nicholas' form saw him win the 1981 Scottish PFA Young Player of the Year Award.", "Nicholas returned to the team for the start of season 1982\u201383 in August 1982, playing in all six matches of the group stages of the 1982\u201383 Scottish League Cup, scoring seven goals as Celtic qualified with ease, including a four-goal haul in a 7\u20131 rout of Dunfermline. Celtic, and Nicholas, continued their goalscoring form into the league campaign, and by mid September Nicholas had amassed a total of 16 goals. Celtic faced Ajax in the first round of the European Cup in September 1982. Nicholas scored a penalty in the first leg at Parkhead, which finished 2\u20132 on the night. Celtic went into the second leg as underdogs, but an outstanding goal by Nicholas put Celtic ahead in Amsterdam. In a move also involving Paul McStay and Frank McGarvey, Nicholas received the ball from McGarvey and ran into the Ajax penalty box. He evaded two tackles from Ajax defenders before curling an excellently placed left-foot finish past goalkeeper Piet Schrijvers.  Ajax later scored themselves, but a last minute winner from George McCluskey saw Celtic progress 3\u20132 on aggregate. Nicholas later said of his goal, \"That was probably my all-time favourite goal. My greatest game.\"", "Nicholas was now being described as the most outstanding young player to emerge in Scotland since Kenny Dalglish. He displayed an excellent touch and great vision on the ball and possessed a strong shot with both feet.  The only asset he lacked was a turn of pace, although his other attributes covered for that. His partnership up front with Frank McGarvey helped Nicholas become the leading goalscorer in Scotland and one of the best strikers in the British game. On 4 December 1982, he opened the scoring for Celtic in their 2\u20131 win over Rangers in the 1982 Scottish League Cup Final. After New Year, Nicholas became the centre of intense media speculation linking him with a move to England; with television, radio and newspapers journalists travelling north to cover Nicholas' goalscoring exploits. The Celtic star was featured regularly on the Saturday lunch-time television show Saint and Greavsie which showed Nicholas' latest goals. Despite his prolific goalscoring, the uncertainty over his future at Celtic appeared to unsettle the team towards the end of the season and they ended up losing the league to Dundee United. In the final league match of the season, Nicholas scored twice from penalty kicks as Celtic recovered from a 2\u20130 deficit at half-time against Rangers to win 4\u20132. At the end of the game he ran behind the goal to wave what appeared to be his \"goodbyes\" to the Celtic fans.", "With the lack of a striker of the ilk of Frank McGarvey to play alongside at Arsenal, Nicholas barely broke double figures in the following seasons, not helped that he was also often played just off the main striker. Whilst Nicholas could display extravagant skills, a lack of consistency restricted his impact. The arrival of George Graham as the new manager of Arsenal in the summer of 1986 saw Nicholas no longer have an automatic place in the team. Arsenal, however, did reach the League Cup final against Liverpool in April 1987. Liverpool's Ian Rush gave his side the lead on 23 minutes, but Nicholas equalised seven minutes later after a goal mouth scramble. In the second half, he appeared to be fouled in the penalty box by Gary Gillespie, but the referee ignored Arsenal's claims for a penalty. With seven minutes left, Nicholas received a cross from Perry Groves and shot at goal. The ball took a deflection off Ronnie Whelan, and went into the goal having deceived Bruce Grobbelaar. Arsenal held on to win 2\u20131. With this Wembley brace Nicholas thus became a club hero."]}, {"page": "History of Celtic F.C. (1887\u20131994)", "response": ["McNeill led Celtic to another two league titles in 1981 and 1982, and oversaw the emergence of another crop of promising young players such as Charlie Nicholas, Paul McStay and Irish goalkeeper Pat Bonner.  Nicholas by 1983 was one of Scottish football's most exciting prospects.  He had formed a deadly goalscoring partnership with Frank McGarvey and in season 1982\u201383 he scored 48 goals in the major competitions.  These goals included an excellent goal in a 2\u20131 win over Ajax in the European Cup, the opening goal in Celtic's 2\u20131 League Cup Final over Rangers in December 1982, and a brace in the final league game of the season at Ibrox, Celtic coming back to defeat Rangers 4\u20132 after trailing 0\u20132 at half-time.  Nicholas' form attracted the attention of several big-name English clubs, and at the end of the season he moved to Arsenal in an \u00a3750,000 deal.", "May 1985 saw David Hay win his first trophy as manager, as Celtic overturned a 1\u20130 deficit in the centenary final of the Scottish Cup to defeat Dundee United 2\u20131.  Trailing to Dundee United, Hay make a tactical change in the second half by pushing Roy Aitken forward from central defence into midfield.  The move proved a success as Aitken's presence in midfield began to galvanise Celtic.  A virtuoso free-kick from Davie Provan in 77 minutes equalised the earlier goal from Dundee Utd's Stuart Beedie, only the third occasion that a goal had been scored direct from a free-kick in a Scottish Cup Final.  Five minutes from the end, a driving run and cross from down the right by Aitken set up a diving header from Frank McGarvey to win the game for Celtic."]}]}}
