Milson lost his case against Campbell based on non-payment of a lease agreement between himself and Campbell. The case mentioned that Milson leased a farm of 120 acres (48ha) from Robert Campbell. In this case Milson did not purport to own the land that he was leasing. Milson instead referred to Campbell's absence of proof of title which made it impossible to ascertain the boundary between the 120 acres (48ha) that Milson leased from Campbell, and the adjoining \"very large portion of land\" (acreage not stated in the case but known to be 50 acres (20ha)) that Milson had received as a grant from Governor Sir Thomas Brisbane in August 1824. It is true, however, that Milson did dispute Campbells ownership of the land during the nearly 3 years from 1828 that he ceased paying rent. During this time Milson wrote to the Surveyor-General and Governor Ralph Darling in an attempt to have the land recognised as his own instead of Robert Campbell's. The reply that Milson received on 13 March 1829 was that he could not obtain the land as it was the property of Robert Campbell, and that the land that Milson owned (the adjoining 50 acres) was already measured and marked out.", "|| The governor being discussed here is Governor King, who was not governor during the time that James Milson was in the Colony.

He established his dairy & orchard on land leased from Robert Campbell (see MAPS 1-3 in this article).", "|| This has no basis in fact. Lachlan Macquarie ceased being governor on 1 December 1820. In June 1820 James Milson had a memorial written to Governor Macquarie stating that he was living at Pennant Hills on a grant that Governor Macquarie had given him and requesting more land.

Initially before he could obtain a land grant of his own he needed to obtain employment. A court case between Campbell and Milson in 1831 stated that Campbell was a former employer of Milson.

Milson began to lease 120 acres (48ha) of land from Robert Campbell being the headland that includes Kirribilli and Milsons Points. There is a note held by the North Sydney Historical Society that states that Milson at first thought this land to be \"nothing but rocks and stones, not enough soil to grow grass to feed stock.\" This does not agree with Milson's desire to lease the land from Campbell, or his attempting to establish a dairy and orchard there, something that he was able to do successfully. The headland was indeed partly rocky but also contained areas of useful farm land. The rockiness was also useful in providing building materials, and from a quarry on Careening Bay a business of supplying sandstone ballast to shipping. Warne's variation of this story is that Milson found the land to be \"rocky and uncompromising but he was assured that the soil was good for farming and grazing, and he was provided two convicts to assist with the clearing\". This does not agree with Milson's experience as a man who had already been farming in the Colony for 15 years, or, in his own words, that Milson had been assigned convict servants from about 1810.", "Milson initially leased this 120 acres of land for 7 years which extended to 30 June 1828End of initial 7 year term of lease calculated from information provided in the court case of 1831. for a rent of \u00a310 per annum \"as a matter of favour\" from Campbell. A lease agreement was signed by both parties with each taking a copy. The lease was then extended in a memorandum between the parties for a further period of 3 years to 30 June 1831 on the same terms. Non-payment of the rent on this lease between 1828 and 1831 became the basis of a court action in August 1831. By the time that Milson had stopped making rent payments on the lease, however, both parties had accidentally lost their copies of the original lease agreement, and Campbell had also accidentally lost his title deeds to the land. Once the court case was concluded with Milson being ordered to pay the rental arrears as damages, Milson continued to lease land from Robert Campbell until Campbell's death in 1846, and then from subsequent owners. A map from the 1840s show that Milson was still then leasing a smaller part of the 120 acres.", "It is on part of the 120 acres (48ha) that Milson began to lease from Robert Campbell in 1821 that Milson built his dairy and his orchard and also grew vegetables in the area of the modern day Jeffrey Street. It is also on the small portion of the leased 120 acres where Milson established his dairy, orchard and vegetable gardens that Milson built his first home in the area, and another dwelling called \"The Milk House\" which became \"a well known resort of Sunday-goers\" from Sydney. It was from the 120 acres of leased land that Milson built a good business supplying ships in Sydney Harbour with fresh fruit and vegetables, milk and water, as well as ballast from a quarry near Careening Cove.", "In August 1824 Milson received from Governor Sir Thomas Brisbane a land grant of 50 acres (20ha) further up the headland and adjoining the 120 acres that Milson leased from Robert Campbell. (Elizabeth Warne incorrectly states that this 50 acres was received not as a land grant but as a promissary note.) This land grant gave Milson additional land on which to graze his dairy herd. This land grant also allowed Milson to be shown as a landholder in the District of Sydney in the 1825 muster of New South Wales rather than a resident as in the earlier 1822 muster. As Milson owned this 50 acres rather than leasing it, it was on this 50 acres that he built his family homes of \"Brisbane House\" (1831) and \"Grantham\". This land grant also made Milson not just one of the areas most prominent businessmen but also one of the area\u2019s most prominent landholders.", "Devastating bushfires occurred in November 1826, with \"a house in the occupation of Milsom, a milkman on the North Shore\" being burnt down on Saturday 25 November 1826. Elizabeth Warne also correctly records that the bushfires destroyed what was the other dwelling on the property, the \"Milk House\", but incorrectly calls it a dairy building. The Australian Dictionary of Biography reports that Milson lost in the fire the title deeds of his land at Pennant Hills (close to Castle Hill) and his 50-acre (20\u00a0ha) grant at \"Hunter's Hill\" (then the name for the area of North Sydney that includes today's suburb of Kirribilli and not to be confused with the today's modern day suburb of Hunters Hill) which adjoined the 120 acres (48ha) that Milson leased from Robert Campbell where Milson's dairy and orchard stood. If he lost the title deeds to these lands he also lost the title deeds to his other landholdings including those at Wollombi. (Loss of these title deeds did not force Milson to buy \"some 890 acres\" of land including land at Wollombi as claimed by Elizabeth Warne. Milson already owned this land prior to the fire, having, for example, purchased Wollombi in 1825. Loss of his title deeds had no long term consequence on Milson and those lands owned prior to the bushfire were also included in his will of July 1829. The subsequent 1831 court case between Campbell and Milson over Milson's non-payment of rent on the lease of 120 acres of land at \"Hunter's Hill\" discloses that Milson's copy of the lease document was accidentally lost, probably in the same bushfire.", "Milson then attempted to obtain ownership of the land that he knew was owned by Robert Campbell by surreptitious means. In September 1828 Milson wrote to the Surveyor-General and expressed surprise that the land on which his house stood had been \"measured to the Honourable Robert Campbell whose claim has never been properly established.\" Milson also wrote to the Governor on 3 October 1828 in a letter which stated \"I have also to inform your Excellency that during the absence of the Surveyor-General, who is in Argyllshire, Messrs Cordeaux and Finch tool it upon themselves to erase my name which stood in the chart for the land which I am now in possession of, and are endeavouring to trump up a claim in favour of the Honourable Robert Campbell for the said land.\" Milson received a reply on 13 March 1829 from the Colonial Secretary, Alexander Macleay, which stated \"I am directed by His Excellency the Governor (Ralph Darling) to inform you that if you allude to the spot on which you have built you must be aware that you cannot obtain it as it is the property of Mr Robert Campbell, who states that he actually gave a lease of it to you, and that the land to which you are entitled\" (the adjoining 50 acres) \"is already measured and marked out.\"", "Around 1806 Ryan, who knew nothing about farming, sold the property to Robert Campbell, a wealthy Sydney merchant.
