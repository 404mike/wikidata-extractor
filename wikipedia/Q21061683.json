The Bees had a good first half of the Southern League First Division season, losing just five of the opening 20 matches, with Geordie Reid (Southern League XI) and Steve Buxton and John Christie (both London XI) winning representative honours. Despite the promising form, the majority of the team's goals were scored by Reid, who bagged 14 goals in a 17-match spell.  ", "Brentford's promotion challenge was effectively ended by a 3\u20130 defeat to Swindon Town (champions at the end of the season) on 7 January 1911 and the team slipped from 5th position into mid-table. Injuries to George Kennedy, Joe Ryalls, Geordie Reid and George Anderson at differing times disrupted the attack and Brentford finished the season having scored 41 league goals, with Geordie Reid having scored over half the team's total (21), which equalled Adam Bowman's club record for most Southern League goals in a season.
