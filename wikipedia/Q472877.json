The \"castellano\" or Spanish of Mena's time is generally understandable to speakers of Spanish today and even to advanced non-native students of Spanish.  Mena's language, however, is considerably more difficult.  He uses many archaic words that even in his day had already fallen out of use.  Even more often, he uses Latinisms.  Some of the Latin words that Mena introduces were later adopted into Spanish, most were not. This linguistic experimentation creates a text that can only be read with great difficulty, and we may assume that Mena's contemporaries faced a similar difficulty.  As medieval Spanish scholar Alan Deyermond states, \"the precise meaning of some lines has baffled editors from the late-fifteenth-century\u2026to the present\"."]}, {"page": "Mocedades de Rodrigo", "response": ["Although the five battles had remained vague in earlier versions of the Mocedades de Rodrigo,Alberto Montaner Frutos, \"The Gesta de las mocedades de Rodrigo* (Heroic Deeds of the Youth of Rodrigo) and the Cr\u00f3nica particular del Cid (Specific Chronicle of El Cid)\", in V.

At this point, the king of France, the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire and the Pope demand a humiliating tribute from Castile, amongst the items demanded in tribute are fifteen noble virgin maidens each year. Faced with this situation, Rodrigo encourages King Fernando to conquer France and together, finally, they will triumph over the coalition formed by the count of Savoy, the King of France, the Emperor and the Pope.
