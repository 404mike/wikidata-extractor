He was born in Shanghai and died in Cape Town. \nHe appeared in 62 first-class matches between 1931 and 1950 as a right-handed batsman who bowled occasional leg breaks. Most of his cricket in the 1930s was for Sir Julien Cahn's XI. His only full seasons of county cricket were for Nottinghamshire in 1946 and 1947. After his playing career finished he settled in South Africa, where he became a prominent coach. Basil D'Oliveira was one of the young players he coached.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1947 English cricket season", "response": ["Nottinghamshire, captained for the first time by William Sime, drew half of their matches and only the top three had less defeats. They lost Bill Voce early in the season to retirement and this placed a heavy burden on the remaining pace bowlers Arthur Jepson and Harold Butler. They did well, both taking over 100 wickets and Butler being picked for England, but they lacked support. The only other bowler to make any kind of impression was slow left armer Harry Winrow who took 56 championship wickets. Winrow was one of five batsmen to score 1,000 runs. The best of these by a distance was England's Joe Hardstaff junior who had an outstanding season, scoring 2,396 with seven centuries. Walter Keeton, Reg Simpson and Tom Reddick all topped 1,000 runs while Charles Harris was approaching the landmark when his season was ended early by illness. Wicketkeeper Eric Meads claimed 52 victims in championship matches. Cambridge University captain Guy Willatt batted well when available and young Peter Harvey, leg break and googly bowler, looked a good prospect, but Freddie Stocks did not fulfil the promise he showed in 1946.Playfair, pp. 102\u2013103. Nottinghamshire made exclusive use of their headquarters at Trent Bridge in Nottingham for their thirteen home matches."]}, {"page": "Sir Julien Cahn's XI cricket team in Ceylon in 1936\u201337", "response": ["The team played nine games in all but the majority were against minor opposition.
