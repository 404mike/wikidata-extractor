The death of bowler Dove Gregory on 21 May at the age of 35 left a potential hole, but it was amply filled by William Mycroft' an ironstone miner and later publican, making his debut in the season. Derbyshire further strengthened their side with the arrival of Alfort Smith as wicket-keeper from Lancashire, and Thomas Foster, both from the cotton mills of Glossop, and William Rigley a blacksmith. These three subsequently saw several years of service with the club. Other new players were Rev. William Humble, a local curate, who played occasionally over a few years,  Thomas Howarth another cotton worked from Glossop who put in a single career first class appearance. Veteran president William Jervis, a lawyer, stepped in for one game. Additional players who made up the 16 member side against Nottinghamshire were John Frost, a joiner from Wirksworth,  who played first-class for Derbyshire in the following season,  Rev. Robert Moncreiff later 3rd Baron Moncreiff and unidentified players W Allen and Edward Tatlow."]}, {"page": "Howarth, Thomas", "response": ["#redirectThomas Howarth"]}]}}
