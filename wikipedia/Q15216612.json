Thompson began her career at the age of ten by filming herself singing and uploading the videos to YouTube. In 2014, she was featured on German deep house producer Robin Schulz's song \"Sun Goes Down\", which charted within the top 10 in multiple countries including Australia, Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. As of March 2019, her YouTube channel has amassed over 3.3 million subscribers and over 570 million views.\nHer acoustic cover version of Chaka Khan's original \"Ain't Nobody\" reached number 32 on the UK Singles Chart in 2013; this success led to the song being featured in an advertisement by Sainsbury's. The remixed version from Thompson was then remixed again by DJ Felix Jaehn\u2014as \"Ain't Nobody (Loves Me Better)\"\u2014in 2015 and became a huge hit, peaking at number two in the UK, and charting in several other countries.
