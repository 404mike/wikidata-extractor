The match between Warwickshire and Sussex petered out into a draw when neither side could agree to set up a fourth-innings chase. The gap between the two leading sides was closed considerably when Durham defeated Yorkshire by seven wickets, in what was the first-placed county's first loss since their opening fixture of the season. Surrey's first win of the season, against relegation rivals Derbyshire, allowed them to move above their opponents in the table, while remaining adrift of both Somerset and Nottinghamshire. However, four days later, Surrey fell to their fourth defeat of the season, against Middlesex, in a match in which off-spinner Ollie Rayner took fifteen wickets. A comprehensive victory against Sussex within three days put Durham into the lead of the Championship, 14.5 points ahead of Yorkshire, with three games apiece to be played. At the other end of the table, Derbyshire won in a close-fought contest at Taunton, where having been nearly 200 behind after their first innings, Somerset recovered to post Derbyshire a target of 244, which was achieved with two wickets to spare. A washout on the final day of their game denied Nottinghamshire a chance to win against Warwickshire, leaving the 2010 champions on the cusp of the relegation battle. A rain-affected draw for Yorkshire against Sussex, while Durham completed a nine-wicket victory against Derbyshire (bowling them out for just 63 in the second innings), left Yorkshire trailing Durham by 27.5 points with two games each remaining. Meanwhile, in the relegation battle, a win for Somerset over Surrey, and a draw for Nottinghamshire against Middlesex, ensured that both Somerset and Nottinghamshire were clear of the relegation zone. Derbyshire and Surrey occupied the bottom two spots, with one and two games left, respectively."]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1978\u2013)", "response": ["* Ollie Rayner (2014) : O.
