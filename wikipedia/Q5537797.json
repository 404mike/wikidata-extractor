He was a left-arm fast bowler who played for Nottinghamshire. He was born in Ilkeston and died in New Awsworth.\nChambers' debut came during the 1896 County Championship season, against Sussex. Batting in the tailend, he finished not out in the first innings in which he batted, and with a sturdy 16 runs in his second innings.\nChambers had to wait nearly three seasons until he played first-class cricket again, during the 1899 season - in which his first action was to bowl out Stanley Jackson. He would play just two matches during the season - his final match coming against Derbyshire, who narrowly avoided an innings defeat following the wicket of Joe Humphries.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Chambers (disambiguation)", "response": ["George Chambers (1928\u20131997) was Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago.", "George Chambers may also refer to:", "*George Chambers (cricketer, born 1866) (1866\u20131927), English cricketer", "*George Chambers (cricketer, born 1884) (1884\u20131947), English cricketer", "*George Chambers (New York politician) (1815\u20131880), New York politician", "*George Chambers (painter) (1803\u20131840), British maritime artist", "*George Chambers (Pennsylvania politician) (1786\u20131866), U.S. Representative from Pennsylvania", "*George Chambers (born 1931), of The Chambers Brothers", "*George Chambers (MP) (1766\u2013?), English soldier, lawyer and Member of Parliament"]}]}}
