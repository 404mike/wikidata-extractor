Her dates of birth and death are not known. Mary Kent appeared in many playbills from 1692 onwards in London, playing minor parts in the United Company until the company's tumultuous breakup in 1695. She and her husband remained with the depleted parent troupe when the senior actors walked out to set up their own cooperative company, and during the consequent brief actor shortage at Drury Lane, she played more important parts, notably Flareit in Colley Cibber's Love's Last Shift and young Tom Fashion (as a breeches role) in John Vanbrugh's The Relapse in 1697.\nThis role came at a time when it was common for boys to be portrayed by actresses and her casting was described as perhaps \"an attempt to defuse the homosexual suggestions in his (Tom Fashion's) relationship with Coupler.\"She continued to appear in minor roles at Drury Lane up to 1710, and had her first and only taste of female lead roles at the theatre operated by William Penkethman at Greenwich during the summer season of 1710. After this experience she did not return to supporting roles, but instead worked at a puppet theatre from 1710 to 1714. Only when John Rich opened his new theatrical enterprise in Lincoln's Inn Fields in December 1714 did she return to the stage, appearing in playbills for Rich's company up to 1718. That year she appeared in The Traitor by Christopher Bullock.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Relapse", "response": ["The only well-regarded performers available were the Verbruggens, John and Susanna, who had been re-seduced by Rich from Betterton's company. They were of course used in Love's Last Shift, with John playing Loveless, the male lead, and his wife Susanna the flirtatious heiress Narcissa, a secondary character. The rest of the cast consisted of the new and untried (for instance Hildebrand Horden, who had just joined Rich's troupe, playing a rakish young lover), the modest and lacklustre (Jane Rogers, playing Amanda, and Mary Kent, playing Sir Novelty's mistress Flareit), and the widely disliked (the opportunist Colley Cibber, playing Sir Novelty Fashion); people who had probably never been given the option of joining Betterton. Betterton's only rival as male lead, George Powell, had most likely been left behind by the rebels with some relief (Milhous); while Powell was skilled and experienced, he was also notorious for his bad temper and alcoholism. Throughout the \"seduction\" tug-of-war between Rich and Betterton in 1695\u201396, Powell remained at Drury Lane, where he was in fact not used for Love's Last Shift, but would instead spectacularly demonstrate his drinking problem at the premi\u00e8re of The Relapse.", "Hildebrand Horden, who had played a \"wild\" young lover in Love's Last Shift, was the only young, handsome, potential romantic lead Rich had. He was presumably cast by Vanbrugh as Tom Fashion, Lord Foppington's clever younger brother (Holland), and it was a blow to the Patent Company when he was killed in a tavern brawl (more glamorously referred to as a \"duel\" in older sources) in May. At the premi\u00e8re in November, Tom Fashion was instead played as a breeches role by Mary Kent, an unusual piece of emergency casting that puts a different face on a uniquely frank homosexual scene where Tom keeps skipping nimbly out of the way of the matchmaker Coupler's lecherous groping."]}, {"page": "A Bold Stroke for a Wife", "response": ["A Bold Stroke for a Wife was first performed at the Lincoln's Inn Fields Theatre, on 3 February 1718, where it ran six nights, which was considered a substantial success.
