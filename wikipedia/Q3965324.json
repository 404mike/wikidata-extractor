Joel released his seventh studio album, Glass Houses, in 1980 in an attempt to further establish himself as a rock artist; this release featured \"It's Still Rock and Roll to Me\" (Joel's first single to top the Billboard Hot 100 chart), \"You May Be Right\", \"Don't Ask Me Why\", and \"Sometimes a Fantasy\". His next album, The Nylon Curtain, was released in 1982, and stemmed from a desire from Joel to create more lyrically and melodically ambitious music. An Innocent Man, released in 1983, served as an homage to genres of music which Joel had grown up with in the 1950s, such as rhythm and blues and doo-wop; this release featured \"Uptown Girl\" and \"The Longest Time\", two of his best-known songs. After releasing the albums The Bridge and Storm Front in 1986 and 1989 respectively, Joel released his twelfth studio album, River of Dreams, in 1993. He went on to release Fantasies and Delusions, a 2001 album featuring classical compositions composed by Joel and performed by British-Korean pianist Richard Hyung-ki Joo. Joel provided voiceover work in 1988 for the Disney animated film Oliver & Company, in which he played the character Dodger with his song, \"Why Should I Worry?\", and contributed to the soundtracks to several different films, including Easy Money, Ruthless People, and Honeymoon in Vegas.", "In 2001, Joel released Fantasies & Delusions, a collection of classical piano pieces. All were composed by Joel and performed by Hyung-ki Joo. Joel often uses bits of these songs as interludes in live performances, and some of them are part of the score for the hit show Movin' Out. The album topped the classical charts at No. 1. Joel performed \"New York State of Mind\" live on September 21, 2001, as part of the America: A Tribute to Heroes benefit concert, and on October 20, 2001, along with \"Miami 2017 (Seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway)\", at the Concert for New York City in Madison Square Garden.
