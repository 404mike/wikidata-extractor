As a player, he was an opening batsman who played over 300 games in first-class and List A cricket for Nottinghamshire before a shorter stay with Worcestershire. After retiring from top-line county cricket in 2002, he had one season with Lincolnshire and appeared twice for them in List A matches. His medium-pace bowling was of the occasional variety, and with it he captured four first-class wickets. He has also coached, including in Zimbabwe.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mathew Dowman", "response": ["He continued to play Minor Counties cricket for Lincolnshire and built up a steady playing partnership with Paul Pollard during Lincolnshire's Minor Counties Championship win in 2003."]}, {"page": "Pollard (surname)", "response": ["* Paul Pollard (born 1968), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Warwickshire County Cricket Club in 1994", "response": ["Warwickshire won the toss and fielded first on an overcast day and slow pitch. Stand-in captain Tim Munton took an early wicket but Nottinghamshire dominated the first day with Paul Pollard scoring a century in 295 minutes. He shared hundred partnerships with both Graeme Archer (41) and Paul Johnson (63) as the visitors closed a curtailed opening day on 268/4. Chris Lewis dominated the scoring on day two, taking his overnight score of 20 to 220 not out by the time of the declaration. He scored 21 fours and 6 sixes in his innings, and added 157 in 27 overs with Kevin Evans. Warwickshire lost three wickets in the remaining 20 over session. Warwickshire were made to follow on despite lower order resistance from Graeme Welch. He scored a career best 84 not out sharing in an eighth wicket stand of 68 with Neil Smith and added 86 with tail-enders Gladstone Small and Munton. Following on, Brian Lara was dismissed for a duck which brought his season average below 100 for the first time. The hosts closed day three on 134/3 with Roger Twose unbeaten on 74. Twose and overnight partner, Trevor Penney, were both dismissed inside the first 10 overs of the final day to reduce hopes of drawing the match. Three other wickets fell before lunch and Nottinghamshire's victory was achieved 45 minutes after the interval when Munton fell to Lewis, his sixth of the match."]}]}}
