Nicknamed 'Chopper' for his fully committed playing style, Chalmers played 80 minutes of the 1961 FA Cup Final hobbling on the wing after suffering a badly gashed shin which rendered him no more than nuisance value as no substitutions were then allowed. Leicester City lost 2\u20130 to Tottenham Hotspur. After leaving Notts County, he played non-league football for Dunstable Town.Chalmers died on 10 February 2014 at the age of 77.

Yet their greatest accomplishment was in reaching the final of the FA Cup, with Banks conceding only five goals in their nine games en route to the final, and keeping three clean sheets in the semi-final and two replays against Sheffield United. Goals from Jimmy Walsh and Ken Leek finally broke the deadlock in the second replay at St Andrew's. Their opponents in the final at Wembley were Tottenham, who had already won the First Division title by an eight-point margin. Right-back Len Chalmers picked up a severe injury early in the match, and with Ken Leek dropped for disciplinary reasons in favour of rookie Hughie McIlmoyle, City were effectively playing with ten men and offered little threat going forward. Bobby Smith and Terry Dyson gave Spurs a 2\u20130 win and the first \"double\" of the 20th century, with Banks unable to prevent either goal."]}, {"page": "Gerry Byrne (footballer, born 1938)", "response": ["The aftermath of another high-profile match led to calls, again, for the Football Association to allow a substitute to be selected by each team in competitive matches. In FA Cup finals over the previous decade there had been a notable number of teams reduced to ten men or hampered considerably by hard challenges from opposition players. This included goalkeepers Bert Trautmann (in 1955) and Ray Wood (in 1957) suffering a broken neck and broken cheekbone respectively; while two wingers in successive years were stretchered off with broken legs (Roy Dwight in 1959 and Dave Whelan in 1960) and a full back left hobbling for three-quarters of the game with a damaged ankle (Len Chalmers in 1961). Byrne's injury was the latest to try to force the FA's hand and, eventually, two years later the first substitutes were allowed in the FA Cup final."]}, {"page": "Frank McLintock", "response": ["He was still struggling with his knee so missed the start of the 1960\u201361 season, but was returned to the starting line-up in September as City began to put a good set of results together, beating Manchester United 6\u20130, Arsenal home and away, and putting five goals past both West Ham United and Newcastle United. They went on to reach the 1961 FA Cup Final against Tottenham Hotspur at Wembley Stadium; the day before the final McLintock painted a cellar as part of his painting and decorating job. An injury sustained by Len Chalmers early in the game meant that McLintock was shifted from right-half to fill in at right-back, and ten-men Leicester fell to a 2\u20130 defeat. In the summer he qualified as a painter and decorator, and immediately quit his job to focus on full-time football.
