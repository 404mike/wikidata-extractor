Following an appeal from the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts in 1846, Woodcock and James Pollitt left for missionary service in Australia. In 1846 Coombs had just begun his church career as curate of St. Martin's-in-the-Fields, Trafalgar Square, London, when he was approached by the S.P.G. to follow them, as the Gawler church needed a minister. He was ordained deacon by Bishop Blomfield of London at St Paul's Cathedral. "]}]}}
