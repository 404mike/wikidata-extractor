Shallcross (1876 \u2013 1950) was an English association football manager who managed Stoke City between February 1919 and March 1923.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Stoke City F.C.", "response": ["|  Arthur Shallcross"]}, {"page": "Charlie Parker (footballer)", "response": ["Parker was born in Seaham and played for local clubs Seaham Albion, Seaham Harbour and Hartlepool BD before joining Stoke in 1913. He soon became popular with the club's supporters and he helped Stoke re-gain their League status in 1914\u201315. He remained with Stoke through World War I and was a key member of the Stoke squad for their return to the Football League in 1919\u201320 as the played in 35 matches. However, in October 1920 he was sold to First Division, Sunderland by manager Arthur Shallcross which prompted and angry reaction by the fans who believed that it was an unnecessary sale of a popular player."]}, {"page": "Tom Brittleton", "response": ["After looking set to re-join non-league Winsford United, Brittleton moved to Second Division Stoke. Brittleton family folklore has it that he actually signed for Winsford before moving almost immediately to Stoke and that the Cheshire club received a small transfer as part of the deal, however no records have been found to back up the claim. He joined Stoke at the age of 41 and many questioned as to Brittleton could still play a part in professional football. However, despite his advancing years he still commanded respect and was indeed able to play as through he was in his twenties. Due to his experience he was appointed player-coach at Stoke working alongside Arthur Shallcross. He helped Stoke gain promotion to the First Division in 1921\u201322 but Stoke struggled the following season and Shalcross was sacked. Jock Rutherford took over but soon left and Brittleton was given the opportunity to become manager but he rejected. Instead he carried on playing in the 1924\u201325 season playing in eight matches at the age of 45, a record not to be surpassed until Stanley Matthews."]}, {"page": "Joe Schofield", "response": ["He returned to Stoke as manager during World War I, and led the team in 1915\u201316, 1916\u201317, 1917\u201318, and 1918\u201319. The club competed in the Lancashire Section of the war league, and Stoke actually finished first in the Primary Competition in 1917\u201318, beating teams such as Manchester City, Manchester United, and Liverpool. However the competition was not considered to be competitive, and the games and achievements are not recognised by the Football League. Schofield did not take charge at Stoke for the return of league action in 1919\u201320, having been replaced by Arthur Shallcross."]}, {"page": "Billy Twemlow", "response": ["Twemlow played for Audley and Sandbach Ramblers, before he joined Stoke in 1915. He played for Stoke during World War I, featuring once in 1915\u201316, six times in 1916\u201317, 37 times in 1917\u201318, and 26 times in 1918\u201319. Having been a first time regular during the war, once League football was resumed in 1919 he was first choice full-back under manager Arthur Shallcross. In 1919\u201320 he played 34 times, scoring twice both penalties against Bristol City in November and Bury in February. However, he lost his place to the veteran Tom Brittleton and only played three matches in 1920\u201321 and was released from his contract at the Victoria Ground at the end of the campaign."]}]}}
