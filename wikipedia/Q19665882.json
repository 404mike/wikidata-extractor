His father, John, plied several trades and served as mayor of Kadina. He took his first art lessons in Adelaide and Sydney. The details are unknown, but he seems to have been greatly influenced by the realistic works of Henry James Johnstone. From 1894 to 1900, he lived in Kalgoorlie, where the cultural historian, Tim Bonyhady, says he was a minor artist who painted \"Aborigines and dead trees\". During that time, he paid his first extended visit to New Zealand. From 1900 to 1902, he was in Europe, where he was appointed a government representative; selecting works for inclusion at the Australian Federal International Exhibition, to be held at the Royal Exhibition Building. He eventually sent about 270 paintings to Australia. Upon his return, his own works were described as \"greatly improved\"."]}, {"page": "Townsend Duryea", "response": ["The Bourke Street business was taken over by Dr. Thomas A.

It was enough to land him a job as a colourist with Melbourne\u2019s leading firm of portrait photographers, Johnstone, O\u2019Shannessy & Co. Around the time he joined the firm, it advertised it had gained \"the additional assistance of a highly competent operator of extensive London and Parisian experience\", though it\u2019s unknown whether this was a reference to Curtis. He later described this period of his life as his \"business probation in Melbourne\".  Smith recorded that Curtis worked for the studio for eight or nine years and developed a friendship with co-owner Henry James Johnstone (1835-1907), an accomplished landscape artist as well as a portrait photographer. Certainly, Curtis and Johnstone would later often exhibit their work together, and served alongside each other for some years as council members of the Victorian Academy of Arts.Smith, An appreciation of the late James W.
