Rick Swan reviewed the adventure in The Space Gamer No. 72. He commented that there was \"so much gothic atmosphere in Ravenloft that if it had any more, it'd flap its pages and fly away\", and stated that the bulk of the adventure involving a search of Castle Ravenloft was \"not too interesting\" with encounters few and far between, and that the mechanic of using a regular deck of cards to simulate a gypsy fortune teller was \"silly and the results are too arbitrary\" but concluded that \"Ravenloft is such a refreshing change that even with its problems, it's recommended.\" In the July 1984 issue of White Dwarf magazine, the module was given 8 out of 10 overall, with the reviewer mentioning its presentation as a positive, and its complexity as a negative. It was likened to a Hammer horror production and praised as enjoyable, although the reviewer said the game's puns were tedious and detracted from the spooky atmosphere. White Dwarf reviewer Dave Morris said it \"should be a lot of fun \u2013 'light, relief' of a nerve-wracking and deadly sort\" and concluded that Ravenloft is \"full of clever touches\", and \"features some first-class illustration and graphics\". In a review for the January 1984 issue of Dragon magazine (published by a subsidiary of TSR), game designer Ken Rolston argued that, despite its design innovations, Ravenloft was still in essence a dungeon-style adventure. Rolston praised the randomization, the maps, and the player text (which is read aloud to the players by the DM). He said the player text \"consistently develops an atmosphere of darkness and decay.\" Despite this, Rolston felt that the adventure has trouble in developing a frightening tone. He singles out its use of common monsters in D&D, an abundance of traps, and frequent combat interludes as elements that detract from the adventure's spookiness by interrupting the module's flow. Ultimately, he felt that in \"AD&D terms it is a masterpiece\", but not a work of \"Gothic horror\". In a Polygon article from 2021, Charlie Hall wrote that the original Ravenloft \"has been criticized as derivative\u2013and for reinforcing harmful stereotypes,\" but that it had an interesting conflicted villain. Tracy Hickman stated in 1998, \"I still believe the original Ravenloft modules were perhaps the best that ever had my name on them.\" "]}, {"page": "Temple of Flame", "response": ["Temple of Flame is a gamebook by Dave Morris and Oliver Johnson from the Golden Dragon gamebook collection."]}, {"page": "Fabled Lands", "response": ["Fabled Lands is a series of fantasy gamebooks written by established gamebook authors Dave Morris and Jamie Thomson and published by Pan Books, a division of Macmillan in the mid 1990s.
