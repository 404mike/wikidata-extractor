At the Universidad del Salvador, a Jesuit university in Buenos Aires, he met H\u00e9ctor \"Zeta\" Bosio, also a marketing student. The two hit it off and decided to form a band. They were fans of The Police, The Beatles, XTC, Elvis Costello, Television, and The Talking Heads. In 1982, after various lineup changes that included Richard Coleman, Daniel Melero, and Andr\u00e9s Calamaro as well as others, Bosio and Cerati recruited Charly Alberti as their drummer, thus forming Soda Stereo.", "After working for much of 2005 on new material, Cerati released Ah\u00ed Vamos (\"There We Go\") in April 2006. Co-produced by longtime Soda Stereo collaborator Tweety Gonz\u00e1lez, Ah\u00ed Vamos marked Cerati's triumphant return to guitar rock. For the recording of Ah\u00ed Vamos, Cerati was accompanied by longtime collaborators, Richard Coleman, Fernando Nal\u00e9, and many others. The album was mixed by H\u00e9ctor Castillo, a prolific engineer whose credits include David Bowie, Lou Reed, and Aterciopelados, to name a few. The album was mastered by Howie Weinberg at Masterdisk in New York City. Ah\u00ed Vamos was lauded by fans and critics alike as a return to form for Cerati. The Ah\u00ed Vamos tour traveled through Latin America, the Caribbean, the United States (where he played in New York's Central Park), Spain, and on 12 October 2006, Cerati played London, England, for the first time in his career."]}, {"page": "Kenichi Ogata (voice actor)", "response": ["*She-Wolf of London (PC Leary (Richard Coleman))"]}, {"page": "2008 in film", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 16 || Richard Coleman || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 78 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| France || style=\"text-align:center;\"| Actor || "]}, {"page": "Gerald Flood", "response": ["(1982) He acted in the play \"Public Relations\", co-starring Richard Coleman."]}, {"page": "Weavers Green", "response": ["Cast: Eric Flynn, Megs Jenkins, Grant Taylor, Georgina Ward, Richard Coleman, Susan Field, Vanessa Forsyth, John Glyn-Jones, Maurice Kaufmann, Marjie Lawrence, John Moulder Brown, Pat Nye, Kate O'Mara, Wendy Richard, Gerald Young, Brian Cant, Edward Underdown, Susan George."]}, {"page": "List of alumni of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art", "response": ["*Richard Coleman (Acting Diploma 1953)"]}, {"page": "Soda Stereo", "response": ["After the band's separation, all three of its members found separate endeavoursGustavo Cerati continued a successful solo career after the band's split, releasing five studio albums (most of which achieved Platinum and Gold status in Argentina, while Zeta Bosio worked for a time as bassist for several underground groups and is now touring as a DJ; Charly Alberti has also found moderate success, both with the foundation of his CybeRelations company, and his family band MOLE.
