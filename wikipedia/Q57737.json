Biddiss, a contributor to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, as a \"racialist writer\". Chamberlain married Eva von B\u00fclow, the daughter of composer Richard Wagner, in December 1908, twenty-five years after Wagner's death.Chamberlain's best known book is the two-volume Die Grundlagen des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts (The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century), published in 1899, which became highly influential in the pan-Germanic V\u00f6lkisch movements of the early 20th century and later influenced the antisemitism of Nazi racial policy.  Indeed, Chamberlain has been referred to as \"Hitler's John the Baptist\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Friedrich Nietzsche", "response": ["\"'Landsberg,' Hitler told Hans Frank, was his 'university paid for by the state.' He read, he said, everything he could get hold of: Nietzsche, Houston Stewart Chamberlain, Ranke, Treitschke, Marx, Bismarck's Thoughts and Memories, and the war memoirs of German and allied generals and statesmen.... But Hitler's reading and reflection were anything but academic, doubtless, he did read much. However, as was noted in an earlier chapter, he made clear in My Struggle that reading for him had purely an instrumental purpose. He read not for knowledge or enlightenment, but for confirmation of his own preconceptions.\"Weaver Santaniello, Nietzsche, God, and the Jews, SUNY Press, 1994, p. 41: \"Hitler probably never read a word of Nietzsche.\"Berel Lang, Post-Holocaust: Interpretation, Misinterpretation, and the Claims of History, Indiana University Press, 2005, p. 162: \"Arguably, Hitler himself never read a word of Nietzsche; certainly, if he did read him, it was not extensively.\" He was a frequent visitor to the Nietzsche museum in Weimar and used expressions of Nietzsche's, such as \"lords of the earth\" in Mein Kampf.William L.

Newton read Nietzsche. Richard Nixon read Nietzsche with \"curious interest\", and his book Beyond Peace might have taken its title from Nietzsche's book Beyond Good and Evil which Nixon read beforehand. Bertrand Russell wrote that Nietzsche had exerted great influence on philosophers and on people of literary and artistic culture, but warned that the attempt to put Nietzsche's philosophy of aristocracy into practice could only be done by an organization similar to the Fascist or the Nazi party."]}, {"page": "Joseph Goebbels", "response": ["He continued for several years to try to become a published author. His diaries, which he began in 1923 and continued for the rest of his life, provided an outlet for his desire to write. The lack of income from his literary works (he wrote two plays in 1923, neither of which sold) forced him to take employment as a caller on the stock exchange and as a bank clerk in Cologne, a job he detested. He was dismissed from the bank in August 1923 and returned to Rheydt. During this period, he read avidly and was influenced by the works of Oswald Spengler, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, and Houston Stewart Chamberlain, the British-born German writer whose book The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century (1899) was one of the standard works of the extreme right in Germany. He also began to study the \"social question\" and read the works of Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Rosa Luxemburg, August Bebel and Gustav Noske. According to German historian Peter Longerich, Goebbels's diary entries from late 1923 to early 1924 reflected the writings of a man who was isolated, preoccupied with \"religious-philosophical\" issues, and lacked a sense of direction. Diary entries of mid-December 1923 forward show Goebbels was moving towards the V\u00f6lkisch nationalist movement."]}, {"page": "January 9", "response": ["*1927 \u2013 Houston Stewart Chamberlain, English-German philosopher and author (b. 1855)"]}, {"page": "Richard Wagner", "response": ["Adolf Hitler was an admirer of Wagner's music and saw in his operas an embodiment of his own vision of the German nation; in a 1922 speech he claimed that Wagner's works glorified \"the heroic Teutonic nature\u00a0...

There continues to be debate about the extent to which Wagner's views might have influenced Nazi thinking.

(New York: Macmillan, 1921), Ch. 20 (\"The Aryan-Speaking Peoples in Prehistoric Times\"), pp. 236-51. In that influential volume, Wells used the term in the plural (\"the Aryan peoples\"), but he was a staunch opponent of the racist and politically motivated exploitation of the singular term (\"the Aryan people\") by earlier authors like Houston Stewart Chamberlain and was careful either to avoid the generic singular, though he did refer now and again in the singular to some specific \"Aryan people\" (e.g., the Scythians). In 1922, in A Short History of the World, Wells depicted a highly diverse group of various \"Aryan peoples\" learning \"methods of civilization\" and then, by means of different uncoordinated movements that Wells believed were part of a larger dialectical rhythm of conflict between settled civilizations and nomadic invaders that also encompassed Aegean and Mongol peoples inter alia, \"subjugat[ing]\" \u2013 \"in form\" but not in \"ideas and methods\" \u2013 \"the whole ancient world, Semitic, Aegean and Egyptian alike\"."]}]}}
