Phylakopi was first founded on bedrock. The initial city was overlain by a second, and that by a third, hence Phylakopi I, II, III. The pottery section of the report was written by Campbell Cowan Edgar. By the time he finished writing in 1904, Evans was already at Knossos, and his topic was obsolete.
