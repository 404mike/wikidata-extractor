Brady (May 18, 1822(?) \u2013 January 15, 1896), the son of Irish immigrants, was born in Warren County, New York. Brady would spend his fortune to accumulate photos of the war. In the early 1840s, Brady was a manufacturer of \"jewel cases\" for daguerreotypes in New York City. By 1844 he had opened his own daguerreian gallery at 205 Broadway, the \"New-York Daguerreian Miniature Gallery\", having with Edward Anthony in 1840 received instruction from Prof. Samuel B. Morse for a fee of $50. Still in his 20s, Brady's next goal was to establish at his hall of fame, a Gallery of Illustrious Americans. \"From the first, I regarded myself as under obligation to my country to preserve the faces of its historic men and mothers.\" Brady returned to New York in May 1852 after a long absence in Europe. While there he sought treatments for an undisclosed illness (mercury poisoning?). In 1856, seeing the tremendous potential for reproducible, enlarged prints and their purpose for the illustrated newspapers, Brady hired photographer and businessman, Alexander Gardner for his Washington City studio.D.

He became an apprentice silversmith jeweller at the age of fourteen. Soon, Gardner found out that his interests and talents lay in finance and journalism. When he was twenty-one he left the jeweler's shop for a job on the Glasgow Sentinel as a reporter.  After only a year of reporting he was appointed editor of the Sentinel. A love of chemistry soon led him to experiment with photography. Deeply disturbed by the exploitation of the working class, and in the spirit of the early cooperative movements in Scotland, Gardner organized a utopian venture in the US called the \"Clydesdale Joint Stock Agricultural and Commercial Company\" in Iowa, however by 1853 many at the Iowa colony were sick and dying of tuberculosis (then called \"consumption\") and the Clydesdale company was dissolved. In 1856, Alex, his brother James and seven others, including Alex's wife, Margaret (1824\u2013?), his son Lawrence (1848\u2013?), his daughter Eliza (1850\u2013?) and his mother Jane, immigrated to the United States. Colleague James Gibson may have been one of the party. Alex sought out the renown Mathew Brady for employment, who hired him to manage the Washington City studio. Gardner's business acumen and expertise at wet-plate photography and particularly the \"Imperial Print\", a 17 by 21 inch enlargement, brought Brady enormous success. With some reluctance, Brady agreed to let Gardner negotiate with Anthony Co. publishing of the increasingly popular 2-inch X 3.5-inch \"carte-de-visite\", or visiting card.", "By May 1863, Gardner had opened his own studio in Washington City with his brother James, taking with him many of Mathew Brady's former staff. Circumstantial evidence suggests that Gardner's split with Brady was not caused by any altruistic concerns over the proper citation in published works. Gardner himself in 1867 acknowledged in a deposition that though a photograph be identified on the mount as a \"Photograph by A. Gardner\" for example, it simply meant that it was printed or copied in his gallery, and he was not necessarily the photographer.D. Mark Katz, \"Witness to an Era. The Life and Photographs of Alexander Gardner\", Viking, New York, 1991, pg. 220 The split seems more likely to have grown out of Brady's incompetent business practices and his failure to regularly meet his payroll.", "In 1875, the civic-minded Gardner worked at the Washington City Metropolitan Police Department, copying nearly a thousand daguerreotypes to be used as \"mug shots\", the forerunner of the \"Rogues Gallery.\"D.

Thomas W. Sherman's Port Royal, S.C. operations. In July 1862, O'Sullivan followed the campaign of Gen. John Pope in Virginia. In July 1863, he reached the pinnacle of his career when he took pictures at Gettysburg, PA., most notably, \"The Harvest of Death\". In 1864, following Gen. Grant's trail, he photographed during the Siege of Petersburg and the siege of Fort Fisher. That brought him to Appomattox Court House in April 1865, and back to Petersburg in May.

Gibson (1828/29\u2013?), perhaps the least recognized of the war's most significant photographers was also one of the least known. In 1860, Scotsman Gibson's name appeared with that of his wife Elizabeth in the Washington D.C. census, and the city directory showed that Mathew Brady employed him. Gibson may have emigrated to America with Alexander Gardner, who was also from Scotland. Gibson's first documented trip into the field was when he accompanied George N. Barnard to the Bull Run battlefield in March 1862. He worked with Gardner at Gettysburg and partnered with him at Sharpsburg, but Gibson's own greatest legacy was the wide array of photographs he took while on the Virginia peninsula,\"The Blue & Gray In Black & White\", Bob Zeller 2005, pg. 66. in particular his poignant, landmark photo of the wounded at Savage Station, Virginia. Several years after the war, before a court could rule on Gibson's 1868 civil suit against business partner, Mathew Brady (Gibson also sued Gardner\"Alexander Gardner\", by Josephine Cobb \u2013 IMAGE, JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAPHY AND MOTION PICTURES OF THE GEORGE EASTMAN HOUSE, VOL. 7, NO. 6 JUNE 1958), he heavily mortgaged Brady's failing Washington Gallery, which he partly owned (50%) and managed from Sept. 1864, left for Kansas with the cash, and was never heard from again.\"Brady's Civil War\", Webb Garrison, 2008", "John Reekie (1829\u20131885) was another little known Civil War photographer.

Reekie's probably best known for his scenes of the unburied dead, on the battlefields of Gaines' Mill and Cold Harbor. One of his most well-known, \"A Burial Party, Cold Harbor,\" was included with six others of his negatives in Gardner's Photographic Sketch Book of the War. It depicts African American soldiers gathering human remains on the Cold Harbor battlefield, almost a year after the battle.

Woodbury (1839\u20131879) was arguably the best of the artists who stayed with Brady through the war. In March 1862, Mathew Brady sent Woodbury and Edward Whitney out to photograph the 1st Bull Run battlefield, and in May, views of the Peninsula Campaign. In July 1863, Woodbury and Anthony Berger photographed the Gettysburg battlefield for Brady, returning on November 19 to take \"pictures of the crowd and Procession\" (Nov. 23, 1863 letter to sister Eliza). In the summer of 1864, Woodbury photographed Grant's Headquarters Command for Brady, who had replaced Alexander Gardner as official photographer.\"Blue and Gray in Black and White\", Zeller, Bob, 2005, pg. 144 On April 24, Woodbury assisted J.F.

In 1849, with wife Jane older brother John and John's wife Elizabeth, machinist Knox emigrated to America, taking a machinist job in New Haven, Connecticut. Knox became a naturalized citizen on March 22, 1855, just five years after the tragic deaths of 28 year-old Jane and his 7-week-old son David. In 1856, David moved to Springfield, Ill., taking a job as a machinist for the Great Western Railroad. His home was just one block from the residence of Abraham Lincoln. Soon after, Knox relocated his family to Washington D.C. The first reference to Knox working at the Mathew B. Brady studio is a September 21, 1862 telegram sent from the Antietam battlefield by Alexander Gardner, addressed to \"David Knox Brady Gallery\", Washington. Knox was likely trained there by Gardner in the use of a large format camera. Historians don't know exactly when Knox left Brady's employ to Join Alexander Gardner's new competing firm. Returns for the June\u2013July 1863 Draft Registration show Knox as a 42-year-old photographer, very near Gardner's gallery. Four of Knox's wartime negatives were included in \"Gardner's Photographic Sketch Book of the War.\"[49]  He is probably best known for his iconic plate, \"13 inch mortar Dictator, in front of Petersburg, Va.\" Like his colleagues John Reekie and the Gardner brothers, Knox was an officer of the Washington D.C. Saint Andrews Society, a Scottish relief organization.[50]  On May 7\u201310, 1868 the Crow, Northern Cheyenne and Northern Arapaho, signed treaties at Fort Laramie, Dakota Territory which were attested to by \"Alex. Gardner\" and \"David Knox\" establishing that Knox was engaged there in picture taking with Gardner. In 1870 David Knox and his wife Marion moved to Omaha, Nebraska, where he had apparently finished with photography to pursue regular employment as a machinist.

David passed on November 24, 1895 and is buried with Marion at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, in Omaha, Nebraska.", "William Redish Pywell (1843\u20131887) worked for both Mathew Brady and Alexander Gardner. Pywell's photographs are an important and integral part of the historic photographic record of the American Civil War. Three fine negatives are credited to Pywell in Gardner's Photographic Sketch Book of the War. Pywell was busy in both the Western Theatre as well as in the East, but is probably best remembered for his early photographs of the slave pens of Alexandria, Va.", "Between September and October 1867, Pywell assisted Alexander Gardner during the \"Kansas Pacific Railway Survey\" across the 39th parallel, from Wyandotte, Kansas to Fort Wallace in western Kansas. The result would be Gardner's folio sized album Across the Continent on the Union Pacific Railway, Eastern Division.

Stanley, with Lieutenant Colonel George A. Custer as second in command.", "William Frank Browne (?\u20131867)  was born in Northfield, Vermont. At the outset of war, Browne enlisted in Company C of the 15th Vermont Infantry at Berlin, Vermont. After the end of his two-year enlistment, Brown began working as a freelance camp photographer for the 5th Michigan Cavalry, part of George A. Custer's Michigan brigade. Browne wintered with them in their encampment at Stevensburg, Virginia while taking some of the earliest photographs of Brigadier General Custer. In 1864\u201365 Browne began doing contract work for Alexander Gardner. In May 1865, Maj. General Henry H. Abbot assigned Browne to photograph the James River water batteries around Richmond, Va., thus \"preserving an invaluable record of their wonderful completeness.\" After the war, Gardner published 120 of Browne's negatives as \"View of Confederate Water Batteries on the James River.\" Browne returned to his native Northfield, Vermont, where he died of consumption (tuberculosis) in 1867.", "Isaac Griffith (1833\u20131913) and Charles John (1838\u20131906) Tyson.\"Early Photography at Gettysburg\", William A.

From November 1861 through April 1862, O'Sullivan, working for Gardner, followed Union forces to Fort Walker, Fort Beauregard, Beaufort, Hilton Head, and Fort Pulaski."]}, {"page": "George Eastman Museum", "response": ["The museum's original collections included the Medicus collection of Civil War photographs by Alexander Gardner, Eastman Kodak Company's historical collection, and the massive Gabriel Cromer collection of nineteenth-century French photography.
