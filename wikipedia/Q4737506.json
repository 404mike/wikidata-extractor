In 2002, a Welsh Assembly Member Alun Pugh wrote to BBC Director-General Greg Dyke to complain about Clarkson's comments that he believed encouraged people to use Welsh roads as a high-speed test track. A BBC spokesman said that suggestions Clarkson had encouraged speeding were \"nonsense\". Clarkson has also made similar comments about driving in Lincolnshire.MSN.com News  Jeremy Clarkson in new road safety row, 27 October 2005 In a November 2005 Times article, Clarkson wrote on the Bugatti Veyron, \"On a recent drive across Europe I desperately wanted to reach the top speed but I ran out of road when the needle hit 240 mph,\" and \"From the wheel of a Veyron, France is the size of a small coconut. I cannot tell you how fast I crossed it the other day. Because you simply wouldn't believe me.\" In 2007, solicitor Nick Freeman represented Clarkson against a charge of driving at 86\u00a0mph in a 50\u00a0mph zone on the A40 road in London, defeating it on the basis that the driver of the car loaned to Clarkson from Alfa Romeo could not be ascertained. In 2008, Clarkson claimed in a talk at the Hay Festival to have been given a speeding ticket for driving at 186\u00a0mph on the A1203 Limehouse Link road in London.BBC News Clarkson's speed claim criticised, 28 May 2008"]}, {"page": "2003 National Assembly for Wales election", "response": ["| Alun Pugh"]}, {"page": "Gareth Thomas (Welsh politician)", "response": ["He unsuccessfully sought the nomination for Clwyd West seat in the inaugural Assembly elections losing out to Alun Pugh."]}, {"page": "Llwynypia", "response": ["*Alun Pugh \u2013 former member of the Welsh Assembly, and former Minister for Culture, Welsh Language and Sport"]}, {"page": "Eleanor Burnham", "response": ["Burnham succeeded as Liberal Democrat AM for North Wales on 22 March 2001 after Christine Humphreys had resigned because of ill-health.
