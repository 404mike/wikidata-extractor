Lieth was killed, but Bonnie survived with serious injuries and was able to summon aid. Lieth was stepfather to Bonnie's two children from her previous marriage, Christopher (usually known as Chris) and Angela Pritchard. Angela Pritchard, whose bedroom was in another part of the house, told police she slept through the attack. At the time of the murder, Chris Pritchard was living in a student residence at North Carolina State University.", "When it was discovered that Lieth's estate was worth two million dollars, Bonnie Von Stein and her  children, Chris and Angela, became suspects. The police investigation eventually focused on Chris Pritchard. A breakthrough came when Pritchard's college friend  Neal Henderson confessed to investigators that he (Henderson) had driven another friend, James \"Bart\" Upchurch, to and from the scene of the murder at the instigation of Pritchard, who had promised to use his projected inheritance money to reward Upchurch and Henderson if his mother and stepfather were killed. In June 1989, nearly a year after the attack, Pritchard, Henderson, and Upchurch (all born 1968) were all arrested and charged with the crime.", "The trial took place in January 1990. Chris Pritchard, who (subsequent to his arrest) admitted to masterminding the murder conspiracy, and Neal Henderson, who said his role was that of James Upchurch's lookout and getaway driver,  pleaded guilty to reduced charges as part of a plea bargain whereby they both testified against Upchurch."]}, {"page": "Eckington School", "response": ["* Chris Pritchard 1999, Represented Scotland at 2010 Commonwealth Games Track Cycling"]}, {"page": "Scotland at the 2010 Commonwealth Games", "response": ["Chris Pritchard, Callum Skinner, Kevin Stewart"]}, {"page": "Cycling at the 2010 Commonwealth Games \u2013 Men's team sprint", "response": ["| John PaulChris PritchardCallum Skinner"]}, {"page": "Scotland at the 2014 Commonwealth Games", "response": ["|align=left|Chris Pritchard", "|align=left|Chris Pritchard", "|align=left|Jonny BigginChris PritchardCallum Skinner"]}, {"page": "Cycling at the 2014 Commonwealth Games \u2013 Men's team sprint", "response": ["| Jonny BigginChris PritchardCallum Skinner"]}, {"page": "Pritchard (surname)", "response": ["*Chris Pritchard (cyclist) (born 1983), Scottish Cyclist", "*Chris Pritchard (born 1968), American murderer"]}, {"page": "British National Keirin Championships", "response": ["| 2010 || Ross Edgar || Jason Kenny|| Chris Pritchard"]}, {"page": "2010 British National Track Championships", "response": ["|Chris Pritchard"]}]}}
