He commanded the whaler and sealing vessel Britannia and the naval store ship HMS Buffalo in Australian and New Zealand waters from 1792 until 1799. While in command of Britannia under contract to the British East India Company, he mapped the Loyalty Islands of Mar\u00e9, Lifou, Tiga and  Ouv\u00e9a between August 1793 and May 1796.Raven was granted 100 acres (40 ha) of land in the vicinity of Tennyson Point, New South Wales in 1795, plus another 285 acres (115 ha) in 1799. The grant was known as Grove Farm.  These Eastern Farms, now Kissing Point, properties were managed for him by the brewer James Squire of Kissing Point until Squire's death in 1822. The tip of the peninsula into the Parramatta River at Tennyson Point is now called Raven Point.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "New Caledonia", "response": ["British explorer James Cook was the first European to sight New Caledonia, on 4 September 1774, during his second voyage. He named it \"New Caledonia\", as the northeast of the island reminded him of Scotland. The west coast of Grande Terre was approached by the Comte de Lap\u00e9rouse in 1788, shortly before his disappearance, and the Loyalty Islands were first visited between 1793 and 1796 when Mare, Lifou, Tiga, and Ouvea were mapped by English whaler William Raven. Raven encountered the island, then named Britania, and today known as Mar\u00e9 (Loyalty Is.), in November 1793. From 1796 until 1840, only a few sporadic contacts with the archipelago were recorded. About 50 American whalers (identified by Robert Langdon from their log books) have been recorded in the region (Grande Terre, Loyalty Is., Walpole and Hunter) between 1793 and 1887. Contacts with visiting ships became more frequent after 1840, because of their interest in sandalwood."]}, {"page": "Raoul Island", "response": ["The island was uninhabited when first sighted by Western sailors and was named after Joseph Raoul, quartermaster of the Recherche, when it was sighted on 16 March 1793.

Following this, in January 1803, George Bass asked Governor King of New South Wales for a fishing monopoly, from a line bisecting New Zealand from Dusky Sound to Otago Harbour extending south to include the subantarctic Islands. It was not granted, but it indicates the sealers' area of interest and Dusky Sound's place in it.Robert McNab (ed), Historical Records of New Zealand, 2 vols, Wellington, NZ: Government Printer, 1908 & 1914.
