On 10 May 1882 he joined the 3rd King's Own Hussars and served for six years with the rank of lieutenant. He resigned from the army to start a stud farm at Greenfields, County Tipperary. He was the director of the Autostrop Safety Razor Company, a competitor of Gillette.He collected rare orchids and was interested in gardening and natural history, but his introduction to the British Isles of exotic plants and insects was denounced by naturalists.Bagwell-Purefoy is chiefly remembered as one of a group of five gamblers who formed the Druid\u2019s Lodge confederacy. The gamblers owned Hackler's Pride, winner of the Cambridgeshire Handicap in 1903 and again in 1904, yielding them a spectacular payoff.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Old Harrovians", "response": ["*Wilfred Bagwell Purefoy (1862\u20131930), British racehorse breeder"]}, {"page": "Aboyeur", "response": ["As a foal, Aboyeur was sold by his breeder to J. Daly, who sold him a year later for \u00a32,200 as part of a group of three yearlings to Alan Cunliffe, the leader of a group of heavy gamblers known as the Druid\u2019s Lodge confederacy.  The name came from the Druid's Lodge stable near Salisbury, Wiltshire, where their horses, including Aboyeur, were trained in conditions of secrecy by Tom Lewis. The name \"Aboyeur\" derives from a French word meaning \"barker\" or \"heckler\"; it can also refer to a person in a kitchen who shouts out orders. The member of the gambling confederacy who provided most of the financing was Wilfred Bagwell Purefoy."]}]}}
