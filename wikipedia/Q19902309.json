His great-grandfather was Thomas Smith, founder of Smith's Bank;\nhis father George Smith (1765\u20131836) was a director of the East India Company.\nHis uncle Lord Carrington was patron of the pocket borough of Midhurst in Sussex, for which his father was a Member of Parliament (MP) from 1830 to 1831. George Robert was returned as MP at the 1831 general election, but the Reform Act abolished most of the family's pocket boroughs, and Smith was left without a seat at the 1832 general election.He contested Buckinghamshire at the 1837 general election, but without success. The following year his cousin Robert Carrington succeeded to the peerage, and George Robert was elected in his place as one of the two MPs for Wycombe. He held the seat only until the next general election, in 1841, having apparently fallen out with his conservative cousin.Smith was a director of Smith's Bank in Derby from 1837 to 1843, and of the London Smith's from 1850. In 1847 he served on the committee of the British Relief Association.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Smith", "response": ["*George Robert Smith (MP) (1793\u20131869), English MP for Midhurst 1831\u20132 and Wycombe 1838\u201341", "*George Robert Smith (Canadian politician) (1860\u20131922), Canadian politician"]}, {"page": "List of political families in the United Kingdom", "response": ["****** George Robert Smith (1793\u20131863), MP 1831-32 1838\u201341.

Successful at first, by 1832 this business had also foundered as a result of a price war with the other Scottish banks and some large bad overseas debts.
