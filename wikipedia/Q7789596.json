His parents were Hubert Somerset Firbank, a railway contractor born in 1887 in Chiselhurst, Kent (to Sir Joseph Thomas Firbank) and Gwendoline Louise Lewis (who were married in 1909 in Dolgellau, Merionethshire, Wales). Following his father's early death, he was raised among his mother's hill-farming community in the Berwyn Mountains of North Wales. He was educated at Stowe School.", "The book ends with pastoral calm interrupted by the ominous drumbeats of the Second World War which drew Thomas Firbank away from his beloved farm to enlist in the Coldstream Guards. He was later seconded to the newly formed Airborne Forces with whom he fought in North Africa, Italy and Arnhem, and was awarded the Military Cross. At the end of the war, as Lieutenant-Colonel, he commanded the Airborne Forces Depot on the Isle of Wight. His book I Bought a Star, (, pub. 1951) describes his war-time experiences with the 1st Airborne Division."]}, {"page": "Joseph Thomas Firbank", "response": ["#REDIRECT Thomas Firbank (politician)"]}, {"page": "Thomas Firbank (MP)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Thomas Firbank (politician)"]}, {"page": "List of Knights Bachelor appointed in 1902", "response": ["|Joseph Thomas Firbank, MP"]}]}}
