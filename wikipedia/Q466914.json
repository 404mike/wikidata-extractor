He served in the Second Anglo-Sikh War, the campaign against the Kohat Pass Afridis, the suppression of the Santhal rebellion, and the suppression of the Indian Mutiny. He became military member of the Viceroy's Council (in effect Minister for War in India) in 1870, in which role he maintained the policy of ensuring that the Indian Army were less well armed than British troops there to deter another mutiny. As a result, he became a member of the Council of India; and in his later years he became Governor of Jamaica and then Governor of Queensland.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Agent-general", "response": ["| Sir Henry Wylie Norman || 1896\u20131897"]}, {"page": "1892 in Australia", "response": ["*Governor of Queensland \u2013 Henry Wylie Norman "]}, {"page": "1891 in Australia", "response": ["*Governor of Queensland \u2013 Henry Wylie Norman "]}, {"page": "1893 in Australia", "response": ["*Governor of Queensland \u2013 Henry Wylie Norman "]}, {"page": "1894 in Australia", "response": ["*Governor of Queensland \u2013 Henry Wylie Norman "]}, {"page": "1895 in Australia", "response": ["*Governor of Queensland \u2013 Henry Wylie Norman until 31 December"]}, {"page": "List of governors of Jamaica", "response": ["* Sir Henry Wylie Norman, 1883\u20131889"]}, {"page": "Norman Park, Queensland", "response": ["Norman Park is likely named after an early estate in the area.

In September 1890, a college was opened in connection with the school, known as University College. The site at Old Hope Road was also the tropical outpost of the University of London. It was therefore decided that the purpose of the school would be to give secondary preparation to potential students of the University of London who happened to reside in Jamaica. The name revision reflected this change, which became the school's second purpose. Until 1902 there were two separate names for the school's units. Subsequently, Jamaica High School and University College were amalgamated under the name Jamaica College. Therefore, during its history, the school has changed both name and location four times."]}, {"page": "2nd Queen Victoria's Own Rajput Light Infantry", "response": ["*Field Marshal Sir Henry Wylie Norman"]}, {"page": "1890 in Australia", "response": ["*Governor of Queensland \u2013 Henry Wylie Norman "]}, {"page": "1889 in Australia", "response": ["*Governor of Queensland \u2013 Henry Wylie Norman "]}, {"page": "All Hallows' School", "response": ["St Ann's Industrial School was opened on 15 July 1894 by the Governor of Queensland Henry Wylie Norman.
