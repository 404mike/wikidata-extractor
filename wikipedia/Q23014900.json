This can occur when the soil is saturated by water to its full capacity, and that the rain arrives more quickly than the soil can absorb it. Surface runoff often occurs because impervious areas (such as roofs and pavement) do not allow water to soak into the ground. Furthermore, runoff can occur either through natural or man-made processes. Surface runoff is a major component of the water cycle. It is the primary agent of soil erosion by water.Ronnie Wilson, The Horton Papers (1933)Keith Beven, Robert E.

The method was introduced by Keith Beven and Andrew Binley in 1992. The basic idea of GLUE is that given our inability to represent exactly in a mathematical model how nature works, there will always be several different models that mimic equally well an observed natural process (such as river discharge). Such equally acceptable or behavioral models are therefore called equifinal."]}, {"page": "Lancaster Environment Centre", "response": ["*Emeritus Professor Keith Beven is the most highly cited hydrologist in the world."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society A, B, C", "response": ["| Keith Beven||05/05/2017||23 July 1950 \u2013"]}, {"page": "Template talk:Who's Who", "response": [": Hello  I've added digital object identifiers as a parameter to this template, although sadly, many of these new DOIs appear to be broken.
