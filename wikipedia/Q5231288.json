The main seven storey block that faces the Ashton Canal was used for spinning. The preparation was done on the second floor and the self-acting mules with 400 spindles were arranged transversely on the floors above. The wings contained the blowing rooms, some spinning and ancillary processes like winding. The four storey range facing Bradford Road was used for warehousing and offices. The mill was built by David Bellhouse, but it is suspected that William Fairbairn was involved in the design. It is built from brick, and has slate roofs. Fireproof internal construction was now standard. Brunswick was built using cast iron columns and beams, each floor was vaulted with transverse brick arches. There was no wood in the structure. It was powered by a large double beam engine."]}, {"page": "King Street, Manchester", "response": ["Manchester's original civic administration (a commission of police) was housed in the Police Office in King Street from 1772; it was near the junction with Deansgate and Police Street is so called because of it.Bradshaw, L.

The Town Hall, also located in King Street at the corner of Cross Street, was designed by Francis Goodwin and constructed during 1822\u201325, much of it by David Bellhouse. The building was designed in the Grecian style and Goodwin was strongly influenced by his patron John Soane. As the size and wealth of the city grew, largely as a result of the textile industry, its administration outstripped the existing facilities and a new building was proposed. The King Street building was subsequently occupied by a public library and then Lloyds Bank. The facade was removed to Heaton Park in 1912, when the current Lloyds TSB building was erected on the site (No 53 King Street)."]}, {"page": "The Portico Library", "response": ["The library, mainly focused on 19th-century literature, was designed by Thomas Harrison, architect of Liverpool's Lyceum and built by one of the founders, David Bellhouse.

After some haggling over the price of land and other matters, a report of actual construction was presented on 30 October 1846. However work was then suspended as the company had run out of money. A public offering of five-year bonds at 5% per annum raised only \u00a350,000 so a further Act of Parliament (passed on 22 July 1848) was required to increase the capital by \u00a3250,000 to \u00a3650,000. The two owning companies each provided half of this amount. On 20 January 1849, a viaduct near Oxford Road collapsed as the scaffolding was removed. Three men died and two were injured. Five days later the two adjacent arches failed without injury. The accepted reason was slow setting of the mortar in wet weather.Dixon pp 12\u201313"]}, {"page": "Holbrook Gaskell", "response": ["Gaskell married Frances Ann Bellhouse in 1841, who was the daughter of Henry Bellhouse of Manchester and niece of David Bellhouse, the Manchester builder Nasmyth and Gaskell had contracted during the initial building of the Patricroft site.
