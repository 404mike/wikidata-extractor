She was one of the earliest celebrity chefs (a term that she disliked at first) who became known during World War II thanks to her programme on BBC Radio, where she shared recipes that could work within the limits imposed by war rationing. After the war, she was responsible for popularising the use of pressure cookers and her 170 published books have sold over 17 million copies.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "November 4", "response": ["* 1915 \u2013 Marguerite Patten, English economist and author (d. 2015)"]}, {"page": "English cuisine", "response": ["Rationing was introduced in 1940 to cope with the shortages caused by the wartime blockade. Foods such as bananas, onions and chocolate became hard to find, while unfamiliar items such as dried egg, dried potato, whale meat, snook (a South African fish), and the tinned pork product Spam appeared in the national diet. Since butter, sugar, eggs and flour were all rationed, English dishes such as pies and cakes became hard to make from traditional recipes. Instead, foods such as carrots were used in many different dishes, their natural sugars providing sweetness in novel dishes like carrot fudge. The diet was less than enjoyable, but paradoxically, rationing meant that the population was healthier than ever before, and perhaps ever since. The Ministry of Food employed home economists such as Marguerite Patten to demonstrate how to cook economically. After the war, Patten became one of the first television cooks, and sold 17 million copies of her 170 books."]}, {"page": "Fanny Cradock", "response": ["Marguerite Patten has described Fanny Cradock as the saviour of British cooking after the war. Brian Turner has said that he respects Fanny's career and Delia Smith has attributed her own career to early inspirations taken from the Cradocks' television programmes. In a 2008 interview with The Daily Star, singer Amy Winehouse said that she discovered a love of cookery after reading Cradock's books. Others are less complimentary. The BBC series The Way We Cooked featured an episode dedicated to Cradock, in which Graham Kerr, Keith Floyd and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, amongst others, disparaged her methods and cooking skill.Episode Guide: The Way We Cooked, BBC Two In the third series of The F Word, Gordon Ramsay held a series-long search for a new Fanny Cradock."]}, {"page": "Blue Peter", "response": ["Blue Peter content is wide-ranging. Most programmes are broadcast live, but usually include at least one filmed report. There will also often be a demonstration of an activity in the studio, or a music or dance performance. Between the 1960s and 2011 the programme was made at BBC Television Centre, and often came from Studio 1, the fourth-largest TV studio in Britain and one of the largest in Europe. This enabled Blue Peter to include large-scale demonstrations and performances within the live programme. From the September 2007 series, the programme was broadcast from a small fixed set in Studio 2. However, from 2009 the series began to use the larger studios once more; also more programmes were broadcast in their entirety from the Blue Peter Garden. The show is also famous for its \"makes\", which are demonstrations of how to construct a useful object or prepare food. These have given rise to the oft-used phrase \"Here's one I made earlier\", as presenters bring out a perfect and completed version of the object they are making\u00a0\u2013 a phrase credited to Christopher Trace, though Marguerite Patten is another possibility. Trace also used the line \"And now for something completely different\", which was later taken up by Monty Python.Alistair McGown, 'Trace, Christopher Leonard (1933\u20131992)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, online edn, Oxford University Press, October 2005; online edn, October 2008 accessed 29 June 2009 Time is also often given over to reading letters and showing pictures sent in by viewers."]}]}}
