North (born 1946), is a UK conservative commentator. He worked for The Independent newspaper as its first environment correspondent (1986\u20131990) and then as environmental columnist for The Sunday Times (1990\u20131992). His book, Life On a Modern Planet: A manifesto for progress (Manchester University Press, 1995) was widely regarded as a renunciation of his green ideals. He now works with the free-market thinktank, the Institute of Economic Affairs (as media fellow) and with the conservative Social Affairs Unit, where he blogs on art, film and social issues.\nThe Social Affairs Unit has published North's Rich Is Beautiful: A very personal defence of Mass Affluence (2005), Mr Blair's Messiah Politics: Or what happened when Bambi tried to save the world (2006) and 'Scrap the BBC!': Ten years to set broadcasters free (2007).In 2012, North published a 650-entry, interactive eBook entitled The Right-wing Guide to Nearly Everything.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Leonard Cheshire", "response": ["*Sue Ryder of Cavendish \u2013 Richard D.
