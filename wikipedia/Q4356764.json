Their music is best known for its merging of dissonant guitar textures, androgynous vocals, and unorthodox production techniques. They helped to pioneer the alternative rock subgenre known as shoegaze during the late 1980s and early 1990s.", "Conway's departure left the band without a lead vocalist, and Shields, \u00d3 C\u00edos\u00f3ig and Googe advertised in the local music press for a new singer. The audition process, which Shields described as \"disastrous and excruciating,\" was unsuccessful because he had mentioned the Smiths in the advertisements \"because [he] liked their melodies,\" attracting a number of vocalists whom he called \"fruitballs.\" Although considering forming another group, the band experimented with vocalists Bilinda Butcher and Joe Byfield, both of whom had been recommended to the band by other musicians. Butcher, whose musical experience consisted of playing classical guitar as a child and singing and playing tambourine \"with some girlfriends for fun,\" had learned that My Bloody Valentine needed a backing vocalist from her partner, who had met \u00d3 C\u00edos\u00f3ig on a ferry from the Netherlands. At her audition, she sang \"The Bargain Store,\" a song from Dolly Parton's 1975 album of the same name. She was invited to join the group, with Byfield deemed unsuitable as a lead vocalist.", "Bilinda Butcher's vocals have been referred to as a trademark of My Bloody Valentine's sound, alongside Shields' guitar techniques. On a number of occasions during the recording of Isn't Anything and Loveless, Butcher was awoken and recorded vocals, which she said \"influenced [her] sound\" by making them \"more dreamy and sleepy\". The vocals in most My Bloody Valentine's recordings are low in the mix as Shields intended for the vocals to be used as an instrument. Critics have often described the band's vocals as androgynous.

Shields was initially reluctant to take on a vocal role within the band, but said that he had \"always sung in the rehearsal room... and made up the melodies.\" With the new line up in place, the band intended to drop the My Bloody Valentine moniker, but were unable to decide on a replacement and so kept the name \"for better or for worse\".", "During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Shields and Bilinda Butcher were in a relationship.

The first fruit of this experimentation was the single/EP \"You Made Me Realise\", released in July 1988, with Isn't Anything following later that year. \"Kevin gave me 'You Made Me Realise', which was supposed to be a track on their first EP for us,\" recalled Creation head Alan McGee. \"I went, That's the single!

Through mutual friends the band recruited two vocalists, Joe Byfield and Bilinda Butcher. After performing one show in April 1987\u00a0with both on vocals, My Bloody Valentine considered Byfield \"unsuitable\" for the band and he was subsequently fired. Butcher, whose prior musical experience had been playing classical guitar as a child, and singing and playing tambourine \"with some girlfriends for fun\", was chosen as My Bloody Valentine's new vocalist and began rehearsing with the band in the middle of 1987.", "My Bloody Valentine experimented with a noise pop sound on the album, a venture which was influenced by The Jesus and Mary Chain, and incorporated elements of twee pop similar to \"Strawberry Wine\". Shields used a twelve-string electric guitar during the Ecstasys recording sessions and was influenced by The Byrds during the writing process, which resulted in the guitar tones being \"too jingly jangly\". Writer Colin Larkin described Ecstasys sound as \"bubblegum pop with buzzsaw guitars\", which was similar to their prior releases and further diverged from their earlier post-punk and gothic rock sound. Jim DeRogatis noted that Ecstasys overall sound \"ushered in a sunnier, more optimistic vibe\" for the band which was reminiscent of the sound of 1960s American psychedelia, in particular the Los Angeles based band Love. \"Clair\", one of the first recordings to feature Bilinda Butcher, features a sampled tape loop of audience screams from The Beatles live album, The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl (1977). The sample was processed through audio filters to emulate guitar feedback.", "Upon its release Ecstasy received moderate critical acclaim. Melody Maker referred to the album as \"a series of aloof, pastel washes of sound, suspended guitars, words from the back of beyond tying in to a large, shifting whole\" and \"larger than the sum of its parts\". In Loveless, a book from the 33\u2153\u00a0series about the My Bloody Valentine album of the same name, Mike McGonial referred to Ecstasy as a \"rarified, effete and poppy approach to Byrdsian rock\" and AllMusic rated the album two and a half out of five stars.
