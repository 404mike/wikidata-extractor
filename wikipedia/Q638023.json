Hartlepool started the 2017\u201318 season with just one win from seven attempts. However, a win at Guiseley kick-started a run of only one defeat in thirteen matches. By November, off-field financial issues intensified which coincided with a winless run of eleven games. In a statement, Pam Duxbury (then chairwoman) claimed that a number of \"legacy issues have consumed high financial and human resources\" and that the club needed \u00a3200,000 in order to survive. In response to the financial issues, fans set up a JustGiving page which raised just over \u00a385,000, including donations from supporters across the UK and a \u00a32,500 boost by the former Middlesbrough striker Danny Graham. An initiative called 'Save Pools Day' took place on 20 January 2018 for a fixture against Wrexham where supporters from other clubs visited to raise funds via ticket sales. Hartlepool lost 2\u20130 with 6,833 supporters in attendance. The poor run of form resulted in the sacking of Craig Harrison in February who was replaced by caretaker manager Matthew Bates. Bates' first win came on 21 March during the televised away fixture at Barrow. During this match, Hartlepool went 1\u20130 down and briefly fell into the relegation places. Hartlepool won three consecutive matches to pull away from the relegation places and finally guaranteed safety from relegation on 17 April with a win against Leyton Orient. Hartlepool's first season in non-league ended with the club avoiding liquidation when Raj Singh bought the club in April. Hartlepool ultimately finished a turbulent season in 15th place.", "Pools' second season in non-league started with 6 wins in 8 games, leaving Bates' side in the play-off positions going into October. However, six consecutive defeats culminating in Hartlepool's lowest league home attendance since 1998 forced Raj Singh to sack Bates after 9 months in charge. Matthew Bates was replaced by the experienced Richard Money. However, after only six matches in charge, Money decided the job wasn't for him and switched roles with football director Craig Hignett in January. Pools' home form improved under Hignett with five wins from eight. Hignett guided Hartlepool to a disappointing 16th-place finish - the lowest league finish in the club's history."]}, {"page": "Eaglescliffe", "response": ["* Matthew Bates, defender for Hartlepool FC, raised and schooled in the area"]}, {"page": "Willo Flood", "response": ["Ahead of the 2010\u201311 season, Flood recovered from the knee injury and joined the club's pre-season.
