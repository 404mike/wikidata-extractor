Together with Andrews she made several contributions to business history: Capital Development in Steel (1951), The Eagle Ironworkers, Oxford (1965) and, their biography of British industrialist, The Life of Lord Nuffield (1955). Her clear style and disciplined approach contributed a lot to their joint work. In 1952 she helped create the Journal of Industrial Economics, first as editorial assistant and then assistant editor.Brunner first studied English literature, later taking up economics as research assistant to Philip Andrews in 1944. From 1946 to 1957 she was economics tutor at St. Hugh's College, Oxford.
