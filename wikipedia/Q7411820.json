Having arrived in Bristol from Ireland in 1813, Francis Danby was a participant from around 1818\u201319 and remained connected to the group for around a decade, although he left Bristol for London in 1824. Other artists involved were Edward Villiers Rippingille, Samuel Jackson, James Johnson, Nathan Cooper Branwhite, William West, James Baker Pyne, George Arthur Fripp and Paul Falconer Poole.", "Around 1832\u201333 a new series of sketching meetings was started. This initially included William James M\u00fcller, Thomas Leeson Scrase Rowbotham, John Skinner Prout and Robert Tucker, according to Tucker's own account. The meetings later grew to include more artists, although relatively few surviving drawings have been identified, compared to the meetings of the 1820s, and by the 1830s the works of the Bristol School were less original. Other participants in the meetings probably included Samuel Jackson, Stephen C. Jones, James Baker Pyne, Henry Brittan Willis, W. Williams, Joseph Walter, George Arthur Fripp, Edmund Gustavus M\u00fcller, and William Evans. These sketching meetings may have lasted into the 1840s.", "William James M\u00fcller's biographer Nathaniel Neal Solly described the sketching meetings as a formal club, but some commentators believe he had confused them with the formation of the Bristol Society of Artists, which held its first exhibition in 1832 at the Bristol Institution. That exhibition included numerous works by Samuel Jackson, James Johnson, Nathan Cooper Branwhite and William James M\u00fcller."]}, {"page": "George Weare Braikenridge", "response": ["He had a further collection of over 1400\u00a0drawings and watercolours of Bristol landscapes and buildings, which he also organised in line with the chapters of Barrett's book. He commissioned many of these drawings from local artists; over two-thirds of them from Hugh O'Neill, Thomas Leeson Scrase Rowbotham and Joseph Manning. Others were mainly from Samuel Jackson, James Johnson, Edward Cashin, George William Delamotte, John Eden and Marcus Holmes, although around 40\u00a0artists are represented in total. This collection is in the Bristol Museum.", "In addition to the collection organised around Barrett's book, Braikenridge obtained more watercolours by Samuel Jackson, oil paintings and watercolours by Francis Danby and drawings by Samuel Hieronymus Grimm. The paintings by Danby were atmospheric rather than topographical."]}, {"page": "James Johnson (artist)", "response": ["Johnson was born in 1803 at Downend near Bristol. His father was a publican. By 1819 he was producing drawings, and he exhibited a landscape at the Royal Academy in 1822. In Bristol he participated in the evening sketching meetings of the Bristol School, and in 1823 he collaborated with Francis Danby and Samuel Jackson in a lithography project."]}, {"page": "Joseph Walter", "response": ["Walter was born in Bristol and died there, but was living in Portishead at the time that he exhibited his first known work, View from Portishead towards Wales (1832). This was at the Bristol Institution in 1832, in the first exhibition of the Bristol Society of Artists. He is not known to have been associated with the Bristol School of artists in the 1820s. However surviving sketches suggest that he did take part in the revival of the school's sketching meetings in the 1830s. His drawing technique shows similarities to that of the leading Bristol School artist Samuel Jackson."]}]}}
