When he left school his first job was as a subeditor on a scout magazine - and he created sketches for the Boy Scout Gang Show. By the early 1940s, he was a caption writer for the Picture Post.\nIn 1943, he joined the Royal Air Force where he trained as an air gunner/navigator. After the war ended he sold advertising space with the Financial Times, but soon came full-time comedy writing.

After some pressure from Horne to keep the remainder of the team together, the BBC commissioned a replacement series, Round the Horne, on similar lines. They turned to one of the original writers of Beyond Our Ken, Barry Took and his new writing partner, Marty Feldman. Horne remained the genial and unflappable focal figure, and the writers invented several new and eccentric characters to revolve round him. They included J. Peasemold Gruntfuttock, the walking slum; the No\u00ebl Coward parodies Charles and Fiona; the incompetent villain Dr. Chou En Ginsberg; the folk singer Rambling Syd Rumpo and the \"outrageously camp\" Julian and Sandy.
