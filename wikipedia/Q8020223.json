As the children of the Gold Rush generation formed their own families, Melbourne's population swelled. The Victorian Parliament reacted by using railway lines to open up new housing areas. The railway line from Clifton Hill to Alphington was opened in 1884, and the railway station was linked to Melbourne via a western loop in 1888. A cable tram line down High Street to Clifton Hill was opened in 1886, faltered after the land market collapse of 1892, and opened and closed again until reopening permanently in 1901. Building continued through the Edwardian era and into the 1920s, and in 1925 the Northcote tram (now route 86) was connected right through to the city centre. In 1913 the Northcote South Ratepayer's Association gained permission to install two redundant 12 ton cannons from the 1880s facing south to North Fitzroy (built by W.G. Armstrong and Co. of Newcastle-on-Tyne, UK) and they are still in place.http://heritage.darebinlibraries.vic.gov.au/article/381 The present commercial and shopping strip along High St. dates to the early 20th century, and Westgarth Primary School to 1925, when it opened as Westgarth Central School. The suburb won its present name between 1906 and 1910, with the decision to name the railway station after William Westgarth.

Subsequently the two purchased the Melbourne Argus in equal co-partnership.

He energetically combated the efforts of the imperial authorities to prevent the effective administration of the enactment; and on the popular opposition proving successful he proceeded in 1853 with William Westgarth to Tasmania to assist the anti-transportation party in the colony. Indeed, he took a strong interest in all the public movements of the day; and his vigour and courage were so well recognised that, in the early days when bushrangers were prevalent, he had been offered the command of the police force of Port Phillip\u2014a position which, however, he did not accept. He was one of the members of the original Council of the University of Melbourne, and first Chairman of its Building Committee. In 1864 he was nominated to serve on the Hawthorn Council, and elected as the Mayor. When the gold discoveries in Victoria gave such a wonderful impetus to the colony, the vigorous judgment and business ability of Mackinnon, with the brilliant literary qualities of his partner, Edward Wilson, placed the Argus in the van of the Australian press. After some years of arduous work, Mackinnon returned to England, where he remained.
