H.(1859) Early Voyages to Terra Australis A group of mid-16th-century French maps, the Dieppe maps, formed his main evidence. However, there is widespread agreement today that his approach to historical research was flawed and his claims often exaggerated.McIntyre, K. G. (1977) p. 358Richardson, W. A. R.

(1977) p. 362. Note also the map's claim: \"Nuca/Antara discovered in 1601 by Manuel Godinho de Er\u00e9dia.\" However, the map also clearly identifies the land discovered and named by the Dutch \u2013 \"Endracht ou C\u00f5cordia\", named after Dirk Hartog's ship Eendracht of 1616. In fact, as  Richardson points out, this map's origins are from 1630.Richardson, W. A. R. (2006) p. 42. On finally locating and examining Er\u00e9dia's writings, Major realised the planned voyage to lands south of Sumba in Indonesia had never taken place. Major published a retraction in 1873, but his reputation was destroyed.McIntyre, K. G. (1977) pp. 367\u20138. Major's interpretation was examined critically by the Portuguese historian Joaquim Pedro de Oliveira Martins, who concluded that neither the patalie regi\u00e3 on the 1521 world map of Antoine de La SalePatalie regi\u00e3, Antoine de La Salle, Mappemonde de la fin du XVe si\u00e9cle nor the Jave la Grande on the Dieppe Maps was evidence of Australia having been visited by Portuguese visitors in the first quarter of the sixteenth century, but that this feature had found its way on to the maps from descriptions of islands of the Sunda archipelago beyond Java collected from native informants by the Portuguese.J.

Due to the hai jin laws, the Ming government was the only entity allowed to conduct foreign trade; regardless of this prohibition, Choe was informed of the rampant illegal smuggling that passed through Hangzhou, bringing in sandalwood, pepper, and perfumes from Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean.Brook (1998), 44. Yet this was a risky pursuit, as Choe was made aware that half the ships that engaged in this business did not return. On March 23, the Hangzhou prefectural government granted Choe's party a new escort, an official document explaining their presence in China, and lofty provisions of food and other items that were complements of the transport offices in charge of large-scale national transportation needs. The party stayed in Hangzhou for another two days before departing on March 25. The reason for the delay was due to courier officials' dutiful following of the handbook Bureaucratic System of the Ming Dynasty (Da Ming guanzhi), which was used to calculate through geomantic principles which days were auspicious to depart on and which days were not. The Europeans, too, became aware of such divination practices later in the 16th century: Mendoza's History of the great and mighty kingdom of China and the situation thereof (published 1585) mentions that among the Chinese books purchased by the Spanish Augustinian friar Mart\u00edn de Rada in Fujian in 1575 were some that discussed how to \"cast lottes when they beginne any journey ...\".
