He formed his own group, the Five Quavers, while in high school, and played in the RAF Silver Wings Dance Orchestra during World War II. The ensemble proved so cohesive that all twelve of its members decided to continue playing together after the war, under the name Phil Tate & His Orchestra, taking a residency at Leas Cliff Hall in Folkestone. Their instrumentation was unusual, featuring five saxes and three flutes. After appearing in the 1951 film Green Grow the Rushes, they took their next residency at the Hammersmith Palais and signed to Oriole Records.Tate's orchestra played at the Hammersmith for a full decade, then moved to the Ilford Palais. Tate hosted the BBC show Non-Stop-Pop, where he interviewed The Beatles on 30 July 1963. On radio, he was best known for his 144 appearances in Music While You Work. In 1964, his orchestra took up at the Locarno Ballroom in Streatham; the next year they appeared on the BBC program Music Through Midnight. Tate's most longstanding association came in 1965, when he became musical director for the Miss World Pageant. He disbanded his orchestra in 1967, and ran Mecca Agencies in addition to his duties with Miss World, where he remained until his retirement in 1992.He served as director of the Music Users' Council from 1992 to 2000, after which he retired.Tate died on 9 December 2005, at the age of 83.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Victor Silvester", "response": ["Silvester's record sales were so high that competition was inevitable. Other dancers were attracted to the idea, and set up their own strict-tempo bands. Henry Jacques, Maxwell Stewart, Josephine Bradley and Wally Fryer were all top-flight dancers who set up in competition to Silvester. There were other bands led by musicians who were capable of recording in strict time. The best for ballroom competitions was probably Joe Loss, who had an even longer musical career than Silvester. Other bands that catered to ballroom dancing were Oscar Rabin and Jack Harris, whose band played in clubs and restaurants through the 1930s, Phil Tate, and Jack Parnell. For the post-war period of Latin dances to (mostly) Cuban and Brazilian rhythms, Edmundo Ros was in a class of his own."]}, {"page": "Tate (surname)", "response": ["*Phil Tate (1922\u20132005), English dancer"]}, {"page": "West Leeds High School", "response": ["* Phil Tate, musician"]}, {"page": "Phil tate", "response": ["#REDIRECT Phil Tate "]}, {"page": "List of people from Folkestone", "response": ["*Phil Tate (1922\u20132005) dance bandleader"]}, {"page": "Tommie Connor", "response": ["| Phil Tate"]}, {"page": "Happy Days and Lonely Nights", "response": ["*\"Happy Days and Lonely Nights\" has also been recorded by Ken Dodd, Anneke Gr\u00f6nloh, Dick James, Ginger Rogers, Kathy Kirby, Duke Special and Kay Starr with instrumental versions by UK pianist Billy Thorburn (recorded 2 November 1954), Max Bygraves, Russ Conway, Ted Heath and Phil Tate."]}, {"page": "List of songs about Paris", "response": ["* \"Boulevard St Michel\" by Phil Tate and his Music"]}, {"page": "The Wonderful World of the Young", "response": ["Other versions have been recorded by Lawrence Welk, Phil Tate, and John Treacy Egan."]}]}}
