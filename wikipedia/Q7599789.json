Despite being compared to Nazi propaganda , and criticised as \"reckless xenophobia,\" and racist, the cartoon received praise on the Mail Online website. A Daily Mail spokesperson told The Independent: \"We are not going to dignify these absurd comments which wilfully misrepresent this cartoon apart from to say that we have not received a single complaint from any reader\".  Kate Allen, director of Amnesty International UK, wrote that \"The Daily Mails cartoon is precisely the sort of reckless xenophobia that fuels the self-same fear and hate loved by those responsible for atrocities in Paris, Beirut, Ankara and elsewhere. Now more than ever is the time to stand together in defiance of the perpetrators of violence with all of their victims and reject this disturbing lack of compassion\"."]}, {"page": "Whizzer and Chips", "response": ["* Percy's Pets (from Smash!) \u2014 by Stanley McMurtry"]}, {"page": "Wham!
