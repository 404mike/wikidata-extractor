He taught at Cambridge, Nottingham, and London universities, and from 1964 at Oxford, where he was a fellow first at University College, and later at New College. He retired in 1985. His specialty was as a historian, translator, philologist, editor, and teacher of advanced students.\nHis specialty was the era of Ivan III and 15th century Russia. In evaluating the overall significance of Ivan the Great, Fennell concludes that his reign was \"militarily glorious and economically sound,\" and especially points to his territorial annexations and his centralized control over local rulers. However Fennell adds that his reign was also \"a period of cultural depression and spiritual barrenness. Freedom was stamped out within the Russian lands. By his bigoted anti-Catholicism Ivan brought down the curtain between Russia and the west. For the sake of territorial aggrandizement he deprived his country of the fruits of Western learning and civilization.\"Dimnick says of Fennell, \"His achievements are unrivaled in the West, and almost so in the Soviet Union and Russia\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of historians", "response": ["*John Lister Illingworth Fennell (1918\u20131992), medieval Russia"]}, {"page": "Fennell", "response": ["*John Lister Illingworth Fennell, British historian of Russia"]}, {"page": "Illingworth", "response": ["*John Lister Illingworth Fennell (1918\u20131992), British historian"]}, {"page": "J.L.I.

Fennell", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Lister Illingworth Fennell"]}, {"page": "Maria Palaiologina (Princess of Vereya)", "response": ["According to Russian sources, Maria was married off to the Russian noble , Prince of Vereya, by her aunt (Andreas' sister) Sophia Palaiologina in around 1480, after Andreas' visit to Russia in 1480. Sophia was one of the most powerful people in Russia through her marriage to Grand Prince Ivan III of Moscow. Maria is not mentioned in any western sources. Claims of her existence were first forwarded in western scholarship by the Polish historian and genealogist Adam Boniecki in 1887 and then by the French historian and genealogist Nicolas de Baumgarten in 1934, citing the older Russian chronicles. Recognition of Maria's historicity has varied since then. In his 1961 biography of Ivan III, the British historian John Lister Illingworth Fennell accepted Maria's historicity without comment, but in 1992, the British historian Donald Nicol simply wrote that Russian sources ascribed a daughter to Andreas by this name, unknown in western sources.", "The Russian chronicles relate that Maria and Vasily were involved in a scandal in 1483. On 10 October 1483, Ivan III wished to honor the birth of his grandson Dmitry Ivanovich by giving a valuable setting or cluster of jewels, or possibly a necklace, to Dmity's mother Elena of Moldavia. The jewels had originally been part of the dowry of Ivan III's first wife, Maria of Tver, and had been entrusted to Sophia. When Ivan III asked Sophia to hand them over, she was unable to do so. Sophia had squandered a lot of Ivan's treasure, giving some of it to her brother Andreas and some of it, including the jewels, as the dowry of Maria on her marriage to Vasily. Ivan, furious, decided not to punish Sophia, but instead punish Vasily, whose only crime was having accepted Sophia's presents. Agents were sent by Ivan to Vereya to take back the jewels, and to capture Vasily and Maria, threatening imprisonment. Though Sophia was sympathetic to her niece and nephew-in-law, Vasily was not confident in Sophia's influence at the Muscovite court and fled to Lithuania, though Maria of Tver's jewels were left behind and were successfully confiscated by Ivan's agents. According to John Lister Illingworth Fennell, there was likely more to this incident than is stated in the chronicles, given that it is unlikely that Vasily and Maria would have gone so far as to flee the country and disinherit themselves over just as trivial a mistake as Maria's aunt wrongly giving away Maria of Tver's jewels."]}]}}
