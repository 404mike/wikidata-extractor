While at Berkeley he worked with E.O. Lawrence on the cyclotron in the radiation laboratory and was the discoverer of the radioisotope gallium-67, which is still in use in nuclear medicine.\nHis mentor at Imperial College was George Paget Thomson the British physicist in charge of the Tube Alloys project during the war years (the British nuclear program that was later incorporated into the Manhattan Project).\nHe had Mann assigned to the British Embassy in Washington DC and to the Chalk River Laboratory in Canada. In 1951, Wilfrid Mann came to the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) as the head of the Radioactivity Section. For the next 30 years Wilfrid Mann was the most influential radionuclide metrologist in the world.\nDuring the early 1950s, he had a keen interest in the national standards for radium-226 and undertook microcalorimetric experiments to intercompare the national standards (H\u00f6nigschmid standards) of the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and Germany. He retired from NBS in 1980. \nMann was obliged to deny claims that he was a member of the Cambridge Spy Ring in his 1982 memoir Was There A Fifth Man? Mann had been accused on several occasions of being the \"fifth man,\" based on rumored work at the Embassy and the resemblance between his middle name and the \"Basil\" of investigative journalist Andrew Boyle's book Climate of Treason. In his memoirs, Mann argued using contemporary correspondence, publications, and verified passport entries that he was incapable of having worked with Donald Maclean in the British Embassy. As part of his hiring at the Bureau of Standards, Mann underwent intense security screening and received a top-level \"Q\" clearance from the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission.Mann died in Towson, Maryland in 2001.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "National Institute of Standards and Technology", "response": ["* Wilfrid Basil Mann"]}, {"page": "Cambridge Five", "response": ["* Wilfrid Basil Mann: Mann had been accused on several occasions of being the \"fifth man,\" based on rumored former work at the Embassy and the resemblance between his name and the \"Basil\" of Boyle's codename.
