Man\u00e9 put Liverpool ahead, but Matthew Pennington drew Everton level in the 28th minute. The host Reds regained the lead two minutes and 57 seconds later with a strike from Coutinho. Origi, a substitute for the injured Man\u00e9, added a third goal just minutes after being introduced and the scoreline remained 3\u20131 till the final whistle. The second fixture was on 5 April against AFC Bournemouth at Anfield. Benik Afobe scored early for the visiting Cherries off a back-pass mishap from Wijnaldum. However, Coutinho drew the match level at 1\u20131 with a goal in the 40th minute. The Reds struck first in the second half with a goal from Origi, assisted by Wijnaldum, in the 59th. Bournemouth was able to draw the game level through a late Joshua King goal putting the score at 2\u20132, which the match finished. The day before their upcoming fixture, an away match at Stoke City, Klopp confirmed Man\u00e9 would ruled out for the remainder of Liverpool's season. Liverpool had no time to dwell upon this as Stoke awaited the following day. With a side featuring youth players such as Trent Alexander-Arnold and Woodburn, Liverpool fell behind 1\u20130 at the half following a Jonathan Walters goal just before the break. However, the introduction of Firmino and Coutinho at half-time led to responses in the 70th and 72nd minutes, where Coutinho then Firmino respectively scored to put the scoreline at 1\u20132. The Reds saw the match out, marking their first away victory of the calendar year in the Premier League. Liverpool's April continued with a match at West Brom, where the sole goal came from Firmino off a set piece header in first-half injury time. The final fixture of the month was a return to Anfield to square-off with Crystal Palace. Coutinho opened the scoring in the 24th minute off a free-kick, however former Liverpool man Christian Benteke leveled the match then scored a second in the 74th to hand Liverpool a 1\u20132 loss, just their second Premier League home defeat of the season."]}, {"page": "2016\u201317 Everton F.C. season", "response": ["|Matthew Pennington"]}]}}
