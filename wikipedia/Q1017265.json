Her interest in the human memory brought Brown to focus on active memory strategies that would help enhance human memory and developmental differences in memory tasks. Her realization that children's learning difficulties often stem from an inability to use metacognitive strategies such as summarizing led to profound advances in educational psychology theory and teaching practices.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Intelligence quotient", "response": ["An alternative to standard IQ tests, meant to test the proximal development of children, originated in the writings of psychologist Lev Vygotsky (1896\u20131934) during his last two years of his life. According to Vygotsky, the maximum level of complexity and difficulty of problems that a child is capable to solve under some guidance indicates their level of potential development. The difference between this level of potential and the lower level of unassisted performance indicates the child's zone of proximal development. Combination of the two indexesthe level of actual and the zone of the proximal developmentaccording to Vygotsky, provides a significantly more informative indicator of psychological development than the assessment of the level of actual development alone. His ideas on the zone of development were later developed in a number of psychological and educational theories and practices, most notably under the banner of dynamic assessment, which seeks to measure developmental potentialSternberg, R.J. & Grigorenko, E.L.

Winn prefers this type of experiment particularly because it conveys many features of open ended research methods. In a design experiment, the researcher tests his or her intervention in an educational setting such as a classroom, makes modifications depending on the data collected, and conducts the intervention until it produces good results. The data collected is in form of observations, results from tests, or any form of work that will show that the student has learned what is expected. Compared to a controlled experiment in which many variables are controlled, in the design experiment, modifications are made over time. Winn explained that a key difference between the two types of experiments is that \u201cthe controlled experiment adapts the setting to suit the intervention through experimental control, whereas the design experiment adapts the intervention to suit the setting through iteration\u201d. Although Winn is in favor of design experiments he does note one of its weaknesses. This type of non-experimental research involves more time and skill than implementing experimental research. However, it can yield crucial evidence about the success of interventions and how students learn."]}, {"page": "List of educational psychologists", "response": ["* Ann Brown (1943\u20131999)"]}, {"page": "Anne Brown (disambiguation)", "response": ["Anne or Ann Brown may also refer to:", "*Ann Brown (1943\u20131999), British educational psychologist", "*Ann Brown (curler) (died 2006), American curler", "*Ann Brown, chair of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission from 1994 to 2001", "*Ann Browne (born 1955), Trinidadian international cricketer"]}, {"page": "Design-based research", "response": ["The method was first proposed as design-experiments by Allan Collins in 1990 and Ann Brown in 1992.
