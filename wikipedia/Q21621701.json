Scotland dominated the game until a surprising fight-back by Italy in the last 10 minutes saw the Azzurri score three times to set up a tense finish. A close-fought but chaotic loss to Ireland by 13-22 came the following week, with further losses to France (10-27) and eventual Grand Slam winners Wales (11-18) in the ensuing rounds. In the last game of the competition, Scotland faced England at home in Twickenham. The first half was almost entirely one-sided, with England racing out to a 31-0 lead in the first 30 minutes, until Stuart McInally scored a breakaway try off a charge-down from English captain Owen Farrell. The second half witnessed a stunning comeback by the Scots, with a flurry of tries to Darcy Graham, Magnus Bradbury, Finn Russell and Sam Johnson putting Scotland into the lead by 38-31 with 4 minutes to go before a last-gasp try to replacement English fly-half George Ford, who then converted to level the final score at 38-38. The drawn result allowed Scotland to retain the Calcutta Cup, and was both the highest-scoring draw and the highest-scoring comeback of any rugby match on record."]}, {"page": "Currie RFC", "response": ["*Blair Kinghorn "]}, {"page": "Scotland national rugby sevens team", "response": ["* Blair Kinghorn *", "* Blair Kinghorn "]}, {"page": "Kinghorn (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Blair Kinghorn (born 1997), Scottish rugby union player"]}, {"page": "Scotland A national rugby union team", "response": ["|Blair Kinghorn"]}, {"page": "List of Scotland national rugby union players", "response": ["|1091||KinghornBlair Kinghorn||style=\"text-align:center; background:#ccffcc;\"|(Wing)||2018-02-24|| v England at Murrayfield"]}, {"page": "Russia at the Rugby World Cup", "response": ["|FB ||15||Blair Kinghorn"]}, {"page": "List of Scotland national rugby union team records", "response": ["| Blair Kinghorn"]}, {"page": "Scotland national under-20 rugby union team", "response": ["*Blair Kinghorn (Edinburgh Rugby)", "*Blair Kinghorn (Edinburgh Rugby)", "*Blair Kinghorn (Edinburgh Academy)", "*Blair Kinghorn (Edinburgh Academy/Edinburgh Academicals FC)"]}, {"page": "List of people educated at Edinburgh Academy", "response": ["* Blair Kinghorn Rugby player, Edinburgh Rugby, Scotland u20's"]}, {"page": "2015\u201316 Edinburgh Rugby season", "response": [" Blair Kinghorn", "*  Blair Kinghorn", "|FH||||Blair Kinghorn||6(6)||0||18||(2)||0||0||6(8)||18"]}]}}
