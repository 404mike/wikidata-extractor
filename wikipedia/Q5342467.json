Cross was an English footballer who played as a defender. Born in Northwich he started out with local side Northwich Victoria before moving across the Pennines to play for Rotherham Town.

After just one season at Bramall Lane he returned to former club Northwhich Victoria before rejoining Rotherham Town.A brief spell at Chesterfield followed, from whom he was dismissed for not turning up to play the scheduled Easter fixtures, before finishing his career with a third spell with Rotherham Town where he was to make his Football League debut.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Edward Cross", "response": ["Edward Cross may refer to:", "*Edward Cross (politician) (1798\u20131887), Democratic member of the United States House of Representatives from the state of Arkansas", "*Edward Cross (zoo proprietor) (1774\u20131854), English zoo proprietor and dealer in animals", "*Edward Cross (footballer), English footballer who played for Sheffield United"]}, {"page": "1890\u201391 Sheffield United F.C. season", "response": ["[[File:Sheffield United Squad 1890-91.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|alt=United squad from the 1890\u201391 season.

The players recruited from Scotland during the previous summer had failed to live up to expectations and the majority of them were released; only Calder and Robertson were retained. Billy Bridgewater and Edward Cross were signed from nearby Rotherham Town, and Harry Lilley arrived from Staveley during the close season, but the Blades persisted with their policy of utilising guest amateur players from the local area."]}, {"page": "1891\u201392 Sheffield United F.C. season", "response": ["United continued with a sizable turnover of playing staff but were now focusing on using their financial position to target experienced professionals rather than relying on the untried talents of previous seasons.  Bob Cain and Harry Hammond arrived in August, recruited from Bootle and Everton respectively, while previous stalwarts like Edward Cross, Billy Bridgewater and W. Robertson were allowed to leave.  A young Ernest Needham was promoted to the first team and began to feature regularly as the season progressed; he would eventually go on to make over 450 league appearances for the Blades and to captain England during his career."]}]}}
