They experiment with many different styles of music including punk, reggae, calypso, and bluegrass, and tend to add something of an Irish folk flavour to the typical indie rock sound, While often compared musically to bands such as The Clash, The Pogues and The Libertines, the band drew many of their lyrical influences from literature, including writers such as Rimbaud, Wilde and Orwell.After releasing their first two singles on the independent labels Young and Lost Club and Transgressive Records respectively, the band signed to Warner as part of a 'consultancy deal' between Warner and Transgressive. The band released their debut album, The Freedom Spark, on 25 September 2006.\nOn 4 May 2007 it was announced that the band had split up, shortly prior to the release of their debut album in continental Europe.\nFollowing the split of the band, Leeson formed the short-lived Pan I Am and Sunless '97. Micko Larkin moved to LA, where he worked with Courtney Love before becoming part of a reformed Hole. Ambrose joined Gaoler's Daughter, and Kerrigan joined his brother Fiachra's band Marner Brown, who later changed their name to K.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Leeson", "response": ["*Edward Leeson, British musician"]}]}}
