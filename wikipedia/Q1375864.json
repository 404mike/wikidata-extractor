He contributed to the introduction of American cotton. As a taxonomist he described 110 new genera and 1267 new species of flowering plants. He employed Indian botanical artists to illustrate many plants collected by himself and Indian collectors he trained. Some of these illustrations were published by William Hooker in Britain, but from 1838 he published a series of illustrated works in Madras including the uncoloured, six-volume Icones Plantarum Indiae Orientalis (1838\u201353) and two hand-coloured, two-volume works, the Illustrations of Indian Botany (1838\u201350) and Spicilegium Neilgherrense (1845\u201351). By the time he retired from India in 1853 he had published 2464 illustrations of Indian plants.
