She started her working life as a nurse in Edinburgh but rose to prominence as a green political activist during and after the 1989 European Parliament election, in which the UK Green Party gained 15% of the votes but no seats.  She resigned from the party in 1992, at odds with the party's anti-leadership stance, and went on to found the Forum for the Future with Jonathon Porritt and Paul Ekins.  Her current campaigning focus is sustainability literacy as an essential outcome of formal education, especially in universities and colleges.
