When Harris was 18, he released two songs, \"Da Bongos\" and \"Brighter Days\". Both were released as 12-inch club singles and CD-EPs by the label Prima Facie in early 2002 under the name \"Stouffer\". With these singles to his credit, Harris moved from Scotland to London, hoping to learn from the local music scene. Only one of his songs, \"Let Me Know\" with vocalist Ayah Marar on the Unabombers' 2004 live-mix CD Electric Soul, Vol. 2, was released during his time in London. With the lack of job opportunities and money, he returned home to Dumfries and began posting homemade solo recordings to his Myspace page.\"Calvin Harris: fish factory to fame\". MTV. Retrieved 31 July 2015 His popularity on the social media website prompted Mark Gillespie, a talent booker for the dance-festival firm Global Gathering who had recently founded his own management firm, to make Harris the company's first signee. Regarding his choice of his stage name, Harris stated that, \"My first single was more of a soul track, and I thought Calvin Harris sounded a bit more racially ambiguous. I thought people might not know if I was black or not. After that, I was stuck with it.\"", "Harris's second album, Ready for the Weekend, was released in August 2009 and entered at number one on the UK Albums Chart, being certified gold by the BPI within two months of release. Eleven of the fourteen tracks on the album were sung, produced, and written solely by Harris. \"I'm Not Alone\", released as the album's lead single in April 2009, debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart. The follow-up single, \"Ready for the Weekend\", reached number three. The third single, \"Flashback\", featuring Jordanian singer Ayah Marar reached number eighteen in the UK. During promotion of the album, Harris hosted a series of videos on YouTube titled Jam TV, in which musicians such as Florence Welch, Goldie, and Katy Perry tried to open pots of jam.
