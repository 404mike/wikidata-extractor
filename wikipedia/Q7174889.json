Pirie (1916 \u2013 1997) was an English musicologist and critic, prominent in music journalism of the mid-twentieth century. Having left school with no formal qualifications, Pirie was self-taught in music until he won a composition scholarship to the Guildhall School of Music, where he studied piano, composition and conducting.\nDuring the Second World War he was a conscientious objector, and went to prison as a result. Once released, he was permitted to serve with the Light Rescue Service. After the war, Pirie and his family moved to Whitstable, Kent, where he helped to run a music and book shop, \"Pirie and Cavender\", which was in business until 2007. Later on he moved to Sussex, near to the South Downs which he loved deeply. His wife Mildred (1911\u20131996) was a member of the Society of Friends (Quakers) and active as a peace campaigner.\nHis writing about music mainly consisted of magazine articles, reviews of recordings and concerts, and record sleeve-notes. He was a supporter of 20th century English music, especially that of Arnold Bax and Frank Bridge. The Stratford & East London Music Festival awards a \"Peter J. Pirie Memorial Prize\" and a \"Mildred Pirie Memorial Cup\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Arnold Bax", "response": ["Bax wrote his seven completed symphonies between 1921 and 1939. In a study of the seven, David Cox wrote in 1967 that they were \"often dismissed as amorphous by those who imagine that Bax consists only of Celtic mistiness and 'atmosphere'. In fact they have considerable strength and frequent astringence; and formally the thematic material is presented with consistency and purpose.\"Cox, pp. 155\u2013156 In Herbage's view, the cycle can be seen to fall into two groups \u2013 the first three and the last three \u2013 with the Fourth Symphony as \"an extrovert interlude between these largely introspective works\". Handley agreed that the first three could be grouped together; Foreman sees a Celtic influence in all three, with Bax's emotions about the Easter rising and its aftermath discernible. The Fourth is generally regarded as a more optimistic work than its predecessors and successors. Handley calls it \"festive\", but comments that its ideas developed into darker mood in the Fifth and Sixth.Anderson, p. 94 The Fifth is, for Herbage, \"the greatest tour-de-force\"; the Sixth stands out for its \"magnificent final movement\", which the critic Peter J. Pirie said \"tears the earth up by its roots\";Anderson, p. 95 and the Seventh, in the view of the Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, has an elegiac tone, its simplicity far removed from the discursive and complex music of Bax's earlier years."]}, {"page": "Pirie", "response": ["* Peter J.
