The goal was to spark a fine run of form for Smith into the new year, scoring in victories over Colchester United and Norwich City within the first week of 2011 \u2014 the latter goal a first-half header that ensured Orient progressed to the Fourth Round of the FA Cup courtesy of a 1\u20130 win at Carrow Road. Later that month, Smith scored another decisive goal in the FA Cup, this time as Orient disposed of Swansea City at the Liberty Stadium after securing a 2\u20131 victory. The win set up a Fifth Round tie at home to Premier League side Arsenal, with Smith playing the whole game as Orient took the North London club to a replay following a 1\u20131 draw. As well as his important goals in the FA Cup, Smith also scored four times within the space of a month between February and March 2011. The first of these goals came courtesy of a \"powerful header\" in a 4\u20131 home win over Bristol Rovers on 12 February, before scoring twice three days in a 3\u20132 victory over MK Dons at Stadium mk. His eighth of the season came in Orient's 2\u20132 draw with promotion-chasing Huddersfield Town on 29 February, as Smith's low long-range strike restored parity late-on despite Orient only having ten men. Smith's form during the month resulted in him being nominated for League One Player of the Month for February. He added one further goal to his tally that season, volleying in Dean Cox's cross to score the only goal of the game as Orient won 1\u20130 away at Hartlepool United in March 2011. The victory meant Orient had gone a club-record fourteen league games without defeat. Smith scored nine times in 42 appearances during the season, as Orient missed out on the final play-off place by a point.

He doubled his tally for the season a month later in a 1\u20131 draw with Colchester United, when he \"tapped in\" from close range in injury-time to help Orient earn only their second point from their opening seven league matches. He went on to score in comfortable victories over Rochdale and Bromley to end the year in positive fashion as Orient began to climb the League One standings. Smith scored in consecutive away wins in the opening months of 2012; firstly netting from close range in a 2\u20130 win against Preston North End, before denting AFC Bournemouth's play-off hopes with a back post header in a 2\u20131 Orient triumph. His seventh and final goal of the season came in a 2\u20130 home win over local rivals Brentford on 17 March 2012, collecting Ben Chorley's flick-on before finishing calmly to double Orient's advantage in the match.
