A subroutine is often coded so that it can be started several times and from several places during one execution of the program, including from other subroutines, and then branch back (return) to the next instruction after the call, once the subroutine's task is done. The idea of a subroutine was initially conceived by John Mauchly during his work on ENIAC, and recorded in a January 1947 Harvard symposium on \"Preparation of Problems for EDVAC-type Machines\".J.W. Mauchly, \"Preparation of Problems for EDVAC-type Machines\" (1947), in Brian Randell (Ed.), The Origins of Digital Computers, Springer, 1982. Maurice Wilkes, David Wheeler, and Stanley Gill are generally credited with the formal invention of this concept, which they termed a closed subroutine, contrasted with an open subroutine or macro.
