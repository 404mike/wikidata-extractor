His best-known recordings include \"Boiled Beef and Carrots\" (1909), \"I'm Henery the Eighth, I Am\" (1910), \"Any Old Iron\" (1911) and \"A Little Bit of Cucumber\" (1915).\nChampion was born in Bethnal Green, East London. He made his stage debut at the age of 17 at the Royal Victoria Music Hall in Old Ford Road, Bethnal Green, in July 1882. He initially appeared as Will Conray and went on to appear in small music halls in the East End of London. In 1887 he changed his stage name to Harry Champion and started to perform in other parts of London where he built up a wide repertoire of songs. His trademark style was singing at a fast tempo and often about the joys of food.\nAfter more than 4 decades on the stage, Champion took early retirement after the death of his wife in 1928, but returned two years later to appear on radio, gaining a new, much younger audience as a result. During the great depression of the 1930s, music hall entertainment had made a brief comeback, and Champion, like other performers of the genre, returned to performing. By the early 1940s he was in ill health, and died just a month after being admitted to a nursing home in 1942.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cockney", "response": ["*Harry Champion, music-hall singer and comedian, born in Bethnal Green"]}, {"page": "1942 in music", "response": ["**Harry Champion, music hall composer, 76"]}, {"page": "1894 in music", "response": ["* \"Oh!

The precursor to variety shows of today, music hall involved a mixture of popular songs, comedy, speciality acts and variety entertainment. Music hall songs include \"I'm Henery the Eighth, I Am\", \"Hokey cokey\", \"I Do Like To be Beside the Seaside\" and \"The Laughing Policeman\". British performers who honed their skills at pantomime and music hall sketches include Charlie Chaplin, Stan Laurel, George Formby, Gracie Fields, Dan Leno, Gertrude Lawrence, Marie Lloyd and Harry Champion. British music hall comedian and theatre impresario Fred Karno developed a form of sketch comedy without dialogue in the 1890s, and Chaplin and Laurel were notable music hall comedians who worked for him. Laurel stated, \"Fred Karno didn't teach Charlie [Chaplin] and me all we know about comedy. He just taught us most of it\". Film producer Hal Roach stated; \"Fred Karno is not only a genius, he is the man who originated slapstick comedy. We in Hollywood owe much to him.\"J. P. Gallagher (1971). \"Fred Karno: master of mirth and tears\". p. 165. Hale. Examples of variety shows that evolved from the music hall include the Royal Variety Performance (first performed in 1912), which was broadcast on BBC radio from the 1920s, and then on television since the 1950s. Annually held in December (often at the London Palladium) and performed in front of members of the British Royal Family, many famous acts have performed at the Royal Variety show over the century, and since 2007 one act of the show has been selected by the British public through the ITV television talent show Britain's Got Talent."]}, {"page": "Early British popular music", "response": ["Music hall developed as a result of the rapid industrialisation and urbanisation of previously rural populations in the 19th century.H. Cunningham, Leisure in the Industrial Revolution c. 1780-c. 1880 (London: Taylor and Francis, 1980), pp. 164-70. The new urban communities, cut off from their cultural roots, required new and accessible means of entertainment. Music halls were originally bars, which provided entertainment in the form of music and speciality acts for their patrons. By the middle years of the 19th century, the first purpose-built music halls were being built in London. The halls created a demand for new and catchy popular songs that could no longer be met from the traditional folk repertoire. Professional songwriters were enlisted to fill the gap. By the turn of the century, music hall was dominated by song writing companies and theatre chains, such as that of Sir Oswald Stoll.M. R. Booth and J. H. Kaplan, ed., The Edwardian Theatre Essays on Performance and the Stage (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996), p. 62.  Music hall songs are characterised by a simple beat and a strong melody or tune, which can be easily acquired by the audience. Typically, a music hall song consists of a series of verses sung by the performer alone and a repeated chorus, which carries the principal melody and in which the audience is encouraged to join. Leading music hall stars included: Marie Lloyd, Harry Champion, George Formby, Vesta Tilley, Gus Elen, Little Tich, Gracie Fields and Flanagan and Allen.
