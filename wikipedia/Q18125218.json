Many fans at the time believed that the war had robbed the team of a probable promotion to the first division, although there was some evidence that the team was already beginning to decline by 1939. Coventry continued playing some friendly games until November 1940, when the Coventry Blitz damaged the stadium and brought all football in the city to a halt. Friendly matches resumed again in 1942, as parts of Highfield Road had been rebuilt, and the team joined the Midland Regional League. The only player connected with the club to be killed during the war was Arthur Bacon, who had played for City until 1935, but the successful team of the 1930s would nonetheless not reform. Harry Storer left to manage Birmingham City in 1945, while players such as William Morgan, Jack Astley, and George Taylor retired from the game."]}, {"page": "Astley (name)", "response": ["* Jack Astley (1909\u20131984), English football right back"]}, {"page": "Alexander Stevenson (footballer)", "response": ["Stevenson moved to England to sign for Third Division South club Brentford during the 1927 off-season.
