After scoring 119 in three hours against a Bristol University team in June 1954 he was promoted to the senior team. He played 12 first-class matches that season but scored only 264 runs at an average of 13.20 with top score of 41.After national service in the Royal Air Force he returned to county cricket in 1957, and despite scoring a quick 193 out of a team total of 291 for 5 for the Second XI against Somerset Second XI he was unable to make an impact at first-class level. He again struggled in 1958, but he scored his first fifty: 74, in what Wisden called a \"polished display\", and 32 against Glamorgan.Carpenter established himself in 1961, scoring 1353 runs at 23.32 in what turned out to be his only full season in the First XI. Having previously scored only two fifties in his first 56 matches, he scored 10 fifties in 30 matches in 1961, with a top score of 89 against Somerset, and 85 three days later against the touring Australians, when he put on 119 for the first wicket with Martin Young.He played most of the season in 1962 and made his highest score, 95 against Derbyshire, but otherwise he was less successful than in 1961. After a lean season in 1963 he retired from first-class cricket.\nCarpenter died on 4 January 2022, at the age of 86.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "David Carpenter (disambiguation)", "response": ["David Carpenter is an American serial killer.", "David Carpenter may also refer to:", "*David Carpenter, early Texas settler and namesake of Carpenters Bayou ", "*David Carpenter, better known as Dave Carpender, guitarist", "*David Carpenter (cricketer) (born 1935), English cricketer", "*David Carpenter (historian) (born 1947), British historian", "*David Carpenter (writer) (born 1941), Canadian novelist", "*David Carpenter (baseball, born 1985), baseball player ", "*David Carpenter (baseball, born 1987), baseball player"]}, {"page": "List of people with surname Carpenter", "response": ["* Dave Carpender, aka David Carpenter, guitarist with \"The Greg Kihn Band\"  ", "* David Carpenter (baseball, born 1985), baseball player", "* David Carpenter (baseball, born 1987), baseball player", "* David Carpenter (cricketer), English cricketer", "* David Carpenter (historian) (born 1947), British historian", "* David Carpenter (writer) (born 1941), Canadian novelist", "* David Carpenter, serial killer also known as the \"Trailside Killer\""]}, {"page": "List of Gloucestershire County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* David Carpenter (1954\u20131963) : D.
