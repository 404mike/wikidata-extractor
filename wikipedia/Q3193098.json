At Barcelona 1992, aged only 16 years old, she defeated in the semi-final veteran British fighter and 4-time world champion Karen Briggs, but she lost the final by a small margin against the reigning world champion, C\u00e9cile Nowak of France. This was followed by a 4-year, 84-match winning streak that led her to her second Olympic final at Atlanta 1996. Tani was the clear favorite against the relatively unknown North-Korean Kye Sun Hui, but she was unable to live up to the expectations. Kye resisted all her attacks and scored an advantage towards the end of the fight. Tani's second Olympic silver was a huge setback, and the Japanese media talked of an \"Olympic curse\". Reflecting on this years later, Tani said, \"there was never a curse \u2026 in 1992, I was 16, I was lacking experience \u2026 in 1996, I was 20\"."]}, {"page": "World Judo Championships", "response": ["| align=\"left\" | Karen Briggs || align=\"left\" |  || \u221248\u00a0kg || 1982 || 1991 || bgcolor=\"#F7F6A8\" | 4 || bgcolor=\"#DCE5E5\" | 1 || bgcolor=\"#FFDAB9\" | \u2013 || bgcolor=\"#E7FAEC\" | 5"]}, {"page": "1991 World Judo Championships", "response": ["| Karen Briggs"]}, {"page": "1989 World Judo Championships", "response": ["| Karen Briggs"]}, {"page": "1982 World Judo Championships", "response": ["| Karen Briggs"]}, {"page": "1984 World Judo Championships", "response": ["| Karen Briggs"]}, {"page": "1986 World Judo Championships", "response": ["| Karen Briggs"]}, {"page": "Briggs (surname)", "response": ["*Karen Briggs (disambiguation), multiple people", ":* Karen Briggs (musician) (born 1963), American violinist", ":* Karen Briggs (judoka) (born 1963), British judoka"]}, {"page": "1991 European Judo Championships", "response": ["|bgcolor=silver | 2.||Karen Briggs||"]}, {"page": "1990 European Judo Championships", "response": ["| Karen Briggs", "|bgcolor=silver | 2.||Karen Briggs||"]}, {"page": "Karen Briggs", "response": ["Karen Briggs may refer to:", "* Karen Briggs (musician) (born 1963), American violinist", "* Karen Briggs (judoka) (born 1963), British judoka"]}, {"page": "Judo at the 1992 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's 48 kg", "response": ["| 5T || align=\"left\"| Karen Briggs|| align=\"left\"| "]}]}}
