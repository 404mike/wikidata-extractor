He often describes how he felt it while alone in a hotel room in March 1990, and finally asked, \"If there is anybody here, will you please contact me because you are driving me up the wall!\" Days later, in a newsagent's shop in Ryde, he felt a force pull his feet to the ground and heard a voice guide him toward some books. One of them was Mind to Mind (1989) by Betty Shine, a psychic healer in Brighton. He read the book, then wrote to her requesting a consultation about his arthritis."]}, {"page": "Shine (surname)", "response": ["* Betty Shine, (1929\u20132002), an English author, opera singer and spiritualist"]}]}}
