Somerset captain Rose won the toss on an overcast morning and chose to field first. Heavy rain in the week leading up to the match meant that the outfield was slow, making scoring difficult early in the day. Surrey started slowly; after the first ten overs they were seven for one, having lost Jack Richards. They added another eight runs in the next eight overs, and lost their other opener, Grahame Clinton. Somerset's bowlers were partly credited for the start; Ian Botham was extracting a lot of swing from some of his deliveries, while the Times journalist John Woodcock praised Joel Garner as being \"notoriously difficult to get away\". Geoff Howarth, one of Surrey's overseas players, was described as \"out of form\" in the Wisden Cricketers' Almanack summary of the match, and scored 16 runs. Early in his innings, the Surrey captain Knight struggled against Somerset's fast-medium pace bowlers; he frequently missed balls which passed outside his off stump, but he settled in against the slower bowlers, and scored 92 runs before being caught behind off the bowling of Garner. In all, Garner collected five wickets; four of them coming towards the end of the innings. He also conceded fourteen runs from his eleven overs, the best economy rate of any bowler in the match; Scyld Berry of The Observer described him as \"the world's most dangerous bowler in the one-day game\". Monte Lynch and Sylvester Clarke both batted more aggressively for Surrey in the afternoon, when the sun helped make scoring a little easier, but neither batted long enough to make a significant impact on the score: Lynch struck a six and two fours during his 22, while Clarke scored 15 before being caught by a diving effort from Popplewell. Surrey completed their 55 overs on 194 for eight, setting Somerset a target of 195 runs to win.", "! scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight: normal; text-align: left;\" | Jack Richards "]}, {"page": "Jack Richards", "response": ["Jack Richards may refer to:", "* Jack Richards (cricketer, born 1958), English cricketer", "* Jack Richards (cricketer, born 1918), English cricketer and British Army officer", "* A Year in the Death of Jack Richards, a 2004 Canadian psychological drama film"]}]}}
