This followed several years of controversy about the MP's stances, including voting with the Conservative Party on key Brexit votes, and outspokenly opposing LGBT+ Inclusive Education in Birmingham schools. Godsiff subsequently declared his intention to stand as an independent candidate. He lost the seat to the Labour Party candidate, Tahir Ali, coming third behind Labour and the Conservatives.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of MPs elected in the 2001 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Roger Godsiff", "| Roger Godsiff"]}, {"page": "Lynne Jones", "response": ["Following boundary changes in Birmingham, which reduced its parliamentary representation from eleven to ten seats, Jones was expected to apply for selection for the redrawn Selly Oak constituency which contained wards from the former Selly Oak and Hall Green constituencies.
