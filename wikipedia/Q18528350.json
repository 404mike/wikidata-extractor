He attended the London School of Economics where he studied under Raymond Firth. He subsequently headed the Department of Social Anthropology at the University of Edinburgh.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "St. Clair Drake", "response": ["Drake spent nearly two years in the United Kingdom, 1947-1948. He conducted his dissertation research in 1947 in Cardiff, Wales, where he studied a community of African seamen and their Welsh families. In \"Value Systems, Social Structure and Race Relations in the British Isles,\" Drake \"examined the forms of social action that arose in response to British racial and colonial domination\". At this time, he was one of the first scholars studying race relations in the British Isles and was considered one of the foremost scholars on the subject. Kenneth Little published his PH.D. thesis,  Negroes in Britain, which was a study of the Black and minority ethnic communities of Cardiff. Drake worked with the Black community of Cardiff, drafting a response in which the local community said they \"distrust people who survey us and study us, who write about us and publicize us, and who try to reform and lead us.\""]}, {"page": "Michael Banton", "response": ["After graduating from the London School of Economics in 1950, Banton conducted research on the settlement of New Commonwealth immigrants in the East End of London for which he received a PhD from the University of Edinburgh, from where he also gained a D.Sc. in inter-group relations in 1964. Here he studied under Kenneth Little at the Anthropology department which Banton noted was called \"Negroes in Britain Industry\". Banton remained at the department and produced three books under Little's supervison: subsequently wrote books about the settlement of rural immigrants in Freetown, Sierra Leone, and on the behaviour of the white British towards New Commonwealth immigrants. His book The Policeman in the Community, a comparative study of policing in Scotland and the United States, was the first book-length sociological study of the police."]}, {"page": "Race relations", "response": ["The concept of race relations became institutionally significant in the United Kingdom through the establishment of the Department of Social Anthropology under the leadership of Kenneth Little at the University of Edinburgh."]}, {"page": "Ralph Piddington", "response": ["In 1946 he was appointed Reader in anthropology at the Department of Mental Philosophy, University of Edinburgh. He accepted the offer by the Auckland University College in October 1949 to chair their new anthropology department, and arrived in Auckland with his wife and son in September 1950. However before he left he encouraged Kenneth Little to take over his position, which lead to the formation of the Department of Social Anthropology at the University of Edinburgh."]}, {"page": "Black people in Cambridge", "response": ["The white British anthropologist Kenneth Little \"had never met a person of African descent\" before studying at Cambridge in the late 1930s. Proceeding to do Cardiff fieldwork for a London School of Economics PhD, he moved away from biological anthropology to focus on the sociology of race relations. What prompted the shift was his experience of the \"colour bar\" in Cardiff, \"a slice of the reality about which my African friends in Cambridge had told me\"."]}]}}
