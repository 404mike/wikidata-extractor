A wicket-keeper, he played for Yorkshire from 1867 to 1880, and for the All-England Eleven from 1867 to 1871. He also umpired in some matches between 1873 and 1880.\nHe was recognised as a fine wicket-keeper, his work to the fast bowlers - at a time when keepers \"stood up\" (i.e. within arm's reach of the wicket) to fast bowling - being particularly impressive. He had plenty of practice, since Tom Emmett was in the same Yorkshire side. He had to deal with Emmett's famous \"sostenuter\", a ball pitching on the leg stump and then breaking sharply towards the off bail. He was renowned for the slickness of his stumpings of batsmen. When Tom Hearne was stumped off a leg-shooter he exclaimed: \"I don't call that stumping; I call it shovelling of 'em in!\"\nHe is believed to have been the first keeper to dispense with a long-stop, during a North v. South match in the mid or late 1870s. The idea came from his captain A. N. Hornby. Pinder was at first reluctant, but the experiment was a success. On another occasion, at The Oval, Ephraim Lockwood who was fielding long-stop said: \"Nay, George, I've been behind thee for twenty-three overs and had nowt to stop. I'm off where there's summat [something] to do.\"\nPinder died in January 1903 in Hickleton, Yorkshire, aged 61.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George F.

Ellison went on to help form Yorkshire County Cricket Club whilst Armitage and Ulyett were selected for England's first Test cricket tour of Australia in 1877. Marsden was for many years the best single wicket cricketer in the north of England and was said to have put up a \u00a350 reward for anyone to beat him. The great southern cricketer of the time, Fuller Pilch, did just that in 1833, beating Marsden in Norwich. When a rematch was organised, over 20,000 crammed into the Old Darnall ground hoping to see Marsden defeated once more. Marsden also scored 227 in a game for Sheffield & Leicester versus Nottingham, at that time only the third double century seen in England. In 1841, Marsden he finally lost his northern single wicket crown to Henry Sampson, another Wednesday player, who later that year scored 162 against Sheffield."]}, {"page": "United North of England Eleven", "response": ["* Roger Iddison (captain), George Freeman, Ephraim Lockwood, George Pinder (wicket-keeper), John Smith, Thomas Bignall, George Atkinson, Joseph Rowbotham, Elisha Rawlinson, Luke Greenwood, George Howitt.", "* Joseph Rowbotham (captain), John Thewlis senior, Charles Ullathorne, George Pinder (wicket-keeper), Ephraim Lockwood, Luke Greenwood, George Ulyett, Tom Emmett, Andrew Greenwood, Tom Armitage, Allen Hill.", "* George Pinder (captain; wicket-keeper), George Ulyett, Ephraim Lockwood, William Oscroft, John Selby, Arthur Shrewsbury, Billy Bates, Tom Emmett, Andrew Greenwood, Tom Armitage, Allen Hill."]}, {"page": "Thomas Plumb", "response": ["Plumb, who was born at Aylesbury, was considered the finest wicket-keeper of his time, with W.

Plumb was never attached to one of the major county teams of the time, playing for Buckinghamshire and Northamptonshire, then second-class counties. He made his debut in first-class cricket for the North in the North v South fixture of 1866. Between 1866 and 1879, he played first-class cricket for no less than eight teams, including for the Players in the 1869 Gentlemen v Players fixture. He also appeared for All-England teams, including the United England Eleven and the All England Eleven. Making 26 first-class appearances, Plumb scored 474 runs at an average of 12.81, with a high score of 67. Behind the stumps, he took 27 catches and made 15 stumpings."]}]}}
