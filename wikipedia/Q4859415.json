She was also known for her \"no bad dogs\" philosophy.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Santa's Little Helper", "response": ["Some ideas for episodes featuring Santa's Little Helper come from reality. The plot of \"Dog of Death\" was based on Swartzwelder's experiences with his own dog, which had also suffered from bloat. However, unlike the events in the episode, Swartzwelder's dog did not receive treatment as the operation was too expensive and the dog was too old. The Gold Coast Bulletins Ryan Ellem commented in 2005 that the Simpson family's dilemma with the cost of the veterinary procedure is a realistic dilemma faced by many families who own dogs. Other episode ideas come from popular culture. For example, Santa's Little Helper fathering 25 puppies in \"Two Dozen and One Greyhounds\" is a parody of the Disney film One Hundred and One Dalmatians, and Mr. Burns' technique of brainwashing him into an attack dog in \"Dog of Death\" parodies A Clockwork Orange. Susan McHugh, who teaches theories of animals, literature, and culture at the University of New England, wrote in her 2004 book Dog that, \"remaining loyal to his unlikely saviours, the boy Bart and his father Homer, this greyhound has prompted satires of contemporary dog culture, from Barbara Woodhouse's authoritarian training methods [in \"Bart's Dog Gets an 'F] to Lassie's flawless service to the status quo [in \"The Canine Mutiny\"].\""]}, {"page": "1954 in literature", "response": ["*Barbara Woodhouse"]}, {"page": "Rickmansworth", "response": ["* Barbara Woodhouse (dog trainer, author, horse trainer and television personality)"]}, {"page": "Croxley Green", "response": ["* Barbara Woodhouse the dog trainer presented Training Dogs the Woodhouse Way on television in the 1980s and lived at Campions from the 1940s to the 1980s.Stephen Follows, \u2018Woodhouse , Barbara Kathleen Vera (1910\u20131988)\u2019, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 20 Dec 2008"]}, {"page": "1910 in Ireland", "response": ["* 9 May \u2013 Barbara Woodhouse, dog trainer (died 1988)."]}, {"page": "The Barron Knights", "response": ["|\"The Sit Song\" (parodying dog trainer Barbara Woodhouse)"]}, {"page": "Dog training", "response": ["The 1980 television series Training Dogs the Woodhouse Way made Barbara Woodhouse a household name in the UK, and the first international celebrity dog trainer.Millan 2010, p. 89.

In addition, the photograph The Falling Soldier by Robert Capa is the third frame in the quilt. When the scene changes to Santa's Little Helper's point of view, a small explosion sound is heard; this sound is used in the film Predator, when the camera switches to Predator's point of view. The dramatic music from the film Jaws is used just before Santa's Little Helper attacks something. The dog obedience school has different categories named after famous dogs, which are Rin Tin Tin, Benji, Toto and the one in which Santa's Little Helper attends, Cujo.
