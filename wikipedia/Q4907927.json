He was a right-arm fast-medium pace bowler and useful middle-order right-handed batsman. He played 226 matches for Somerset between 1930 and 1947 and took 750 wickets at an average of 23.38 and scored 4,833 runs at an average of 15.59.\nAndrews was a tall man (6 ft 3in) with a high arm action, often referred to as \"12 o'clock high\". He kept a good length and generally bowled in swingers to right-handed batsmen. He claimed his high action was modelled on Ted McDonald.\nAlthough he was sacked four times by Somerset, twice as a player and twice as a coach, he put much of his life into the club as player, coach and later on committees and as a supporter. In turn he became one of the most popular players that Somerset have ever had.\nWell to the left in terms of politics he did not fit in well with the clear distinction between Amateurs and Professionals prevalent in the game when he started. He seems to have a particular dislike for Jack White who was his first captain at Somerset and was an Amateur from a different era. It has been conjectured that his forthright views were the reason that he was never selected to play any representative cricket.\nHe was well known for his greeting of \"Shake the hand that bowled Bradman\". He had indeed bowled Bradman in 1938 but it was, of course, a joke since Bradman had scored 202 by that stage and deliberately let himself be bowled. Bradman, who did not start his innings until early on the second day, completed his innings before the tea interval. His second hundred came in just 70 minutes. Andrews autobiography was called \"The Hand that bowled Bradman\". Although not entirely accurate it is a good read.\nThe other great one-liner credited to Andrews was on his Somerset debut in 1930 when he asked the Somerset pro Tom Young: \"Am I the worst cricketer that ever played first-class cricket, Mr. Young?\". Back came the answer: \"No son. There was one worse than you. Trevor Arnott of Glamorgan.\". Trevor Arnott had dismissed Tom Young a number of times in the previous two season perhaps explaining why his name came to mind.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ian Botham", "response": ["Botham went on to Bucklers Mead Comprehensive School in Yeovil, where he continued to do well in sport and played for the school's cricket and football teams. He became captain of their under-16 cricket team when he was thirteen. His performances for the school drew the attention of Somerset County Cricket Club's youth coach Bill Andrews. Still thirteen, he scored 80 runs on debut for Somerset's under-15s side against Wiltshire, but the team captain Phil Slocombe did not call on him to bowl as he considered him to be a specialist batsman.Doust (1981), pp. 36\u201337. Two years later, Botham had the opportunity to choose between football and cricket: Bert Head, manager of Crystal Palace offered him apprentice forms with the First Division club.Doust (1981), pp. 38\u201339. He already had a contract with Somerset and, after discussing the offer with his father, decided to continue to pursue a cricket career, as he believed he was a better cricketer.Murphy (1988), pp. 16\u201317. When informed that he wanted to be a sportsman, Botham's careers teacher said to him: \"Fine, everyone wants to play sport, but what are you really going to do?\""]}, {"page": "Harold Gimblett", "response": ["Gimblett's first run came off his third ball, and shortly afterwards he was hitting the leg-break and googly bowler Peter Smith for 15 in an over. He raced to his 50 in just 28 minutes, off 33 balls, reaching it with a six. Wellard, unusually for him, was outpaced and was out, followed swiftly by Luckes, but Gimblett was joined by Bill Andrews, who also hit powerfully. Gimblett's century came in just 63 minutes, which proved to be the fastest century of the season, and it was made out of 130 runs added while he had been at the wicket. He finished with 123 out of 175 in 80 minutes, with three sixes and 17 fours.Foot, pp. 66\u201368. Somerset won the match with an innings to spare."]}, {"page": "1947 English cricket season", "response": ["Somerset were captained for the only time by educator Jack Meyer but the team did not learn anything and dropped seven places from fourth in 1946 to equal eleventh. Even so, they pulled off some surprises by defeating champions Middlesex twice and inflicting on third-placed Lancashire their only loss of the season. Somerset were let down by their batting with only Harold Gimblett reliable through the season. Michael Walford played very well in the closing weeks when he became available and Playfair called him \"the best amateur batsman in England on a firm wicket\". The main bowler was veteran Arthur Wellard who was supported by all-rounders Bertie Buse and Johnny Lawrence, slow left armer Horace Hazell, captain Meyer and new pace bowler Maurice Tremlett. The veteran Wally Luckes kept wicket and claimed 55 championship victims. Other players were Bill Andrews in his final season, Frank Lee in his final season before becoming an umpire, Hugh Watts, George Woodhouse, Mandy Mitchell-Innes and Miles Coope.Playfair, pp. 104\u2013105."]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Bill Andrews (1930\u20131947) 226 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Horace Fisher", "response": ["He is notable as the first bowler to ever claim a hat trick of LBW victims, in the course of taking 5 for 12 against Somerset at Sheffield in August 1932. Umpire Alex Skelding, after dispatching Mandy Mitchell-Innes for five and then Bill Andrews first ball in the same manner, stared up the wicket at the new man Wally Luckes, when the third appeal was made. After a pregnant pause, he stated, \"As God's my witness, that's out, too\". In the same match, Fisher posted his highest ever first-class score in Yorkshire's only innings, an unbeaten 76, as Yorkshire ran out winners by an innings and 93. Earlier that week Fisher took six wickets for 11 runs, against Leicestershire at Bradford, which remained his best bowling return."]}, {"page": "Wally Luckes", "response": ["He then remained as the regular wicketkeeper for the county up to and beyond the Second World War, standing up at the wicket to all but the fastest deliveries from Arthur Wellard and Bill Andrews and even in his last match, at the age of 48, managing a stumping off the quick bowler Jim Redman.

Players such as Arthur Wellard, Horace Hazell, Wally Luckes and Bill Andrews played as professionals for Somerset for many seasons and developed under Ingle. Ingle, wrote Foot, \"had a gift for what today is rather glibly known as motivation\".

Holmes scored a duck in the first innings in which he batted, and 8 runs in the second, as Somerset lost the match by a wide margin.

He provided good support for Allan Jones and Tom Cartwright, taking 19 one-day wickets at 20.26 in his first season.  A particularly strong one-day bowler, Moseley led Somerset in wickets in the John Player League in 1973, 1975, 1977, 1978, 1980 and 1982, never quite showing the consistency needed to break into a West Indies squad already full of pacy seam bowlers."]}, {"page": "Laurie Hawkins", "response": ["It was against Nottinghamshire again that Hawkins played his next significant innings: in the 1932 match, batting at No 9, he made an unbeaten 63 and shared a last-wicket partnership of 67 with Bill Andrews.

This innings propelled Hawkins temporarily up the Somerset batting to a middle-order position, and it was from there, less than three weeks later, that he made his highest first-class score, 96 against Middlesex at Lord's, sharing a seventh wicket stand of 125 with Jack White that enabled Somerset to save a game where they had trailed by 207 on the first innings."]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club seasons", "response": ["|align=left|Bill Andrews"]}, {"page": "Louis Powell", "response": ["Powell also played rugby union for Bath and for Somerset.
