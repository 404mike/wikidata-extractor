After flying from Hong Kong to Mongolia, he set off on foot from the Gobi Desert town of Sainshand. He then walked for the following six and a half months, 3,500 miles back to Hong Kong. National Geographic commissioned a TV series about the journey (which was subsequently premiered on the Nat Geo Adventure Channel in December 2013), and so Lilwall also took a cameraman with him on the expedition, the young Northern Irish adventurer Leon McCarron. They endured temperatures down to minus thirty and severe physical hardship as they covered the huge distances with heavy packs. Lilwall wrote a weekly column for the South China Morning Post as he walked, and was given an advance book deal from his previous publisher, Hodder & Stoughton, with publication of the new book in 2013 in the UK, and subsequently translated into German and Chinese. The DVD of the TV series is available from Lilwall."]}, {"page": "Rupert Clague", "response": ["In November 2018, with support from Shure, Rupert directed Sounds of the Sunset with adventurer Leon McCarron, a film about the Sunset Limited train that runs from New Orleans, Louisiana to Los Angeles, California in the United States."]}]}}
