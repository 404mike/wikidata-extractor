The world's first radio distress signal was transmitted by the East Goodwin lightvessel's radio operator on 17 March 1899, after the merchant vessel Elbe ran aground on the Goodwins, while on 30 April that year, the East Goodwin vessel transmitted a distress signal on its own behalf, when the SS R. F. Matthews rammed it in a dense fog. Safety was further improved by the development of more powerful lamps and through the replacement by foghorns of the gongs previously used as fog signals."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1885 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Edward Birkbeck "]}, {"page": "East Norfolk (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Sir Edward Birkbeck"]}, {"page": "Horstead Hall", "response": ["Owners included the Batcheler family (18th century), the Suffields, who rebuilt the house, and latterly the Birkbecks.
