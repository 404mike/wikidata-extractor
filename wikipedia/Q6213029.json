At their manager's suggestion, they saw Kelli Ali (then known as Kelli Dayton) performing in a pub with her band The Lumieres, and invited her to sing on some demos, including an early version of \"6 Underground\". She soon joined the band, and the demos won the group a contract with Virgin Records.
