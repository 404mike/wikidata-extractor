Twice a Northern Ireland B international, he went on to win 18 senior caps for Northern Ireland. He began his career at Hartlepool United in 1987, before heading into the non-league scene with Shepshed Charterhouse in 1989. He returned to the professional game the following year after signing a contract with York City. He spent the next five years with the club, helping York to promotion via the play-offs in 1993, and twice being voted Clubman of the Year. In 1995, he joined Port Vale for a \u00a3450,000 fee. In his first year at Vale Park he was awarded the club's Player of the Year award, and also played in the Anglo-Italian Cup final.\nIn 1997, he was sold on to Birmingham City for \u00a31.5 million. The highlight of a five-year injury-plagued stay in Birmingham would be a League Cup final appearance in 2001. The next year he was loaned out to Sheffield Wednesday, before a return to Port Vale was followed by a brief spell with Doncaster Rovers and a cameo return at York City. Settling with Carlisle United, he left the Football League in 2003 to play for non-League Hucknall Town. Hucknall were crowned Northern Premier League Premier Division champions in 2003\u201304, and following this success he won a deal with Northwich Victoria. He helped the club to the Conference North title in 2005\u201306, before he retired in 2007. He was appointed as first team coach at Chester in January 2014, and after a brief spell as caretaker, became manager of the club in May 2016, before he was sacked in September 2017. He then joined Southport for a four year spell as assistant manager, before he was appointed assistant manager at Connah's Quay Nomads in October 2021.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John McCarthy", "response": ["* Jon McCarthy (born 1970), English former professional footballer "]}, {"page": "Nottingham Trent University", "response": ["* Jon McCarthy \u2013 Footballer"]}, {"page": "Shepshed Dynamo F.C.", "response": ["* Jon McCarthy"]}, {"page": "Brian Horton", "response": ["The club entered a financial crisis following the collapse of ITV Digital, which cost the club \u00a3400,000 in revenue.

Vale beat rivals Stoke City, but ended the season in 14th-place. Horton was named as Manager of the Month after his team earned 13 points from a possible 18 in February. Horton signed Jon McCarthy, Brett Angell, Ian Brightwell, Phil Charnock, Sam Collins, and Mark Boyd for the 2002\u201303 campaign. Four straight defeats were followed by five consecutive victories, as he supplemented his squad with the additions of Lee Ashcroft, Peter Clarke and Adrian Littlejohn. Though relegation was avoided, Horton still remained unpopular with some sections of the Vale's supporters.

Both men would prove to be good buys, Naylor being a three time top scorer. At the end of the season, Van der Laan was sold to Derby County for \u00a3475,000 plus Lee Mills. \u00a3450,000 of this sum was reinvested in York City midfielder Jon McCarthy. \u00a350,000 was also spent on midfielder Ian Bogie."]}, {"page": "Gareth Ainsworth", "response": ["In September 1997 he signed for John Rudge's First Division Port Vale for a club record \u00a3500,000 fee; he was signed to replace Jon McCarthy and Steve Guppy, wingers who had been sold for a combined \u00a32.35 million earlier in the year. He became the club's Player of the Year for his performances in the 1997\u201398 season, helping the \"Valiants\" to narrowly avoid relegation above Manchester City and local rivals Stoke City. He was though criticized for an 'ugly' tackle on Sheffield United's Dane Whitehouse in November that resulted in the player's early retirement due to a serious leg injury sustained from the challenge. The club turned down a \u00a31 million bid from Leeds United in summer 1998.
