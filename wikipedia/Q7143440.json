Northwich lost their Football League status in 1894, and Finnerhan joined Manchester City in the close season. He made his Manchester City debut in the opening match of the 1894-95 season, a 4-2 Second Division defeat to Bury. He scored his first goal for the club on 8 September 1894 against Burslem Port Vale. He played in every Manchester City match that season, finishing as the club's leading scorer with 15 goals. In October 1894 Manchester City signed Finnerhan's former Northwich strike partner Billy Meredith.\nIn March 1897, having made 89 appearances for Manchester City, Finnerhan transferred to Liverpool. He made eight appearances for Liverpool, scoring one goal, against Wolverhampton Wanderers. He then moved to Bristol City of the Southern League.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Billy Meredith", "response": ["Meredith made his Manchester City debut in November 1894 in a 5\u20134 loss to Newcastle United. The following week he played his first home match for the club at Hyde Road, and scored two goals against Newton Heath\u00a0\u2013 who later became Manchester United\u00a0\u2013 in the first Manchester derby to take place in the league. Newton Heath won the match 5\u20132. He turned professional in January 1895, and ended the 1894\u201395 season with 12 goals in 18 appearances, just three strikes behind top-scorer Pat Finnerhan, who had played an extra 12 games.", "In his first full season at Manchester City, Meredith finished as top scorer. He was appointed club captain in his second season at the club, aged just 21. The club finished as Second Division runners-up in 1895\u201396, but were denied promotion after heavy defeats to West Bromwich Albion and Small Heath in the test matches. After the departure of strike partner Pat Finnerhan to Liverpool in March 1897, Meredith remained as City's star player."]}, {"page": "List of Manchester City F.C. seasons", "response": ["| align=\"left\" |Pat Finnerhan"]}, {"page": "Northwich Victoria F.C.", "response": ["A great leap forward was taken in 1892, when Northwich became one of the founding members of the English Second Division, which saw the team turn professional. In the league's inaugural season, Northwich finished 7th, the highest finish in the club's history. It was during the latter stages of this season that Northwich acquired the services of Billy Meredith, the Welsh International, who is widely regarded as the first football superstar. At Northwich, he teamed up with Pat Finnerhan, a regular for the Northwich team for the past few seasons, and a player whom Meredith would spend more time with when both joined Manchester City in 1894. It was said by many that \"Finnerhan made Meredith\". Northwich would remain a professional team for one further season, 1893\u201394, during which they defeated Newcastle United 5\u20133 at the Drill Field, a game where Meredith scored his first hat-trick for the club. Another notable result was holding Woolwich Arsenal (now known as Arsenal F.C.) to a 2\u20132 draw at the Drill Field. However, as a result of their final position at the bottom of the league, the club's board decided not to apply for re-election to the Football League at the end of the season. The financial burden of professional football had taken its toll on the club, which decided to return to strictly amateur, regional football in their first and previous league, The Combination, where they had a mixture of mid-table and top-half finishes up to the 1898 season, when they left the league."]}, {"page": "Bob Milarvie", "response": ["He left Derby in 1890 to sign with Newton Heath, he played four games for the club in the Football Alliance before moving on to neighbours Ardwick the following year.

The club were then elected into the Football League Second Division, and Milarvie made 19 appearances in 1892\u201393.
