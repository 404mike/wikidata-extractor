The 1930 French Grand Prix, held at Pau back down in the south was one of the more memorable French Grands Prix of the pre-World War II period. This race, held in September on a one-off triangular 9.8mile (15.8-km) public road circuit just a few kilometres away from the current Pau Grand Prix track saw a special supercharged version of the famous Bentley 4\u00bd Litre called the Blower Bentley compete in the race with Briton and \"Bentley Boy\" Tim Birkin driving. The Bentley team had been dominating the famed 24 Hours of Le Mans, and this Blower Bentley had its headlights and mudguards removed, as these were not needed for this race, giving it the appearance of an open-wheel car. The Bentley, which was much larger and heavier than the small Bugattis around it performed well \u2013 at this very fast circuit which was made up of very long straights and tight hairpins actually suited the powerful Blower Bentley, and it enabled Birkin to pass the pits at 130 mph (208\u00a0km/h) (very fast for that time), and he overtook car after car \u2013 to the amazement of the crowd. But he finished second to Frenchman Philippe \u00c9tancelin in a Bugatti."]}, {"page": "Bentley Arnage", "response": ["This Arnage was renamed the Arnage Green Label for the 2000 model year.
