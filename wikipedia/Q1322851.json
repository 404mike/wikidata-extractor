In his official dispatch, the British admiral wrote that \"If the Enemy had not been protected and sheltered by the Land, I have every reason to believe that a much greater Number, if not all the Line of Battle ships, would have been taken or destroyed\", going on note that \"When the ships struck, the British squadron was near to some Batteries [on Groix], and in the Face of a strong Naval Port [Lorient]. His subsequent concern for the Quiberon expeditionary convoy also demonstrates that he considered its protection his principal duty. But in the opinion of French admiral Kerguelen, \"S'ils avaient bien manouevr\u00e9, ils auraient pu, ou prendre tous nos vaisseaux, ou les faire p\u00e9rir \u00e0 la c\u00f4te\" (If [the English] had manoeuvred successfully they could have taken all our vessels, or made them perish on the coast). Historians have considered this view and most agree that Bridport's retirement was premature: In 1827 James noted that the scattered remains of the French fleet could easily have been attacked by the unengaged British rear with the advantage of the weather gage, while William Laird Clowes wrote in 1901 that \"We may be pretty sure that had a Nelson, a Hawke or even a Boscawen commanded on the occasion, the fleet of Villaret would have been annihilated.\" Twenty-first-century historians Noel Mostert and Richard Woodman have compared Groix with the battles of Genoa and Hy\u00e8res fought during the year in the Mediterranean, where in similar circumstances another elderly admiral, William Hotham, had also allowed scattered and retreating French fleets to escape when they might have been destroyed.Mostert, p. 164Woodman, p. 61"]}, {"page": "Battle of the Basque Roads", "response": ["The battle was undoubtedly a victory for the British; three French ships of the line, a fourth-rate and a frigate were destroyed and much of the remainder of the Brest fleet badly damaged and requiring extensive repairs; Oc\u00e9an and Foudroyant were in a particularly poor state. French casualties in the engagement are not known with certainty, but are estimated at 150\u2013200, while British losses were only 13 killed and 30 wounded. Allemand later wrote that most significant damage resulting from the battle was to the morale of the French fleet; he wrote that \"the greater part are disheartened; every day I hear them lamenting their situation, and speaking in praise of their enemy.\"James, p. 130 Another French commentator told a British officer that the French sailors \"had now no security from the English in their harbours, and they expected we should next go into Brest and take out their fleet\".Cordingly, p. 204 No British ships suffered more than minor damage in the two weeks of combat, and the fleet could return to its blockade with the knowledge that the Brest fleet was neutralised for some time to come and confined to Rochefort, although a powerful squadron was still under construction at Rochefort, where the defences had been swiftly repaired.James, p. 129 This was the last time during the Napoleonic Wars that a significant French fleet was able to put to sea from the Atlantic ports; historian Richard Woodman describes it as the \"biggest scare from a break-out French fleet in the post-Trafalgar period.\" Without naval support, the French colonies in the Caribbean were isolated, blockaded, invaded and captured shortly afterwards."]}, {"page": "Operation Berlin (Atlantic)", "response": ["Writing in 1954, the British official historian Stephen Roskill stated that Operation Berlin \"had been skilfully planned, well co-ordinated with the movements of other raiders and successfully sustained by the supply ships sent out for that purpose\" and that the Germans were correct to be pleased with its outcomes. He also noted that the operations conducted by German surface raiders in the North Atlantic between February and March 1941 was the only period in the war in which surface warships were able to \"threaten the whole structure of our maritime control\". In contrast, the British naval historian Richard Woodman judged in 2004 that Operation Berlin did not have significant strategic implications as L\u00fctjens was unable to cripple Allied shipping in the North Atlantic and only attacked a single eastbound HX convoy. Angus Konstam noted in 2021 that the number of ships sunk by German surface raiders was dwarfed by those accounted for by submarines. He concluded that the strategy of sending surface raiders into the Atlantic was faulty as the resources required to build and crew these ships would have produced better results if they had been allocated to the submarine force instead."]}, {"page": "Operation Stoneage", "response": ["Stephen Roskill, the official historian of the Royal Navy, wrote in 1962 that the arrival of Stoneage ended the two-year siege of Malta. Submarines were transferred from Magic Carpet rides to offensive operations and at the end of November, 821 Naval Air Squadron (Fairey Albacores) transferred to Malta, as did Force K with the cruisers Dido and Euryalus and four fleet destroyers; a Motor Torpedo Boat flotilla arrived soon after. Another cruiser and destroyer force began to operate from B\u00f4ne in Algeria, which from 1 December, enabled the Navy to attack Axis convoys to Tunisia from both directions. In 2003, Richard Woodman wrote that Stoneage delivered  of supplies, which advanced the deadline at which Malta would be compelled to surrender for lack of supplies to mid-December. The Eighth Army had expelled the Axis forces from Egypt and Cyrenaica, having entered Benghazi on 20 November. In Tunisia, the First Army was about  from Bizerta, preparing for its next advance. Allied success on land made convoy operations much safer and Operation Portcullis, the next Malta convoy, arrived safely on 5 December."]}, {"page": "John Schank", "response": ["Schank appears in Richard Woodman's book A King's Cutter.Richard Woodman, A King's Cutter, Sheridan House, 2001"]}, {"page": "Operation Harpoon (1942)", "response": ["In 2003, Richard Woodman wrote that on 16 June, Harwood reported that,"]}, {"page": "John Coakley Lettsom", "response": ["Richard Woodman attributes similar words to the fictional naval surgeon Mr Lettsom in The Bomb Vessel:The Bomb Vessel by Richard Woodman.
