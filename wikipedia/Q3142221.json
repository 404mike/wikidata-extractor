He also represented the Scotland national football team on one occasion against Austria at Hampden Park. Glasgow.\nBaird started his professional playing career aged 21 with Scottish Football League side Airdrieonians, whom he joined from Dalry Thistle. A striker, he quickly gained a reputation as a prolific goal scorer. In 1957 Leeds United signed him for \u00a312,000 but he only stayed one season in England. In 1958 Aberdeen paid a then club record transfer fee of \u00a311,500 to ensure his return north. He stayed with Aberdeen until 1962 making 86 appearances for the Dons.\nBaird continued playing football for another 5 years following his departure from Pittodrie, enjoying a very brief spell with Brechin City and not featuring in the Brechin first team, before moving into the Highland Football League for longer spells with Deveronvale FC, the Banff Highland League Club, followed by a three-year spell at Rothes FC on Speyside, Morayshire, before retiring from football, aged 36, to become a bricklayer. Both Highland League clubs were in convenient rail commuting distance from his home in Aberdeen where he had settled following his transfer from Leeds United, and where he lived with his family until his death in June 2006 at 76 years of age.\nBaird made one appearance for the Scottish national side in May 1956 at Hampden Park against Austria. He only received an international cap in 2006, after a successful campaign was started by Gary Imlach calling for his father and other affected players (including Baird) to receive caps. Until the early 1970s, the SFA did not award caps to players for matches other than those in the British Home Championship.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2005\u201306 in Scottish football", "response": ["*19 June: Hugh Baird, 76, Airdrie, Aberdeen and Scotland forward."]}, {"page": "Dalry Thistle F.C.", "response": ["*Hugh Baird - Airdrie, Leeds United, Aberdeen and Scotland"]}, {"page": "Deaths in June 2006", "response": ["*Hugh Baird, 76, Scottish footballer for Leeds United, Aberdeen, Airdrieonians and Scotland."]}, {"page": "1930 in association football", "response": ["* March 14 \u2013 Hugh Baird, Scottish international footballer"]}]}}
