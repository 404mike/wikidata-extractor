He explored Mesoamerica in the mid 19th century with writer John Lloyd Stephens. Their books, Incidents of Travel in Central America, Chiapas and Yucat\u00e1n and Incidents of Travel in Yucat\u00e1n, were best sellers and introduced to the Western world the civilization of the ancient Maya. In 1837, Catherwood was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Honorary member.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Chiapas", "response": ["The largest and best-known archaeological sites in Chiapas belong to the Mayan civilization.

In the mid-19th century, John Lloyd Stephens and Frederick Catherwood traveled though the sites in Chiapas and other Mayan areas and published their writings and illustrations. This led to serious work on the culture including the deciphering of its hieroglyphic writing.Hamnett, p. 32."]}, {"page": "February 27", "response": ["*  1799   \u2013 Frederick Catherwood, British artist, architect and explorer (d. 1854)"]}, {"page": "Glyph", "response": ["The word glyph first came to widespread European attention with the engravings and lithographs from Frederick Catherwood's drawings of undeciphered glyphs of the Maya civilization in the early 1840s."]}, {"page": "Palenque", "response": ["Starting in 1832 Jean Frederic Waldeck spent two years at Palenque making numerous drawings, but most of his work was not published until 1866.

The letter was written by Diego Garc\u00eda de Palacio, a member of the Royal Audience of Guatemala, to king Philip II of Spain. French explorer Jean-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Waldeck visited the site in the early 19th century and spent a month there drawing the ruins. Colonel Juan Galindo led an expedition to the ruins in 1834 on behalf of the government of Guatemala and wrote articles about the site for English, French and North American publications. John Lloyd Stephens and Frederick Catherwood visited Cop\u00e1n and included a description, map and detailed drawings in Stephens' Incidents of Travel in Central America, Chiapas and Yucat\u00e1n, published in 1841. The site was later visited by British archaeologist Alfred Maudslay. Several expeditions sponsored by the Peabody Museum of Harvard University worked at Cop\u00e1n during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including the 1892\u20131893 excavation of the Hieroglyphic Stairway by John G. Owens and George Byron Gordon. The Carnegie Institution also sponsored work at the site in conjunction with the government of Honduras."]}, {"page": "Tikal", "response": ["As is often the case with huge ancient ruins, knowledge of the site was never completely lost in the region. It seems that local people never forgot about Tikal and they guided Guatemalan expeditions to the ruins in the 1850s. Some second- or third-hand accounts of Tikal appeared in print starting in the 17th century, continuing through the writings of John Lloyd Stephens in the early 19th century (Stephens and his illustrator Frederick Catherwood heard rumors of a lost city, with white building tops towering above the jungle, during their 1839-40 travels in the region). Because of the site's remoteness from modern towns, however, no explorers visited Tikal until Modesto M\u00e9ndez and Ambrosio Tut, respectively the commissioner and the governor of Pet\u00e9n, visited it in 1848. Artist Eusebio Lara accompanied them and their account was published in Germany in 1853. Several other expeditions came to further investigate, map, and photograph Tikal in the 19th century (including Alfred P. Maudslay in 1881-82) and the early 20th century. Pioneering archeologists started to clear, map and record the ruins in the 1880s."]}, {"page": "John Lloyd Stephens", "response": ["Stephens and his travelling companion, architect and draftsman Frederick Catherwood first came across Maya ruins at Cop\u00e1n, having landed in British Honduras (now Belize). They were astonished at their findings and spent two weeks mapping the site. Stephens surmised that it must have been built by some long-forgotten people, as he could not imagine it was the native Mayans; however, Catherwood noted the facial resemblance to modern Mayans. Stephens was actually able to buy the city of Copan for a sum of $50 and had dreams of floating it down the river and into museums in the United States."]}, {"page": "Quirigu\u00e1", "response": ["The first European visitor to publish an account of Quirigu\u00e1 was English architect and artist Frederick Catherwood, who reached the ruins in 1840.

The elder Pay\u00e9s had recently died and passed the land to his sons and, since neither Meiney nor Pay\u00e9s' sons had visited the land containing the ruins, they invited John Lloyd Stephens and Catherwood to join them on their first trip to the site. Stephens had other duties to attend to, but Catherwood was able to accompany the Pay\u00e9s brothers to Quirigu\u00e1.Kelly 1996, p.243. Due to adverse conditions he was only able to stay a short time at the ruins, but made drawings of two of the stelae, which were published with a short account of Catherwood's visit in John Lloyd Stephens's book Incidents of Travel in Central America, Chiapas, and Yucatan in 1841.

D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Charnay took a series of photographs of Uxmal in 1860. Some three years later Empress Carlota of Mexico visited Uxmal; in preparation for her visit local authorities had some statues and architectural elements depicting phallic themes removed from the ancient fa\u00e7ades."]}, {"page": "Izamal", "response": ["Five huge Pre-Columbian structures are still easily visible at Izamal (and two from some distance away in all directions). The first is a great pyramid to the Maya Sun god, Kinich Kak Moo (macaw of the solar fire face) with a base covering over 2 acres (8,000 m2) of ground and a volume of some 700,000 cubic meters.  Atop this grand base is a pyramid of ten levels.  To the south-east lies another great temple, called Itzamatul, and placed at the south of what was a main plaza, another huge building, called Ppap Hol Chak, was partially destroyed with the construction of a Franciscan temple during the 16th century. left|thumb|200px|Izamal, colossal Maya stucco head set in a wall, after Catherwood The south-west side of the plaza is partially limited by another pyramid, the Hun Pik Tok, and in the west lie the remains of the temple known as Kabul, where a great stucco mask still existed on one side as recently as the 1840s, as seen in a colored lithograph after a drawing by Frederick Catherwood.

In 1865, the French architect Cesar Daly mapped the five clustered sites that include Q\u02bcumarkaj, although the maps have since been lost. A more detailed survey of the site was made by Alfred P.

As they arrived from the sea, Stephens and Catherwood first saw a tall building that impressed them greatly, most likely the great Castillo of the site. They made accurate maps of the site's walls, and Catherwood made sketches of the Castillo and several other buildings. Stephens and Catherwood also reported an early classic stele at the site, with an inscribed date of AD 564 (now in the British Museum's collection).
