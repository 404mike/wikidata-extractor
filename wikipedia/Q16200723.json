John Broomhall composed the music while Andrew Parton handled the sound effects. There were also major contributors who were not acknowledged in the game's credits, such as the designer Steve Hand, a Laser Squad fan who helped the project get signed, put input into the \"big game\" concept, actually came up with the name X-COM (derived from Mike Brunton's initial idea of X-CON, where \"CON\" originally stood for \"contact\"), and helped to define the comic book-like art style. Hand thought the original design document was poorly written, especially regarding the initial, more interactive and action-oriented UFO interception system; nevertheless, the final game turned out to be very close to it. Certain creature types deemed \"boring\" were removed during the development, as were the Men in Black, who were unused due to a perceived conflict with MicroProse's abortive project to make an MIB-themed standalone game.Dan Griliopoulos, Julian Gollop interview: on X-Coms old and new, the Ghost Recon strategy game that never was, AI, auteurs and \u201cFork My Fruit\u201d, PC Gamer, April 29, 2013", "Category:Video games scored by John Broomhall"]}, {"page": "Chris Sawyer's Locomotion", "response": ["Category:Video games scored by John Broomhall"]}, {"page": "Grand Prix 2", "response": ["Category:Video games scored by John Broomhall"]}, {"page": "Formula One Grand Prix (video game)", "response": ["Category:Video games scored by John Broomhall"]}, {"page": "The Legacy: Realm of Terror", "response": ["Category:Video games scored by John Broomhall"]}, {"page": "B-17 Flying Fortress (video game)", "response": ["Category:Video games scored by John Broomhall"]}, {"page": "Fields of Glory", "response": ["Category:Video games scored by John Broomhall"]}, {"page": "Dogfight (video game)", "response": ["Category:Video games scored by John Broomhall"]}, {"page": "New International Track & Field", "response": ["Category:Video games scored by John Broomhall"]}, {"page": "XCOM: Enemy Unknown", "response": ["The interface team was split into halves to develop separate GUIs for the PC and console releases.
