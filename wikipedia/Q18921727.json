In their memoir Level 4: Virus Hunters of the CDC (1996), former CDC scientists Joseph B. McCormick and Susan Fisher-Hoch lambasted Preston for claiming that Ebola dissolves organs, stating that although it causes great blood loss in tissues the organs remain structurally intact. McCormick and Fisher-Hoch also dispute Preston's version of the CDC's actions in the Reston virus incident. In an interview about his book Ebola: The Natural and Human History of a Deadly Virus (2014), David Quammen claimed that The Hot Zone had \"vivid, gruesome details\" that gave an \"exaggerated idea of Ebola over the years\" causing \"people to view this disease as though it was some sort of preternatural phenomenon\".Michaeleen Doucleff (November 11, 2014) How 'The Hot Zone' Got It Wrong And Other Tales Of Ebola's History NPR.org Retrieved March 16, 2020"]}, {"page": "Susan P.
