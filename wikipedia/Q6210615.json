Stoke's first win of the season came away at West Bromwich Albion when Harry Davies scored the only goal in his second appearance. Again the director's ambition and determination to maintain First Division status showed through with the arrivals of Joe Kasher and Bert Ralphs to name a few.  This belated heavy expenditure on players cost the finance's dearly, but good crowds were able to cover the cost. Unfortunately relegation was not avoided and Stoke made an instant return to the Second Division.", "|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Joe Kasher"]}, {"page": "1923\u201324 Stoke F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Joe Kasher"]}]}}
