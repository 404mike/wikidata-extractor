Strawbs still retain a great fan-base today in the US and Canada. Hero And Heroine went platinum in Canada, and both albums sold extremely well in the US too.  A further album, Nomadness, recorded without Hawken, was less successful, and was their last for A&M Records.", "\"Lambert Cronk\" also released an album in April 2007 entitled Touch the Earth, on which former Strawbs drummer Tony Fernandez and former Strawbs keyboard player  Andy Richards both play.
