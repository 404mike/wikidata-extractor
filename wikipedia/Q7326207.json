Hakluyt's father, also named Richard Hakluyt, was a member of the Worshipful Company of Skinners whose members dealt in skins and furs. He died in 1557 when his son was aged about five years, and his wife Margery followed soon after. Hakluyt's cousin, also named Richard Hakluyt, of the Middle Temple, became his guardian.", "In the late 1590s Hakluyt became the client and personal chaplain of Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury, Lord Burghley's son, who was to be Hakluyt's most fruitful patron. Hakluyt dedicated to Cecil the second (1599) and third volumes (1600) of the expanded edition of Principal Navigations and also his edition of Galv\u00e3o's Discoveries (1601). Cecil, who was the principal Secretary of State to Elizabeth I and James I, rewarded him by installing him as prebendary of the Dean and Chapter of Westminster on 4 May 1602.According to Jones's introduction to Hakluyt's Divers Voyages, above, Hakluyt succeeded Dr. Richard Webster as prebendary of Westminster Abbey about 1605. In the following year, he was elected archdeacon of the Abbey. These religious occupations have occasioned reconsideration of the role played by spiritual concerns in Hakluyt's writings on exploration, settlement, and England's relations with its Catholic rivals.David Harris Sacks, \"Richard Hakluyt's Navigations in Time: History, Epic, and Empire,\" Modern Language Quarterly 67 (2006): 31\u201362; David A.

His travels are attested in the writings of Richard Hakluyt, who documented the ill-fated expedition. Apart from his famous journey and its immediate aftermath, little is known about the life of Richard Hore.", "One of the few contemporary accounts of Richard Hore's life is contained in The Principal Navigations, Voyages, Traffiques and Discoveries of the English Nation, a late 16th century history by Richard Hakluyt. Master Hore, described as \"a man of goodly stature and of great courage\" who was \"given to the studie of Cosmographie,\" succeeded in attracting a number of gentlemen interested in visiting the North American coast. According to Hakluyt, the expedition was to set out on two ships: the Trinity, captained by Hore himself, and the Minion, upon which sailed men such as Armigil Wade. Hakluyt derived his narrative from two sources: the testimony of Thomas Butts, son of William Butts, and Oliver Dawbeny. Dawbeny, who sailed on the Minion, had been interviewed by Hakluyt's cousin, Richard Hakluyt of the Middle Temple, while Thomas Butts, who had sailed on the Trinity, was very old when he was interviewed personally by Hakluyt as the last surviving witness to the voyage.", "Richard Hakluyt's account of the voyage of Richard Hore has been closely scrutinized by skeptical historians. E. G. R. Taylor discovered court records of a lawsuit brought against Hore by the merchant William Dolphyn, who was seeking redress for breach of contract and whose ship had been chartered for the voyage by Hore. The lawsuit, which makes no mention of undue hardships, identifies Hore's second ship as the William of London and not Minion, a probable error on Hakluyt's part. Later documents on Richard Hore detailed further legal troubles, as he had gained control of a ship called the Valentine in 1537 and within the next year was investigated for allegedly kidnapping some Portuguese subjects and then was found to be in debt to one Sir Thomas Spent. Few primary sources related to Richard Hore are extant; the memoirs written by Armigil Wade have evidently been lost."]}, {"page": "Ninnimissinuok", "response": ["For nearly a century before the landing of the Mayflower in 1620, the Ninnimissinuok sporadically experienced direct contact by European explorers and for decades before that the indirect consequences of European cod fishermen off the Newfoundland banks. The effect of these early encounters was profound. First, and more immediately catastrophic, Europeans brought a variety of diseases for which the aboriginal population had no resistance. When the English settlers arrived, they discovered that vast swaths of Southern New England, previously prepared for cultivation and settlement by extensive deforestation and land preparation was devoid of all inhabitants.; . Second, more gradual but equally profound for the economic and social conditions of the Natives, the \"Fur Trade\" engaged in at first by the Newfoundland fishermen, and later, more systematically by the French and English, destroyed the previously existing continental intertribal pattern of exchange in which the Natives traded local products in a system of extensive and peaceful commerce. That system was replaced by an economy driven by the demand of the Europeans for one product (animal pelts). The new economy resulted in intense intertribal rivalries and hostilities, which eventually allowed the English to play one off against the other. In addition to contributing to the first two causes of calamity, the English created immense ill-will and eventually hostilities by their aggressive approach to settlement, the brutality of which was apparent even before the first settlers. This was the result of the system the English employed which depended exclusively on private profiteers. Richard Hakluyt made plain the goals that the entrepreneurs would pursue in an \"inducement\" he wrote in 1585: \"The ends of this voyage are these: 1, to plant the Christian religion; 2, To trafficke; 3, To conquer; Or, to do all three.\" The first goal was never seriously pursued."]}]}}
