Experienced producers Clive Langer and Alan Winstanley were drafted in to replace him. Unlike Hardiman, who had taken a hands-off approach, Langer and Winstanley made more suggestions during the recording process, which the Commotions didn't always agree with. Langer asked Cole to control the vibrato in his voice, which Cole had no idea how to do as it was his natural way of singing, and as a result he became self-conscious about his singing. Reflecting in 2004 on the process of recording Easy Pieces, Cole felt that they had been pushed into making a second record too quickly: \"We didn't give ourselves time to step back and think. The record company was telling us 'this is your moment and you must take it now' \u2013 which is crap. People would have waited for us.
