Hay's film was widely seen as subversive towards authority, and it was granted an 'A' (adult) certificate by the British Board of Film Classification. Boys Will Be Boys is widely regarded as Hay's break-out film. Writing for The Spectator, Graham Greene described the film as \"very amusing\", and Hay's portrayal of Dr. Smart as \"competent\", though Green thought Claude Dampier's portrayal of Second Master Finch (Hay's adversary) was the film's \"finest performance\". (reprinted in: ) Many years later, the Radio Times Guide to Films gave Boys Will Be Boys three stars out of five, observing that the film contains \"the blend of bluster and dishonesty that makes his films irresistible\".Radio Times Guide to Films (2004). p.187"]}, {"page": "Jack Hylton", "response": ["By the time the Depression started biting in 1930, Hylton downsized his band and began performing in Europe less frequently; that same year, however, Maurice Chevalier recorded with Hylton, who also made the first record of \"Body and Soul\" and Pat O'Malley replaced Browne as vocalist. In 1930 they recorded Amy, Wonderful Amy, a song about Amy Johnson. Hylton also became a director and major shareholder of the new Decca record label, switching from HMV in late 1931. The following year he was decorated by the French government, recorded with Paul Robeson, and made the first transatlantic entertainment broadcast with Paul Whiteman and his orchestra. In late 1933, Hylton left Decca after refusing to take a pay cut, not making records until 1935 when he rejoined HMV.
