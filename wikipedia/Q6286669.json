In addition, he represented Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in 1856; the North 1857\u201375; the All-England Eleven (AEE) 1862\u201368; the Players 1864\u201369; an England XI in 1864; the combined Cambridgeshire and Yorkshire team in 1864; the combined Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire team in 1872; the United North of England Eleven (UNEE) 1870\u201375; and the Players of the North 1874\u201376).  He played in minor and odds matches in 1865 on tour with the AEE.\nRowbotham was born in Highfield, Sheffield; died in Morecambe. He was Yorkshire's captain in 1873 and 1875. In 141 first-class matches, he scored 3,694 runs at 15.92, with three centuries and a highest score of 113 against Surrey. An occasional wicketkeeper, he held seventy catches and completed five stumpings. He also took three wickets for 37 against Gloucestershire in his only first-class bowling spell.\nHe umpired in one Test Match: England versus Australia at Manchester from 10 to 12 July 1884.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Yorkshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["In 1865, the club and players became involved in a dispute. Five players \u2013 Roger Iddison, George Anderson, George Atkinson, Joseph Rowbotham and Ned Stephenson \u2013 refused to play against Surrey. This concerned a controversy that arose in 1862 when Iddison and Anderson played for an All-England team against Surrey at The Oval and the Kent bowler Edgar Willsher was repeatedly no-balled for using an overarm action by an umpire whom, they claimed, had been appointed by Surrey specifically for that purpose. Anderson stated in 1865 that he \"would not play against those who have combined to sweep us from the cricket field altogether if they could\".", "With the player dispute resolved, Yorkshire won all seven of their matches in 1867, defeating Surrey, Lancashire and Cambridgeshire. As a result, the sporting press proclaimed Yorkshire to be the \"Champion County\" for the first time. The following year, John Thewlis scored the first century for Yorkshire in first-class cricket, against Surrey at The Oval; in 1869, Joseph Rowbotham became the first man to score two centuries in a season for Yorkshire. Yorkshire won four games in both 1868 and 1869; one sports publication regarded Yorkshire as equal champions in the latter year. The team won six out of seven in 1870 to be acclaimed as Champion County again. Much of Yorkshire's success in these years came from the bowling combination of George Freeman and Tom Emmett.", "The team faded again in 1882 and Hawke, who had refused the captaincy earlier, was appointed team captain at the end of the season, the first amateur to hold this position. Previous captains had all been professionals: Roger Iddison (1863\u201372), Joseph Rowbotham (1873 and 1875), Luke Greenwood (1874), Ephraim Lockwood (1876\u201377) and Tom Emmett (1878\u201382).
