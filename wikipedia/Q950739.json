Born in Newcastle upon Tyne, England, Robson later moved to the Mount Dennis section of York, Ontario, Canada and finally to the United States in 1924, with his family settling in Huntington Park, California.\nRobson was the winner of the first Indianapolis 500 following World War II (1946) but died later that year with George Barringer in an accident at Lakewood Speedway in Atlanta, Georgia. He was very much at his peak at the time of his death. He had qualified for pole for that race and performed strongly since his surprise '500 victory. Robson's brother Hal also competed in the Indy 500. Robson was the last Indianapolis 500 winner to die in the same year as his victory until 2011 when fellow Englishman turned American citizen Dan Wheldon died in a crash at Las Vegas Motor Speedway.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dan Wheldon", "response": ["An autopsy conducted by Clark County Coroner Michael Murphy on 17 October determined that Wheldon died of a blunt force trauma to his head. He was the fifth Indianapolis 500 winner to die in a racing accident in the same year as winning the race, and the first repeat winner to do so. Preceding Wheldon were Gaston Chevrolet (1920), Joe Boyer (1924), Ray Keech (1929), and George Robson (1946). He was also the first driver to be killed in IndyCar competition since Paul Dana died in an accident during practice for the 2006 Toyota Indy 300 at Homestead\u2013Miami Speedway. On 22 October, Wheldon was given a funeral at the First Presbyterian Church of St. Petersburg attended by almost 1,000 mourners. Fellow drivers Franchitti, Dixon, Kanaan and Wheldon's three brothers acted as pall-bearers. The next day, IndyCar held a public memorial service for him at Conseco Fieldhouse (now Gainbridge Fieldhouse) in Indianapolis attended by members of the motor racing community and his family and fans. A second memorial service for Wheldon took place at the All Saints' Church in his home town of Emberton on 6 November. He is buried at the Calvary Catholic Cemetery in Clearwater, Florida."]}, {"page": "List of Indianapolis 500 winners", "response": ["! scope=\"row\" |George Robson"]}]}}
