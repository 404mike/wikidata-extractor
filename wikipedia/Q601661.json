Additionally, Wright chose the earlier period because he hated dresses with an empire silhouette, which were popular in the later period. The decision helped make the film visually distinct from other recent Austen adaptations. In comparison to the popular 1995 BBC version, which featured Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, producer Paul Webster desired to make an adaptation that \"doesn't conform to the television drama stereotypes of a perfect clean Regency world\". Wright and Moggach opted for a \"muddy hem version\" of Longbourn, presenting a more rural setting than in previous adaptations out of a desire to depict the Bennets in \"very close proximity to their rural life\" and to emphasise their relative poverty. While the degree of poverty was criticised by some critics, Wright felt that the \"mess adds to the drama of the predicament that the family were in\", and helps contrast the Bennets, Darcys, and Bingleys.", "During script development, the crew created a \"constant going back and forth between script and location\". The film was shot entirely on location within England on an 11-week schedule during the 2004 summer. Co-producer Paul Webster noted that \"it is quite unusual for a movie this size to be shot entirely on location. Part of Joe [Wright]'s idea was to try to create a reality which allows the actors to relax and feel at one with their environment.\" Working under production designer Sarah Greenwood and set decorator Katie Spencer, the crew filmed on seven estates in six different counties. Because \"nothing exists in the United Kingdom that is untouched by the twenty-first century\", many of the sites required substantial work to make them suitable for filming. Visual effects company Double Negative digitally restored several locations to make them contemporaneous; they eradicated weeds, enhanced gold plating on window frames, and removed anachronisms such as gravel driveways and electricity pylons. Double Negative also developed the typeface used for the film's title sequence.", "Stewart-Beer and Austen scholar Sally B. Palmer noted alterations within the depiction of the Bennet family; Stewart-Beer remarked that while their family home \"might be chaotic, in this version it is, at heart, a happy home\u2014much happier and much less dysfunctional, than Austen's original version of Longbourn\u00a0... For one, Mr and Mrs Bennet actually seem to like each other, even love each other, a characterisation which is a far cry from the source text.\" Producer Paul Webster acknowledged the familial theme in the DVD featurette \"A Bennet Family Portrait\", remarking \"Yes, it's a great love story between Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy, but underpinning it all is the kind of love that runs this family.\""]}, {"page": "59th British Academy Film Awards", "response": ["* Pride & Prejudice \u2013 Tim Bevan, Eric Fellner, Paul Webster, Joe Wright and Deborah Moggach"]}, {"page": "Eastern Promises", "response": ["Speaking in August 2010, Cassel said that a sequel was discussed with Cronenberg whilst they were filming A Dangerous Method.

In addition to Beethoven, pieces such as \"Meryton Townhall\" and \"The Militia Marches In\" (featuring the flute) were inspired by the film's period, with the intention that they could conceivably have been heard during that time. \"Meryton Townhall\" and \"Another Dance\" contained actual dance cues that were fitting for the late eighteenth century.
