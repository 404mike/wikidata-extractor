He was born and died at Flax Bourton, Somerset.\nChidgey was the elder son of the innkeeper at the Angel Inn in Flax Bourton. He played as a professional cricketer for Somerset as a lower-order batsman and wicketkeeper and made his debut in the game against Gloucestershire in 1900. But with the amateurs Archie Wickham, Henry Martyn and Arthur Newton often available, Chidgey had just two further games in the 1902 season, and then did not reappear for six seasons. In the 1901 census, when he is living with his parents, he is listed as a \"merchant's clerk\".After Somerset's disastrous 1907 season, Wickham retired and Newton scaled down his availability, so that from 1908 Chidgey became Somerset's regular wicketkeeper for the seasons up to, and just beyond, the First World War, though Newton made sporadic reappearances in several matches most seasons, nearly always home games for Somerset, and always displacing Chidgey: an indication of the pecking order between amateurs and professionals in Edwardian cricket is that of Chidgey's 99 first-class games, only 32 were home matches, and 18 of those were at Bath, the furthest outpost of Somerset cricket. In 1913, for example, he played 11 first-class games, one of them for Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and only one was in Somerset. But by the 1911 census, at which time he had been married and widowed, he was able to call himself a \"professional cricketer\" on the census form.Chidgey batted normally at No 11 throughout his first-class career, but his highest score came in the 1909 season when he was sent in as nightwatchman at No 3 against Yorkshire at Bath and made 45, his partnership with the dour Len Braund enabling Somerset to draw the match. He returned to Somerset for the 1919 season after the First World War, but the county then cut the number of professionals in its team to two in the 1920 season, and he did not play at all that year; he returned, however, for some games in 1921 before leaving finally.\nIn 1925 and 1926, he was on the first-class umpires' list, and he was picked, alongside Sailor Young, for the fourth Test between England and Australia on the 1926 tour; the game, at Manchester, was ruined by rain with less than two full innings completed. He was picked as an umpire for first-class matches again in the 1927 season, but did not appear in any games.\nIn his obituary in the 1942 edition of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, Chidgey was described as \"rather small, quick and neat\"; he had played for his local club at Flax Bourton from the age of 14 and was also involved in village affairs as a member of what Wisden terms \"Long Ashton Urban District Council\" (in fact, a rural district council).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Flax Bourton", "response": ["* Harry Chidgey, cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of Test cricket umpires", "response": ["|Harry Chidgey||||1||1926||1926"]}, {"page": "Somerset County Cricket Club first-class matches", "response": ["All but six of the first-class matches played by Somerset have been eleven-a-side.

In that season, he struck his first half-century since 1905, scoring 50 runs in the second innings of a match against Middlesex at Bath. He followed that with another in his next innings, finishing on 52 not out against Lancashire, though Somerset lost both matches by an innings. He finished the 1910 season with 363 runs at an average of 16.50, and appeared in a representative match for the West of England against the East. In their summary of the 1911 season, Wisden Cricketers' Almanack claimed that \"the outlook for Somerset is cheerless.\"Roebuck (1991), p. 108. The county finished bottom of the championship with only one victory, against Hampshire at Bath.Roebuck (1991), p. 107. Despite this, Poyntz had one of his most successful seasons: he scored 597 runs at an average of 22.96, and his five half-centuries were the most in any year of his career. He began the season with half-centuries in both innings of a drawn match with Hampshire in Southampton, and two matches later, he bowled for the first time in first-class cricket. Facing Lancashire, Poyntz was called upon as Somerset's ninth bowler in their opponent's second innings: only the captain Daniell and the wicket-keeper, Harry Chidgey, did not bowl. Poyntz bowled eight overs and three balls, and claimed five wickets; his best analysis in first-class cricket. He continued to bowl occasionally for the remainder of the season, but only claimed three further wickets, and finished his career with a bowling average of 39.62. Poyntz was unable to appear as often in 1912; he only played eight times for Somerset, six less than the season before. He scored 253 runs at an average 18.07 that year, and did not pass fifty run in an innings."]}, {"page": "Bruce Hylton-Stewart", "response": ["He first appeared in first-class cricket in the Somerset match against the South Africans in 1912, when he replaced the injured Harry Chidgey after the game had started. Two weeks later, he made his only appearance of the 1912 season for Cambridge University, and then from mid-July appeared fairly regularly for Somerset for the rest of the season. His batting was not successful, but he had one sensational day as a bowler, taking five wickets for three runs in 14 balls against Worcestershire at Stourbridge: these remained the best bowling figures of his first-class cricket career."]}, {"page": "Chidgey", "response": ["*Harry Chidgey (1879\u20131941), first-class cricketer and Test match umpire"]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1895\u20131914)", "response": ["* Harry Chidgey (1913) : H.
