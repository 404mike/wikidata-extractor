B. Tauris, 2007. A minority of vegetarians avoided animal food entirely. In 1813, the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley published A Vindication of Natural Diet, advocating \"abstinence from animal food and spirituous liquors\", and in 1815, William Lambe, a London physician, stated that his \"water and vegetable diet\" could cure anything from tuberculosis to acne.James C. Whorton, Crusaders for Fitness: The History of American Health Reformers, Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2014, 69\u201370: \"Word of these cures of pimples, consumption, and virtually all ailments in between was widely distributed by his several publications\u00a0...\"", "Percy Bysshe Shelley, A Vindication of Natural Diet, London: F. Pitman, 1884 [1813]; William Lambe, Joel Shew, Water and Vegetable Diet, New York: Fowler's and Wells, 1854 [London, 1815]. Lambe called animal food a \"habitual irritation\", and argued that \"milk eating and flesh-eating are but branches of a common system and they must stand or fall together\".Lambe 1854, 55, 94.
