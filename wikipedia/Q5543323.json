His sister, Elizabeth Mary, who was the eventual Browne heir in 1797, married, on 1 September 1794, William Stephen Poyntz. They lived at Midgham House in Berkshire and at Cowdray; as per the myth both their sons drowned at nearby Bognor Regis on 7 July 1815. As a result, the estate a generation later was sold by the surviving daughters mostly to George Perceval, 6th Earl of Egmont, and perhaps to Lord Leconfield, with Cowdray passing in 1908 to Weetman Pearson, 1st Viscount Cowdray."]}, {"page": "George James Perceval, 6th Earl of Egmont", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Perceval, 6th Earl of Egmont"]}, {"page": "Admiral George James Perceval, 6th Earl of Egmont", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Perceval, 6th Earl of Egmont"]}, {"page": "Charlton cemetery", "response": ["* Admiral George Perceval, 6th Earl of Egmont (1794\u20131874) \u2013 a midshipman at the Battle of Trafalgar at age 11"]}]}}
