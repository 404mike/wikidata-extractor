The band is currently composed of Matthew Tuck (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Michael Paget (lead guitar, backing vocals), Jason Bowld (drums) and Jamie Mathias (bass guitar, backing vocals). Former members include Michael Thomas, Jason James and Nick Crandle; the latter were on bass. They were formed under the name Jeff Killed John and started their music career by covering songs by Metallica and Nirvana. Jeff Killed John recorded six songs which were not released; two of these tracks were reworked later in their career as Bullet for My Valentine. A change of style from that of Jeff Killed John led the band to change their name. In 2002, the band secured a five-album deal with Sony BMG. The band has stated that their music is influenced by classic metal acts such as Metallica, Iron Maiden and Slayer. The band is part of the Cardiff music scene.", "Jeff Killed John was the forerunner band to Bullet for My Valentine and was formed in 1998 by Matthew Tuck, Michael \"Padge\" Paget, Nick Crandle, and Michael \"Moose\" Thomas while studying music at Bridgend College. They started playing Nirvana and Metallica cover songs. In 1999, the band released their first ever EP, Better Off Alone. They released another two-track EP in 2002, You/Play with Me, which was produced by Greg Haver. The EP was financed through the Pynci scheme for new Welsh musicians and the release garnered radio airplay on BBC Radio 1's broadcast at Newport's T.J.'s. Jeff Killed John's music followed the nu metal trend set by bands such as Korn and Limp Bizkit. Shortly after, the band released another two-track EP titled Eye Spy. In 2003, their second EP was released titled Don't Walk Away. This was a promotional CD and was shipped to different record companies, as well as being given out locally in Bridgend. Bassist Crandle left the band on the eve of entering the recording sessions for the band's self-titled EP and was replaced by Jason James. The band then changed their name to Bullet for My Valentine and reworked their musical strategy; they decided to play heavy metal songs with \"harmony guitars and big angelic choruses,\" according to frontman Tuck. In late 2003, they released their final EP before record labels actually began to notice their potential. This happened due to the sudden change in their strategy and sound, which the band claims came \"directly out of their heads.\" Their self-titled EP consisted of five songs; most of the songs became precursors of tracks from The Poison.", "Bullet For My Valentine With Full Force 2018 06.jpg|Matthew Tuck"]}, {"page": "The Poison", "response": ["* Matthew Tuck \u2013 lead vocals, rhythm guitar, additional lead guitar, bass (uncredited)"]}, {"page": "Hand of Blood", "response": ["*Matthew Tuck \u2013 lead vocals, rhythm guitar, bass guitar (uncredited), guitar solo on track 1, 2 and 6"]}, {"page": "Tuck (surname)", "response": ["* Matthew Tuck, lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist in the Welsh heavy metal band Bullet for My Valentine"]}, {"page": "1980 in Wales", "response": ["*20 January \u2013 Matthew Tuck, vocalist"]}, {"page": "Bullet for My Valentine (EP)", "response": ["* Matthew Tuck \u2013 lead vocals, rhythm guitar, bass guitar (uncredited)"]}, {"page": "Jackson Rhoads", "response": ["* Matthew Tuck of Bullet for My Valentine \u2013 Jackson Matt Tuck Signature Series Rhoads."]}, {"page": "List of rhythm guitarists", "response": ["*Matthew Tuck (Bullet for My Valentine)"]}, {"page": "Tears Don't Fall", "response": ["Category:Songs written by Matthew Tuck"]}, {"page": "All These Things I Hate (Revolve Around Me)", "response": ["Stylus Magazine said that the song \"doesn't work\" on The Poison album because its \"quiet/loud dynamic\" does not explore the full dynamic.Bullet For My Valentine - The Poison - Review - Stylus Magazine Music Emissions gave the song a very positive review, saying that it was the highlight of an otherwise \"gimmicky\" album, the song featuring interwoven acoustic guitar lines and harmony vocals (delivered by lead singer Matthew Tuck) during the song's introduction section.Bullet For My Valentine - The Poison Review from Music Emissions Punk News reviewed the song as \"a nice respite from the [otherwise] drab\" songs on the album, because of its acoustic intro.Bullet for My Valentine - The Poison | Punknews.org", "Category:Songs written by Matthew Tuck"]}, {"page": "Suffocating Under Words of Sorrow (What Can I Do)", "response": ["Category:Songs written by Matthew Tuck"]}, {"page": "The Poison: Live at Brixton", "response": ["* Matthew Tuck - lead vocals, rhythm guitar solo on tracks 3 and 4, second solo on track 10"]}, {"page": "List of people with given name Matthew", "response": ["* Matthew Tuck (born 1980), Welsh musician"]}, {"page": "Liam Cormier", "response": ["Cormier is the lead singer for the supergroup AxeWound.
