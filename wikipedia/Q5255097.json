On their eponymous first album (1972), his bass notes made distinctive contributions to the tracks \"Ladytron\" and \"Chance Meeting\".  However, not long after the album was released, Simpson, who was suffering from depression following the death of his mother from cancer, was given an open-ended choice to remain with or take a hiatus from the band by Ferry. Simpson chose to leave the band and never returned to the line-up. He used his band royalties to travel the world learning about different cultures and religions, particularly Sufism, returning to London in 1982. \nGraham Simpson is the subject of a short film called Nothing But The Magnificent that screened at the Portobello Film Festival in 2010. The feature-length version called Mighty is nine years in the making and due to star Hollywood film director Mike Figgis and original members of Roxy Music including Bryan Ferry.
