He is emeritus professor of philosophy at the University of Sheffield, He studied in Dublin (Trinity College), G\u00f6ttingen (Georg-August Universit\u00e4t) and Canada (McMaster University), and is best known for his work on the philosophers Gottlob Frege, Immanuel Kant, and Edmund Husserl, and also on topics such as solipsism, phenomenology, the theory of thought and judgement, and the history of the Analytic Tradition.\nBell's awards include: Radcliffe Research Fellowship (1986\u201387); Alexander von Humboldt Research Fellowship (1988); British Academy Research Readership (1993); and the Alexander von Humboldt Prize in Philosophy (1995). He has held the posts of Visiting Professor, Institute of Philosophy, University of Leuven, (1987); Honorary Professor, University of Keele (1993\u201396); and Visiting Professor, Ludwig Maximillians Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen (1994) He was a Fellow of the Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin [Institute of Advanced Study] (1995\u201396). And in 2001-2 he was President of the Mind Association.Bell has been influential in seeking to integrate the Analytic (predominantly anglophone) and the Continental (mainly French and German) traditions in philosophy. In 1993, together with Mark Sacks, he was instrumental in founding a new journal, The European Journal of Philosophy with the aim of proving 'a platform to which those both inside and outside Europe can turn to find some of the diversity ... in European philosophy', and thus overcome the insularity and at times hostility that has characterized aspects of that philosophy during the last century. In 2015 the EJP was voted among the top 20 philosophy journals world-wide.  In 1999 Bell published an influential study of Husserl, in which analytic techniques were applied to a central figure of continental phenomenology.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Index of philosophy articles (D\u2013H)", "response": ["* David Bell (philosopher)"]}, {"page": "David Bell", "response": ["David Bell may refer to:", "* David Bell (university administrator) (born 1959), Scottish academic administrator and civil servant", "* David Bell (philosopher) (born 1947), British philosopher", "* David Bell (artist) (1915\u20131959), British curator and writer", "* David Bell (historian) (born 1961), American historian of France", "* David Bell (author) (born 1969), American author and professor", "* David Bell (golfer) (born 1880), Scottish golfer", "* David Bell (field hockey) (born 1955), Australian field hockey player and coach", "* David Bell (baseball) (born 1972), Former American baseball player and current manager of the Cincinnati Reds", "* David Bell (basketball) (born 1981), American basketball player", "* David Bell (sportsman) (born 1949), Scottish rugby union and cricket representative", "* David Bell (footballer, born 1985), Irish footballer", "* David Bell (footballer, born 1984), Irish footballer", "* David Bell (Australian footballer) (1890\u20131961), Australian rules footballer", "* David Bell (American football) (born 2000), American football wide receiver", "* David Bell (Australian politician) (1828\u20131894), New South Wales politician", "* David Bell (Irish Republican) (1818\u20131890)", "* David Bell (television executive) (1937\u20131990), Scottish television producer and director", "* David Bell (VC) (1845\u20131920), Irish soldier", "* David Bell (composer) (born 1954), American composer", "* David Bell (publisher) (born 1946), American publisher", "* David Belle (born 1973), French actor, film choreographer, and stunt coordinator"]}, {"page": "List of British philosophers", "response": ["* David Bell"]}, {"page": "1947 in philosophy", "response": ["* David Bell (unknown)"]}]}}
