His grandfather, Brigadier-General Lewis Mordaunt, was the younger brother of Charles Mordaunt, 3rd Earl of Peterborough, sometime First Lord of the Treasury. He was commissioned ensign and lieutenant in the 2nd Regiment of Foot Guards on 27 January 1753, and promoted captain-lieutenant in the 10th Regiment of Dragoons on 25 December 1755.Mordaunt is best remembered for his oft-quoted poem \"The Call\", written during the Seven Years' War of 1756\u20131763:\n\n\"Sound, sound the clarion, fill the fife!\nThroughout the sensual world proclaim,\nOne crowded hour of glorious life\nIs worth an age without a name.\"For many years, the poem was incorrectly attributed to Mordaunt's contemporary, Sir Walter Scott. Scott had merely quoted a stanza of the poem at the beginning of Chapter 34 of his novel Old Mortality.One Crowded Hour, Tim Bowden's biography about the Australian combat cameraman Neil Davis, takes its title from a phrase used in \"The Call\".", "link_mentions": {}}}
