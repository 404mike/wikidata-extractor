A practicing artist for over 50 years, he explored issues of politics, sexuality, food, national identity, the grotesque and carnival. In the 1980s his work was provocative with issues relating to male sexuality. An eclectic artist essentially a painter and printmaker, his work has included text, digital images, photography, and he has worked on banner making, theatre design and has collaborated with video artists.Yeadon's grandmother was the ventriloquist Annie Howarth, who worked under the stage name Josephine Langley. Recurring themes in his paintings since 2010 include his mother and grandmother\u2019s ventriloquist dummiesYeadon's 1984 exhibition Dirty Tricks at the Herbert Art Gallery and Museum in Coventry, was at the high point of AIDS paranoia and gay \u2018blame\u2019, Yeadon\u2019s forthright, radical, critical, \u2018in your face\u2019 paintings challenged  preconceptions on sexuality and society. These paradoxes disturbed and offended some Tory councillors.\nThe Coventry Evening Telegraph declared that it was 'Smut Not Art' in a homophobic editorial rant. However the exhibition increased the attendance at the Herbert by 40%. Works from this exhibition were later that year exhibited at the Pentonville Gallery in London and the British Art Show of 1985. The Arts Council of Britain also bought a version of \u2018The Last Chilean Supper\u2019 one of the \u2018lavatory wall smut\u2019 paintings so derided in the Coventry Evening Telegraph.\nWith over 30 one person shows he has exhibited throughout Britain and abroad, including in Portugal and Germany, and his one person shows in Britain including the Royal Festival Hall, Centre for Contemporary Art, Glasgow and Ikon, Birmingham. His group shows included the British Art Show (1985/6) and exhibitions in Germany, Holland, Portugal and Hong Kong.\nHe set up the Coventry-Dresden Arts Exchange in 2012.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Harwell computer", "response": ["A  painting of the machine, Portrait of a Dead Witch was made by the artist John Yeadon in 1983. After being exhibited at the 1984 at Leicestershire Schools and Colleges show, it was purchased by Leicestershire Local Education Authority and loaned to a local authority school, Newbridge High School, Coalville. Within two years of that school becoming a private academy school, the painting was sold at auction to an undisclosed private buyer. It was discovered on the wall of the Jam Street Cafe Bar in Manchester. Kaldip Bhamber, who has a fine arts degree, was unaware of the painting provenance when she purchased it. John Yeadon has visited the painting at its new location."]}, {"page": "David Yeadon", "response": ["#REDIRECTJohn Yeadon"]}, {"page": "John David Yeadon", "response": ["#REDIRECTJohn Yeadon"]}, {"page": "Josephine Langley", "response": ["Her grandson is the artist, John Yeadon, who features her ventriloquist dummies in his work."]}, {"page": "Yeadon, John", "response": ["#redirectJohn Yeadon"]}]}}
