He remained in France with the army of occupation until 1818, and in 1820 married Maria Cox of Friar Gate, Derby who was the niece of Samuel Richardson. Gawler's new sister-in-law, Mary Ann, married William Leeke, a fellow officer from the 52nd. Gawler and his wife were sincerely religious and when the 52nd was sent to New Brunswick in 1823 they did much social and religious work. Gawler returned to England in 1826 and from 1830 to 1832 was engaged in recruiting.

With his brother Abner, who arrived at Cambridge a year after he did, Brown associated with a group of evangelically-minded young men around Charles Longuet Higgins, who graduated in the same year, and was influenced by Charles Simeon. They were identified by John William Burgon, in his Twelve Good Men, as 18 in number. They included Anthony Thomas Carr, at Queens' with Brown, who kept in touch. Another of the group, and also at Queens' at the time, was William Leeke. With Carr and the Browns, he recruited pupils for a Sunday School in Jesus Lane. It was being set up by Joseph Harden, mentioned by Burgon, and others; and from a start in 1827, in the Friends' Meeting House, Jesus Lane, became a Cambridge institution."]}]}}
