Their setting of English-language verse to old Irish tunes marked the transition in popular Irish culture from Irish to English. Politically, Moore was recognised in England as a press, or \"squib\", writer for the aristocratic Whigs; in Ireland he was accounted a Catholic patriot. Married to a Protestant actress and hailed as \"Anacreon Moore\" after the classical Greek composer of drinking songs and erotic verse, Moore did not profess religious piety. Yet in the controversies that surrounded Catholic Emancipation Moore was seen to defend the tradition of the Church in Ireland against both evangelising Protestants and uncompromising lay Catholics. Longer prose works reveal more radical sympathies. The Life and Death of Lord Edward Fitzgerald depicts the United Irish leader as a martyr in the cause of democratic reform. Complementing Maria Edgeworth's Castle Rackrent, Memoirs of Captain Rock is a saga, not of Anglo-Irish landowners, but of their exhausted tenants driven to the semi-insurrection of \"Whiteboyism\". Today, however, Moore is remembered almost alone either for his Irish Melodies (typically \"The Minstrel Boy\" and \"The Last Rose of Summer\") or, less generously, for the role he is thought to have played in the loss of the memoirs of his friend Lord Byron.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of English-language poets", "response": ["*Thomas Moore (1779\u20131852, Ir/E)"]}, {"page": "February 25", "response": ["*1852 \u2013 Thomas Moore, Irish poet and lyricist (b. 1779)"]}, {"page": "Herman Melville", "response": ["Just weeks after this failure, Melville's first known published essay appeared.

Parker calls the piece \"characteristic Melvillean mood-stuff\" and considers its style \"excessive enough [...] to indulge his extravagances and just enough overdone to allow him to deny that he was taking his style seriously\".

Robert Kennedy, born in Cultra, County Down, was the Government of Bermuda's Colonial Secretary, and was the acting Governor of Bermuda on three occasions (1829, 1830 and 1835\u20131836).Gentleman's Magazine. See American Vital Records from the Gentleman's Magazine, 1731\u20131868, by David Dobson, p. 160. Irish prisoners were again sent to Bermuda in the 19th century, including participants in the ill-fated Young Irelander Rebellion of 1848, Nationalist journalist and politician John Mitchel, and painter and convicted murderer William Burke Kirwan. Alongside English convicts, they were used to build the Royal Naval Dockyard on Ireland Island.British military presence in Bermuda, The Royal Gazette, 3 February 2007 Conditions for the convicts were harsh, and discipline was draconian. In April, 1830, convict James Ryan was shot and killed during rioting of convicts on Ireland Island. Another five convicts were given death sentences for their parts in the riots, with those of the youngest three being commuted to transportation (to Australia) for life. In June 1849 convict James Cronin, on the hulk Medway at Ireland Island, was placed in solitary confinement from the 25th to the 29th for fighting. On release, and being returned to work, he refused to be cross-ironed. He ran onto the breakwater, brandishing a poker threateningly. For this, he was ordered to receive punishment (presumably flogging) on Tuesday, 3 July 1849, with the other convicts aboard the hulk assembled behind a rail to witness. When ordered to strip, he hesitated. Thomas Cronin, his older brother, addressed him and, while brandishing a knife, rushed forward to the separating rail. He called out to the other prisoners in Irish and many joined him in attempting to free the prisoner and attack the officers. The officers opened fire. Two men were killed and twelve wounded. Punishment of James Cronin was then carried out. Three-hundred men of the 42nd Regiment of Foot, in barracks on Ireland Island, responded to the scene under arms.Bermuda Sampler 1815\u20131850, by William Zuill.

Though his novels celebrated Scottish identity and history, Scott was politically a firm Unionist, but admitted to Jacobite sympathies. Several Romantics spent much time abroad, and a famous stay on Lake Geneva with Byron and Shelley in 1816 produced the hugely influential novel Frankenstein by Shelley's wife-to-be Mary Shelley and the novella The Vampyre by Byron's doctor John William Polidori.

He devoted 1842 to composing chamber music, including the Piano Quintet in E-flat, Op. 44, now one of his best known and most admired works; the Piano Quartet and three string quartets. In 1843 he wrote Paradise and the Peri, his first attempt at concerted vocal music, an oratorio style work based on Lalla-Rookh by Thomas Moore.

On 15 June, the guards in the King's Mews mutinied. The mutiny was contained, but the government was fearful of further unrest.Robins, pp. 126\u2013127 Examination of the bags of evidence was delayed as Parliament debated the form of the investigation, but eventually, on 27 June, they were opened and examined in secret by 15 peers. The peers considered the contents scandalous, and a week later, after their report to the House, the government introduced a bill in Parliament, the Pains and Penalties Bill 1820, to strip Caroline of the title of queen and dissolve her marriage.Robins, pp. 132\u2013143 It was claimed that Caroline had committed adultery with a low-born man: Bartolomeo Pergami. Various witnesses, such as Theodore Majocchi, were called during the reading of the bill, which was effectively a public trial of the queen. The trial caused a sensation, as details of Caroline's familiarity with Pergami were revealed.

I was sure of the writer before you mentioned her. The MS though plainly written has yet some, indeed many little omissions, and an expression may now and then be amended in passing through the press. I will readily undertake the revision.\" Early reviews of Emma were generally favourable, and were more numerous than those of any other of Austen's novels. One important review, requested by John Murray prior to publication by Sir Walter Scott, appeared anonymously in March 1816 in the Quarterly Review, although the date of the journal was October 1815. He writes:The author is already known to the public by the two novels announced in her title page, and both, the last especially, attracted, with justice, an attention from the public far superior to what is granted to the ephemeral productions which supply the regular demand of watering- places and circulating libraries. They belong to a class of fictions which has arisen almost in our own times, and which draws the characters and incidents introduced more immediately from the current of ordinary life than was permitted by the former rules of the novel...Emma has even less story than either of the preceding novels...The author's knowledge of the world, and the peculiar tact with which she presents characters that the reader cannot fail to recognize, reminds us something of the merits of the Flemish school of painting. The subjects are not often elegant, and certainly never grand: but they are finished up to nature, and with a precision which delights the reader.Two other unsigned reviews appeared in 1816, one in The Champion, also in March, and another in September of the same year in Gentleman's Magazine.  Other commenters include Thomas Moore, the Irish poet, singer and entertainer who was a contemporary of Austen's; he wrote to Samuel Rogers, an English poet, in 1816:\"Let me entreat you to read Emma - it is the very perfection of novel-writing \u2013 and I cannot praise it more highly than by saying it is often extremely like your own method of describing things \u2013 so much effect with so little effort!\""]}, {"page": "One Night of Love", "response": ["* The Last Rose of Summer, by Thomas Moore"]}, {"page": "List of poets", "response": ["*Thomas Moore (1779\u20131852), Irish poet, singer and songwriter"]}, {"page": "List of biographers", "response": ["*Thomas Moore (Ir, 1779\u20131852) \u2013 Richard Brinsley Sheridan, Lord Byron and Lord Edward Fitzgerald"]}, {"page": "List of Irish people", "response": ["* Thomas Moore \u2013 poet"]}, {"page": "Fionnuala", "response": ["In Irish mythology, Finnguala (modern spellings: Fionnghuala,  Fionnuala or  Finola; literally  meaning \"white shoulder\") was the daughter of Lir of the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann.
