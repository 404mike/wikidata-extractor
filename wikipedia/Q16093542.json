They had four daughters together.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2001 Whitbread Awards", "response": ["*Anthony Bailey, A View of Delft"]}, {"page": "Clarissa Oakes", "response": ["Anthony Bailey, writing in The New York Times, finds that this novel puts the reader \"on board the Surprise in the South Pacific in the early 19th century amid a swirl of nautical detail, unalloyed, unapologetic and absolutely right.\" in a novel written by \"one of the best storytellers afloat\". He suggests that with his first novel in this series, O'Brian may have been competing with C. S. Forester, but \"At this point, he is in a different squadron altogether, providing pleasure for those who will never be able to read a new Captain Marryat (the author, in the 1830s and 1840s, of a number of sea adventures) \u2013 but in this instance a Marryat with a touch of Jane Austen, Erskine Childers and John le Carr\u00e9 thrown in.\" The relationship between the principal characters is \"One of the delights of these books\", where \"Aubrey is a sailor in his blood and bones\" and Maturin \"remains a landlubber the non-seafaring reader can identify with.\" Bailey notes the use of letters home, a device used also by William Golding in his sea-faring trilogy To the Ends of the Earth, and finds that \"O'Brian while telling his yarn writes like a man simply at home in a 500-ton frigate. All the naval minutiae of the early 19th century are evidently in his grasp, but like the Surprise's maintopsails, they are used to drive the book forward, a great show that also has cumulative effect.\" Bailey highlights many aspects of the plot, which issues are addressed by Aubrey, and which are handled by Maturin, and notes that in this novel, the officers have a particularly varied diet, including \"a suicidal swordfish, soused pig's face and a Polynesian stew in which a human ear floats.\""]}, {"page": "Bailey (surname)", "response": ["* Anthony Bailey (author) (1933\u20132020), English author", "* Anthony Bailey (interfaith campaigner) (born 1970), Irish-British-Antiguan campaigner and PR consultant", "** James Anthony Bailey (1847\u20131906), co-founder of Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus"]}, {"page": "Anthony Bailey", "response": ["Anthony Bailey may refer to:", "* Anthony Bailey (author) (1933\u20132020), British writer and art historian", "* Anthony Bailey (PR advisor) (born 1970), British public relations consultant"]}, {"page": "Tony Spaeth", "response": ["During his childhood, Spaeth's parents took in Anthony Bailey (then himself a child) as a war refugee; Bailey has since told the story of their shared childhood years in the books America, Lost & FoundBailey, Anthony C., \u201cAmerica, Lost & Found\u201d  [Random House, 1981; Chicago, 2000] and England, First & Last.Bailey, Anthony C., \u201cEngland, First & Last\u201d  [Viking, 1985]"]}, {"page": "2020 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Anthony Bailey, 87, writer and art historian, COVID-19."]}, {"page": "Deaths in May 2020", "response": ["*Anthony Bailey, 87, English writer and art historian, COVID-19.Anthony Bailey, Biographer With Stressed Literary Spirit, Dies at 87"]}, {"page": "List of deaths due to COVID-19", "response": ["! scope=\"row\" | Anthony Bailey"]}]}}
