Green put Dagenham back into the lead eleven minutes after the restart with a low strike past Warrington and was booked a minute later for a foul on Danny Harrison. In the 60th minute, Harrison shot over the Dagenham crossbar before Taylor scored the equaliser a minute later from inside the Dagenham penalty area, before being booked in the 57th minute for a foul on Danny Harrison.  With 20 minutes remaining, Rotherham failed to clear a corner and the ball fell to Jon Nurse whose shot took a deflection off Ellison, past Warrington and into the net to make it 3\u20132.  Two minutes after scoring, Nurse was taken off and substituted for Graeme Montgomery in the first change of the afternoon.  Five minutes later Marcus Marshall came on for Mills.  On 83 minutes, Scott was replaced by Phil Walsh for Dagenham.  Benson's shot from inside the penalty area went wide of the Rotherham goal before Abdulai Bell-Baggie was brought on for Ellison.  Vincelot was then shown the yellow card for a foul on Gavin Gunning.

However, it was to prove a challenging afternoon at the Don Valley Stadium.  Nerves began to jangle as soon as Ryan Taylor put the Millers 1\u20130 ahead after just ten minutes and, despite Chris Zebroski equalising in the 31st minute, Rotherham restored their lead just two minutes later thanks to a Danny Harrison strike. Meanwhile, with goals going in at the Stevenage and Gillingham games, Torquay found themselves in 6th, 7th and 8th position at various times during the afternoon and, when Oliver Banks put Rotherham 3\u20131 ahead in the 80th minute, they were now relying on scores from elsewhere if they were to book a place in the play-offs.  While Stevenage secured their place with an enthralling 3\u20133 draw against Bury, the Gulls were ultimately indebted to Chesterfield who, by beating Gillingham 3\u20131, not only clinched the League Two title for themselves, but also made sure that Torquay would finish the season in the final play-off spot, ahead of the unfortunate Gills on goal difference alone."]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Rotherham United F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"| Danny Harrison"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Rotherham United F.C. season", "response": ["|= ||MF || ||4 ||Danny Harrison || 2 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 2", "|4 || ||MF ||Danny Harrison || 3 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 4 || 0"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Rotherham United F.C. season", "response": ["|Danny Harrison"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Tranmere Rovers F.C. season", "response": ["|7 June 2012|| Danny Harrison||||Rotherham United||1 July 2013||Free", "|29 April 2013|| Danny Harrison||||Released||Chester||Free", "| 12 |||| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Danny Harrison"]}, {"page": "Daniel Harrison", "response": ["Daniel, Dan or Danny Harrison may refer to:", "* Danny Harrison (EastEnders), fictional character", "* Danny Harrison (footballer) (born 1982), English footballer", "* Danny Harrison (musician), Canadian singer-songwriter-guitarist who was active in the 1960s", "* Danny Harrison, English house and garage producer and one half of the duos 187 Lockdown and Moto Blanco", "* Dhani Harrison (born 1978), musician, composer and singer-songwriter whose name is often pronounced \"Danny Harrison\", son of George Harrison"]}, {"page": "2019 Scottish Challenge Cup Final", "response": ["|CM||6||  Danny Harrison "]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Rotherham United F.C. season", "response": ["|Danny Harrison"]}]}}
