In particular, he has worked on chemical computers using reaction\u2013diffusion processes.\nHe has used slime moulds to plan potential routes for roadway systems and as components of nanorobotic systems, and discovered that they seek out sedatives in preference to nutrients. He has also shown that the billiard balls in billiard-ball computers may be replaced by soldier crabs.Adamatzky is a director of the Unconventional Computing Laboratory, founding Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Cellular Automata (OCP Science, 2005\u2013) and the Int Journal of Unconventional Computing (OCP Science, 2005\u2013), and current Editor-in-Chief of Parallel Processing Letters (World Scientific, 2017\u2013).He appears in the 2014 documentary The Creeping Garden and in the 2019 documentary Le Blob.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Slime mold", "response": ["Slime mold Physarum polycephalum was also used by Andrew Adamatzky from the University of the West of England and his colleagues world-wide in experimental laboratory approximations of motorway networks of 14 geographical areas: Australia, Africa, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany, Iberia, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, UK and US.New Scientist, Designing highways the slime mould way, January 6, 2010.The Guardian, Cities in motion: how slime mould can redraw our rail and road maps , February 18, 2014."]}, {"page": "Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky reaction", "response": ["Andrew Adamatzky, a computer scientist in the University of the West of England, reported on liquid logic gates using the BZ reaction.

Furthermore, he has theoretically shown how a hypothetical \"2+ medium\" modelled as a cellular automaton can perform computation.  Adamatzky was inspired by a theoretical article on computation by using balls on a billiard table to transfer this principle to the BZ-chemicals and replace the billiard balls with waves: if two waves meet in the solution, they create a third wave which is registered as a 1. He has tested the theory in practice and is working to produce some thousand chemical versions of logic gates to create a chemical pocket calculator."]}, {"page": "Adamatzky", "response": ["#REDIRECT Andrew Adamatzky"]}, {"page": "Adamatzky, Andrew", "response": ["#redirectAndrew Adamatzky"]}, {"page": "Andy Adamatzky", "response": ["#REDIRECT Andrew Adamatzky"]}]}}
