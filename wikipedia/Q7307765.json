He made his debut at the age of 17 for Nuneaton Borough in November 1970, and later played nine games in the Football League for Port Vale between 1972 and 1975. He then returned to non-league football with Brereton Social, Redditch United, Stafford Rangers and Alvechurch.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gordon Lee (footballer)", "response": ["He did not retain the services of four players for the 1972\u201373 season: Mick Morris, Keith Ball, Stuart Sharratt, and John Flowers. Lee made some key signings however, bringing in Stafford Rangers goal-machine Ray Williams for \u00a33,000, midfielder Freddie Goodwin (Southport), 'controversial' goalkeeper Alan Boswell (Bolton Wanderers), young midfielder Colin Tartt, and trialist goalkeeper Reg Edwards (Nuneaton Borough). Six wins were gained from the opening eight league games, though low attendances caused Lee to remark that \"the people here are not genuinely interested in league football\". Offered the management position at Shrewsbury Town, he rejected the offer as he believed the club \"lacked potential\" and that he had a \"feeling of loyalty towards the [Vale] players\". In mid-season he sold John James to Chester for \u00a35,000, Ray Harford to Colchester United for \u00a31,750, and Keith Lindsey to Gillingham for \u00a3750, whilst spending \u00a32,250 to bring 'pacey' striker John Woodward in from Walsall. Lee's team was criticized for foul play, particularly on 10 March, when Blackburn Rovers manager Ken Furphy branded them \"a brutal and physical side\". In the FA Cup, West Ham United manager Ron Greenwood claimed that the Vale players attempted \"the most blatant calculated intimidation I have ever seen anywhere in the world\". Vale finished in sixth spot with 53 points, four short of promoted Notts County. The 69 goals conceded tally was higher than that of all but the bottom two clubs."]}, {"page": "John Connaughton", "response": ["Connaughton moved on to Third Division side Port Vale in May 1974, where he replaced Alan Boswell. He played 47 games in 1974\u201375, leaving deputy Reg Edwards to play just twice. For his consistency he was voted Player of the Year by the club's supporters. He missed just one game in 1975\u201376, with Manchester United loanee David Ryan covering him for a 2\u20131 defeat at Swindon Town on 17 January."]}, {"page": "History of Port Vale F.C.", "response": ["A dire financial situation meant seven players were released for 1975\u201376: John Woodward, Tony Lacey, Roy Cross, Bill Summerscales, Frank Sharp and Reg Edwards. Attempts to sign Wales  internationals Mike England and Wyn Davies failed, and so Mick Cullerton, Terry Lees and Geoff Morris were the only new signings. Cullerton was in fine scoring form, though the promotion campaign fell away and Horton was sold to Brighton for \u00a330,000, which led to a healthy profit on the season. For the club's centenary celebrations a match was held with Stoke City, which finished 1\u20131, an impressive result considering the \"Potters\" were going through one of the most successful periods in their history."]}, {"page": "Alan Boswell", "response": ["He moved to Gordon Lee's Third Division Port Vale in July 1972 and kept a clean sheet on his debut in a draw with Rochdale at Spotland on 12 August that year. He spent two seasons of regular football with the club, leaving some unpleasant memories for many Vale fans: conceding seven goals to Rotherham United at Millmoor, he was sent off for fighting during a 1\u20130 win at Swansea Town at Vetch Field, and managed to palm the ball into his own net in a 1\u20131 draw with former club Walsall at Vale Park. He was favoured ahead of Reg Edwards in 1972\u201373 and 1973\u201374. He was given a free transfer in May 1974 by new manager Roy Sproson, and moved on to non-league side Oswestry Town, where he also served as manager in the first half of the 1976\u201377 Southern League Division One North season."]}, {"page": "Reg Edwards", "response": ["*Reg Edwards (rugby union) (1893\u20131951), English rugby union player ", "*Reg Edwards (footballer, born 1912) (1912\u2013?), English footballer who played in the Football League for Burnley and Walsall", "*Reg Edwards (footballer, born 1953), English footballer who played in the Football League for Port Vale", "*Reg Edwards (Australian footballer) (born 1943), Australian rules footballer"]}, {"page": "1972\u201373 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["The pre-season saw Gordon Lee make a number of big signings.
