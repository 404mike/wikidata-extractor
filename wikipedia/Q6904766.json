He covered seven World Cups, many European Championships and more than 40 FA Cup Finals, and Wimbledon Championships.He said in an interview:\n\nWhat makes a great football picture? Being in the right place with the right lens and\u2026 luck! After a working lifetime in sport for a national newspaper, with 80% of my time spent concentrating on football, I know that I have been very, very lucky. For me it was always about 'Incidents'. I was always looking for an incident that had gone unnoticed, something off the ball, something to make the reader stop and take a second look and think \"I didn't see that!\"\nHe followed his uncle Monty Fresco, an award-winning cameraman with the Daily Mail, into sports photography. His nephew, Michael Fresco, has carried on the family tradition as a Fleet Street sports photographer.\nFresco was a member of the Sports Journalist Association and one of the SJA's most renowned members. His career spanned 50 years as a top sports photographer, including three decades at the Daily Mirror. The Sports Journalists' Association made the annual presentation of the Doug Gardner Award for services to sports journalism to him.3\nFresco was brought up in London's East End, the son of a tailor. He was evacuated at an early age and poorly educated leaving school at 14 years of age. He joined Topical Press in the 1950s as a runner boy, then went on to become a dark room photographic printer in Red Lion Court, Fleet Street, while covering bigger sporting events evenings and weekends (obtaining entrance to venues was much easier in those days).\nOn his 18th birthday Topical made him a \"Junior Photographer\". When Topical Press closed he moved onto International News Photos, part of the American Hearst Corporation covering all assignments. When INP merged with Planet News he was offered a photographer's position. Ted Taylor, boss of INP, had recommended him to the Daily Mirror, where they made him a salaried freelance photographer for almost a year.\nTaken on the staff of the Mirror in 1958, he went on to become chief sports photographer for 30 years. His work included the iconic image of Vinnie Jones getting to grips with Paul Gascoigne in midfield. He moved on in 1988 (during the Maxwell era) joining Bob Thomas Sports Photography as director/photographer, still covering major sporting events worldwide. Later this was merged with Popperfoto.com. He was invested with an MBE in October 1995 for 'Services to Sports Photography'. He retired in 2004.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dave Mackay", "response": ["In 1966 Mackay was photographed by Daily Mirror photographer Monte Fresco in an on-pitch confrontation with Leeds United's Billy Bremner. Mackay's face contorted, he is seen grabbing Bremner's shirt. The image is seen as one of the most iconic in UK football although Mackay hated it as it portrayed him as a bully. Mackay stated he reacted in the manner he did since Bremner targeted Mackay's left leg (the one he had broken twice) even though this leg was furthest away from Bremner."]}, {"page": "2013 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Monte Fresco, 77, sports photographer."]}, {"page": "Deaths in December 2013", "response": ["*Monte Fresco, 77, British sports photographer.Monte Fresco dies: Mirror photographer took some of the most iconic sports pictures in history"]}, {"page": "Fresco (surname)", "response": ["*Monte Fresco (1936\u20132013), English photographer"]}]}}
