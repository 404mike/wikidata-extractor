Rather than changing all of the articles that use  we should try to get the template fixed, if this is feasible.

He served the university till 1954; in between, he had a short stint of two years at Birkbeck College from 1950 to 1952 as a British Council Fellow and part-time faculty, working with Donald Charlton Bradley; he utilised this period to secure a PhD from the University of London in 1952. He returned to India the same year and resumed his service at Allahabad University when he was offered the position of a reader at Lucknow University in 1954. After serving four years there, he moved to Gorakhpur University in 1958 as a professor where, a year later, he was promoted as the dean of the faculty of science. It was during this time, he served as a member of the Review Committee in Chemistry of the University Grants Commission of India under the chairmanship of T. R.
