It also received praise from Kirkus Reviews, which labelled it \"lucid\" and \"enjoyable\". In October 2015 he co-curated an exhibition based on the book at Compton Verney Art Gallery, Periodic Tales: The Art of the Elements, exhibiting predominantly contemporary art works and focusing on the relationship between artistic objects and the elemental materials that go into their making.Aldersey-Williams contributed an essay on Sir Thomas Browne to The Society for Curious Thought.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Andrew Szydlo", "response": ["More recently, he has collaborated with Andrea Sella of University College London and the author Hugh Aldersey-Williams in Elements, an exhibition at the Wellcome Collection, where he spoke about the Dutch alchemist Cornelis Drebbel, situating Drebbel in a broader scientific and historical context and illustrating the talk with lively experiments.

The book is divided into five sections, \"Power\", \"Fire\", \"Craft\", \"Beauty\", and \"Earth\", which group elements according to their primary cultural connotations, rather than their position on the periodic table. For certain elements such as phosphorus, the author documents his attempts to obtain samples by reproducing the original method of discovery. He also visits the site of discovery of several elements uncovered in modern times, including the famed Ytterby mine in Sweden, from which seven new elements were isolated."]}, {"page": "Audie Award for History or Biography", "response": ["| In Search of Sir Thomas Browne: The Life and Afterlife (2015) by Hugh Aldersey-Williams"]}]}}
