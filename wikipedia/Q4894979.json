Late that year Peter McWilliam was appointed manager. He became a significant and popular figure at the club, managing the team in two separate periods, both interrupted by world wars. The first significant signing by McWilliam was winger Fanny Walden, who was signed for a record \u00a31,700 in April 1913, later signings included goalkeeper Bill Jaques and right-back Tommy Clay.  McWilliam's record in the early years was poor, and Tottenham were bottom of the league at the end of the 1914\u201315 season when league football was suspended owing to the First World War that had started a year earlier.  During the war years, White Hart Lane was taken over by the government and turned into a factory for making gas masks, gunnery and protection equipment. The London clubs organised their own matches, and Tottenham played their home games at Arsenal's Highbury and Clapton Orient's Homerton grounds."]}, {"page": "1921 FA Charity Shield", "response": ["In the match, Tottenham's technical was game more suited to the weather. Their accurate passing and build-up play was a better option in the heat to the physical and energetic style that Burnley had relied on to take them to the top of the table. Tottenham scored both goals in the first half, with goals for Bert Bliss and Jimmy Cantrell."]}]}}
