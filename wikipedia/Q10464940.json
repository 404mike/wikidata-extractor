He initially displaced Wally Halsall from the  half-back line but was also used at inside right before dropping out of the side entirely for the last few matches of the season, at the end of which Blackburn were relegated to the Second Division. He played at left half for the first couple of months of the 1936\u201337 season, and spent the second half of the campaign as a forward, scoring six times from 16 matches at inside left. He played the first six weeks of 1937\u201338 at right half, but rarely appeared after that, and Blackburn agreed terms with another Second Division club, Swansea Town, for his transfer. However, maybe in ignorance of the club's arrangements, Calladine signed for Southern League club Guildford City. He helped Guildford finish as runners-up in the 1938\u201339 Southern League, and signed on for the following season, which was abandoned soon after the start of the Second World War."]}, {"page": "Albert Clarke", "response": ["Clarke was born in Sheffield, and began his football career with Mexborough Town and Frickley Colliery. Together with Frickley teammate Melvyn Millington, he turned professional with Torquay United of the Third Division South after a successful trial. He spent 16 months with Torquay before moving to First Division club Birmingham in 1936. Before the 1938\u201339 season he moved again, joining Blackburn Rovers in exchange for Wally Halsall. He averaged a goal every other game for Blackburn, helping them to the Second Division title, before the Football League was suspended on the outbreak of the Second World War. During the war he made guest appearances for Torquay and was a finalist in the 1939\u201340 War League Cup with Blackburn. He died in 1944 on active service in France with the Devonshire Regiment."]}, {"page": "Walter Halsall", "response": ["#REDIRECT Wally Halsall"]}, {"page": "Halsall (surname)", "response": ["*Wally Halsall (1912\u20131996), English footballer"]}, {"page": "1939\u201340 Birmingham F.C. season", "response": ["Player departures included goalkeeper Frank Clack and half-backs Wally Halsall, Bob Meacock and Dai Richards."]}]}}
