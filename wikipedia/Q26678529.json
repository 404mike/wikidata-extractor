He succeeded to the estates of his uncle Sir Francis Page and took name of Page in 1741. He matriculated at New College, Oxford on 29 April 1743, aged 16 and was created MA on 1 August 1747 and DCL on 14 April 1749. He was High Sheriff of Oxfordshire for 1752\u20131753. He embellished and consolidated the estate he inherited at Middle Aston.Page had no great political or intellectual attainments, but was devoted to the Church and University. He was elected as Member of Parliament for Oxford University in 1768 after a contest, and held his seat unopposed for 33 years. By 1790 he was secure in his seat for as long as he wished to hold it but he was politically negligible apart from his attachment to Tory principles in church and state. Early in 1793 he was so ill that there was a canvass for his seat, and on 10 December 1795 he took leave of absence for two weeks to recover his health. In April 1796 he decided to offer himself for re-election in the 1796 general election. Having come into the 1st United Kingdom Parliament in 1801, he resigned his seat within the first quarter of 1801.Page died on 24 August 1803 in his 78th year. He left his estate to his nephew William Sturges who took the additional name of Bourne and subsequently sold Middle Aston for \u00a313,166 to Sir Clement Cottrell Dormer.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Oxford University (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| rowspan=2| Francis Page || rowspan=2| Tory "]}, {"page": "1768 British general election", "response": ["The constituency where the traditional party alignments persisted the longest and most strongly was Oxford University. The constituency had been resolutely Tory in its politics since before the Hanoverian succession and jealously guarded its political independence and Tory identity, leading Horace Walpole to brand Oxfordshire 'a little Kingdom of Jacobitism'. Since a 1762 by-election the representation of the constituency had been shared by two old Tories, William Bagot and Roger Newdigate, who both enjoyed prior Parliamentary experience before being returned by the University. The University Whigs were well aware that the stood little chance of wrestling control of the seat from the Tories except if the Tory interest was divided. An opportunity for a contest emerged after Bagot's death in spring 1768. The Whigs desired to run Charles Jenkinson, a former close ally of Bute as their candidate. Jenkinson hailed from a Tory family but had played a role in the infamous Oxfordshire election of 1754 which had soured Tories considerably towards him. The Tory meanwhile returned William Dolben as a stopgap MP until the general election, Dolben would meanwhile win office in the general election in Northamptonshire. At the general election the popular and respected Newdigate's position was secure, while there was a genuine contest for the second seat. The Tories were initially split between the candidacies of Amersham (UK Parliament constituency) MP William Drake, Sr. and squire Francis Page. Yet the fear of a split and the victory of Jenkinson resolved them to unify behind Page. The Tories were bolstered by a fear that a victory by a pro-government candidate, namely Jenkinson would result in the constituency losing its independence and become a government borough. Additional candidates included Thomas Fitzmaurice and the jurist George Hay whose quixotic bid mystified many and attracted little support. Fitzmaurice, shortly before polling, dropped out and backed Page after being assured of support at a future election. Ultimately the Tory interest would hold firm at the University with Newdigate and Page being easily returned over Jenkinson and Hay.W. R.
