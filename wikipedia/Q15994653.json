She was married to the nineteenth-century geologist Roderick Impey Murchison.\nSeveral times during her life, the couple travelled throughout continental Europe,  visiting places such as France, the Alps, and Italy. She also created numerous sketches of geological features, such as cliffs and fossils, in England during their numerous excursions throughout the country, including the Yorkshire coast in 1826.Charlotte built a significant collection of fossils during the Murchisons\u2019 travels, as well as studying and drawing as a lifelong pursuit. Applying what she had been taught by the painter Paul Sandby, she created geological sketches of important features. With many of her sketches, she often did not focus on the geological features in detail, but instead created a more emotive illustration of the landscape.Through her work, she also helped her husband to develop many of his publications. Many of her illustrations, such as \"Valley of Gosau\", were incorporated into works her husband published. Charlotte is also often credited with being a significant influence on her husband\u2019s career. Unfortunately, on one of the trips she took with her husband, she contracted malaria and suffered complications for the rest of her life, until succumbing to the disease at the age of 80.Charlotte Murchison died on 9 February 1869 at Belgrave Square, London. She was buried at Brompton Cemetery in London.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1788", "response": ["* April 18 \u2013 Charlotte Murchison, Scottish geologist (d. 1869)"]}, {"page": "Mary Anning", "response": ["The risks of Anning's profession were illustrated when in October 1833 she barely avoided being killed by a landslide that buried her black-and-white terrier, Tray, her constant companion when she went collecting. Anning wrote to a friend, Charlotte Murchison, in November of that year: \"Perhaps you will laugh when I say that the death of my old faithful dog has quite upset me, the cliff that fell upon him and killed him in a moment before my eyes, and close to my feet ... it was but a moment between me and the same fate.\"", "A film based on segments of Anning's life and legacy entitled Ammonite, directed by Francis Lee, premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on 11 September 2020.

She dropped out of Wes Anderson's The French Dispatch to have more preparation time for the project. She collaborated closely with Ronan, and they choreographed their own sex scenes. For much of the filming, she lived in isolation in a rented cottage in Dorset, where the film was shot, to get into her character's headspace. Caryn James of the BBC credited Winslet for portraying Anning as \"stern and brittle but immensely sympathetic\" and considered her \"contained, potent performance\" to be one of the best of her career and Manuel Betancourt of New York Magazine welcomed it as a \"return to form\". She next voiced the titular horse in a film adaptation of the novel Black Beauty.
