Strikers Yemi Odubade and Charlie Griffin were the first to leave having been loaned out for much of the previous campaign, joining Conference National sides Gateshead and Forest Green Rovers respectively. Second choice goalkeeper Ashley Bayes opted to leave the club in order to play first-team football at Conference South club Basingstoke Town. Luke Foster and David Bridges also opted to leave Stevenage ahead of the season, both on free transfers, with Foster signing for Rotherham United, and Bridges for his former club, Kettering Town. Stevenage's first signing of the season was striker Guy Madjo, who joined on a free transfer from Albanian Superliga side KS Bylis Ballsh. Former Stevenage goalkeeper Alan Julian re-joined the club following his release by Gillingham, while Phil Edwards rejected a contract extension at Accrington Stanley in order to join the Hertfordshire club on a free transfer. Midfielders Jennison Myrie-Williams and Robin Shroot also signed on free transfers following successful trial periods with the club. In terms of transfers during the 2011\u201312 campaign, striker Don Cowan joined the club from Longford Town for an undisclosed fee in August 2011,", " New signing Phil Edwards had missed a second-half penalty for Stevenage, firing wide after Byron Harrison was fouled in the area. Manager Graham Westley again took the opportunity to look at a number of trialists \u2014 with Welling United's Jack Parkinson featuring in the first half of the match, whilst former Northampton Town midfielder Liam Davis played 79\u00a0minutes. Robin Shroot, who had featured in Stevenage's first two pre-season fixtures, played the whole match. Another defeat followed four days later as Stevenage lost 1\u20130 to an Arsenal XI side at Broadhall Way, a Chuks Aneke goal in the second-half separating the teams. Trialist Rohan Ricketts played 45\u00a0minutes for Stevenage, while Robin Shroot again featured as a second-half substitute \u2014 with the latter signing a two-year contract three days later. Stevenage lost their third consecutive pre-season friendly, again by a 1\u20130 scoreline, when they travelled to Conference South side Hampton & Richmond Borough on 26 July.", " The only goal of the game came just before half-time; a Stuart Duff shot took a deflection off of Phil Edwards, wrong-footing Alan Julian in the Stevenage goal. Two days later, Stevenage travelled to Carshalton Athletic \u2014 the friendly was arranged as part of the transfer that took Stevenage striker Byron Harrison from Carshalton to Broadhall Way.", " A week later, on 17 December, Stevenage faced Tranmere Rovers at Broadhall Way in the club's last home game of 2011 \u2014 with Stevenage securing a 2\u20131 victory. The home side took the lead seven minutes before half-time, with Chris Beardsley swivelling in the area before scooping the ball into the far corner of the goal, although the striker was subsequently substituted immediately after as a result of picking up a hamstring injury in the build-up to the goal. Substitute Ben May was sent-off for the home side after \"squaring up\" to Tranmere goalkeeper Paul Rachubka with twenty minutes remaining. Despite the visitors having a one-man advantage, it was Stevenage who doubled the lead, Mark Roberts heading in Robin Shroot's cross to score his fifth goal of the campaign. Tranmere's Joss Labadie scored a consolation goal for the away side in the third minute of injury-time, scoring from the penalty spot after Scott Laird was adjudged to have brought down Mark McChrystal. Nine days later, Stevenage faced a Boxing Day away trip to Colchester United. Stevenage won the game 6\u20131, their biggest Football League victory to date. The visitors scored the opening goal within the first ten minutes, Don Cowan and Chris Beardsley linked up well before the latter provided a square pass to the onrushing Robin Shroot, who made no mistake from six yards out. Cowan then set-up Beardsley, who scored from 25-yards with a low drilled effort. After hitting the post and forcing Chris Day into making a number of saves, Colchester halved the deficit shortly after the interval when Karl Duguid's cross looped across the face of the goal and Ian Henderson's headed in from six yards. Stevenage restored their two-goal cushion ten minutes later, when Michael Bostwick picked up Phil Edwards' pass and saw his 30-yard shot take a deflection and wrong-foot Ben Williams in the Colchester goal. Seven minutes later, Stevenage scored their fourth goal from a well-worked free-kick \u2014 with Bostwick playing the ball to Scott Laird, who sidefooted the ball into the net from inside the area. Another goal followed just two minutes later, when Luke Freeman picked up Joel Byrom's pass, beat his man and lashed the ball across the goal with a \"powerful strike\". Byrom added a sixth goal with ten minutes remaining when he ran onto Ronnie Henry's header and calmly scored from just inside the area. Five days later, on 31 December, Stevenage won their third consecutive game when they beat Wycombe Wanderers 1\u20130 at Adams Park. The only goal of the game came with just eight minutes remaining, substitute Luke Freeman's left wing cross found Lawrie Wilson, who lashed the ball into the net with a first time finish from six yards out.", "|DF|| Phil Edwards || Accrington Stanley || Free Transfer || 27 June 2011 ||", "|DF|| Phil Edwards || Rochdale|| 9 March 2012 || 31 May 2012 ||"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Stevenage F.C. season", "response": ["|DF||align=left| Phil Edwards || Rochdale || Released || 17 May 2012 || "]}]}}
