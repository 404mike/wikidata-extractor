Against Chelsea on 11 April, Cantona came on for Wallace with 20 minutes to go and Leeds leading 1\u20130; he then set up Chapman's 20th goal of the season before rounding off the scoring with a lob over Chelsea defender Paul Elliott. Two days later, Wilkinson announced that Leeds intended to complete Cantona's transfer from N\u00eemes for \u00a3900,000. Cantona was paid a generous \u00a37,000 a week, a huge cost in an era without television or European football revenue.Auclair (2009), pp. 200\u20131.

He returned to the first team in September in a televised match against Manchester City that Chelsea won 1\u20130. However, Sinclair's mentor, Paul Elliott, suffered a career ending injury in the match. Despite this setback Sinclair managed to make a total of thirty-nine appearances in all competitions, primarily at left-back, as Chelsea finished in mid-table. His impressive performances earned him the Chelsea Player of the Year award in 1993. Glenn Hoddle was appointed as manager for the 1993\u201394 season, replacing David Webb, and preferred using a sweeper system which saw Sinclair convert into a central defender. He excelled in this position, however, the team's performances were poor and the side were involved in a relegation battle for the most of the campaign. Despite their poor league form Chelsea made it to the 1994 FA Cup Final against Manchester United at Wembley Stadium, their first major cup final since 1972. Chelsea could not prevent United from claiming the league and cup double in a 4\u20130 defeat, with Sinclair conceding the penalty for a foul on Andrei Kanchelskis in the second-half, which was scored by Eric Cantona to make it 2\u20130. Despite the defeat Chelsea qualified for the next seasons UEFA Cup Winners' Cup as runners-up, their first European campaign in over twenty years."]}]}}
