He was a strong tackling left back who made 230 appearances (including cup games) for Wednesday between 1931 and 1939. He also played for the England national football team on five occasions. Catlin never scored a goal in an official match in his 8+1\u20442-year career at Hillsborough although he did score in the wartime league game against Notts County in 1944 which Wednesday won 6\u20131.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Catlin", "response": ["*Ted Catlin (1910\u20131990), English footballer"]}, {"page": "1990\u201391 in English football", "response": ["28 November 1990 \u2013 Ted Catlin, 79, played more than 200 games at left-back for Sheffield Wednesday during the 1930s and picked up an FA Cup winner's medal in 1935, also winning five caps for England."]}, {"page": "1935 FA Cup Final", "response": ["West Brom went into the match as favourites even though they were below Wednesday in the table, pundits believing that they had the better forward players with Wally Boyes, W.G. Richardson and Teddy Sandford all having notched over 20 League goals for the season. The two teams had actually met in a League game five days earlier on Easter Monday and drawn 1\u20131 at The Hawthorns. Wednesday went into the match with a full strength squad and fielded the same starting eleven that they had for every round except the third, Ellis Rimmer was their ace in the pack having scored in every round up to the final. West Brom brought back Joe Carter into the team having been absent with a knee injury since the semi-final. Harry Jones being the unlucky player to miss out. In hindsight the decision to play Carter was clearly a gamble and a mistake with no substitutes allowed. Carter was limping after only ten minutes of the match and missed two second half chances which he may have taken if he had been fully fit. Another controversial move by West Brom was the decision to leave out Arthur Gale who had played in all six FA Cup ties leading up to the final that season, scoring four goals from the right wing. Gale was replaced by Tommy Glidden who was effectively shackled by Wednesday's left back Ted Catlin.", "The match had a thrilling start when Wednesday took the lead after just two minutes, a West Brom attack broke down leaving Ted Catlin injured on the floor, however referee Bert Fogg played an advantage and a quick break saw Mark Hooper and Ronnie Starling combine to feed Jack Palethorpe who hit a right foot shot into the corner of the goal. Albion however started to play some good football and got themselves back into the match after 21 minutes when the youngest player on the field, 22-year-old Wally Boyes, a boyhood Wednesdayite from Sheffield scored an equaliser. The diminutive left winger took a pass from Carter and hit a stinging, rising drive from the left side of the penalty area which gave Jack Brown no chance. The score remained at 1\u20131 until half time.", "| ||3 || Ted Catlin"]}, {"page": "Jackie Robinson (footballer)", "response": ["Sheffield Wednesday were relegated in 1937 and started the 1937\u201338 season in Division Two, several of the bigger clubs tried to sign Robinson but he stayed with Wednesday along with fellow international Ted Catlin. Robinson's form remained good throughout that season and he was selected for the England's sides three match tour of continental Europe in May 1938."]}, {"page": "Joe Nibloe", "response": ["Wednesday's signing of the experienced 30-year-old Nibloe was seen as something of a coup by the club, no doubt the influence of manager Billy Walker made a difference as Walker had been a teammate of Nibloe's at Villa the previous season. Competition for the left back spot was keen even though Wednesday had lost Ernie Blenkinsop to Liverpool the previous season; Ted Catlin had stepped into Blenkinsop's boots and Nibloe was forced to switch to right back to secure a place in the team. He made his Wednesday debut in the opening fixture of the 1934\u201335 season on 25 August 1934, in a 4\u20131 home victory over Stoke City.\"The Men Who Made Sheffield Wednesday Football Club\", Tony Matthews,  Page 179 Gives details of Sheffield Wednesday career."]}, {"page": "Willie Fallon", "response": ["Fallon signed for Sheffield Wednesday from Notts County for a transfer few of \u00a33,000 plus Jack Roy.

He formed an exciting left wing partnership with Charlie Napier in the 1938\u201339 season, appearing in 40 matches in all competitions, scoring 11 goals as Wednesday missed out on promotion from the Second Division to city rivals Sheffield United by one point.Sheffield Wednesday Archive Details Sheffield Wednesday career. One of Fallon's best displays for Wednesday was against Norwich City in November 1938 when he teased and tormented the Canaries' defence in a 7\u20130 win.\"The Men Who Made Sheffield Wednesday Football Club\", Tony Matthews,  Fallon had a lucky escape just before Christmas 1938 when the car he was travelling in, together with fellow Wednesday player Ted Catlin, skidded in snow at Wadsley Bridge and hit a telegraph pole. Both players went to hospital and were out of the team for several weeks.\"One Hundred Years at Hillsborough\", Jason Dickinson, , page 94, Gives details of motor accident. On 2 September 1939 Fallon appeared in the final Sheffield Wednesday match before the outbreak of the Second World War against Plymouth Argyle.
