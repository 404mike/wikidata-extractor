He was awarded the title Doctor of Science as a fellow of King's College Cambridge, before working for the Admiralty on numerical modelling of underwater explosions during World War 2.  He continued his work on the physical properties of liquids at the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment at Aldermaston until 1965.\nProfessor Neville Temperley was head of the Applied Mathematics Department at Swansea University for 17 years until his retirement in 1982. He received the Rumford Medal from the Royal Society in 1992.\nHis father, Harold William Vazeille Temperley, was a distinguished British historian.
