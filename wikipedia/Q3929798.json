He has been working with Volap\u00fck since 1972. He is the author of a number of online teaching courses released under the names Volap\u00fck for Everyone and Volap\u00fck in Action, as well as a brief introduction called Volap\u00fck vifik ('Quick Volap\u00fck'). He formed the Flenef Bev\u00fcnetik Volap\u00fcka ('The International Community of Friends of Volap\u00fck'), and has published a magazine V\u00f6g Volap\u00fcka ('The Voice of Volap\u00fck') which followed on from a publication known as Sirk\u00fclapen\u00e4d ('The Newsletter'). His enthusiastic activism in promoting Volap\u00fck is responsible for the majority of people who currently study and learn the language.\nHe became the administrator of the Volap\u00fck movement in 2006 and was a member of the Volap\u00fck Academy from 2007 until 2015. In 2015, he stepped down from all of his engagements in the Volap\u00fck movement due to his age and failing eyesight. He has been an honorary academician (stimakad\u00e4mal) of the International Volap\u00fck Society since December 1, 2015 according to an official edict by the current Cifal, Hermann Phillips..Midgley lives in Scunthorpe in northern England.\nMidgley is notable for having translated Alice's Adventures in Wonderland in to both Neo and Volap\u00fck; the Volap\u00fck translation is forthcoming.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "International Volap\u00fck Academy", "response": ["A revived Volap\u00fck Academy per se continues to this day, with Brian R.

As one of the largest works written in the language over the last century, it has an impact on the development of modern Volap\u00fck neologisms, particularly geographical terms. On the online discussion group Volap\u00fckalised, the Volap\u00fck Wikipedia is the subject of multiple discussions about terminology and usage, being often linked to as a reference for language points. Several prominent figures in the development of Volap\u00fck, including Arden R. Smith, link to V\u00fckiped on their websites and it is predominantly featured on the official website of Flenef Bev\u00fcnetik Volap\u00fcka (\"The International Community of Friends of Volap\u00fck\") maintained by volap\u00fckologists Ralph Midgley and Michael Everson."]}]}}
