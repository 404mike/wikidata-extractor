Despite being able to select from a group of players which included Lions tourists Jason White, Tom Smith, Scott Murray, Gregor Townsend, Gordon Bulloch, Nathan Hines, Chris Cusiter, Mike Blair, Ross Ford and Simon Taylor - as well as experienced players like Jon Petrie and Stuart Grimes - Williams' team only won 17.65% of their matches. Scotland won just three games - against the Tier 2 nations Japan and Samoa in 2004, and against Italy in the 2005 Six Nations. Additionally, Williams controversially discarded Townsend - a celebrated figure in Scottish rugby, then aged only 30 - a week prior to the unveiling of his first national squad, despite an admission that his team lacked experienced centres."]}, {"page": "Ian McGeechan", "response": ["| align=center|24 || 15 June ||  || Thunderbird Stadium, Vancouver || align=center bgcolor=FFCCCC|23\u201326 || rowspan=2|North America tour || rowspan=2|Stuart Grimes || align=center|n/a"]}, {"page": "Doddie Weir", "response": ["His time in the national side declined in later years as the next generation of locks emerged, with the likes of Stuart Grimes and eventual Scotland cap record holder Scott Murray coming into the team.
