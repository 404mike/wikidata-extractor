Originally thought of as a potential replacement for either Jack Charlton or Norman Hunter as the Don Revie Leeds team started to break up. Stevenson had to wait until April 1976 before he got anything like a run of games when he made six successive league appearances replacing Paul Reaney at right back. He had a good run at centre half in 1979 and in midfield in 1981 making a total of 95 appearances.\nIn 1981 a swap deal saw him move to Birmingham City where he played over 100 times. He joined Bristol Rovers in 1985, but decided to retire the following summer aged 29, after struggling with injuries.\nFollowing his retirement from football, Byron became the landlord of the New Inn public house on Elland Road, Churwell, Leeds, which had been managed by another Leeds United and Wales international legend John Charles years earlier.\nStevenson died of throat cancer in September 2007\u2014one day before what would have been his 51st birthday and one day after his grandson\u2019s birthday.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "September 7", "response": ["*  1956   \u2013 Byron Stevenson, Welsh footballer (d. 2007)"]}, {"page": "Llanelli", "response": ["*Byron Stevenson (1956\u20132007), Wales"]}, {"page": "John Charles", "response": ["Following his retirement from football, Charles became the landlord of the New Inn public house on Elland Road, Churwell, Leeds which later was also managed by another Leeds United player and Wales international, Byron Stevenson.

Until shortly before his death he continued to attend every Leeds United home game.

He led the side to another second place finish in the 1977\u201378 British Home Championship, before enjoying a positive start to qualifying for the 1980 European Championships. They began their campaign by defeating Malta 7\u20130 at the Racecourse Ground with Ian Edwards scoring four of his side's goals. This was followed by a 1\u20130 victory over Turkey before they finished the first round of fixtures by losing 2\u20130 to West Germany. A third consecutive second place finish in the 1978\u201379 British Home Championship followed, which included a John Toshack hat-trick in a 3\u20130 win over Scotland, before Malta were defeated again in June 1979. However, the side's good form came to an end as they suffered defeats to West Germany and Turkey to finish third in their group and failed to qualify for the 1980 World Cup. Byron Stevenson later received a four-and-a-half year ban from international football after breaking the jaw of an opposition player in the latter game. The match was also Smith's final game in charge of the national side as he accepted an offer to manage Hull City."]}]}}
