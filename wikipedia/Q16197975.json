In 1980 he went to the Guildhall School of Music and studied trombone with Peter Gane and Denis Wick during that time he was also a member of International Staff Band (1980\u201382) playing bass trombone.\nSince then Barr has had a varied freelance career and several business ventures, including setting up in 1982 which manufactured and distributed leather gig bags. Initially the gig bags were manufactured in Telford and later Hay-on-Wye but due to retirement of the key craftsman there has been a break in manufacture. Today the gig bags are manufactured in Grantham, Lincolnshire. In the early nineties he became a shareholder of Sterling Brass Instruments which are still manufactured today.\nHe has been a member of the Michael Nyman Band since 1988 and undertaken many tours with the ensemble all over the world, including Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, New Zealand, Australia, Spain, Europe, US, Mexico, Russia and Slovenia.\nIn 1992 Michael Nyman asked Barr to become his manager he became involved with the business of music publishing, film scores and recording contracts. This has led to further consultancy roles with many composers and film companies in the UK and US.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Prospero's Books", "response": ["*Nigel Barr, bass trombone"]}, {"page": "Facing Goya", "response": ["*Nigel Barr, bass trombone, tuba, euphonium"]}, {"page": "Michael Nyman Band", "response": ["*Nigel Barr (1991\u2013), bass trombone, euphonium, tuba"]}, {"page": "\u00c0 la folie", "response": ["*Nigel Barr\u00a0\u2013 Trombone/Tuba", "*Artist representative for Michael Nyman:  Nigel Barr"]}, {"page": "The Michael Nyman Songbook", "response": ["*Nigel Barr, bass trombone, euphonium", "*Nigel Barr, bass trombone and euphonium"]}, {"page": "Michael Nyman Live", "response": ["**Nigel Barr, trombone/tuba/euphonium", "*artist representative for Michael Nyman: Nigel Barr"]}, {"page": "The Piano (soundtrack)", "response": ["*Artist representative for Michael Nyman:  Nigel Barr"]}, {"page": "The Ogre (1996 film)", "response": ["*Nigel Barr, bass trombone/tuba", "*Artist representative for Michael Nyman: Nigel Barr"]}, {"page": "Noises, Sounds & Sweet Airs", "response": ["*Artist representative for Michael Nyman:  Nigel Barr"]}, {"page": "The Essential Michael Nyman Band", "response": ["*Nigel Barr, bass trombone, euphonium"]}, {"page": "Michael Nyman for Yohji Yamamoto", "response": ["*Composer's representative: Nigel Barr, Michael Nyman Ltd."]}, {"page": "After Extra Time (album)", "response": ["*Nigel Barr, bass trombone", "*Nigel Barr, bass trombone", "*Nigel Barr, bass trombone, euphonium"]}, {"page": "Time Will Pronounce", "response": ["*Artist representative: Nigel Barr"]}, {"page": "The Suit and the Photograph", "response": ["*Special thanks to Michael J.
