However he struggled to break into Graham Alexander's first-team plans, with Ibou Touray preferred at left-back, and was limited to just three league games. On 10 February 2020, he rejoined Barrow on loan until the end of the 2019\u201320 season. Manager Ian Evatt stated that Jones would provide fresh competition for a team aiming to win the league and that he would provide cover for the centre-back position with Josh Granite out injured. He was limited to just four appearances during his second spell at Holker Street however, as due to the COVID-19 pandemic in England the season was curtailed early on 16 March, and Barrow were promoted as league winners on a points-per-game basis."]}]}}
