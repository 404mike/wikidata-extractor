This measure, generalized by Maasoumi and Zandvakili, is now generally referred to as Shorrocks index, sometimes as Shorrocks mobility index or Shorrocks rigidity index. It attempts to estimate whether the income inequality Gini coefficient is permanent or temporary, and to what extent a country or region enables economic mobility to its people so that they can move from one (e.g., bottom 20%) income quantile to another (e.g., middle 20%) over time. In other words, Shorrocks index compares inequality of short-term earnings such as the annual income of households, to inequality of long-term earnings such as 5-year or 10-year total income for the same households."]}, {"page": "October 30", "response": ["*  1946   \u2013 Anthony Shorrocks, English economist, author, and academic"]}, {"page": "List of University of Essex people", "response": ["* Anthony Shorrocks - Professor of Economics "]}, {"page": "Wealth distribution by country", "response": ["Data for the following tables is obtained from The UN-WIDER World Distribution of Household Wealth Report.The World Distribution of Household Wealth.
