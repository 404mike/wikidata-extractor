He accepted it on the condition that he should receive the interest during his lifetime and that the principal should be returned to the donors on his death.

In 1792 the Regius Greek Professorship at Cambridge became vacant with the resignation of William Cooke. Porson was elected without opposition and held the chair until his death.
