While  still in high school, he studied with John Berryman at a summer writing conference at the University of Utah in 1959 and kept in touch with Berryman for the rest of the latter's life. Matthias attended the Ohio State University and Stanford University. While in graduate school at Stanford he studied under the poet and critic Yvor Winters but did not conform to Winters's anti-modernist position. In fact, Matthias became deeply interested in modernism, especially British modernism. His interest in British modernism was informed by many years of residence in England, editing the anthology 23 Modern British Poets, published in 1970. His peers at Stanford included two future poets laureate of the United States, Robert Hass and Robert Pinsky, as well as the poets Ken Fields, James L. McMichael, and John Peck. When he left Stanford in 1966, he spent a year in London as a Fulbright Scholar where he met Diana C. J. Adams (Feb. 5, 1945 - Nov. 26, 2020), and married her a year later. Diana's distinguished family includes several artists and writers, including her brother-in-law Wayland Young (Lord Kennet), the sculptor Emily Young, and the novelist Louisa Young. Many of Matthias's poems deal with this family. In 1976 Matthias became a Visiting Fellow of Clare Hall, Cambridge, and has since 1977 been a Life Member. Although his main academic job has been at the University of Notre Dame, he has spent much of his professional life in Britain, where he did major scholarly work on the Anglo-Welsh poet and painter David Jones, editing both the poetry and essays on Jones's work for Faber and Faber, the National Poetry Foundation, and University of Wales Press."]}, {"page": "Zizou Corder", "response": ["#REDIRECT Louisa Young"]}, {"page": "List of books from the Richard & Judy Book Club", "response": ["* Louisa Young \u2013 My Dear i Wanted To Tell You"]}, {"page": "Elizabeth Young, Lady Kennet", "response": ["In 1948, she married the Hon Wayland Hilton Young, 2nd Baron Kennet (2 August 1923 \u2013 7 May 2009), who inherited the title of Baron Kennet in 1960 on the death of his father, the politician Edward Hilton Young, 1st Baron Kennet.
