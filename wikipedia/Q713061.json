John Whitelocke's 1807 defeat upon Britain's second attempt to conquer Buenos Aires, whereby the area became known as the \"Field of Glory\". The Revolution of 1810 brought an autonomous government to Buenos Aires, which entrusted the Mounted Grenadiers to Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn and allowed him to establish his main barracks at the plaza.  An 1813 resolution abolished the slave trade in the United Provinces of the R\u00edo de la Plata and the slave quarters were shuttered.  Following his decisive military victories, Gen. San Mart\u00edn was forced into exile in 1824 for political reasons; but a reappraisal of his place in history led to his becoming nearly eponymous in Argentina after his death in 1850.  Accordingly, French sculptor Louis-Joseph Daumas was commissioned in 1862 to create an equestrian statue of the hero of the Wars for Independence and the square was renamed in his honor in 1878, upon the hundredth anniversary of his birth."]}, {"page": "Whitelocke", "response": ["*John Whitelocke (1757\u20131833), British soldier"]}, {"page": "List of colonial governors of Saint-Domingue", "response": ["#September 20, 1793 - October 1794  John Whitelocke"]}, {"page": "List of governors of Portsmouth", "response": ["*25 June 1799: Major-General John Whitelocke"]}, {"page": "John Mawe", "response": ["In August 1804 he started on a \"voyage of commercial experiment\" to Rio de la Plata funded by Portugal's Prince Regent.

In the ill-organised assault on that town Nicolls found himself isolated with seven companies of his regiment, his colonel having become separated with one or two companies from the main body of the 45th. In this trying position he displayed conspicuous resolution, and, repelling the attack of the enemy, held his ground. On the following day, in pursuance of an arrangement between Whitelocke and the Spanish general Liniers, Nicolls, together with the other isolated bodies, evacuated the town. The 45th, unlike several other bodies of British troops, did not surrender, and Nicolls refused to give up the colours of his regiment. So conspicuous was his conduct on this occasion that Whitelocke in his despatches thus writes of him: \"Nor should I omit the gallant conduct of Major Nichols [sic] of the 45th regiment, who, on the morning of the 6th instant, being pressed by the enemy near the Presidentia, charged them with great spirit and took two howitzers and many prisoners\".
