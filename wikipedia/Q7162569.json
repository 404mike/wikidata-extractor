She edited Sight & Sound for almost 35 years.\nBorn in Kensington, London, she was the daughter of Duncan McNeill Houston and his wife  Eilean (n\u00e9e Marlowe). Her father was a rubber broker, while her maternal grandfather was Thomas Marlowe, an early editor of the Daily Mail. She attended Wimbledon High School, before winning a scholarship to Roedean School, near Brighton; the school was evacuated to the Lake District during the war.In 1947 she was the first editor of the short-lived film journal Sequence founded by Lindsay Anderson, Karel Reisz and Gavin Lambert at Oxford University, where she read modern history at Somerville College, and graduated from Oxford with a double first in 1949. For a year, she worked in Whitehall on research into the history of the second world war.In 1950, she joined Sight & Sound, the journal of the  British Film Institute, as Lambert's assistant. During this early period, she was involved around 1952 with initiating the feature for which the magazine remains best known, the critics' decade poll for the 10 best films ever made. Houston did not create the feature, which she described in September 1962 as an \"impossible but intriguing game\", but she was responsible for its high profile.Houston became the editor of Sight & Sound, then a quarterly journal, in 1956 after Lambert departed for a career as a Hollywood screenwriter. She remained in the post until 1990. At the same time, she was a regular contributor to the Monthly Film Bulletin for many years until the mid-1970s. (The two magazines merged shortly after Houston retired). In the late 1960s and early 1970s she oversaw publication of the BFI's \"Cinema One\" book series. She also had a period as a film critic for The Spectator, deputised for The Times critic and for The Observer as C. A. Lejeune's deputy in 1957. She also wrote for The Observer and, occasionally, for The Guardian.Houston was the author of several books on cinema, including The Contemporary Cinema (1963) and Keepers of the Frame: Film Archives (1994). She also wrote a short book on a film directed by Alberto Cavalcanti, Went the Day Well? (1942).Houston was an amateur player of golf and a follower of horse racing, on which she gambled. She commented in 2001: \"I wouldn\u2019t go into film criticism now if you offered me the top job on a plate. It is so boring. Who wants to spend their days looking at special effects movies from Hollywood made for 15-year-olds?\"Her younger brother, Tom, survived her.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Greed (1924 film)", "response": ["In the early 1950s Greeds reputation began to grow and it appeared on several lists of the greatest films ever made. In 1952 at the Festival Mondial du Film et des Beaux Arts de Belgique, Greed was named the fifth greatest film ever made, with such directors as Luchino Visconti, Orson Welles, Luis Bu\u00f1uel and Billy Wilder voting for it. Later in 1952 Sight and Sound magazine published its first list of the \"ten greatest films ever made\". Greed was tied for 7th place on that list, with such critics as Andre Bazin, Lotte Eisner, Curtis Harrington, Penelope Houston and Gavin Lambert voting for it. In 1962 it was tied for 4th on the same list. Since 1972 it has failed to reach a spot on the top ten. The Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que royale de Belgique released a list of \"the most important and misappreciated American films of all time\" in 1978. Greed was third on its list after Citizen Kane and Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans. In a University of Southern California list of the \"50 Most Significant American Films\" made by the school's Performing Arts Council, Greed was listed as number 21. In 1991 Greed was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\"."]}, {"page": "Sight & Sound", "response": ["Sight & Sound was first published in 1932 and in 1934 management of the magazine was handed to the nascent British Film Institute (BFI), which still publishes the magazine today. Sight & Sound was published quarterly for most of its history until the early 1990s, apart from a brief run as a monthly publication in the early 1950s, but in 1991 it merged with another BFI publication, the Monthly Film Bulletin, and started to appear monthly. The journal was edited by Gavin Lambert from 1949 to 1955, and from 1956 to 1990 by Penelope Houston. The relaunch editor was Philip Dodd. It is currently edited by Mike Williams. The magazine reviews all film releases each month, including those with a limited (art house) release, as opposed to most film magazines which concentrate on those films with a general release.

The chairman of the award ceremony, Ren\u00e9 Clair, was initially reluctant to give it the coveted prize; he eventually acquiesced, but not before saying to Houston: \"I hope Ray will go away and learn how to make films!\"  The Japanese director Akira Kurosawa had an important film entered in that year's festival competition, Throne of Blood (Kumonosu-j\u014d), which lost to Ray's film.

In the view of Tom Milne of Monthly Film Bulletin, Roeg's combined work on Performance, Walkabout and Don't Look Now put him \"right up at the top as film-maker\". George Melly similarly wrote in The Observer that Roeg had joined \"that handful of names whose appearance at the end of the credit titles automatically creates a sense of anticipation\". Penelope Houston for Sight & Sound also found much to appreciate in Roeg's direction: \"Roeg deploys subtle powers of direction and Hitchcockian misdirection.\" American critics were similarly impressed with Roeg's work on the film. Jay Cocks regarded Don't Look Now to be Roeg's best work by far and that Roeg was one of \"those rare talents that can effect a new way of seeing\". Cocks also felt that the film was a marked improvement on the novella, noting that a reading \"makes one appreciate Roeg and Screenwriters [Allan] Scott and [Chris] Bryant all the more. Film and story share certain basic elements of plot and an ending of cruel surprise. The story is detached, almost cursory. Roeg and his collaborators have constructed an intricate, intense speculation about levels of perception and reality.\" Roger Ebert in his review for the Chicago Sun-Times commented that Roeg is \"a genius at filling his frame with threatening forms and compositions\", while Pauline Kael labelled him \"chillingly chic\" in hers. Even Vincent Canby, whose opinion of the film was negative overall, praised Roeg for being able to \"maintain a sense of menace long after the screenplay has any right to expect it\"."]}, {"page": "Torn Curtain", "response": ["Hitchcock's  work was not the darling of the critics. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times called the film \"a pathetically undistinguished spy picture, and the obvious reason is that the script is a collection of what Mr. Hitchcock most eschews\u2014clich\u00e9s.\" Penelope Houston, writing for Sight & Sound, commented: \"What went wrong here, one suspects, was something basic in the story line.\"Mc Gilligan, Alfred Hitchcock, p. 675  The reviewer in Variety said: \"Some good plot ideas are marred by routine dialogue, and a too relaxed pace contributed to a dull overlength,\" adding \"Hitchcock freshens up his bag of tricks in a good potpourri which becomes a bit stale though a noticeable lack of zip and pacing.\" \"Awful,\" \"preposterous,\" and \"irritating slack,\" concluded Renata Adler in The New Yorker. The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote, \"Up until about the point at which the plot makes itself clear, Torn Curtain is as good as anything Hitchcock has ever done in his other forty-nine (or is it fifty-one?) films ... The let-down comes with the verdant studio hillock that was surely never meant to fool anyone, and after this the film drops like a stone, without impetus, without imagination, without interest.\""]}, {"page": "A Clockwork Orange (film)", "response": ["Author Paul Duncan said of Alex: \"Alex is the narrator so we see everything from his point of view, including his mental images.

Psychiatrist Aaron Stern, the former head of the MPAA rating board, believed that Alex represents man in his natural state, the unconscious mind. Alex becomes \"civilised\" after receiving his Ludovico \"cure\" and the sickness in the aftermath Stern considered to be the \"neurosis imposed by society\". Kubrick told film critics Philip Strick and Penelope Houston that he believed Alex \"makes no attempt to deceive himself or the audience as to his total corruption or wickedness.

S. Lewis. At Oxford, he befriended Penelope Houston and filmmakers Karel Reisz and Lindsay Anderson, and they founded a short-lived but influential journal, Sequence, which was originally edited by Houston. The magazine, which lasted for only 15 issues, moved to London after the fifth issue, and Lambert and Anderson took over as co-editors. Lambert eventually left Oxford without obtaining a degree. From 1949 to 1956 he edited the journal Sight and Sound, again with Anderson as a regular contributor. At about the same time Lambert was deeply involved in Britain's Free Cinema movement which called for more social realism in contemporary movies. He also wrote film criticism for The Sunday Times and The Guardian. In late 1955, he moved to Hollywood, California, to work as a personal assistant to director Nicholas Ray and worked on the script (uncredited) for Ray's Bigger Than Life (1956).

However, after New York Times critic Bosley Crowther's unfavorable advance review, American distributor Harry Saltzman decided to give the film little publicity and minimal distribution when it was released in the U.S. the next year.Wakeman, John. World Film Directors, Volume 1. The H. W. Wilson Company. 1987. pp. 1181.  Critical reception on its first release was mostly negative; the film was not regarded as one of Welles' best until years later. Crowther criticized the film's poor audio track and called it \"a confusing patchwork of scenes and characters\u00a0...\u00a0designed to give major exposure to Jack Falstaff.\" Welles' performance, he said, was \"a dissolute, bumbling street-corner Santa Claus.\" Penelope Houston called it \"a film which seems to turn its back on brilliance.\" A Time review also criticized Welles, stating that \"[he] is probably the first actor in the history of the theater to appear too fat for the role\u00a0...\u00a0he takes command of scenes less with spoken English than with body English\", but that he is \"never entirely bad.\""]}, {"page": "Mouchette", "response": ["The \"critics consensus\" at the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes states: \"Remarkable not only as a viewing experience, but as a showcase for Robert Bresson's tremendous skill, Mouchette underpins its grim narrative with devastating grace.\" In The Spectator, the critic Penelope Houston highlighted the excellence of Nadine Nortier's performance as Mouchette, writing that, as a consequence, \"the whole film becomes luminous, transparent, bafflingly effortless\", resulting in \"a kind of perfection\". Noting the lack of sentimentality or sadism in Bresson's portrayal of Mouchette's suffering, Houston writes that \"Mouchette is not a child for anyone's pity, except, in both senses, her creator's.\" She concludes that \"Like Au Hasard, Balthazar, Mouchette is a deeply pessimistic film which somehow leaves one in a mood close to exhilaration. It is conceived, if you like, as a religious experience in which the heroine is not a saint, and in which there is no conventional religious reference.\""]}, {"page": "My Night at Maud's", "response": ["When the film was released in France in 1969, it received mixed reviews. Guy Teisseire of L'Aurore wrote that \"The best compliment we can pay \u00c9ric Rohmer is to have done with My Night at Maud's a talking film.  I mean the opposite of a talkative film where the text would be used to fill the gaps: that is to say, a work in which eloquent silences are felt as lack of understanding about both is constant.\" Claude Garson of L'Aurore said that \"We do not underestimate the ambition of such a work, but we say right away that film, with its own laws, does not lend itself to such a subject. The theater, or the conference would have better served the purpose of the authors, because such controversies have nothing photogenic, apart from the presence of the beautiful Fran\u00e7oise Fabian and that very good actor Jean-Louis Trintignant.\" Henry Chapier of Combat called it \"a bit stiff and intellectual\". Jean Rochereau of La Croix called it \"A masterpiece ... whose superb insolence toward everyone excites me and fills me.\" Jean de Baroncelli of Le Monde wrote that \"It is a work that demands from the viewer a minimum of attention and complicity. We find ourselves on the fringes of worries and obsessions of the time: its commitment goes beyond the everyday. Yet this is, in our view, worth the price. ...

As the sets seem to grow bigger and bigger, so progressively the actors dwindle.\" Judith Crist, in her review for the New York Herald Tribune, concurred: \"So grand and grandiose are the sets that the characters are dwarfed, and so wide is his screen that this concentration on character results in a strangely static epic in which the overblown close-ups are interrupted at best by a pageant or dance, more often by unexciting bits and pieces of exits, entrances, marches or battles.\" Even Elizabeth Taylor found it wanting, saying, \"They had cut out the heart, the essence, the motivations, the very core, and tacked on all those battle scenes.
