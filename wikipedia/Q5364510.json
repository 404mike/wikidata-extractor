Kate Chopin's The Awakening (1899) also deserves mention, especially within the context of narratives derived from Flaubert's Madame Bovary (1856), both of which chronicle a woman's doomed search for independence and self-realization through sexual experimentation."]}, {"page": "The Secret Garden", "response": ["Maytham Hall in Kent, England, where Burnett lived for a number of years during her marriage, is often cited as the inspiration for the book's setting. Biographer Ann Thwaite writes that while the rose garden at Mayham Hall may have been \"crucial\" to the novel's development, Maytham Hall and Misselthwaite Manor are physically very different.  Thwaite suggests that, for the setting of The Secret Garden, Burnett may have been inspired by the moors of Emily Bront\u00eb's 1847 novel Wuthering Heights, given that Burnett only went once to Yorkshire, to Fryston Hall. She writes that Burnett may have also taken inspiration from Charlotte Bront\u00eb's 1847 novel Jane Eyre, noting parallels between the two narratives: both of them, for example, feature orphans sent to \"mysterious mansions,\" whose master is largely absent. Burnett herself was aware of the similarities, remarking in a letter that Ella Hepworth Dixon had described it as a children's version of Jane Eyre."]}, {"page": "William Hepworth Dixon", "response": ["Dixon lost most of his savings, invested in Turkish stock.
