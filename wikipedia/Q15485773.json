Although dismissed from two schemes within days of each other, as a result of construction problems, his contribution as a civil engineer was great.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Chelmer and Blackwater Navigation", "response": ["The Navigation experienced some teething problems, with floods in 1797 creating shoals which prevented the passage of barges. These got steadily worse, until Rennie was called back in 1799 to address the problem. Rennie was again recalled in 1805, when the mill owners complained about leakage through the locks and requested damages. Further improvements were made, including the rebuilding of Heybridge sea lock by James Green, and trade developed steadily. The first inland gasworks in Britain was built in Chelmsford in 1819, using coal brought up the navigation. Besides coal, bricks, stone, timber and general cargo was carried from Heybridge to Chelmsford, and the major cargo in the reverse direction was grain and flour. Local wharfs served the communities of Little Baddow, Boreham, Ulting and Heybridge. At its peak in the mid 19th century, the canal was carrying over 60,000 tons of cargo per year."]}, {"page": "Liskeard and Looe Union Canal", "response": ["After at least one other abortive proposal, a local solicitor Peter Glubb convened a meeting on 2 August 1823 in Liskeard to agree the way forward.

He swiftly presented his views, on 30 August, recommending a tub-boat canal, suitable for four-ton boats in trains (i.e. connected groups).

On completion, responsibility for the marsh passed Marsh Inspectors, who sanctioned further work in 1854, involving the straightening and embanking of the River Caen, or Braunton Pill, to form the Braunton Canal.

In many respects, it was similar to those later built by James Green on the Grand Western Canal, which also used counterbalanced caissons. However, there were differences. One was that Fussell's design used chains which passed round wheels attached to the caisson, the end of which was fixed to the top of the structure, whereas Green fixed his chains to a bar on the caisson. Fussells design included guide rails running up the chamber, which steadied the caisson, and he used a separate chamber beneath the caisson to hold extra water, which made the top tank heavier, and thus provided the motive power to cause the lift to operate. The design of his balance lock formed the basis for a patent application, number 2284, which he obtained in 1798."]}, {"page": "James Green", "response": ["* James Green (New Zealand politician) (1836\u20131905), New Zealand politician", "* James Green (basketball) (born 1960), American basketball coach", "* James Green (Canadian football) (born 1983), Canadian football player", "* James Green (rugby league) (born 1990), English rugby league player with Hull KR and Castleford Tigers", "* James Green (wrestler) (born 1992), American amateur wrestler", "* James Green (footballer) (1879\u20131940), English footballer for Preston North End", "* James Green (bishop) (born 1950), American Roman Catholic archbishop and diplomat", "* James Green (artist) (1771\u20131834), English portrait-painter", "* James Green (author) (born 1944), English author and broadcaster", "* James Green (engineer) (1781\u20131849), British engineer who worked on the Grand Western, Rolle and Chard Canals", "* James Green (historian) (1944\u20132016), American historian and labor activist", "* James Green (RFC airman) (1897\u20131917), British World War I flying ace", "* Woody Rock (James Green, born 1976), American singer and musician from Dru Hill", "*James Greene (disambiguation)", "*James Green Martin (1819\u20131878), Confederate soldier"]}, {"page": "RHS Garden Rosemoor", "response": ["The Rolle Canal (completed in 1827) terminated at a complex of large lime kilns at Rosemoor (known then as \"Rowe's Moor\").
