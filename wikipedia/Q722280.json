He refused to open state granaries, and instead launched a series of \"anti-grain concealment\" drives that resulted in numerous purges and suicides. Other violent campaigns followed in which party leaders went from village to village in search of hidden food reserves, and not only grain, as Mao issued quotas for pigs, chickens, ducks and eggs. Many peasants accused of hiding food were tortured and beaten to death.", "The Great Leap Forward was a tragedy for the vast majority of the Chinese. Although the steel quotas were officially reached, almost all of the supposed steel made in the countryside was iron, as it had been made from assorted scrap metal in home-made furnaces with no reliable source of fuel such as coal. This meant that proper smelting conditions could not be achieved. According to Zhang Rongmei, a geometry teacher in rural Shanghai during the Great Leap Forward: \"We took all the furniture, pots, and pans we had in our house, and all our neighbours did likewise. We put everything in a big fire and melted down all the metal\".  The worst of the famine was steered towards enemies of the state. Jasper Becker explains: \"The most vulnerable section of China's population, around five per cent, were those whom Mao called 'enemies of the people'. Anyone who had in previous campaigns of repression been labeled a 'black element' was given the lowest priority in the allocation of food. Landlords, rich peasants, former members of the nationalist regime, religious leaders, rightists, counter-revolutionaries and the families of such individuals died in the greatest numbers.\""]}, {"page": "Great Leap Forward", "response": ["Around 6 to 8% of those who died during the Great Leap Forward were tortured to death or summarily killed.Jasper Becker.

The Spectator, September 25, 2010.", "With dramatically reduced yields, even urban areas received greatly reduced rations; however, mass starvation was largely confined to the countryside, where, as a result of drastically inflated production statistics, very little grain was left for the peasants to eat. Food shortages were bad throughout the country; however, the provinces which had adopted Mao's reforms with the most vigor, such as Anhui, Gansu and Henan, tended to suffer disproportionately. Sichuan, one of China's most populous provinces, known in China as \"Heaven's Granary\" because of its fertility, is thought to have suffered the highest number of deaths from starvation due to the vigor with which provincial leader Li Jingquan undertook Mao's reforms. During the Great Leap Forward, cases of cannibalism also occurred in the parts of China that were severely affected by famine.Bernstein, Richard. Horror of a Hidden Chinese Famine . New York Times February 5, 1997.  Bernstein reviews Hungry Ghosts by Jasper Becker.", "According to Jasper Becker, under-reporting of deaths was also a problem. The death registration system, which was inadequate before the famine,Banister (1987). p.\u00a085. was completely overwhelmed by the large number of deaths during the famine.Becker (1996). pp.\u00a0268\u2013269.Dik\u00f6tter (2010) p.\u00a0327. In addition, he claims that many deaths went unreported so that family members of the deceased could continue to draw the deceased's food ration and that counting the number of children who both were born and died between the 1953 and 1964 censuses is problematic. However, Ashton, et al. believe that because the reported number of births during the GLF seems accurate, the reported number of deaths should be accurate as well.Ashton et al. (1984). p.\u00a0617.

Those labeled as \"black elements\" (religious leaders, rightists, rich peasants, etc.) in any previous campaign were given the lowest priority in the allocation of food, and therefore died in the greatest numbers.

When Mao Zedong's Great Leap Forward (1958\u20131961) created an artificial famine, Mao publicly blamed the nation's food shortages on the greed of rich peasants, who were supposedly hiding China's huge surplus production from the government. Zhao subsequently led a local campaign aimed at torturing peasants into revealing their food supplies, which did not exist. On the other hand, Zhao worked with regional party officials to put in place arrangements that allowed peasents to profit from the sale of their crops. These projects were masked by ambiguous names such as \"a control system for field management\" to hide them from Mao, who would have forbidden the projects. According to Zhao, areas where these plans were implemented had a much lower death toll from famine. Jasper Becker, however, wrote that Zhao's torture campaign during the Great Leap meant he was partially responsible for the millions of people who died from starvation and malnutrition in Guangdong between 1958 and 1961."]}, {"page": "Empress Dowager Cixi", "response": ["For many years, the mainstream view of Empress Dowager Cixi was that she was a devious despot who contributed in no small part to China's slide into corruption, anarchy, and revolution.

However, the totals that include research by Wiezhi, Heidenrich, Glasser, Possony, Ponton, Tsaplin and Nove do not include other periods of time beyond Stalin or Mao's rule, thus it may be possible when including other communist states to reach higher totals.

Jasper Becker's book is its first foundation.", "Isabel Hilton of The Independent wrote: Jasper Becker has pieced together one of the most terrible events of the century.. The horror of the story lies in the determined denial of reality that ran from Mao's crazed vision at the top to the false reporting of miracles by local cadres at the bottom... these accounts are meticulously researched and compellingly told... Jasper Becker has achieved that rare feat of exploring a theme in Chinese history - the recurring threat of hunger - and bringing the reader to an understanding of its true importance in the memory of the Chinese people and its tragic role in the political drama. He also offers a small memorial to those uncounted millions, a memorial the leaders who brought about those deaths will never erect.", "A reviewer in The China Journal stated that \"Becker does for China what Robert Conquest did for the Soviet Union in his book Harvest of Sorrow...it is the matter of democracy and human rights which, in the end, emerges most clearly from Jasper Becker's work\" but felt that there were \"aspects of the book which are not altogether satisfactory.\" The reviewer felt that Becker \"almost completely overlooks the Soviet agrarian debate of the 1920s\" and he gave \"lurid treatment of the matter of cannibalism in China.\" Additionally, the reviewer wrote that Becker seems prepared to entertain almost any story about the scale of the famine, without sceptical reflections or observations on statistical methodology...The lack of restraint is dissatisfying, not least because the underlying finding of the book is that it was the tendency to exaggerate and play fast and loose with statistics in the interest of propaganda which helped to bring about the famine itself."]}, {"page": "On China", "response": ["Jasper Becker, a British author and commentator, criticised Kissinger\u2019s book for failing to address the key question \"why and how did President Richard Nixon decide that it was in America's interests to protect communist China?\". Becker contends that Kissinger failed to articulate why exactly America believed it had to protect China from a Chinese-Soviet war. Becker contests Kissinger's rationale behind backing China detailed in the book, suggesting the Soviet Union was a more expansionary, aggressive power. Becker believes Chinas decision to send troops to Korea, Vietnam, Burma and Cambodia, whilst financing the training of insurgents in other countries, exhibited parallel aggression to the Soviet Union. Additionally, the review deplored Kissinger's examination of Chinese leadership, expressing that Kissinger accepted what Chinese leaders said and did at face value without challenge with Becker declaring \"has no curiosity at all: he never looks behind the curtain\". He believes the \"Chinese couldn't believe their luck in finding such a naive and biddable partner as Kissinger\"."]}]}}
