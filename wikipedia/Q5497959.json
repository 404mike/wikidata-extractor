In the December 1910 general election was elected as the MP for Pontefract in the West Riding of Yorkshire by 52 votes, being less than 2% of the votes cast. At the 1918 general election, his scandalous seizure of a company resulting in nearly \u00a35000 of damages plus legal fees awarded against him, led to the party forcing him to contest the new firmly coal-mining-centric seat, several miles south, Wentworth, where was defeated by the Labour candidate in what has proved by length of tenure that party's safest seat to the present date, if counting its main successor as a continuation.  Pontefract remained a Liberal win for two further elections.\nWhilst in Parliament, he led the government inquiry into the Marconi scandal of 1912.In 1917, he was found liable and guilty of fraud in the high-profile case of Gruban v Booth, having defrauded a German-born businessman of his company  and had him interned.", "link_mentions": {}}}
