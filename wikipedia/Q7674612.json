The Official Launch of Camogie took place with the first public match between Craobh an Ch\u00e9itinnigh (Keatings branch of the Gaelic League) and C\u00fachulainns on 17 July at a Feis in Navan. The sport's governing body, the Camogie Association or An Cumann Cam\u00f3ga\u00edochta was founded in 1905 and re-constituted in 1911, 1923 and 1939.

Thus, although camogie was founded by women, and independently run (although closely linked to the GAA), there was, from the outset, a small yet powerful male presence within its administrative ranks. It was no surprise that camogie emanated from the Gaelic League, nor that it would be dependent upon the structures and networks provided by that organisation during the initial expansion of the sport. Of all the cultural nationalist organisations for adults that emerged during the fin de si\u00e8cle, the Gaelic League was the only one to accept female and male members on an equal footing.R\u00edona Nic Cong\u00e1il \u201c'Looking on for centuries from the side-line': Gaelic Feminism and the rise of Camogie\", \u00c9ire-Ireland (Spring / Summer 2013): 168\u2013192.Gaelic Feminism and the rise of Camogie"]}, {"page": "George Moore (novelist)", "response": ["Moore published two books of prose fiction set in Ireland around this time; a second book of short stories, The Untilled Field (1903) and a novel, The Lake (1905).
