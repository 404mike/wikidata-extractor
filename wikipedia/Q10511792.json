Born in Darlington, County Durham, he joined the Darlington reserve team in March 1928 and played his only league game for the club on 5 May 1928 in the 1\u20133 defeat away at Rotherham United. Later that month, Dodsworth signed for Football League Third Division North side Nelson, following in the footsteps of Jack English, his former manager at Darlington. He was one of a number of Darlington players suspended by The Football Association in relation to alleged irregular payments, and subsequently was unavailable for selection for his new club until January 1929.\nAn injury to the Nelson captain, former England international defender George Wilson, meant that Dodsworth was included in the team for the 3\u20130 win over New Brighton at Seedhill on 2 February 1929. He also played in the following match, a 1\u20133 loss to Wrexham a week later. That proved to be Dodsworth's last Football League game, and in February 1930 he moved back to the north-east to sign for non-league outfit Shildon. He spent six months with the club before moving to Crook Town, where he played for one season before retiring from football in 1931.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1928\u201329 Nelson F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|John Dodsworth"]}, {"page": "Dodsworth, John", "response": ["#redirectJohn Dodsworth"]}]}}
