J.) Morgan, was a British sociologist, who was President of the British Sociological Association (1997\u20131999) and editor of the association's journal Sociology. His research focused on family sociology, gender studies and especially men's studies.\nMorgan was Professor of Sociology at the University of Manchester, where he taught sociology from 1964, and where the Morgan Centre for the Study of Relationships and Personal Life is named in his honour. He also held Visiting Professorships at Keele University and the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. He was co-editor of the Palgrave Studies in Family Sociology book series.\nHe died on 17 June 2020 at the age of 82.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Men's studies", "response": ["It is important to distinguish the specific approach often defined as Critical Studies on Men. This approach was largely developed in the anglophone countries from the early 1980s - especially in the United Kingdom -  centred then around the work of Jeff Hearn, David Morgan and colleagues. The influence of the approach has spread globally since then. It is inspired primarily by a range of feminist perspectives (including socialist and radical) and places emphasis on the need for research and practice to explicitly challenge men's and boys' sexism. Although it explores a very broad range of men's practices, it tends to focus especially on issues related to sexuality and/or men's violences. Although originally largely rooted in sociology, it has since engaged with a broad range of other disciplines including social policy, social work, cultural studies, gender studies, education and law. In more recent years, Critical Studies on Men research has made particular use of comparative and/or transnational perspectives. Like Men's Studies and Masculinity Studies more generally, Critical Studies on Men has been critiqued for its failure to adequately focus on the issue of men's relations with children as a key site for the development of men's oppressive masculinity formations - men's relations with women and men's relations with other men being the two sites which are heavily researched by comparison."]}, {"page": "Janet Finch", "response": ["*David Morgan (sociologist)"]}, {"page": "Sociology of law", "response": ["Notable practitioners of socio-legal studies include Professor Carol Smart, co-director of the Morgan Centre for the Study of Relationships and Personal Life, (named after the sociologist, David Morgan), as well as Professor Mavis Maclean and John Eekelaar who are joint directors of the Oxford Centre for Family Law and Policy (OXFLAP)."]}, {"page": "David Morgan", "response": ["David Morgan may refer to:", "* David Morgan (sociologist) (1937\u20132020), British sociologist", "* David Morgan (art historian), professor of religious studies", "* David Morgan, otherwise Dewi Morgan (1877\u20131971), Welsh bard, scholar and journalist", "* David Morgan (Jacobite) (1690s\u20131746), Welsh lawyer involved in the Jacobite rising of 1745", "* David Morgan (trade unionist) (1840\u20131900), Welsh miners' agent and trade unionist", "* David Morgan (rugby union) (1872\u20131933), Welsh international rugby player", "* David Morgan (cricket administrator) (born 1937), Welsh", "* David Morgan II (born 1993), American football tight end", "* David Morgan (footballer) (born 1994), footballer", "* David Morgan (swimmer) (born 1994), Australian swimmer", "* David Morgan (frontiersman) (1721\u20131813), American frontiersman", "* David Morgan (judge) (1849\u20131912), United States judge who served as Chief Justice of North Dakota", "* David Morgan (composer) (1933\u20131988), British composer", "* David Morgan (engineer) (born 1942), British engineer who claims to have invented the traffic cone", "* David Morgan (businessman) (born 1947), Australian businessman", "* David Morgan (Royal Navy officer) (born 1947), British fighter pilot", "* David Morgan (journalist) (1959\u20132016), Northern Irish television presenter and journalist", "* David Morgan (comedian), British stand-up comedian", "* David Morgan (department store), a department store in Cardiff, Wales", "* David Morgan (psychoanalyst), British psychoanalyst", "* David Morgan, British musician, member of Lovestation"]}, {"page": "British Sociological Association", "response": ["*David Morgan, 1997\u20131999"]}, {"page": "Arthur Lewis Building", "response": ["*David Morgan (the sociologist that the Morgan Centre is named after)"]}, {"page": "Carol Smart", "response": ["*David Morgan (sociologist)"]}, {"page": "Sociology (journal)", "response": ["*David Morgan 1992\u20131993"]}, {"page": "Deaths in June 2020", "response": ["*David Morgan, 82, British sociologist.David Morgan obituary"]}]}}
