In the fall of that year, he and several burglars, Jim Brady, Frank McCoy, Tom McCormack and George Bliss, rented a house next to the First National Bank of Wilmington. On the morning of November 7, Hope and his partners broke into the home of the bank cashier whose home was located nearby. Their intention was to hold the family hostage while the cashier went to the bank to open the safe for them. The servant girl managed to escape from the house, however, and alerted the authorities. Hope and the others were quickly captured by the police. All were given forty lashes and sentenced to ten years in prison on November 23, 1873.Walling, George W.
