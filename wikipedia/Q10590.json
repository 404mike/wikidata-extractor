In July 1996, he joined Hereford United on a free transfer, and went on to play two-and-a-half years of regular first-team football. Mahon signed for Brentford in November 1998, for a fee that rose to \u00a3130,000. He helped the club earn promotion from Division Three during the 1998\u201399 season, and went on to make over 150 appearances for the west London club. He joined Watford for \u00a3150,000 in March 2002, and would later captain the club to promotion into the Premier League.\nMahon then signed for Queens Park Rangers ahead of the 2008\u201309 season, following a successful loan spell the previous season. Injuries hampered the latter stages of his QPR career, and he was briefly loaned out to Crystal Palace in March 2011, although he did not make any appearances for the club. Mahon signed for Notts County on a free transfer in August 2011. He was loaned to Stevenage in February 2013, for the remainder of the 2012\u201313 campaign. Mahon left Notts County at the end of the season, and briefly joined Portsmouth in October 2013 for a one-month spell. He signed for Tamworth in December 2013, playing for the club for the rest of the 2013\u201314 season in what was the final playing role of his football career.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1977", "response": ["** Gavin Mahon, English footballer"]}, {"page": "Peter Ramage", "response": ["He made his debut for the club, starting the whole game, in a 2\u20131 win against Barnsley in the opening game of the season. Since joining Queens Park Rangers, Ramage quickly established himself in the starting line\u2013up, playing in the centre\u2013back position. However, he suffered an injury that saw him miss three matches. But Ramage made his return to the starting line\u2013up against Cardiff City on 8 November 2008 and set up a goal for Gavin Mahon to score the only goal of the game, winning 1\u20130. After not playing for two months, Ramage made his return to the starting line\u2013up against Doncaster Rovers on 10 March 2009, as the club lost 2\u20130. This was followed up by helping Queens Park Rangers keep two clean sheets in the next two matches. At the end of the 2008\u201309 season, he went on to make thirty\u2013four appearances in all competitions."]}, {"page": "2006\u201307 FA Premier League", "response": ["| Gavin Mahon"]}, {"page": "Jay DeMerit", "response": ["Until the 2007\u201308 season, DeMerit often filled the role of Watford's vice-captain, behind then-captain Gavin Mahon. He captained Watford for the first time on December 9, 2006, in the home game against Reading, and re-donned the armband on January 6, 2007, for the 4\u20131 win over Stockport County in the FA Cup third round. On December 15, 2007, it was announced that DeMerit had been named captain, replacing Mahon, whose contract was not being renewed. However, this later proved to be a temporary move, with the captaincy rotating between himself, Danny Shittu, and Richard Lee, before finally being passed to John Eustace, a newly signed central midfielder. In later interviews, DeMerit admitted that this placed strain on his relationship with manager Adrian Boothroyd."]}, {"page": "Al Bangura", "response": ["Discovered by a Watford scout playing for Chertsey Town Youth in 2004, Bangura joined the Hornets youth set-up, and made his debut in a 1\u20130 win over Stoke City at the Britannia Stadium in April 2005, coming on for the injured Gavin Mahon after 30 minutes. Bangura started the following game against West Ham United, on the final day of the 2004\u201305 season. In the 2005\u201306 season he was a regular in the Watford side, making 40 appearances in all competitions. His first goal for the Hornets, was a 90th-minute equaliser in a 2\u20132 draw against Derby County at Vicarage Road in March 2006.

He again made 25 appearances throughout the 2003\u201304 campaign, though injuries helped to ensure that he slipped down the first-team pecking order behind players such as Gavin Mahon, and he disappeared from matchday squads entirely under new boss Aidy Boothroyd. He later commented that: \"Lewington always wanted more experience in his midfield. He would play me for two or three games and then leave me out because I was young but I think it did me more harm than good.\""]}]}}
