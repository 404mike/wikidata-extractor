Other poems followed, and Walpole was briefly taken in but later reconsidered. When Chatterton committed suicide the following year, there were rumours that Walpole's treatment of the young man had played a part. Despite Walpole's scepticism, in 1777, shortly after Edmond Malone's arrival in London, Thomas Tyrwhitt published Chatterton's forgeries as Poems, Supposed to Have Been Written at Bristol, by Thomas Rowley and Others, in the Fifteenth Century. This created a great controversy, with much debate about their authenticity. For the third edition in 1778 he added an appendix arguing against the poems' antiquity, and Thomas Warton, in his The History of English Poetry (1778), devoted an entire chapter to it. Those favouring the authenticity of the Rowley poems responded in late 1781 when, just days apart, Jacob Bryant, a classical scholar, published Observations upon the Poems of Thomas Rowley; in Which the Authenticity of Those Poems is Ascertained, and Jeremiah Milles, Dean of Exeter and President of the Society of Antiquaries of London, published Poems, Supposed to Have Been Written at Bristol, in the Fifteenth Century, by Thomas Rowley, Priest, &c.; With a Commentary in Which the Antiquity of Them Is Considered and Defended."]}, {"page": "World egg", "response": ["Following the etymological line of Jacob Bryant one might also consider with regard to the meaning of M\u00f4t, that according to the Ancient Egyptians Ma'at was the personification of the fundamental order of the universe, without which all of creation would perish.

He argues: \"The true and everliving God the Paynims did not know: Which caused them the name of Gods on creatures to bestow\". to modern times. In 1711, the French historian Antoine Banier in his Mythologie et la fable expliqu\u00e9s par l'histoire (\"The Mythology and Fables of the Ancients, Explained\") presented strong arguments for a euhemerist interpretation of Greek mythology.The Rise of Modern Mythology, 1680\u20131860, Burton Feldman, Robert D. Richardson, Indiana University Press, 2000, p. 86. Jacob Bryant's A New System or Analysis of Ancient Mythology (1744) was also another key work on euhemerism of the period, but argued so from a Biblical basis. Of the early 19th century, George Stanley Faber was another Biblical euhemerist. His work The Origin of Pagan Idolatry (1816) proposed that all the pagan nations worshipped the same gods, who were all deified men. Outside of Biblical influenced literature, some archaeologists embraced euhemerist views since they discovered myths could verify archaeological findings. Heinrich Schliemann was a prominent archaeologist of the 19th century who argued myths had embedded historical truths. Schliemann was an advocate of the historical reality of places and characters mentioned in the works of Homer. He excavated Troy and claimed to have discovered artifacts associated with various figures from Greek mythology, including the Mask of Agamemnon and Priam's Treasure."]}, {"page": "Godfrey Higgins", "response": ["Higgins' main writings were part of the syncretism of the day, which was an attempt to associate Biblical narratives to evidence emerging about other religious traditions.

Blake had engraved plates for the book in the early 1780s, so he would have certainly have been familiar with its content.Erdman (1977: 133n41) As a character, S. Foster Damon believes that Har represents both the \"decadent poetry of Blake's day\"Damon (1988: 174) and the traditional spirit of Christianity. Northrop Frye reaches a similar conclusion, but also sees divergence in the character, arguing that although Har and Heva are based on Adam and Eve, \"Har is distinguished from Adam. Adam is ordinary man in his mixed twofold nature of imagination and Selfhood. Har is the human Selfhood which, though men spend most of their time trying to express it, never achieves reality and is identified only as death. Har, unlike Adam, never outgrows his garden but remains there shut up from the world in a permanent state of near-existence.\" Bloom agrees with this interpretation, arguing that \"Har is natural man, the isolated selfhood.\" Bloom also believes that Har is comparable to Struldbruggs from Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels (1726) and Tithonus from Alfred, Lord Tennyson's poem of the same name (1859). In another sense, Frye suggests that \"Har represents the unborn theory of negative innocence established by obeying a moral law.\" On the other hand, Anne Kostelanetz Mellor sees Har as representing simple innocence and the Vales of Har as representative of Eden.Mellor (1974: 30) 'Har' is the Hebrew word for 'mountain', thus giving an inherent irony to the phrase \"Vales of Har\". Damon believes this conveys the ironic sense that \"he who was a mountain now lives in a vale, cut off from mankind."]}, {"page": "William Vincent (priest)", "response": ["Gleanings from the Asiatick Researches of the learned Dr. Vincent, was privately printed in 1813 by Joseph Thomas Brown.
