Sue Vertue says that the live audience reinvigorated the company because no one had laughed at the material for a few days, as everyone knew it so well. A warm-up comedian updated the studio audiences about any important plot detail, introduced them to the performers, and provided entertainment while cameras and sets were being repositioned. Rob Rouse fulfilled this role for the fourth series."]}, {"page": "The 99p Challenge", "response": ["| Armando Iannucci, Peter Serafinowicz, Miranda Hart, Rob Rouse", "| Armando Iannucci, Rob Rouse, Jon Holmes, Marcus Brigstocke", "| Armando Iannucci, Nick Frost, Rob Rouse, Peter Serafinowicz"]}, {"page": "The Sunday Night Project", "response": ["The Friday Night Project was originally presented by comics Jimmy Carr, Rob Rouse, Sharon Horgan and, as a roving reporter, Lucy Montgomery, with sporadic appearances from Abi Titmuss. The first series began on 4 February 2005 and ran for 8 weeks.", "Series 1 saw a game of bingo played midway through the show specifically designed around the guest host. An example of this includes in Episode 1 where a game of 'Hard Man Bingo' was played as Vinnie Jones was the guest host. Jimmy Carr and the guest host would stand around the bingo machine whilst the guest host would take out a ball with a message or catchphrase on it, as opposed to the traditional numbers. Rob Rouse would act as the bingo caller and add a humorous comment to go with the catchphrase on the ball. The entire audience would have their own bingo card and would cross off the phrase once it was called out. The winner would be the first person to have a completed bingo card and would receive a nice prize. In the event of multiple people completing the card at the same time a near impossible to get spot on tie-break question was asked, regarding the guest host's career or personality. This item was scrapped for Series 2 and hasn't returned since.", "Again a feature only appearing during the first series. This involved a pre-recorded outside broadcast in public places (such as a shopping centre or high street) in which Rob Rouse would aim to bring cheer into the unsuspecting public. This usually meant they were led into a false sense of insecurity only for Rob to appear and sing accompanied by several backing singers."]}, {"page": "15 Storeys High", "response": ["Lock's second series was entitled Sean Lock: 15 Storeys High, and it was also broadcast on Radio 4's \"Late Night on 4\" comedy slot and written by Sean Lock and Martin Trenaman and produced by Chris Neill. These series each consisted of five half-hour episodes. Series one aired from 24 November 1999 to 22 December 1999, and starred Lock, along with Felix Dexter, Jenny Eclair, Tim Mitchell, Tracy-Ann Oberman, Chris Pavlo and Peter Serafinowicz. Series two aired from 24 November 2000 to 22 December 2000, and included roles from Dan Freedman, Alex Lowe, Dan Mersh, Paul Putner, Rob Rouse and Chris Neill. The 15 Storeys High radio series used a different method to present the events going on in other flats in the tower block. It dispensed with the idea of Sean listening in on others using \"Bugger King\", replacing it with a voiceover simply announcing the flat number of the subsequent scene. The show introduced Sean's flatmate Errol (played by Serafinowicz in series 1, episodes 2\u20135)."]}, {"page": "Kathleen Hutchison", "response": ["In February 2007, Hutchison joined television channel Paramount Comedy as Head of New Comedy.
