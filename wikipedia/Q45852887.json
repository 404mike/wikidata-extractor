So at this point, I wasn't too mad about all the double-tracking on Back to Front.\" Johnnie Spence returns from Himself to provide arrangements throughout the album, though Frank Barbara arranged the song \"That's Love\" when Spence was unavailable.", "Similarly to Himself, the album is bookended by short intro and outro songs. The intro track invites listeners to \"join the hunt,\" and seamlessly segues into \"I Hope You Stay\", which concerns romance and unemployment, which is then followed by \"In My Hole,\" an orchestral pop song with a Johnnie Spence-scored trumpet part reminiscent of Hugh Masekela's 1968 jazz hit \"Grazing in the Grass\" and lyrics concerning an introverted 'hermit' who refuses to engage with the world around him. \"Clair\", meanwhile, concerns O'Sullivan's babysitting of Mills' daughter Clair, and finds the singer in his \"distracted interior monologue\" mode. He wrote the song to Clair's parents as \"almost a thank you to them.\" \"That's Love\" is a characteristically off-kilter love song with a doo-wop turnaround chord sequence, while \"Can I Go with You\" is a tribute to the early work of the Beatles, exuding a youthful idealism, themes of young romance and the \"chiming romanticism\" style of Paul McCartney. These songs are followed by \"But I'm Not,\" which features a twelve-bar blues structure in the style of Fats Domino, who O'Sullivan was introduced to by Rick Davies, O'Sullivan's former Rick's Blues bandmate and later a member of Supertramp.

It was produced by Gordon Mills, whom O'Sullivan had contacted after failing to achieve success for three years. The album was originally conceived by O'Sullivan to feature only his voice and piano playing, until Mills persuaded him to use full instrumentation and arrangements by Johnnie Spence. Mills also aided O'Sullivan with his songwriting, which incorporates an observational style and word play, the usage of the latter being influenced by Spike Milligan.", "Gordon Mills produced Himself, which was recorded at Audio International Studios in London with sessions beginning in November 1970. With engineer Peter Rynston, recording sessions would last three hours and would also feature arranger Johnnie Spence. Gilbert O'Sullivan's original intention was to record the album with just piano and voice, but Mills persuaded him to use full instrumentation and string arrangements. In a 1971 interview, O'Sullivan elaborated: \"Gordon says work up to it gradually so probably by the time of my third album it will be done like that. If I'd done it with piano and voice it wouldn't have been successful. It's a question of what fits the songs and I think the backings are appropriate\". Mills had a strong influence even on the structure of the songs, as O'Sullivan would write \"three middle eights and three times as many verses\" and Mills would pick out which lyrics he found best. O'Sullivan considered it \"an awful lot of fun\" to have alternatives to play around with.", "The album begins with a short intro in which O'Sullivan introduces \"this, my first LP debut\". This is followed by \"January Git\", which features a show tune-style horn arrangement by Johnnie Spence. \"Permissive Twit\" was recorded solo in a spare half-hour at the end of a recording session. It tells the story of \"Our Linda\" and her unwanted pregnancy with the baby of the titular twit (\"She thinks his name was Ronald or was it Sid or Len\").  Her family, trying to uphold working class respectability, are mortified about the neighbours knowing but are resigned to letting nature take its course. Watts singled out \"Permissive Twit\" as \"the best song Gilbert has written so far.\" \"Matrimony\", concerning a couple getting wed at the registrar's, garnered much airplay. It saw a belated single release in November 1976 but failed to chart. Despite this lack of chart success, it has become one of O'Sullivan's most famous songs. \"Independent Air\" was one of two songs recorded in the first session for the album, the other being \"Nothing Rhymed\".", "*Johnnie Spence - arrangements"]}, {"page": "I'm a Writer, Not a Fighter", "response": ["The recording of I'm a Writer, Not a Fighter departed from O'Sullivan's previous two albums, as instead of recording within several three hour sessions in various studios, O'Sullivan and his manager and producer Gordon Mills recorded the album \"on and off\" in early 1973 at Mills' recently built studio located beside his home, spending a total of several days in the studio. Mills would play keyboards and add backing vocals to tracks, while a rhythm section was also in place and Johnnie Spence returned to provide string arrangements. Although several overdubs were recorded in the United States, O'Sullivan ultimately referred to the album as largely \"a very ad hock home based project,\" which he felt gave the resulting album a \"continuity running through it, unlike perhaps the previous two albums.\" In August 1973, around the time of the album's completion, O'Sullivan moved house as he felt \"too vulnerable.\"", "*Johnnie Spence \u2013 arrangements"]}, {"page": "A Stranger in My Own Back Yard", "response": ["As with Gilbert O'Sullivan's previous albums, A Stranger in My Own Back Yard was produced by Gordon Mills and arranged by Johnnie Spence.

Shortly after the result was announced, Monro, George Martin and Johnnie Spence sped into the studio to record the song but had to record the song's B-side, \"This Time\", beforehand since Spence had left it until late to hand Vic Fraser the score for the record and the copyist had not finished copying the parts for the orchestra.Monro, Michele (2012) Matt Monro: The Singer's Singer, Titan Books. pp. 224-225.
