The following day McNamara and his assistant Simon Donnelly resigned, to become the new management team at United.

York dropped to the bottom of the table after being beaten 2\u20131 away by Bristol Rovers, in which they took the lead on 41 minutes with an eight-yard volley scored by Oliver. Jermaine Easter equalised for Rovers on 71 minutes, before Matty Taylor scored their winning goal in stoppage time. Cresswell and Greening left the club by mutual consent, while Steve Torpey returned as youth-team coach. York won for the first time in 10 matches after beating Morecambe 2\u20131 at home, which saw them move out of the relegation zone. Winfield opened the scoring with a header from Berrett's cross on 38 minutes, and Berrett doubled the lead in the 52nd minute with a low shot from the edge of the penalty area, before Jamie Devitt scored a consolation goal for Morecambe two minutes later. York drew 1\u20131 away to Mansfield, taking the lead on 10 minutes when Winfield touched in Summerfield's free kick, before the home team equalised later in the first half through Krystian Pearce."]}, {"page": "Craig Hinchcliffe", "response": ["#REDIRECT Craig Hinchliffe"]}]}}
