The telephone would be answered by whomever was passing, who would then walk to Charles' house and knock on the window to let him know there was a call for him.In 1967 he moved from Northern Ireland to London, planning to study civil engineering, but soon began writing for Belfast-based magazine City Week, filing live reviews of Irish groups performing in London, and returned to the music business full-time. He then became manager, agent, lyricist and roadie for progressive rock band Fruupp.\nWhen Fruupp disbanded Charles formed a promotion agency, Asgard, with associate Paul Fenn. The agency's first big signings were English punk bands Radio Stars and the Buzzcocks. Charles' clients now include Tom Waits, Ray Davies, Christy Moore, Don McLean, Waterboys, Nick Lowe, Lisa Ekdahl, Ronnie Spector, Marti Pellow, Ani DiFranco and Paul Carrack.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Paul Charles (disambiguation)", "response": ["Paul Charles is a British novelist, music promoter and talent agent.", "Paul Charles may also refer to:", "*Paul Charles (actor), see After Dark (magazine)", "*Paul Charles (politician) on List of ministers of the Belgian Congo"]}, {"page": "One of Our Aircraft Is Missing", "response": ["* One of Our Jeans is Missing, 2016 Paul Charles novel"]}, {"page": "Magherafelt", "response": ["* Paul Charles (born 1949) \u2013 novelist, music promoter and talent agent"]}, {"page": "Last Dance", "response": ["*The Last Dance, period novel by Paul Charles"]}, {"page": "Charles, Paul", "response": ["#redirectPaul Charles"]}, {"page": "Paul Charles (novelist)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Paul Charles"]}]}}
