By that point World War I was intensifying, and in the wake of public scrutiny over the willingness of sportsmen to join up for the armed forces, the squad enlisted en masse into what became known as McCrae's Battalion. Wilson signed up was not initially called to active duty owing to a dislocated shoulder sustained in a match some time earlier. The Scottish League continued to operate, but Hearts were depleted and had to settle for the runners-up spot. Wilson was selected for the Scottish League XI in March 1915 with club teammate Jimmy Frew."]}]}}
