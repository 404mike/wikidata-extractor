The music for Seasons End was mostly written before Hogarth joined Marillion, and only a couple of songs on it actually have some pieces written by him, these being \"Easter\" and \"The Space\". A number of the lyrics were written by John Helmer, who the band had commissioned before Hogarth joined. Helmer would continue to contribute lyrics throughout the 1990s. \"The Space\" was partly recycled from an unreleased song by Hogarth's old band How We Live titled \"Wrapped in the Flag\".Prog magazine Marillion edition 2021. p.142. Words Dave Everley", "The lyrics on Seasons End, unlike on the two previous albums, are not tied together by a common storyline. The opener, \"The King of Sunset Town\", in John Helmer's original version, was about poverty; however, Hogarth modified it under the impression of the brutal oppression of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 by the Chinese government; the line \"And everyone assembled here / Remembers how it used to be / Before the 27th came\" refers to the 27th Army involved in the massacre. \"Easter\" addresses The Troubles of Northern Ireland (a topic Fish had previously dealt with in \"Forgotten Sons\" in 1983); more indirectly, this also goes for \"Holloway Girl\", which refers to the imprisonment of Judith Ward in Holloway Prison for IRA bombings. \"Seasons End\" addresses climate change (a topic Marillion lyrics would return to in 1998 and 2007)Seasons End  \u2013 the spelling of the title is intentional, referring not to the end of a season (which would be \"Season's End\"), but the end of all seasons as a result of global warming eliminating winter altogether. \"Berlin\" describes the situation in the divided city of Berlin, where Marillion had recorded Misplaced Childhood; the Berlin Wall would eventually come down just weeks after the release of Seasons End."]}, {"page": "The Wishing Tree (band)", "response": ["During the Brave tour of 1994, Rothery was approached by Hannah Stobart, a student of French and Italian, who gave him her demo tape containing \"She Moved Through the Fair\" and Tori Amos's \"Me and a Gun\". Rothery was delighted and began recording further demos with Stobart at his new home studio. After Marillion were dropped by EMI following the 1995 album Afraid of Sunlight, several band members pursued solo projects before they began work on This Strange Engine (1997). During two weeks in early 1996, Rothery recorded acoustic material with Stobart on vocals, Pete Trewavas of Marillion on bass and Paul Craddick of Enchant on drums and keyboards. All music was written by Rothery and Stobart (\"additional vocal melodies\"), while the lyrics were written by regular Marillion collaborator John Helmer. Most songs were written right then, however, a handful had a longer history: \"Nightwater\" was considered for Seasons End (1989), when Steve Hogarth rejected Helmer's lyrics as \"too gothic\"; the chorus of \"Midnight Snow\" and \"Evergreen\" were written during the Holidays in Eden (1991) and Clutching at Straws (1987) sessions, respectively. "]}, {"page": "Carnival of Souls (The Wishing Tree album)", "response": ["The music was mostly written by Rothery; although Stobart gets writing co-credits on each track, her input is described as \"additional vocal melodies\" in the liner notes. Except for one track, all lyrics were written by John Helmer, who regularly contributed lyrics for Marillion after the departure of Fish. Marillion's second singer Steve Hogarth is credited with \"additional vocal melodies\" on one track, \"Nightwater\". This is because the song had originally been rehearsed for Seasons End (1989), but was eventually rejected. Apart from Rothery and Stobart, the lineup includes Marillion's Pete Trewavas on bass guitar, Enchant's drummer Paul Craddick (also on keyboards on some tracks) and Rothery's wife Jo (backing vocals on two tracks). Produced by Rothery, the album was recorded and mixed with the help of Stewart Every and Mike Hunter, both longtime engineers with Marillion."]}]}}
