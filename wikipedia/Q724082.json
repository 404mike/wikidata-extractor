During the vacuum tube era they were used as oscillators in electronic organs and horizontal deflection circuits and time bases for CRT oscilloscopes; one of the most common was the Miller integrator circuit invented by Alan Blumlein, which used vacuum tubes as a constant current source to produce a very linear ramp.  They are also used in voltage controlled oscillators (VCOs), inverters and switching power supplies, dual-slope analog to digital converters, and in function generators to produce square and triangle waves.   Relaxation oscillators are widely used because they are easier to design than linear oscillators, are easier to fabricate on integrated circuit chips because they do not require inductors like LC oscillators,  and can be tuned over a wide frequency range.  However they have more phase noise and poorer frequency stability than linear oscillators.  Before the advent of microelectronics, simple relaxation oscillators often used a negative resistance device with hysteresis such as a thyratron tube, neon lamp, or unijunction transistor, however today they are more often built with dedicated integrated circuits such as the 555 timer chip."]}, {"page": "Columbia Graphophone Company", "response": ["On February 25, 1925, Columbia began recording with the licensed Western Electric recording process and was using it on a regular basis by April.

In the Blumlein generator (animation, right), the load is connected in series between two equal-length transmission lines, which are charged by a DC power supply at one end (note that the right line is charged through the impedance of the load). To trigger the pulse, a switch short-circuits the line at the power-supply end, causing a negative voltage step to travel toward the load. Since the characteristic impedance Z0 of the line is made equal to half the load impedance RL, the voltage step is half-reflected and half-transmitted, resulting in two symmetrical opposite-polarity voltage steps, which propagate away from the load, creating between them a voltage drop of V/2\u00a0\u2212\u00a0(\u2212V/2)= V across the load. The voltage steps reflect from the ends and return, ending the pulse. As in other charge-line generators, the pulse duration is equal to 2D/c, where D is the length of the individual transmission lines. A second advantage of the Blumlein geometry is that the switching device can be grounded, rather than located in the high-voltage side of the transmission line as in the typical charged line, which complicates the triggering electronics."]}, {"page": "H2S (radar)", "response": ["Then disaster occurred; on 7 June 1942, the Halifax performing H2S tests crashed, killing everyone on board and destroying the prototype H2S.

The first Ultralinear Williamson, employing a pair of 6L6 in a Williamson-like topology, delivered ; their second model, built around more powerful 807 tetrodes, delivered . Very soon the American public acquired taste to high-power amplification, and the industry launched the \"race for Watts\". By 1955 Hafler and Keroes, now working separately, were offering 60-Watt models employing pairs of 6550 tetrodes or quartets of KT66s. Thus in less than a decade, step by step, the industry abandoned the principles set by Williamson, but continued to use his name as a convenient free trademark. In the 21st century it is even used for amplifiers without global negative feedback; the only thing they have in common with the true Williamson amplifier is the four-stage topology."]}, {"page": "History of radar", "response": ["The Bell Telephone Laboratories made a producible version from the magnetron delivered to America by the Tizard Mission, and before the end of 1940, the Radiation Laboratory had been set up on the campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to develop various types of radar using the magnetron.
