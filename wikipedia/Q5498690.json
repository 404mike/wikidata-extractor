Brereton was a prolific author. By the time he died he had written over 40 books.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Russo-Japanese War", "response": ["Various aspects of the war were also common in contemporary children's fiction. Categorised as Boys' Own adventure stories, they offer few insights into the conflict, being generally based on news articles and sharing without any reflection in the contemporary culture of imperialism. Among these, Herbert Strang was responsible for two novels: Kobo told from the Japanese side, and Brown of Moukden viewed from the Russian side. Three more were written by the prolific American author, Edward Stratemeyer: Under the Mikado's Flag, At the Fall of Port Arthur, and Under Togo for Japan, or Three Young Americans on Land and Sea (1906). Two other English-language stories begin with the action at Port Arthur and follow the events thereafter: A Soldier of Japan: a tale of the Russo-Japanese War by Captain Frederick Sadleir Brereton, and The North Pacific by Willis Boyd Allen (1855\u20131938). Two more also involve young men fighting in the Japanese navy: Americans in For the Mikado by Kirk Munroe, and a temporarily disgraced English officer in Under the Ensign of the Rising Sun by Harry Collingwood, the pen-name of William Joseph Cosens Lancaster (1851\u20131922), whose speciality was naval fiction."]}, {"page": "G. A. Henty", "response": ["G. A. Henty's commercial popularity encouraged other writers to try writing juvenile adventure stories in his style; \"Herbert Strang\", Henry Everett McNeil, Percy F. Westerman and Captain Frederick Sadleir Brereton all wrote novels in \"the Henty tradition\", often incorporating then-contemporary themes such as aviation and First World War combat.Carpenter and Prichard,The Oxford Companion to children's literature, (p. 7). By the 1930s, however, interest in Henty's work was declining in Britain, and hence few children's writers there looked to his work as a model."]}, {"page": "Brereton (surname)", "response": ["*Frederick Sadleir Brereton (1852\u20131957), British author"]}, {"page": "Francis sadlier brereton", "response": ["#REDIRECT Frederick Sadleir Brereton"]}, {"page": "Francis Sadlier Brereton", "response": ["#REDIRECT Frederick Sadleir Brereton"]}, {"page": "Frederick Sadlier Brereton", "response": ["#REDIRECT Frederick Sadleir Brereton"]}, {"page": "F.
