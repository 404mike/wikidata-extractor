He was 27 years old, and an acting corporal in the 9th Battalion, The Sherwood Foresters (The Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Regiment), British Army during the Battle of Broodseinde in the First World War when he performed a deed for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.\nOn 4 October 1917 at Poelcapelle, east of Ypres, Belgium, when the platoon was held up by machine-gun fire from a concrete stronghold and the platoon commander and sergeant were casualties, Corporal Greaves, followed by another NCO, rushed forward, reached the rear of the building and bombed the occupants, killing or capturing the garrison and the machine-gun. Later, at a most critical period of the battle, during a heavy counter-attack, all the officers of the company became casualties and Corporal Geaves collected his men, threw out extra posts on the threatened flank and opened up rifle and machine-gun fire to enfilade the advance.He later achieved the rank of Sergeant. Fred died in Brimington, near Chesterfield, on 11 June 1973, aged 83, and was cremated there.His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Sherwood Foresters Museum, Nottingham Castle, England.On 2 August 2014 a commemorative plaque to Greaves was unveiled in the Chesterfield FC Memorial Garden at the Proact Stadium.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of English Victoria Cross recipients", "response": ["|Fred Greaves || British Army || 1917  || First World War || Poelcapelle"]}, {"page": "Killamarsh", "response": ["*Fred Greaves, the first Derbyshire person to be awarded a Victoria Cross was born here in 1890.Derbyshire at VictoriaCross.org  Retrieved 18 June 2007"]}, {"page": "Battle of Broodseinde", "response": ["* Acting Corporal Fred Greaves of the 11th (Northern) Division."]}, {"page": "Brimington", "response": ["Chesterfield's crematorium is in Brimington, on the road into Chesterfield.
