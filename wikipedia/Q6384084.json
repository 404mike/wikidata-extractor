In the introduction to his 1989 translation, Keith Bosley stated: \"The only way I could devise of reflecting the vitality of Kalevala metre was to invent my own, based on syllables rather than feet. While translating over 17,000 lines of Finnish folk poetry before I started on the epic, I found that a line settled usually into seven syllables of English, often less, occasionally more. I eventually arrived at seven, five and nine syllables respectively, using the impair (odd number) as a formal device and letting the stresses fall where they would.\""]}, {"page": "Lu\u00eds de Cam\u00f5es", "response": ["*Luis de Cam\u00f5es: Epic and Lyric.
