His racing career covered the years between 1958 and 1969 and he drove a variety of different classes of cars. After stopping driving himself he became an entrant in 1970 and he had cars in Formula Three, Formula Atlantic, F5000 and in 1975, Formula One. After racing he became creator, developer and operator of Tucktonia, a south-coast leisure park in the 1970s and 1980s. He was also a director of the Rob Walker Motor Group in the UK during the 1970s and the owner of Harry Stiller Motor Cars on Wilshire Boulevard, in Beverly Hills, California, also in the 1970s, with agencies for Fiat, Lancia and Lotus and for leasing Rolls Royce and Bentley motor cars in Los Angeles. During the early 1980s, he was a pioneer of the pound shop concept in the North East of England and opened units in Scarborough, Newcastle upon Tyne, Stockton and moved into the South as well with another five units along the South Coast and one in Hatfield.He was notable as the person responsible for starting Alan Jones in Formula One in 1975 with a privately owned Hesketh 308. This was not the first time Jones had driven for Stiller as he had done so in the works March Formula Atlantic car in the 1974 UK John Player championship.\nStiller was a life member of the British Racing Drivers' Club (BRDC), and lived in Christchurch, Dorset, England with his wife Annie.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alan Jones (racing driver)", "response": ["For 1971, Jones campaigned a Brabham BT 28 converted to BT35 specification, in Formula Three and had a moderately successful season which led to a series of tests for March at Silverstone. However, despite the success of the test, Jones was not offered a drive by March and for 1972, drove a GRD in Formula Three. Jones did enough that season to be kept on by GRD for the next year with a new sponsor and only lost the 1973 championship due to a misfiring engine in the last round at Brands Hatch. In 1974, Jones began the season in Formula Atlantic but felt it was a very amateurish effort, but a chance meeting with Harry Stiller led to a drive in the latter's March 74.  At the end of the season, Jones made his F5000 debut for Stiller in the final round of the European Championship at Brands Hatch in a Chevron B24/28 owned by John MacDonald.  It was planned to enter Formula 5000 for 1975. However, Stiller's initial plans fell through but after some delay, during which Jones was effectively unemployed, Stiller arranged to purchase a Formula One Hesketh 308 and signed Jones to drive the car.", "|rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left\"|Harry Stiller Racing", "|align=left|Custom Made Harry Stiller Racing", "|align=left|Custom Made Harry Stiller Racing", "!

The car was strong, taking third place at the Swedish Grand Prix, the Austrian Grand Prix and the United States Grand Prix. For 1975, examples of the 308 were sold to Harry Stiller Racing, who gave Alan Jones his grand prix debut. Polar Caravans also purchased a Hesketh chassis, while the works team modified the 308 for Hunt. At the same time, Horsley was developing into an efficient and competent team manager and under his guidance, the team moved forward."]}, {"page": "Mallory Park", "response": ["|  Harry Stiller", "|  Harry Stiller"]}]}}
