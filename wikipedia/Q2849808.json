In total 67 episodes of Dad's Army we adapted for radio.

They toured the country with the show until March 2020 when it was cut short by the COVID-19 pandemic. In 1981 Snoad and Knowles created the Dad's Army spinoff radio series It Sticks Out Half a Mile. In 1985 they again worked together to create the television adaptation of It Sticks Out Half a Mile with the pilot Walking The Plank, starring Bernard Cribbins, Richard Wilson and Angus Barnett. The BBC did not order anymore episodes despite its high audiences ratings but in 1987 Yorkshire Television ordered seven episodes under the name of High & Dry. Despite the series\u2019 success it was short-lived, many criticised it for its lack of location filming which was due to a technicality with union rules.
