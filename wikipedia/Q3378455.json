In the novel Cronin advocated a free public health service to defeat the wiles of doctors who \"raised guinea-snatching and the bamboozling of patients to an art form.\" Cronin and Aneurin Bevan had both worked at the Tredegar Cottage Hospital in Wales, which served as one of the bases for the NHS. The author quickly made enemies in the medical profession, and there was a concerted effort by one group of specialists to get The Citadel banned. Cronin's novel, which became the highest-selling book ever published by Gollancz, informed the public about corruption in the medical system, which eventually led to reform. Not only were the author's pioneering ideas instrumental in creating the NHS, but according to the historian Raphael Samuel, the popularity of Cronin's novels played a major role in the Labour Party's landslide victory in 1945."]}, {"page": "Miles Malleson", "response": ["In September 1914, he enlisted in the Army, and was sent to Malta, but was invalided home and discharged in January 1915.
