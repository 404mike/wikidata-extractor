Upon Johnson's transfer, team manager Adrian Heath said: \"I think it's fair to say that Eddie has lost his way recently and I hope we can get him back on the right path to where he is again one of the bright young players in English football.\" Johnson played in the club's first game, which was a 2\u20130 friendly defeat to Major League Soccer's New England Revolution and scored in another pre-season match. Johnson scored his first goal for Austin on 25 April against fellow expansion side the Cleveland City Stars when he scored in the 13th minute of play. Johnson scored his second goal in the final minute of the match. In the 2009 season, Johnson played 22 league matches, scoring five goals making him the Aztex leading goalscorer, but he was forced to miss part of the season because of work permit problems after he returned to England with Evans. Johnson also played in two of the Aztex's three US Open Cup matches, playing in the first round, scoring the second goal in a 2\u20130 win over Mississippi Brilla and in Austin's 2\u20130 defeat to Houston Dynamo in the third round. The Austin Chronicle named Johnson the city's best player. The newspaper's citation said: \"he's been out there hustling every game and providing leadership and a steadying influence on and off the field. At 24, with a background that includes Manchester United and English national youth teams, he might not be with us much longer, but it's a treat while it lasts.\" He went on to win one of the club's player of the season awards."]}, {"page": "Nick McKoy", "response": ["McKoy was born in Newham and began his career as a trainee with Wimbledon.

He made his first and only appearance in the Football League just four days later on 6 November, against Bristol City again in the 4\u20131 League One defeat, he came on as a substitute in the 66th minute for Alex Tapp. Makofo gained something of a cult following during his time with MK Dons thanks to the computer game Championship Manager 4, in which the youngster was one of the 'must sign' players. In the game Makofo could be bought early on for a pittance and would almost always become a world beater, despite the fact that the game had no official position for him which led some to speculate whether the young prodigy was even a real player."]}, {"page": "2000\u201301 Wimbledon F.C. season", "response": ["!scope=\"row\"|Alex Tapp"]}, {"page": "2001\u201302 Wimbledon F.C. season", "response": ["!scope=\"row\"|Alex Tapp"]}, {"page": "Woodcote High School", "response": ["*Alex Tapp  "]}, {"page": "Dean Lewington", "response": ["Born in Kingston upon Thames, London, Lewington made his Wimbledon first team debut on 5 April 2003, coming on as a last-minute substitute for Alex Tapp in a 4\u20132 First Division defeat to Sheffield Wednesday at Hillsborough, his only appearance of the season."]}, {"page": "Tapp (surname)", "response": ["*Alex Tapp (born 1982), English footballer"]}, {"page": "AFC Wimbledon\u2013Milton Keynes Dons F.C. rivalry", "response": ["! scope=\"row\"| Alex Tapp"]}]}}
