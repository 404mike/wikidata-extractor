Canadian theater legend Dora Mavor Moore approached Cowan to advise on the public relations strategy for the project and to assist in creating connections with the theater community in Great Britain. He introduced Moore and Tom Patterson to Leonard Brockington who was then the President of the Rank Organization. That led to the Rank team assisting the Stratford committee in setting a realistic budget. Rank also contributed about 25% of the initial financing of the Stratford Festival. Key to the first season was having a well known performer to headline the season. Rank's London office arranged for Alec Guinness to be released from a picture commitment to enable him to come to Stratford for the first season. As a public relations specialist, James Cowan had the concept to create Stratford not only as an event but as a destination. Cowan also believed that it was critical to have a very strong pre-season ticket sales rather than trying to build the project gradually. His strategy included launching the plays like a movie premier, something he knew well as the North American public relations director for Rank Films and the Odeon Theaters. James Cowan and his friend John Frame provided the first year's pre-season opening campaign as a donation. Cowan convinced his sister-in-law Mary Jolliffe to be Stratford's first publicist. She had just left her career as a teacher.  With Cowan's mentoring and her remarkable talents, Jolliffe served successfully in the position for seven seasons. The first season was so successful that a great number skeptical Stratford citizens who had delayed purchasing tickets were disappointed as the season was sold out. As the great Canadian playwright Merrill Denison later commented on Cowan's role in the Stratford story, \"Jimmy Cowan? He helped to organize the whole thing.\""]}, {"page": "Canadian declaration of war on Germany", "response": ["On September 9, the House of Commons and Senate approved authorization for a declaration of war.
