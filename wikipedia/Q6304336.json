Her first husband, Mark Hebden, a solicitor, was killed in a road accident in 1994 that also involved her best friend Caroline Bone (later Sterling).  Shula and Mark's son Daniel was born after the death of his father as a result of IVF treatment after a long struggle with infertility.  Some years after Mark's death, Shula had an affair with the village doctor (who was himself living with Shula's hitherto good friend Usha Gupta), thus two-timing her boyfriend Alistair (the local vet) whom she subsequently married. This was in the context of Shula's devout Christianity and membership of the local Parish Council. She owns and runs the riding stables which formerly belonged to Christine Barford, her aunt. She used once to have great fun with her best friend, Caroline, but later Caroline became engrossed in her relationship with her husband Oliver Sterling and their business activities. After her marriage to Alistair, Shula lost her lightheartedness and became rather dour, self-centred and even, at times, sanctimonious, as evidenced by her attitude to the marriage to Usha Gupta, a Hindu, of the vicar, to whom Shula had been 'right-hand woman' for the parish. Coping with the childhood arthritis of her son, Daniel, did not help, nor did her husband's gambling addiction, which nearly destroyed their marriage before he finally admitted to owing huge sums to Matt Crawford and others. The couple resolved to stay together; they remortgaged the business to pay off the debts and Alistair attended Gamblers Anonymous meetings. Daniel was expected to go to university to read Law in his father's footsteps, but upset his mother by joining the  Royal Tank Regiment, though later she accepted his choice of career. In 2018, Shula stunned Alistair when she told him their marriage was over. Now divorced, they are still good friends and probably closer than they had been in the last few years of their marriage. In 2019, Shula surprised her family when she announced her intention to take the initial steps to becoming a Church of England vicar.
