In late November 2016, she denied the appointment of Althea Efunshile, a former deputy chief of Arts Council England, as a non-executive director on the board of the state-owned broadcaster, Channel 4. She was criticised because Efunshile was a black female candidate while the other four candidates were all white men and were either appointed or re-appointed. This action led to a letter of complaint being sent to her by a cross-party group of MPs. On 12 December 2017, the government announced the appointment which her successor ratified. In January 2018, Bradley was appointed Secretary of State for Northern Ireland after the resignation of James Brokenshire due to ill health. In July 2018, she came under criticism in the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee for failing to take action on British government discrimination against former soldiers and police. Andrew Murrison challenged her on her account of what she had done, and she said she would write to him. Sylvia Hermon commented: \"I wait and wait for letters.\""]}, {"page": "2016 in British television", "response": ["|A candidate put forward by Ofcom to be a Channel 4 board member, who was then rejected for the role by the government is named as Althea Efunshile, a former deputy chair of Arts Council England."]}, {"page": "Efunshile", "response": ["#REDIRECT Althea Efunshile"]}, {"page": "Althea Joy Barrett Efunshile", "response": ["#REDIRECT Althea Efunshile"]}, {"page": "Slay In Your Lane", "response": ["It is based on interviews the authors conducted with \"39 successful black British women spanning different industries\", namely: businesswoman Ade Hassan; writer and broadcaster Afua Hirsch; Aj Odudu; Alexis Oladipo; public sector executive Althea Efunshile; director Amma Asante; computing, mathematics and language child prodigy Anne-Marie Imafidon; playwright Bola Agbaje; journalist and newsreader Charlene White; radio DJ and television presenter Clara Amfo; Clare Anyiam-Osigwe; actress, singer and songwriter Cynthia Erivo; Labour Party MP Dawn Butler; sports presenter and former track and field athlete Denise Lewis; singer, songwriter, rapper, record producer, and actress Estelle; Florence Adepoju; businesswoman, lawyer and public speaker Funke Abimbola; television and radio presenter Gemma Cairney; Irene Agbontaen; singer, songwriter and TV presenter Jamelia; TV broadcaster June Sarpong; advertising industry professional and chair of MediaCom UK Karen Blackett; singer and songwriter Keisha Buchanan; rapper, singer, and producer Lady Leshurr; Lakwena, recording artist, songwriter and composer Laura Mvula; space scientist Maggie Aderin-Pocock; author and former Children's Laureate Malorie Blackman; publisher, editor, writer and broadcaster Margaret Busby; entrepreneur and author Melanie Eusebe; author and Reader in Equality & Education at Goldsmiths College, University of London, Nicola Rollock; Patricia Bright, TV and radio presenter, actress, voice-over artist, and DJ Sarah-Jane Crawford; entrepreneur Sharmadean Reid; Sharmaine Lovegrove; actress and writer Susan Wokoma; publishing director of British Vogue Vanessa Kingori; Vanessa Amadi; and singer-songwriter, model and record producer V V Brown.
