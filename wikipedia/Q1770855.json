The use of the word \"fuck\" in the first edition of the magazine alienated older and more conservative readers, but the paper quickly won a following among more liberal-minded Scots. It also won a raft of awards for its journalism, design and photography, in the UK and internationally, and secured the former archbishop Richard Holloway and On the Waterfront scriptwriter Budd Schulberg as regular contributors. Its web version gained a large readership in the United States because of its consistent anti-George W.

His talk referred to both music and verbal language. He also referred to the problem of infinite regress as applied to the question of \"Who made God\"? providing an answer by stating that this question overlooks the transcendence of God. The third edition was entitled \"Does God makes mistakes\" and was presented by Sister Frances Domenica. The fourth edition was presented on 25 March by George Pattison, and was about \"The Absence of God\", dealing with the theme of how we cannot see God. Early in this edition, Pattison referred to the Anglican liturgy, in which it is said that God knows our hearts, and watches our inner movement. He later referred to the French atheist existentialist, Jean-Paul Sartre, describing Sartre's early loss of faith, and stating that Sartre remained, for the rest of his life, a resolute atheist. However, he later referred to the postmodernist philosopher Emmanuel Levinas, who said that although we cannot see God, God can see us, and discussed how this is important to Levinas' philosophy.", "* 11 March: Richard Holloway"]}, {"page": "Royal Philharmonic Society Music Awards", "response": ["Thirteen awards are given annually with categories for performers, composers, programmers, audience engagement, communication and learning and participation.
