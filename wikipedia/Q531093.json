This was the club's highest final league placing to date. The following season the club sacked John Beck and were relegated from the new First Division. Further relegation followed two seasons later.

Sir Alex Ferguson remained intent on signing a new striker for United that summer, although it was far from clear whether it was Hughes or his strike-partner Brian McClair who would lose his place in the first team or be switched to another position in order to accommodate a new signing. Ferguson's hunt for a new striker ended with the acquisition of Dion Dublin, although Dublin was injured after playing just a few matches for the club, and it was not long before United were in the hunt for another new striker, as a lack of goals were seeing them slip behind in the title race. Eric Cantona was eventually signed at the end of November, which prompted interest from Newcastle United manager Kevin Keegan, who had first asked Ferguson about Hughes' availability that summer. Ferguson, however, insisted that Hughes was not for sale, and he remained a regular choice in the first team, playing alongside Cantona while McClair was mostly selected in central midfield from then on."]}, {"page": "Robbie Savage", "response": ["Savage is also famous for an incident at Villa Park, while playing for Birmingham City, in a bad-tempered Second City derby in March 2003.

Huckerby and Dublin's partnership did not go unnoticed and earned Huckerby a call up to the England B squad, whilst Dublin managed call ups to the full squad, under Glenn Hoddle. Huckerby played a major role in Coventry's Premier League survival,  culminating with a final day 2\u20131 win at Tottenham Hotspur in 1997. His success with the Sky Blues continued throughout the following season as Coventry enjoyed a ten-game unbeaten run and reached the quarter finals of the FA Cup, narrowly losing on penalties to Sheffield United. Huckerby scored several goals, most notably the winner in a 3\u20132 victory over Manchester United at Highfield Road, a dazzling run past a few defenders before slotting past Kevin Pilkington.

Joining the club when they were firmly rooted to the bottom of the Third Division, he reorganised and revitalised the playing side of the club with assistant Chris McMenemy. Thanks especially to a number of notable number of home wins in the first three months of 1989 and a surprising 3\u20131 win at second place Sheffield United in early January, the team climbed out of the bottom four. However, this proved to be only a temporary abatement of the club's problems at that time. Despite bringing great performances from striker Dave Waller, who equalled the club's record for goals in consecutive games \u2013 eight \u2013 Chesterfield were relegated in the penultimate game. The following season saw Chesterfield reach the play-off final at Wembley after spending almost the entire season in the top seven, underlying Hart's ability and promise as a young manager. The team was defeated 0\u20131 by Cambridge United for whom Dion Dublin scored the winning goal. In February 1990, he gave 19-year-old Sean Dyche his Football League debut.

On 15 September 2001, in a game against Watford, he saved a last minute Marcus Gayle penalty to preserve West Brom's 2\u20131 lead. He was a regular for Albion in the Premiership and was watched by England manager Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson, but never made it into the national squad. A highlight of Hoult's 2002\u201303 season was saving a Dion Dublin penalty to help his side secure a 0\u20130 draw away at Aston Villa. Following Albion's relegation, Hoult remained a fixture in the side for the following season, as the club were promoted to the Premiership at the first attempt. In 2004, he was named as one of West Bromwich Albion's 16 greatest players, in a poll organised as part of the club's 125th anniversary celebrations. He played for the majority of the 2004\u201305 season, as West Bromwich Albion escaped relegation. However, after being a regular in goal for West Brom for several seasons, Hoult lost his place at the start of the 2005\u201306 season due to a groin injury. Second choice to Chris Kirkland, who manager Bryan Robson had signed on a 12-month loan from Liverpool, Hoult was loaned to Nottingham Forest in September 2005. However, he was recalled during his second month with the club after Kirkland sustained a rib injury."]}, {"page": "Phil Neal", "response": ["Neal returned to club management on 23 October 1993 with Coventry City, beginning his spell at Highfield Road on that day with a 5\u20131 defeat against QPR that left them 12th in the Premier League. Despite a shaky start to his time as Sky Blues manager, they did well in the second half of the season and finished 11th in the league \u2013 their highest finish since coming seventh in 1989. Perhaps the most impressive result that season after Neal's arrival was a 4\u20130 home win over Manchester City on 19 February 1994. However, Coventry struggled in 1994\u201395 despite the \u00a32million arrival of striker Dion Dublin from Manchester United on 10 September, and Neal was sacked on 14 February 1995 despite a 2\u20130 away win over fellow strugglers Crystal Palace three days earlier, which saw them 17th in the Premier League and two places above the relegation zone. Neal's successor Ron Atkinson ensured City's survival."]}]}}
