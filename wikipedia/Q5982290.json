Their success was not easy to achieve, given most of them were the slow U-class types. Supported by S- and T-class vessels, they dropped mines. British submarine commanders became aces while operating from Malta. Commanders Ian McGeoch (commanding ), Hugh \"Rufus\" Mackenzie and David Wanklyn had particular success. Lieutenant Commander Lennox Napier sank the German tanker Wilhelmsburg (7,020\u00a0tons). It was one of the few German tankers exporting oil from Romania. The loss of the ship led Hitler to complain directly to Karl D\u00f6nitz, while comparing the Kriegsmarine unfavourably with the Royal Navy. D\u00f6nitz argued that he did not have the resources to protect the convoy, though the escort of the ship exceeded that which the Allies could have afforded to give a large convoy in the Atlantic at that point in the war. It was fortunate for D\u00f6nitz that Hitler did not probe the defence of the ship further."]}, {"page": "HMS Splendid (P228)", "response": ["HMS Splendid was a third-group S-class submarine and was ordered as part of the 1941 Naval Programme on 14 October 1940.

Three days later the submarine's periscope was spotted by the , which also detected the submarine on sonar. Hermes was the largest German ship in the Mediterranean Sea except for auxiliary minesweepers. The destroyer made three attack runs with depth charges, dropping 41 in total; Splendid attempted to escape by diving to , but the last eleven depth charges started leaks inside the submarine's pressure hull, and the boat was forced to surface. She was fired upon by the destroyer's surface guns, which killed 18 crew members and wounded the commanding officer. Splendid was scuttled to prevent her capture by enemy forces, and her surviving crew were imprisoned in Italian prisoner-of-war camps.Heden, p. 240 Splendids commander, Ian McGeoch, despite having lost the use of one eye during the submarine's sinking, made two escape attempts, the second of which was successful; he arrived in Switzerland to have a metal splinter removed from his eye, then travelled through France and Spain to England.", "* IWM Interview with Ian McGeoch, who commanded HMS Splendid from 1942 to 1943"]}, {"page": "Deaths in August 2007", "response": ["*Sir Ian McGeoch, 93, British admiral."]}, {"page": "Arthur Hezlet", "response": ["In late March 1942 Hezlet was given command of HMS Trident, the boat in which he had been First Lieutenant at the beginning of the war, with Ian McGeoch as his first lieutenant. After brief exercises in the Clyde, Trident embarked on her first patrol under Hezlet's command to Norwegian waters, off Trondheim. Hezlet later recalled that his instructions were not to fire at anything but Tirpitz, which had arrived at Trondheim on 13 March 1942, and that he consequently had a frustrating time watching hundreds of thousands of tonnes of unescorted shipping plying the coastal waters. That appears potentially open to doubt because patrol reports appear to indicate that Hezlet made two attacks against merchant ships during that patrol, one unsuccessful but the latter, on 20 April 1942, resulting in his sinking of the German merchant ship H\u00f6dur, which he hit with two out of three torpedoes fired.
