Crawford's good form saw him earn a move to the senior game, joining Clyde in December 2000. He made 42 appearances in total for the Bully Wee, scoring 18 goals. He joined Stenhousemuir in May 2002.  This was followed by a spell at Stranraer, before he returned to the juniors, signing for Shotts Bon Accord in 2005. He scored 32 goals in 26 games but unfortunately in September of that year he had cruciate injury and was out for the best part of a year. He returned after this time out only to sustain the same injury which effectively ended his career at the age of 27.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Larkhall Thistle F.C.", "response": ["| Brian Crawford"]}, {"page": "Brian Crawford", "response": ["Brian Crawford may refer to:", "* Brian Crawford (footballer) (born 1978), Scottish football striker", "* Brian Crawford (politician) (1926\u20132004), Australian politician"]}]}}
