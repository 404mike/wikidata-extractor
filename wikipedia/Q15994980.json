Christine Overall, professor of philosophy at Queen's University at Kingston, has written that personal racial transformation, or as she puts it \"transracialism\", belongs to a larger class of personal surgical interventions. This larger class includes transsexual identity change, body art, cosmetic surgery, Munchhausen syndrome, and labiaplasty. Her basic thesis is that the arguments against the ethical nature of racial transformation (e.g. \"it's not possible\", \"betrayal of group identity\", \"reinforces oppression\", etc.) stand or fall with the ethical arguments related to transsexual change. Cressida Heyes, professor of Philosophy of Gender and Sexuality at the University of Alberta, disagrees with Overall's schema.  Heyes feels that racial transformation is fundamentally different from gender transformation since race is also determined by ancestry, personal cultural history and societal definitions.  Hence ethical considerations of transracial surgery are different from ethical considerations in transsexual surgery."]}]}}
