In recognition of his contribution to scholarship, he was awarded the Order of Merit in 2014.West wrote on ancient Greek music, Greek tragedy, Greek lyric poetry, the relations between Greece and the ancient Near East, and the connection between shamanism and early ancient Greek religion, including the Orphic tradition. This work stems from material in Akkadian, Phoenician, Hebrew, Hittite, and Ugaritic, as well as Greek and Latin. West also studied the reconstitution of Indo-European mythology and poetry and its influence on Ancient Greece, notably in the 2007 book Indo-European Poetry and Myth (IEPM).\nIn 2001, he produced an edition of Homer's Iliad for the Bibliotheca Teubneriana, accompanied by a study of its critical tradition and overall philology entitled Studies in the Text and Transmission of the Iliad. A further volume on The Making of the Iliad appeared ten years later, and one on The Making of the Odyssey was published in 2014.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Europe", "response": ["There have been attempts to connect  to a Semitic term for west, this being either Akkadian  meaning 'to go down, set' (said of the sun) or Phoenician  'evening, west',\"Europe\" in the Online Etymology Dictionary. which is at the origin of Arabic  and Hebrew . Martin Litchfield West stated that \"phonologically, the match between Europa's name and any form of the Semitic word is very poor\",. while Beekes considers a connection to Semitic languages improbable."]}, {"page": "Hades", "response": ["The origin of Hades' name is uncertain, but has generally been seen as meaning \"the unseen one\" since antiquity. An extensive section of Plato's dialogue Cratylus is devoted to the etymology of the god's name, in which Socrates is arguing for a folk etymology not from \"unseen\" but from \"his knowledge (eidenai) of all noble things\". Modern linguists have proposed the Proto-Greek form *Awides (\"unseen\").According to Dixon-Kennedy, p. 143 (following Ker\u00e9nyi 1951, p. 230) says \"...his name means 'the unseen', a direct contrast to his brother Zeus, who was originally seen to represent the brightness of day\". Ivanov, p. 284, citing Beekes 1998, pp. 17\u201319, notes that derivation of Hades from a proposed *som wid- is semantically untenable; see also Beekes 2009, p. 34. The earliest attested form is A\u1e2fd\u0113s (), which lacks the proposed digamma. Martin Litchfield West argues instead for an original meaning of \"the one who presides over meeting up\" from the universality of death.West, M. L., Indo-European Poetry and Myth, OUP, 2007, p. 394."]}, {"page": "Homer", "response": ["Martin Litchfield West has argued that the Iliad echoes the poetry of Hesiod, and that it must have been composed around 660\u2013650 BC at the earliest, with the Odyssey up to a generation later. He also interprets passages in the Iliad as showing knowledge of historical events that occurred in the ancient Near East during the middle of the seventh century BC, including the destruction of Babylon by Sennacherib in 689 BC and the Sack of Thebes by Ashurbanipal in 663/4 BC. At the other extreme, a few American scholars such as Gregory Nagy see \"Homer\" as a continually evolving tradition, which grew much more stable as the tradition progressed, but which did not fully cease to continue changing and evolving until as late as the middle of the second century BC."]}, {"page": "Hengist and Horsa", "response": ["On farmhouses in Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein, horse-head gables were referred to as \"Hengst und Hors\" (Low German for \"stallion and mare\") as late as around 1875.

Like satyrs, these other Indo-European nature spirits are often human-animal hybrids, frequently bearing specifically equine or asinine features. Human-animal hybrids known as Ki\u1e43puru\u1e63as or Ki\u1e43naras are mentioned in the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a, an Indian epic poem written in Sanskrit. According to Augustine of Hippo (354 \u2013 430 AD) and others, the ancient Celts believed in dusii, which were hairy demons believed to occasionally take human form and seduce mortal women. Later figures in Celtic folklore, including the Irish boc\u00e1nach, the Scottish \u00f9ruisg and glaistig, and the Manx goayr heddagh, are part human and part goat. The lexicographer Hesychius of Alexandria (fifth or sixth century AD) records that the Illyrians believed in satyr-like creatures called Deuadai. The Slavic le\u0161iy also bears similarities to satyrs, since he is described as being covered in hair and having \"goat's horns, ears, feet, and long clawlike fingernails.\""]}, {"page": "1937", "response": ["*September 23 \u2013 Martin Litchfield West, British classical scholar (d. 2015)"]}, {"page": "Europa (consort of Zeus)", "response": ["An alternative suggestion due to Ernest Klein and Giovanni Semerano (1966) attempted to connect a Semitic term for \"west\", Akkadian erebu meaning \"to go down, set\" (in reference to the sun), Phoenician  'ereb \"evening; west\", which would parallel occident (the resemblance to Erebus, from PIE *h1reg\u02b7os, \"darkness\", is accidental, however).
