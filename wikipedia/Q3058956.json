In 1948, she began teaching at the Tavistock Clinic and in collaboration with Dr John Bowlby she started the practice of observation as an integral part of psychotherapy training. This involved finding families about to welcome a newborn and gaining their consent to freely participate in the two-year project. It consisted in visiting a family to observe their infant from birth to two years. These weekly observations in the natural environment of the baby's home offered a vivid learning experience of child development. Observers came to appreciate the mutual influence of the developing relationship between mother and baby, father and siblings (if any). Importantly, the observer was also invited to consider the feelings aroused in themselves during the observation and how their presence in the home could be influencing events.Rustin, Margaret.
