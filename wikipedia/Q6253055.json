He also studied at the Luton School of Art (1942\u201345), Byam Shaw School of Art in London (1948\u201350), and the Central School of Art and Design in London (1952\u201355), with Victor Pasmore and William Turnbull.

In the mid-1960s, Plumb produced paintings with large fields of a single colour, including narrow strips on the edge of different colours, intended to enhance the emotional impact of the central, major, and usually intense hue optically.\nWhile studying in London, Plumb married Joan Lawrence, a long-time close friend. He died aged 81.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of British painters", "response": ["*John Plumb (1927\u20132008)"]}, {"page": "Timeline of art", "response": ["* 2008 in art \u2013 Death of William Brice, Kahlil Gibran, Enrico Donati, Paul Wonner, Robert Rauschenberg, Will Elder, Cornell Capa, John Plumb, Bruce Conner, Manny Farber, John Russell, Alain Jacquet, Grace Hartigan, Jan Krugier, Guy Peellaert, Willoughby Sharp, Robert Graham"]}, {"page": "Color field", "response": ["* John Plumb (1927\u20132008)"]}, {"page": "Art of the United Kingdom", "response": ["In the 1960s, Sir Anthony Caro became a leading figure of British sculptureAnthony Caro Exhibition 2005, Tate Britain Retrieved 9 December 2010 along with a younger generation of abstract artists including Isaac Witkin,May 2006, Sunday Times obituary Retrieved 9 December 2010 Phillip King and William G.
