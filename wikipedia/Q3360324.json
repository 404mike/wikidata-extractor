He is best remembered for fighting and seconding the most number of fights for any boxer of his era.  His bout with Jem Belcher was considered by a few historians to be for a Championship of England, though the boxers differed significantly in weight.  There was no formal sanctioning body to confer global or even national championship status on the fight during the period, and no real formal recognition of weight classes at the time.", "link_mentions": {}}}
