He is best remembered for fighting and seconding the most number of fights for any boxer of his era.  His bout with Jem Belcher was considered by a few historians to be for a Championship of England, though the boxers differed significantly in weight.  There was no formal sanctioning body to confer global or even national championship status on the fight during the period, and no real formal recognition of weight classes at the time.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Caleb Baldwin (boxer)", "response": ["During the years following the win against Smith, Baldwin, now known as \"The Pride of Westminster,\" established himself as the leading lightweight fighter in England and was regarded by many, unofficially, as the champion of the division. On 14 May 1792 he fought to a draw against Paddington Tom Jones at Smitham Bottom. Baldwin then easily defeated James Kelly, an Irish shoemaker, at Wimbledon in 12 rounds, taking 15 minutes on 22 December 1800.  A relatively modest purse of 20 guineas per side was collected.

According to Puglistica, Bitton was the larger and stronger combatant.  Jones was said to have the best of it in the early rounds, but Bitton came from behind and won the match, though Jones led the betting by 3-1, as a result of strong backing by wealthy patrons. Jones was unable to continue the match and resume the contest after being knocked nearly senseless after 20 minutes of fighting.  The purse was a substantial 40 guineas.  According to one account, a riot occurred after Bitton defeated Jones, between the large Jewish audience and the wealthy and largely Christian backers of Jones and his second Jem Belcher.\"Today in Pugilistic Annals\", The Gazette, Cedar Rapids, Iowa, pg. 7, 13 July 1914 ", "| Paddington Tom Jones"]}]}}
