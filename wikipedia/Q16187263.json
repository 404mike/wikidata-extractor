Philpott, who had made several media appearances because of his benefits-funded lifestyle and polyamorous relationships, was sentenced to life imprisonment for the manslaughter of his children. The British media had previously reported on his large family (seventeen children by multiple women), and his reliance on state benefits.\nFollowing an eight-week trial, he and his wife Mairead, together with their friend Paul Mosley, were found guilty of the manslaughter of the six children in April 2013. Philpott was given a life sentence with a minimum term of fifteen years' imprisonment. Psychologist Glenn Wilson described Philpott as clinically a \"psychopath\" and \"exhibitionist\" with \"antisocial personality disorder.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Kim Hill", "response": ["* Kim Hill, victim in 1978 of attempted murder by Mick Philpott"]}, {"page": "Nottingham Crown Court", "response": ["*April 2013 \u2013 Conviction of Mick Philpott and others for the manslaughter of six of his children in a house fire in Derby"]}, {"page": "Philpott", "response": ["* Mick Philpott (born 1956), English criminal convicted for multiple manslaughter"]}, {"page": "2012 Derby arson attack", "response": ["The 2012 Derby arson attack occurred on 11 May 2012 at 18 Victory Road, a semi-detached house in a residential street in Osmaston (erroneously reported by the press as being in  Allenton), Derby, Derbyshire, England.
