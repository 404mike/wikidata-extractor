Blair scored the only goal of the 1921 Scottish Cup Final when Partick defeated Rangers to claim the trophy for the only time in their history.Having gradually lost his regular place to David Ness who joined the club in 1923, two years later Blair left Thistle and made the unusual step of returning to his hometown team Saltcoats Victoria in the junior leagues, normally populated by promising teenagers (indeed Blair had also started his career at the same club), those who never reached professional status or veterans approaching retirement, rather than a player in his mid-20s with a proven reputation at a high level. His reasons for the move are not well documented, but it is known that his play was still of a high enough standard to be selected for Scotland at Junior international level on four occasions.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Blair", "response": ["John Blair may refer to:", "* John Blair Sr. (died 1771), American merchant and politician in the colony of Virginia", "* John Blair Jr. (1732\u20131800), American politician, Founding Father and jurist", "* John Blair (Tennessee politician) (1790\u20131863), American politician", "* John Blair (Northern Ireland politician) (born 1966), MLA for South Antrim", "* John Blair (1890s footballer), Scottish footballer active 1894\u20131899", "* John Blair (footballer, born 1898) (1898\u20131971), Scottish footballer (Partick Thistle)", "* John Blair (English footballer), top scorer in the 1923\u201324 Oldham Athletic A.F.C. season", "* John Blair (footballer, born 1905) (1905\u20131974), Scottish footballer (Third Lanark, Tottenham Hotspur, Sheffield United)", "* John Blair (footballer, born 1910) (1910\u2013c. 1975), Scottish footballer (Motherwell and Scotland)", "* John Blair (Australian footballer) (born 1955), Australian rules footballer", "* John Blair (rugby player) (c. 1871\u20131911), New Zealand rugby union player", "* John Blair (historian) (born 1955), British historian, archaeologist, and academic", "* John Blair (pastor) (1720\u20131771), Presbyterian minister", "* John Blair (priest) (died 1782), British clergyman and chronologist", "* John Blair (writer) (born 1961), American poet, novelist, and short-story writer", "* John Blair (musician), American violinist on the 1973 album Song of the New World", "*John Blair (painter) (1849-1934), Scottish painter"]}, {"page": "1920\u201321 Scottish Cup", "response": ["|OR ||||John Blair"]}, {"page": "David Ness", "response": ["After gradually ousting the 1921 Scottish Cup Final goalscorer John Blair from the position, he went on to play for the club in the 1930 Scottish Cup Final which they lost to Rangers after a replay,The Cup Final  Rangers Win Replay at Hampden, The Glasgow Herald, 17 April 1930 but did manage to claim winner's medals in the Glasgow Merchants Charity Cup in 1927Rout of the Rangers in the Charity Cup Final, The Sunday Post, 15 May 1927, via Partick Thistle History Archive and the one-off Glasgow Dental Hospital Cup in 1928, both against the same opponents.Football  Partick Thistle, 2; Rangers, 0  Glasgow Dental Hospital Cup\u2013Final Tie, The Glasgow Herald, 11 December 1928, via Partick Thistle History Archive Towards the end of his spell, a replacement was signed in the shape of Alex McSpadyen, who went on to become a Scotland international within a few years."]}]}}
