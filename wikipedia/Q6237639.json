Way (who was instrumental in her promotion),Way would shortly become personally involved in a similar controversy when his daughter was promoted over more senior nurses. Stirling, Giles and Sir John Colton, met to consider the Premier's request for a review of the appointment. This they endorsed on the grounds that Miss Gordon's selection was on her leadership potential, not her nursing ability (an analogy with officers and \"men\" was made). Further, they regarded the letter as insulting and impertinent, and recommended suspension of the signatories. This reference includes the text of the letter and names of the signatories.
