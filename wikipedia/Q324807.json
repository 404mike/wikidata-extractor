Of the latter, ICES 72, a massive festival of the avant-garde based in London's Roundhouse was probably the most notable. Quite apart from appearing at the festival with Exit and hosting several events at Dial House, Vaucher, Rimbaud and the other residents of the house had been heavily involved in the organisation of the festival, producing and printing flyers and posters in Dial House's print room, and assisting in programming alongside founder Harvey Matusow.
