During her chess career she was always known as Anne Sunnucks.\nShe was educated at Wycombe Abbey School, Buckinghamshire. Although she learned how to play chess at the age of 8, she did not play seriously until the age of 21, when she joined the same chess club as Imre K\u00f6nig, who became her tutor.  By finishing tied for second place in the 1953 British Women's Championship she became one of three British representatives in the 1954 Western European Zonal.\nSunnucks earned the Woman International Master title by placing second in the 1954 Western European Zonal.  Although this result qualified her to play in the next event in the Women's World Championship sequence, she was a major in the Women's Royal Army Corps and the authorities would not allow her to travel to the USSR where the 1955 Women's Candidates tournament was being held.  Sunnucks represented England several times in Olympiads and team matches, including Great Britain vs. USSR 1954, the Anglo-Dutch match in 1965, and top board for the British Chess Federation (BCF) team at the 1966 Women's Chess Olympiad at Oberhausen. She participated in the Women's World Championship cycle two more times, representing the BCF in the Western European Zonal tournaments of 1963 and 1966.  Sunnucks won both the Army and the Combined Services Championships in 1968, and was the only woman to compete in either. Sunnucks compiled The Encyclopaedia of Chess (1970, second edition: 1976).\nHer married name was Anne Mothersill.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of chess players", "response": ["* Anne Sunnucks (England, 1927\u20132014)"]}, {"page": "Henry Ernest Atkins", "response": ["Atkins learned chess from one of his brothers, and joined the Wyggeston School Chess Club at age 10.Philip W.
