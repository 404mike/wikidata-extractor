He gained his PhD from the University of Lancaster in 1986, where he was associated with Prof Harold Perkin's Centre for Social History, organising the 1996 conference of the Social History Society on 'Time and the Construction of the Past'. He has also held positions at the universities of Keele, Edge Hill and Cumbria.

The London and national papers shared the horror felt in the Manchester region, but Peterloo's immediate effect was to cause the government to pass the Six Acts, which were aimed at suppressing any meetings for the purpose of radical reform. It also led indirectly to the foundation of the Manchester Guardian newspaper. In a survey conducted by The Guardian in 2006, Peterloo came second to the Putney Debates as the event from radical British history that most deserved a proper monument or a memorial."]}, {"page": "Suffrage", "response": ["In 1819 60\u201380,000 men and women from 30 miles around Manchester assembled in the city's St. Peter's Square to protest their lack of any representation in the Houses of Parliament.

That is, maintaining the original payment dates but reducing the amounts due proportionately to reflect the omission of eleven days from the quarter ending on 29\u00a0September 1752 (Michaelmas Day). Macclesfield said this idea was abandoned because it would prove more complex than it first appeared. Despite this, the Treasury later considered legislating to override the Calendar (New Style) Act 1750 provisions by applying proportionate reductions to government payments of interest, salaries and wages, but the idea was abandoned. Nevertheless, the Treasury realised that outside government a proportionate reduction of wages, rents etc. for the short quarter might be convenient in some cases. Dr Robert Poole writes that the Treasury, \"decided that a tidy move to new-style quarter day payments might gradually be achieved at the point where old leases expired and new ones began. Tables of abatements\u00a0... for the eleven missing days were included in the official information about the changeover and widely published in the press, almanacs and pocket books\".

And while praising it for avoiding the \"second-hand errors, third-order simplifications, and outright myths\" of many other millennial works on the calendar, reviewer Robert Poole points out as a weakness that it only considers a single version of each calendar, whereas historically these systems went through multiple revisions, and quotes the book as noting that its results are sometimes \"mathematically sensible, but culturally wrong\". Adding that the reduction of a human-produced calendar to a computer calculation is \"sheer hubris\", he nevertheless concludes that \"We can be grateful that so useful a work of reference has been created from a project of such awe-inspiring futility\". And reviewer Manfred Kudlek calls this \"the most extensive and detailed publication on calendar systems\" since the early 20th-century Handbuch der mathematischen und technischen Chronologie of Friedrich Karl Ginzel."]}]}}
