He served in the Third Anglo-Ashanti War in 1873 and then in the expedition of Sir Charles Warren to Bechuanaland in the mid 1880s. He took a prominent role as General Officer Commanding the 1st Division in the Second Boer War. He suffered a serious defeat at the Battle of Magersfontein, during which he failed to carry out adequate reconnaissance and accordingly his artillery bombarded the wrong place leading to the Highland Brigade taking heavy casualties. He was later captured by the Boers at Tweebosch. After the war he became General Officer Commanding-in-Chief in South Africa in 1908, Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Natal in 1910 and then Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Malta in 1915.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1932", "response": ["* October 30 \u2013 Paul Methuen, 3rd Baron Methuen, British field marshal (b. 1845)"]}, {"page": "1845", "response": ["* September 1 \u2013 Paul Methuen, 3rd Baron Methuen, British field marshal (d. 1932)"]}, {"page": "Baron Methuen", "response": ["thumb|200px|Paul Methuen, 3rd Baron Methuen"]}, {"page": "Hartham Park", "response": ["Sir John became MP for Chippenham in 1892, and a Member of London County Council from 1898 to 1904.
