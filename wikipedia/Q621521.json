The album reached number one in the UK, producing five top ten singles and becoming Suede's biggest-selling album worldwide. Despite problems within the band, Suede's fourth album, Head Music (1999), was a British chart-topper. The album was promoted heavily with the band receiving considerable press coverage on its release, however the response from fans and critics was less enthusiastic than for previous records. Codling left the band in 2001, citing chronic fatigue syndrome and was replaced by Alex Lee. The band's fifth album, A New Morning (2002), the first following the collapse of Nude Records, was a commercial disappointment, and the band disbanded the following year.

It was well received by critics and returned the band to the top ten in the UK.

Following the release of their 1999 album Head Music and subsequent tour, keyboardist Neil Codling announced his departure from the group on 23 March 2001, citing problems with Chronic fatigue syndrome. Singer Brett Anderson was furious at Codling's decision, but understood the reasons behind his departure: \"He couldn't help it, I know, but I did feel aggrieved. I felt let down.

The band were unimpressed with the trial run, especially Simon Gilbert and Richard Oakes, who both had strong opinions on the results. Nevertheless, the band decided to record the album with Hoffer and descended on Parkgate Studios, Hastings, in May with their new member Alex Lee, following Codling's departure. Although the group recorded ten songs with Hoffer that Anderson said were the \"best we've written,\" most of the material recorded with him producing was scrapped.

Anderson felt that his spiralling drug use and Codling's illness made Oakes become more isolated from the group; and that the only people who were still getting on well were Osman and drummer Simon Gilbert.

They released two EPs and three albums before disbanding in 1998.", "Strangelove formed in Bristol, in 1991, after David Francolini (drums, of Levitation) spotted singer Patrick Duff, who at the time was a street busker. According to Duff, Francolini's words were \"Get in the car, you're going to be a pop star.\" Francolini then got together various musicians he knew throughout the area; Alex Lee (guitar, formerly of The Blue Aeroplanes), Julian Pransky Poole (guitar, formerly part of The Jazz Butcher's band), and Joe Allen (bass guitar). With Francolini on drums, the quintet played their first gig at Bath Moles Club on 9 October 1991. Francolini took on the role of drummer for only two gigs, before being replaced by John Langley. The first song Duff wrote for Strangelove was titled \"Zoo'd Out\" in 1991, released the following year on the Volume 4 compilation, and in 1993 as part of Rough Trade's Single Club. Duff's tales of despair and sorrow struck a chord and his impressive, emotionally charged vocals were described by Tom Doyle in Q Magazine's World of Noise compilation as \"evoking thoughts of Morrissey as vocally-tutored by Scott Walker\"", "The album yielded another UK Top 40 single, \"The Greatest Show on Earth\", and sell-out shows at the London Astoria and Shepherd's Bush Empire.  However, seemingly on the point of a major breakthrough, Strangelove split up on 20 April 1998. In later interviews, Duff acknowledged how \"unfocused\" he was on music while in Strangelove, that he could sense the band had run its course, and he needed to get away from the fast-paced life of touring to truly recover and discover his calling as an artist. When asked about the possibility of a Strangelove reunion, Duff explains that while everyone in the band are still friends and is not completely opposed to the idea, the chances of it are very slim. As a solo artist, Duff has played stripped down, acoustic versions of Strangelove songs, sporadically. In December 2003, Duff and guitarist Alex Lee played a small retrospective gig at the Gin Palace, and in 2010 appeared on BCfm for John Peel Day, playing two acoustic versions of songs from their 1992 and 1993 Peel sessions. In 2019, Duff and Lee were interviewed by French magazine Soul Kitchen on the 25th anniversary of Strangelove's debut album.", "In late 1998, Duff formed the short-lived band Moon, who performed a handful of gigs in England, and released a 7\" single. After the swift dissolution of this band, Patrick then spent two introspective years living in a forest outside Bristol, a move which he explains he did out of fear, and the shame of \"not being 'somebody' anymore\". He was discovered in this forest by Thomas Brooman, the head of WOMAD Festival, where he was asked to perform. At this festival, Duff watched and met 81-year-old veteran South African master storyteller and musician, Madosini, whom he would go to Langa, Cape Town to live and write songs with. In 2003, they went on to perform a number of successful concerts together around the world. Duff has released several solo albums, working on occasion with ex-bandmates Alex Lee and Dave Francolini.", "Alex Lee joined Suede between 2001 and 2003; toured as an extra keyboardist and guitarist with Placebo on the Meds World Tour in 2006 and 2007; played guitar on Goldfrapp's 2008 album Seventh Tree and their 2013 album Tales Of Us and he toured both albums in the Goldfrapp live band as guitarist. He also continues to produce television and film soundtracks with Nick Powell, who has produced two albums with his own band OSKAR on Incarnation Records.

After Strangelove, Duff briefly formed another band Moon, who split up after nine months having released only one single, \"Anaesthesia\".  Between 2000 and 2004 Duff went on to travel the world as a solo artist with WOMAD Festival, collaborating with a number of artists, most notably the then 81-year-old veteran African master storyteller and musician Madosini, with whom he lived and worked in the township of Langa, in Cape Town, South Africa. Upon returning to the UK, Duff released his first solo album Luxury Problems (2005), produced by Adrian Utley of Portishead and Alex Lee (Goldfrapp/ Placebo / Suede / Strangelove).
