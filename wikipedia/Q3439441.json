Sabin also analyzes \"Too Real\", Jay Kinney's short comic from the first issue, as being jointly inspired by a combination of Situationist and punk rock imagery. Sabin noted that many of the comics didn't have any relationship to Punk culture, but thought that the comic may have introduced radical ideas to a generation of new, young punks."]}, {"page": "Andy Dog Johnson", "response": ["* Eye (magazine) # 61 ('Shock Tactics' by Roger Sabin)."]}, {"page": "Southern Cross (wordless novel)", "response": ["Comics critic Sean Rogers praised the work, particularly the pacing and action sequences, but felt it had less impact than such earlier works as Masereel's Passionate Journey (1919) or  Ward's Vertigo (1937).

Comics scholar Roger Sabin found the book unconvincing, \"a well-meaning but facile piece of agit-prop\".  Reviewer Erik Hinton praised the artwork while calling the story \"the progeny of historical lip-service and the hot-button anxiety of the destructivity of modern warfare\", and considered Ward and others of Hyde's predecessors more proficient at the medium."]}, {"page": "Sabin (surname)", "response": ["*Roger Sabin, English writer"]}]}}
