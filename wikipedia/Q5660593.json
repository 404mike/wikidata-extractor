However, in his 1997 bid for re-election in the new Blackpool North and Fleetwood constituency, he lost to Labour's Joan Humble by 8,946 votes.\nOn 22 December 1996 The Observer newspaper claimed Elletson moonlighted as an MI6 agent: the headline read \"Pro-Serb Tory MP was MI6 Agent\". The newspaper said he was recruited before he entered the House of Commons, working for the intelligence agency in Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union and during the conflict in the former Yugoslavia:\n\n\"After visiting Yugoslavia in 1992, Mr Elletson notified his MI6 handlers that donations were reaching the Conservative Party from Serbia. MI6 received special sanction from the Prime Minister (John Major) for Mr Elletson to continue his secret role after his election in 1992. He carried out his unpaid intelligence work in Eastern Europe while representing the electors of Blackpool: he also ran an extensive network of private business interests in the region, while using his public position to mount a controversial defence of the Serb regime.\"He joined the Liberal Democrats in 2002. On 30 September 2014, as chairman of The Campaign for the North, he launched an all-party pressure group to re-create the ancient Kingdom of Northumbria as a federal state in a new United Kingdom. The Campaign seeks 'devo-max' power from Westminster to bring the traditional counties of Northumberland, Durham, Yorkshire, Lancashire, Westmorland and Cumberland into a democratic state with powers equal to Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland or London, retaining membership of the European Union.\nThe proposed Northumbria would cover the territory that was ruled a thousand years ago by the Norseman Erik Bloodaxe, the last 'king of the North', killed in battle at Stainmore in the Pennines in 954.\nIn 2015, he co-founded the Northern Party to campaign for better representation for Northern England. At the 2015 general election, he contested the constituency of Lancaster and Fleetwood, coming last with 0.4% of the vote. At the 2019 general election, he endorsed the incumbent Labour MP, Cat Smith.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tory Reform Group", "response": ["* Liberal Democrats: Emma Nicholson,Tory left starts fightback Susan Bell,\"Recent Liberal recruits include ex-Conservative MP Anna McCurley, ex-Tory Reform Group leader Arthur Bell and his wife Susan Bell\" from North East Scotland by-election  in Scottish Politics \u2013 The almanac of Scottish elections and politics  Arthur Bell, Hugh Dykes, Lord John Lee, Bill Newton Dunn, Peter Price MEP, Keith Raffan,Where are they now: Keith Raffan , Total Politics Anna McCurley, Harold Elletson, Sir Cyril Townsend, Peter Thurnham, Sir Anthony Meyer, Paul Howell MEP"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1992 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Harold Elletson"]}, {"page": "Harold Daniel Hope Elletson", "response": ["#REDIRECT Harold Elletson"]}, {"page": "Blackpool North (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["||1992||  Harold Elletson || Conservative"]}, {"page": "List of Conservative Party MPs (UK)", "response": ["*Harold Elletson; MP for Blackpool North (1992\u20131997)"]}, {"page": "Robert Halfon", "response": ["After graduating, Halfon worked for a time selling memberships for an upmarket London hotel, before he got a job as a part-time researcher for Harold Elletson, then-Conservative MP for Blackpool North.
