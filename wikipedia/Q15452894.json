In the words of Eddie Chambers: \"In her work as an artist, academic, art historian, writer and curator, Archer-Straw consistently challenged the prevailing orthodoxies that treat Caribbean artists and cultural practice in geographical, racial and artistic isolation. In essence, her position was that we cannot fully understand or appreciate the practice of Caribbean artists without due consideration of broader factors such as migration, history, identity and, above all diaspora \u2013 the scattering of many black people beyond their ancestral homeland of Africa.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mike Ladd", "response": ["Mike Ladd's debut studio album, Easy Listening 4 Armageddon, was released in 1997.

In the words of the art historian Petrine Archer-Straw, \"Kayiga\u2019s work is concerned with origins, 'primitive'in the sense of exploring the essence of human consciousness and its links with spirituality. To access this deeper understanding of the self, Kofi strips himself of his formal training and approaches his subject matter intuitively and even mystically, recovering images from deepest memory and the subconscious. His is a pantheistic world that reveals the mystery of the universe in every aspect of daily life. Inanimate objects and situations become animate and alive with animal forms, insects and cosmic creatures that remind us that the spirit world is all around us. Unlike the many artists creating during this era who were inspired by the repatriation message of Garvey and Rastafari, Kayiga's world is not one of idealism mediated through the diaspora experience. Instead, he is the only artist who channeled a first-hand experience of Africa into his work, resulting in an immediacy and directness that consists of bold strokes, vibrant colour fields and symbolic language.\""]}, {"page": "Telluride House", "response": ["Notable residents include theoretical computer scientist Scott Aaronson, British Jamaican artist and art historian Petrine Archer-Straw, classicist Martin Bernal, physicist Carl M.
