In 1619 he was further honoured when he was made Baron Dunmore and Earl of Desmond in the Peerage of Ireland, with remainder to heirs male.  On his death in 1628 the Irish titles became extinct while he was succeeded in the Scottish lordship by his daughter Elizabeth, the second Lady Dingwall.  She was the wife of James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde.  Their eldest son Thomas Butler, Earl of Ossory, was summoned by writ to the English Parliament as Baron Butler, of Moore Park, in 1666.  However, he predeceased his parents who were both succeeded by their grandson, the second Duke and third Lord Dingwall. He had already succeeded his father as second Baron Butler.  However, the Duke was attainted in 1715 and his titles forfeited. In 1871, Francis Cowper, 7th Earl Cowper, managed to obtain a reversal of the attainder of the lordship of Dingwall and barony of Butler and became the fourth Lord Dingwall and third Baron Butler.  He was the great-great-great-grandson of Henrietta d'Auverquerque, Countess of Grantham (wife of Henry de Nassau d'Auverquerque, 1st Earl of Grantham), second daughter of Thomas Butler, Earl of Ossory and 1st Baron Butler, whose second daughter Lady Henrietta de Nassau d'Auverquerque married William Clavering-Cowper, 2nd Earl Cowper.
