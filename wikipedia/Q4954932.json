Wright featured in the first-team preparations for the 2012\u201313 season, with Colchester manager John Ward saying that \"it doesn't really surprise me\" that both Wright and teammate Alex Gilbey has made strides towards first-team football. Ward then handed Wright his professional debut in the League Cup tie against Yeovil Town on 14 August, the opening game of the season. Wright started the match, and played for 58 minutes before being replaced by Karl Duguid in the 3\u20130 defeat at Huish Park. He was drafted into the squad at the last minute following Freddie Sears' withdrawal, but earned praise from his manager despite being forced into playing first-team football prematurely. His father, Jermaine, said he was \"proud to see my son out there playing\" and that \"he plays with a smile on his face and he loves playing with the first team\".
