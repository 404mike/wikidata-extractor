He was educated in Dublin at the King's Hospital School, then attended Queen's University, Belfast where he earned his B.Sc. in 1928 and a M.Sc. in 1929. He later went to Harvard University and was awarded a Ph.D. in 1934.\nHe then went to South Africa for a post-graduate astronomy studies, and on 20 May 1935 was married to Sylvia Mussells in Cape Town. He returned to Ireland in 1937 to become director of the Armagh Observatory. He remained the director of the observatory until his death of a sudden heart attack.He is more noted for his political influence in favour of astronomy than for important astronomical discoveries. For example, he was responsible for persuading the Irish government and Harvard University to found a telescope at Boyden Station in South Africa for the purpose of charting the southern skies. Dr. Lindsay was also instrumental in the founding of Armagh Planetarium.\nDr. Lindsay and his wife Sylvia had one son, Derek Michael Lindsay, who was born in 1944. Derek became a professor of Chemistry in New York City, and died six months before his Mother Sylvia in 1999.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Portadown", "response": ["*Eric Mervyn Lindsay OBE (1907\u20131974) was an astronomer who was instrumental in setting up Armagh Planetarium.

In the same year Patrick Moore was appointed as Director of the Planetarium to oversee its construction. The planetarium cost \u00a3120,000 to build (included in this was \u00a312,000 for the planetarium\u2019s first projector) and was officially opened on 1 May 1968, although it had been open to the public for some months before that. Since then it has undergone many alterations: the main building was extended in 1974 to incorporate the Lindsay Hall of Astronomy, and a dome was created to house a 16\" (400\u00a0mm) reflecting telescope for public use, currently the largest public telescope in Ireland. In addition, in 1994 a new exhibition hall, the Eartharium, was added due to increased interest in Earth Science. The Armagh Astropark, which opened in 1994, is a scale model of the solar system and the Universe contained in the grounds of the Armagh Observatory, with scale-sized stainless steel models of the Sun and planets."]}, {"page": "List of people with craters of the Moon named after them", "response": ["* Eric Mervyn Lindsay"]}, {"page": "Muriel Mussells Seyfert", "response": ["Sylvia Mussells Lindsay, wife of Eric Mervyn Lindsay, was Muriel's sister."]}]}}
