Smith was purchased for \u00a310,000 from Sheffield United and was sold for four times that figure to Lincoln City just over a year later. The club finished mid-table, twelve points above the drop. The winter signing of veteran Bob Hazell helped to shore up the Vale's defence. At the end of the season, Bill Bell was made the club's chairman. Also Darren Beckford was signed from Manchester City for \u00a315,000. He would become the club's top scorer for the next four seasons."]}, {"page": "History of Port Vale F.C.", "response": ["Rudge steadied the ship, slashing the wage bill by \u00a320,000. A young Robbie Earle began to show his promise, though it was veteran Alistair Brown who was the season's top scorer, with 21 strikes. A mid-table finish was acceptable considering the rebuilding effort Rudge made with the squad. In May 1985, young Welshman Andy Jones was purchased from Rhyl for \u00a33,000. He was soon joined by \u00a312,000 defender John Williams and numerous others. Vale were promoted back to the third tier in 1985\u201386, finishing in fourth place, losing just once at Vale Park. During the season, they went on an eighteen-match unbeaten run, building their record largely on a solid defence. Jones and Earle scored eighteen and seventeen goals respectively. The only downside was the finances, as a loss of \u00a379,474 was recorded, partly due to promotion bonus payouts. In the summer of 1986, new signings included Ipswich Town's reserve goalkeeper Mark Grew on a free, Aston Villa midfielder Ray Walker for \u00a312,000, Sheffield United winger Paul Smith for \u00a310,000 and Walsall striker Richard O'Kelly for \u00a36,000. Rudge also turned down the management position at Preston North End. He also made an attempt to bring a young Steve Bull to Vale Park. After an unconvincing start to 1986\u201387, Rudge sold John Williams to Bournemouth for \u00a330,000 and brought in Bob Hazell from Reading on a free. This helped transform the club's defence, while Andy Jones' fantastic record of 37 goals helped win the Vale a twelfth-place finish. The only worrying sign was a \u00a353,373 loss, increasing the club's debt to \u00a3363,878.", "A major change occurred before the start of the 1987\u201388 season, as chairman Jim Lloyd stood down and was replaced by hard nosed businessman Bill Bell. Ten year man Russell Bromage went to Bristol City in exchange for \u00a325,000 and Lawrie Pearson, also Jon Bowden went to Wrexham for \u00a312,500. Coming in was striker Darren Beckford for \u00a315,000. Going into the season, Paul Smith went to Lincoln City for \u00a340,000, before Andy Jones was sold for a then-club-record fee of \u00a3350,000 to Charlton Athletic. \u00a335,000 of this went towards new full-back Simon Mills. The campaign was boosted by a 'famous' 2\u20131 victory over top-flight Tottenham Hotspur in the fourth round of the FA Cup. The cup run and sale of Jones had helped to pull in a record \u00a3410,239 profit. A boost for 1988\u201389 came with the sale of an unused training ground at Cobridge for \u00a3164,800. Halfway through the season, veteran Phil Sproson was advised to retire following a serious knee injury; to replace him, defender Dean Glover was signed from Middlesbrough for a club-record \u00a3200,000. The club finished third, failing to gain automatic promotion because of their worse goal difference. However they found success in the play-offs, defeating Bristol Rovers in the play-offs 2\u20131 on aggregate."]}, {"page": "Paul Michael Smith", "response": ["#REDIRECT Paul Smith (footballer, born 1964)"]}, {"page": "1986\u201387 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["The pre-season saw John Rudge bring 28-year-old stopper Mark Grew to the club from Ipswich Town.

More injuries came as Chris Banks had his nose broken after a reserve match at Barnsley when he was attacked by a gang of youths whilst waiting at a fish and chip shop. Alan Webb then suffered second degree burns at Preston North End's plastic pitch at Deepdale. The next month Rudge tried to replace Jones when he signed David Riley from Nottingham Forest for \u00a320,000. Despite a good start Riley soon entered a goal drought, as Vale went twelve league games without a win (including eight defeats). Robbie Earle missed much of this period with a hernia injury. In November Kevin Steggles was signed from West Bromwich Albion for 'a small fee' to replace the still-injured Webb.
