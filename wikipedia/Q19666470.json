He began work as a labourer in Kingston where he worked alongside future members of The Gladiators.Carl Gayle, If The BBC Played My Records I'd Be A Superstar, Black Music magazine (1974) His opportunity to cut some records came when the former Jiving Junior and producer, Derrick Harriott wrote and produced  \"Run Mr Nigel Run\" for Thomas. A huge Jamaican hit, the song led to him being known as Mr Nigel for a time. He was also successful with \"Come Home\" a song from the same session", "This was followed by a successful association with producer Joel Gibson better known as Joe Gibbs for whom Thomas recorded the plaintive \"Running Alone\" and \"Lonesome Road\" issued as by Cecil Thomas, as well as a version of \"Let It Be\" credited to Nicky Thomas.Michael de Koningh & Laurence Cane-Honeysett, Young, Gifted And Black, The Story of Trojan Records, Sanctuary Publishing, 2003 UK,  Thomas' collaboration with Gibbs resulted in a number of hits including \"Don't Touch Me\", \"Mama's Song\" and \"God Bless The Children\". Thomas and Gibbs also covered a number of well regarded R&B hits that included Tyrone Davis' \"Turn Back the Hands of Time\" and \"(Baby) Can I Change Your Mind\" and Tony Joe White's \"Rainy Night in Georgia\". He topped the Jamaican charts in 1970 with \"Have a Little Faith\", a record that reputedly sold 50,000 copies on its release in the UK.  It failed to chart in the UK because the sales were largely through specialist music shops and not statistically counted by the official chart compilers.", "In mid-1970, Nicky Thomas' interpretation of the Winstons' version of \"Love of the Common People\" resulted in a UK hit. The record reached number nine in the UK Singles Chart, leading in turn to a European tour and a relocation to the United Kingdom. The original Jamaican mix (without additional strings) issued on early copies as by Cecil Thomas sold 50,000 copies in Jamaica and 175,000 in the UK.Moskowitz, David V.
