At 17 years old, the young MC then went on to clash the entire Square Crew on Flex FM, a pirate / online radio station based in South London. In 2014, Ghostly was extremely active on the pirate radio scene amongst others and was part of a new breed of MCs bringing back that raw grime energy on the airwaves that were somewhat abandoned as well as gaining further exposure on major radio stations by appearing on Rinse FM, BBC 1xtra and more very frequently. 2015 was the year the explosive tracks \"Slap Yourself\" and \"DALYDK\" both premiered by DJ Cable's \"Sixty Minutes\" mix, which was broadcast on MistaJam's BBC 1Xtra taken from his debut Recon EP released via Complex Magazine on 10 August. Since the beginning of 2015, Ghostly has been extremely active on the pirate radio circuit as well as performing his underground music all over the UK in raves and festivals.
