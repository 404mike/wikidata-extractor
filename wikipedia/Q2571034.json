She was also sometimes considered the mother of Lulal, who is described in other texts as the son of Ninsun. Wilfred G. Lambert described the relation between Inanna and Lulal as \"close but unspecified\" in the context of Inanna's Descent.There is also similarly scarce evidence for the love goddess Nanaya being regarded as her daughter (a song, a votive formula and an oath), but it's possible all of these instances merely refer to an epithet indicating closeness between the deities and weren't a statement about actual parentage."]}, {"page": "Dagon", "response": ["While Wilfred G. Lambert proposed in 1980 that Ishara was sometimes regarded as the wife of Dagan, and this theory is repeated as fact in older reference works such as Jeremy Black's and Anthony Green's Gods, Demons and Symbols of Ancient Mesopotamia, it finds no support in more recent studies. The association, limited to sharing temples, was rooted only in shared western origin and thus \"foreign\" status in the eyes of Mesopotamian theologians, as indicated by the fact it is not attested outside Babylonia, with no sources from Syria, where both deities were more prominent, indicating a strong connection. Llu\u00eds Feliu points out that to make the purported connection to Dagan seem more plausible, Lambert wrongly assumed Ishara is one and the same as Haburitum, goddess of the river Habur. As noted by Alfonso Archi, Haburitum and Ishara at times appear in the same documents, and cannot be the same deity. He considers it more likely that Haburitum was analogous to Belet Nagar. Like Feliu, he considers it impossible that Dagan and Ishara were ever regarded as a couple, noting that the latter's character was similar to Ishtar's.", "There is some evidence that in Mesopotamia Dagan was connected with the poorly known tradition about conflict between the gods and Enmesharra, for example a passage stating that \"with Dagan's authority [gods] have been guarding Enme\u0161arra from time immemorial\" is known; Dagan might represent Enlil here according to Wilfred G. Lambert."]}, {"page": "Nabonidus", "response": ["In her inscriptions, Addagoppe also claimed that Nabonidus was of the dynastic line of Ashurbanipal (669\u2013631 BC), king of the Neo-Assyrian Empire. According to her inscriptions, Addagoppe was born in Ashurbanipal's twentieth year as king. At the time of her birth, Harran had been a major Assyrian stronghold and when the Neo-Assyrian Empire fell in 609 BC, Harran was the capital of its government in exile. On account of her claims in regards to Nabonidus being of Sargonid (Ashurbanipal's dynasty) ancestry, Stephanie Dalley considered it in 2003 \"almost certain\" that Addagoppe was a daughter of Ashurbanipal. Michael B. Dick opposed Dalley's conviction in 2004, pointing out that even though Nabonidus did go to some length to revive some old Assyrian symbols (such as wearing a wrapped cloak in his depictions, absent in those of other Neo-Babylonian kings but present in Assyrian art) and attempted to link himself to the Sargonid dynasty, there is \"no evidence whatsoever that Nabonidus was related to the Sargonid dynasty\". According to Beaulieu, that Adagoppe did not explicitly claim any royal ancestors herself points to a humble origin. As inscriptions by female relatives of kings are relatively rare, it is however probable, according to Wilfred G. Lambert, that Addagoppe was of some high status."]}, {"page": "List of lexicographers", "response": ["*Wilfred G.

He is the first and most distant ancestor, theologically conceived as the God of Heaven in its \"transcendental obscurity\". In some theological systems all of the deities were believed to be the offspring of An and his consort Ki. However Anu was himself described as the descendant of various primordial beings in various texts (god lists, incantations, etc.), and Enlil was often equipped with his own elaborate family tree separate from Anu's. While An was described as the utmost god, at least by the time of the earliest written records the main god in terms of actual cult was Enlil. Anu's supremacy was therefore \"always somewhat nominal\" according to Wilfred G. Lambert. Luludanitu, a multicolored stone (red, white and black) was associated with him.", "| Nanna, Enzu or Zuen (\"Lord of Wisdom\") in Sumerian, later altered as Suen and Sin in Akkadian, is the ancient Mesopotamian god of the Moon. He was the son of Enlil and Ninlil and one of his most prominent myths was an account of how he was conceived and how he made his way from the Underworld to Nippur. A theological system where Nanna, rather than Enlil, was the king of gods, is known from a text from the Old Babylonian period; in the preserved fragment Enlil, Anu, Enki and Ninhursag served as his advisers, alongside his children Utu and Inanna. Other references to Nanna holding such a positions are known from personal names and various texts, with some going as far as stating he holds \"Anuship and Enlilship,\" and Wilfred G. Lambert assumes that he was regarded as the supreme god by his clergy in Ur and Harran. ", "| In some East Semitic myths, Anshar and Kishar are a primordial couple, who are male and female respectively. In the Babylonian En\u00fbma Eli\u0161, they are the second pair of offspring born from Abzu and Tiamat and the parents of the supreme An. A partial rewrite of En\u00fbma Eli\u0161 from the neo-Assyrian period attempted to merge the roles of Marduk and Anshar, which prominent assyriologist Wilfred G. Lambert described as \"completely superficial in that it leaves the plot in chaos by attributing Marduk's part to his great-grandfather, without making any attempt to iron out the resulting confusion.\"", "|One of the 11 \"standing gods of Ebabbar,\" divine judges assisting Shamash, as well as a member of various Assyrian groups of judge deities.

Ishme-karab's gender is unclear, but Wilfred G. Lambert considered it more likely that this deity was male.  ", "| An Elamite deity known chiefly from a passage mentioning \"the forest of Manziniri.\" She appears in a letter of Esarhaddon addressed to Urtaku, an Elamite ruler, as one of the deities meant to guarantee peace between the two monarchs, alongside Assyrian gods Ashur, Bel, Nabu, Sin, Shamash, Ishtar of Nineveh and Ishtar of Arbela.

Pinches, that Ninlil or Belit Ilani had seven different names (such as Nintud, Ninhursag, Ninmah, etc.) for seven different localities. He also discussed the location of Kesh appearing to be near Kish to the east of Babylon calling the temple of Kesh \"Ekisigga\". Raymond de Hoop noted similarities between Sumerian temple hymns and chapter forty nine of Genesis in the Bible (). He suggests remarkably close syntactical and metaphorical parallels in the sayings about Joseph and Judah such as \"the highly esteemed prince (), \"a leopard, who seizes prey\" (), \"a great wild ox / a wild bull\" () and \" seed of a (the) steer, engendered by a wild ox (). Jeremy Black noted that Kesh was no longer a major settlement by the time of the later Babylonian versions but presumed that the temple of Nintud still functioned. Wilfred G. Lambert noted that many kings had built temples and chapels to Ninhursag, but that the Kesh sanctuary \"was the centre of the goddess's cult from the Early Dynastic period into the Old Babylonian Dynasty; after this time it lost its importance\"."]}, {"page": "Deaths in November 2011", "response": ["*Wilfred G.
