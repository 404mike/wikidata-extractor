He is regarded as the best centre forward in Burnley's history and holds their records for the highest number of goals in a season and the highest number of league goals ever.\nHe started playing football during World War I playing for Blackpool \u2013 as he was stationed in Blackpool \u2013 in the Wartime Leagues, where he impressed enough to earn himself a trial with Manchester United in 1919. However, he did not do enough to get a contract and went to his hometown team Lincoln City in October 1919. He went on to play in the lower reaches of the Football League for Merthyr Town and Chesterfield. After scoring 23 goals in 35 games for the Spirites, many Division One teams were interested in Beel. Burnley were the quickest to make a move and signed him in the summer of 1923. He spent nine years at Turf Moor, where he scored 188 goals in 337 games in all competitions for the Clarets, being their top goal-scorer in six of those seasons and runner-up in another two.\nHis days at Burnley were numbered when they were relegated to Division Two after Beel had a mediocre year in front of goal. He ended up returning to Lincoln City in 1932 staying for just a year before finishing his career with a season at Rochdale. He then went on to become player-manager at non-league Tunbridge Wells Rangers and later manager of Maidstone United. He decided to stay in Maidstone for the rest of his life and was helping out with junior football throughout the 1970s until his death in December 1980.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Burnley F.C.", "response": ["The record for the most first team appearances in all competitions for Burnley is held by goalkeeper and one-club man Jerry Dawson, who played 569 games between 1907 and 1929.

Irvine scored a goal in a 2\u20131 win against Lausanne Sports on a pre-season tour of Switzerland, and his first competitive goal of the season came on 24 August 1965 in the 3\u20131 home victory against Blackpool. He scored two in the return match at Bloomfield Road the following week, and two matches later he netted a hat-trick in the 4\u20131 defeat of Northampton Town. Between the 1\u20131 draw away at Leeds United on 30 October 1965 and the 5\u20132 win against Fulham on 11 December 1965, Irvine scored in seven consecutive league matches.Simpson (2007), p. 318 In the 3\u20131 win against West Ham United, Irvine and Lochhead both scored in the same match for the first time, despite having played together for almost three seasons.Simpson (2007), p. 317 Irvine took his goalscoring form into the cup competitions, netting five times in three FA Cup ties, and scoring the winning goals against Southampton and Stoke City as the team reached the fifth round of the Football League Cup before being knocked out by Peterborough United. During the second half of the season, he went through a somewhat barren spell, failing to score in the league between 8 January 1966 and 26 March 1966. He ended his poor run of form with a hat-trick in the 4\u20131 win over Nottingham Forest at Turf Moor. He subsequently got on the scoresheet in the next six league games, including two goals against Sheffield Wednesday which took him to 27 league goals, the joint-highest total since George Beel's 30 in the 1928\u201329 season. Irvine's 29th and final goal of the season came on 23 April 1966 in the 2\u20130 home victory against Liverpool. He was the highest scorer in the Football League First Division that season, the first, and to date only, time a Burnley player had achieved the feat."]}]}}
