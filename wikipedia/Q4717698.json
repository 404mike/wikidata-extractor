Stevenage drew their following game 2\u20132 at Stockport County. The away side took the lead ten minutes after half-time through Mark Roberts. However, two quick-fire Stockport goals within the space of three second-half minutes gave Stockport the lead. Lawrie Wilson popped up in injury-time to secure Stevenage a point.

Rodman scored again just after the break, cutting in from the left channel and scoring from just outside the area.
