Criticism has also been directed at the characterisation and writing. Sangster and Condon consider the plots uncomplicated and the characters perhaps \"even more simplistic\" than those of Stingray. Some have blamed the return to 25-minute episodes, coming after Thunderbirds 50-minute format, for a lack of subplots and perceived drop in the quality of the storytelling. In a 1986 interview, script editor Tony Barwick described Captain Scarlet as \"hard-nosed stuff\" that lacked humour, adding: \"It was all for the American market and to that extent there was no deep characterisation. [The characters] all balanced one against the other.\" Sylvia Anderson likened the presentation to that of a \"comic strip\", arguing that the action format came at the expense of the character development.Sellers, pp.\u00a0104\u2013105. In contrast, Jeff Evans believes the characters to be \"more detailed\" than before, arguing that Captain Scarlet was the first Anderson production to give them \"private lives and real identities\".
