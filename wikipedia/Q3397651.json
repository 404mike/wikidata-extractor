Howell Harris, a Welsh schoolteacher, had a conversion experience on May 25 during a communion service. He described receiving assurance of God's grace after a period of fasting, self-examination, and despair over his sins. Sometime later, Daniel Rowland, the Anglican curate of Llangeitho, Wales, experienced conversion as well. Both men began preaching the evangelical message to large audiences, becoming leaders of the Welsh Methodist revival. At about the same time that Harris experienced conversion in Wales, George Whitefield was converted at Oxford University after his own prolonged spiritual crisis. Whitefield later remarked, \"About this time God was pleased to enlighten my soul, and bring me into the knowledge of His free grace, and the necessity of being justified in His sight by faith only\"."]}, {"page": "Methodism", "response": ["The Wesley brothers immediately began to preach salvation by faith to individuals and groups, in houses, in religious societies, and in the few churches which had not closed their doors to evangelical preachers. John Wesley came under the influence of the Dutch theologian Jacobus Arminius (1560\u20131609). Arminius had rejected the Calvinist teaching that God had pre-ordained an elect number of people to eternal bliss while others perished eternally. Conversely, George Whitefield (1714\u20131770), Howell Harris (1714\u20131773), and Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon (1707\u20131791) were notable for being Calvinistic Methodists."]}, {"page": "John Wesley", "response": ["Whitefield, Howell Harris (leader of the Welsh Methodist revival), John Cennick, and others, became the founders of Calvinistic Methodism. Whitefield and Wesley, however, were soon back on friendly terms, and their friendship remained unbroken although they travelled different paths.

The foundations of modern Wales pp. 347\u201350 In the early 19th century the Welsh Methodists broke away from the Anglican church and established their own denomination, now the Presbyterian Church of Wales. This also led to the strengthening of other nonconformist denominations, and by the middle of the 19th century Wales was largely Nonconformist in religion. This had considerable implications for the Welsh language as it was the main language of the nonconformist churches in Wales. The Sunday schools which became an important feature of Welsh life made a large part of the population literate in Welsh, which was important for the survival of the language as it was not taught in the schools."]}, {"page": "List of Welsh people", "response": ["*Howell Harris (1714\u20131773), Methodist minister"]}, {"page": "List of museums in Wales", "response": ["| Howell Harris Museum || Aberhonddu || Powys|| Mid Wales|| Religious || Life of 18th-century Methodist leader Howell Harris, known as Trefeca"]}, {"page": "William Williams Pantycelyn", "response": ["William Williams, PantycelynGlyn Tegai Hughes, Meic Stephens and R.
