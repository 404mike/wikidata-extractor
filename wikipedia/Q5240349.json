He was also a hard-hitting tail-end batsman good enough to score two centuries in first-class cricket.\nHe played his part in taking Surrey to four Lord's finals between 1979 and 1982. He was awarded the Man of the Match Award for his 3-26 versus Warwickshire in the 1982 NatWest Trophy final which helped Surrey to win the match, and was awarded his county cap during the same season. He claimed 57 first-class wickets in 1983 and 60 in 1984. In 1983 he also came close to 1,000 first-class runs, with 937 at an average of 36.03, scoring two centuries. The closest he came to Test selection was that season, being twelfth man for the Trent Bridge Test against New Zealand.\nHe spent two close seasons representing the South African teams Natal and Northern Transvaal in the Currie Cup. He remained popular with his team-mates but a short-lived move to Gloucestershire in 1988 was cut short when he was forced to retire through multiple sclerosis aged 29. He became an active fundraiser for the charity for the rest of his life. He died from complications arising from the disease in July 2012 aged 53. He left a widow Louise and four children.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "David Thomas", "response": ["* David Thomas (composer) (1881\u20131928), Welsh composer", "* David Thomas (musician) (born 1953), American musician, member of group Pere Ubu", "* David Thomas (Dewi Hefin) (1828\u20131909), Welsh poet and schoolteacher", "* David Thomas (bass) (born 1943), British early-music and baroque-music singer", "* David Thomas (born 1959), English author, better known under his pen name Tom Cain", "* David Thomas, pen name of Dave Thompson (author) (born 1960), English writer about music", "* David Thomas (born 1966), musician with Take 6", "* David Thomas (British businessman) (born 1963), British businessman, CEO of Barratt Developments", "* David Thomas (industrialist) (1794\u20131882), Welsh industrialist", "* David Thomas (New York politician) (1762\u20131831), American politician, Congressman from New York", "* David Thomas (Texas politician) (1795\u20131836), American politician, signer of Texas Declaration of Independence", "* David Thomas (British politician) (1892\u20131954), Welsh Labour politician", "* David Thomas (MEP) (born 1955), British Labour politician", "* David Thomas (Archdeacon of Montgomery) (1833\u20131916), Welsh priest and historian", "* David Thomas (Archdeacon of Cardigan) (died 1951), Welsh priest", "* David Thomas (missionary priest) (1829\u20131905), Welsh priest", "* David Thomas (Protestant minister, born 1813) (1813\u20131894), Welsh preacher and publisher", "* David Thomas (bishop) (1942\u20132017), Welsh bishop, Provincial Assistant Bishop for the Church in Wales", "* David Thomas (Archdeacon of Gower), Welsh Anglican priest", "* David Thomas (Canadian scientist), Canadian biochemist", "* David Thomas (geographer) (born 1958), British geographer", "* David Thomas (rugby league), rugby league footballer of the 1900s for Wales, Halifax, and Mid-Rhondda", "* David Thomas (cricketer, born 1911) (1911\u20132001), Welsh cricketer", "* David Thomas (cricketer, born 1959) (1959\u20132012), English cricketer", "* David Thomas (cricketer, born 1963), former English cricketer", "* David Thomas (American football) (born 1983), American football player", "* David Thomas (Canadian football) (born 1951), American football cornerback", "* David Thomas (beach volleyball) (born 1974), Trinidad and Tobago beach volleyball player", "* David Thomas (boxer) (born 1937), British Olympic boxer", "* David Thomas (field hockey) (born 1927), British Olympic hockey player", "* David Thomas (educationalist) (1880\u20131967), Welsh educationalist and politician", "* David Thomas (murderer) (died 1995), executed Vincentian criminal", "* David Thomas (jeweller) (born 1942), Crown Jeweller for the English monarchy", "* David Thomas (judge), Justice of the Supreme Court of Queensland", "* J.
