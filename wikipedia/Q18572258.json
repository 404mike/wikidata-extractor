She married a privateer who owned an estate in Oxford, but was left widowed at the age of 22 with a son, Hugh Cloberry Christian. She then started writing poetry. She married a French customs officer, again with a maritime history, and the couple moved to London. There she published a number of works, including her most significant poem  An Invocation to the Genius of Britain, a patriotic piece written at the start of the Anglo-French War. She also published a number of translations of Welsh poems.\nPenny was an adherent of Welsh nationalism, and wrote a number of nationalistic poems. Though her work was criticised for its poor grammar, it attracted prominent subscribers, such as Samuel Johnson and Horace Walpole.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of English-language poets", "response": ["*Anne Penny (1729\u20131784, W/E)"]}, {"page": "1784 in poetry", "response": ["* March 17 \u2013 Anne Penny (born 1729), Welsh-born poet"]}, {"page": "1729 in poetry", "response": ["* January 6 \u2013 Anne Penny, n\u00e9e Hughes (died 1784), Welsh-born poet"]}, {"page": "Hugh Cloberry Christian", "response": ["Christian, descended from residents of the Isle of Man, was born at Hook Norton, Oxfordshire in 1747.
