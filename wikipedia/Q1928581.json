In \"Families of curves on a surface of general type\", Bogomolov laid the foundations to the now popular approach to the theory of diophantine equations through geometry of hyperbolic manifolds and dynamical systems. In this paper Bogomolov proved that on any surface of general type with c_1^2>c_2, there is only a finite number of curves of bounded genus. Some 25 years later, Michael McQuillan extended this argument to prove the famous Green\u2013Griffiths conjecture for such surfaces. In \"Classification of surfaces of class VII_0 with b_{2}=0\",Bogomolov, F. A. Classification of surfaces of class VII_0 with b_{2}=0 (Russian) Izv. Akad. Nauk SSSR Ser. Mat. 40 (1976), no. 2, 273\u2013288, 469.   Bogomolov made the first step in a famously difficult (and still unresolved) problem of classification of surfaces of Kodaira class VII. These are compact complex surfaces with b_2=1. If they are in addition minimal, they are called class VII_0. Kunihiko Kodaira classified all compact complex surfaces except class VII, which are still not understood, except the case b_{2}=0 (Bogomolov) and b_{2}=1 (Andrei Teleman, 2005).Andrei Teleman, Donaldson Theory on non-K\u00e4hlerian surfaces  and class VII surfaces with b_2=1, Inventiones Mathematicae 162, 493\u2013521, 2005.
