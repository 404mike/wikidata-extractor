Page 89 with the story of wife-beater and child abuser Trevor Jordache (Bryan Murray). His wife, Mandy (Sandra Maitland) and daughters Beth (Anna Friel) and Rachel (Tiffany Chapman) moved into number 10 under a shroud of mystery. The house had been vacated by the remaining Corkhills and sold to a Mrs Shackleton; unbeknown to the residents of the close, she was acting as a representative for a charity supporting abused families, and had purchased the property as a safe house. After the Jordache family moved in some disturbing facts began to emerge. It transpired that not only had Mandy suffered years of mental and physical abuse, but also that Beth had been sexually abused by her father. Before long Trevor, who had recently been released from prison for GBH against Mandy, found them and persuaded Mandy to let him back into the family home, pretending to have been changed by prison, but once in he quickly resumed his old ways and frequently beat Mandy. Things quickly escalated as Trevor began getting violent towards Beth and began sexually abusing Rachel. As the abuse and torture got worse, Beth encouraged her mother Mandy to kill Trevor. After several attempts by the pair to poison him failed, Mandy stabbed him in the kitchen of number 10 and, with the help of Beth and Sinbad, buried him underneath their patio, where his body remained until January 1995, when neighbour Eddie Banks (Paul Broughton) dug him up whilst investigating a leaking water pipe. Following the discovery, Sinbad, who had genuine feelings towards Mandy and had been totally supportive and sympathetic of her plight, took the family on the run to the Republic of Ireland. This was depicted in a couple of episodes before they were arrested in Dublin as wanted suspects for murder. On return to Britain, Mandy and Beth were immediately charged with Trevor's murder, launching the Free the Jordache Two campaign and ratings soared with Brookside achieving its highest ever viewing figures of 9 million.20 Years of Brookside by Graham Kibble-White.

Page 96-97 Mandy, meanwhile, developed a close relationship with popular Sinbad, eventually falling pregnant to him. However, in 1995, many viewers were disappointed with the conclusion of the storyline, when Beth suddenly died off-screen from a genetic heart condition whilst still in prison. In reality, Anna Friel refused to renew her contract and abruptly quit the role. Phil Redmond explained to disappointed viewers he felt the only way for Beth to leave Brookside was to die; he felt it would not have been right to leave the incredibly popular character languishing in prison.20 Years of Brookside by Graham Kibble-White.
