Michael Taylor, for example, argues, \"A fiendish provenance replaces a divine one in [Act 5, Scene 3], a scene that reduces Joan to a comic, bathetic dependency on shifty representatives of the underworld.\"Taylor (2003: 45) In line with this thinking, it is worth pointing out that in the 1981 BBC Television Shakespeare adaptation,The adaptation was filmed in 1981 but it didn\u2019t air until 1983 Joan, and the French in general, are treated predominantly as comic figures. Joan (Brenda Blethyn), Alen\u00e7on (Michael Byrne), the Bastard (Brian Protheroe), Reignier (David Daker) and Charles (Ian Saynor) are treated as buffoons for the most part, and there is no indication of any malevolence (significantly, when Joan's fiends abandon her, we never see them, we simply see her talking to empty air). Examples of the comic treatment of the characters are found during the battle of Orl\u00e9ans, where Joan is ludicrously depicted as defending the city from the entire English army single-handed, whilst Talbot stands by incredulously watching his soldiers flee one after another. Another example appears in Act 2, Scene 1, as the five of them blame one another for the breach in the watch at Orl\u00e9ans that allowed the English back into the city. Their role as comic figures is also shown in Act 3, Scene 2. After Joan has entered Rouen and the others stand outside waiting for her signal.
