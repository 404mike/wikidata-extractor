He was born at Willingale, Essex, and died at Wortham, Suffolk.\nHume played in eight first-class games for Cambridge University between 1839 and 1844 and four matches for MCC between 1840 and 1842; his Cambridge career included the 1841 and 1842 University Matches against Oxford University. While full scorecards are not available for most of his games, he does not appear to have bowled in major matches, nor to have kept wicket, and his batting, in 21 innings across the 12 games from a variety of positions in the batting order, yielded only 64 runs at an average of 3.36 runs per innings and with a highest score of just 16.", "link_mentions": {}}}
