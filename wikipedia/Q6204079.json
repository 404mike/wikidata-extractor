She is noted for being from a generation of British avant-garde animators such as Brothers Quay and David Anderson. They made/make work which brings concepts from postmodern literature, the surrealist movement, and contemporary art to cinema. Her films, which use collage, textured painting, and text, provide counterpoint between the metaphysical and the playful. Lilliputian characters are often introduced to an apocalyptic realm ruled by giants.\nShe made her first commissioned short film, Sawdust for Brains and the Key of Wisdom, for Channel 4 Television in the 1990s.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Animafest Zagreb", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1990||The Brooch Pin And The Sinful Clasp || JoWonder ||"]}, {"page": "1990 in animation", "response": ["* JoWonder's The Brooch Pin and the Sinful Clasp premiers."]}, {"page": "Joanna Woodward", "response": ["#REDIRECT JoWonder"]}, {"page": "JoWOnder", "response": ["#REDIRECT JoWonder "]}, {"page": "Jo Wonder", "response": ["#REDIRECT JoWonder"]}, {"page": "Joanna Woodward AKA JoWonder", "response": ["#REDIRECT JoWonder"]}, {"page": "Cartazini Art Award", "response": ["*2019 - JoWonder"]}]}}
