The doctor who delivered her was Dr Anthony Todd Thomson, and Thomson's sister Catherine later became Gaskell's stepmother. She was the youngest of eight children; only she and her brother John survived infancy. Her father, William Stevenson, a Unitarian from Berwick-upon-Tweed, was minister at Failsworth, Lancashire, but resigned his orders on conscientious grounds; he moved to London in 1806 with the intention of going to India after he was appointed private secretary to the Earl of Lauderdale, who was to become Governor General of India.  That position did not materialise, however, and instead, Stevenson was nominated Keeper of the Treasury Records."]}, {"page": "William Stevenson", "response": ["William Stevenson may refer to:", "* Sir William Stevenson (colonial administrator) (1805\u20131863), Governor of Mauritius", "* William Stevenson (judge) (1934\u20132021), Canadian Supreme Court justice", "* William Stevenson (New Zealand politician, born 1901) (1901\u20131983), New Zealand industrialist and philanthropist", "* William Stevenson (New Zealand politician, born 1864) (1864\u20131935), member of the New Zealand Legislative Council", "* Sir William Stevenson (poet) (1530\u20131575), English poet", "* William Stevenson (publisher) (1741\u20131821), English publisher and author", "* William Stevenson (Scottish writer) (1772\u20131829), Scottish nonconformist preacher and writer; father of Elizabeth Gaskell", "* William Stevenson (minister) (1805\u20131873), Scottish minister and antiquarian", "* William Stevenson (bishop) (1878\u20131945), Australian Anglican bishop", "* William Stevenson (athlete) (1900\u20131985), U.S. Olympic athlete, lawyer, and ambassador", "* William Stevenson (canoeist) (born 1923\u20131992), Canadian canoeist", "* William Stevenson (Canadian writer) (1924\u20132013), British-born Canadian author and journalist"]}, {"page": "Balgreen", "response": ["* William Stevenson (1772\u20131829), Scottish nonconformist preacher and writer, farmed in this area."]}, {"page": "Saughton", "response": ["* William Stevenson (1772\u20131829), Scottish nonconformist preacher and writer."]}, {"page": "Stenhouse, Edinburgh", "response": ["* William Stevenson (1772\u20131829), Scottish nonconformist preacher and writer"]}, {"page": "William Gaskell", "response": ["Gaskell married Elizabeth Cleghorn Stevenson, daughter of the late Unitarian minister William Stevenson, in 1832.
