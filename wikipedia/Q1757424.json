The first words of the Aeneid are arma uirumque, \"arms and a man\". The Thebaid opens with fraternas acies alternaque regna, \"fraternal battle-lines and alternate reigns\". While the structure of the first line puts the Achilleid within the Vergilian tradition of martial epic, Philip Hardie sees the last line quoted above as an indication of Statius' debt to Ovid.Hardie (1993) 63 n. 8. Specifically, the choice of the verb deducere, \"to lead down\", evokes the invocation in the Metamorphoses in which Ovid asks the gods to lead down (deducite) to his own time a \"perpetual song\" (perpetuum carmen),Ovid, Met. 1.4 with which Hardie also compares Statius' \"Troy's whole story\" (tota Troia, literally: \"all of Troy\")."]}, {"page": "Pharsalia", "response": ["De Bello Civili (; On the Civil War), more commonly referred to as the Pharsalia, is a Roman epic poem written by the poet Lucan, detailing the civil war between Julius Caesar and the forces of the Roman Senate led by Pompey the Great. The poem's title is a reference to the Battle of Pharsalus, which occurred in 48 BC, near Pharsalus, Thessaly, in northern Greece. Caesar decisively defeated Pompey in this battle, which occupies all of the epic's seventh book. In the early twentieth century, translator J. D. Duff, while arguing that \"no reasonable judgment can rank Lucan among the world's great epic poets\", notes that the work is notable for Lucan's decision to eschew divine intervention and downplay supernatural occurrences in the events of the story. Scholarly estimation of Lucan's poem and poetry has since changed, as explained by commentator Philip Hardie in 2013: \"In recent decades, it has undergone a thorough critical re-evaluation, to re-emerge as a major expression of Neronian politics and aesthetics, a poem whose studied artifice enacts a complex relationship between poetic fantasy and historical reality.\"Hardie (2013), p. 225"]}, {"page": "Hardie", "response": ["* Philip Hardie, professor of Latin literature"]}, {"page": "List of Old Paulines", "response": ["*Philip Hardie (born 1951), professor and specialist in Latin literature, Cambridge University"]}, {"page": "Materiali e discussioni per l'analisi dei testi classici", "response": ["MD was founded by a group of scholars around the editor Gian Biagio Conte in Pisa in 1978.

Normally, when the descriptive analysis of a place is found to discontinue a narrative, this interrupting section can be considered topothesia.
