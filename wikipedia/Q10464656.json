He played as a centre forward.\nLewis was born in Evesham, Worcestershire. He joined Small Heath from Birmingham & District League champions Hereford Thistle in 1897. He made his Small Heath debut on 4 September 1897, the opening day of the 1897\u201398 Second Division season, in a 3\u20131 win at home to Burton Swifts. In his first 14 games he scored seven goals, but his form dipped in the latter part of the season, and the arrival of Bob McRoberts prompted Lewis's return to non-league football with Bromyard.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1897\u201398 Small Heath F.C. season", "response": ["Small Heath prepared for the new season with a friendly match at Coventry Road against a Burton Wanderers team made up largely of local youngsters. In front of only a couple of hundred spectators in \"pelting\" rain, Walter Abbott, Charlie Hare, and Wilson Lewis scored in a 3\u20131 win. The first League game took place a few days later at Wanderers' neighbours Burton Swifts. Fielding three debutants, Small Heath took a one-goal lead in the first half, then took advantage of the wind at their backs after the interval to extend their lead to three goals before Swifts scored a late consolation.\"Second Division\". Lloyd's Weekly Newspaper (London): p.24. 5 September 1897. The Standard thought the team \"unfortunate in scoring only two goals\" in the first half, and two from Abbott in the second gave them a 4\u20130 victory in a friendly against Lincoln City At home to Leicester Fosse, in \"delightful\" weather in front of an 8,000 crowd, Hare scored the second-half winner after Fosse's Harry Smith had a goal disallowed for offside.\"Smallheath v. Leicester Fosse\". Liverpool Mercury: p.9. 13 September 1897. The Leicester Chronicle felt that the Heathens' first goal \"ought never to have been allowed in consequence of unfair charging\", that there was nothing wrong with Smith's disallowed header, and that \"Small Heath got the better of each decision\".\"Football Notes\". Leicester Chronicle: p.6. 18 September 1897.", "Walton's second-half equaliser from a corner earned Small Heath a draw at Darwen, where the Owl suggested they needed \"a little more dash and go in front of goal\".\"Darwen v.

At home to Gainsborough Trinity on the Tuesday, they led 4\u20133 at the interval, despite losing Jimmy Inglis to injury, and that was the final score.\"Smallheath v. Gainsborough Trinity\". Liverpool Mercury: p.11. 11 October 1897. The Dart reported that \"the attendances at Coventry Road this season have been most satisfactory, and the directors of the club are on the very best of terms with themselves as a consequence.\"'Retlaw' (15 October 1897). \"Football Arrows\".

Without both Hare and Inglis for the opening round of the Staffordshire Senior Cup, Small Heath nevertheless beat a full Wolverhampton Wanderers first team by three goals to two, Wilson Lewis scoring twice. The Owl's 'Captain Forward' reiterated his praise of Archer, as \"one of the best defenders the Club has ever had, [who] on this occasion was on splendid form.\"'Captain Forward' (22 October 1897). \"League Tit-Bits\".
