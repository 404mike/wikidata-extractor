He wrote about the Quaker movement and was an influential promoter and defender of it.\nPenington was the oldest son of Isaac Penington, a Puritan who had served as the Lord Mayor of London. Penington married a widow named Mary Springett and they had five children. Penington's stepdaughter Gulielma Springett married William Penn. Convinced that the Quaker faith was true, Penington and his wife joined the Friends in 1657 or 1658.\nPenington became an influential promoter and defender of the Quaker movement, writing extensively on many topics.  His writings are prized for their insightful and eloquent exploration of spiritual experience, with his Letters being read continuously within Quakerism for their spiritual counsel.  His complete works were first published in 1681 and are still in print today.Penington also published several books about the movement. He was imprisoned six times for his beliefs, starting in 1661.  Sometimes the charge was refusal to take an oath, as this went against Quaker teachings (see Testimony of Integrity). Such action was prohibited by the Quaker Act of 1662, which sought to control members of the group.  At other times Penington was charged with attending a Quaker meeting, which was forbidden by the Conventicle Act of 1664.\nPenington's wife, Mary, was a remarkable woman in her own right.  Her daughter Gulielma, from her first marriage to Sir William Springett (who died young), later married William Penn, founder of Pennsylvania; she was his first wife.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Fox", "response": ["At least on one point, Charles listened to Fox. The 700 Quakers who had been imprisoned under Richard Cromwell were released, though the government remained uncertain about the group's links with other, more violent, movements. A revolt by the Fifth Monarchists in January 1661 led to the suppression of that sect and the repression of other Nonconformists, including Quakers.Fox in Nickalls, pp. 394\u2013395, and Jones, chapter 14. In the aftermath of this attempted coup, Fox and eleven other Quakers issued a broadside proclaiming what became known among Friends in the 20th century as the \"peace testimony\", committing themselves to oppose all outward wars and strife as contrary to the will of God. Not all his followers accepted this commitment; Isaac Penington, for example, dissented for a time, arguing that the state had a duty to protect the innocent from evil, if necessary by using military force. Despite the testimony, persecution against Quakers and other dissenters continued."]}, {"page": "Pennington, New Jersey", "response": ["According to an 1883 history, \"the first name of the village was Queenstown, which was given it in honor of Queen Anne.

Burrough's preaching impressed Ellwood, and after attending a second meeting at High Wycombe he joined the new sect and adopted their modes of dress and speech. His father resented his son's conversion, thrashed him for wearing his hat in his presence, and kept him confined in the house through the winter of 1660. Neither blows nor persuasion could induce Ellwood to renounce his new sentiments, to take off his hat before his parents, or to address them with other pronouns than \"thou\" and \"thee.\" At Easter, the Peningtons managed to move him to Chalfont St. Peters, where he stayed till Whitsuntide.

The Friend's theology was so similar to the Quakers' that one of two published works associated with the preacher was a plagiarism of Isaac Penington's Works because, according to Abner Brownell, the Friend felt that the sentiments would have more resonance if republished in the name of the Universal Friend.
