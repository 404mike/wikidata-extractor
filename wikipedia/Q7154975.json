In this session of the Assembly, she occasionally voted against the party line, supporting a Democratic Unionist Party motion for Sinn F\u00e9in MLAs to be excluded from the Executive.  In November 2001, she was suspended from the UUP, at the same time that Peter Weir was expelled from the party, after the two voted against party leader David Trimble's re-appointment as First Minister.Armitage sat as an independent Unionist for the remainder of the session.
