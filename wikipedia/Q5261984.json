Snyder isolated morphine-like peptides from calf brain. Eric J. Simon, who independently discovered opioid receptors, would later term these peptides as endorphins. This term was essentially assigned to any peptide that demonstrated morphine-like activity. In 1976, Choh Hao Li and David Chung recorded the sequences of \u03b1-, \u03b2-, and \u03b3-endorphin isolated from camel pituitary glands for their opioid activity. They identified that \u03b2-endorphin produced strong analgesic effects. Wilhelm Feldberg and Derek George Smyth in 1977 confirmed this claim, finding \u03b2-endorphin to be much stronger than morphine. In addition, they found that it is completely removed from opiate receptors by naloxone, an identified morphine antagonist."]}, {"page": "Joseph S. Fruton", "response": ["Most of Fruton's early research at Yale was funded by a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation; Warren Weaver was making enzymology one of the Foundation's research focuses.  Fruton headed a growing lab that included doctoral students, postdoctoral researchers, and technical assistants.  The two main areas of research were the action of proteolytic enzymes and the chemical (as opposed to biological) synthesis of peptides (the substrates used to explore the enzymatic reactions).  Members of Fruton's lab studied cathepsin C and several other peptidases, as well as proteinases that catalyzed transpeptidation, which was thought (and ultimately confirmed) to be part of the biosynthesis of proteins.Fruton, Eighty Years, pp. 89\u201392  Rather than leading a team effort focused on a small number of high-priority problems, Fruton allowed members of his laboratory to choose their own problems (usually within the broad bounds of protein synthesis and proteinases).  Ph.D. students and postdoctoral researchers who worked in Fruton's lab include: Mary Ellen Jones, Melvin Fried, Hannelore W\u00fcrz, Peter Heinrich, Karen Nilsson, Bob Metrione, Yoshihiro Okuda, George Taborsky, Christine Zioudrou, Maxine Singer, Louis Cohen, Frederick Newth, John Thanassi, Charles Drey, Derek George Smyth, Atsuo Nagamatsu, and Milton Winitz.  A number of prominent biochemists from outside Yale also spent time in Fruton's biochemistry department during his tenure as chair, including: Harry Kroll, Rosabelle McManus, John Clark Lewis, Herbert Gutfreund, Max Gruber, Frank Hird, Vernon Ingram, Hans Kornberg, Dimitrios Theodoropoulos, and Hans Tuppy.Fruton, Eighty Years, pp. 128\u2013131"]}, {"page": "Derek Smyth", "response": ["#REDIRECT Derek George Smyth"]}]}}
