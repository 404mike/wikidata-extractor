Following building speculation, the county team moved across the River Itchen to Day's Antelope Ground, although the building proposal fell through and so Hampshire returned across the river to the Antelope Ground. Hampshire County Cricket Club, formed in September 1863, became tenants. In 1883, James Fellowes began negotiations for the lease and development of  land in Northlands Road which formed part of the Hulse estate.

This was a low-scoring match with Hampshire being bowled out for 67 in the first innings; England replied with a total of 99, but Hampshire only managed 27 in their second innings and England thus won by an innings and 5 runs. England's best bowler was William Hillyer who took 15 wickets in the match.", "In 1845, the ground was first threatened by building speculation, resulting in Daniel Day moving to a ground at the Woolston Hotel on the south side of Woolston Road, Itchen, a few hundred yards across the River Itchen from Southampton.
