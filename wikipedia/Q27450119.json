He obtained a number of research fellowships at the Chemistry Department in Cambridge. He gained his first teaching post at the University of Sheffield in 1931, where he began research into liquid crystals. In 1947 he was appointed to a professorial chair in Chemistry at the University College Hull. A year later he was awarded the DSc higher doctorate. During his early years at Hull he was made Dean of Science, and later Deputy Principal. When the college achieved full university status in 1954, he became its Pro-Vice-Chancellor. In 1956, on the retirement of John H Nicholson, Jones was appointed Vice-Chancellor.\nBrynmor Jones oversaw a period of rapid expansion of the University of Hull, with student numbers quadrupling during his time in office. He notably steered the university through a period of significant student unrest over the summer of 1968. In the same year he received a knighthood in the New Year's Honours List. Jones was a driving force behind the expansion of Hull University library, working closely with the university librarian Philip Larkin. The new library was opened in 1960; later, in 1967, it was named the Brynmor Jones Library in his honour. Jones received a number of honorary degrees. He retired in 1972.[1]", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Philip Larkin", "response": ["After graduating from Oxford University in 1943 with a first in English Language and Literature, Larkin became a librarian. It was during the thirty years he worked with distinction as university librarian at the Brynmor Jones Library at the University of Hull that he produced the greater part of his published work. His poems are marked by what Andrew Motion calls \"a very English, glum accuracy\u201d about emotions, places, and relationships, and what Donald Davie described as \"lowered sights and diminished expectations\". Eric Homberger (echoing Randall Jarrell) called him \"the saddest heart in the post-war supermarket\"\u2014Larkin himself said that deprivation for him was \u201cwhat daffodils were for Wordsworth\u201d.Motion 2005, pp. 208\u2013209; Chatterjee 2006, p. 19 (for Donald Davie). Influenced by W. H. Auden, W. B. Yeats, and Thomas Hardy, his poems are highly structured but flexible verse forms. They were described by Jean Hartley, the ex-wife of Larkin's publisher George Hartley (the Marvell Press), as a \"piquant mixture of lyricism and discontent\", though anthologist Keith Tuma writes that there is more to Larkin's work than its reputation for dour pessimism suggests.Tuma 2001, p. 445.", "In 1955 Larkin became University Librarian at the University of Hull, a post he held until his death.Motion 1993, pp. 244\u2013245 Professor R. L. Brett, who was chairman of the library committee that appointed him and a friend, wrote, \"At first I was impressed with the time he spent in his office, arriving early and leaving late. It was only later that I realised that his office was also his study where he spent hours on his private writing as well as the work of the library. Then he would return home and on a good many evenings start writing again.\" For his first year he lodged in bedsits. In 1956, at the age of 34, he rented a self-contained flat on the top-floor of 32 Pearson Park, a three-storey red-brick house overlooking the park, previously the American Consulate.Motion 1993, p. 276. This, it seems, was the vantage point later commemorated in the poem High Windows.Bradford 2005, p.154 Of the city itself Larkin commented: \"I never thought about Hull until I was here. Having got here, it suits me in many ways. It is a little on the edge of things, I think even its natives would say that. I rather like being on the edge of things. One doesn't really go anywhere by design, you know, you put in for jobs and move about, you know, I've lived in other places.\"Larkin, speaking on BBC's Monitor, 15 December 1964 In the post-war years, Hull University underwent significant expansion, as was typical of British universities during that period. When Larkin took up his appointment there, the plans for a new university library were already far advanced. He made a great effort in just a few months to familiarize himself with them before they were placed before the University Grants Committee; he suggested a number of emendations, some major and structural, all of which were adopted. It was built in two stages, and in 1967 it was named the Brynmor Jones Library after Sir Brynmor Jones, the university's vice-chancellor.", "Larkin's role in the creation of Hull University's new Brynmor Jones Library had been important and demanding. Soon after the completion of the second and larger phase of construction in 1969,Bradford 2005, p. 217. he was able to redirect his energies. In October 1970, he started to work on compiling a new anthology, The Oxford Book of Twentieth Century English Verse (1973). He was awarded a Visiting Fellowship at All Souls College, Oxford, for two academic terms, allowing him to consult Oxford's Bodleian Library, a copyright library. While he was in Oxford he passed responsibility for the Library to his deputy, Brenda Moon. Larkin was a major contributor to the re-evaluation of the poetry of Thomas Hardy, which, in comparison to his novels, had been overlooked; in Larkin's \"idiosyncratic\" and \"controversial\" anthology,Motion 1993, p. 407.Motion 1993, p. 431. Hardy was the poet most generously represented. There were twenty-seven poems by Hardy, compared with only nine by T. S. Eliot (however, Eliot is most famous for long poems); the other poets most extensively represented were W. B. Yeats, W. H. Auden and Rudyard Kipling. Larkin included six of his own poems\u2014the same number as for Rupert Brooke. In the process of compiling the volume he had been disappointed not to find more and better poems as evidence that the clamour over the Modernists had stifled the voices of traditionalists. The most favourable responses to the anthology were those of Auden and John Betjeman, while the most hostile was that of Donald Davie, who accused Larkin of \"positive cynicism\" and of encouraging \"the perverse triumph of philistinism, the cult of the amateur ... [and] the weakest kind of Englishry\". After an initial period of anxiety about the anthology's reception, Larkin enjoyed the clamour.Bowen 2008, p. 107.", "In contrast to the number of audio recordings of Larkin reading his own work, there are very few appearances by Larkin on television. The only programme in which he agreed to be filmed taking part is Down Cemetery Road (1964), from the BBC Monitor series, in which Larkin was interviewed by John Betjeman. The filming took place in and around Hull (with some filming in North Lincolnshire), and showed Larkin in his natural surroundings: his flat in Pearson Park, the Brynmor Jones Library; and visiting churches and cemeteries. The film was broadcast on BBC Four. In 1981, Larkin was part of a group of poets who surprised John Betjeman on his seventy-fifth birthday by turning up on his doorstep with gifts and greetings. This scene was filmed by Jonathan Stedall and later featured in the third episode of his 1983 series for BBC2, Time With Betjeman.", "From 5 July to 1 October 2017, as part of the Hull UK City of Culture 2017 celebrations, the Brynmor Jones Library at Hull University mounted an exhibition entitled \"Larkin: New Eyes Each Year\". The exhibition featured objects from Larkin's life, as well as his personal collection of books from his last home at Newland Park, in the original shelf order that Larkin classified them in."]}, {"page": "University of Hull", "response": ["thumb|Brynmor Jones Library", "The period of rapid expansion of Hull University coincided with the vice-chancellorship of Sir Brynmor Jones (1956\u20131972), during whose time in office student numbers quadrupled.", "The Brynmor Jones Library, which houses more than a million volumes, was constructed in two phases: the first phase was fully completed in 1959, with a tower block extension officially opened in 1970. During the 1950s and 1960s a considerable number of academic buildings were built, including the Larkin and Wilberforce Buildings (originally given other names). The 'Martin Plan' of 1967, Sir Leslie Martin was the university architect, envisaged a campus with its tallest buildings in the centre surrounded by buildings diminishing in height towards the perimeter. In the course of the 1960s most of the departments housed in temporary structures were moved into new purpose-built premises.Bamford, pp, 222\u2013246 However, Biochemistry was still partially located in a 'hut' to the rear of the Venn building into the early 1980s. This early phase of expansion through building ended in 1974, after this year there was to be no further academic building construction on the campus until 1996. However, student numbers doubled in this period, with the university becoming highly efficient in using its existing building stock.", "In 2012, the University began the ambitious refurbishment of the Brynmor Jones Library, a \u00a328\u00a0million project which will transform the 7 storey former workplace of Philip Larkin, into a learning hub suitable for students for years to come.
