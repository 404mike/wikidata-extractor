Guitarist Bob Johnson had heard the song when he attended a folk-carol service with his father-in-law in Cambridge, and brought it to the attention of the rest of the band. (Unlike the album version which fades up slowly and fades down slowly, the single was at the same volume for the entire length of the song.) This single is one of only three top 50 British hits to be sung fully in Latin (the others were both recordings of \"Pie Jesu\" from Andrew Lloyd Webber's Requiem; firstly by Sarah Brightman and Paul Miles-Kingston in 1986, secondly as a minor hit by the 12-year-old Charlotte Church in 1998). In 1975 Mike Oldfield had a top 10 hit with \"In Dulci Jubilo\" but this Latin song was performed as an instrumental. \"Oh What a Circus\" from the 1976 musical Evita, and a hit single performed by David Essex, includes a choral chant in Latin, based on the Catholic anthem \"Salve Regina\". \"Gaudete\" is also one of only a handful of a cappella performances to become hit singles. (Other notable examples are \"Only You\", sung by the Flying Pickets, \"After the Gold Rush\", sung by Prelude, \"Don't Worry, Be Happy\" by Bobby McFerrin and \"Caravan of Love\", sung by the Housemartins.)
