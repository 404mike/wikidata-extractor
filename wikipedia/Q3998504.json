In Bonds' first full season, 1990\u201391, West Ham again secured promotion to Division One. Now back in the top flight, Bonds saw West Ham through one of their most controversial seasons. With the club planning to introduce a bond scheme, there was crowd unrest. West Ham finished last and were relegated back to Division Two after only one season. However, they rebounded strongly in 1992\u201393.

In 1984\u201385, the lowest ever league attendance was recorded at the County Ground where only 942 people turn up to watch the Cobblers lose 2\u20130 at home to Chester City; this was also the only ever league attendance under 1,000. In the same year, The club managed what seemed like a major coup when they appointed Tony Barton, who had won the European Cup with Aston Villa two years previously, as manager. Barton's only season in charge proved severely disappointing however, as the club were never outside the bottom two, and health problems forced Barton's resignation near the end of that season. Success was achieved under Barton's replacement, Graham Carr, who brought in several players from the non-league in addition to a number of quality league players to finish eighth in his first season in charge. The 1986\u201387 season saw Northampton win the Fourth Division championship, gaining a club record total of 99 points and scoring 103 goals, 29 of them to Richard Hill, who was transferred in the summer to Watford for a club record fee of \u00a3265,000.

Despite his presence, the team finished bottom of the First Division and missed out on the first season of the Premier League. The 1992\u201393 season was an eventful one for Dicks, mainly for the wrong reasons. He was sent off three times and picked up a string of bookings which saw him miss significant periods of the season and he was subsequently stripped of the captaincy by manager Bonds. His first dismissal came after he threw his elbow into the face of Newcastle United player Franz Carr. There had been no friction between the two players with Dicks saying of the incident \"Not to this day do I know why I did it. I had it in my mind that I was going to elbow him, and that was it\u00a0\u2014 bang!\". Only four games passed before he was dismissed again. In a game against Wolverhampton Wanderers, Dicks clashed with Paul Birch and Steve Bull before being sent-off, with Billy Bonds having to stop him attacking Birch who was still on the ground. Barely three months passed before his third dismissal of the season. In January 1993 after two bad fouls on Derby County midfielder Ted McMinn he was sent-off, having to be escorted from the pitch by teammate Clive Allen. Despite his disciplinary problems he earned a Division One runners-up medal as West Ham reached the Premier League. Despite his dismissals he played 34 league games of a possible 46 in the promotion season, scoring eleven goals, placing third in the list of highest goal scorers for that season behind only Clive Allen and Trevor Morley."]}, {"page": "List of West Ham United F.C. seasons", "response": ["|Trevor Morley", "|Trevor Morley", "|Trevor Morley"]}, {"page": "1989\u201390 West Ham United F.C. season", "response": ["However, some new signings, including Ludek Miklosko, Trevor Morley and Ian Bishop, went on to become West Ham legends.", "|Trevor Morley"]}, {"page": "1990\u201391 West Ham United F.C. season", "response": ["Trevor Morley was West Ham's leading scorer for 1990\u201391, with 12 goals in the league and 17 in all competitions, while Frank McAvennie showed full fitness after a long term injury by scoring 10 goals in the league (11 in all competitions) to finish the campaign as the club's second top scorer.", "|Trevor Morley"]}, {"page": "1991\u201392 West Ham United F.C. season", "response": ["However, their return to the First Division lasted just one season and they were relegated in bottom place, missing out on a place in the new FA Premier League, which would be created for the 1992-93 season.
