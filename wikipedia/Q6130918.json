He joined the London Hospital Medical College as a lecturer in 1963. He progressed to senior lecturer in 1965 and reader from 1970.  He was also a senior lecturer at St Bartholomew's Hospital Medical College from 1971. He succeeded Francis Camps to the Chair of Forensic Medicine in 1973 which he occupied until his retirement in 1992.Cameron was involved in many high profile investigations, including the death of Rudolf Hess in Spandau Prison in his capacity as Senior Honorary Consultant in Forensic Medicine to the Armed Forces. \nHis testimony was discredited in other cases, including the infamous Maxwell Confait murder case of 1972, in which Cameron's incorrect testimony regarding time of death led to the wrongful conviction of three young men. The case had huge ramifications ultimately leading to a Royal Commission on Criminal Procedure. \nHis testimony at the Lindy Chamberlain trial in 1982 assisted her wrongful conviction for the murder of her baby daughter Azaria. The conviction was overturned in 1988 and Cameron's conclusions were criticised by Chief Justice Asche in his opinion in \"Re Conviction of Chamberlain\" (1988).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lindy Chamberlain-Creighton", "response": ["The prosecution's expert testimony for forensic evidence included that of James Cameron, a scientist who had also given crucial evidence in a case in England which was later overturned when his expert evidence was proved wrong. With regard to the timing of the baby's cry and Chamberlain's whereabouts, the prosecution also claimed that the Chamberlains convinced fellow camper and witness Sally Lowe to say that she heard Azaria cry after Chamberlain returned to the camp fire.", "Les Harris, then President of the Dingo Foundation, gave evidence that his opinion based on years of studying dingoes is that a dingo could have enveloped the head of a baby in its mouth and carried the weight of a baby over long distances. He produced photographs of dingoes enveloping the head of a baby-sized doll in its jaws. However, forensic expert Professor James Cameron gave evidence that, based on studying plaster casts of dingo jaws, it was impossible for a dingo to open its jaws wide enough to encompass a child's head."]}, {"page": "Death of Azaria Chamberlain", "response": ["The Northern Territory Police and prosecutors were dissatisfied with this finding. Investigations continued, leading to a second inquest in Darwin in September 1981. Based on ultraviolet photographs of Azaria's jumpsuit, James Cameron of the London Hospital Medical College alleged that \"there was an incised wound around the neck of the jumpsuit\u2014in other words, a cut throat\" and that there was an imprint of the hand of a small adult on the jumpsuit, visible in the photographs. Their Yellow Holden Torana was also seized in Queensland and flown by military aircraft to Alice Springs. Following this and other findings, the Chamberlains were charged with Azaria's murder.  There was also no CCTV in the area in those days."]}, {"page": "James Cameron (disambiguation)", "response": ["James Cameron (born 1954) is a Canadian film director.", "James Cameron may also refer to:", "* James Cameron (activist) (1914\u20132006), American civil-rights activist", "* James Cameron (American football) (1938\u20131995), American College football coach", "* James Cameron (footballer) (1868\u20131934), Scottish footballer", "* James Cameron (journalist) (1911\u20131985), British journalist", "* James Cameron (missionary) (1799\u20131875), Scottish artisan missionary", "* James Cameron (scientist) (1930\u20132003), British forensic scientist involved in the Lindy Chamberlain case", "* James Cameron (South African cricketer) (born 1979), former South African cricketer", "* James Cameron (Union colonel) (1800\u20131861), American Union Army colonel", "* James Cameron (Victorian politician) (1846\u20131922), Australian politician", "* James Cameron (Zimbabwean cricketer) (born 1986), Zimbabwean cricketer", "* James Cameron-Dow (born 1990), South African cricketer"]}, {"page": "Murder of Maxwell Confait", "response": ["In court, the pathologist, Professor James Cameron, changed his opinion concerning the time of death, saying it could have been as late as 1:00 a.m. and that the heat of the fire could have sped up the onset of rigor mortis."]}, {"page": "Deaths in June 2003", "response": ["*James Cameron, 73, British professor of forensic medicine (FINA) and forensic scientist (A Cry in the Dark)."]}]}}
