Having qualified as a chartered accountant by the age of 21, he worked for Price Waterhouse in Paris for a couple of years and then dropped out, first to Ibiza and then Menorca.  Following his passion for islands, he subsequently moved to Lealt, a remote house on the Scottish island of Jura in the Inner Hebrides where, in the 1960s and 70s  with his partner Susan Searight, he researched and painstakingly excavated numerous coastal sites.  His many papers have established Jura as a significant Mesolithic area.\nWhilst at Lealt, as well as his archaeological work, he lived off-grid, built his own loom from driftwood, invented a spinning wheel from recycled parts, and established a workshop to spin, dye and weave the local blackface wool into rugs.\nHe was a committed human rights researcher and activist, particularly in the Western Sahara and Mauritania, contributing influential research reports to the Minority Rights Group and also the Anti-Slavery Society. His report on slavery in Mauritania has been widely cited. The John Mercer Human Rights Trust, set up after his death, commemorates this strand of his life.\nMercer's first books were for young people, Lizard Island Expedition and The Cormorant and the Stranger, drawing on his own experiences in the Balearics. He wrote an illustrated guidebook to the islands of Colonsay, Gigha and Jura  and several books on the Canary Islands. An independent thinker  with eclectic interests, he also wrote about, amongst other topics, hand-spinning, communes, and Scottish devolution.\nHe was a Fellow of the Institute of Linguists, of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society, and of  the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland.\nJohn Mercer died from motor neurone disease at Lealt at the age of 48.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Canary Islands", "response": ["In 1402, the Castilian colonisation of the islands began, with the expedition of the French explorers Jean de B\u00e9thencourt and Gadifer de la Salle, nobles and vassals of Henry III of Castile, to Lanzarote. From there, they went on to conquer Fuerteventura (1405) and El Hierro. These invasions were \u2018brutal cultural and military clashes between the indigenous population and the Castilians\u2019 lasting over a century due to formidable resistance by indigenous Canarians. B\u00e9thencourt received the title King of the Canary Islands, but still recognised King Henry III as his overlord. It was not a simple military enterprise, given the aboriginal resistance on some islands. Neither was it politically, since the particular interests of the nobility (determined to strengthen their economic and political power through the acquisition of the islands) conflicted with those of the states, particularly Castile, which were in the midst of territorial expansion and in a process of strengthening of the Crown against the nobility.John Mercer, The Canary Islanders: their prehistory, conquest, and survival  (1980).", "In 1618 the Barbary pirates from North Africa attacked Lanzarote and La Gomera taking 1000 captives to be sold as slaves.John Mercer (1980), The Canary Islanders : their prehistory, conquest, and survival, p. 236, Collings. Another noteworthy attack occurred in 1797, when Santa Cruz de Tenerife was attacked by a British fleet under Horatio Nelson on 25 July. The British were repulsed, losing almost 400 men. It was during this battle that Nelson lost his right arm."]}, {"page": "John Mercer", "response": ["John Mercer is the name of:", "* Captain John Mercer (died 1756), colonial Virginia militiaman killed at the Battle of Great Cacapon", "* John Mercer (colonial lawyer) (1704\u20131768), colonial Virginia lawyer", "* John Mercer (scientist) (1791\u20131866), British textile chemist", "* John Mercer (Australian pastoralist) (1823\u20131891), Australian landowner, pastoralist and politician in colonial Victoria", "* John Mercer (baseball) (1892\u20131982), American Major League Baseball first baseman", "* John Mercer (archaeologist) (1934\u20131982), British archaeologist and author", "* John Mercer (American politician) (born 1957), American legislator in the state of Montana", "* John Mercer (photojournalist) (born 1949), New Zealand photographer and photojournalist", "* John Mercer Langston (1829-1897), American abolitionist, attorney, educator, activist, diplomat, and politician"]}, {"page": "Barbary slave trade", "response": ["From bases on the Barbary coast, North Africa, the Barbary pirates raided ships traveling through the Mediterranean and along the northern and western coasts of Africa, plundering their cargo and enslaving the people they captured. From at least 1500, the pirates also conducted raids on seaside towns of Italy, Spain, France, England, the Netherlands and as far away as Iceland, capturing men, women and children. In 1544, Hayreddin Barbarossa captured the island of Ischia, taking 4,000 prisoners, and enslaved some 2,000\u20137,000 inhabitants of Lipari. In 1551, Ottoman corsair Dragut enslaved the entire population of the Maltese island of Gozo, between 5,000 and 6,000, sending them to Ottoman Tripolitania. In 1554 corsairs under Dragut sacked Vieste, beheaded 5,000 of its inhabitants, and abducted another 6,000. The Balearic Islands were invaded in 1558, and 4,000 people were taken into slavery.Carr, Matthew, Blood and Faith: the Purging of Muslim Spain (Leiden, 1968), p. 120. In 1618 the Algerian pirates attacked the Canary Islands taking 1000 captives to be sold as slaves.John Mercer (1980), The Canary Islanders : their prehistory, conquest, and survival, p. 236, Collings. On some occasions, settlements such as Baltimore in Ireland were abandoned following a raid, only being resettled many years later. Between 1609 and 1616, England alone lost 466 merchant ships to Barbary pirates.Rees Davies, \"British Slaves on the Barbary Coast\", BBC, 1 July 2003"]}, {"page": "Jura, Scotland", "response": ["Evidence of settlements on Jura dating from the Mesolithic period was first uncovered by the English archaeologist John Mercer in the 1960s.

John Mercer, in his 1973 book on Fuerteventura, says that the locals killed \"fifty [privateers] on the spot\". This would challenge Glas's claim that 200 to 300 attacked on the second time. Whatever the actual number, it is accepted that the second attack was put down with far more brutality and less pity. It would seem that all involved were killed, with no prisoners taken like on the first attack."]}]}}
