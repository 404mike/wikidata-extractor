While he was there, between 1919 and 1921, he not only met his future wife but also became friends with a fellow student, Henry Moore. In 1922 Moore and Coxon visited France and met a number of artists there, including Pierre Bonnard and Aristide Maillol. Coxon continued his studies in London at the Royal College of Art between 1921 and 1925 under Sir William Rothenstein. For his RCA Diploma submission, Coxon produced a mural based on Masaccio's Expulsion from the Garden of Eden. Coxon took a teaching post at the Richmond School of Art in 1925 and in 1926 he married Edna Ginesi, with Moore acting as his best-man. Coxon would later perform the same service for Moore when he married Irina Radetsky in July 1929. In 1927 the Coxons, Moore, Leon Underwood and others formed a short-lived artists grouping called the British Independent Society. The following year Coxon had his first one-man show at the Cooling Galleries. He became a member of the London Group in 1931 and of the Chiswick Group in 1938."]}, {"page": "List of alumni of the Royal College of Art", "response": ["* Edna Ginesi"]}, {"page": "Ginesi", "response": ["* Edna Ginesi (1902\u20132000), British artist"]}, {"page": "(Barbara) Hazel Guggenheim King-Farlow McKinley", "response": ["Whilst living in the south of England with Denys King-Farlow in the 1930s Hazel was influenced by a group of avante-garde artists, and had her first solo exhibition in London in April 1937 at the Coolings Gallery. She received instruction from artists Rowland Suddaby, Raymond Coxon, and Edna Ginesi, becoming associated with the London Group and the Euston Road School.  She painted primarily in watercolor. Her work included still-life, portraits, townscapes and landscapes. Although her first work was done in a \"slightly plain palette,\" her later work in the 1930s brightened, sometimes falling within the realm of fauvism. \"Under the influence of the Surrealists, Hazel's paintings after the 1930's became freer, though her work was far more whimsical and humorous than many artists more closely associated with the movement\" ", "Like her sister Peggy, Hazel collected major contemporary artworks and she very generously donated these works to public institutions. For example, she donated over 15 works to Wakefield Art Gallery, UK, in the 1930s, and in 1938 Hazel presented the painting Cossacks (Cosaques) by Wassily Kandinsky to the Tate galleries, which would become an important work within the Tate collection.  She also donated to the Tate works by artists Edna Ginesi and Raymond Coxon. She donated many paintings, some her own, to museums across the UK,  including the municipal collections of several English cities including Wakefield, Manchester, and Leeds."]}]}}
