Even with this popular enthusiasm, Urban was ensured that there would be an army of knights, drawn from the French aristocracy.

According to Princeton University political theorist Greg Conti, Stephen's political thought had liberal characteristics, even though he has frequently been characterized as conservative or religious authoritarian. According to Conti, Stephen \"articulated robustly both technocratic and pluralistic visions of politics. Perhaps more stridently than any Victorian, he put forward an argument for the necessity and legitimacy of expert rule against claims for popular government.

But no professional historian would commit to undertake it, and Wells, in a financially sound position thanks to the success of Mr. Britling Sees It Through and believing that his work would earn little, resolved to devote a year to the project. His wife Catherine (Jane) agreed to be his collaborator in typing, research, organisation, correspondence, and criticism. Wells relied heavily on the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (11th ed., 1911), and standard secondary texts. He made use of the London Library, and enlisted as critical readers \"a team of advisers for comment and correction, chief among them Ernest Barker, Harry Johnston, E.

One the one hand, Dewey belongs to a pluralist tradition that views the individual as the intersecting fusion of diverse social groups and overlapping associations \u2013 including the state itself. In this sense, Dewey's liberalism follows the likes of Arthur Bentley, Ernest Barker and Mary Parker Follett.Rogers, Melvin L. (April 21, 2010). \"Introduction: Revisiting The Public and Its Problems\". Contemporary Pragmatism. 7(1): 24. doi:10.1163/18758185-90000152. ISSN 1875-8185. On the other hand, by arguing that proper democracy requires the cultivation of certain personal qualities in all spheres of life, Dewey departs from the kind of liberal neutrality that some associate with John Rawls.Talisse, Robert B. (2017). \"Deweyan Democracy and the Rawlsian Problematic: A Reply to Joshua Forstenzer\". Transactions of the Charles S. Peirce Society. 53, no. 4: 579\u2013583. Robert B. Talisse, for instance, argues that Dewey's conception of democracy as a way of life is incompatible with genuine pluralism.Talisse, Robert B. (2003). \"Can Democracy Be a Way of Life? Deweyan Democracy and the Problem of Pluralism\". Transactions of the Charles S. Peirce Society. 39, no. 1: 1\u201321. Talisse claims that Dewey's conception of democracy imposes a specific vision of good onto others, thereby relinquishing the pluralist aspirations of liberalism. Joshua Forstenzer has replied to Talisse's objection by holding that Deweyan democracy relies upon only a \"thin\" definition of the good \u2013 as opposed to a robust, comprehensive doctrine.Forstenzer, Joshua (2017). \"Deweyan Democracy, Robert Talisse, and the Fact of Reasonable Pluralism: A Rawlsian Response\". Transactions of the Charles S. Peirce Society. 53, No. 4: 553\u2013578. For Forstenzer, no political system can ever be neutral vis-\u00e0-vis substantive definitions of the good; on his view, Deweyan democracy may invite the cultivation of certain democratic virtues, but it remains sufficiently broad for people of diverse backgrounds, faiths, and cultural traditions to live according to their own principles \u2014 to a large extent at least. Similarly, Shane J. Ralston argues that Deweyan democracy and pluralism are entirely compatible.Ralston, Shane J. (2008). \"In Defense of Democracy as a Way of Life: A Reply to Talisse's Pluralist Objection\". Transactions of the Charles S. Peirce Society. 44, no. 4: 629\u201360. More specifically, Ralston claims that Dewey offers a set of pluralist procedures that allow democracy as a way of life to include a robust respect of value-diversity, illustrating her argument with a real-life case studies.Ralston, Shane J.
