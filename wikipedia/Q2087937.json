He has combined molecular, genetic and imaging studies with population and ecological models and computational analysis to understand flower development.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "University of East Anglia", "response": ["Present faculty include former IPCC Chairman Sir Robert Watson;\u2018WATSON, Sir Robert (Tony)\u2019, Who's Who 2014, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 2014 scientists Sir David Hopwood,\u2018HOPWOOD, Sir David (Alan)\u2019, Who's Who 2014, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 2014 Phil Jones,\u2018JONES, Prof. Philip Douglas\u2019, Who's Who 2014, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 2014 Corinne Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9, Jonathan D.
