O'Malley issued British passports to them.  Kowerski became \"Anthony Kennedy\", and Skarbek became \"Christine Granville\", a name she used for the rest of her life.  She also shaved seven years off her age. Her passport gave her birth date as 1915. A British Embassy driver smuggled Skarbek out of Hungary and into Yugoslavia in the trunk of O'Malley's Chrysler.  Kowerski, a.k.a. Kennedy, drove his Opel across the border. The couple reunited in Yugoslavia and O'Malley joined them later in Belgrade, where they enjoyed a few days of \"drinking champagne in Belgrade's nightclubs and belly-dancing bars.\"  In late February, Skarbek and Kowerski continued their journey in the Opel, first to Sofia, Bulgaria. Sofia's best hotel \"was full of Nazis\". Skarbek and Kowerski called at the British Legation, meeting with air attach\u00e9 Aidan Crawley. The couple gave Crawley rolls of microfilm which they had received from a Polish intelligence organisation called the \"Musketeers\". The microfilm contained photos of a German military buildup near the border with the Soviet Union, indicating that a German invasion of the Soviet Union was being planned. The microfilm was sent to Prime Minister Winston Churchill, in London, who could scarcely believe it; but by March, with information from other sources, the Prime Minister was persuaded that Skarbek and Kowerski's intelligence was accurate. The Germans invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941."]}, {"page": "List of ambassadors of the United Kingdom to Mexico", "response": ["*1937\u20131938: Owen O'MalleyO'MALLEY, Sir Owen St Clair, Who Was Who, A & C Black, 1920\u20132008; online edn, Oxford University Press, Dec 2012"]}, {"page": "Remilitarization of the Rhineland", "response": ["The British Foreign Office for its part expressed a great deal of frustration over Hitler's action in unilaterally taking what London had proposed to negotiate.  As a Foreign Office memo complained: \"Hitler has deprived us of the possibility of making to him a concession which might otherwise have been a useful bargaining counter in our hands in the general negotiations with Germany which we had it in contemplation to initiate\".Medlicott, W.N. Britain and Germany Athlone Press: London, United Kingdom, 1969 page 24. The Rhineland crisis completed the estrangement between Eden who believed that Hitler's proposals in his speech of 7 March were the grounds for a \"general settlement\" with Germany, and Vansittart who argued that Hitler was negotiating in bad faith.Roi, pp. 128\u2013129. Eden and Vansittart had already clashed during the Abyssinia Crisis with Eden supporting sanctions against Italy while Vansittart wanted Italy as an ally against Germany. Vansittart argued that there was no prospect of a \"general settlement\" with Hitler, and the best that could be done was to strengthen ties with the French in order to confront Germany.Roi, pp. 128\u2013130. The Germanophobe Vansittart had always hated the Germans, and especially disliked the Nazis, whom he saw as a menace to civilization. Vansittart had supported Eden's efforts to defuse the Rhineland crisis as British rearmament had only just began, but being an intense Francophile Vansittart urged the government to use the crisis as a chance to begin forming a military alliance with France against Germany. By the spring of 1936, Vansittart had become convinced that a \"general settlement\" with Germany was not possible, and Hitler was seeking the conquest of the world. A Foreign Office official Owen O'Malley suggested that Britain give Germany a \"free hand in the East\" (i.e. accept the German conquest of all Eastern Europe) in exchange for a German promise to accept the status quo in Western Europe.Roi, p. 130. Vansittart wrote in response that Hitler was seeking world conquest, and that to allow Germany to conquer all of Eastern Europe would give the Reich sufficient raw materials to make Germany immune to a British blockade, which would then allow the Germans to overrun Western Europe. Vansittart commented that to allow Germany to conquer Eastern Europe would \"lead to the disappearance of liberty and democracy in Europe\". By contrast, Eden saw British interests as confined only to Western Europe, and did not share Vansittart's beliefs about what Hitler's ultimate intentions might be. Nor did Eden, the rest of the Cabinet or the majority of the British people share Vansittart's conviction that Britain could not afford to be indifferent about Eastern Europe."]}, {"page": "Katyn massacre", "response": ["According to the Polish diplomat Edward Bernard Raczy\u0144ski, Raczy\u0144ski and General Sikorski met privately with Churchill and Alexander Cadogan on 15 April 1943, and told them the Poles had proof the Soviets were responsible for the massacre. Raczy\u0144ski reports Churchill, \"without committing himself, showed by his manner that he had no doubt of it\". Churchill said \"The Bolsheviks can be very cruel\". On 17 April 1943 the Polish government issued a statement on this issue, asking for a Red Cross investigation, which was rejected by Stalin, who used the fact that Germans also requested such an investigation as a \"proof\" of Polish-German conspiracy, and which led to a deterioration of Polish-Soviet relations. Shortly afterward, however, on 24 April 1943, the British government successfully pressured the Poles to withdraw the request for a Red Cross investigation, and Churchill assured the Soviets: \"We shall certainly oppose vigorously any 'investigation' by the International Red Cross or any other body in any territory under German authority. Such an investigation would be a fraud and its conclusions reached by terrorism\". Unofficial or classified UK documents concluded Soviet guilt was a \"near certainty\", but the alliance with the Soviets was deemed to be more important than moral issues; thus the official version supported the Soviets, up to censoring any contradictory accounts. Churchill asked Owen O'Malley to investigate the issue, but in a note to the Foreign Secretary he noted: \"All this is merely to ascertain the facts, because we should none of us ever speak a word about it.\" O'Malley pointed out several inconsistencies and near impossibilities in the Soviet version. Later, Churchill sent a copy of the report to Roosevelt on 13 August 1943. The report deconstructed the Soviet account of the massacre and alluded to the political consequences within a strongly moral framework but recognized there was no viable alternative to the existing policy. No comment by Roosevelt on the O'Malley report has been found. Churchill's own post-war account of the Katyn affair gives little further insight. In his memoirs, he refers to the 1944 Soviet inquiry into the massacre, which found the Germans responsible, and adds, \"belief seems an act of faith\"."]}, {"page": "O'Malley (surname)", "response": ["* Sir Owen O'Malley (1887\u20131974), British diplomat"]}, {"page": "Henry Chilton", "response": ["Soon after the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936, several embassies in Madrid, including the British, evacuated to Hendaye, France, on the border with Spain.Hendaye Now Center For Envoys To Spain, The New York Times, 2 August 1936 \"Chilton was a blatant admirer of the nationalists and preferred to stay in Hendaye rather than return to Madrid\"Beevor, Antony, The Battle for Spain, The Spanish Civil War, 1936-1939, Hachette, 2012 while it was still under Republican control.
