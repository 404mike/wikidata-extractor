He signed a full contract with Carlisle at the end of this loan deal but was relegated with Carlisle to the Conference National in his first season but managed to secure back-to-back promotions to see Carlisle playing their  football in League One in 2006. Arnison played more than 100 league and cup games for Carlisle signing new contract extensions at the end of the 2004\u201305 and 2005\u201306 seasons. Just five months later, Arnison signed a further 12-month contract extension, keeping him at Carlisle until June 2008. He made the right back position his own, but he has competition at the right back position with David Raven joining Carlisle United. Arnison started in Carlisle's 2\u20131 first leg play-off victory over Leeds United on 12 May 2008. But he missed their second leg defeat three days later, and on 16 May 2008, Arnison was one of three players to be released by manager John Ward."]}, {"page": "Liverpool F.C.

He scored a penalty during the final day of the season against Dundee F.C. in a battle for seventh place after Liam Polworth got brought down in the box. He scored the resulting penalty it was the fourth goal it was his also his first goal since November 2013 the game ended 4-0 a result that secured 7th place in The SPFL. Another reason fans knew it was a special moment as Foran stated 24 hours before that he would like regular first team football if he were to continue being a football player and felt he would not get that at Inverness. Leading to speculation that he would leave along with David Raven who was nearing the end of his contract. Raven had fallen out with manager John Hughes. It did turn out to be his final goal not just for Inverness Caledonian Thistle but his last goal as a player. However, even though Foran took the penalty, the crowd were calling for him to let David Raven take it, due to him becoming a club hero because of his goal that sent Inverness into the Scottish Cup final the previous year, in the end Foran took the penalty and Raven stayed at the club, while manager at the time, John Hughes, left the club after a fall out, due to the lack of star players staying at the club, with Richie taking the reins the next week."]}, {"page": "2006\u201307 Liverpool F.C. season", "response": ["| David Raven"]}, {"page": "Exodus Geohaghon", "response": ["He joined Rotherham United on a one-month loan deal for August 2010. The loan was extended to three months after he became a key part of Ronnie Moore's back four. In November of that year Geohaghon joined Shrewsbury Town on loan until January, initially to help solve injury troubles to the team's key defenders Ian Sharps and David Raven. The deal was made just hours before kick-off against local rivals Crewe Alexandra. His loan spell ended prematurely, as after only three starts he picked up a knee injury that kept him in the treatment room for two months. In January 2011, Jim Gannon was appointed as Port Vale manager, and he immediately brought Geohaghon to Vale Park on loan until the end of the season. Over the course of just four victories in twelve consecutive games with Geohaghon as a holding midfielder, both he and Gannon became highly unpopular figures with some sections of the Vale support. This culminated in ugly scenes on 19 March, as Geohaghon confronted his detractors following a 3\u20131 defeat at Accrington Stanley's Crown Ground, with his manager leaving the stadium in secret for his own safety. Though Gannon was unpopular with players and fans, fan favourites and star players Gary Roberts and Marc Richards did stand by Geohaghon, calling the abuse he received \"unfair... terrible... not acceptable\" and \"harsh\". Two days later Gannon was sacked. Meanwhile, Geohaghon sought legal advice and claimed his scuffle with supporters came about after he reacted to racial abuse levelled at him by a number of fans. Unable to return to Peterborough by the terms of his loan, and unwilling to return to Vale Park, Geohaghon instead remained at his Birmingham home whilst the Football Association's investigation of racial abuse continued. The FA found that there was racist chanting from at least one Vale supporter."]}, {"page": "Aaron Doran", "response": ["The following season, 2012\u201313, Doran set up a goal for Nick Ross in the opening game of the season in a 2\u20132 draw against St Mirren.

Doran was highly praised by manager Terry Butcher after the 3\u20130 defeat of Rangers on Halloween 2012, in the 2012\u201313 League Cup quarter-finals. \"If you give Aaron Doran space he'll utilise it, he'll expose teams and expose space, he's a good passer and a good supplier. He doesn't score a lot but what he does do is create a lot.\" After a good November, which included wins against Kilmarnock, Celtic and Aberdeen, Doran, along with Butcher and McKay, won the SPL Monthly awards. In mid-December, Doran announced he wanted to stay at the club and that he hoped Butcher would offer him a new contract. In April, Butcher announced that Doran was close to signing a new contract, along with his colleague, David Raven.
