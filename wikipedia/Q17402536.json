At the time, Boler described her choice as representing that year's nostalgic and period-costume-influenced trends.

Boler's choice of a Catherine Rayner gown, Emma Hope shoes, and a man's cream wool and silk damask ensemble with embroidered waistcoat by Tom Gilbey twenty years later, was only the second time that bridal wear had been chosen for the award.
