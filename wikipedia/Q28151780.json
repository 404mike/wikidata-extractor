From 1871 he was an apprentice with Messrs Hopkins, Gilkes and Co., locomotive builders in Middlesbrough, then in Yorkshire. He then worked for the Teesside Bridge and Engineering Company (later part of Dorman Long) for several years.In 1880 he moved to be Chief Assistant to Sir Charles Fox of Sir Charles Fox & Sons (later Freeman Fox & Partners; today part of Hyder Consulting). There he was involved in a number of civil engineering projects such as the Mersey Tunnel, the Liverpool Overhead Railway and the extension of the Great Central Railway to London. For the overhead railway he designed and patented a new design of steel flooring capable of carrying heavy loads. Jointly with Edmund Wragge he was awarded a Telford Medal in 1900 for their paper entitled The Metropolitan Terminus of the Great Central Railway. He was made a partner in the company in 1901.His chief work thereafter was the construction of railways in Africa and South America, of which his most notable achievement was the design of the Victoria Falls Bridge. On this project he was assisted in the stress calculations by Ralph Freeman, who went on to design the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The location of the railway bridge was chosen by Cecil Rhodes to give rail passengers a clear view of the falls and presented a number of engineering challenges such as the need for a design and construction technique which avoided the use of scaffolding and the need for the structure to be spray resistant. The final solution was the 150 metre trussed steel arch which stands today. He was awarded the George Stephenson Gold Medal by the Institute of Civil Engineers for his account of the design and construction of the bridge.\nHe died in Richmond, Surrey in 1917 and was buried in Richmond Cemetery. He had married Annie Jean, the daughter of Thomas Addyman of Harrogate and had an only daughter.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Victoria Falls Bridge", "response": ["The bridge was the brainchild of Cecil Rhodes, part of his grand and unfulfilled Cape to Cairo railway scheme, even though he never visited the falls and died before construction of the bridge began. Rhodes is recorded as instructing the engineers to \"build the bridge across the Zambezi where the trains, as they pass, will catch the spray of the Falls\". It was designed by George Andrew Hobson of consultants Sir Douglas Fox and Partners, assisted by the stress calculations of Ralph Freeman, who was later the principal designer of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The main central arch is a parabolic curve.
