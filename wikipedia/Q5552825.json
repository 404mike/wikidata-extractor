Then, in 2001, Dodds challenged sitting Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) MP Cecil Walker, despite the danger of losing the mixed constituency to an Irish nationalist. Dodds won just over 40% of the overall vote and with that a 6,387 majority over Sinn F\u00e9in's Gerry Kelly, with the incumbent Walker being pushed into fourth place."]}, {"page": "List of members of the 2nd Northern Ireland Assembly", "response": ["|Gerry Kelly", "|Gerry Kelly"]}, {"page": "Northern Ireland Policing Board", "response": ["*Gerry Kelly MLA"]}, {"page": "Holy Cross dispute", "response": ["The morning blockade continued on Thursday 21 June.

Three Protestant families left their homes in Ardoyne Avenue, saying they were afraid of a nationalist attack. During the evening and night there were serious disturbances in the area around the school. Loyalists fired ten shots, and threw six blast bombs and 46 petrol bombs at police lines. Two Catholic homes were attacked with pipe bombs, and a child was thrown against a wall by one of the blasts.\"Violence engulfs friendly schools\". The Guardian, 22 June 2001.

Some of the protesters shouted \"Fenian scum\" at the parents. In London, Richard Haass, the United States Special Envoy for Northern Ireland, discussed the protest with John Reid. Senior Sinn F\u00e9in member Gerry Kelly introduced a private members' motion in the Northern Ireland Assembly, proposing that \"the Assembly supports the right to education of children attending the Holy Cross Primary School in north Belfast\". Unionist members proposed an amendment to the motion to make it apply to all schools in the area. The Assembly passed the amended motion."]}]}}
