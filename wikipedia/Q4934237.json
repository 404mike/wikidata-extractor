He was originally a left back and made his debut on 27 December 1921 against Cardiff City at Ninian Park; Arsenal lost 3\u20134 in a tightly fought game. Turnbull only played occasionally at this stage, making only five appearances in the 1921\u201322 season.\nThe following season he played a little more regularly, featuring in eight of the Gunners' first fifteen matches. At this point in time, mid-November, Arsenal were bottom of the table, having only won four matches. With Arsenal's regular centre forward Henry White out of form and no money available to buy a replacement, Arsenal manager Leslie Knighton switched Turnbull from defence to attack, and the gamble paid off; Turnbull scored 21 league goals that season, including two four-goal hauls against Bolton Wanderers and Blackpool. Turnbull's goals saved Arsenal from relegation and they eventually finished a comfortable 11th. An additional goal in the FA Cup against Liverpool brought Turnbull's total for the season to 22, which was then a top-flight record for an Arsenal player.\nHowever, his blistering form could not last, and he only scored six goals in 1923\u201324. The arrival of Harry Woods forced Turnbull out of the side altogether and he was sold to Charlton Athletic in November 1924; in all he had scored 28 goals in 66 matches for Arsenal. After just three months at The Valley, he was sold on to Chelsea, where he rediscovered his form: in less than three seasons he scored 58 goals in 87 first-team games.After leaving Chelsea in 1928 he had brief spells at Clapton Orient, Southend United and Crystal Palace. After retiring, he stayed on with Palace as a trainer, until his death in 1946 aged 52.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Turnbull (surname)", "response": ["* Bob Turnbull (1894\u20131946), Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "Henry White (footballer, born 1895)", "response": ["White soon made a name for himself as a reasonably prolific striker, and he was Arsenal's top scorer in 1919\u201320 with fifteen league goals, as the Gunners finished 10th in their first season back at the top; he impressed enough to play in a trial for England, although ultimately he never won a cap. After a quiet season in 1920\u201321 (scoring just 10 times), White scored 19 goals the following season, making him again Arsenal's top scorer, even though the club's poor defence meant they only finished 17th. However, in 1922\u201323 he (and Arsenal) suffered a slump in form and after being replaced by converted full back Bob Turnbull in November 1922, he was sold to Blackpool in March 1923. In all he played 109 games for Arsenal, scoring 45 goals."]}, {"page": "1927 FA Cup Final", "response": ["In the fifth round, Cardiff were drawn away against Bolton Wanderers, the reigning FA Cup champions. In front of a crowd of 49,465 at Bolton's ground Burnden Park, Cardiff won by two goals to nil, the scorers being Ferguson and Davies. Following this round, Cardiff and Arsenal were the only remaining teams from the Football League First Division. After an initial goalless draw in the following round against Second Division Chelsea on 5 March, the two sides met again at Ninian Park in a replay five days later. Sam Irving put the Welsh team ahead after nine minutes, before Davies added a second after 21 minutes. Chelsea were awarded a penalty, but the shot by Andrew Wilson was saved by Farquharson. The goalkeeper had developed a reputation for saving penalty kicks by charging from his goalline as the shot was taken; this save from Wilson ultimately led to a rule change, prohibiting goalkeepers from rushing forward during a penalty. Chelsea scored twice in quick succession, Albert Thain with the first a minute before half-time but Bob Turnbull equalised, four minutes into the second half. Cardiff won through a penalty of their own; Harry Wilding handled the ball and Ferguson converted the penalty."]}, {"page": "List of Chelsea F.C. seasons", "response": ["|rowspan=2|Bob Turnbull"]}, {"page": "Arsenal F.C.\u2013Chelsea F.C. rivalry", "response": ["* Bob Turnbull "]}, {"page": "Robert Turnbull", "response": ["* Bob Turnbull (1894\u20131946), Scottish footballer"]}]}}
