Second Division Bury provided the opposition in the fourth round. Tommy Johnson scored twice for Everton in the opening half-hour.

In the second half Dean added a third goal from a rebounded Cliff Britton free-kick, and Bury scored a late consolation goal. Everton were drawn to play Leeds United at home in the fifth round. Leeds' strong league form meant Everton entered the match as slight underdogs despite home advantage.
