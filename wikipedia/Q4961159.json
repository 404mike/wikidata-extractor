He had brief stays with Chester and Gateshead, before signing with Tamworth in August 2014. He joined Harrogate Town in June 2015 and went on to be named as both the club's Player of the Year and in the National League North Team of the Year for the 2015\u201316 season. He signed with AFC Fylde in May 2016, who had beaten Harrogate in the play-offs, and helped his new club to win promotion as champions of the National League North for the 2016\u201317 campaign. He remained in the National League North however, joining Alfreton Town in August 2017, before making a return to the Football League after being signed to Port Vale in May 2018.

The team had an indifferent start to the season, with the highlight being a 1\u20130 victory at local rivals Crewe Alexandra on 22 September. Having seen their team pick up just seven points from an available 27 in November and December, a section of travelling supporters booed and heckled Aspin during a 1\u20131 draw at Lincoln City on New Year's Day; Aspin reacted badly to the fan's \"lack of respect\" towards him and considered quitting his role, but said that he decided to stay because he had the support of the players and chairman Norman Smurthwaite. However he tendered his resignation on 30 January, stating that \"I am very proud of the job we did in keeping the club in League Two and we leave the club in a better place on and off the pitch.

Aspin stated that Brown's experience would help with organising the Vale's young defenders on the pitch. He quickly followed this by bringing in 30-year-old Carlisle United midfielder Luke Joyce on a two-year contract and 24-year-old Alfreton Town winger Brendon Daniels on a six-month contract, describing Joyce as \"vastly experienced\" and Daniels as \"a local lad who is desperate to prove himself\". Next to arrive were centre-backs Leon Legge and Connell Rawlinson, arriving on free transfers after leaving Cambridge United and The New Saints respectively. Aspin said that he hoped the experience of Legge would aid the development of young centre-half Nathan Smith. His sixth signing was central midfielder Manny Oyeleke, who had just left National League side Aldershot Town after picking up their Player of the Year award. After a wait of some weeks, the seventh incoming player was revealed to be attacker Louis Dodds, who joined on a season-long loan from relegated Chesterfield; he had previously played for the Vale from 2008 to 2016. Aspin said that Dodds had been keen on a return to Vale Park and \"he has cost us next to nothing really\". Vale then acquired the services of Peterborough United striker Ricky Miller after paying an undisclosed fee; 29-year-old Miller had scored a remarkable goal tally in the National League but had thus far failed to establish himself in the Football League in a career hindered by legal troubles.
