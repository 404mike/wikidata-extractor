He was born at Foots Cray in Kent and died at Broadstairs, also in Kent. He was buried at Foots Cray alongside his wife.One of a series of cricketing brothers, the most prolific of whom was Charles Harenc, Edward Harenc played in a single match for a Gentlemen of Kent side in 1837 and then in three matches while at Cambridge University, the last of which (and the only one in 1841) was the University Match against Oxford University. Harenc opened the innings for Cambridge in the first innings, and came in at first wicket down in the second, but his scores were 0 and 2 in a very tight game won by Cambridge by only eight runs.", "link_mentions": {}}}
