He was a postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Toronto before taking up a Lectureship at the University of Dundee in 1990 and moving to a Readership at the University of Strathclyde in 1996. He was made Professor in 1999 and awarded the \"1966 Chair of Numerical Analysis\" in 2011. He moved to the University of Edinburgh in April 2019.\nHigham's main area of research is stochastic computation, with applications in data science, deep learning,  network science and computational biology.\nHe held a Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award (2012\u20132017) and is a Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) Fellow and Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He won the 2005 SIAM Germund Dahlquist Prize (2005). In 2020 he was awarded a Shephard Prize from the London Mathematical Society He held an Established Career Fellowship from the EPSRC/URKI Digital Economy programme and is institutional lead on the EPSRC Mathematical Sciences Programme Grant Inference, Computation and Numerics for Insights into Cities (ICONIC). He is a member of Sub-panel 10, Mathematical Sciences, for the 2021 Research Excellence Framework (REF 2021).\nHigham has authored five books: \n\nNumerical Methods for Ordinary Differential Equations: Initial Value Problems (2010, with D.
