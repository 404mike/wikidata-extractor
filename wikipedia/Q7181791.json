His best known works, co-written with his wife, June Colclough (1941 \u2013 12 October 2004), are \"Song for Ireland\" and \"The Call and the Answer\".\nJune and Phil Colclough both came from North Staffordshire, England, and both had careers in education.  Phil had been a navigator in the Merchant Navy, which provided source material for some of his songs.  The Colcloughs founded the first folk music club in Stoke-on-Trent in 1960.\n\nIn 1966, they moved to London, where they were members of the Critics Group led by Ewan MacColl and Peggy Seeger; they eventually left the group due to bitter disputes stemming from MacColl's \"authoritarian tendencies\".In the 1970s, the Colcloughs returned to North Staffordshire, where they produced a folk music radio program for BBC Radio Stoke.\n\"Song for Ireland\" was inspired by a trip the Colcloughs took to the Dingle Peninsula.  Described as a \"modern classic\", it has been recorded by numerous artists, including Dick Gaughan, Luke Kelly, Mary Black, Ralph McTell, Celtic Spirit, The Dubliners, Brendan Hayes and Damien Leith.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Critics Group", "response": ["Members of the group at various times included Frankie Armstrong, Bob Blair, Brian Byrne (UK), Helen Campbell (UK), Jim Carroll (UK), Phil Colclough, Aldwyn Cooper, Ted Culver, John Faulkner, Richard Humm, Allen Ives, Donneil Kennedy, Sandra Kerr, Paul Lenihan, Pat Mackenzie, Jim O'Connor, Maggie O'Murphy, Charles Parker, Brian Pearson, Michael Rosen, Buff Rosenthal, Susanna Steele, Denis Turner, Jack Warshaw, Terry Yarnell and others who joined for individual Festival of Fools shows."]}, {"page": "Prodigal Sons", "response": ["# \"Song for Ireland\" (Phil Colclough)"]}, {"page": "Live in Carr\u00e9", "response": ["#\"Song for Ireland\" (Phil Colclough)"]}, {"page": "30 Years A-Greying", "response": ["# \"The Call and the Answer\" (Phil Colclough)"]}, {"page": "Colclough", "response": ["*Phil Colclough (born 1940), English folk singer and songwriter"]}, {"page": "June Colclough", "response": ["#REDIRECT Phil Colclough"]}, {"page": "Song for Ireland", "response": ["#REDIRECT Phil Colclough"]}, {"page": "Right Side Up", "response": ["# \"Song for Ireland\" (additional track, learnt by McTell from the version by Dick Gaughan, written by Phil Colclough originally released in 1982, added to re-release of the album)"]}, {"page": "World of Music (Mary O'Hara album)", "response": ["#\"A song for Ireland\" (Phil Colclough)"]}, {"page": "Handful of Earth", "response": ["\"Song for Ireland\" was written by the Englishman Phil Colclough, a friend of Gaughan's, and has since become a standard with Irish bar bands. \"Workers' Song\" was written by Ed Pickford with a self-explanatory message, while Gaughan's reworking of the traditional song \"Both Sides of the Tweed\", which was written to attack the Acts of Union 1707, sees Gaughan assume the character of someone who acknowledges the human spirit will overcome difficulty and struggle.
