It was excavated in 1858 by James Dyce Nicol, Charles Dalrymple, James Nicolson, Captain James Burnett, the Reverend Harry Stuart and Alexander Thomson. The cairn had already been plundered and they discovered some burnt bone fragments and pottery sherds. In the late nineteenth century the circle was visited by among others William Collings Lukis, Christian Maclagan, Robert Angus Smith, William Tomkin and Frederick Coles. Alexander Keiller noted in 1934 that there was an atypical number of stones and that their heights alternated. Alexander Thom surveyed the site in 1955 and Clive Ruggles checked for archaeoastrological alignments in 1981. A geological survey was carried out in 2006."]}]}}
