While he achieved fame as a conservationist during his life, after his death the revelation that he was not Indigenous, along with other autobiographical fabrications, negatively affected his reputation.\nBelaney rose to prominence as a notable author and lecturer, primarily on environmental issues. In working with the National Parks Branch, Grey Owl became the subject of many films, and was established as the \"'caretaker of park animals' at Riding Mountain National Park in Manitoba\" in 1931. Together with his numerous articles, books, films and lectures, his views on conservation reached audiences beyond the borders of Canada. His conservation views largely focused on humans' negative impact on nature through their commodification of nature's resources for profits, and a need for humans to develop a respect for the natural world.Recognition of Belaney has included biographies, a historic plaque at his birthplace, and a 1999 biopic about his life by the director Richard Attenborough.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 13", "response": ["*1938 \u2013 Grey Owl, English-Canadian environmentalist and author (b. 1888)"]}, {"page": "Beaver", "response": ["Beavers have historically been kept in captivity for entertainment, fur farming and conservation breeding.

During her speech to the assembled authors, Montgomery spoke of hearing an \"owl's laughter\" in Leaskdale, causing Grey Owl to jump up and interrupt her, saying: \"You are the first white person I have ever met who has heard an owl's laughter. I thought nobody but Indians ever heard it. We hear it often because we are a silent race. My full name is Laughing Grey Owl.\" Grey Owl's remark made the front page of The Toronto Mail and Empire newspaper the next day.  Montgomery described Grey Owl in her diary: \"Grey Owl was looking quite the Indian of romance, with his long black braids of hair, his feather headdress and a genuine scalping knife -- at least he told us it was genuine.\" Montgomery liked Grey Owl's speech the same evening stating Canada's \"greatest asset is her forest lands\" saying that most Canadians were too proud of \"skyscrapers on Yonge Street\" rather than the \"natural resources we are destroying as fast as we can\". After Grey Owl's death in 1938, and the revelation that the supposed Ojibwe was actually the Englishman Archie Belaney, Montgomery stated that though Belaney lied about being an Ojibwe his concern for the environment, nature, and animals were real; and for this reason Grey Owl's message was worth cherishing.

Belaney, who adopted the name Grey Owl when he took upon a First Nations identity as an adult, was a writer and became one of Canada's first conservationists. On April 17, 1931, Grey Owl arrived with his two beavers at a secluded lake several kilometres north of Wasagaming which had been selected by the park staff. He spent six months living in a cabin in Riding Mountain National park studying and working with wildlife, including two beavers named Jelly Roll and Rawhide. His main goal in the park was to re-establish beaver colonies in areas where they were exterminated. Riding Mountain National Park was found to be an unsuitable habitat for the beavers, as a summer drought resulted in the lake water level sinking, and becoming stagnant. Both the beavers and Belaney were unhappy with the situation, causing Belaney to search, with the support of the Dominion Parks Branch, for better living conditions. He later relocated to Prince Albert National Park, where there was a greater sized waterway and a lower risk of the lakes freezing to the bottom in the winter. Despite his eventual departure, the park now has an abundant beaver population partially because of his efforts.
