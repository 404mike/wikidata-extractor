Historian Keith Jeffery noted that most of the opposition came from people whose relatives were in the British Army and who depended on their army allowances.Kennedy, p. 286 Those most openly hostile to the Volunteers were the \"separation women\" (so-called because they were paid \"separation money\" by the British government), whose husbands and sons were fighting in the British Army in the First World War. There was also hostility from unionists.Foy and Barton, pp. 203\u2013209 Supporters of the Irish Parliamentary Party also felt the rebellion was a betrayal of their party.\"The loyalists spoke with an air of contempt, 'the troops will settle the matter in an hour or two, these pro-Germans will run away...' The Redmondites were more bitter, 'I hope they'll all be hanged' ... 'Shooting's too good for them. Trying to stir up trouble for us all.'\" Ernie O'Malley, On Another Man's Wound, p. 60. When occupying positions in the South Dublin Union and Jacob's factory, the rebels got involved in physical confrontations with civilians who tried to tear down the rebel barricades and prevent them taking over buildings. The Volunteers shot and clubbed a number of civilians who assaulted them or tried to dismantle their barricades.Fearghal McGarry, The Rising: Ireland Easter 1916, p. 143"]}, {"page": "Grigori Rasputin", "response": ["However, historians do not consider this theory credible. According to Douglas Smith, \"there is no convincing evidence that places any British agents at the murder scene\". Historian Keith Jeffery states that if British intelligence agents had been involved, \"I would have expected to find some trace of that\" in the SIS archives, but no such evidence exists."]}, {"page": "Sir Henry Wilson, 1st Baronet", "response": ["Wilson spoke with an Irish accent and at times regarded himself as British, Irish or an Ulsterman. Like many Anglo-Irish or Scots of his era, he often referred to Britain as \"England.\" His biographer Keith Jeffery suggests that he may well, like many Anglo-Irish, have played up his \"Irishness\" in England and regarded himself as more \"Anglo-\" while in Ireland, and may well also have agreed with his brother Jemmy's view that Ireland was not \"homogenous\" enough to be \"a Nation.\"Jeffery 2006, pp. viii, 5\u201310. Wilson was a devout member of the Church of Ireland, and on occasion attend Roman Catholic services, but disliked \"Romish\" ritual, especially when practised by Anglican clergymen. He enjoyed good personal relations with Catholics, although there are unsubstantiated claims that he disliked George MacDonogh, and tried to block the promotion of William Hickie, as both men were Catholics.", "After the defeat, Wilson was once again scornful of Buller's lack of progress and of his predictions that he would be in Ladysmith by 5 February. That month saw the Light Brigade take the hill at Vaal Krantz (6 February) before being withdrawn by Buller the following evening.Keith Jeffery gives this as 7 March, clearly an error. Wilson recorded that Buller was right as he did not have the 3:1 numerical superiority needed to storm entrenched positions, but by 20 February Wilson was again expressing his frustration at Buller's slowness in exploiting further recent victories. Leo Amery later told a malicious story that Wilson had suggested gathering the brigade majors together to arrest their commanding general, although Wilson in fact seems to have thought highly of Lyttelton at this time. He was also highly critical of Fitzroy Hart (\"perfect disgrace \u2026 quite mad & incapable under fire\"), commanding general of the Irish Brigade, for attacking Inniskilling Hill in close order on 24 February (see Battle of the Tugela Heights), and, on the same day, leaving the Durham Light Infantry (part of the Light Brigade) exposed to attack (Wilson visited the position, and they were withdrawn on 27 February after Wilson lobbied Lyttelton and Warren), and for leaving Wilson to organise a defence against a Boer night attack on Light Brigade HQ after refusing Light Brigade requests to post pickets. The Light Brigade finally took Inniskilling Hill on 27 February and Ladysmith was relieved the following day, allowing Wilson to meet his old friend Rawlinson, who had been besieged there, again.Jeffery 2006, pp. 33\u20136.", "Edmonds later (to Liddell Hart in 1937 and in his own unpublished memoirs) told an exaggerated version of these events, that Wilson had stitched up the job for himself whilst acting as Director of Staff Duties, by recommending May (\"a really stupid Irishman\") for the job and placing himself as the second recommendation. Tim Travers (in The Killing Ground, 1987) used this story to help paint a picture of a prewar Army highly dependent on patronage for senior appointments. John Hussey, in his research into the matter, described Wilson's appointment as \"a collegiate decision about a difficult but suitable man\" and dismisses Edmonds' story as \"worthless as evidence to prove anything about the structural defects of the old Army\". Historian Keith Jeffery argues that Travers' argument is not entirely without substance \u2013 even if he is misinformed about this particular incident \u2013 and that Wilson's career took place at \"a transitional period\" in which the Army was becoming more professionalised, so that Lyttelton was not able to use patronage to appoint May, his preferred candidate.Jeffery 2006, pp. 66\u20137.", "Wilson had argued as far back as a memo to Arnold-Forster in May 1905 that a \"School of Thought\" was needed. In his start-of-year speeches to students, he stressed the need for administrative knowledge (\"the drudgery of staffwork\"), physical fitness (in his mid-forties, Wilson was still able to keep up with much younger officers at sport), imagination, \"sound judgement of men & affairs\" and \"constant reading & reflexion on the campaigns of the great masters\". Brian Bond argued (in The Victorian Army and the Staff College) that Wilson's \"School of Thought\" meant not just common training for staff officers but also espousal of conscription and the military commitment to send a BEF to France in the event of war. Keith Jeffery argues that this is a misunderstanding by Bond: there is no evidence in Wilson's writings to confirm that he meant the phrase in that way, although his political views were shared by many officers.Jeffery 2006, pp. 68\u201372.", "Brock Millman argues that the threat to stand for Parliament, where he could have intrigued as a Unionist along with his friends such as Bonar Law, Leo Amery and Colonel Lord Percy, ADC to the King, was blackmail to get a military job out of Lloyd George.Millman 1995, p. 475 Keith Jeffery rejects Millman's approach, arguing that Wilson would have been no threat as a new MP but as a military adviser was a useful rival to Robertson, whom by July 1917 Viscount French (C-in-C Home Forces) was telling Wilson Lloyd George wanted to remove.Jeffery 2006, pp. 195\u20139. However, Robertson told Wilson directly in a meeting on 4 July that there was simply no job available for him.Millman 1995, p. 474 Moreover, Wilson was surprised to learn that if he entered the House of Commons he would lose his army half pay.Millman 1995, p. 476", "Wilson wanted to concentrate troops in Britain, Ireland, India and Egypt \u2013 rather than what he saw as excessive commitments to the Rhine and in Mesopotamia, Persia and Palestine, later writing (11 August 1921) that interfering in other countries followed by having to make \"peace\" was \"like buggery: once you take to it, you cannot stop\". However, Keith Jeffery argues that he failed to realise that the granting of self-government to Ireland and Egypt was also necessary, such concession keeping Egypt (like Iraq to a certain extent) pro-British for another generation.Jeffery 2006, pp. 234, 251\u20133.", "Stories later circulated that the first shot missed, but rather than taking shelter in the house, he drew his sword and advanced on his attackers, who were able to shoot and kill him. These stories often stressed that he had died a martyr. His housemaid testified that she found his drawn sword lying by his side.Jeffery 2006, pp. 285\u20136. These details do not feature in the three witness accounts quoted by Keith Jeffery (Reginald Dunne's account smuggled out of prison, or the inquest testimonies of one of two road menders working nearby and of the taxi driver who had just dropped Wilson off). One of the road mender's accounts, as published in the Daily Mail, mentions Wilson turning on his attackers with the words \"you cowardly swine!\" but Jeffery suggests this was an embellishment by the newspaper.", "Both Archibald Wavell in the 1930s and Sir John Dill as CIGS in 1941 (who commented that he no longer condemned Wilson \"so heartily as one used to\") commented that Wilson had illustrated that a general must be able to work effectively with politicians, and his modern biographer Keith Jeffery comments that this, rather than Robertson's acrimonious insistence on military autonomy, has been the model since Wilson's time.Jeffery 2006, p. 293."]}, {"page": "Lees Knowles Lecture", "response": ["| 1998|| Prof. Keith Jeffery ||\u2018For the freedom of small nations\u2019: Ireland and the Great War "]}, {"page": "Society for Army Historical Research", "response": ["* 2006 Field Marshal Sir Henry Wilson: A Political Soldier, by Keith Jeffery."]}, {"page": "Keith Jeffrey", "response": ["#REDIRECT Keith Jeffery"]}, {"page": "Keith Jeffery (historian)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Keith Jeffery"]}, {"page": "2016 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Keith Jeffery, 64, historian."]}, {"page": "Deaths in February 2016", "response": ["*Keith Jeffery, 64, Northern Irish historian.Respected Irish historian Keith Jeffery dies aged 64"]}, {"page": "Jeffery (name)", "response": ["* Keith Jeffery (1952\u20132016), Northern Irish historian"]}]}}
