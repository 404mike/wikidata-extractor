He was known for his confiscation of M\u0101ori land rights, his contributions to the education system (such as establishing the University of New Zealand), and his work to increase New Zealand's autonomy from Britain. He has been described as determined and intelligent, but also as bitter and \"too fond\" of personal attacks.

Some of these people have held it on several occasions, with the record for maximum number of times being shared between William Fox and Harry Atkinson (both of whom served four times). The longest that anyone has served in the office is 13 years, a record set by Richard Seddon. The first holder of the office, Henry Sewell, led the country for the shortest total time; his only term lasted just 13 days. The shortest term belonged to Harry Atkinson, whose third term lasted only seven days, but Atkinson served longer in total than did Sewell. The youngest was Edward Stafford, who was appointed premier in 1856, at 37 years, 40 days old. The oldest was Walter Nash, who was 78 years old when he left office in 1960 (and 75 upon taking office in 1957).", "The first person to be formally appointed to a position of executive leadership was Henry Sewell, who formed a brief ministry in April 1856, at the beginning of the Second Parliament. Despite his formal leadership role, however, his only actual title was \"colonial secretary\", a position comparable to a minister of internal affairs. His successor, William Fox, was also given a formal leadership role, but was not colonial secretary. When Frederick Weld became the sixth person appointed to formal leadership, a substantive leadership title, \"premier\", appeared. Weld's successor, Edward Stafford, briefly changed the title to \"first minister\", but it was soon restored to premier during the second tenure of Fox. From that point, the term \"premier\" was used almost exclusively for the remainder of the 19th century. Nevertheless, in the Schedule of the Civil List of 1873, provision was made for the salary of the head of government, referred to as the \"Prime Minister\"."]}, {"page": "Wadham College, Oxford", "response": ["File:Retouched portrait of Sir William Fox.jpg|Sir William Fox, former Prime minister of New Zealand"]}, {"page": "Julius Vogel", "response": ["In the 1866 election, he was defeated by William Murison in the  electorate on Wednesday, 28 February.

Premier William Fox said the development heightened \"the probability of a combined attack on the settled districts in the neighbourhood of Auckland\" and both Houses of Parliament accepted government motions asking Major-General Sir Trevor Chute, commander of the British forces in New Zealand, to cancel orders for a planned withdrawal of the 18th Regiment, the sole remaining British regiment in New Zealand. Yet Binney has  speculated that history could well have turned had T\u0101whiao decided to join Te Kooti's campaign. In official correspondence between Auckland and London in 1869, Governor George Bowen advocated granting \"a separate principality\" for T\u0101whiao as a means of attaining peace, while the British government similarly urged the colonial government to \"cede the lands conquered by the Queen's troops\" and surrender \"the Queen's sovereignty\" in those areas, while recognising \"absolute dominion\" by the King within his borders. Premier Fox, who was desperately trying to cut military expenditure, strongly opposed proposals for M\u0101ori self-government under the M\u0101ori king, as urged by Bowen and former Chief Justice Sir William Martin, but the formation of a more robust pan-M\u0101ori alliance could have become a tipping point to create a system of separate M\u0101ori rule in their territory.", "thumb|right|Premier William FoxAt the end of December 1869 to the first week of January 1870 both Te Keepa and Topia and their combined force of 600 came close to capturing Te Kooti\u2014again with a fighting force of about 90 and 200 women and children\u2014in the upper Whanganui River near Taumarunui but were thwarted by floodwaters.

Tawhai resigned before hearings began, claiming his fellow commissioners were not impartial and had been the \"very men who had created the trouble on the West Coast\".

This exemplified by the establishment of M\u0101ori seats in parliament in 1867, and by Stafford's request for the governor to pardon \"rebel\" M\u0101ori chiefs. The sudden military successes of Te Kooti and Titokowaru caused many to claim that Stafford's attempts at reconciliation had been misjudged.
