Blackstone Press Limited. 1996. . p. 2. Glanville Williams said that the meaning of the word \"law\" depends on the context in which that word is used. He said that, for example, \"early customary law\" and \"municipal law\" were contexts where the word \"law\" had two different and irreconcilable meanings.Williams, Glanville. International Law and the Controversy Concerning the Meaning of the Word \"Law\". Revised version published in Laslett (Editor), Philosophy, Politics and Society (1956) p. 134 et seq. The original was published in (1945) 22 BYBIL 146. Thurman Arnold said that it is obvious that it is impossible to define the word \"law\" and that it is also equally obvious that the struggle to define that word should not ever be abandoned.Arnold, Thurman. The Symbols of Government. 1935. p. 36. It is possible to take the view that there is no need to define the word \"law\" (e.g. \"let's forget about generalities and get down to cases\").Baron Lloyd of Hampstead.
