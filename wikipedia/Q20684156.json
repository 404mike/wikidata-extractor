Baramki's archaeological research is unfortunately absent from this volume, and as such, Hamilton's analysis is exclusively art historical. Baramki's research on the archaeological aspects of the site, particularly the ceramics, was published in various preliminary reports and articles in the Quarterly of the Department of Antiquities in Palestine.Whitcomb and Taha 2013 Many of the finds from Baramki and Hamilton's excavations are now held in the Rockefeller Museum in Jerusalem.", "It is difficult to establish a secure historical framework for Hisham's Palace.
