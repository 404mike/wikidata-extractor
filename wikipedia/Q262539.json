Charles Walker, Conservative MP for Broxbourne, Chairman of the Procedure Committee and responsible for Speaker elections, stated that he had written a report about such an idea \"years ago\" and despite speaking with Hague and Michael Gove earlier that week, neither had told him of any such move. A visibly emotional Walker told the House, \"I have been played as a fool. When I go home tonight, I will look in the mirror and see an honourable fool looking back at me. I would much rather be an honourable fool, in this and any other matter, than a clever man.\" Walker received a standing ovation, mainly from the Labour benches, whilst the Government lost its parliamentary motion by 228 to 202 votes. During the debate the future Father of the House, Gerald Kaufman, denounced Hague, saying: \"Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that this grubby decision is what he personally will be remembered for? After a distinguished career in the House of Commons, both as a leader of a party and as a senior Cabinet Minister, he has now descended to squalor in the final days of the Parliament.\""]}, {"page": "Peter Bottomley", "response": ["In 2009, Bottomley was the vice-chairman of the All Party Parliamentary Flag Group.
