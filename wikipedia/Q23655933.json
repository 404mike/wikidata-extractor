According to Pavel Dolukhanov this proposal is supported by anthropological evidence which has found that Scythian skulls are similar to preceding findings from the Srubna culture, and distinct from those of the Central Asian Saka. Yet, according to J. P. Mallory, the archaeological evidence is poor, and the Andronovo culture and \"at least the eastern outliers of the Timber-grave culture\" may be identified as Indo-Iranian."]}, {"page": "Archaeology of Russia", "response": ["| Pavel Dolukhanov"]}]}}
