The Selling England by the Pound tour visited Europe and North America between September 1973 and May 1974. Their six shows in three days at The Roxy in Los Angeles were well received by audiences and critics. The success of the tour earned the group the \"Top Stage Band\" title by readers of NME. At its conclusion, Macphail resigned as their tour manager as he wished to pursue other interests. \"I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)\" was released as a UK single with \"Twilight Alehouse\", a non-album track recorded in 1972; it reached No. 21 following its release in February 1974.

Their only album with Wilson, ...Calling All Stations..., was released that September and became a top 10 worldwide hit, except for the U.S. where it reached No. 54 on the Billboard 200 album chart.

The group realised they were substantially in debt and needed better management, so recruited Tony Smith (no relation to Charisma boss Tony Stratton-Smith). In October 1973 a pair of dates in the tour were filmed by Charisma for a possible cinema release, but the plan was rejected by the band who felt the film was not up to standard. Instead, the band performed a five-song set in front of an invited audience at Shepperton Studios that was filmed and broadcast as Tony Stratton-Smith Presents Genesis in Concert. The group returned to the U.S. in December 1973 that included six shows in three nights at The Roxy in Los Angeles, and a performance of \"Watcher of the Skies\" and \"The Musical Box\" on the late night television show The Midnight Special.

However, the vocals were negatively received from Island management, leaving the group to write new material, at the suggestion of Island A&R man Richard Williams. With Collins tied up with other commitments, the band settled on a founding line-up of Jones, John Goodsall on guitar, Robin Lumley on keyboards and vocals, Pete Bonas on guitar, John Dillon on drums and percussion, and Phil Spinelli on percussion and lead vocals. Dillon had left by the end of 1974, and a newly available Collins took his place in 1975. The four recorded Unorthodox Behaviour in September and October 1975 at Trident Studios with Jack Lancaster on saxophone. They were named Brand X after Island Records staffer Danny Wilding wrote down \"Brand X\" to keep track of their activity on the studio calendar, and the name stuck. In preparation for their upcoming gigs, the four were joined by Geoff Seopardi on percussion by December 1975.

Rutherford later rated \"Mama\" as one of the best songs on the album, and was pleased with its commercial performance after the band found singles chart success with a song that represented what Genesis \"were all about\" at the time. During one session, the band had a koto in the studio, which was recorded through the E-mu Emulator and used as a sample for the song's percussion effect, partly because Banks had tried other options and could not get another sound to fit.", "*Tony Smith\u00a0\u2013 manager"]}, {"page": "Duke (album)", "response": ["The group's touring schedule had put particular pressure on Collins, whose marriage was at risk of collapse due to him being away from home frequently.

Collins, however, was convinced that Genesis were on the verge of an international breakthrough and that his work with the band would pay dividends in the future. By the end of 1978, Andrea had decided to move to Vancouver with their children. Realising that his marriage was more important than the band, Collins held a meeting with Banks, Rutherford and manager Tony Smith. He said he was moving to Vancouver and try and re-build the family, and that the group would have to accommodate this. In an interview for Sounds, Collins said, \"I went off for two months to try and sort things out ... I was never going to leave the band.

He first presented the band with portfolios from various illustrators, but the group did not find anything that they liked from them. Rutherford took Smith's sketchbook and spotted an abstract design initially made for a book, which featured an arrangement of torn inch-long pieces of paper from a Pantone swatch of colours with squiggly black lines. The band chose it as the cover, and Smith reproduced it in four different colour schemes with an embossed finish. The band liked all four, and thought it would have an effective presentation on shop displays. Three of the designs had a limited print, after which their label Charisma Records selected the original montage to remain in stock. Smith recalled the difficulty in persuading Genesis manager Tony Smith and staff at Charisma that \"these tiny scraps of coloured paper\" was to be the album's cover, but he was successful from having the group's backing and noted it became \"his best paid job ever.\" Genesis allowed Smith to retain the copyright to his work. In a contrast to previous Genesis albums, the sleeve is absent of lyrics.
