Later in the year, they were joined by lead vocalist Dikron Tulane.", "In April 2021, following some special videos created during the COVID-19 pandemic, Madness announced their first global live stream, titled \"The Get Up!\", to be held the next month. It featured live music and comedy from the group and Charlie Higson, pre-recorded at the London Palladium. During the live stream, the band was accompanied by Roland Gift and Paul Weller and had a cameo by Queen Elizabeth II, played by Mike Barson.

Formed by Suggs, Chas Smash, Lee Thompson and Chris Foreman in 1988, they distinguished this line-up from the previous Madness line-up only by adding the word \"The\" to the band's name. The band had held a competition to find a new name on Radio 1. They decided on 'The Wasp Factory' after the Iain Banks novel, but that name had already been taken by another band.", "Frequent themes in Madness' songs included childhood memories (e.g., \"Baggy Trousers\", and \"Our House\") and petty crime (e.g., \"Shut Up\", and \"Deceives the Eye\"). Although Madness were seen by some as somewhat of a humorous band with catchy, bouncy songs, many of their songs took a darker tone (such as the singles \"Grey Day\" and \"Tomorrow's (Just Another Day)\") and they sometimes tackled what were, at the time, controversial issues in their lyrics. \"Embarrassment\" (from the Absolutely album) was written by Lee Thompson, and reflected the unfolding turmoil following the news that his teenage sister had become pregnant and was carrying a black man's child. Madness discussed animal testing in the song \"Tomorrow's Dream\". The band criticised the National Health Service in \"Mrs. Hutchinson\", which told the story of a woman who, after several misdiagnoses and mistreatment, became terminally ill. The story was based on the experiences of Mike Barson's mother.
