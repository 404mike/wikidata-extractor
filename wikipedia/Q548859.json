He chronicled his upbringing in his oral history In Search of a Past: The Rearing of an English Gentleman, 1933-1945 (1984), in which interviews with the servants at his family's Berkshire country house served as a counterpoint to his own memories. Fraser spent five years as a correspondent with Reuters in Brussels, The Hague and London before moving to Spain in 1957 to become a full-time writer.\nFraser was one of the pioneers of oral history in the 1960s and '70s most notably with In Hiding: The Life of Manuel Cortes (1972) and Blood of Spain: An Oral History of the Spanish Civil War (1979). His book Napoleon\u2019s Cursed War: Spanish Popular Resistance in the Peninsular War, 1808-1814 (2008) applied his experience of oral history to traditional archival sources.\nFraser's friendship with Andr\u00e9 Gorz led to his involvement with the New Left Review from the early 1960s.  He was a lifelong socialist and at his death a senior member of the New Left Trust.  He was a founder of New Left Books, the parent company of publisher Verso Books.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Badajoz", "response": ["In 1812, Arthur Wellesley, Earl of Wellington (and future duke), again attempted to take Badajoz, which had a French garrison of about 5,000 men. Siege operations commenced on 16 March; by early April, there were three practicable breaches  in the walls. These were assaulted by two British divisions on 6 April, reputed to be \"Wellington's bloodiest siege\", with a loss of some 5,000 British soldiers out of 15,000. After a five-hour onslaught the storming of the breaches failed. The French also lost some 1,200 of their 5,000 soldiers in the battle. Despite the failure at the breaches, the castle and another section of undamaged wall had been attacked and the town was successfully taken by the British. After the capture of the city, the victorious troops (after getting drunk on stocks of captured alcohol) sacked the city, killing and raping numerous civilians. In the view of British historian Ronald Fraser, this was the worst night of the Peninsular War. It took three days before the men were brought back into order. When order was restored some 200\u2013300 civilians had likely been killed or injured.\"Siege of Badajoz \". Encyclopaedia Britannica.
