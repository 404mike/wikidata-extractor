A nippy winger, he impressed the Leeds manager when he performed as part of the Newport County side that knocked Leeds out of the 1949 FA Cup. At the end of the season he became a Leeds player for what was quite a high fee at the time (\u00a312,000). Able to switch wings at will, he was a creative and talented player who created many goals for John Charles as well as scoring a few himself. A broken leg in November 1952 kept him out of the side for 9 months, but he had lost nothing on his return. He left Leeds for a brief spell back at Newport making his total appearances 85 for Newport in the two spells, scoring 17 goals. He returned to Bradford Park Avenue where he lasted less than a season before retiring.\nHe became the landlord of The Griffin Hotel situated in the small quiet village of Gildersome near Morley after he retired from football, he ran the pub with his wife-and the pair earned much respect with their strictness.\nAt the time of his death in 2014, he was the oldest surviving Welsh international footballer.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Harold Williams", "response": ["Harold Williams may refer to:", "* Harold Williams (British Army officer) (1897\u20131971), British Army officer", "* Harold Williams (baritone) (1893\u20131976), Australian singer", "* Harold Williams (cricketer) (born 1959), Grenadian cricketer", "* Harold Williams (footballer) (1924\u20132014), Welsh international footballer", "* Harold Williams (geologist) (1934\u20132010), Canadian geologist", "* Harold Williams (linguist) (1876\u20131928), New Zealand journalist and polyglot", "* Harold Williams (priest) (1914\u20131990), Anglican Provost of Coventry", "* Harold Williams (died 1954) (1864\u20131954), Archdeacon of Gower"]}, {"page": "2014 in association football", "response": ["* 12 September: Harold Williams, Welsh international footballer (born 1924)"]}, {"page": "List of Newport County A.F.C. players", "response": ["*  Harold Williams (2 caps)"]}, {"page": "2014 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Harold Williams, 90, football player."]}, {"page": "Deaths in September 2014", "response": ["*Harold Williams, 90, Welsh football player.Harold Williams: Winger who laid on the chances for John Charles and was the oldest surviving Welsh football international"]}]}}
