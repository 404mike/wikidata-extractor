He is a right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium-fast bowler.\nAfter several years of minor counties cricket for Wiltshire, Sillence made his List A debut in May 1999, when he appeared in the NatWest Trophy against the Northamptonshire Cricket Board. His contribution was decisive as he hit 82, the top score of the innings, to help his side record a two-wicket victory. However, his two further List A games for the county, in September 1999 and May 2000, were unsuccessful as he could manage only 0 and 7.\nIn 2000 Sillence played often for Wiltshire during those two seasons, and also had a few games with the Worcestershire Second XI with little success. In August he had an excellent run for Wiltshire, scoring 35, 106*, 32, 57, 74 and 150 in successive innings. That last knock was the final time he was to play for Wiltshire, as he was immediately called up by Gloucestershire's second team and remained with them for the rest of the season, continuing to play for the seconds throughout most of the following summer.\nIn 2001 he also made his first-class debut, playing a single game against Sussex and making an immediate impact by taking 5\u201397 in the first innings, his maiden victim at this level being the opposing captain, Chris Adams. However, he failed to impress with the bat: he made only 0 and 6, and in both innings his method of dismissal was identical: caught Montgomerie, bowled Kirtley.\n2002 saw Sillence make his maiden first-class century as he hit 101 (from number nine in the order) against Derbyshire, though the second-highest of his seven innings was only 33, while with the ball he took 4\u201335 against West Indies A in a one-day match in late July, then in the last County Championship match of the season he took 5\u201363 against Durham.\nHe remained with Gloucestershire for three more seasons, making 92 (again from number nine) in the Championship against Warwickshire in August 2004, but first-team opportunities grew increasingly thin on the ground, until by 2005 he could manage only a single appearance. In October of that year Sillence signed a two-year contract with Worcestershire, and bided his time until then by spending the winter in Australia, playing for Casey-South Melbourne in Victorian Premier Cricket.\nBack in England, the 2006 season began promisingly for Sillence as he was picked for a series of Worcestershire's pre-season minor matches against other counties. He was not particularly successful, however, and after a C&G Trophy to forget against Nottinghamshire (0 with the bat; 3\u20130\u201321\u20130 with the ball) he was sent to captain the second team against Leicestershire seconds. He immediately showed his ability by scoring 152 out of a Worcestershire total of 265, although he did not bowl a single ball.\nSillence returned to the first team immediately thereafter, managing to establish himself as a first-choice player, and in June recorded career-best figures of 7\u201396 in the first innings against Somerset. (He had been given an excellent platform by Worcestershire's own first innings of 618, which included a stand of 330 between Ben Smith and Graeme Hick, a county record against these opponents.) He kept his place for the mid-season Twenty20 Cup, and afterwards contributed a number of useful innings, most notably in a 50-over game against West Indies A, when his 97-ball 94 set up a narrow nine-run win.\nSillence played 10 first-class matches in 2007 but took only 15 wickets, at the end of the season he was released by Worcestershire.Sillence has also played as Longton C.C.'s professional in the North Staffs and South Cheshire League Premier Division 'A', substituting for Bruce Martin, a New Zealander who proved unable to appear because of UK visa regulations.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gloucestershire County Cricket Club in 2005", "response": ["*  Roger Sillence"]}, {"page": "Gloucestershire County Cricket Club in 2004", "response": ["*  Roger Sillence"]}, {"page": "Dorset County Cricket Club", "response": ["* Roger Sillence "]}, {"page": "Kyle Hogg", "response": ["In May 2007 Hogg signed a four-month loan deal with Worcestershire to act as cover for injured seam bowlers Roger Sillence and Matt Mason. While playing for Worcestershire, Hogg claimed 3/44, his best bowling figures in the County Championship since 2002. In June injuries to Lancashire's squad meant that Hogg returned to the club before the conclusion of his four-month contract. Hogg played two first-class and four one-day matches for Worcestershire, taking six and two wickets in the respective formats. While playing for Worcestershire, Hogg was also awarded his county cap. Despite injuries, Hogg struggled to secure a place in Lancashire's first team, and in July 2007 moved to Nottinghamshire on loan for a month to bolster their injury-hit squad. Hogg went wicketless in the two first-class matches he played. he took three wickets at an average of 39.66. After two spells on loan, Hogg felt he was not part of Lancashire's plans and considered leaving the club."]}, {"page": "Sillence", "response": ["*Roger Sillence (born 1977), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of Gloucestershire County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Roger Sillence (2001\u20132005) : R.
