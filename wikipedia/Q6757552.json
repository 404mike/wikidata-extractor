He signed right-back John Kay, whilst remaining satisfied with existing left-back Reuben Agboola, centre-back Gary Bennett and goalkeeper Iain Hesford. In midfield he played a youthful combination of Gordon Armstrong, Paul Lemon, Gary Owers and Paul Atkinson, alongside the more experienced defensive midfielder Steve Doyle. He sold Mark Proctor to Sheffield Wednesday for \u00a3275,000. He signed young and pacey York striker Marco Gabbiadini for \u00a380,000 and played him alongside the experienced Eric Gates; the pair scored 42 goals between them in 1987\u201388.
