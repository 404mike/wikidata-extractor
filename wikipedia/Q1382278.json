In 1921 Shaw's erstwhile collaborator William Archer, in a letter to the playwright, wrote: \"I doubt if there is any case of a man so widely read, heard, seen, and known as yourself, who has produced so little effect on his generation.\" Margaret Cole, who considered Shaw the greatest writer of his age, professed never to have understood him. She thought he worked \"immensely hard\" at politics, but essentially, she surmises, it was for fun\u2014\"the fun of a brilliant artist\".

From Ibsen forward, challenging assumptions and directly speaking about issues has been considered one of the factors that makes a play art rather than entertainment. His works were brought to an English-speaking audience, largely thanks to the efforts of William Archer and Edmund Gosse. These in turn had a profound influence on the young James Joyce who venerates him in his early autobiographical novel Stephen Hero. Ibsen returned to Norway in 1891, but it was in many ways not the Norway he had left. Indeed, he had played a major role in the changes that had happened across society. Modernism was on the rise, not only in the theatre, but across public life.. Michael Meyer's translations in the 1950s were welcomed by actors and directors as playable, rather than academic.

It opened at the Trafalgar Theatre in London the following month, with Herbert H. Waring in the name part and Elizabeth Robins as Hilda. The English translation was by the theatre critic William Archer and poet Edmund Gosse. Productions in Oslo and Copenhagen were coordinated to open on 8 March 1893. In the following year, the work was staged by Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'\u0152uvre, the international company based in Paris.

It is usually grouped with Ibsen's other works written during this late period of Ibsen's life such as Little Eyolf, John Gabriel Borkman, When We Dead Awaken, and Hedda Gabler. Early reactions to the play by Ibsen's critics were mixed, possibly due its heightened ambiguities. Hilda, for example, seems to alternate roles between an inspiring force, urging Solness to temper his rampant ambition and so find real happiness, and a temptress, pushing Solness to commitments he cannot possibly fulfill. English critic William Archer (the play's original translator) suggests that the play is not as completely symbolic as some have maintained, interpreting it instead as \"a history of a sickly conscience, worked out in terms of pure psychology\". He notes that, in this regard, the play is similar to earlier works that deal mainly with a retrospective look at a character's psyche."]}, {"page": "Archer (surname)", "response": ["* William Archer (1820\u20131874), Australian architect, naturalist, grazier and politician", "* William Archer (Toronto politician) (1919\u20132005), Canadian politician and lawyer", "* William Archer (architect) (1820\u20131874), botanist and architect and member of the local Archer family", "* William Archer (naturalist) (1830\u20131897), Irish naturalist and microscopist", "* William Archer (critic) (1856\u20131924), Scottish critic"]}, {"page": "Clement Scott", "response": ["Scott accumulated enemies among theatre managers, actors and playwrights as years went on, picking quarrels with William Archer, Ibsen, George Bernard Shaw and others.

M. Levy, allowed him to pioneer the essay-style review of drama, which came to replace the earlier bare notices. His column of notes and reviews became very popular throughout Britain, and later his own magazine, The Theatre, achieved wide circulation. He wrote his theatre reviews immediately after he saw the opening night of a piece which, together with his short temper and his dislike of critic William Archer, the chief English supporter of Ibsen, tended to involve him often in controversies."]}, {"page": "Lewis Waller", "response": ["Waller then joined William Hunter Kendal and John Hare at the St. James's Theatre, where he played the Duc de Bligny in The Ironmaster, Sir George Barclay in Lady Clancarty, and Lord Arden in The Wife's Secret. When Rutland Barrington took over the management of the St. James's in 1888, Waller played  George Sabine in The Dean's Daughter and Ralph Crampton in Brantinghame Hall. Rudolph de Cordova, in a 1909 biographical sketch notes, \"During this period, few theatres played regular afternoon performances, so that the actors were, for the most part, engaged only in the evening. Many matinees were, however, given to introduce new plays and new players; and in this way Mr. Waller acted a large number of new parts, all of an ephemeral character.\"Cordova, pp. 2\u20133 In particular he played several  Ibsen roles in these matinees in the early 1890s, bringing him to the attention of people of influence in the theatre such as William Archer, Jacob Grein and Bernard Shaw. Waller played Oswald in Ghosts, Lovborg in Hedda Gabler, Rosmer in Rosmersholm and Solness in The Master Builder.  The ODNB comments that Archer was \"delighted that an established West End actor had contributed to the Ibsen revival but was aware that Waller could overcome neither the plays' inadequate rehearsal period nor his background of florid West End performances.\""]}, {"page": "J.
