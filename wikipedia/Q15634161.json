He told his cardiologist earlier in the week that he was \"running out of petrol\" and wanted to \"die with dignity\".

It houses a polo facility, an 18-hole golf course designed by Greg Norman, a go-kart track as well as agricultural holdings of the Packer family. Kerry Packer purchased the 30,000 hectare property in 1972 and was later buried within the grounds of Ellerston in 2005. The agricultural holdings at Ellerston are currently managed by Robert Teague. Teague has managed the property since 2007. Ellerston is 500m above sea level with a yearly 28-inch rainfall. Roughly 4000 cows are bred on the property during a regular season. In October 2020, a 25-year-old man was transported from Ellerston to John Hunter Hospital after suffering a head injury during a polo game. The man was transported using a Westpac Rescue Helicopter. A 48-year-old man, Guy Kirkpatrick, suffered head injuries on the farm whilst operating machinery and died on January 7, 2021. In 2015 a 50% share of Ellerston, comprising 1400ha, was sold by the Packer family's private company, Consolidated Press Holdings, to Crown Resorts for A$60 million.  James Packer sold 40 ponies in 2009 for approximately A$5 million. A portion of the ponies were purchased by the Pieres family. In 2015, a further 140 ponies were sold for A$1.7 million. The Ellerston polo team won the Vivari Queen's Cup in 2008. A nine-metre bronze Greek horse head reportedly sits besides Kerry Packer's grave in Ellerston. The statue was shipped from Britain and was sculpted by British artist Nic Fiddian-Green."]}, {"page": "Fiddian", "response": ["*Nic Fiddian-Green (born 1963), British sculptor"]}, {"page": "Serenity (sculpture)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Nic Fiddian-Green"]}]}}
