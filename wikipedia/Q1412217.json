The biochemical properties of antigen-antibody-binding interactions were examined in more detail in the late 1930s by John Marrack. The next major advance was in the 1940s, when Linus Pauling confirmed the lock-and-key theory proposed by Ehrlich by showing that the interactions between antibodies and antigens depend more on their shape than their chemical composition. In 1948, Astrid Fagraeus discovered that B cells, in the form of plasma cells, were responsible for generating antibodies."]}, {"page": "Blundell's School", "response": ["*Professor John Marrack, DSO, MC, Emeritus Professor of Chemical Pathology in the University of London", "*John Marrack, (10 February 1921 \u2013 7 November 2009) naval officer, Queen's Harbourmaster 1962."]}, {"page": "Socialist Health Association", "response": ["*Prof John Marrack"]}, {"page": "Timeline of immunology", "response": ["* 1938 \u2013 Antigen-Antibody binding hypothesis (John Marrack)"]}, {"page": "Philippa Marrack", "response": ["Marrack completed both undergraduate (1967) and Ph.D. (1970) at Cambridge University in New Hall, Cambridge.

Alan Munro became her thesis advisor; she became the graduate student that worked with him due to his interest in working with a relative of John Marrack. John Marrack was Philippa Marrack's grandfather's brother, and a very well-known immunologist in the 1930s.
