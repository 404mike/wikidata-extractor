Recording for Trespass began in June at Trident Studios in London, with Anthony as producer and David Hentschel hired as assistant engineer. The album included longer and more complex songs than their first, blending folk and progressive rock elements with various time signature changes, as in the nine-minute song \"The Knife\". Trespass is the first in a series of three Genesis album cover designs by Paul Whitehead. He had completed the design before the band decided to include \"The Knife\" on the album. Feeling the cover no longer reflected the album's overall mood, the band persuaded Whitehead to slash a knife across the canvas and have the result photographed. Released in October 1970, Trespass reached No. 1 in Belgium in 1971 and No. 98 in the UK in 1984. \"The Knife\" was released as a single in May 1971. Rolling Stone briefly mentioned the album with a negative view following its 1974 reissue: \"It's spotty, poorly defined, at times innately boring\". \"Genesis seemed to be dying a death around our second album\", Gabriel told Mark Blake. \"We couldn't get arrested. So I got a place at the London School of Film Technique.\""]}, {"page": "The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway", "response": ["Hipgnosis designed the album's artwork. In a departure from that company's previous album sleeves, which featured more colourful designs, the front cover of The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway makes use of black and white and no colour. The band's logo, originally designed by Paul Whitehead and used on Nursery Cryme (1971) and Foxtrot (1972), was replaced by a new one in an Art Deco style by George Hardie.

After several months of touring they secured a recording contract with Charisma Records, and entered Trident Studios in London in July 1970 to record Trespass. The music marked a departure from more pop-oriented songs, as displayed on their first album From Genesis to Revelation, towards folk-flavoured progressive rock. This ranged from light acoustic pieces with multiple twelve-string guitars, to the heavier live favourite \"The Knife\". The sleeve, featuring a knife slash across the front, was the first of several to be designed by Paul Whitehead.", "The album cover was painted by Paul Whitehead, based on a hungarian artist Vilmos Pogany(1882-1956) engraving. Paul Whitehead also did the covers for the band's next two albums. The cover showed two people looking out of a window at mountains, which represented the pastoral themes of some of the songs. Whitehead had finished the cover and then the band added \"The Knife\" to the running order.

When the group originally saw Whitehead's painting, they said it didn't look old enough, so he varnished it with honey which made it look like it was an antique from the 19th century.

The album was written over the summer of 1972 and combined songs that had already been performed live with new material worked out in jam sessions. Recording began in August with John Anthony, but sessions were prone to tension and disagreements. After a short Italian tour, sessions resumed with Dave Hitchcock taking over production duties. The cover was the final Genesis work to be designed by Paul Whitehead, featuring a fox wearing a red dress. Frontman Peter Gabriel wore the dress and a fox's head on stage for the following tour, which gathered press attention and greatly improved the group's profile.", "thumb|right|upright|Foxtrot is the final Genesis album designed by Paul Whitehead", "The album's cover was the last of three Genesis releases designed by Paul Whitehead, following Trespass and Nursery Cryme. He was a former art director for the London-based magazine Time Out and gained inspiration from the lyrics to \"Supper's Ready\" which included references to the apocalypse. Whitehead wanted to present the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse in an original way but it turned into something \"a little more whimsical\", with two horse riders being a monkey and an alien. The cover for Nursery Cryme had depicted croquet which represented the English upper class which Whitehead repeated on Foxtrot with the depiction of fox hunting. The croquet scene is also repeated, placed in the background which has the Victorian manor now replaced with a hole in the ground. Whitehead devised the album's title, which he had done for Trespass and Nursery Cryme as he recalled the group were stuck for ideas. He had heard the word \"foxy\", an American slang term for an attractive woman, during a visit in the United States, and \"Foxy Lady\" by The Jimi Hendrix Experience, which he used as inspiration to draw a female with a fox head. Whitehead's original illustrations for the three albums were stolen from the Charisma archives when it was sold to Virgin Records in 1983.

Its second logo (used beginning in 1972) of Sir John Tenniel's drawing of the Mad Hatter (sometimes combined with a montage of other images from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland) made the label instantly recognizable. Much of the early distinctive artwork used by the label was created by Paul Whitehead.

In the US, the pink scroll labels were used in late 1973 and early 1974 on releases distributed by Buddah.

Wilkinson's first artistic creation for Marillion was the cover of their debut 12\" EP Market Square Heroes  (1982). Subsequently, Wilkinson's art work would be used on all of Marillion's albums and 12\" releases through The Thieving Magpie (1988). When Fish left the band Wilkinson went with him, providing the artwork for many of his albums and singles; aside from compilations, Songs from the Mirror is the only studio album by Fish not to feature cover art by Wilkinson. In 1997, he collaborated with Bill Smith Studios (which had replaced him as Marillion's official art group) on the Best of Both Worlds compilation CD. The compilation included songs from the eras of the band with and without Fish, and the record label, EMI, decided it should also include artwork reflective of both eras. In 2000, Fish and Wilkinson collaborated on a book, Masque, which, in \"back and forth\" format, described the process by which the Fish and Marillion album covers were created. Wilkinson will likely always be most closely identified with Fish and Marillion (in a similar fashion to Roger Dean's association with Yes or Paul Whitehead's association with Genesis)."]}, {"page": "Pawn Hearts", "response": ["The album's title came from a spoonerism by Jackson, who once said, \"I'll go down to the studio and dub on some more porn harts\", meaning \"horn parts\".

The band then headed to Los Angeles to record their next album. At the same time, they hired a guitarist, Tolo Marton, bringing the group to four members. The resulting Smogmagica, boasting a cover by Paul Whitehead, was significantly more commercially oriented than their previous work, and was largely viewed as a disappointment by fans.
