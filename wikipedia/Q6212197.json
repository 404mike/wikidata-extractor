Schumacher's manager Weber assured Jordan that Schumacher knew the challenging Spa-Francorchamps circuit well, although in fact he had only seen it as a spectator. During the race weekend, teammate Andrea de Cesaris was meant to show Schumacher the circuit, but was held up with contract negotiations. Schumacher then learned the track on his own, by cycling around the track on a fold-up bike he had brought with him. He impressed the paddock by qualifying seventh. This matched the team's season-best grid position, and Schumacher out-qualified veteran de Cesaris. Motor Sport journalist Joe Saward reported that after qualifying \"clumps of German journalists were talking about 'the best talent since Stefan Bellof. Schumacher retired on the first lap of the race with clutch problems."]}, {"page": "Lewis Hamilton", "response": ["Hamilton is regarded as one of the best wet-weather drivers in the sport, with some of his best performances occurring in those conditions. In the 2008 British Grand Prix, Hamilton bested second-place Nick Heidfeld by over a minute, the largest margin of victory recorded since the 1995 Australian Grand Prix. During the turbo-hybrid era, Hamilton remained unbeaten in every race affected by wet weather from the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix up to the 2019 German Grand Prix, where his almost five-year streak was broken by Max Verstappen. His wet weather drive at the 2020 Turkish Grand Prix where he clinched his seventh world title was widely acclaimed, with Joe Saward describing it as \"one of his greatest performances\": despite only qualifying sixth for the race after Mercedes struggled with tyre temperatures and a track that lacked grip after being recently resurfaced, during the race he gambled on a one-stop strategy in mixed conditions whilst his rivals chose to change their tyres for a second time, enabling him to take the lead and win by over 30 seconds. His performance was contrasted with that of his team-mate Bottas, who spun four times and finished a lap down in 14th place. Hamilton cited the race as his \"stand-out\" performance of the season."]}, {"page": "Henry George Kendall", "response": ["His grandson was the Anglican priest and hymn writer Canon Michael Saward, and his great grandchildren include F1 journalist Joe Saward and the late anti-rape campaigner Jill Saward.", "* Joe Saward \"The Man who Caught Crippen\" (Morienval Press, 2010), 242p. illus. ."]}, {"page": "1992 Monaco Grand Prix", "response": ["Mansell went even faster on Saturday with a 1:19.495 and took his sixth pole position of the season. He later described his time as a \"totally clear lap\". Patrese improved to qualify second fastest, however he was held up by Bertrand Gachot on one of his qualifying laps, and reacted by heading over to the Larrousse pit and trying to punch the Frenchman. Senna finished qualifying third on the grid despite spinning the rear of his car into the tyre barrier at the Mirabeau corner, damaging both his rear suspension and wing which eventually broke off in the tunnel as he returned his damaged car to the pits. Modena suffered a drive shaft failure early in the session and ran back to his pit to use the spare Jordan. In the spare car he failed to improve on his Friday time and dropped to 21st on the grid. He was the only driver who did not set a faster time in Saturday Qualifying. Following his crash in the morning Martini still took part in the afternoon session in the spare Dallara and qualified 18th fastest. Having finished 20th fastest on Thursday, Moreno only managed to improve slightly on his Thursday time with a 1:24.945 due to \"a string of mechanical problems\" with the S921 chassis. With the circuit proving faster on Saturday he fell to 26th place by the end of the session. Eric van de Poele set his fastest time in the final minutes of qualifying but just failed to make 26th place as he was +0.036 seconds slower than Moreno. Formula 1 journalist Joe Saward reported there was \"rejoicing\" in the Andrea Moda pit upon Moreno's qualification for the race."]}, {"page": "1995 British Grand Prix", "response": ["Similarly, BBC commentator and former driver, Jonathan Palmer, said that Hill's manoeuvre was the result of \"a rush of blood to the head\". Journalist Joe Saward was amongst those who speculated, however, that Schumacher had played a role in the collision by taking a wider line into the Priory corner than usual, and thus encouraging Hill to attempt the manoeuvre. The incident was subject to a stewards' investigation, which resulted in both drivers being given a severe reprimand and a warning that \"future similar actions may result in severe penalties\". The collision overshadowed the fact that, in the opinion of Roebuck, Benetton had again chosen a better race strategy than Williams, and that Schumacher would have had a comfortable lead had he not been stuck behind Alesi in the early stages of the race. There was also similar ill-feeling between Barrichello and Blundell after their collision on lap\u00a060. Barrichello accused Blundell of brake-testing him prior to the incident, and of causing the crash by changing his driving line too quickly, whilst Blundell denied the allegations and drew attention to Barrichello's similar collision with H\u00e4kkinen the previous year. The stewards also investigated this incident and gave Blundell a severe reprimand for his actions."]}, {"page": "Bedford College, London", "response": ["*Joe Saward (born 1961), English motor-sports journalist"]}, {"page": "Robert O'Brien (racing driver)", "response": ["*Joe Saward \"Fascinating F1 Fact \u2013 82\" "]}, {"page": "Horseleap", "response": ["A story concerning a bronze statue of a prancing horse on the village green claims that it was commissioned in Italy by the sports car manufacturer, Ferrari, and eventually wound up in Horseleap following a series of misadventures.

According to the Brazilian television station Rede Globo, Brazilian driver Felipe Massa, who finished the Singapore race in 13th having been leading at the time of Piquet Jr.'s crash, and eventually lost the 2008 World Championship to Lewis Hamilton by one point, did question Briatore about the crash at the time, although FIA president Max Mosley stated the sport could take no action based on \"speculation\"."]}]}}
