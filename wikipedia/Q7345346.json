Because the group of local councils varies with each cycle of local elections, the BBC and other analysts calculated a projected national vote share, which aims to assess what the council results indicate the UK-wide vote would be if the results were repeated at a general election. The BBC's estimate put Labour and the Conservatives on 28% (both down 7% from last year), the Liberal Democrats on 18% (up 2% from last year) and all other parties as 'other' on 25%. Some have argued that the Conservatives put their expectations so low so that the impact of losses were reduced. Media reports described the results as poor for both Labour and the Conservatives, with many noting decline of Labour representation in some leave areas. It was also regarded as a disappointing result for the Labour because of expectations that they would gain."]}, {"page": "List of University of Zimbabwe people", "response": ["* Lord Robert Hayward; British politician and Member of Parliament 1983\u20131992"]}, {"page": "2019 Bath and North East Somerset Council election", "response": ["Following the 2015 election, the council was controlled by the Conservative Party, although previously the council had been under no overall control since its creation in 1996.
