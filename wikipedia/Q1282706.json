He trained and practised as a barrister, being called to the Bar by Inner Temple in 1945, before starting to write. During World War II, he served with an air defence unit and manned an anti-aircraft battery at Portsmouth, where the man next to him was killed by shrapnel.  He served on St Pancras Borough Council from 1945 to 1949, and stood, unsuccessfully, as Labour Party candidate for Winchester in 1955 general election.\nHe married, in 1949, Vera Pollak, who died in 2002 and with whom he had two sons and a daughter.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Franco-Prussian War", "response": ["Great Britain saw nothing wrong with the strengthening of Prussia on the European continent, but in the face of France Great Britain saw her as a traditional rival in international affairs.

According to Scalingi, the work is \"perhaps the best known analysis of gynecocracy\" and Knox was \"the most notorious\" writer on the subject. According to an 1878 edition, Knox's objection to any women reigning and having \"empire\" over men was theological and it was against nature for women to bear rule, superiority, dominion, or empire above any realm, nation, or city. Susan M. Felch said that Knox's argument was partly grounded on a statement of the apostle Paul against women teaching or usurping authority over men. According to Maria Zina Gon\u00e7alves de Abreu, Knox argued that a woman being a national ruler was unnatural and that women were unfit and ineligible for the post. Kathryn M. Brammall said Knox \"considered the rule of female monarchs to be anathema to good government\" and that Knox \"also attacked those who obeyed or supported female leaders\", including men. Robert M. Healey said that Knox objected to women's rule even if men accepted it. On whether Knox personally endorsed what he wrote, according to Felch, Jasper Ridley, in 1968, argued that even Knox may not have personally believed his stated position but may have merely pandered to popular sentiment,Ridley, Jasper, John Knox (N.Y.: Oxford University Press, 1968), p.\u00a0267, as cited in  itself a point disputed by W. Stanford Reid.Reid, W. Stanford, Trumpeter of God: A Biography of John Knox (N.Y.: Scribner, 1974), p.\u00a0145, as cited in  On the popularity of Knox's views, Patricia-Ann Lee said Knox's \"fierce attack on the legitimacy of female rule\u00a0... [was one in which] he said\u00a0... little that was unacceptable\u00a0... to most of his contemporaries\", although Judith M. Richards disagreed on whether the acceptance was quite so widespread. According to David Laing's Preface to Knox's work, Knox's views were agreed with by some people at the time, the Preface saying, \"[Knox's] views were in harmony with those of his colleagues\u00a0... [Goodman, Whittingham, and Gilby]\".Laing, David, Preface (from extract), in  Writing in agreement with Knox was Christopher Goodman, who, according to Lee, \"considered the woman ruler to be a monster in nature, and used\u00a0... scriptural argument to prove that females were barred\u00a0... from any political power\",, citing Goodman, Christopher, How Superior Powers Ought to be Obeyd (N.Y.: reprint, 1931, originally 1558) (chap. on gynecocracy). even if, according to Richards, the woman was \"virtuous\". Some views included conditionality; while John Calvin said, according to Healey, \"that government by a woman was a deviation from the original and proper order of nature, and therefore among the punishments humanity incurred for original sin\", nonetheless Calvin would not always question a woman's right to inherit rule of a realm or principality. Heinrich Bullinger, according to Healey, \"held that rule by a woman was contrary to God's law but cautioned against [always] using that reason to oppose such rule\". According to Richards, Bullinger said women were normally not to rule. Around 1560, Calvin, in disagreeing with Knox, argued that the existence of the few women who were exceptions showed that theological ground existed for their exceptionalism.\"There were occasionally women so endowed, that the singular good qualities which shone forth in them made it evident that they were raised up by Divine authority\". Calvin, letter to William Cecil (on or after January 29, 1559 (probably 1560)), in  (citing, at Preface, n.\u00a01, for letter, Zurich Letters (2d ser.), p.\u00a035) (Calvin reviser, Commentaries on Isaiah (sometime in 1551\u20131559) (approximate title)). Knox's view was much debated in Europe at the time,, e.g., citing Aylmer (AElmer), John, An Harborowe for Faithfull and Trewe Subiects agaynst the late blowne Blast, concerninge the Gouernment of Wemen wherin be confuted all such reasons as a straunger of late made in that behalfe, with a briefe exhortation to obedience (1559). the issue considered complicated by laws such as on inheritance and since several women were already in office, including as Queens, according to de Abreu. Knox's view is not said to be widely held in modern Protestantism among leadership or laity."]}, {"page": "First Opium War", "response": ["One British historian Jasper Ridley concluded:", ":Conflict between China and Britain was inevitable.
