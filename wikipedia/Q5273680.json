A lower-order right-handed batsman and wicketkeeper, he won a Blue for cricket in 1967, and was then offered a contract with Somerset, the county having just parted company with its regular wicketkeeper Geoff Clayton. Brooks kept wicket tidily for Somerset for the whole of the 1968 season, but at the end of it he was offered a teaching post at Bradfield College and gave up the first-class game.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Dickie Brooks (1968) 26 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Richard Brooks (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Dickie Brooks (born 1943), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Charlie Carter (cricketer)", "response": ["Carter moved into Somerset's first team for the final two matches of the 1968 season following the decision of regular wicket-keeper Dickie Brooks not to continue a first-class cricket career. Though Carter scored only one run in his four innings that season, he was handed a contract for 1969 and played in all 24 County Championship matches in the 1969 season, though Trevor Holmes was picked for the other first-class fixture against the West Indians. In an unsuccessful season for Somerset \u2013 the county finished bottom of the Championship table for the first time since 1955 \u2013 Carter was singled out for praise in Wisden. He was, it said, \"extremely enthusiastic\" and had \"developed into a most capable performer\". He appeared less frequently in one-day cricket: the 1969 season was the first season of the new John Player League, a 40-over competition played on Sundays, but Carter played in only a few matches, Somerset generally preferring the more reliable batting of Roy Virgin, who could keep wicket adequately."]}, {"page": "Dickie (name)", "response": ["* Dickie Brooks (born 1943), English cricketer"]}]}}
