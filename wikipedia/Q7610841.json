He worked largely in British film and television, and attended Henley-in-Arden School in Warwickshire before further training as an actor at London's Corona Academy. He began his career aged 17, as a \"bad boy\" in the film To Sir With Love (1966), and in the classic BBC Doctor Who adventure The Web of Fear, as a soldier battling Yeti in the London Underground.In 1985 Whittaker took a director's training course, and directed a short training film which he sent to John Schlesinger (who had directed him in Yanks). Schlesinger suggested him to producer Mark Shivas as director for Channel 4's drama trilogy What If It's Raining?, written by Anthony Minghella. This was the beginning of a directing career of prestigious TV and film work. Shortly before Whittaker's death, writer Julian Fellowes spoke of him as, \"the most exciting director in the industry.\"In 2001 he filmed his final project The Rocket Post, a romantic drama set on a remote Scottish island. The film had severe funding problems, and was eventually released in 2006, three years after his death. The credits bear a dedication to his memory. Whittaker died following complications from a routine surgery.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2003 in film", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 7 || Stephen Whittaker || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 55 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| UK || style=\"text-align:center;\"| Actor, Director || "]}, {"page": "Scarp, Scotland", "response": ["A fictionalised account of the rocket mail experiment was used as the basis of the film, The Rocket Post, filmed on Harris and Taransay and directed by Stephen Whittaker, which was finally released in 2006.
