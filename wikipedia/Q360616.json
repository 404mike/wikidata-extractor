He made his debut in 1989 and played initially as a left winger before transitioning to an attacking fullback role for the club. He left Chelsea in 1993 to join the newly promoted Blackburn side being built by wealthy benefactor Jack Walker and was a regular fixture in their 1994\u201395 Premier League winning side. In 1997, he became the most expensive defender in English footballing history when he returned to Chelsea for \u00a35 million, staying there for six seasons before finishing his career with a move to Southampton in 2003. He announced his retirement from football upon Southampton's relegation from the Premier League in 2005.\nIn his club playing career, he scored 20 goals from 403 club appearances. He was twice named in the Professional Footballers' Association Team of the Year, in 1995 with Blackburn and in 1998 with Chelsea. As an England international, he made 36 senior appearances from 1994 until 2000, including starting all four England games at the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France, and scoring one international goal, against Brazil.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "October 17", "response": ["*1968 \u2013 Graeme Le Saux, English footballer and sportscaster"]}, {"page": "The Football Association", "response": ["The football associations within the Crown dependencies of Jersey (Jersey Football Association), Guernsey (Guernsey Football Association) and the Isle of Man (Isle of Man Football Association) are affiliated to the FA despite having a separate identity from that of the United Kingdom and by extension England.

Although they never looked like regaining their Premiership title, they were in contention for a UEFA Cup place until the last game of the season but lost out to Arsenal and finished seventh. It wasn't at all a bad finish, though, considering that Blackburn had been in the bottom half of the Premier League for much of the season.

Liverpool manager G\u00e9rard Houllier stated that this was a Cameroonian grass-eating celebration, learnt from teammate Rigobert Song. Defending himself, Fowler later said this was a response to Everton fans who had insulted him with false accusations of drug abuse. Fowler received a four-match suspension from the FA for this incident. At the same FA disciplinary hearing, Fowler received a further two-match suspension due to a separate incident in which he had homophobically taunted the Chelsea defender Graeme Le Saux by waving his backside at him as Le Saux's wife and children watched from the stands. Fowler later attempted to justify his actions by suggesting his taunts were simply an extension of gamesmanship. The FA imposed a \u00a332,000 fine and a six-match ban for the two incidents.

In December 2013, Graeme Le Saux named Lu\u00eds Figo and Brian Laudrup as his toughest opponents ever. Walter Smith's view of Laudrup was more critical however, lauding his ability but also lamenting his mentality, which he believed limited him as a player, commenting: \"Brian Laudrup is as good a player as I have ever worked with, but he frustrated me. He had the capability of being up there with the greatest players of all time. There was just that little bit in him mentally that stopped him from being right at the very top.
