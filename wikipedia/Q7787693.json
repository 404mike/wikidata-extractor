In his book A Revelation of the True Minerva (1582), Thomas Blennerhassett portrays Queen Elizabeth I of England as a \"new Minerva\" and \"the greatest goddesse nowe on earth\". A series of paintings by Peter Paul Rubens depict Athena as Marie de' Medici's patron and mentor; the final painting in the series goes even further and shows Marie de' Medici with Athena's iconography, as the mortal incarnation of the goddess herself. The Flemish sculptor Jean-Pierre-Antoine Tassaert (Jan Peter Anton Tassaert) later portrayed Catherine II of Russia as Athena in a marble bust in 1774. During the French Revolution, statues of pagan gods were torn down all throughout France, but statues of Athena were not. Instead, Athena was transformed into the personification of freedom and the republic and a statue of the goddess stood in the center of the Place de la Revolution in Paris. In the years following the Revolution, artistic representations of Athena proliferated."]}, {"page": "List of political families in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Thomas Blennerhassett (1584\u20131611), MP for Carlisle (1584, 1586 and 1604)"]}, {"page": "Carlisle (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| 1584||Edward Aglionby|| Thomas Blennerhassett", "| 1586||Henry Macwilliam,  died and repl. 1587 by William Bowyer|| Thomas Blennerhassett", "| 1604|| Thomas Blennerhassett|| William Barwick"]}, {"page": "Ederney", "response": ["Local historian Leo Mulligan MBE details that at the time of the Plantation there was a settlement of significance at Ederny when the land grant (titled \"Edernagh\") was given to Captain Thomas Blennerhassett of Norfolk in 1610.
