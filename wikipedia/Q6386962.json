Born to the north of Birmingham in Walsall and brought up in foster homes and local authority institutions across the West Midlands county, he spent his early adult life in various cities including Birmingham, London, New York City and Miami. He first built his reputation as a producer with a series of groundbreaking darkcore tracks in the early 1990s, including 1992's \"Terminator\", arguably the pivotal track of the entire scene. In 1992 he founded Metalheadz with fellow Birmingham-born DJ Kemistry and the following year released \"Angel\", the track which marked the start of the demise of the dark sound he had earlier epitomised, incorporating samples from Brian Eno and David Byrne and becoming the first track to successfully take hardcore in a more musical direction without losing its essence. In 1995 he took this fusion approach to its ultimate conclusion with the release of his debut album Timeless: an \"archive of overlapping sounds from Goldie's past: Jamaican dub, Brit-soul, Detroit techno, hip-hop, and developments in jungle/drum 'n' bass\", with Goldie himself crediting these eclectic musical tastes to his rootless Midlands upbringing: \"in one room a kid would be playing Steel Pulse, while through the wall someone else had a Japan record on and another guy would be spinning Human League.\" Timeless was the first drum and bass record to achieve substantial mainstream success. Moving the genre from hardcore's low-brow populism into more progressive musical territory, it was \"almost universally hailed as a masterpiece upon release\" and left Goldie as the genre's unofficial figurehead, for the first time establishing an English figure with a profile that could match that of the stars of American hip-hop."]}, {"page": "Deaths in April 1999", "response": ["*Kemistry, 35, English drum and bass DJ and co-founder of record label Metalheadz, road accident."]}, {"page": "List of deaths in rock and roll (1990s)", "response": ["| Kemistry Kemistry & Storm || style=\"text-align:center;\"|35 || April 25, 1999 || Winchester, Hampshire, England || Traffic accident"]}]}}
