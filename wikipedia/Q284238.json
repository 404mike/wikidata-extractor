He developed the coal and iron industries across South Wales and built the Cardiff Docks.\nBute's father, John, Lord Mount Stuart, died a few months after he was born and as a young child he was brought up first by his mother, the former Lady Elizabeth McDougall-Crichton, and later by his paternal grandfather, John Stuart, 1st Marquess of Bute. He travelled widely across Europe before attending Cambridge University. He contracted an eye condition and remained partially sighted for the rest of his life. Having inherited large estates across Britain, he married his first wife, Lady Maria North, in 1818, and together they lived a relatively secluded life in Mount Stuart House in Scotland, one of Bute's four seats. Bute was dour but industrious, with a flair for land management. He focused his daily routine around extensive correspondence with his estate managers, making biennial tours of his lands around the country. The couple did not conceive any children, and Maria died in 1841. Bute remarried four years later, to Lady Sophia Rawdon-Hastings, and she gave birth to Bute's only child, John, in 1847.\nBute was a member of the House of Lords and controlled the votes of several members of the House of Commons. He was a political and religious conservative, a follower of the Duke of Wellington, but rarely took part in national debates unless his own commercial interests were involved. Early on, Bute realised the vast wealth that lay in the South Wales coalfields and set about commercially exploiting them through local ironmasters and colliers. He constructed the Cardiff Docks, a major project which, despite running heavily over budget, enabled further exports of iron and coal and magnified the value of his lands in Glamorganshire. When violence broke out in the Merthyr Rising of 1831, Bute led the government response from Cardiff Castle, despatching military forces, deploying spies and keeping Whitehall informed throughout. The contemporary press praised the marquess as \"the creator of modern Cardiff\", and on his death he left vast wealth to his son.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cardiff", "response": ["In 1793, John Crichton-Stuart, 2nd Marquess of Bute was born.

Smirke redesigned the house (with the exception of the south front) to resemble its present form today, complete with a massive portico, similar to that designed by Adam but never built. His early work and domestic designs, such as that at Eastnor Castle, were often in a medieval style; he seems to have reserved his Greek revival style for public buildings such as the British Museum. Luton Hoo, neither gothic nor strictly Greek revival, is an unusual example of him using a classical style for domestic use, which perhaps he felt would be sympathetic to Adam's original conception."]}, {"page": "Lord Lieutenant of Buteshire", "response": ["*John Crichton-Stuart, 2nd Marquess of Bute 2 January 1815 \u2013 18 March 1848"]}, {"page": "John Stuart, Lord Mount Stuart", "response": ["*John Crichton-Stuart, 2nd Marquess of Bute (10 August 1793 \u2013 18 March 1848)"]}, {"page": "John Crichton-Stuart", "response": ["* John Crichton-Stuart, 2nd Marquess of Bute (1793\u20131848)"]}, {"page": "Flora Mure-Campbell, Marchioness of Hastings", "response": ["*Lady Sophia Frederica Christina (1809\u20131859), married John Crichton-Stuart, 2nd Marquess of Bute and had issue."]}, {"page": "Kirtling", "response": ["John Crichton-Stuart, 2nd Marquess of Bute built almshouses in Kirtling in 1842 in memory of his late wife Lady Maria (died 1841).
