He played for Birmingham both before and after the First World War, making 198 appearances in all competitions, and helped them win the championship of the Second Division in 1920\u201321. He also played in the Football League for Aston Villa, Stoke, Coventry City and Walsall.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Willie Gildea", "response": ["Gildea went straight into the team for the visit to Stockport County on 23 September, which Birmingham lost 2\u20130, and kept his place for 20 matches. He scored his first goal in senior English football on 28 October against Grimsby Town, making the score 1\u20131 \"in the tussle following [a] well-placed corner kick\"; the game ended as a 2\u20132 draw. Birmingham's FA Cup first-round tie against Barnsley ended without a goal; in the replay, Gildea damaged a shoulder early on, winger Jimmy Conlin injured his arm so badly he had to leave the field, and Birmingham were overrun. In response to a series of poor results, the directors selected an experimental line-up for the next match which included four debutants, one of whom, Alec McClure, replaced the injured Gildea at centre half; the team played well, kept a clean sheet for the first time in a league match since November, and won. Gildea never returned to the first team; he finished the season with the reserves, and returned to Scotland."]}, {"page": "William McCourty", "response": ["McCourty remained in the Birmingham area, found employment as a conductor for Birmingham Corporation Tramways, and played for its football team in the Birmingham Combination. He married Emily Brown, a cycle finisher, in 1912, and their son William Donald was born in late 1915, by which time McCourty had moved on to driving the trams. Emily's younger sister Amy married another Birmingham footballer, Alec McClure."]}, {"page": "1924\u201325 Stoke F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Alec McClure"]}, {"page": "1925\u201326 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Alec McClure"]}, {"page": "1915\u201316 Stoke F.C. season", "response": ["|DF||align=\"left\"| Alec McClure"]}, {"page": "1921\u201322 Birmingham F.C. season", "response": ["Thirty-one players made at least one appearance in nationally organised first-team competition, and there were twelve different goalscorers.

He had four children with his wife Martha, before he \"virtually abandoned\" the family in the 1920s when his football career took off and later had four children with another woman. Martha, who refused to divorce him, died in 1968. While with Wallsend, McClure trained to be a welder and worked as a bar steward in later life. McClure's son Peter went on to play football for local Workington non-league club Salterbeck."]}]}}
