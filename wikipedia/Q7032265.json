On the second day opener and captain Nigel Briers scored his 27th century and first since his return from rupturing an Achilles tendon. He shared a partnership of 108 in 27 overs with Ben Smith (78). Leicestershire batted onto the third morning with Warwickshire's bowlers being too wayward to exploit the helpful conditions. Brian Lara continued his good form by scoring a third consecutive century but Warwickshire were only able to save the follow-on by one run. Roger Twose, with 51, was the only other player to pass 18 as the hosts collapsed from 201/2 to 254, all eight wickets falling to former Warwickshire spinner Adrian Pierson. On the final day Leicestershire batted on until 35 minutes after lunch before declaring to leave Warwickshire a target of 285 from 57 overs. They survived with three wickets remaining but owed a great deal to Lara who was the only person to pass 20, his score of 120 not out made him the first Warwickshire batsman in 10 years to score hundreds in both innings of a match."]}]}}
