He is a right-handed batsman who also plays as a wicket-keeper. He made his first-class debut for Worcestershire against Hampshire in May 2015. He was educated at Llanfyllin High School.  Following Worcestershire\u2019s relegation to Division Two of the County Championship in 2018, he joined Nottinghamshire on a four year deal.In 2017, Clarke was included in an England Lions squad that toured Australia, scoring 45 against a CA XI in Perth. However, in May 2019, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) withdrew Clarke from the Lions' squad, after being named during Alex Hepburn's rape trial. Hepburn was found guilty of rape, and although the judge said that Clarke \"did nothing wrong\" on the night of the attack, the ECB were concerned about the disrespectful messages about women that had been exchanged.On the 21 June 2019, the English Cricket Board charged Joe Clarke and Tom Kohler-Cadmore with bringing the game into disrepute in relation to their participation in the group actions which saw Alex Hepburn found guilty of rape. On the 4 July 2019, both players pleaded guilty to the charge and were reprimanded and fined.In December 2021, he was signed by the Karachi Kings following the players' draft for the 2022 Pakistan Super League.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["|style=\"text-align:center\"|33|| Joe Clarke* ||  ||  || Right-handed || \u2014 ||"]}, {"page": "Walter Lawrence Trophy", "response": ["Four batsmen have won the main award on more than one occasion, twice each: Ian Botham, Graham Lloyd, Leslie Ames and Viv Richards.
