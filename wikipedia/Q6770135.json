He has created music under his own name as well as Locust, and Autocreation. Pitchfork said, \"Musically, Van Hoen belongs to a distinguished family tree. Originally influenced by the likes of Brian Eno and Tangerine Dream, and later presaging both Autechre's glitch and Boards of Canada's pastoral IDM, with his latest album Van Hoen would fit in just as well alongside White Rainbow or Atlas Sound on a current label like Kranky: He combines oceanic drone with pop lyricism, using technology as a catalyst.\"In 1993, Van Hoen signed with the Belgian-based record label, R&S. The initial releases were as Locust and used vintage analogue synthesizers and tape recorders. As the Locust sound moved towards an increasingly more vocal oriented approach in the late 1990s, Van Hoen also began to release music under his own name.\nIn October 2013, Black Hearted Brother, Van Hoen's collaboration with Neil Halstead, released their debut album,  Stars Are Our Home.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Smethwick", "response": ["* Mark Van Hoen (born 1966), electronic music artist, born in Croydon but brought up in Smethwick."]}, {"page": "Locust (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Locust, an alias of electronic artist Mark Van Hoen from Touch Records"]}, {"page": "Emma Anderson", "response": ["In 1997 Anderson formed a new band with vocalist Lisa O'Neill, Sing-Sing.

I demoed those songs for 4AD with myself singing but was dropped but I wasn't fazed. I then met Lisa O'Neill via a guy I was going out with at the time. She had worked with Mark Van Hoen whom funnily enough, someone I knew said, was looking for collaborators so it kind of all fell into place and Sing-Sing was born.\""]}, {"page": "As the Cry Flows", "response": ["*Mark Van Hoen - Synthesizers"]}, {"page": "Sing-Sing (band)", "response": ["Both the band's albums were produced by O'Neill's former colleague in Locust, Mark Van Hoen, but they also collaborated with the Mad Professor (remixed \"I'll Be\" in a lovers rock style), Robin Guthrie of Cocteau Twins, cellist and string-arranger Audrey Riley, Tim Keegan (Departure Lounge vocalist) and 4AD artist Vinny Miller.
