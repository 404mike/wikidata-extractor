They gathered in Portland, Oregon with producer John Askew to cut the band's debut album, Colfax. The songs on  Colfax, which was released in June 2014, combined Vlautin's admired lyrics about characters from the America's hinterland and their everyday struggles, with Boone's vocals, the emotion of which wrings out the pain of the characters.
