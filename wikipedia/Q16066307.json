He never married.Having originally intended to be a priest, Bowyer was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Abingdon at a by-election in December 1809, following the death of its incumbent member George Knapp. Bowyer stood in the election as a substitute candidate for his eldest brother, George Bowyer. His brother had infringed the Treating Act and had become vulnerable to a petition against him.

His brother George was subsequently elected in June 1811.
