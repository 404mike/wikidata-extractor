As soon as the blank disc starts spinning, our soundtrack switches from the film-maker\u2019s 21st-century handheld digital stereo to the glorious mono of the single microphone. There are no faders; if Burnett or White want more of this musician and a bit less of that one, they move them closer to or away from the microphone. It\u2019s brilliant theatre, beautifully filmed and makes for glorious television. Miss it at your peril.\u201d Stephen Dalton in The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the film was \u201ca mammoth project with worthy intentions and a big heart - a feast of musical and educational riches.\u201d Steve Appleford in Rolling Stone observed that \u201cin the final performance of Sessions, Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard perform the duet \"The Only Man Wilder Than Me.\" Haggard has a look of complete joy on his face throughout the session in the old-timey recording set-up once used by his musical heroes.\u201d Mike Bradley in The Observer said The American Epic Sessions was \u201cone of the most interesting music programmes ever broadcast.
