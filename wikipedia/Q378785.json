Similarly, Mellers states that harmonic movement from the key of C sharp minor to D major to C major \"creates the 'aimless' wandering of 'each unconscious sufferer'\" described in the lyrics. The nearly chromatic melody of the verses contrasts with a more standard rock melody in the middle eight."]}, {"page": "Isolation (John Lennon song)", "response": ["Musicologist Wilfrid Mellers describes \"Isolation\" as an \"Anglicized version of Negro piano blues.\"  The instrumentation begins with just drums and piano backing Lennon's vocals.  When Lennon's vocals become more emotional, an organ is added to the instrumentation.  The instrumentation also includes bass, played by Klaus Voormann.  Mellers points out that the song's mood of isolation is intensified by the \"bare, open fifths\" played by the piano and by the silences incorporated into the sad melody.  He also notes that the pain communicated by the song is enhanced by the dissonances in the music, particularly the use of semitone intervals.  According to Mellers, the portion of the third verse in which Lennon sings that \"You're just a human/a victim of the insane\" is effectively intensified by the contrasting semitones of F\u266f against F and by harmonizing F with a dominant seventh chord on C instead of with a D major chord."]}, {"page": "Stephen Beville", "response": ["Beville graduated in 1998 with First Class Honours, and was awarded the Wilfrid Mellers prize and Rodwell prize."]}]}}
