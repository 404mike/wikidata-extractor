Cardell's tradition of Wicca venerated a form of the Horned God known as Atho, and worked with a coven that met in the grounds of his estate in Surrey.  His tradition of Wicca was continued through Raymond Howard's Coven of Atho. Indeed it was Cardell who coined the term \"Wicca\", and referred to its followers as \"Wiccens\".\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
