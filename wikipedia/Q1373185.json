From his Lectura I d. 3, q. 1, a. 1:\n\nWhenever an affirmative proposition is apt to be verified for actually existing things, if two things, howsoever they are present according to arrangement and duration, cannot suffice for the verification of the proposition while another thing is lacking, then one must posit that other thing.\nIn basic terms, he was arguing against Ockham's razor by stating that if an explanation does not satisfactorily determine the truth of a proposition, and you are sure that the explanation so far is true, some other explanation must be required.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Occam's razor", "response": ["Occam's razor has met some opposition from people who have considered it too extreme or rash. Walter Chatton () was a contemporary of William of Ockham who took exception to Occam's razor and Ockham's use of it. In response he devised his own anti-razor: \"If three things are not enough to verify an affirmative proposition about things, a fourth must be added, and so on.\" Although there have been a number of philosophers who have formulated similar anti-razors since Chatton's time, no one anti-razor has perpetuated in as much notability as Chatton's anti-razor, although this could be the case of the Late Renaissance Italian motto of unknown attribution  (\"Even if it is not true, it is well conceived\") when referred to a particularly artful explanation."]}, {"page": "List of scholastic philosophers", "response": ["*Walter Chatton"]}, {"page": "Index of philosophy articles (R\u2013Z)", "response": ["* Walter Chatton"]}, {"page": "Gregory of Rimini", "response": ["Gregory was born in Rimini around 1300.

In the 1330s he taught at Augustinian schools in Bologna, Padua and Perugia, where he became familiar with the recent work of Oxford thinkers such as Adam Wodeham, William Ockham, and Walter Chatton.  He returned to Paris in 1342 to prepare his lectures on Peter Lombard's Sentences, which he delivered in 1342\u20131344.  Because of his familiarity with English philosophy during this time, he effectively transmitted contemporary Oxford ideas\u2014with an Augustinian tinge\u2014to Paris.

It was the second Franciscan religious house to be founded in the country. The establishment included a conventual church that was one of the largest in London; a studium or regional university; and an extensive library of logical and theological texts. It was an important intellectual centre in the early fourteenth century, rivalled only by Oxford University in status. Members of the community at that time included William of Ockham, Walter Chatton and Adam Wodeham. It flourished in the fourteenth and fifteenth century but was dissolved in 1538 at the instigation of Henry VIII as part of the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Christ's Hospital was founded in the old conventual buildings, and the church was rebuilt completely by Sir Christopher Wren as Christ Church Greyfriars after the original church was almost completely destroyed in the Great Fire of London of 1666. The building now standing on the site, designed by Arup Group Limited, is currently occupied by Merrill Lynch."]}, {"page": "Chatton (surname)", "response": ["*Walter Chatton (1290\u20131343), English theologian and philosopher"]}]}}
