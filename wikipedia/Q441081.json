Crawfurd writes that, with the assistance of a steam-boat, ships might be towed down in two days without difficulty; then adds in a footnote: \"The first steam-vessel used in India, was built about three years after this passage was written....\"", "The John Adam proceeded on what would be the first official visit to Siam since the resurgence of Siam following the Burmese\u2013Siamese War of 1765\u20131767. Crawfurd soon found the court of King Rama II still embroiled in the aftermath of the Burmese\u2013Siamese War of 1809\u20131812. On 8 December 1821, near Papra Strait (modern Pak Prah Strait north of Thalang District) Crawfurd finds fishermen \"in a state of perpetual distrust and insecurity\" due to territorial disputes between hostile Burmans and Siamese. 11 December, after entering the Straits of Malacca and arrival at Penang Island, he finds the settlements of Penang and Queda (modern Kedah Sultanate, founded in 1136, but then a tributary state of Siam) in a state of alarm. Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin Halim Shah II, the Rajah of Quedah had fled the Rajah of Ligor (modern Nakhon Si Thammarat) to claim right of asylum at Prince of Wales's Island (modern Penang.) British claim to the island was based upon payment of a quit-rent accordant with European feudal law, which Crawfurd feared the Siamese would challenge.", "Crawfurd married Horatia Ann, daughter of James Perry. From 1821 to 1822, Mrs. Crawfurd had accompanied the Mission to Siam and Cochin China aboard the John Adam. As the ship made way from Bangkok to Hu\u00e9, Mrs. Crawfurd went ashore on an island in the Gulf of Siam, where she made a considerable impression upon the natives.
