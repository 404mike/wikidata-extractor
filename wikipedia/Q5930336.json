The battalion had lost half its strength, the 4 rifle companies were severely depleted and non-commissioned officers were frequently required to act as platoon commanders. The battalion saw very heavy fighting at Hamminkeln, where its objectives were the railway station and bridges over the River Issel between Hamminkeln and Ringenburg. Lieutenant Hugh Clark led a bayonet charge to take a road bridge for which he was awarded a Military Cross. CSM John Stevenson was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal for defeating several enemy attacks with a platoon he led on the east bank of the River Issel. The 2nd Ox and Bucks captured and held all its objectives. During the fighting German troops put out white flags of surrender and then opened fire. The Germans launched a number of counter-attacks, all of which were repelled. There was heavy shelling by the enemy near the Issel bridge. At midnight on 25 March the Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) relieved the battalion and by 06.00hrs on 26 March the unit was based in a farm on the west side of Hamminkeln. Later that morning the 2nd Ox and Bucks were informed that 6th Airborne Division would lead the advance across Germany."]}, {"page": "2010 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Hugh Clark, Army officer (b. 1923)"]}, {"page": "Deaths in September 2010", "response": ["*Hugh Clark, 86, British army officer."]}, {"page": "Captain Hugh Clark MC", "response": ["#REDIRECT Hugh Clark (British Army officer)"]}, {"page": "Hugh Clark (Captain)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Hugh Clark (British Army officer)"]}, {"page": "Hugh Clark", "response": ["Hugh Clark or Hugh Clarke may refer to:", "*Hugh Clark (actor) (died 1653), English actor", "*Hugh Clark (politician) (1867\u20131959), Canadian politician and newspaper editor", "*Hugh Clark (British Army officer) (1923\u20132010), British Army Second World War officer"]}]}}
