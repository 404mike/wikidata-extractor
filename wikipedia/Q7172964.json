He is the founder of the website VDARE, an anti-immigration site associated with white supremacy, white nationalism, and the alt-right. He believes that \"whites built American culture\" and that \"it is at risk from non-whites who would seek to change it\".Brimelow was previously a writer and editor at National Review, and columnist for Dow Jones' MarketWatch. Brimelow founded the Center for American Unity in 1999 and served as its first president. He describes himself as a paleoconservative. Brimelow has also been described as a leader within the alt-right movement. He rejects the labels of \"white supremacist\" and \"white nationalist\" and prefers to be known as a \"civic nationalist\".  In January 2021, a judge dismissed a lawsuit Brimelow brought against The New York Times, ruling that his being called a \"white nationalist\" was not defamatory.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Washington, Connecticut", "response": ["*Peter Brimelow, magazine editor"]}, {"page": "Pat Buchanan", "response": ["Since 2006, Buchanan has been a frequent contributor to VDARE, a far right website and blog founded by anti-immigration activist and paleo-conservative Peter Brimelow.

Leading figures in this movement included Ted Byfield, Stan Roberts, Francis Winspear, and Preston Manning. A major intellectual impetus at the time was provided by Peter Brimelow's 1986 book, The Patriot Game. They believed the West needed its own party if it was to be heard. Their main complaints against the Mulroney government were its alleged favouritism towards Quebec, lack of fiscal responsibility, and a failure to support a program of institutional reform (for example, of the Senate). The roots of this discontent lay mainly in their belief that a package of proposed constitutional amendments, called the Meech Lake Accord, failed to meet the needs of Westerners and Canadian unity overall."]}, {"page": "Paleoconservatism", "response": ["* Peter Brimelow (born 1947)"]}, {"page": "Right Now!
