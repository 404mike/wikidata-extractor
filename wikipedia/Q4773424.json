The brass of Sir Roger as seen through the thoughtful eyes of a young Royal Air Force Spitfire pilot who visited the church in 1941 is movingly described by Squadron Leader Guy Mayfield, then chaplain of RAF Station Duxford, in his diary.Carl Warner (editor), Life and Death in the Battle of Britain (London: Imperial War Museum, 2018), 154 and 161. Mayfield, an Anglican priest, was the chaplain at Duxford during the Battle of Britain in 1940, and most of 1941. He and a young pilot officer, Harold Oxlin (\"HO\"), visited the church on 8 July 1941: \"We looked at Sir Roger (a very fine effigy of a crusader who came back) and Sir Roger looked at HO . . . I saw by HO's look that some idea of a common connection had sprung to his mind . . . I watched one 'boisterous knight' looking thoughtfully at another one.\"  Mayfield said that a principal topic of conversation in quiet moments for Oxlin and for other young pilots as well was, \"What happens when you die? Is it wrong to be frightened of dying? How should you live if you are twenty and will be dead by the end of the summer?\" Oxlin was killed in action over France two weeks after visiting the church with Mayfield. Mayfield wrote, \"I like to think of him standing beside Sir Roger.\" It is noted by Anthony Sattin that TE Lawrence hung a rubbing of the brass in 'pride of place' in his parents' Oxfordshire home."]}, {"page": "David Downie", "response": ["Together with Alison Harris he walked across much of central France following sections of the Way of Saint James, the greatest medieval European pilgrimage route.

Viollet-le-Duc\u2019s theme-park-ish restorations ... the Resistance to the Nazis, and even the travels of an earlier, more gluttonous, and less reflective David Downie\".Andrew Riggsby quoted in \"Paris to the Pyrenees\" at Global Geneva (19 April 2013) Anthony Sattin, another writer who combines travel with history, considers that in Downie's case the act of walking with the photographer Alison, the pleasures of the countryside, \"the lighting out for the territory when one is a certain age\", give this book its reason.Anthony Sattin, review in The Sunday Times (5 May 2013) The walk (\"which he completed on foot between the titular locations\", according to Gilbert Taylor's risky claim in Booklist)Gilbert Taylor in Booklist (August 2017) Subscription required was in reality anything but complete when Downie, \"an amiable companion, questioning and willing, and flawed\", found that \"a damaged back and aching knees force[d] him to stop just outside M\u00e2con\", a long way from the Pyrenees and much further still from Compostela.
