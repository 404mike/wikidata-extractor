It was written and composed by musician Gerard Le Feuvre. The song was written in 2002 and adopted in 2008 after a contest to find an official anthem for Jersey. However, more than a decade after the contest, the anthem has not received official government ratification.", "In 2007, a contest was held to determine the official anthem of Jersey. A shortlist of five was drawn up from twenty-three entries. \"Ma Normandie\" was controversially excluded from the shortlist despite lyrics from it previously adorning banknotes of the Jersey pound. The justification for exclusion was that the song had no direct connection to Jersey and references France in its lyrics. The contest was judged by a panel of five judges and an audience of the public. After voting, the Bailiff of Jersey announced the contest had been won by \"Island Home\" written by Gerard Le Feuvre in 2002 from St Ouen. Le Feuvre's inspiration was to have a song that was simple for children to sing but also inspire unity. The song was inspired by the wildlife in Jersey, with the first three notes designed to imitate the lowing of a Jersey cow. The song was written in English, but Le Feuvre said he would release a J\u00e8rriais version. The song was first performed at the Jersey Opera House on Liberation Day 2008. \"Island Home\" started to be played at official events and schools in Jersey before being confirmed as the anthem."]}]}}
