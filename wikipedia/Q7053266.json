He advised his son, then employed as a fire-fighter, to take advantage of the trip to Scotland. The accounts claim that British security services were aware of this plan. Rather than leaving the party at the banquet, the accounts say that the players of both countries had moved from there to the Tron Tavern, a nearby bar that was run by Norrie Rowan, himself then a Scottish international and Boroughmuir player. This was a customary change of venue and it was from the bar that Raducanu sought to evade members of the Securitate, who were guarding the entrances and exits. The bar was connected to the Edinburgh Vaults and with Rowan's assistance Raducanu was able to surface on the streets several hundred yards away from the premises and then find a policeman. Some of Raducanu's fellow players certainly did die during the revolution, including Florica Murariu and Radu Durbac."]}, {"page": "1985 Five Nations Championship squads", "response": ["# Norrie Rowan"]}]}}
