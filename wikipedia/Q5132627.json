The retrospective in 1957 generated a level of admiration that had, \"not been seen even in Sweden for a long time.\"", "Lundquist was chosen to represent Sweden at the \"IV Bienal do Museu de Arte Moderna\" in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil in 1957. Artworks that were selected for inclusion, including works by Lundquist, were destroyed by fire aboard the transport ship carrying them. The catalog for the Bienal, with a forward to Lundquist's works written by Dr. Hugo Zuhr, list five works by Lundquist; A Arvore (1949), O Passaro (1956), Crian\u00e7a Comendo (1957), Nos Campos (1957) and Corpo De Boi (1957). While Cliff Holden states that all of Lundquist's works for the Bienal were lost in this fire, some contemporary literature states the loss of only three paintings.", "The Tate Gallery was created in 1897 and has since amassed a collection of objects from 1500 AD to the present time. The artists chosen to be part of the modern and contemporary art collection are chosen for merit and their contributions to the world of art. In the late 1950s Lundquist's fellow artist and supporter Cliff Holden, who had long believed that Lundquist was one of only two artists who could legitimately represent Sweden internationally, began a campaign to encourage the Tate to accept Lundquist's work into its collection. \"Woman in Red\", a work from the collection of Nils Tesch, was accepted into the collection. Previous to this acquisition, the only other Swedish painter to be collected by the Tate was Edvard Munch. The work titled \"Woman in Red\" has been part of the Tate collection since that time.", "As noted, the early 1940s were a pivotal time for Lundquist. His style was changing, somewhat radically, from his previous aesthetics. What would generally now be termed modern abstract art, was in its prime development stages in the early 1940s, particularly in the United States. In many ways, Lundquist and other European artist were developing similar approaches to art independently of other artists. Artist Cliff Holden made such an observations when he first saw Lundquist's works. He found the works to be quite a revelation. He felt Lundquist and his mentor, artist David Bloomberg, had been creating similar works; The artists were paralleling the \"philosophy, theory and practice\" of the other. The artists had begun to create images \"in mass\" as opposed to images which used detail for narration. Bloomberg, at the Borough Polytechnic, would latter teach artists Frank Auerbach and Leon Kossoff. Auerbach and Kossoff are often referenced as having stylistically similarities with Lundquist.", "British artist Cliff Holden felt Lundquist's use of \"tonal range and thick impasto\" was reminiscent of Jo Tilson and artists of the Beaux Arts Gallery, but was quick to point out that Lundquist had not used this as a trick or \"gimmick\". In Lundquist's works, the impasto came about, \"in the passionate wrestling with the material which he tries to bring to life in an image which each time is the result of a unique experience... (Lundquist's works preceded but anticipated) Nicholas de Stael, yet without falling into that morass of conflict between the figurative and non-figurative quality of images. Like Bomberg, Lundquist works towards a synthesis of the two attitudes.\" Holden, recalling Lundquist's interests in the philosophies of Schopenhauer and Wittgenstein, felt Lundquist aims could be framed in a quotation from the \"Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus\"; \"The picture represents a possible state of affairs in logical space. The picture contains the possibility of the state of affairs, which it represents. The picture agrees with reality or not, it is right or wrong, true or false. The picture represents what it represents, independently of its truth or falsehood, through the form of representation. What the picture represents is its sense. In the agreement or disagreement of its sense with reality, its truth or falsity consists.\"", "It is not difficult to imagine that Lundquist's projections may have worked against him in the shifting values of what was now considered exciting in the personality, as distinct from the actual artwork, of artists in the postwar art world. Perhaps his portrayed persona supported a stereotype and bias that had previously existed which, at times, portrayed Swedish artists as somehow \"too provincial\". This stereotype was mentioned and complained about as late as 1959 by critic Clas Brunius. Lundquist had actually been confronted by such a biased perception. Fellow artist and friend Cliff Holden relates that he had requested Lawrence Alloway, who was then the head of London's Institute of Contemporary Art, to take on Lundquist. Alloway, familiar with Lundquist's reputation refused on the ground that he appeared as too \"provincial\". Eventually, Alloway did see Lundquist's artwork at a private exhibition at the Beaux Arts Gallery. Impressed, Alloway \"profusely\" apologized to Holden saying that \"he now considered Lundquist was a major artist on the international scene.\" Fifteen years latter, Alloway was to become curator at the Guggenheim in New York. The Guggenheim Museum, freshly housed in its iconic building designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, was already one of the most recognized museums in the world. Alloway's opinion of Lundquist as an artist had not changed, and he invited Lundquist to exhibit there."]}, {"page": "Free Painters and Sculptors", "response": ["* Cliff Holden"]}, {"page": "Deaths in April 2020", "response": ["*Cliff Holden, 100, English painter, designer and silk screen printer.Cliff Holden obituary"]}]}}
