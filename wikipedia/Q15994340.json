Attending Cambridge University, he was the first recipient of a studentship founded in honour of his supervisor Francis Maitland Balfour, who died in a climbing accident in 1882. Two years after graduating from Cambridge in 1880, Caldwell was appointed Demonstrator in Comparative Anatomy, working for Professor Alfred Newton. In 1884, Caldwell used his studentship, which consisted of \"\u00a3200 studentship, a \u00a3500 grant, the prestige and backing of the Royal Society, and letters of introduction from Newton to travel to Australia\" to investigate whether the platypus laid eggs. With the assistance of the local Aborigines, Caldwell set up camp on the banks of the Burnett River in northern Queensland, hunting for lungfish, echidna, and platypus eggs. After extensive searching assisted by a team of 150 Aborigines, he discovered a few eggs. Mindful of the high cost per word, Caldwell famously but tersely wired London, \"Monotremes oviparous, ovum meroblastic.\" That is, monotremes lay eggs, and the eggs are similar to those of reptiles in that only part of the egg divides as it develops. Caldwell stayed away from the beginning stages of Darwinism and wanted to study evolutionary patterns himself. He believed that patterns of individual development could assist in developing and understanding the process of evolution.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Platypus", "response": ["When the platypus was first encountered by European naturalists, they were divided over whether the female lays eggs.

G. Waterhouse as Director of the South Australian Museum in Adelaide, and was a founding member of the Field Naturalists Society of South Australia. In August 1884 he laid to rest an old mystery about echidnas, proving they are oviparous not viviparous, William Hay Caldwell in New South Wales made a similar (and almost coincidental) finding with the platypus with a specimen sent to the Museum by a naturalist on Kangaroo Island. His work and the liberality with which he was treated attracted some criticism, as did his bombastic self-promotion. He resigned his position in October 1884, after a series of disputes with the Museum's management but did not leave the colony."]}]}}
