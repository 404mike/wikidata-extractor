From 1943 to 1944, she played the sexually inexperienced but curious Sally Middleton in The Voice of the Turtle (by John Van Druten) on Broadway and later in London (1947).

As Berlin's daily scenes featured \"poverty, unemployment, political demonstrations and street fighting between the forces of the extreme left and the extreme right,\" Isherwood, Spender, and other British nationals soon realized that they must leave the country. \"There was a sensation of doom to be felt in the Berlin streets,\" Spender recalled. By the time the Nazi Party attained power in the July 1932 elections, Isherwood had departed Germany and returned to England. Afterwards, most of Berlin's seedy cabarets were shuttered by the Nazis, and many of Isherwood's cabaret friends would later flee abroad or perish in concentration camps.; ;  These factual events served as the genesis for Isherwood's Berlin tales. His 1939 novel Goodbye to Berlin was later adapted by playwright John Van Druten into the 1951 Broadway play I Am a Camera and, ultimately, the 1966 Cabaret musical."]}, {"page": "Burgess Meredith", "response": ["In 1929, he became a member of Eva Le Gallienne's Civic Repertory Theatre company in New York City.
