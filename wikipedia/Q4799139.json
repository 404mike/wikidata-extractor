He made 25 league appearances for Crystal Palace scoring a single goal. Sunderland brought Hudgell into the club in January 1947, for \u00a310,000, then a record fee for a full back, and he made his debut on 1 February 1947 against Blackburn Rovers in a 2\u20131 win at Ewood Park.

He was replaced by Dickie Dyke, who had made only one first team appearance for the club. Sunderland made two changes to the side that defeated Derby County in the league the week before, with captain Fred Hall returning to the lineup at the expense of Ken Oliver, while Barney Ramsden filled in for the injured Arthur Hudgell in defence."]}, {"page": "Jimmy Wilde (footballer, born 1904)", "response": ["Wilde made his debut on 24 November 1928 in a home FA Cup tie 2\u20130 win against Kettering Town and his performance against Peter Simpson (later a Palace colleague), went a long way to ensuring his first team place in the future. Wilde remained at Palace for ten years and was a first team regular for eight seasons, six of them as captain, after which he continued to play regularly for the reserves, helping with the development of younger players, in particular Arthur Hudgell. Wilde made a total of 293 appearances for Crystal Palace.  this was still within the 20 highest player appearances for the club. He retired from playing in 1938, having made only three first team appearances over the previous two seasons."]}]}}
