The band was playing so loud he could not judge how good they were, but he decided to give them a chance. He would later comment in the book, 1000 UK No. 1 Hits by Jon Kutner and Spencer Leigh, that he woke up that morning with a stinking headache, and when he got to the studio and heard the Foundations, he thought they were pretty terrible. He decided his hangover was to blame, and so he gave them the benefit of the doubt.", "Around this time after the release of their second single, tensions developed between the band and their songwriter/producer, Tony Macaulay. He would not allow them to record any of their own songs. In an interview, the band's organ player, Tony Gomez, told the New Musical Express (NME) in an interview that he, Peter MacBeth, and Eric Allandale had some ideas that they wanted to put together. Curtis later recalled that Macaulay was a problem. \"Tony Macaulay was very talented, but could be difficult to get on with. When we asked to record some of our own material \u2013 just as B sides, we weren't after the A side \u2013  he called us 'ungrateful' and stormed out of the studio.\"", "The group felt that Macaulay had reined in their \"real\" sound, making them seem more pop-oriented than they were. Tony Macaulay was later to recall, \"I was never close to the Foundations. I couldn't stand them, and they hated me! But the body of work we recorded was excellent.\"", "From the band's beginning to their breakup towards the end of 1970, the Foundations released ten singles in the United Kingdom including two versions of the same song. The majority of the singles were composed by Tony Macaulay and John Macleod. They had four significant hits from these plus a minor hit with one of their own compositions, \"Born to Live, Born to Die\". They had minor hit with \"My Little Chickadee\" in the United States. This was written by Tony Macaulay and John Macleod. There were other titles announced that were either never recorded or were never released. They were \"Our Love Went Thataway\", \"Tear Jerker, Music-worker, You\" which was to be released around the same time as \"Better By Far\" by Lulu and \"No Place On Earth Could Find You\". In 1971, the single \"Stoney Ground\" was released. It is believed that this single was actually by Colin Young and his new backing band Development. It seems quite likely as the Colin Young and Development debut single \"Any Time at All\" pre-dates \"Stoney Ground\". In the mid and late 1970s, there were two more singles released under the Foundations name. They were \"Where Were You When I Needed Your Love\" and \"Closer to Loving You\" which featured the Northern Soul classic \"Change My Life\" as the B side.
