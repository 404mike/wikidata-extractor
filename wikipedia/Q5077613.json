He was born in Johannesburg, received his early education at Parktown Boys' High School and studied at Witwatersrand University and Cambridge University where he completed his doctorate. In 1958, he joined the Department of Applied Economics at Cambridge. During this period, other notable economic historians such as Phyllis Deane and W. A. Cole were hard at work, extending data series on the UK economy back into previous centuries. In 1972, Feinstein published his magnum opus, National Income, Expenditure and Output of the United Kingdom, 1855-1965, which has since come to be seen as the standard reference work on UK economic data for the period. The Times said of this book: \n\nAlthough Feinstein undertook many more investigations, this was perhaps his crowning achievement. Of the several similar projects undertaken in different countries, for example the American, Canadian, Australian and German initiatives, it is fair to say that the one that Feinstein brought into being was the most elegantly reasoned, organised and presented. It was all the more remarkable for being the work largely of one man.\nA fellow of Clare College, Cambridge, Feinstein was also associated with the universities of York, Harvard, Oxford and Cape Town in the course of a distinguished academic career. He was Chichele Professor of Economic History at All Souls College, Oxford for many years, and was instrumental in the creation of the Oxford Masters (MSc and MPhil) in Social and Economic History. The Feinstein Prize, endowed in his honour, is awarded each year to the student on these courses who writes the best thesis.\nHe is also the author of a history of South Africa entitled An economic history of South Africa: conquest, discrimination and development, published posthumously by Cambridge University Press in 2005.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "World War I reparations", "response": ["Several historians take the middle ground between condemning reparations and supporting the argument that they were not a complete burden upon Germany. Detlev Peukert states, \"Reparations did not, in fact, bleed the German economy\" as had been feared, however the \"psychological effects of reparations were extremely serious, as was the strain that the vicious circle of credits and reparations placed the international financial system\". P.M.H. Bell writes that while reparations were unwelcome in Germany and caused a \"strain on the German balance of payments\", they could be paid and were \"compatible with a general recovery in European commerce and industry\". According to Martel, Robert Boyce said reparations were \"a heavy burden on Germany, both as a financial charge\u00a0...\u00a0and as a charge on Germany's balance of payments\". However, he says that while \"Germany claimed it could not afford to pay reparations\" this was far from the truth, and that \"\u00a0...\u00a0Germany had made little effort to pay reparations. It refused to levy the necessary taxes, and far from accumulating the foreign exchange required for their payment by collecting some of the overseas earnings of German exporters, it allowed them to leave their earnings abroad\". William R. Keylor agrees with Boyce, and says, \"an increase in taxation and reduction in consumption in the Weimar Republic would have yielded the requisite export surplus to generate the foreign exchange needed to service the reparation debt\". However, Charles Feinstein writes that these kind of arguments overlook the extreme reluctance of the Germans \"to accept even a modest increase in taxation to meet what was universally regarded as an unjustified and oppressive imposition by hostile adversaries\". Feinstein says that \"even if the economic aspects\u00a0...\u00a0were not as crippling as had been assumed in the 1920s, the exaction of reparations was still of deep political and psychological significance for Germany\"."]}, {"page": "Economic history", "response": ["* Charles Feinstein"]}, {"page": "Chichele Professorship", "response": ["* Charles Feinstein, 1989\u2013"]}, {"page": "Feinstein", "response": ["*Charles Feinstein (b. 1932), British economic historian"]}, {"page": "\u00c9tienne Mantoux", "response": ["On the other hand, Charles Feinstein criticised Mantoux's argument that the Allies could have collected reparations as the German economy grew and for pointing out the reluctance of the Germans to pay more taxes when they already saw reparations as oppressive and unjust.
