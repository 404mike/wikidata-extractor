Art Critic James Burr: \"It is rare today to find a young painter whose visual language has grown out of the formal austerities and induced linear precision of the 15th century; this is a decade where painting is ferociously impulsive and dominated by abstraction so that the calm objectivity and direct reaction to the visual world of Reginald Gray comes as a relief from a rapid indulgence in manipulating material\".

Another exhibition for Gray at Abbott and Holder was programmed for the following year which had a further good reception.
