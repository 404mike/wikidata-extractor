Originally under manager Willie Macfarlane, he then featured in the teams of the 1970s managed by Eddie Turnbull, which were known as Turnbull's Tornadoes. This team won the Scottish League Cup in 1972 and finished second in the league in 1974 and 1975, which was Hibs' greatest period of sustained success since the Famous Five team of the early 1950s. A highlight of Duncan's time at Hibs was when he scored twice in the club's 7\u20130 victory at the home of Edinburgh derby rivals Hearts on 1 January 1973.Towards the end of this period, Duncan won international recognition, making his Scotland debut against Portugal on 13 May 1975. Duncan featured in the three Home Internationals that season, including the infamous 5\u20131 defeat by England at Wembley. Duncan won the last of his six caps later that year against Denmark. Coincidentally, this was the game that was marred by an incident afterwards where five players (Billy Bremner, Willie Young, Joe Harper, Pat McCluskey and Arthur Graham) were allegedly ejected from a nightclub in Copenhagen. Those players were banned from playing for Scotland, initially for life, but the bans were eventually commuted.\nDuncan continued to play for Hibs as the club's fortunes declined in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The club did reach the 1979 Scottish Cup Final, but Duncan's own goal during extra time in the second replay proved to be the winning goal for Rangers. Duncan is highly regarded amongst the Hibs support for his long service and the memorable moments he helped to provide. Duncan left Hibernian in 1984 and signed for Meadowbank Thistle, where he retired after the 1986\u201387 season. He then worked as a physiotherapist for Meadowbank, and continued in this role after Meadowbank Thistle moved to Livingston (becoming Livingston FC). He later emigrated to New Zealand.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hibernian F.C.", "response": ["Arthur Duncan holds the record for most league appearances for Hibs, with 446.

Riordan bounced back by scoring both goals in a 2\u20131 win against Motherwell the following weekend. He registered his 100th goal for Hibs in all competitions during a 2\u20131 defeat at Kilmarnock in December. Riordan was the first player to achieve this milestone since Arthur Duncan thirty years ago. A goal against Hamilton in March 2011 meant that Riordan became the third highest goalscorer in the Scottish Premier League era, behind only the prolific Old Firm goalscorers Kris Boyd and Henrik Larsson."]}, {"page": "Edinburgh derby", "response": ["|Arthur Duncan", "|Arthur Duncan"]}, {"page": "Willie MacFarlane (footballer, born 1930)", "response": ["MacFarlane \"oversaw the early stages of one of the finest ever Hibernian sides\".
