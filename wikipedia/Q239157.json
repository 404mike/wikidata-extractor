His work is still held as a classic of ethnography.\nCodrington wrote, \"One of the first duties of a missionary is to try to understand the people among whom he works,\" and he himself reflected a deep commitment to this value. Codrington worked as headmaster of the Melanesian Mission school on Norfolk Island from 1867 to 1887. Over his many years with the Melanesian people, he gained a deep knowledge of their society, languages, and customs through a close association with them. He also intensively studied \"Melanesian languages\", including the Mota language.", "link_mentions": {}}}
