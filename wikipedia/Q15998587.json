Vickers chief test pilot Joseph Summers flew K4049 on its first flight, accompanied by Wallis and Trevor Westbrook. The aircraft soon came to be widely regarded as being an advanced design for its era and proved to have considerable merit during its flight trials.Andrews 1967, pp. 6\u20137. On 19 April 1937, K4049 was destroyed by an accident during a service test flight by Maurice Hare. The cause was the failure of the elevator's horn balance due to excessive slipstream exposure, leading to the aircraft inverting and rapidly descending into terrain. It was destroyed in the crash, which also resulted in the death of Smurthwaite the navigator.Andrews 1967, p. 7. The horn balances would later be deleted from the design, and did not feature on production aircraft."]}, {"page": "Supermarine Stranraer", "response": ["During 1933, a contract was placed for a single prototype powered by two  Bristol Pegasus IIIM engines and the type became known as the Stranraer.

On 24 October 1934, the Stranraer prototype was delivered to the Marine Aircraft Experimental Establishment (MAEE) at RAF Felixstowe for official trials.Andrews and Morgan 1981, pp. 136-137.
