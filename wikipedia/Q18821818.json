She called it \"The Temporary Home for Lost and Starving Dogs\" and it was founded in North London in 1860. Initially the home was in her scullery but as the number of dogs delivered to her grew she hired some nearby stables funded by herself, her brother and Sarah Major. In 1860 the RSPCA agreed to assist and the committee meetings were held at the RSPCA offices at 12 Pall Mall. The Times ran a story ridiculing the idea of opening a \"home\" for dogs when there were homeless people in London. It accused Tealby of \"letting her zeal ...outrun her discretion\". Its most impressive supporter in the 1860s was Charles Dickens. He wrote about a \"remarkable institution\" that had saved \"over a thousand\" dogs in 1860. He noted that the dogs were cared for but if necessary humanely disposed of. By 1864 the finances were sound and they were handling 2,000 dogs that year.", "On 17 March 2015, Queen Elizabeth II unveiled a plaque to officially open the intake kennels named after their founder, Mary Tealby kennels.
