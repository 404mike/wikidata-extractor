Although the Beijing Municipal Government, in its bid file in 2001, committed to lowering air pollution, increasing environmental protection, and introducing environmental technology, research data show that even if the city were to dramatically cut down its emissions, pollution would still drift over from neighbouring provinces, upstream from which 50 percent of Beijing's air was believed to flow. Air pollution was at least two to three times higher than levels deemed safe by the World Health Organization. Marco Cardinale of the British Olympic Association has stated that air pollution coupled with heat and humidity makes it \"very unlikely we'll see outstanding performances in endurance sports.\" Despite this, Beijing committed to remove 60,000 taxis and buses from the roads by the end of 2007 and relocate 200 local factories, including a prominent steel factory, before the games began. The Chinese government provided assurances that \"blue skies are a requirement not only for Beijing, but also for the places around it.\" The United States Olympic Committee was confident that the air quality of Beijing would not be a concern for the US delegation to the games. Nevertheless, the IOC's medical commission analysed air-quality data recorded by the Beijing Environment Protection Bureau in August, when test athletic events were held in the Chinese capital. The commission found that outdoor endurance events\u2014defined as those that include at least an hour of continuous, high-intensity physical effort\u2014may pose some risk."]}, {"page": "Great Britain men's national handball team", "response": ["| 2003-2004|| Marco Cardinale || Italian ||"]}, {"page": "Cardinale", "response": ["* Marco Cardinale, Italian sports scientist and administrator"]}]}}
