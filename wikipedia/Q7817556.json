He was primarily a right-handed batsman, but was also a useful right-arm medium pace bowler and a slip fielder.\nAssociated with Kew CC he accepted an engagement with Surrey and played for the county from 1919 to 1932, being a regular in the first team from 1921 onwards following an outstanding season for the second eleven (i.e. the reserve side) in 1920 (scoring 709 runs at 101.28 and taking 38 wickets at 15.50). In 1921 he scored double hundreds in successive matches against Lancashire and Kent.In all first-class cricket he scored 18,719 runs at an average of 39.82, including 42 centuries. His highest score was 277* against Gloucestershire at The Oval in 1927, made in just four and three-quarter hours, he and Andy Ducat adding 289 in two and three-quarter hours for the fourth wicket. That season he scored 2,145 runs at 55.00. He reached his thousand runs for the season in eleven successive years from 1921 to 1931. He had a fine temperament, and was capable of attacking or defending as the situation demanded. His pull and his offside shots were noted for their power.\nHe took 445 wickets at an average of 30.73, his best innings figures being 6/78. He held 275 catches.\nHe appeared in Test Trial matches and for the Players against the Gentlemen, but was never selected for a Test. After retiring from Surrey, he was head groundsman and coach for Wandgas Cricket Club in Worcester Park until his death.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Surrey County Cricket Club", "response": ["*  Tom Shepherd"]}, {"page": "1992 CFL season", "response": ["*Commissioner's Award - Tom Shepherd, Saskatchewan Roughriders"]}, {"page": "Thomas Shepherd", "response": ["* Tom Shepherd (1889\u20131957), English cricketer who played for Surrey"]}, {"page": "Arthur Pothecary", "response": ["Pothecary represented Hampshire in 268 first-class matches from 1927 until the Second World War and played a further three for the county after the war in 1946, with his final appearance for the county coming in 1946 against Sussex at Dean Park Cricket Ground, Bournemouth. In his 271 matches for the county, Pothecary scored 9,447 runs at a batting average of 23.34, with 47 half centuries, 9 centuries and a high score of 130 against the touring New Zealanders in 1937. Pothecary scored over 1,000 runs in a season on four occasions: 1933, 1936, 1937 and 1938. With the ball Pothecary took 52 wickets at a bowling average of 41.14, with best figures of 4/47 which came on debut against Surrey; Pothecary's wickets included Jack Hobbs, Andy Sandham, Alfred Jeacocke and Tom Shepherd.

Here, in Batsman's Paradise, he describes in two sentences a rare appearance in higher company for the Surrey stalwart Tom Shepherd, in a Test trial at Lord's in 1927:", "That he proceeded to engage with Leyland in a stand of over 200, driving beautifully and seeming never for a moment at a loss with the wiliest bowlers in the kingdom, never surprised me for a moment; that his innings of 90 or so was very correctly singled out as one of the gems of the match was entirely right and proper and to be expected. That the selectors would never do anything about it, or that he would never get his chance to appear in any other representative matches of any kind, was almost as inevitable a corollary; and Tom Shepherd from that time forth obediently and I do not doubt quite contentedly continued to bat and bowl at the Oval, where he was known and honoured and knew his way about.Ronald Mason, Batsman\u2019s Paradise: An Anatomy of Cricketomania, Hollis & Carter, London, 1955, p. 70."]}, {"page": "Commissioner's Award", "response": ["*1992 - Tom Shepherd, Saskatchewan Roughriders"]}, {"page": "History of English cricket from 1919 to 1939", "response": ["Surrey had a strong team in the 1920s but then fell away, after Jack Hobbs retired, to be a mid-table one through most of the 1930s.

Surrey's best bowlers were Bill Hitch, Alf Gover and Percy Fender. They could also call upon Maurice Allom, Alan Peach, Tom Rushby and Eddie Watts.
