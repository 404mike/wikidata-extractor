On 5 March, Vale inflicted a 4\u20133 win over Bradford City, soon after which Sam Baum was signed from Bolton Wanderers just two minutes before the transfer deadline closed. On 15 April, the club saw its first five-figure crowd of the season, as promotion-chasing Hull City took away both the points despite a brace from Roberts. Revenge came at Anlaby Road three days later, when the \"Valiants\" held a clean sheet to damage the \"Tigers\" promotion prospects. On the final home game of the season a seventeen-year-old Alf Bellis scored on his debut as Vale beat Rochdale 4\u20131.", "On the financial side, a bare profit of some \u00a3300 was recorded, due to a transfer credit of \u00a32,900. The annual summer clear-out saw the departure of fourteen of the twenty-six players, including Sam Baum; Spencer Evans (Northwich Victoria); Roderick Welsh; Charlie Rattray (Accrington Stanley); Harry Johnson (Hartlepools United); Trevor Rhodes; and Fred Obrey (who was sold to Tranmere Rovers). At the season's end the club were delighted to hear they had been transferred to the Third Division South, where gate receipts were higher. On 27 June another meeting at the Grand Hotel (Hanley) saw the issue of a name change debated, where Stoke United and Stoke North End were again considered. A change of name was advocated by every letter written in by supporters, however once again there was insufficient time to implement a name change before the upcoming season.", "|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Sam Baum", "| March 1938 || MF ||  || Sam Baum || Bolton Wanderers || Free transfer || ", "| May 1938 || MF ||  || Sam Baum ||  || Released || "]}, {"page": "Deaths in June 2002", "response": ["*Sam Baum, 88, English footballer."]}]}}
