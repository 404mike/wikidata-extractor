She was a member of Chumbawamba from their formation in 1982 until their disbandment in 2012. She joined Boff Whalley, Danbert Nobacon and Midge and Tomi in 1982 to form the original line-up, and the band made their live debut in January of that year.The band gained a reputation for their anarchist views, and gained popularity for their opposition to homophobia and fascism and support of feminism and gay rights.Watts provided lead vocals for the band's hit song \"Tubthumping\", which gained them international recognition, and topped charts in Australia, Canada, Ireland, Italy and New Zealand as well as \"Tubthumping\"'s follow-up song Amnesia, which reached number 10 on the UK Singles Chart. They were also nominated for a Brit Award for \"Best British Single\" at the 1998 Brit Awards, at which they also performed.\nAlong with Abbott, Whalley, Ferguson and Moody, Watts continued to work with the group and provide vocals, even after the majority of the original band members had departed and featured a shift in music style. She featured as a lead vocalist up until the band's last performances in 2012, becoming one of the band's longest serving members.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Chumbawamba", "response": ["Chumbawamba formed in Burnley in 1982 with an initial line-up of Allan \"Boff\" Whalley, Danbert Nobacon (born Nigel Hunter), Midge and Tomi, all four previously members of the band Chimp Eats Banana, shortly afterwards joined by Lou Watts.Glasper, Ian (2006) The Day the Country Died: a History of Anarcho-punk 1980\u20131984, Cherry Red Books, , pp. 375\u2013384  The band made their live debut in January 1982. Their first vinyl release was a track (\"Three Years Later\") on the Crass Records compilation album Bullshit Detector 2.  They were initially inspired musically by bands as diverse as the Fall, PiL, Wire, and Adam and the Ants and politically by the anarchist stance of Crass.  Another of the band's early releases was under the name \"Skin Disease\", parodying the Oi! bands of the time so successfully that they were included on Back On The Streets, an Oi! compilation EP put together by Sounds magazine journalist Garry Bushell.  By the end of 1982, the band had expanded to include Alice Nutter (of Ow My Hair's on Fire), and Dunstan \"Dunst\" Bruce (of Men in a Suitcase) and were living in a squat in Armley, Leeds on Carr Crofts road, with Harry \"Daz\" Hamer and Mavis \"Mave\" Dillon joining soon after.  Stalwarts of the cassette culture scene, the band released a number of tapes including Be Happy Despite It All and Raising Heck With Chumbawamba, and were featured on many compilations. Chumbawamba were at the forefront of the 1980s anarcho-punk movement, frequently playing benefit gigs in squats and small halls for causes such as animal rights, the anti-war movement, and community groups. The band's collective political views are often described as anarchist. They made several songs about the UK miners' strike, including the cassette Common Ground and a song dedicated to the pit village of Fitzwilliam, which was one of the worst cases of economic decline following the strike.", "*Lou Watts \u2013 lead vocals, keyboards (1982\u20132012)", " bar:Lou      text:Lou Watts"]}, {"page": "Burnley", "response": ["Musicians born in the town include Danbert Nobacon, Alice Nutter, Lou Watts and Boff Whalley (all of Chumbawamba),A Chumbawumba FAQ.
