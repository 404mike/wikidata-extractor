Canrobert's 1st Division and to Canrobert's left Prince Napoleon's 3rd division were unable to cross the river in the face of heavy fire coming from Telegraph Hill, and their advance stalled. Prince Napoleon sent word to Gen. George de Lacy Evans, 2nd Division's commander on his left, calling on the British to advance and take some pressure off the French. Raglan was still waiting for the French attack to succeed before committing British troops, and at first told Evans not to take orders from the French, but under pressure from Evans, he relented. At 14:45, he commanded the British Light, 1st and 2nd Divisions to advance, although without further orders. The British army was arrayed in two lines; the first consisted of the Light Division on the left led by Sir George Brown and Lacy Evans' 2nd Division on the right. Behind them was a second line - the 1st Division under Duke of Cambridge, consisting of the Highland and the Guards Brigades, which were deployed to support the first line's advance.

During the battle Troubridge and the Royal Fusiliers engaged the left wing of the Kazan regiment, and Troubridge led his forces under heavy fire on an assault on the fortified heights. He remained with the Royal Fusiliers during their operations in support of the allied Siege of Sevastopol, and then saw action at Inkerman on 5 November 1854. At Inkerman Troubridge was the field officer of the day, and was in the reserve of the light division in the Lancaster battery. The position was attacked by Russian troops, and came under heavy fire from Russian guns brought up on the east of the Careenage Ravine to enfilade them. Meeting heavy resistance the Russians concentrated their forces against the battery, and in the desperate fighting that followed Troubridge was wounded by a shot which carried off his right leg and left foot. He refused to be removed from the position, and remained at his post for the next two hours until the attack was beaten off, his limbs propped up on a gun carriage to prevent him from bleeding to death.
