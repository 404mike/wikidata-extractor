The company was founded in April 2008 by Gary Liddon, Billy Thomson, and Gareth Noyce. Thomson had been the lead designer for Crackdown and all three had worked at Xen Group, which provided technology for that game. Upon its establishment, Ruffian Games began work on Crackdown 2, which was released in 2010. The game did not sell enough to develop a third Crackdown game and the studio joined several co-development projects, including several Kinect games, to stay afloat. Game of Glens and Hollowpoint were cancelled, while a Streets of Rage remake was unsuccessfully pitched. After working with Rockstar Games since at least October 2019, Ruffian Games was acquired by the publisher's parent company, Take-Two Interactive, in October 2020 and became part of Rockstar Games as Rockstar Dundee.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Thalamus Ltd", "response": ["Thalamus Ltd was created in 1986 as an in-house software publishing label of British magazine publisher Newsfield Publications Ltd, to take advantage of their leading position publishing computer game magazines, such as Crash and Zzap!64, during the mid-1980s.

Three of Zzap!64s reviewers\u2014Julian Rignall, Gary Liddon, and Gary Penn\u2014called the graphics \"amazing\", well-executed, and \"varied\"; but they described the audio as sparse. Rignall and Penn complimented the challenging gameplay and commented that its addictiveness outweighed any frustration experienced while playing. The three summarized by urging readers to purchase the game. Computer Gamer reviewer Mike Roberts praised Spindizzys gameplay, but mentioned that the screen's orientation can require a period of adjustment, particularly when using a joystick. Crashs reviewer called Spindizzy \"one of the most addictive\" ZX Spectrum games, noting its innovative use of shape changing, multiple view angles, and speed control. The audio was seen as lacking compared to the rest of the game, but was still described as good. Phil South of Your Sinclair gave the game high marks for graphics, playability, value for money, and addictiveness. He praised the ability to change viewpoints and the realistic movements of the character sprite. He also lauded the speed and quality of the graphics. Info assessed the Commodore 64 version four stars out of five, recommending it as \"a hot little number with much of the appeal of Marble Madness\" but better. Roy Wagner reviewed the game for Computer Gaming World, stating that Spindizzy \"has a lot to offer and is an excellent value.\""]}, {"page": "Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)", "response": ["Mortal Kombat was reportedly developed in 10 months from 1991 to 1992, with a test version seeing limited release halfway through the development cycle. As a demo version of the game, which featured only six characters (all male), became internally popular within Midway offices, the team was given more time to work on it, resulting in the addition of Sonya to the roster. Footage for the game's digitized characters was filmed with Tobias' personal Hi-8 camcorder. The final arcade game used eight megabytes of graphics data, with each character having 64 colors and around 300 frames of animation.Interview with Gary Liddon, Mega, issue 10, page 36, Future Publishing, July 1993"]}, {"page": "PC Leisure", "response": ["Rob Beattie, Kelly Beswick, Neil Blaber, Matt Bloomfield, Paul Boughton, Clive Bremner, Robert Browning, John Cook, Steve Cooke, Tony Dillon, Jim Douglas, Alan Dykes, Christina Erskine, David Fitzgerald, Rik Haynes, Ed Henning, Gordon Houghton, Fiona Keating, Steve Keen, Eugene Lacey, Gary Liddon, Chris Long, Declan McColgan, Steve Merritt, John Minson, Tony Naqvi, Matt Nicholson, Frank O'Hara, Lee Paddon, Russell Patient, Mike Pattenden, Mark Patterson, Gary Penn, Paul Presley, Matt Regan, Gail Robinson, Laurence Scotford, Garth Sumpter, Alastair Swinnerton, Jimmy Taylor, David Upchurch, Austin Walsh and Gary Whitta."]}]}}
