However, they declined, citing lack of time, due to the recording of their album Backwards.", "In 1995, the prolific, British electronic musician Luke Vibert debuted a project called Plug on seminal UK label Rising High Records, where he had previously released material under the name Wagon Christ. The Plug material showcased a different side of Vibert's repertoire, foraying into the genres of drum 'n' bass and jungle, which were reaching their peak in the British club scene.  Plug began with a series of 12\" EPs, each an anagram of Vibert's name; Visible Crater Funk, Rebuilt Kev and Versatile Crib Funk, the latter of which was moved under Rising High's sub-label, Blue Angel Records.", "In 1997, Trent Reznor invited Plug to remix the Nine Inch Nails track The Perfect Drug, which had been heavily inspired by UK electronic music.  There exists confusion about how Trent had come to know Vibert's work, with Vibert himself stating, \"I could never understand how I got it (The Perfect Drug remix) in the first place.  Somehow, Trent heard my stuff and really liked it.\" He added, \"Someone told me that Alex Paterson from The Orb played my Plug stuff for Trent and someone else told me that Coil played it for him.  All I know is that Nothing got in contact with me for the Nine Inch Nails remix and then expressed interest in releasing Drum 'N' Bass For Papa, so I guess I passed the test.\"  Nothing Records label-mate Jack Dangers of Meat Beat Manifesto (who likewise appeared with a remix on Nine Inch Nails' The Perfect Drug single) credited himself as having introduced Vibert's work to Reznor.  Dangers had been a fan of Vibert's, inviting him to remix Meat Beat Manifesto around the same time, on MBM's It's The Music single (under the Plug moniker) and the Original Fire EP (as Luke Vibert).  At the time, Vibert also had a standing offer from UK label Ninja Tune to re-issue the album.  Vibert ultimately opted to accept Reznor's offer with Nothing Records.", "However, a wealth of unreleased Plug material still existed, which would slowly find its way out in subsequent years.  In 2006, Todd Osborn and Tadd Mullinix's Detroit-based label Rewind Records released Plug's Here It Comes EP, which collected several unreleased tracks from the 90s Plug archives.  In early 2011, Luke Vibert would go back to Ninja Tune, the label which nearly released the Plug material in 1997, to inform them that he found some long-lost, never before heard DATs of Plug material, dated from 1995 - 1998.  Receptive to the material, Ninja Tune released it as the second, full-length Plug album, Back On Time, on January 9, 2012.  To date, it stands as the final release under the Plug moniker.", "After completing touring in support of Subliminal Sandwich, Meat Beat Manifesto would release a follow-up compilation, entitled Original Fire, on May 20, 1997.  Original Fire compiled new songs, remixes and updated versions of classic tracks from the band and became a North American exclusive of Nothing Records. Play It Again Sam opted against releasing it in Europe, due in part to the fact that some of the tracks had been previously released by them on earlier, European singles from the band, such as 1996's \"It's the Music\" single, which featured a remix from Nothing Records act Plug.  Amongst the remix artists on Original Fire, fellow Nothing Records labelmate Luke Vibert appeared once again, this time under his own name, as well as The Orb.  The band would release a music video for the song \"Helter Skelter '97\" in support of Original Fire, which was directed by band member Ben Stokes.  Stokes also directed the band's music videos for \"Edge of No Control,\" \"Asbestos Lead Asbestos\" and \"Fromage,\" as well as directing an early video for Nothing Records label-mates Nine Inch Nails, for their song \"Down In It\" (in addition to editing their \"Head Like a Hole\" music video).  \"Helter Skelter '97\" would also be pressed as a promo single CD by Nothing Records for radio airplay.  Nothing would also release most of the tracks from Original Fire on vinyl, under the name of the \"Radio Babylon\" promo-only, LP single.  The 2xLP version featured an exclusive, bonus remix from Luke Vibert.", "Squarepusher, much like label-mates Autechre and Plaid, came aboard Nothing via a licensing deal with Warp.  Squarepusher is Tom Jenkinson of Chelmsford, Essex, England.  After learning bass guitar and playing in local bands in his youth, Tom began taking an interest in techno and house music in the early 1990s.  Amongst his influences were Aphex Twin and future Nothing Records label-mate Luke Vibert, particularly with his work as Plug.  Jenkinson said of Plug's track \"Military Jazz,\" \"This track came on and, amongst the road noise and chatter, I heard what I thought was some sort of hip-hop track being played by a band.  As the track progressed, I became more intrigued, as it sounded like they were trying to play as if it had been programmed.  Then the Amen [break] came in, and I was floored; it sounded like a drummer playing breakbeats, and made me totally rethink my ideas of programming breaks.\"", "Nothing did not pick up Hard Normal Daddy for release, but did pick up most of Squarepusher's output through the remainder of the 1990s.  Music Is Rotted One Note was released on October 13, 1998, the same day as Nothing version of Big Loada.  The mini album Budakhan Mindphone followed on March 1, 1999.  The Maximum Priest E.P. was released July 19, 1999, which featured remixes from Nothing Records label-mates Autechre and Luke Vibert (under the name Wagon Christ).  The final Squarepusher album to see release on Nothing Records was Selection Sixteen on November 8, 1999.  Aside from Big Loada, all of the Squarepusher releases on Nothing Records were essentially identical to the Warp editions.", "The music would catch the attention of Trent Reznor and Nothing Records, which had just licensed Luke Vibert's Plug project from the Blue Planet label.  Nothing Records offered to license The Bowling Green from Blue Planet and Micko joined the label in November 1997. The Bowling Green would release The Receptionist E.P. on Blue Planet in 1998, as well as appear on compilations for electronic labels Law & Auder, Dot and Shadow Records.  Micko also began working on a debut album, opting to record in a home studio, appropriately named The Spare Room, in Ladbroke Grove, West London.  The resulting album, One Pound Note, was released in the UK on Blue Planet Recordings in June 1998.  Shortly after the release, Micko appeared alongside Si Begg on the John Peel Sessions.", "In 2015, Micko launched his own label, Landline Records, which released his sophomore album under his own name, entitled Yours Etc Abc.
