Their non-liturgical character has led writers to question whether they should be within the service, or indeed whether this was Monteverdi's intention. In some versions of Monteverdi's Vespers (for example, those of Denis Stevens) the concertos are replaced with antiphons associated with the Virgin, although John Whenham in his analysis of the work argues that the collection as a whole should be regarded as a single liturgical and artistic entity."]}, {"page": "Motet", "response": ["The compositional character of the motet changed entirely during the transition from medieval to Renaissance music, as most composers abandoned the use of a repeated figure as a cantus firmus. Guillaume Dufay was a transitional figure in this regard, writing one of the last important motets in the medieval, isorhythmic style, Nuper rosarum flores, in 1436.Alec Robertson and Denis Stevens, eds., A History of Music, Volume 2 (New York: Barnes and Noble, Inc., 1965), 85.Edgar H. Sparks, Cantus Firmus in Mass and Motet 1420\u20131520 (New York: Da Capo Press, 1975), 86. During the second half of the fifteenth century Motets stretched the cantus firmus to greater lengths compared to the surrounding multi-voice counterpoint, adopting a technique of contemporary 'tenor masses'.Leeman L. Perkins and Patrick Macey, \"Motet, \u00a7II: Renaissance\", The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, second edition, edited by Stanley Sadie and John Tyrrell (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001). This obscured the cantus firmus' rhythm more than in medieval isorhythmic motets. Cascading, passing chords created by the interplay of voices and the absence of an obvious beat distinguish medieval and renaissance motet styles."]}, {"page": "The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians", "response": ["The fifth edition (Grove V), in nine volumes, was edited by Eric Blom and published in 1954.

This tendency was initiated by two earlier editions, that of Jack Westrup used in the 1925 Oxford performances, and Gian Francesco Malipiero's 1930 complete edition which sticks closely to Monteverdi's 1609 original. After the war, Hindemith's attempted period reconstruction of the work was followed in 1955 by an edition from August Wenzinger that remained in use for many years. The next 30 years saw numerous editions, mostly prepared by scholar-performers rather than by composers, generally aiming towards authenticity if not always the complete re-creation of the original instrumentation. These included versions by Raymond Leppard (1965), Denis Stevens (1967), Nikolaus Harnoncourt (1969), Jane Glover (1975), Roger Norrington (1976) and John Eliot Gardiner. Only the composers Valentino Bucchi (1967), Bruno Maderna (1967) and Luciano Berio (1984) produced editions based on the convention of a large modern orchestra.

The reciprocal British group scheduled to visit Czechoslovakia on a similar programme was unable to do so because of the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. Programmes with the National Trust in England, and the equivalent organisation in Denmark, continued into the early seventies.
