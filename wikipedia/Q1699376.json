Initially the character was seen offering financial advice to residents and buying the house of Emily Bishop (Eileen Derbyshire), in an arrangement where she would have the right to live in it for her lifetime, but on her death, Hillman would inherit the house. He then married Gail Platt (Helen Worth). Over the months, questions were raised about his trustworthiness, with suggestions of some irregularities in his dealings with people elsewhere. He left his business partner, Duggie Ferguson (John Bowe) to die after falling over a balcony. Hillman then murdered his second wife, Patricia, (Annabelle Apsion) and buried her under concrete at a housing development he owned. In late 2002, Hillman subtly made his wealthy mother-in-law, Audrey Roberts (Sue Nicholls), question whether she was experiencing the onset of dementia, through such things as unlocking doors she had locked, hanging out washing that she could not remember hanging out, turning on lights she had switched off and taking a dress in to be dry-cleaned, which she could not remember taking. Finally, he tried to kill her in a house fire, made to look like the result of her dementia, with Hillman removing the battery from the smoke alarm. She was saved by her friend, undertaker Archie Shuttleworth (Roy Hudd) and taxi driver Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson)."]}, {"page": "1950 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 1 February \u2013 John Bowe, actor"]}, {"page": "Tipping the Velvet (TV series)", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:left\" | Walter Bliss || colspan=\"2\"| John Bowe || bgcolor=lightgrey|"]}, {"page": "List of Dalziel and Pascoe cast members", "response": ["*John Bowe"]}, {"page": "Natalie Barnes", "response": ["Natalie starts rebuilding her life, and discovers that she is pregnant with Vinny's baby, but faces another blow on discovering that Vinny is dating her sister, Debs Brownlow (Gabrielle Glaister).
