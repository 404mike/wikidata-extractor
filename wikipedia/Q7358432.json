He founded Social and Community Planning Research, now known as the National Centre for Social Research, and the Centre for Comparative Social Surveys at City University.\nHe played a leading role in the establishment of several of the UK's leading social surveys, most famously the British Social Attitudes and the British Election Study. He made a major contribution to the development of robust comparative research through the International Social Survey Programme and the European Social Survey.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ume\u00e5 University", "response": ["* Roger Jowell"]}, {"page": "New Labour", "response": ["Once New Labour was established, it was developed as a brand, portrayed as a departure from Old Labour, the party of pre-1994Seldon & Hickson 2004, p. 5. which had been criticised for regularly betraying its election promises and was linked with trade unionism, the state and benefit claimants.Daniels & McIlroy 2008, p. 63.Colette, Laybourn 2003, p. 91. The previous two party leaders Neil Kinnock and John Smith had begun efforts to modernise the party as a strategy for electoral success before Smith died in 1994. Kinnock undertook the first wave of modernisation between the 1987 and 1992 general elections, with quantitative research conducted by Anthony Heath and Roger Jowell indicating that the electorate viewed Labour as more moderate and electable in 1992 than in 1987, arguably legitimising the arguments for increased modernisation. However, Smith's approach which was dubbed (sometimes pejoratively) \"one more heave\" was perceived as too timid by modernisers like Blair, Brown and Mandelson. They felt that his cautious approach which sought to avoid controversy and win the next election by capitalising on the unpopularity of the Conservative government was not sufficient. New Labour also used the party's brand to continue this modernisation and it was used to communicate the modernisation of the party to the public.Newman & Ver\u010di\u010d 2002, p. 51. The party also began to use focus groups to test whether their policy ideas were attractive to swing voters. Its purpose was to reassure the public that the party would provide a new kind of governance and mitigate fears that a Labour government would return to the labour unrest that had characterised its past.Newman & Ver\u010di\u010d 2002, p. 48. Blair explained that modernisation was \"about returning Labour to its traditional role as a majority mainstream party advancing the interests of the broad majority of people\"."]}, {"page": "World Association for Public Opinion Research", "response": ["Roger Jowell,"]}, {"page": "International Social Survey Programme", "response": ["* Davis, James A., and Roger Jowell. \"Measuring national differences: an introduction to the International Social Survey Programme (ISSP).\" British Social Attitudes: Special International Report, edited by Roger Jowell, Sharon Witherspoon, and Lindsay Brook.
