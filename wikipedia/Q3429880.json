During the 2005-2006 season Williams was the captain of the Cardiff Blues.\nEducated at Ysgol Iolo Morganwg (the Welsh-medium primary school in Cowbridge) and Cowbridge Comprehensive School, Rhys Williams is a versatile back, who has played at wing, centre and full back for Cardiff Blues, although full-back is his preferred position. He played here when helping Cardiff RFC win the Welsh-Scottish League title in 1999-2000.\nHe represented Wales at all age levels from Under 16 to Under 21, and played in the Youth World Cup in 1999 when Wales reached the final, losing to New Zealand along with fellow Cardiff Blues player Jamie Robinson. He made his debut for the full national side in a Six Nations Championship match against Ireland in Dublin in 2000, playing at full-back.\nIn the early part of the 2005 Six Nations, Williams was out of the Wales side with thumb ligament damage, but came on as a substitute against France when Gareth Thomas was injured. He did well enough to earn a place in the starting lineup as a winger in the following match against Scotland, with Kevin Morgan moving to full-back. Williams scored two tries, including an 80-metre effort following an interception. He missed the final match of the campaign against Ireland through injury.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Rhys", "response": ["* Rhys Williams (rugby union, born 1980), Welsh rugby player", "* Rhys Williams, in the BBC science fiction series Torchwood"]}, {"page": "Rhys Williams", "response": ["*Rhys Williams (rugby union, born 1980), Welsh rugby union player", "*Rhys Williams (hurdler) (born 1984), Welsh athlete", "*Rhys Williams (rugby union, born 1988), Welsh rugby union player who plays at centre for Llanelli Scarlets", "*Rhys Williams (soccer, born 1988), Australian professional association football player", "*Rhys Williams (rugby league) (born 1989), Welsh rugby league player", "*Rhys Williams (rugby union, born 1990), Welsh rugby union player who plays at hooker for Cardiff Blues", "*Rhys Williams (soccer, born 1995), American soccer player", "*Rhys Williams (footballer, born 2001), English footballer", "*Rhys Williams (Canadian actor) (born 1983), actor and stunt performer", "*Rhys Williams (Welsh actor) (1897\u20131969), Welsh actor", "*Albert Rhys Williams (1883\u20131962), Welsh-American political activist", "*Rhys Williams (Torchwood), portrayed in British science fiction series Torchwood", "*Rhys Williams, a primary character in the 1977 novel Bloodline, by Sidney Sheldon"]}, {"page": "List of Wales national rugby union team records", "response": ["| 9 || Rhys Williams || 2000\u20132005  || 18 || 44 ||  || Fullback"]}, {"page": "Rhys Williams (rugby player, born 1980)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Rhys Williams (rugby union, born 1980)"]}]}}
