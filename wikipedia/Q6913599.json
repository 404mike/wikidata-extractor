On the opening night, 25 May 1840, three pieces were presented: Summer and Winter, by Morris Barnett; a melodrama, The Sergeant's Wife; and a farce, The Midnight Hour. The opening was unsuccessful, and within a week the theatre was closed. Kelly's high admission charges of five or seven shillings did not help, but the main problem was that the tramping of the horse and the roar of the machinery drowned out the voices of the actors and caused the building to vibrate. The theatre had to be demolished to remove the machinery. After it was rebuilt, Kelly reopened the theatre in February 1841, at reduced prices, for a season of her own monologues, but then became ill. She sought to lease the theatre, but it was empty for long periods and was used mostly for amateur productions, including one of Charles Dickens's productions. Within a decade, Kelly had lost her entire fortune and was evicted from the property."]}, {"page": "The Colonel (play)", "response": ["The Colonel is a farce in three acts by F. C. Burnand based on Jean Fran\u00e7ois Bayard's Le mari \u00e0 la campagne (The Husband in the Country), first produced in 1844 and produced in London in 1849 by Morris Barnett, adapted as The Serious Family.  The story concerns the efforts of two aesthetic impostors to gain control of a family fortune by converting a man's wife and mother-in-law to follow aestheticism. He is so unhappy that he seeks the company of a widow in town.  His friend, an American colonel, intervenes to persuade the wife to return to conventional behavior and obey her husband to restore domestic harmony, and the colonel marries the widow himself."]}, {"page": "The Serious Family", "response": ["#REDIRECT Morris Barnett"]}, {"page": "Laura Honey", "response": ["Honey performed at the Royal Strand Theatre in 1832 in Loves of the Angels by Leman Rede. The following year, she performed at the Queen's Theatre and Prince of Wales Theatre. Next, she performed at the Adelphi Theatre.
