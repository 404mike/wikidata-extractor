The cognomen, or epithet, Faliscus, from which it has been inferred that he was a native of FaleriiSee e.g.  was first introduced by Barth, on the authority of a manuscript which no one else ever saw, and probably originated in a forced interpretation of one of the lines in the poem, \"At contra nostris imbellia lina Faliscis\" (5.40).
