Virginia Wetherell was cast as the female Thal named Dyoni, having previously worked with Martin. Dinsdale Landen was chosen to play Ganatus, but production date changes forced him to drop out of the serial; he was replaced by Philip Bond, with whom Barry had worked on No Cloak \u2014 No Dagger. The names of the Thals were revised in the final script: Temmosus was originally Stohl, Alydon was Vahn, Ganatus was Kurt, Kristas was Jahl, Antodus was Ven, Dyoni was Daren, and Elyon was Zhor. Four actors were chosen as Dalek operators, due to their small stature and muscular ability: Robert Jewell, Kevin Manser, Michael Summerton, and Gerald Taylor; Barry knew Manser as a sensitive actor who reacted well to voices, while Martin knew Taylor through repertory theatre. Due to the Daleks' electronic voices, it was considered impractical for the actors inside the machines to also deliver the dialogue. As a result, the Dalek voices were performed off-set by Peter Hawkins and David Graham. Barry contacted the Post Office's Joint Speech Research Unit for information on electronic voices. Two samples were provided: one using a vocoder with low and medium monotone pitch; and one using written computer characters, generating a sound which was less human but more time-consuming. While Barry enjoyed these methods, the BBC opted to develop its own method to achieve a similar effect, as some of the Dalek speech was required in studio during production. Martin worked with Brian Hodgson of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop to find suitable tones; ultimately, the actors spoke through a lip-ribbon microphone, which was later given an electronic quality after passing through a ring modulator."]}, {"page": "The Admirable Crichton", "response": ["| colspan=\"1\" | David Markham"]}, {"page": "Doomwatch", "response": ["Cast: John Paul as Dr Spencer Quist, Simon Oates as Dr John Ridge, Robert Powell as Tobias Wren, Joby Blanshard as Colin Bradley, Wendy Hall as Pat Hunnisett, George Baker as Mitchell, David Markham as Ellis, Mark Sinclair as Boy, Peter Whitaker as Ministry Inspector, Ron Gregory as Guard, Bill Wilde as Branston, Patricia Maynard as Miss Sephton, Rosemary Turner as Miss Jones, Brian Badcoe as Stephens "]}, {"page": "The Wednesday Play", "response": ["| David MarkhamWilloughby GoddardPatrick TroughtonSylvia KayJo RowbottomVictor LucasAnna WingJack MayKristopher KumDonald Morley"]}, {"page": "Tales from the Crypt (film)", "response": ["James Elliott (Robin Phillips) lives with his father Edward (David Markham) across from the home of elderly dustman Arthur Edward Grimsdyke (Peter Cushing), who owns a number of dogs and entertains children in his house.
