Beyond Destination, a show curated by Ian Iqbal Rashid and featuring contemporary South Asian artists including Sutapa Biswas and Alia Syed went on to tour internationally. Ikon replaced the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery as the venue for travelling exhibitions of contemporary art such as Diane Arbus curated by John Szarkowski, Chris Orr curated by Nick Serota, Objects and Documents featuring works selected by Richard Smith, An Element of Landscape curated by Jeremy Rees, The Human Clay featuring works selected by R.

Birmingham artists were prominent in several post-war developments in art: Peter Phillips was among the central figures in the birth of Pop Art; John Salt was the only major European figure among the pioneers of photo-realism; and the BLK Art Group used painting, collage and multimedia to examine the politics and culture of Black British identity.

The violence of a car wreck provides a counterpoint to that promise and is the subject of artwork by a number of artists, such as John Salt and Li Yan. Though English, John Salt was drawn to American landscapes of wrecked vehicles like Desert Wreck (airbrushed oil on linen, 1972).  Similarly, Jan Anders Nelson works with the wreck in its resting state in junkyards or forests, or as elements in his paintings and drawings. American Landscape  is one example of Nelson's focus on the violence of the wreck with cars and trucks piled into a heap, left to the forces of nature and time. This recurring theme of violence is echoed in the work of Li Yan. His painting Accident N\u00ba 6 looks at the energy released during a crash."]}, {"page": "Herbert and Dorothy Vogel", "response": ["* John Salt"]}, {"page": "List of Birmingham City University people", "response": ["*John Salt"]}, {"page": "Art of Birmingham", "response": ["William Gear \u2013 a student of Fernand L\u00e9ger and the only British member of the avant-garde CoBrA movement \u2013 had close links with Birmingham, exhibiting with the Birmingham Artists Committee and forming links with the Birmingham Surrealists in the 1940s, before finally moving to the city to teach at the School of Art in 1964.

Kessler,\" OK Harris Gallery, New York, 2006. Using damaged slides (often of family photographs or ordinary images) as the basis for airbrushed compositions, he was able to maintain the aesthetic principles of photo-realism while relying on the aberrations of the slides, such as light streaks or overexposed areas, in order to incorporate elements of abstraction into his paintings.Lindsey, Christine. \"Superrealist Painting & Sculpture,\" William Morrow and Company, Inc New York, 1980, . Writing in the 1980 publication Super Realist Painting & Sculpture, art historian Christine Lindey argues that Kessler's Ruined Slide Series distinguished him from other photo-realists given that \"he is not concerned with the associations which photographs conjure up, nor with using them to attain distance or dislocation of context, but deals with the distortions of reality created by photographic mistakes.\" Writing in Art in America, critic David Tannous described the Ruined Slide Series as dealing simultaneously with \"two different levels of reality: that of a 'ruined' photographic slide...and that of the 'actual scene' depicted by the slide.\"Tannous, David. \"David Kessler at Gallery 4,\" Art in America, July/August 1977 Tannous' favorable review of his 1977 solo exhibition at Gallery 4 in Alexandria, Virginia expanded Kessler's audience beyond the Southwest, catapulting his career.\"Painter Tries to Make Work as Seductive as Possible,\" Arizona Republic, 9 December 1981. The Ruined Slide Series was shown in a number of venues across the United States, and later in the 2003 exhibition \"Hyperrealismes USA 1965-1975\" at the Strasbourg Museum of Contemporary Art in France, which featured works by Chuck Close, Malcolm Morley, and Audrey Flack as well. A review of Hyperrealismes USA 1965-1975 in Art in America identified Kessler's Light Struck Cadillac (1976\u201377), which shows an overexposed image of a car in a showroom, as a \"gentle parody of the worshipful car paintings of John Salt, Don Eddy, and Robert Bechtle,\" who were also included in the show.Belasco, Daniel. \"Report from Strasbourg: Reality Show,\" Art in America, March 2004"]}, {"page": "Salt, John", "response": ["#redirectJohn Salt"]}, {"page": "Deaths in December 2021", "response": ["*John Salt, 84, English artist.John Salt obituary"]}]}}
