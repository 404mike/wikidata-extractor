Robert McLachlan commented that his peer Edmond de S\u00e9lys Longchamps proposed the separation of T. plagiata from the other members of the genus Gynacantha as a distinct subspecies that he labelled as Tetracanthagyna. His decision was due to, in his words, the \"conformation of the 10th ventral segment in the female.\" Ferdinand Karsch refused to recognize the proposed classification as a valid subgenus in his 1891 book Kritik des Systems der Aeschniden. However, Robert McLachlan writing in the Transactions of the Royal Entomological Society of London, upon review of the available material stated that \"not only is Tetracanthagyna valid, but also that its relationship to Gynacantha is perhaps not so intimate as been thought.\" His analysis raised the proposed subgenus of Tetracanthagyna onto the level of a distinct species. With the reclassification of Gynacantha plagiata as Tetracanthagyna plagiata, it was rendered as the newly-erected genus' type species. Commonly known as the \"giant hawker\", it has also been named the \"gigantic riverhawker\"."]}]}}
