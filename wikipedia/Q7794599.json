Gilbert also preached in surrounding villages, often with great hardship and difficulty: at Ticehurst he was pelted with stones when the bells rang; at Bexhill he was plastered from head to toe in filth, and a large drum was played to drown out the sound of his voice until a woman put a knife into the drum."]}, {"page": "Cricket in Sussex", "response": ["The diaries of Marchant and Thomas Turner, another Sussex diarist, from East Hoathly, show that in the 18th century cricket was commonplace in the Sussex Weald.

The receipt was in respect of one shilling and six pence paid by the Duke \"for brandy when your Grace plaid at Cricket with Arundel men\". It is thought the brandy was bought to celebrate a victory.McCann, paragraph 1."]}]}}
