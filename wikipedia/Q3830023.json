Dwyer, however, was retained and promoted to the first team on a permanent basis. Victory in the Welsh Cup had qualified Cardiff for the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and Dwyer made his debut in continental competition on 17 September 1974 in a goalless draw with Portuguese side Sporting CP. Cardiff were eliminated after losing the return leg 2\u20131. Scoular was sacked in November as the club struggled in the Second Division and was eventually replaced by Frank O'Farrell. Dwyer's performances resulted in his selection for the Wales under-23 side ahead of a match against England at Ashton Gate Stadium in January 1974, helping his side to a 0\u20130 draw. Cardiff's results gradually stabilised under O'Farrell, with Dwyer scoring his first senior goal for the club in a 2\u20130 victory over Preston North End on 9 March 1974 after heading in a cross from Leighton Phillips.", "He played in the remaining two matches of the competition, a draw with Scotland and a victory over Northern Ireland. In 1979, he won his only cap for the Wales under-21 side after being selected as one of the side's eligible overage players for a match against England under-21s, along with his former Cardiff teammate Leighton Phillips. Wales went on to lose the match 1\u20130. Wales manager Mike Smith chose the pair to start in Wales' opening match of the 1979\u201380 British Home Championship, a 3\u20130 victory over Scotland."]}, {"page": "History of Aston Villa F.C.
