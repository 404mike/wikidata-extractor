The demand for education grew and in 1847, the school moved to RI's eastern wing, extending towards Bras Basah Road. Edmund Augustus Blundell, the Governor of the Straits Settlement, described the school as \"a female school designed for the education and religious training of the children of poor Protestant parents\" in 1855. In 1871, the school moved into a house, the George Family's Old Mansion at the corner of Bras Basah Road. In 1879, the school separated from RI and M. Nelson was appointed the school's first headmistress. Together with three assistants, she ran the school which had an enrolment of 77. Since then, 1879 has been officially regarded as the year of the founding of RGS."]}, {"page": "List of governors of the Straits Settlements", "response": ["|Edmund Augustus Blundell"]}, {"page": "Timeline of Singaporean history", "response": ["| 1855 || 21 March || Edmund Augustus Blundell was appointed as the Governor of the Straits Settlements upon the retirement of William John Butterworth."]}, {"page": "Index of Singapore-related articles", "response": ["* Edmund Augustus Blundell"]}, {"page": "List of governors of Singapore", "response": ["|Edmund Augustus Blundell"]}, {"page": "List of governors of Penang", "response": ["|Edmund Augustus Blundell", "* 1851\u20131855: Edmund Augustus Blundell was Resident Councillor of Prince of Wales Isle / Penang until 1855."]}, {"page": "Edmund Augustus Blundell (governor)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Edmund Augustus Blundell"]}, {"page": "Edmund Augustus Blundell (diplomat)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Edmund Augustus Blundell"]}, {"page": "Edmund Blundell", "response": ["* Edmund Augustus Blundell (1804\u20131868), British diplomat"]}, {"page": "List of chief secretaries of Singapore", "response": ["|rowspan=2|Edmund Augustus Blundell"]}, {"page": "Pahang Civil War", "response": ["The British Straits Settlements government maintained its policy of non-intervention throughout the beginning of the war. Any form of military assistance requested by Tun Mutahir was rejected and the British even used its influence to prevent further intervention of Siam, Terengganu and Johor.  In February 1858, Temenggung Ibrahim of Johor had written to Edmund Augustus Blundell, the Governor of the Straits Settlements complaining of the 'unfriendly sentiments' which the Governor had shown towards him, when he was prevented from sending help to the Bendahara, while Wan Ahmad was allowed to use Tekong Island as a base for his attack on Pahang. The Governor also refused the request for arms transfers from Tun Mutahir in a letter dated May 2, 1858. Determined to cool down the disturbances, Blundell visited both Pahang and Terengganu. On May 17, during his stay at Kuala Terengganu, Blundell extracted a promise from the Sultan of Terengganu for his non-interference in the conflict and the removal of Wan Ahmad from Kemaman. The second appeal that came from Tun Mutahir on August 6 was also rejected, citing that the Bendahara is harbouring the former Sultan of Riau-Lingga that could pose threat to British influence."]}, {"page": "Governor Blundell", "response": ["*Edmund Augustus Blundell (1804\u20131868), 6th Governor of the Straits Settlements from 1855 to 1859"]}]}}
