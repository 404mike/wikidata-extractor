After competing in the Ford Fiesta championship and the Porsche Carrera Cup he graduated to the production class of the British Touring Car Championship midway through the 2003 season with John Batchelor's Team Varta squad. He remained with the team for 2004 in the Touring Class, initially driving a Honda Civic Type-R but subsequently a Peugeot 307. For 2006 he rejoined the BTCC at its halfway point again driving a Peugeot 307 entered by Team Griffin Motorsport with sponsorship from Far\u00e9cla. He did not score any points in his first race back, and the team missed several races due to unreliable machinery. For the final round they converted the car to bio-ethanol, qualifying ahead of 6 other cars. For 2007 he and David Pinkney teamed up to drive Alfa Romeo cars for Gary Ayles in the series. He scored no points, and missed the final two rounds following the multiple collision at Brands Hatch. He is no longer racing in the series.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "British Touring Car Championship", "response": ["The rules previously allowed for a variety of different fuels in a bid to encourage more efficient cars.

A best-selling and prolific author of the late 19th century and the Edwardian period, Marsh is best known now for his supernatural thriller novel The Beetle, which was published the same year as Bram Stoker's Dracula (1897), and was initially even more popular, outselling Dracula six times over.Beetle by Richard Marsh, Wordsworth Editions, 2007, , pg. vii. The Beetle remained in print until 1960. Marsh produced nearly 80 volumes of fiction and numerous short stories, in genres including horror, crime, romance and humour. Many of these have been republished recently, beginning with The Beetle in 2004. Marsh's grandson Robert Aickman was a notable writer of short \"strange stories\".", "Richard Bernard Heldmann was born on 12 October 1857, in North London, to lace merchant Joseph Heldmann (1827\u201396) and Emma Marsh (1830\u20131911), a lace-manufacturer's daughter. Heldmann began publishing fiction during 1880, in the form of boys' school and adventure stories for magazine publications. The most important of these was Union Jack, a quality boys' weekly magazine associated with authors G. A. Henty (1832\u20131902) and W.H.G. Kingston (1814\u201380). Henty promoted the young Heldmann to the position of co-editor in October 1882, but Heldmann's association with the publication was ended abruptly in June 1883. After this, Bernard Heldmann published no further fiction under that name, and began to use the pseudonym \"Richard Marsh\" a few years later.", "Heldmann adopted his pseudonym on his release from jail, and fictions by \"Richard Marsh\" began appearing in literary periodicals during 1888, with two novels being published in 1893. Marsh wrote and published prolifically during the 1890s and the early years of the 20th century. He died from heart disease in Haywards Heath in Sussex on 9 August 1915. Several of his novels were published posthumously.", "File:Illustration by John Williamson for The Beetle- A Mystery by Richard Marsh-Page 017.jpg|Page-017", "File:Illustration by John Williamson for The Beetle- A Mystery by Richard Marsh-Page 155.jpg|Page-155", "File:Illustration by John Williamson for The Beetle- A Mystery by Richard Marsh-Page 187.jpg|Page-187", "File:Illustration by John Williamson for The Beetle- A Mystery by Richard Marsh-Page 279.jpg|Page-279", "Marsh blends crime with science fiction in A Spoiler of Men (1905), the gentleman-criminal villain of which renders people slaves to his will by means of a chemical injection. Despite his success with popular fiction, Marsh seems also to have aspired to serious literary production, and his novel A Second Coming (1900) imagines Christ's return to an early-20th century London. Current scholarly research describes Marsh as a writer with a good sense of the literary market but who often transcended the ideological and aesthetic boundaries that his contemporaries established.Minna Vuohelainen. \"Distorting the Genre, Defining the Audience, Detecting the Author: Richard Marsh's 'For Debt' (1902).\" Clues: A Journal of Detection 25.4 (Summer 2007): 17\u201326.", "*William Baker, \"Introduction\", in Richard Marsh, The Beetle, ed.
