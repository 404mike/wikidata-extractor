It is a coming-of-age story about a Bedouin boy, Theeb, who must survive in the wide-open Wadi Rum desert. The film takes place during the Middle Eastern theatre of World War I, in the wake of the Great Arab Revolt against the ruling Ottoman Empire. The film used non-professional actors from the Bedouin community in southern Jordan, and is considered a \"Bedouin Western\". It has also been described as a coming-of-age film. Theeb is an international co-production between Jordan, the United Kingdom, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar.", "The film premiered in the Horizons section at the 71st Venice International Film Festival on 4 September 2014, where Abu Nowar won the award for Best Director. It was nominated for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 88th Academy Awards, making it the first Jordanian nomination ever. At the 69th British Academy Film Awards, Theeb was nominated for Best Film Not in the English Language, where Naji Abu Nowar and Rupert Lloyd won the Outstanding Debut by a British Writer, Director or Producer.", "Bassel Ghandour wrote the script and shared it with Naji Abu Nowar with the idea to do a short film. Abu Nowar reverted and suggested this be a feature film, and from there the story begins. While preparing to do the film, Ghandour, Abu Nowar, and producer Rupert Lloyd spent a year in the desert living in Shakrieh village with the local community, learning the Bedouin lifestyle. Initially, the filmmakers planned to have women characters involved. This was hindered by the fact that they wanted to use non-professional actors and found no women from the Bedouin communities willing to act in a film. They considered bringing professional actresses but they did not know the Bedouin dialect, so the film would have lost some of its authenticity. Jack Fox as the British officer was the only professional actor involved; the Bedouins had never participated in any type of acting. Several workshops took place to prepare the Bedouin actors for the film, who were chosen by auditions.", "Theeb received positive reviews, and has been described as \"Bedouin-Western\" by some critics. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 97% approval rating, and an average rating of 7.60/10, based on reviews from 72 critics. The website's critical consensus states, \"Led by an outstanding performance from Jacir Eid Al-Hwietat in the title role, Theeb is a startlingly assured first effort from director/co-writer Naji Abu Nowar.\" On Metacritic, the film has received a weighted average score of 80 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating \"Generally favorable reviews\".", "| Naji Abu Nowar", "| Naji Abu Nowar, Rupert Lloyd ", "| Naji Abu Nowar", "| Naji Abu Nowar ", "| Naji Abu Nowar", "| Naji Abu Nowar", "| Naji Abu Nowar", "| Naji Abu Nowar, Bassel Ghandour ", "| Naji Abu Nowar", "| Naji Abu Nowar", "| Naji Abu Nowar", "| Naji Abu Nowar", "| Naji Abu Nowar", "| Naji Abu Nowar", "| Naji Abu Nowar", "| Naji Abu Nowar, Bassel Ghandour, Rupert Lloyd, Nasser Kalaj, Laith Majali ", "| Naji Abu Nowar", "| Naji Abu Nowar", "| Naji Abu Nowar", "| Naji Abu Nowar", "| Naji Abu Nowar", "| Naji Abu Nowar", "| Naji Abu Nowar", "| Naji Abu Nowar"]}, {"page": "69th British Academy Film Awards", "response": ["Theeb \u2013 Naji Abu Nowar (Writer/Director) and Rupert Lloyd (Producer)", "* Theeb \u2013 Naji Abu Nowar"]}, {"page": "Orizzonti", "response": ["| rowspan=\"4\" |2014 || Theeb ||\u0630\u064a\u0628||  Naji Abu Nowar || Best Director"]}, {"page": "List of Academy Award winners and nominees of Asian descent", "response": ["| Naji Abu Nowar "]}]}}
