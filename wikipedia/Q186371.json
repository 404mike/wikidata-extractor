Dawe was replaced by James May for the second series, where the show chose to focus only on car reviews, guest laps in the Reasonably Priced Car, the Cool Wall, and the Greatest Car Ever segment (exclusive to this series), with each episode also having a single short challenge. This strict format was later relaxed, with the third series showing more challenges, which became longer from the fourth series as the races and the cheap car challenges were introduced. By series 7, there were fewer reviews of \"affordable\" cars that the original show used to be about. In series 8, the hangar studio was refurbished, and from series 9 the show became almost entirely focused on longer and partially-scripted challenges, with one or two car reviews (usually only featuring performance cars) in each episode.
