He was accurate in length and when conditions were helpful he used all of his 196 centimetres (6 feet 5 inches) to extract steep bounce.\nBoshier took five wickets in an innings 23 times and recorded his best figures, 8/45, against Essex in 1957, besides also taking ten wickets in a match against Lancashire in 1960. Boshier took 108 wickets in 1958, the year he was awarded his county cap, and the same number, 108, in 1961, when he finished second in the English national bowling averages for the season, but failed so badly against the Australians that he was never considered for representative honours. The following year, a succession of injuries limited Boshier to ten games, and he never recovered from these setbacks, being released by Leicestershire at the end of 1964.\nA \"rabbit\" with no pretensions to batting ability, Boshier scored just 579 runs at an average of 4.32. Only once, against Gloucestershire in 1957, did he even reach 20 in an innings. In 1955 Boshier played his first nine innings without even scoring a run, which equalled a record set by Tom Goddard in 1923 and equalled by Seymour Clark\u2019s infamous 1930 stint with Somerset, whilst between August 1957 and July 1959 he played fifty-two innings without reaching double figures.\nHe was born at Leicester and died on 2 September 2009 at the age of 77 at Masham, Yorkshire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Leicestershire County Cricket Club", "response": ["Change came in the late 1950s with the recruitment of the charismatic Willie Watson at the end of a distinguished career with England and Yorkshire. Watson's run gathering sparked the home-grown Maurice Hallam into becoming one of England's best opening batsmen. In bowling, Leicestershire had an erratically successful group of seamers in Terry Spencer, Brian Boshier, John Cotton and Jack van Geloven, plus the spin of John Savage."]}, {"page": "Les Jackson (cricketer)", "response": ["Herbert Leslie Jackson (5 April 1921 \u2013 25 April 2007), known as Les Jackson, was an English professional cricketer. A fast or fast-medium bowler renowned for his accurate bowling and particular hostility on uncovered wickets, he played county cricket for Derbyshire from 1947 to 1963, and was regularly at, or near the top of, the English bowling averages. He played in only two Test matches for England, one in 1949 and a second in 1961. Jackson's absence from Test cricket was largely because his batting was so underdeveloped: his highest first-class score was 39 not out, and he reached 30 on only two other occasions. Between July 1949 and August 1950, Jackson indeed played fifty-one innings without reaching double figures,Webber, Roy; The Playfair Book of Cricket Records; p. 317. Published 1951 by Playfair Books. a number known to be exceeded only by Jem Shaw, Nobby Clark, Eric Hollies (twice), Brian Boshier and Mark Robinson. His leading competitors like Trueman, Tyson, and even teammate Gladwin were far better batsmen."]}, {"page": "Deaths in September 2009", "response": ["*Brian Boshier, 77, British cricketer."]}, {"page": "Boshier", "response": ["*Brian Boshier (1932\u20132009), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Jim Griffiths (cricketer)", "response": ["He is however best remembered not for his bowling but for his inept batting, managing a career average of just over 3 runs per innings, which is the second-lowest by any regular first-class cricketer ahead of Francis McHugh of Yorkshire and Gloucestershire.See Bailey, Phillip; Thorn, Phillip; and Wynne-Thomas, Peter; The Complete Who\u2019s Who of Cricketers () Griffiths was out 51 times in his career without scoring and early in his career played ten consecutive innings without scoring a run,Bailey, Thorn and Wynne-Thomas; The Complete Who\u2019s Who of Cricketers, p. 414 breaking the long-time record of Tom Goddard, Seymour Clark and Brian Boshier.Webber, Roy; The Playfair Book of Cricket Records; p. 317.

His best season as a wicketkeeper was 1961, when he received his county cap and took 72 catches with 7 stumpings. As a batsman, he scored 561 runs in 1960 with an average of 12.46 and a highest score of just 44: the high aggregate reflects the fact that he went in at No 8 because in Terry Spencer, John Savage and Brian Boshier or Peter Broughton, there were usually three even worse batsmen than he was, and Leicestershire usually batted twice in each match. His highest score, one of only two innings over 50, was 51, made against Worcestershire in 1962 as a high-scoring match petered out to a draw."]}, {"page": "Bernard Cromack", "response": ["In 1960, in a very weak Leicestershire team, Cromack played in 20 first-team matches, often, in a brittle batting line-up, coming in as high as No 6, though he averaged less than 11 runs per innings for the season. With a bowling attack geared towards seam bowling with Terry Spencer and Brian Boshier, and an established spinner in John Savage, Cromack was bowled sparingly, and took only 28 wickets all season. The match against Middlesex at Lord's was his sixth first-class game, but to that point he had taken just two first-class wickets; he took six for 48 in Middlesex's first innings, the best bowling figures of his career. But then Leicestershire had to follow on and when they batted again they squandered a first-wicket partnership of 196 by losing all 10 wickets for a further 18 runs, giving the home team an easy victory. Two weeks later, he scored 55 against Hampshire, his highest score. There was a second half-century at the end of June with 53 in the game against Nottinghamshire. But Cromack's season subsided after that and he was left out of several matches in August."]}, {"page": "Rodney Pratt", "response": ["Pratt returned to county cricket in 1960 and for the next four seasons was a fairly regular member of the Leicestershire first team, usually acting as the third seam bowler after Terry Spencer and, often, Brian Boshier and batting around No 7 in the order \u2013 Leicestershire in this period had a very long tail. He had some successes as a batsman: in June 1960, for example, he made 71 against Hampshire and later in the same month there was 62 against Nottinghamshire. He did not improve on his previous best bowling figures in 1960, but in 1961 against Glamorgan, opening the bowling with Spencer, he took seven for 47 and these were the best bowling figures of his career. He took 65 wickets in 1961, and this was the best seasonal return of his career. Pratt missed the whole of the first half of the 1962 season, not appearing in the first team until July, a period in which Leicestershire failed to record a single victory in 13 County Championship matches. He then took 50 wickets and, although Leicestershire still finished at the bottom of the Championship table, in the last game of the season they came close to beating the Champions, Yorkshire, with Pratt taking 11 wickets in the match."]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1946\u20131977)", "response": ["* Brian Boshier (1961) : B.
