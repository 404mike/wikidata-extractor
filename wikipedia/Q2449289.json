After Fielding picked a groin injury in October, Legzdins returned to the starting line-up and kept his place after Fielding regained fitness in November. He impressed Clough with his performances, especially in the 2\u20130 win at Bristol City which ended a run of seven consecutive games without a clean sheet and a run of four away defeats. Saves against Steve Davies and Liam Fontaine were picked out by Clough, with one from Fontaine described as one \"down to pure size and presence, as well as quick feet to get across his line and block it. It was a very important save.\" Legzdins' run of 30 consecutive first-team starts ended in March 2013 when Clough felt the need for Fielding's greater experience ahead of Derby's 2\u20131 win against Leicester City. Five weeks later, Legzdins returned to first-team action after Fielding was sent off for a professional foul against Peterborough United, and he started the final two games of the season, ending the season with 33 first-team appearances. After Derby signed Burnley's Lee Grant in May, Legzdins was made available for transfer with a year left on his contract."]}, {"page": "Richard Keogh", "response": ["Upon Bristol City's return to the Championship, Keogh found himself frozen out, as manager Gary Johnson preferred Orr or Carey at right-back and two from Carey, Liam Fontaine, Jamie McAllister and Brian Wilson at centre-back.

Thus, he was loaned out to League One side Huddersfield Town on 31 August for an initial one-month spell, which was later extended for a second month. During his time at the club, he played in 10 of a possible 11 matches and scored a 90th-minute consolation goal in a 3\u20132 defeat to Cheltenham Town on 15 September.

Two goals in the first ten minutes from David N'Gog and Marcos Alonso and no reply from Wolves ensured they obtained the win and a fifth successive clean sheet at home. Bolton collected only their fourth away win of the season at Ashton Gate against bottom club Bristol City. A Liam Fontaine own goal gave Bolton the lead before Steven Davies equalised for City.
