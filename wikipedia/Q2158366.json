The two decided to share a Battersea studio, where they planned various unfulfilled schemes, including a new music magazine,Smith 1994, pp. 94\u201397 and, more ambitiously, a London season of operas and concerts. Heseltine declined an offer from Beecham to participate in the latter's English Opera Company, writing to Delius that Beecham's productions and choices of works were increasingly poor and lacking in artistic value; in his own venture there would be \"no compromise with the mob\".Gray 1934, p. 131 Beecham ridiculed the plan; he said it would \"be launched and controlled by persons without the smallest experience of theatrical life\".Beecham, pp. 175\u201377", "In Ireland Heseltine combined studies of early music with a fascination for Celtic languages, withdrawing for a two-month period to a remote island where Irish was spoken exclusively.Smith 1994, pp. 125\u201327 Another preoccupation was an increasing fascination with magical and occult practices, an interest first awakened during his Oxford year and revived in Cornwall. A letter to Robert Nichols indicates that at this time he was  \"tamper[ing] ... with the science vulgarly known as Black Magic\". To his former tutor Colin Taylor, Heseltine enthused about books \"full of the most astounding wisdom and illumination\"; these works included Eliphas Levi's History of Transcendental Magic, which includes procedures for the invocation of demons.Smith 1994, pp. 130\u201334 These diversions did not prevent Heseltine from participating in Dublin's cultural life. He met W. B. Yeats, a fellow-enthusiast for the occult, and briefly considered writing an opera based on the 9th-century Celtic folk-tale of Liadain and Curithir.Parrott, p. 72 The composer Denis ApIvor has indicated that Heseltine's obsession with the occult was eventually replaced by his studies in religious philosophies, to which he was drawn through membership of a theosophist group in Dublin. Heseltine's interest in this field had originally been aroused by Kaikhosru Sorabji, the composer who had introduced him to the music of B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k.ApIvor, pp. 187\u2013195"]}, {"page": "Poets' Corner", "response": ["| Robert Nichols"]}, {"page": "Oxford Book of Modern Verse 1892\u20131935", "response": ["*Robert Nichols"]}, {"page": "War poet", "response": ["In November 1985, a slate memorial was unveiled in Poet's Corner commemorating 16 poets of the Great War: Richard Aldington, Laurence Binyon, Edmund Blunden, Rupert Brooke, Wilfrid Gibson, Robert Graves, Julian Grenfell, Ivor Gurney, David Jones, Robert Nichols, Wilfred Owen, Herbert Read, Isaac Rosenberg, Siegfried Sassoon, Charles Sorley and Edward Thomas.Westminster Abbey: Poets of the First World War"]}, {"page": "The Faber Book of Twentieth Century Verse", "response": ["L.

The book is a kind of collective biography of the major poets of World War I, in the form of documented or speculated meetings between the individual poets, covering a period between 1914 and 1964.  The poets whose careers are described include Vera Brittain, Rupert Brooke, Robert Graves, Ivor Gurney, David Jones, Robert Nichols, Wilfred Owen, Isaac Rosenberg, Siegfried Sassoon and Edward Thomas. The title of the book is a variation on the title of \"Strange Meeting\", a poem by Wilfred Owen, which itself is taken from a phrase in Shelley's The Revolt of Islam.Wilfred Owen Association website.
