The project was under the leadership of historian, journalist and amateur diver Alexander McKee. Another group led by Lieutenant-Commander Alan Bax of the Royal Navy, sponsored by the Committee for Nautical Archaeology in London, also formed a search team. Initially the two teams had differing views on where to find the wreck, but eventually joined forces. In February 1966 a chart from 1841 was found that marked the positions of the Mary Rose and several other wrecks. The charted position coincided with a trench (one of the scour pits) that had already been located by McKee's team, and a definite location was finally established at a position 3\u00a0km (1.9\u00a0mi) south of the entrance to Portsmouth Harbour () in water with a depth of  (36\u00a0feet) at low tide.Wille (2005) p.\u00a0388 Diving on the site began in 1966 and a sonar scan by Harold Edgerton in 1967\u201368 revealed some type of buried feature. In 1970 a loose timber was located and on  1971, the first structural details of the buried hull were identified after they were partially uncovered by winter storms.Marsden (2003), pp. 30\u201334; Rule (1983), pp. 47\u201356.", "During the last year of the operation, the massive scope of full excavation and raising was beginning to take its toll on those closely involved in the project. In May 1981, Alexander McKee voiced concerns about the method chosen for raising the timbers and openly questioned Margaret Rule's position as excavation leader. McKee felt ignored in what he viewed as a project where he had always played a central role, both as the initiator of the search for the Mary Rose and other ships in the Solent, and as an active member throughout the diving operations. He had several supporters who all pointed to the risk of the project's turning into an embarrassing failure if the ship were damaged during raising operations. To address these concerns it was suggested that the hull should be placed on top of a supporting steel cradle underwater. This would avoid the inherent risks of damaging the wooden structure if it were lifted out of the water without appropriate support. The idea of using nylon strops was also discarded in favour of drilling holes through the hull at 170 points and passing iron bolts through them to allow the attachment of wires connected to a lifting frame.Childs (2007), pp. 197\u201398."]}, {"page": "1918", "response": ["** Alexander McKee, British journalist, military historian and diver, discoverer of the Mary Rose (d. 1992)"]}, {"page": "Bombing of Dresden in World War II", "response": ["The journalist Alexander McKee cast doubt on the meaningfulness of the list of targets mentioned in the 1953 USAF report, pointing out that the military barracks listed as a target were a long way out of the city and were not targeted during the raid. The \"hutted camps\" mentioned in the report as military targets were also not military but were camps for refugees. It is also stated that the important Autobahn bridge to the west of the city was not targeted or attacked, and that no railway stations were on the British target maps, nor any bridges, such as the railway bridge spanning the Elbe River. Commenting on this, McKee says: \"The standard whitewash gambit, both British and American, is to mention that Dresden contained targets X, Y and Z, and to let the innocent reader assume that these targets were attacked, whereas in fact the bombing plan totally omitted them and thus, except for one or two mere accidents, they escaped\". McKee further asserts \"The bomber commanders were not really interested in any purely military or economic targets, which was just as well, for they knew very little about Dresden; the RAF even lacked proper maps of the city. What they were looking for was a big built-up area which they could burn, and that Dresden possessed in full measure.\""]}, {"page": "French frigate M\u00e9duse (1810)", "response": ["* Wreck of the Medusa by Alexander McKee, a narrative account of the final voyage, shipwreck and aftermath originally published in 1976 under the title Death Raft and reprinted in 2007.

Buckley wrote that these critics concentrated on British failings; only a few hours after the landings began on 6 June, the British army was \"supposedly fluffing its lines\"; in 1962 the historian Alexander McKee described the D-Day rush on Caen degenerating into a \"plodding advance by a few hundred riflemen\", a failure which condemned the British to costly battles of attrition. Buckley wrote that critics had it that the British \"bungled matters again\" at Villers Bocage a week after D-Day, when the 7th Armoured Division was \"stopped dead in its tracks, apparently by the action of a single Tiger tank\". For the next few weeks, despite plentiful resources, the British attacks on Caen \"seemingly made little headway\", while the US First Army captured Cherbourg and the Cotentin Peninsula. After the capture of the Cotentin, the Americans pushed south and were poised for Operation Cobra by 25 July. The British Operation Goodwood, which had taken place east of Caen the week before, was written off as a \"humiliating failure\", with 400 tanks knocked out.
