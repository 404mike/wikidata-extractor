A few records also note a Jewish presence during the 18th and early 19th centuries. In the 19th century as the pogroms in Russia and Poland increased, the Belfast Jewish population increased from 52 in the 1861 census, to 78 in 1881 and 273 in 1891. There was very little religious conversion but an interesting noble exception was the Countess of Charlemont. The Hon. Elizabeth Jane Somerville, born on 21 June 1834, was the daughter of William Somerville, 1st Baron Athlumney and Lady Maria Harriet Conyngham. She married James Molyneux Caulfeild, 3rd Earl of Charlemont, son of Hon. Henry Caulfeild and Elizabeth Margaret Browne, on 18 December 1856. Her mother-in-law was a favourite in Queen Victoria's court. As a result of her marriage, Hon. Elizabeth Jane Somerville was styled as Countess of Charlemont on 26 December 1863. Soon thereafter she attended synagogue services in Belfast and converted to Judaism. She died on 31 May 1882 aged 47, at Roxborough Castle, Moy, County Tyrone without issue. There were no Jews in Moy, so her initial exposure to Judaism is worthy of research."]}, {"page": "William Meredyth Somerville, 1st Baron Athlumney", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Somerville, 1st Baron Athlumney"]}, {"page": "William Somerville, 1st Baron Meredyth", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Somerville, 1st Baron Athlumney"]}, {"page": "William Meredyth Somerville, 1st Baron Meredyth", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Somerville, 1st Baron Athlumney"]}, {"page": "William Meredyth Somerville", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Somerville, 1st Baron Athlumney"]}, {"page": "Apollo University Lodge", "response": ["* William Somerville, 1st Baron Athlumney, Liberal politician and Chief Secretary for Ireland"]}, {"page": "Richard Gorges-Meredyth", "response": ["He died without male issue, when his title became extinct.
