St Andrew's, Dumfries was chosen as the Cathedral church and parish. In 1947, the Apostolic Constitution, 'Dominici Gregis', erected the Province of Glasgow by creating Motherwell and Paisley as the two new suffragan sees. This same document also detached ten parishes in the north of Ayrshire and placed them in the Diocese of Galloway. This change resulted in Dumfries no longer being central to the population of the Diocese as a whole, and convinced the then Bishop, Joseph McGee, that he should move his residence to Ayr, where he could be more available to his people. In the aftermath of the destruction of St Andrew's Cathedral by fire on 10 May 1961, Bishop McGee petitioned Pope John XXIII (now Saint John XXIII) for permission to site the cathedral in the town of Ayr and to use Good Shepherd church as his cathedral until such time as a new cathedral could be built. This permission was granted on 12 March 1962, by a decree issued by the Sacred Consistorial Congregation. During the years that followed circumstances changed and no new cathedral was ever built.", "(1952-1981) Bishop Joseph McGee "]}, {"page": "Joseph Michael McGee", "response": ["#REDIRECT Joseph McGee (bishop)"]}, {"page": "Joseph McGee", "response": ["Joseph McGee could refer to: ", "*Joseph McGee (bishop) (1904\u20131983), Scottish Roman Catholic clergyman", "*Joseph McGee (general), U.S. Army general"]}, {"page": "Joseph M.
