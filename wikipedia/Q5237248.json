The historical existence of the custom in Scotland was also accepted in Scottish legal works such as James Balfour's Practicks ( 1579), John Skene's De Verborum (1597), and Thomas Craig's Jus Feudale (1603). English scholar Henry Spelman stated in his Glossary (1664) that the custom had existed in Scotland, but not in England. English jurist William Blackstone cited Boece's statement in his Commentaries on the Laws of England (1765\u20131769), while similarly noting that the custom had never existed in England.Commentaries on the Laws of England, volume 1, book 1, chapter 6, p. 83. In 1776, Scottish jurist David Dalrymple disputed the existence of the custom, arguing Boece's account was purely legendary, but his position was often seen as based on Scottish patriotism. However, according to Scottish legal scholar David Maxwell Walker, instances have been recorded of the jus being claimed up to the 18th century. Walker concluded that it is possible that the jus existed as a custom in Scotland, dependent on the attitude of the king, and survived longer in remote regions."]}, {"page": "David Walker", "response": ["* David Maxwell Walker (1920\u20132014), Scottish lawyer and academic"]}, {"page": "Regius Professor of Law (Glasgow)", "response": ["* David Maxwell Walker CBE QC MA PhD LLD FRSE FBA (1958)"]}, {"page": "1986 Birthday Honours", "response": ["*David Maxwell Walker, Q.C., Regius Professor of Law, University of Glasgow."]}, {"page": "Deaths in January 2014", "response": ["*David Maxwell Walker, 93, Scottish lawyer and academic.Death of Glasgow's Professor David Walker"]}, {"page": "2014 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**David Maxwell Walker, 93, lawyer and academic."]}]}}
