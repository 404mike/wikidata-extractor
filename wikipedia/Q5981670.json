They were later augmented by Ian Gomm on guitar and vocals.", "Later in 1970, Brinsley Schwarz released their second album, Despite It All, which had a definite country sound to it. They were heavily influenced by Eggs over Easy, who they first saw perform at 'The Tally Ho' in Kentish Town, and admired their laid-back style and extensive repertoire. In 1971, guitarist Ian Gomm joined the band, and they recorded their third album Silver Pistol. In response to \"the hype\", they became anti-commercial and spent much of 1971 rehearsing, although they toured on the 'Downhome Rhythm Kings' package with Help Yourself and Ernie Graham (ex Eire Apparent), who were all managed by Dave Robinson.  This led to them backing Ernie Graham on his eponymous solo album.", "Nick Lowe and Ian Gomm both began solo careers, achieving moderate mainstream success. Lowe's 1978 album Jesus of Cool received considerable critical acclaim and reached number 22 in the UK Albums Chart. It included the track \"I Love the Sound of Breaking Glass\", which reached number 7 in the UK Singles Chart. The album also included Bob Andrews on keyboard and Dave Edmunds on guitar.  Lowe also co-wrote Dr. Feelgood's top ten hit \"Milk and Alcohol\", which reached number 9 in 1979. Lowe's 1979 single and biggest worldwide hit \"Cruel to Be Kind\" was co-written with Gomm and originally recorded by Brinsley Schwarz for their unreleased final album.
