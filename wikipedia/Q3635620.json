Basil Lubbock's The Opium Clippers, cited in the original entry, is quite clear (p.347) that the Double Island in question was that at what was then called Swatow (today Shantou). The island is one of two that lie in the entrance to the river at Shantou and is the inner one, then called Masu. Today it is called Mayu (). For corroboration see Mayers & Dennys,William Frederick Mayers and Nicholas Belfield Dennys, The Treaty Ports of China and Japan (Hong Kong: Shortrede, 1867), p.236  for the identity of Double Island. For the typhoon and the damage to the vessels, The Courier (Hobart, Tasmania), 22 December 1858, p.3 for a report of Mr Midwood, of the Commissariat service, resident on Double Island during the typhoon."]}, {"page": "Legion of Frontiersmen", "response": ["*Basil Lubbock"]}, {"page": "Ariel (clipper)", "response": ["*Basil Lubbock, The Tea Clippers, Brown, Son & Ferguson, Glasgow"]}, {"page": "Sir John Lubbock, 2nd Baronet", "response": ["Lubbock was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Leominster from 1812 to 1820.

Joseph Conrad, who was born in Poland in 1857, came to Britain in 1878 and was naturalised in 1886. He undertook a voyage in a collier and then a wool clipper, obtaining a master's ticket in 1887. His last voyage in 1916 was in a Q-ship during the war. Conrad wrote many stories based on his experiences, such as \"Lord Jim\". Basil Lubbock went out to the Klondike and then sailed back from San Francisco on a grain ship. From this he wrote \"Round the Horn before the Mast\" describing the life of an ordinary seaman. After settling down in England he collected facts on sailing ships and wrote books about them. Alan Villiers first sailed in a British square rigger and then in Danish ones. He bought a small Danish fully rigged ship and sailed around the world. After his return he wrote books about square riggers. Many works of fiction have also been written, perhaps the most famous being the series on Horatio Hornblower by C. S. Forester."]}, {"page": "Marlborough (1876 ship)", "response": ["Two stories are often reproduced regarding the fate of the Marlborough, which have been debunked by author Basil Lubbock in his The Last of the Windjammers.
