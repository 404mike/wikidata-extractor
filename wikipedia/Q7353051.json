The result was wider and cleaner streets, more attractive places of commerce and business, repositioning of the old traditional markets, and a loss of the old smelly slum areas, but also the loss of many historical areas, town walls and gates, etc. and tradition.\nMost of Sutherland's songs laments the passing of the 'old toon' or the similar changes which took place to the riverside areas.", "link_mentions": []}}
