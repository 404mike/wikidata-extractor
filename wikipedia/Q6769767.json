He spent the first ten years of his career at Sheffield Wednesday, and by the time he left for Plymouth Argyle in 1987 he had made 282 league appearances for Wednesday. During his time in Sheffield he was named as the club's Player of the Year in 1981 and Wednesday twice won promotion and twice appeared in the FA Cup semi-finals. He switched to Barnsley in 1990 and was named as the club's Player of the Year in 1992. He signed with Notts County in 1992. He was loaned out to Port Vale, Huddersfield Town and Chesterfield, before he finished his career at Lincoln City in 1994. He then began work as a coach at various clubs, which included a one-game stint in charge of Sheffield Wednesday in 2004, in a caretaker manager capacity. He then returned to coaching, and also worked as caretaker-manager of Chesterfield in November 2015.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jack Charlton", "response": ["As the 1980\u201381 season came around Wednesday had young talent such as Mark Smith, Kevin Taylor, Peter Shirtliff and Mel Sterland breaking into the first team.

He scored his first goal for Wednesday in a 1\u20131 draw against Walsall in the league. His promising start to his Wednesday career took a knock as he was sent off in a League Cup tie against Coventry City for \"violent conduct\".
