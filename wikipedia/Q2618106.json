He never played a first team game, but made 120 appearances on the bench and earned the nickname Tony Bonus due to receiving many win bonuses. Warner had a spell on loan at Swindon Town in 1997.  The following year he had a brief spell on loan at Celtic due to injuries to both of their first-team goalkeepers Jonathan Gould and Stewart Kerr.  He made his debut for Celtic on 14 November 1998 in a 2\u20131 defeat away against St Johnstone.  A week later he kept goal in Celtic's 5\u20131 win over Rangers at Parkhead, and made his final appearance on 28 November in a 2\u20130 win over Motherwell.  Warner returned to Liverpool, but headed back north to Scotland in March 1999 for a two-week trial with Hibernian.  After his fortnight at Hibs, he instead joined Aberdeen on loan. He played six games for The Dons in April and May 1999."]}, {"page": "Wayne O'Sullivan", "response": ["On Friday, 18 May 2007, O'Sullivan was named Assistant Coach for A-League club Wellington Phoenix on a two-year deal.

With Gould out injured for a period of the following season, Lonergan snapped up his goalkeeping gloves and stood between the sticks for the first time in the league against West Brom, two years after his debut. Gould fell out of favour soon after, and Lonergan remained as the first choice until the end of that season. But this was short\u2013lived when Lonergan lost his first team place after breaking his hand, resulting in him being out for six weeks and missing out for the rest of the season. After returning to training in the pre\u2013season, Lonergan returned to the first team as first choice goalkeeper and on 2 October 2004 Lonergan scored a goal from his own penalty area in the 39th minute against Leicester City to equalise, after his long kick bounced over Leicester goalkeeper Kevin Pressman after defender Matt Heath had let the ball bounce. The game ended in a 1\u20131 draw. He remained at Deepdale for the 2004\u201305 season under the watchful eye of new manager Billy Davies, and played a part in 65% of the season before he ruptured his cruciate ligaments before a game against Ipswich Town, due to Lonergan's injury, Carlo Nash was signed as a replacement by Billy Davies from Middlesbrough to shore up the goalkeeping crisis. It wasn't the first time Lonergan suffered an injury: he broke his hand during training."]}, {"page": "Lee Mills", "response": ["Following the collapse of Telford United there was a race to Mills' signature, which was eventually won by Hereford United. Graham Turner having signed Mills, Mark Robinson and Jonathan Gould, looked to improve upon 2003\u201304's second-place finish, which saw the \"Bulls\" agonizingly close to automatic promotion to the Football League. Nine league goals from Mills in the 2004\u201305 season could not help United catch runaway champions Barnet, for a second consecutive season they crashed out in the play-off semi-finals. Four of his goals had come in the first two months, despite starting just five matches. Mills was released after the semi-final defeat, as was fellow veteran Graham Hyde."]}, {"page": "John Gould (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Jonathan Gould (born 1968), English footballer ", "*Jonathan Gould (presenter) (born 1961), British television presenter "]}, {"page": "List of Celtic F.C. international footballers", "response": ["*Jonathan Gould (2)"]}]}}
