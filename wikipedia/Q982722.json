(He is thought to have been the only person from the BBC's early radio service who had an enduring career in television.) Between 1946 and 1955, the BBC News was merely voiced over a photograph of Big Ben, a measure sanctioned by Chief News Editor Tahu Hole to reinforce the absolute impartiality for which the Corporation was renowned. However, the coming of commercial television and ITN in 1955 prompted the BBC to have its newsreaders perform to camera - indeed, they began this approach only three weeks before ITN began transmission. Dougall was among the first of these newsreaders to appear in-vision in 1955 (the others were his contemporaries Kenneth Kendall and Richard Baker with Kendall being the very first).", "Like Peter Woods, Richard Baker and Kenneth Kendall, Dougall was considered an archetypal newsreader and frequently appeared as himself in comedy programmes of the 1970s and early 1980s, including The Goodies and Yes Minister. He also presented seven series of Channel 4's over-60s programme Years Ahead over four years and appeared in an advertising campaign for the jewellers Prestons of Bolton during the 1980s. His voice provides the news announcement that Big Ben chimed seven times at 6 p.m. in the Bond film Thunderball (1965)."]}, {"page": "Tahu Hole", "response": ["In 1953, Hole was appointed to take overall charge of creating television news broadcasts. Up to that point, live news broadcasts had been in audio with the announcer/newsreader speaking over a still picture of the Big Ben clock. Once a day the Television Newsreel was shown, essentially a televised version of a cinema newsreel and intrinsically not fully up-to-date. In order to avoid what he described as the \"cult of personality\", Hole continued the audio-only tradition of broadcast news, making only a slight concession to the demands of television. Thus was born the News and Newsreel on 5 July 1954. This lasted about 20 minutes, the first ten being current news reports read out over captions, still pictures and occasionally a live human hand pointing to locations on a map; the remainder was filmed footage in the manner of Television Newsreel. The Spectator described this effort as a \"lamentably non-telegenic presentation of television news... at once singularly clumsy and unrealistic.\" Hole's austere approach was challenged by the imminent arrival of the competing ITN service in 1955 and it was three weeks before ITN's launch on 22 September of that year that newsreaders Richard Baker, Kenneth Kendall and Robert Dougall appeared in vision.
