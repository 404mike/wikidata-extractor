The memorial records the names of 9,903 officers and men of the forces of Great Britain, Ireland, and South Africa who were lost between 8 August 1918 and 11 November 1918 in the final Allied advances in Picardy and Artois, whose bodies were never found, and thus have no known grave. The soldiers of Australia and New Zealand are remembered elsewhere. The architect/designer of the memorial was J. R. Truelove, a former captain in the London Regiment, who also designed the Le Touret Memorial. Amongst those commemorated at Vis-en-Artois are three Victoria Cross winners, Chief Petty Officer George Prowse, Lance Corporal Allan Leonard Lewis and Sergeant Frederick Charles Riggs. The Memorial consists of a screen wall in three parts. The middle part of the screen wall is concave and carries stone panels on which names are carved. It is  high flanked by pylons  high. The Stone of Remembrance stands exactly between the pylons and behind it, in the middle of the screen, is a relief carving by Ernest Gillick representing St George and the Dragon. The screen walls to either side of that in the centre are also curved and carry stone panels carved with further names. Each of them forms the back of a roofed colonnade; and at the far end of each is a small building. The memorial was unveiled by The Rt Hon. Thomas Shaw on 4 August 1930."]}, {"page": "British Rail Class 800", "response": ["|Harold Day DSC /  Allan Leonard Lewis VC (Armistice Centenary Commemoration train)"]}]}}
