The Doctor's first companions seen on screen were his granddaughter Susan Foreman (Carole Ann Ford) and her teachers Barbara Wright (Jacqueline Hill) and Ian Chesterton (William Russell). These characters were intended to act as audience surrogates, through which the audience would discover information about the Doctor who was to act as a mysterious father figure. The only story from the original series in which the Doctor travels alone is The Deadly Assassin (1976). Notable companions from the earlier series included Romana (Mary Tamm and Lalla Ward), a Time Lady; Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen); and Jo Grant (Katy Manning). Dramatically, these characters provide a figure with whom the audience can identify, and serve to further the story by requesting exposition from the Doctor and manufacturing peril for the Doctor to resolve.

J. C. Trewin of The Listener enjoyed the serial, \"partly because no mechanical monsters arrived and partly because the logical consequences of time-meddling were faced\".

The scene had Ian and Barbara witnessing the dematerialisation of the TARDIS after Dodo enters. Although the scene was scheduled, it was cancelled at short notice and never filmed."]}, {"page": "Jack Harkness", "response": ["The character's introduction served to posit him as a secondary hero and a rival to the series protagonist, the Doctor, simultaneously paralleling the Doctor's detached alien nature with Jack's humanity and \"heart\". John Barrowman describes the character in his initial appearance as \"an intergalactic conman\" and also a \"rogue Time Agent\" which he defines as \"part of a kind of space CIA\" and alludes to the moral ambiguity of having \"done something in his past\" and not knowing \"whether it is good or bad because his memory has been erased\". Writer Stephen James Walker notes similarities have been found between Jack and Angel (David Boreanaz), the heroic vampire from America's Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel; Alan Stanley Blair of SyFy Portal pointed out that \"Back alley fights, knowledge of the paranormal and an unwanted task of defending the helpless are only a few of the correlations between the two characters.\" Jack has also been compared to the title character of America's Xena: Warrior Princess, which featured lesbian subtext between Xena (Lucy Lawless) and her close friend Gabrielle (Renee O'Connor). Polina Skibinskaya, writing for AfterElton.com, an American gay men's website, notes both are \"complex characters\" haunted by their past misdeeds. Furthermore, like Xena, Jack is \"a gay basher\u2019s worst nightmare: a queer weapon-wielding, ass-kicking superhero gleefully chewing his way through awesome fight scenes\". One academic article refers to Jack as \"an indestructible Captain Scarlet figure\". In a comparative contrast, where the Doctor is a pacifist, Jack is more inclined to see violent means to reach similar ends. The BBC News website refers to Jack's role within Doctor Who as \"[continuing] what began with Ian Chesterton and continued later with Harry Sullivan\". Whereas in the classic series the female \"companions\" were sometimes exploited and sexualised for the entertainment of predominantly male audiences, the producers could reverse this dynamic with Jack, citing an equal need amongst modern audiences to \"look at good looking men\". John Barrowman linked the larger number of women watching the show as a key factor in this."]}]}}
