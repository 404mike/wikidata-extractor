In 1880, the Australians toured England, making considerable money from gate receipts, something English cricketers, regarded as \"gentlemen\" did not do. Nottinghamshire's Alfred Shaw, however, saw this as an opportunity. He arranged a first-class match between the Players of the North and the Australians at Park Avenue, Bradford toward the end of the tour, which made Shrewsbury a healthy profit. A few days after this match, he hastily arranged a match between Nottinghamshire and the Australians at Trent Bridge. Seeking once more to make money, Shaw informed Holden that himself and six other Nottinghamshire players would only take to the field for a minimum of \u00a320 each. Holden agreed, albeit reluctantly, and was reported to privately fuming at the demand. In the Autumn, Shaw attempted to arrange an early season fixture for the following season against Yorkshire, with the view of once again profiting from it. Holden found out about this and told Shaw he alone did not have the authority to arrange county fixtures. He proceeded to write to all of Nottinghamshire's professionals, informing them they would have to sign a binding contract under which they would have to be available for all official Nottinghamshire matches.
