Soon after, Tommy Johnson doubled Derby's lead, having been put clear by Simpson with a chip.  Scott Sellars then halved the deficit with a free kick which took a significant deflection before beating Steve Sutton in the Derby goal, before Mike Newell levelled the match just before half time.  Midway through the second half, David Speedie put the home side ahead for the first time after he capitalised on a defensive mistake from Andy Comyn, before going on to double the lead minutes later, with the match ending 4\u20132.  The second leg took place three days later at the Baseball Ground in Derby.  Comyn put the home side ahead with a header from a Johnson cross only for Kevin Moran to equalise from a corner.  With fifteen minutes remaining, Ted McMinn scored Derby's second, making it 2\u20131 on the evening, but with no further goals, it meant that Blackburn won 5\u20134 on aggregate to qualify for the final.
