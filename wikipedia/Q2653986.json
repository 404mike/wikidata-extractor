Lascelles was the son of Henry Lascelles, 6th Earl of Harewood and Mary, Princess Royal, the only daughter of King George V and Mary of Teck. Lascelles was a first cousin of Queen Elizabeth II. He lived at the fort with his wife, Angela, and their son, Henry. Lascelles described the house as 'falling to pieces' at the beginning of his occupancy, and refurbished the fort, removing most traces of Edward's renovations in the process, except for the swimming pool and the battlements walk. The 30\u201340 rooms of the fort were reduced by the Lascelleses to the \"equivalent of an eight-bedroom house, including quarters for three or four staff. It will be a very manageable home\". Angela Lascelles remained dedicated to improving and renovating the house and maintaining the estate. The Lascelleses\u2019 restoration of the fort was undertaken by the designer Stanley Peters who took three years to return it to its 18th-century state; Peters faced difficulties in removing offices added when Edward became king. A mural added by Peters in the drawing-room, and painted by Oliver Carson, depicted Peters in an incidental role, portrayed in 18th-century clothes chasing butterflies. The Lascelleses later claimed the credit for Peters's designs and his career suffered irreparable damage as a result."]}, {"page": "Gerald David Lascelles", "response": ["Gerald David Lascelles (21 August 1924 \u2013 27 February 1998) was the younger son of Henry Lascelles, 6th Earl of Harewood and Mary, Princess Royal, the only daughter of King George V and Queen Mary.
