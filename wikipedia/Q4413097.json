She was selected for the initial issue of the long-running series entitled The Junior Book of Authors (1951\u20132008) and for the first, 1971, volume of Anne Commire's Something About the Author, which reached volume 320 in 2018. Savery's World War II novel, Enemy Brothers, received praise and remains in print. In 1980, at age eighty-two, she completed a Charlotte Bront\u00eb two-chapter fragment, which was published as \"Emma by Charlotte Bront\u00eb and Another Lady\". The book was translated into Dutch, Spanish, and Russian.Reared in a Wiltshire vicarage, Savery was prepared for university study at King Edward VI High School for Girls in Birmingham. Earning an Exhibition (scholarship) to Somerville College, Oxford, she read English, and in 1920 was in the first group of women to be awarded a degree by the University of Oxford. Seventy-five years later, she was honoured at Oxford as the last surviving member of that event. She remained active to the end of a long life, completing a handwritten, 692-page revision of an unpublished manuscript just prior to her ninety-ninth birthday.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Charlotte Bront\u00eb", "response": ["** Emma, by \"Charlotte Bront\u00eb and Another Lady\", published 1980; although this has been attributed to Elizabeth Goudge, the actual author was Constance Savery.Bronte, Charlotta and Another Lady.
