He moved to Bristol in about 1896, when he became involved in the trade union movement and joined the Bristol Socialist Society.  In 1904, he was elected as treasurer of the local branch of the Operative Bricklayers' Society (OBS).  He also became active in the Labour Party, for which he was elected to Bristol City Council in 1910, serving until 1920.  At the 1918 United Kingdom general election, he stood as the party's candidate in Bristol South, taking second place with 31.8% of the vote.In 1911, Lewis became president of the Bristol OBS, but resigned from the union in 1914. Instead, he joined the Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Labourers' Union, which was growing rapidly in the city, becoming its full-time Bristol District Organiser. Until 1917, he also served as the secretary of Bristol Trades Council.  This was a difficult period for the council, which was divided on its approach to World War I, ultimately deciding to oppose conscription but otherwise take a neutral position. In 1922, the Dockers' Union became part of the new Transport and General Workers' Union, Lewis becoming the financial secretary of its number 3 area.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Thomas Lewis", "response": ["Thomas Lewis may refer to:", "*Thomas Lewis (English cricketer) (died 1882), English cricketer", "*Thomas Lewis (Australian cricketer) (1829\u20131901), Australian cricketer", "*Thomas Lewis (American football) (born 1972), American football wide receiver", "*Thomas Lewis (of Harpton) (1518/9\u20131607), British Member of Parliament for Radnorshire, 1559\u20131567 and 1584\u20131587", "*Thomas Lewis (Wells politician), 16th-century MP for Wells, Somerset", "*Thomas Lewis (died 1594), MP for Monmouth Boroughs", "*Thomas Lewis (died 1736) (c. 1679\u20131736), British Member of Parliament for Buckingham, Portsmouth, Salisbury and Winchester", "*Thomas Lewis (Welsh politician) (1821\u20131897), Liberal Member of Parliament for Anglesey", "*Thomas Lewis Jr. (1760\u20131847), U.S. Congressman from Virginia", "*Thomas Lewis (1690\u20131777), British Member of Parliament for Radnor, 1715\u20131761", "*Thomas Lewis (Kentucky politician) (1749\u20131809), State Senator, prominent figure in the development of Kentucky", "*Thomas Lewis (1821\u20131897) (1821\u20131897), Welsh-born Australian politician", "*Thomas Lewis (Bristol politician) (1871\u2013?), British trade unionist and politician", "*Thomas Lewis (activist) (1940\u20132007), artist and activist", "*Thomas Lewis (astronomer) (1856\u20131927), astronomer at the Greenwich Observatory", "*Thomas Lewis (footballer), Welsh international footballer in 1881", "*Thomas Lewis (unionist) (1866\u20131939), president of the United Mine Workers of America", "*Thomas Lewis (Virginia politician) (1718\u20131790), American surveyor, Virginia pioneer", "*Thomas Lewis (cardiologist) (1881\u20131945), British surgeon and cardiologist", "*Thomas Lewis (industrialist) (died 1764), cofounder of the Dowlais Ironworks in 1759", "*Thomas Lewis (RAF officer) (1894\u20131961), World War I flying ace", "*Thomas Lewis (controversialist) (1689\u2013?), English cleric", "*Thomas Lewis (organist) (died 1674), English organist"]}, {"page": "Howell Davies", "response": ["At the 1918 general election Davies was the representative of the Coalition government and was opposed only by Labour candidate Thomas Lewis, over whom he had a majority of  7,352 votes.
