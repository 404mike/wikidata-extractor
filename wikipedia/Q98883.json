At the time of his birth he was Leon Charles Beurton. His first name appears variously as Len, Leon and Leonard, while his family name may be shown as Beuston, Benston or Brewer.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ursula Kuczynski", "response": ["She divorced later that same year, and early in 1940, while still in Switzerland, married her second husband. Len Beurton, like her, was working for the Soviet GRU, and like Kuczynski he came with an unusually wide range of names. He also came with a British passport, and by marrying him Agent Sonya automatically acquired a British passport too. Sent by the GRU she and her new husband now relocated from Switzerland to England where she would remain for the rest of the 1940s, and where her second son was born in the late summer of 1943. They had settled in north Oxford, but soon moved on to the first of a succession of nearby villages, settling initially in Glympton, and then in Kidlington. In May 1945 the Beurtons relocated again, to a larger house in the north Oxfordshire village of Great Rollright where they remained until 1949-50, becoming so integrated into the village community that both her parents, who were frequent visitors in Oxfordshire even after the war ended, and who both died in 1947, are buried in the Great Rollright churchyard. In each Oxfordshire property in which she lived Agent Sonya installed a radio receiver and transmitter (which during the war was illegal). Living in Oxfordshire placed them conveniently close to her parents who had emigrated to London after 1933, and were then living with friends in Oxford because of the air raids in London."]}, {"page": "Deaths in October 1997", "response": ["*Len Beurton, 83, English communist and Soviet agent."]}, {"page": "Rudolf Hamburger", "response": ["Finally, in the first part of 1939 Moscow agreed that Rudolf might undertake intelligence work with direct links to the service. On his own initiative, he spent two months in Paris attending a course on radio technology, although French was not one of his principal languages and there are indications that language difficulties reduced the usefulness of the course to him. When he got back to Switzerland the message came through that Moscow's first assignment for him involved a posting to China. Moscow had also communicated an instruction that before he left for China he and Ursula should formally divorce, which they did.  The Hamburgers' divorce opened the way for Ursula to marry Len Beurton in February 1940. Aside from any romantic considerations, this may also have been part of a longer-term Soviet plan. Len Beurton was a Soviet agent. More importantly, he was born in Essex, England, and by marrying him Ursula was able to exchange her recently purchased Honduras passport for a British passport."]}, {"page": "Maik Hamburger", "response": ["The marriage of Maik Hamburger's parents came under increasing pressure, ending in divorce in 1939. By the time he was ten, he had lived successively in China, Czechoslovakia, Poland and Switzerland, before ending up in England in 1940, after his mother had married Len Beurton, also a Soviet agent, and one who came with the added attraction of a British passport for his new wife. While still a toddler Maik Hamburger was separated from his parents and sent to live with his father's parents (now relocated from Germany to Czechoslovakia) for seven months, while his mother was sent to Moscow for a half-year training session in \"espionage spycraft\". There had been a concern that if baby Michael had accompanied her to Moscow he might inadvertently have blown her cover later by blurting out words in Russian.
