Rangers began their campaign against fellow Glasgow team Partick Thistle from the First Division, the third meeting between the two teams in two seasons. Partick had taken Rangers to a replay following a 1\u20131 draw at Ibrox in the 2007\u201308 Scottish Cup quarter-finals, a competition which Rangers went on to win. Kris Boyd opened the scoring with a stunning volley, but the lead lasted only eight minutes, with Stephen McKeown equalising for Thistle. Pedro Mendes scored the winner deep into extra time following a goalless second half. Hamilton Academical were beaten 2\u20130 at Ibrox in the quarter-final. Jean-Claude Darcheville found Kris Boyd, who fired past goalkeeper Tom\u00e1\u0161 \u010cern\u00fd after 25 minutes. Kyle Lafferty added the second from a Steven Davis cross. Falkirk were the next opponents. Two goals from Nacho Novo and one from Kris Boyd ensured a 3\u20130 victory at Hampden Park. After eight minutes, Madjid Bougherra flicked on Pedro Mendes' corner, allowing Novo to finish from close range at the back post. Goalkeeper Dani Mallo was beaten again five minutes from half-time when Steven Davis passed to Novo, who shot low into the corner of the net. Boyd added the third on eight minutes after a mistake by Mallo."]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Partick Thistle F.C. season", "response": ["| Stephen McKeown||4 (2)||1||0||1", "|  Stephen McKeown || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 2 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 ", "|12||Stephen McKeown||1||0||0||0||1"]}, {"page": "2003 Scottish Challenge Cup Final", "response": ["|MF ||15|| Stephen McKeown || "]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Ayr United F.C. season", "response": ["After relegation to the Second Division many players parted ways with the club, such as Tam McManus, who later joined Falkirk, Craig Samson, who joined St Mirren in the SPL, and Stephen Grindlay re-joined one of his former clubs Dumbarton.

Chris Smith and Bobby Donnelly were signed at the back, but were later joined by Eddie Malone and the well-experienced Jim Lauchlan. Alan Trouten and Scott McLaughlin were signed from Airdrie United as did Ryan McCann later in the campaign, Stephen McKeown was also signed but only played 6 games before his contract was terminated after a bust up with the management. Andy Rodgers was signed from East Stirlingshire and Michael Moffat joined in January from Junior side Girvan.
