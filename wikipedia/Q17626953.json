He was born at Bondleigh, Devon and died at St Pancras, London.\nLuxton was educated at Devon County School, West Buckland and at Peterhouse, Cambridge. In his two first-class cricket games, he was a tail-end batsman and a bowler, and neither his batting nor his bowling style are known; he made little impression in either game. In minor cricket, he played for Devon and other amateur sides through to the mid 1880s.\nLuxton graduated from Cambridge University in 1883 and was ordained as a priest in the Church of England. He was curate at Lifton, Devon and Milverton in Somerset before becoming the vicar of Langford Budville, Somerset in 1894, where he remained until his death.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Luxton", "response": ["* Charles Luxton (1861\u20131918), English clergyman and cricketer"]}, {"page": "Luxton, Charles", "response": ["#redirectCharles Luxton"]}]}}
