As far as is known, none of Lechmere's paintings have survived. She served as a nurse in England during the First World War and had a three-year relationship with the poet and critic T.E. Hulme before he was killed. After the war she became a successful milliner.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Vorticism", "response": ["A quarrel with Roger Fry provided Lewis with a pretext to leave the Omega Workshops and set up a rival organisation.Karin Orchard, '\"A Laugh Like a Bomb\": The History and Ideas of the Vorticists', in Paul Edwards (ed.), Blast: Vorticism 1914\u20131918  (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2000), p. 15.

It was to be a platform for the art and ideas of Lewis's circle, and a lecture series included talks by Lewis's friend the poet Ezra Pound, the novelist Ford Madox Hueffer (later Ford Madox Ford) and the Italian 'Futurist', Filippo Tommaso Marinetti. Marinetti had been a familiar \u2013 and provocative \u2013 presence in London since 1910, and Lewis had seen him create an art movement on the basis of his 'Futurist' manifesto.

Hulme had written, in the years immediately preceding his death in World War I in 1917, a series of essays in which he attacked the subjectivism and vagueness of romantic literature and advocated \"dry and hard\" images in poetry as well as objectivity and discipline in art in general. Hulme believed that \"man is by nature bad or limited, and can consequently only accomplish anything of value by disciplines, ethical, heroic or political\", and he saw one consequence of this belief as an abandonment of romantic optimism about the nature and potentialities of man. Hulme's views influenced T. S. Eliot and are reflected in Eliot's influential essay, Tradition and the Individual Talent, which first appeared in 1917.\" \u2014 Daiches, David (1962). \"The New Criticism.\" In: Time of Harvest, American Literature, 1910\u20131960.

William Roberts's painting The Vorticists at the Restaurant de la Tour Eiffel, Spring 1915, from 1961\u201362, shows the seven males dominating the foreground and the two women behind with Dismorr in the doorway being the furthest away. According to Kate Lechmere, the financial backer of Blast and the Rebel Art Centre, Dismorr had a difficult relationship with Wyndham Lewis, and was, along with fellow artist Helen Saunders, one of the \"little lapdogs who wanted to be Lewis\u2019s slaves and do everything for him\". Lechmere claimed that on one occasion Dismorr stripped naked in Oxford Street to demonstrate she would do anything Lewis asked of her. Dismorr and Wyndham Lewis fell out in 1925 when she refused to purchase some drawings from him when he was short of money but they appeared to have resumed a cordial friendship in 1928 when she did lend him some funds. Robin Ody, a close friend and the executor of Dismorr's will (in which all the beneficiaries were women), summed her up as \"the Edwardian phenomenon of the new woman\". Ody considered that she did not have a physical relationship with Lewis. Lechmere's relationship with Lewis ended bitterly, and she carried out a legal struggle to recover money owed her by him. Lechmere had provided all the funds to pay for the Rebel Art Centre, where the Vorticists first met in 1914\u2014a fact which Lewis had to admit to Christopher Nevinson who had not wanted \"any of these damned women\" in the group."]}, {"page": "Helen Saunders", "response": ["*Kate Lechmere"]}, {"page": "1976 in art", "response": ["* February \u2013 Kate Lechmere, English painter associated with the Vorticists and milliner (b. 1887)"]}, {"page": "1887 in art", "response": ["* October 13 \u2013 Kate Lechmere, English painter associated with the Vorticists and milliner (died 1976)."]}, {"page": "Lechmere (surname)", "response": ["* Kate Lechmere (1887\u20131976), British cubist painter"]}, {"page": "Ethel Kibblewhite", "response": ["From 1911, T.E.

From 1914, Hulme was in a relationship with the painter Kate Lechmere and latterly they regarded themselves as engaged as Hulme could not countenance marrying a divorcee (Kibblewhite was separated but not yet divorced) but Hulme was killed in action in 1917 before he could marry Lechmere.
