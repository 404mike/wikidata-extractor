The first production (The Merchant of Venice, Shakespeare) was in 1927 staged in the Hucklow Holiday Homes. The first set of plays in the New Play House was in 1938, with four one act plays written by Peach. The New Play House was in a converted lead mining building (known locally as cupolas from the lead smelting furnace). The first 200-second hand seats cost 1 shilling and 9 pence each. The stage was  wide by  deep.  For many years the theatre brought many visitors to Great Hucklow from all parts of the north of England. The theatre building is still used as an activity centre."]}, {"page": "The Tunnel (1935 film)", "response": ["The Tunnel, also known as Transatlantic Tunnel in the United States, is a 1935 British science fiction film directed by Maurice Elvey and stars Richard Dix, Leslie Banks, Madge Evans, Helen Vinson, C.

The first proper audio play was a translation of the classic play Light and Shade by L. du Garde Peach, which was sent in March 1926. The first Norwegian proper audio play was Per Jespersen's sketch Hvem har telefonert? from March 1927, while the second was Luftreisen by Peter Lykke-Seest. In addition to specially written audio plays, also ordinary plays were adapted for radio. In 1927 reciter Gunnar Neels-Hansson was appointed as leader of the drama production, the first theatre director. Among the productions from 1927 were Ervingen by Ivar Aasen, Jeppe by Ludvig Holberg and Strindberg's D\u00f8dsdansen. The first productions were sent live. One of the challenges was the logistics when many actors had to share the same microphone. Another challenge was the sound effects, which were often improvised by the technicians. From 1934 special instruments were made for sound effects. The number of productions were about 20 per year in the late 1920s."]}, {"page": "Get Cracking", "response": ["The film was released on 17 May 1943 and runs for 96 minutes in black and white.
