Sheila Stewart corrects the frequently cited birthdate of 17 July 1906 to the 18th. As a result of their life-style, the family received much insult and abuse. Belle's father died when she was only 9 months old. Afraid that social workers might take her children from her, her mother stopped travelling and settled in Perthshire. The McGregor family tried to teach Belle how to read palms (fortune telling), but she didn't take to this. The family frequently went to Northern Ireland to do pearl-fishing. In the evenings they gathered at ceilidhs to exchange folk songs. Stewart learnt songs from her brothers, who had themselves learnt them from her father.", "When the Stewarts of Blairgowrie went to the Sidmouth Festival in Devon they encountered New Age travellers for the first time. Belle Stewart noticed how dirty the New Agers were. They said they were travellers but Stewart replied \"No, you're not. We are.\" The New Age Travellers said \"But you're dressed too fine to be travellers.\" The photographs in Sheila Stewart's book show how much care the Stewarts took with personal appearance. At festivals the whole family wore tartan kilts and the pipers among them wore full regalia."]}, {"page": "Scottish Gypsy and Traveller groups", "response": ["* Sheila Stewart, daughter of Belle Stewart, who was awarded the British Empire Medal for services to her country's cultural oral tradition in Scots and Gaelic."]}, {"page": "Traditional singer", "response": ["* Sheila Stewart (1937-2014)"]}, {"page": "1937 in Scotland", "response": ["* 7 July \u2013 Sheila Stewart, folk singer (died 2014)"]}, {"page": "2014 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Sheila Stewart, 77, singer, storyteller, and author."]}, {"page": "Sheena Wellington", "response": ["In November 2009, she was installed in the Scottish Traditional Music Hall of Fame whose inductees include Jimmy Shand, Aly Bain, The Corries and Sheila Stewart."]}, {"page": "Deaths in December 2014", "response": ["*Sheila Stewart, 77, Scottish singer, storyteller, and author.Sheila Stewart "]}, {"page": "Sheila Stewart (author)", "response": ["Sheila Stewart (6 Jan 1928 - 3 Sep 2014) was a British writer who chronicled the lives of rural working people using their own words.
