The construction of the cathedral is an important plot point in Edward Rutherfurd's historical novel Sarum, which explores the historical settlement of the Salisbury area. The cathedral has been mentioned by the author Ken Follett as one of two models for the fictional Kingsbridge Cathedral in his historical novel The Pillars of the Earth. It was also used for some external shots in the 2010 miniseries based on Follett's book and was shown as it is today in the final scene.  Another mention of this cathedral was made by Jonathan Swift in The Travels of Gulliver, part II, chapter IV, making a comparison between its spire and the tower of the main temple of Lorbrulgrud, Brobdingnag's capital. In 1990, Channel 4 marked the official launch of its NICAM stereo service with a live broadcast of Mahler's 9th Symphony from the cathedral. The cathedral was the setting for the 2005 BBC television drama Mr. Harvey Lights a Candle, written by Rhidian Brook and directed by Susanna White. Kevin McCloud climbed the cathedral in his programme called Don't Look Down! in which he climbed high structures to conquer his fear of heights. The cathedral was the subject of a Channel 4 Time Team programme which was first broadcast on 8 February 2009."]}, {"page": "Keira Knightley", "response": ["The same year, she played the Sugar Plum Fairy in Disney's adaptation of The Nutcracker, titled The Nutcracker and the Four Realms, which was critically panned.- -  In 2019, Knightley co-starred in The Aftermath, a film adaption of the novel by Rhidian Brook, alongside Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd. Knightley plays Rachel, a \"cold and complex\" British army wife traumatised by her son's death by a German bomb. The film sees her and her husband move to Germany while dealing with grief. The film received mixed reviews. The Boston Globes Ty Burr praised Knightley for adding \"conviction, grace, heart, and nerve\" to the film, while Katie Walsh of the Los Angeles Times felt Knightley and Skarsg\u00e5rd were too reserved. Knightley portrayed whistleblower Katharine Gun in Official Secrets (2019), which was premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on 28 January 2019 to positive reviews. Knightley believed the film's depiction of Iraq War and government accountability connected with modern politics. Writing for The Guardian, Peter Bradshaw praised Knightley's \"focused, plausible and sympathetic performance\". Gun also expressed her contentment with the film."]}, {"page": "Aftermath", "response": ["* The Aftermath, a 2013 novel by Rhidian Brook"]}, {"page": "Tenby", "response": ["*Rhidian Brook, writer, born in Tenby"]}, {"page": "Churcher's College", "response": ["* Rhidian Brook, writer and broadcaster"]}, {"page": "Somerset Maugham Award", "response": ["* Rhidian Brook for The Testimony of Taliesin Jones"]}, {"page": "Thought for the Day", "response": ["Other contributors include Anne Atkins, John L.
