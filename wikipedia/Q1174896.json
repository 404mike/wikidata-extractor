He won three consecutive AAA titles at 220 yards (1959\u20131961). He was educated at Felsted School.\nHe competed for Great Britain in the 1960 Summer Olympics held in Rome in the 4 x 100 metre relay where he won the bronze medal with his team mates Peter Radford, David Segal and Nick Whitehead. He reached the 100 metres semi final where he was denied a place in the final in a photo finish with Ray Norton of the USA although there are photos that seem to suggest he finished ahead of Norton. David Jones subsequently won a gold medal in the 4 x 110 yards relay in the England team with Peter Radford, Alf Meakin, Len Carter, as well as winning a silver medal in the 220 yards event in the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Perth.\nHe was part of the 4 x 110 yards relay team (Peter Radford, Ron Jones & Berwyn Jones were his team mates) who defeated the USA team (which included Bob Hayes) at the White City Stadium in 1963 during the GB v USA match. He was holder of World Best performance over 150 yards in time of 13.9 secs in May 1961 at Southend-on-Sea, England.
