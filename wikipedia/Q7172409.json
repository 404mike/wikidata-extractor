This band played covers of tracks by Elmore James, Ray Charles, Rufus Thomas, Bobby Troup, and John Lee Hooker. After that, Cowling played in British groups including Gnidrolog and the Flying Hat Band, before joining forces with Pat Travers in 1975.\nCowling recorded eight albums for Travers from 1976 to 1982. He left Travers that year and later in the 1980s joined sisters Pam and Paula Mattioli in US AOR band Gypsy Queen (later to become Cell Mates in the early 1990s after Cowling's time in the band), appearing at the 1987 Reading Rock Festival and on Gypsy Queen's debut album before leaving the band later the same year. He rejoined Travers in 1989, and remained until 1993. He performed on Travers' singles \"Boom Boom (Out Go The Lights)\" and \"Snortin' Whiskey\". Cowling was also featured on two video releases. The first was Hooked On Music, a live performance originally shot for the German television programme, Rockpalast in 1976, which showcased an early line-up that also included Nicko McBrain. Cowling's other video appearance was Boom Boom-Live At The Diamond Club, a 1991 concert filmed in Toronto, that also featured Jerry Riggs.\nCowling died on March 20, 2018 after having been diagnosed in February with an aggressive form of Leukemia.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Grimsby", "response": ["*Peter \"Mars\" Cowling, longstanding bass player in the Pat Travers Band"]}, {"page": "Pat Travers", "response": ["While performing with Merge, he was noticed by rock artist Ronnie Hawkins, who invited Travers to perform with him. In his early twenties, Travers moved to London and signed a recording contract with the Polydor label. His self-titled debut album was released in 1976 and featured bassist Peter \"Mars\" Cowling, who would become a mainstay in Travers' band for several years. An appearance on the German TV show Rockpalast in November 1976 was later released on DVD under the title Hooked on Music.

Travers' first recording for the label was Blues Tracks, released in 1992. Several more releases on the BBI label followed during the 1990s. In 1993, Travers parted company with both Jerry Riggs and Peter \"Mars\" Cowling, and Riggs was briefly replaced by former Foghat guitarist Erik Cartwright. The relationship was brief, and Travers has worked with a variety of musicians since that time. Travers sang on Boston metal band Extreme's song \"Get the Funk Out\" from their 1990 album Pornograffitti.", "Pat Thrall, Nicko McBrain, Clive Edwards, Mick Dyche, Tommy Aldridge, Peter \"Mars\" Cowling, Barry Dunaway, Jerry Riggs, Gunter Nezhoda, Carmine Appice, Michael Shrieve, Aynsley Dunbar, Kirk McKim, Sandy Gennaro, Rodney O'Quinn, Sean Shannon and Frank McDaniel are some of the noted musicians who have been members of the Pat Travers Band through the years."]}, {"page": "Gnidrolog", "response": ["The band was founded in 1969 by twin brothers Colin and Stewart Goldring, who were joined by drummer Nigel Pegrum from Spice and Peter \"Mars\" Cowling on bass.

In May 1972, the British music magazine NME reported that Gnidrolog was to appear at the Great Western Express Lincoln Festival on 26 May that year, along with Budgie, Skin Alley, Tea & Symphony, John Martyn, and Warhorse.  In 1972, Gnidrolog released both their first and second albums, In Spite of Harry's Toe-Nail and Lady Lake, before disbanding due to a lack of commercial success.
