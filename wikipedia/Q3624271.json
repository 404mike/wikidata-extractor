Wharton keenly observed the social changes happening around her which appeared later in her writing. Wharton officially came out as a debutante to society in 1879. Wharton was allowed to bare her shoulders and wear her hair up for the first time at a December dance given by a Society matron, Anna Morton. Wharton began a courtship with Henry Leyden Stevens, the son of a wealthy businessman. Henry's father was Paran Stevens, a hotelier and real estate investor from rural New Hampshire.

The matchmaker was a minor American heiress turned major English hostess, Lady Paget, the wife of Sir Arthur Paget. Born as Mary \"Minnie\" Stevens, Lady Paget was the daughter of Paran Stevens, the socially ambitious widow of an American hotel entrepreneur who had successfully obtained admittance to the exclusive New York society of the fabled \"Four Hundred\". Lady Paget, always short of money, soon became a sort of international marital agent, introducing eligible American heiresses to British noblemen.Stuart, pp. 102\u2013103, 116\u2013117"]}, {"page": "Hubert Gough", "response": ["On the morning of Friday 20 March, Arthur Paget (Commander-in-Chief, Ireland) addressed senior officers at his headquarters in Dublin. By Gough's account (in his memoirs Soldiering On), he said that \"active operations were to commence against Ulster,\" that officers who lived in Ulster would be permitted to \"disappear\" for the duration, but that other officers who refused to serve against Ulster would be dismissed rather than being permitted to resign, and that Gough \u2013 who had a family connection with Ulster but did not live there \u2013 could expect no mercy from his \"old friend at the War Office\" (French). French, Paget and Ewart had in fact (on 19 March) agreed to exclude officers with \"direct family connections\" to Ulster. In offering his officers an ultimatum, Paget was acting foolishly, as the majority might have obeyed if simply ordered north. Paget ended the meeting by ordering his officers to speak to their subordinates and then report back. Maj-Gen Sir Charles Fergusson, GOC 5th Infantry Division, warned Gough and one of the infantry brigadiers that the Army must hold together at all costs, and that he himself would obey orders. Gough said that he would not, and went off to speak to the officers of the 5th Lancers (one of the regiments under his command) and also sent a telegram to his brother \"Johnnie\", Haig's Chief of Staff at Aldershot. Gough did not attend the second meeting in the afternoon, at which Paget confirmed that the purpose of the move was to overawe Ulster rather than fight.Holmes 2004, pp. 178\u2013179"]}, {"page": "Sir arthur henry paget", "response": ["#REDIRECT Arthur Paget (British Army officer)"]}, {"page": "Aide-de-camp general", "response": ["| Lieutenant-General Sir Arthur Paget || 1 July 1910 || 1 July 1914 ||"]}, {"page": "Lords Justices of Ireland", "response": ["| Arthur Paget"]}, {"page": "Arthur Paget", "response": ["Arthur Paget may refer to:", "*Sir Arthur Paget (diplomat) (1771\u20131840), British diplomat and politician", "*Sir Arthur Paget (British Army officer) (1851\u20131928), soldier and diplomat, who served in Belgrade and Ireland"]}, {"page": "Arthur Henry Paget", "response": ["#REDIRECT Arthur Paget (British Army officer)"]}, {"page": "King of Arms of the Order of the British Empire", "response": ["|General the Rt.
