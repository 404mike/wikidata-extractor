Despite the loss, Martin was back for the next match, and this time finished on the winning side. Martin did not play for Wales the next season, but was back after the First World War, in a game against the New Zealand Army, which is now recognised as an international game. Martin was not the first choice in the New Zealand game, as the selectors had chosen Cardiff's Clem Lewis, but Lewis had picked up an injury playing for the British Army team. Martin was drafted in as a late replacement but during the game injured his head saving a try. Martin was removed from play, but later recovered and resumed the game, although his play was not as strong after the event.Billot (1972), pg 51.
