They released three albums and a run of singles. During these years Sager also played saxophone on \"A-Train\", a track featured on The Flying Lizards' Fourth Wall. In 1985 Rip Rig + Panic (with Neneh Cherry) changed their name to Float Up CP releasing one final album and single before amicably disbanding. \nSoon after, Sager helped initiate Head, transforming his work once again and pursuing a soused, anthemic pop under the influence of The Pogues, Captain Beefheart and the traditional sea shanties and folk tunes of Sager's base for many years, Bristol. \nIn a solo capacity, as CC Sager, Pregnant and as Gareth Sager respectively, Sager's work has been championed and comprehensively collated by Glasgow institution and John Peel favourite Creeping Bent. He was also engaged in manifold collaborations with the late Scottish punk poet and 'tragedian' Jock Scot, including regular live performances at Edinburgh Festival Fringe, as well as a record, Caledonian Blues, released by Geoff Barrow's Invada Records.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Pop Group", "response": ["The Pop Group are an English band formed in Bristol in 1977 by vocalist Mark Stewart, guitarist John Waddington, bassist Simon Underwood, guitarist/saxophonist Gareth Sager, and drummer Bruce Smith.

Inspired by the energy of punk rock but feeling the style to be too conservative, the group drew influence from the avant-garde, black music styles such as free jazz and dub, and radical political traditions. Guitarist Gareth Sager and drummer Bruce Smith were eventually added to the group. Soon after forming, they began to gain notoriety for their live performances and were signed to Radar Records. They appeared on the cover of the NME. The band donated the proceeds from their first high-profile tour to Amnesty International. They issued their debut single \"She Is Beyond Good and Evil\" in March 1979 and their debut album Y  in April of that year, both to acclaim but relatively low sales figures. Regardless, their moderate success was sufficient to convince Rough Trade to sign the band. During this period, Dan Catsis replaced Underwood on bass.", "In 2010, the Pop Group reunited with three of the original five members: Mark Stewart, Gareth Sager, and Bruce Smith. The 1980 LP We Are Time was reissued worldwide on 20 October 2014, and the band released a compilation of rarities titled Cabinet of Curiosities. In support of the reissues, the band undertook a seven-day tour of the UK, and in February 2015, released Citizen Zombie, their first studio album in 35 years. They went a worldwide tour with dates in the U.S., Japan, and Australia, followed by an extensive European tour culminating in festival appearances including two live sets at Glastonbury."]}, {"page": "Creeping Bent (record label)", "response": ["Recent years have seen further releases by Port Sulphur, Jazzateers, Transelement, Gareth Sager.", "* Gareth Sager, formerly of The Pop Group "]}, {"page": "Y (album)", "response": ["* Gareth Sager\u00a0\u2013 guitar, saxophone, piano"]}, {"page": "Rip Rig + Panic", "response": ["Rip Rig + Panic was an English post-punk band founded in 1980  and disbanded in 1983.
