The story presents real historical characters in a fictitious manner. The serial was produced in a six-episode block with the preceding story, The Rescue, to introduce new companion Vicki. It features the design work of Raymond Cusick, and the incidental music was composed by Raymond Jones in his first work for the series. The Romans premiered with 13 million viewers, continuing the high viewership of the previous serial, which it maintained across the four weeks. Reviews were generally positive, with praise for the performances and characterisation, though its comedic tone received mixed responses. The serial was later novelised and released on VHS and DVD.", "Raymond Cusick worked as the serial's designer; it was his only historical serial, and became his least favourite work.

The serial's incidental music was composed by Raymond Jones, who was new to the series but had worked with Barry on Ann Veronica (1964).
