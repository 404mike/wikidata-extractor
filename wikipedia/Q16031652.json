He played in three trial matches for Kent Colts in May 1882 but did not progress to the county side until he joined St Lawrence Cricket Club at Canterbury in 1884. The pace of Martin's bowling varied in his early years, from fast to slow before he settled on a medium pace delivery by the time he joined Kent."]}]}}
