The farm-obsessed Reuben's original is in Kaye-Smith's Sussex Gorse, and the Quivering Brethren on the Colgate Brethren in Kaye-Smith's Susan Spray.

Gibbons had first become familiar with the genre when she provided summaries of Webb's The Golden Arrow for the Evening Standard's 1928 serialisation. She found the writing overblown and the plotting ridiculous,Oliver, p. 65 and decided that her own first novel would be a comic parody of the  genre. By February 1932 she had completed the manuscript and delivered it to her publishers, Longmans.Oliver, pp. 88 and 111", "Gibbons's chosen title for her novel had been \"Curse God Farm\", before her friend Elizabeth Coxhead, who had connections in the Hinckley district of Leicestershire, suggested \"Cold Comfort\" as an alternative, using the name of a farm in the Hinckley area. Gibbons was delighted with the suggestion, and the work was published as Cold Comfort Farm in September 1932. The plot concerns the efforts of \"a rational, bossy London heroine\" to bring order and serenity to her rustic relations, the Starkadders, on their run-down Sussex farm. According to the Feminist Companion to Literature in English, Gibbons's parody \"[demolishes]\u00a0... the stock-in-trade of earthy regionalists such as Thomas Hardy, Mary Webb, Sheila Kaye-Smith and D. H. Lawrence\". The literary scholar Faye Hammill describes the work as \"an extremely sophisticated and intricate parody whose meaning is produced through its relationship with the literary culture of its day and with the work of such canonical authors as D. H. Lawrence, Thomas Hardy, and Emily Bront\u00eb\".  In her history of the 1930s, Juliet Gardiner ascribes a socio-economic dimension to the book: \"a picture of rural gloom caused by government lassitude and urban indifference\".Gardiner, p. 240", "The immediate and enduring success of Cold Comfort Farm dominated the rest of Gibbons's career. Neville thought that after so singular a success at the start of her career, the rest was  something of an anticlimax, despite her considerable  industry and undoubted skills.

A more negative view of the book has been expressed by the literary critic Mary Beard, who considers it \"a rather controlling victory of modern order, cleanliness, contraception and medicine  over these messy, different, rural types\u00a0...

Beauvoir writes that these women may develop a relation \"with an unreal\"\u2014 with their double or a god, or they create an \"unreal relation with a real being\". She also mentions women with careers who are able to escape sadism and masochism. A few women have successfully reached a state of equality, and Beauvoir, in a footnote, singles out the example of Clara and Robert Schumann. Beauvoir says that the goals of wives can be overwhelming: as a wife tries to be elegant, a good housekeeper and a good mother. Singled out are \"actresses, dancers and singers\" who may achieve independence. Among writers, Beauvoir chooses only Emily Bront\u00eb, Woolf and (\"sometimes\") Mary Webb (and she mentions Colette and Mansfield) as among those who have tried to approach nature \"in its inhuman freedom\".
