He came from a family with many artistic talents: his mother was a dancer, his father a pianist and photographer, and his brother an artist. As a child, McMillan demonstrated a love for music and athletics, so his mother enrolled him in ballet at the age of eight.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Black Sabbath (album)", "response": ["The cover photograph was shot at Mapledurham Watermill, situated on the River Thames in Oxfordshire, England, by photographer Keith McMillan (credited as Keef), who was in charge of the overall design. Standing in front of the watermill is a figure dressed in a black cloak, portrayed by model Louisa Livingstone, whose identity was not widely known until 2020. \"I'm sure (McMillan) said it was for Black Sabbath, but I don't know if that meant anything much to me at the time,\" Livingstone recalled, adding that it had been \"freezing cold\" during the shoot. \"I had to get up at about 4 o'clock in the morning. Keith was rushing around with dry ice, throwing it into the water. It didn't seem to be working very well, so he ended up using a smoke machine,\" said the model."]}, {"page": "Live at Hammersmith Odeon (Kate Bush album)", "response": ["* Keith McMillan - director"]}, {"page": "Coming Up (song)", "response": ["The music video for \"Coming Up\", directed by Keith McMillan, features Paul McCartney playing ten roles (himself, two guitarists, a bassist, a drummer, a keyboard player, and four saxophone players) and Linda McCartney playing two (one female backing singer and one male backing singer).

EMI Records released the extended play (EP) On Stage on 31 August 1979, featuring live performances of the songs \"Them Heavy People\", \"Don't Push Your Foot on the Heartbrake\", \"James and the Cold Gun\" and \"L'Amour Looks Something Like You\" as recorded at the Hammersmith Odeon on 13 May 1979. The EP peaked at number 10 and spent nine weeks on the UK Singles Chart. An hour length video of aspects of the concert was released as a home video directed by Keith McMillan entitled Live at Hammersmith Odeon in 1981. Also recorded on 13 May 1979, the video featured only twelve performances as others were marred by technical difficulties. In 1994, the video was re-issued as a box set including an audio CD of the broadcast as well as the video. Neither the EP nor the home video make reference to the name \"Tour of Life\", which was not coined until after the tour's completion."]}, {"page": "XTC discography", "response": ["|rowspan=\"4\"|Keith McMillan"]}, {"page": "List of British films of 1981", "response": ["|Concert for Kampuchea||Keith McMillan ||Wings, The Clash ||Musical documentary ||"]}]}}
