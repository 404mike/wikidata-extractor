After an Oxford education and early teaching career at Marlborough College, he was headmaster of Rossall School from 1875 to 1886. It was said that he raised the school \"to a pitch of all-round excellence which it had not known before\". After suffering from health problems at Rossall, he served as Dean of St Asaph from 1886 to 1889.  He returned to teaching in 1889, becoming headmaster of Cheltenham College and remaining in this post until 1895, despite being offered the position of headmaster of Clifton College.  He then became headmaster of Rugby School and served there to great acclaim.  His Rugby School nickname of \"The Bodger\" is still in use at the school. He left Rugby School in 1909 to become President of St John's College, Oxford, a position he held until his death 22 years later.\nHe was a highly respected teacher and preacher, being described as one of the best preachers of his day.  He was widely praised for his work at Rossall, Cheltenham, Rugby and St John's. He was made a member of the Order of the Companions of Honour by King George V in 1926. At a dinner in his honour held to mark this award, attended by over 200 friends and former students, he was described by Austen Chamberlain (the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs) as \"one of the greatest and most forceful characters who had ever devoted himself to education\". The Lord Chancellor, Viscount Cave, also spoke at the dinner to praise James's directness in his opinions and decisions, his weighty judgment, his high character and his kindly nature.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Rossall School", "response": ["| Herbert Armitage James"]}, {"page": "List of members of the Order of the Companions of Honour", "response": ["|5 June 1926||75px||Herbert Armitage James||1844\u20131931||Cleric and school administrator"]}, {"page": "1844 in Wales", "response": ["*3 August - Herbert Armitage James, clergyman and schoolmaster (died 1931)"]}, {"page": "Panteg", "response": ["*Herbert Armitage James, who was Headmaster of Rugby School and later President of St John's College, Oxford, grew up in Panteg and is commemorated by a memorial in the parish church, where his father was rector from 1856 to 1871."]}, {"page": "Albert David (bishop)", "response": ["In November 1909 David married Eda Mary Miles with whom he had three sons and one daughter. In the same month as his marriage David was selected as headmaster of Rugby in succession to Herbert Armitage James. His return was welcomed by the staff, but his unorthodox views on teaching soon met considerable opposition in some quarters. David maintained that a schoolmaster should study his pupils rather than subjects, and that too much attention was concentrated on the few cleverest pupils. He held that very few boys were stupid, and that there should be \"a larger measure of controlled freedom in work and a wider choice of occupations should be contrived for the majority\".\"Obituary \u2013 Bishop A. A. David\", The Times, 27 December 1950, p. 6 Some of the older members of his staff considered that David's methods would undermine discipline and damage the school's reputation.
