He appeared as a pianist on programmes such as Play Away and also presented some of the musical items.\nIn the latter part of his career, he became heavily involved with programmes for BBC Schools co-presenting Music Time with Helen Speirs. This was a popular, long-running series aimed at primary school children that focused on teaching singing and instrumentation. First broadcast in 1970, it was presented by Cohen from 1983 until the final series in 1991. He also had prominent roles on several other BBC Schools series aimed at older Junior children, notably the award-winning series The Music Arcade (1979-1986), and Into Music.\nIn 2005, he staged a theatre production called Still Playing Away alongside former Play Away presenter Brian Cant, which was a trip down memory lane of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.\nHe leads the annual Christmas Carol Singalong at the Royal Albert Hall, Birmingham Symphony Hall and Bridgewater Hall, Manchester, using his own arrangements of traditional Christmas songs and carols.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Play Away", "response": ["It ran from 1971 until 1984, and was broadcast on Saturday afternoons on BBC 2.Alistair McGown \"Play Away (1971\u201384)\", BFI screenonline While Play School had a more gentle, intimate feel, featuring just two presenters in a studio with the usual collection of toys, Play Away was much more lively, including songs, games and many jokes.  The first eight series were shot in a studio, usually at BBC Television Centre, London, but certain episodes were recorded in Bristol or Manchester. Later episodes were recorded in front of a live studio audience. The format was a little like a music-hall variety show or 'end-of-the-pier' show.  The musical director was Jonathan Cohen on piano, with Spike Heatley on double bass and Alan Rushton on drums, often with accomplished guest musicians such as trombonist George Chisholm. In Australia the series aired on ABC at 4:30 after the Australian version of Play School. In New Zealand the series aired on TV One during the 1970s and 1980s.
