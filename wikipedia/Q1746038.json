Douglas R. Clyne, much was done to expand the youth groups of the church. In his ministry the \"Penny Schoolie\" was renovated in 1976 for better accommodation, a new church centre built in 1990\u201392, and a special \"Youth Dedication Service\" has been held annually for years. Today, the Old Parish Church continues to host many youth groups including: the Badminton Club; Boys' Brigade (with band); Covenanters; Girls' Brigade; Junior Choir; as well as Sunday School groups. There are social groups for adults also. The Rev. Clyne demitted office in 2004, and a three-year vacancy (under Rev. George S. Noble) ensued. The current minister, Rev. Peter B. Park, was inducted in November 2007. Since his arrival he has overseen the development of a hand bell group (The Clangers) which was founded in the last year of the Clyne ministry. Park was also a noted name at the 2009 General Assembly of the Church of Scotland when he openly opposed the appointment of the Rev. Scott Rennie - an openly gay minister and divorced father of one. \u201cThere is a danger that we will make a decision [about homosexuality in the ministry] based on the prevailing culture of our time,\u201d said the Rev Peter B. Park, who moved the procedural amendment. He was defeated. The Rev. Park retired in June 2014 after a ministry of almost 7 years. The Kirk currently has a vacant charge."]}]}}
