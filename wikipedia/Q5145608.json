Colin Talbot, Chair of Public Policy and Management at Manchester Business School and Treasury adviser on public spending, questioned the credibility of the new organisation. He said that the body could not be set up in time to judge the forecasts in the June 2010 United Kingdom Budget. In his opinion, the OBR would not be sufficiently independent of politicians or the Executive to remove the politics from economic decision-making.   The office made adjustments to its forecasts in the week before the June 2010 budget.  These were thought to be politically favourable to the coalition government and so cast doubt on its independence."]}, {"page": "Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011", "response": ["According to one political scientist, Colin Talbot, the FTPA makes minority governments more stable than in the past, since events that previously might have forced a government out of powersuch as defeat of a Queen's Speech or other important legislation, loss of supply, or a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister rather than the government as a wholecannot formally do so."]}, {"page": "LSE\u2013Gaddafi affair", "response": ["Colin Talbot, who holds a PhD degree from the LSE and is currently the Chair of Public Policy and Management at Manchester Business School, told UTv News on 4 March 2011 that Howard Davies should not be blamed for carrying out what amounted to \"British diplomatic strategy\".
