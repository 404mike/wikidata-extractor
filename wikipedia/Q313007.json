The Irish Times bemoaned the lack of conventional song structures and panned the album as \"deliberately abstruse, wilfully esoteric and wantonly unfathomable ... The only thing challenging about Kid A is the very real challenge to your attention span.\" In the New Yorker, novelist Nick Hornby wrote that it was \"morbid proof that this sort of self-indulgence results in a weird kind of anonymity rather than something distinctive and original\". Melody Maker critic Mark Beaumont called it \"tubby, ostentatious, self-congratulatory, look-ma-I-can-suck-my-own-cock whiny old rubbish ...

Almost universally praised, with an Academy Award-nominated screenplay, About a Boy (2002) was determined by the Washington Post to be \"that rare romantic comedy that dares to choose messiness over closure, prickly independence over fetishised coupledom, and honesty over typical Hollywood endings\". Rolling Stone wrote, \"The acid comedy of Grant's performance carries the film [and he] gives this pleasing heartbreaker the touch of gravity it needs\", while Roger Ebert observed that \"the Cary Grant department is understaffed, and Hugh Grant shows here that he is more than a star, he is a resource\". Released a day after the blockbuster Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones, About a Boy was a more modest box office grosser than other successful Grant films, making all of $129\u00a0million globally. The film earned Grant his third Golden-Globe nomination, while the London Film Critics Circle named Grant its Best British Actor and GQ honoured him as one of the magazine's men of the year 2002. \"His performance can only be described as revelatory\", wrote critic Ann Hornaday, adding that \"Grant lends the shoals layer upon layer of desire, terror, ambivalence and self-awareness.\" The New York Observer concluded: \"[The film] gets most of its laughs from the evolved expertise of Hugh Grant in playing characters that audiences enjoy seeing taken down a peg or two as a punishment for philandering and womanising and simply being too handsome for words-and with an English accent besides. In the end, the film comes over as a messy delight, thanks to the skill, generosity and good-sport, punching-bag panache of Mr. Grant's performance.\" About a Boy also marked a notable change in his boyish look. Now 41, he had lost weight and also abandoned his trademark floppy hair. Entertainment Weekly's Owen Gleiberman took note of Grant's maturation in his review, saying he looked noticeably older and that it \"looked good on him\". He added that Grant's \"pillowy cheeks are flatter and a bit drawn, and the eyes that used to peer with 'love me' cuteness now betray a shark's casual cunning. Everything about him is leaner and spikier (including his hair, which has been shorn and moussed into a Eurochic bed-head mess), but it's not just his surface that's more virile; the nervousness is gone, too. Hugh Grant has grown up, holding on to his lightness and witty cynicism but losing the stuttering sherry-club mannerisms that were once his signature.
