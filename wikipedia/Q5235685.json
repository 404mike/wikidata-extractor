As a child, he met John Spencer Curwen, son of the inventor of the tonic sol-fa, and assisted Curwen in several demonstrations.  David attended the University of Wales, Aberystwyth. In 1905, he became the college's first B.Mus. graduate. He obtained a grant to study in Leipzig and obtained a doctorate in music from the University of Dublin.  In 1926, he replaced Sir Walford Davies as Professor of Music at University of Wales, Aberystwyth.  De Lloyd became closely involved with the Eisteddfod movement, and was a collector and arranger of Welsh folk music. His arrangements were published as Forty Welsh Traditional Tunes in 1929. Many of his other works can be found archived at the British Library in Welsh and English here.  Most recently his work 'Er Cof' was performed Sunday, 30 June 2019, Bethel Chapel, Aberystwyth by Meirion Wynn Jones (organ) as part of the Gregynog Festival.\nHe died in 1948. Sidney Northcote wrote, \"The death of Dr. David de Lloyd has robbed Wales of a musical impulse she cannot afford to lose and certainly must not be allowed to forget.\"A collection of his writings both personal and published can be found in the National Library of Wales.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1948 in music", "response": ["*August 20 \u2013 David John de Lloyd, composer, 65"]}, {"page": "Aberystwyth University", "response": ["*David John de Lloyd, Gregynog Professor of Music, composer"]}, {"page": "Skewen", "response": ["*Skewen is also the birthplace of internationally successful singer Bonnie Tyler and Welsh composer David John de Lloyd (1883-1948)."]}, {"page": "Penparcau", "response": ["The famous Welsh composer and musician Prof David John de Lloyd was raised and lived in the village."]}, {"page": "1948 in Wales", "response": ["*20 August \u2013 David John de Lloyd, composer, 65"]}, {"page": "1929 in Wales", "response": ["*David John de Lloyd - Forty Welsh Traditional Tunes (arrangements)"]}, {"page": "1926 in Wales", "response": ["*David John de Lloyd succeeds Walford Davies as Professor of Music at the University of Wales, Aberystwyth."]}, {"page": "1914 in Wales", "response": ["*David John de Lloyd - Gwlad fy Nhadau (cantata)"]}, {"page": "1905 in Wales", "response": ["*David John de Lloyd is the first music graduate of University of Wales, Aberystwyth."]}, {"page": "1880s in Wales", "response": ["**30 April \u2013 David John de Lloyd, composer (died 1948)"]}, {"page": "1883 in Wales", "response": ["*30 April \u2013 David John de Lloyd, composer (died 1948)"]}, {"page": "David john de lloyd", "response": ["#REDIRECT David John de Lloyd "]}, {"page": "1948 in British music", "response": ["*20 August \u2013 David John de Lloyd, composer, 65"]}, {"page": "1929 in British music", "response": ["* David John de Lloyd \u2013 Forty Welsh Traditional Tunes (arrangements)"]}]}}
