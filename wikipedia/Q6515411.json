It was through a mutual friend, singer Lee Vanderbilt, that Charles met record producer Biddu who encouraged her to record  \"I Love to Love (But My Baby Loves to Dance)\", utilizing Manchester musicians Richie Close (keyboard), Clive Allen (guitar), Des Browne (bass) and Tom Daley (percussion) to create a signature hit sound for Charles. Reaching number 1 on the UK Singles Chart in March 1976 and topping the chart for three weeks, \"I Love to Love...\"  was followed by seven more chart records for Charles; only her Top Ten entries \"Dance Little Lady Dance\" and \"Doctor Love\" reached the Top 20."]}, {"page": "Chris Karan", "response": ["* Lee Vanderbilt, Get into What You're in (RCA, 1977)"]}, {"page": "Black Joy (1977 film)", "response": ["* Lee Vanderbilt \u2013 \"Lonely I\""]}, {"page": "Sunny Side of the Street (Bryn Haworth album)", "response": ["*Lee Vanderbilt - chorus (1)"]}]}}
