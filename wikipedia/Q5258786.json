In London, the Tutus felt liberated experiencing a life free from South Africa's apartheid and pass laws; he later noted that \"there is racism in England, but we were not exposed to it\". He was also impressed by the freedom of speech available in the country, especially that at Speakers' Corner. The family moved into the curate's flat behind the Church of St Alban the Martyr in Golders Green, where Tutu assisted Sunday services, the first time that he had ministered to a white congregation. It was in the flat that a daughter, Mpho Andrea Tutu, was born in 1963. Tutu was academically successful and his tutors suggested that he convert to an honours degree, which entailed him also studying Hebrew. He received his degree from Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother in a ceremony held at the Royal Albert Hall."]}, {"page": "List of Honorary Fellows of Keble College, Oxford", "response": ["The first four Honorary Fellows were elected in 1931.  Two of them (Edward Talbot and Walter Lock) were former Wardens of the college; the other two, Sir Wilmot Herringham (a former Vice-Chancellor of the University of London) and Sir Reginald Craddock (a former Lieutenant-Governor of Burma), had studied at Keble College before achieving prominence in public life. Honorary Fellows have included former students (Old Members), Fellows, and Wardens, as well as some with no previous academic connection to the college.  In this latter group there are benefactors (for example Sir Anthony O'Reilly, elected 2002), and individuals of distinction such as former U.S. President Ronald Reagan (elected 1994) and the poet Sir John Betjeman (elected 1972).  Betjeman, who studied at Magdalen College, Oxford, was involved in Keble's centenary appeal in 1970: The Times said in its obituary of him that the Honorary Fellowship was particularly appropriate because of the college's \"architectural and Anglican connotations\", Betjeman having strong interests in both areas. As of July 2011, the longest-serving Honorary Fellows are Raoul Franklin and Dennis Nineham, both of whom were elected in 1980. The three longest-serving Honorary Fellows are Sir John Forsdyke (Principal Librarian of the British Museum; appointed 1937, died 1979), Sir Thomas Armstrong (conductor; appointed 1955, died 1994) and Harry Carpenter (Warden, later Bishop of Oxford; appointed 1960, died 1993)."]}, {"page": "Dennis Eric Nineham", "response": ["#REDIRECT Dennis Nineham"]}, {"page": "The Myth of God Incarnate", "response": ["|10||Dennis Nineham||Warden, Keble College, Oxford||Epilogue"]}, {"page": "Christopher Evans (theologian)", "response": ["In 1948, he was elected as both a fellow and tutor of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, where he would soon become renowned for his tutoring in teachings of the New Testament beside the likes of J.\u00a0R.
