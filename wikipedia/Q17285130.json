He is the nephew of Sookie's half-human/half-fairy grandfather, Fintan, and cousin to Sookie's father.  His first appearance in a novel is in the fifth novel, Dead as a Doornail, but the character first appears in Harris's short story, Fairy Dust. He makes an impact on all women and is described as being absolutely breathtaking, so lovely that his proximity makes Sookie tense as a \u201chigh wire.\u201d  He started out as a stripper at Hooligans, a club in Monroe, which he later becomes owner of, and has branched out to print and runway modeling.  He is depicted as being six feet tall with rippling black hair, muscles, and a six-pack. He has a pair of brown, velour-soft eyes, a chiseled jaw, and a sensuous mouth with a pouty bottom lip. Women usually say \u201cwow\u201d when they see him, but his interest is men.  His ears have been surgically altered from pointed to rounded to look like human ears. Though his physical appearance is magnificent, he is not polite and has a tiny sense of humor.  He seems to like and treat Sookie better once it is revealed to her that she is related to him. In Dead in the Family, he moves in with Sookie out of loneliness after his sister, Claudine, is killed. In Dead Reckoning (novel), it is suggested by Dermot that Claude has ulterior motives, especially when Sookie finds the cluviel dor that was given to Adele by Fintan, via Mr. Cataliades. He is a Sky fairy. In Deadlocked, it is revealed that Claude has been searching for the Cluviel Dor and he was also the one who put the insanity curse on Dermott.
