He previously had spells with Ipswich Town, Boston United, Lincoln City, Colchester United, Walsall and Mansfield Town.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Keith Alexander (footballer)", "response": ["In the close season Alexander purchased Gareth McAuley and Ciaran Toner. Toner and Marcus Richardson were later involved in a training ground fracas, and were both allowed to leave on loan with a view to a transfer. Regardless, rumours persisted that the morale of the squad was low both because of this incident, and in relation to the payment of bonuses. Lincoln again finished in the play-off places and played Southend United in the final, again at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium. Neither side could manage a goal in normal time, and all three strikers had to be replaced in the second half. Derek Asamoah, who was in poor form, was brought on alongside defenders Matt Bloomer and Lee Beevers. However, Southend scored twice in extra time to win."]}, {"page": "Jabo Ibehre", "response": ["Ibehre began the 2011\u201312 season in fine form. He scored in the first match of the season, brought on as a second-half substitute and scoring a 90th-minute equaliser in a 2\u20132 home draw with Hartlepool United on 6 August 2011. He then netted in the Dons 4\u20131 League Cup triumph over Cheltenham on 9 August with a shot from 12 yards, before opening the scoring in a 2\u20130 away win over Exeter on 13 August. He was sent off for a second booking late on in a 3\u20131 defeat to Sheffield Wednesday at Hillsborough on 10 September. He nabbed his fourth goal of the term on 29 October after Walsall goalkeeper Jimmy Walker was sent off in a 2\u20130 away victory for MK Dons. He scored the second goal of the match past stand-in goalkeeper Lee Beevers, whose usual positions are in defence and midfield. Ibehre scored the fifth and final goal for the Dons in a 5\u20131 rout against Colchester at the Colchester Community Stadium on 19 November, and then scored in the next match on 26 November in another high scoring encounter, a 4\u20133 salvo against Wycombe. He bagged his seventh goal of the season on 10 December, starting the scoring in a 2\u20130 away win at Tranmere, but a barren spell left him without a goal for four months, when he scored the final goal in a 3\u20130 home win on 10 March 2012 against Exeter from the substitutes bench. Ibehre concluded his goalscoring with his ninth of the season ten days later with another goal from the bench as the Dons cruised to a 4\u20131 victory against his former club Leyton Orient. His nine goals were gained after making 47 appearances across the year."]}, {"page": "Matt Bloomer", "response": ["The following season, Keith Alexander succeeded Alan Buckley as manager, and brought Bloomer in on a permanent deal. After signing permanently for Lincoln he was mainly a bit-part player, but nonetheless made nearly a century of appearances for the club. During the 2004\u20132005 season, he earned himself a starting place at right-back, replacing veteran Dean West. Bloomer was given his chance to start ahead of West for the League Cup first round match against Derby County. Lincoln won 3\u20131, Bloomer's performance was highly praised, and he went on to make a number of solid performances. He lost his starting place following an ill-fated first half against Wycombe Wanderers in early 2005. Bloomer moved from right back to central defensive position held by captain Paul Morgan, who was out with an injury, Wycombe scored three goals in the first 45 minutes, all from Nathan Tyson. He did not start again all season, with both Lee Beevers and Gareth McAuley playing in his position for the rest of the year, however, he did play as a striker in the play-off final in Cardiff, where Lincoln lost 2\u20130 after extra-time to Southend United. During the 2005\u201306 season, Bloomer found himself on the fringes of the Lincoln squad, and had spells on loan at former club Grimsby Town and Conference side Cambridge United."]}, {"page": "Dean Smith (footballer, born 1971)", "response": ["He let fourteen players go in summer 2011, including: Darren Byfield, Jonny Brain, Clayton McDonald, Paul Marshall, Matt Richards, Steve Jones, Aaron Lescott, David Bevan, Julian Gray, and Tom Williams. He then signed goalkeeper D\u00e1vid Gr\u00f3f; defenders Mat Sadler and Lee Beevers; midfielders Kevan Hurst, Claude Gnakpa, Adam Chambers, and Anton Peterlin; and striker Ryan Jarvis. Also during the campaign he boosted his squad with loan signings Dave Martin, Mark Wilson, Andy Halliday, and Florent Cuvelier. His side lost just one of their first five league games, but then picked up just three points from their next seven games. They beat Preston North End on 15 October, but then picked up just four points from their next eight games. From 26 November, they were beaten just once in nine matches, but became the division's draw specialists as seven of these nine games finished level. They finished the campaign in 19th place, seven points clear of the relegation zone."]}, {"page": "2007\u201308 Lincoln City F.C. season", "response": ["|05 ||  Lee Beevers || Doncaster || 24 || Boston United || February 2005", "| DF || Lee Beevers || 1 || 0 || 1", "| DF || Lee Beevers || 2 || 0 || 6"]}, {"page": "Danny Hone", "response": ["Hone is a product of the Lincoln City centre of excellence and made his debut in the FA Cup first round match against Nottingham Forest which ended as a 1\u20131 draw filling in for the injured Lee Beevers and the ineligible Hamza Bencherif.
