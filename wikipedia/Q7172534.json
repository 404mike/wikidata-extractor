After moving to England, where he studied with William Lloyd Webber and Sir Adrian Boult, he played the flute in the orchestra of a ballet company, with occasional chances to conduct. In 1953 he switched career, joining the Decca Record Company as a producer. Less than three years later he moved to Decca's rival, HMV Records, part of the EMI group, where he rose to become head of the group's classical operations.\nAfter retiring from EMI in 1988, Andry headed a new classical label Warner Classics, before retiring finally from the recording industry in 1996.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Maurizio Pollini", "response": ["Pollini was born in Milan to the Italian rationalist architect Gino Pollini, who has been said to be the first to bring Modernist architecture to Italy in the 1930s, and his wife Renata Melotti (sister of the Italian sculptor Fausto Melotti). Pollini studied piano first with Carlo Lonati, until the age of 13, then with Carlo Vidusso, until he was 18. He received a diploma from the Milan Conservatory and won both the International Ettore Pozzoli Piano Competition in Seregno (Italy) in 1959 and the VI International Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw in 1960. Arthur Rubinstein, who led the jury, declared Pollini the winner of the competition, allegedly saying: \"that boy can play the piano better than any of us\". Following his success at the competition, Pollini didn't perform for a year in order to expand his musical experience, leading to erroneous rumors that he had become a recluse.  Soon afterwards, he recorded Chopin's Concerto No. 1 in E minor with the Philharmonia Orchestra under the Polish conductor Paul Kletzki for EMI, and taped performances of Chopin's etudes. When the Philharmonia offered Pollini a series of concerts, he experienced what EMI producer Peter Andry has called \"an apparent crisis of confidence\". After this, he studied with Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli, from whom he is said to have acquired \"a precise technique and emotional restraint\", although some have expressed a concern that Michelangeli's influence resulted in Pollini's playing becoming \"mannered and cold\". During the early 1960s, Pollini limited his concertizing, preferring to spend these years studying by himself and expanding his repertoire."]}, {"page": "Felix Aprahamian", "response": ["On 20 February 2006, Putney Music (London) held an evening in celebration of its long-time President: \"Remembering Felix Aprahamian \u2013 our late President Emeritus\" was chaired by John Amis.
