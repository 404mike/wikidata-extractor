The group was formed in 1998 and quickly rose to fame by starring in their own BBC television series, Miami 7. In their five years together, S Club 7 had four UK number-one singles, one UK number-one album, and a string of hits throughout Europe as well as a Top 10 hit on the US Hot 100, with their 2000 single \"Never Had a Dream Come True\". They recorded four studio albums, released 11 singles and went on to sell over 10 million albums worldwide.", "Simon Fuller has commented that he came upon the concept of S Club 7 the day after he was fired by the Spice Girls in November 1997, with the new group meant as a \"continuation\" of the latter. He selected the members for the group after auditioning from over 10,000\u00a0hopefuls; Rachel Stevens was the only member of the group who did not audition to gain admittance into the group. Instead, two producers from 19 Management approached her and asked her to go into the studio to record a demo tape for Fuller. Both Jo O'Meara and Paul Cattermole were spotted by producers from 19 and asked to audition. After the auditions had been advertised in The Stage, Jon Lee, Hannah Spearritt, Tina Barrett and Bradley McIntosh auditioned.

Paul Cattermole once commented that the speed of the schedule sometimes caused a \"kind of dreamscape in your head\", as the group often felt \"jetlagged and tired\".
