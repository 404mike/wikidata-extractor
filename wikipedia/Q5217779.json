However, a mooted swap deal for Glentoran defender Calum Birney in the January transfer window came to nothing, as Braniff gradually returned to the starting XI. On 1 April, Braniff scored 4 goals in a stunning 4\u20133 Irish Cup semi-final victory against Crusaders, and again demonstrated his late-season form by scoring the opening goal in an eventual 2\u20130 win over Linfield in the Irish Cup Final. Two days before the final, Braniff had signed a one-year deal at Glenavon, keeping him at the club until 2017."]}, {"page": "David McMillan (footballer)", "response": ["McMillan has represented the Republic of Ireland U23s at international level.

The IFA disputed the players' right to do so under FIFA rules and felt the current rules were a \"clear disadvantage over all other 206 Associations\". The Irish Football Association took a case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport with the hope of getting FIFA to 'uphold' the rules. Although Duffy's name is often linked with this dispute and the IFA appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, his situation differs from that of players such as Darron Gibson because of his close family ties to Donegal. This means he would have been eligible to play for the Republic of Ireland wherever he was born."]}, {"page": "Harry Crawford (footballer)", "response": ["Despite being born in Watford, he qualifies for the Republic of Ireland through his grandmother who hailed from Dublin, and also through his grandfather.

Evidently, the same is not applicable to the footballers of the Republic of Ireland, who do not have such a claim to a UK passport.
