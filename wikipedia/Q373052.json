His last managerial post was at AaB in the Danish Superliga in 2008.\nAs a player, he made more than 550 appearances in the Football League and, by virtue of his parents' birthplaces, represented Scotland in 24 matches; he became the first player born in England to captain Scotland. As a manager, he has taken charge of clubs in England, including Arsenal where he signed the famous Dennis Bergkamp, the United States, and Denmark.

A team including Bruce Rioch, John Moore and Graham French won the Fourth Division championship in 1967\u201368 under the leadership of former player Allan Brown; two years later Malcolm Macdonald's goals helped them to another promotion, while comedian Eric Morecambe became a director of the club. Luton Town won promotion back to the First Division in 1973\u201374, but were relegated the following season by a solitary point. Former Luton player David Pleat was made manager in 1978, and by 1982\u201383 the team was back in the top flight. The team which Pleat assembled at Kenilworth Road was notable at the time for the number of black players it included; during an era when many English squads were almost entirely white, Luton often fielded a mostly black team. Talented players such as Ricky Hill, Brian Stein and Emeka Nwajiobi made key contributions to the club's success during this period, causing it to accrue \"a richer history of black stars than any in the country\", in the words of journalist Gavin Willacy."]}, {"page": "September 6", "response": ["*  1947   \u2013 Bruce Rioch, English footballer and manager"]}, {"page": "1947", "response": ["** Bruce Rioch, Scottish footballer, coach"]}, {"page": "Dennis Bergkamp", "response": ["As Moratti prepared to make wholesale changes at the club, Bergkamp left Inter and signed with Arsenal in June 1995 for a transfer fee estimated at \u00a37.5\u00a0million. He became manager Bruce Rioch's first signing at Arsenal and broke the club's transfer fee record set at \u00a32.5\u00a0million. Bergkamp's arrival at the club was significant not only because he was an established international footballer who looked to have his best years ahead of him, but also because he was a major contributor to Arsenal's return to success after much decline in the mid-1990s. On the opening day of the 1995\u201396 league season, Bergkamp made his full debut against Middlesbrough. He struggled to adapt to the English game and failed to score in the club's next six league matches, prompting ridicule by the national press. On 23 September 1995, Bergkamp scored his first and second goals for Arsenal against Southampton at Highbury. Bergkamp ended his first season with 33 appearances and 11 goals, helping Arsenal finish fifth and earn a place in the UEFA Cup by scoring the winner against Bolton Wanderers on the final day of the season."]}, {"page": "Torquay United F.C.", "response": ["Green then left the club, to be replaced at the helm, for the third time, by Frank O'Farrell.

The peculiarity of Vieira and fellow Frenchman R\u00e9mi Garde arriving at the club, coupled with manager Bruce Rioch's dismissal before the season had begun, suggested that Arsenal was managed by exterior influence.

Being able to speak French to him will make life a lot easier for me.\" Wenger was officially in command of managerial affairs at Arsenal by the start of October, but Vieira had already made his mark, coming on as a substitute against Sheffield Wednesday on 16 September 1996; The Times described him as a \"thinking man's Carlton Palmer \u2026 who, at last, gives the Arsenal midfield some variety.\""]}, {"page": "Ian Wright", "response": ["The arrival of Bruce Rioch heralded a bleaker time; the two did not get on and eventually Wright handed in a transfer request which he later retracted.
