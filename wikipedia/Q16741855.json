From 1810 he was the husband of Anna Susana Taylor, the daughter of Jamaican planter Sir John Taylor, 1st Baronet, and heiress of her brother Sir Simon Richard Brissett Taylor, 2nd baronet. Suffixing his name with that of his wife's family, he would become the richest planter on Jamaica. He used the proceeds to purchase Cavendish Square, Middlesex and Erlestoke Park, near Devizes, Wiltshire, becoming the Liberal MP for Devizes, an ardent campaigner for the retention of slavery, and a renowned fine art collector. Following the abolition of slavery his finances collapsed, and he died on 6 June 1841, in Edinburgh.", "link_mentions": {}}}
