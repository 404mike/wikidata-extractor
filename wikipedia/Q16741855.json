He developed dissipated habits early in life, and became an alcoholic. Perhaps to escape this wandering life, he began to seek a seat in Parliament (which would protect him from duns) in 1824, announcing he would stand for Penryn, where Henry Swann had fallen ill. However, he begun his canvass too late to effectively compete for the vacancy and did not go to the poll. In March 1826, when George Watson-Taylor retired to take another seat, he was put in at East Looe on the interest of James Drummond Buller-Elphinstone. It is not clear that he ever took his seat; in April, his family's Irish agent and solicitor, Edward Tierney, was writing to him to beg him to \"abandon his evil courses and his associates\". He contested Penryn at the 1826 election, but was served with a writ, probably for debt, during the canvass and was defeated, lacking the means to make headway with a venal electorate."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1820 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|rowspan=\"2\"|East Looe(two members)||George Watson-Taylor||Tory", "| 1 March 1826 || Devizes ||Thomas Grimston Estcourt||||George Watson-Taylor|||| Estcourt resigned seat", "| 3 March 1826 || East Looe || George Watson-Taylor || Tory || Henry Perceval || Tory || Watson-Taylor resigned to stand in the Devizes by-election"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1818 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|  George Watson-Taylor"]}, {"page": "Watson-Taylor, George", "response": ["#redirectGeorge Watson-Taylor"]}, {"page": "Vale Royal (Jamaica)", "response": ["Constructed in 1694, as Prospect Pen, by Sir William Taylor, it became the property of Scottish sugar planter, Patrick Tailzour, following his marriage to Martha Taylor, daughter of George Hanbury Taylor and Mary, of Caymanas, Jamaica.
