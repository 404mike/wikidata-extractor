Initial sponsors included British Petroleum, the Nuffield Foundation and Royal Dutch Shell. The Rockefeller Foundation was another early benefactor, and the Wolfson Foundation gave the Unit its current building in 1986. Since the second half of the 1970s the Unit has also received funding through a series of contracts with the United States Department of Energy to support the work of those involved in climate reconstruction and analysis of the effects on climate of greenhouse gas emissions.Hulme & Barrow (1997), p. xxviii The UK Government (Margaret Thatcher) became a strong supporter of climate research in the mid-1980s."]}, {"page": "Natural Environment Research Council", "response": ["* Sir Graham Sutton (1965\u20131970)"]}, {"page": "Royal Meteorological Society", "response": ["* 1953\u20131955: Sir Graham Sutton "]}, {"page": "HMS Amberley Castle (K386)", "response": ["She was in reserve at Penarth from 1953 until 1957 when she was converted to a weather ship at Blyth in Northumberland and renamed to Weather Advisor in a ceremony on 22 September 1960 at the James Watt Dock, Greenock by Lady Sutton, wife of Sir Graham Sutton, the then director-general of the Met Office.
