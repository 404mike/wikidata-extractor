From an early age, he demonstrated a talent for writing, producing a magazine for his grammar school. At 16, he became a reporter for the Wallasey and Wirral Chronicle, where he worked for three years before moving to the Liverpool Evening Express and the Liverpool Daily Courier. He was named the London editor of the Evening Express in 1925, a position he held for a year before moving to the Sunday Express.\nChristiansen made his reputation four years later, when, as assistant editor, he produced a special late-morning edition of the Sunday Express to report the R101 airship disaster.He was the subject of This Is Your Life in 1957, when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the BBC Television Theatre.In 1961, he was cast as the editor of the Daily Express in the Fleet Street-based sci-fi thriller The Day the Earth Caught Fire, directed by Val Guest.

In 1931 it moved its London headquarters to 120 Fleet Street, a specially commissioned art deco building. Under Beaverbrook, the paper set newspaper sales records several times throughout the 1930s. Its success was partly due to aggressive marketing campaign and a circulation war with other populist newspapers. Arthur Christiansen became editor in October 1933. Under his direction sales climbed from two million in 1936 to four million in 1949. He retired in 1957. The paper also featured Alfred Bestall's Rupert Bear cartoon and satirical cartoons by Carl Giles which it began publishing in the 1940s.
