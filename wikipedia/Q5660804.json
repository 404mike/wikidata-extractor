The first four of these were played against an England team led by the Honourable Freddie Calthorpe that toured in 1929\u201330. However, as Harold Gilligan was leading another English team to New Zealand at exactly the same time, this was not a full-strength England side. The series ended one-all, with the West Indies first ever Test victory being recorded on 26 February 1930. West Indian George Headley scored the most runs (703) in the rubber and Learie Constantine took the most wickets (18)."]}, {"page": "List of England cricket captains", "response": ["| 32 || Harold Gilligan  || 1929\u201330 || || New Zealand || New Zealand || 4 || 1 || 0 || 3"]}]}}
