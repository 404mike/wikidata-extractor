In 1915, Babcock & Wilcox joined the professional National Association Football League.  While it regularly went deep in cup competitions, it never finished higher than third in league play.  After finishing at the bottom of the standings in the 1918-1919 season, the team withdrew from the NAFBL.  After a year out of the league, Babcock & Wilcox returned for the 1920-1921 season.  However, the NAFBL folded at the end of the season when several teams joined the newly established American Soccer League.  Babcock & Wilcox continued to play in New Jersey leagues until at least 1932 when it won its fifth New Jersey State Cup.  In its early years, Andrew Brown, future president of the United States Football Association, worked for the Babcock & Wilcox company, helping to manage the team."]}]}}
