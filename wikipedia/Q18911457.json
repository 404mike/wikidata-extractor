He trained at the St John's Wood Art School and the Royal Academy Schools, and went on to exhibit regularly at the Royal Academy. He was married to the poet Helen Parry Eden, and in the interwar years they divided their time between Oxfordshire and Italy. He illustrated a children\u2019s book and provided drawings for his wife\u2019s \u2018medieval\u2019 tales.", "From there he progressed to University College School in Gower Street.Eden was referred to as an Old Gower in 'Old Gowers at the Royal Academy', The Gower, vol. 22, no. 6 (July 1928), pp. 245\u20136. He probably first attended when 11 \u2013 i.e. from 1889. The school was a preparatory school for University College, London, and untypically had no corporal punishment and no religious education, and the curriculum included modern languages as well as Latin.'University College School', Wikipedia. On Wednesday afternoons he attended drawing classes there, run by Frederic George Stephens.A letter written by Helen Parry Eden to the art collector John Bryson in 1942, in the Ashmolean archive, says that her husband 'was taught by F. G. Stephens'. A correspondent writing in The Times about Stephens in 1959 reflected that most of the boys had no idea of the importance of 'the slightly eccentric elderly man' in relation to the art world and 'if we had been told of it we should have been unimpressed. To us he was a rather curious old character who made us copy rather dull casts \u2026 That he was a close friend of Rosetti, Holman Hunt, Millais and the other leading lights of the P.R.B. [Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood] would have meant very little to us.' Anonymous correspondent, 'When F. G. Stephens Taught Drawing at University College School', The Times, 26 February 1959. Eden's father was a successful exhibiting artist,Christopher Wood notes that he was 'a watercolour artist of English landscape' \u2013 Dictionary of Victorian Painters (Woodbridge: Antique Collectors' Club, 1971), p. 42. and would presumably have been fully aware of the PRB, who were important in the development of mid-nineteenth-century British art.", "Eden and Parry shared a passion for art and the medieval, but they also shared a playfulness evident in Eden's paintings and later seen in Parry's critical writings and poems.In an article in The Catholic Bookman, vols. 6\u20137 (1942), p. 139, she is described as the 'playful little sister of [English poet and Catholic mystic] Francis Thompson'. In the year of their marriage, 1907, Eden exhibited Peire of Valeria \u2013 the subject being a twelfth-century troubadour from Gascony. The painting shows Peire studying a mouse resting on his hand,The Academy Notes 1907 (London: Wells Gardner, Darton & Co., 1907), p. 43. and a similar light-hearted meditation on man's relationship to animals would be a major theme of Helen Parry Eden's poems in a both playful but simultaneously religious way.See for example 'The Poet and the Wood-Louse', collected in the anthology Bread and Circuses by Helen Parry Eden (London: John Lane, 1914).", "thumb|left|Griselda at the 'Wheatsheaf'. A portrait of Helen Parry Eden, 1911", "At the time of the 1911 census Denis and Helen Eden were staying as visitors at Michelmersh House, Michelmersh, Romsey, Hampshire \u2013 this may have during been the 'househunting' referred to apropos the Griselda portrait, as their daughter, Hilary Joan Eden, stayed with her grandparents in Ruislip \u2013 west of London.The 1911 census shows William and Ella Eden with children Christopher and Phyllis Eden and a 2-year-old granddaughter Hilary Joan Eden living at Edgemoor, Highfield Rd, Northwood, Ruislip. By 1912 the family had a Michelmersh address when Eden exhibited a watercolourThe only record of an exhibited work in this medium by Denis Eden. \u2013 The Ash Settle \u2013 at the Royal Academy.In 1913 Eden's listed address in Warren's Winchester Directory was Michelmersh, Romsey, Hants. Rural Michelmersh is lovingly captured in Helen Eden's poems of the time;For example 'The Brook along the Romsey Road', in Bread and Circuses, p. 3. however, after she again became pregnant the family briefly moved back to London in the following year \u2013 to an upstairs flat in Battersea.Helen Parry Eden '\"Four Paws\" in London', in Bread and Circuses, p. 81. Helen Eden's parents were living in the neighbouring borough of Lambeth at this time.The Sphere, 14 January 1914. The Eden family's exodus from Hampshire on a large wagon accommodating Denis, Helen, 3-year-old Hilary, the nurse, the cook, their worldly goods and an adopted farm-cat is amusingly captured in Helen's poem '\"Four Paws\" in London'. Their son, Peter Mary Gerard Eden, was born in London in May 1913.The 1939 England and Wales Register shows P. M. G. Eden as born on 4 May 1913 (ancestry.co.uk). The somewhat unusual choice of 'Mary' as one of his names is presumably a demonstration of Helen Eden's continued commitment to the Servite Order.", "With Eden threatened with prison and ordered into non-combative service, it seems likely that there was some family separation at this point. A further collection of Helen Parry Eden's poetry, Coal and Candlelight, was published by John Lane in 1918. There is more devotional verse in this collection, and also reflections on war \u2013 including the tribunal. Some poems reflect a degree of political cynicism.See for example 'A Ballard of Lords and Ladies' , in Coal and Candlelight (London: John Lane, 1918), p. 32. In a prefatory note she gave 'Begbroke' as her address. The family (perhaps without Denis) were at Priory Cottage \u2013 a lodge house attached to the Priory of St Philip, a large Georgian building that had originally been Begbroke Manor House. The priory was a novitiate house \u2013 a training establishment \u2013 for the Roman Catholic Servite Friars.'Begbroke', Wikipedia. Helen Eden was a tertiary \u2013 i.e. a lay member \u2013 of the Servite Order.Katherine Br\u00e9gy, 'Helen Parry Eden: Modern Medievalist' , Catholic World, vol. 118, no. 705 (December 1923), pp. 318\u201324. As an aspect of her devotional work she undertook two educational projects with the Catholic publishers Burns & Oates. The Rhyme of the Servants of Mary (1919) was a 25-page booklet (with an illustration by Denis Eden) that retold the legend of the founding of the Servite Order.The Graphic, 17 May 1919. A String of Sapphires \u2013 Being Mysteries of the Life and Death of Our Blessed Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, Put into English Verse for the Young and Simple was a more substantial book, of 173 pages, published in January 1920.", "Helen Eden's time at Begbroke was hugely productive. She was now established as an academic and literary critic, writing in the highly esteemed Dublin Review, for example,See for example her 'Hearts and Heads', Dublin Review, June\u2013September 1920, pp. 68\u201374. and regularly contributing to Blackfriars, a magazine founded in 1920 as a focus of Catholic Christian reflection on current events.See for example her 'Bernard Shaw on Ruskin', Blackfriars, vol. 3, no. 27 (June 1922), pp. 168\u201371. A profile article on her by Katherine Br\u00e9gy in Catholic WorldBr\u00e9gy, 'Helen Parry Eden'. described her as a 'Modern Medievalist': 'When the Oxford anchorite is not speaking in poetry, she divides her pen between sprightly book-reviews for Punch \u2026 and a series of medieval prose legends contributed to other magazines. There is much charm and piquancy in these pointed and moraled tales dug up nominally from the archives of the Bodleian but essentially from her own fancy'.Examples of these mediaeval tales include 'The Noble Knight and the Six Old Donkeys' (Blackfriars, vol. 2, no. 24 (March 1922), pp. 746\u20139) and 'The Parson of Salisbury and the Three Painted Coffers' (Blackfriars, vol. 3, no. 35 (February1923), pp. 639\u201348).", "Br\u00e9gy also explained Helen Eden's personal circumstances in 1923: 'Mrs. Eden to-day is a modern and feminine \"clerk of Oxford\" living chiefly alone with her flocks of fancies \u2013 since the schools have carried off her children,It seems likely that Helen Eden's wealthy parents may have paid the children's boarding-school fees.  and Italy has carried off her husband because of temporary ill-health.' But she clarified the importance of the Eden's marital relationship 'Then may come a visit to Vicenza (which means a visit to \"Denis\"!)'.Br\u00e9gy, 'Helen Parry Eden', p. 323.", "With no further work exhibited at the Royal Academy until 1928, there may have been further extensive periods in Italy for Denis Eden \u2013 and perhaps for the family. Writing in 1925 Helen Eden commented, 'Having been all my life a great lover of Italy, I have to while away the time when I am not actually in 'the land of lands' by reading books about it.'Helen Parry Eden, 'Richard Lassels and his \"Voyage of Italy\",' Blackfriars, vol. 6, no. 66 (September 1925), pp. 509\u201318.

The Eden's British address in 1928 was The Old Church House at Woodstock, but they had 'found a second home' in Italy.Br\u00e9gy, 'Who's Who Among Catholic Writers'. Eden was elected an associate of the Royal West of England Academy in 1928, and in the following year became a full member.Western Daily Press, 11 December 1928, 17 December 1929.", "In 1932 Helen Eden became vice-president of the Poetry Society,'Richard Lowndes on the Rhymes of Helen Parry Eden,'  Catholic Herald, 5 February 1993. and in the following year Denis contributed illustrations to a collection of her 'medieval' stories for Blackfriars magazine republished in America as Whistles of Silver and Other Stories.Milwaukee: Bruce Publishing Co., 1933. The copy in the British Library is a 'presentation copy to Mr. and Mrs. G. K. Chesterton from the author and her husband'.", "As the Second World War broke out in September 1939, Denis and Helen Eden were living at 181 Rectory Lane, Woodstock. In the 1939 England and Wales Register Denis Eden still gave his profession as 'Artist', while Helen Eden was 'Author, Literary Critic on Staff of \"Punch\"',ancestry.co.uk. although after the last collection of her work in 1943 she largely stopped writing.'Richard Lowndes on the Rhymes of Helen Parry Eden'.", "Helen Eden lived another eleven years in Woodstock.EDEN, Helen Parry of 23 Rectory Lane Woodstock and of Brookside, Church Enstone both in Oxfordshire widow died 19 December 1960 at Brookside Church \u2026 Effects \u00a33,665' \u2013 probate record, ancestry.co.uk. In the Catholic newspaper The Tablet, Father Illtud Evans, O.P., wrote, 'The last ten years of her life had been for Helen Parry Eden, who died on December 19th, a time of constant pain and loneliness. There were few to remember.'The Tablet, 7 January 1961."]}]}}
