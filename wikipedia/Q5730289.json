He went to New Zealand in 1823 as a missionary. The Bay of Islands M\u0101ori gave Williams the nickname Karu-wh\u0101 (\"Four-eyes\" as he wore spectacles). He was known more widely as Te Wiremu. ('Wiremu' being the M\u0101ori form of 'William'). His younger brother, William Williams, was also a missionary in New Zealand and known as \"the scholar-surgeon\". Their grandfather, the Reverend Thomas Williams (1725\u20131770), was a Congregational minister at the Independent Chapel of Gosport.Although Williams was not the first missionary in New Zealand \u2013 Thomas Kendall, John Gare Butler, John King and William Hall having come before him \u2013 he was \"the first to make the mission a success, partly because the others had opened up the way, but largely because he was the only man brave enough, stubborn enough, and strong enough to keep going, no matter what the dangers, and no matter what enemies he made\".In 1840, Williams translated the Treaty of Waitangi into the M\u0101ori language, with some help from his son Edward.On 21 September 1844, Williams was installed as Archdeacon of Te Waimate in the diocese centred on Te Waimate mission.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Treaty of Waitangi", "response": ["While heading the parliamentary campaign against the British slave trade for twenty years until the passage of the Slave Trade Act of 1807, William Wilberforce championed the foundation of the Church Missionary Society (CMS) in 1799, with other members of the Clapham Sect including John Venn, determined to improve the treatment of indigenous people by the British. This led to the establishment of their Christian mission in New Zealand, which saw laymen arriving from 1814 to teach building, farming and Christianity to M\u0101ori, as well as training 'native' ministers. The M\u0101ori language (Te Reo M\u0101ori) did not then have an indigenous writing system. Missionaries learned to speak M\u0101ori, and introduced the Latin alphabet. The CMS, including Thomas Kendall; M\u0101ori, including T\u012btore and  Hongi Hika; and Cambridge University's Samuel Lee, developed the written language between 1817 and 1830. In 1833, while living in the Paihia mission house of Anglican priest and the now head of the New Zealand CMS mission (later to become the New Zealand Church Missionary Society) Rev Henry Williams, missioner William Colenso published the Te Reo translations of books of the Bible, the first books printed in New Zealand. His 1837 M\u0101ori New Testament was the first indigenous language translation of the Bible published in the southern hemisphere. Demand for the Te Reo New Testament, and the Prayer Book that followed, grew exponentially, as did Christian M\u0101ori leadership and public Christian services, with 33,000 M\u0101ori soon attending regularly. Literacy and understanding the Bible increased mana and social and economic benefits, decreased slavery and intertribal violence, and increased peace and respect for all people in M\u0101ori society, including women.", "Assuming that a treaty in English could not be understood, debated or agreed to by M\u0101ori, Hobson asked CMS head missioner Henry Williams, and his son Edward Marsh Williams, who was a scholar in M\u0101ori language and custom, to translate the document overnight on 4 February. Henry Williams was concerned with the actions of the New Zealand Company in Wellington and felt he had to agree with Hobson's request to ensure the treaty would be as favourable as possible to M\u0101ori. Williams avoided using any English words that had no expression in M\u0101ori \"thereby preserving entire the spirit and tenor\" of the treaty. He added a note to the copy Hobson sent to Gibbs stating, \"I certify that the above is as literal a translation of the Treaty of Waitangi as the idiom of the language will allow.\" ", "French Catholic Bishop Jean-Baptiste Pompallier soon joined the gathering and after Anglican English priest and CMS mission head Rev Henry Williams read the Te Reo translation aloud from a final parchment version. Pompallier spoke to Hobson who then addressed Williams:", "* the Henry Williams copy (132 signatures),", "Furthermore, k\u0101wanatanga is a loan translation from \"governorship\" and was not part of the M\u0101ori language. The term had been used by Henry Williams in his translation of the Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand which was signed by 35 northern M\u0101ori chiefs at Waitangi on 28 October 1835. The Declaration of Independence of New Zealand had stated \"Ko te K\u012bngitanga ko te mana i te w[h]enua\" to describe \"all sovereign power and authority in the land\". There is considerable debate about what would have been a more appropriate term. Some scholars, notably Ruth Ross, argue that mana (prestige, authority) would have more accurately conveyed the transfer of sovereignty. However, it has more recently been argued by others, including Judith Binney, that mana would not have been appropriate. This is because mana is not the same thing as sovereignty, and also because no-one can give up their mana."]}, {"page": "M\u0101ori culture", "response": ["Because of the very small number of Europeans who arrived in New Zealand in the 18th and early 19th century, the core values of M\u0101ori culture were, at first, altered little. Henry Williams estimated there were only 1100 Europeans in the North Island in 1839, with 200 of them missionaries, and a total of about 500\u2013600 Europeans in the Bay of Islands. The northern M\u0101ori population at the time has been estimated at about 30,000 to 40,000, down from about 100,000, fifty years before. This drop in population was mostly due to the introduction of European disease (Measles and influenza) and to the Musket Wars of 1807\u20131837.", "The first Christian mission was established in 1814 by Samuel Marsden in the Bay of Islands. Because the missionaries were dependent on M\u0101ori for many basic necessities, they traded muskets and iron tools for food. By the time this practice was discouraged by Henry Williams and finally prohibited by the governor, it had already significantly altered intertribal conflict which quickly led to the Musket Wars of the 1820s and a dramatic increase in casualties of conflict. Alcohol was not present in M\u0101ori culture before European contact and it had a negative effect on individual and collective health. Many M\u0101ori supported Henry Williams who opposed \"the activities of grog-sellers, gun-runners and other irreligious Europeans in the Bay of Islands.\" The mission at \"Paihia, directly opposite the notoriously lawless settlement of Koror\u0101reka (later Russell), [was set up] to contrast Christianity with the decadent forms of European life.\"", "Generally, only female slaves were kept as they were considered to be less of a threat and more useful as potato farmers and partners. In 1834 Ngapuhi, perhaps partly due to the influence of missionaries such as Henry Williams, freed slaves they had captured in earlier wars, The only place in New Zealand where slavery was common after 1835 was in the Chatham Islands. During the Musket Wars, North Taranaki tribes Ngati Tama and Ngati Mutanga invaded, massacred and enslaved the remaining population until about 1863.", "From the early 1970s a new generation of radicals arose demanding more M\u0101ori influence. Amongst the demands were for increased . The expression, an abstraction of the word for aristocracy, had been coined by Henry Williams in the Treaty of Waitangi to convey the idea of \"chieftainship\". However, the term was often used by M\u0101ori to express the idea of political rights for all M\u0101ori, not just the  class, or the idea of M\u0101ori sovereignty or M\u0101ori independence.", "CMS missionaries insisted M\u0101ori abandon cannibalism and child infanticide before they could be baptised. They tried to discourage polygamy. Some early missionaries had sympathy for abandoned wives but Henry Williams was adamant that polygamy disqualified M\u0101ori from baptism. CMS missionaries also outlawed the use of further , taking part in lewd dances and practising customary funeral rites. Catholic missionaries who arrived 20 years after the Church of England CMS missionaries were less concerned with stopping these customary practices before Christian conversion. They reasoned that they could influence M\u0101ori more effectively after baptism and were subsequently successful in attracting many converts in the western Hokianga district, away from the dominant CMS influence.", "Canoes () were used extensively. These ranged from small river-going boats, to the large  sea-going war vessels carrying up to 80 paddlers, and up to  long. Waka were used extensively for long-range travel down the east coast and to cross Cook Strait. In 1822\u201323 Te Rauparah\u0101, who had established a base by capturing Kapiti Island, reconnoitred the upper South Island in waka before launching a seaborne invasion the following year against Ng\u0101i Tahu and Rangit\u0101ne iwi. Te Rauparah\u0101 later hired a European ship to attack Akaroa Harbour. This showed that Te Rauparaha was prepared to use Western technology to further his own goals. Henry Williams, who followed several war parties, reported as many as 50 waka taua travelling together at one time, although he reported they only went out to sea in relatively calm weather. From 1835 large numbers of European ships entered the Bay of Islands every year with Henry Williams reporting an average of 70\u201380 ships per year. Many M\u0101ori men worked on the ships, with a reported average of eight M\u0101ori seamen per whaling ship. Ten metre long whaleboats began to be used by M\u0101ori. They could be both rowed and sailed. In the 1850s as M\u0101ori with the active encouragement of Grey embraced trade were gradually able to develop a large fleet of small trading schooners and similar craft. All the initial European centres had been supported by Maori."]}, {"page": "Flagstaff War", "response": ["The trial and execution of Wiremu K\u012bngi Maket\u016b in 1842 for murder was, in the opinion of Archdeacon Henry Williams, the beginning of Heke's antagonism towards the colonial administration, as Heke began gathering support thereafter among the Ng\u0101puhi for a rebellion. However it was not until 1844 that H\u014dne Heke sought support from Te Ruki Kawiti and other leaders of the Ng\u0101puhi iwi by the conveying of 'te ng\u0101kau', the custom observed by those who sought help to settle a tribal grievance.", "The flagstaff which had proved so controversial was not re-elected. Whilst the region was still nominally under British influence, the fact that the Government's flag was not re-erected was symbolically very significant.

These are humiliating facts to the proud Englishman, many of whom thought they could govern by a mere name.\" The flagstaff that now stands at Koror\u0101reka was erected in January 1858 at the direction of Kawiti's son Maihi Paraone Kawiti; the symbolism of the erection of the fifth flagstaff at Koror\u0101reka by the Ng\u0101puhi warriors who had conducted the Flagstaff War, and not by government decree, indicates the colonial government did not want to risk any further confrontation with the Ng\u0101puhi."]}, {"page": "Flag of New Zealand", "response": ["The first flag of New Zealand was adopted 9 (or 20) March 1834 by a vote made by the United Tribes of New Zealand, a meeting of M\u0101ori chiefs convened at Waitangi by British resident James Busby.

Three flags were proposed, all designed by the missionary Henry Williams, who was to play a major role in the translation of the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840. The chiefs rejected two other proposals which included the Union Jack, in favour of a modified St George's Cross or the White Ensign, which was the flag used by Henry Williams on the Church Missionary Society ships.

Grey, with Lieutenant Franklin Lushington, of the 9th (East Norfolk) Regiment of Foot, offered to explore the region. On 5 July 1837, they sailed from Plymouth in command of a party of five, the others being Lushington; Dr William Walker, a surgeon and naturalist; and Corporals John Coles and Richard Auger of the Royal Sappers and Miners. Joining the party at Cape Town were Sapper Private Robert Mustard, J.C. Cox, Thomas Ruston, Evan Edwards, Henry Williams, and Robert Inglesby. In December they landed at Hanover Bay (west of Uwins Island in the Bonaparte Archipelago). Travelling south, the party traced the course of the Glenelg River. After experiencing boat wrecks, near-drowning, becoming completely lost, and Grey himself being speared in the hip during a skirmish with Aboriginal people, the party gave up. After being picked up by HMS Beagle and the schooner Lynher, they were taken to Mauritius to recover. Lieutenant Lushington was then mobilised to rejoin his regiment in the First Anglo-Afghan War.
