He went to New Zealand in 1823 as a missionary. The Bay of Islands M\u0101ori gave Williams the nickname Karu-wh\u0101 (\"Four-eyes\" as he wore spectacles). He was known more widely as Te Wiremu. ('Wiremu' being the M\u0101ori form of 'William'). His younger brother, William Williams, was also a missionary in New Zealand and known as \"the scholar-surgeon\". Their grandfather, the Reverend Thomas Williams (1725\u20131770), was a Congregational minister at the Independent Chapel of Gosport.Although Williams was not the first missionary in New Zealand \u2013 Thomas Kendall, John Gare Butler, John King and William Hall having come before him \u2013 he was \"the first to make the mission a success, partly because the others had opened up the way, but largely because he was the only man brave enough, stubborn enough, and strong enough to keep going, no matter what the dangers, and no matter what enemies he made\".In 1840, Williams translated the Treaty of Waitangi into the M\u0101ori language, with some help from his son Edward.On 21 September 1844, Williams was installed as Archdeacon of Te Waimate in the diocese centred on Te Waimate mission.", "link_mentions": {}}}
