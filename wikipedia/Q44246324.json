He developed his thought through practical projects and experiments. A common thread throughout his work was how collaboration, rather than competition, could be a driving force behind economic development and provide the foundation for non-exploitative and egalitarian societies.\nRobin Murray influenced how people eat, shop, and work, how we create and handle waste. He was an influential member of the democratic-socialist movement in Britain, playing a role in setting up organisations such as Twin and Twin Trading (an alternative trading and development organisation from which emerged farmer-owned Fairtrade companies Caf\u00e9direct, Divine Chocolate and Liberation Nuts), the London Food Commission and The London Climate Change Agency. He also played a role as a policymaker, first as Chief Economic Advisor to the Greater London Council in the early 1980s and later in the 1990s in shaping London\u2019s waste strategy. While working on these practical initiatives he taught at the Institute of Development Studies at  the University of Sussex, and later at the London School of Economics and Schumacher College. Over the years he published articles including those describing the concepts of post-Fordism, zero-waste and social innovation. He was awarded posthumously the Albert Medal of the Royal Society of Arts in October 2017, for \"pioneering work in social innovation\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Corv\u00e9e", "response": ["Native Labour Regulations, section 1, 1899, Lisbon; in Gordon White, Robin Murray, and Christina White, Eds., Revolutionary Socialist Development in the Third World. 1983; Sussex, U.K.; Wheatsheaf Books. p.77."]}, {"page": "Albert Medal (Royal Society of Arts)", "response": ["* 2017: Robin Murray (posthumous), 'for pioneering work in social innovation'"]}, {"page": "Differential and absolute ground rent", "response": [" in the third volume of Das KapitalKarl  Marx, Das Kapital Vol. 3, Part 6.  to explain how the capitalist mode of production would operate in agricultural production,Utsa Patnaik, The Agrarian Question in Marx and his Successors, Vol. I.
