As Ipswich were in a poor run of form both domestically and in European competition, manager Bobby Robson had declared the FA Cup contest against Cardiff as \"the most important match the club is going to play this season\". Ipswich won the match 2\u20130 with both goals coming from Paul Mariner, the England international centre forward.  The match also saw captain Mick Mills making his 494th appearance for Ipswich, a club record.  Ipswich were drawn against Fourth Division Hartlepool United in the fourth round.  A controversial penalty awarded to Ipswich in the sixth minute was converted by Colin Viljoen after Derrick Downing was adjudged to have fouled Mariner.  Ipswich extended their lead with a second from Mariner before Downing pulled one back for Hartlepool.  Second half goals from Brian Talbot and Viljoen ended the tie 4\u20131 in favour of the East Anglian team who progressed to the fifth round where they faced Bristol Rovers.  The game was played on a frozen Eastville Stadium pitch and the lower league team came into the match against Ipswich having lost just two of their previous fourteen matches.  A Talbot throw-in was collected by Clive Woods whose cross was converted by Robin Turner.  Rovers' equaliser came early in the second half as Ipswich goalkeeper Paul Cooper failed to clear a corner which was subsequently headed in by midfielder David Williams.  Fifteen minutes later, the Bristol club took the lead, Williams scoring after a Russell Osman clearance.  Bobby Gould then scored for Rovers but the goal was disallowed and with four minutes to go, Mariner secured an equaliser to send the game to a replay at Portman Road.  Ipswich pressed early on but with no reward for their domination and had to wait until the 26th minute to capitalise.  A corner from Woods was converted by Mick Mills at the far post.  As Rovers went in search of an equaliser, Mariner scored following good passing work from Allan Hunter and Mills.  Woods scored a third with ten minutes remaining to end the match 3\u20130 and send Ipswich into the sixth round to face Millwall."]}, {"page": "1970\u201371 Football League", "response": ["|28||align=left|  Derrick Downing ||align=left| Middlesbrough ||11||1||1||13"]}, {"page": "Derrick (name)", "response": ["*Derrick Downing (born 1945), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Derrick Graham Downing", "response": ["#REDIRECT Derrick Downing"]}, {"page": "Outwood Academy Adwick", "response": ["* Derrick Downing (1957 entrant), Professional Footballer."]}]}}
