The pseudonym was presumably taken from the title character of Thackeray's 1844 novel.\nBorn in London, he may be best remembered for his stage play The Man in Half Moon Street, which opened at London's New Theatre on 22 March 1939 and ran for 172 performances, starring Leslie Banks, Malcolm Keen and Ann Todd, as well as for three screenplays from the 1940s: The Lodger (1944), Hangover Square (1945) and The Man in Half Moon Street (1945). The last was remade by Hammer Film Productions in 1959 as The Man Who Could Cheat Death.\nLyndon began his writing career as a journalist, particularly about motor-racing, and short-story writer before becoming a playwright. His first play, The Amazing Dr. Clitterhouse, was made into an Edward G. Robinson film in 1939.  After that success, Lyndon moved to Los Angeles, California, in 1941 to concentrate on writing for films full-time. He was naturalised as a United States citizen in the United States District Court in Los Angeles as Alfred Edgar Barre Lyndon in 1952.\nAlfred Edgar had two sons, Roger Alvin Edgar (b. England, 1924) and Barry Davis Edgar (b. England, 1929) .", "link_mentions": {}}}
