He was subsequently removed from the transfer list by the following manager, Brian Laws. Whelan repaid the faith shown in him with seven goals. He then went on to win a number of player of the year awards for the club's 2006\u201307 season. His performances led to manager Laws entering into contract negotiations with Whelan. Sheffield Wednesday rejected bids for Whelan from both Burnley and Plymouth Argyle in January 2008.

March also saw defender Jamie Vincent released from the club after not featuring in Holdsworth's first team plans, as well as a first team opportunity for youth team winger Adam Mekki. The \"Shots\" continued their unbeaten run into the first half of April, before defeat finally came at home to Burton Albion. At the end of the campaign Aldershot posted a comfortable mid-table finish, and Holdsworth handed out contracts to young players Adam Mekki, Doug Bergqvist and Henrik Breimyr.

The player cut his toe on glass, severing tendons and requiring surgery which ruled him out of competitive action for three months. But he bounced back on his return, forming a good partnership with Deon Burton, to score six goals in five games. He was moved out to the wing after injuries to Wade Small and Jermaine Johnson but still finished the season with 11 goals. The 2007\u201308 season saw Tudgay add eight goals to his career record, the most notable of these was a second half volley to lead his team to a 2\u20130 victory in the Steel City derby at Hillsborough and another goal against Derby County in the FA Cup which helped to earn his team a replay.
