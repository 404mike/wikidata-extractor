He worked extensively with Soane both as draughtsman and creative partner from 1798 until 1809 when he (ultimately unsuccessfully) set up his own practice.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lancaster Castle", "response": ["Prison reformer John Howard (1726\u20131790) visited Lancaster in 1776 and noted the conditions in the prison. His efforts to instigate reform led to prisoners in gaols throughout the country being separated by gender and category of their crime. Improvements were also made to sanitation; in the 18th\u00a0century more people died from gaol fever than by hanging. In the last two decades of the century, around \u00a330,000 was spent rebuilding Lancaster's county gaol. Architect Thomas Harrison was commissioned to complete the work. Under his auspices, the Gaoler's House was built in 1788 in a Gothic style. Separate prisons were built for men and women. The Shire Hall and Crown Court were complete by 1798. Harrison had to divide his time between Lancaster and designing and building Chester Castle's Shire Hall and Courts; work at Lancaster slowed, partly because of dwindling funds due to war with France, and Harrison was released from the work as the Justices of the Peace felt it was taking too long. The artist Robert Freebairn was paid \u00a3500 to paint twelve watercolours of the work in 1800 to be presented to the Duke of Lancaster, King George\u00a0III. In 1802 the castle received more funding and Joseph Gandy was commissioned to complete the interiors of the Shire Hall and Crown Court."]}, {"page": "Panopticon", "response": ["In 1812 persistent problems with Newgate Prison and other London prisons prompted the British government to fund the construction of a prison in Millbank at the taxpayers' expense. Based on Bentham's panopticon plans, the National Penitentiary opened in 1821. Millbank Prison, as it became known, was controversial and failed in extracting valuable labour out of prisoners. Millbank Prison was even blamed for causing mental illness among prisoners. Nevertheless, the British government placed an increasing emphasis on prisoners doing meaningful work, instead of engaging in humiliating and meaningless kill-times. Bentham lived to see Millbank Prison built and did not support the approach taken by the British government. His writings had virtually no immediate effect on the architecture of taxpayer-funded prisons that were to be built. Between 1818 and 1821 a small prison for women was built in Lancaster. It has been observed that the architect Joseph Gandy modelled it very closely on Bentham's panopticon prison plans. The K-wing near Lancaster Castle prison is a semi-rotunda with a central tower for the supervisor and five storeys with nine cells on each floor."]}, {"page": "Sir John Soane's Museum", "response": ["There are over 30,000 architectural drawings in the collection.

The new buildings had to be placed between the existing medieval castle buildings, including the keep, towers and the gatehouse.  Harrison decided to design them with Gothic motifs, such as battlements and windows with pointed heads.  Construction started in 1788, and the first building to be completed was the Keeper's House, standing to the right of the gatehouse.  The next substantial building to be completed was the Female Felon's Prison on the other side of the gatehouse.  He designed an arcade on the south side of the keep to give some shelter to the debtors as they walked round their courtyard.  He later added two storeys to provide more accommodation for debtors, and completed the Male Felon's Prison to the north of the keep.  By 1794 these buildings and other improvements had cost \u00a310,853 (), more than had been expected.  By 1795 Harrison had moved from Lancaster to Chester, from where he continued to supervise the work on both sites.  At Lancaster this work included rebuilding the Crown Court and the Shire Hall.  At that time the Crown Court was held in the medieval hall of the castle, and civil cases were held in the Shire Hall in the keep.  The new buildings form a symmetrical group to the west of the keep, and were completed in 1798, although the internal decoration and furnishings were not finished until some years later by Joseph Gandy.  The Crown Court is a simple rectangular room, measuring about  by  high and wide.  The Shire Hall has a plan of half a polygon about  in diameter.  Six Gothic columns support a panelled vault covering the main part of the courtroom.  Around the perimeter is an arcade, and the judge's bench has an elaborate canopy in Coade stone.  The precise cost of these buildings is unknown, but in 1807 an estimate of more than \u00a340,000 () was given."]}, {"page": "1771 in architecture", "response": ["* Joseph Gandy, English architectural artist and architect (died 1843)"]}, {"page": "Robin Gandy", "response": ["Robin Gandy was born in the village of Rotherfield Peppard, Oxfordshire, England.
