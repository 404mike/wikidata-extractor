Mankiewicz, who won the award in two consecutive years, 1949 and 1950. Others to win twice in this category include: George Seaton, Robert Bolt (who also won in consecutive years), Francis Ford Coppola, Mario Puzo, Alvin Sargent, Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, Michael Wilson, Alexander Payne and Christopher Hampton. Payne won both awards as part of a writing team, with Jim Taylor for Sideways and Jim Rash and Nat Faxon for The Descendants. Michael Wilson was blacklisted at the time of his second Oscar, so the award was given to a front (novelist Pierre Boulle). However, the Academy officially recognized him as the winner several years later.", "Mario Puzo is the one of two writers whose work has been adapted and resulted in two wins. Puzo's novel The Godfather resulted in wins in 1972 and 1974 for himself and Francis Ford Coppola. The other is E. M. Forster, whose novels A Room with a View and Howards End resulted in wins for Ruth Prawer Jhabvala.", "| Ruth Prawer Jhabvala", "| Ruth Prawer Jhabvala", "| Ruth Prawer Jhabvala", "*Ruth Prawer Jhabvala", "*Ruth Prawer Jhabvala"]}, {"page": "List of winners and shortlisted authors of the Booker Prize", "response": ["| rowspan=\"2\"| 1975|| style=\"background:gold;white-space:nowrap\" | Ruth Prawer Jhabvala || style=\"background:gold;white-space:nowrap\" |  Heat and Dust || style=\"background:gold;white-space:nowrap\" | John Murray"]}]}}
