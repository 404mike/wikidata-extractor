In the final Britain led from start to finish to win the gold medal for the first time since the 1912 Stockholm Olympic Games, with West being the youngest member of the crew, and the first member of Cambridge University to win at the Olympics while still a student. Australia took the silver.

The crew also contained two of the 2000 British Eight, Luka Grubor and Steve Trapmore, and two members of the 2001 Cambridge Blue Boat, Tom Stallard and Christian Cormack.
