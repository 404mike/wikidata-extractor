From 1 December 1829 to 9 April 1834, he attended lectures on anatomy under Jones Quain, dissection under Richard Quain, and surgery under Samuel Cooper. In November of the latter year he attended the North London Hospital, obtained the membership of the College of Surgeons on 22 December 1835, and settled in practice at Canterbury. He was the author of Affinities of Plants, with some Observations upon Progressive Development, London, 1839, 8vo. He is stated to have died in London in 1840, but his name appears in the college annual list of members so late as 1843.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Celastrales", "response": ["The name Celastrales was first used by Thomas Baskerville in 1839.Thomas Baskerville. Affinities of Plants: with some observations upon progressive development. page 104.. Taylor and Walton: Gower Street, London. (1839). In the time since Baskerville first defined the order, until the 21st century, great differences of opinion occurred about what should be included in the order and in its largest family, the Celastraceae. The family Celastraceae was the only group consistently placed in the order by all authors who accepted it. Because of the ambiguity and complexity of its definition, the Celastraceae became a dumping ground for genera of dubious affinity. Several genera were assigned to this family with considerable doubt about whether they really belonged there. Also, some genera that properly belong in the Celastraceae were placed elsewhere."]}, {"page": "Thomas Baskerville", "response": ["Thomas Baskerville may refer to:", "*Thomas Baskerville (died 1572), MP for Worcestershire", "*Thomas Baskerville (general) (died 1597), MP for Carmarthen Boroughs", "*Thomas Baskerville (topographer) (1630\u20131720), English topographer", "*Thomas Baskerville (botanist) (1812\u20131840), English botanical writer", "*Thomas Baskerville Mynors Baskerville, British politician"]}, {"page": "Thomas Baskerville (writer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Thomas Baskerville (botanist)"]}, {"page": "T.Baskerv.", "response": ["#REDIRECT Thomas Baskerville (botanist)"]}, {"page": "List of botanists by author abbreviation (T\u2013V)", "response": ["* T.Baskerv. \u2013 Thomas Baskerville (1812\u20131840)"]}, {"page": "List of plant genera named for people (A\u2013C)", "response": ["|data-sort-value=\"Baskerville\"|Thomas Baskerville"]}]}}
