His later assignments included The Greek Tycoon (1978), The Awakening (1980), The Mirror Crack'd (1980), and The Jigsaw Man (1983) before he moved into television with excellent sets for the Ian Richardson version of The Hound of the Baskervilles (1983). He designed the TV series Paradise Postponed (1986) and, as in the earlier Inspector Clouseau, his resemblance to Harold Wilson led to his making a cameo appearance as the former prime minister.\nStringer explained much about art direction generally and his own approach, in contributing to a textbook, Film Design (1974), when he was President of the Guild of Film Art Directors (Now known as the British Film Designers Guild British Film Designers Guild.)", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Academy Award for Best Production Design", "response": ["| Robert F.
