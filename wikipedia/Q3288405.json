A pathway for the graduates was thus established in the archives, first implemented by the Order of 31 December 1846, then reinforced by a legislative framework providing them with a means to enforce this law. The decree of 4 February 1850 reserved the posts of departmental archivist to those holding the qualification of archivist-paleographer,See Vincent Mollet, \"La conqu\u00eate des archives d\u00e9partementales\", in \u00c9cole nationale des Chartes.

It was not until the end of the Second Empire, partly thanks to the work of L\u00e9opold Delisle, the general administrator of the national library, that the qualifications of the school's graduates were recognized by libraries.See Louis Desgraves, \"Quelques \u00e9minents biblioth\u00e9caires: galerie\", in \u00c9cole nationale des Chartes.
