He is also a consulting professor in the Department of Applied Physics at Stanford University and director of the IBM-Stanford Spintronic Science and Applications Center, which was formed in 2004.He is a pioneer in the science and application of spintronic materials, and has made discoveries into the behaviour of thin-film magnetic structures that were critical in enabling recent increases in the data density and capacity of computer hard-disk drives. For these discoveries, he was awarded the 2014 Millennium Technology Prize.\nSince 1 April 2014, Parkin is a director at the Max Planck Institute of Microstructure Physics in Halle and a professor at the Institute of Physics at the Martin-Luther-University Halle-Wittenberg.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "IBM Research", "response": ["The following are some of the famous scientists who have worked in the past or are currently working in this laboratory: Rakesh Agrawal, Rama Akkiraju, John Backus, Raymond F.
