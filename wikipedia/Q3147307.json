Of the 26\u00a0tour matches, he played in 17, only bettered by captain John Dawes and \"Mighty Mouse\" prop Ian McLauchlan.

All six games had been won by the Lions and John had recorded 88 points, including a full house against Waikato. In the First Test John terrorised New Zealand's fullback Fergie McCormick with ruthless tactical kicking. The All Blacks were shunted all over the field by John, who was well protected by his forwards, something that he was not afforded with Wales in 1969.
