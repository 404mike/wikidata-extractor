His only objection to the role was Bob being a fan of Manchester United F.C., the team Shindler had named Red Productions for, because of his prolific support of Arsenal F.C.

When he creates characters, he initially assigns a character a name and fits attributes around it. In the case of Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) in his inaugural series of Doctor Who, he chose the name because he considered it a \"good luck charm\" after he used it for Lesley Sharp's character in Bob & Rose. He presented his desire to make the show \"essentially British\" as another justification: he considered Rose to be \"the most British name in the world\" and feminine enough to subvert the then-current trend of female companions and their \"boyish\" names, such as Benny, Charley, and Ace. While he was writing for The Grand, the executive producer requested that he change the female lead character's name, a decision that led to the \"character never [feeling] right from that moment on\". The surname \"Harkness\", most notably given to Torchwood lead Captain Jack Harkness, is a similar charm, first used in 1993 for the Harkness family in Century Falls, and ultimately derived from the Marvel Universe supporting character Agatha Harkness, and the surname \"Tyler\" is similarly used because of his affection for how the surname is spelled and pronounced."]}, {"page": "Bill Nighy", "response": ["He played Samwise Gamgee in the 1981 BBC Radio dramatisation of The Lord of the Rings (where he was credited as William Nighy), and appeared in the 1980s BBC Radio versions of Yes Minister episodes.
