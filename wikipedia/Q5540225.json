He won the Springburn seat with a large majority at the 1922 general election, helped by the absence of a Liberal Party candidate.  He was re-elected at the next three consecutive general elections, but when Labour's vote collapsed at the 1931 general election, Hardie was one of those who lost his seat \u2014 by a narrow majority of only 34 votes, the left-wing vote having been split by the presence of a Communist Party candidate.Hardie was re-elected with a large majority at the 1935 general election, and died in office two years later, aged 63.
