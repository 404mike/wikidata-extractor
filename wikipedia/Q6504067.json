The War Cabinet met at least daily until it was dissolved on 12 August.

However, once a decision was reached she \"did not look back\".", "Historian Lawrence Freedman, who was given access to official sources, comments that the significance of the Vulcan raids remains a subject of controversy. Although they took pressure off the small Sea Harrier force, the raids were costly and used a great deal of resources. The single hit in the centre of the runway was probably the best that could have been expected, but it did reduce the capability of the runway to operate fast jets and caused the Argentine air force to deploy Mirage IIIs to defend the capital. Argentine sources confirm that the Vulcan raids influenced Argentina to shift some of its Mirage IIIs from southern Argentina to the Buenos Aires Defence Zone. This dissuasive effect was watered down when British officials made clear that there would not be strikes on air bases in Argentina. The raids were later dismissed as propaganda by Falklands veteran Commander Nigel Ward.: \"Propaganda was, of course, used later to try to justify these missions: 'The Mirage IIIs were withdrawn from Southern Argentina to Buenos Aires to add to the defences there following the Vulcan raids on the islands.' Apparently the logic behind this statement was that if the Vulcan could hit Port Stanley, the  Buenos Aires was well within range as well and was vulnerable to similar attacks. I never went along with that baloney. A lone Vulcan or two running in to attack Buenos Aires without fighter support would have been shot to hell in quick time.\"-\"Mirage IIIs were in evidence near the islands on several occasions during the conflict, either escorting the Neptune reconnaissance missions or on 'interference' flights that attempted to draw CAP attention away from air-to-ground attacks.\"-\"Suffice it to say that you didn't need more than one or two Mirage IIIs to intercept a Vulcan attack on Buenos Aires\"-\"It would have taken much more than a lone Vulcan raid to upset Buenos Aires\""]}, {"page": "Strategy", "response": ["The father of Western modern strategic study, Carl von Clausewitz, defined military strategy as \"the employment of battles to gain the end of war.\" B.

According to Cabinet Office official histories (Official History of the Falkland Islands, Sir Lawrence Freedman), Sir John Nott, as Secretary of State for Defence, expressed the British Government's concern that the Gurkhas could not be sent with the task force to recapture the Falkland Islands because it might upset the non-aligned members of the fragile coalition of support that the British had built in the United Nations. The then-Chief of Defence Staff Sir Edwin Bramall, a former officer in the 2nd Gurkhas like Nott, said that the Gurkhas were needed for sound military reasons (as a constituent part of 5th Infantry Brigade) and if they were not deployed then there would always be a political reason not to deploy Gurkhas in future conflicts. So he requested that Nott argue the case in Government for deploying them against the advice of the Foreign Office.

Presidents Mikhail Gorbachev and George H. W. Bush used the term to try to define the nature of the post-Cold War era and the spirit of great power cooperation that they hoped might materialize. Gorbachev's initial formulation was wide-ranging and idealistic, but his ability to press for it was severely limited by the internal crisis of the Soviet system. In comparison, Bush's vision was not less circumscribed: \"A hundred generations have searched for this elusive path to peace, while a thousand wars raged across the span of human endeavor. Today that new world is struggling to be born, a world quite different from the one we've known\". However, given the new unipolar status of the United States, Bush's vision was realistic in saying that \"there is no substitute for American leadership\". The Gulf War of 1991 was regarded as the first test of the new world order: \"Now, we can see a new world coming into view. A world in which there is the very real prospect of a new world order. ... The Gulf War put this new world to its first test\".Lawrence Freedman, 'The Gulf War and the New World Order,' Survival, 33/3, (1991): p 195-196.", "In fact, as Lawrence Freedman commented in 1991, a \"unipolar\" world is now taken seriously. He details:", "Washington's capacity to exert overwhelming military power and leadership over a multinational coalition provides the \"basis for a Pax Americana\". Indeed, one of the problems with Bush's phrase was that \"a call for 'order' from Washington chills practically everyone else, because it sounds suspiciously like a Pax Americana\".Lawrence Freedman, 'The Gulf War and the New World Order,' Survival, 33/3, (1991): p 196-197. The unipolarity, Krauthammer noted, is the \"most striking feature of the post-Cold War world\". The article proved to be epochal. Twelve years later, Krauthammer in \"The Unipolar Moment Revisited\"National Interest, 70: (Winter 2002/3), p 5-20. stated that the \"moment\" is lasting and lasting with \"acceleration\".National Interest, 70: (Winter 2002/3), p 6. He replied to those who still refused to acknowledge the fact of unipolarity: \"If today's American primacy does not constitute unipolarity, then nothing ever will\". In 1990, Krauthammer had estimated that the \"moment\" will last forty years at best, but he adjusted the estimation in 2002: \"Today, it seems rather modest. The unipolar moment has become the unipolar era\".National Interest, 70: (Winter 2002/3), p 17.
