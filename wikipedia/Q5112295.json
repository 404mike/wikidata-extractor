He was also impressed by the freedom of speech available in the country, especially at Speakers' Corner in London's Hyde Park. The family moved into the curate's flat behind the Church of St Alban the Martyr in Golders Green, where Tutu assisted Sunday services, the first time that he had ministered to a white congregation. It was in the flat that a daughter, Mpho Andrea Tutu, was born in 1963. Tutu was academically successful and his tutors suggested that he convert to an honours degree, which entailed his also studying Hebrew. He received his degree from Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother in a ceremony held at the Royal Albert Hall."]}, {"page": "Lightfoot Professor of Divinity", "response": ["* Christopher Evans (1959\u20131962)"]}, {"page": "Sir Edwyn Hoskyns, 13th Baronet", "response": ["Hoskyns was born on 9 August 1884 in Notting Hill, London, the eldest child and only son of Bishop Edwyn Hoskyns and his wife Mary Constance Maude Benson.
