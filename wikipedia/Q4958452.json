The bands associated with the movement were highly varied in their style, ranging from the catchy and ethereal pop of Broadcast, to the more sinister and angular work of Pram and the enigmatically precise instrumental music of Plone. All were however united by their interest in old musical technology that had previously been thought of as modern, and its use to create an ironic sense of \"nostalgia for a time when people were optimistic about the future\". Tim Felton of Broadcast described how they would \"take that from the past, move it forward and present it\", though insisting that \"it's not a true realisation of the past. It's all perception and reality, which are completely different\" The American National Public Radio described Trish Keenan as \"an ambassador between the parallel worlds of what happened and what might have been\", noting that she was \"interested in memory less for nostalgic reasons and more for the world and lives it distorted and rewrote.\"", "Pram were the scene's first major group, forming in 1988, with their early sound being limited to vocals and an accompanying theremin. Their minimalist and abrasive 1992 debut Gash stood out from the grunge and shoegazing that dominated alternative music at the time, instead anticipating later developments like lo-fi and post-rock, and their musical palette broadened rapidly over subsequent releases to encompass jazz and hip-hop elements and unusual instrumentation including glockenspiels, toy pianos and a Hawaiian bubble machine. The best known exponents of the scene were Broadcast, who formed in 1995 and of all the Birmingham retrofuturist bands were the most directly influenced by 1960s psychedelia. Fronted by the ethereal vocals of Trish Keenan, Broadcast combined influences as varied as the library music of Basil Kirchin, the children's music of Carl Orff and the soundtracks of Czechoslovakian surrealist cinema, while continuing to produce identifiable pop songs. Although they largely eschewed mainstream commercial success, they acquired a large and international cult following and were cited as an influence by artists as diverse as Blur, Paul Weller and Danger Mouse."]}, {"page": "Broadcast discography", "response": ["Broadcast were formed in Birmingham in 1995 by vocalist Trish Keenan, bassist James Cargill, keyboardist Roj Stevens and guitarist Tim Felton.
