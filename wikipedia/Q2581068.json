In contemporary publications, this first journey by a steam locomotive was seen as the beginning of a new era. The decision of the Ludwig Railway Company to opt for the English system, including its rail profile and track gauge, flanges, wagons and so on, also had a normative effect because subsequently, the German railways adopted the same standards based on what was clearly a mature system.Wolfgang M\u00fcck: Deutschlands erste Eisenbahn mit Dampfkraft.

Buch & Kunstverlag Oberpfalz, Amberg 2009, , pp.\u00a037\u201338 As the waterline in the Rhine was low, Captain van Hees had to use horses to pull the barge instead of the steamboat, as originally planned. On 7 October, the train of barges reached Cologne; the remaining distance to Nuremberg had to be covered by road because the Main was too shallow to be navigable by barge. The transport on land was disrupted by a strike of the freight forwarders in Offenbach am Main, and a different freight forwarder had to be ordered. On 26 October 1835 the transport reached Nuremberg. The steam engine was assembled in the workshops of the Johann Wilhelm Spaeth engineering works, with the assembly being observed by Stephenson's engineer William Wilson, who had travelled with the locomotive to Nuremberg. They used the help of the technical teacher Bauer and local carpenters.", "On 7 December 1835 the Adler, driven by William Wilson, ran for the first time on the 6.05 kilometres long track of the LudwigsbahnUlrich Scheefold: 150 Jahre Eisenbahnen in Deutschland.

Wilson was able to observe the final assembly of the locomotive after the cart loads of sub assemblies and components  had been delivered overland from the docks at Cologne;  he then drove the train on its inaugural run.   The original plan seems to have been for Wilson to return to England after a year or so, but became something of a local celebrity, and despite attempts by other companies to lure him away he renewed his contract several times and stayed with the company.   He caught a bad chill in 1842 from which he never fully recovered, but nevertheless continued to work as a locomotive driver till forced to retire in 1859 by a further deterioration in his health.  He lived in Nuremberg till he died there in 1862.   Several sources note that in 1836, while Georg Zacharias Platner was serving as the company's principal director, the train driver William Wilson was earning an annual salary of 1,500 guilders while Platner earned only 1,200 guilders.   Wilson's contract, dated 5 August 1836 also provided that his monthly salary of 125 guilders would be supplemented by a further payment of 240 guilders every time he successfully completed the training of an apprentice driver to the required standard.    Wilson's salary was reduced to 1,200 guilders in 1850, but the differential with the salary of the best paid director remained, the director earning 900 guilders, reflecting the general economic downturn that followed 1848."]}]}}
