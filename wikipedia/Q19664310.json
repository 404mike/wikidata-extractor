He was born at Hepworth, Suffolk and died at Abu Simbel, Egypt.\nPayne was educated at Winchester College and Emmanuel College, Cambridge. He played cricket for the Winchester side as a middle-order batsman, and was picked for the Cambridge non-first-class trial matches in both 1847 and 1848. In the 1848 trial, he top-scored for the \"Cambridge Second XI\" in both innings, and this led to him being picked for a first-team match (the second team beat the first eleven convincingly, but some of this was to do with having John Wisden, not a Cambridge student, in their team, as he took 10 wickets). Payne opened the innings and scored three runs, but this proved to be his only first-class outing as he was not required to bat in the second innings.Payne graduated from Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1850. He was ordained as a Church of England priest and was curate of Stanton, Suffolk from 1855 to his death.", "link_mentions": {}}}
