He was born at Hepworth, Suffolk and died at Abu Simbel, Egypt.\nPayne was educated at Winchester College and Emmanuel College, Cambridge. He played cricket for the Winchester side as a middle-order batsman, and was picked for the Cambridge non-first-class trial matches in both 1847 and 1848. In the 1848 trial, he top-scored for the \"Cambridge Second XI\" in both innings, and this led to him being picked for a first-team match (the second team beat the first eleven convincingly, but some of this was to do with having John Wisden, not a Cambridge student, in their team, as he took 10 wickets). Payne opened the innings and scored three runs, but this proved to be his only first-class outing as he was not required to bat in the second innings.Payne graduated from Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1850. He was ordained as a Church of England priest and was curate of Stanton, Suffolk from 1855 to his death.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hepworth, Suffolk", "response": ["*Charles Payne"]}, {"page": "Charles Payne", "response": ["Charles Payne may refer to:", "* Charles Payne (clergyman) (1830\u20131899), Methodist clergyman and president of Ohio Wesleyan University", "* Charles Payne (television personality) (born 1960), American Fox Business Network contributor and co-host of Varney & Co.", "* Charles Payne (cricketer, born 1827) (1827\u20131859), English clergyman and cricketer", "* Charles Payne (cricketer, born 1832) (1832\u20131909), English cricketer", "* Charles Payne (Australian cricketer) (1876\u20131938), Australian cricketer", "* Sir Charles Payne, 1st Baronet (died 1738), of the Payne baronets"]}, {"page": "List of English cricketers (1841\u20131850)", "response": ["|Charles Payne"]}, {"page": "Charles Payne (cricketer, born 1832)", "response": ["Charles Payne (12 May 1832 \u2013 18 February 1909) was an English professional cricketer active from 1857 to 1875 who played in 88 first-class cricket matches, mainly for Sussex County Cricket Club and Kent County Cricket Club.Charles Payne, Obituaries in 1909, Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, 1910.
