A member of the Conservative Party, he served in the Cabinet from 1981 to 1987 as Secretary of State for Employment (1981\u20131983), Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (1983\u20131985), and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Chairman of the Conservative Party (1985\u20131987). He was a Member of Parliament (MP) from 1970 to 1992, representing the constituencies of Epping (1970\u20131974) and Chingford (1974\u20131992).\nIn 1984, Tebbit was injured in the Provisional Irish Republican Army's bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton, where he was staying during the Conservative Party Conference. His wife Margaret was left permanently disabled after the explosion. He left the cabinet after the 1987 general election to care for his wife.Tebbit considered standing for the Conservative leadership following Margaret Thatcher's resignation in 1990, but came to the decision not to stand as he had earlier made a commitment to his wife to retire from front-line politics. He did not stand for re-election as MP for Chingford in 1992, and has since sat in the House of Lords as Baron Tebbit, of Chingford.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jeffrey Archer", "response": ["Archer's political career revived in the 1980s, and he became a popular speaker among the Conservative grassroots. He was appointed deputy chairman of the Conservative Party by Margaret Thatcher in September 1985. Norman Tebbit, party chairman, had misgivings over the appointment, as did other prominent members of the party, including William Whitelaw and Ted Heath. During his tenure as deputy chairman, Archer was responsible for a number of embarrassing moments, including his statement, made during a live radio interview, that many young, unemployed people were simply unwilling to find work. At the time of Archer's comment, unemployment in the UK stood at a record 3.4 million. Archer was later forced to apologise for the remark, saying that his words had been \"taken out of context\". Archer resigned as deputy chairman in October 1986 due to a scandal caused by an article in The News of the World, which led with the story, \"Tory boss Archer pays vice-girl\", and claimed Archer had paid Monica Coghlan, a prostitute, \u00a32,000 through an intermediary at Victoria Station to go abroad."]}, {"page": "Michael Foot", "response": ["In 1975, Foot, along with Jennie Lee and others, courted controversy when they supported Indira Gandhi, the Prime Minister of India, after she prompted the declaration of a state of emergency.

In his book The Abolition of Britain, Hitchens accuses him of being a \"cultural revolutionary\" who takes a large part of the responsibility for the decline of \"traditional values\" in Britain. During the 1980s Margaret Thatcher and Norman Tebbit would blame Jenkins for family breakdowns, the decline of respect for authority and the decline of social responsibility.

It had been intended to unveil the emblem at the party conference, but a leak to the press resulted in it being launched a week earlier.

He wrote to one of Thatcher's supporters, Norman Tebbit, on 16 November, telling him Thatcher was entitled to use his name and his support in any way she saw fit.

He also supported the government's planned market-led reforms to the NHS and water privatisation in 1989. He also spoke out frequently on defence matters, supported the government's ban on Spycatcher, the new Official Secrets Act 1989 and called for an independent Bank of England, although perhaps as a stepping stone to the setting up of a European Central Bank.Crick 1997, p. 315."]}, {"page": "Radio Active (radio series)", "response": ["* brusque station owner Sir Norman Tonsil (Deayton), the name perhaps alluding to Norman Tebbit"]}, {"page": "Thatcherism", "response": ["Norman Tebbit, a close ally of Thatcher, laid out in a 1985 lecture what he thought to be the permissive society that conservatives should oppose:"]}, {"page": "1992 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["The Conservative Party received what remains the largest number of votes at a United Kingdom general election in British history, breaking the previous record set by the Labour Party in 1951.
