Prior to entering politics he was a chemist.\n\nMoloney was actively involved in the Republican movement in Tipperary. He was arrested and jailed in the mass arrests after the 1916 Easter Rising.  The meeting to elect brigade officers for the 3rd Tipperary Brigade was held in his house in Church street, Tipperary. The house was burnt down during the war by British forces. His three sons were active members of the brigade. One of his sons, Con became Adjutant General of the anti-Treaty IRA during the Civil War another of his sons, Patrick, was killed during the War of Independence.\n\nHe was elected as a Sinn F\u00e9in MP for the Tipperary South constituency at the 1918 general election. In January 1919, Sinn F\u00e9in MPs refused to recognise the Parliament of the United Kingdom and instead assembled at the Mansion House in Dublin as a revolutionary parliament called D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann. He was elected unopposed as a Sinn F\u00e9in Teachta D\u00e1la (TD) for the Tipperary Mid, North and South constituency at the 1921 elections.\nHe opposed the Anglo-Irish Treaty and voted against it. He was re-elected for the same constituency at the 1922 general election, this time as an anti-Treaty Sinn F\u00e9in TD, but he did not take his seat in the D\u00e1il. He did not contest the 1923 general election.A great-grandson is the Irish historian Eunan O'Halpin.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1947 in Ireland", "response": ["* 4 September \u2013 P. J.
