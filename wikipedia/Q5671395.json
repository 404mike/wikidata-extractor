A left winger, he scored over 150 goals in nearly 500 league games in a 14-year career in the English Football League.He played for Mansfield Town for three years, before signing for Stoke City in January 1950. He made 349 appearances and scored 106 goals for the \"Potters\", before he was traded to Port Vale in September 1959.

Low then traded John Cunliffe and \u00a32,000 to Stoke City in exchange for winger Harry Oscroft and centre-half Peter Ford. In March, an out-of-form Graham Barnett was sold to Tranmere Rovers for \u00a35,000, leaving Vale without 'a top-class inside-forward'.

His \u00a310,000 offer for Aston Villa's Gerry Hitchens was rejected, whilst interest in re-signing Ronnie Allen also went nowhere. Low instead got 'bustling' Ted Calland on a free transfer from Exeter City, and sold Fred Donaldson to Exeter for \u00a32,000. In November he signed Bert Llewellyn from Crewe Alexandra for \u00a37,000. His team put in some memorable performances, including a 5\u20130 win over Grimsby Town at Blundell Park, in what Roy Sproson later described as his 'greatest memory' and 'one of their finest hours'; the performance was so impressive they received 'a standing ovation' from the home crowd, as the \"Valiants\" finished the game 'rolling the ball about like a game of chess'. Vale were in the promotion hunt until late in the season, as Low released Albert Leake and sold Stan Steele to West Bromwich Albion for \u00a310,000. Vale recorded a seventh-place finish, and Low ended the campaign by releasing Harry Oscroft (Brantham Athletic), Ted Calland (Lincoln City), John Poole (Macclesfield Town), and Peter Hall (Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic)."]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 in English football", "response": ["*31 December 2008 \u2013 Harry Oscroft, 82, former winger who played for Mansfield Town, Port Vale, and most notably Stoke City, where he scored 106 goals in 349 games during a ten-year spell at the club.Harry Oscroft has died Oatcake Fanzine.
