In 1977, Kay accepted an offer to join Sotheby's Collectors\u2019 Department. Later that year Kay became head of that department and, aged 21, became the company's youngest ever auctioneer. A rock and roll fan, in 1981 Kay held the world's first rock and roll memorabilia auction, handled the sale of Elton John's collection in 1988 and in 1992 wrote Rock \u2019n\u2019 Roll Collectables: An Illustrated History of Rock Memorabilia, the first textbook on the subject.\nAs well as working on television as an expert on Antiques Roadshow from 1979 onwards, Kay presented a landmark series for BBC One, Brilliantly British, which explored the lives of Thomas Chippendale, Josiah Wedgwood and William Morris.  Kay has written or contributed to a number of books on the subject of antiques and collectables and has appeared in numerous television and radio programmes.\nKay is a fan of mechanical antiques, having been born into a family of engineers. She is also a car enthusiast; one of her early influences was the James Bond film Goldfinger, where she loved the Aston Martin DB5. In 2009, for a special episode of BBC TV's Priceless Antiques Roadshow, Kay was behind the wheel of the Aston Martin DB5 driven by Daniel Craig in Casino Royale.\nKay, by then a Senior Director, left Sotheby's in 1999. She now runs Art & Antique Events, a corporate entertainment company which provides antiques-based events and entertainments to corporate and private clients. She created and produces a stage show with fellow Antiques Roadshow expert Paul Atterbury called 'Have You Had it Long Madam?' (Tales from the Roadshow), which has toured the UK, Australia, Canada and New Zealand.\nOn 27 December 2010 Kay won an edition of BBC One's Celebrity Mastermind, with a score of 36 points, having chosen 'The Life and Works of Josiah Wedgwood' as her specialist subject.Currently Kay presents and curates the online art appreciation course, The Art Institute, operating in the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Canada and Ireland.\nKay has joint British and Australian citizenship.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "British sitcom", "response": ["The series which centres on the character of Geraldine Granger, the new vicar of the village of Dibley,  almost immediately exploited the 1992 changes in the Church of England that permitted the ordination of women.
