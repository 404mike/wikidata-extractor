Arsenal manager Herbert Chapman held a press conference on 21 April where he announced that Horace Cope was injured and would be unable to play at left back. He doubted whether Syd Hoar or Alf Baker would be available as both were still recovering from injury, and so he was leaving the selections for both the right half and outside left positions open should they become fit before the game. He saw Bill Seddon and Sam Haden as the alternatives should his first choice players not recover. When asked about who would win the game, he promised the press an answer after the match. Both Baker and Hoar were eventually named in the Arsenal team. The side trained at the Arsenal Stadium on their own pitch before the final. The players met at Hendon Hall Hotel on the morning of the match but their travel plans were disrupted when they became stuck in heavy traffic. Manager Herbert Chapman was forced to leave the coach to telephone local police for an escort; two motorcycle officers arrived to escort the team to the ground."]}, {"page": "1930 FA Cup Final", "response": ["Arsenal's Bill Seddon, who died in January 1993 at the age of 91, was the last surviving player to appear in the game.", "|CB ||5 || Bill Seddon"]}, {"page": "William Seddon", "response": ["#REDIRECTBill Seddon"]}, {"page": "Seddon (surname)", "response": ["*Bill Seddon (1901\u20131993), English footballer"]}]}}
