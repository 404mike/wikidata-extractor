Carnell dropped the non-fiction features and instead published a series of guest editorials, starting with Gillings in the third issue and H.J. Campbell in the fourth issue. The acquisition of Nova Publications by Maclaren gave Carnell access to the publishing facilities of a well-established company, and to established distribution channels, which freed him to focus on his editorial duties. Carnell tended to put longer stories in Science Fantasy than in New Worlds, and Science Fantasy typically ran a long lead novelette with several short stories.Brian Stableford, \"Science Fantasy\", in Clute & Nicholls, Encyclopedia of Science Fiction, p.\u00a01061. Stories that would not have suited New Worlds began to appear, such as William F. Temple's \"Eternity\" (February 1955), in which aliens mysteriously provide haloes to thousands of people, and Dal Stiven's \"Free Will\", which featured robot ghosts. Stories in the whimsical fantasy tradition that had been started by Unknown did not often appear in Science Fantasy."]}, {"page": "New Worlds (magazine)", "response": ["Arthur C.

In 1939 Hanson gave up the editorship to Carnell, who retitled the fanzine New Worlds and restarted the numbering at volume 1 number 1; the first issue under Carnell's control was dated March 1939.  Carnell wanted to turn New Worlds into a professional magazine, and through W.J. Passingham, a writer, had begun discussions with a publisher named The Worlds Says Ltd.  In January 1940 Carnell was asked to put together three issues, and Carnell and Passingham each put up \u00a350 towards costs.  Carnell solicited material from British authors including John F. Burke, C.S. Youd, and David McIlwain, and acquired Robert A. Heinlein's \"Lost Legion\", but in March internal strife led to the collapse of The World Says.  Alfred Greig, the director, returned to his native Canada without repaying Carnell and Passingham, and no issues were ever printed."]}, {"page": "Category talk:Science fiction writers/to do", "response": ["William F.

In the novel, the duplicate (named Dorothy and nicknamed Dot) falls into depression for being married to Bill while she's in love with Robin. She has a breakdown and has to go on holiday with Bill to recover. When they return, Bill starts working on a power generator which explodes, killing him. Lena tries to convince Robin to accept both her and Dot, but he refuses. A couple of weeks later, Lena and Dot have an accident while diving in a river. One of them dies and the other is seriously injured. Dr. Harvey and Robin are startled when they discover that the surviving woman can't recall anything after the duplication, and suppose she's repressing all the painful memories, so she must be Dot. Dr. Harvey finds in Bill's notes about the marks on Dot's neck and tells Robin, convincing him that the survivor is Lena.In an epilogue, he reveals that he also discovered a note in which Bill recalls that, during her holiday, Dot had undergone plastic surgery to erase the marks, but destroyed it so Robin and Dot can be happy."]}, {"page": "Cliff Temple", "response": ["Temple was born in Ealing, London,England & Wales, Civil Registration Birth Index, 1916-2007  the son of science fiction author William F.

Eshbach's \"Out of the Past\", and S.P. Meek's \"The Mentality Machine\".  With the advent of World War\u00a0II, paper shortages and Gillings' call up into the army made it increasingly difficult to continue, and the sixteenth issue, dated Spring 1942, was the last.

Gillings decided that many British science fiction readers would not be familiar with most of the developments in American sf, and so he did not make a point of seeking innovative and original material.  The first issue contained \"The Perfect Creature\", an early story by John Wyndham, under the name \"John Beynon\", as well as \"The Prr-r-eet\", by Eric Frank Russell.  The second issue included Wyndham's novel Sleepers of Mars, and William F. Temple's \"Lunar Lilliput\", which was Temple's first science fiction sale.  \"Stenographer's Hands\", a story by David H.

William F. Temple was involved as an editorial consultant and also assisted with editing the manuscripts.Philip Harbottle, \"Introduction\", in Bounds, Best of Sydney J. Bounds, Vol. 1, p.\u00a012. Hamilton provided all the financing, but he had to wait for the money to come in from each issue before he could afford to produce the next. In addition, Crownpoint only intermittently had enough spare capacity to print Nebula, so the first few issues appeared on an erratic schedule.  After a dozen issues, the conflicts led to Hamilton moving Nebula to a printing firm based in Dublin, and breaking the connection with Crownpoint.  He was then able to publish on a slightly more regular schedule, although the planned bi-monthly issues were still sometimes delayed. Hamilton paid 21 shillings (\u00a31.05) per thousand words, the equivalent of three-tenths of a cent per word; this was a low rate compared to the American market, but was marginally better than the contemporary British magazine Authentic Science Fiction, which paid \u00a31 per thousand words.Ashley, History of the Science Fiction Magazine Vol. 3, pp.\u00a068\u201371 Hamilton offered a bonus of \u00a32 or \u00a35 to the story that turned out to be the readers' favourite in each issue, which helped attract writers; and he later increased the rates, paying as much as 2d (0.8p, or 2.3 cents) per word for well-known authors.  This was higher than the best UK markets, such as New Worlds, and was close to the rates paid by the top magazines in the US at that time. Both the high rates of pay and Hamilton's willingness to work with new authors were designed to encourage writers to submit their work to Nebula before trying the other magazines.Philip Harbottle, \"Remembering Phil High\", in Fantasy Adventures 13, p.\u00a0122.", "Many of the better-known British writers began to appear in Nebula, including William F. Temple and Eric Frank Russell; new authors also began to be published.  Hamilton was glad to work with beginning writers, and in 1953 several writers who later became very well known, including Brian Aldiss, Barrington Bayley, and Bob Shaw, each sold their first story to Nebula.  Not all these stories reached print that year: Aldiss's \"T\" appeared in the November 1956 issue, by which time other stories of Aldiss's were in print, and the first story by Bayley is not certainly identified \u2013 it may have been \"Consolidation\", which appeared in November 1959, but it is also possible that it was never printed.  Robert Silverberg had begun submitting stories to Hamilton as soon as he heard of Nebula, realising that Hamilton was unlikely to be getting many submissions from US writers, and found Hamilton very helpful. Silverberg's first story, \"Gorgon Planet\", was accepted by Hamilton on 11 January 1954.Silverberg, Phases of the Moon, pp.\u00a012\u201313.  Brian Aldiss echoes Silverberg's assessment of Hamilton, commenting that Hamilton was \"a sympathetic editor to a beginner.  He was also a patient editor.\""]}, {"page": "World's Best Science Fiction: 1965", "response": ["*\"A Niche in Time\" (William F.
