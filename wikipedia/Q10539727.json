Tony Cook began as a winger in local football only taking a turn in goal when the regular goalkeeper was unable to play. Cook had a trial for Bristol City and saved a penalty in a 0\u20131 defeat at Southampton on 26 December 1949. Bob Wright signed Cook on his return to Ashton Gate in December 1949 for Bristol City. Frank Coombes was replaced as Bristol City goalkeeper in January 1950 by Syd Morgan who himself had been discovered playing in the Downs League in Bristol. In 1950\u201351, Morgan contested the goalkeeping position with Con Sullivan who had joined from local Bristol side Horfield Old Boys six months before Cook. Sullivan was ever present in 1951\u201352. Cook finally got his chance after both Sullivan and Morgan had been tried in 1952\u201353. Cook made his debut in goal in the Third Division South in a 4\u20132 win v Swindon Town on 8 November 1952 and completed 29 consecutive appearances to the end of 1952\u201353 when Bristol City finished in fifth place.

Cook gained a reputation as a saver of penalties and saved six of the nine penalties he faced in 1958\u201359. Cook was ever present in the relegation season 1959\u201360 when Bristol City finished 22nd and bottom of the Second Division. Cook made 45 appearances in 1960\u201361 and in all six FA Cup ties as Bristol City lost 1\u20135 in the fourth round at Leicester City.
