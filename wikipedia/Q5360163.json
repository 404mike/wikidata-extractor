A win for Cardiff would guarantee the club its first title regardless of Huddersfield's result while a draw would leave Huddersfield needing to win by three goals to win the title on goal average. Cardiff's match remained goalless for 70 minutes when the side were awarded a penalty after a goal-bound header from Gill was blocked on the line by the hand of Birmingham defender Eli Ashurst. Regular penalty taker Jack Evans had suffered misses in previous months and Gill was reluctant to take responsibility. Top scorer Len Davies instead stepped up to take the penalty, the first senior attempt in his career, but he sent a tame effort at the opposition goalkeeper who saved comfortably. Despite the miss, Cardiff were still on course to win the league title as Huddersfield led Forest by a single goal. However, in the final 20 minutes, Huddersfield scored a further two goals to win the match 3\u20130 and overtake Cardiff to win the title on goal average by 0.024 of a goal. The result remains the narrowest margin of victory ever recorded in the top tier of English football. It was also the first time the championship had ever been decided by the method of goal average."]}, {"page": "Ashurst (surname)", "response": ["*Eli Ashurst (1901\u20131927), English footballer"]}]}}
