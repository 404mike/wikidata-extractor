Four days later, Sheffield Wednesday faced Brentford who ended The Owls' continuous run of winning games at home since the season started in a 0\u20130 draw. Morecambe was the next game for Wednesday which was a late kick-off on the Sunday. Former-Bristol Rovers midfielder Chris Lines got the opening with a low shot from outside the area, and in the second-half Chris O'Grady scored his first goal for the club to double the advantage. Laurence Wilson did scored for Morecambe from the penalty-spot on the sixty-second minute, but the home side could not take the game to a reply, finishing 1\u20132. In Round 2, The Owls were drawn at home to another Football League Two side, this time Aldershot Town. Back to the league and Wednesday were away to Tranmere Rovers. Everton loanee Jose Baxter gave Tranmere Rovers the lead before Chris Lines scored his second goal for Wednesday in two consecutive weeks on the brink of half-time. The Owls did manage to come out with a win though, as Ryan Lowe struck with ten-minutes to go. With the emergency-loan market to end soon, Megson brought in three new players in the last week of November. Firstly, right back James Tavernier was brought in for just over a month from Newcastle United as regular Lewis Buxton had picked up a hamstring injury. Also, with central defensive problems and injuries, Miguel Llera was brought in on loan from Football League Championship club Blackpool. The final addition to the squad came from Premier League club Arsenal as the highly anticipated youngster Sanchez Watt came in for a one-month loan, after top scorer Gary Madine was ruled out for three weeks with an injury. At Hillsborough Stadium on 26 November Sheffield Wednesday edged out a close encounter with Leyton Orient, but thanks to another goal from Benin international Reda Johnson on the nineteenth minute, The Owls won 1\u20130."]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Morecambe F.C. season", "response": ["|3 ||DF || ||19 ||Laurence Wilson || 5 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 6", "|19 || ||DF ||Laurence Wilson || 4 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 4 || 0"]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Accrington Stanley F.C. season", "response": ["|19||Laurence Wilson||||Huyton||||LB/DM||21||0||3 January 2013||Rotherham United||Free||30 June 2014"]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 Morecambe F.C. season", "response": ["| 16 July 2014 ||  Laurence Wilson ||  Accrington Stanley || Free || "]}, {"page": "2006\u201307 Chester City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|17||align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Laurence Wilson"]}, {"page": "2016\u201317 Morecambe F.C. season", "response": ["| 9 August 2016 || LB ||  || Laurence Wilson || Bangor City || Free transfer || "]}, {"page": "2005\u201306 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|27||align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Laurence Wilson"]}, {"page": "Lawrence Wilson (disambiguation)", "response": ["Lawrence Wilson or Laurence Wilson may also refer to:", "* Laurence Wilson (born 1986), English footballer"]}]}}
