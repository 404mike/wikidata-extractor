Despite her many successes, her career was overshadowed by that of her more famous sister Irene Vanbrugh.\nVanbrugh studied acting and made her professional debut in an 1886 burlesque. The same year, she made her West End theatre debut and then travelled to Margate to play leading roles in four of Shakespeare's plays.  In 1889 she joined the Kendals at the Royal Court Theatre and on tour in the US Two years later, back in London, she joined Henry Irving and Ellen Terry in their famous Shakespeare company at the Lyceum Theatre. In 1893, she appeared opposite her husband Arthur Bourchier at Daly's Theatre and soon became his leading lady at the Royalty Theatre and then at the Garrick Theatre, where Bourchier was lessee for the first six years of the 20th century.\nVanbrugh returned to Shakespearean roles in 1906 at Stratford upon Avon, where she played Lady Macbeth to her husband's Macbeth, and they soon starred together in Herbert Beerbohm Tree's London production of Henry VIII.  They continued to play in Shakespeare and other pieces, and two films, through World War I, but their marriage ended in 1918.  She continued acting steadily on stage and had some success in film in the 1930s, especially in Pygmalion in 1938.  In her 50th season on stage, she starred in The Merry Wives of Windsor with her sister in London, and during The Blitz, they entertained at matinees.  Her last film appearance was in 1940 in Young Man's Fancy. She died in London in 1942 at the age of 75.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Herbert Beerbohm Tree", "response": ["Over the next two decades, Tree staged approximately sixty plays there, programming a repertory at least as varied as he had at the Haymarket.

Tree mounted new plays by prominent British playwrights, such as Carnac Sahib (1899) by Henry Arthur Jones.  His productions were exceptionally profitable; they were famous, most of all, for their elaborate and often spectacular scenery and effects.  Unlike some other famous actor-managers, Tree engaged the best actors available to join his company and hired the best designers and composers for the plays with incidental music.  His productions starred such noted actors as Constance Collier, Ellen Terry, Madge Kendal, Winifred Emery, Julia Neilson, Violet Vanbrugh, Oscar Asche, Arthur Bourchier, and Lewis Waller."]}, {"page": "Thomas Stevens (cyclist)", "response": ["Stevens returned to England around 1895 and married Frances Barnes (n\u00e9e Nation), widowed mother of the actresses Irene and Violet Vanbrugh.

In its early days, it received generally strong reviews, but by 1910, the political climate had changed somewhat; the 1909 Stratford by-election had seen suffragette protests, and henceforth some critics expressed discomfort with Benson's use of farce to depict what had now become a socially relevant situation.
