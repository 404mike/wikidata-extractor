Originally her Children's Hour programme was broadcast only from Glasgow but from 1928 onwards it was broadcast throughout Scotland. In 1940, she was appointed as Children's Hour organizer for Scotland and she held that post until her retirement. Among the well-known entertainers who received their first opportunities from Garscadden were Gordon Jackson, Fulton Mackay, John Grieve, Molly Weir, Tom Conti, Moira Anderson, Sydney Devine, Stanley Baxter, Jimmy Logan, Rikki Fulton, and Janet Brown.
