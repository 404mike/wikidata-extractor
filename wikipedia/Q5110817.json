The Islamic studies scholar Akbar S. Ahmed, who went to school with Bhutto, wrote that she was a \"pampered and precocious\" child. Bhatia claimed that at Oxford, where he first met her, Bhutto was spoilt, self-obsessed, and prone to throwing temper tantrums, although at the same time was humorous and generous, willing to pay for her friends' meals whenever at a restaurant. Allen suggested that Bhutto retained her \"characteristic de haut en bas arrogance, a relic of her feudal upbringing\", arguing that her key character flaw had been \"a belief in the special, almost sacred destiny of herself and the Bhutto family\" and that accordingly, while she \"spoke like a democrat\u00a0... she thought and felt as a dynast\". In later life, Bhutto was accused of being addicted to power, although Allen thought it more accurate to state that she was \"addicted to adulation\", suggesting that this stemmed from a narcissistic element to Bhutto's personality."]}, {"page": "Baillie Gifford Prize", "response": ["* Christina Lamb, Our Bodies, Their Battlefield: What War Does to Women (Harper Collins, William Collins)"]}, {"page": "Institute for War and Peace Reporting", "response": ["IWPR is an international network of three partner not-for-profit organisations governed by a board of trustees composed of senior journalists, peace-building and human rights experts, regional specialists, and business and NGO professionals.
