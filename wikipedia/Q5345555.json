His parents were Quakers and he was a pupil at the Quaker-founded Leighton Park School in Reading. His younger brother, Edward Tangye Lean (1911\u20131974), founded the original Inklings literary club when a student at Oxford University. Lean was a half-hearted schoolboy with a dreamy nature who was labeled a \"dud\" of a student; he left school in the Christmas Term of 1926, at the age of 18 and entered his father's chartered accountancy firm as an apprentice. A more formative event for his career than his formal education was an uncle's gift, when Lean was aged ten, of a Brownie box camera. \"You usually didn't give a boy a camera until he was 16 or 17 in those days. It was a huge compliment and I succeeded at it.' Lean printed and developed his films, and it was his 'great hobby'.the Guardian, 17 April 1991 In 1923, his father deserted the family and Lean would later follow a similar path after his own first marriage and child."]}, {"page": "William Cobbett", "response": ["Cobbett is considered to have begun as an inherently conservative journalist, who angered by the corrupt British political establishment, became increasingly radical and sympathetic to anti-government and democratic ideals. He provided a panegyric extolling rural England in the age of an Industrial Revolution, with which he was not in sympathy. Cobbett wished England would return to the rural England of the 1760s, in which he had been born. Unlike fellow radical Thomas Paine, Cobbett was not an internationalist cosmopolitan and did not endorse a republican Britain. He boasted that he was not a \"citizen of world.... It is quite enough for me to think about what is best for England, Scotland and Ireland.\" Possessing a national identity, he often criticised rival countries and warned them that they should not \"swagger about and be saucy to England.\" He said his identification with the Church of England was due in part because it \"bears the name of my country.\" Among historian biographers, Ian Dyck claimed that Cobbett endorsed \"the eighteenth-century Country Party platform\";Ian Dyck, 'Introduction' in William Cobbett, Rural Rides (Penguin Classics, 2005), p. xxiii.
