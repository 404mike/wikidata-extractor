He was a member of The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews and finished in second place in the 1904 Amateur Championship contested at Royal St George's Golf Club in Sandwich, England. Although playing fine golf throughout, he eventually lost the final match to Walter Travis by the score of 4 and 3. He was known as a long hitter of the ball, often outdriving opponents by 50 yards or more. In 1898, Blackwell was described as probably the most consistently long driver the world had ever seen. As a result, his name became a household word among golfers.His brothers\u2014Sir Ernley Blackwell and Walter Blackwell\u2014were also useful golfers, playing on several occasions in the Amateur Championship.", "link_mentions": {}}}
