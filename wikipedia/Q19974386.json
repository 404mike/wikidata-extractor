He was a member of The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews and finished in second place in the 1904 Amateur Championship contested at Royal St George's Golf Club in Sandwich, England. Although playing fine golf throughout, he eventually lost the final match to Walter Travis by the score of 4 and 3. He was known as a long hitter of the ball, often outdriving opponents by 50 yards or more. In 1898, Blackwell was described as probably the most consistently long driver the world had ever seen. As a result, his name became a household word among golfers.His brothers\u2014Sir Ernley Blackwell and Walter Blackwell\u2014were also useful golfers, playing on several occasions in the Amateur Championship.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Amateur Championship", "response": ["|1904||Royal St. George's Golf Club||Walter Travis||||align=\"center\"|4 & 3|| Edward Blackwell"]}, {"page": "Ernley Blackwell", "response": ["Following his retirement, Blackwell's continued interest in legal matters was shown by his 1934 appointment as chairman of the statutory committee of Britain's Pharmaceutical Society, to which he had been elected an honorary member in 1928.

Moran then scored a final round 72 to Edmundson's 78 to win by six strokes. Later in June Moran travelled to Royal St George's for the Open Championship. The Championship was preceded by a \"Coronation Match\" between teams of amateurs and professionals, in celebration of the coronation of George V. Moran was selected for the professionals, joined by the amateur Lionel Munn as the Irish representatives. The match consisted of 9 foursomes matches, each over 36 holes. The result was an 8\u20131 win for the professionals. Moran and his partner Rowland Jones were the only professionals who lost, at the 38th hole. The 1911 Open was the last without any qualifying, and, with 222 players, the first two rounds were spread over three days. There was considerable disquiet about the format, since some of the holes were moved every day. Moran scored 72 to lead after the first day, although Edward Blackwell scored 71 on the second day, playing to different holes. After his good first round, Moran disappointed and finished tied for 21st place. Moran failed to qualify for the final stages of either of the main PGA events. A poor first round of 81 meant he missed out on the two Irish places in the Sphere and Tatler Foursomes Tournament. In the qualifying for the News of the World Match Play, Moran was involved in a three-man playoff for the one place, but missed out, as he had in 1910."]}]}}
