He is best known for his early use of the realistic narrative form and his descriptions of middle and working-class life and people.\nIn the 1770s, Crabbe began his career as a doctor's apprentice, later becoming a surgeon. In 1780, he travelled to London to make a living as a poet. After encountering serious financial difficulty and being unable to have his work published, he wrote to the statesman and author Edmund Burke for assistance. Burke was impressed enough by Crabbe's poems to promise to help him in any way he could. The two became close friends and Burke helped Crabbe greatly both in his literary career and in building a role within the church.\nBurke introduced Crabbe to the literary and artistic society of London, including Sir Joshua Reynolds and Samuel Johnson, who read The Village before its publication and made some minor changes. Burke secured Crabbe the important position of Chaplain to the Duke of Rutland. Crabbe served as a clergyman in various capacities for the rest of his life, with Burke's continued help in securing these positions. He developed friendships with many of the great literary men of his day, including Sir Walter Scott, whom he visited in Edinburgh, and William Wordsworth and some of his fellow Lake Poets, who frequently visited Crabbe as his guests.\nLord Byron described him as \"nature's sternest painter, yet the best.\" Crabbe's poetry was predominantly in the form of heroic couplets, and has been described as unsentimental in its depiction of provincial life and society. The modern critic Frank Whitehead wrote that \"Crabbe, in his verse tales in particular, is an important\u2014indeed, a major\u2014poet whose work has been and still is seriously undervalued.\" Crabbe's works include The Village (1783), Poems (1807), The Borough (1810), and his poetry collections Tales (1812) and Tales of the Hall (1819).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "December 24", "response": ["*1754 \u2013 George Crabbe, English priest, surgeon, and poet (died 1832)"]}, {"page": "List of English-language poets", "response": ["*George Crabbe (1754\u20131832, E)"]}, {"page": "February 3", "response": ["*1832 \u2013 George Crabbe, English surgeon and poet (b. 1754)"]}, {"page": "Suffolk", "response": ["In the arts, Suffolk is noted for having been the home to two of England's best regarded painters, Thomas Gainsborough and John Constable \u2013 the Stour Valley area is branded as \"Constable Country\" \u2013 and one of its most noted composers, Benjamin Britten.

However, several of Wordsworth's contemporaries, such as George Crabbe, Lord Byron, and Walter Scott (who edited Dryden's works), were still keen admirers of Dryden. Besides, Wordsworth did admire many of Dryden's poems, and his famous \"Intimations of Immortality\" ode owes something stylistically to Dryden's \"Alexander's Feast.\" John Keats admired the \"Fables,\" and imitated them in his poem Lamia. Later 19th-century writers had little use for verse satire, Pope, or Dryden; Matthew Arnold famously dismissed them as \"classics of our prose.\" He did have a committed admirer in George Saintsbury, and was a prominent figure in quotation books such as Bartlett's, but the next major poet to take an interest in Dryden was T.

One notable example of an 18th-century work is Alexander Pope's Pastorals (1709). In this work Pope imitates Edmund Spenser's Shepheardes Calendar, while utilizing classical names and allusions aligning him with Virgil. In 1717, Pope's Discourse on Pastoral Poetry was published as a preface to Pastorals. In this work Pope sets standards for pastoral literature and critiques many popular poets, one of whom is Spenser, along with his contemporary opponent Ambrose Philips.  During this time period Ambrose Philips, who is often overlooked because of Pope, modeled his poetry after the native English form of Pastoral, employing it as a medium to express the true nature and longing of Man.  He strove to write in this fashion to conform to what he thought was the original intent of Pastoral literature.  As such, he centered his themes around the simplistic life of the Shepherd, and, personified the relationship that humans once had with nature.

Though the earliest examples come mostly from continental Europe, the topographical poetry in the tradition originating with Denham concerns itself with the classics, and many of the various types of topographical verse, such as river, ruin, or hilltop poems were established by the early 17th century.Aubin, Robert Arnold.

In the poem, Goldsmith criticises rural depopulation, the moral corruption found in towns, consumerism, enclosure, landscape gardening, avarice, and the pursuit of wealth from international trade. The poem employs, in the words of one critic, \"deliberately precise obscurity\", and does not reveal the reason why the village has been deserted. The poem was very popular in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, but also provoked critical responses, including from other poets such as George Crabbe. References to the poem, and particularly its ominous \"Ill fares the land\" warning, have appeared in a number of other contexts.  ", "Early critics also questioned the validity of Goldsmith's argument about rural depopulation and decline. In 1770, for instance, Thomas Comber argued that the population of rural England was not decreasing, and that enclosure could increase farmers' demand for labourers.Mitchell 2006, pp. 123\u20134. An early review in The Critical Review also defended the value of England's increase in wealth, and questioned whether rural depopulation had become an important problem.Jaarsma 1971, p. 447. Modern economic historians have supported Comber's comments about depopulation.Mitchell 2006, p. 124. George Crabbe's poem The Village (1783) was written as a riposte to what its author saw as the excessive sentimentality of Goldsmith's verse. In his poem, Crabbe describes the hardships of the rural poor, in a way that Goldsmith did not.Lutz 1998, pp. 184\u20135. Furthermore, Crabbe's poem encourages the interpretation of Goldsmith's bucolic depiction of old \"sweet Auburn\" in The Deserted Village as being a representation of the status quo in 1770, rather than a depiction of an idealised past through which current moral decline can be highlighted. The Deserted Village is, in this interpretation, \"depoliticised\"\u2014an act that was reinforced by nineteenth-century interpretations produced by Thomas Babington Macaulay and two of Goldsmith's biographers.Lutz 1998, p. 188."]}, {"page": "List of translators", "response": ["*Alexander Druzhinin \u2013 translator of several of Shakespeare's plays and the poetry of George Crabbe"]}, {"page": "Edward Ardizzone", "response": ["*The Library, (1930), by George Crabbe"]}, {"page": "Crabbe", "response": ["*George Crabbe, British poet and naturalist"]}, {"page": "The New Oxford Book of English Verse 1250\u20131950", "response": ["William Allingham - Matthew Arnold - W.

MacCarthy notes that he did not actually translate the keen himself but pass off the labor of native Irish informants such as Mrs. Harrington as his own, and when left to his own devices, Croker \"merely revealed ignorance\" of the Irish language."]}, {"page": "Ebenezer Elliott", "response": ["In 1798, aged 17, he wrote his first poem, \"Vernal Walk\", in imitation of James Thompson. He was also influenced by George Crabbe, Lord Byron and the Romantic poets and Robert Southey, who later became Poet Laureate. In 1808 Elliott wrote to Southey asking for advice on getting published. Southey's welcome reply began a correspondence over the years that reinforced his determination to make a name for himself as a poet. They only met once, but exchanged letters until 1824, and Elliott declared it was Southey who had taught him the art of poetry."]}]}}
