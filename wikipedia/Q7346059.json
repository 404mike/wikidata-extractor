In 1806 he published a collection of 149 traditional ballads and songs, along with two pleasing lyrics of his own, entitled Popular Ballads And Songs From Tradition, Manuscripts And Scarce Editions With Translations Of Similar Pieces From The Ancient Danish Language.\nWalter Scott, through whose assistance he received a government post at Edinburgh, held Jamieson in high esteem and pointed out his skill in discovering the connection between Scandinavian and Scottish legends. Scott also published some of Jamieson's translations, such as The Ghaist's Warning in the notes to The Lady of the Lake. Jamieson's work preserved much oral tradition which might otherwise have been lost.

Allan Ramsay (1686\u20131758) is often described as leading a \"vernacular revival\" and he laid the foundations of a reawakening of interest in older Scottish literature. He was part of a community of poets working in Scots and English that included William Hamilton of Gilbertfield, Robert Crawford, Alexander Ross, William Hamilton of Bangour, Alison Rutherford Cockburn and James Thompson. Also important was Robert Fergusson. Robert Burns is widely regarded as the national poet of Scotland, working in both Scots and English. His \"Auld Lang Syne\" is often sung at Hogmanay, and \"Scots Wha Hae\" served for a long time as an unofficial national anthem. Scottish poetry is often seen as entering a period of decline in the nineteenth century, with Scots-language poetry criticised for its use of parochial dialect. Conservative and anti-radical Burns clubs sprang up around Scotland, filled with poets who fixated on the \"Burns stanza\" as a form. Scottish poetry has been seen as descending into infantalism as exemplified by the highly popular Whistle Binkie anthologies, leading into the sentimental parochialism of the Kailyard school. Poets from the lower social orders who used Scots included the weaver-poet William Thom. Walter Scott, the leading literary figure of the early nineteenth century, largely wrote in English, and Scots was confined to dialogue or interpolated narrative, in a model that would be followed by other novelists such as John Galt and Robert Louis Stevenson. James Hogg provided a Scots counterpart to the work of Scott.G. Carruthers, Scottish Literature (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2009), , p. 58.

Dismissed by Ritson as new-fangled and by Scott as inauthentic, Mrs. Brown\u2019s ballads were considered exemplary by both Robert Jamieson and, later, Francis James Child, who gave her variants pride of place in The English and Scottish Popular Ballads as instances of the best the popular ballad tradition had to offer. In the twentieth century, the differences between her renditions of several specific ballads became the focus of scholarly attention\u2014held up by Bertrand Bronson as examples of oral re-creation and subsequently used by other scholars as ammunition in the conflict over the applicability of oral-formulaic theory to European balladry.Julie Henigan, review of The Ballad Repertoire of Anna Gordon, Mrs Brown of Falkland, ed. by Sigrid Rieuwerts, The Scottish Text Society, Fifth Series, 8 (Woodbridge: Boydell and Brewer, 2011) , in JFR: Journal of Folklore Research, An International Journal of Folklore and Ethnomusicology (2011), http://www.jfr.indiana.edu/review.php?id=1305."]}, {"page": "The Ghaist's Warning", "response": ["The Ghaist's Warning is a Scottish ballad based on Robert Jamieson's translation of the Danish ballad Svend Dyring. It was published by Sir Walter Scott in the notes to The Lady of the Lake in 1810. Scott describes the ballad as being written not in the common language of the time, but in the \"old Scottish idiom\" such as to produce a more literal translation."]}, {"page": "Illustrations of Northern Antiquities", "response": ["Illustrations of Northern Antiquities (1814), or to give its full title Illustrations of Northern Antiquities, from the Earlier Teutonic and Scandinavian Romances; Being an Abstract of the Book of Heroes, and Nibelungen Lay; with Translations of Metrical Tales, from the Old German, Danish, Swedish, and Icelandic Languages; with Notes and Dissertations, was a pioneering work of comparative literature which provided translations and abstracts of various works written in medieval Germany and Scandinavia.  Its three authors were Henry Weber, who pr\u00e9cised the Nibelungenlied and Heldenbuch; Robert Jamieson, who translated Danish and other ballads, stressing their close connection with Scottish ballads; and Walter Scott, who provided an abstract of Eyrbyggja saga.  It significantly extended British readers' access to early Germanic literature.", "The three authors of the Northern Antiquities were all well known to each other.  Henry Weber was a German refugee whom Scott had taken under his wing as a needy and deserving literary scholar; in the year the Northern Antiquities were published his mental health gave way, and he was hospitalized for the rest of his life at Scott's expense.  The ballad-collector Robert Jamieson had helped Scott with his Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border as long ago as 1800, and Scott retained his admiration for Jamieson's work in this field.  Work on the Northern Antiquities began at least as early as 1810, when Walter Scott approached the Rev. Richard Polwhele as a possible contributor.  Scott may have been responsible for more than the \"Abstract of the Eyrbiggia-Saga\" that appeared over his name, or rather initials: his son-in-law and biographer J. G. Lockhart asserted that the verse translations scattered through Weber's abstract of the Nibelungenlied were actually Scott's work, though more recently it has been argued that he only revised Weber's verse.  The opening Advertisement has also been tentatively attributed to him.  As an affluent patron of scholarship he also advanced the publishing of the work in the teeth of scepticism from the trade as to its commercial viability.  Northern Antiquities; or Tracts, Designed to Illustrate the Early History, Poetry, and Romance of the Nations of the North of Europe was announced as being in the press as early as 1811, and as including much material that did not appear in the published volume, such as an abstract of Hervarar saga (rather than Eyrbyggja saga).  It was actually published under its final title only in June 1814 in Edinburgh and August 1814 in London, the two publishing houses involved being John Ballantyne and Co., and Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme and Brown, and the printers being James Ballantyne and Co.  The book appeared in royal quarto format at a price of three guineas, making it a rather expensive item, and it did not sell well.  In consequence a planned second volume was never published, nor did Weber's hopes that the project might lead to \"a periodical publication on the subject of ancient Romance and Antiquities in general, Foreign & British\" come to fruition.  One or the other of these might have included the \"translations from some very old Swiss battlesongs\" Scott mentioned having completed, or some of the projects mentioned in the Advertisement of the Northern Antiquities: \"the Romances of Russia...the more rare and less-known Sagas of Scandinavia...the Original Songs of the Letts and Esthonians...the Poetry of the Celtic Dialects\".", "Robert Jamieson was the first writer to point out the strong resemblances of phraseology and incident which exist between the ballads of Scotland and those of Denmark and Sweden.  This he did originally in his Popular Ballads and Songs (1806), but more fully and accurately in the Northern Antiquities.  In the notes to his translation of the Danish ballad Rosmer Hafmand Jamieson gave a synopsis with quotations of a ballad, Child Rowland, which he claimed to have heard in his infancy recited by a Scottish tailor.  It has been suggested that some form of this ballad was quoted by Shakespeare in King Lear and provided Milton with the plot of Comus, though the Shakespearean scholar George Lyman Kittredge commented that it was \"manifestly of modern composition\".", "Francis Palgrave, writing in the Edinburgh Review, welcomed the appearance of a work throwing so much new light on early Germanic literature.  He described Scott's contribution as \"interesting\" and Weber's abstract of the Nibelungenlied as one of the most curious parts of the book, but reserved most of his praise for the poetical talent and industry of Robert Jamieson, a man who \"well understands the art of combining the useful with the agreeable\", and urged him to \"gratify the curiosity which he has excited\" by publishing something similar on Russian, Latvian or Estonian literature."]}]}}
