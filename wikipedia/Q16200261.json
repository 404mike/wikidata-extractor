He grew up in a religious household, and his upbringing after the premature death of his mother was overseen by his older brother Thomas Thompson (1785-1865), a well-known philanthropist of religious causes. As such, he grew up with Thomas Thompson's daughter Jemima Luke (n\u00e9e Thompson) (1813-1906), who was less than six years behind Theophilus in age, and who became a popular writer of children's hymns, religious studies, and other works. After studying medicine at St. Bartholomew's Hospital in Smithfield, London, Theophilus attended the University of Edinburgh, where in 1830 he received his M.D. degree. He also studied in Paris under the French physicians Gabriel Andral, and Guillaume Dupuytren, and attended lectures given by the zoologist Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire at the Jardin des Plantes."]}, {"page": "List of women hymnwriters", "response": ["*Jemima Luke (b.
