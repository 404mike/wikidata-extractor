She finished second to Evelyn Ashford in a UK record time of 11.10, defeating Marlies Gohr, who was third. This would stand as the UK record for 27 years, until Montell Douglas ran 11.05 in 2008. Also in 1981, Smallwood had her first attempt at the 400 m distance.

Maduaka and Jeanette Kwakye were to be the only British representatives in the 200 m. However, Turner went on to achieve the A standard for the 100 m, meaning that GBR were permitted another athlete in the event.
