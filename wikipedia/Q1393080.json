The sign was made by Radcliffe's husband and read 'EPO Cheats Out'. It was eventually taken off them by the stadium officials, but not before it was streamed around the world. After Radcliffe and Tullett's initial protest, teammates Kathy Butler and Hayley Yelling \u2013 who both missed out on a place in the final \u2013 protested alongside coaches Mark Rowland and Alan Storey, wearing Radcliffe masks and holding up banners with mocking slogans including one which read 'Free Paula'. Radcliffe vowed to continue her fight against drugs in sport after her high-profile actions in Edmonton.

He was marked, a few metres back, by William Van Dijck with the rest of the field strung out behind.  With about three laps to go, Kenyans Julius Kariuki and Peter Koech seemed to jog casually into position next to Van Dijck with Mark Rowland gamely holding on. From behind Alessandro Lambruschini and Patrick Sang rushed to catch up.  With two laps to go, the Kenyan duo broke it open, with Panetta disappearing back into the field.  Rowland was the only one to hang on to the Kenyans, who were looking around for the other challengers.  With the three-man break clear and one lap to go, Kariuki departed from the team tactics and took off, opening up a 10-metre lead around the penultimate turn with Koech chasing.  Kariuki took the water jump carefully; behind him, Koech hurdled the water pit and emphasized his separation on Rowland.  Koech was able to make a little ground on Kariuki, but it was too little too late.  Rowland had 20 metres on Lambruschini for bronze and a new British record.
