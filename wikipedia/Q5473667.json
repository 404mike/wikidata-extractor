Culpin  (Retrieved 2011-01-11) The intention was to provide affordable housing to workers coming to Wrexham to work in the expanding industries of coal and iron. Gresford Colliery had recently been opened where it was expected that approximately 3,000 men would be employed in the next two years. A Co-partnership Housing Society was set up in 1913 called Wrexham Tenants Limited, with Lord Kenyon, Mr. David Davies, M.P., and others as Directors to build the houses, while the Trust would build the roads and supervise the development of the estate. The plan was drawn up on an axial layout by the architect G. L. Cunliffe. In the first year, 44 properties were completed;numbers 63\u201369 Acton Gate, numbers 149\u2013167, Chester Road (originally called Bryn Acton) and Cunliffe Walk.

Atkinson", "response": ["In 1905, The University of Oxford selected its first lecturer in military history, Sir Foster Cunliffe. Three years later, the University appointed an additional tutor to assist in a special subject on military history, focusing on the Napoleonic Wars. Atkinson was the first to hold this post. After Cunliffe's post expired in 1908 an then made redundant with the establishment of the Chichele Professor of Military History in 1909, Atkinson continued as the tutor for the special subject in conjunction with Professor Charles Oman. By 1924, a relatively small number of students had chosen to read the special subject. Oman and Atkinson believed that this was largely due to the fact that the study up to that point had focused too much on tactics rather than strategy and that the campaigns studied had shifted to continental campaigns that did not involve British troops in the 1805-1808 period. They proposed a new syllabus that included Clausewitz On War and Hamley Operations of War, complemented by an outline study of the Peninsular War with a special study within it of the Peninsular campaign of 1812. The University's History faculty Board adopted the proposal and it remained the topic in use for the next 25 years until 1950. In 1951, the special subject in military history shifted to a study of Britain in the Mediterranean, 1797-1802, to include naval history and substituting Julian Corbett Some Principles of Maritime Strategy for Hamley's Operations of War. The study improved on the pervious special subject by including more political material and staying away from narrowly conceived approaches to military history.John B.
