He made his debut after starting a 1\u20130 defeat away to Tranmere Rovers on 15 September in York's seventh league match of 1972\u201373, replacing John Mackin at right back. He finished the season with 34 appearances and five goals for York in all competitions. He spent the season primarily at right back, but played as a striker towards the end of the season, scoring two goals from five matches in this position. In 1973\u201374, Stone missed three matches, making 51 appearances in all competitions as York finished third in the Third Division, thus winning promotion to the Second Division for the first time in the club's history. An injury sustained in York's 1\u20130 defeat away to Sunderland on 14 September 1974 resulted in him missing the rest of 1974\u201375, which he finished with six appearances in all competitions."]}, {"page": "Mackin, John", "response": ["#redirectJohn Mackin"]}, {"page": "1965\u201366 Northampton Town F.C. season", "response": ["|John Mackin||RB||||Bellshill||||9||1||Apprentice||November 1963||N/A", "| FB || style=\"text-align:left;\" |  John Mackin"]}, {"page": "1964\u201365 Northampton Town F.C. season", "response": ["|John Mackin||RB||||Bellshill||||0||0||Apprentice||November 1963||N/A", "| FB || style=\"text-align:left;\" |  John Mackin"]}, {"page": "1963\u201364 Northampton Town F.C. season", "response": ["|John Mackin||RB||||Bellshill||||0||0||Apprentice||November 1963||N/A", "| FB || style=\"text-align:left;\" |  John Mackin"]}, {"page": "1966\u201367 Northampton Town F.C. season", "response": ["|John Mackin||RB||||Bellshill||||45||5||Apprentice||November 1963||N/A", "| FB || style=\"text-align:left;\" |  John Mackin"]}]}}
