I\nLunn studies flow and transport systems in the shallow crust in an effort to characterise uncertainty in nuclear waste disposal,.Lunn developed techniques to monitor microseismic activity at depths of several kilometres. She has also investigated  self-healing grouts, She researches bacterials and microbial populations in prosthetic liners; research has also considered the development of cheap, safe and comfortable prosthetic limbs.Lunn leads two Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) Nuclear Waste consortia: Biogeochemical Applications in Nuclear Decommissioning and Waste Disposal (BANDD) and Systems Approach For Engineered (SAFE) Barriers. The BANDD consortia includes the investigation of biomineralisation to seal radionuclides and to seal rock fractures. SAFE (a \u00a31.3 M EPSRC programme) developed technology that can monitor thermo-hydro-mechanical-chemical reaction (THMC) variables, including pH, temperature, pressure and swelling.She is presently involved in a project that aims to reduce the USE of global cement and concrete, through a process called Microbially Induced Calcite Precipitation technique (MICP). Sponsored by the Royal Academy of Engineering and the civil Engineering Contractor, BAM Nuttal, this research has yielded results that can turn soil into a solid state. She has developed most of this research at the University of Strathclyde.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2017 Birthday Honours", "response": ["* Professor Rebecca Lunn, Professor at the University of Strathclyde.
