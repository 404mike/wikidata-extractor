Upon becoming an actor, he chose his father's surname as his stage name, later adopting the name Louis after Louie Dumbrowski, the character played by Bernard Gorcey in The Bowery Boys film series, whom his friends claimed he resembled.\nHe was best known for his role as Engelbert von Smallhausen (although in the BBC books he is named as Bobby Cedric von Smallhausen) in the popular BBC sitcom 'Allo 'Allo! in seasons 2 to 9. He also appeared in Department S (as \"Maxime\" in the episode \"The Treasure of the Costa del Sol\", 1969), the Ripping Yarns story \"Across the Andes By Frog\", and the Hammer House of Horror story \"The Thirteenth Reunion\". His film appearances have included The Small World of Sammy Lee (1963), the Beatles' film Help! (1965), the original version of The Italian Job (1969), Tales from the Crypt (1972), and the Dick Emery film Ooh... You Are Awful (1972).\nAfter 'Allo 'Allo! ended in 1992, he retired from acting. He was often credited as Louis Mansi in his roles. For six years he suffered from Parkinson's disease and in May 2010 was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. His interests included reading, letter writing, animal welfare and watching DVDs/videos of past favourite series/films.", "link_mentions": {}}}
