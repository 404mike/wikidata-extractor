There was a movement afoot for more modern coinage designs; the Irish Free State had in 1927 adopted a series of coins depicting animals and some of the colonies had redesigned their coinages.  King Edward was also interested in a move away from the heraldry that marked British coinage, showing foreign coins on his watch chain to the Deputy Master of the Mint, Robert Johnson, and asking for more like those.  King Edward eventually gave in on the question, fearing that such designs would be unacceptable to the British people, but non-heraldic themes for the halfpenny (a sailing ship) and farthing survived.  The selected design for the farthing, a wren, placed the smallest British bird on the British coin smallest in value.  In an attempt to break the deadlock between King Edward and the Mint, artist Wilson Parker had prepared a series of coinage designs based on what were loosely deemed royal animals: eagle, dove, stag, sturgeon, swan and wren, which though liked by the advisory committee (including a young Kenneth Clark) did not receive their endorsement due to the committee's preference for heraldry.  Another reason for the change was that the Britannia design, reduced from a model, was difficult to appreciate given the coin's small size.  The obverse was designed by Humphrey Paget.  King Edward got his way on one matter; his portrait faced left on the patterns, whereas by tradition a monarch faces in the opposite direction from the last reign, and George V had faced left.  Edward insisted as he considered his left profile his better side.
