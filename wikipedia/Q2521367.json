When Allcock left the band, he was replaced by Chris Leslie on vocals, mandolin and fiddle, who formerly worked with Swarbrick in Whippersnapper, and had a one-off stint with the band replacing Ric Sanders for 1992 Cropredy Festival.

By the time of the 30th anniversary Festival at Cropredy in 1997, the new Fairport had been in existence for over a decade and contributed a significant chapter to the history of the band.As commemorated in The Cropredy Box triple-CD set (1998).", "* Chris Leslie \u2013 fiddle, mandolin, bouzouki, vocal (1996\u2013present)", "* Chris Leslie \u2013 fiddle, mandolin, bouzouki, vocal", "* Chris Leslie \u2013 fiddle, mandolin, bouzouki, vocal"]}, {"page": "Dave Pegg", "response": [";On Beryl Marriott with Fairport Convention & Chris Leslie albums", ";On Chris Leslie albums"]}, {"page": "Dave Swarbrick", "response": ["By the time of the Fairport reformation Swarbrick was already occupied with his next project as part of a quartet under the name Whippersnapper, with the highly regarded musicians Martin Jenkins, Chris Leslie and Kevin Dempsey.
