With the Glens, he won the Irish League championship in 1952\u201353, the Gold Cup twice, the City Cup and the Ulster Cup once each. He was capped fourteen times by the Irish League XI between 1952 and 1959, and played in unofficial Northern Ireland matches in a tour of North America (1953) and against South Africa (1958). He was named the Ulster Footballer of the Year for the 1959\u201360 season.\nThe Billy Neill MBE Soccer School of Excellence in Dundonald, County Down is named after him.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Terry Conroy", "response": ["In 1964, Conroy was offered a contract at Shelbourne and Shamrock Rovers. However he instead moved to Northern Irish club Glentoran, where he believed that he would have a better chance of being spotted by an English club. He received a signing-on fee of \u00a3600. As the club were based in Belfast he had to spend the night at manager Billy Neill's house after midweek games as he would miss the last train back to Dublin, and would have to instead catch the train the following morning to make it back to his regular job as a printer. He played for the Glentoran 'Seconds' (reserve team) in the final of the Steel & Sons Cup on 25 December 1965, which ended in a 1\u20130 victory over Larne. He scored on his first team debut two days later, a 3\u20132 win over Bangor. He went on to score both goals for Glentoran in the Irish Cup final on 23 April 1966, a 2\u20130 win over Linfield at The Oval. In total he scored eight goals in the 1965\u201366 season, as the \"Glens\" finished third in the Irish League, two points behind champions Linfield. He went on to score 25 goals in the 1966\u201367 campaign, as Glentoran won the league by a one-point margin. He also played in Europe, as the Irish Cup win also qualified Glentoran to a place in the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1966\u201367, and he helped the club to a 1\u20131 draw at home with eventual runners-up Rangers before they suffered a 4\u20130 loss at Ibrox Stadium. He received a league winner's medal despite leaving the club before the end of the season."]}, {"page": "Ivor Morgan", "response": ["In 1908, Morgan was chosen to play for Wales against a touring Australian team. Morgan was an unpopular choice, but Cardiff's Billy Neill had switched to the professional league game and left a position to fill. In a tough game, Wales won 9\u20136 in which Morgan played well. He was selected for the next year's Home Nations Championship, and in a team that contained not only Owen, but also Jack Bancroft and Billy Trew, Wales beat England 8\u20130. In the next year's tournament, Morgan played all three games, including the newly introduced French team, against whom Morgan scored two tries. Morgan would play 13 matches in total for Wales, scoring a total of six tries, and lifting the Triple Crown in 1911. Due to strategic formation changes by the Welsh selectors, Morgan was dropped in 1912 and was sorely missed in the game against England when Wales were beaten fairly easily.Thomas (1979), pg 53."]}, {"page": "William Neill", "response": ["*Billy Neill (1929\u20131997), Irish footballer"]}, {"page": "Ulster Footballer of the Year", "response": ["|  1959\u201360 || ||align=left| Billy Neill || align=left| Glentoran|| "]}]}}
