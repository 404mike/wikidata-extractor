Nitze School of Advanced International Studies", "response": ["From 2005 to 2012, Johns Hopkins SAIS dedicated a substantive theme for each academic year in order to encourage its students, faculty, academic programs, policy centers, and alumni to examine the role of the particular theme within international affairs. These specific themes provided opportunities for the school to review scholarship and exchange views through special lectures, conferences, and guest speakers. The school hosted public events during the following themes of Energy (2005\u201306), China (2006\u201307), Elections and Foreign Policy (2007\u201308), Year of Water (2008\u201309), Religion (2009\u201310), Demography (2010\u201311), and Agriculture (2011\u201312) and enhanced its fundraising with high-profile public events such as the lecture delivered by then\u2013vice president of BP, Nick Butler, during the Year of Energy in 2005."]}, {"page": "British-American Project", "response": ["Established in 1985, BAP was created to help maintain and enrich the long-standing relationship between the United Kingdom and the United States. The Project was the brainchild of Nick Butler, an economist at BP, who at that time was also a prospective Labour Party parliamentary candidate and a research fellow at the Royal Institute of International Affairs (Chatham House). Along with many others in both countries who viewed the special relationship favorably, he had become concerned about a growing tide of anti-American sentiment among his generation in the UK. Butler's response was to propose a series of conferences, similar in format to the annual get-together of Anglo-German leaders at Konigswinter, developing relationships between the participants and broadening understanding. This rapidly gained backing from Chatham House and the US Embassy in London. It was Sir Charles Villiers, the former chairman of British Steel, who secured funding by inviting in two American anglophile friends, Lew van Dusen and Isadore Scott, who were able to secure funding and fulfill the dream of creating, in a younger generation, a multiplicity of transatlantic friendships like their own."]}]}}
