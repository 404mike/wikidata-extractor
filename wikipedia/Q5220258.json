The team finished second, 12 points behind Chelsea. At home against Middlesbrough on 22 August 2004, Bergkamp acted as captain for the injured Vieira in a match where Arsenal came back from 1\u20133 down to win 5\u20133 and equal Nottingham Forest's record of 42 league matches undefeated. Against Sheffield United in the FA Cup on 19 February 2005, Bergkamp was shown a straight red card by referee Neale Barry for shoving defender Danny Cullip. His appeal of the decision was rejected by The Football Association (FA), meaning he missed the club's next three domestic games. In Arsenal's final home match of the season, against Everton, Bergkamp had a man of the match game, scoring once and assisting three of the goals in a 7\u20130 win. Bergkamp was moved by Arsenal supporters chanting \"one more year\", describing it as \"quite special\". \"They obviously feel there is another year left in me, so that's great as it shows they're really behind me,\" he said. Following Arsenal's penalty shootout victory over Manchester United in the 2005 FA Cup Final, he signed a one-year contract extension."]}, {"page": "Danny Webber", "response": ["Webber initially joined Sheffield United on loan in March 2005 with Danny Cullip moving in the opposite direction. He scored after 93 seconds on his debut in a 4\u20130 away win over rivals Leeds United, and four days later, scored two goals against Queens Park Rangers. At the end of the 2004\u201305 season, he signed a permanent three-year contract with Sheffield United for a transfer fee of \u00a3500,000."]}, {"page": "Adam Bolder", "response": ["In January 2007 Bolder signed a two-and-a-half-year-long contract for Queens Park Rangers, where he was reunited with his former boss, John Gregory. QPR were struggling at the time, and there was a lack of grit and determination within the team. Bolder came in, and added steel to the midfield, with some good tackling performances and an excellent range of passing. Combined with the signings of Danny Cullip and Lee Camp (on loan), Bolder helped QPR to avoid relegation, quite comfortably in the end and was named as club captain. On 27 October 2007, Bolder scored his first goal for Queens Park Rangers in a 1\u20130 win over Charlton Athletic at The Valley which lifted QPR off the bottom of the table. On 8 February 2008, it was announced that Bolder would be joining fellow Championship side Sheffield Wednesday on a month's loan, which was later extended to the end of the 2007\u201308 season. On 8 April 2008 Bolder scored his first goals in an Owls shirt, netting twice in the Steel City Derby against Sheffield United in a 2\u20132 draw."]}, {"page": "Andy Crosby", "response": ["Crosby was sold on to Brighton & Hove Albion for a fee of \u00a310,000 in July 1999. He recovered from a \"mysterious illness\" that kept him in hospital for two nights in September 1999; it turned out to be caused by a virus in his left ear. He went on to make 41 appearances across the 1999\u20132000 campaign. He formed a strong centre-back partnership with Danny Cullip during the 2000\u201301 season as Brighton won promotion out of the Third Division as champions; he scored two goals in 39 games, including one goal scored with his ear against Blackpool. He had a \"clear the air meeting\" with manager Micky Adams in September 2001 after being dropped for Matt Wicks. Following the meeting he was transfer-listed at his own request after finding his first-team chances at the Withdean Stadium limited."]}, {"page": "West London derby", "response": ["* Danny Cullip \u2013 first Fulham, then Brentford."]}, {"page": "2005 FA Cup Final", "response": ["Arsenal's opponent in the fifth round was Sheffield United. After 35 minutes Dennis Bergkamp was sent off for his apparent push on Danny Cullip. With eleven minutes of normal time remaining, Robert Pires scored for Arsenal, but the team conceded a late penalty which Andy Gray converted. The equaliser for Sheffield United meant the match was replayed at Bramall Lane on 1 March 2005. Both teams played out a goalless draw after full-time and throughout extra-time, so the tie was decided by a penalty shootout. Arsenal goalkeeper Manuel Almunia saved two penalties, which ensured progress into the quarter-finals."]}, {"page": "Patrick Kanyuka", "response": ["Born in Kinshasa, Kanyuka started his career with Leyton Orient as a youth player in 2003 before joining Queens Park Rangers the following year.

After a shaky start to life in the Championship, Stewart hit form after the arrival of Danny Cullip from Nottingham Forest. He soon cemented his place in the Queens Park Rangers side and played more than 80\u00a0games in the 2006\u201307 and 2007\u201308 seasons. In the 2007\u201308 season, Stewart scored five goals, but was also sent off twice. He memorably scored the only goal as QPR knocked Aston Villa out of the 2008\u201309 League Cup with a 1\u20130 victory at Villa Park.Archived at Ghostarchive and the Wayback Machine: "]}]}}
