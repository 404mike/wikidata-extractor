He is a professor of cultural studies at Kyung Hee University in the Graduate School of British and American Language and Culture and visiting professor at the European Graduate School, where he teaches in the Faculty of Media and Communication alongside Alain Badiou, Judith Butler, Jacques Ranci\u00e8re, Avital Ronell, Slavoj \u017di\u017eek and others. Most notable for his translation and introductions to the philosophy of Alain Badiou, Barker draws on an eclectic range of influences including neoplatonism, Lacanian psychoanalysis and Marxism. Writing in both the English and French languages, Barker has also contributed to debates in post-Marxism.In an article published in The Guardian in February 2012, Barker criticised the selective interpretation of Karl Marx's writings by economists such as Nouriel Roubini when responding to the global recession. According to Barker, such interpretations water down the revolutionary aspects of Marx's ideas and focus unduly on their reformist tendencies.Writing in The New York Times on the occasion of the Marx bicentennial anniversary, Barker argued: \"The key factor in Marx\u2019s intellectual legacy in our present-day society is not 'philosophy' but 'critique,' or what he described in 1843 as 'the ruthless criticism of all that exists: ruthless both in the sense of not being afraid of the results it arrives at and in the sense of being just as little afraid of conflict with the powers that be'\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alternate history", "response": ["Although not dealing in physical time travel, in his alt-history novel Marx Returns, Jason Barker introduces anachronisms into the life and times of Karl Marx, such as when his wife Jenny sings a verse from the Sex Pistols's song \"Anarchy in the U.K.\", or in the games of chess she plays with the Marxes' housekeeper Helene Demuth, which on one occasion involves a Caro\u2013Kann Defence. In her review of the novel, Nina Power writes of \"Jenny\u2019s 'utopian' desire for an end to time\", an attitude which, according to Power, is inspired by her husband's co-authored book The German Ideology. However, in keeping with the novel's anachronisms, the latter was not published until 1932. By contrast, the novel's timeline ends in 1871."]}, {"page": "Karl Marx", "response": ["In 2017, a feature film, titled The Young Karl Marx, featuring Marx, his wife Jenny Marx, and Engels, among other revolutionaries and intellectuals prior to the Revolutions of 1848, received good reviews for both its historical accuracy and its brio in dealing with intellectual life.
