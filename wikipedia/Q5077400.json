After studying chemistry at Imperial College London, he gained a PhD for his work on copper phthalocyanin, then worked for ICI Dyestuffs Group in Manchester and also studied secret writing, which he later made use of during the Second World War. \nHe completed his medical studies in 1944. The following year, he was sent by the Medical Research Council to the recently liberated concentration camp at Belsen together with Janet Vaughan and Rosalind Pitt-Rivers, to study if starvation could be treated with protein hydrolysates. \nFrom 1946, his career focused on several inborn errors of metabolism. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1976 New Year Honours", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of eponymous diseases", "response": ["* Dent disease \u2013 Charles Enrique Dent"]}, {"page": "Charles Dent", "response": ["* Charles Enrique Dent (1911\u20131976), physician and biochemist"]}, {"page": "Canada Gairdner International Award", "response": ["*1965 Jerome W.
