The team was the primary entrant of the new GTi version of the Volkswagen Golf, which had been launched in 1976, and primary backing came from Volkswagen Great Britain.

Although the added weight of the camera systems hampered the performance of the 956, the car was still driven as normal by Richard Lloyd and teammate, Pink Floyd drummer Nick Mason, and it made its debut at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. GTi's main 956 entry, however, remained a front runner in the hands of Lammers and John Fitzpatrick. Jonathan Palmer substituted for Fitzpatrick and, along with Lammers, took the team's first World Championship victory at Brands Hatch, two laps ahead of a Joest Racing Porsche. Soon after the victory, the team debuted its new car, the custom-built 956 GTi. The GTi was quickly able to usurp its predecessor, taking second at Imola. The team ended the year with Lammers and Fitzpatrick tied for fifth in the Drivers Championship.", "During 1985, the team officially changed its title to Richard Lloyd Racing, although the GTi Engineering name was retained as part of the company. The team continued on with their 956s, even though some competitors were now using the improved 962C. The season began with Lammers and Palmer earning good results, and the team managed to earn a second-place finish at the 24 Hours of Le Mans with Jonathan Palmer, James Weaver, and Lloyd himself completing the race only three laps behind the winning Joest Porsche but ahead of the factory Rothmans Porsche. Trouble occurred during practice for the 1000\u00a0km Spa when a tyre let go, sending the car into the barrier at , injuring Palmer and badly damaging the car, forcing it to undergo a lengthy rebuild.

A second-place finish at the N\u00fcrburgring was the only other podium showing of the year, and the team finished the season sixth in the Teams Championship.  Outside of the World Championship, the 956 GTi also made an appearance at an Interserie event at Richard Lloyd Racing's home track of Thruxton, winning one heat and finishing second overall in the combined results.", "Richard Lloyd Racing replaced their aging 956 GTi prior to the 1987 season.  A new 962C-based car was obtained, although it was once again built to a unique GTi specification.  Jonathan Palmer and Mauro Baldi became full-season drivers for the squad.  The team repeated their lack of early success from the previous year, once again earning a victory in the second half of the season.  However, unlike the previous Brands Hatch successes, this one was earned at the Norisring sprint event.  Brands Hatch remained lucky for the team though, as they earned a second place that year.  Richard Lloyd Racing closed off the season with a third at Fuji, earning them fifth in the Teams Championship and helping Baldi tie for eighth in the Drivers Championship.

A fifth-place finish at Dijon-Prenois and fourth-place finish in the finale at Aut\u00f3dromo Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez were once again the only points earned by Richard Lloyd Racing, leaving them ninth in the Teams Championship.  A home success outside the World Championship was achieved when Needell took second in a Supercup event at Silverstone.", "For 1990, Richard Lloyd Racing signed Japanese firm Italiya as the primary sponsor for the team.

A sixth place at Spa and third at a shortened Montreal event were the highlights of the year, and Richard Lloyd Racing was once again ninth in the championship with three points.  The team also ran a standard 962C at Le Mans for Nick Mason.  The Mason-owned car finished eleventh while the team's 962C GTi withdrew after a pit fire.  After the season ended, Richard Lloyd Racing was closed due to a lack of funding necessary to continue on into 1991.", "Following a successful debut season with the 956 in 1983, Richard Lloyd commissioned designer Nigel Stroud to develop a replacement monocoque and base chassis for the team's car in an attempt to increase structural rigidity over that of the factory Porsche unit.  Aluminium composite honeycomb was used in place of aluminium sheet metal in constructing the new monocoque.  This car, originally 956 chassis #106, was replaced by the Stroud-designed chassis designated #106B, leading to the car being renamed a 956 GTi.", "Two further 962C GTi chassis were constructed by GTi Engineering.  Dyson Racing purchased chassis #202, which they further modified for the Camel GT Championship, becoming known as #DR1.  Dyson's 962C GTi won a single event in San Antonio, Texas.  ADA Engineering received #203 for the 1992 24 Hours of Le Mans before using it again in 1994 with Team Nippon.  Chassis #106B was sold after Richard Lloyd had replaced it, and it ended up in the All Japan Sports Prototype Championship in the hands of Trust Racing Team from 1988 to 1990, then the Nisseki Racing Team in 1991.
