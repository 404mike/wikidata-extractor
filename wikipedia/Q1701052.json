Upon arrival at Durban, he was met by the botanist John Medley Wood, who provided him with his analytical key of Natal plants, Colonel Bowker, a keen naturalist and writer, and Richard Vause, co-founder of the Natal Mercury paper and also past Mayor of Durban \u2013 all waiting in person. This may well have been the most harmonious period in Fourcade's life. It was certainly the highlight of his career as a forestry officer. He was welcomed by the Natal Government, given transport and made a member of several clubs, introduced to all the magistrates of the districts included in his brief and had the railway workshops at his disposal. He was free to employ his skills and knowledge without hindrance from anyone and quickly demonstrated an immense capacity for hard work. The work included inspecting each forest's climate, average altitude, area and extent, soils, rock, tree species and surface growth. He had to assess the extent of damage by exploitation, fire or sapling depletion (by local hut builders or herders with grazing animals). The quality of the prose in the report shows that he was passionate about the state of the forests. He reconstructed how particular sequences of events had to have happened for forests to be in the state he found them. He took nearly 300 specimens of wood from about 70 species of trees for testing. The Report on the Natal Forests, which was published on 3 December 1889, towers over both the previous and later reports by other authors. It discusses the Natal forests, their utility and protection, management as well as plantations, and organisation of staff and works. It contains a list of 167 species of tree indigenous to Natal; mechanical constants determined by experiment of the hardness, density, elasticity coefficient, elasticity limit, breaking stress; notes on the preparation of wood and railway sleeper manufacture, a list of trees with high bark tannin content, measurements of rates of growth for indigenous trees, timber measurements, recommendations for vegetation from other countries that would be suitable for acclimatisation in Natal as forest vegetation, the altitude ranges at which some 91 species of exotic tree were found, statistics of timber imports for the decade 1880 to 1889 as well as a short extract on 'diminished rainfall' that the Governor had requested, concerning the theory that there might be a link between sunspots and rainfall. All the work was done in 10 months. Fourcade was 24 years old.

Due to his father's ill-health, Ernest left school at 14 to assist with the business. A short spell of active service on the frontier followed, after which he joined the Oriental Banking Corporation, later the Bank of Africa. After being transferred to Middelburg in the Cape, he developed an interest in the local plants and spent long hours dissecting and identifying wild flowers with the aid of the three volumes of Flora Capensis and Harvey's Genera. However, it was not till 1888 when he became bank manager in Grahamstown, that his collecting took on a serious turn. In 1889 he was transferred to Barberton and became intrigued by the relatively unknown local flora. His specimens now started reflecting his meticulous nature in that they were carefully pressed, preserved and labelled with extensive notes on locality, habitat and plant form. His duplicates soon found their way to Kew, Zurich and a number of notable botanists such as Harry Bolus, John Medley Wood and Peter MacOwan. Not surprisingly his collection became internationally known. In Barberton he befriended a young lawyer and plant collector Douglas Gilfillan, later to become his brother-in-law through their marriage to the de Jongh sisters. Galpin had had some new plant discoveries painted by Marie Elizabeth de Jongh (the daughter of Countess Mimi von Sch\u00f6nnberg) and married her in 1892.

John Medley Wood founded the Natal Government Herbarium in 1882 which was at first a wood and corrugated iron hut in which he organised the storage of over 1,500 plant specimens.
