Since 2013, she has been Emeritus Professor of History at University of Warwick, where she had previously been a Professor of History since 1999. Steedman graduated from the University of Sussex with an undergraduate degree in English and American Studies in 1968, and then completed a master's degree at Newnham College, Cambridge, in 1974.

Steedman returned to Newnham College to complete her doctorate, which was awarded in 1989.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Microhistory", "response": ["*Carolyn Steedman"]}, {"page": "Raphael Samuel", "response": ["In an obituary in the journal Radical Philosophy, Carolyn Steedman describes Samuel's work:Like Raymond Williams and Edward Thompson, he produced his historical work in interaction with working-class adult returners to education.... The standard charge against the history Samuel inspired was of a fanatical empiricism and a romantic merging of historians and their subjects in crowded narratives, in which each hard-won detail of working lives, wrenched from the cold indifference of posterity, is piled upon another, in a relentless rescue of the past. When he was himself subject to these charges, it was presumably his fine \u2013 and immensely detailed \u2013 accounts of the labour process that critics had in mind. But it was meaning rather than minutiae that he cared about.
