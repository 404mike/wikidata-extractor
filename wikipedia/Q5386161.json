At the beginning of 1965 work began on constructing the ground and speedway returned. The second time around it proved successful, and remained at the ground for the next twenty years. By the 1970s people valued it greater than football for family entertainment, with the Dukes producing such renowned riders as Eric Boocock and Kenny Carter.

Reg Fearman had decided to close his operation at Middlesbrough (performing as a mid-table side in the Provincial League) at the end of 1964, and as a result was able to bring some of those riders to the new Halifax side - these consisted of the up-and coming Dave Younghusband and Eric Boocock, and a steady middle order man in Clive Hitch. He'd also been able to persuade ex-England international Eric Boothroyd (now running a grocer's business in Halifax) to come out of retirement and captain the new side. The rider control process had allocated the Dukes one ex-England international, Bryan Elliott from Coventry and the team was made up by a number of young, inexperienced Australians - Bert Kingston, Bob Jameson and later Dennis Gavros.", "Success at the Shay was not long in coming however and the Dukes soon beat off the challenge of the Newport Wasps and Coventry Bees before recording a comfortable 43-34 win over local rivals the Sheffield Tigers. During this period Eric Boocock and Dave Younghusband were establishing themselves as forces to be reckoned with in the new league and Eric Boothroyd and Bryan Elliott (especially away matches) provided plenty of support. Clive Hitch was clearly struggling to come to terms with his new home circuit however and the young Aussies were inconsistent and still finding their feet. A month into the season and it seemed as though the team might hold their own at home, but would continue to struggle away from the Shay. To the encouragement of the promoter however, the good early crowd levels were holding up as the Halifax public took to their new team in a big way.", "| Eric Boocock", "June however saw a change in fortune as the team racked up big home wins against Newport Wasps and Long Eaton Archers as well as a first KO cup win 57-39 against the Glasgow Tigers.  This was combined with good away wins at Long Eaton, Exeter Falcons and a magnificent 41-37 win at the West Ham Hammers where Eric Boocock underlined his progress with an impeccable maximum 12 points. Although the contribution from the heat leaders was vital, it was the improved results from Tommy Roper and the Aussie brigade that was making the difference. Solid home scoring from Kingston, Gavros and Jameson was being complemented by more effective away form that was now showing in the team results. At the end of June, although Coventry were still 7 points clear, Halifax had shot up the table to joint second with Swindon, Belle Vue and Glasgow.", "It began to look as though the bubble might have burst at the start of July when the Dukes lost heavily at both title rivals Coventry Bees (25-52) and Swindon Robins (29-49) in successive weeks - the ex-national sides heat leader strength proving too much even for the emerging Eric Boocock to master.  Despite these reverses good home form kept the Dukes in contention, but July ended with further problems with both Eric Boothroyd and Eric Boocock on the injury list.", "So 1966 had ended as a memorable year, culminating in a record run of 15 consecutive league victories with all the team improving their averages and contributing to the success.  Eric Boocock established himself as the star rider and made the breakthrough as a regular in the Gt Britain team. Dave Younghusband was a consistent high score all year after some initial problems with new machinery, but it was Eric Boothroyd who came up with a true captains performance adding over a point on his previous years average. Of the rest, Tommy Roper again proved a remarkably effective \"fourth heat leader\" scoring particularly well during the second half of the year and Bert Kingston established himself as the best of the Aussie second strings although both Dennis Gavros and Bob Jameson had many memorable meetings. Greg Kentwell had only a limited number of opportunities in the team, but had confirmed the promise with which he\u2019d arrived and spent much of the year loaned out to Long Eaton to gain more experience.", "| Eric Boocock", "Nevertheless, the team still had the core strength of Eric Boocock, Dave Younghusband and Eric Boothroyd \u2013 a match for most. There was also good reason to believe that Bert Kingston and maybe Dennis Gavros could progress into the sort of solid scoring second strings that could fill the gap left by Roper. So most supporters viewed the coming season with some hope of success \u2013 if only things went the Dukes way!", "It was the beginning of May before the Dukes managed an away win (42-36) at Cradley Heath with Dave Youghusband extending his unbeaten run against the Heathens with a fine maximum. This was without Bert Kingston though who\u2019d crashed heavily the previous Saturday in the home win over Glasgow and been diagnosed with a fractured skull which was to sideline him for 3 months. It was followed almost immediately by an upset at home when the Coventry Bees scrambled a draw. It was after a tightly fought contest, partly down to a below par score from Eric Boocock who had been suffering engine problems for some time and spent most of this match on borrowed equipment. Then, as if to underline the inconsistency, the Dukes went to Newcastle two days later and beat a highly rated Diamonds side by 44-34 with Dennis Gavros suddenly finding some away form with 6 paid 8. Unfortunately, this was to be the last away success of the year.", "One bright spot throughout this period was the form of Eric Boocock. He had overcome his early machine problems and was now established as a true international star, underlined by his top scoring for Great Britain in the series against Sweden and some magical moments in the following series against Poland  (including an 18-point maximum in the home test at Halifax).", "By the end of August, the team had established a consistent mid-table position following some solid home performances and despite the loss of Dave Younghusband for four matches with yet another injury. His return to track action at the end of the month however was an unfortunate affair. This was against Cradley Heath at the Shay on a very damp night. After winning his opening ride, Younghusband joined fellow Halifax riders Eric Boocock and Dennis Gavros in walking out of the meeting in protest at the track conditions despite the referee ruling that the match should progress. Halifax were allowed special dispensation to bring Maurie Robinson into the side as a replacement, and the match went ahead with various levels of enthusiasm from the remaining riders. Almost inevitably this led to the Dukes first and only home defeat of the season by a narrow 38-39 margin and despite the sterling effort of Bob Jameson who top scored with 12 from 6 rides.", "September was memorable for Eric Boocock's 3rd place in the British Final (12 pts) at West Ham behind Barry Briggs and Ivan Mauger to qualify for his first world final at Wembley.  In the big event itself he came away with a very creditable 6th place on 9 points after winning his first ride and scoring in each of his others.", "For the team, however, the season petered out in a fairly low-key way with more home wins (including a 61\u201317 thrashing of King's Lynn \u2013 a record), and yet more away defeats.  This culminated in a poor 32-point thrashing at Oxford (23\u201355) at the end of September where only Eric Boocock with 12 did himself any justice. At least the final home match of the year at the Shay on 7 October produced a good pay night for the Dukes with all the team scoring heavily as the Newport Wasps were despatched 60-18. Only regular to miss out was Greg Kentwell, who had sailed back to Australia a couple of weeks earlier, and fittingly Bert Kingston scored his first league paid maximum for the club in what was to be his last match in England.", "So in the end, luck didn't go with the Dukes. The loss of Roper and the seemingly never-ending series of injuries proved too much to overcome. A final league position of 7th was better than 12 other teams could manage, but was a disappointment after so much success the previous year. Of the riders, Eric Boocock had scored much the same as the previous season but had clearly improved further. Dave Younghusband had upped his average and become the team's most effective scorer at the Shay with an average in excess of 11. Eric Boothroyd had dropped back a little, but was still a very solid  heat leader. The real difference from the previous season lay below these 3 where none of the young Aussies were able to raise their game home and away to make up for the loss of Roper. Kingston had suffered a career-threatening injury almost from the off which eventually led to his retirement from British Speedway. Gavros was gloriously inconsistent away but excellent at home. Greg Kentwell had developed into a useful rider and Maurie Robinson had looked promising before also succumbing to the injury blight. Bob Jameson and Les Bentzen had found the year a struggle \u2013 particularly on their travels away from the Shay.", "| Eric Boocock", "The season started at the end of March with another trip to a strong looking Swindon Robins side. The Robins comfortably saw off the Duke's challenge by 48-30, but Eric Boocock inflicted an early defeat on Swindon legend Barry Briggs on his way to an excellent 14 points.  Boothroyd aside with a creditable 9 points however, the rest of the team found the going tough.", "Mid-Summer saw a plethora of international matches. First against the Russian tourists closely followed by internationals against Sweden and Poland leading up to the newly formed World League. Eric Boocock was now a regular in the England team, and missed a number of Halifax matches due to fixture clashes, and with Younghusband also out for a couple of weeks through illness during July the promotion was kept busy making sure that the Dukes had effective sides out.  They were almost undone at the end of July when the Ivan Mauger led Newcastle Diamonds arrived at the Shay and left on the back of a very close 38-40 defeat. Fortunately Eric Boocock was back for this one and scored an impressive 15 point maximum as the Dukes used rider replacement for the missing Younghusband. This included the only defeat of Ivan Mauger all night and an impressive last heat win to snatch the points for the Dukes when he came from the back to beat young Danish newcomer Ole Olsen and experienced Dave Gifford. This match also heralded the return of a rejuvenated Les Sharpe to the team.", "| Eric Boocock", "That left a big hole to fill in the team because, although not quite as effective as in previous seasons, Eric had still comfortably held down a heat leader role in the team. The captaincy was quickly handed over to Eric Boocock, expected as ever to lead from the front again in 1969. But any hopes that a 'superstar' replacement would be forthcoming were quickly dashed, and instead it was announced that the team would be much the same as the previous year, with the 'full-time' return of Alan Jay after impressing in his 'temporary' stint at the start of 1968.", "As usual the season started with a 34-43 away defeat at Swindon, but there was encouragement in the way that Eric Boocock twice beat Barry Briggs, relieving him of the Silver Sash match race title in the process, and the consensus was that Pander was worth more than a solitary point from his first match.", "So at mid term, the 'Dukes' were still third in the league but had dropped 6 points behind Belle Vue. Eric Boocock was in phenomenal form, still unbeaten by an opposing rider round the Shay and averaging over 11 points a match. Younghusband too had been in good form, but tonsillitis problems were interrupting his season. Jay had contributed good scores, particularly away and Gavros and Kentwell in particular were dominant around the Shay. Jameson was good at home, but poor away and the supporters were still waiting to see the best of the enigmatic Sharpe. Still, with matches in hand, third was definitely a platform for making a title challenge!", "Somehow, new captain Eric Boocock did manage to improve further  and had the year of his life at team level, averaging almost 11 points a match, finishing as top Englishman and behind only world superstars Barry Briggs and Ivan Mauger in the league averages. Dave Younghusband had to overcome some niggling injuries and illness, but he also put 1/2 point on his average, and in fact EVERY Dukes rider improved their average from the previous year. A very creditable achievement indeed.", "| Eric Boocock", "thumb|centre|320x240px|Halifax 'Dukes' 1970  Standing - Dave Younghusband, Les Sharpe, Eric Boothroyd (Promoter), Alan Jay, Terry Lee, Colin Mckee, Greg Kentewell  On Machine - Eric Boocock (Captain)  (From the John Somerville Collection)", "At the top of the team, the points scoring phenomenon that was Eric Boocock had been retained and Dave Younghusband had been persuaded not to go to Newcastle, so the 'engine room' looked intact. At the other end of the squad, junior Terry Lee was promoted full-time at the expense of the loyal Bob Jameson. He'd had a good season at Middlesbrough the previous year so there was every reason to think that he'd hold his own in the higher division.", "Individually, it had been a mixed year for the riders. As explained before, Les Sharpe started like an express train, but his sudden burst of light soon flickered and died away. Captain Eric Boocock had another great season, the veritable rock on which the team is built but, incredibly, at the end his average was about half a point down on that memorable 1969. Dave Younghusband was still capable of beating anybody and put in some great performances, but there were less of them than in previous years and he ended up nearly 1.5 points down on the previous term.", "| Eric Boocock", "The rest of the team was pretty familiar. Eric Boocock and Dave Younghusband (finally!) were back to provide the spearhead, supported by the steady Alan Jay and the unpredictable Aussie Greg Kentwell (who was amazingly still 'on the verge' of breaking through to real star status!). Greg was coming back after yet another 'hot' close season in Australia, but also on the back of a big crash at the Sydney Showground - supporters were holding their breath to see how fit he was.", "Individually, Eric Boocock again did the club proud, progressing comfortably through the European final at Wembley with 10 points to reach the World Final at Ullevi, Sweden in September. Ole Olsen was a worthy winner on the night, but it wasn't so good for Boocock who finished on four points, although he did manage a win in one heat.
