Burgess, Tester and Pierce all pleaded not guilty. Agar gave evidence against his former colleagues again, and told the court he was, in Thomas's words, \"a self-confessed professional criminal who had not made an honest living since the age of eighteen\". Witnesses included the locksmith John Chubb, the bullion dealers, transportation agents, SER staff, the station staff of London Bridge and Folkestone, a customs officer from Boulogne, railway police, taverners and hotel keepers. All corroborated Agar's story that the four men knew each other, and were present together at various stages of the planning and execution of the crime."]}, {"page": "George Chubb, 1st Baron Hayter", "response": ["Chubb was the son of John Chubb (d. 1872), and the grandson of Charles Chubb (1772\u20131845), who had founded Chubb and Sons Lock and Safe Co.

Chubb was knighted in 1885 and created a Baronet, of Newlands, in 1900. In 1927 he was further honoured when he was raised to the peerage as Baron Hayter, of Chislehurst in the County of Kent. George Chubb's middle name Hayter, (his grandmother's maiden name) was used for the Barony since at the time it was considered unacceptable for company names (albeit a family company) to be used in the House of Lords."]}, {"page": "Charles Chubb (businessman)", "response": ["He soon moved to London and then to Wolverhampton, where he employed 200 workers.

At East Molesey, Wesleyan services began in 1847 in a schoolroom.  John Chubb of the Chubb and Sons locksmith company, an active and wealthy Wesleyan who founded various chapels and who sometimes fished in the River Thames at Molesey, bought some land for a chapel in 1866 and became a trustee of the church.  A temporary building opened in 1867, succeeded by the present yellow-brick chapel in 1877.  A Wesleyan chapel was built on Annett Road in Walton-on-Thames in the mid-19th century and was succeeded by the present chapel on Terrace Road in 1887.  The brick chapel in Weybridge was registered in 1903.  The Methodist church at Esher was registered in 1897 but closed by 2000, when its registration was cancelled.  At Cobham\u2014where John Wesley stopped on three occasions while travelling along the Portsmouth Road\u2014a chapel opened on Cedar Road in 1862.  A Sunday School was built next to it in the 1930s, and this was converted into a church in 1964 when the old chapel was demolished.
