He gave the actor and dramatist Peter Ustinov his first break with his production The House of Regrets. His film career was brief, but varied. He played Hastings in Laurence Olivier's Richard III (1955), and also appeared in wartime films such as One of Our Aircraft Is Missing (1942), although he was in fact a conscientious objector. He also appeared in The Adventures of Quentin Durward (1955).Clunes' later stage work included succeeding Rex Harrison as Henry Higgins in the stage musical My Fair Lady in 1959.

The critic Michael Billington wrote in his review of the production: \"The more I see Love's Labour's Lost, the more I think it Shakespeare's most beguiling comedy.

The production took place at the Arts Theatre in Cambridge and excited audiences because of its 25-year absence from the English stage. The writer T. C. Worsley was impressed by Hordern's performance and wrote: \"Perhaps an actor with star quality might have imposed on us more successfully than Mr Michael Hordern, and won our sympathy for Ivanov by his own personality. But such a performance would have raised the level of expectation all round. As it is, Mr Hordern is rich in intelligence, sensitivity and grasp, and with very few exceptions, the company give his impressive playing the right kind of support.\"T. C. Worsley; quoted in Hordern, pp. 88\u201389. The title character in Macbeth, directed by Alec Clunes, was Hordern's next engagement.
