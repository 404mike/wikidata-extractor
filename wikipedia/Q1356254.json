However, the group was facing an internal schism between those (such as Hyndman), who argued for a parliamentary path toward socialism, and those (like Morris) who deemed the Houses of Parliament intrinsically corrupt and capitalist. Personal issues between Morris and Hyndman were exacerbated by their attitude to British foreign policy; Morris was staunchly anti-imperialist while Hyndman expressed patriotic sentiment encouraging some foreign intervention. The division between the two groups developed into open conflict, with the majority of activists sharing Morris's position. In December 1884 Morris and his supporters\u00a0\u2013 most notably Ernest Belfort Bax and Edward Aveling\u00a0\u2013 left the SDF; the first major schism of the British socialist movement."]}, {"page": "Fran\u00e7ois-No\u00ebl Babeuf", "response": ["* Ernest Belfort Bax, Last Episodes of the French Revolution, Haskell House Pub Ltd (1911; reprinted 1971), "]}, {"page": "History of Freemasonry", "response": ["According to Ernest Belfort Bax, Freemasons were responsible for the last serious attempt at conciliation between Versailles and the Paris Commune on 21 April 1871. They were received coldly by Adolphe Thiers, who assured them that, though Paris was given over to destruction and slaughter, the law should be enforced, and he kept his word. A few days after they decided, in a public meeting, to plant their banner on the ramparts and throw in their lot with the Commune. On the 29th, accordingly, 10,000 of the brethren met (55 lodges being represented), and marched to the H\u00f4tel de Ville, headed by the Grand Masters in full insignia and the banners of the lodges. Amongst them the new banner of Vincennes was conspicuous, bearing the inscription in red letters on a white ground, \"Love one another.\" A balloon was then sent up, which let fall at intervals, outside Paris, a manifesto of the Freemasons. The procession then wended its way through the boulevards and the Champs Elys\u00e9es to the Arc de Triomphe, where the banners were planted at various points along the ramparts. On seeing the white flag on the Porte Maillot the Versaillese ceased firing, and the commander, himself a Freemason, received a deputation of brethren, and suggested a final appeal to Versailles, which was agreed to. The \"chief of the executive\" hardly listened to the envoys, and declined to further discuss the question of peace with anyone. This last formal challenge having been made and rejected, the Freemasons definitely took their stand as combatants for the Commune.The Paris Commune \u2013 IX.

He recognized the historical role of the national factor and said that the proletariat must support their country against external dangers. He called on workers to assimilate themselves within nation-states, which entailed support for colonial policies and imperial projects. Bernstein was sympathetic to the idea of imperial expansions as a positive and civilizing mission, which resulted in a bitter series of polemics with the anti-imperialist Ernest Belfort Bax. Bernstein supported colonialism as he believed it uplifted backward peoples and it worked well for both Britain and Germany. Bernstein supported such policies in an intensely racialised manner, arguing in 1896 that \"races who are hostile to or incapable of civilisation cannot claim our sympathy when they revolt against civilisation\" and that the \"savages [must] be subjugated and made to conform to the rules of higher civilisation\".Mcgeever, Brendan, and Satnam Virdee. \"Antisemitism and Socialist Strategy in Europe, 1880\u20131917: An Introduction.\" Patterns of Prejudice 51.3-4 (2017): 229 However, he was disturbed by the Kaiser's reckless policies.
