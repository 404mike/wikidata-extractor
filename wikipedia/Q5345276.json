Sellon is the author of other erotic novels and a book on snake worship, whereas Potter wrote and had privately printed two books of letters on the Prince of Wales' visit to India in 1875\u20131876.  From examining the text in Letters from India during H. R. H. the Prince of Wales visit in 1875\u20136, from William S. Potter to his sister, one could make a stronger case for Potter, as there are similarities in writing style between the book of letters and The Romance of Lust.
