Only Scott Parker, Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, and Chris David, the lack of experience showed Fulham conceded a corner after just 17 seconds as Ipswich created the early chances. Fulham almost capitalised on an error by Dean Gerken when the Ipswich goalkeeper fumbled David's 20-yard shot but he made amends to deny Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 with his legs. Although Fulham were enjoying the majority of possession, Ipswich continued to create chances, and it was the hosts who broke the deadlock in the 32nd minute when Luke Hyam's incisive through ball released Daryl Murphy, who outpaced Shaun Hutchinson before making no mistake with a powerful finish. Ipswich doubled their advantage on 62 minutes: Murphy was again too strong for Hutchinson on the left wing and, while his low cross was half cleared, it fell perfectly for David McGoldrick. It was now comfortable for the hosts with Fulham looking a beaten outfit well before the final whistle. Anthony Wordsworth should have added a third 11 minutes from time when he headed over from ten yards following excellent work from McGoldrick and Luke Chambers. McGoldrick called Jesse Joronen into action from the corner of the penalty area after yet more tenacious play by Jay Tabb, before Fulham pulled a goal back out of nothing: Tim Hoogland cut inside Tyrone Mings and his weak shot took a wicked deflection off the body of Tommy Smith to take it past Gerken's near post. The lifeline galvanised Fulham and another deflection almost gave substitute Patrick Roberts an equaliser, but Ipswich held on to claim all three points."]}, {"page": "2015\u201316 Rotherham United F.C. season", "response": ["|Luke Hyam", "| 26 November 2015 || CM ||  || Luke Hyam || Ipswich Town || 22 December 2015 || "]}, {"page": "2015\u201316 Ipswich Town F.C. season", "response": ["| 26 November 2015 || CM ||  || Luke Hyam ||  Rotherham United || 20 December 2015 || ", "|Luke Hyam"]}]}}
