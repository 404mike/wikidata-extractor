The first trophy was won early in the season in the First Division Shield with Waterford United being beaten 2\u20131 over two legs. Another addition that year was the installation of floodlights at the historic Showgrounds. Rovers began with a 4\u20130 over Home Farm. With three games to spare, promotion was guaranteed with a 2\u20130 away win over Athlone Town, with the First Division title secured with a 1\u20130 home win over Bray Wanderers. The club's best day of the season was set up by Eddie Annand's winning goal in the FAI Cup semi-final over Limerick at the Showgrounds. The final against Premier Division Derry City was fixed for 15 May at Lansdowne Road on what proved to be another wet day. The game was won by Gerry Carr's header and captain Gavin Dykes lifted the trophy. McStay left at the end of the season to return to Celtic and he would be replaced by Wimbledon cup final hero Lawrie Sanchez but only after caretaker Chris Rutherford had guided Rovers to their first European win, beating Maltese side Floriana 3\u20132 on aggregate in the Cup Winners' cup. Padraig Moran, one of the club's all-time leading goalscorers, scored Rovers' first European goal. The next round pitted Rovers against big name opposition in the shape of Belgian side Club Brugge. Despite Johnny Kenny's goal in the first leg Rovers lost 2\u20131 at the Showgrounds and then 3\u20131 in the return leg."]}, {"page": "1998\u201399 Scottish Premier League", "response": ["|  Eddie Annand || Dundee"]}, {"page": "Scottish Football League monthly awards", "response": ["| Eddie Annand"]}, {"page": "List of Sligo Rovers F.C. seasons", "response": ["|Eddie Annand", "|Eddie Annand"]}, {"page": "List of Dundee F.C. seasons", "response": ["|Eddie Annand"]}, {"page": "1997\u201398 Scottish First Division", "response": ["|style=\"text-align:left;\"|  Eddie Annand (Dundee)"]}, {"page": "2000\u201301 Dundee F.C. season", "response": ["| Eddie Annand"]}, {"page": "Annand", "response": ["* Eddie Annand, Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "Gordon Burns (footballer)", "response": ["A period of vast investment in the playing squad at Ayr from millionaire Chairman Bill Barr saw the arrivals of high-calibre players such as Neil Duffy, Pat McGinlay, Eddie Annand, John Hughes, James Grady, Andy Walker, Glynn Hurst and Gary Teale.
