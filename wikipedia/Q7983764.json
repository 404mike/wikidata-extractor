Before the 2010 General Election, the NUS invited candidates sign a pledge not to raise tuition fees, receiving over 1000 signatories from prospective parliamentary candidates. This became a very high-profile campaign when many Liberal Democrat MPs, who all signed individual NUS pledges stating they would vote against any rise in tuition fees if elected, had to abstain or do the opposite as part of their coalition agreement.", "The subsequent cancellation of the debate by Durham Union Society President Anna Birley on safety grounds was met with fierce backlash. NUS President Wes Streeting was prompted to personally appear before the Durham Union Society to apologise for the actions of the officers concerned, though outrage among Durham students was sufficient that a significant number protested outside the debating chamber at the time. A protest group on Facebook quickly amassed over 2,500 members. An official petition was lodged with Durham Students' Union to call for a referendum on disaffiliation from NUS. On 12 March 2010, the referendum concluded with a majority of voting students choosing to disaffiliate."]}, {"page": "Morning Star (British newspaper)", "response": ["In December 2016, the newspaper was criticised by Labour MPs led by John Woodcock (\"one of the fiercest critics of British government inaction over aid to the region\", according to The Huffington Post) for its description of the imminent fall of Aleppo to Syrian government forces in a front-page headline as a \"liberation\". Labour MP Tom Blenkinsop tweeted: \"Hard left joining with far right in welcoming dictators \"liberating\" Aleppo. Absolute disgrace\". Other Labour MPs joining in the criticism were Stephen Doughty, Angela Smith, Ian Austin, Mike Gapes, Jess Phillips, Toby Perkins and Wes Streeting. Conservative MP George Osborne and Guardian writer Owen Jones also attacked the paper's headline. However, the paper rejected the criticism, stating that \"from a purely technical point of view, when a sovereign government reclaims territory previously held by enemy forces, that\u2019s called \"liberation\" whether we like the outcome or not\". Stop the War Coalition convener Lindsey German, and political commentator Peter Oborne defended the Star reporting of the issue, and questioned the dominant media narrative, respectively. Jeremy Corbyn said he \"disagreed\" with the headline, emphasising that he always advocated a ceasefire and \"a political settlement in Syria\". However, he refused to say he would never buy or read the paper again, saying; \"Listen, I buy lots of newspapers. I frequently disagree profoundly with headlines, even in The Guardian, the Telegraph, the Mail, and so on. Does it mean I won\u2019t buy them, or read them?
