His children's television credits include playing the Abominable No Man in Timmy Mallett's Timmy Towers and presenting Beat the Cyborgs, Name That Toon, On Your Marks, Insides Out, and History Busters, the last of which won a Royal Television Society Award.

Speight told police that he and Collins had spent the previous evening \"partying\", drinking wine and vodka, and taking cocaine and sleeping pills. Speight was questioned by police and was subsequently arrested on suspicion of murder and of supplying Class A drugs, but was released on bail until the first week of February. Because of this, the BBC cancelled the Saturday repeat edition of SMart. An inquest, which opened on 8 January 2008, heard that the death was not thought to be suspicious but should be \"subject to further investigation\". At that point, police were awaiting results of toxicology tests after a postmortem examination was inconclusive. The BBC cancelled repeat broadcasts of SMart and SMarteenies until further notice, and on 28 February Speight announced he was quitting the show, because the \"tragic loss\" of Collins had left him unable to continue. Speight denied any involvement with Collins's death, and on 19 March it was reported that the police were no longer considering him a suspect.", "Speight planned to meet with Collins's mother at Covent Garden for coffee on the afternoon of 7 April. He was dropped off at Wood Green tube station that morning, but never appeared at the planned meeting. Speight missed an appointment with a counsellor, but this was because of confusion over dates. Two police officers spoke to him, as he appeared \"vacant\", \"distracted\" and \"deep in thought\", but he refused their help. He was captured on CCTV in the afternoon taking money from a cash machine at Queen's Park station, and he subsequently boarded a southbound Bakerloo line train. He was reported missing the following day by family and friends, and his mother and the mother of Natasha Collins made a public appeal in which they urged him to make contact. Speight's father also appealed for him to get in touch."]}, {"page": "July 1976", "response": ["**Natasha Collins, English actress whose career was ended by a 2001 auto accident; in Luton, Bedfordshire (d. of drug overdose, 2008)"]}, {"page": "1976 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 7 July \u2013 Natasha Collins, actress and model (died 2008)"]}, {"page": "St Michael's Catholic Grammar School", "response": ["*Natasha Collins, children's TV presenter who died of drug overdose"]}, {"page": "2008 in British television", "response": ["|Natasha Collins"]}, {"page": "2008 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["** Natasha Collins, actress and model (overdose) (born 1976)"]}, {"page": "Deaths in January 2008", "response": ["*Natasha Collins, 31, British television presenter.
