He began playing in the Central Lancashire League at Werneth Cricket Club as a teenager in 1945, and made his first-class debut in 1946 against Sussex at Hove, scoring 2 not out and taking one wicket. He came into prominence at the age of 19 by dismissing Donald Bradman twice in Lancashire's match with the Australians in May 1948, making national newspaper headlines.Brightly Fades The Don \u2013 Jack Fingleton(1949) His first 10 wickets were Test batsmen, but Lancashire kept him from the front line up to the end of 1949, until the late Bill Roberts and Eric Price were no longer on the staff. He took 103 wickets for the Second Eleven in the Minor Counties Championship in 1949 and, in 1950, he gained a permanent place in the First Eleven taking 125 wickets for less than 17 runs apiece. He was called up for the final Test match against the West Indies but was not successful."]}, {"page": "1947 English cricket season", "response": ["Lancashire finished third for the second season in succession. They lost only once (to Somerset) but drew ten and tied one. They were well served by their openers Cyril Washbrook and Winston Place who both scored more than 2,000 runs in all first-class matches, Washbrook playing in all five Tests and Place being selected for the West Indies tour. There were problems in the middle order where only Geoff Edrich performed consistently well, but the two Test all-rounders, Jack Ikin and captain Ken Cranston scored over 1,000 runs. Lancashire's outstanding bowler was paceman Dick Pollard who finished the season strongly after an indifferent early phase and took 144 wickets in all matches. Slow left armer William Roberts bowled steadily and took 74 championship wickets but Playfair remarked that he was short of Test class. As with the batting, the all-rounders Cranston and Ikin shored up the bowling with 56 and 48 championship wickets respectively. Looking to the future, Lancashire made a \"find\" in wicketkeeper Alfred Barlow and there were good reports of Alan Wharton who became a Lancashire stalwart for many seasons. Batsman Barry Howard played some good innings in his debut season and, along with Cranston, was awarded his county cap. Other players included future county captain Nigel Howard, Tom Brierley, Phil King in his final season, future Test umpire Eddie Phillipson, Eric Price, and Gordon Garlick who joined Northamptonshire in 1948.Playfair, pp. 87\u201388."]}, {"page": "Eric Price", "response": ["Eric Price (born July 19, 1974) is an American actor and comedian who is most notable for his membership in the recurring cast of comedians on sketch comedy series MADtv during its 14th Season.
