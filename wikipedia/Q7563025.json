In her first match as captain\u2014against Surrey on 10 May 2009\u2014she scored a half-century, and shared a 128-run partnership with fellow opener Sophie Le Marchand, helping her side to a 21 run victory.  That score remained her best of the season, and in a rebuilding season for the county, she finished as the leading run-scorer, with 217.  She also finished the season as Somerset's most economical bowler, and her seven wickets meant that she trailed only Izzy Westbury among wicket-takers.  She continued to play for both England Academy and MCC Young Cricketers, and represented the academy in two Twenty20 matches against Pakistan prior to the 2009 ICC Women's World Twenty20.  She continued as captain in 2010, and in Somerset's opening fixture of the season, against Berkshire, she claimed her fourth List A four-wicket haul. She played her last match for Somerset in 2011 against Cheshire."]}, {"page": "List of Somerville College, Oxford, people", "response": ["*Sophie Le Marchand (1988), cricketer"]}, {"page": "2007 Super Fours", "response": ["*  Sophie Le Marchand (wk)"]}, {"page": "2008 Super Fours", "response": ["*  Sophie Le Marchand (wk) "]}]}}
