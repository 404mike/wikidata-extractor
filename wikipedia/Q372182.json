This is different from the aesthetic considerations of applied aesthetics used in the study of mathematical beauty. Aesthetic considerations such as symmetry and simplicity are used in areas of philosophy, such as ethics and theoretical physics and cosmology to define truth, outside of empirical considerations. Beauty and Truth have been argued to be nearly synonymous,Why Beauty Is Truth: The History of Symmetry, Ian Stewart, 2008 as reflected in the statement \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty\" in the poem \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\" by John Keats, or by the Hindu motto \"Satyam Shivam Sundaram\" (Satya (Truth) is Shiva (God), and Shiva is Sundaram (Beautiful)). The fact that judgments of beauty and judgments of truth both are influenced by processing fluency, which is the ease with which information can be processed, has been presented as an explanation for why beauty is sometimes equated with truth. Recent research found that people use beauty as an indication for truth in mathematical pattern tasks. However, scientists including the mathematician David Orrell and physicist Marcelo Gleiser have argued that the emphasis on aesthetic criteria such as symmetry is equally capable of leading scientists astray."]}, {"page": "Chaos theory", "response": ["* Ian Stewart, Does God Play Dice?: The Mathematics of Chaos , Blackwell Publishers, 1990."]}, {"page": "Cosmic microwave background", "response": ["* In Wheelers, a novel (2000) by Ian Stewart & Jack Cohen, CMBR is explained as the encrypted transmissions of an ancient civilization.

In 1734, he published The Analyst, subtitled A DISCOURSE Addressed to an Infidel Mathematician, a critique of calculus. Florian Cajori called this treatise \"the most spectacular event of the century in the history of British mathematics.\" However, a recent study suggests that Berkeley misunderstood Leibnizian calculus. The mathematician in question is believed to have been either Edmond Halley, or Isaac Newton himself\u2014though if to the latter, then the discourse was posthumously addressed, as Newton died in 1727. The Analyst represented a direct attack on the foundations and principles of calculus and, in particular, the notion of fluxion or infinitesimal change, which Newton and Leibniz used to develop the calculus. In his critique, Berkeley coined the phrase \"ghosts of departed quantities\", familiar to students of calculus. Ian Stewart's book From Here to Infinity captures the gist of his criticism."]}, {"page": "Intuitionism", "response": ["*\"Analysis.\" Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. 2006.

His writing inspired, directly or indirectly, many who would go on to careers in mathematics, science, and other related endeavors.Hofstadter (2010):  Many of today's most influential mathematicians and physicists, magicians and philosophers, writers and computer scientists, owe their direction to Martin Gardner. They may not even be aware of how big a role he played in their development.Bhargava (2018): Eventually, when I was around 12 years old, through my puzzle explorations I of course also had the good fortune of discovering the works of Martin Gardner. They inspired me a huge amount, and gave me something far more enjoyable to do than go to math class! I also read other recreational mathematics and puzzle books, such as those of Raymond Smullyan, and all of these works definitely had a great influence on me as a playing and playful mathematician.Antonick (2014):  Martin Gardner was well known for inspiring generations of students to become professional mathematicians.Antonick (2014): \"Martin Gardner's column in Scientific American was one of the two things that, above all others, convinced me I wanted to be a mathematician.\"\u2013Ian StewartDemaine (2008) p. ix: Many of today's mathematicians entered this field through Gardner's influence.Crease (2018): \"As a columnist for Scientific American, Gardner inspired generations of physicists, mathematicians, philosophers, puzzle-makers, logicians, magicians and others, including me.\"", "Gardner set a new high standard for writing about mathematics.AMS Notices (2004): \"His crystalline prose, always enlightening, never pedantic, set a new standard for high quality mathematical popularization.\" \u2014Allyn Jackson.Lister (1995):  Martin Gardner's supreme achievement was his ability to communicate difficult and often profound subjects with a few deft, but human strokes of his pen.Mirsky (2010): \"His writing has been valued by generations of professional mathematicians.\"\u2013Ian StewartTeller (2014): \"Gardner writes with authority and ease.

In a 2004 interview he said, \"I go up to calculus, and beyond that I don't understand any of the papers that are being written. I consider that that was an advantage for the type of column I was doing because I had to understand what I was writing about, and that enabled me to write in such a way that an average reader could understand what I was saying.
