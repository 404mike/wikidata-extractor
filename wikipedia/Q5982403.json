An ardent socialist and a Zionist, he remained a backbencher throughout his four decades in the House of Commons. He was a member of National Executive Committee of the Labour Party in 1950\u201359 and 1960\u201378, and Chairman of the Labour Party in 1970\u20131971. He was also Chairman of the International Committee of the Labour Party in 1973\u201378, Vice-President of the Socialist International (1978\u20131983) and Honorary President (1983\u20131993).Mikardo was a Labour Member of Parliament for Reading 1945\u201350, Reading South 1950\u201355, Reading 1955\u201359, Poplar 1964\u201374, Bethnal Green and Bow 1974\u201383 and Bow and Poplar 1983\u201387. He was Chairman of the House of Commons Select Committee on Nationalised Industries, 1966\u201370. He issued many pamphlets, the most famous were Keep Left (1947) and Keeping Left with Dick Crossman, Michael Foot and Jo Richardson, 1950. He was also a Fabian essayist, a staunch friend of Israel, as well as friend and mentor to many in the Labour movement, where he made a great impact.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Michael Foot", "response": ["Before the Cold War began in the late 1940s, Foot favoured a 'third way' foreign policy for Europe (he was joint author with Richard Crossman and Ian Mikardo of the pamphlet Keep Left in 1947), but in the wake of the communist seizure of power in Hungary and Czechoslovakia he and Tribune took a strongly anti-communist position, eventually embracing NATO."]}, {"page": "Hugh Gaitskell", "response": ["Dalton (30 September 1952) thought the Morecambe Party Conference \"the worst \u2026 for bad temper and general hatred, since 1926\" whilst Michael Foot thought it \"rowdy, convulsive, vulgar, splenetic\". A series of left-wing motions were passed. Bevanites took over the constituency section of Labour's National Executive Committee (the \"NEC\"): Bevan, Barbara Castle, Tom Driberg, Ian Mikardo and Harold Wilson took the top five places with Crossman seventh. Veteran right-wingers such as Herbert Morrison and Hugh Dalton were voted off, with Jim Griffiths in sixth place the only member of the Old Guard to survive; Shinwell, who as Minister of Defence was seen as responsible for the rearmament programme, had been voted off the previous year.Campbell 2010, p219-21", "Gaitskell felt he had to follow the lead of the unions and pushed for Bevan's expulsion, telling Crossman (24 March) that Ian Mikardo was running a Bevanite organisation in the constituency parties to make Bevan leader. When Crossman interjected that Bevan \"was only half wanting\" to be leader, had not made any conspiracy against Attlee and was mainly concerned at voicing protests against Morrison and Gaitskell, the latter replied that \"there are extraordinary parallels between Nye and Adolf Hitler. They are demagogues of exactly the same sort \u2026 There are minor differences but what is striking is the resemblance\". Summoned to appear before an NEC sub-committee, Bevan refused to be \"cornered by Gaitskell\". In the event Gaitskell intervened only once at the meeting, asking Bevan to give a pledge that he would not attack the leader \u2013 Bevan refused as it was \"a trap\". Bevan's apology for his rebellion over the H-Bomb was accepted. Gaitskell described the result (2 April) as \"a stalemate \u2026 my own position is no doubt weaker\". Gaitskell thought the need to move against Bevan \"dirty work\" (April 1955)."]}, {"page": "Barbara Castle", "response": ["Less than a month after she left Westminster in 1979 she stood for and was elected to the European Parliament, writing in the Tribune that \"politics is not just about policies: it is about fighting for them in every available forum and at every opportunity.\" In 1982 she wrote in the New Statesman that Labour should abandon its opposition to British membership of the EEC and that the UK should fight its corner inside it.Barbara Castle, 'Let them throw us out', New Statesman (17 September 1982), pp. 10\u201311.

When the media were not present, his humour was equally caustic but more risqu\u00e9. The popular impressionist Mike Yarwood coined the catchphrase \"Silly Billy\", and incorporated it into his shows as a supposed \"Healey-ism\". Healey had never said it until that point, but he adopted it and used it frequently. Healey's direct speech made enemies. \"At a meeting of the PLP I accused Ian Mikardo of being 'out of his tiny Chinese mind' \u2013 a phrase of the comedienne Hermione Gingold, with which I thought everyone was familiar. On the contrary, when it leaked to the press, the Chinese Embassy took it as an insult to the People's Republic.\"Denis Healey. The Time of My Life, Penguin 1990, p. 444.

Three hundred of them went into the palace, 100 to lobby the MP for Stepney, Peter Shore, and 200 to lobby the MP for Poplar, Ian Mikardo. Shore and Mikardo were shouted down and some dockers kicked Mikardo. Lady Gaitskell shouted: \"You will have your remedy at the next election.\" The dockers replied: \"We won't forget.\" The organiser of the strike, Harry Pearman, headed a delegation to meet Powell and said after: \"I have just met Enoch Powell and it made me feel proud to be an Englishman. He told me that he felt that if this matter was swept under the rug he would lift the rug and do the same again. We are representatives of the working man.

The young Labour MP Richard Crossman, who had become an assistant editor of the magazine before the war, was Martin's chief lieutenant in this period, and the Statesman published Keep Left, the pamphlet written by Crossman, Michael Foot and Ian Mikardo, that most succinctly laid out the Labour left's proposals for a \"third force\" foreign policy rather than alliance with the United States."]}, {"page": "Jo Richardson", "response": ["Joining the Labour Party in 1945, Richardson began her political career as Ian Mikardo's secretary.
