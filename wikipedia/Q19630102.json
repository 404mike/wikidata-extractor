During the 1770s, smallpox killed at least 30% of the Northwestern Native Americans, killing tens of thousands.Smallpox, The Canadian EncyclopediaLange, Greg. (2003-01-23) Smallpox epidemic ravages Native Americans on the northwest coast of North America in the 1770s . Historyink.com. Retrieved on 2011-12-06. The smallpox epidemic of 1780\u20131782 brought devastation and drastic depopulation among the Plains Indians. This epidemic is a classic instance of European immunity and non-European vulnerability. It is probable that the Indians contracted the disease from the \u2018Snake Indians\u2019 on the Mississippi. From there it spread eastward and northward to the Saskatchewan River. According to David Thompson\u2019s account, the first to hear of the disease were fur traders from the Hudson\u2019s House on October 15, 1781. A week later, reports were made to William Walker and William Tomison, who were in charge of the Hudson and Cumberland Hudson\u2019s Bay Company posts. By February, the disease spread as far as the Basquia Tribe. Smallpox attacked whole tribes and left few survivors. E. E. Rich described the epidemic by saying that \u201cFamilies lay unburied in their tents while the few survivors fled, to spread the disease.\u201d After reading Tomison\u2019s journals, Houston and Houston calculated that, of the Indians who traded at the Hudson and Cumberland houses, 95% died of smallpox. Paul Hackett adds to the mortality numbers suggesting that perhaps up to one half to three quarters of the Ojibway situated west of the Grand Portage died from the disease. The Cree also suffered a casualty rate of approximately 75% with similar effects found in the Lowland Cree. By 1785 the Sioux Indians of the great plains had also been affected. Not only did smallpox devastate the Indian population, it did so in an unforgiving way. William Walker described the epidemic stating that \u201cthe Indians [are] all Dying by this Distemper \u2026 lying Dead about the Barren Ground like a rotten sheep, their Tents left standing & the Wild beast Devouring them.\u201d"]}, {"page": "John Peter Pruden", "response": ["Pruden's employment in the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company began in earnest in September 1791 when he arrived at York Factory by the Company's ship, Seahorse III, as a 13-year-old apprentice.

In 1785 William Tomison of the Hudson's Bay Company sent Mitchell Oman to build South Branch House at a ford later called Gardepuy's crossing. The two rival traders abandoned their posts and built new ones on the opposite side of the river 400 yards downstream. The explorer David Thompson was one of Oman's clerks here in 1786/87."]}, {"page": "Fort Sturgeon", "response": ["About 1775 a group of \"Pedlars\" (independent traders from Montreal) were downriver near the old Fort de la Corne.  Seeing the disadvantages of competition they formed a pool (in either 1775 or 1776) which by 1779 became the North West Company. Among them were Joseph Frobisher, Peter Pond, Peter Pangman, Nicholas Montour, William Bruce and Bartholomew Blondeau. In 1776 they moved upriver and built Fort Sturgeon. In the spring of 1778 Peter Pond set off with 5 canoes and 20 men, crossed the Methye Portage for the first time and wintered 30 miles south of Lake Athabasca. He returned next year with excellent furs, thereby opening up the Athabasca Country. In 1778 Pangman and Blondeau built a fort upstream near Silver Grove, Saskatchewan. In 1779 William Tomison of the HBC came up from Cumberland House and traded while the Pedlars were away. The post had more Indian troubles than most and there were several killings on both sides. In 1777 three men from Fort Sturgeon were killed allegedly for maltreatment of the Indians. In 1780 Indians burnt the fort to the ground when the traders were away."]}, {"page": "Pine Island Fort", "response": ["In 1786 five independent groups established themselves on the island. First was Donald McKay, an independent trader. He was followed by Peter Pangman of Gregory, McLeod and Co., Robert Longmoor representing William Tomison of the Hudson's Bay Company, William Holmes of the North West Company and an independent Frenchman named Champagne. In the next season Donald McKay joined the HBC; Gregory, McLeod joined the NWC; and Champagne left the area. This left the HBC's Manchester House at the upper end of the island and the NWC's Pine Island Fort at the lower end. Here in 1788 the HBC built the first York boat used on the Saskatchewan. David Thompson broke his leg here in 1788. In 1792 Isaac Batt, a moderately well-known trader, went south with a group of Indians to hunt on the prairie and was murdered by them. In 1793 a large group of Gros Ventres entered the NWC post pretending to trade. When it became apparent that they intended to plunder the fort, a bold clerk took arms and drove them off. (The Gros Ventres and Mandans, who were at war with the Cree and the Plains tribes, thought that the traders were selling guns to the Cree.) In the same year Manchester House was plundered, and the traders escaped with only the clothes on their backs. In 1794 Duncan McGillivray of the NWC reported the houses in ruins. The island is not easily accessible, but in 1991 a memorial stone and plaque were erected on the river bank. As of September 2014, the plaque is still in place on top of high hill overlooking Pine Island."]}, {"page": "Asleep by the frozen sea", "response": ["The problem for the HBC was that they had always been coastal traders, their men had no woodland experience and the western Bay had no large birch trees to make proper canoes.  English goods were usually cheaper than those of the French, but buying from inland traders saved the Indians weeks of travel. Two of the most important advocates of inland expansion were James Isham  and later Andrew Graham. In 1743 Isham wrote to London advocating inland posts. In 1754 Anthony Henday went to Alberta. In 1756-64 Isham sent Joseph Smith on 5 journeys to the Swan River country. In 1758 Isham sent Isaac Batt inland from York Factory. Next year Batt returned leading 64 canoes of Indians. In 1760 the British capture of Montreal gave the HBC a brief monopoly. Frenchmen like Louis Primeau joined the HBC, and were important in transferring woodland skills to the company. For the period 1763-74 Morton counts 44 HBC journeys into the interior.Morton p. 272 Most of these travelled with so-called 'Leaders', that is, Indians who were accustomed to lead large groups of canoes down to the Bay trading posts. Before 1764 Isbester and John Patterson deserted the company, somehow got trade goods and were trading in the interior. In 1766 Andrew Graham sent 6 parties inland. By 1768 Isaac Batt was travelling inland yearly. In 1768 Ferdinand Jacobs proposed a fort at the mouth of the Saskatchewan. This was approved by London but not acted upon. In 1767 and 1769 Graham sent William Tomison to the Saskatchewan where he reported many Montreal traders.   By 1770 or a few years before the Montreal trade had been re-established by English-speaking \"Pedlars\" who were more aggressive than the French. In 1772 Isaac Batt and Louis Primeau were leading 160 canoes to the Bay when the Pedlars diverted 125 of them to their house on Cedar Lake. In 1772 John Cole deserted the \"Pedlars\" and advocated to Andrew Graham the construction of inland posts. In August 1772 Graham sent a memorandum to London advocating an inland post near The Pas.  In the same year he sent Mathew Cocking inland to the South Saskatchewan.  The London Committee approved inland posts on May 18, 1773. In 1774 Samuel Hearne established Cumberland House."]}]}}
