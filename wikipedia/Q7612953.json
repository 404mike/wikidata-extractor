It was Scunthorpe's first game at White Hart Lane, and despite the large separation in league position, the two sides were evenly matched in the first half. Gary Mabbutt opened the scoring for Tottenham on 19 minutes, before Steve Johnson equalised for the visitors four minutes later. With the cold wind at their backs, Tottenham began to control the game after half-time, opening up a 3\u20131 lead through Claesen and Chris Waddle goals. Ken DeMange made it 3\u20132 late in the game, and Scunthorpe had the chance to force a replay in the final minute through a Johnson header, but it was saved by Tottenham goalkeeper Ray Clemence. Tottenham's fourth-round match was more straightforward, as they beat Second Division Crystal Palace 4\u20130 at White Hart Lane. Mabbutt and a Gary O'Reilly own-goal made it 2\u20130 at half-time, before a Clive Allen penalty and Claesen goal sealed the game."]}, {"page": "Jimmy Allan (footballer, born 1953)", "response": ["His career was ended in October 1983 when his left arm was shattered during a challenge with Rochdale player Steve Johnson.

He made his debut as a substitute in the opening game of the 1988\u201389 season against Blackpool, with his first goal following a fortnight later against Bristol City. He ended the season with 24 goals to his name, with 22 of them coming in league matches as he struck up a successful forward partnership with Steve Johnson. The highlight was a hat-trick in a 7\u20130 demolition of Fulham in April 1989, with Dale comfortably finishing as the club's top scorer and player of the season."]}, {"page": "List of Wigan Athletic F.C. seasons", "response": ["|align=left| Steve JohnsonMike Newell"]}]}}
