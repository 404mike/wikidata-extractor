After Butler testified on 18 March, a member of the committee, Liberal MP Peter Rylands, stated: \"I am not accustomed to religious phraseology, but I cannot give you an idea of the effect produced except by saying that the spirit of God was there\". Nevertheless, the commission's report defended the one-sided nature of the legislation, saying \"...\u00a0there is no comparison to be made between prostitutes and the men who consort with them. With the one sex the offence is committed as a matter of gain; with the other it is an irregular indulgence of a natural impulse.\" The report accepted the findings that the sexual health of men in the 18 areas covered by the Acts had improved. In relation to the compulsory examinations, the commission was swayed by the descriptions of \"steel rape\", and suggested it should be voluntary not compulsory. The commission heard significant evidence that many prostitutes were as young as 12 and recommended that the age of consent should be raised from 12 to 14. Bruce took no action on the recommendations for six months."]}, {"page": "Burnley (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|rowspan=\"2\"| Peter Rylands"]}, {"page": "Dadie Rylands", "response": ["Rylands was born at the Down House, Tockington, Gloucestershire, to Thomas Kirkland Rylands, a land agent, and Bertha Nisbet Wolferstan (n\u00e9e Thomas).
