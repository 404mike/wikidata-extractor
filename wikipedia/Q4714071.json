According to Freud, Ipswich \"deserved to lose\" but the match ended 1\u20131 to send the tie to a replay, which took place the following Wednesday at Kenilworth Road.   After a goalless 90 minutes, the replay went into extra time during which both teams scored, Elsworthy for Ipswich and Luton through Dave Pacey, and the game ended 1\u20131 again to force a second replay.  The third clash between the clubs took place at Arsenal's home ground, Highbury, as a neutral venue.  Within fifteen minutes of kick off, Ipswich were 3\u20130 ahead through Moran and Phillips (2), playing with the wind in their favour.  Although Luton fought back and scored through Alec Ashworth, two late goals from Stephenson meant a 5\u20131 final score and finally saw Ipswich qualify for the fourth round.
