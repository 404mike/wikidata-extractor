After attending the elementary school he joined the Royal Flying Corps at the start of the First World War, transferring to the Royal Air Force in 1918. At the end of the war, he settled in Birmingham, where he became involved in the Cooperative movement.\nHis work in the Co-op included membership of the Co-operative Party. He was elected to Birmingham City Council from St Bartholomew's Ward in 1927 as a Labour and Co-operative member, and from 1935 he was Secretary of the Birmingham and District Co-operative Party. In 1945 he was nominated as an Alderman. When Labour won control of the City Council in 1946, Wheeldon was made Chairman of the Finance Committee.\nFollowing the death of Fred Longden, Wheeldon was elected as Labour Co-operative Member of Parliament (MP) for Birmingham Small Heath in a by-election in 1952. He specialised in local government, education, finance and housing, but was a low-profile MP. Unusually for the time, he was opposed to building tower blocks to ease the housing crisis, insisting that workers wanted to live on ground level with a bit of garden.\nHis health declined in 1958, and he fought the 1959 general election from a hospital bed, leaving it only on polling day to meet party workers. After a major operation in the summer of 1960 failed, Wheeldon died that October, aged 62.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Crewe", "response": ["*William Edwin Wheeldon (1898 in Crewe \u2013 1960) British co-operator HANSARD 1803\u20132005 \u2192 People (W) Mr William Wheeldon 1898-1960  retrieved December 2017 and municipal politician from Birmingham and MP"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1955 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| William Wheeldon"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1959 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| William Wheeldon"]}, {"page": "Back-to-back house", "response": ["By 1959, Leeds and Birmingham each had 60,000 back-to-back houses, and Members of Parliament were calling for the demolition to be accelerated.
