In April the administrators estimated that the club's total debts could top \u00a3134m which was largely dependent on the outcome of a First Tier Tax Tribunal concerning a disputed tax bill in relation to an Employee Benefit Trust (\"EBT\") scheme employed by the club since 2001. However, on 20 November 2012, the Tribunal ruled in favour of Rangers. Had that decision been upheld the tax bill could have been significantly reduced from an estimated \u00a374m to under \u00a32m.

Murray sold Rangers to Craig Whyte who has maintained a stance of blaming the previous regime led by Murray for the club's problems, particularly in relation to a potential heavy tax bill brought about by the use of Employee Benefit Trusts.

After the verdict, Murray expressed dismay at the damage caused to Rangers by the case before it had reached a decision, while also confirming a settlement of over \u00a310 million had been offered to HMRC two years previously. He also questioned HMRC's handling of his successor Craig Whyte's actions, who had stopped paying tax and national insurance at the club which eventually led to the liquidation of Rangers' previous holding company. In the wake of the tribunal verdict, Murray International Holdings called for a police enquiry into leaked information relating to the tax tribunal proceedings, leaks that resulted in a BBC documentary and an online blog making \"confidential information\" public.

Indeed, the latter indidcated that he would not co-operate with the proceedings, subsequently a warrant was issued for his arrest and charges against him were temporarily stopped.

Charges against Green were also dropped meaning that the former chief executive of the club was not facing any.

Rangers regained representation at a domestic football level as Managing director Stewart Robertson was appointed to the SFA professional game board, although Robertson had initially signalled his intent to stand for the SPFL board but withdrew due to a lack of support. Meanwhile, the former Rangers owner Craig Whyte was the only person facing fraud charges relating to the liquidation of The Rangers Football Club Plc, proceedings began in June. In a bizarre twist, former Rangers vice-chairman Donald Findlay QC was appointed to Whyte's legal team and defended Whyte when he faced charges relating to the acquisition of the club in May 2011 and its subsequent financial mismanagement. On 22 December, at his pre-trial Whyte entered a not guilty plea at the High Court in Glasgow.
