He spent most of his playing career with Bishop Auckland scoring for them in each of their FA Amateur Cup finals at Wembley in 1955, 1956 and 1957. He also won five English Amateur international caps, and represented Great Britain in the 1956 Melbourne Olympic Games.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Munich air disaster", "response": ["Meanwhile, there was speculation that the club would fold, but a threadbare United team completed the 1957\u201358 season, with Busby's assistant Jimmy Murphy standing in as manager; he had not travelled to Belgrade as he was in Cardiff managing the Welsh national team at the time. A team largely made up of reserve and youth team players beat Sheffield Wednesday 3\u20130 in the first match after the disaster. The programme for that match showed simply a blank space where each United player's name should have been. With seven players dead (Duncan Edwards died just over 24 hours later), and with only Harry Gregg and Bill Foulkes fit to play out of the surviving players, United were desperate to find replacements with experience, so Murphy signed Ernie Taylor from BlackpoolMorrin, p. 147. and Stan Crowther from Aston Villa.Morrin, p. 150. Three players, Derek Lewin, Bob Hardisty and Warren Bradley, were transferred to United on short-term contracts by non-League club Bishop Auckland. Bradley was the only one of the three players to play for the first team, and the only one to sign a permanent contract. The remaining places in the team were filled by reserve players including Shay Brennan and Mark Pearson.Marking club's 125-year history The Advertiser, 12 March 2012. In the aftermath of the crash, Manchester United's fierce rivals Liverpool offered United five loan players to help them put a side together."]}, {"page": "Bishop Auckland", "response": ["Bishop Auckland Football Club also helped out Manchester United after the Munich Air Crash in 1958 by donating three of their players, Derek Lewin, Bob Hardisty and Warren Bradley. In return in 1996, Manchester United played a friendly against Bishop Auckland to help raise money when the club was threatened with bankruptcy after a member of a rival team sued over an injury. In 2007 Manchester United donated floodlights to Bishop Auckland Football Club, which the club has added to their new ground, Heritage Park. These floodlights have subsequently been upgraded to LED."]}, {"page": "Bishop Auckland F.C.", "response": ["The Bishops team of this era contained many quality players that eventually found their way into the professional game.
