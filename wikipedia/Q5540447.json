She became a Senior Scientific Staff Member in 1952, and a Deputy Keeper in 1970. In 1955 she gained her DSc from the University of Edinburgh on the basis of sustained original, authoritative work on Mallophaga, much of it published in scientific journals.

Emerson, this work \"was a historical milestone in Mallophaga taxonomy."]}, {"page": "Colpocephalum", "response": ["Colpocephalum was circumscribed by Christian Ludwig Nitzsch in 1818. Nitzsch classified this taxon as a subgenus of the genus Liotheum. He included four species, which in his taxonomy were called L. (C.) zebra, L. (C.) flavescens, L. (C.) subaequale, and L. (C.) ochraceum. The first three species were nomina nuda; only the last was accompanied with an indication to a previously-published illustration, namely a 17th-century illustration by Francesco Redi. He wrote the indication as \"Pulex avis pluvialis Redi exp. fig. sup.\" In order to keep this name valid, Theresa Clay and George Henry Evans Hopkins restricted Carl Linnaeus's 1758 name Pediculus charadrii to only the bottom figure of Redi's plate. Strictly applying the ICZN Code, the type species should have been Liotheum (Colpocephalum) ochraceum, as it was the only available name included in the original circumscription."]}]}}
