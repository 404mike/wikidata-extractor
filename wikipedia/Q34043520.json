In his first event, Licon won the 200-yard individual medley, tying University of Florida\u2019s Mark Szaranek for top of the podium at 1:40.67. Later that same night, Licon joined Shebat, Schooling, and Conger in the 4\u00d7100-yard medley relay one last time to crush their previous NCAA and U.S. Open record with a sensational time of 2:59.22, accompanied by a blazing 49.75 breaststroke split from Licon. That swim marked the first time in history that any team had cracked the 3-minute barrier in the 4\u00d7100-yard medley relay, and Licon's 49.75 split was only the second time in history that a swimmer had cracked the 50-second barrier on a rolling start."]}]}}
