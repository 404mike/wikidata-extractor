He started his career as a junior high jumper and decathlete, but focused entirely on hurdling after a shoulder injury. He made his international debut for Great Britain at the 2006 European Athletics Championships and went on to compete at the 2007 Summer Universiade. Sharman came to prominence in 2009, after he significantly improved upon his previous personal best and finished fourth in the 110 metres hurdles final at the 2009 World Championships. This would be the first of three consecutive appearances in the World Championship final, he's since finished fifth in both the 2011 and 2013 finals.\nInitially coached by John Anderson, he was a timekeeper for the UK television series Gladiators. He is also a classically trained pianist and holds two university degrees.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2010 Commonwealth Games", "response": ["|William Sharman"]}, {"page": "Sharman", "response": ["* William Sharman (born 1984), British international sprint hurdler", "* William Sharman Crawford (1781\u20131861), Irish politician"]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 2006 European Athletics Championships", "response": ["110 m Hurdles: William Sharman, Andrew Turner"]}, {"page": "William Sharman Crawford", "response": ["William Sharman Crawford (1780\u20131861) was an Irish landowner who, in the Parliament of the United Kingdom, championed a democratic franchise, a devolved legislature for Ireland, and the interests of the Irish tenant farmer.
