A talented wing, Catcheside's debut in the 1924 Five Nations Championship, resulted in a record when he became the first England player to scores a try in each of the four matches. 1924 also saw Bill Wallace become Percy Parks first and only player to represent the British Lions directly from the club. Although selected at county level for Northumerland Wallace never represented England, though by playing in the First Test against South Africa on the 1924 tour, he became a capped Lion. Following the Second World War the club was financially stable and so in 1949 they purchased their ground for the sum of \u00a33,000. Amongst the tributes was a memorial tablet, unveiled in memory of those players who had died in the conflict."]}]}}
