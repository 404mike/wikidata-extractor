As a result of this mounting public disquiet, the execution was postponed for one week while Matthews and the trial judge, Mr Justice Stephen, met to consider a reprieve. While they were meeting, however, Lipski broke down and made a full confession to the East End rabbi and community spokesman Simeon Singer, claiming that his motive had been robbery and not, as had been claimed by the prosecution, rape.
