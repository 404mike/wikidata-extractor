Baird Jr., Professor of Science in the Department of Economics and the Department of Statistics at Harvard University.  He is Head of the Department of Statistics at Harvard.  \nHis most well known contributions are: (i) the formalisation of the econometrics of realised volatility, which nonparametrically estimates the volatility of asset prices, (ii) the introduction of the auxiliary particle filter (signal extraction), (iii) the nonparametric identification of jumps in financial economics, through multipower variation, (iv) stochastic volatility models based on non-Gaussian Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes, known as 'Barndorff-Nielsen-Shephard' models.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gillian Shephard", "response": ["The daughter of Reginald and Bertha Watts, she was born in Cromer, Norfolk, and spent her early years in Mundesley on Sea, her father being a haulier with a small garage. She was educated at North Walsham Girls' High School and St Hilda's College, Oxford, from which she gained an MA in Modern Languages. She became a schoolteacher and then worked as an Education Inspector for Norfolk County Council from 1963 to 1975. From 1975 to 1977 she worked for Anglia Television. She was elected to Parliament in 1987, and became Parliamentary Private Secretary to Peter Lilley in 1988. She was appointed Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Department of Social Security in 1989, and then in 1990, Minister of State at HM Treasury. In 1990 she was given the additional role of Deputy Chairman of the Party. She married Thomas Shephard on 27 December 1975 and has two stepsons.

Another main contribution is his work on asymptotic methods in statistics, not least his formula for the conditional distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator given an ancillary statistic that generalizes a formula by Ronald A. Fisher (originally called the p^*-formula, but now known as the Barndorff-Nielsen formula). He has jointly with David Cox written two influential books on asymptotic techniques in statistics. Since the mid-90s Barndorff-Nielsen has worked on stochastic models in finance (often with Neil Shephard) and turbulence, on statistical methods for the analysis of data from experiments in quantum physics, and has contributed to the theory of L\u00e9vy processes."]}, {"page": "Guy Medal", "response": ["* 2017 Neil Shephard"]}, {"page": "King Edward VII Academy", "response": ["The infamous 18th century murderer Eugene Aram was an usher (teacher) at the school, and was arrested there in the staff room.
