He personally explored and photographed all the routes he describes in his famous mountain guides, so that users can be assured of correct directions. His guides were based on earlier books covering most of the mountainous regions of Britain, but exclude routes on less popular mountains such as the Berwyns in north Wales, and are restricted in areas such as the Black Mountains and Brecon Beacons. He was an accomplished and skilled photographer. He joined the Royal Photographic Society in 1940, achieving Associateship in 1941 and Fellowship (FRPS). He was awarded Honorary Fellowship in 1975.\nHe was also a leading researcher who specialised on the chemistry of perfumes, cosmetics and soaps.", "link_mentions": []}}
