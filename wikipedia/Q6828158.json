In 1979 he invented online shopping to enable online transaction processing between consumers and businesses,  or between one business and another, a technique known later as e-commerce.  In 1980 he invented the Teleputer, a multi-purpose home infotainment centre that was a fusion of PC, TV and Telecom networking technologies. In 1981 he developed the concept of interactive broadband local loop cable TV for mass market consumer telecommunications.\nAldrich had a 38-year career in the IT industry, 20 years of which were spent as CEO of an international computer company, Redifon/Rediffusion/ROCC Computers. He retired as CEO in 2000 and became non-executive chairman (2000-2014). He also worked for Honeywell (now Groupe Bull) and Burroughs Corporation (now Unisys).\nAside from his inventions and innovations, he is known for his pro bono public service. He was an IT adviser to British prime minister Margaret Thatcher 1981-86, IT adviser to the Confederation of British Industry January 1982-December 1983, president of the Institute of Information Scientists 1984-85, and chairman of the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations 1989-99. He has had a long, formal association with the University of Brighton in various capacities since 1982.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "E-commerce", "response": ["* 1979: Michael Aldrich demonstrates the first online shopping system."]}, {"page": "1970s", "response": ["* e-commerce, invented in 1979 by Michael Aldrich"]}, {"page": "Videotex", "response": ["Using a prototype domestic television equipped with the Prestel chip set, Michael Aldrich of Redifon Computers Ltd demonstrated a real-time transaction processing in 1979 or online shopping as it is now called.'Videotex takes Gateshead Teleshopping into the home' 'The Incorporated Engineer' Journal of the IEEIE London September 1984, p. 6.

Even in videotex networks where third-party companies could post their own content and operate special services like forums, a single company usually owned and operated the underlying communications network, developed and deployed the necessary hardware and software, and billed both content providers and users for access. The exception was the transaction processing videotex system developed in the UK by Michael Aldrich in 1979, which brought teleshopping (or online shopping as it was later called) into prominence and was the idea developed later through the Internet. Aldrich's systems were based on minicomputers that could communicate with multiple mainframes. Many systems were installed in the UK including the world's first supermarket teleshopping system.", "* Michael Aldrich (1982), Videotex: Key to the Wired City, London: Quiller Press.

While very popular, admags were banned in 1963. The word \"teleshopping\" was coined in 1979 by Michael Aldrich, who invented real-time transaction processing from a domestic television and subsequently installed many systems throughout the UK in the 1980s. This would now be referred to as online shopping. In the 1989, the Satellite Shop was launched as the first UK shopping channel. Shortly afterwards, infomercials began on satellite television, and they became known as teleshopping. Until 2009, the UK permitted neither paid infomercials nor teleshopping on broadcast television. However, in 2009, Ofcom allowed up to three hours of infomercials per day on any channel."]}, {"page": "Rediffusion", "response": ["Redifon (later Rediffusion) Computers was also part of the group and was based in Crawley, West Sussex.
