The Knossos tablets had been found at various locations in the palace. Evans had not kept exact records. Recourse was had to the day books of Evans' assistant, Duncan Mackenzie, who had conducted the day-to-day excavations. There were discrepancies between the notes in the day books and Evans' excavation reports. Moreover, the two men had disagreed over the location and strata of the tablets. The results of the reinvestigation were eventually published by Palmer and Boardman, On the Knossos Tablets. It contains two works, Leonard Robert Palmer's The Find-Places of the Knossos Tablets and John Boardman's The Date of the Knossos Tablets, representing Blegen's and Evans' views respectively. Consequently, the dispute was known for a time as \"the Palmer\u2013Boardman dispute\". There has been no generally accepted resolution to it yet."]}, {"page": "Arthur Evans", "response": ["Assisted by Duncan Mackenzie, who had already distinguished himself by his excavations on the island of Melos, and Mr Fyfe, an architect from the British School at Athens, Evans employed a large staff of local labourers as excavators, and began work in 1900. Within a few months they had uncovered a substantial portion of what he called the Palace of Minos. The term \"palace\" may be misleading; Knossos was an intricate collection of over 1000 interlocking rooms, some of which served as artisans' workrooms and food processing centres (e.g. wine presses). It served as a central storage point, and a religious and administrative centre."]}, {"page": "Archaeology of Israel", "response": ["The British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem began operating in 1921, after R. A. Stewart Macalister and Duncan Mackenzie of the Palestine Exploration Fund appealed to the British government for the establishment of a local antiquities authority. Macalister and Mackenzie expressed concern over the dangers posed to archaeological sites on account of the battles being fought throughout the land. Mackenzie was also wary of fellahin raiding archaeological sites and stealing artifacts."]}, {"page": "British School at Athens", "response": ["Answers to these questions were provided by the judgements of the lead excavators, but with no method of establishing provenience, these judgements were often highly controversial.  For example, there are striking similarities between some Minoan and some Mycenaean pottery. Arthur Evans, Duncan Mackenzie and their supporters were proposing that Mycenaean pottery was a type of Minoan pottery. To the contrary, Carl Blegen and his supporters were affirming a mainland Greek origin for and importation to Crete of Mycenaean pottery. Given some of this pottery at a site, which was it, Minoan or Mycenaean, and how could one establish which?"]}, {"page": "Dr. Duncan Mackenzie", "response": ["#REDIRECT Duncan Mackenzie"]}, {"page": "Palestine Exploration Fund", "response": ["*Excavation at Beth-Shemesh (1911); led by Duncan Mackenzie.", "Also at the PEF is an archive of maps that is composed mainly of documents, letters, reports, plans and maps compiled by the explorers and scholars who worked for the PEF. These explorers include Charles Warren in Jerusalem and Palestine (1867\u20131870), Claude Conder and Horatio Kitchener on the Survey of Western Palestine (1872\u20131878), the Survey of Eastern Palestine (1880\u201381) and the Wady Arabah (1883-4), the excavations of Flinders Petrie and Frederick Jones Bliss at Tell el Hesi (1890-1892), the excavations of R.A.S.

Hilda White was invited also and became his constant companion. Unknown to Pendlebury, a close connection had always existed between the British School and Sir Arthur Evans. Evans apparently heard of Pendlebury's activities in Crete and Macedonia. Later in the year, in more propitious weather, Pendlebury was invited to stay at the Villa Ariadne with Evans and Duncan Mackenzie. Hilda White stayed in Heraklion. She reported that Mackenzie confided to Pendlebury in having \"my own idea,\" which he did not tell to Evans."]}, {"page": "Thomas Ashby", "response": ["Trying to make the British School at Rome a focus for archaeological research in the western Mediterranean, Ashby appointed as associate student of the BSR Duncan Mackenzie, who had just worked with Arthur Evans at Knossos.  Ashby and Mackenzie presented a joint paper on the ethnology of Sardinia to the British Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in York in summer 1906 (after a joint trip there that June).  This research area at the BSR dried up in 1909 when Mackenzie returned to work for the Palestine Exploration Fund in the eastern Mediterranean, though Ashby did make a return trip to Sardinia in 1912. Turning his attention to the British islands of Malta and Gozo and their possibilities for research on Mediterranean prehistory, and joined by T. Eric Peet for the 1905\u20136 session, Ashby visited Malta alone on various occasions in 1908 and 1909 and returned with Peet to excavate the sites of Hagiar-Kim and Mnaidra in 1910 and 1911."]}, {"page": "List of Foreign Archaeological Institutes in Greece", "response": ["Law 3028 represents an ideal, but it must be applied to real people in specific circumstances. The numerous books on the topic recount many exceptions in actual practice, which must be cleared by the archaeological councils; for example, foreign archaeologists may be asked to help with rescue archaeology, or the schools may be asked to provide resources to the Hellenic Archaeological Service. Also, many of the personnel of the earlier schools found themselves entangled in historical events, typically not as members of the schools, but because they had intimate knowledge of the society and its history. The schools are not per se political. David George Hogarth, for example, a Director for a term of the British School, was an intelligence officer in the British Navy. The school had no use for him in that capacity. Along with Arthur Evans and Duncan Mackenzie, he worked very hard at archaeology in Phylakopi and Crete. John Pendlebury, Curator of the museum at Knossos, gave his life for Greece in the Battle of Crete in 1941, but not in any capacity as Curator or member of the school. He had returned home, only to be recruited into the British Army and sent back to Crete to work as an operative because of his knowledge of the locality and the people. He was caught and shot there by German paratroopers."]}, {"page": "Duncan McKenzie (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Duncan Mackenzie (1861\u20131934), Scottish archaeologist"]}, {"page": "Mackenzie (surname)", "response": ["*Duncan Mackenzie, British archaeologist"]}, {"page": "Knossos (modern history)", "response": ["Evans' first step after paying for the estate was to restore the former Turkish owner's house as a storeroom, but as it turned out, the repairs were incomplete. A leaking roof was to cause irreplaceable losses of the initial tablets. He and Hogarth lived in Heraklion. After they disagreed on the management of the future excavation, Hogarth suggested that Duncan Mackenzie, who had become notorious after his excavations on the island of Melos, be employed as superintendent. Duncan had excavated Phylakopi expertly, 1896\u20131899, but escaped with the excavation notes, leaving large, unpaid bills, ostensibly to do independent research. Evans cabled him in Rome. He arrived in a week. He was to prove a site superintendent of great capability, but always under Evans' management. Unlike Evans' imaginative guesses, his accounts were sparse and prosaic. Evans also hired, at Hogarth's recommendation, an architect at the beginning of his career, then at the British School at Athens, David Theodore Fyfe. For a foreman Hogarth gave him his own foreman, Gregorios Antoniou, informally Greg\u00f3ri, a \"grave robber and looter of antiquities,\" who, trusted in a responsible post, proved fanatically loyal.. Having helped to get Evans started, Hogarth gracefully departed to excavate the cave at Lasithi, Crete."]}]}}
