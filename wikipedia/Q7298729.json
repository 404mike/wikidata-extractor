During his life he wrote for virtually every major English language film publication. In 1965 he published the first major critical essay on Michael Powell, who had hitherto been \"fashionably dismissed by critics as a 'technician\u2019s director'\", as Durgnat put it.\nHis many books include Films and Feelings (1967), A Mirror for England: British Movies from Austerity to Affluence (1970), and The Strange Case of Alfred Hitchcock (1974). He wrote principally for Films and Filming (in the 1960s), Film Comment (in the 1970s) and Monthly Film Bulletin (in the 1980s), and taught at various art schools and universities, notably St Martin's College and the Royal College of Art, where his students included Tony Scott. Towards the end of his life he was visiting professor at the University of East London.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alfred Hitchcock", "response": ["Hitchcock's film production career evolved from small-scale silent films to financially significant sound films. Hitchcock remarked that he was influenced by early filmmakers George M\u00e9li\u00e8s, D.W. Griffith and Alice Guy-Blach\u00e9. His silent films between 1925 and 1929 were in the crime and suspense genres, but also included melodramas and comedies. Whilst visual storytelling was pertinent during the silent era, even after the arrival of sound, Hitchcock still relied on visuals in cinema; Hitchcock referred to this emphasis on visual storytelling as \"pure cinema\". In Britain, he honed his craft so that by the time he moved to Hollywood, the director had perfected his style and camera techniques. Hitchcock later said that his British work was the \"sensation of cinema\", whereas the American phase was when his \"ideas were fertilised\". Scholar Robin Wood writes that the director's first two films, The Pleasure Garden and The Mountain Eagle, were influenced by German Expressionism. Afterward, he discovered Soviet cinema, and Sergei Eisenstein's and Vsevolod Pudovkin's theories of montage. 1926's The Lodger was inspired by both German and Soviet aesthetics, styles which solidified the rest of his career. Although Hitchcock's work in the 1920s found some success, several British reviewers criticised Hitchcock's films for being unoriginal and conceited. Raymond Durgnat opined that Hitchcock's films were carefully and intelligently constructed, but thought they can be shallow and rarely present a \"coherent worldview\"."]}, {"page": "King Vidor", "response": ["Despite producer Louis B. Mayer's personal enthusiasm for the picture, his studio deleted 30-minutes from the movie, mostly essential human interest sequences and only preserving the abundant documentary scenes. Disgusted by M-G-M's mutilations, Vidor terminated his 20-year association with the studio.Baxter. 1976 p. 66-67: Baxter lists the family scenes deleted that retained \"would have made it less of a stylized spectacular.\"Durgnat and Simmons, 1988: p. 175: \"MGM cut 30 minutes after its release\" and Vidor quit MGM \"deeply discouraged.\"And p. 6: A \"permanent rupture\" with MGM. See p. 6 and p. 221 for Louis B. Mayer's \"gushing\" remark to Vidor that it was \"the greatest picture our company ever made\" And p. 232: On mutilation of the film \"half-chopped lap-dissolves\" made in \"haste\". The film received negative reviews and was a financial failure. Some critics noted a shift in Vidor's focus from working class struggles to celebrating the ascent of a \"Ford-like\" industrial magnate. Film historian Raymond Durgnat considers the picture \"his least personal, artistically weakest and most spiritually confused.\"Durgnat and Simmons, 1988: p. 6: for quote. And p. 232: \"The critical reaction to the film was overwhelmingly negative.\"Higham, 1972: \"Disappointed in the film, many critics noted that Vidor was now celebrating the individualist against the masses in his central figure of a Ford-like tycoon.\"Callahan, 2007: \"American Romance is one of those broken films that gropes compellingly for ultimate answers. It remains Vidor's most concentrated attempt at dramatizing the galvanizing power that leads a man to work and get ahead.\"", "Film historian Raymond Durgnat champions Ruby Gentry \"as a truly great American film...film noir imbued with new fervor\" that combines a radical social understanding with a Hollywood veneer and an intensely personal artistic statement. Vidor ranks Ruby Gentry among his most artistically gratifying works: \"I had complete freedom in shooting it, and Selznick, who could have had an influence on Jennifer Jones, didn't intervene. I think I succeeded in getting something out of Jennifer, something quite profound and subtle.\"Durgnat and Simmon, 1988 p. 295: \"...Vidor has called Ruby Gentry one of his favorite works\u2026\" And: \"In its anguished lyricism, Ruby Gentry marks the end of the line for the phase that began back in Duel in the Sun. The reasons for this sudden finale...are no doubt a mix of personal and professional...[in] any case, he would never again have such control over a studio production.\"Baxter, 1976 p. 78: \"...the wild and remarkable Ruby Gentry, Vidor's last great film.\" The swamp sequence where Ruby and her lover Boake hunt one another is \"perhaps the best sequence [Vidor] ever filmed.\"Baxter, 1976 p. 79 Ruby Gentry showcases the essential elements of Vidor's oeuvre depicting the extremes of passion inherent in humanity and nature. Vidor commented on these elements as follows:", "The death of Tyrone Powers was less a financial disaster and more a creative loss. Vidor was bereft of an actor who had grasped the complex nature of the Solomon figure, adding depth to Powers' performance. Brynner and Vidor were instantly at loggerheads when the leading man substituted a portrayal of an \"anguished monarch\" for an Israelite king who would \"dominate each situation without conflict.\" Vidor reported, \"it was an attitude that affected the depth of his performance and probably the integrity of the film.\"Durgnat and Simmon, 1988: p. 301: \"...ultimate nightmare\u2026\" And Vidor's \"fondness\" for the Powers film footage and Vidor's \"rare public dislike for  [a cast member] Brynner.\" And \"Vidor's complaints about Brynner's refusal to display vulnerability are borne out on film.\"Steinberg, TMC: \"The project's salvaging was not remembered fondly by either the director or his substitute lead. Vidor felt that Brynner's reading lacked the threads of self-doubt that Power brought to the role. \"Tyrone Power had understood the dualistic problem of the anguished king,\" the director recounted in Raymond Durgnat and Scott Simmon's King Vidor, American. Brynner, he continued, 'fought the idea of a troubled monarch and wanted to dominate each situation without conflict. It was an attitude that affected...the integrity of the film.'\"Baxter, 1976 p. 85: Baxter reports the same disparity between Power's and Brynner's understanding of the Solomon character as Vidor wished it to be performed.\""]}, {"page": "The General (1926 film)", "response": ["In 1963, Keaton said, \"I was more proud of that picture than any I ever made. Because I took an actual happening out of the...history books, and I told the story in detail too\". With changing tastes and a reevaluation of his works, later audiences and critics agree with him, and it is now considered a major classic of the silent era. David Robinson wrote, \"Every shot has the authenticity and the unassumingly correct composition of a Mathew Brady Civil War photograph.\" Raymond Durgnat wrote, \"Perhaps The General is the most beautiful [film], with its spare, grey photography, its eye for the racy, lunging lines of the great locomotives, with their prow-like cowcatchers, with its beautifully sustained movement.\"Wakeman. 1987. p. 528. Writing for Jacobin in 2015, Eileen Jones called the film a \"comic masterpiece\" which nevertheless promoted the Lost Cause of the Confederacy."]}, {"page": "Freaks (1932 film)", "response": ["Though widely considered a horror film, some critics, such as John Thomas and Raymond Durgnat, have noted that Freaks does not fully embody the genre. Thomas wrote in Film Quarterly that Freaks would \"disappoint no one but the mindless children who consume most horror films...\u00a0Certainly it is macabre...\u00a0But the point is that Freaks is not really a horror film at all, though it contains some horrifying sequences.\" Durgnat made a similar observation, writing that, like the films of Luis Bu\u00f1uel, its shock value \"mingles with moments which seem shallow, but by the end of the film one begins to catch their mood, a calm, cold combination of guignol and eerily matter-of-fact \"."]}, {"page": "Michael Powell", "response": ["The film did however meet with the rapturous approval of the young critics of Positif and Midi-Minuit Fantastique in France, and those of Motion in England, and in 1965 he was subject of a major positive revaluation by Raymond Durgnat in the auteurist magazine Movie, later included in Durgnat's influential book A Mirror for England."]}, {"page": "Luis Bu\u00f1uel", "response": ["In the mid-1950s, Bu\u00f1uel got the chance to work again in France on international co-productions.  The result was what critic Raymond Durgnat has called the director's \"revolutionary triptych\", in that each of the three films is \"openly, or by implication, a study in the morality and tactics of armed revolution against a right-wing dictatorship\".  The first, Cela s'appelle l'aurore (Franco-Italian, 1956) required Bu\u00f1uel and the \"pataphysical\" writer Jean Ferry to adapt a novel by Emmanuel Robl\u00e8s after the celebrated writer Jean Genet failed to deliver a script after having been paid in full.  The second film was La Mort en ce jardin (Franco-Mexican, 1956), which was adapted by Bu\u00f1uel and his frequent collaborator Luis Alcoriza from a novel by the Belgian writer Jos\u00e9-Andr\u00e9 Lacour.  The final part of the \"triptych\" was La Fi\u00e8vre Monte \u00e0 El Pao (Franco-Mexican, 1959), the last film of the popular French star G\u00e9rard Philipe, who died in the final stages of the production. At one point during the filming, Bu\u00f1uel asked Philipe, who was visibly dying of cancer, why the actor was making this film, and Philipe responded by asking the director the same question, to which both said they didn't know. Bu\u00f1uel was later to explain that he was so strapped for cash that he, \"took everything that was offered to me, as long as it wasn't humiliating\"."]}, {"page": "W. C.

Several critics, including Dennis Schwartz, noticed that the casting was typical of a John Ford western. Schwartz praised Andrews's performance, but wrote: \"Even though it is only one of Renoir's lesser films, thanks to the interference by Zanuck, it still was one of Fox's highest grossing films of 1941.
