He broke into the Celtic team in the late 1960s, as one of a generation of players who continued a highly successful era for the club.

Hay appeared in 27 international matches for Scotland, and was selected for their 1974 FIFA World Cup squad.\nAfter retiring as a player, Hay entered football management with Motherwell in 1981. He led them to a promotion in 1981\u201382, but left the club at the end of the season.
