Meg is a wealthy woman who, with the help of her late husband Charles' insurance money, and compensation money from the council for them building a motorway through their land, turned her large Georgian house into a motel. \"The Crossroads Motel\" was located on the outskirts of the small village of King's Oak, which is on the outskirts of Birmingham. With Charles, Meg had two children. The elder was a girl named Jill (Jane Rossington) (born 1946) followed by Alexander, or \"Sandy\" (Roger Tonge), in 1950. Kitty, on the other hand, is married to the unemployed Dick (Brian Kent) and is not wealthy. Dick and Kitty purchased a newsagents and tobacconists shop in the nearby town of Heathbury a few years after the show started. Kitty and Dick had a son called Brian (David Fennell), born in 1945. The idea of the sisters feuding was soon dropped. The character of Kitty was written out in 1969 after the death of actress Johnstone.", "Over the years the series dealt with storylines which were controversial for the times. A single parent working at the motel was hugely controversial in the mid-1960s; and Sandy Richardson was injured in a car accident in 1972 and needed to use a wheelchair. The storyline was developed when actor Roger Tonge had himself become a wheelchair user off screen as a way to keep him in the series, thus becoming the first paraplegic regular character portrayed in a British soap opera."]}, {"page": "Lodge Hill Cemetery", "response": ["*Roger Tonge (1946\u20131981), actor who played Sandy Richardson in the television soap opera Crossroads"]}, {"page": "Malcolm McFee", "response": ["Music journalist Simon Goddard has suggested that McFee is the subject of Morrissey's song \"Little Man, What Now?\" from his 1988 album Viva Hate, although previous opinions have suggested Jack Wild or Roger Tonge as the subject.
