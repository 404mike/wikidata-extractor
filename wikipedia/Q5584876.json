His time at Carrow Road was significant enough that in 2003, he was made an inaugural member of the Norwich City Hall of Fame.  After leaving Norwich, Bennett worked for Aberdeen F.C. and while working there he remarked, \"When you have a name like mine I am bound to be latched upon\".In 1969 Bennett won an ITV/Daily Mail-sponsored fan-of-the-year competition. By answering a series of questions on his beloved Bristol Rovers, Bennett earned a trip to the Mexico World Cup and a \u00a31,000 cheque. Personally, the prizes did not interest him. He gave the tickets away to the runner-up and presented the money as a gift to Rovers.  Bennett spent his early years at Ram Hill, Coalpit Heath, near Bristol and in his playing days Bennett played amateur football for Henfield Youth AFC.\nHe died on 17 September 2020.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gordon Bennett", "response": ["Gordon Bennett may refer to:", "* Gordon Bennett (artist) (1955\u20132014), Australian artist", "* Gordon Bennett (football) (died 2020), English football manager", "* Gordon Bennett (general) (1887\u20131962), Australian soldier", "* James Gordon Bennett Sr. (1795\u20131872), American editor and New York Herald founder", "** James Gordon Bennett Jr. (1841\u20131918), his son, American publisher and sportsman", "* Gordon Bennett (union organiser) (1944\u20131991), Christmas Island labor advocate", "* Gordon Bennett (comics), a British comic book character", "* Gordon Bennett (phrase), an English idiomatic phrase, after James Gordon Bennett Jr.", "* \"Gordon Bennett\", a song by Gilbert O'Sullivan from the 1989 album In the Key of G", "* Gordon Bennett Cup (disambiguation)", "* Gordon Bennetts (1909\u20131987), Australian cricketer"]}, {"page": "Darren Way", "response": ["Born in Plymouth, Devon, he was part of the Plymouth Argyle centre of excellence, before at the age of fourteen he chose to sign for Norwich City as an associate schoolboy, having been scouted by Gordon Bennett, whilst rejecting offers from Everton and Bristol City. Way spent the next two years travelling from Plymouth to Norwich, spending seven hours there and seven hours back on the train each weekend, along with future Wales international and Liverpool striker Craig Bellamy who he used to meet in Bristol. While progressing through the youth ranks at Norwich, Way played for the England schoolboys side on six occasions, alongside Steven Gerrard and Michael Owen. In May 1999, Way signed a one-year professional contract and sat on the bench for a number of first team matches. Having only made six appearances for the reserve side in the 1999\u20132000 season, in March 2000, Way was informed by Norwich manager Bryan Hamilton that he would be released at the end of the season. Following this Way had a trial with Second Division side Bristol Rovers playing a game for their reserve side. On 26 April 2000, he was released from his contract having not made an appearance for the Norwich first team."]}]}}
