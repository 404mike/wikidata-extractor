Some of the ascetic thoughts in Christianity nevertheless, Finn states, have roots in Greek moral thought. Virtuous living is not possible when an individual is craving bodily pleasures with desire and passion. Morality is not seen in the ancient theology as a balancing act between right and wrong, but a form of spiritual transformation, where the simple is sufficient, the bliss is within, the frugal is plenty."]}, {"page": "Blackfriars, Oxford", "response": ["* Richard Finn - former Regent and Novice Master for The English Province of The Order of Preachers  "]}, {"page": "St Catharine's College, Cambridge", "response": ["|Richard Finn"]}, {"page": "Finn (surname)", "response": ["* Richard Finn (born 1963), English priest, academic and theologian"]}, {"page": "Finn, Richard", "response": ["#redirectRichard Finn"]}]}}
