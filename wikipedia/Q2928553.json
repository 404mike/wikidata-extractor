Shortly after, a recount on the total deposits was carried out; initial estimates suggested that the recount would take a year to complete, and despite it having been done with the utmost care, the recount was finalized in less than two months, having begun on December 5, 1936, and completed on January 24, 1937. 15,571 sacks of gold were opened, and 16 different types of gold coins were found inside: pounds sterling (sovereigns or half sovereigns) (70% of the total), Spanish pesetas, French francs, Louis, German marks, Belgian francs, Italian lire, Portuguese escudos, Russian rubles, Austrian schillings, Dutch guilders, Swiss francs, Mexican pesos, Argentine pesos, Chilean pesos, and an extraordinary amount of U.S. dollars.Mart\u00edn Ace\u00f1a 2001, p.\u00a026 The total deposit was constituted of 509,287.183\u00a0kilograms of gold coins and 792.346\u00a0kilograms of gold in the form of ingots: thus, a total of 510,079,529.30\u00a0grams of crude gold, which at an average of .900 millesimal fineness, was equivalent to 460,568,245.59\u00a0grams of fine gold (approximately 14,807,363.8 troy ounces).Preston 2001, p.\u00a0270 This amount of gold was valued at 1,592,851,910 gold-pesetas (518 million U.S. dollars). Additionally, the numismatic value of the coins was much higher than the amount of gold they contained, but the Soviets disregarded this when calculating its value.Vi\u00f1as 1976, p.\u00a0210 The Soviets did, however, scrupulously examine all coins to identify those that were fake, defective, or did not contain enough gold. The Soviets never explained what was done with the rare or antique coins, but it is doubtful that they were melted. Burnett Bolloten suggests that it is possible that all coins with numismatic value were separated with the intention of gradually selling them on the international market.Bolloten 1989, p.\u00a0270\u20131"]}, {"page": "John Langdon-Davies", "response": ["Langdon-Davies expressed admiration for Anarchism in Spain.
