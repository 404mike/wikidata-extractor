He returned to the professional game at Third Division Walsall under Bill Moore. He was then signed by Harry Catterick's Everton, after impressing in an FA Cup clash between Everton and Walsall at Goodison Park on 5 February 1972. However, he only played eleven First Division games for the club, scoring two goals, before having his contract terminated for 'serious misconduct' after a training ground incident. He had punched coach Stewart Imlach after he had overlooked Wright for a first team spot. Though he only enjoyed an eleven-month stay with the club, he created an impression on the Everton fans, who remember him for using his head to accidentally break the toe of Sheffield United centre-back Eddie Colquhoun during an attempted diving header."]}, {"page": "Colquhoun", "response": ["* Eddie Colquhoun, Scottish international footballer"]}, {"page": "John Harris (footballer, born 1917)", "response": ["In the ensuing years, he made astute and highly effective signings with players such as Tony Currie, Alan Woodward, Len Badger, Geoff Salmons, Eddie Colquhoun, Bill Dearden and Gil Reece all signing for the Blades, and resulted in Sheffield United winning promotion from the Second Division in 1970\u201371.

By the end of the 1963\u201364 season he established himself as first choice at right-back, replacing club stalwart Cec Coldwell and remained a regular there until 1975. He was appointed captain in 1968 by manager John Harris. This made him the youngest league captain in United history, and one of the youngest skippers in the league at the time. He served as captain for two years before relinquishing the role to Eddie Colquhoun. Badger's left-back colleagues of the early and mid-sixties included Graham Shaw and Bernard Shaw, but it was the arrival of Ted Hemsley in 1968 that provided him with his most fruitful partnership which continued through one of United's most successful post war periods from 1969\u20131972."]}, {"page": "John Flynn (footballer, born 1948)", "response": ["Flynn was spotted playing in Workington's reserves by Sheffield United's then general-manager John Harris and the club duly signed him for \u00a35,000 in July 1969.

By April 1971 Flynn had cemented his position as first-choice in central defence, partnering Eddie Colquhoun. Flynn remained a mainstay of United's defence until 1978 when he was given a free transfer to nearby Rotherham United.
