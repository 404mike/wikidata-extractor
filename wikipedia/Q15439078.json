Born in Lower Mitton, Stourport in Worcestershire, by the age of 16 he was already an established musician. His career included a directorship of opera at the Royal Academy of Music where he was a professor of composition, a position as r\u00e9p\u00e9titeur at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, conductor for the British National Opera Company, military service as an officer in the Royal Flying Corps, and founder member and vice-president of the Elgar Society.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Edward Elgar", "response": ["Among Elgar's admirers there is disagreement about which of his works are to be regarded as masterpieces. The Enigma Variations are generally counted among them.Reed, p. 180; Kennedy (ODNB), McVeagh (Grove), Sackville-West, p. 254; and in a centenary symposium in 1957 a variety of composers, scholars and performers, include Enigma among their favourite Elgar works.

Many rate the Violin Concerto equally highly, but some do not. Sackville-West omitted it from the list of Elgar masterpieces in The Record Guide,Sackville West, p. 254 and in a long analytical article in The Musical Quarterly, Daniel Gregory Mason criticised the first movement of the concerto for a \"kind of sing-songiness\u00a0... as fatal to noble rhythm in music as it is in poetry.\"Mason, Daniel Gregory, \"A Study of Elgar\", The Musical Quarterly, April 1917, pp. 288\u2013303 Falstaff also divides opinion.

In the Netherlands the advocacy of Willem Mengelberg ensured that Mahler remained popular there, and Mengelberg's engagement with the New York Philharmonic from 1922 to 1928 brought Mahler regularly to American audiences.Carr, pp. 221\u201324 However, much American critical reaction in the 1920s was negative, despite a spirited effort by the young composer Aaron Copland to present Mahler as a progressive, 30\u00a0years ahead of his time and infinitely more inventive than Richard Strauss.Copland, pp. 149\u201350 Earlier, in 1916, Leopold Stokowski had given the American premieres of the Eighth Symphony and Das Lied von der Erde in Philadelphia. The Eighth was a sensationally successful performance that was immediately taken to New York where it scored a further triumph.Ander Smith, p. 91 An early proponent of Mahler's work in Britain was Adrian Boult, who as conductor of the City of Birmingham Orchestra performed the Fourth Symphony in 1926 and Das Lied von der Erde in 1930.Mitchell (The Mahler Companion), p. 557 The Hall\u00e9 Orchestra brought Das Lied and the Ninth Symphony to Manchester in 1931; Sir Henry Wood staged the Eighth in London in 1930, and again in 1938 when the young Benjamin Britten found the performance \"execrable\" but was nevertheless impressed by the music. British critics during this period largely treated Mahler with condescension and faint praise. Thus Dyneley Hussey, writing in 1934, thought the \"children's songs\" were delightful, but that the symphonies should be let go.Hussey, pp. 455\u201356 Composer-conductor Julius Harrison described Mahler's symphonies as \"interesting at times, but laboriously put together\" and as lacking creative spark.Harrison, p. 237 Bernard Shaw, in his role as music critic, thought that the musical audiences of the 1930s would find Mahler (and Bruckner) \"expensively second-rate.\"Shaw, p. 753"]}, {"page": "City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra", "response": ["Four conductors were shortlisted to succeed Boult and were given trial concerts \u2013 Leslie Heward, Stanley Chapple, Julius Harrison and Basil Cameron \u2013 but Boult later described how \"Heward very easily won the palm\".

He came to Birmingham from a highly successful period as Music Director of the South African Broadcasting Corporation and Conductor of the Cape Town Orchestra, where he had raised the standards of the orchestra's playing to the extent that they were invited to England perform at the Empire Exhibition in 1925.
