He spent much of his childhood moving around owing to his father's career as an Officer with the Royal Air Force. Poor eyesight prevented him from following a similar career in the RAF, so he instead planned to become a theatre director. Training at the Theatre of Arts in London, he started work as an actor, making his West End debut in 1974. He went on to appear in numerous roles in television, including the series I, Claudius and Jesus of Nazareth, before starring as Simon Doyle in the film Death on the Nile (1978). This proved to be a breakthrough role and allowed him to move to the United States. He appeared in a variety of films and TV series including Quatermass (1979), The Riddle of the Sands (1979), The Sword and the Sorcerer (1982) and Jaws 3-D (1983).\nIn 1983, MacCorkindale starred in the short-lived series Manimal as the lead character, Dr. Jonathan Chase, before taking up the longer-running role of lawyer Greg Reardon in Falcon Crest. Throughout the late 1980s and 1990s he directed and produced many stage, TV and film productions through his company Amy International Artists, such as the film Stealing Heaven (1988). Moving to Canada, he starred as Peter Sinclair in the series Counterstrike for three years. He returned to the United Kingdom in 2002 and joined the cast of the BBC medical drama Casualty, appearing in the role of Harry Harper for six years until 2008.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "February 12", "response": ["*1952 \u2013 Simon MacCorkindale, English actor, director, and producer (d. 2010)"]}, {"page": "October 14", "response": ["*2010 \u2013 Simon MacCorkindale, English actor, director, and producer (b. 1952)"]}, {"page": "The Sound of Music", "response": ["Connie Fisher was selected by public voting as the winner of the show.

MacCorkindale was delighted with the part of Joe Kapp, finding it a break from the typecast romantic roles he was used to playing. Following Quatermass, MacCorkindale appeared in The Riddle of the Sands (1979), and subsequently moved to the United States where, after playing a few guest roles on television, he secured a part in Jaws 3 (1983) and the lead in the short-lived series Manimal (1983). He was then a series regular in Falcon Crest (1984\u201386), Counterstrike (1990\u201393) and Poltergeist: The Legacy (1999). He then returned to the United Kingdom, where he played the character of Harry Harper in Casualty between 2002 and 2008. MacCorkindale died in 2010.", "Reflecting on the serial, Nigel Kneale said, \"Frankly, I was never happy with the whole idea in the first place. The central idea was too ordinary\". Although Kneale was pleased with the high production values, he was dissatisfied with the casting, believing that John Mills \"didn't have the authority for Quatermass\".Murray, Into the Unknown, p. 139. He was similarly unimpressed with Simon MacCorkindale, noting that \"We had him in Beasts playing an idiot and he was very good at that\". Kneale disliked the depiction of the Planet People, as his inspiration had been angry punks rather than hippies (as evidenced by his portrayal of Kickalong as a gun-toting lunatic who commits multiple motiveless murders). Producer Ted Childs thinks that \"the primary problems with it were (a) it was perhaps too depressing a story for a popular television audience and (b) the punters were used to a fairly high standard of technical presentation from American television... And we just couldn't afford that\".Alvarado & Stewart, Made for Television, p. 87.
