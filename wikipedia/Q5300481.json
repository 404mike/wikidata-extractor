After being rejected by both Celtic and Leeds United, following trials Fraser turned professional with Aberdeen. Fraser's form attracted the attentions of English clubs and in September 1963 West Bromwich Albion manager Jimmy Hagan paid \u00a323,000 for his signature. Making his debut against Birmingham City that same month, Fraser initially played in a number of defensive and midfield positions before making the right back slot his own. Fraser played in four cup finals during his time at The Hawthorns. His final Albion game was a 2\u20132 draw against Chelsea in November 1970 before manager Alan Ashman sold him to Nottingham Forest for \u00a335,000. He would later play for Walsall where he hit the headlines after he was red carded for fighting with Bristol Rovers' Kenny Stephens - a former Albion teammate.During his time with West Brom, Fraser made seven appearances for the Scotland national team. He made two appearances in 1968, against Cyprus and the Netherlands. The other five appearances were during a 1967 overseas tour that the Scottish Football Association decided in October 2021 to reclassify as full internationals, which increased Fraser's cap tally from two to seven. \n\nAfter his retirement from playing Fraser was appointed manager at Walsall, a position he held until 1977. Following this Fraser left football and took up a position as a prison guard at Nottingham Gaol.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bernie Wright", "response": ["Wright returned to Walsall in 1973 for a fee of \u00a310,000, and scored 38 goals in 152 league games during his four years at Fellows Park.

Any QPR attack stagnated once someone attempted to pass the ball through to Rodney Marsh or Les Allen, who were overwhelmed by the numbers of Albion defensive players. Albion's first goal came in the seventh minute as the ball was worked down the left hand side of the pitch by Tony Brown, Bobby Hope and finally Doug Fraser, before Clive Clark's shot went through a gap in QPR's defence. The Albion supporters began provocatively chanting \"easy\", although QPR were immediately on the attack with Albion goalkeeper Dick Sheppard saving a shot from Frank Sibley.Macey (2009): p. 187", "| MF ||6 ||\u00a0Doug Fraser"]}, {"page": "1968 FA Cup Final", "response": ["|RB ||2 || Doug Fraser"]}, {"page": "1970 Football League Cup Final", "response": ["|2 || Doug Fraser"]}, {"page": "1966 Football League Cup Final", "response": [" \u00a0Doug Fraser", "\u00a0\u00a0Doug Fraser"]}, {"page": "List of Walsall F.C. managers", "response": ["|align=left| Doug Fraser"]}]}}
