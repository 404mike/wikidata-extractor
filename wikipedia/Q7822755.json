West Bromwich Albion were starting to apply pressure early in the second half and Kevin Donovan came close to opening the scoring with a bicycle kick. Port Vale also had a 53rd-minute cross-cum-shot by Ian Taylor tipped over the bar by Tony Lange. Paul Musselwhite denied Donovan and Paul Raven after Bob Taylor exploited Port Vale defender Peter Swan's lack of pace. Swan fouled Taylor on 60 minutes and his subsequent dismissal proved to be the turning point in the match; it also meant that he became the third Englishman to be sent off at Wembley, after Kevin Keegan and Lee Dixon. Andy Hunt scored the game's opening goal on 66 minutes, and would make his loan spell from Newcastle United into a permanent transfer for a fee of \u00a3100,000 later in the week. Hunt had capitalised with a header from a goalmouth scramble when Gary Strodder's header was blocked by a combination of Musselwhite and the crossbar, and Taylor's cross was knocked on to Hunt by Nicky Reid. Reid scored his first goal for West Bromwich Albion with an  strike on 82 minutes after being assisted by Donovan, who countered a Port Vale attack by running past the halfway line. Reid repaid Donovan by setting him up for West Bromwich Albion's final goal from  on 90 minutes, with the game ending 3\u20130 to West Bromwich Albion.", "|GK ||1||Tony Lange"]}, {"page": "1992\u201393 Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. season", "response": ["|12 August 1992|| Tony Lange||align=\"center\"|West Bromwich Albion||align=\"center\"|Free"]}, {"page": "1987 Football League Fourth Division play-off Final", "response": ["|GK || 1 ||Tony Lange", "The referee for the second leg, played on 25 May 1987 at Molineux in Wolverhampton in front of a crowd of 19,962, was Keith Hackett.

In the ninth minute, Bull struck a shot high over the Aldershot crossbar and two minutes later, Barry Powell's strike from distance was tipped away by Tony Lange, the Aldershot goalkeeper.  Just before the hour mark, Thompson shot high and off-target before Lange made another save, this time from a strike which took a deflection off Jon Purdie.   With nine minutes of the match remaining, Barnes scored for Aldershot to give them a 1\u20130 win, and a 3\u20130 aggregate victory, securing promotion to the Third Division.
