He played nearly 200 games in the Football League for Crewe Alexandra and Birmingham City, and won three international caps for Northern Ireland. His father, James, had also been an international footballer.\nBorn in Newry, County Down, Ferris spent short trial spells at Irish League clubs Distillery and Glentoran before crossing to England where he signed amateur forms for Brentford. By the time the Second World War broke out he was playing non-league football for Cambridge Town and then moved to Linfield. During the war he made guest appearances for Tottenham Hotspur, West Ham United and former club Brentford.After the war he signed professionally for Crewe Alexandra, for whom he played over 100 times. He then moved to First Division club Birmingham City, for whom he also made over 100 appearances. He was a hard-working, hard-tackling type of half-back with great determination. In the closed season of 1953 he went on a representative tour with the IFA to the United States and Canada, where he sustained a leg injury that eventually ended his career. Though he played for Worcester City in the Southern League for one more season, he was forced to retire in 1954.\nFerris died in a Manchester nursing home in February 1994, aged 73. His legs had been amputated due to circulation problems.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1949\u201350 British Home Championship", "response": ["| MF ||align=\"left\"| Ray Ferris || 22 September 1920 || 1 || 0 || 90 || 0 || 0 ||bgcolor=red| 90 ||\u2013 ||\u2013 ||align=\"left\"|  Birmingham City"]}, {"page": "Brentford F.C.
