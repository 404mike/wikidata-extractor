His academic career was based at the University of Leicester, where he held the post of Professor of Plant taxonomy. He is a past president of the Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland.\nIn 2012 a newly described grass species, Brachypodium stacei (previously regarded as a form of purple false brome), was named in his honour.He has also been responsible for a number of notable publications relating to the vascular plant flora of Britain and Ireland:\n\nHybridization and the flora of the British Isles\nNew Flora of the British Isles\nVice-county Census Catalogue of the Vascular Plants of Great Britain\nAlien PlantsHe also wrote the student textbook Plant Taxonomy and Biosystematics.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Salix \u00d7 fragilis", "response": ["S.\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0fragilis is very variable, with forms linking both parents.

This would support the status of N. hurrelliana as a species since populations of this taxon appear to be stabilised and it is abundant where it does grow. Furthermore, it has never been found to be sympatric with either of its putative parent species. The hybrid may have locally outcompeted its parent species and eventually replaced them. Another possibility is that it was dispersed to new areas where neither of the parent species was established."]}, {"page": "Nepenthes murudensis", "response": ["Botanist Clive A.

This would tend to support the status of N. murudensis as a species, since populations of this taxon appear to be stabilised as well as highly homogeneous, and it is one of the most abundant Nepenthes on the summit ridge of Mount Murud.

It is as U. plotii Druce that the specimens held by the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew and Wakehurst Place are listed. R. H. Richens, however, contended (1983) that it is simply one of the more distinctive clones of the polymorphous Ulmus minor, conjecturing that it arose as an U. minor sport and that its incidence in the English Midlands may have been linked to its use as a distinctive marker along Drovers' roads.Max Coleman, ed.: Wych Elm (Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh publication, 2009; ); p. 22 After Richens had challenged the species hypothesis, the tree was the subject of a study at the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh by Dr Max Coleman (2000), which showed that trees a perfect fit with the 'type' material of Plot elm were of a single clone (genetically identical to each other). Arguing in a 2002 paper that there was no clear distinction between species and subspecies, and suggesting that known or suspected clones of U. minor, once cultivated and named, should be treated as cultivars, Coleman preferred the designation U. minor 'Plotii' to U. minor var. plotii, a form used in late 20th-century publications.Kemp, Eddie (1979). \"The Plantsman's Elm\", in Clouston, Brian; Stansfield, Kathy (eds.), After the Elm; London: Heinemann; p.32"]}, {"page": "Stace, Clive", "response": ["#redirectClive A.
