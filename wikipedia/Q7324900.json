He was educated by the Christian Brothers in the town. As a fitter in the Wexford Engineering foundry he was blacklisted by his employers after the 1911 Lockout, and became a trade union official in the new Irish Foundry Workers' Union.In 1913 he married Catherine Bergin and they had three children.\nRichard Corish became Mayor of Wexford in 1920 as an Irish Labour Party representative. However, as the Labour Party in the southern 26 counties, later the Irish Free State, chose not to contest the 1921 elections, Corish ran as a Sinn F\u00e9in candidate and was elected to D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann for the Wexford constituency. He ran as a member of the Labour Party at the 1922 general election. He served in the D\u00e1il and as Mayor of Wexford until his death in 1945.\nHis death caused a by-election to the D\u00e1il which was won by his son, Brendan Corish, who was later a leader of the Labour Party and T\u00e1naiste.Corish was a member of the Irish National Foresters, and was its High Chief Ranger in 1942.", "link_mentions": {}}}
