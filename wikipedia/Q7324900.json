He was educated by the Christian Brothers in the town. As a fitter in the Wexford Engineering foundry he was blacklisted by his employers after the 1911 Lockout, and became a trade union official in the new Irish Foundry Workers' Union.In 1913 he married Catherine Bergin and they had three children.\nRichard Corish became Mayor of Wexford in 1920 as an Irish Labour Party representative. However, as the Labour Party in the southern 26 counties, later the Irish Free State, chose not to contest the 1921 elections, Corish ran as a Sinn F\u00e9in candidate and was elected to D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann for the Wexford constituency. He ran as a member of the Labour Party at the 1922 general election. He served in the D\u00e1il and as Mayor of Wexford until his death in 1945.\nHis death caused a by-election to the D\u00e1il which was won by his son, Brendan Corish, who was later a leader of the Labour Party and T\u00e1naiste.Corish was a member of the Irish National Foresters, and was its High Chief Ranger in 1942.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "County Wexford", "response": ["*Richard Corish - Trade Unionist"]}, {"page": "Brendan Corish", "response": ["He was born at William Street in Wexford town.

The Labour national executive decided to leave the field to Sinn F\u00e9in, although its 1921 report suggested that it was unaware that Sinn F\u00e9in intended to use the elections to replace the First D\u00e1il with a Second D\u00e1il. The executive reprimanded Richard Corish and the Wexford Trades Council for accepting his Sinn F\u00e9in election nomination. When the truce of July 1921 ended the Irish War of Independence, Labour was not involved in any way in the negotiations that led to the Anglo-Irish Treaty of December 1921, by which a new Irish Free State would be established as a Dominion of the British Empire equivalent in status to Canada.", "The Anglo-Irish Treaty divided the Labour party. It did not take an official stand. From his American prison cell, Jim Larkin opposed the Treaty while the only Labour member of the D\u00e1il, Richard Corish of Wexford spoke and voted for the Treaty. Johnson, never a republican, privately supported the Treaty, while O'Brien did not oppose it. Following the approval of the Treaty by the D\u00e1il in January 1922, the executive of the ILPTUC succeeded at a special conference held in February, in passing a motion to participate in the forthcoming General Election. Successful Labour candidates were required to take their seats in the new Free State D\u00e1il, and a reformist programme was adopted."]}, {"page": "Anglo-Irish Treaty D\u00e1il vote", "response": ["|Richard Corish"]}, {"page": "Corish", "response": ["* Richard Corish (1889\u20131945), Irish politician"]}, {"page": "Corish, Richard", "response": ["#redirectRichard Corish"]}]}}
