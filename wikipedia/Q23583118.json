The Cambridge-educated Browne was also a poet, actor, and theater director. He has been credited, along with his then-wife Ellen Van Volkenburg, with being the founder of the Little Theatre Movement in America through his work with the Chicago Little Theatre. Browne and Van Volkenburg went on to found the department of drama at the Cornish School in Seattle in 1918. Browne's greatest triumph came in 1929 when he produced Journey's End, by R. C. Sherriff in London.", "link_mentions": {}}}
