He took over from Roy Haynes as chief stylist at British Leyland in 1970.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Austin Allegro", "response": ["Stylistically, it went against the sharp-edged styling cues that were becoming fashionable (largely led by Italian designer Giorgetto Giugiaro), and featured rounded panel work. The original styling proposal, by Harris Mann, had the same sleek, wedge-like shape of the Princess, but because British Leyland management, keen to control costs, wanted to install the existing E-Series engine and bulky heating system from the Marina, it became impossible to incorporate the low bonnet line as envisaged: the bodyshell began to look more and more bloated and tubby. This was acceptable to BL, however, which according to Jeff Daniels' book British Leyland, The Truth About The Cars, published in 1980, wanted to follow the Citro\u00ebn approach of combining advanced technology with styling that eschewed mainstream trends in order to create long-lasting \"timeless\" models. Its unfashionable shape was thus not a problem to them. The final car bore little resemblance to Mann's original concept that had originally been conceived as an 1100/1300 reskin. This, as well as British Leyland's faith in it as a model that would help turn the company around, led to it earning the early nickname of the \"flying pig\". Models that were finished in the then fashionable brown colour were given an even ruder nickname."]}, {"page": "Princess (car)", "response": ["Princess sales, although initially strong, were tailing off by the end of the 1970s. Some competitors had added a fifth door as a \"hatchback\", something the Princess lacked (though Harris Mann originally designed the car with a hatch) and the large family car sector fell victim to a poor economic climate further compounded by the OPEC oil crisis. The Princess was somewhere between the Ford Cortina and Ford Granada in terms of size, being designed to compete with more expensive versions of the Cortina as well as entry-level versions of the Granada. British Leyland restyled the Princess with a boot so that it would not compete with their existing SD1 and Maxi designs.", "The exterior styling was distinctive, innovative, and somewhat divisive. \"The Wedge\", as it was often nicknamed, was indeed very wedge-shaped; the styling was all angles and slanting panels. This was very much a 1970s design as created by Italian stylists (see Lamborghini Countach for example). Within BL the car was often referred to as \"The Anteater\". The designer, Harris Mann, was also responsible for the Triumph TR7, another wedge-shaped car, as was his original design for the Austin Allegro, although by the time that design had been readied for production nearly all the angular styling features had been lost.", "After the publication of the Ryder Report in March 1975, one of its key recommendations was to consolidate the many British Leyland brands into a single \"Leyland Cars\" organisation with a common dealer network for all marques and models.  By September 1975, the process of unifying Austin and Morris dealerships was advanced sufficiently, while the Wolseley marque was to be abandoned. Thus the policy of selling seven 18\u201322 series models under three different marques was changed and the range was reduced to four models all sold under the Princess name.  A crown badge was affixed to the point of the bonnet and the script word \"Princess\" was affixed to the grille, the thick vinyl-clad C-pillars and the boot. Only the 1800 model bore the twin headlights, with the 2200 models sporting the wedge-shaped headlights Harris Mann had designed the car to be seen with.", "The Princess designer Harris Mann intended it to be a hatchback and Torcars created a conversion designed to meet the growing demand for fifth-door saloons which was dealer approved.  The Torcars Princess Estate was available in 1800 or 2200 engine sizes, with manual or automatic gearboxes."]}, {"page": "Austin Metro", "response": ["On 8 October 1980, BL introduced the Austin Mini Metro. The roots of the Metro lay in an earlier project denoted as ADO88 (Amalgamated Drawing Office, 88-inch wheelbase), which was intended to be a direct replacement for the Mini.  However, poor reception to the ADO88 design at customer clinics and the increasing dominance of superminis in the ADO88's intended market segment, forced a major change in the project's focus. In late 1977, ADO88 was given an eleventh hour redesign, to make it both larger and less utilitarian in appearance and more upmarket in nature, becoming BL's first supermini, rather than an economy car. The revised project was given the new designator LC8 (Leyland Cars Number 8), and the definitive Metro design would ultimately emerge under the leadership of BL's chief stylists David Bache and Harris Mann. LC8 would replace the more upmarket, lower-volume Clubman versions of the Mini and the lower-spec, smaller-engined variants of the Austin Allegro (which would be fully replaced in the early 1980s by project LC10, which became Austin Maestro). The ADO88 project had experimented with new engines and suspension systems, but with limited time and budgets, LC8 would reuse much of the Mini's engineering (the A-Series engine with front-wheel drive via a sump-mounted four-speed transmission, and front and rear running gear carried in steel subframes separate from the unitary bodyshell) and borrow the Hydragas suspension system developed for the Allegro. However while much was shared conceptually with older BL models, LC8 would see these design elements heavily re-engineered and modernised. For instance the A-Series drivetrain was extensively updated with new materials and tooling to become the A-Plus while the new car would feature 12-inch wheels and all LC8s would have servo-assisted four-piston front disc brakes with fully split hydraulic systems, as opposed to the standard Mini which at the time still had 10-inch wheels and all-round drum brakes. These new drivetrains, wheels, brakes and many other featured developed for the LC8 would be introduced to the Mini in the near future, updating the 30-year old design at minimal extra cost and providing highly desirable economies of scale given the anticipated sales volumes of the new car. This would make it cost effective for the more basic versions of the Mini to remain in production as an entry-level model for BL, in place of the position originally intended for ADO88 while allowing LC8 to compete head-on with the existing superminis.

The majority of TR8s were sold in the United States and Canada.", "TR8 coupes based on the original Harris Mann TR7 design made from 1978 to 1980 are quite rare; it is estimated that only about 400 TR8 coupes ever existed\u2014this number from records kept by members of the North America-based wedge club, the Triumph Wedge Owners Association. To the roughly 150 pre-production coupes mentioned above, another 250 or so coupes were produced, some sold in Canada as 1979 models but most ended up being held back and then finally sold in the US as 1980 models.  In 1979, a long-anticipated Michelotti-refreshed TR7 Drophead (convertible) was introduced, and almost all subsequent production TR8s were convertibles.Bill Piggott, Original Triumph TR7 & TR8, MBI Publishing, 2000 Total worldwide production, as best as can be determined throughout all the labour turmoil at the time, is only around 2750, give or take a \"handful\".

It took its name from Giorgetto Giugiaro's Italdesign studio, which had been employed by BL to manage the re-engineering of the Morris Marina, which had been produced by the company since 1971. Although BL's advertising emphasised the car's connection with the Italian design house, Italdesign did not have a direct role in the styling of the new car, which had been handled in-house by Harris Mann. Italdesign had been involved in a consultancy role, to help design new tooling and assembly methods, and work out how to integrate the altered parts of the new car into the existing Marina production chain. That is why, despite bearing the studio's name, the Ital is absent from lists of styling jobs handled by the firm. It was originally planned to brand the car as the Morris Marina Ital but, for most markets, the Marina name was dropped on the orders of British Leyland CEO, Michael Edwardes, and only the Ital name was used.Marina/Ital Development Story, AROnline "]}, {"page": "Triumph TR7", "response": ["The car, characterised by its \"wedge\" shape and by a swage line sweeping down from the rear wing to just behind the front wheel, was commonly advertised as \"the shape of things to come\".

In early 1979, Triumph belatedly introduced a convertible version, called the \"TR7 drophead coup\u00e9\" (DHC), which first went on sale in the US (the original hardtop model being known as the \"fixedhead coup\u00e9\", or FHC). A small number of pre-production cars were manufactured at Speke in 1978, soon after the pre-production TR7 V8 (later designated TR8) and TR7 Sprint cars.

The ADO74 project considered various proposed car sizes, from a direct Mini replacement, a more conventional supermini and a compact saloon. Unsurprisingly the mid-sized option was chosen and styling proposals were drawn up by Harris Mann and Giovanni Michelotti, with Mann's design going forward. The result was over 15 inches longer than the Mini, with a wheelbase 10 inches longer. Like the 9X (and most of its would-be competitors) the ADO74 used MacPherson strut front suspension, but with independent trailing arms at the rear, akin to the contemporary Honda Civic. Power would have come from the proposed K-Series engine (an alloy-head overhead cam version of the Mini's A-Series engine that owed much to the 9X's prototype unit).", "That requirement also led to the ADO88, despite the efforts of Harris Mann. having an inevitably boxy appearance, with an almost vertical rear hatch (similar in appearance to the later Fiat Cinquecento). This style was received very poorly in customer clinics and the project was renamed LC8 with the aim of providing a more upmarket style and appearance to make the car more competitive. Having originally been intended as a complete Mini replacement, LC8 would now become a separate car in its own right to replace the higher-end Clubman and 1275GT Mini models while the more basic Minis would continue (with some of the improvements from the ADO88 project such as the A-Plus engine and front disc brakes) as a budget model. The LC8 became the Austin Metro, which was initially launched in 1980 as the Austin Mini-Metro to signify its status as a supplement to the Mini range rather than a replacement."]}]}}
