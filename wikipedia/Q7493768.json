Multiple models and body doubles have portrayed Croft in promotional material up until the reboot in 2013. Eight different real-life models have portrayed her at promotional events."]}, {"page": "Lara Croft", "response": ["Core Design handled the initial development of the character and the series. Inspired by strong female icons, Gard designed Lara Croft to counter stereotypical female characters. The company modified the character for subsequent titles, which included graphical improvements and gameplay additions. American developer Crystal Dynamics took over the series after the 2003 sequel Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness was received poorly. The new developer rebooted the character along with the video game series. The company altered her physical proportions and gave her additional ways of interacting with game environments. Croft has been voiced by six actresses in the video game series: Shelley Blond (1996), Judith Gibbins (1997\u201398), Jonell Elliott (1999\u20132003), Keeley Hawes (2006\u201314), Camilla Luddington (2013\u2013present), and Abigail Stahlschmidt (2015).", "Gard was keen to animate the character realistically, an aspect he felt the industry at the time had disregarded. He sacrificed quick animations in favour of more fluid movement, believing that players would empathise with the character more easily. Lara's dual-wielding of pistols was inspired by the film Hard Boiled and an \u00c6on Flux short. In the first Tomb Raider, Croft's three-dimensional (3D) character model is made of around 230\u00a0polygons. The character's braid was removed from the model, but added back for subsequent iterations. Gavin Rummery, programmer on the first two Tomb Raider games, explained, \"It had been dropped from the original because it just didn't work properly with all the acrobatic moves\u2014it was more like she had an electric eel attached to her head that had a life of its own. But on TRII I came up with a way to get it working and was really pleased how natural it looked.\" Although widely reported that, while adjusting the character model, Gard accidentally increased the breasts' dimensions by 150 percent and the rest of the creative team argued to keep the change, Gard has stated that the notion \"came out of a silly remark made in an interview\". Core Design hired Shelley Blond to voice Croft after the game entered the beta phase of development. Gard left Core Design after completing Tomb Raider, citing a lack of creative freedom and control over marketing decisions related to the ideas he developed (especially Lara Croft).", " bar:TR1 from:25/10/1996 till:18/11/1997 width:15 color:TR1 text:\"Shelley Blond\" shift:(-11,-3)"]}, {"page": "Black & White (video game)", "response": ["Shaw's lack of experience in playing \"ethnic\" instruments was a problem, but Steafan Hannigan, an expert on the subject, was enlisted to help.
