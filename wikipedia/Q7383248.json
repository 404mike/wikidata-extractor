She began to play small roles in 1896, taking on larger roles in Gilbert and Sullivan revivals the following year and soon creating leading roles including Iza in The Grand Duchess of Gerolstein (1897\u201398), Laine in The Beauty Stone (1898) and Princess Laoula in The Lucky Star (1899).  She also continued to sing leading roles in Gilbert and Sullivan revivals, including Casilda in The Gondoliers and Aline in The Sorcerer in 1898 and Josephine in H.M.S. Pinafore in 1899.  Unhappy to be passed over for the leading soprano role in The Rose of Persia, Vincent left the company near the end of 1899.\nAfter this, Vincent went on to a substantial career in Edwardian musical comedies, opera and concert singing.  She created leading West End roles in V\u00e9ronique (1904\u201305), Tom Jones (1907), The Belle of Brittany (1909) and several others, and she also performed on Broadway.
