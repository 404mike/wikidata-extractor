Stuart Urban was assigned the first five episodes and Simon Cellan Jones the final four. However, after completing the first two episodes and some of the shooting for the third, Urban left the project after disagreements with the production team.Eaton, pp. 28\u201329 Peter Flannery was concerned that Urban's directorial style was not suited to the material that he had written. Christopher Eccleston's viewpoint is that Urban was \"only interested in painting pretty pictures.\" Pattinson agreed that a change was needed, and Michael Jackson agreed to a change of director mid-way through production, which was unusual for a British television drama of this type so far into proceedings. Director Pedr James, who had recently directed an adaptation of Martin Chuzzlewit for Michael Wearing's department, was hired to shoot the remainder of what were to have been Urban's episodes.", "Among the supporting roles, one of the highest-profile pieces of casting was Malcolm McDowell as Soho porn baron Benny Barrett. Barrett appears in scenes across various episodes from 1966 through to 1979, but the production could only afford him for three weeks. This was because McDowell was then a resident in the United States. All of McDowell's scenes were therefore shot by Stuart Urban as part of the first block of filming, as opposed to the rest of the production which was filmed roughly chronologically. This was considered more than worthwhile, however, for the prestige of being able to use an actor such as McDowell, predominantly a film actor who seldom did television work.", "After Stuart Urban left the production and the decision had been made to re-shoot some of the material that he had completed with Pedr James directing, producer Charles Pattinson suggested to Peter Flannery that the first episode should not simply be remade, but also rewritten.Eaton, p. 30 Flannery took the opportunity to completely change the opening storyline, introducing the love story element between Nicky and Mary earlier. This was introduced in later episodes of the television version, but had not been part of the original play. Other storyline and character changes were made with the new version of the first episode because it was the script that had most closely resembled the original stage play. Michael Wearing felt that the story could be expanded to a greater degree for television.", "Category:Films directed by Stuart Urban"]}, {"page": "Preaching to the Perverted (film)", "response": ["Preaching to the Perverted is a 1997 British sex comedy drama film written and directed by Stuart Urban.The New York TimesDVD TalkSex in Cinema - Greatest and Most Influential Erotic Scenes 1997Top 10 Highly Kinky Films on Obsessed with FilmCinesploitation ReviewFilm Threat ReviewA Site Called Fred Review", "Category:Films directed by Stuart Urban"]}, {"page": "Georgina Hale", "response": ["|Stuart Urban"]}, {"page": "Sue Johnston", "response": ["| Stuart Urban"]}, {"page": "List of Bergerac episodes", "response": ["| Stuart Urban"]}, {"page": "Christien Anholt", "response": ["Christien Alexis Anholt (born 25 February 1971) is an English stage, television and film actor best known for portraying Nigel Bailey in the television series Relic Hunter.
