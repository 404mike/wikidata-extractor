At the age of ten Bennett was admitted to the London Royal Academy of Music (RAM), where he remained for ten years. By the age of twenty, he had begun to make a reputation as a concert pianist, and his compositions received high praise. Among those impressed by Bennett was the German composer Felix Mendelssohn, who invited him to Leipzig. There Bennett became friendly with Robert Schumann, who shared Mendelssohn's admiration for his compositions. Bennett spent three winters composing and performing in Leipzig.\nIn 1837 Bennett began to teach at the RAM, with which he was associated for most of the rest of his life. For twenty years he taught there, later also teaching at Queen's College, London. Amongst his pupils during this period were Arthur Sullivan, Hubert Parry, and Tobias Matthay. Throughout the 1840s and 1850s he composed little, although he performed as a pianist and directed the Philharmonic Society for ten years. He also actively promoted concerts of chamber music. From 1848 onwards his career was punctuated by antagonism between himself and the conductor Michael Costa.\nIn 1858 Bennett returned to composition, but his later works, though popular, were considered old-fashioned and did not arouse as much critical enthusiasm as his youthful compositions had done. He was Professor of Music at the University of Cambridge from 1856 until 1875. In 1866 he became Principal of the RAM, rescuing it from closure, and remained in this position until his death. He was knighted in 1871. He died in London in 1875 and was buried in Westminster Abbey.\nBennett had a significant influence on English music, not solely as a composer but also as a teacher, as a promoter of standards of musical education and as an important figure in London concert life. In recent years, appreciation of Bennett's compositions has been rekindled and a number of his works, including a symphony, his piano concerti, some vocal music and many of his piano compositions, have been recorded. In his bicentenary year of 2016, several concerts of his music and other related events took place.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Robert Schumann", "response": ["In 1837 Schumann published his Symphonic Studies, a complex set of \u00e9tude-like variations written in 1834\u20131835, which demanded a finished piano technique. These variations were based on a theme by the adoptive father of Ernestine von Fricken. The work\u2014described as \"one of the peaks of the piano literature, lofty in conception and faultless in workmanship\" [Hutcheson]\u2014was dedicated to the young English composer William Sterndale Bennett, for whom Schumann had had a high regard when they worked together in Leipzig.", "During this time Schumann, Brahms and Schumann's pupil Albert Dietrich collaborated on the composition of the F-A-E Sonata for Joachim; Schumann also published an article, \"Neue Bahnen\" (\"New Paths\") in the Neue Zeitschrift (his first article in many years), hailing the unknown young Brahms from Hamburg, a man who had published nothing, as \"the Chosen One\" who \"was destined to give ideal expression to the times.\"Robert Schumann's \"Artikel Neue Bahnen\", 28 October 1853 It was an extraordinary way to present Brahms to the musical world, setting up great expectations that he did not fulfill for many years.Brahms' A German Requiem, published in 1868, brought the first widespread recognition of his talent. In January 1854, Schumann went to Hanover, where he heard a performance of his Paradise and the Peri organized by Joachim and Brahms. Two years later at Schumann's request, the work received its first English performance conducted by William Sterndale Bennett."]}, {"page": "Clara Schumann", "response": ["Clara Schumann first toured England in April 1856, while her husband was still living but unable to travel. She was invited to play in a London Philharmonic Society concert by conductor William Sterndale Bennett, a good friend of Robert's. She was displeased with the little time spent on rehearsals: \"They call it a rehearsal here if a piece is played through once.\" She wrote that musical \"artists\" in England \"allow themselves to be treated as inferiors.\" She was happy, though, to hear the cellist Alfredo Piatti play with \"a tone, a bravura, a certainty, such as I never heard before\". In May 1856, she played Schumann's Piano Concerto in A minor with the New Philharmonic Society conducted by Dr Wylde, who as she said had \"led a dreadful rehearsal\" and \"could not grasp the rhythm of the last movement\". Still, she returned to London the following year and continued to perform in Britain for the next 15 years."]}, {"page": "Arthur Sullivan", "response": ["In 1856 the Royal Academy of Music awarded the first Mendelssohn Scholarship to the 14-year-old Sullivan, granting him a year's training at the academy.
