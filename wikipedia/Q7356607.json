As a result of Ridgewell's corruption the four men's case was returned to the Court of Appeal in October 2019, which indicated that the case would review Ridgewell's \"integrity\". A number of Ridgewell's other cases had recently come before the appeal court, such as that of businessman Stephen Simmons who was also found to have been framed. Their convictions were quashed on 5 December 2019  by Lord Chief Justice, Lord Burnett, in a judgement given alongside Mrs Justice McGowan and Sir Roderick Evans. Burnett stated that the appeal court recognised \"an accumulating body of evidence that points to the fundamental unreliability of evidence given by DS Ridgewell...and others of this specialist group\". The four men were all aged between 19 and 23 when they were arrested by police investigating crime on London Underground; Trew later claimed that they were all \"given a good hiding there to confess to things we didn't do\". The CCRC supported Trew's and Christie's appeal, although noted that they had not been able to discover the whereabouts of Griffiths or Boucher, whom they believed to have emigrated later that decade. Their cases will remain available to prosecute should they request it, said the CCRC, who made the referral, they said, because \"the commission considers there is a real possibility that the court will quash the conviction on the basis of new evidence and arguments concerning the integrity of DS Ridgewell.\" They also suggested that the appeal had \"potential significance\" for others convicted following Ridgewell's investigation or testimony."]}]}}
