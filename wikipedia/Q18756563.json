His countryman Abraham Benisch and Moravian Albert L\u00f6wy also were studying there at the time. In Lowy's room in 1838 they inaugurated among intimate (and lifelong) friends, a proto-Zionist society called \"Die Einheit\". The society's objective was to promote the welfare of the Jewish people, and in order to realize this objective, they advocated the civilization of Palestine by Austrian Jews. Their objective however, had to be kept secret for fear it would be put down by the government; England became regarded as the country likely to welcome the new movement. In 1841 Lowy was sent to London as an emissary of the Students' Jewish National Society;Nahum Sokolow, History of Zionism: 1600\u20131918, Chapter 40, (1919) Benisch also arrived in England the same year.
