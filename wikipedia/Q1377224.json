He is most remembered for his research work in atomic physics and nuclear physics. He is one of the British scientists who participated in the United States' Manhattan Project, Britain's Tube Alloys, and was involved in nuclear weapon development. Moon made outstanding and original experimental contributions which stimulated the development of whole fields of research involving neutrons, gamma rays and novel methods of studying chemical reactions ('Mechanically propelled molecular beams: techniques and opportunities', Moon, P.B. Ralls, M.P., Proceedings of the Royal Society A, 423, 361 371, 1989).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Leyton Sixth Form College", "response": ["* Philip Burton Moon, Poynting Professor of Physics in the University of Birmingham from 1950\u201374, part of the Manhattan Project"]}, {"page": "Noor Muhammad Butt", "response": ["In 1963, he went to attend the Birmingham University in England on Commonwealth Scholarship for his doctoral studies, and carried out his doctoral studies under Dr. Philip Burton Moon.

The development of a high-speed rotor by Philip Burton Moon at Birmingham allowed Simons to apply this apparatus with crossed molecular beams at supersonic speed to examining the dynamics of photochemical reactions and bimolecular collisions. At Nottingham, he started to use tuneable lasers to investigate reaction dynamics. He was a pioneer of the use of Doppler-resolved, polarised laser spectroscopy to generate three-dimensional images of molecules colliding (stereodynamics), and is regarded as \"one of the founding fathers in the field of 'stereodynamics'\"."]}, {"page": "List of nominees for the Nobel Prize in Physics", "response": ["|Philip Burton Moon"]}]}}
