Her first book, Domestic Manners of the Americans (1832) is the best known. She also wrote social novels: one against slavery said to have influenced Harriet Beecher Stowe, the first industrial novel, and two anti-Catholic novels that used a Protestant position to examine self-making. Some recent scholars note how modernist critics exclude women writers such as Frances Trollope from consideration.Nicola Diane Thompson, Victorian Women Writers and the Woman Question, Cambridge University Press, 2012.

When the Trollopes moved to a leased farm at Harrow-on-the-Hill in 1817, they faced financial struggles for lack of agricultural expertise. This was where Frances gave birth to her last two children. Two of her sons also became writers. Her eldest surviving son, Thomas Adolphus Trollope, wrote mostly histories: The Girlhood of Catherine de Medici, History of Florence, What I Remember, Life of Pius IX, and some novels. Her fourth son Anthony Trollope became a well-known and received novelist, establishing a strong reputation, especially for his serial novels, such as those set in the fictional county of Barsetshire, and his political series the Palliser novels.

It was the poet Robert Browning however, who proved to be one of Home's most adamant critics. After attending a s\u00e9ance of Home's, Browning wrote in a letter to The Times that: 'the whole display of hands, spirit utterances etc., was a cheat and imposture'. Browning gave his unflattering impression of Home in the poem, \"Sludge the Medium\" (1864). His wife, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, was convinced that the phenomena she witnessed were genuine and their discussions about Home were a constant source of disagreement.Lamont 2005 p50 Frank Podmore writes of a Mr Merrifield's first-hand account of experiencing Home's fraudulence during a s\u00e9ance."]}, {"page": "Ellen Ternan", "response": ["Ellen Ternan was born in Rochester, Kent.

His best-known works \u2013 the short stories \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" and \"Rip Van Winkle\" \u2013 were both written in Birmingham, as was his first and best-known novel Bracebridge Hall of 1821, whose setting was loosely based on Birmingham's Aston Hall. Many of his later works, including Tales of the Alhambra and Mahomet and His Successors, were completed in Birmingham after being drafted on his wider European travels. Thomas Adolphus Trollope worked as a schoolteacher in Birmingham before establishing himself as a successful novelist, journalist and travel writer and moving to Florence in Italy, where his house became a magnet for British literary figures such as Charles Dickens, George Eliot and Elizabeth Barrett Browning. Isabella Varley Banks was born in Manchester and is best known for her 1876 novel The Manchester Man, but her career as a novelist started only after she moved to Birmingham in 1846 after marrying local journalist, poet and playwright George Linnaeus Banks. Her twelve novels were set in a variety of locations including Birmingham, Yorkshire, Wiltshire, Durham, Chester, and Manchester; each book being particularly notable for its faithful reproduction of local dialect and pronunciation. West Bromwich-born David Christie Murray received his training as a writer as a journalist under George Dawson on the Birmingham Daily Post.

These articles, which pointedly disregarded the Pope, lauded the Italian nationalists. Her articles are credited with encouraging popular British support for the emergence of Italy as a nation. The American Atlantic Monthly reported in 1864 on Theodosia's poor health, citing it as the reason her intellectual gifts had not been more widely appreciated. Her gift for languages was noted in that she could understand Italian nearly as well as her first language. Before she married Thomas Adolphus Trollope, she published several works. Furthermore, her skills developed at a very young age. She became a famous and well-known writer quickly through her writings for the Italian independence. Most of her contributions were offered through different translations. Trollope translated an Italian nationalist play by Giovanni Battista Niccolini and excerpts from the poet Giuseppe Giusti and the activist Francesco Dall'Ongaro.
