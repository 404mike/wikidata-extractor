Robson scored twice in the replay, but declined the chance to become the first player in 30 years to score an FA Cup final hat-trick, instead allowing regular penalty taker Arnold Muhren to convert a spot-kick to seal a 4\u20130 victory and enable Robson to lift his first trophy as United captain. Although this was United's fifth FA Cup triumph, Robson was only the second English captain to lift the trophy for United, and their first since Charlie Roberts in the 1909 final; as United had been captained by an Irishman in their 1948 and 1963 triumphs and a Scotsman in 1977.Robson (2007), p. 67."]}, {"page": "Professional Footballers' Association", "response": ["The PFA was formed on 2 December 1907 as the Association Football Players' and Trainers' Union (AFPTU; commonly referred to at the time as the Players' Union).

Despite this, he left for Plymouth Argyle in May 1903 ahead of their first season as a professional club. He scored their first competitive goals in both the Southern League and Western League, and scored 21 goals from 46 appearances in his one year at Home Park.\"Jack Peddie profile\". Greens on Screen. Retrieved 23 August 2010. He returned to Manchester United in 1904, and as well as being named club captain, he was again the club's top goalscorer with 17 goals in 32 league appearances. The arrival of high-scoring Jack Picken in May 1905 meant Peddie was unable to repeat the feat for a third time in four seasons, although he still made an important contribution with 20 goals in all competitions as Manchester United finished in second place to win promotion back to the First Division for the first time since 1894. Peddie was also replaced as captain by Charlie Roberts prior to the 1905\u201306 season. Having played in the Home Scots v Anglo-Scots international trial match twice while playing for Third Lanark and twice with Newcastle, he made his fifth appearance in the fixture as a Manchester United player in March 1906, but would never be selected for the Scottish national team. In January 1907, he returned to Scotland, signing for Heart of Midlothian in a triple transfer with Dick Wombwell and William Yates. In total across his two spells with Manchester United, Peddie scored 58 goals in 121 appearances."]}]}}
