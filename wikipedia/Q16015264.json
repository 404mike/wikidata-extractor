Their two outstanding players were the cousins Peter and Ray Smith who both completed the double. These two, bowling leg break and off break respectively, effectively carried the Essex attack. Outstanding prospect Trevor Bailey was the sole pace bowler of any effect but he was only available in the latter half of the season and then injuries limited his bowling, though he topped the county's batting averages. The other all-rounder Frank Vigar took 59 championship wickets bowling leg breaks but was expensive. Bailey, Vigar and the Smiths were half of the eight Essex players who scored 1,000 runs in the season, the other four being captain Tom Pearce, Chick Cray, Dickie Dodds and Doug Insole. Wicketkeeper Tom Wade had a very good season with 77 victims, 38 of them stumped. Essex were also represented by Bill Dines, Bill Morris, Denys Wilcox, Dick Horsfall, Frank Rist, Harry Crabtree, Len Clark and Sonny Avery.Playfair, pp. 100\u2013102."]}, {"page": "1947\u201348 Colchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|Frank Rist", "|Frank Rist", "|align=\"left\"|Frank Rist", "|Frank Rist"]}, {"page": "Dickie Dodds", "response": ["Dodds reported that he asked God how he should play cricket, and received the reply: \"Hit the ball hard and enjoy it.\" He took some while to follow this advice, but when he did, the Essex cricketer and coach Frank Rist noted a transformation in his batting which led him to dub Dodds \"the miracle man\". Dodds himself dated his transformation to a match against Middlesex: \"I felt closer to God than ever before in my life,\" he wrote. \"I tried to fashion the loveliest strokes I could manage for the God who would enjoy them. In return I had a tremendous sense of His pleasure.\""]}]}}
