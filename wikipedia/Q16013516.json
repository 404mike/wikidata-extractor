Identifying monoamine oxidase and demonstrating its function in the brain early in his career, he became a prime mover in his field. In 1968 he was involved in the foundation of the British Brain Research Organization (BRA). Prior to this he helped to establish the Mental Health Research Fund, later renamed The Mental Health Foundation,(1949). He also established the Journal of Neurochemistry (1956), of which he was one of the chief editors from 1956 to 1969. He was involved in the foundation of the International Brain Research Organization (IBRO) (1960), of which he became secretary-general, and the International Society for Neurochemistry (ISN) (1967). After leading a research unit at Whitchurch Psychiatric Hospital (1947\u20131960), he became director of the Medical Research Council Neuropsychiatric Research Unit in Carshalton (1960\u20131971). Throughout his life he promoted international collaboration in research.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mental Health Foundation", "response": ["The Mental Health Foundation was founded in 1940 as the Mental Health Research Fund.

From the beginning of Barton's practice until Wiesner's retirement in the mid-late 1960s, Mary Barton successfully inseminated an estimated 1500 women, the majority with sperm provided from Wiesner, some 1-200 from neuroscientist Derek Richter as well as an unknown number from as yet unidentified donors. It is estimated that Wiesner is the biological father of around 600 children born following these procedures, although some believe this figure could be as high as 1000.Findlay, S.,'British Man Fathered 600 Children at Own Fertility Clinic'.

DNA evidence suggests that many of the babies were conceived using sperm from Wiesner himself. His son, Jonathan Wiesner, underwent DNA testing in 2007 which provided a basis for identification. Some estimates suggest that of the more than 1,000 successful AID pregnancies Barton reported, Wiesner may have been responsible for as many as 2/3, or 600 children. Another major donor was neuroscientist Derek Richter, who may have fathered more than a hundred babies."]}]}}
