He played in the Eton v Harrow cricket matches in four seasons from 1854 to 1857 as a right-handed middle-order batsman. At Cambridge University in 1858 he went straight into the first team for cricket and in his first first-class match, against the Cambridge Town Club, he made 100, putting on 160 for the fourth wicket with William Benthall who made 103 and was also making his first-class cricket debut. He retained his place in the Cambridge side across the season and was picked for the University Match against Oxford University; in this game, he top-scored for Cambridge with 43 in the first innings but failed, with the rest of the side, in the second innings when the whole team was dismissed for just 39. At the end of the university cricket season, Norman was picked for the 1858 Gentlemen v Players match at Lord's, which the Players team won decisively. Right at the end of the season, he played a single game for Kent which Sussex, largely through the bowling of John Wisden and Jemmy Dean, also won easily. In neither of these games did he reach double figures."]}, {"page": "List of Gentlemen cricketers (1841\u20131962)", "response": ["* William Benthall (1859\u20131863)"]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1827\u20131863)", "response": ["* William Benthall (1861\u20131863) : W.
