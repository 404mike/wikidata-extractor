Charles Madge (1874-1916) and Barbara Hylton-Foster (1882-1967). He was educated at Winchester College and studied at Magdalene College, Cambridge. He was a literary figure from his early twenties, becoming a friend of David Gascoyne; like Gascoyne he was generally classed as a surrealist poet. Madge's essay \"Surrealism for the English\" (New Verse magazine, December 1933) argued that potential English surrealist poets would need both a knowledge of \"the philosophical position of the French surrealists\" and \"a knowledge of their own language and literature\".Rob Jackaman, The Course of English Surrealist Poetry since the 1930s.

In fact, the Communists' support for the war was so vociferous that they launched a campaign for a Second Front in order to support the USSR and speed the defeat of the Axis. In industry, they now opposed strike action and supported the Joint Production Committees,The patriotic stance of the CPGB was such that in 1943 at a by-election in Cardiff they actively campaigned for the Conservative Party candidate against Fenner Brockway, the Independent Labour Party candidate.
