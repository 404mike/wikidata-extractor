In 1906 the Department of Agriculture handed its herbarium over to the Museum, but reclaimed it in 1911. The \"forest herbarium\" commenced in 1916. Around 1928, the Government took the decision to amalgamate the three into a single State Herbarium, to be managed by the Department of Agriculture. The \"forest herbarium\" was handed over more or less immediately, but the Museum was opposed to the merger, and did not finally hand over its specimens until around 1959. In 1988 departmental responsibility was shifted from the Department of Agriculture to the Department of Conservation and Land Management, the Department of Parks and Wildlife, and now the Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions."]}, {"page": "Harry Page Woodward", "response": ["* Bernard Henry Woodward"]}, {"page": "Woodward (surname)", "response": ["* Bernard Henry Woodward (1846\u20131916), British-born naturalist and director of the Western Australian Museum"]}, {"page": "Bernard Woodward", "response": ["*Bernard Henry Woodward (1846\u20131916), British-born Australian museum director, son of Samuel Pickworth Woodward"]}, {"page": "Bernard H.
