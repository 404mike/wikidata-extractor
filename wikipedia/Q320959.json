His successes have been considered to have \"never been excelled, not even by Nelson\" according to one biographer. Blake is recognised as the chief founder of England's naval supremacy, a dominance subsequently inherited by the British Royal Navy into the early 20th century. Despite this, due to deliberate attempts to expunge the Parliamentarians from history following the Restoration, Blake's achievements tend to remain unrecognized.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
