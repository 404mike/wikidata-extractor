He was the founder of the British Council.Born in Sydney, Australia, Leeper was educated at Melbourne Grammar School, Melbourne's Trinity College, and New College, Oxford.\nLeeper was the son of Dr Alexander Leeper, the first Warden of Trinity College, the University of Melbourne, and his wife Adeline (n\u00e9e Allen). His half-sister Valentine Leeper (1900\u20132001), maintained a lifelong correspondence with him.Leeper began his government career at the Intelligence Bureau of the Department of Information in the First World War and served briefly at the Political Intelligence Department. He contributed to the weekly review The New Europe under the pseudonym Rurik.He served as the chief of the news department of the Foreign Office, which via such organs as the British Council, the British Library of Information, the Travel Association and the foreign language broadcasts of the BBC sought to influence public opinion abroad. Leeper was appointed assistant undersecretary of state with a special brief for propaganda in early 1938. Much of his time was taken up with preparations for the British exhibition for the 1939 World's Fair in New York. A major problem with propaganda in the United States in 1938 was the work of the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HCUAC) headed by a xenophobic congressman from Texas, Martin Dies, which in 1938 started an investigation into allegations of British propaganda. In June 1938, Lord Lloyd of the British Council suggested sending British professors to American universities with the aim of influencing American undergraduates, a plan supported by Leeper and Sir Robert Vansittart, the Special Adviser on Foreign Policy. The ambassador to the United States, Sir Ronald Lindsay, fearing the HCUAC, vetoed this plan, writing in a letter to Leeper on 10 July 1938 that the possibility of Dies discovering the plan was too much and asked Leeper \"what they were at\". In an attempt to circumvent Lindsay, Leeper called a meeting in London to discuss how to engage in propaganda in the United States. Besides for Leeper, the meeting was attended by Lord Lothian, the secretary of the Rhodes Trust; Angus Fletcher of the British Library of Information; the Labour MP Josiah Wedgewood; and Frank Darvall of the English-Speaking Union.  He became head of Britain's Political Intelligence Department when it reformed in 1939.\nLeeper was the British ambassador to the Greek government 1943\u201346 (in exile in Cairo until October 1944). He played a critical role in Greek political developments of 1944, especially in support of the Greek monarchy in the person of King George II of Greece. After Greece's liberation, Leeper continued to be one of the major power brokers during his tenure, which included the early stages of the Greek Civil War.\n\nLeeper was then British ambassador to Argentina from 1946 to 1948. In February 1948 he and a UK trade mission led by Clive Baillieu secured a new trade agreement with Argentina. It was signed on 7 February in the Port of Buenos Aires at a reception aboard the Royal Mail Lines flagship RMS Andes.His brother, Alexander Wigram Allen Leeper, was also a distinguished British diplomat.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George II of Greece", "response": ["A deeply paranoid and insecure man, George believed that the British government was plotting to prevent his return to Greece, despite all of the evidence to the contrary. Edward Warner of the Southern Department of the Foreign Office wrote in March 1942 that the king was \"under the extraordinary impression that the Foreign Office was 'pro-Republican and anti-himself'\".Clogg, p. 392 The British ambassador to the government-in-exile, Sir Reginald Leeper, noted that the king's coldness did not win him many friends, writing: \"Amongst these vivacious, talkative and intensely political southerners he is very much the reserved northerner who damps the ardour of those who might otherwise acclaim him\". Leeper noted that almost every meeting he had with the king, he had to listen to a lengthy litany of complaints. In particular, the king objected to BBC's Greek language service, where the main radio announcer, G.N. Soteriadis, was a Venizelist. George repeatedly asked that Soteriadis be fired and replaced with a monarchist. One of George's few friends was the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who was determined to see him restored and tended to back the king's complaints against his own officials."]}, {"page": "Arthur Ransome", "response": ["Ransome provided some information to British officials and the British Secret Intelligence Service, which gave him the code name S.76 in their files. Bruce Lockhart said in his memoirs: \"Ransome was a Don Quixote with a walrus moustache, a sentimentalist who could always be relied upon to champion the underdog, and a visionary whose imagination had been fired by the revolution. He was on excellent terms with the Bolsheviks and frequently brought us information of the greatest value.\" Nonetheless in March 1919, on one of his return visits to the United Kingdom, the authorities interviewed him and threatened him with exposure as an agent.Brogan (1984), p 235 In October 1919, Ransome met Reginald Leeper of the Foreign Office's Political Intelligence Department, who required Ransome privately to submit his articles and public speaking engagements for approval. Ransome's response was \"indignant\". Unbeknown to Leeper, Ransome's \"near treason[ous]\" articles were written to buttress his exceptional access to the Bolshevik leadership. MI5, the British Security Service, was suspicious that Ransome and his fellow journalist, M. Philips Price, were a threat because of their opposition to the Allied Intervention in the Russian Civil War."]}, {"page": "Cham Albanians", "response": ["Reginald Leeper, the British ambassador at Athens in 1945, in a letter to the British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden in April 1945 mention that the Greeks can blame Cham Albanians for the murder of the Italian General Enrico Tellini which was the pretext for the Italian bombardment and occupation of Corfu at 1923."]}, {"page": "Robert Vansittart, 1st Baron Vansittart", "response": ["After the war, an effort was made to cover up Vansittart's embarrassing \"real friendship\" with Henlein.Czechoslovakia Between Stalin and Hitler: the Diplomacy of Edvard Benes in the 1930s, p.89, by Igor Lukes, Oxford University Press, 1996. In the late 1930s, Vansittart together with Reginald Leeper, the Foreign Office's Press Secretary often leaked information to a private newspaper, The Whitehall Letter, edited by Victor Gordon Lennox, the anti-appeasement diplomatic editor of the Daily Telegraph.Watt, Donald Cameron \"Rumors as Evidence\" pages 276-286 from Russia War, Peace and Diplomacy edited by Ljubica & Mark Erickson, London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2004 page 278."]}, {"page": "Chartwell", "response": ["In the opinion of Robin Fedden, a diplomat, and later Deputy General Secretary of the National Trust and author of the Trust's first guidebook for Chartwell, the house became \"the most important country house in Europe\". A stream of friends, colleagues, disgruntled civil servants and concerned military officers came to the house to provide information to support Churchill's struggle against appeasement. At Chartwell, he developed what Fedden calls, his own \"little Foreign Office\u00a0... the hub of resistance\". The Chartwell visitors' book, meticulously maintained from 1922, records 780 house guests, not all of them friends, but all grist to Churchill's mill. An example of the latter was Sir Maurice Hankey, Clerk of the Privy Council, who was Churchill's guest for dinner in April 1936. Hankey subsequently wrote, \"I do not usually make a note of private conversations but some points arose which gave an indication of the line which Mr Churchill is likely to take in forthcoming debates (on munitions and supply) in Parliament\". A week later, Reginald Leeper, a senior Foreign Office official and confidant of Robert Vansittart, visited Churchill to convey their views on the need to use the League of Nations to counter German aggression. Vansittart wrote, \"there is no time to lose. There is indeed a great danger that we shall be too late\"."]}, {"page": "Enrico Tellini", "response": ["Reginald Leeper, the British ambassador at Athens in 1945, in a letter to the British Foreign Secretary at April 1945 mention that the Greeks that lived in Albania blame Cham Albanians for the murder of Tellini."]}, {"page": "Eastern Approaches", "response": ["By the end of the year, the war had developed in such a way that the new SAS detachment would not be needed in Persia. General Wilson was being transferred to Middle East Command, and Maclean extracted a promise that the newly trained troops would go with him, as their style of commando raids were ideal for southern and eastern Europe.  Frustrated by the abandoning of plans for an assault on Crete, Maclean went to see Reginald Leeper, \"an old friend from Foreign Office days, and now His Majesty's Ambassador to the Greek Government then in exile in Cairo\". Leeper put in a word for him, and very soon Maclean was told to go to London to get his instructions directly from the prime minister. Churchill told him to parachute into Jugoslavia (now spelled Yugoslavia) as head of a military mission accredited to Josip Broz Tito (a shadowy figure at that point) or whoever was in charge of the Partisans, the Communist-led resistance movement. Mihajlovic's royalist Cetniks (now spelled Chetniks), which the Allies had been supporting, did not appear to be fighting the Germans very hard, and indeed were said to be collaborating with the enemy.  Maclean famously paraphrased Churchill: \"My task was simply to help find out who was killing the most Germans and suggest means by which we could help them to kill more.\" The prime minister saw Maclean as \"a daring Ambassador-leader to these hardy and hunted guerillas\"."]}, {"page": "Corfu incident", "response": ["According to Italian newspapers and the official statement of the Albanian government, the attack was carried out by Greeks,Italy in the last fifteen hundred years: a concise history By Reinhold Schumann page 298 () \"The Italian newspapers declare that the murders were the result of deliberate ambuscade by Greeks\u2014natives of Epirus, and will leave an indelible stain.

The letter stated that Daout Hodja (Daut Hoxha), a Cham Albanian bandit, killed General Tellini and the other officers. Summarising the most recent evidence, the Greek historian Aristotle Kallis wrote: Much about the incident which resulted in Tellini's assassination remains unclear. There is sufficient evidence to lend credence to the Greek government's argument that the perpetrators had in fact originated from Albania and had crossed the border illegally to ambush the car inside Greece and thus inculpate the Greek side."]}, {"page": "Ferrocarriles Argentinos", "response": ["In April 1946 some British companies executives, such as Reginald Leeper (then ambassador in Argentina) and Wilfred Eady, representative of several railway companies in Argentina, started to make the arrangements for the sale of their companies to the Argentine state.
