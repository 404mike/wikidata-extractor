The UVF also shot up the  Ulster Democratic Party headquarters on the Middle Shankill. An hour later Adair's unit burned down the PUP's offices close to Agnes Street, the de facto border between the UVF-dominated Middle and Upper Shankill and the UDA-dominated Lower Shankill. The UVF responded by blowing up the UDP headquarters on the Middle Shankill. Adair was returned to prison by the Secretary of State on 14 September, although the feud continued with four more killed before the end of the year.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, pp. 332-334 Violence also spread to North Belfast, where members of the UVF's Mount Vernon unit shot and killed a UDA member, David Greer, in the Tiger's Bay area, sparking a series of killings in that part of the city. In another incident the County Londonderry town of Coleraine saw tumult in the form of an attempted expulsion of UVF members by UDA members, which was successfully resisted by the UVF.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 335 But, aside from these exceptions, Adair's attempt to ignite a full-scale war between the two organisations failed, as both the UVF and UDA leaderships moved decisively to contain the trouble within the Shankill area, where hundreds of families had been displaced, and focused on dealing with its source as well as its containment. To Adair's indignation even the \"A\" and \"B\" Companies of his West Belfast Brigade of the UDA declined to get involved in C Company's war with the UVF. Eventually a ceasefire was reluctantly agreed upon by the majority of those involved in the feuding after new procedures were established with the aim of preventing the escalation of any future problems between the two organisations, and after consideration was paid to the advice of Gary McMichael and David Ervine, the then leaders of the two political wings of loyalism.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 340"]}, {"page": "Lisburn", "response": ["* Gary McMichael  (1969 \u2013 ) \u2013 Ulster Democratic Party leader."]}, {"page": "Ulster Democratic Party", "response": ["In the early years the party's electoral support was limited.

The party's two candidates in the 1982 Assembly election in Belfast North similarly failed to make an impact. It was not until the 1989 local elections that the party made its electoral breakthrough, when Ken Kerr won a seat on Derry City Council, in the Waterside area. Around that time, the UDP dropped the \"Loyalist\" part of its name. Although Kerr lost his council seat in 1993, Gary McMichael\u2014son of the late John McMichael, who had been assassinated in 1987\u2014won a seat on Lisburn City Council for the party.

Although it failed to win any constituency seats, as one of the ten most successful parties it was awarded two \"top-up\" seats; these were taken by Gary McMichael and John White. This entitled the party to a place in the all-party talks that led to the 1998 Belfast Agreement.
