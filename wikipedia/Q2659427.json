William Edie summarizes \"To Priscillian, therefore, in all probability, must be attributed the origin of the gloss in this its original and heretical form. Afterwards it was brought into harmony with the orthodox doctrine of the Trinity by the omission of the words in Christo Jesu and the Substitution of tres for tria.\" The Review of Theology and Philosophy The Comma Joanneum p.169, 1906.

Chapman saw an indication that Priscillian found himself bound to defend the comma by citing from the \"Unity of the Church\" Cyprian section.\"It seems plain that the passage of St, Cyprian was lying open before the Priscillianist author of the Creed (Priscillian himself?) because he was accustomed to appeal to it in the same way.
