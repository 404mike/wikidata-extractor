All three plays starred Paul Daneman as Henry and Rosalind Boxall as Margaret, with 3 Henry VI featuring Alan Bridges as Edward and Edgar Wreford as Richard. Although little was removed from the text, it did end differently from the written play. After Edward has spoken his last lines, everyone leaves the stage except Richard, who walks towards the throne, then turns and looks out to the audience, speaking the first thirty lines of his opening speech from Richard III (from \"Now is the winter of our discontent\" to \"I am determin'd to prove a villain\"), at which point the curtain falls. Additionally, in this production, Boxall as Margaret fully participated in the Battle of Tewkesbury, which was considered a bold move at the time.", "The success of the 1951\u20131953 Douglas Seale stand-alone productions of each of the individual plays in Birmingham prompted him to present the three plays together at the Old Vic in 1957 under the general title The Wars of the Roses. Barry Jackson adapted the text, altering the trilogy into a two-part play; 1 Henry VI and 2 Henry VI were combined (with almost all of 1 Henry VI eliminated) and 3 Henry VI was edited down, with most of Act 4 removed, thus reducing the importance of Edward in the overall play. Seale again directed, with Paul Daneman again appearing as Henry, Alan Bridges as Edward and Edgar Wreford as Richard, alongside Barbara Jefford as Margaret. As with Seale's 1953 Birmingham production, the end of 3 Henry VI was altered to include the opening of Richard III."]}, {"page": "List of The Avengers (TV series) episodes", "response": ["| Edgar Wreford, Royston Tickner, Robert Hartley, Dallas Cavell"]}, {"page": "List of The Avengers and The New Avengers cast members", "response": ["* Edgar Wreford"]}, {"page": "Wreford", "response": ["*Edgar Wreford (1923\u20132006), English actor"]}, {"page": "Denville Hall", "response": ["*Edgar Wreford"]}, {"page": "Suspended Alibi", "response": ["* Edgar Wreford as Prison Chaplain"]}, {"page": "Crane (TV series)", "response": ["11.
