Analytic philosophers Alvin Plantinga and Nicholas Wolterstorff develop this view. Plantinga holds that an individual may rationally believe in God even though the individual does not possess sufficient evidence to convince an agnostic. One difference between reformed epistemology and fideism is that the former requires defence against known objections, whereas the latter might dismiss such objections as irrelevant. Plantinga has developed reformed epistemology in Warranted Christian Belief as a form of externalism that holds that the justification conferring factors for a belief may include external factors. Some theistic philosophers have defended theism by granting evidentialism but supporting theism through deductive arguments whose premises are considered justifiable. Some of these arguments are probabilistic, either in the sense of having weight but being inconclusive, or in the sense of having a mathematical probability assigned to them. Notable in this regard are the cumulative arguments presented by British philosopher Basil Mitchell and analytic philosopher Richard Swinburne, whose arguments are based on Bayesian probability. In a notable exposition of his arguments, Swinburne appeals to an inference for the best explanation."]}, {"page": "Index of philosophy articles (A\u2013C)", "response": ["* Basil Mitchell (academic)"]}, {"page": "John Bampton", "response": ["*1992 Basil Mitchell, Faith and Criticism"]}, {"page": "Gifford Lectures", "response": ["*1974-76 Basil Mitchell Morality, Religious and Secular"]}, {"page": "Noor Inayat Khan", "response": ["After the outbreak of the Second World War, when France was invaded by German troops, the family fled to Bordeaux and, from there by sea, to England, landing at Falmouth in Cornwall, on 22 June 1940.

The theory asserts that language must be understood in terms of a game: just as each game has its own rules determining what can and cannot be done, so each context of language has its own rules determining what is and is not meaningful. Religion is classified as a possible and legitimate language game which is meaningful within its own context. Various parables have also been proposed to solve the problem of meaning in religious language. R. M. Hare used his parable of a lunatic to introduce the concept of \"bliks\"\u00a0\u2013 unfalsifiable beliefs according to which a worldview is established\u00a0\u2013 which are not necessarily meaningless. Basil Mitchell used a parable to show that faith can be logical, even if it seems unverifiable. John Hick used his parable of the Celestial City to propose his theory of eschatological verification, the view that if there is an afterlife, then religious statements will be verifiable after death.", "===Basil Mitchell===", "Basil Mitchell responded to Flew's falsification principle with his own parable. He described an underground resistance soldier who meets a stranger who claims to be leading the resistance movement. The stranger tells the soldier to keep faith in him, even if he is seen to be fighting for the other side. The soldier's faith is regularly tested as he observes the stranger fighting for both sides, but his faith remains strong. Mitchell's parable teaches that although evidence can challenge a religious belief, a believer still has reason to hold their views. He argued that although a believer will not allow anything to count decisively against his beliefs, the theist still accepts the existence of evidence which could count against religious belief."]}, {"page": "1917 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 9 April \u2013 Basil Mitchell, philosopher (died 2011) "]}, {"page": "British Society for the Philosophy of Religion", "response": ["* Basil Mitchell"]}, {"page": "Illtyd Trethowan", "response": ["It was a position that took its distance from the standard empiricism of his day which characterized much English-language academic philosophy of religion [e.g. Basil Mitchell, Antony Flew, Alasdair MacIntyre, and Richard Swinburne].
