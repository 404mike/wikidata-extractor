The storyline was devised by Brookside creator Phil Redmond and executive producer Mal Young. Friel had impressed the producers with her strong acting performance and they decided to reward her with a challenging storyline. They decided that Beth would explore her sexuality and they chose Margaret to feature in her story. Young told Tibballs that \"Beth became the first lipstick lesbian and pairing her with Margaret worked because nobody would have expected it of Margaret, least of all Margaret herself.\" Writers began to develop the storyline with the creation of a close friendship between the two characters. As they bond, Beth begins to develop romantic feelings for Margaret. During the show's Christmas episodes of 1993, Beth's feelings intensify. Originally, Redmond was unsure about the storyline because it was then a taboo subject. Scriptwriter Shaun Duggan wrote the episodes featuring the kiss and those that preceded it. He wanted representation and was determined to get the story on television because he had recently come out."]}, {"page": "List of EastEnders crew members", "response": ["*Shaun Duggan (2003\u20132006)"]}, {"page": "Accused (2010 TV series)", "response": ["In January 2012 it was confirmed that Anna Maxwell Martin would join Sheehan and Bishop in the second episode.
