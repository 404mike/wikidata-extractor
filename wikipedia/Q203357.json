He enjoyed a successful junior career before turning professional in 2011.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ding Junhui", "response": ["Ding's best performances during the 2020\u201321 season were reaching the quarter-finals of four ranking tournaments as well as the quarter-finals of the Champion of Champions. His season ended with a 9\u201310 loss to Stuart Bingham in the first round of the 2021 World Snooker Championship. By late 2021, he had won just one ranking event in the previous four years, had missed many tournaments through choice or circumstance, and had struggled to practice while spending long stretches of time in China during the COVID-19 pandemic. His position in the top 16 was largely supported by his prize money from winning the 2019 UK Championship, which ceased to count toward his ranking after two years. After he lost 3\u20136 to world number 55 Sam Craigie in the last 64 of the 2021 UK Championship, he fell out of the top 16 in the world rankings, meaning that he did not qualify for the Masters for the first time since he was 18 years old in 2006. Speaking on BBC Two after the loss to Craigie, seven-time world champion Stephen Hendry expressed concern about Ding's future in the sport: \"I don't know what has happened to Ding. I don't know whether we have seen the best of him. He looks like he doesn't really care that much anymore... Any pressure balls he does not look like getting anymore. I don't know where Ding goes from here.\" After Ding lost 3\u20134 to world number 65 Zhang Anda in the qualifying round of the Scottish Open, pundit Alan McManus echoed Hendry's concerns, stating that Ding had \"big problems to fix.\" Following the Scottish Open, Ding fell to 29th in the world rankings."]}, {"page": "John Higgins", "response": ["Higgins played Ronnie O'Sullivan in the final and was 5\u20134 down after the first session, but returned to take six of the next eight frames and win his second title in a week.

Higgins forced a deciding frame in the quarter-finals of the UK Championship after having trailed Selby 3\u20130, but lost it. He closed out 2016 by beating O'Sullivan 5\u20132 in the quarter-finals of the Scottish Open and then came back from 5\u20131 down to Judd Trump to win the semi-final 6\u20135. He opened the final against Marco Fu with three centuries and built a 4\u20131 lead, but lost eight frames in a row to be defeated 9\u20134.

Being an asthmatic, Hamilton had criticised the decision to allow a limited number of spectators into the Crucible in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. Defending champion Judd Trump said Hamilton should have made his decision earlier because, by participating in the qualifiers despite knowing there would be spectators in the final stages, he had denied a place to another player. This was despite government advice changing after qualifying entries had been announced."]}, {"page": "Robert Milkins", "response": ["Milkins reached the second ranking event semi-final of his career in the 2012 World Open.

He defeated Jin Long 5\u20132, before dispatching reigning world champion John Higgins 5\u20133 in the quarter-finals.
