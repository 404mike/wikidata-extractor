Gordon Childe", "response": ["Other Marxists\u2014such as George Derwent Thomson and Neil Faulkner\u2014argued that Childe's archaeological work was not truly Marxist because he failed to take into account class struggle as an instrument of social change, a core tenet of Marxist thought. While class struggle was not a factor Childe considered in his archaeological work, he accepted that historians and archaeologists typically interpreted the past through their own class interests, arguing that most of his contemporaries produced studies with an innate bourgeois agenda. Childe further diverged from orthodox Marxism by not employing dialectics in his methodology. He also denied Marxism's ability to predict the future development of human society, and\u2014unlike many other Marxists\u2014did not consider humanity's progress into pure communism inevitable, instead opining that society could fossilize or become extinct."]}, {"page": "S.

The 2005 anniversary of 1905 led to his conceiving a major project to make available a mass of new material in English. Glatter became aware that there was a rich collection of primary sources including autobiographical accounts, some of them collected for the twentieth anniversary in 1925 that could illuminate the events and their dynamics. He therefore gained agreement to translate and publish these in a book length issue of Revolutionary History, which in addition contains articles and data on strikes and the Rosa Luxemburg\u2019s analysis of 1905. Making these sources available in English and a good translation was a major achievement and this will stand as a monument to his work and the potential that was soon to be lost. He then began work with the archaeologist Neil Faulkner on a project on the crisis of 1914-1921."]}, {"page": "Wareham Town Museum", "response": ["The museum has a special section on Lawrence of Arabia, who lived close by at Clouds Hill, now maintained by National Trust.
