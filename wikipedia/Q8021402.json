His only league appearance for the Clarets came as a substitute for Dave Thomas in the 2\u20133 defeat away at West Bromwich Albion on 24 August 1968. In July 1969, he moved to Carlisle United on a free transfer, but was sent on loan to Barrow in September 1969, scoring once in 6 league games. He returned to Carlisle, scoring 8 goals in 19 league games that season, before leaving for Newport County in August 1970 for a fee of \u00a31,500.\nHe fitted into the Newport side and became a regular goalscorer, scoring 50 goals in 168 league appearances. Towards the end of the 1973\u201374 season, Brown found himself out of favour at Newport, joining Hereford United on loan in March 1974, scoring 6 goals in only 9 league games for the Bulls.\nIn November 1974 he joined Brentford for a fee of \u00a34,000, and although he scored 9 times in 16 league games he failed to settle in London and joined Torquay United in March 1975 for a fee of \u00a35,000.
