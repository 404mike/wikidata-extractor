After taking over the family business in 1975, the subsequent popularity of their haggis led to his opening the world's first purpose-built haggis factory, and the sale of the butchers company. In the 1970s Macsween took samples to London, and soon received orders for Macsween haggis from  major buyers including Selfridges, Harrods, and Fortnum & Mason.Macsween started to produce what was described as a vegetarian haggis in 1984, after a request from the Burns Supper at the Scottish Poetry Library.Macsween married Kate Mackay, the daughter of a former Lord Provost of Edinburgh, in 1964. His wife and his four children survived him at this death, and Macsween haggis continued to be produced, sold under both the Macsween name and as supermarkets' own brands.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "McSween", "response": ["* John MacSween (), Scottish nobleman", "* John MacSween (haggis entrepreneur) (19392006), Scottish butcher and entrepreneur", ":* MacSween, a Scottish company founded by John MacSween, known for making haggis"]}, {"page": "John MacSween (disambiguation)", "response": ["John MacSween may refer to:", "*John MacSween (haggis entrepreneur) (died 2006), Scottish butcher and entrepreneur"]}]}}
