He joined Brighton & Hove Albion from Vernon Athletic in 1940 as an amateur, and turned professional three years later. In March 1943, he joined the RAF, and when competitive football resumed after the war, he made his debut in the Third Division South in October 1946. He broke his wrist a year later, losing his place to Harry Baldwin, and the two shared the position until 1952 when Baldwin left the club. Ball himself left in 1953 and joined Hastings United of the Southern League. He helped that club reach the third round of the FA Cup in both 1953\u201354 and 1954\u201355, and remained on their books until the early 1960s. He continued living in Hove, and died in Brighton in 1999."]}]}}
