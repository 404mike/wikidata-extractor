In their 1970 publication Dickens the Novelist, F R and Q D Leavis called Dickens \"one of the greatest of creative writers\", and F R Leavis had changed his mind about Dickens since his 1948 work, no longer finding the popularity of the novels with readers as a barrier to their seriousness or profundity. In 1968 Sylv\u00e8re Monod, after having finely analyzed the structure and style of the novel, describe it as \"the triumph of the art of Dickens\", which analysis was shared by Paul B Davis. The central themes are explored by Richard Dunne in 1981, including the autobiographical dimension, the narrator-hero characterization process, memory and forgetting, and finally the privileged status of the novel in the interconnection between similar works of Dickens. Q D Leavis compares Copperfield to Tolstoy's War and Peace and looks at adult-child relationships in both novels. According to writer Paul B Davis, Q. D. Leavis excels at dissecting David's relationship with Dora. Gwendolyn Needham in an essay, published in 1954, analyzes the novel as a bildungsroman, as did Jerome H Buckley twenty years later. In 1987 Alexander Welsh devoted several chapters to show that Copperfield is the culmination of Dickens' autobiographical attempts to explore himself as a novelist in the middle of his career. Finally, J B Priestley was particularly interested in Mr Micawber and concludes that \"With the one exception of Falstaff, he is the greatest comic figure in English literature\".", "David Copperfield has pleased many writers. Charlotte Bront\u00eb, for example, commented in 1849 in a letter to the reader of her publisher: I have read David Copperfield; it seems to me very good\u2014admirable in some parts. You said it had affinity to Jane Eyre: it has\u2014now and then\u2014only what an advantage has Dickens in his varied knowledge of men and things!Charlotte Bront\u00eb, Letter to W S Williams, 13 September 1849, cited by  Tolstoy, for his part, considered it \"the best work of the best English novelist\" and, according to F. R. and Q. D. Leavis, was inspired by David and Dora's love story to have Prince Andrew marry Princess Lise in War and Peace. Henry James remembered being moved to tears, while listening to the novel, hidden under a table, read aloud in the family circle. Dostoevsky enthusiastically cultivated the novel in a prison camp in Siberia. Franz Kafka wrote in his diary in 1917, that the first chapter of his novel Amerika was inspired by David Copperfield.Kafka's novel is a kind of inverted bildungsroman, since the young man whose destiny we follow is more of a disaster than an accomplishment. James Joyce parodied it in Ulysses. Virginia Woolf, who was not very fond of Dickens, states that David Copperfield, along with Robinson Crusoe, Grimm's fairy tales, Scott's Waverley and Pickwick's Posthumous Papers, \"are not books, but stories communicated by word of mouth in those tender years when fact and fiction merge, and thus belong to the memories and myths of life, and not to its esthetic experience.\" Woolf also noted in a letter to Hugh Walpole in 1936, that she is re-reading it for the sixth time: \"I'd forgotten how magnificent it is.\"Virginia Woolf, Letter to Hugh Walpole, 8 February 1936. It also seems that the novel was Sigmund Freud's favourite; and Somerset Maugham sees it as a \"great\" work, although his hero seems to him rather weak, unworthy even of its author, while Mr Micawber never disappoints: \"The most remarkable of them is, of course, Mr Micawber. He never fails you.\""]}, {"page": "P. G. Wodehouse", "response": ["Wodehouse received great praise from many of his contemporaries, including Max Beerbohm, Rudyard Kipling, A. E. Housman and Evelyn Waugh\u2014the last of whom opines, \"One has to regard a man as a Master who can produce on average three uniquely brilliant and entirely original similes on each page.\"Wodehouse and Ratcliffe, p. 27 There are dissenters to the praise. The writer Alan Bennett thinks that \"inspired though his language is, I can never take more than ten pages of the novels at a time, their relentless flippancy wearing and tedious\",Bennett, p. 356 while the literary critic Q. D. Leavis writes that Wodehouse had a \"stereotyped humour\u00a0... of ingenious variations on a laugh in one place\".Leavis, p. 263 In a 2010 study of Wodehouse's few relatively serious novels, such as The Coming of Bill (1919), Jill the Reckless (1920) and The Adventures of Sally (1922), David Heddendorf concludes that though their literary quality does not match that of the farcical novels, they show a range of empathy and interests that in real life\u2014and in his most comic works\u2014the author seemed to lack. \"Never oblivious to grief and despair, he opts in clear-eyed awareness for his timeless world of spats and woolly-headed peers. It's an austere, almost bloodless preference for pristine artifice over the pain and messy outcomes of actual existence, but it's a case of Wodehouse keeping faith with his own unique art.\"Heddendorf, David. \"When Plummie Met Sally\u2014The Other P.G. Wodehouse\", Sewanee Review, Vol. 118, No. 3, Summer 2010, pp. 411\u2013416, Project Muse. "]}, {"page": "Great Expectations", "response": ["Overall, Great Expectations received near universal acclaim. Not all reviews were favourable, however; Margaret Oliphant's review, published May 1862 in Blackwood's Magazine, vilified the novel. Critics in the 19th and 20th centuries hailed it as one of Dickens's greatest successes although often for conflicting reasons: GK Chesterton admired the novel's optimism; Edmund Wilson its pessimism; Humphry House in 1941 emphasized its social context. In 1974, Jerome H. Buckley saw it as a bildungsroman, writing a chapter on Dickens and two of his major protagonists (David Copperfield and Pip) in his 1974 book on the Bildungsroman in Victorian writing. John Hillis Miller wrote in 1958 that Pip is the archetype of all Dickensian heroes. In 1970, Q. D. Leavis suggested \"How We Must Read Great Expectations.\" In 1984, Peter Brooks, in the wake of Jacques Derrida, offered a deconstructionist reading. The most profound analyst, according to Paul Schlicke, is probably Julian Moynahan, who, in a 1964 essay surveying the hero's guilt, made Orlick \"Pip's double, alter ego and dark mirror image.\" Schlicke also names Anny Sadrin's extensive 1988 study as the \"most distinguished.\""]}, {"page": "1932 in literature", "response": ["*Q.

Leavis said of Crabbe: \"He is (or ought to be\u2014for who reads him?) a living classic.\" His classic status was also supported by T. S. Eliot in an essay on the poetry of Samuel Johnson in which Eliot grouped Crabbe together favourably with Johnson, Pope and several other poets. Eliot said that \"to have the virtues of good prose is the first and minimum requirement of good poetry.\" Critic Arthur Pollard believes that Crabbe definitely met this qualification. Critic William Caldwell Roscoe, answering William Hazlitt's question of why Crabbe had not in fact written prose rather than verse said \"have you ever read Crabbe's prose? Look at his letters, especially the later ones, look at the correct but lifeless expression of his dedications and prefaces\u2014then look at his verse, and you will see how much he has exceeded 'the minimum requirement of good poetry'.\" The critic F. L. Lucas summed up Crabbe's qualities: \"na\u00efve, yet shrewd; straightforward, yet sardonic; blunt, yet tender; quiet, yet passionate; realistic, yet romantic.\" Crabbe, who is seen as a complicated poet, has been and often still is dismissed as too narrow in his interests and in his way of responding to them in his poetry. \"At the same time as the critic is making such judgments, he is all too often aware that Crabbe, nonetheless, defies classification\", says Pollard."]}, {"page": "Richard Jefferies", "response": ["* Q.
