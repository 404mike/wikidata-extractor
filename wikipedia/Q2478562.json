In 1966 his parents, Brian and Eithne Vallely had founded the Armagh Piper's Club, but he chose to learn the concertina instead, from the age of seven. His brother Cillian plays the uillean pipes and low whistle, learning from Mark Donnelly. Another of his brothers, Caoimhin, plays classical piano, tin whistle and fiddle.  In 1990, Vallely founded the group Nomos, which released two albums before breaking up in 2000. In 1992, Vallely completed a degree in music at University College, Cork. \nIn 1998, Vallely released a solo album of contemporary and traditional tunes from Ireland and Scotland. He also produced and composed the tunes for Karan Casey's album for children The Seal Maiden. Niall and Karan married in Barga, Italy in 2007. He appears on some of her albums. In 1999, he released his debut solo album, Beyond Words, and in 2003 Callan Bridge with his brother Cillian on uilleann pipes. Over the past few years Vallely has also been spending a lot of time writing new music.  In 2007, he was commissioned by the BBC to compose music for a major TV series, The Flight of the Earls. The resulting piece was then premiered at the Grand Opera House in Belfast as part of the Belfast Festival at Queens and had a subsequent performance at the Irish College in Louvain, Belgium, as part of their Flight of the Earls celebrations.  In 2008, he composed an electro-acoustic piece entitled \"Rakish\" based on the music of travelling piper Johnny Doran which was premiered at the William Kennedy Piping Festival in Armagh. Recent commissions have included pieces for cellist Kate Ellis, Zo\u00eb Conway, and the Vanbrugh String Quartet.\nIn 2004 he formed Buille with his brother Caoimh\u00edn Vallely (piano) and guitarist Paul Meehan.  They released their debut album in 2005 on the Vertical Records label.  They released their second album in 2009, entitled Buille 2.  It featured a diverse range of guests including brother Cillian on uilleann pipes, Zo\u00eb Conway on fiddle, Cian O\u2019Duill on viola, Kate Ellis on cello, Neil Yates on trumpet and flugelhorn, Ed Boyd and Paul Meehan on guitars and Brian Morrissey on bodhr\u00e1n, percussion and banjo.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Karan Casey", "response": ["Casey left Solas at the beginning of 1999 to pursue her solo ambitions. She then moved back to Ireland, although frequently travelled between her home in Cork and America. In 2000, she collaborated with several other vocalists on Seal Maiden: a Celtic Musical. It concerned the mythical creature called the selkie (in this case, a seal-woman). The album featured a story written by Irish playwright Marina Carr narrated by Casey, produced by Niall Vallely and Leib Ostrow, and featured contributions from Martin Hayes & Dennis Cahill, Iarla \u00d3 Lionaird, M\u00e1ir\u00e9ad N\u00ed Mhaonaigh, Michael McGoldrick, Mel Mercier and Robbie Overson.", "In 2001, Casey finished working on her second solo album, The Winds Begin to Sing (2001) which was well received by critics and propelled her into a stable solo career. She released Distant Shore in 2003 and toured extensively throughout the Americas and Europe. In 2005, Casey released Chasing the Sun featuring Irish traditional and folk songs which she learned from her mother and maternal grandmother. The album included a number of songs written by Casey herself as well as songs by Belfast musician Barry Kerr. The album was well received and was the last to be released on the Shanachie and Vertical labels so that Casey, husband Niall Vallely and other associated acts could release her music independently.", "Released in 2014, Two More Hours was Casey's sixth solo album and her first entirely self-penned work. Contemporary in tone, it takes a much more personal approach to her writing and singing. It features a duet with Irish chart-topper Mick Flannery as well as contributions from Abigail Washburn and Aoife O\u2019Donovan, and was produced by Niall Vallely. A departure from the traditional music she has focused on for many years, Two More Hours draws on Casey's lifelong love of R&B, jazz and blues in creating a vibrant new mix of sounds.  Vallely's string arrangements help meld together a cast of Ireland's musicians from the worlds of classical, folk and rock music including Ken Rice, Kate Ellis, Sean Og Graham (of Beoga), Trevor Hutchinson, Eoghan Regan, Danny Byrt and Caoimh\u00edn Vallely.", "In 2019 she released her latest album Hieroglyphs That Tell the Tale on the Vertical Records Label. Produced by renowned Scottish producer and BAFTA-nominated composer Donald Shaw, the album also features Karan's long-time musical collaborators Sean \u00d3g Graham & Niamh Dunne (Beoga), Kate Ellis (The Crash Ensemble) and Niall Vallely (Buille). \u00a0Drawing inspiration from contemporary folk writers Janis Ian, Eliza Gilkyson, Mick Flannery and Bob Dylan, the album displays Casey's impressive talent as a songwriter. She is joined on vocals by some of the women singers she's long-admired, including Karen Matheson, Niamh Dunne, Pauline Scanlon, Maura O'Connell and Aoife O Donovan. \u00a0", "Casey is married to Irish concertina player Niall Vallely and has collaborated frequently with the Vallely brothers and their bands.

The collaboration came about after RT\u00c9 contacted contemporary Irish composer Niall Vallely, requesting he composed music for a traditional group, and Vallely in turn requested L\u00fanasa for a collaboration, bringing the two ensembles together for a fusion between traditional and classical music. After the two groups performed at the National Concert Hall, Dublin, in April 2012, they recorded the album later in the year.", "The genesis for the collaboration between L\u00fanasa and the RT\u00c9 Concert Orchestra came when contemporary Irish composer Niall Vallely was asked by Irish service broadcaster RT\u00c9 to curate arrangements for usage in a traditional band. According to one biography, Vallely was \"the perfect fit for this adventurous undertaking\" due to having composed both traditional and classical compositions. Vallely suggested Celtic folk group L\u00fanasa, which features his brother Cillian Vallely on pipes, for the project, and the project subsequently evolved into L\u00fanasa playing with the RT\u00c9 Concert Orchestra, conducted by David Brophy, creating an unusual fusion between traditional and classical music. One biography noted that the collaboration allowed Niall to expand L\u00fanasa's \"innovative use of harmony and rhythm,\" taking advantage of the harmonic and rhythmic potential of \"the full orchestral sound. The result is truly a new sound in Irish music.\"", "L\u00fanasa's collaboration with the RT\u00c9 Concert Orchestra allowed L\u00fanasa to reuse music that they had retired many years before. \"A number of the pieces had been banished to the wilderness,\" explained Crawford, \"destined never to see the light of a L\u00fanasa day ever again. Getting the opportunity to dust them down and hear them in a totally new environment gave the tunes a whole new lease of life and reawakened our love and respect for them. It's an experience I certainly never thought I'd encounter as a traditional Irish musician.\" According to Rob Adams of the Herald Scotland, the collaboration allowed Niall Vallely to discover L\u00fanasa's performance dynamic: \"As [Niall Vallely] found when writing the score for their recent collaboration with the RTE Concert Orchestra, Lunasa makes a very complete sound in its own right without over-playing or driving the music too hard.\"", "*Niall Vallely \u2013 arrangements"]}]}}
