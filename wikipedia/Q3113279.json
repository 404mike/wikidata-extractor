Balzac quickly turned to longer works, and by 1826 he had written nine novels, all published under pseudonyms and often produced in collaboration with other writers. For example, the scandalous novel Vicaire des Ardennes (1822)\u2014banned for its depiction of nearly-incestuous relations and, more egregiously, of a married priest\u2014attributed to a \"Horace de Saint-Aubin\".Robb, 103 These books were potboiler novels, designed to sell quickly and titillate audiences. In Saintsbury's view, \"they are curiously, interestingly, almost enthrallingly bad\". Saintsbury indicates that Robert Louis Stevenson tried to dissuade him from reading these early works of Balzac. American critic Samuel Rogers, however, notes that \"without the training they gave Balzac, as he groped his way to his mature conception of the novel, and without the habit he formed as a young man of writing under pressure, one can hardly imagine his producing La Com\u00e9die Humaine\".Rogers, 23 Biographer Graham Robb suggests that as he discovered the Novel, Balzac discovered himself.Robb, 63", "Balzac's work habits were legendary. He wrote from 1 am to 8 am every morning and sometimes even longer. Balzac could write very rapidly; some of his novels, written with a quill, were composed at a pace equal to thirty words per minute on a modern typewriter.Balzac, A Biography, Graham Robb, p. 243 His preferred method was to eat a light meal at five or six in the afternoon, then sleep until midnight. He then rose and wrote for many hours, fueled by innumerable cups of black coffee. He often worked for fifteen hours or more at a stretch; he claimed to have once worked for 48 hours with only three hours of rest in the middle."]}, {"page": "Duff Cooper Prize", "response": ["*2007 \u2013 Graham Robb, The Discovery of France"]}, {"page": "Baillie Gifford Prize", "response": ["* Graham Robb, Rimbaud (about Arthur Rimbaud)"]}, {"page": "Cagot", "response": ["Graham Robb finds most of the above theories unlikely:"]}, {"page": "P\u00e8re Goriot", "response": ["Le P\u00e8re Goriot is widely considered Balzac's essential novel. Its influence on French literature has been considerable, as shown by novelist F\u00e9licien Marceau's remark: \"We are all children of Le P\u00e8re Goriot.\"Quoted in Oliver, p. 149. Brooks refers to its \"perfection of form, its economy of means and ends\".Brooks (1998), p. ix. Martin Kanes, meanwhile, in his book Le P\u00e9re Goriot: Anatomy of a Troubled World, calls it \"the keystone of the Com\u00e9die humaine\".Kanes, p. 9.

Studies in Balzac's Realism. E. P. Dargan, ed. New York: Russell & Russell, 1932. Because it has become such an important novel for the study of French literature, Le P\u00e8re Goriot has been translated many times into many languages. Thus, says Balzac biographer Graham Robb, \"Goriot is one of the novels of La Com\u00e9die humaine that can safely be read in English for what it is.\"Robb, p. 258. On the other hand, when Michal Peled Ginsberg conducted a survey of professors in preparation for his book Approaches to Teaching Balzac's Old Goriot, participants complained that the most-used translation by Marion Ayton Crawford is \"not very good but [they] say they cannot come up with an alternative\": Ginsberg, p. 4."]}, {"page": "Bondy", "response": ["Bondy and its integration into Paris is the subject of part of the second-last chapter of Graham Robb's book Parisians."]}, {"page": "Royal Society of Literature", "response": ["| Graham Robb"]}, {"page": "Royal Grammar School Worcester", "response": ["*Graham Robb (born 1958) Author"]}, {"page": "1997 Whitbread Awards", "response": ["*Graham Robb, Victor Hugo"]}, {"page": "Illuminations (poetry collection)", "response": ["The collection consists overwhelmingly of prose poems, which number forty of the forty-two poems. The two exceptions are \"Marine\" and \"Mouvement\", which are vers libre. These two poems are remarkable not only as exceptions within Illuminations itself, but as two of the first free verse poems written in the French language. Within the genres of prose poetry and vers libre, the poems of Illuminations bear many stylistic distinctions. Though influenced by the earlier prose poems of Charles Baudelaire, the prose poems differ starkly from Baudelaire's in that they lack prosaic elements such as linear storytelling and transitions. Because of these differences, Rimbaud's prose poems are denser and more poetic than Baudelaire's. These differences also contribute to the surrealist quality of Illuminations. Though Rimbaud predated surrealism, he is said to have written in a surrealistic style due to the hallucinatory, dreamlike aspect of many of the poems. Another aspect of Rimbaud's style, which also contributes to the visionary quality of the poems, is his use of words for their evocative quality rather than their literal meaning.\"Illuminations.\" Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of Literature. In addition to these stylistic qualities, Illuminations is rich with sensory imagery. A puzzling aspect of Rimbaud's style is his use of foreign words within the French text of Illuminations. For example, the poem \"Being Beauteous\" has an English title, even in the original French. Rimbaud biographer Graham Robb suggests that the presence of words from languages like English and German are due in part to Rimbaud's travels. Apparently, as he learned languages, Rimbaud kept lists of words he wished to use in poems.Robb, Graham (2000). Rimbaud.

Whether due to the intensity of its creation or the tumult of his personal life, the author was surprised by the praise he received. He wrote: \"I did not realize how good La Cousine Bette is\u00a0... There is an immense reaction in my favour. I have won!\"Quoted in Maurois, p. 487. See also Gerson, p. 335. The collected edition sold consistently well, and was reprinted nineteen times before the turn of the 20th century. 20th-century critics remain enthusiastic in their praise for the novel; Saintsbury insists it is \"beyond all question one of the very greatest of [Balzac's] works\". Biographer Graham Robb calls La Cousine Bette \"the masterpiece of his premature old age\".Robb, p. 256."]}, {"page": "La Peau de chagrin", "response": ["Balzac mined his own life for details in the first parts of La Peau de Chagrin, and he likely modeled the protagonist Rapha\u00ebl de Valentin on himself. Details recounted by Valentin of his impoverished living quarters are autobiographical allusions to Balzac's earliest days as an author: \"Nothing could be uglier than this garret, awaiting its scholar, with its dingy yellow walls and odor of poverty. The roofing fell in a steep slope, and the sky was visible through chinks in the tiles. There was room for a bed, a table, and a few chairs, and beneath the highest point of the roof my piano could stand.\"Balzac, p. 87. Although they allow for a degree of embellishment, biographers and critics agree that Balzac was drawing from his own experience.Hunt, p. 40; Bertault, p. viii; Gerson, pp. 29\u201330; Maurois, p. 178. Gerson writes: \"those who saw the garret, his sisters and Dr. Nacquart among them, agreed that he did not exaggerate.\" On the other hand, Balzac's most recent biographer, Graham Robb, suggests on pp. 54\u201356 that Balzac exaggerated the place's squalor in order to represent a home worthy of a struggling poet."]}, {"page": "Ninety-Three", "response": ["Joseph Stalin read Ninety-Three as a young seminarian in Georgia and the character of Cimourdain, a former priest, \"made a deep impression\" on him.From the Hugo biographer Graham Robb's introduction to Frank Lee Benedict's English translation of Ninety-Three, Carol & Graf Publishers, New York, 1988."]}, {"page": "List of Vanderbilt University people", "response": ["* Graham Robb FRSL (Ph.D 1986) \u2013 British author, The Discovery of France, Chevalier of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres"]}, {"page": "River Mimram", "response": ["Historically, the river has also been known by the name \"Maran\" and many maps from the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries mark the river's name as \"Mimram or Maran\".

The prefecture of Marne is Ch\u00e2lons-en-Champagne, formerly called Ch\u00e2lons-sur-Marne - with the name \"Ch\u00e2lons\" being etymologically derived from the name of the local Belgic tribe of the Catalauni.

Roger Pierrot's 1999 biography of Ha\u0144ska, however, contends that she was born in 1804.Pierrot, p. 14.
