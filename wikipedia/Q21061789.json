After the signing of Charlie Goode during the 2020 off-season saw Jeanvier demoted further down the pecking order, he departed the Community Stadium on a season-long loan on 3 September 2020. He suffered a season-ending ruptured anterior cruciate ligament injury in October 2020 and though he would have not been eligible to play if fit, Brentford won promotion to the Premier League after victory in the 2021 Championship playoff Final. By mid-November 2021, Jeanvier had returned to non-contact training."]}]}}
