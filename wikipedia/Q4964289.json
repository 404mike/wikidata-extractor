He proceeds to crawl his way towards the end of the tunnel, which ended in a very high ladder.

After Jacob struggles to the top of the ladder (momentarily contemplating giving up), and comes across a white palace in the desert. He is briefly united with Aysha and Toby before they individually meet the ruler of Locus. The 'ruler' is a being bearing the face of an old man and a beautiful woman. It loosely resembles Roman myth Janus in the way it guards a gate back to the 'normal' world. Its dual-personality (pessimistic and optimistic) also echo Janus's myth."]}, {"page": "Robert Lawson (screenwriter)", "response": ["*Dream/State \u2014 development and pilot scripting for a television series based on Brian Keaney's trilogy.
