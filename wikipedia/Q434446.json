Kidd argued that the \"evolution of society and of modern civilization\" is caused not by reason or science, but by the force of \"religious beliefs.\" The book had worldwide circulation and impacted the Social Gospel movement.\nKidd is reckoned as a founder of sociology as a discipline. Influenced by Darwinism and evolution, Kidd sought and found analogies between the evolution of human society and of the biological organism.Kidd's prolific writings had a major impact at the time. However, the world was so different after the First World War that Kidd's work became relegated to historical interest.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Social Darwinism", "response": ["The massive expansion in Western colonialism during the New Imperialism era fitted in with the broader notion of social Darwinism used from the 1870s onwards to account for the phenomenon of \"the Anglo-Saxon and latin overflowing his boundaries\", as phrased by the late-Victorian sociologist Benjamin Kidd in Social Evolution, published in 1894.Benjamin Kidd, Social Evolution, Kessinger Publishing, LLC, 2007, 400 pages, , p. 47.

Sociocultural evolutionism became the prevailing theory of early sociocultural anthropology and social commentary, and is associated with scholars like Auguste Comte, Edward Burnett Tylor, Lewis Henry Morgan, Benjamin Kidd, L. T. Hobhouse and Herbert Spencer. Such stage models and ideas of linear models of progress had a great influence not only on future evolutionary approaches in the social sciences and humanities, but also shaped public, scholarly, and scientific discourse surrounding the rising individualism and population thinking. Sociocultural evolutionism attempted to formalise social thinking along scientific lines, with the added influence from the biological theory of evolution. If organisms could develop over time according to discernible, deterministic laws, then it seemed reasonable that societies could as well. Human society was compared to a biological organism, and social science equivalents of concepts like variation, natural selection, and inheritance were introduced as factors resulting in the progress of societies. The idea of progress led to that of a fixed \"stages\" through which human societies progress, usually numbering threesavagery, barbarism, and civilizationbut sometimes many more. At that time, anthropology was rising as a new scientific discipline, separating from the traditional views of \"primitive\" cultures that was usually based on religious views."]}, {"page": "National Liberal Club", "response": ["*Benjamin Kidd, pioneering sociologist.D.P.

At a time of widespread revulsion at alleged German atrocities, Bryan linked evolution to Germany, and claimed that Darwinism provided a justification for the strong to dominate the weak and was therefore the source of German militarism. He drew on reports by the entomologist Vernon Kellogg of German officers discussing the Darwinian rationale for their declaration of war, and the sociologist Benjamin Kidd's book The Science of Power which contended that Nietzsche's philosophy represented an interpretation of Darwinism, to conclude that Nietzsche's and Darwin's ideas were the impetus for German nationalism and militarism. Bryan argued that Germany's militarism and \"barbarism\" came from their belief that the \"struggle for survival\" described in Darwin's On the Origin of Species applied to nations as well as to individuals, and that \"The same science that manufactured poisonous gases to suffocate soldiers is preaching that man has a brute ancestry and eliminating the miraculous and the supernatural from the Bible.\""]}, {"page": "October 1916", "response": ["* Died: Benjamin Kidd, British sociologist, author of Social Evolution (b. 1858)"]}, {"page": "George Chatterton-Hill", "response": ["George Chatterton-Hill (1883\u20131947) was the Irish writer of several books on evolution and sociology.
