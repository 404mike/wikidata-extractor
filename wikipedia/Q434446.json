Kidd argued that the \"evolution of society and of modern civilization\" is caused not by reason or science, but by the force of \"religious beliefs.\" The book had worldwide circulation and impacted the Social Gospel movement.\nKidd is reckoned as a founder of sociology as a discipline. Influenced by Darwinism and evolution, Kidd sought and found analogies between the evolution of human society and of the biological organism.Kidd's prolific writings had a major impact at the time. However, the world was so different after the First World War that Kidd's work became relegated to historical interest.", "link_mentions": {}}}
