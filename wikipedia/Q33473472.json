A deputation to the Minister of Health, John Wheatley, in 1924 included Dorothy Jewson, H.G. Wells, and Dr Frances Huxley, a gynaecologist and birth control supporter. Calling for birth control advice to be given to those who requested it, and for physicians to be allowed to give such advice when medically advisable, their requests were rejected by Wheatley, a Catholic.", "Many of the group's founders and members had already been active in the promotion of access to birth control prior to the group's formation, including Dora Russell - who, with John Maynard Keynes, had in 1923 paid the legal costs of Guy Aldred and Rose Witcop after they were found guilty of selling pamphlets on contraception. Witcop, along with Russell, Laski, Marjory Allen, Joan Malleson, and Leah L'Estrange Malone were signatories on the 1924 petition circulated by women members of the Labour Party and the Independent Labour Party outlining 'the large and growing demand among working mothers that information as to the methods of birth control be frankly, and decently given by public authority'. In addition to campaigning for increased access to contraception information from public health providers, members of the Workers' Birth Control Group lectured throughout the country on the subject of birth control.", "* Leah L'Estrange Malone"]}]}}
