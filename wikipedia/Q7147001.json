Oddly, in that game he was dismissed in both innings by a Test bowler who was to take seven wickets in that innings: first for a duck by Vallance Jupp, and then for 7 by Austin Matthews. Leeson made one catch, to dismiss another Test player, Fred Bakewell.\nLeeson bowled right arm off-breaks, but never sent down a delivery in first-class cricket.\nHe was born in Darjeeling, Bengal, India; he died in Leicester at the age of 81.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Leeson", "response": ["*Patrick Leeson, English cricketer"]}]}}
