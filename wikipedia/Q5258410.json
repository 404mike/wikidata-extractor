A winger, he scored 59 goals in 229 league appearances in an 11-year career in the Football League.\nA two-time FA Youth Cup winner with Manchester United, he turned professional at Manchester City in 1957. He joined Port Vale in May 1960, before being sold on to Grimsby Town for \u00a32,000 in October 1961. He was promoted out of the Third Division with the \"Mariners\" in 1961\u201362, before joining Halifax Town. He spent five years at the club, playing 143 league games, before transferring to Darlington in 1967. The next year he signed with Macclesfield Town, and won the Northern Premier League twice as well as the FA Trophy.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Norman Low", "response": ["Low prepared for the 1960\u201361 season by recruiting former Wales international inside-right Noel Kinsey from Birmingham City as a player-coach, and 21-year-old outside-left Dennis Fidler from the Manchester City Reserves. His \u00a310,000 offer for Aston Villa's Gerry Hitchens was rejected, whilst interest in re-signing Ronnie Allen also went nowhere. Low instead got 'bustling' Ted Calland on a free transfer from Exeter City, and sold Fred Donaldson to Exeter for \u00a32,000. In November he signed Bert Llewellyn from Crewe Alexandra for \u00a37,000. His team put in some memorable performances, including a 5\u20130 win over Grimsby Town at Blundell Park, in what Roy Sproson later described as his 'greatest memory' and 'one of their finest hours'; the performance was so impressive they received 'a standing ovation' from the home crowd, as the \"Valiants\" finished the game 'rolling the ball about like a game of chess'. Vale were in the promotion hunt until late in the season, as Low released Albert Leake and sold Stan Steele to West Bromwich Albion for \u00a310,000. Vale recorded a seventh-place finish, and Low ended the campaign by releasing Harry Oscroft (Brantham Athletic), Ted Calland (Lincoln City), John Poole (Macclesfield Town), and Peter Hall (Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic).", "He added to his squad for the 1961\u201362 campaign by spending \u00a32,000 on inside-forward Arthur Longbottom (Queens Park Rangers); \u00a310,000 on Stan Steele (back from West Brom); and \u00a32,000 on centre-half John Nicholson (Liverpool); whilst free signings included winger Stan Edwards (Everton), goalkeeper Peter Taylor (Middlesbrough), and Joe Maloney (Shrewsbury Town). He sold Cliff Portwood to Grimsby Town for \u00a36,000 to balance the books. The Sentinel commented that \"gloom has descended\" following a poor start to the season, however the Vale's form improved after Low sold Dennis Fidler to Grimsby Town for \u00a32,000, signed Colin Grainger from Leeds United for \u00a36,000, and further added to his firepower by signing Ralph Hunt from Swindon Town for \u00a33,500. Stanley Matthews' return to the Victoria Ground resulted in Low unsuccessfully trying to tempt Tom Finney out of retirement. The Vale finished in 12th place, and Low sold three players for \u00a32,000 each: Brian Jackson to Peterborough United, Ralph Hunt to Newport County, and David Raine to Doncaster Rovers."]}, {"page": "FA Youth Cup Finals of the 1950s", "response": ["1\u20131 90 min.
