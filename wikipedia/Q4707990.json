Like all good satire, there is a variety of interpretations of what the target might be. But it's undergirded by some scary set pieces to make it tense, brilliant direction by Alan Wareing, some thoughtful moments and a stunning performance by Ian Reddington as the Chief Clown. McCoy, guided by Classic Who's last great director, turns in a lovely, nuanced performance.\" Co-author Robert Smith stated \"this might be the ultimate McCoy story\" which \"showcases McCoy's quirky range\"."]}, {"page": "Christopher Guard", "response": ["| Alan Wareing"]}, {"page": "Neanderthals in popular culture", "response": ["| Ghost Light|| Alan Wareing  || TV series||a 1989 three-part serial in the television series Doctor Who, a Neanderthal called \"Nimrod\" (Carl Forgione) is the butler of a Victorian era household."]}, {"page": "List of EastEnders crew members", "response": ["*Alan Wareing (1986, 1990)"]}, {"page": "Wareing", "response": ["*Alan Wareing (born 1943), British television director"]}]}}
