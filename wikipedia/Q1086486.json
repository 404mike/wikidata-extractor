In 1928, he became professor of biology at Yale and founded several research institutes. He was convinced that bacteriophages were viruses despite opposition from established bacteriologists such as the Nobel Prize winner Jules Bordet (1870\u20131961). Bordet argued that bacteriophages were not viruses but just enzymes released from \"lysogenic\" bacteria. He said \"the invisible world of d'Herelle does not exist\".Quoted in:  But in the 1930s, the proof that bacteriophages were viruses was provided by Christopher Andrewes (1896\u20131988) and others. They showed that these viruses differed in size and in their chemical and serological properties."]}, {"page": "Richard Shope", "response": ["Shope continued his work at the Department of Animal Pathology at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research in Princeton, New Jersey. In 1933 Wilson Smith, Christopher Andrewes, and Patrick Laidlaw isolated the influenza virus. In 1935 Shope found that humans that had been alive during the 1918-1919 swine flu epidemic still carried antibodies against the swine flu virus. Throughout the 1930s Shope continued to research swine flu. While studying swine flu on farms in Iowa Shope discovered that virus infections caused the mad itch, also known as pseudorabies, in cattle. Scope also discovered that virus infection caused fibroma in the cottontail rabbits he had hunted in New Jersey, and that a virus infection was also responsible for the papillomatosis in the cottontail rabbits he had observed in Iowa. By the last 1930s Shope had established himself as a well-known expert with a reputation as a virus hunter."]}, {"page": "Marjory Stephenson Prize", "response": ["*1965 Sir Christopher Andrewes, The Troubles of a Virus         \t  "]}, {"page": "Andrewes", "response": ["* Sir Christopher Andrewes (1896\u20131988), British virologist"]}, {"page": "Christopher Andrews", "response": ["* Christopher Andrewes (1896\u20131988), British virologist"]}, {"page": "List of people from Hampstead", "response": ["*Christopher Andrewes (British academic and editor)"]}, {"page": "List of alumni of Queen Mary University of London", "response": ["* Sir Christopher Andrewes \u2013 British virologist"]}, {"page": "Medical Research Club", "response": ["On 14 June 1933, the paper \"Propagation in ferrets of a virus obtained from influenza patients\" by  Wilson Smith, Christopher Andrewes, and Patrick Laidlaw provided the first demonstration of the presence of a virus in human influenza."]}, {"page": "Robert R.

Upon an invitation from Sir Harold Himsworth, Secretary of MRC, he moved to the MRC's Common Cold Unit on the outskirts of Salisbury on 1 April 1957, becoming its Head from 1962 succeeding Christopher Andrewes. He was also appointed as Head of the Division of Communicable Diseases in 1967 and then Deputy Director of the MRC's Clinical Research Centre at Northwick Park Hospital, Harrow, Middlesex, in 1970, while still attached to CCU.

Pereira then became interested in laboratory research.", "Political interference at the institute frustrated Pereira, who moved back to Britain in 1951 to work at the Medical Research Council's Common Cold Unit at Harvard Hospital in Salisbury. He worked under Christopher Andrewes, head of bacteriology and virology at the National Institute for Medical Research. The team studied the issue of culturing the common cold virus in the laboratory, and Pereira was successful at the facility. He used equipment from the institute and its library, where he often met with other scientists in his field. During a 1953 study, Pereira propagated a common-cold virus in the laboratory for the first time."]}, {"page": "Wilson Smith", "response": ["When Wilson Smith was ten years old, his father died and his mother took care of the four children alone. During his last year of secondary school at the Accrington Grammar School, he also taught at Great Harwood Elementary School. From 1915 to 1919 he served in France and Belgium as a private in the R.A.M.C.'s 107th Field Ambulance. From 1919 he studied medicine at the University of Manchester with degree qualification as both physician and surgeon (M.B., Ch.B.) in 1923. He was for two years a physician practising clinical medicine in Manchester and worked for one year as a ship's doctor aboard a Blue Funnel Line cargo ship. He then studied bacteriology, graduating with a higher medical degree (M.D.) in 1927. He went into research and led a virus research group at the Medical Research Council in Hampstead in north London. There in 1933  he, in collaboration with Christopher Andrewes and Patrick Laidlaw, succeeded in isolating human influenza A virus and transferring it to ferrets. In 1936 Frank Horsfall, Alice Chenoweth, and colleagues developed, in mouse lung tissue, a live influenza virus vaccine."]}]}}
