When she was fifteen she married the preacher Edward Smyth. She became a Methodist in 1775 and she convinced her husband, who was a curate in Ballyculter, of this approach to Christianity. Agnes was enthusiastic and she abandoned fancy dresses and frivolity and she was determined to preach whenever the opportunity arose. The Methodist leader John Wesley had reassured another Irish preacher, Alice Cambridge, that she should follow her heart if she was inclined to preach, but she should not preach near a male preacher as she may take some of his audience. Her husband's patron Lord Bangor objected to their approach and accused Edward of incorrect teaching. Her husband was found not guilty in court but nevertheless they lost their living in 1776 and the following year Edward's license to preach was taken away."]}, {"page": "Anne Lutton", "response": ["She was a loyal follower of established religion but she was intrigued by Methodism and followed this denomination in addition to her own. She recorded her conversion as 14 April 1815. She became a leader within the Methodists although she was confirmed at a Church of Ireland ceremony. The early Methodists had encouraged women preachers. The Methodist leader John Wesley had reassured another Irish preacher, Alice Cambridge, that she should follow her heart if she was inclined to preach, but she should not preach near a male preacher as she may take some of his audience, but the church changed their policy in 1803. However they did allow women to preach to other women. Before 1831, she preached at 27 northern Irish locations on nearly 160 occasions starting in 1818. In 1829 she published Poems on Moral and Religious Subjects."]}, {"page": "Cambridge, Alice", "response": ["#redirectAlice Cambridge"]}]}}
