Morris biographer Fiona MacCarthy argued that it was likely that Morris had learned of and accepted the existence of their affair by 1870. In this year he developed an affectionate friendship with Aglaia Coronio, the daughter of wealthy Greek refugees, although there is no evidence that they had an affair. Meanwhile, Morris's relationship with his mother had improved, and he would regularly take his wife and children to visit her at her house in Leyton. He also went on various holidays; in the summer of 1866 he, Webb, and Taylor toured the churches of northern France.", "In December 1884, Morris founded the Socialist League (SL) with other SDF defectors. He composed the SL's manifesto with Bax, describing their position as that of \"Revolutionary International Socialism\", advocating proletarian internationalism and world revolution while rejecting the concept of socialism in one country. In this, he committed himself to \"making Socialists\" by educating, organising, and agitating to establish a strong socialist movement; calling on activists to boycott elections, he hoped that socialists would take part in a proletariat revolution and help to establish a socialist society. Bax taught Morris more about Marxism, and introduced him to Marx's collaborator, Friedrich Engels; Engels thought Morris honest but lacking in practical skills to aid the proletariat revolution. Morris remained in contact with other sectors of London's far left community, being a regular at the socialist International Club in Shoreditch, East London, however he avoided the recently created Fabian Society, deeming it too middle-class. Although a Marxist, he befriended prominent anarchist activists Stepniak and Peter Kropotkin, and came to be influenced by their anarchist views, to the extent that biographer Fiona MacCarthy described his approach as being \"Marxism with visionary libertarianism\".", "Morris's behaviour was often erratic. He was of a nervous disposition, and throughout his life relied on networks of male friends to aid him in dealing with this. Morris's friends nicknamed him \"Topsy\" after a character in Uncle Tom's Cabin. He had a wild temper and when sufficiently enraged could suffer seizures and blackouts. Rossetti was known to taunt Morris to enrage him for the amusement of himself and their other friends. Biographer Fiona MacCarthy suggests that Morris might have suffered from a form of Tourette's syndrome as he exhibited some of the symptoms. In later life he suffered from gout, a common complaint among middle-class males in the Victorian period. Morris's ethos was that one should \"have nothing in your houses that you do not know to be useful or believe to be beautiful.\" He also held to the view that \"No work which cannot be done with pleasure in the doing is worth doing\" and adopted as his motto \"As I can\" from the fifteenth-century Flemish painter Jan van Eyck.", "Mackail asserted that Morris became \"a manufacturer not because he wished to make money, but because he wished to make the things he manufactured.\" Morris & Co.'s designs were fashionable among Britain's upper and middle-classes, with biographer Fiona MacCarthy asserting that they had become \"the safe choice of the intellectual classes, an exercise in political correctitude.\" The company's unique selling point was the range of different items that it produced, as well as the ethos of artistic control over production that it emphasised."]}, {"page": "Arts and Crafts movement", "response": ["William Morris shared Ruskin's critique of industrial society and at one time or another attacked the modern factory, the use of machinery, the division of labour, capitalism and the loss of traditional craft methods. But his attitude to machinery was inconsistent. He said at one point that production by machinery was \"altogether an evil\", but at others times, he was willing to commission work from manufacturers who were able to meet his standards with the aid of machines.Graeme Shankland, \"William Morris - Designer\", in Asa Briggs (ed.) William Morris: Selected Writings and Designs, Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1980  Morris said that in a \"true society\", where neither luxuries nor cheap trash were made, machinery could be improved and used to reduce the hours of labour.William Morris, \"Useful Work versus Useless Toil\", in Asa Briggs (ed.) William Morris: Selected Writings and Designs, Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1980  Fiona MacCarthy says that \"unlike later zealots like Gandhi, William Morris had no practical objections to the use of machinery per se so long as the machines produced the quality he needed.\"", "In Britain, the movement was associated with dress reform, ruralism, the garden city movementFiona MacCarthy, Anarchy and Beauty: William Morris and his Legacy 1860-1960, London: National Portrait Gallery, 2014  and the folk-song revival. All were linked, in some degree, by the ideal of \"the Simple Life\".Fiona McCarthy. The Simple Life, Lund Humphries, 1981 In continental Europe the movement was associated with the preservation of national traditions in building, the applied arts, domestic design and costume.", "The British artist potter Bernard Leach brought to England many ideas he had developed in Japan with the social critic Yanagi Soetsu about the moral and social value of simple crafts; both were enthusiastic readers of Ruskin. Leach was an active propagandist for these ideas, which struck a chord with practitioners of the crafts in the inter-war years, and he expounded them in A Potter's Book, published in 1940, which denounced industrial society in terms as vehement as those of Ruskin and Morris. Thus the Arts and Crafts philosophy was perpetuated among British craft workers in the 1950s and 1960s, long after the demise of the Arts and Crafts movement and at the high tide of Modernism. British Utility furniture of the 1940s also derived from Arts and Crafts principles.Designing Britain  One of its main promoters, Gordon Russell, chairman of the Utility Furniture Design Panel, was imbued with Arts and Crafts ideas. He manufactured furniture in the Cotswold Hills, a region of Arts and Crafts furniture-making since Ashbee, and he was a member of the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society. William Morris's biographer, Fiona MacCarthy, detected the Arts and Crafts philosophy even behind the Festival of Britain (1951), the work of the designer Terence Conran (b. 1931) and the founding of the British Crafts Council in the 1970s.", "*Fiona MacCarthy, \"The old romantics\", The Guardian, Saturday 5 March 2005 01.25 GMT"]}, {"page": "Eric Gill", "response": ["Gill's personal diaries reveal incestuous child sex abuse of his two eldest teenage daughters, incestuous relationships with his sisters, and sexual acts on his dog. This aspect of Gill's life was little known beyond his family and friends until the publication of the 1989 biography by Fiona MacCarthy. The 1966 biography by Robert Speaight mentioned none of it. Gill's daughter Petra Tegetmeier, who was alive at the time of the MacCarthy biography, described her father as having \"endless curiosity about sex\" and that \"we just took it for granted\", and told her friend Patrick Nuttgens she was unembarrassed. The children were educated at home and, according to  Tegetmeier, she was then unaware of how her father's behaviour would seem to others. Despite the acclaim the book received, and the widespread revulsion towards aspects of Gill's sexual life that followed publication, MacCarthy received some criticism for revealing Gill's incest in his daughter's lifetime.

However, in his Essay on Typography, he proposed that his version was \"perhaps an improvement\" and more \"fool-proof\" than Johnston's. Johnston and Gill had drifted apart by the beginning of the 1920s, something Gill's groundbreaking biographer Fiona MacCarthy describes as partly due to the anti-Catholicism of Johnston's wife Greta. Frank Pick, the Underground Electric Railways Company managing director who commissioned Johnston's typeface, privately thought Gill Sans \"a rather close copy\" of Johnston's work."]}, {"page": "Hathersage", "response": ["In 1990, the cutler David Mellor opened the Round Building built on the site of a former gasometer as a cutlery factory in the village.

The large hall, dining room, library, morning room, and kitchen were located on the ground floor, while on the first floor were situated the main living rooms, the drawing room, the studio, and the bedrooms. The servants' quarters were larger than in most contemporary buildings, reflecting the embryonic ideas regarding working class conditions which would lead Morris and Webb to become socialists in later life. Windows were positioned to suit the design of the rooms rather than to fit an external symmetry; thus a variety of different window types are present, including tall casements, hipped dormers, round-headed sash-windows, and bull's eye windows. The house lacked any applied ornamentation, with its decorative features instead serving constructional purposes, such as the arches over the windows, and the louvre in the open roof over the staircase. According to Morris' biographer J.W. Mackail, the external design of the house was \"plain almost to severity, and depended for its effect on its solidity and fine proportion.\" This was somewhat radical at the time, as most contemporary buildings were heavily furnished with ornamentation. Rosseti termed it \"a real wonder of the age\u00a0... which baffles all description\", while Morris biographer Fiona MacCarthy described it as \"the ultimate Pre-Raphaelite building\"."]}, {"page": "Philip Mairet", "response": ["Mairet did the drawings for Ashbee's re-design of the Norman Chapel House in Broad Campden, and the 1907 commission for Thomas Shaw-Hellier's Villa San Giorgio in Taormina.University of Bradford Archive Reference: GB 0532 MAI.
