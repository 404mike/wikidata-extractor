Singing appealed to him and he began performing the song in various music halls in London. He based his act on life as a costermonger and became known to his audiences as a \"coster\" singer, similar to that of Gus Elen and Albert Chevalier. Hurley supported many popular acts, including Marie Lloyd, with whom he conducted a tour with in Australia. The two became romantically involved and married upon their return to England in 1906.\nHurley continued to professionally support Lloyd in all of her performances until the marriage broke up a few years later. He had some minor success as a solo performer but work dried up and engagements became scarce. Hurley never recovered from his marital difficulties and stopped performing altogether by 1910.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "March 24", "response": ["*1871 \u2013 Alec Hurley, English music hall singer (d. 1913)"]}, {"page": "Music hall", "response": ["* Edward W.

As a result of the incident, Lloyd was sacked from the Empire for fear of a reprisal.Farson, pp. 42\u201343 Lloyd left the marital home, moving to 73 Carleton Road, Tufnell ParkGillies, p. 85 and successfully applied for a restraining warrant, which prevented Courtenay from contacting her. A few weeks later, Lloyd began an affair with the music hall singer Alec Hurley, which resulted in Courtenay initiating divorce proceedings in 1894 on the grounds of her adultery. That year, together with a short tour of the English provinces, Lloyd travelled to New York with Hurley, where she appeared at the Imperial Theatre, staying for two months. On her return to England, she appeared in the Liverpool Christmas pantomime as the principal boy in Pretty Bo-Peep, Little Boy Blue, and the Merry Old Woman who lived in a Shoe. Her performance was praised by the press, who called her \"delightfully easy, graceful and self-possessed.\"Liverpool Review, 29 December 1894, as quoted in Gillies, p. 95"]}, {"page": "Costermonger", "response": ["From the 18th through to the early 20th-century, music hall entertainers, songwriters and musicians mined the coster culture and language, seeking inspiration for parodies, sketches and songs. Alfred Peck Vance (1838\u20131888), also known as The Vance, was one of the first to exploit the coster image in the music halls.Ian Peddie, \"Playing at Poverty: The Music Hall and the Staging of the Working Class,\" Chapter 12 in Aruna Krishnamurthy (ed), The Working-Class Intellectual in Eighteenth- and Nineteenth-Century Britain, Ashgate Publishing, 2009 Arthur Lloyd was a composer and singer, who achieved great success with his character-songs in the 1870s, many of which were devoted to the lives of costermongers. Lloyd's repertoire, which included songs such as The Costermonger's Song, unlike other music hall compositions, was less dependent on the ability of the performer to mimic Cockney accents and mannerisms, but rather relied on the lyrics to deliver a \"quaintness of fancy\" and humour.Matthews, W., \"Cockney in the Music Halls,\" Chapter 5 in Cockney Past and Present: A Short History of the Dialect of London, Routledge, 2015 Other musicians, such as Robert and Harris Weston, drew inspiration from London's cockney culture when composing their songs, some of which were often sung in a cockney accent. Coster life and culture was also portrayed in Victorian music halls by vocal comedians such as Albert Chevalier, Bessie Bellwood, Charles Seel, Paul Mill and Gus Elen. Elen was a highly popular performer whose tunes included; The Coster's Mansion, The Coster's Muvver and The Coster's Pony. Chevalier, was a popular comedic entertainer, who himself never worked as a coster, but appeared in character as a costermonger, and sang The Coster's Serenade, The Nasty Way 'e Sez It, and Funny Without Being Vulgar. A few costermongers, such as Alec Hurley, made a living composing and performing songs about their own careers as costermongers. The Costermonger's Song (also known as Going to the Derby) was a Lloyd composition. Hurley's wife, Marie Lloyd, had some success with tunes he composed including, The Coster's Christening and the Costermonger's Wedding.Who's Who in the Theatre, Pitman, London, 1912, <Online: https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_qyk_AQAAMAAJ"]}, {"page": "Bernard Dillon", "response": ["Dillon became the third husband of the Music Hall star Marie Lloyd.

Rogers began writing some of Robey's songs, including \"The Simple Pimple\", and monologues.  He also wrote material for Vesta Tilley, including her successful song \"Following in Father's Footsteps\" in 1902.  Tilley commented on Rogers' prodigious output of material: \"It was a rare thing not to see Rogers at my home in London every day with a batch of new numbers. He turned them out so quickly, and they were all more or less successful.\"  He also wrote for other performers including Florrie Forde, Marie Lloyd, Tom Costello, Arthur Lennard, and Alec Hurley, for whom he wrote the original \"Lambeth Walk\" (not the 1937 Noel Gay song of the same name)."]}, {"page": "Marie Lloyd Jr.", "response": ["Her first appearance on a stage was as a child  in 1896 when, billed as Little Maudie Courtenay, she toured South Africa with her mother and Alec Hurley, her mother's lover and later second husband."]}]}}
