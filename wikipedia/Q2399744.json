Reported reception, however, was mixed; Scotland on Sunday literary editor described it as \"convoluted at best, and an absolute parody at worst\", while Ted Brocklebank, culture spokesman for the Scottish Tories, described it as a \"cheap attempt at creating a language\".  However, Chris Robinson, director of the Dictionary of the Scots Language, wrote: \"The fact it is doing well gives a lie to all those people who decry Scots and try to do it down.\" In 2014, Jane C. Hu of Slate described the site as reading \"like a transcription of a person [speaking English] with a Scottish accent\" and said one Wikipedia editor had proposed that the project be closed, in the mistaken belief that it was a practical joke."]}]}}
