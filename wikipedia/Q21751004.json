He also made significant contributions to research strategy at the ESRC.\nHis research into face perception had significant contribution to eyewitness testimony and also the understanding of delusions of misidentification such as Capgras delusion. Ellis is also considered to be the person who coined the term cognitive neuropsychiatry.\nDuring his career he also wrote many books, including Validation in Psychology: Research Perspectives and Perceiving and Remembering Faces.After his death from bowel cancer, Cardiff University recognised his contribution to science and the university by naming a building in his honor. Additionally, the Hadyn Ellis Prize is awarded annually to research students at Cardiff University for the best PhD dissertation, previous winners of which have been Joseph Sweetman and Georgie Powell.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of psychologists", "response": ["* Hadyn Ellis"]}, {"page": "Capgras delusion", "response": ["In a 1990 paper published in the British Journal of Psychiatry, psychologists Hadyn Ellis and Andy Young hypothesized that patients with Capgras delusion may have a \"mirror image\" or double dissociation of prosopagnosia, in that their conscious ability to recognize faces was intact, but they might have damage to the system that produces the automatic emotional arousal to familiar faces. This might lead to the experience of recognizing someone while feeling something was not \"quite right\" about them. In 1997, Ellis and his colleagues published a study of five patients with Capgras delusion (all diagnosed with schizophrenia) and confirmed that although they could consciously recognize the faces, they did not show the normal automatic emotional arousal response. The same low level of autonomic response was shown in the presence of strangers. Young (2008) has theorized that this means that patients with the disease experience a \"loss\" of familiarity, not a \"lack\" of it. Further evidence for this explanation comes from other studies measuring galvanic skin responses (GSR) to faces. A patient with Capgras delusion showed reduced GSRs to faces in spite of normal face recognition. This theory for the causes of Capgras delusion was summarised in Trends in Cognitive Sciences in 2001."]}, {"page": "Cardiff University", "response": ["In June 2010, the University launched three new research institutes, each offering a new approach to a major modern research issue.
