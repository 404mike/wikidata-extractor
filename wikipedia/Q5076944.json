As it was the Duke of Douglas died in 1761, and only around half of the original design was ever completed.  The five storey building had round towers to the front and square towers to the rear facade, and stood in a very extensive park spanning the valley of the Douglas Water.  The Duke's estate became the subject of a famous and bitter legal dispute, known as the \"Douglas Cause\", between his nephew Archibald James Edward Douglas and the Duke of Hamilton. Douglas was eventually victorious and ennobled as Baron Douglas in 1790, and the castle descended through his daughter, and granddaughter, to the Earls of Home.
