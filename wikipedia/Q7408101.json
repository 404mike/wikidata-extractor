He began his career in the Premier League with Middlesbrough although he failed to make a first team appearance but would notably go on to have three spells with Darlington between 2002 and 2012. He also played for Gateshead, Scunthorpe United, Rochdale, Wrexham and Forest Green Rovers before joining Grimsby in 2018 where he combined playing duties as James McKeown's number two with coaching the clubs goalkeepers.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Grimsby Town F.C.", "response": ["|  Goalkeeping Coach ||  Sam Russell"]}, {"page": "Adam Smith (footballer, born February 1985)", "response": ["He was fit for the start of 2005\u201306 and set up two of Chesterfield's goals in the 3\u20131 opening day victory over Blackpool. He went on to score his first goals for Chesterfield with a brace after coming on as a half-time substitute against Yeovil Town; he scored from a pass from Paul Hall after Yeovil goalkeeper Chris Weale was left stranded after being lobbed, and then scored his second after gaining the ball from Mark Allott, which helped his team to a 3\u20131 victory. An 89th-minute goal from Smith against Bradford City on 7 January 2006 saw his team earn a 1\u20130 victory. He agreed to a new two-year contract at Chesterfield in March and finished 2005\u201306 with 29 appearances and scoring three goals. His recurring knee injury was confirmed to be severe patella tendinitis, which resulted in him being unfit for the start of 2006\u201307. He made his return to action in a friendly against Staveley Miners Welfare in August and made his first league appearance of the season in a 4\u20130 defeat to Nottingham Forest on 2 September 2006 after coming on as a 63rd-minute substitute. He scored the winner for Chesterfield in the Football League Trophy against Oldham Athletic with a diagonal shot from distance. Smith suffered from a knee injury in March 2007, which resulted in him undergoing surgery that ruled him out for the remainder of the 2006\u201307 season; in which he made 17 appearances and scored one goal, while Chesterfield were relegated to League Two. His severe tendinitis affected him in September, and eventually made his return in a 2\u20131 defeat to Tranmere Rovers in the FA Cup first round on 10 November. He was sent out on loan at League Two club Lincoln City for a month on 4 January 2008 and made his debut for the team a day later, helping set up the first goal in a 2\u20130 victory over Rochdale, after Jamie Forrester scored from goalkeeper Sam Russell's parry of a Smith effort. He made four appearances during his stay at Lincoln, all as a substitute, which was concluded after Lincoln decided against extending his loan at the club."]}, {"page": "Middlesbrough F.C.

In the 18th minute, a Mansfield corner was met by the head of former Darlington captain Steve Foster, but the ball sailed well over the bar. On 32 minutes, Gary Smith broke into the Mansfield, where he appeared to be brought down by Louis Briscoe. Referee Stuart Attwell, who was well placed, waved away the penalty appeals.

Hughie Dickson scored the second with a penalty kick to make the score 2\u20130, and George Malcolm, the club's first Football League captain, and Tommy Greaves also played in the match.
