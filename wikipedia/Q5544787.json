Hosking, Douglas Kennedy, Philip Mairet, Lord Northbourne, Robert Payne and C. Henry Warren. The group first met in Edmund Blunden's rooms at Merton College, Oxford, in September 1941. They drew ideas from agricultural experts: Albert Howard, Robert McCarrison, George Stapledon and G. T. Wrench. Other members included Laurence Easterbrook and Jorian Jenks. In official eyes, this grouping or think-tank was treated with less suspicion than its correlated far-right political organisations. It had some effect on agricultural policy, particularly in relation to self-sufficiency. It also affected the thinking of the Rural Reconstruction Association founded in 1935 by Montague Fordham, and the Biodynamic Association."]}, {"page": "Rural Reconstruction Association", "response": ["The group enjoyed the support of some leading British figures as Sir George Stapledon and Lord Lymington were amongst the members of its board whilst Lord O'Hagan served as President of the movement for a time.Agricultural Policy debates from Hansard"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society S, T, U, V", "response": ["|Reginald George Stapledon||16/03/1939||22 September 1882 \u2013 6 September 1960"]}, {"page": "Cadwaladr Bryner Jones", "response": ["BrynerJones was engaged in a wide range of agricultural and civil related activities.

Having tired of London, he transferred in 1949 to BBC's Western Region in Bristol; he and his family lived for a time in the house of the novelist L.P. Hartley. For eight years he produced a variety of programmes including poetry, cricket commentary and agriculture. Through this last topic he came to know the agronomist Sir George Stapledon and to develop an ecological outlook. From 1957 to 1962 he worked as a freelance producer and researched his biography of Stapledon, Prophet of the New Age (1962). As a result of his contacts with the environmental movement, he became Editorial Secretary to the Soil Association, where he worked closely with Michael Allaby and persuaded the economist E.F. Schumacher (a Soil Association member since the early 1950s) to play a more prominent role. Waller resigned in 1972 and was for many years an Associate Editor of The Ecologist. During the 1970s he lived in rural Norfolk, moving to Bath in the early 1980s. In his later years he undertook editorial work for the Commonwealth Human Ecology Council (CHEC), and returned to write a column for the Soil Association journal Living Earth.
