He was one of the victims of the Aids epidemic.Vyner's death occasioned a range of musical tributes from some of the major composers of the day, including Hans Werner Henze (Requiem), Luciano Berio (Leaf, for piano), Harrison Birtwistle (Ritual Fragment), Toru Takemitsu (Litany - In Memory of Michael Vyner and My Way of Life - In Memory of Michael Vyner ), Peter Maxwell Davies (Threnody on a Plainsong for Michael Vyner) Henryk G\u00f3recki (Good Night, In Memoriam Michael Vyner) and Oliver Knussen (Secret Psalm).From 1990 to 2004 there was a Michael Vyner Trust, established to assist young composers and commission new works.

In the opening bars of Litany, for Michael Vyner, a reconstruction from memory by Takemitsu of Lento in Due Movimenti (1950; the original score was lost), pentatonicism is clearly visible in the upper voice, which opens the work on an unaccompanied anacrusis.Burt, 31 and 272.

His Requiem (1990\u201393) comprised nine 'sacred concertos' for piano, trumpet and chamber orchestra, and was written in memory of Michael Vyner, the artistic director of the London Sinfonietta. The choral Ninth Symphony (1997), which is dedicated to the \u201cheroes and martyrs of German anti-fascism,\" is set to a libretto by Hans-Ulrich Treichel, based on motifs from the novel The Seventh Cross by Anna Seghers. It is a rejection of Nazism, which Henze himself had experienced in his youth. His last success was the 2003 premiere of the opera L'Upupa und der Triumph der Sohnesliebe (English: The Hoopoe and the Triumph of Filial Love) at the Salzburg Festival, with a text he wrote himself, based on a Syrian fairy tale.

The first movement, Introitus: Requiem Aeternam was commissioned by the London Sinfonietta as part of a memorial concert for Artistic Director Michael Vyner who died on 20 October 1989. In addition to Henze, the London Sinfonietta also commissioned seven other prominent composers (Luciano Berio, Sir Harrison Birtwistle, Sir Peter Maxwell Davies, Toru Takemitsu, Oliver Knussen, and Nigel Osborne) to write works in Vyner's memory to make up the program which was performed on the 6 May 1990.", "The Requiem consists of nine Sacred Concertos that, with one exception, carry the common movement titles of the Requiem Mass, albeit out of order. Henze also chooses to interpolate the Ave verum corpus in with the other movements, though in his autobiography Bohemian Fifths he never expressly states why. Even though the movements carry the traditional titles, there are no singers, and no text within the work. In his autobiography, Henze states that this choice was made to open up the scope of the Requiem and make it a \"...secular, multicultural piece, an act of brotherly love that was written, 'in memoriam Michael Vyner,'whose name does duty for all the many other people in the world who have died before their time and whose sufferings and passing are mourned in my music.\"(471) ", "Dedication: in memoriam Michael Vyner"]}, {"page": "List of compositions by Toru Takemitsu", "response": ["| Keyboard || align=center|1989 || \u30ea\u30bf\u30cb \u2013 \u30de\u30a4\u30b1\u30eb\u30fb\u30f4\u30a1\u30a4\u30ca\u30fc\u306e\u8ffd\u61b6\u306b \u2013 || Litany: In Memory of Michael Vyner  || for piano || composed in memory of Michael Vyner; revision of Lento in due movimenti (1950)", "| Choral || align=center|1990 || \u30de\u30a4\u30fb\u30a6\u30a7\u30a4\u30fb\u30aa\u30d6\u30fb\u30e9\u30a4\u30d5\u3000-\u30de\u30a4\u30b1\u30eb\u30fb\u30f4\u30a1\u30a4\u30ca\u30fc\u306e\u8ffd\u61b6\u306b || My Way of Life: In Memory of Michael Vyner || for baritone, mixed chorus and orchestra || composed in memory of Michael Vyner"]}, {"page": "Michael Vyner Trust", "response": ["#REDIRECT Michael Vyner"]}, {"page": "Vyner", "response": ["* Michael Vyner (1943\u20131989), English arts administrator"]}, {"page": "Eta Cohen", "response": ["As a performing violinist, she was a prominent member of the Leeds musical community.
