As the underdog against Switzerland's Luzia Ebnother, the 2nd seed and a former World and European silver medalist, Britain won the final with Martin's last stone, often described as a difficult draw. The team of Martin, Debbie Knox, Fiona MacDonald and Janice Rankin thus became Great Britain's first gold medallists in any sport at the Winter Olympics since Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean came first in the ice dancing of the 1984 Winter Olympics.
