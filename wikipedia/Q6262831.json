One example was the Woodcock Ironworks, set up by John Wallis Titt in the town in the mid-1870s to make agricultural machines."]}, {"page": "Wold Newton, Lincolnshire", "response": ["A borehole was sunk for general village supply in 1910 and powered by a John Wallis Titt wind pump, which was latterly converted to electricity.
