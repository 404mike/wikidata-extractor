In 2006 it was recognised by Guinness World Records as having the world's oldest branding and packaging.", "In 1883, Charles Eastick, an English chemist at the Abram Lyle & Sons (now part of American Sugar Refining's Tate & Lyle licensed brand) refinery in Plaistow, east London, further formulated how sugar could be refined to make a preserve and sweetener for cooking, bringing it to its current recipe. Charles and his brother John Joseph Eastick experimented with the refining process, of the bitter molasses-brown treacle\u2014hitherto a waste by-product of sugar refining\u2014into an eminently palatable syrup with the viscosity, hue, and sweetness of honey. The resulting product was marketed commercially in 1885 as \"golden syrup\". The name \"golden syrup\" in connection with molasses had occurred, however, as early as 1840 in an Adelaide newspaper, the South Australian."]}]}}
