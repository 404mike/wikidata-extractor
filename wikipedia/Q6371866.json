Keith Hopwood (rhythm guitar, backing vocals), Karl Green (lead guitar, backing vocals), Alan Wrigley (bass), Steve Titterington (drums) and Peter Noone (lead vocals) came from the Heartbeats where Hopwood had replaced rhythm guitarist Alan Chadwick. The second-youngest member of a young group (four months older than Karl Green who was originally in the Balmains), 15-year-old Noone was already an experienced actor on the popular British TV soap opera Coronation Street. Derek \"Lek\" Leckenby (lead guitar) and Barry Whitwam (drums) (born Jan Barry Whitwam) joined later from another local group, the Wailers. Whitwam replaced Titterington on drums, Green switched to bass guitar (replacing Wrigley) and Leckenby took over for Green as lead guitarist. After Leckenby joined the band, the group made a deal with producer Mickie Most and signed with EMI's Columbia label in Europe and MGM Records in the United States.Allmusic.com biography. Retrieved 7 March 2011.", "Continuing acrimony among former members of Herman's Hermits has increased the amount of disinformation about the group's role on their records; the late Derek Leckenby, in particular, was a skilled guitarist. Mickie Most commented on the VH1 My Generation: Herman's Hermits episode that the Hermits \"played on a lot of their records, and some they didn't.\" The group played on all their UK and US no. 1 hits (\"I'm into Something Good\", \"Mrs. Brown You've Got a Lovely Daughter\" and \"I'm Henry VIII, I Am\"), on most of their US Top Ten singles, on a number of other singles and on most album cuts. According to Peter Noone, Leckenby played the muted lead on \"This Door Swings Both Ways\".Noone interview: Herman's Hermits Listen People DVD Reeling in the Years (2009) The riff in \"Silhouettes\" variously has been credited to Jimmy Page, Big Jim Sullivan and Vic Flick; however, according to Keith Hopwood and Karl Green, Leckenby replaced Flick in the studio and played the signature riff under Most's direction. According to Hopwood, Green and Noone, Jimmy Page played on the single \"Wonderful World\" (although Big Jim Sullivan lists the song as part of a session he played); both may have added to the backing track. Several writers have claimed that session players played on \"I'm into Something Good\"; according to the surviving band members, the song was recorded on a two-track recorder, with only a piano player in addition to the Hermits.", "Karl Green has noted that he preferred harder rock, but was grateful for the hand he was dealt.VH1 My Generation: Herman's Hermits Many of the band's singles and album tracks were written by some of the top songwriters of the day, but Noone, Leckenby, Hopwood and Green contributed lesser-known songs such as \"My Reservation's Been Confirmed\", \"Take Love, Give Love\", \"Marcel's\", \"For Love\", \"Tell Me Baby\", \"Busy Line\", Moon Shine Man\", \"I Know Why\" and \"Gaslight Street\". \"I Know Why\" enjoyed a limited A-side release.EMI and MGM catalogs", "* Karl Green \u2013 bass, backing vocals (1964\u20131980); lead vocals (1972\u20131980)", "  bar:Karl    text:Karl Green", "* Karl Green's official website"]}, {"page": "Sunbury-on-Thames", "response": ["|Karl Green \u2013 bassist of Herman's Hermits||The Avenue||2010s"]}, {"page": "List of bass guitarists", "response": ["* Karl Green (Herman's Hermits)"]}, {"page": "Davyhulme", "response": ["*Karl Green, bassist, vocalist with 60s pop group Herman's Hermits, musician, songwriter"]}, {"page": "Derek Leckenby", "response": ["An accomplished lead guitarist and musician, he played on many of the band's early hits and composed songs with bandmates Keith Hopwood, Peter Noone and Karl Green. He admired their record producer Mickie Most, but was bothered at times by Most's use of session musicians on the band's mid-career hits, despite the Hermits' more-than-acceptable skills as players. Leckenby played on all the band's US and UK Number One hits and provided the solo on \"I'm Henry VIII, I Am\". Karl Green commented on VH1's My Generation-Herman's Hermits that Most's use of session musicians on some of the band's records was unfair to Leckenby in particular. During the 1970s and 1980s, Leckenby tried to set the record straight with the rock media, explaining the large body of guitar playing he contributed to the band's records. Even the band's US label ABKCO failed to credit the Hermits' playing in the liner notes to its retrospective on the band. Leckenby's skills are apparent not only on Herman's Hermits records, but also on videos of the band's live appearances including the 1965 NME music awards and the Herman's Hermits Hilton Show.

The band never dreamed it would be a single let alone hit number one in the US.
