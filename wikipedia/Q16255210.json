His filmmaking journey began as a teenager, making visuals for raves and nightclubs in a creative collective, which he co founded, called Vegetable Vision.\nSmith started his television directing career in 2007, with four episodes of the television series Skins. He then went on to directing episodes of the BBC One drama Little Dorrit, based on Charles Dickens' novel.[1] In 2010, he directed the first episode of the revival fifth series of Doctor Who, 'The Eleventh Hour' and episodes four and five titled 'The Time of Angels' and 'Flesh and Stone'. For his work directing Doctor Who, he was voted best director by readers of Doctor Who Magazine.\nSmith has worked closely with The Chemical Brothers since their first gig in 1994, designing the surreal and visionary video elements of their live shows. His music video for their song \u2018Galvanise\u2019 won the Grand Jury Prize Award for Best Music Video at Resfest 2005. In 2012 Smith directed the Chemical Brothers concert film \u2018Don\u2019t Think\u2019, for which he was interviewed by Rolling Stone. The film won Best Live Film at the Music Video Awards 2012. Empire Magazine gave the film 5 stars saying, \"This visceral ride captures the hands-aloft essence of live dance\".In 2015, Adam and creative partner Marcus Lyall creatively directed The Chemical Brothers\u2019 \u2018Born In The Echoes\u2019 world tour, which included headline sets at Glastonbury, Primavera, and Sonar Festivals. Adam and Marcus created visuals combining props, films, animation and lighting. The tour was described by The Guardian as \"an all-round aesthetic explosion and gargantuan visual show\". Adam also filled in for Ed Simons on the tour operating music; lights and visuals live from the stage. The show was described by The Telegraph as \"simply mesmerising\". FACT Magazine praised their Glastonbury Festival headline set \"the most impressive of the weekend\", with Mixmag referring to it as a \"must see\". Digital Spy stated that \"The duo's live offering has been refreshed by Smith's immersive visuals. The final result was a thrilling, powerful and enraptured stage show that breathed even more life into The Chemical Brothers' biggest bangers.\" In July 2015, Nowness featured a selection of the tour visuals alongside an interview with Smith.\nSmith has also collaborated extensively with Mike Skinner of The Streets. His banned from TV, video for \u2018Blinded by the Light\u2019 won the DMA Best Video in 2004 and was nominated for the D&AD Silver Pencil in 2005. Smith\u2019s comedy musical/extended music video \u2018What Goes Up Must Come Down\u2019 starring Charlie Creed Miles (and featuring a cameo from Kathy Burke) won the Golden Falcon Award at Ibiza Film Festival 2007.\nHe has made commercials for Nike (starring Wayne Rooney), The National Lottery, and The Children\u2019s Society. His short film 'Desire' for the Jaguar F type launch starred Damian Lewis and Shannyn Sossamon, and premiered at Sundance London 2013. Documentaries for Channel 4 include an early portrait of the Grime music scene \u2018Wot Do U Call It?\u2019 and \u2018A.I.P.S\u2019 which looked at a group of Englishmen who reenact the Vietnam war in Kent. \u2019Ghetto on Sea\u2019 for BBC THREE charted the trials and tribulations of running a pirate radio station.\nIn 2016 Adam completed his first feature, Trespass Against Us, starring Michael Fassbender, Sean Harris and Brendan Gleeson.\nHe lives with the artist Martha Freud.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Chemical Brothers", "response": ["On 30 March 2010, the band announced on their website that their seventh studio album, titled Further, would be released on 22 June and would be \"the band's first to be released with corresponding films made specifically to match each of the 8 audio tracks.\" The films were made with long-time visuals collaborators Adam Smith and Marcus Lyall.

Adam Smith filled in for him on stage during the 2015 tour. During the tour, Simons attended a few shows as an audience member, and both he and Rowlands expressed concern in interviews that this could mark a permanent retirement.

It had initially a debut at the 2013 Sundance London Film and Music Festival and was then posted on YouTube. On June 30, 2013, she debuted as Alex in the ABC drama Mistresses. Her character had a \"multi-episode arc\" during the first season of the series, with her last airdate being September 2 (episode \"When One Door Closes...\"). Sossamon accepted the role as it was a \"softer character\" for her to play, given she had been in a career hiatus due to her second pregnancy. At the time, it was announced that Sossamon was cast to play one of the main parts in M. Night Shyamalan's limited series for FOX, Wayward Pines. Her role was Theresa Burke, the wife of Matt Dillon's character, and the show premiered on May 14, 2015.

Throughout her youth, she starred in various plays with both her drama group and whilst at school. At the age of 9, Pearson made her television debut with a minor role in the British medical drama series Casualty in 1998. Pearson was a student at Colston's Girls' School in 2006 when she was cast as the female lead of the television teenage-drama Skins. Casting director Jane Ripley and Adam Smith travelled to Colston's Girls' School to hold auditions, wherein Ripley asked Pearson whether she wished to audition after watching her drama class. The programme was a success and ran for seven series, only two of which Pearson appeared in. Her performance was well received; the character was popular, and Pearson garnered widespread attention. She stated that the amusing nature of simply playing someone who's very different from her in person was what drew her to playing Richardson in Skins. After the release of the first season, Pearson stated that being recognised was rather strange, though remarked that, \"I try to be nice to everyone and hope they keep watching the show.\" Skins won the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) Philip Audience Award, and Pearson was nominated for the Golden Nymph Award for Best Actress in a Drama Series. Of her time on Skins, Pearson spoke of how she learnt to cope on a set and how to act in the working world, to which she added: \"I owe the position I am in now to Skins and I'm so happy and proud that it has done so well.\""]}, {"page": "The Chemical Brothers discography", "response": ["| Adam Smith", "| rowspan=\"8\"| Adam Smith, Marcus Lyall"]}, {"page": "Satellite Award for Best Miniseries", "response": ["| rowspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2009 || style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\"| Little Dorrit || style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\"| Diarmuid Lawrence, Adam Smith, and Dearbhla Walsh || style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\"| BBC One / PBS"]}, {"page": "Freud family", "response": ["####Martha Freud (born 1983), partner of Adam Smith"]}, {"page": "Doctor Who (series 5)", "response": ["All the series' directors were new to Doctor Who; Moffat said that he wanted to \"shake things up\", and it was \"never too early to get rid of the safety net.\" Adam Smith directed the first, fourth and fifth episodes, and Andrew Gunn, Ashley Way, Jonny Campbell, Toby Haynes and Catherine Morshead directed two episodes apiece.", "Rehearsing episodes four and five (the first episodes produced), director Adam Smith suggested that Smith and Gillan \"have an adventure\" in which they could experience something exciting, laugh and scream; he took them on a \"real white knuckle ride\" on a boat in Cardiff Bay. Filming began on 20 July 2009 on the Southerndown beach in the Vale of Glamorgan for \"The Time of Angels\" and \"Flesh and Stone\". Moffat wrote that in a typical television production the first day of filming \"will probably be something fairly inconsequential and involve a minor character getting shot, or a close up of a hand or something\", rather than the \"iconic\" scene with the Doctor, Amy, River Song and the TARDIS.

Though Gillan recommended Blackwood, the young actor first had to undergo rigorous auditions, lacking any formal acting experience. \"The Eleventh Hour\" was also the debut of Arthur Darvill as Rory Williams, who became a regular in the sixth series. Moffat stated that what stood out about Darvill's audition was \"just how funny\" he was. EastEnders star Nina Wadia was chosen for the part of the doctor at the Leadworth Hospital. Wadia speculated that she was cast because she had worked with Adam Smith before. Patrick Moore appears as himself in the video conference with a brief speaking part, though not all his lines survived the final cut. The man above Moore is the brother of Adam Smith. Marcello Magni, who played a man Prisoner Zero impersonates that barks like his dog, had already worked as a canine impersonator. Academy Award-winning actor Olivia Colman and The Umbrella Academy star Tom Hopper make pre-stardom appearances in small roles (as one of Prisoner Zero's forms, and Jeff, respectively).

Though it is the first episode of the series, \"The Eleventh Hour\" was not the first to be shot. It was filmed in the third production block, after the completion of episodes 2\u20135. As Smith was aware of how his Doctor would act in the following episodes, he used this one to establish the character. The plan was to retain traces of Smith's predecessor, but the executive producers wanted Smith to be \"stranger\". The episode was directed by Adam Smith, who was attracted to the \"brilliant script\" and working with Matt Smith after seeing him on stage. Smith was asked to direct \"the same but make it a bit different\u00a0\u2013 the producers didn't want it to be radically different, but they did want it to be different\". The goal was to make it more \"cinematic\" and magical, and Smith took inspiration from E.T. and Tim Burton's work.", "Amelia's house was designed to appear \"spooky but ordinary\" and reminiscent of a castle. Most scenes based in Leadworth were filmed in Llandaff village in Cardiff on 29 September, 5\u20137 October, and 20 November 2009. Photographs were taken on 5 October for the stop-frame animation sequence representing the Doctor's thought process. As the stills were taken by members of the crew and not computers the result was not perfect, which Adam Smith thought provided an \"organic\" feel. Plagued by torrential rain, the crew returned on 20 November to shoot the final Leadworth scenes. The production crew heavily dressed the area, adding flowers, street signs and souvenirs specific to Leadworth.", "While Amelia waits for the Doctor in the garden, the camera returns to her house where something, presumably Prisoner Zero, darts past the camera. It is actually Smith in footage intended for the finale, \"The Big Bang\", but when it did not fit into that episode it was recycled here. Originally the scene where the Doctor confirms that he is the man she remembers by showing her the apple she gave him that day was cut due to pacing issues and that the fact had been established in a previous scene. The previous scene was then cut and the apple scene returned. Due to the rain, the scene where the Doctor tries to gain the Atraxi's attention with his sonic screwdriver had to be simplified. Adam Smith based the style of the confrontation on a Western film. The destruction of the sonic screwdriver shortly after was achieved with a spark effect concealed inside the screwdriver, activated by an electrical charge that reached the screwdriver by an electrical wire that ran up Smith's sleeve and connected to a receiver. Special effects head Danny Hargreaves then used a remote control to activate the device. Contrary to reports, the effect did not injure Smith. The \"fish fingers and custard\" scene was shot in 12 takes. The fish fingers were actually a breaded coconut-flavoured food item; Smith estimated that he had eaten some 14 of them.", "Daniel Martin of The Guardian called \"The Eleventh Hour\" \"an absolute triumph\" and the fact that \"the story wisely doesn't waste too much time with an unstable regeneration\". Though he praised Smith, he commented he was \"still not feeling\" the \"Geronimo!\" catchphrase. Radio Times reviewer Patrick Mulkern believed it was \"obvious\" that Smith's Doctor would be \"up there with the greatest\" and also praised Gillan, though he was unsure of the rescored theme tune. He also praised Moffat's script for \"[offering] funny lines...directorial flourishes and a host of blink-and-miss star turns\". Zap2it's Sam McPherson gave the episode an A+, saying that it was \"definitely\" his favourite and praised the debut of Smith, Gillan and the redesigned TARDIS. Paul Kerton, also of the site, praised Adam Smith for \"[handling] the episode beautifully\", the depth in Amy's character, and Matt Smith's take on the role. However, he thought the downside to the episode were the \"slightly poor effects\" and \"somewhat lightweight story\", and while he called the new title sequence \"absolutely beautiful\", he was unsure of the new variation of the theme tune."]}, {"page": "The Time of Angels", "response": ["\"The Time of Angels\" is the fourth episode of the fifth series of the British science fiction television series Doctor Who, which was first broadcast on 24 April 2010 on BBC One. It is the first episode of a two-part story written by showrunner Steven Moffat and directed by Adam Smith; the second episode, \"Flesh and Stone\", aired on 1 May. Moffat utilised the two-part episode to bring back a couple of his previous creations: the Weeping Angels from his series three episode \"Blink\", and River Song (Alex Kingston) from the series four episodes \"Silence in the Library\" and \"Forest of the Dead\".", "Director Adam Smith, new to Doctor Who, felt pressure in making the episode be a worthy sequel to \"Blink\", which he called a \"brilliant, brilliant, brilliant episode\", but also said that it was great to work with the Weeping Angels. He decided to have the interaction between the Doctor and River Song resemble that of an old married couple, bickering like \"mum and dad arguing over directions in the car\". Actress Alex Kingston stated that it was \"great fun\" on set and she enjoyed working with Matt Smith, although her relationship with Smith was different from his predecessor and her former co-star, David Tennant. In the script it was not written in that River would land on the Doctor when she flew into the TARDIS; it was an idea that Matt Smith came up with in rehearsal that proved difficult to film. In the episode, there is a moment in the viewing room where the Doctor hangs on a strap attached to the ceiling and it breaks. This was originally an accident during one of the takes, but director Adam Smith liked it and filmed it again, with Matt Smith doing it on purpose.", "Most of the Weeping Angels are not statue props but young women wearing masks, costumes, and paint that took two to three hours to apply. Adam Smith called them \"an absolute nightmare to film with\" because it took a long time for them to get ready and they had to stand still for long periods of time. Smith wished River Song's entrance to be a shocking surprise to the audience. A stunt double was used for some shots of the scene where River flies out of the Byzantium airlock, but Kingston wished to do some of it herself. The scene was filmed on a greenscreen with Kingston hooked up on wires that pulled her up and backwards as a wind machine was blown to create the effect of the airlock. Kingston said she \"absolutely loved\" filming the scene.

In the climactic scene Gillan had to walk with her eyes closed, which she said was difficult and challenging as the ground was uneven and muddy. She stated that \"it was the most scary thing\" when she had to trip over a step and fall, even though she was aware of the crash mat. As she was not able to express herself through her eyes, Gillan had to make herself more animated to convey emotion. The scene in which the Doctor, Amy and River are horizontal in mid-air when the gravity field fails on the Byzantium was achieved by using wires and powerful wind machines. The blue in Amy's bedroom was an idea of Adam Smith to show that it was inspired by the TARDIS from Amy's encounter with the Doctor when she was young.", "Steven Cooper of Slant Magazine called it \"an exciting, action-packed roller coaster\" and praised director Adam Smith's \"top-notch visuals\" as well of the performances of Smith, Gillan, and Kingston. He noted the difference between Moffat's more obvious story arc as opposed to others in the revived series, believing it to be possibly a \"long-overdue innovation\" for the show. Though he praised the final defeat of the Angels for making use of what the viewer had forgotten, he thought that being able to see the Angels moving was \"creepy and well-done\", but made them \"much less original and interesting\" and the reason behind it weak, considering that the scene had \"no significance at all\" and was just to fill up time. SFX Magazine Dave Golder agreed, calling the scene \"very creepy\" and the Angels moving \"effective\", but feeling that \"these once great monsters come across a bit wussy and stupid\". He also thought that it did not live up the \"brilliant first part\", feeling \"a bit one-note\" and lacking \"a really good jawdropping revelation\". However, he thought it was \"a solid, exciting, pulse-pounding 45 minutes\" that was \"tense, action-packed, and stuffed with memorable one-liners and touching character moments\", particularly praising Amy's countdown and Octavian's death, and gave the episode four out of five stars."]}, {"page": "Further (The Chemical Brothers album)", "response": ["Further is the seventh studio album by The Chemical Brothers, released on 14 June 2010.
