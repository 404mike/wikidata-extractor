In 1996, the band returned to Earache and created their fourth studio album, Songs of Love and Hate, which was Godflesh's first music made with a human drummer since the early Fall of Because days; Bryan Mantia of Praxis provided the aggressive, non-mechanical drumming. In retrospect, Broadrick believed Songs of Love and Hate marked the point where Godflesh lost sight of their original goal and started making \"self-conscious\" music. When it came time for the album's 1996 tour, Mantia made the move to join Primus, and Godflesh recruited Ted Parsons of Prong and Swans to perform on the tour in his place. Along with the album's follow-up remix release, Love and Hate in Dub (1997), Songs of Love and Hate moved away from Godflesh's industrial roots into experimentation with conventional verse-chorus format, hip hop, dub and drum and bass. The remix album was supported by a one-off concert on 4 October 1997 at The Garage, London where Broadrick operated a mixing desk, Steve Hough played guitar, Green played bass and Diarmuid Dalton provided support on a Moog synthesiser.", "Godflesh typically perform as a duo, with Green playing bass and Broadrick providing both guitar and vocals while the percussion is relayed over the speakers, often at a notably high volume. This lineup, however, has not been constant over the band's career. In concerts supporting Streetcleaner, Neville occasionally came onstage and played second guitar, and Hampson did the same for Pure. For the tours in support of Selfless, Songs of Love and Hate and Hymns, the band played with a live drummer, though Broadrick believed this incorporation to be a misstep. In a 2014 interview, he clarified that the percussive additions of Mantia and Parsons brought \"something amazing\" to Godflesh, but that the band's name should have changed so as to not dilute the original focus on machine drums. A handful of other musicians (namely, Mick Harris in 1991; Diarmuid Dalton in 1997, 1999 and 2001; Steve Hough in 1997 and 1999 and both Paul Raven and Jaz Coleman of Killing Joke in 2002) have briefly performed with Godflesh.", "* Diarmuid Dalton \u2013 keyboards (1997, 1999, 2001)"]}, {"page": "Final (band)", "response": ["Final was then put on hiatus while Broadrick played in Napalm Death and Head of David and later co-founded Godflesh. Final was revived in 1993 as an experimental ambient solo project meant to \"explore beat-less spaces\" and focus on textures, now expanding its influences to the likes of Brian Eno and Maurizio Bianchi. This new incarnation started utilizing electric guitar, tape decks, synthesizers and samplers. One was released on Sentrax and Subharmonic and was Final's first ever CD release. 2 (1996) and 3 (2006), which both compiled pieces recorded over several years, were collaborations with Broadrick's bass players: Godflesh's G. C. Green and Jesu's Diarmuid Dalton respectively. Two series of live improvised music were self released under the Final name on Avalanche Recordings, Infinite Guitar (2007-2009) and Guitar & Bass Improvisations (2007-2013).

The first name they went under was Atrocity Exhibition, named after a Joy Division track (which, itself, takes its name from a book by J. G. Ballard). Their first recording was titled Live in the Studio and was the first catalogued release on their cassette label Post Mortem Rekordings. Shortly after, the project was named Smear Campaign, after a Nocturnal Emissions track. This was the name they went under at their first live performance on 7 July 1984 in The Mermaid in Birmingham. Promptly after the show they settled on the name Final. Final was then inspired lyrically and musically by acts such as Throbbing Gristle and Maurizio Bianchi. \"We were pretty heavily into the whole industrial tape culture and fanzines of the very early '80s\", Broadrick says. The project developed to embrace the power electronics subgenre of industrial music in 1983, releasing material by them and other industrial projects on Post Mortem Rekordings (which was renamed Uprising Productions in 1985) such as Family Patrol Group, Mental Health Act, Ashenden, The Grey Wolves, Con-Dom, Death Magazine 52, Fern and Un-Kommuniti.

In December, the self-titled debut LP was released. This release featured Ted Parsons on drums, Diarmuid Dalton on bass and a guest appearance from Paul Neville. The album was more melodic than his previous work. \"I was still making low-tuned, heavy, guttural music, at the heart of this there was something quite pretty and beautiful, just being construed in an almost ugly fashion\", said Broadrick. In November 2005 Broadrick played live as Final for the first time in 20 years and supported Jarboe. Final's two-disc release 3 had been in making for nearly five years and was put out in 2006. Broadrick toured Europe as Final in March 2006. In April 2006 the Silver EP was released through Hydra Head Records. The second full-length album, Conqueror, was released in February 2007. Jesu toured with Sunn O))) and Isis and Broadrick played as a guest with both bands. On 30 April 2007 Jesu released a 12\" called Sun Down/Sun Rise.
