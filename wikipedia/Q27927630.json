Quinault, writing in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, theorises that Randolph was probably passing through the stages of secondary syphilis and then tertiary syphilis, but mentions a brain tumour and multiple sclerosis as other possible causes. Whatever the true source of this illness was, Randolph was certainly treated for syphilis, and it has been suggested that he may have been suffering from symptoms related to the mercury-based medication which was used in such cases at the time. Clayton was a society doctor and specialist in the treatment of syphilis who worked from his practice at 5 Harley Street. Robson Roose, who was the Churchills' family doctor in the 1880s, had written on syphilis as a root cause of debilitating disease, and subsequently diagnosed Randolph as suffering from it. He referred Randolph to the specialist Thomas Buzzard, but continued to prescribe potassium iodide and mercury."]}, {"page": "Farquhar Buzzard", "response": ["Farquhar Buzzard was born on 20 December 1871, one of six children of the neurologist Thomas Buzzard."]}, {"page": "The Doctor (painting)", "response": ["The painting was commissioned by Henry Tate in 1890 as a work of \"social realism\" on a topic of Fildes' choosing to be displayed in the National Gallery of British Art, now known as the Tate Gallery London.
