He lost to two lightweight ex-champions, Len Beynon in 1939 and Cuthbert Taylor in 1940, but he also took wins over George Pook, a future South-West featherweight champion and Warren Kendall who would become Welsh lightweight champion in 1948. Worgan made headlines in 1941 when he faced the World number two Ritchie \"Kid\" Tanner of British Guyana, beating him on points. In 1942 Worgan, now under the management of ex-fighter Billy \"Kid\" Hughes, faced his most notable adversary Nel Tarleton. Tarleton was the Commonwealth champion who in 1934 lost on points to Freddie Miller for the NBA title in 1934. The match was held at the Royal Albert Hall on 30 March and was scheduled for eight rounds. The match went the distance with Worgan losing on a points decision. Despite being beaten Worgan later commented that 'Nel was one of the greatest in the game.' Worgan faced Tarleton on another two occasions, losing both on points decisions, in Liverpool in 1942 and Nottingham in 1943."]}, {"page": "List of Welsh boxing champions", "response": ["|align=left | Len Beynon", "|align=left | Len Beynon", "|align=left | Len Beynon", "|align=left | Len Beynon"]}, {"page": "Eug\u00e8ne Huat", "response": ["Back in France, Huon put together six straight wins, including victories over Francois Biron, Lucian Popescu, and Len Beynon, before losses to Kid Francis and Panama Al Brown.
