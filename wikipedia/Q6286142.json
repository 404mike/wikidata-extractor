Two years later, she returned to England. Bishop's expertise was recognised when she was contacted and asked to return in 1883 to be the director of the Pestalozzi-Froebel House. The appointment was temporary, as Bishop was just providing holiday cover. Bishop moved to Edgbaston where she established a Froebel College and kindergarten.
