He wrote from a liberal perspective, dissenting from many points of view taken as orthodox in the field. He was employed at the London School of Economics (LSE) from 1953 to 1990, becoming Professor of Politics. Kedourie was famous for his rejection of what he called the \"Chatham House version\" of history, which viewed the story of the modern Middle East as one of continuous victimisation at the hands of the West, and instead castigated left-wing Western intellectuals for what he regarded as a naively romantic view of Islam.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Algerian War", "response": ["In a 1977 column published in The Times Literacy Supplement reviewing the book A Savage War of Peace, the Iraqi-born British historian Elie Kedourie vigorously attacked Horne as an apologist for terrorism and accused him of engaging the \"cosy pieties\" of bien-pensants as Kedorie condemned the Western intellectuals who excused terrorism when it was committed by Third World revolutionaries. Kedourie claimed that far from a mass movement, the FLN were a small gang of murderous intellectuals that used brutally-terroristic tactics against the French and any Muslim who was loyal to the French and that the French had beaten it back by 1959. Kedourie charged that de Gaulle had cynically sacrificed the colons and the harkis as Kedourie charged that de Gaulle had chosen to disregard his constitutional oath as president to protect all Frenchmen to ensure that \"the French withdrew and handed over power to the only organized body of armed men who were on the scene-a civilized government thus acting for all the world like the votary of some Mao or Ho, in the barbarous belief that legitimacy comes from the power of the gun\"."]}, {"page": "List of historians", "response": ["*Elie Kedourie (1926\u20131992), Middle East"]}, {"page": "McMahon\u2013Hussein Correspondence", "response": ["Elie Kedourie said the October letter was not a treaty and that even if it was considered to be a treaty, Hussein failed to fulfil his promises from his 18 February 1916 letter.

History, in fact, was an integral part of Catalonia's \"rebirth.\" Texts on Catalonia's history \u2014 inspired by the Romantic philosophy of history \u2014 laid the foundations of a Catalanist movement. Works like Valent\u00ed Almirall i Llozer's Lo Catalanisme, Victor Balaguer's Historia de Catalu\u00f1a y de la Corona de Arag\u00f3n and Prat de la Riba's La nacionalitat catalana used history as evidence for Catalonia's nationhood. According to Elie Kedourie, such claims were common in 19th century nationalist discourse because \"the 'past' is used to explain the 'present,' to give it meaning and legitimacy. The 'past' reveals one's identity, and history determines one's role in the drama of human development and progress\" (36). Publications of histories thus \"explained\" why the Catalans constituted a nation instead of a Spanish region or coastal province."]}, {"page": "Benedict Anderson", "response": ["Therefore, in contrast to other thinkers such as Ernest Gellner, who considered the spread of nationalism in connection with industrialism in Western Europe, and Elie Kedourie, who construed nationalism as a European phenomenon carried around the world by colonization, Anderson sees the European nation state as a response to the rise of nationalism in the European diaspora beyond the oceans, especially in the Western Hemisphere, which was then retransmitted to Africa and Asia through colonization. Anderson considers nation state building as an imitative and transportable action, in which new political entities were copying the model of the nation state. As Anderson sees it, the large cluster of political entities that sprang up in North America and South America between 1778 and 1838, almost all of which self-consciously defined themselves as nations, were historically the first such states to emerge and therefore inevitably provided the first real model of what such states should look like. According to Anderson, this phenomenon led to the rise of nations: communities that were limited by their borders and were sovereign. Anderson conceived nationalism as having come about in different \"waves.\""]}, {"page": "List of Jews from the Arab world", "response": ["* Elie Kedourie, historian"]}, {"page": "List of British Jews", "response": ["* Elie Kedourie,Jewish Year Book 1990 p202 historian and political scientist"]}, {"page": "Mandatory Iraq", "response": ["On 1 October 1922, the Royal Air Force (RAF) elements stationed in Iraq was reorganized into the RAF Iraq Command, which came about partially as a result of the 1920 revolt.

Air control was considered by the British government as a more cost-effective method of controlling large areas of territory than land forces, an idea that was heavily promoted by RAF officer Hugh Trenchard.

Resistance to  this mass  Jewish immigration , who to that date had been  numerically unimportant compared to the overwhelmingly Muslim population, arose out of feelings of shock at the proposal by the new British authorities to bestow privileges on an exiguous minority of foreigners. The tensions between an emergent Palestinian nationalism and Zionist ambitions for a Jewish state led on several occasions to riots and violence against Jewish immigrants.Elie Kedourie,Arabic Political Memoirs and Other Studies, Routledge 2012  p.218-219 Gudrun Kramer argues that Arab positions and actions were \"political in character, aiming to defend Arab social, economic, and cultural, and political interests. It was not racial in character, and neither did it reflect racial concepts rooted in Islam.\", and that the idea that one can equate anti-Zionism with anti-Judaism and therefore anti-Semitism \"is itself politically motivated, and must be understood as such.\" The antisemitic forgery The Protocols of the Elders of Zion was at times cited in Palestinian sources after an Arabic translation was issued in Cairo in 1925.Norman A.

Scholars also disagree on the broader impact of the elements of antisemitism, with Jeffrey Herf arguing that it was influential enough to provide seeds for later Islamist movements, and Kr\u00e4mer and Ren\u00e9 Wildangel arguing that most Palestinians and Arab nationalists distanced themselves from Nazi ideology. Richard Levy notes that, \"Original works of Arabic antisemitic literature did not appear until the second half of the twentieth century, after the establishment of the state of Israel and the defeat of  Arab armies in 1948, 1956, and 1967.\""]}, {"page": "Farhan al-Sa'di", "response": ["Sa'adi was at one point imprisoned by the British authorities.
