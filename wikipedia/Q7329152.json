After his death, these were updated by H. M. Edelsten. Michael Salmon has described these as \"innovative\" and \"a new kind of [field] guide for the [twentieth] century\", noting their early use of colour photographs and eschewing of \"Victorian polixity and classical preciousness\". The moth volumes were reprinted as late as 1980.South was editor of The Entomologist. He also published many papers on the Lepidoptera of the Far East, including China and Korea, and an account of the butterflies collected by Captain F.M. Bailey in western China, Tibet and South-Eastern and the Mishmi Hills.Major parts of his collections of specimens survive, in the Natural History Museum and in the collection of Birmingham Museums Trust.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Apatura iris", "response": ["Richard South noted that collectors once used animal carcasses \"in a somewhat advanced state of decay\" to lure the males down to the ground, adding that this practice was \"unsportsmanlike\"; otherwise one needed a \"high net\" mounted on a pole about 14 or 15 feet (about 4.5 metres) in length to capture them.The accepted method was to mount an ordinary butterfly net onto a 13-foot squirrelling pole. Heslop et al. noted that the males' penchant for roadkill can often cause them to be killed by cars."]}, {"page": "Elliot Pinhey", "response": ["His numerous collecting trips led him to associate with such authorities as Dr Henry Bernard Davis Kettlewell (lepidopterist and geneticist known for his research on industrial melanism), Capt.

Hale Carpenter (Hope Professor of Entomology) and Poulton's successor, Sir Guy Anstruther Knox Marshall  FRS (1872\u20131959) specialist in Curculionidae of the British Museum (Natural History), Baron Charles de Worms and Frederick William Frohawk."]}, {"page": "Norman Denbigh Riley", "response": ["His first schooling took place at Dulwich College where his interest in natural history and Lepidoptera became evident. Richard South, the prominent entomologist was the Riley family's neighbour in Balham and encouraged Norman Riley in his hobby. After he finishing school Riley enrolled at the Imperial College in order to take a course in entomology, and managed to find work there as a demonstrator under Ray Lankester, who was then director of the British Museum. At age 21 he was appointed as an assistant in the Entomology Department.", "Because of his easy and affable manner, Riley became popular as a committee-man and competently steered projects through financial and political pitfalls, becoming involved in national and international entomological matters. He served as both secretary and treasurer to the Entomological Society of London between 1926 and 1951, and was elected president in 1952. He was also a charter member of the Lepidopterists' Society and served on their council, being elected vice-president in 1954 and president in 1958. He also found time to be active in the Zoological Society of London. In 1923, on the retirement of Richard South, his boyhood mentor, Riley took over the running of a small, but popular periodical called the Entomologist's Monthly Magazine.Obituary by Lionel Higgins"]}, {"page": "Leechia", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Richard South"]}, {"page": "Entomological Magazine", "response": ["This in turn was succeeded by Newman's Entomologist published  by Simpkin, Marshall & Co. at London [1869-1876] and from that date until ? as, once more, The Entomologist.
