In 1974 he was appointed as a researcher in the Chalcidoidea at the British Museum (Natural History). He was seconded to the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research in New Zealand where he conducted a survey of the Chalcidoidea of New Zealand in 1980 and 1981. He travelled widely in the course of his research into the Chalcidoidea and has published over 80 papers, with some major monographs, and described one new family, 88 new genera and 644 new species of Chalcidoidea.
