He was a right-handed batsman who rarely bowled and played from 1922 to 1939 for Sussex, captaining the county from 1936 till his retirement. He represented the Royal Air Force cricket team between 1930 and 1932; he was a flight lieutenant in the RAF.Nicknamed \"Sherlock\", Holmes also represented Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) several times in the late 1930s and would have captained the England national cricket team in 1939\u201340 if MCC's scheduled tour of India had gone ahead. The team had been selected but the outbreak of the Second World War on 1 September 1939 caused the tour's immediate cancellation.Holmes' final first-class appearance was in the last match to be completed following the outbreak of war, playing for Sussex against Yorkshire at the County Cricket Ground, Hove, from Wednesday 30 August to Friday 1 September. From an overnight position of 330/3 in the first innings, chasing a Sussex score of 387, Yorkshire continued on the Friday morning and totalled 392 all out. Sussex collapsed in their second innings and were all out for only 33, whereupon Yorkshire made 30\u20131 to win by nine wickets. Holmes scored 11 and 4 in the match, being bowled by Hedley Verity in both innings.Holmes was born at Thornton Heath, Surrey and died at Hollington, Hastings, Sussex.  He made 208 first-class appearances, scoring 6,282 runs @ 21.22 with a highest innings of 133 not out, one of six centuries. He also scored 24 half-centuries, held 122 catches and took 8 wickets. His son Rodney played a handful of games for Sussex in the early 1950s.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hugh Bartlett", "response": ["Bartlett's finest year was 1938. While travelling by train to Leeds to play Yorkshire in May, his captain Jack Holmes told him : \"If you score 50 I will give you your cap ... a 50 against Yorkshire is worth 150 against any other county.\" Sussex lost their first five wickets for 106 when Bartlett joined Harry Parks. They added 126 in 75 minutes of which Bartlett scored 94. The bowlers were Bill Bowes, Hedley Verity, Frank Smailes, Emmott Robinson and Cyril Turner. He hit seven sixes (all off Verity) and nine fours. In two overs by Verity, Bartlett scored 062660 and 006606. The last six was his final scoring shot as he tried to hit Smailes over long off and was caught by Maurice Leyland \"with his heels on the boundary and left hand outstretched\". Bartlett was duly awarded his county cap.Gerald Brodribb, Some Great Six-hitting Feats, The Cricketer, 20 July 1957, p.\u00a0346", "With 1548 runs at 57.33, Bartlett finished fifth in the averages (behind Wally Hammond, Joe Hardstaff, Jr., Len Hutton and Eddie Paynter). Wisden elected him as a Cricketer of the Year in the 1939 edition. He hit 40 sixes in 1938, second only to Arthur Wellard. Immediately after his innings against Australia, when Arthur Fagg dropped out, Bartlett was added to the English team to tour South Africa that winter. He toured and scored 358 runs at an average of 51.14 in the first-class matches but did not play in any of the Tests. A year later, he was selected for the planned Indian tour under the captaincy of Jack Holmes, but the Second World War led to its cancellation."]}, {"page": "Cricket in World War II", "response": ["Although German intentions were clear throughout the summer of 1939, the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) selectors went ahead with choosing a team of available players for the scheduled tour of India in the autumn and winter of 1939\u201340. The tour was cancelled as soon as war broke out and many of the chosen players lost their only chance of representing England in Test cricket.
