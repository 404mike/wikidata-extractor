Oxford soon sold the rights (worth nearly \u00a3300 per annum) to Clifford. Within a short time, though, Elizabeth was taken from Clifford's custody (\"without leave asking, and not without peril to his person\") by Thomas, Lord Dacre. By 1491, relations between the two men had deteriorated to the extent that the King personally prosecuted them both in the Star Chamber for rioting; they were each fined \u00a320. King Henry was more likely to have been concerned, in cases such as these, with bending his tenants-in-chief to his political will than the revenue these forfeits added to his Exchequer. Hicks has suggested that this behaviour made Clifford less trustworthy in Henry's eyes as a crown agent. In 1496 the Captain of Carlisle, Henry Wyatt, wrote to the King expressing, as Agnes Conway calls it, his \"poor opinion\" of Clifford. Wyatt considered Clifford's wife, Lady Anne St John, to be a more able administrator than her husband, whom he considered inefficient, and told the King so plainly."]}, {"page": "George Horsfield", "response": ["George Horsfield (1882-1956) was a British architect and archaeologist.
