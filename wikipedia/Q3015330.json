He represented England under-20s in 2002.\nBorn in Manchester, Webber began his career as a trainee with Manchester United, but failed to cement a first team place and spent loan spells with Port Vale and Watford before joining Watford on a permanent basis. After two years with Watford, Webber joined Sheffield United for the second half of the 2004\u201305 season. That loan also became a permanent transfer at the end of the season, and during the 2005\u201306 season, Webber's goals helped Sheffield United to promotion to the Premier League for 2006\u201307. Three years later, after scoring 20 goals in 107 league appearances for the Blades, Webber's contract was allowed to expire and he was released from the club. He then joined Portsmouth for an injury-plagued two-year spell. He signed a short-term deal with Leeds United in February 2012 and, after being released at the end of the season, was left with no club until he joined Doncaster Rovers in March 2013 on non-contract terms. He signed with Accrington Stanley in July 2013, where he remained for one season before joining non-league side Salford City in August 2014, helping the side to win the Northern Premier League Division One North title in 2014\u201315, and then promotion out of the Premier Division play-offs in 2015\u201316, before he announced his retirement in July 2016.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Neil Warnock", "response": ["On 18 February 2012, Warnock joined Leeds as manager on a one-and-a-half-year deal taking him up to the end of the 2012\u201313 season.

The 2004\u201305 season saw a continuation of the good form of the end of the previous season, with the club well in the upper half of the Championship at the end of September. However, a long run of poor form subsequently saw the club drop steadily towards the relegation zone. Another good cup run further eased the club's financial position, with the team reaching the semi-final of the League Cup, soundly beating Premiership sides Portsmouth and Southampton on the way, before losing narrowly to Liverpool. The club's poor league form, however, came to a head in March, with a run of terrible performances and Lewington was sacked on the 22nd. His sacking was controversial, and many fans were unhappy at the loss of a man who had led the club to two cup semi finals in three seasons, enduring considerable financial hardships."]}]}}
