He also has an MA in development economics from the University of East Anglia and a PhD in economics from the University of Lancaster. In 2010 he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Faculty of Economics at Uppsala University, Sweden.Buckley's interest lies in the theory of multi-national enterprise and international business.

He also developed the modern economic theory of entrepreneurship through a synthesis of the ideas of Joseph Schumpeter, Friedrich Hayek and Frank Knight. According to this theory, successful entrepreneurs demonstrate good judgement in making risky innovations, and are rewarded through either profits or salaries depending on whether they act as owners or managers of their firms."]}, {"page": "Peter Buckley", "response": ["Peter Buckley may refer to:", "* Peter Buckley (boxer) (born 1969), English journeyman welterweight boxer", "* Peter Buckley (cyclist) (1944\u20131969), British professional racing cyclist", "* Peter Buckley (academic) (born 1949), British professor of multinational enterprise and international business"]}, {"page": "John Harry Dunning", "response": ["There are two institutions greatly influenced by John Dunning, one of which he created and one which he presided over and took to new heights. The first of these is the University of Reading, where he created a rich intellectual environment, starting in the 1970s, in which deep theoretical analysis and rich empirical work was fostered to explain the activities of multinational enterprise. He recruited scholars to the University who included Mark Casson, Peter Buckley, John Cantwell, Bob Pierce, Rajneesh Narula, Klaus Meyer, Sarianna Lundan, and many others who have made significant scholarly contributions. Dunning supervised several dozen doctoral students at Reading including Professor James H Landi, prominent among them being Jeremy Clegg.

(1976) \u201cThe Future of the Multinational Enterprise\u201d, New York, Holmes and Meier This was complemented by simultaneous work by John Dunning as he developed the eclectic paradigm of international business as an envelope explanation containing three principal drivers of foreign direct investment, comprising ownership (O); location (L); and internalization (I).Dunning, J.H.

Henley Business School", "Internalization theory and the eclectic paradigm have been refined over the last 40 years to become the bedrock explanations of multinational enterprise activity. The founder members of the Reading School were John Harry Dunning (1926\u20132009), Peter Buckley, Mark Casson, Robert Pearce  University of Reading and John Cantwell. Rutgers University Dunning was Head of the Department of Economics at the University of Reading, 1964-87 (later Professor at Rutgers University, New Jersey), Buckley was Research Fellow at University of Reading in 1973-4 (later Professor at University of Bradford and University of Leeds), Casson was lecturer in Economics (later Professor and Head of Department) at University of Reading, Pearce was Research Fellow (later Professor) at University of Reading and Cantwell was Research Fellow (later Professor) at University of Reading and then Rutgers University. Buckley and Casson promoted internalization theory, whilst the others promoted Dunning's eclectic paradigm. Cantwell later espoused an evolutionary resource-based view of multinationals, while simultaneously also contributing to the eclectic paradigm.Cantwell, J., Dunning, J.H. and Lundan, S.M. (2010) \u201cAn Evolutionary Approach to Understanding International Business Activity: The Co-evolution of MNEs and the Institutional Environment\u201d, Journal of International Business Studies, Vol. 41, pp. 567-86Cantwell, J. and Narula, R. (2001), \u201cThe Eclectic Paradigm in the Global Economy\u201d, International Journal of the Economics of Business, Vol. 8 No. 2, pp. 155-72", "A third area of focus for the Reading School is how multinational enterprises affect economic development. Originally developed by Peter Buckley and John Dunning, this takes a macro-view of the interaction of multinational enterprise on structural change in countries. The first published paper by John Dunning Dunning, J.H. (1981) \u201cExplaining the International Direct Investment Position of Countries: Towards a Dynamic or Developmental Approach\u201d,  Weltwirtschaftliches Archives proposed a framework that has become known as the investment development path. This proposed that there was a systematic relationship between development and the inward and outward activities of multinational enterprises.  This was later extended by a number of collaborative contributions by Rajneesh Narula and John Dunning on FDI and government,Dunning, J.H. and Narula, R. (1996) \u201cForeign Direct Investment and Governments: Catalysts for Economic Restructuring, Routledge, London, 455 pp. and more recently on development and the multinational enterprise.Narula, R. and Dunning, J.H.

One of the core insights has been to better understand how learning by firms is motivated by the way in which foreign investors and domestic actors interact, and builds upon internalization theory and the eclectic paradigm. This theme is especially relevant to developing and transition economies, and has inspired a number of important policy studies."]}, {"page": "Fellow of the Academy of Social Sciences", "response": ["* Peter Buckley"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the British Academy elected in the 2010s", "response": ["* Peter Buckley, OBE.
