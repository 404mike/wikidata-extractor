Garnett was of English descent, but he was born in Bridgetown, Barbados and died in Scarborough, Tobago.\nGarnett played in two matches in the space of eight days, batting in the Cambridge University middle order in both of them; he failed to score in either innings in his first match, but scored 20 and 21 in his second game. His batting style is not known and there is no record whether he bowled or not; there are no extant records of appearances in other major or minor cricket matches.\nAlumni Cantabrigienses, the directory of Cambridge University students, identifies Garnett as the son of William Garnett, rector of St Michael's Church, Barbados (now the Cathedral Church of Saint Michael and All Angels). He was educated privately in Winchmore Hill, Middlesex and at Trinity College, Cambridge.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "James Garnett", "response": ["James Garnett may refer to:", "* James Garnett (cricketer) (1809\u20131842), Barbados-born English cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of English cricketers (1826\u20131840)", "response": ["|James Garnett"]}]}}
