He was born at Hexham in Northumberland.\nGraham was a very tall medium-fast right-arm seam bowler. He made his first-class cricket debut for Kent in 1964. Having played a few matches for Kent in each season from 1964, he took 104 first-class wickets in the 1967 season at an average of 13.90, including dismissing England opening batsman Geoffrey Boycott for the only pair of his career. Kent finished as runners-up in the County Championship and won the 1967 Gillette Cup. Although technically a medium pace bowler, Graham was able to use his height \u2013 6 feet 8 inches (2.03 m) \u2013 to produce bounce and lateral movement normally associated with faster bowlers.\nIn 1968, he was picked for Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) match against Surrey at Lord's. Graham was never again to reproduce the kind of form he displayed in 1967, but he remained a useful county performer for Kent for a further nine seasons, taking more than 70 wickets in 1968, 1969 and 1971 and played a part in Kent's 1970 County Championship winning side and in the sides which won six one-day cup competitions between 1970 and 1976. In 1969, he took eight Essex wickets for 20 runs in the match at Brentwood as the home side was dismissed for just 34 runs in their second innings. He also became a highly effective bowler in one-day cricket in the early 1970s. He won his county cap in 1967 and remained with Kent until the end of the 1977 season, his benefit season, during which the team shared the 1977 County Championship title with Middlesex.Graham was a number 11 batsman throughout his career. His highest score in first-class cricket was 23 and his total of first-class wickets comfortably exceeded his total of first-class runs. He was also generally considered a poor fielder, his ground fielding being described as \"often entertainingly poor\".After retiring from first-class cricket he played Minor Counties cricket for his native Northumberland, retiring to Hexham where he worked in the financial services industry. Graham's father Jack played for Northumberland either side of the Second World War and his cousin, Peter Graham, also played for Northumberland and for Yorkshire Cricket Board.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Northumberland County Cricket Club", "response": ["* Norman Graham"]}, {"page": "Cyril Aldred", "response": ["Aldred retired in 1974, but his writing continued.

Kent batted first and posted a total of 239 for eight, aided by scores of 66 from both Colin Cowdrey and Brian Luckhurst. During Essex's reply, Norman Graham bowled well to take four wickets and restrict the opposing batsmen to 19 runs from his 12 overs, helping Kent to a 42-run victory. In their quarter-final match against Surrey, Alan Dixon took seven wickets for 15 runs, while Graham and John Shepherd also bowled economically to bowl Surrey out for 74 runs. Writing for The Times, A. A. Thomson opined that although Dixon's bowling was \"magnificent\", the opposition batting was equally poor. In a facile chase, Kent lost four wickets, but reached their winning total in less than half the available overs to win by six wickets. In their semi final against Sussex, good batting performances from Luckhurst, Shepherd and Cowdrey helped Kent to a total of 293 for five. In response, Sussex were bowled out for 175. The wickets were shared amongst the Kent bowlers, but Alan Brown and Derek Underwood were particularly miserly.", "! scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight: normal; text-align: left;\" | Norman Graham", "| style=\" text-align: left;\" | c Norman Graham b Alan Dixon || 17", "| style=\" text-align: left;\" | c Stuart Leary b Norman Graham || 2", "! scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight: normal; text-align: left;\" | Norman Graham "]}]}}
