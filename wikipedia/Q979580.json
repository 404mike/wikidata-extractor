The Gaelic Songs of Duncan MacIntyre. Edinburgh: John Grant, 1912. is one of the most renowned of Scottish Gaelic poets and formed an integral part of one of the golden ages of Gaelic poetry in Scotland during the 18th century. He is best known for his poem about Beinn Dorain; \"Moladh Beinn D\u00f2bhrain\" (English: \"Praise of Ben Doran\"). Most of his poetry is descriptive and the influence of Alasdair MacMhaighstir Alasdair is notable in much of it. Despite the Jacobite upheavals during his lifetime, it was his experience as a gamekeeper in Argyll and Perthshire in the employ of the Duke of Argyll which had greatest impact upon his poetry. Moladh Beinn D\u00f2bhrain, stems from this period. The significance of Duncan B\u00e0n's nature themed poetry is such that it has, along with that of MacMhaighstir Alasdair, been described as \"the zenith of Gaelic nature poetry\".", "The poet Duncan Livingstone (1877-1964) was born in his grandfather's Croft at Reudle, near Torloisk on the Isle of Mull.
