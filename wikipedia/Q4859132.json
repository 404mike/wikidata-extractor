Their daughter Claire (Amy Lynch) was born on 8 January 1985 - the very first baby to be born in the series, more than two years after its inception. However, the downside to this was that parenthood so late in life put pressure of the Grant's marriage. The Grant family started to break-up from 1986, first with Karen leaving to go to university in London.  In 1987, Damon was stabbed and died on Lendal Bridge in York. Bobby and Sheila persuaded Barry not to go after revenge (something he didn't do until Damon's murderers were released in 2003), but the strain this put on her caused a rift in her marriage.  To try and recuperate, Sheila and Bobby leave for a stay with Sheila's sister Margaret Jefferson (Barbara Marten) and her husband Tony (Richard Walker), but to no avail, and the marriage continues to collapse.  After months of tension between him and Sheila, Bobby left her and the soap in 1988. Despite Barry and Sheila's best efforts, without Bobby's wage they fall behind with the mortgage repayments and their home is repossessed, later being bought by Frank Rogers (Peter Christian).  Sheila is devastated by this, as the home represents everything she and Bobby had worked for, and later confided to a priest \"I know we are not supposed to value material things, but it's different \u2013 it's a home\".
