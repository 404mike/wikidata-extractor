Jon Beresford of TV Scoop felt the episode to be one of the strongest of the second series.

He felt that Myles and Owen \"stole the show\" as Gwen and Rhys believing that \"there's a definite spark between these two that sets their moments apart.\"", "Joan O'Connell Hedman of Slant Magazine felt the episode to be the strongest of the second series.

She singled out writer Phil Ford for considerable praise feeling that he wrote the episode true to the characters \"while filling in backstory we had no way of imagining\" and delivered \"drama, action, and laughs\". Brad Trechak of AOL TV felt the more comic episode was a welcome respite from darker episodes. He praised the episode for being \"light and fluffy yet it furthered things along with regard to the Torchwood universe and its characters\". Reviewing the episode Brigid Cherry of Total Sci-Fi felt that \"contrary to expectation\u00a0\u2013 it\u2019s hilarious\". She praised the comedy provided from Eve Myles, Gareth David-Lloyd and Nerys Hughes in particular as well as the \"terrifying moments that threaten to tip over into gross-out horror-comedy.\" She felt overall the \"offbeat self-parody\" made a welcome change from the show's more serious episodes and rated it eight out of ten.
