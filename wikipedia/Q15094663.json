W. Nevinson", "response": ["Richard Nevinson was born in Hampstead, one of the two children, and the only son, of the war correspondent and journalist Henry Nevinson and the suffrage campaigner and writer Margaret Nevinson. Educated at Shrewsbury and Uppingham, which he hated, Nevinson went on to study at the St John's Wood School of Art. Inspired by seeing the work of Augustus John, he decided to attend the Slade School of Art, part of University College, London. There his contemporaries included Mark Gertler, Stanley Spencer, Paul Nash, Maxwell Gordon Lightfoot, Adrian Allinson and Dora Carrington. Gertler was, for a time, his closest friend and influence, and they formed for a short while a group known as the Neo-Primitives, being deeply influenced by the art of the early Renaissance. Gertler and Nevinson subsequently fell out when they both fell in love with Carrington. Whilst at the Slade, Nevinson was advised by the Professor of Drawing, Henry Tonks, to abandon thoughts of an artistic career. This led to a lifelong bitterness between the two, and frequent accusations by Nevinson, who had something of a persecution complex, that Tonks was behind several imagined conspiracies against him."]}, {"page": "Michael Allinson", "response": ["John Michael Allinson was born on 30 December 1920 in London, the son of British painter and sculptor Adrian Allinson, founding member of the avant garde London Group of painters.

He married in 1907. In the summer of 1910 he briefly attended the Slade School of Art, where he joined the 'Neo-Primitive' group that included fellow Slade students Mark Gertler, C.R.W. Nevinson, Edward Wadsworth, Stanley Spencer and Adrian Allinson.

In September 1911, shortly before Lightfoot was due to visit Liverpool to introduce his new fiancee to his relatives he took his own life at his home in Primrose Hill. According to Adrian Allinson, Lightfoot's fiancee, an artists model, was 'notoriously promiscuous' but his love for her had blinded him to what was 'common knowledge to us all' and the discovery of this 'drove him to the extreme of suicide'. An inquest returned a verdict of 'suicide whilst of unsound mind'. Although an exhibition of his work had been planned for the Carfax Gallery, no paintings were found in his studio and it is thought Lightfoot must have destroyed them."]}, {"page": "Allinson (surname)", "response": ["*Adrian Allinson, British painter"]}, {"page": "Francesca Allinson", "response": ["(born Enid Ellen Pulvermacher Allinson; 20 August 1902 \u2013 7 April 1945) was an English author and musician.
