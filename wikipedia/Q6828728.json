Before moving, he had perceived Scandinavians to be a \"bearded, woolly jumper-wearing, recycling bunch of people\", but afterwards was surprised by how different each of the Nordic countries seemed to be. He wanted to write a book to explore these differences and to explain what he saw as a \"fascinating dysfunctional family dynamic\" between the five Nordic neighbors. He was further inspired by the \"Nordic wave\" phenomenon that gained popularity in the 2000s and 2010s when the western world became fascinated with the Nordic countries and their ways of life. In particular, he wanted to investigate Denmark's consistently high scores on various happiness indexes, since these figures conflicted with his own observations that \"they didn't seem that happy\", and also challenge the perception that the Nordic nations as a group are \"little jolly green countries in the north\"."]}, {"page": "Kate Whiteman", "response": ["The Guild of Food Writers created the Kate Whiteman Award for Work on Food and Travel in her honour.
