The show featured Bitsy Bob (Michele Durler), who played music and made things, and initially Bella and Baxter the Numbears followed by puppets Morris Cog and Milly Sprocket (Nick Mercer and Michele Durler), who presented a segment called \"Morris and Milly's Numerical Melodies\", where they sang a song glorifying a particular number. The Roundabout Stop also played host to an array of extra visitors to help with Rosie's puzzles, including but not limited to, Rhythm Man (David Rubin), Dilys Litefoot (Teresa Gallagher), Paul Morocco, Allesandro Bernardi, Morton McKewan (Iain Lauchlan) and Leaping Lindy (Caroline Hinds). Also joining Mr. Jolly occasionally were Professor Mopp and Morgan from the Dot Stop. During the time Clive Duncan played Mr. Jolly, the team was later joined by the musician, Charlie Grindle (Nick Mercer), who also appeared as one of the bus drivers from The Why Bird Stop. Charlie often sang songs for them as well. The main body of the episode featured the characters finding different shaped pictures, which came together to form the title of a nursery rhyme or song, which was performed by the entire cast at the end of the episode. In later episodes (1995 to 1997) Mr Jolly was played by Andy Hockley. These episodes featured Peggy, Poppy and Why Bird, who rode on the roundabout and went off on adventures (but on some episodes only Peggy and Why went on adventures so on the 3rd shape they would both go together).

The special saw Mr Jolly, again played by Andy Hockley with Poppy, Why Bird and Peggy visiting a cottage for the weekend."]}, {"page": "Wicked (musical)", "response": ["* The Wonderful Wizard of Oz: Desmond Barrit, Clive Carter, Mark Curry, Andy Hockley, Sam Kelly, Tom McGowan"]}, {"page": "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (musical)", "response": ["| Andy Hockley"]}, {"page": "Wyrd Sisters (TV series)", "response": ["*Andy Hockley "]}, {"page": "Soul Music (TV series)", "response": ["*Andy Hockley - Imp y Celyn"]}]}}
