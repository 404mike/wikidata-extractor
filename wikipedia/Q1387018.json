He made significant, innovative discoveries in immunology, about life under aseptic conditions, in blood chemistry, and about diseases transmitted by arthropods, especially ticks. He carried out investigations into the distribution of Anopheline mosquitoes in England in relation to the previous prevalence of malaria there. With William Welch he identified Clostridium perfringens, the organism responsible for causing gangrene. He also demonstrated the importance of intestinal bacteria in digestion and investigated the bactericidal properties of blood.\nHe was born in San Francisco to Robert Kennedy Nuttall, a British father, who was a doctor, and Magdalena Parrott, an American mother from California, and was the brother of Zelia Nuttall. He acquired British citizenship in 1900. He gained an M.D. from the University of California in 1884 and a Ph.D. from the University of G\u00f6ttingen in 1890. In 1899 he moved to England, where he stayed for the rest of his life, and became associated with Cambridge University. In 1906 he was elected the first Quick Professor of Biology at Cambridge (emeritus 1931). \nHe founded the Molteno Institute for Research in Parasitology in 1921 at the University of Cambridge and was its first Director. Nuttall established and edited the Journal of Hygiene in 1901 and also founded and edited Parasitology in 1908. \nHe died in 1937 and his ashes were buried in Tunbridge Wells, Kent.His writings include some 150 articles in professional journals.He published:\n\nHygienic Measures in Relation to Infectious Diseases (1903)\nBlood Immunity and Blood Relationship (1904), establishing the identification of different kinds of blood\nThe Bacteriology of Diphtheria (1908), with Graham Smith and others\nTicks (1908 et. seq.), with C.

Early methods for maintaining sterile environments involved sterile glass jars and gloveboxes, which developed into a conversation surrounding uniformity of the methods in the field at the 1939 symposium on Micrurgical and Germ-free Methods at the University of Notre Dame. Many early (1930-1950s) accomplishments in gnotobiology came from Notre Dame University, The University of Lund, and Nagoya University. The Laboratories of Bacteriology at the University of Notre Dame (known as LOBUND) was founded by John J. Cavanaugh and is cited for making some of the most notable achievements in the field of gnotobiotic research. Under the direction of James A. Reyniers, early work at LOBUND focused on obtaining gnotobiotes by sterilizing animals and maintaining the animals using high-pressure steam sterilized steel isolators; however, later work at the institute shifted the focus of the field towards establishing colonies of animals born germ-free. The first germ-free rat colony was generated and maintained using a steam sterilized isolator in 1946 by Swedish scientist Bengt Gustafsson. Flexible film isolators using peracetic acid vapor for sterilization began being developed in the 1950s. Refined sterilization techniques and manufacturing changes from LOBUND significantly reduced the size and cost of isolators, making gnotobiotic research more universally accessible.  After numerous advances in gnotobiotic research and technologies, the main challenges facing gnotobiotic research today are cost, space, efficiency, and operational procedure requirements. In 2015, the costs of maintaining gnotobiotic mice cages was greater than 4 times the cost of maintaining those of non-gnotobiotic mice, creating a challenge for establishing and maintaining facilities using typical funding sources, such as federal grants from institutions like the NIH."]}, {"page": "List of Old Harrovians", "response": ["*Frederick James Quick (1836\u20131902), coffee merchantGeorge Nuttall, \"Frederick James QUICK (1836\u20131902), a Biographical Note, with portrait\" in Parasitology (1922), p. 100"]}, {"page": "David Keilin", "response": ["Keilin became research assistant to George Nuttall, first Quick Professor of Biology at the University of Cambridge, in 1915, and spent the rest of his career there, succeeding Nuttall as Quick Professor and director of the Molteno Institute in 1931.

It has been found that blood can be transmitted only between animals that are closely related. The degree of relationship between these animals is determined by what is known as the serological evidence. There are various methods of doing so; the method employed by George Nuttall is called the precipitation method. In this method, anti-serum of the involved animals has to be prepared. For human study, human blood is collected and allowed to clot. Then, the serum is separated from the erythrocytes. A rabbit is then injected with a small amount of serum at regular intervals, which is allowed to incubate for a few days. This forms antibodies in the rabbit's body. The rabbit's blood is then drawn and clotted. The serum separated from the red blood cells is called the anti-human serum."]}, {"page": "Timeline of immunology", "response": ["* 1888 \u2013 Bactericidal action of blood (George Nuttall)"]}, {"page": "H.
