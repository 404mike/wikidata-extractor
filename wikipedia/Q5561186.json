Sir Ralph Freeman had produced the first ideas in 1927 and in the early 1930s the cost of the project was estimated at \u00a31.725\u00a0million and that the bridge would be unlikely to recoup the construction or maintenance costs. In 1935 he had an idea for a  suspension bridge for the Humber Tunnel Executive Committee. Sir Gilbert Roberts produced more ideas in 1955 for a bridge with a  central span, costing \u00a315\u00a0million, to be paid for by East Riding County Council and Lindsey County Council. Once it was likely that a bridge would be constructed, Imperial College-educated Bernard Wex OBE (24 April 1922 \u2013 31 July 1990) produced the design in 1964 that was actually built. The bridge was built to last 120 years. In 1985 Wex was awarded the Telford Medal by the Institution of Civil Engineers. In the 1950s he had helped to design High Marnham Power Station. He was a former UK chairman of the International Association of Bridge and Structural Engineers and helped to found the Steel Construction Institute in 1976."]}, {"page": "William Brown (bridge designer)", "response": ["* 1959-1971.
