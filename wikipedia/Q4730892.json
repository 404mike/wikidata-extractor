This culminates in Annie nearly dying in a fire one night when she is left alone. Luckily for Mary, she is rescued by Arthur Fowler (Bill Treacher)  before she is harmed. Dot can no longer stand the maltreatment of Annie so she contacts Mary's parents, Chris Smith (Allan O'Keefe) and Edie Smith (Eileen O'Brien), who arrive in Walford and demand to take Annie back with them to Stockport.

He moves in with her, gets her a job as a cleaner at The Dagmar, weans her off drugs and prostitution, and is instrumental in helping her work towards getting her baby back, who is now in the care of Mary's parents in Stockport.
