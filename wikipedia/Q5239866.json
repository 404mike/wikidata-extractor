There are close links between critical psychologists and critical psychiatrists in Britain through the Asylum Collective. David Smail was one of the founders of The Midlands Psychology Group, a critical psychology collective who produced a manifesto for a social materialist psychology of distress. Critical psychology courses and research concentrations are available at Manchester Metropolitan University, York St John University, the University of East London, the University of Edinburgh, the University of KwaZulu Natal, the City University of New York Graduate Center, the University of West Georgia, Point Park University, University of Guelph and Prescott College.

Levine, considered part of the anti-psychiatry movement, have written widely on how society, culture, politics and psychology intersect. They have written extensively of the \"embodied nature\" of the individual in society, and the unwillingness of even therapists to acknowledge the obvious part played by power and financial interest in modern Western society. They argue that feelings and emotions are not, as is commonly supposed, features of the individual, but rather responses of the individual to their situation in society. Even psychotherapy, they suggest, can only change feelings in as much as it helps a person to change the \"proximal\" and \"distal\" influences on their life, which range from family and friends, to the workplace, socio-economics, politics and culture. at AlterNet"]}, {"page": "David Smail", "response": ["David Smail is the name of:", "* David Smail (golfer) (born 1970), New Zealand golfer", "* David Smail (psychologist) (1938\u20132014), author and former head of clinical psychology services in Nottingham, UK"]}, {"page": "Illusion and Reality: the Meaning of Anxiety", "response": ["#redirect David Smail (psychologist)"]}, {"page": "Poisonous pedagogy", "response": ["Social psychologist David Smail contends that society bears a large part of the responsibility for individuals' dysfunctional behavior, but as yet has not addressed this in any meaningful way."]}, {"page": "Joseph Berke", "response": ["* David Smail (psychologist)"]}]}}
