However, Bassong missed the start of the 2013\u201314 Premier League season after suffering an injury just before the start of pre-season. He played in developmental games and a League Cup fixture against Bury to get back to match fitness. On 31 August 2013, he returned against Southampton and helped the team keep a clean sheet as they beat the Saints 1\u20130. Since returning to the first team from injury, Bassong regained his first team place, establishing himself in the centre\u2013back position. However, against Manchester City on 2 November 2013, he was the captain in the match that saw Norwich City lost 7\u20130, leading him to be dropped to the bench for the next match. Bassong then returned to the starting lineup for Norwich City, without the captaincy, where he helped the side beat Crystal Palace 1\u20130 on 30 November 2013. On 12 December 2013, he signed a new contract with the club, keeping him until 2016. Three days after that, Bassong returned as the club's captain against Swansea City, where he made a mistake that led to Nathan Dyer, as the game finished 1\u20131. Later in the 2013\u201314 season, his performance in number of matches was soon a subject of criticism from the club's supporters and pundits. As a result, he was dropped from the first team for the rest of the season. However, Norwich were relegated that season along with Cardiff City and Fulham. This was his third relegation from the Premier League with a third different club.
