The LANS concentrations for each essential element and sodium in a full solution of the nitrate-type are shown below. In particular, the composition and concentration of the micronutrients (B, Mn, Zn, Cu, and Mo) is still commonly used in plant science today (cf. Table (1)). The LANS micronutrients can be combined with the macronutrients of the Hoagland solution. According to Hewitt iron is available as ferric citrate or it may be prepared as ferric EDTA complex.Hewitt E. J. (1966). Sand and Water Culture Methods Used in the Study of Plant Nutrition.
