Among other discoveries, he formulated the Dirac equation which describes the behaviour of fermions and predicted the existence of antimatter. Dirac shared the 1933 Nobel Prize in Physics with Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger \"for the discovery of new productive forms of atomic theory\". He also made significant contributions to the reconciliation of general relativity with quantum mechanics.\nDirac was regarded by his friends and colleagues as unusual in character. In a 1926 letter to Paul Ehrenfest, Albert Einstein wrote of Dirac, \"I have trouble with Dirac. This balancing on the dizzying path between genius and madness is awful.\" In another letter concerning the Compton effect he wrote, \"I don't understand Dirac at all.\"He was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge, was a member of the Center for Theoretical Studies, University of Miami, and spent the last decade of his life at Florida State University.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Antimatter", "response": [" by Paul Dirac.

Anderson found that cosmic-ray collisions produced these particles in a cloud chamber\u2014 a particle detector in which moving electrons (or positrons) leave behind trails as they move through the gas. The electric charge-to-mass ratio of a particle can be measured by observing the radius of curling of its cloud-chamber track in a magnetic field. Positrons, because of the direction that their paths curled, were at first mistaken for electrons travelling in the opposite direction.  Positron paths in a cloud-chamber trace the same helical path as an electron but rotate in the opposite direction with respect to the magnetic field direction due to their having the same magnitude of charge-to-mass ratio but with opposite charge and, therefore, opposite signed charge-to-mass ratios.", "Solutions of the Dirac equation contain negative energy quantum states. As a result, an electron could always radiate energy and fall into a negative energy state. Even worse, it could keep radiating infinite amounts of energy because there were infinitely many negative energy states available. To prevent this unphysical situation from happening, Dirac proposed that a \"sea\" of negative-energy electrons fills the universe, already occupying all of the lower-energy states so that, due to the Pauli exclusion principle, no other electron could fall into them. Sometimes, however, one of these negative-energy particles could be lifted out of this Dirac sea to become a positive-energy particle. But, when lifted out, it would leave behind a hole in the sea that would act exactly like a positive-energy electron with a reversed charge. These holes were interpreted as \"negative-energy electrons\" by Paul Dirac and mistakenly  identified  with protons in his 1930 paper A Theory of Electrons and Protons", "* Paul Dirac"]}, {"page": "August 8", "response": ["*1902 \u2013 Paul Dirac, English-American physicist and academic, Nobel Prize laureate (d. 1984)"]}, {"page": "Arthur Eddington", "response": ["His basic approach was to combine several fundamental constants in order to produce a dimensionless number.

New principles of a \"quantum\" rather than a \"classical\" mechanics, formulated in matrix-form by Werner Heisenberg, Max Born, and Pascual Jordan in 1925, were based on the probabilistic relationship between discrete \"states\" and denied the possibility of causality. Quantum mechanics was extensively developed by Heisenberg, Wolfgang Pauli, Paul Dirac, and Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, who established an equivalent theory based on waves in 1926; but Heisenberg's 1927 \"uncertainty principle\" (indicating the impossibility of precisely and simultaneously measuring position and momentum) and the \"Copenhagen interpretation\" of quantum mechanics (named after Bohr's home city) continued to deny the possibility of fundamental causality, though opponents such as Einstein would metaphorically assert that \"God does not play dice with the universe\". The new quantum mechanics became an indispensable tool in the investigation and explanation of phenomena at the atomic level.
