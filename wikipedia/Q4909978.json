Luxton was also a Member of the Legislative Council from 1989 to 2001, and served on the Executive Council of the Falkland Islands in the 1980s.Luxton was born in the Falkland Islands and educated in the United Kingdom before moving back to the islands to manage his family's farm at Chartres. In 1982 Argentina invaded and occupied the Falklands for 74 days during which time Luxton was identified by the Argentine military junta as a potential troublemaker. Along with his wife, Patricia, and their children, Luxton was deported to the UK where he became notable for giving numerous interviews about his experiences with the Argentine military. Luxton and his family returned to the islands at the end of the Falklands War.Luxton's portfolios in the Falkland Islands Government included Civil Aviation, Development Corporation, Aquaculture and Rural Development. Luxton is noted for his strong criticism of Argentina's policy on the Falkland Islands. Luxton resigned from the Legislative Assembly in 2011 due to his prologued absence from the Falklands, which was increasing the workload on other MLAs. He was replaced by Ian Hansen in an uncontested by-election.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Legislative Council of the Falkland Islands", "response": ["The Argentine military junta invaded the Falklands on 2 April 1982, starting the Falklands War. During their military occupation of the islands, the Argentine government shut-down the Legislative Council and deported several of its elected members (most notably Bill Luxton and his family), describing them as potential troublemakers. British forces liberated the Falkland Islanders from Argentine occupation on 14 June 1982, with civilian rule being restored on 25 June with the return of Governor Rex Hunt."]}, {"page": "Occupation of the Falkland Islands", "response": ["Residents considered critical of the Argentines were expelled from the islands.  This included Bill Luxton whose family had been resident in the Falklands since the 1840s and the editor of the Falkland Islands Times David Colville.  This proved embarrassing in the international press and so 14 residents of Stanley considered to be potential troublemakers were imprisoned and  were sent to Fox Bay East and placed under house arrest.", "The Argentine military police arrived on the islands with detailed files on many islanders. One of their first actions was to arrest and deport noted critics of links to Argentina including David Colville, as well as Bill Luxton and his family.  Such deportations proved internationally embarrassing, as Bill Luxton gave numerous interviews on his deportation, and subsequently detainees were imprisoned at Fox Bay."]}, {"page": "William Robert Luxton", "response": ["#REDIRECT Bill Luxton"]}, {"page": "Ian Hansen", "response": ["Ian Hansen (born 1958) is a Falkland Islander farmer and politician who has served as a Member of the Legislative Assembly for the Camp constituency since winning an uncontested by-election in 2011 which filled the seat vacated by Bill Luxton.
