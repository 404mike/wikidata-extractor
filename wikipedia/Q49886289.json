He also served as a magistrate and as a member of the Metropolitan Drainage Board.Watchorn was declared elected unopposed to the Legislative Council in June 1881, filling a vacancy in the Huon electorate caused by the invalidation of Joseph Solomon's 1880 election. However, his election was challenged by petition, and in August 1881 the Elections and Qualifications Committee of the Legislative Council unseated Watchorn and declared William Fisher, Solomon's 1880 challenger, to have been elected. Fisher died on 3 April 1882, and Watchorn won the resulting May 1882 by-election comfortably. He was re-elected numerous times and served in the Legislative Council until his death in 1905.He died in office in March 1905 and was buried at Cornelian Bay Cemetery.Watchorn married Dorcas Anne Blakey (n\u00e9e Collins) on 15 August 1854.
