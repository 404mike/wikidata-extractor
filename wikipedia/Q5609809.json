This made it possible to shoot almost entirely on location for both exteriors and interiors, helping to give the series a startling degree of realism and elevating London as a character of its own. Using film also allowed directors to feature many more action sequences. Directors Tom Clegg, Terry Green, Douglas Camfield, David Wickes, Mike Vardy and William Brayne were among the group of \"guerrilla filmmakers\" that realised the episodes. What they and the crews delivered is a fast-paced series, depicting the Squad's relentless battle against armed robbery; but it also includes a substantial degree of humour. For the period it has a high degree of on-screen violence, and it is not unknown for several deaths to occur in an episode.", "In Sweeney 2, Regan and Carter are on the trail of particularly violent armed criminals.
