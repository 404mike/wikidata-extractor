A strained medial ligament was diagnosed and the injury was expected to keep him on the sidelines for up to two months. However, the injury became infected, causing Holmes to spend five days in hospital over the New Year period and after remaining in pain, he learnt the knee required an operation which would keep him out for the remainder of the season and he underwent surgery on 14 February 2002. With Lincoln on the verge of administration, Holmes along with four other senior players was released at the end of the season bringing an end to his third spell with the club."]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 Notts County F.C. season", "response": ["| 03 || DF || Paul Mayo || 2 || 0", "| Paul Mayo"]}, {"page": "History of Mansfield Town F.C.", "response": ["David Holdsworth made a fantastic impact in his start at the Stags, winning the majority of his games, instantly guiding the club away from their relegation worries.
