It lasted for just two issues, but was cited in the Situationist tract On the Poverty of Student Life as an example of one of the \"profoundly revolutionary tendencies in the critique of all aspects of the prevailing way of life.\" Its treatment of popular culture has since been hailed as path-breaking: the critic Jon Savage has said that one piece by Radcliffe \"laid the foundation for the next 20 years of sub-cultural theory.\"\nHeatwave was closely associated with Rebel Worker, a short-lived but influential magazine published in Chicago by Franklin Rosemont, Penelope Rosemont, and Bernard Marszalek, to which Radcliffe was a contributor. They were members of the Industrial Workers of the World with links to the Surrealist movement in France, the British libertarian socialist group Solidarity and the Situationist International.\nRadcliffe became a member of the English section of the S.I. in December 1966, alongside Chris Gray (situationist), Donald Nicholson-Smith and T. J. Clark. He resigned in November 1967, and Gray, Nicholson-Smith and Clark were expelled shortly thereafter.\nBetween early 1970 and summer 1972 Radcliffe was involved with the magazine Friends, sharing a flat with its editor, Alan Marcuson.\nRadcliffe is a descendant of Moll Davis.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Industrial Workers of the World", "response": ["These ties to anti-authoritarian and radical artistic and literary currents would link the IWW even more heavily to the 60s counterculture, exemplified by the publication in Chicago in the 1960s of Rebel Worker by the surrealists Franklin and Penelope Rosemont. One edition was published in London with Charles Radcliffe, who went on to become involved with the Situationist International. By the 1980s, the Rebel Worker was being published as an official organ again, from the IWW's headquarters in Chicago, and the New York area was publishing a newsletter as well."]}, {"page": "Situationist International", "response": ["In the 1960s and 1970s, anarchists, communists, and other leftists offered various interpretations of Situationist concepts in combination with a variety of other perspectives.

Only two issues of the journal were produced, appearing in July and September 1966. The first issue positioned itself as an 'experimental, perhaps slightly crazed libertarian socialist journal', and included a statement of intent: 'HEATWAVE is not a rival to existing publications on the libertarian left, but an addition to the libertarian press and an extension of its ideology, both conscious and unconscious, into new fields. HEATWAVE wants to generate heat in every field. We believe the time is ripe for an explosion of revolutionary energy which would alter the face of the earth. HEATWAVE advocates the use of any and all means that may bring to a climax the crisis of capitalism and authoritarianism, and result in the total extinction of all forms of exploitation or authority.'", "*Articles on and by Charles Radcliffe and comrades"]}, {"page": "Radcliffe, Charles", "response": ["#redirectCharles Radcliffe"]}]}}
