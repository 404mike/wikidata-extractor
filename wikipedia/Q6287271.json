He was 21 years old. He was driven by, and in Parliament spoke of, a passionate conviction to avoid any future war, and this seemingly motivated his career. Largely because of his family background and war service, local Conservative and Labour Associations preferred Mosley in several constituencies \u2013 a vacancy near the family estates seemed to be the best prospect. He was unexpectedly selected for Harrow first. In the general election of 1918 he faced no serious opposition and was elected easily. He was the youngest member of the House of Commons to take his seat, though Joseph Sweeney, an abstentionist Sinn F\u00e9in member, was younger. He soon distinguished himself as an orator and political player, one marked by extreme self-confidence, and made a point of speaking in the House of Commons without notes."]}, {"page": "Sir Henry Wilson, 1st Baronet", "response": ["According to an associate of Collins, Joseph Sweeney, after the shooting of Wilson he saw Collins looking \"very pleased\" and asked \"where do we stand on the shooting?\".
