The same year, World in Action revealed the tricks behind political oratory by coaching a complete beginner, Ann Brennan, to deliver a speech which won a standing ovation at the annual conference of the Social Democratic Party, using techniques developed by Professor Max Atkinson. The eminent political commentator Sir Robin Day, covering the conference for BBC television, described Mrs Brennan's performance as \"The most refreshing speech we've heard so far.\""]}, {"page": "Rule of three (writing)", "response": ["The use of a series of three elements is also a well-known feature of public oratory.

His own contribution to that book analysed the use of the particle 'oh' in conversation.  This showed how 'oh' performed important conversational functions in displaying the speaker's change of state, from not knowing to knowing something.  He has since followed up this study with work on 'oh' in response to assessment and as a preface to answering a question, as well as considering the implications of the study of 'oh' for understanding cognition."]}]}}
