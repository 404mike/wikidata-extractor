Internationally renowned as a viola virtuoso, she also became one of the first female professional orchestral players. Born in England (of a German mother and an American father), Rebecca Clarke claimed both British and American nationalities and spent substantial periods of her long life in the United States, where she permanently settled after World War II. She was born in Harrow and studied at the Royal Academy of Music and Royal College of Music in London. Stranded in the United States at the outbreak of World War II, she married composer and pianist James Friskin in 1944. Clarke died at her home in New York at the age of 93.\nAlthough Clarke's output was not large, her work was recognised for its compositional skill and artistic power. Some of her works have yet to be published (and many were only recently published); those that were published in her lifetime were largely forgotten after she stopped composing. Scholarship and interest in her compositions revived in 1976. The Rebecca Clarke Society was established in 2000 to promote the study and performance of her music.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 27", "response": ["*1886 \u2013 Rebecca Clarke, English viola player and composer (d. 1979)"]}, {"page": "October 13", "response": ["*1981 \u2013 Rebecca Clarke, English viola player and composer (b. 1886)"]}, {"page": "Viola", "response": ["The viola often plays the \"inner voices\" in string quartets and symphonic writing, and it is more likely than the first violin to play accompaniment parts. The viola occasionally plays a major, soloistic role in orchestral music. Examples include the symphonic poem, Don Quixote, by Richard Strauss, and the symphony/concerto, Harold en Italie, by Hector Berlioz. In the earlier part of the 20th century, more composers began to write for the viola, encouraged by the emergence of specialized soloists such as Lionel Tertis and William Primrose. English composers Arthur Bliss, York Bowen, Benjamin Dale, Frank Bridge, Benjamin Britten, Rebecca Clarke and Ralph Vaughan Williams all wrote substantial chamber and concert works. Many of these pieces were commissioned by, or written for Lionel Tertis. William Walton, Bohuslav Martin\u016f, T\u014dru Takemitsu, Tibor Serly, Alfred Schnittke, and B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k have written well-known viola concertos. The concerti by B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k, Paul Hindemith, Carl Stamitz, Georg Philipp Telemann, and William Walton are considered major works of the viola repertoire. Paul Hindemith, who was a violist, wrote a substantial amount of music for viola, including the concerto Der Schwanendreher.", "Charles Wuorinen composed his virtuosic Viola Variations in 2008 for Lois Martin. Elliott Carter also wrote several works for viola including his Elegy (1943) for viola and piano; it was subsequently transcribed for clarinet. Ernest Bloch, a Swiss-born American composer best known for his compositions inspired by Jewish music, wrote two famous works for viola, the Suite 1919 and the Suite H\u00e9bra\u00efque for solo viola and orchestra. Rebecca Clarke was a 20th-century composer and violist who also wrote extensively for the viola. Lionel Tertis records that Edward Elgar (whose cello concerto Tertis transcribed for viola, with the slow movement in scordatura), Alexander Glazunov (who wrote an Elegy, Op.\u00a044, for viola and piano), and Maurice Ravel all promised concertos for viola, yet all three died before doing any substantial work on them.", "Among the great composers, several preferred the viola to the violin when they were playing in ensembles, the most noted being Ludwig van Beethoven, Johann Sebastian Bach and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Other composers also chose to play the viola in ensembles, including Joseph Haydn, Franz Schubert, Felix Mendelssohn, Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k, and Benjamin Britten. Among those noted both as violists and as composers are Rebecca Clarke and Paul Hindemith. Contemporary composers and violists Kenji Bunch, Scott Slapin, and Lev Zhurbin have written a number of works for viola."]}, {"page": "Lionel Tertis", "response": ["Many fine English violists were students of Tertis, including Rebecca Clarke, Eric Coates, Winifred Copperwheat, Paul Cropper, Harry Danks, C.

His two principal allies in this undertaking were the violinist Henry Holmes and Stanford. In a study of the founding of the college, David Wright notes that Stanford had two main reasons for supporting Grove's aim. The first was his belief that a capable college orchestra was essential to give students of composition the chance to experience the sound of their music. His second reason was the severe contrast between the competence of German orchestras and the performance of their British counterparts. He accepted Grove's offer of the posts of professor of composition and (with Holmes) conductor of the college orchestra. He held the professorship for the rest of his life; among the best known of his many pupils were Samuel Coleridge-Taylor, Gustav Holst, Ralph Vaughan Williams, John Ireland, Rebecca Clarke,Ponder, Michael. \"Clarke, Rebecca Helferich (1886\u20131979)\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 21 December 2011  Frank Bridge and Arthur Bliss."]}, {"page": "Royal Academy of Music", "response": ["Former students include Olga Athaide Craen, John Barbirolli, Judith Bingham, Harrison Birtwistle, Dennis Brain, Alan Bush, Doreen Carwithen, Rebecca Clarke, Jacob Collier, Clifford Curzon, Edward Gardner, Lesley Garrett, Evelyn Glennie, Eleanor Greenwood, Dorothy Howell, Katherine Jenkins, Elton John, Annie Lennox, Felicity Lott, Moura Lympany, Vanessa-Mae, Denis Matthews, Michael Nyman, Elsie Southgate, Eva Ruth Spalding, Florence Margaret Spencer Palmer, Ashan Pillai, Simon Rattle, Cecile Stevens, Arthur Sullivan, Eva Turner, Maxim Vengerov, Henry Wood and Carol Anne Williams."]}, {"page": "Ivor Gurney", "response": ["The adults of most significance in Gurney's early life were the Rev.
