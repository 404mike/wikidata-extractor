Salvidge was not a member of the Orange Order but he claimed on the Glorious Twelfth of July 1891 that his principles and the Orangemen's were one and the same due to the WMCA's requiring members \"to be a sound Protestant\". Due to the high Irish immigration into Liverpool and the widespread sectarianism in the city, Salvidge managed to galvanise Liverpool's Protestant population behind the Conservative Party in their opposition to Irish Home Rule.", "link_mentions": {}}}
