Salvidge was not a member of the Orange Order but he claimed on the Glorious Twelfth of July 1891 that his principles and the Orangemen's were one and the same due to the WMCA's requiring members \"to be a sound Protestant\".

Speaking to Edward Carson, F.E. Smith, Austen Chamberlain and Lord Balcarres in December after two weeks of receiving negative letters from party members about the change, Law outlined that he would not be averse to a return to the previous policy considering the negative feelings from the party, but felt that this would require the resignation of both himself and Lansdowne."]}, {"page": "Liverpool City Council", "response": ["|Archibald Salvidge"]}, {"page": "F.
