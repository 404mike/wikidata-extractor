His passion for researching his own family's history eventually grew into his compilation of Geslachts-Registers der Oude Kaapsche Famili\u00ebn, a complete (in so far as it was possible) genealogy of colonists' descendants born at the Colony of the Cape of Good Hope during the Dutch period (1652\u20131806).He died of pneumonia with his life's work uncompleted and leaving his family in penury, having expended all his resources on his research. On his death-bed, he extracted a promise from his friend and mentor, the historian George McCall Theal, to finish the work and have it published.", "link_mentions": {}}}
