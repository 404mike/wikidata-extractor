Young's figures for the total area of England and Wales, and total cultivated area, were serious overestimates. In a work from 1799, during wartime and fiscal strain on the national budget, Henry Beeke gave more reliable figures, showing Young had erred."]}, {"page": "Regius Professor of History (Oxford)", "response": ["*1801\u20131813 \u2013 Henry Beeke"]}, {"page": "University Church of St Mary the Virgin", "response": ["*1782\u20131790: Henry Beeke"]}, {"page": "Dean of Bristol", "response": ["*1813\u20131837 Henry Beeke"]}, {"page": "Beeke", "response": ["*Henry Beeke (1751\u20131837), English historian, theologian, and writer"]}, {"page": "List of botanists by author abbreviation (B)", "response": ["* Beeke \u2013 Henry Beeke (1751\u20131837)"]}, {"page": "Beekite", "response": ["Beekite, recognised as small, concentric rings (cylinders, ellipsoids, or spheres in 3D) of microcrystalline quartz is recorded as first brought to attention of geologists by Henry Beeke, probably from studies around Torbay.
