After receiving little education and no inheritance from his father, Prince Albert offered Seymour a junior appointment in the colonial service. Seymour held positions in various British colonies from 1842 to 1863, when he returned to England\nFrom 1864 to 1866, he served as the second Governor of the Colony of British Columbia, succeeding Sir James Douglas. He would enter government at a time of unrest, with the Fraser River gold rush causing violence within the colony and had to deal with large debts left over from Douglas's time as governor. \nDuring his time as Governor, Seymour was involved in the aftermath of the Chilcotin Uprising and made better relations with local indigenous groups of British Columbia. He believed the colony would endure as its own entity and constantly invested in different initiatives he hoped would further the economic growth of the colony, from the construction of roads to bringing infrastructure to British Columbia. Though opposed to it, Seymour played a major role in the development of the constitution that would be used to unite of British Columbia and Vancouver Island. Seymour continued to serve as the first governor of the union of the two colonies, also named the Colony of British Columbia from 1866 to 1869. Also Seymour was a key player in developing, creating and cementing a relationship with the indigenous nations such as the sto:lo.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mount Seymour", "response": ["Mount Seymour is a mountain located in Mount Seymour Provincial Park in the District of North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

Mount Seymour is most commonly identified for its ski area of the same name, and as a popular hiking area.

Annexationists (or, at least, anti-confederationists) were in control of the Legislative Council of British Columbia, however, and in February 1869 passed a resolution opposing confederation; until his death the colonial governor, Frederick Seymour, also opposed confederation. Successor Anthony Musgrave supported confederation (after being unsuccessful in bringing Newfoundland into Canada) but due to an accident was delayed in his duties; meanwhile, annexation support revived during the winter of 1869\u20131870. One hundred and four individuals, about one percent of the white population of the colony, signed an 1869 petition to President Ulysses S. Grant asking for annexation. While there is no reason to believe that they accurately represented the majority opinion, many colonists viewed Washington and London as equal competitors for British Columbia's loyalty depending on who offered more incentives, while Ottawa was more foreign and less familiar.

In 1865, Dewdney was appointed by Governor Frederick Seymour to oversee the construction of a trail to the East Kootenay region of the British Columbia Interior so that coastal merchants might benefit from the burgeoning trade associated with gold mining in that area. This was also done to secure a line of communication within the region to prevent an American takeover of that part of the province. Although used for only a few years, parts of the Dewdney Trail, as it was known, remain to this day and are used for recreational hiking.

By now, Robson had toned down his rhetoric about responsible government as the colonial assembly began to accrue more power. He was a reluctant supporter of the colony's union with Vancouver Island in 1866, but by 1869, Robson had moved his newspaper's operations across the Strait to Victoria. It was soon bought out by the rival Daily British Colonist (today the Victoria Times-Colonist), which had been founded by De Cosmos. There Robson served as political editor for six years, and became a passionate advocate for the colony's union with Canada, formed as a confederation of four colonies of British North America on 1 July 1867.

Following the death of Frederick Seymour, Musgrave took up his new responsibilities as colonial governor in August, 1869.  Musgrave found a colony in an administrative and financial mess, with a fractious assembly, long-simmering disputes between the two colonies and their capitals \u2013 Victoria and New Westminster\u2014and general frustration with the slow pace of negotiations for the colony to enter confederation.  Musgrave proved to be both a capable administrator, and an able placater of the assembly's notoriously contentious members.
