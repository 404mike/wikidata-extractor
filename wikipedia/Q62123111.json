His father was also William Jay, who had started working with his father as a stonemason, but became a Congregationalist minister. In 1807 the younger William became an apprentice of the architect and surveyor David Riddall Roper.\nJay's designs for Surrey Chapel Almshouses were exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1814. He designed Dr. Fletcher's Albion Chapel in London, laying the foundation stone the following year. In 1817 he moved to the United States for four years, where he established as an architect in Savannah, Georgia. His American work includes the Owens-Thomas House, the William Scarbrough House, Telfair Academy, and The Savannah Theatre. The  design of the Bulloch\u2013Habersham House, which he designed, would later be replicated with the Habersham Memorial Hall.\nWhen the economy of Georgia collapsed in 1822, Jay returned to England and worked primarily in Cheltenham. Later, he went bankrupt and in 1836 moved with his family to the island of Mauritius, where he was an architect and civil engineer until his death in Port Louis.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Jay (minister)", "response": ["thumb|Portrait and signature of William Jay, about 1810", "The Rev.
