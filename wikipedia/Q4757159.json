Grassie paints highly detailed and self-referential tempera on paper copies of photographs.\nHe was educated at St Martins School of Art and the Royal College of Art.Grassie's work of the late 1990s and early 2000s included tempera on paper studies of the gallery interior in which they were exhibited (1997), and small copies of photographs of 1960s minimalist sculpture (2002).In 2004, he won a \"Special Merit\" award at the 23rd John Moores Painting Prize for his work The Making of the Painting, which shows the space in which he made the painting. In 2005 he had a solo exhibition at Tate Britain, as part of the Art Now series. He exhibited tiny paintings of an imaginary \"rehang\" of works from the gallery. To make the paintings Grassie moved the actual works to the exhibition space, photographed them, and then made copies of the photographs in tempera.His paintings have been praised for being \"disorienting\" and \"melancholy\", and criticised for consisting of \"bureaucratic ironies\".His works are held in the collection of the Tate and the United Kingdom Government Art Collection. He lectures at City and Guilds of London Art School.\nAndrew Grassie is represented by Maureen Paley in London.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tempera", "response": ["Other practicing tempera artists include Philip Aziz, Ernst Fuchs, Antonio Roybal, George Huszar, Donald Jackson, Tim Lowly, Altoon Sultan, Shaul Shats,  Sandro Chia, Alex Colville, Robert Vickrey, Andrew Wyeth, Andrew Grassie, and Ganesh Pyne."]}, {"page": "Sartorial Contemporary Art", "response": ["* Obsession, group exhibition curated by Robin Mason: Allman Mason, Debra Allman, Andy Bannister, Ann-Caroline Breig, Michael Buhler, Tony Carter, Gerald Davies, Teresita Dennis, Zavier Ellis, Tessa Farmer, Conrad Frankel, Shelly Goldsmith, Andrew Grassie, Takayuki Hara, Barnaby Hosking, Jane Howarth, Katarina Ivanisin, James Jessop, Tatsuya Kimata, Mette Klarskov Larsen, Gretta Sarfaty, Robin Mason, Hektor Mamet, Hugh Mendes, Gavin Nolan, Kate Palmer, Tim Parr, Hideyuki Sawayanagi, Wendy Smith, Amikam Toren, James Unsworth (13.10 -2.11.2006)"]}, {"page": "City and Guilds of London Art School", "response": ["The Fine Art Department is led by artist Robin Mason and consists of BA (Hons) Fine Art, GrdDip Arts: Fine Art and MA Fine Art.
