He participated in 3 World Championship Grands Prix and numerous non-Championship Formula One races. He scored no World Championship points.\nShawe-Taylor was born in Dublin, Ireland, the younger of two sons of Francis Manley Shawe-Taylor (1869\u20131920), magistrate and high sheriff for the county of Galway, and his wife, Agnes Mary Eleanor n\u00e9e Ussher (1874\u20131939).  His parents were members of the Anglo-Irish ruling classes; he was related to the playwright and co-founder of the Abbey Theatre, Lady Gregory and a cousin of Sir Hugh Lane who founded Dublin's gallery of modern art.Following the murder of the father in 1920 by Irish nationalists, the family moved to England, where Shawe-Taylor attended Shrewsbury School.Shawe-Taylor started racing before the war, winning the Nuffield Trophy in 1939. After the war he raced an ERA, with which he tried to enter the 1950 British Grand Prix. The organisers deemed his car to be too old, but he managed to take part in the race anyway, by sharing the Maserati 4CL of Joe Fry. The following year, he practiced a Ferrari entered by Tony Vandervell at the 1951 French Grand Prix, but ultimately Reg Parnell drove the car during the race.His entry was accepted for the 1951 British Grand Prix, despite the fact that he was still campaigning his old ERA, and he finished the race in 8th position as the top privateer, albeit six laps down on the winner. He also raced in the 24 Hours of Le Mans that year, sharing an Aston Martin DB2 with George Abecassis, finishing 5th. He was later seriously injured in an accident at Goodwood, when he spun the ERA and was hit by Toni Branca. Shawe-Taylor recovered but his career was ended.\nShawe-Taylor was the younger brother of the music critic Desmond Shawe-Taylor, and the father of the art historian and Surveyor of the Queen's Pictures, the younger Desmond Shawe-Taylor, LVO.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Aston Martin", "response": ["|  George Abecassis Brian Shawe-Taylor"]}, {"page": "George Abecassis", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|  Brian Shawe-Taylor"]}, {"page": "1950 British Grand Prix", "response": [": \u2014 Joe Fry qualified and drove 45 laps of the race in the #10 Maserati.

The UK was represented by 9 drivers. The race drew 200,000 spectators. At the start of the race, Farina took the lead with Fagioli and Fangio in pursuit, while Cabantous got a poor start and lost 4 positions. In the early laps they switched around between themselves several times to keep everyone amused. Fangio retired with engine troubles caused by a broken oil pipe and so Farina led Fagioli home by 2.5 seconds with Parnell a distant third despite hitting a hare during the race. The nearest challenger was Giraud-Cabantous two laps down, Bira having retired with a fuel problem. Crossley and Murray duelled at the back before retiring, de Graffenried had done so on lap 34, while Chiron was demoted to the role of viewer 10 laps earlier. Nino Farina led for 63 laps (1\u20139, 16\u201337 and 39\u201370). Luigi Fagioli led for 6 laps (10\u201315). Juan Manuel Fangio led for 1 lap (38).
