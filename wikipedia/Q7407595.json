One of Harvey Littleton's first students, Herman is credited as one of the founders of the Studio Glass movement in Great Britain. He was seminal in spreading the idea of the movement through his teaching positions in England, (at the Royal College of Art and the Buckinghamshire College of Higher Education), and Australia (at the Jam Factory Workshops in Adelaide) and through the exhibition of his own sculpture in glass. Through the years the artist has resided and established his personal studio in London, England (1979\u201390), South Australia (1974\u201379). From 1993 to his final years he maintained studios in Spain, London and Gloucestershire. Sam was represented by The Frestonian Gallery (London).\nSamuel Jacob Herman died 29 November 2020.

The impetus for the movement consisted of their two workshops at the Toledo Museum of Art, during which they began experimenting with melting glass in a small furnace and creating blown glass art.  Littleton and Labino were the first to make molten glass feasible for artists in private studios. Harvey Littleton extended his influence through his own important artistic contributions and through his teaching and training, including many of the most important contemporary glass artists, including Marvin Lipofsky, Sam Herman (Britain), Fritz Dreisbach and Dale Chihuly."]}, {"page": "List of University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison people", "response": ["* Sam Herman, glass artist"]}, {"page": "Harvey Littleton", "response": ["Through the University's glass program, Littleton taught many who became prominent glass artists, and who, in turn, spread the word about studio glassmaking into academic institutions throughout the United States.

After which, and at the invitation of Harvey Littleton, Valkema went to the University of Wisconsin in 1968 to teach 'European Glass Techniques' and introduced the use of color rods. His experiences in the United States helped provide the model basis for the 'Glass Work Group' at the Rietveld Academy. From the 1970s to the 1990s, he took part in exhibitions, seminars and symposiums throughout the world. After his retirement from the Rietveld Academy he worked in numerous glass studios in Europe and the United States. His own workshop in Blaricum was regularly expanded and remodelled with the help of his son Durk Valkema. As early as 1968, Valkema received a Royal decoration for his contributions in the Netherlands, which he would have refused had he been informed. In 1986 the Glasmuseet Ebeltoft honoured him by founding 'The Sybren Valkema Honorary Prize'.
