Morris was pleased that there were no sets: \"it was all shot in natural surroundings, in people's houses, in the stock exchange, in bars and so on\", in Toronto, Gravenhurst, and London, Ontario. Morris preferred shooting reality over filming on a set:You can imagine having a set, and outside  the window you have to burn it out, so it's not readable, or put up some phony backing or something; whereas if you're in a real situation   you can have people outside the window, even conversing through the window; you can see traffic going by  \u2014 things you can't do in film  studios.Another aspect of the project that pleased him was shooting with Canon high speed lenses. It started out as a problem created by Kodak coming out with a new stock (\"they never ask us, the people who use it\"), which made it impossible to make use of force processing. For Morris to not lose the \"extra stop\" (f-stop) gained by force processing, he had to look for other means, \"and that other means is a fast lens.\" With it, Morris said that the less light is used, \"you find that you don't really have to fill anything because it fills itself.\"There was a scene in a kitchen in Second  Wind that I shot virtually with existing light. The sun was shining through the kitchen window and it was hitting the floor and  bouncing up and filling the whole room. I had seen it and hadn't done much about it because I thought maybe the director doesn't go for that sort of thing, but much to my surprise Don Shebib said \"Wow, look at that!\" So I did shoot it without any other light. I couldn't  have done it without high speed lenses.Ordinarily, explained Morris, there is a certain difficulty with repeated takes under the shifting effects of the sun, the angles of sunlight and strength making match shots tricky.", "*Canadian Society of Cinematographers Feature Award (Reginald H. Morris, 1976)"]}]}}
