In 1992 he published Transit of Venus: Travels in the Pacific, which met with enthusiastic critical acclaim. This launched him on a career as a writer of books, travel articles, essays, and radio and television documentaries on literary subjects. He is also a translator and a reviewer for a number of newspapers and magazines, including the Guardian, Daily Telegraph, Times Literary Supplement and Prospect. His most recent full-length book was Semi-Invisible Man: the Life of Norman Lewis (2008), which was reviewed favourably; Evans was an appropriate biographer for the great writer and adventurer, as Norman Lewis had once described Evans's first book, Transit of Venus, as \"far and away the best book about the Pacific of our times.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Transit of Venus (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Transit of Venus: Travels in the Pacific, a 1992 book by Julian Evans"]}, {"page": "Yasmina Khadra", "response": ["* 2015: The Dictator's Last Night (La derniere nuit du rais), translated by Julian Evans (Gallic Books, 2015)"]}, {"page": "Where Are You Dying Tonight?", "response": ["Where Are You Dying Tonight? is a 1981 novel by the French writer Michel D\u00e9on. Its French title is Un d\u00e9jeuner de soleil, which literally means \"a sun's breakfast\" and is an expression for something short-lived. It tells the story of Stanislas Beren, a fictional 20th-century novelist, with excerpts from his novels and the events from his life that inspired them. An English translation by Julian Evans was published in 1983.", "G. S. Bourdain of The New York Times called the book \"highly literate\" and wrote: \"The story, which begins in 1925 and ends in 1977, is a delicious merging of narrative passages with excerpts from Stanislas' writings (footnotes included) and flashbacks to the events of his life that inspired those writings, not to mention numerous references to actual books, poems, paintings and people. ... The novel's citations of authors from Rimbaud to Maugham, descriptive phrases about paintings by artists from Giorgione to Picasso and mentions of real people from the period in which the book takes place are not only fun but also make one want to follow the Berens' trail through London and Paris to the art museums and trattorias of Venice.
