Consistent outstanding performances throughout the first month of the season brought much praise and attention to the young midfielder. Sky Sports pundits commented that he could \"easily play in the championship, if not higher.\" On the strength of this, Middlesbrough reportedly placed a late deadline day bid, but this was rejected by Rotherham. After topping the list of assists in League Two consistently since the start of the season, Law scored his first goal for Rotherham on 26 September against Barnet. By January, Rotherham turned down another bid for Law, this time a \u00a3150,000 offer from Championship side Blackpool. Though the bid was turned down, Manager Ian Holloway, himself, says the club kept himself distance from signing Law.

His only contribution to the 2003\u201304 Second Division title winning campaign was a late substitute appearance at the start of the season, and he was loaned out to David Moss's Macclesfield Town in October 2003. He played five Third Division games at Moss Rose, before he joined Tranmere Rovers permanently the following month, in a move that reunited him with former boss Brian Little. His signing was announced a day after Macclesfield announced that they had extended his loan deal for a further four weeks. He played 31 games for the \"Superwhites\" in 2003\u201304, as the club missed out on the Second Division play-offs by two places and six points.

He kept the score down to 2\u20131 to Bury."]}, {"page": "Exodus Geohaghon", "response": ["He joined Rotherham United on a one-month loan deal for August 2010. The loan was extended to three months after he became a key part of Ronnie Moore's back four. In November of that year Geohaghon joined Shrewsbury Town on loan until January, initially to help solve injury troubles to the team's key defenders Ian Sharps and David Raven. The deal was made just hours before kick-off against local rivals Crewe Alexandra. His loan spell ended prematurely, as after only three starts he picked up a knee injury that kept him in the treatment room for two months. In January 2011, Jim Gannon was appointed as Port Vale manager, and he immediately brought Geohaghon to Vale Park on loan until the end of the season. Over the course of just four victories in twelve consecutive games with Geohaghon as a holding midfielder, both he and Gannon became highly unpopular figures with some sections of the Vale support. This culminated in ugly scenes on 19 March, as Geohaghon confronted his detractors following a 3\u20131 defeat at Accrington Stanley's Crown Ground, with his manager leaving the stadium in secret for his own safety. Though Gannon was unpopular with players and fans, fan favourites and star players Gary Roberts and Marc Richards did stand by Geohaghon, calling the abuse he received \"unfair... terrible... not acceptable\" and \"harsh\". Two days later Gannon was sacked. Meanwhile, Geohaghon sought legal advice and claimed his scuffle with supporters came about after he reacted to racial abuse levelled at him by a number of fans. Unable to return to Peterborough by the terms of his loan, and unwilling to return to Vale Park, Geohaghon instead remained at his Birmingham home whilst the Football Association's investigation of racial abuse continued. The FA found that there was racist chanting from at least one Vale supporter."]}]}}
