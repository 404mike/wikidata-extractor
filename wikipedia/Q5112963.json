Alan Bass. London & New York: Routledge. pp. 36\u201376. Originally published as \"Cogito et histoire de la folie\", Revue de m\u00e9taphysique et de morale, 68/4 (oct.-d\u00e9c. 1963), 460-494. In this paper, Derrida questions the intentions and feasibility of Foucault's book, particularly in relation to the historical importance attributed by Foucault to the treatment of madness by Descartes in the Meditations on First Philosophy. Derrida's paper began a high-profile exchange between Derrida and Foucault as well as a considerable amount of attention from scholars.Boyne, R., 1990. Foucault and Derrida: The other side of reason. London: Unwin Hyman. p. 1. Foucault responded directly to Derrida in an appendix added to the 1972 edition of the History of Madness titled \"My body, this paper, this fire.\" Derrida again considered Foucault's 1961 text on madness with \"To do Justice to Freud: The History of madness in the age of psychoanalysis\" in 1991. The exchange between Derrida and Foucault was sometimes acrimonious and it is said that \"the two writers stopped communicating for ten years.\"Khalfa, J., 2006. \"Introduction\" from M.
