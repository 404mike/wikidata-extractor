The only goal of the game came in the 89th minute when Keith Edwards, who had come on as a substitute 17 minutes earlier, scored a header at the near post to give Leeds a one-goal advantage. The second leg of the semi-final was played three days later at Boundary Park.  Oldham opened the scoring in the 18th minute when Gary Williams headed in a cross from Denis Irwin.
