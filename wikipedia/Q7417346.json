He came to Burnley from Padiham in 1885 and was one of the club's regular full-backs, operating on the left or right side, as well as being the club captain, when Football League came to Turf Moor in 1888. He was born at Bridge of Weir, near Paisley, in 1864 and came south of the border to join Padiham as a 20-year-old in 1884. He brought with him a reputation as a versatile player but it was as a hard-tackling defender that he made his name. He missed only eight League games in the first seasons of League football and was the first Burnley player to complete 100 games for the club, in March 1893. The only two goals of his League career came in the previous season and the second was the club's first\u2013ever from a penalty\u2013kick, in a 3\u20132 win against West Bromwich Albion on 28 November 1891. The keeper Lang beat that day was Joe Reader, later to play for England. He played his last League game in March 1895 and became a publican in Burnley, although he later resumed his playing career, assisting Nelson to the Lancashire League Championship. He sustained fatal injuries in an accident at his home and died on 9 November 1901, aged 37.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Bury (footballer)", "response": ["Bury came to Turf Moor from local rivals Padiham in 1887, having built up a reputation as a hard-tackling defender with a number of local clubs. He immediately established a full-back partnership with Sandy Lang, who had also arrived at Turf Moor from Padiham and the two became stalwarts in the Burnley defence. William Bury appeared in twenty of Burnley's twenty-two League games in that historic first season of League football."]}, {"page": "Zacharious Carr", "response": ["Zacharious Carr was an English professional footballer who played as a defender. He played for Preston Hornets before joining Football League side Burnley in April 1890. He could not displace regular left-back Sandy Lang from the starting line-up, and subsequently played his only match for the club on 11 October 1890 in the 1\u20132 loss to Bolton Wanderers at Turf Moor, and left Burnley shortly afterwards."]}, {"page": "1889\u201390 Burnley F.C. season", "response": ["|Sandy Lang"]}, {"page": "1890\u201391 Burnley F.C. season", "response": ["|Sandy Lang"]}, {"page": "1891\u201392 Burnley F.C. season", "response": ["|Sandy Lang"]}, {"page": "Kavanagh (Burnley footballer)", "response": ["Kavanagh started his career in his native Scotland with Leith Harp and Hibernian before joining Football League side Burnley midway through the 1888\u201389 season. Kavanagh made his Burnley debut on 1 December 1888 at Thorneyholme Road, Accrington and he replaced Sandy Lang as right-back. The latter had switched to left-back. Burnley took on Accrington. The match was a nightmare for the Burnley defence and Burnley were 2-0 down after just five minutes. After thirty minutes matters got worse for Burnley because Ross McMahon was injured and had to leave the field so Burnley were down to ten men. Burnley got one back but Accrington made it 3-1 by half-time. The second half was one-way traffic and Accrington added two more to runout winners by 5-1."]}]}}
