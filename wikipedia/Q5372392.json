This is the original of J. H. Gurney's hymn, \"Yes, God is good\". There is some obscurity about the text. It is found in her Hymns for Children, Boston, 1825, beginning, \"God is good, each perfumed flower,\" and this obvious misprint (which destroys the metre) was usually copied in later books. It is also given with the same first line as an original piece, never before published, and signed \"E. L. C.\" (initials of Mrs. Follen's maiden name), in Emily Taylor's Sabbath Recreations, Wellington, Salop, 1826, page 203. This suggests that it was printed in the American book after the manuscript was posted to England. Follen may have written at first \"Yes, God is good,\" but this cannot now be determined. It begins, \"God, Thou art good,\" in her Poems, 1839, page 119, and in her verses, The Lark and the Linnet, 1854, and in each case is in six stanzas of 4 1ines, with the title, \"God is Good.\" "]}, {"page": "Ada R.
