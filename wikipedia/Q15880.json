As a drummer, Taylor was recognised early in his career for his unique sound. He was voted the eighth-greatest drummer in classic rock music history in a listener poll conducted by Planet Rock in 2005.As a songwriter, Taylor contributed songs to Queen's albums from the beginning, composing at least one track on every album, and often singing lead vocals on his own compositions. He wrote or co-wrote three UK number ones (\"These Are the Days of Our Lives\", \"Innuendo\" and \"Under Pressure\") and contributed to a further five major hits (\"Radio Ga Ga\", \"A Kind of Magic\", \"Heaven for Everyone\", \"Breakthru\", and \"The Invisible Man\"). He was also the main writer on the international top-ten hit \"One Vision\", although the track is credited to the whole band. He has collaborated with such artists as Eric Clapton, Roger Waters, Roger Daltrey, Robert Plant, Phil Collins, Genesis, Jimmy Nail, Kansas, Elton John, Gary Numan, Shakin' Stevens, Foo Fighters, Al Stewart, Steve Vai, Yoshiki, Cyndi Almouzni, and Bon Jovi. As a producer, he has produced albums by Virginia Wolf, Jimmy Nail, and Magnum.\nIn addition to his drum work, Taylor is well known for his falsetto vocal range. He sometimes played keyboards, guitars and bass on his own songs. During the 1980s, in addition to his work with Queen, he formed a parallel band known as the Cross, in which he was the lead singer and rhythm guitarist. During the early 1980s, Taylor was also a panellist on the popular UK quiz show Pop Quiz, hosted by Mike Read.

During the making of the track, four additional studios \u2013 Roundhouse, Sarm Studios, Scorpio Sound, and Wessex Sound Studios \u2013 were used. According to some band members, Mercury mentally prepared the song beforehand and directed the band throughout.", "A rapid series of rhythmic and harmonic changes introduces a pseudo-operatic midsection, which contains the bulk of the elaborate vocal multi-tracking, depicting the narrator's descent into hell. While the underlying pulse of the song is maintained, the dynamics vary greatly from bar to bar, from only Mercury's voice accompanied by a piano to a multi-voice choir supported by drums, bass, piano, and timpani. The choir effect was created by having May, Mercury, and Taylor repeatedly sing their vocal parts, resulting in 180\u00a0separate overdubs. These overdubs were then combined into successive submixes. According to Roger Taylor, the voices of May, Mercury, and himself combined created a wide vocal range: \"Brian could get down quite low, Freddie had a powerful voice through the middle, and I was good at the high stuff.\" The band wanted to create \"a wall of sound, that starts down and goes all the way up\".

In Freddie Mercury: The definitive biography, Lesley-Ann Jones theorises that it is also a figurative representation of the four members: Mercury, May, Taylor, and Deacon respectively. The section concludes with a full choral treatment of the lyric \"Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me!\", on a block B major chord. Roger Taylor tops the final chord with a falsetto B in the fifth octave (B5).", "The New York Times commented that \"the song's most distinct feature is the fatalistic lyrics\". Mercury refused to explain his composition other than to say it was about relationships; the band is still protective of the song's secret. Brian May supports suggestions that the song contained veiled references to Mercury's personal traumas. He recalls \"Freddie was a very complex person: flippant and funny on the surface, but he concealed insecurities and problems in squaring up his life with his childhood. He never explained the lyrics, but I think he put a lot of himself into that song.\" May, though, says the band had agreed that the core of a lyric was a private issue for the composer.
