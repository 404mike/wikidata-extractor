This was the result of his overall season, that as usual commenced on the French Riviera. Prior to that he was drafted into a Queen's Club \u2013 Sporting Club de Paris warm-up team challenge. He contributed to the Parisian victory with two mixed and a singles win. The following month he swept almost all available Riviera titles from February to March. He kicked off the tour by winning his first mixed New Courts L.T.C title with his U.S. Championships partner Eileen Bennett. In February he successfully defended his M\u00e9tropole Club and Gallia L.T.C. singles titles by defeating Henry Mayes twice in a row. In the Monaco Cup at the La Festa Country Club Cochet turned the tide from two sets down against two-times reigning champion B\u00e9la von Kehrling, the first meeting of a rivalry that continued onward into the year. They both reached the mixed doubles final, which remained unplayed and the prize was divided. The Cochet \u2013 Brugnon pair also won the Butler Cup there (reserved for doubles of the same nationality). At the Nice Lawn Tennis Club tournament they met again for the singles contest and Cochet won in straight sets. Cochet completed his second triple crown there. In Menton at the official Riviera Championships eventual singles victor Von Kehrling and former Danish Champion Erik Worm warded off Cochet and Count Salm in the doubles final. In the mixed Von Kehrling and Cilly Aussem beat the seasoned duo Cochet\u2013Bennett. His third C\u00f4te d'Azur trophy was granted to him after Otto Froitzheim traveled home before the final and gave him a walkover. One week later at the 50th Cannes Championships he reached the final to face Henry Mayes again, but due to misunderstandings he was 10 minutes late and had been defaulted from the tournament. Subsequently, he lost the mixed doubles match alongside Phyllis Satterthwaite and only found his form in the doubles with Jack Hillyard at the expense of their opponents Count Salm and Worm. In April at the Biarritz tournament Cochet routed compatriot Roger George in four sets. He was victorious in Marseilles versus Emmanuel Du Plaix and in the mixed with Cilly Aussem. The Miramar L.T.C. tournament in Juan-les-Pins resulted in a three set final between Ren\u00e9 Gall\u00e8pe of Monaco and Cochet and ended in favor of the Frenchman."]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 1924 Summer Olympics", "response": ["|align=left| Phyllis Satterthwaite"]}, {"page": "Dorothy Shepherd-Barron", "response": ["Between 1920 and 1939 she participated in 15 editions of the Wimbledon Championships.

In February 1927 he reached the finals of the New Courts of Cannes mixed contest with Elizabeth Ryan. Next week at the Gallia L.T.C. of Cannes tournament came short in both doubles championship matches; in mixed with Ryan to Henri Cochet and Eileen Bennett and the men's with Ren\u00e9 Gall\u00e8pe to Cochet-Charles Aeschlimann. In June at the inaugural of the newly built Margaret Island courts of Budapest the Hungary Davis Cup team hosted an international meeting with Denmark with the latter team victorious.

In March 1928 at the Menton Cup he paired with Phyllis Satterthwaite and marched to the semifinal match against Cochet-Bennett with the latter team advancing to the final round. He took revenge on Cochet and his partner Salm in the doubles final where he and Kehrling won in straights The two of them went to the final of the singles where the Hungarian doubles partner beat him in a fierce fight. In April 1928 he found success in several tournaments throughout Europe, the Beausite mixed trophy with Ryan from Cochet and Satterthwaite (Worm also was a contender for the men's doubles), the Beaulieu tournament against George Lyttleton-Rogers and  the Pforzheim mixed doubles event in July again alongside Ryan. Next year he defended his Menton doubles title with Kehrling against the Italian duo of Giorgio de Stefani and Alberto del Bono. Although the defending champions split for the mixed and faced each other at the final with Kehrling making a good decision by choosing Cilly Aussem, while Worm and Satterthwaite finished second. In the April edition of the Monte-Carlo tournament Worm clinched the title by beating Junior Monaco champ Wilbur Coen. In mixed O'Connell and Elizabeth Ryan overcame Worm and Satterthwaite. In May George Lyttleton-Rogers had a clean victory over Worm in the singles last four of the L.T.C. Beaulieu tournament. He was more lucky in the doubles where he and Jack Hillyard became the Riviera champions after eliminating the Austrian Davis-Cup partners Hermann Artens and Ludwig Salm-Hoogstraeten. And in the follow-up mixed rematch of O'Connell-Ryan and Worm-Satterthwaite the Danish-Briton team equalized the tally. O'Connell and Worm met again in the mixed final of the Montreux tournament at Switzerland, where they played with Muriel Thomas and the returning Cilly Aussem respectively, but the latter team hadn't found his form yet.
