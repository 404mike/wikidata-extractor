Her Perfect Dark Zero model was redesigned by manga artist Wil Overton. Joanna Dark is among Rare's most well known characters and has been featured in several \"top lists\" by the gaming media.", "In Perfect Dark Zero, Joanna was redesigned by manga artist Wil Overton. Overton added more distinctive elements, including a star tattoo on the left side of her neck, a blonde streak in her hair, and a choppy outline to her hairstyle. Her hair was also changed from short and red to shoulder-length and orange. Hollis stated that while he liked the new concept work, he could not imagine why she would wear the orange. According to him, \"It is uncharacteristic. Quite apart from the practical problem of being a beacon for bullets\u2014Secret Agents don\u2019t wear orange for good reason.\" Process for her character design went through several alterations. Images of the initial concept were met with much derision among the fans who criticized Joanna's new manga-like appearance. In response, the developers chose to tone down some of the more stylized aspects of the design, eventually arriving at a more realistic appearance. For the cancelled sequel Perfect Dark Core, Dark was altered to fit the game's realistic atmosphere, being described as a \"smoking, flirting\" version."]}, {"page": "Perfect Dark Zero", "response": ["Initially, the game had a heavy anime style and Joanna Dark received many alterations throughout the development process. Lead Art Director Wil Overton explained that they \"wanted to bring her back in line with the way Rare do things. [...] We sorta wanted to stylize her up a bit and make her more iconic\". However, the designers ultimately decided to tone down the styling of the game a bit. The Xbox 360 gave the developers more possibilities to include what they always wanted and allowed them to create the game's co-operative mode, which was one of the first that could be played via Xbox Live. Designing the co-operative mode over Xbox Live was very challenging for the developers. According to Duncan Botwood, who was responsible for most of the multiplayer, \"it was quite an effort to put it in, to be honest. You have to cater for a number of eventualities you just don't get normally. We think we pulled it off, and because we pulled it off, other people might feel inspired to put the effort in, and we think that's a good thing\"."]}, {"page": "Super Play", "response": ["It also featured in-depth, intelligent and passionate coverage of all aspects of gaming. Given the close ties between the world of Japanese console RPGs and animation, the magazine also heavily featured information about manga and anime by noted UK based writer, Helen McCarthy. It can be said that Super Play was one of the magazines that helped to push forward what was at the time a nascent market for anime in the UK. In this vein, the magazine itself was also notable as its cover illustrations (and many illustrations between the covers) were done in manga-influenced style by artist Wil Overton. Overton also caricatured many of the staff in chibi form, wearing various types of anime-related costumes - sci-fi armour, flying gear, RPG-style armour etc. The cover even had the name \"Super Play\" written in katakana.", "Its end came with the declining popularity of the SNES itself, both among games publishers and the game-buying public, as the Nintendo 64 was on the cusp of release, making way for the next generation of video game consoles. Super Play was succeeded in March 1997 by N64 Magazine, which was initially edited by Jonathan Davies with Wil Overton as Art Editor, and frequent contributions by former Super Play writers, although the magazine was much less focused on import gaming and RPGs than its forebear. N64 Magazine in turn was renamed NGC Magazine to coincide with the launch of the Nintendo GameCube, and after closure of NGC in 2006 the publication was relaunched as NGamer.", "In September 2017, inspired by the announcement of a Super NES Classic Edition, original staff, including Jason Brookes, Jonathan Davies, Tony Mott and Zy Nicholson, along with seasoned Nintendo experts Nathan Brown, Keza MacDonald, Damien McFerran, Jeremy Parish and Chris Schilling, produced a one-off issue 48 of Super Play, which came bundled with Retro Gamer issue 172. Featuring all-new content it consists of the regular sections Super Express, Helen McCarthy's Anime World and a What Cart? guide. Also inside are new reviews of the games included on the SNES Classic, a Star Fox 2 preview and an interview with Dylan Cuthbert, one of the key developers behind the game. Cover art was created by Wil Overton, illustrator of all 48 Super Play covers, with the internal visual style resurrected by Future's senior art editor Warren Brown, who ensured the design will be immediately familiar to fans of the '90s magazine."]}, {"page": "William Overton", "response": ["*Wil Overton, British artist, specialising in manga styles"]}, {"page": "NGC Magazine", "response": ["The staff of NGC Magazine varied over the years.

Overton came in for much more than his fair share of insults and jokes, but he was a vital part of the reason that N64 Magazine stood out so much on the shelves: his manga-styled cover art was different from anything on other magazines, and his years of experience, love for RPGs and generally somewhat eccentric nature were comforting for many hardcore gamers."]}, {"page": "Tony Lee", "response": ["*Bandits: Agent of P.A.W.S (32 page graphic novella, art by Wil Overton, November 2018)"]}, {"page": "Nintendo Gamer", "response": ["* Wil Overton", "*Download: A section dedicated to retro gaming and fielded by \"R.O.B.'s brother: DR64\", as designed by illustrator Wil Overton."]}, {"page": "List of video game crowdfunding projects", "response": ["| Book project.
