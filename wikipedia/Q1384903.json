With Ebenezer Cunningham, he expanded the views of spacetime symmetry of Lorentz and Poincare to a more expansive conformal group of spacetime leaving Maxwell's equations invariant. Moving to the U.S.A., and obtaining a Ph.D. in geometry with Frank Morley, he became a professor of mathematics at California Institute  of Technology. There he taught fluid dynamics to students going into aerodynamics with Theodore von Karman. Bateman made a broad survey of applied differential equations in his Gibbs Lecture in 1943 titled \"The control of an elastic fluid\".", "Harry Bateman first grew to love mathematics at Manchester Grammar School, and in his final year, won a scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge. Bateman studied with coach Robert Alfred Herman preparing for Cambridge Mathematical Tripos. He distinguished himself in 1903 as Senior Wrangler (tied with P.E. Marrack) and by winning the Smith's Prize (1905). He published his first paper when he was still an undergraduate student on \"The determination of curves satisfying given conditions\". He studied in G\u00f6ttingen and Paris, taught at the University of Liverpool and University of Manchester before moving to the US in 1910. First he taught at Bryn Mawr College and then Johns Hopkins University. There, working with Frank Morley in geometry, he achieved the PhD, but he had already published more than sixty papers including some of his celebrated papers before getting his PhD. In 1917 he took up his permanent position at California Institute of Technology, then still called Throop Polytechnic Institute."]}, {"page": "Morley's trisector theorem", "response": ["In plane geometry, Morley's trisector theorem states that in any triangle, the three points of intersection of the adjacent angle trisectors form an equilateral triangle, called the first Morley triangle or simply the Morley triangle.
