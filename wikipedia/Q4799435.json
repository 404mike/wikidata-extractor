He attended King Edward VI School, Southampton, until he was twelve and on 28 December 1581 he was elected a scholar of Winchester College. He stayed at Winchester until he was eighteen when he became a scholar of New College, Oxford. He matriculated in July 1588, was elected a fellow of the college in 1589, accepted the degree of BA on 4 June 1591 and MA on 3 May 1595. He was presented to the rectory of Havant, Hampshire in 1599. He resigned his fellowship at Oxford in 1600, and on 16 June was admitted a fellow of Winchester College. In 1601 he became rector of Hambledon (near Havant), and of Chilcomb, near Winchester, in 1603.\nHe was awarded a DD at Oxford and in 1609 he may have been one of the clergymen charged with editing the new English translation of the Bible commissioned by James I for whom his brother Sir Thomas acted as a secretary. There is no unequivocal evidence for this but the initials \"AL\" appear throughout the notes of the General Committee of Review and no other candidate has been proposed.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "May 4", "response": ["*1626 \u2013 Arthur Lake, English bishop and scholar (b. 1569)"]}, {"page": "1569", "response": ["* September \u2013 Arthur Lake, English bishop, a translator of the King James Bible (d. 1626)"]}, {"page": "Thomas Morton (bishop)", "response": ["In 1609 James I made him Dean of Winchester, where Thomas Bilson, who conferred on him the living of Alresford.

Lake's wife and daughter then threatened to accuse Cecil of having an affair with his grandfather's young second wife. This charge was entirely false but when Cecil fled to Rome, Anne Lake forged incriminating letters.  Lady Exeter charged Lake, his wife, his son and his daughter with defamation of character.  Anne was accused of \"precontracts, adultery, incest, murder, poison\" against her husband, Lord Roos.  As part of the legal action, Lake and his wife submitted a bill to the Star Chamber, which was defended by Lord Roos who counter-sued with a bill submitted by his grandfather, the Earl of Exeter.", "On 21 April Lake's son and secretary William was put in custody because he attempted to pass secret letters to Lady Roos and tried to escape when accosted and on 3 June Arthur Lake was placed in custody having published a slanderous pamphlet.  But the misbehaviour was not confined to the Lakes: Parker, Clerk of the Star Chamber, was also incarcerated on 3 June because he acted in bad faith in examining Lady Roos.", "On 19 June Lake was brought back to the Star Chamber and told that he must make a public confession that the sentence brought against him was just, and that he had inflicted an injury upon the Countess of Exeter.  He pleaded not guilty; so too did his wife, even though their daughter had confessed that her slanders about incest with Lady Roos, poisoning, and requests for forgiveness for crimes were inventions written by Arthur Lake and copied by Hobbie, Lady Roos' maid, with her father and mother accomplices.  The King considered this to be the height of contempt against his Royal Majesty but a month later he agreed to free Lake from prison and put him in the custody of his brother Arthur, Bishop of Bath and Wells.  Lake's daughter was also freed.  Lake did not leave the Tower immediately; he chose to stay there a while longer to arrange his private affairs."]}, {"page": "Arthur Lake", "response": ["Arthur Lake may refer to:", "*Arthur Lake (bishop) (1569\u20131626), bishop of Bath and Wells", "*Arthur Lake (actor) (1905\u20131987), American actor known best for Dagwood Bumstead, the bumbling husband of Blondie", "*Arthur Lake (MP) (1598\u20131633), English politician", "*Arthur Lakes (1844\u20131917), geologist, artist, writer, teacher and minister"]}, {"page": "Samuel Ward (scholar)", "response": ["In 1610, Sidney elected him to the mastership of the college and he was created D.D., having been admitted B.D. in 1603.
