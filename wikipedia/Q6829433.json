Bruce Wells reported, however, that scholars debate the meaning of the word \"pattern.\" One possibility is that the item God showed Moses represented God's dwelling place in the heavens. The other possibility is that  refers simply to a scale model of the structure that God commanded Moses to build. Wells noted that several ancient Near Eastern texts support this second option, referring to instances where gods revealed models of or plans for religious objects to those responsible for building them. In one Middle Babylonian document, a clay model of the statue of the god Shamash was miraculously discovered near the Euphrates, which showed long-missing information about how the statue was to look and what clothing was to adorn it, allowing the Babylonian king to then make a new statue.Bruce Wells. \"Exodus.\" In Zondervan Illustrated Bible Backgrounds Commentary, edited by John H.

Plaut reported that the school of Julius Wellhausen considered the \"Tent\" tradition the older and the \"Tabernacle\" passages as retrojections of the Priestly source and therefore as largely unhistorical. Plaut reported that another theory assigned the Ark and Tabernacle to a northern and the Tent of Meeting to a southern source and held that David, by putting the Ark into the Tent in , united the tribes and traditions and that thereafter the term \"Tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting\" ", "*Carol Meyers. \"Exodus.\" In The New Oxford Annotated Bible: New Revised Standard Version with the Apocrypha: An Ecumenical Study Bible.

Alter explained that the dye was not derived from a plant, as is indigo, but from a substance secreted by the murex, harvested off the coast of Phoenicia. The extraction and preparation of this dye were labor-intensive and thus quite costly. It was used for royal garments in many places in the Mediterranean region, and in Israel it was also used for priestly garments and for the cloth furnishings of the Tabernacle. Alter argued that the indigo twist betokened the idea that Israel should become (in the words of ) a \"kingdom of priests and a holy nation\" and perhaps also that, as the covenanted people, metaphorically God's firstborn, the nation as a whole had royal status.Robert Alter. The Five Books of Moses: A Translation with Commentary. New York: W.W. Norton & Co., 2004. Similarly, Professor Nili Fox of Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion wrote that it is no accident that the violet-blue wool cord that  required be attached to the fringes is identical to the cord that hangs from the priest's headdress in . Fox argued that the tzitzit on the Israelites\u2019 garments identified them as being holy to God and symbolically connected them to the priests. Thereby, the Israelites pledged their loyalty to God as well as to the priests who oversaw the laws.Nili S. Fox. \"Numbers.\" In The Jewish Study Bible. Edited by Adele Berlin and Marc Zvi Brettler. And similarly, Terence Fretheim, Professor Emeritus at Luther Seminary, argued that tassels, worn by royalty in the ancient Near East, were to be attached to each corner of everyone's garments, with a blue(-purple) cord on each, as a public sign of Israel's status as a holy people and a reminder of what that entailed.Terence E.
