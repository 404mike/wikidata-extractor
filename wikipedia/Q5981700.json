He again wasted no time in installing Yorath as his assistant. With only eight players turning up to his first training session, and star player Martin Smith defecting to Northampton Town, many supporters would have been happy to see the side consolidate and not slip any further down the league. But some shrewd signings (including Rob Edwards, Tony Carss, Efe Sodje, Steve Yates and goalkeeper Ian Gray), the emergence of a talented group of youngsters, and the prolific form of the previously ineffective Jon Stead made Town among the early pace-setters for the Division. As winter approached, Jackson's young side became more inconsistent and seemed to be fading but a change of formation tightened up the defence. Goalkeeper Paul Rachubka was brought in as the side found a new resilience and the ability to grind out narrow victories. Stead's form saw an offer from Sunderland, that was rejected, but he was snapped up by Premiership Blackburn Rovers for around \u00a31.2\u00a0million in January and was replaced by Polish U21 striker Pawel Abbott who had been unable to establish himself at Preston North End.", "|1||Ian Gray||||GK||17||0||1||0||3||0||1||0||0||0||22||0"]}, {"page": "2004\u201305 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["|1||Ian Gray||||GK||12||0||0||0||1||0||0||0||13||0"]}, {"page": "List of Huddersfield Town A.F.C. players", "response": ["|Ian Gray||||2003\u20132004||29||0||1||0||4||0||1||0||0||0||35||0"]}, {"page": "Ian Gray", "response": ["Ian Gray (or similar) may refer to:", "* Ian Gray (athlete) (born 1963), Belizean Olympic athlete", "* Ian Gray (English footballer) (born 1975), English former football goalkeeper", "* Ian Gray (Australian footballer) (1963\u20132010), Australian football player", "* Ian Gray (Australian magistrate), Chief Magistrate of the Magistrates' Court of Victoria", "* Ian Gray (comics) (1938\u20132007), British comics writer and editor", "* Ian Gray (actor), appeared in Pickwick (1969)"]}, {"page": "2002\u201303 Rotherham United F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|30||align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Ian Gray"]}, {"page": "2000\u201301 Rotherham United F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|1||align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Ian Gray"]}, {"page": "List of Rochdale A.F.C. players (25\u201399 appearances)", "response": ["|Ian Gray"]}]}}
