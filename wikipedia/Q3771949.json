He studied philosophy and literature at the universities of Lancaster and Exeter.\nIn 1990 Duncan moved to London, where he worked as a bookseller for four years, writing in his spare time. In 1994 he visited India with his father (part roots odyssey, part research for a later work, The Bloodstone Papers)  before continuing on to the United States, where he spent several months travelling the country by Amtrak train, writing much of what would become his first novel, Hope, published to critical acclaim on both sides of the Atlantic in 1997.\nHis novel I, Lucifer was published in 2002. The premise of the book is that Lucifer has been given a month to live in mortal form to get himself back into God's good graces before the end of the world. The film rights have been sold.\nThe book was provided with a \"soundtrack\" by Duncan's longtime friend Stephen Coates and his band The Real Tuesday Weld, a cross-platform collaboration repeated for Duncan's book The Last Werewolf. The pair have toured and performed at various live events and festivals together including at the British Film Institute. \nAccording to critic William Skidelsky in The Observer, Duncan \"specialises in writing novels that can't easily be pigeon-holed\". Similarly, David Robson in The Daily Telegraph has noted that Duncan is \"an idiosyncratic talent\", adding,\"You never know quite which way he is going to turn.\"In 2013, Glen Duncan took the pseudonym of Saul Black to publish a thriller, The Killing Lessons, in 2015.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Anagram", "response": ["* \"Glen Duncan\" = \"Declan Gunn\"I, Lucifer (Glen Duncan)"]}, {"page": "Earl Scruggs", "response": ["*Flatt and Scruggs won a Grammy Award in 1968 for Scruggs' instrumental \"Foggy Mountain Breakdown\".

Lucifer, not wanting redemption, takes God\u2019s offer for a trial but instead takes it as a month's holiday. This story takes place in London and Lucifer lives in the body of Declan Gunn (an anagram of \"Glen Duncan\", the author's name), formerly a struggling writer who is suicidal.  While in Declan\u2019s body, Lucifer takes his body for granted and abuses drugs, alcohol, and sex. Not only does Lucifer still live a devilish life, but also he starts to realize what being a human is really like. He realizes there is so much going on in their lives and so much temptation, and people can\u2019t simply do whatever they please. As Lucifer\u2019s trial is coming to an end, he receives a visit from the angel Raphael, who attempts to help Lucifer head in the right direction. Raphael tells him the world is going to end so there\u2019s no choice but to gain redemption from rebelling against God and be accepted back into heaven. Lucifer makes his decision. The whole story is permeated by the main character's versions of biblical episodes and his disparaging opinions about God and \"Jimmeny\" (Jesus).", "A soundtrack album for the novel was released by The Real Tuesday Weld.
