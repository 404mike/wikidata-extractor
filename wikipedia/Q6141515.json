Foreigners have rarely imitated us. English settlers everywhere play at cricket; but of no single club have we heard that dieted either with frogs, saur-kraut (sic) or macaroni\"). His hagiography favourably compared the virtues of Victorian cricket with the disgraceful state of play at the turn of the century where \"Lord\u2019s was frequented by men with book and pencil, betting as openly and professionally as in the ring at Epsom, and ready to deal in the odds with any and every person of speculative propensities\".\nPycroft was also a cricketer, appearing in four matches now considered as first-class for Oxford University (where he was at Trinity College) in 1836 and 1838 and in one for a team called \"Left-Handers\" in 1838. He studied law at Lincoln's Inn but then became a Church of England priest and was perpetual curate at Barnstaple, Devon, 1845\u201356. He wrote several books, including volumes of autobiography.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bullingdon Club", "response": ["The Wisden Cricketer reports that the Bullingdon is \"ostensibly one of the two original Oxford University cricket teams but it actually used cricket merely as a respectable front for the mischievous, destructive or self-indulgent tendencies of its members\". By the late 19th century, the present emphasis on dining within the Club began to emerge. Long attested that in 1875 \"Bullingdon Club [cricket] matches were also of frequent occurrence, and many a good game was played there with visiting clubs. The Bullingdon Club dinners were the occasion of a great display of exuberant spirits, accompanied by a considerable consumption of the good things of life, which often made the drive back to Oxford an experience of exceptional nature\". A report of 1876 relates that \"cricket there was secondary to the dinners, and the men were chiefly of an expensive class\".James Pycroft in London Society, v.30, 1876 (James Hogg, Florence Marrayat ed.); p. 197 The New York Times told its readers in 1913 that \"The Bullingdon represents the acme of exclusiveness at Oxford; it is the club of the sons of nobility, the sons of great wealth; its membership represents the 'young bloods' of the university\"."]}, {"page": "Billy Beldham", "response": ["In his reminiscences to James Pycroft in 1836, Beldham said that, when he was eighteen years old in the 1784 season, he had played for Farnham against Hambledon and scored 43 runs.Underdown, p. 157. He was watched by George Finch, 9th Earl of Winchilsea who was cricket's most influential patron at the time and, the following spring, Winchilsea visited Beldham at the farm where he worked and arranged with his employer for him to have time off in order to play cricket. Beldham was invited to play for Hampshire in June 1785 against All-England at White Conduit Fields, the start of his career in top-class cricket.", "Although his last recorded first-class match was in 1821 (aged 55), there is strong anecdotal evidence that he continued to play - in his Oxford Memories, Pycroft stated \"Beldham's was a green old age. Even when between sixty and seventy [1826\u20131836] he was barred in county matches\".James Pycroft (1886) Oxford Memories. Vol. II, Richard Bentley & Sons. p. 126.", "Although he was remembered primarily as a fine attacking batsman, Beldham was an all-rounder who took many wickets by operating as a change bowler. When he was interviewed by James Pycroft, Beldham claimed that he, William Fennex and Harry Walker had revolutionised batting by introducing the cut (Walker) and forward play (Beldham and Fennex).Harry Altham (1962) A History of Cricket, Volume 1 (to 1914), George Allen & Unwin. p. 46. This is contradicted by John Nyren who says that the earlier Hambledon batsman Tom Sueter was noted for his cut shot and probably invented forward play, being the first player known to leave his crease and play the drive.Nyren, p. 60.", "During a period of the game's history when betting and match-fixing was rife, Beldham was not immune to the lure of easy money. When interviewed by Pycroft in the late 1830s, he said: \"You may hear that I sold matches. I will confess I once was sold myself by two men, one of whom would not bowl, and the other would not bat, his best, and lost ten pounds. The next match, at Nottingham, I joined in selling, and got my money back. But for this once, I could say I never was bought in my life ; and this was not for want of offers from C and other turfmen, though often I must have been accused. For where it was worth while to buy, no man could keep a character; because to be out without runs or to miss a catch was, by the disappointed betting-men, deemed proof as strong as Holy Writ\".James Pycroft (1886) Oxford Memories. Vol. II, Richard Bentley & Sons. p. 125.", "Beldham retired to Tilford, where he was initially the landlord for some years of a public house, The Barley Mow, and spent his last 41 years there. The census returns of 1841, 1851 and 1861 refer to him as, variously, a \"bat maker\" and an \"old cricketer\". In his seventies, he was interviewed by James Pycroft, author of The Cricket Field.James Pycroft (1854) The Cricket Field, Longman One of the common misconceptions concerning Beldham is that he fathered anything up to thirty six children by two wives. While he did marry twice, he was in reality far less prolific: by his first wife Ann Smith (1765\u20131800) he had one daughter whilst with his second wife, another Ann (1779\u20131869) he had eight children between 1804 and 1819."]}, {"page": "Bibliography of cricket", "response": [";James Pycroft"]}, {"page": "White Conduit Club", "response": ["It is not known for certain when the WCC was founded but it seems to have been after 1780 and certainly by 1785.

The famous batsman Billy Beldham was hired while still a young professional by the WCC in 1785 and he told James Pycroft, author of The Cricket Field (1851) that his farming employer concluded a deal with George Finch, 9th Earl of Winchilsea to allow Beldham time away from his agricultural duties to go to the \"new cricket ground\" at White Conduit Fields and play for Hampshire (or more accurately, the Hambledon Club) against All-England.

These two schools eventually developed a fierce rivalry that has become the schools cricket equivalent of Cambridge v Oxford or Yorkshire v Lancashire, but they did not meet again until 1818 (twice) and 1822; after that, the fixture has occurred annually except for 1829\u20131831, 1856 and in wartime. James Pycroft in The Cricket Field commented on the betting at the 1825 game but, by 1833, the match had become a social highlight and The Times noted \"upwards of thirty carriages containing ladies\".Birley, p. 68. Also by this time, the main public schools had grouped themselves into an elite circle and all other schools were decidedly viewed as second class by comparison.
