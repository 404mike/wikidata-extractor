The discussion prompted a reaction, including from authors such as Philip Pullman and Amanda Craig, that Rajesh characterised as racist, writing in The Guardian that \"a sinister realisation dawned as they closed ranks and appeared to reply to white critics only\", with \"a group of white women authors pointedly demean[ing]\" the women of colour \"as 'activists' who were 'attacking' Clanchy\".

In The Monthly, Ramona Koval wrote that the work was \"devastating, utterly compelling\". In an essay in the website The Conversation, the writer was of the opinion that Garner \"fails to address the broader issues of gender inequality and male violence\". In The Australian, Peter Craven wrote that the book was \"some kind of masterpiece and Garner creates, moment by moment, with a breathtaking suspension of judgment, the whirlwind that blows across every corner of this story like a hard rain that comes with the force of a desolation, sparing nothing.\" Craven also noted that Garner had previously written about legal cases as \"an old hand at using a novelist\u2019s technique to create a pointillist image of a trial\" in The First Stone and Joe Cinque's Consolation. In UK daily newspaper The Guardian Kate Clanchy wrote, \"[\u2026] the whole book feels final, elegiac \u2013 perhaps because for all the horror, it is so elegantly and calmly written; perhaps because This House of Grief completes so many arcs begun in Garner's previous works; perhaps because it is impossible to imagine it being done better\"."]}, {"page": "Nutshell (novel)", "response": ["Nutshell received generally positive reviews from book critics. Book Marks, the review aggregator of Literary Hub, assigned the book an average grade of B+. In The Guardian, Kate Clanchy began by admitting: \"This may not sound like an entirely promising read: a talking foetus could be an unconvincing or at least tiresomely limited narrator, and updatings of Shakespeare often strain at their own seams. From the start, though, McEwan manages to establish both the groggy, gripping parameters of the uterus\u2014'My limbs are folded hard across my chest, my head is wedged into my only exit. I wear my mother like a tight-fitting cap'\u2014and that this foetus, Hamlet-style, is 'king of infinite space'\".  She found the book's retelling of Hamlet to have \"a strong forward momentum\" and to be not only a \"brutally effective\" thriller, \"but many other sorts of book too\". Despite finding some faults with the novel's social satire, characterisation, and portrayal of contemporary life, she concluded that \"... the architecture wins. This book is organised so thoroughly, in its plot, characters and themes, around the central image of the foetus suspended in the churnings of gravity and time [...]. Like TS Eliot's \"Marina\", also a riff on Shakespeare, it is a consciously late, deliberately elegiac, masterpiece, a calling together of everything McEwan has learned and knows about his art.\""]}, {"page": "2018 in poetry", "response": ["* Cholmondeley Award: Vahni Capildeo, Kate Clanchy, Linton Kwesi Johnson, Daljit Nagra, Zo\u00eb Skoulding"]}]}}
