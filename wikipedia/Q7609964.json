He published his first novel, The Reluctant Lover, in 1912. His best-known novel, Sonia: Between Two Worlds, was published in 1917. It was the tenth best-selling novel for 1918 in the United States, and also made into a British film of the same name in 1921.\nMcKenna was the son of Leopold and Ellen McKenna. He was educated at Westminster School (Scholar), London, and at Christ Church, Oxford (Exhibitioner). He gained a second-class honours degree in history at Oxford in 1909. After graduation, he taught briefly at Westminster School but found teaching uncongenial. Independent means allowed him to travel in Europe, Asia, Africa, and America. He was medically unfit for active service during the First World War but worked in the War Trade Intelligence Department, 1915\u201319, and served in Arthur Balfour's Mission to the United States of America, 1917.The partly autobiographical While I Remember (1921) conveys a flavour of McKenna's early years, including his time at Oxford.\nThe satirical moral inversion in McKenna's Confessions of a Well-Meaning Woman was acknowledged by C.S. Lewis as an influence on the latter's Screwtape letters: \"the blacks all white and the whites all black\".McKenna's The Oldest God (1926) is a philosophical fantasy novel featuring the god Pan.He wrote Tex. A chapter in the life of Alexander Teixeira de Mattos, a biography about Alexander Teixeira de Mattos, the Dutch journalist who translated books from many languages into English, a.o. Louis Couperus, whom McKenna befriended in 1921.\nHis uncle was Reginald McKenna, Chancellor of the Exchequer under H. H. Asquith, of whom he published a biography in 1948, Reginald McKenna, 1863-1943: A Memoir.\nHis clubs were the Reform and the Garrick. For a considerable portion of his adult life he lived at 11 Stone Buildings, Lincoln's Inn, London.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Louis Couperus", "response": ["In 1920 Iskander (a novel about Alexander the Great) was published in Groot Nederland; critics were not positive because of the many gay scenes. In October 1920 Couperus travelled for the Haagsche Post to Egypt; his travelogues were published weekly. In Africa he visited Algiers, travelled to Constantine, Biskra, Touggourt and Timgad and then continued his journey to Tunis and the ruins of Carthage, where he met a pupil of Marie-Louis-Antoine-Gaston Boissier. After this Couperus went back to Algiers, because he wanted to see the boxing skills of Georges Carpentier. Afterwards he wrote: I thought that in my life I have written too many books and boxed too little. On 3 May 1921 Couperus and his wife returned to Marseille and travelled to Paris, in time to be present at the festivities held for the canonization of Joan of Arc. On 1 June, Couperus and his wife left for England, where they would meet Alexander Teixeira de Mattos and during which visit Couperus wrote With Louis Couperus in London-Season; these stories were published in the Haagsche Post. In England Couperus met Stephen McKenna and Edmund Gosse. McKenna had written the forewords for Majesty and Old People and the Things that Pass.
