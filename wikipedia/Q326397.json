Rovers would proceed to become a cost-cutting club, due to the exhaustion of their parachute payments across multiple seasons, large amounts of debts beginning to surface reportedly within the region of \u00a3100 million, and a lack of investment from their owners Venkys, culminating in their relegation to League One."]}, {"page": "Andy Rhodes", "response": ["He is the father of Scotland international striker Jordan Rhodes."]}, {"page": "Darren Moore", "response": ["On 1 March 2021, Moore left Doncaster with the club in the League One play-off positions to join Sheffield Wednesday, sitting inside the Championship relegation zone.
