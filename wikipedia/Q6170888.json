At the age of 14, Damae was discovered by a photographer from the teen magazine Bravo in Germany and began modeling. Soon after, she started receiving offers from music and film producers which she declined, preferring to sing and write in a punk band, and to do freelance and studio gigs. She later met Ramon Zenker, who she admired from Hardfloor. He invited her to his studio to see if they could work together. Damae describes the musical chemistry between them as \"amazing\" and Damae soon found herself with a record deal as the singer for Fragma. Following the success of Fragma, Damae became the presenter for Dance:District on onyx.tv in Germany and got to interview Paul van Dyk, Ti\u00ebsto, WestBam, Jean Jacques Smoothie, Junior Jack, Boogie Pimps, Milk & Sugar, Mousse T. and many more."]}, {"page": "2 People (Jean Jacques Smoothie song)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jean Jacques Smoothie"]}]}}
