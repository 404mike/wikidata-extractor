Adie began his career in the late 1940s with Heart of Midlothian, spending seven years with the Tynecastle side before moving back to Fife with East Fife. The defender spent three years at Bayview Park before having a short spell in 1958 with Dundee United, making his debut in August of that year. A couple of months later, Adie lost his first-team place and appears to have been released shortly after.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tam McKenzie", "response": ["McKenzie captained Hearts during the 1949-50 season. He later saw off the challenge of Jock Adie to retain his place for the 1956 Scottish Cup Final victory. He eventually lost his place in the side to the emerging George Thomson during the 1957-58 season but he made enough appearances to collect a winners medal, as Hearts won the League title for the first time since 1897."]}, {"page": "Adie, Jock", "response": ["#redirectJock Adie"]}]}}
