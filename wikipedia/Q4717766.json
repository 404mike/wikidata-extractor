In six seasons as a licence-holder Scott trained 164 winners. His most notable horses were the future Epsom Derby winner Lammtarra and the 1991 Breeders' Cup Sprint winner Sheikh Albadou.

With two furlongs left, Walter Swinburn got clear and Lammtarra gathered speed. Frankie Dettori's swoop on 9-1 shot Tamure had seemed certain to carry him to victory, but Lammtarra quickly made up at least six lengths in the last one and a half furlongs. He overtook Tamure deep inside the final furlong and won going away by a length. There were emotional scenes in the winner's enclosure afterwards, as Swinburn and Sheikh Mohammed paid tribute to Alex Scott.  Normally, bookmakers will cancel a bet if the person placing it dies.

He became a housemaster at his alma mater for a year while studying for the bar exams, teaching English and bringing the C stream of English into competition with the A stream, as well as controlling rowdy audience members of his Shakespeare productions by pelting them with mint imperials.  He also sang with the local Gilbert & Sullivan pursuing a love of music and singing that continued throughout his life with both choral societies and jazz bands.  He was called to the bar at Gray's Inn in 1968 and joined the Chambers at 1\u00a0King's Bench Walk after serving a pupillage there with David Smout.  He practised mainly in criminal law on the Midland and Oxford Circuit, with a side line in personal injury.  He was most well known for his ability to connect with a jury and see to the crux of a matter.  He served as defence counsel in the Matrix Churchill case in 1992, and in the murder trial of Beverley Allitt in 1993 after which families of the victims praised his sensitive conduct of a powerful defence. He was prosecution counsel in the trial of groom Clem O'Brien for the murder of racehorse trainer Alex Scott in 1995.  Such was his appeal to a jury that the police famously sought a change in the law in order to be able to appoint him to a case on the name of a victim rather than a defendant in order to ensure that he would not be against them."]}, {"page": "Beeswing Stakes", "response": ["| Alex Scott"]}, {"page": "Firth of Clyde Stakes", "response": ["| Alex Scott"]}, {"page": "Joel Stakes", "response": ["| Alex Scott"]}, {"page": "Alex Scott", "response": ["Alex Scott may refer to:", "*Alex Scott (footballer, 1913\u20131962), English football goalkeeper who played for Wolverhampton Wanderers and Crewe Alexandra.", "*Alex Scott (footballer, 1936\u20132001), Scottish football winger who played for Rangers and Everton.", "*Alex Scott (footballer, born 1984), English television presenter, Pundit, former English female football who played for Arsenal.", "*Alex Scott (footballer, born 2003), English football midfielder who plays for Bristol City.", "*Alex Scott (racehorse trainer) (1960\u20131994), British racehorse trainer murdered in 1994", "*Alex Scott (cricketer) (born 1990), Hong Kong cricketer", "*Alex Scott (actor) (1929\u20132015), Australian-British actor who starred in shows such as The Saint and Randall & Hopkirk", "*Alex Scott (1996\u20132004), founder of Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation, a nationwide U.S. charity to raise funds for pediatric cancer research", "*Alex Scott (politician) (born 1940), Bermudian politician who served as Premier, 2003\u20132006"]}, {"page": "Newmarket Stakes", "response": ["| Alex Scott"]}, {"page": "Sceptre Stakes", "response": ["| Alex Scott"]}, {"page": "Sheikh Albadou", "response": ["Sheikh Albadou was sent into training with Alex Scott at Newmarket, Suffolk.", "|Alex Scott", "|Alex Scott", "|Alex Scott", "|Alex Scott", "|Alex Scott", "|Alex Scott", "|Alex Scott", "|Alex Scott", "|Alex Scott", "|Alex Scott", "|Alex Scott", "|Alex Scott", "|Alex Scott", "|Alex Scott", "|Alex Scott"]}, {"page": "Cartier Champion Sprinter", "response": ["| Alex Scott"]}, {"page": "Cadeaux Genereux", "response": ["In 1989 Olivier Douieb gave up the training of Maktoum Al Maktoum's horses and the stable was taken over by the first-season trainer Alex Scott.
