He was born in the village of Eastburn, between Skipton and Keighley in Yorkshire, UK. During his youth he developed a keen interest in natural history from walks on the York Moors. At 15 he attended Keighley College of Arts and Crafts and then the Royal College of Art in London. He graduated with a Silver Medal awarded for Special Distinction in the School of Design (then the highest order).\nIn 1940 he commenced his career as a freelance illustrator at the British Museum (Nat. Hist.). To avoid the disruption of the London Blitz during World War II he moved to Letchworth at the invitation of a colleague, Frederick Wallace Edwards. Edwards died shortly afterwards, but had put Smith in touch with James Edward Collin, for whom he produced 950 illustrations for the latter\u2019s book on British empididae. The book was eventually published in 1961.\nSmith also collaborated with Dame Miriam Rothschild illustrating her book: Fleas, Flukes and Cuckoos (Rothschild and Clay, 1952). This led to him illustrating, with over 1000 drawings, An Illustrated Catalogue of the Rothschild Collection of Fleas (Siphonaptera) in the British Museum (Natural History), an enormous work of 5 large volumes published between 1953 and 1971.\n\nHis work illustrated over 60 books, pamphlets and reports in addition to other freelance work for magazines. In 1960 he became a member of staff of the British Museum (Nat. Hist.) as the first (and possibly the last) insect illustrator to be employed in the Department of Entomology.\nArthur Smith's last major undertaking was the illustration of  a two volume work, British Tortricoid Moths, co-authoring with J. D. Bradley and W. G. Tremewan. However, before the publication of the book he had retired to Shaftesbury, Dorset. He continued to produce art work up to a few weeks before his death.\nArthur Smith married Margaret Eagle in 1940. He was survived by his wife, who died in 2001, and by two of his three children (Paul and Jean) and five grandchildren. His elder daughter, Heather, died in 1978.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Miriam Rothschild", "response": ["Rothschild was a leading authority on fleas. She was the first person to work out the flea's jumping mechanism. She also studied the flea's reproductive cycle and linked this, in rabbits, to the hormonal changes within the host. Her New Naturalist book on parasitism (Fleas, Flukes and Cuckoos) was a huge success. Its title can be explained as: external parasites (e.g. fleas), internal parasites (e.g. flukes) and others (the cuckoo is a 'brood parasite'). Along with Professor G. Harris, Rothschild determined that myxomatosis, a virus affecting tapeti and brush rabbits, was spread by fleas, not mosquitoes as previously understood. The Rothschild Collection of Fleas (founded by Charles Rothschild) is now part of the Natural History Museum collection and her six-volume catalogue of the collection (in collaboration with G. H. E. Hopkins and illustrated by Arthur Smith) took thirty years to complete."]}, {"page": "Arthur Smith", "response": ["Arthur Smith may refer to:", "*Arthur Smith (U.S. Representative) (1785\u20131853), U.S. Representative from Virginia", "*Arthur Smith (Australian politician) (1902\u20131981), member of the Victorian Legislative Council, 1958\u20131961", "*Arthur Smith (assemblyman) in 29th New York State Legislature", "*Arthur Smith (burgess 1685) on List of members of the Virginia House of Burgesses", "*Arthur Smith (burgess 1703) on List of members of the Virginia House of Burgesses", "*Arthur Smith-Barry, 1st Baron Barrymore (1843\u20131925), Anglo-Irish Conservative politician", "*Arthur Smith (American football, early 1900s), American football player and coach in the early 1900s", "*Arthur Smith (American football, born 1982), American football player and coach", "*Arthur Smith (footballer, born 1887) (1887\u2013?), English association footballer", "*Arthur Smith (footballer, born 1915) (1915\u20132021), English association footballer", "*Arthur Smith (footballer, born 1879) (1879\u20131963), Australian rules footballer for South Melbourne", "*Arthur Smith (footballer, born 1908) (1908\u20131987), Australian rules footballer for Footscray and North Melbourne", "*Arthur Smith (Welsh footballer), Welsh footballer", "*Arthur Smith (amateur jockey) in National Hunt Chase Challenge Cup", "*Arthur Smith (cricketer, born 1851) (1851\u20131923), English cricketer for Sussex", "*Arthur Smith (cricketer, born 1853) (1853\u20131936), English cricketer for Middlesex", "*Arthur Smith (cricketer, born 1857) (1857\u20131937), English cricketer for Lancashire and Nottinghamshire", "*Arthur Smith (cricketer, born 1872) (1872\u20131952), English cricketer for Leicestershire", "*Arthur Smith (fencer) (1915\u2013?), British Olympic fencer", "*Arthur Smith (golfer) in 1905 U.S. Open", "*Arthur Smith (rugby), English rugby union and rugby league footballer of the 1900s and 1910s", "*Arthur Smith (rugby league), English rugby league footballer of the 1920s for Warrington", "*Arthur Smith (rugby union) (1933\u20131975), Scottish rugby union footballer", "*Arthur Smith (sport shooter) (1887\u20131958), represented South Africa at the 1912 Summer Olympics", "*Arthur Smith (tennis) in 1930 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Men's Singles", "*Fiddlin' Arthur Smith (1898\u20131971), old-time fiddler and songwriter", "*Arthur Smith (American poet), American poet", "*Arthur Smith (comedian) (born 1954), British comedian and writer", "*Arthur Smith (curator) (1860\u20131941), British museum curator and Director of the British School at Rome", "*Arthur Smith (illustrator) (1916\u20131991), British entomological illustrator", "*Arthur Smith (British Army officer) (1890\u20131977), commanding officer of British Forces in India and Pakistan, 1947\u20131948", "*Arthur Smith (historian) (1850\u20131924), British historian at the University of Oxford", "*Arthur Smith (priest) (1909\u20132001), Archdeacon of Lincoln", "*Arthur Smith (public servant) (1893\u20131971), Australian public servant", "*Arthur Smith (producer) (born 1960), Canadian-born American television producer"]}, {"page": "British Tortricoid Moths", "response": ["British Tortricoid Moths is a two-volume publication by John David Bradley, W.
