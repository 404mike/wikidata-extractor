He also held the British records for 3000 m steeplechase and 5000 metres. He usually ran in distinctive red socks, which combined with his distinctive moustache later led to a well publicised dispute about the use of similarly attired runners in advertisements.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "December 30", "response": ["*1949 \u2013 David Bedford, English runner"]}, {"page": "London Marathon", "response": ["The race is currently organised by Hugh Brasher, son of Chris, as Race Director and Nick Bitel as Chief Executive.

This slogan has fallen into disuse by the marketing department of 118 118 because of the expansion of service beyond directory enquiries alone, but has lived on in the minds of the public. The use of the runners' characters is particularly noted for the legal action threatened, but never acted on, by 1970s record-breaking runner David Bedford. 118 118 responded to this by stating that their inspiration was partly the late American runner Steve Prefontaine.

Writing before those games, he predicted a tragedy, but changed his mind after being there, saying they were amongst the best he had ever seen. He covered the Munich Olympics in 1972, and caused resentment among British runners with a brutish and insensitive attack on David Bedford; it emerged that he had had to take some ribbing from foreign journalists over Bedford's failure in the 10,000 metres. As well as the Olympics, Wooldridge covered Wimbledon tennis championships, heavyweight boxing world title bouts, football World Cups, Open and US Masters golf championships and America's Cups for the paper. His America's Cup reporting opened the sport to a wide audience beyond sailing enthusiasts. He was assisted by PR and friend David Redfern, of whom he said \"with his help, the eyes of Coronation Street as well as the Squadron are on the Cup\", but in reality it was Wooldridge's writing and interest that was the key.
