Jameson is known for his pioneering work in the field of computational fluid dynamics. He has published more than 300 scientific papers (authored or co-authored) in a wide range of areas including computational fluid dynamics, aerodynamics, and control theory.Jameson was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 1997 for contributions to aircraft through the development of computational fluid dynamics. He was awarded the 2005 Elmer A. Sperry Award and received the 2015 AIAA/ASME/SAE/AHS Daniel Guggenheim Medal for lifetime achievement. He is an Honorary Fellow of the AIAA.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Computational fluid dynamics", "response": ["Developers turned to Full Potential codes, as panel methods could not calculate the non-linear flow present at transonic speeds.
