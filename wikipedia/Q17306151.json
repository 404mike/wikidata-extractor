In the semis, Dolan edged world number one Michael van Gerwen 4\u20133, but Mansell lost 4\u20130 to Van Barneveld to send the match into a deciding doubles game in which the Dutch pair averaged an incredible 117.88 to progress with a 4\u20130 whitewash. Dolan won the 16th Players Championship with a 6\u20132 victory over Anderson at the Citywest Hotel in Dublin, the same venue where he reached the final and threw a nine-dart finish in the 2011 World Grand Prix. A day later, Anderson exacted revenge by knocking Dolan out of the first round of the World Grand Prix 2\u20130 in sets. He missed doubles in successive legs at 8\u20137 up against Van Gerwen in the second round of the European Championship and was eliminated 10\u20138.
