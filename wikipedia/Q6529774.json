He made his debut on 7 February 1948 in a 2\u20131 win over Huddersfield, the first of three consecutive starts for the winger. However, these proved his only taste of first team action at Molineux and he moved to Derby County in May 1949.\nHe found playing time equally scare at his new club though and made just 14 appearances in three years. He moved to Third Division Scunthorpe and Lindsey United for the 1952-53 season before dropping into the non-league. He finished his playing career with spells at Worcester City, Halesowen Town, Bromsgrove Rovers and Kidderminster Harriers, respectively.\nHe died on 25 July 2008, aged 82.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Doug Taft", "response": ["He was one of 33 professionals placed on Derby's retained list, but did not remain with the club for long. In July 1949, as part of a deal that took Wolves' Les Mynard to Derby and in the same week as he celebrated his wedding to Norma Allwood, Taft signed for Wolverhampton Wanderers as backup to Jesse Pye. He soon suffered a knee injury that required surgery, which deprived him of a chance to play for the first team when Pye was injured in January. When fit again, Taft was still unable to break into the first team, so he requested a transfer, and was listed at a fee reported as \u00a35,000. There was interest from Second Division clubs, but eventually Taft signed for a Southern League club, Chelmsford City. His season was soon disrupted by injury and the need for a second cartilage operation, but he stayed on for a second season."]}, {"page": "Mynard", "response": ["* Les Mynard (1925\u20132008), English footballer "]}]}}
