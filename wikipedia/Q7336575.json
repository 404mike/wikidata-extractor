She has one surviving sibling, a brother, Alan McCulloch.  \nShe was involved in the Civil Rights campaign and later became a republican. She was editor of the Irish republican newspaper An Phoblacht (\"Republican News\") (AP/RN) in the 1980s and early 1990s. She was also Director of Publicity for Sinn F\u00e9in, succeeding Danny Morrison in that position.\nShe was arrested in Northern Ireland in 1972 for the attempted murder of British Army Warrant Officer Frazer Paton in Belfast in October 1971. She also faces malicious wounding and possession of firearms charges. Upon her release on bail she fled to Dublin in the Republic of Ireland where she lives with her family. She cannot return to the UK due to an outstanding arrest warrant. Sinn F\u00e9in has presented her case to the British Government as one of the IRA 'on the runs' (OTRs) under consideration to be allowed to return to Northern Ireland.She served a three-year sentence in Limerick Prison for smuggling explosives to an IRA member and was released in 1979.Upon her release, her extradition from the Republic of Ireland was blocked as the Irish High Court ruled in March 1978 that O'Hare should not be extradited to Northern Ireland, on the ground that the offences that she was alleged to have committed fell within the political offence exception.Based in Dublin, she was temporarily banned from entering the United States after she traveled to Florida for a meeting (the terms of her special visa require that she first notify authorities before such travel). She is ineligible for a regular visa due to the outstanding warrant.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "An Phoblacht", "response": ["In October 1982 Morrison left the newspaper after being elected to the Northern Assembly for the Mid-Ulster constituency. He was succeeded by Mick Timothy who expanded the newspaper from 12 to 16 pages. Timothy died suddenly in January 1985 and was replaced by Rita O'Hare. The headquarters of An Phoblacht was subsequently named after Timothy. During this period An Phoblacht focused strongly on alleged collusion between the British security forces and loyalist paramilitaries such as the UVF. In response the paper came under attack from the UVF and other Loyalist hit squads.", ":1985: Rita O'Hare"]}]}}
