Equipped with two 6-pounder guns and depth charges. Lorna probably operated as the Group Leader of a unit of the Auxiliary Patrol, both in home waters and in the Mediterranean. On the evening of 26 May 1918, Lorna was escorting a convoy off Portland Bill at the eastern end of Lyme Bay. Sighting a submarine's periscope only thirty yards away, Lorna was able to approach to ten yards before the U-boat spotted her and began to dive. Passing directly over where the periscope had been, (some accounts state that Lorna struck the periscope) Lorna dropped two depth charges resulting in a large patch of turbulence with some debris in it. Returning to recross the area, it was realised that some items in the water were actually four survivors from the U-boat, their calls for help being heard too late to prevent a third charge from being dropped. Three of the men in the water were killed instantly, the fourth was still alive when recovered but died within three hours, although not before revealing that the destroyed submarine had been the SM UB-74. Lorna was returned to her owner in February 1919, she was then sold on to Walter Preston, an engineer and Member of Parliament."]}]}}
