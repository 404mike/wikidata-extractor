He contested the seat as a Liberal-Labour candidate (i.e. an official Liberal candidate with a Trade Union background). Rowlands lost to Conservative businessman James Bigwood in 1885 by 20 votes (when the Liberals secured a national majority of seats). However Rowlands won in 1886 with a majority of 61 (when most nominees of the split Liberal Party fared disastrously at the polls). This was the only seat the Gladstonian Liberals gained in the London metropolitan area in 1886. Pelling suggests that a section of the local Liberals may have abstained in the first election, because of the candidates views and background but were motivated to vote in 1886 due to the importance of the Home Rule issue. Rowlands was re-elected in 1892 by a majority of 290, but was defeated in 1895 when there was a Conservative majority of 270.", "| James Bigwood", "thumb|120px|James Bigwood"]}, {"page": "List of Conservative Party MPs (UK)", "response": ["*James Bigwood; MP for Finsbury East (1885\u20131886) and Brentford (1886\u20131906)"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1885\u20131900)", "response": ["|James Bigwood"]}, {"page": "Star and Garter Hotel, Richmond", "response": ["Dinners continued to be held at the hotel's dining rooms and banqueting hall.
