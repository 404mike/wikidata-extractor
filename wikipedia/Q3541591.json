The award is given for \"the encouragement and promotion of geographical science and discovery\", and are approved by Queen Elizabeth II. The awards originated as an annual gift of fifty guineas from King William IV, first made in 1831, \"to constitute a premium for the encouragement and promotion of geographical science and discovery\". The Society decided in 1839 to change this monetary award into two gold medals: Founder\u2019s Medal and the Patron\u2019s. The award has been given to notable geographers including David Livingstone (1855), Nain Singh Rawat (1876), Baron Ferdinand von Richthofen (1878), Alfred Russel Wallace (1892), and Frederick Courtney Selous (1893) to more recent winners including Percy Harrison Fawcett (1916), Professor William Morris Davis (1919), Sir Halford John Mackinder (1945), Professor L. Dudley Stamp (1949), Professor Richard Chorley (1987) and Professor David Harvey (1995). In 2004 Harish Kapadia was awarded the Patron's Medal for contributions to geographical discovery and mountaineering in the Himalayas, making him the second Indian to receive the award in its history. In 2005 the Founder's Medal was awarded to Professor Sir Nicholas Shackleton for his research in the field of Quaternary Palaeoclimatology and the Patron's Medal was awarded to Professor Jean Malaurie for a lifelong study of the Arctic and its people.

Roots of this work were visible while he was at Cambridge: the Department of Geography also housed Richard Chorley, and Peter Haggett. His Explanation in Geography (1969) was a landmark text in the methodology and philosophy of geography, applying principles drawn from the philosophy of science in general to the field of geographical knowledge. But after its publication Harvey moved on again, to become concerned with issues of social injustice and the nature of the capitalist system itself. He has never returned to embrace the arguments made in Explanation, but still he conforms to the critique of absolute space and exceptionalism in geography of the regional-historical tradition that he saw as an outcome of Kantian synthetic a priori knowledge."]}, {"page": "Ascension Parish Burial Ground", "response": ["* Richard Chorley, Quantitative Geographer, Vice-Master, Sidney Sussex College"]}, {"page": "2002 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["*12 May \u2013 Richard Chorley, geographer (born 1927)"]}, {"page": "Gold Medal (RGS)", "response": ["Recipients include David Livingstone in 1855, Mary Somerville in 1869, Nain Singh Rawat in 1877, Ferdinand von Richthofen in 1878, Alfred Russel Wallace in 1892 and William Woodville Rockhill in 1893, to more recent winners including William Morris Davis in 1919, Sir Halford John Mackinder in 1945, Richard Chorley in 1987 and David Harvey in 1995."]}, {"page": "1927 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 4 September \u2013 Richard Chorley, geographer (died 2002)"]}, {"page": "Department of Geography, University of Cambridge", "response": ["File:Richard Chorley.jpg|Richard Chorley, leading figure in the late 20th century for his work in quantitative geography", "* Richard Chorley"]}, {"page": "David Linton (geographer)", "response": ["The David Linton Award of the British Society for Geomorphology (which incorporates the British Geomorphological Research Group) is given to a geomorphologist who has made a leading contribution to the discipline over a sustained period.
