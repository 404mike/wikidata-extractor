Proclaiming that \"there is now overwhelming biological, anthropological and archaeological evidence that cannibalism was once all around us\", he attacked Arens for his blanket and \"bizarre\" accusations against the concept of cultural anthropophagy. He argued that The Man-Eating Myth had become so influential upon publication because it was what a generation of anthropological and archaeological students wanted to hear, not because it represented a coherent argument, citing P.G. Rivi\u00e8re's negative review in Man. Commenting on the situation in archaeology, he felt that following the publication of Arens' work, archaeologists had ceased to cite cannibalism as an explanation, to the detriment of the discipline itself. Presenting evidence to counter Arens' claims, Taylor cites the accounts of cannibalism among Pom and Passon, two chimpanzees of Gombe National Park whose anti-social activities were recorded by Jane Goodall, and from this discusses the evolutionary benefits of cannibalism. Proceeding to defend various ethnographic accounts of cultural cannibalism, he argues that this thoroughly disproves the beliefs which \"Arensite\" anthropologists find it \"comfortable or fashionable\" to believe.Taylor 2002. pp. 57\u201385. Later in The Buried Soul, he proclaims that Arens' book is pervaded by a \"hollow certainty of viscerally insulated inexperience\", and he claims that such a flawed methodology has echoes in the anthropologist Jean La Fontaine's Speak of the Devil: Tales of Satanic Abuse in Contemporary England (1998); Taylor himself suggests that multiple claims of the Satanic ritual abuse have been incorrectly dismissed for being considered \"improbable\".Taylor 2002. pp. 280\u2013283."]}, {"page": "Enaree", "response": ["The archaeologist Timothy Taylor in his 1996 book The Prehistory of Sex proposed a theory that Enarei drank pregnant mare urine to induce hormonal feminization.

Despite the lack of direct evidence, this idea has gained popularity and has been both cited and passed off as a fact on the Internet."]}, {"page": "Prehistoric religion", "response": ["Burial is one of the major ways archaeologists understand past societies; in the words of Timothy Taylor, \"there can be no clearer a priori demonstration of ritual in past societies than the archaeological uncovery of a formal human burial\". Upper Paleolithic burials do not appear to represent an ordinary cross-section of the population. Rather, their subjects are unusual and extravagant. Three-quarters of Upper Paleolithic burials were of men, a significant proportion young or disabled, and many buried in shared tombs. They are frequently posed in unusual positions and buried with rich grave goods. Taylor supposes many of these dead were human sacrifices, excluded from the ordinary means of body disposal (he presumes cannibalism) and warded by talismans. Hayden rather speculates these were shamans or otherwise people whose religious prominence was in life, rather than death; he notes especially the frequency of physical disability, comparing it to the many shamans in recorded societies who were singled out for physical or psychological differences."]}]}}
