Although his first fiction was published in 1924, his career was slow to take off. His best-known novels are the Eustace and Hilda trilogy (1944\u201347) and The Go-Between (1953). The latter was made into a film in 1971, as was his 1957 novel The Hireling in 1973. He was known for writing about social codes, moral responsibility and family relationships. In total, Hartley published 17 novels, six volumes of short stories and a book of criticism.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Arkham House", "response": ["* The Travelling Grave and Other Stories, by L.

For Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn in his introduction to a 2002 reprint, the book is not really \"a drama about class or about England, or a lost world mourned by Hartley; instead it is a drama about Leo's deeply sensuous nature moving blindly, in a world of rich detail and beautiful sentences, toward a destruction that is impelled by his own intensity of feeling and, despite everything, his own innocence.\"New York Books  Kevin Gardner cites the narrative technique among other complex treatments of time: \"Hartley's haunting tale of lost innocence underscores the modern experience of broken time, a paradox in which humanity is alienated from the past, yet not free from it, a past that continues to exist in and to control the subconscious \u2026 This doubling of consciousness and of narrative voice\u2014the innocent twelve-year-old's emerging from beneath the self-protective sixty-five-year-old's\u2014is one of Hartley's most effective techniques.\"Kevin J.

P. Hartley.Andr\u00e9 Deutsch, 1996 Although Leo is twelve at the time of the novel \u2013 the long, hot summer of 1900 \u2013 the five-year-old Hartley remembered that time afterwards as \"a Golden Age\". When he was about Leo's age in 1909, Hartley spent a summer with a school friend called Moxley at Bradenham Hall in Norfolk and took part in a cricket match.Wright 1996, pp. 7, 30\u20133 The names are sufficiently close to Maudsley and Brandham to give rise to such speculation. But T\u00f3ib\u00edn counsels a cautious approach to the question, quoting Hartley's own study of fiction-writing, The Novelist's Responsibility. The novelist's world, he wrote, \"must, in some degree, be an extension of his own life.\" And, while it is \"unsafe to assume that a novelist's work is autobiographical in any direct sense,\" this does not prevent it from reflecting his experience.", "*Adrian Wright, Foreign Country: The Life of L.
