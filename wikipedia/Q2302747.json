He was then handed a retrospective four-match ban by the FA for an altercation Juan Mata in a 2\u20131 defeat by Chelsea on 10 September 2011. Despite this Bardsley retained his place in the side under Martin O'Neill, playing a total of 37 matches as Sunderland finished in 13th position. He missed the start of the 2012\u201313 campaign after undergoing ankle surgery in August 2012. Bardsley returned to the side at the end of October 2012, with the team struggling near the bottom of the table. Paolo Di Canio replaced O'Neill in March 2013 and he guided the team to back to back victories over Newcastle United and Everton lifting the club away from the relegation zone. Bardsley scored in the penultimate match of the season in a 1\u20131 draw with Southampton on 12 May 2013. Bardsley missed the final match of the season away at Tottenham Hotspur after he and Matthew Kilgallon were pictured visiting a casino, angering Di Canio who vowed never to play the pair again.

Richardson was then replaced on the right of midfield by John Oster. However, an injury to Stephen Crainey meant Richardson was given a chance to establish himself at left full-back.

He did play the full 90 minutes of their memorable 1\u20130 win over AC Milan at Elland Road during that campaign; however, this would prove to be his last appearance of that season in any competition. He was involved in a court case with Leeds teammates Jonathan Woodgate and Lee Bowyer. The first season in which he played regularly for Leeds was 2003\u201304, as by this time Lucas Radebe had become increasingly injury-prone and crippling debt had forced the sales of Ferdinand and Woodgate.

However, Marques instead chose to move to Leeds United on a free transfer. He was signed by manager Kevin Blackwell, but Marques made only one appearance for Leeds in the 2005\u201306 season in the League Cup against Oldham Athletic, in which he was clearly very nervous and uncomfortable playing out of position at right-back. Marques did not feature again for Leeds that season, with Paul Butler, Sean Gregan, Matthew Kilgallon, Clarke Carlisle and Michael Duberry all ahead of him in the pecking order. Towards the end of the 2005\u201306 season, he joined Hull City on a short-term loan, though his loan was cut short due to injury. He then returned to Leeds.

He returned to action on 14 January away to Chelsea, replacing Matthew Kilgallon who had himself suffered an injury, as Sunderland lost 1\u20130. He started for the Black Cats in their back to back wins against Norwich and Stoke, helping keep clean sheets in the process.

His return came on 28 December 2004, when he was brought on as an 80th-minute substitute for Frazer Richardson in the 2\u20131 win against Plymouth Argyle. He started the next league match, against Coventry City, but was shown a red card late on in the 2\u20131 victory at Highfield Road. After his return from suspension, he was dropped from the team, making just a handful of substitute appearances in the following two months. Carlisle regained his place in the team towards the end of the season, starting in each of the final four matches of the campaign. He left Leeds in the summer of 2005, having spent one season at the club, playing 38 matches and scoring four times for the team as they reached the third round of the League Cup and attained a 14th-placed finish in the league. At the end of the 2004\u201305 campaign it was revealed that two clubs, Watford and Stoke City, were both competing to sign Carlisle.
