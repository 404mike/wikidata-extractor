(November 3, 2007) Quote: \"One day, Dave Fleischer handed Grim a photograph of singer, Helen Kane and asked him to design a caricature. Fleischer had found a sound-alike, and planned to use her in the upcoming Talkartoon, \"Dizzy Dishes\". Grim exaggerated Kane\u2019s wide eyes and rosebud mouth, creating a slightly coarse, but strikingly original design. A few weeks later, Dave asked Grim to design a girlfriend for Bimbo to star as the \"fair young maiden\" in a cartoon adaptation of the popular song, 'Barnacle Bill the Sailor'. Grim streamlined and refined his caricature of Kane for the part. But Dave Fleischer objected, insisting that since Bimbo was a dog, his girlfriend should also be a dog. Grim quickly sketched Betty Boop\u2019s head on a four-legged canine body. He held up the drawing next to the pretty girl design, and asked, 'Which would you rather have as your girlfriend? A girl? Or a dog?' Dave laughed and agreed that the pretty girl was the right choice.\" Clara Bow is often given credit as being the inspiration for Boop,See, for instance, the passing mention in McGuire, Carolyn. \"Will Betty Boop Be A Big Hit as 'It?'\" Chicago Tribune (March 20, 1985), a blurb for a television program though Fleischer told his artists that he wanted a caricature of singer Helen Kane, who performed in a style shared by many performers of the day - Kane was also the one that sued Fleischer over the signature \"Boop Oop a Doop\" line.Supreme Court Appellate Division- First Department.

While much credit has been given to Grim Natwick for helping to transform Max Fleischer's creation, her transition into the cute cartoon girl was also in part due to the work of Berny Wolf, Otto Feuer, Seymour Kneitel, \"Doc\" Crandall, Willard Bowsky, and James \"Shamus\" Culhane. By the release of Any Rags, Betty Boop was forever established as a human character. Her floppy poodle ears became hoop earrings, and her black poodle nose became a girl's button-like nose.", "Betty was first voiced by Margie Hines. Later, several different voice actresses performed the role, including Kate Wright, Bonnie Poe, Ann Rothschild (also known as Little Ann Little), and especially Mae Questel, who began voicing Betty Boop in Bimbo's Silly Scandals (1931), and continued with the role until 1938, returning 50 years later in Disney's Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988). Today, Betty is voiced by Sandy Fox and Cindy Robinson.", "Although Betty's first name was assumed to have been established in the 1931 Screen Songs cartoon Betty Co-ed, this \"Betty\" is a different character, which the official Betty Boop website describes as a \"prototype\" of Betty Boop. At least 12 Screen Songs cartoons featured Betty Boop or a similar character.", "Betty Boop was the star of the Talkartoons by 1932 and was given her own series that same year, beginning with Stopping the Show. From that point on, she was crowned \"The Queen of the Animated Screen\". The series was popular throughout the 1930s, lasting until 1939.", "The Betty Boop films were revived after Paramount sold them for syndication in 1955. UM&M and National Telefilm Associates were required to remove the original Paramount logo from the opening and closing, as well as any references to Paramount in the copyright line on the main titles. However, the mountain motif remains on some television prints, usually with a UM&M copyright line, while recent versions have circulated with the Paramount-Publix reference in cartoons from 1931.", "The original Betty Boop cartoons were made in black and white. As new color cartoons made specifically for television began to appear in the 1960s, the original black-and-white cartoons were retired. Boop's film career had a revival with the release of The Betty Boop Scandals of 1974, becoming a part of the post-1960s counterculture. NTA attempted to capitalize on this with a new syndication package, but because no market existed for cartoons in black and white, they sent them to South Korea, where the cartoons were hand-traced frame-by-frame in color, resulting in the degradation of the animation quality and timing. Unable to sell these to television largely because of the sloppy colorization, they assembled a number of the color cartoons in a compilation feature titled Betty Boop for President, to connect with the 1976 election, but it did not receive a theatrical release.", "The release of the films on video cassette for home viewing created a new market for the films in their original form. The American Movie Classics cable television channel showcased a selection of the original black-and-white Betty Boop cartoons in the 1990s, which led to an eight-volume VHS and LV set, Betty Boop, the Definitive Collection.

The script by Rees detailed Betty's rise in Hollywood in the Golden Age of Hollywood. It was to be a musical with music by jazz musician Bennie Wallace and lyrics by Cheryl Ernst Wells. Wallace and Wells had completed several songs and 75% of the film had been storyboarded when, two weeks before voice recording was to begin with Bernadette Peters as Betty, the head of MGM, Alan Ladd Jr., was replaced by Frank Mancuso, and the project was abandoned.", "According to Playbill in 2012, a musical based on Betty Boop was \"in the works\", with music by David Foster and book by Oscar Williams and Sally Robinson. No dates, theatre, or cast were listed.\"Schedule of Upcoming Broadway Show: In the Works\" on Playbill.com. Accessed: June 19, 2012", "Betty Boop is regarded as one of the first and best-known sex symbols on the animated screen; she is a symbol of the Depression era, and a reminder of the more carefree days of Jazz Age flappers. Her popularity was drawn largely from adult audiences, and the cartoons, while seemingly surreal, contained many sexual and psychological elements, particularly in the 1932 \"Talkartoon\" Minnie the Moocher (1932), featuring Cab Calloway and his orchestra.", "Minnie the Moocher defined Betty's character as a teenager of a modern era, at odds with the old-world ways of her parents. In the cartoon, after a disagreement with her strict parents, Betty runs away from home, accompanied by her boyfriend Bimbo, only to get lost in a haunted cave. A ghostly walrus (rotoscoped from live-action footage of Calloway) sings Calloway's song \"Minnie the Moocher\", accompanied by several other ghosts and skeletons. This haunting performance sends the frightened Betty and Bimbo back to the safety of home. \"Minnie the Moocher\" served as a promotion for Calloway's subsequent stage appearances and also established Betty Boop as a cartoon star. The eight Talkartoons that followed all starred Betty, leading her into her own series beginning in 1932. With the release of Stopping the Show (August 1932), the Talkartoons were replaced by the Betty Boop series, which continued for the next seven years.", "Betty Boop was unique among female cartoon characters because she represented a sexual woman. Other female cartoon characters of the same period, such as Minnie Mouse, displayed their underwear or bloomers regularly, in the style of childish or comical characters, not a fully defined woman's form. Many other female cartoons were merely clones of their male co-stars, with alterations in costume, the addition of eyelashes, and a female voice. Betty Boop wore short dresses, high heels, a garter, and her breasts were highlighted with a low, contoured bodice that showed cleavage. In her cartoons, male characters frequently try to sneak a peek at her while she is changing or simply going about her business. In Betty Boop's Bamboo Isle, she does the hula wearing nothing but a lei, strategically placed to cover her breasts, and a grass skirt. This was repeated in her first cameo appearance in Popeye the Sailor (1933). A certain girlish quality was given to the character. She was drawn with a head more similar to a baby's than an adult's in proportion to her body. This suggested the combination of girlishness and maturity that many people saw in the flapper type, which Betty represented.", "Attempts to compromise her virginity were reflected in Chess-Nuts (1932) and most importantly in Boop-Oop-a-Doop (1932). In Chess-Nuts, the Black King goes into the house where Betty is and ties her up. When she rejects him, he pulls her out of the ropes, drags her off to the bedroom and says, \"I will have you\". The bed, however, runs away and Betty calls for help through the window. Bimbo comes to her rescue, and she is saved before anything happens. In Boop-Oop-a-Doop, Betty is a high-wire performer in a circus. The ringmaster lusts for Betty as he watches her from below, singing \"Do Something\", a song previously performed by Helen Kane. As Betty returns to her tent, the ringmaster follows her inside and sensually massages her legs, surrounds her, and threatens her job if she does not submit. Betty pleads with the ringmaster to cease his advances, as she sings \"Don't Take My Boop-Oop-A-Doop Away\". Koko the Clown is practicing his juggling outside the tent and overhears the struggle inside. He leaps in to save Betty, struggling with the ringmaster, who loads him into a cannon and fires it. Koko, who remained hiding inside the cannon, knocks the ringmaster out cold with a mallet, while imitating the ringmaster's laugh. Koko then inquires about Betty's welfare, to which she answers in song, \"No, he couldn't take my boop-oop-a-doop away\". According to Jill Harness of Mental Floss, these portrayals of Boop fighting off sexual harassment on the animated screen made many see her as a feminist icon.Harness, Jill. \"Happy Belated Birthday, Betty Boop!\". mental floss. Retrieved July 21, 2015.", "Betty Boop's best appearances are considered to be in her first three years due to her \"Jazz Baby\" character and innocent sexuality, which was aimed at adults, but the content of her films was affected by the National Legion of Decency and the Production Code of 1934, which imposed guidelines on the motion-picture industry and placed specific restrictions on the content films could reference with sexual innuendos. This greatly affected the Betty Boop cartoons.", "No longer a carefree flapper from the date the code went into effect on July 1, 1934, Betty became a spinster housewife or a career girl who wore a fuller dress or skirt. Additionally, as time progressed, the curls in her hair gradually decreased in number. She also eventually stopped wearing her gold bracelets and hoop earrings, and she became more mature and wiser in personality, compared to her earlier years. Right from the start, Joseph Breen, the new head film censor, had numerous complaints. Breen ordered the removal of the suggestive introduction that had started the cartoons because Betty Boop's winks and shaking hips were deemed \"suggestive of immorality\". For a few entries, Betty was given a new human boyfriend named Freddy, who was introduced in She Wronged Him Right (1934). Next, Betty was teamed with a puppy named Pudgy, beginning with Betty Boop's Little Pal (1934). The following year saw the addition of the eccentric inventor Grampy, who debuted in Betty Boop and Grampy (1935).", "Since she was largely a musical novelty character, the animators attempted to keep Betty's cartoons interesting by pairing her with popular comic strip characters such as Henry, The Little King and Little Jimmy, hoping to create an additional spin-off series with her pairing with Popeye in 1933. None of these films, though, generated a new series. When the flapper/jazz era that Betty represented had been replaced by the big bands of the swing era, Fleischer Studios made an attempt to develop a replacement character in this style in the 1938 Betty Boop cartoon Betty Boop and Sally Swing, but it was not a success.", "The last Betty Boop cartoons were released in 1939, and a few made attempts to bring Betty into the swing era. In her last appearance, Rhythm on the Reservation (1939), Betty drives an open convertible, labeled \"Betty Boop's Swing Band\", through a Native American reservation, where she introduces the people to swing music and creates a \"Swinging Sioux Band\". The Betty Boop cartoon series officially ended with Yip Yip Yippy (1939). While Yip Yip Yippy appears at the end of the Betty Boop series, it is actually a one-shot about a \"Drug Store\" mail-order cowboy \"wannabe\" without Betty, which was written mainly to fill the release schedule and fulfill the contract.Pointer (2017), p. 111", "Betty Boop appeared in two television specials, The Romance of Betty Boop in 1985, which was produced by Lee Mendelson and Bill Melendez, the same creative team behind the Peanuts specials; and 1989's The Betty Boop Movie Mystery and both specials are available on DVD as part of the Advantage Cartoon Mega Pack.

While Kane had risen to fame in the late 1920s as \"The Boop-Oop-a-Doop Girl\", a star of stage, recordings, and films for Paramount, her career was nearing its end by 1931. Paramount promoted the development of Betty Boop following Kane's decline. The case was brought in New York in 1934.

The 1980s rapper Betty Boo (whose voice, image, and name were influenced by the cartoon character) rose to popularity in the UK largely due to the \"Betty Boop\" revival.

They come in expecting to work, and there's a trust there which, I think, dates back to that day.\"", "\"All I Need (All I Don't)\" was described as \"a Kylie-type tune set to squelchy techno\", as well as \"a disco-funk workout with traces of Cameo and Bedtime Stories vintage Madonna\". \"Life Got Cold\", the album's first ballad and third single, was a late addition to the album, completed by Xenomania shortly before the album's release. The song received attention because of similarities between the guitar riff of \"Life Got Cold\" and that of the Oasis hit \"Wonderwall\" (1995). Warner/Chappell Music has since credited Oasis songwriter Noel Gallagher. The song was called a \"charming ballad\" that was \"a sweet but slightly sad pop song\". The song begins with a rap. \"Mars Attack\", produced by Betty Boo and the Beatmasters, \"is hip hop-referencing surf punk.\"", "\"Stop\", a Xenomania production sung entirely by Nadine Coyle apart from the chorus, \"starts like the Skids' \"Into the Valley\" but gets sultry instead of surreal.\" The album's eighth track, \"Girls Allowed\", was co-written by Westlife member Brian McFadden. It was described as both \"Basement Jaxx meets Spice Girls\" and \"Donna Summer meets Dannii Minogue\". \"Forever and a Night\" was described as \"a soppy love song earmarked as a Christmas single\", but slated for sounding like \"every girl-group slushy song ever written.\" \"Love/Hate\", another song crafted by Xenomania, \"lays vocals over garage beats.\" A second contribution from Betty Boo and the Beatmasters, \"Boogie Down Love\", follows. It was said that it \"mixes the hook of Blondie's \"Call Me\" with the bells from \"Rapture\"\", as well as being deemed \"electro stomping\". \"Don't Want You Back\" was co-written by Anders Bagge, who also wrote Samantha Mumba's \"Gotta Tell You\", which bears similarities. It was labelled as \"love song\" in which Girls Aloud are \"swooning over bois [sic]\". \"White Lies\" was co-written and produced by Tim Kellett, a former member of The Durutti Column, Simply Red, and Olive.", "The original UK edition of the album featured two bonus tracks. \"Love Bomb\", another Betty Boo collaboration, was compared to Boo's \"Where Are You Baby?\". \"Everything You Ever Wanted\" borrows its opening line from The Rolling Stones. In December 2003, the album was re-released with the omission of \"Don't Want You Back\" and the bonus tracks. Three new songs appeared instead. \"Jump\", a cover of song \"Jump (for My Love)\" by The Pointer Sisters, was recorded for the soundtrack to Love Actually (2003). Cheryl Cole noted in Girls Aloud's autobiography Dreams That Glitter \u2013 Our Story (2008) that the single \"was the point when we realized everything we'd been doing was quite down and moody [...] and that's not what people wanted.\" \"You Freak Me Out\" is a pop-rock song that was written and recorded specifically for the Disney film Freaky Friday (2003), Also included was Girls Aloud's cover of \"Girls on Film\", originally a Duran Duran classic, that originally appeared as a B-side to \"Life Got Cold\"."]}, {"page": "List of number-one singles in Australia during the 1990s", "response": ["Songs which peaked at number three were \"Crying in the Chapel\" by Peter Blakeley, \"Black Velvet\" by Alannah Myles, \"Girl I'm Gonna Miss You\" by Milli Vanilli, \"How Can We Be Lovers?\" by Michael Bolton, \"Mona\" by Craig McLachlan & Check 1\u20132, \"I Need Your Body\" by Tina Arena, \"Doin' the Do\" by Betty Boo, and \"Show Me Heaven\" by Maria McKee."]}, {"page": "Reparata and the Delrons", "response": ["\"Captain of Your Ship\" was adapted for a 1990 UK TV commercial for M\u00fcllerice, and the same year it was sampled by Betty Boo on her single \"Doin' the Do\"."]}, {"page": "Magic Pockets", "response": ["Magic Pockets is a platform game developed by the Bitmap Brothers and published by Renegade in October 1991.
