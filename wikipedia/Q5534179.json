Humpage played in county cricket as a hard-hitting middle-order batsman and wicketkeeper for Warwickshire from 1974 to 1990.\nAs of 2021, he still holds the Warwickshire batting record for the fourth wicket: a stand of 470 with Alvin Kallicharran against Lancashire at Southport in 1982, of which Humpage contributed 254, match Warwickshire lost by ten wickets. He went on the rebel tour to South Africa in 1981\u201382, which effectively ended his international career after just three ODIs, despite it having no similar effect on the international careers of other rebel tourists including Gooch, Emburey and Willey.
