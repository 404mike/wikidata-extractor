And the season after, an even greater triumph: Arsenal's first League and FA Cup double, and a new champions of England record. This marked a premature high point of the decade; the Double-winning side was soon broken up and the rest of the decade was characterised by a series of near misses, starting with Arsenal finishing as FA Cup runners up in 1972, and First Division runners-up in 1972\u201373."]}, {"page": "July 20", "response": ["*  1943   \u2013 Bob McNab, English footballer"]}, {"page": "List of sports announcers", "response": ["* Bob McNab \u2013 ITV Sport 1970"]}, {"page": "Barnet F.C.", "response": ["In 1975, Barnet were relegated back to the Southern League Division One North, after one season they switched to the Southern League Division One South which they won at the first attempt and returned to the Southern League Premier.

Despite being a full-back he was sometimes given the job of marking a dangerous and creative opposition player closely, and though he was never ordered to use rough play he was on these occasions told \"you know what to do, Peter\". He was sent off for the first time in his career, along with Frank McLintock, in a 1\u20130 defeat to Burnley at Turf Moor in December 1967; despite his tough tackling he was actually dismissed for bad language. Arsenal finished the season in ninth place, but advanced past Coventry City, Reading, Blackburn Rovers, Burnley and Huddersfield Town to face Leeds United in the final of the League Cup at Wembley. Leeds won the game through a Terry Cooper volley on 20 minutes, and Arsenal barely created any chances in the game.", "Storey made his England debut under Alf Ramsey on 21 April 1971, in a 3\u20130 win over Greece at Wembley in a qualifying game for UEFA Euro 1972. Despite at the time being used as a midfielder at club level he played at right-back as Ramsey wanted to assess his options at the full-back position; his rivals for the number 2 shirt were Keith Newton (Everton), Emlyn Hughes (Liverpool), Paul Reaney (Leeds United), Chris Lawler (Liverpool), and Paul Madeley (Leeds United). He almost did not play the game as Arsenal manager Bertie Mee ordered both Storey and teammate Bob McNab to pull out of the fixture to play a league game against Burnley the day before, but was allowed to play for England after coach Don Howe persuaded Mee to reconsider his decision. Storey picked up an assist in the match after providing the cross for Francis Lee's late header. His second cap came in a 1\u20130 British Home Championship win over Northern Ireland at Windsor Park, in which he played in midfield and man-marked George Best.", "Storey began his career as a right-back, and soon picked up a reputation as a powerful tackler. Later in his career he was deployed as a defensive midfielder so as to break up opposition play further up the pitch. He gained a reputation as Arsenal's \"hard man\" in a violent era of British football where clubs would typically employ at least one tough player willing to use dirty play to hurt the opposition and to protect their own generally more skilled players. He later said that he made premeditated tackles from behind early in matches to try and intimidate opponents at a time when referees were reluctant to punish fouls. His rough play was frequently criticised by pundits, though during the 1970s the footballing authorities took little action to try and punish him or any other of football's \"hard men\". Teammate Bob McNab, quoted in Seventy-One Guns wrote that \"Peter was a nightmare for players when he marked them man for man\". He was also an efficient taker of penalty kicks, and the only penalties he missed had little bearing on the final result of the match."]}, {"page": "List of Arsenal F.C. players", "response": ["|   Bob McNab"]}, {"page": "Sammy Nelson", "response": ["He was a regular in Arsenal's reserve side for several seasons, before making his first-team debut against Ipswich Town on 25 October 1969.

He made two appearances in Arsenal's successful 1969\u201370 Fairs Cup campaign but played no part in the final itself, and his four league matches during the 1970\u201371 Double-winning season were not sufficient for a medal.
