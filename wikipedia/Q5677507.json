After Beech's conviction in July 2019, Lady Brittan said: \u201cIt is too late for Tom Watson to apologise but his attempt to distance himself from the false allegations of Carl Beech in the wake of the guilty verdict is disingenuous and untruthful\". Harvey Proctor said \"The Metropolitan Police were lapdogs to Mr Watson's crude dog whistle. It's time for the torchlight to take a closer look at Mr Watson. It is now beyond doubt that all of these allegations could never have been true and only someone with spectacular bad judgement could think that they might be. It is time for an apology from him to me...\" Proctor added, \"He denies it now, but he was the cheerleader in chief for Mr Beech. He was in the team. Tom Watson scared the Metropolitan Police to death over phone hacking. He intended to do the same for historic child sexual abuse. Not because Tom Watson has got any interest in historic child sexual abuse. Tom Watson has got a great interest in himself, and in grandstanding, just as he is doing currently on his so-called anti-Semitism campaign.\" Proctor later asked the Labour Party to suspend Watson and to investigate his behaviour on the grounds of breaching the party's membership code and bringing it into disrepute. Lord Bramall's son also demanded an apology. One of the daughters of the late Greville Janner, who was also accused by Beech, Rabbi Janner-Klausner, said \"We have a system where people are believed instantly before the evidence is examined instead of being listened to compassionately and the allegations properly investigated. People were able to accuse (my father) without a shred of evidence and were believed straight away.\" Daniel Janner QC, his son, said \"Tom Watson should resign. He appointed himself Britain\u2019s chief paedo-finder general and created a moral panic. His motive was personal political advancement riding on a bandwagon of public frenzy which he had whipped up. He should hang his head in shame. For him to take the moral high ground in the Labour Party against antisemitism is completely hypocritical.\"", "In October 2019, details of the Henriques report emerged. The report said, of Watson, \"His interest, however, in both Operation Midland and Operation Vincente created further pressure upon MPS officers.\u201d; specifically, \u201cA possible inference is that the officers, then responsible, were in a state of panic induced by Mr Watson\u2019s letter.\u201d It adds that Watson described Lord Brittan as being as \u201cclose to evil as any human being could be\u201d, saying he \u201cgrossly insulted\u201d the former home secretary. Harvey Proctor said: \u201cThe problem was that the police assigned to interview Beech lacked common sense and yielded to intense pressure from Tom Watson, an irresponsible politician out for his own publicity in order to galvanise his advancement to become deputy leader of the Labour party.\u201d Lady Brittan said \u201cThe extent of Tom Watson\u2019s involvement in the witch-hunt of innocent people has been laid bare. His subsequent attempts to distance himself show a complete lack of integrity. By misusing his public office to recklessly repeat false allegations, and to characterise himself as a victim, he has shown that he is unfit to hold the office of MP.\u201d", "The same month, former Labour and Respect MP George Galloway and former Conservative MP Harvey Proctor announced individually that they planned to stand against Watson at the next general election, Galloway as a pro-Brexit pro-Corbyn independent, and Proctor in protest at Watson's role in the false paedophilia allegations of Operation Midland. July also saw Watson be the subject of a complaint to the Labour Party for making allegedly antisemitic remarks; he had in his Easter message asked readers to recall the arrest of Christ by \"a squad of Roman soldiers under the direction of a servant to the High Priest.\" The complainant, Geoffrey Alderman, said that the fact this was not antisemitic under the IHRA definition adopted by the Labour Party highlighted the definition's \"flaws\". This was also the month in which cartoonist Steve Bell protested to The Guardian after it refused to run an installment of his long running 'If...' cartoon strip, which portrayed Watson as an \"antisemite finder general\"."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1983 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Harvey Proctor"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1979 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Harvey Proctor"]}, {"page": "List of fashion designers", "response": ["* Harvey Proctor"]}, {"page": "Panorama (British TV programme)", "response": ["In January 1984, Panorama broadcast an episode which claimed that three Conservative MPs (Neil Hamilton, Harvey Proctor and Gerald Howarth) had links to far-right organisations both in Britain and on the Continent.Charles Moore, Margaret Thatcher, Volume Two: Everything She Wants (London: Allen Lane, 2015), p. 532."]}, {"page": "BBC controversies", "response": ["In January 1984 the BBC programme Panorama broadcast \"Maggie's Militant Tendency\" which claimed that a number of Conservative MPs including (Neil Hamilton, Harvey Proctor and Gerald Howarth) had links to far-right organisations both in Britain and on the Continent.Charles Moore, Margaret Thatcher, Volume Two: Everything She Wants (London: Allen Lane, 2015), p. 532."]}, {"page": "Basildon (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Harvey Proctor"]}, {"page": "Billericay (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["Billericay has elected somewhat colourful characters to Westminster, namely Harvey Proctor, the right-wing MP who resigned after homosexual sex charges, and Teresa Gorman, the Maastricht rebel who stood down after accusing the Commons Standards and Privileges committee of sexism over questions surrounding her registered business dealings.", "| Harvey Proctor"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom MPs: P", "response": ["*Harvey Proctor"]}, {"page": "Radio 270", "response": ["The pirate stations campaigned against the Act during the early months of 1967.
