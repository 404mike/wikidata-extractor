Educated at Eton and Balliol College, Oxford, where he earned a high reputation as a classicist, Knox was ordained as a priest of the Church of England in 1912.  He was a fellow and chaplain of Trinity College, Oxford until he resigned from those positions following his conversion to Roman Catholicism in 1917.  Knox became a Catholic priest in 1918, continuing in that capacity his scholarly and literary work.\nKnox served as Catholic chaplain at the University of Oxford from 1926 to 1939.  He completed the \"Knox Bible\", a new English translation of the Latin Vulgate Bible that was used in Catholic services during the 1960s and 1970s.  In 1951, Pope Pius XII appointed Knox protonotary apostolic ad instar, which entitled Knox to the honorific \"monsignor\".\nKnox published extensively on religious, philosophical, and literary subjects.  He also produced several popular works of detective fiction.  He is remembered for his \"Ten Commandments\" for detective stories, which sought to codify a form of crime fiction in which the reader may participate by attempting to find a solution to the mystery before the fictional detective reveals it.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Agatha Christie", "response": ["Gillian Gill notes that the murder method in Christie's first detective novel, The Mysterious Affair at Styles, \"comes right out of Agatha Christie's work in the hospital dispensary\". In an interview with journalist Marcelle Bernstein, Christie stated, \"I don't like messy deaths... I'm more interested in peaceful people who die in their own beds and no one knows why.\" With her expert knowledge, Christie had no need of poisons unknown to science, which were forbidden under Ronald Knox's \"Ten Rules for Detective Fiction\". Arsenic, aconite, strychnine, digitalis, thallium, and other substances were used to dispatch victims in the ensuing decades."]}, {"page": "Apollos", "response": ["Paul's Epistle refers to a schism between four parties in the Corinthian church, of which two attached themselves to Paul and Apollos respectively, using their names (the third and fourth were Peter, identified as Cephas, and Jesus Christ himself). It is possible, though, that, as Msgr. Ronald Knox suggests, the parties were actually two, one claiming to follow Paul, the other claiming to follow Apollos. \"It is surely probable that the adherents of St. Paul [...] alleged in defence of his orthodoxy the fact that he was in full agreement with, and in some sense commissioned by, the Apostolic College. Hence 'I am for Cephas'. [...] What reply was the faction of Apollos to make? It devised an expedient which has been imitated by sectaries more than once in later times; appealed behind the Apostolic College itself to him from whom the Apostolic College derived its dignity; 'I am for Christ'.\"Knox, R. Enthusiasm, p. 13. Paul states that the schism arose because of the Corinthians' immaturity in faith."]}, {"page": "Beachcomber (pen name)", "response": ["\"By the Way\" was popular with the readership, and of course, this is one of the reasons it lasted so long. Its style and randomness could be off-putting, however, and it is safe to say the humour could be something of an acquired taste.  Oddly, one of the column's greatest opponents was the Express newspaper's owner, Lord Beaverbrook, who had to keep being assured the column was indeed funny. A prominent critic was George Orwell, who frequently referred to him in his essays and diaries as \"A Catholic Apologist\" and accused him of being \"silly-clever\", in line with his criticisms of G.

One of his rules was to avoid supernatural elements so that the focus remained on the mystery itself. Knox has contended that a detective story \"must have as its main interest the unravelling of a mystery; a mystery whose elements are clearly presented to the reader at an early stage in the proceedings, and whose nature is such as to arouse curiosity, a curiosity which is gratified at the end.\" Another common convention in Golden Age detective stories involved an outsider\u2013sometimes a salaried investigator or a police officer, but often a gifted amateur\u2014investigating a murder committed in a closed environment by one of a limited number of suspects.", "According to \"Twenty Rules for Writing Detective Stories,\" by Van Dine in 1928: \"The detective story is a kind of intellectual game. It is more\u2014it is a sporting event. And for the writing of detective stories there are very definite laws\u2014unwritten, perhaps, but nonetheless binding; and every respectable and self-respecting concocter of literary mysteries lives up to them. Herewith, then, is a sort of credo, based partly on the practice of all the great writers of detective stories, and partly on the promptings of the honest author's inner conscience.\" Ronald Knox wrote a set of Ten Commandments or Decalogue in 1929, see article on the Golden Age of Detective Fiction."]}, {"page": "G.
