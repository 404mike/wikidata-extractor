Early jazz influences began with the use of the saxophone by musicians like Samir Suroor, in the \"oriental\" style. The use of the saxophone in that manner can be found in Abdel Halim Hafez's songs, as well as Kadim Al Sahir and Rida Al Abdallah today. The first mainstream jazz elements were incorporated into Arabic music by the Rahbani brothers. Fairuz's later work was almost exclusively made up of jazz songs, composed by her son Ziad Rahbani. Ziad Rahbani also pioneered today's oriental jazz movement, to which singers including Rima Khcheich, Salma El Mosfi, and (on occasion) Latifa adhere. We can also find a lot of jazz music in Mohamed Mounir's songs starting from his first album Alemony Eneeki in 1977, and he is considered to be the King of Arabic Jazz and Arabic Music generally. Another notable performer of this genre is the Palestinian singer Reem Kelani who blends jazz with Arabic music, both in her own compositions and in her arrangements of traditional songs."]}, {"page": "Edward II (band)", "response": ["The Manchester-born Palestinian singer, Reem Kelani, was commissioned by the Manchester International Festival in 2007 to write a 30-minute composition and to orchestrate and lead its performance by the Beating Wing Orchestra, an assembly of local migrant musicians. Her \"Paradise in Strangers\" encompassed melodic modes and rhythmic patterns from the wide diversity of origins of the orchestra members.  In the concluding movement, Kelani opened with the \"Soldier\u2019s Farewell to Manchester\" (1859), and the composition closed with a resounding chorus from the whole cast of \"Manchester\u2019s Improving Daily\"(1830).
