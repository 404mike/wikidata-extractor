The primary setting begins as Shingai Shoniwa exits a factory/warehouse type building (Alexandra Palace, North London) via blue doors. She sips a drink from a bottle, puts the bottle down and pulls on a gold bass-guitar over her shoulder. The camera pans down to her silver Dr. Martens boots, which feature in the song lyrics. After singing the first few lines of the song, her attention shifts to a blue convertible car, a Chesil Speedster (a replica of a classic Porsche 356), which she then walks over to, climbing into the passenger seat. After sitting there, as if almost pondering on past memories, she takes off her silver boots, and places them on the back seat of the car. After walking barefoot back into the building, almost closing the door, she peeks through the gap to see an anonymous male get into the vehicle and drive off with the boots still in the back. While this scene plays out, which primarily relates to the lyrics of the song, the camera frequently cuts to The Noisettes, complete with orchestral accompaniments and backing singers, practicing in what appears to be a derelict theatre (old smoke damaged theatre at Alexandra Palace), lit with a soft red light. Shoniwa is dressed in a kitsch, white tasseled dress, dancing barefoot (from removing the boots previously). Towards the end of the video, the camera begins to frequently cut to the circle balcony above the rehearsal space, where Shoniwa can be seen again, this time dressed in black, singing out over the balcony. As the music ends, the final shot shows a silhouette of Shoniwa in front of a giant red orb, as the camera pans out slightly and fades to black.", "The single was chosen as of one of USA Today's \"Picks of the Week\" for 14 July 2009 with the following comment, \"the Brit pop trio's bubbly soul ditty is, thanks to Shingai Shoniwa's sweet crooning, reminiscent of an early Motown party groove.\"Jones, Steve (14 July 2009), \"Pick of the week\".
