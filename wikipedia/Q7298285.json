He resigned in 1964 in order to join the Diplomatic Service and served from 1966 to 1968 as first secretary at the British embassy in Peking during the Cultural Revolution. He also served as deputy High Commissioner to Bangladesh between 1973 and 1976, and, in his final appointment, was head of the Information Research Department, the Foreign Office's counter-propaganda department.Whitney was elected as (MP) for Wycombe at a by-election in 1978 caused by the death of Sir John Hall. He served as parliamentary private secretary (PPS) to Nigel Lawson and Peter Rees at the Treasury. After the 1983 general election he was appointed Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Foreign Office, moving to occupy the same position at the Department of Health and Social Security from October 1984 to September 1986.Whitney stepped down at the 2001 general election, and was succeeded by Paul Goodman.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Michael Heseltine", "response": ["With a general election looming, Heseltine was keen to associate Labour with CND, and CND with communists and the Soviet Union (ignoring earlier comments by Party Chairman Cecil Parkinson that this was \"manifest nonsense\" \u2013 the media did not pick up on this). He made such a claim in a speech at Exeter in April 1983, and distributed to Tory candidates information about the background of leading members of CND. This had been assembled by Ray Whitney MP, but some of it was suspected of having come from intelligence sources. MI5 agent Cathy Massiter later wrote, in 1985 in The Observer, that from 1981 onwards and especially from 1983 she had been asked to pass on to DS19 (the propaganda unit at the Ministry of Defence) information obtained by wiretaps and by an MI5 mole in CID. MI5 bosses refused to pass on classified material about security matters but agreed to pass on information about the political links of CND members. Even this was in breach of the 1952 Directive from Home Secretary David Maxwell-Fyfe that the security services not provide information for party political purposes. Heseltine allowed his deputy Peter Blaker to debate with CND, but refused to do so himself, believing that he would be at a disadvantage against the attractive Joan Ruddock. Blaker did much of the work while Heseltine got the publicity. DS19 was wound up three months after the 1983 election, at which Heseltine was widely credited with helping the Conservatives achieve a landslide victory.Crick 1997, pp. 247\u201350."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 2001 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Sir Ray Whitney"]}, {"page": "SOAS University of London", "response": ["Around the world, several national leaders and political figures are alumni: Aung San Suu Kyi, Nobel Peace Prize laureate and First and incumbent State Counsellor of Myanmar, Zairil Khir Johari, Member of the Malaysian Parliament, Amal Pepple, Minister of Lands, Housing and Urban Development in Nigeria, Aaron Mike Oquaye, Speaker of Parliament and former Minister of Communication in Ghana, H\u00fcseyin \u00c7elik, Turkish Minister of Education, Femi Fani-Kayode, former Nigerian Minister of Culture and Tourism and former Minister of Aviation, Kraisak Choonhavan, Former Senator in Thailand, Samia Nkrumah, Hammad Azhar, Former Pakistan Minister for Economic Affairs and Minister for Industries and Production, Ghanaian Member of Parliament and Mohamed Jameel Ahmed, 4th Vice President of the Maldives.

Although the IRD was founded under Clement Attlee's post-WWII Labour Party government (1945-1951) the department has been headed by numerous different politicians of both the Labour Party and Conservative Party, including Ralph Murray, John Rennie, and Ray Whitney. Although the vast majority of IRD staff were British subjects, the department also hired emigres from the Soviet Union, such as the rocket scientist Grigori Tokaty. Other staffers of note include Robert Conquest, whose secretary Celia Kirwan collected Orwell's list. Tracy Philipps was also based at the IRD, working to recruit emigres from Eastern Europe. Many IRD agents were former members of Britain's WWII propaganda department, the Political Warfare Executive (PWE), including former Daily Mirror journalist Leslie Sheridan. This high level of PWE veterans within the IRD, coupled with the similarities between how these two propaganda departments operated, has led some historians to describe the department as a \"peacetime PWE\"."]}, {"page": "Ray Whitney", "response": ["Ray Whitney may refer to:", "*Ray Whitney (politician) (1930\u20132012), British politician", "*Ray Whitney (ice hockey) (born 1972), ice hockey forward"]}, {"page": "Raymond William Whitley", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ray Whitney (politician)"]}, {"page": "Dean Godson, Baron Godson", "response": ["During the 1980s, Godson was Research Assistant to Sir Ray Whitney, MP for Wycombe.
