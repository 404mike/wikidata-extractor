He too originally wanted to go to sea, but was instead apprenticed to a timber yard where he worked for fifty years whilst painting in his spare time. His lifelong love of ships, shown in many of his seascapes, meant that he became an expert ship modeler. He sat for many hours in his house overlooking the harbor and watched the waves, skies and gulls. He is best known for his marine works in oil and watercolor, although he also painted Norfolk landscapes and well as continental scenes. He helped to found the Great Yarmouth and District Society of Artists and, following painting holidays, was elected a member of the St Ives Society of Artists.\nHe won the Watts prize in 1949 for the best picture portraying men working at sea. He was later made a member of ROI. He has influenced many of the later East Anglian landscape artists.\nExhibitions Include:\nThe RA 1949, The RBA, RI, RWS as well as in Europe and East Anglia.\nHe was born in Gorleston, Norfolk, England, and spent his entire career with a timber firm at Great Yarmouth. He also visited Cornwall and became associated with the St Ives community of painters there.\nHis work is represented in the Great Yarmouth Maritime Collection.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gorleston-on-Sea", "response": ["* Rowland Fisher (1885\u20131969) painter,   Hatfield Hines Galleries website, Rowland Fisher, 1885-1969 retrieved January 2018 mainly known for his seascapes"]}, {"page": "Fisher (surname)", "response": ["*Rowland Fisher (1885\u20131969), English painter"]}, {"page": "National Museum of Serbia", "response": ["Includes painters usually from the late 19th century, mostly impressionist and post-impressionist.
