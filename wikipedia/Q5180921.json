He subsequently played for Livingston, Leyton Orient, Swindon Town, Southend United, Dunfermline Athletic and Torquay United before retiring as a player in 2013. After becoming a coach at Raith Rovers in July 2016, Easton decided to re-register as a player. Easton also represented the Scotland under-21 team between 1998 and 2001, making 22 appearances.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Paul Sturrock", "response": ["Sturrock faced the tough task of rebuilding the Southend side with only five first team players available for selection at one stage of pre-season, with only Anthony Grant, Matt Paterson and Scott Spencer surviving. He soon appointed new signing Craig Easton, who he had previously managed at Swindon Town, as captain while another player from one of Sturrock's old clubs, Chris Barker, was later appointed as vice-captain, having initially been signed on loan, and then permanently on deadline day. It was not an easy task for Sturrock as his assistant, Tommy Widdrington left for \"footballing reasons\" on Wednesday 15 December 2010. After a mid table finish in his first season, he enjoyed more success during the 2011\u201312 season where Southend led League Two for most of the campaign.

He signed a two-year contract with the club at the end of the month on a free transfer. On 30 April 2011, Barker was voted Southend's player of the year for the 2010\u201311 season.
