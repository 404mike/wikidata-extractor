He was quite capable in most academic subjects, but he excelled at sports, particularly fives, and his good looks and acrobatic talents made him a popular figure. He developed a reputation for mischief, and frequently refused to do his homework. A former classmate referred to him as a \"scruffy little boy\", while an old teacher remembered \"the naughty little boy who was always making a noise in the back row and would never do his homework\". He spent his evenings working backstage in Bristol theaters, and was responsible for the lighting for magician David Devant at the Bristol Empire in 1917 at the age of 13. He began hanging around backstage at the theater at every opportunity, and volunteered for work in the summer as a messenger boy and guide at the military docks in Southampton, to escape the unhappiness of his home life. The time spent at Southampton strengthened his desire to travel; he was eager to leave Bristol and tried to sign on as a ship's cabin boy, but he was too young."]}, {"page": "Highgate Cemetery", "response": ["* David Devant, theatrical magician"]}, {"page": "Music hall", "response": ["* Magic acts, such as David Devant."]}, {"page": "Oliver Lodge", "response": ["Magician John Booth noted that the stage mentalist David Devant managed to fool a number of people into believing he had genuine psychic ability who did not realize that his feats were magic tricks.
