The Grease Band was named after Cocker read an interview with jazz keyboardist Jimmy Smith, where Smith positively described another musician as \"having a lot of grease.\" Like the Avengers, Cocker's group mostly played in pubs in and around Sheffield. The Grease Band came to the attention of Denny Cordell, the producer of Procol Harum, the Moody Blues and Georgie Fame. Cocker recorded the single \"Marjorine\" without the Grease Band for Cordell in a London studio. He then moved to London with Chris Stainton, and the Grease Band was dissolved. Cordell set Cocker up with a residency at the Marquee Club in London, and a \"new\" Grease Band was formed with Stainton and keyboardist Tommy Eyre.", "During his US tour, Cocker played at several large festivals, including the Newport Rock Festival and the Denver Pop Festival. In August, Denny Cordell heard about the planned concert in Woodstock, New York and convinced organiser Artie Kornfeld to book Cocker and the Grease Band for the Woodstock Festival. The group had to be flown into the festival by helicopter due to the large crowds. They performed several songs, including \"Feelin' Alright?\", \"Something's Comin' On\", \"Let's Go Get Stoned\", \"I Shall Be Released\" and \"With a Little Help from My Friends\". Cocker would later say that the experience was \"like an eclipse\u00a0... it was a very special day.\"", "Despite Cocker's reluctance to venture out on the road again, an American tour had already been booked so he had to quickly form a new band in order to fulfill his contractual obligations. It proved to be a large group of more than 20 musicians, including pianist and bandleader Leon Russell, three drummers \u2013 Jim Gordon, Jim Keltner, and Chuck Blackwell, and backing vocalists Rita Coolidge and Claudia Lennear. Denny Cordell christened the new band \"Mad Dogs & Englishmen\", after the No\u00ebl Coward song of the same name (with its refrain, \"Mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the midday sun\"). Cocker's music evolved into a more bluesy type of rock, comparable to that of the Rolling Stones.", "Shortly after the Australian tour, Stainton retired from his music career to establish his own recording studio. After his friend's departure and his estrangement from his longtime producer Denny Cordell, Cocker sank into depression and began using heroin.

But then \"Everyday\", another Pinder-Laine song, stalled at No. 44 in October 1965 and no further British singles were released for about a year. The group was still in demand for live gigs, though, and they had chart success in the US and in Europe during those months when \"Bye Bye Bird\" (Decca AT 15048) was lifted from their album in December 1965 as an overseas single in France (No. 3)."]}, {"page": "The Cranberries", "response": ["On 18 April 1991, the group played a decisive show in their hometown at Jetland Center as part of the University of Limerick's RAG Week to 1,400 students.

Shortly thereafter, the band changed their name to \"The Cranberries\". Nothing Left at All began to circulate in the UK with the support of John Best PR agency. Then, they performed their first UK tour opening for the British band Moose over the course of three weeks. The Cranberries received more letters expressing interest from Virgin, EMI, Imago, CBS, and Warner, which led the Hogan brothers to quit their jobs. Eventually the group signed a six-album deal with Island Records who won the battle through Denny Cordell. In mid-1991, the Cranberries headed back into the studio with Gilmore as their producer to \"hastily\" record their first EP Uncertain and created a music video for the title track, which was not released. Gilmore, in an incoherent gesture, made various alterations to the album's rough cuts. 5,000 total copies of Uncertain were printed and released in October 1991 by Island Records under the Xeric name. The EP received poor reviews in the press and led to tension between the group and Gilmore. By this time, Gilmore began restricting information to the Cranberries and made separate arrangements with Island's U.S branch. In October 1991 the Cranberries performed at Underworld in London during a UK and Ireland tour. Adding to this period of doubt, touring conditions and money were lacking with maximum earnings of $25 a day. On 9 December 1991, the Cranberries was supposed to support Nirvana in Belfast's Conor Hall, but Nirvana canceled their tour at the last moment as well as the five remaining shows due to Kurt Cobain's ill health."]}, {"page": "1995 in music", "response": ["** Denny Cordell, English record producer, 51"]}, {"page": "Procol Harum", "response": ["At Olympic Studios, southwest London, with session drummer (and non-Paramount) Bill Eyden, producer Denny Cordell and sound engineer Keith Grant, the group recorded \"A Whiter Shade of Pale\", and it was released on 12 May 1967.

Wood was uncomfortable with this sensationalism, and many concert promoters responded by banning The Move from live performances, but it succeeded in drawing media attention and concert audiences to the group. Eventually, Secunda also managed to persuade Wood to begin writing songs for the band during his time off. They secured a production contract with independent record producer Denny Cordell, but that was turned into a media event by Secunda, who arranged for the band to sign their contracts on the back of Liz Wilson, a topless female model. Wood wrote their first single, \"Night of Fear\", a No. 2 hit on the UK Singles Chart in January 1967, which began the Move's practice of musical quotation (in this case, the 1812 Overture by Tchaikovsky).

During this period the label had both album and single success with artists such as The Move, Procol Harum, Joe Cocker, and Tyrannosaurus Rex.
