Boxing History: Cribb vs. Molineaux Cribb beat Molineaux in 35 rounds and became World champion. The fight was controversial for two reasons: Molineaux was injured when the crowd invaded the ring, and Cribb at one point seemed to have taken longer than the specified time to return to the centre of the ring.Egan, Boxiana, Volume I, 1813. Cribb retained his title in 1811 by beating Molineaux at Thistleton Gap in Rutland in 11 rounds before a large crowd.

He is taken to London by his uncle Sir Charles Tregellis, a highly respected gentleman and arbiter of fashion who is on familiar terms with the most important people of Great Britain. The novel interweaves Rodney's coming-of-age story with that of his friend Boy Jim's boxing endeavours. Jim has been brought up by a blacksmith whom he believes to be his uncle - the blacksmith Harrison was a famous former boxer and the 'nephew' wishes to fight too.  So a large portion of it deals with the famous bare-knuckle boxers of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, such as Jem Belcher, John Jackson, Daniel Mendoza, Dutch Sam, and others.  The book includes vignettes of a number of historical personages, notably the Prince Regent, Lord Nelson, Sir John Lade, Lord Cochrane and Beau Brummell. There are also descriptions of thuggery, of gambling and cheating, and of dangerous horse drawn chases."]}, {"page": "1801 in sports", "response": ["* The first English champion of the 19th century is Jem Belcher, known as the \"Napoleon of the Ring\", who holds the title from 1800 to 1805.Cyber Boxing Zone \u2013 Jem Belcher.

He is best remembered for fighting and seconding the most number of fights for any boxer of his era.  His bout with Jem Belcher was considered by a few historians to be for a Championship of England, though the boxers differed significantly in weight.  There was no formal sanctioning body to confer global or even national championship status on the fight during the period, and no real formal recognition of weight classes at the time.", "He fought several notable bare-knuckle boxers of his day, including Caleb Baldwin, and Jem Belcher, though most of his fights went unreported in the larger London area newspapers of the period.", "He fought Harris the Spaniard for a purse, in a match lasting 20 minutes at Lansdowne, on 12 August 1795.   According to \"Puglistica\", Harris bolted with the purse, 20 minutes into the fighting, ending the match. Present at the competition was the youthful Jem Belcher, a future champion.Famous Fights Past and Present, Volume 1, No. 4, edited by Harold Furniss, London, England, 1904, pg. 56-7", "====Championship with Jem Belcher, 1799====", "In what many consider his most important fight, on 12 April 1799, he lost to the young future English champion Jem Belcher in seventeen rounds lasting thirty-three minutes, for a considerable purse of \u00a350 at West London's Old Oak Common just beyond Wormwood Scrubbs.  The contest was considered by a few to be a middle or heavyweight Championship match of England, though it was early in Belcher's career. Jones had as his seconds Joe Ward and Dick Hall. Most boxing historians note that though the match was Belcher's first in a London ring, that Jones, a bare-knuckle veteran of 13 years, had yet to be defeated in any of his matches.  Jem, though later to be a great champion, was only around 18 at the time of the fight, to Jones's experienced 30.  Paddington weighed around 147 and according to varying accounts Belcher weighed more,  but was three inches shorter than Jones. Puglistica, the most reliable source, listed Belcher's weight at 174 lbs., in the light heavyweight range, but a few sources list his weight as closer to 160 in the middleweight range.  Belcher had seen Jones fight the Spaniard Harris, and had studied his style.  He was quick and could return to his defensive stance rapidly after striking a blow, and he was a strong and rapid two-handed fighter.  In the first few rounds they fought somewhat evenly, with Jones even knocking down Belcher once.  Belcher was said to dodge the vast majority of Jones's punches in the first three rounds.  By the fifth, Belcher began to exhibit a more aggressive style, taking advantage of his youth and speed.  Belcher leveled Jones with a blow between the eyes in the tenth which was a turning point for the match, and though Jones put up a valiant effort, he was leveled in many subsequent rounds, and his second threw up the sponge in the 17th. It was a clean fight throughout with no hugging, shifting, or hauling displayed by either antagonist.\"Famous Fights Past and Present\", edited by Harold Furniss, Volume 4, London, England, 1904", "On 31 July 1801, he lost to Isaac Bitton, a skilled and well known Jewish boxer of the period, at Wimbledon Common.  Bitton, a Scott and student of Daniel Mendoza, won the contest by knockout.  According to one source, Mendoza was present at the fight, and seconded his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Bitton.\"Famous Fights Past and Present\", edited by Harold Furniss, London, England, 1904, pg. 47.Bitton was a student of Mendoza in \"Golding, Louis\", \"Champion Jem Belcher Meets a Tartar\", Times Columnist, Victoria, Canada, pg. 28, 3 September 1949  Jones, seconded by champion Jem Belcher who also helped arrange the bout, was around 32, to Bitton's youthful 22.  According to Puglistica, Bitton was the larger and stronger combatant.  Jones was said to have the best of it in the early rounds, but Bitton came from behind and won the match, though Jones led the betting by 3-1, as a result of strong backing by wealthy patrons. Jones was unable to continue the match and resume the contest after being knocked nearly senseless after 20 minutes of fighting.  The purse was a substantial 40 guineas.  According to one account, a riot occurred after Bitton, the Jewish boxer, defeated Jones, between the large Jewish audience and the wealthy and largely Christian backers of Jones and his second Jem Belcher.\"Today in Pugilistic Annals\", The Gazette, Cedar Rapids, Iowa, pg. 7, 13 July 1914 ", "| Jem Belcher*"]}]}}
