The sport of cricket in this period had already acquired most of its modern features such as eleven-a-side, the three-stump wicket and the lbw law, although pitch preparation was rudimentary and play was largely dictated by the weather. The main difference was in bowling which was still mostly underarm, the key development of the period being the movement towards roundarm bowling which began in the late eighteenth century and was gathering pace by 1825.\nThe principal club throughout the period was Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) which was founded in 1787. MCC organised the early Gentlemen v Players matches and most of the games played by occasional XIs such as those led by Colonel Lennox, Lord Frederick Beauclerk, George Osbaldeston and others. Inter-county cricket was rare during the Napoleonic Wars and there were no formally constituted county clubs at the time, but the main centres at county level were Berkshire, Essex, Hampshire, Kent, Middlesex, Surrey and Sussex. Towards the end of the period, Cambridge University became prominent, especially through its series of matches against the Cambridge Town Club. In the north of England, cricket was developing through town clubs which became the focal points of the game in their respective counties, especially Nottingham Cricket Club and Sheffield Cricket Club.\nThe players included are those known to have played in matches which were given retrospective first-class status between 1787 and 1825 inclusive.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Soane", "response": ["Soane is the name of:", "* Bryan Soane (born 1988), Australian footballer", "* George Soane (1790\u20131860), English writer and dramatist", "* Henry Soane (1622\u20131661), Virginia politician and landowner", "* John Soane (1753\u20131837), English architect and collector", "* Stuart Soane (born 1987), Scottish footballer", "* Soane (1790s cricketer) (born c. 1770), an English cricketer active in the 1790s", "* Soane Asi (born 1963), Tongan former rugby union player", "* Soane Havea (born 1981), Tongan rugby union player", "* Soane Lilo Foliaki (1933\u20132013), Roman Catholic bishop of Tonga", "* Soane-Patita Lavuia, king of Wallis Island from 1910 until 1916", "* Soane Patita Maituku (born 1947), Tu'i Agaifo of Alo, Tonga", "* Soane Patita Paini Mafi (born 1961), Roman Catholic Bishop of Tonga", "* Soane Toke, king of Wallis Island for one day in 1953", "* Soane Tonga\u02bbuiha (born 1982), Tongan rugby union player", "* Sir John Soane's Museum, London", "* Zeb Soanes (born 1976)", "* Soane Monument"]}]}}
