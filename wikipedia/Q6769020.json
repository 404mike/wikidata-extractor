He has since moved into coaching.\nNewson's career began as an apprentice at Charlton Athletic, although he made no first-team appearances for the club and was released in 1979. He signed for Maidstone United ahead of the 1979\u201380 season, and spent six seasons with the club, enjoying success when Maidstone won the 1983\u201384 Alliance Premier League. He joined Bournemouth in 1985, and captained the side to the Third Division title during the 1986\u201387 season. Newson later signed for Fulham in 1989, captaining the club for four years. He was captain at Barnet for two years, before joining Tottenham Hotspur on loan in order to play in the club's 1995 UEFA Intertoto Cup games. He spent a brief spell at Swedish club \u00d6sters, before playing out the remainder of his career at four different non-league clubs.\nAfter gaining a number of coaching qualifications, Newson began coaching as a youth team coach at West Ham United. He later became assistant manager at VCD Athletic in 2009, before moving to Chatham Town a year later. He was appointed as a youth team coach at Championship club Crystal Palace in 2011. He then spent a-year-and-two-months as assistant manager at League One side Stevenage.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Linvoy Primus", "response": ["In the second game of the 1994\u201395 season against Leyton Orient, Primus made his debut as a substitute coming on for the injured Mark Newson. His next appearance for Barnet, against Scarborough, was described as the \"worst performance of [his] career\" in his autobiography. He went on to say that he was \"weighed down by the burden of expectation\" and heard someone say he was the \"worst player we've ever had at Barnet\". He was often nervous before matches and recited the Lord's Prayer as a way of coping with his anxiety. At the end of the season, Primus was runner-up in the voting for the Player of the Season and was man of the match on several occasions. Barnet had a poor start to the next season and they were at the bottom of the table in mid-September. After beating Northampton Town 2\u20130, Barnet went on an 11-game winning streak which ended at Colchester United despite Primus scoring a goal. He would go on to score five goals in the season; more than any other season in his career. Once again, he was runner-up in the Player of the Season award, this time to the goalkeeper Maik Taylor."]}, {"page": "Gary Phillips (footballer)", "response": ["Phillips joined League One side Stevenage as the club's goalkeeping coach in February 2012.
