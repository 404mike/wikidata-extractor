He was known for his mathematical abilities and knowledge of engineering, was involved in the design of the Calcutta dockyard, and served as a chief engineer of Bengal. An area in Calcutta known as Watgunge is named after him. \nWatson was the son of a grazier from Holbeach, Lincolnshire. He showed a talent for mathematics at Birke's school in Gosberton near Spalding. He was recommended to Thomas Whichcote of Harpeswell, MP for Lincolnshire, who had him tested by the master of Brigg school, following which he nominated Watson to the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich. He received training from Professor Thomas Simpson who became a close friend and contributed articles to The Ladies' Diary, a mathematical periodical.\nWatson was commissioned on 27 December 1755 in the 52nd foot, Abercrombie's regiment. He transferred to the 50th foot, Studholme Hodgson's regiment, on 25 September 1757. Watson passed Woolwich Academy on 17 March 1759 and was commissioned as a sub-engineer.\nBefore Simpson died in 1760 he left his mathematical manuscripts with Watson to be revised and published. Watson was unable to do this; he was posted to Belleisle under Commodore Keppel and General Hodgson and then to Havana under Admiral Sir George Pocock.\nTaking part in sieges and actions, Watson was promoted to 104th foot. On 4 February 1763 he was recommended by Lord Clive to be sent to India. He arrived in Calcutta in 1764, and was a field engineer in the East India Company from 9 May and chief engineer of Bengal. His works included improving Fort William, and works at Budge Budge and Melancholy Point. He designed and proposed dry and wet docks at Calcutta but this was not completed due to lack of funds. He had two warships, Nonsuch and Surprise, built by George Louch under his direction.\nHe became a lieutenant colonel in January 1775 and returned to England, where he translated Euler's Compleat Theory of the Construction and Properties of Vessels (1776).\nHe was recalled to India in 1780, and took along with him the mathematician Reuben Burrow. He also worked with James Creassy.Watson's health declined. He resigned in January 1786 and left India in the spring. He reached Dover, but died there, and was buried on 22 September in a vault in St. Mary's Church there.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Henry Watson", "response": ["Henry Watson may refer to:", "*Henry Watson Jr. (1810\u20131891), American lawyer and planter", "* Colonel Henry Watson (1737\u20131786), British military engineer", "*Henry Watson Fowler (1858\u20131933), English schoolmaster and lexicographer"]}, {"page": "Reuben Burrow", "response": ["In 1774, Burrow and William Menzies aided Maskelyne in his observations in the Schiehallion experiment, to examine the deflection by gravity of the plumbline towards the mountain. He complained later that his services were insufficiently recognised. Burrow was liable to use words of abuse at anyone and he did not think Maskelyne deserved his position. Soon afterwards, however, he was appointed \u2018mathematical teacher in the drawing-room at the Tower,\u2019 where there was then a training school for artillery officers, afterwards merged into the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. His salary was \u00a3100 a year. Here he became editor of the Ladies and Gentlemen's Diary, or Royal Almanack. It was started by Thomas Carnan, in opposition to the Ladies' Diary, published by the Stationers' Company and edited by Charles Hutton and like it included mathematical puzzles. The company claimed a monopoly of almanacs, but their claim was disallowed by the court of common pleas, on their bringing an action against Carnan, who published the first number of his diary in December 1775. It continued till 1786, the word 'Gentlemen' being dropped after 1780. Part of it was devoted to mathematical problems by Burrow and various contributors. Burrow quarrelled with his rival, Charles Hutton. Falling out with Maskelyne and others, he eked out his living by taking private pupils, and did a little work for publishers; a bit of work at London brought him in contact with Colonel Henry Watson, for many years chief engineer in Bengal under Lord Clive. Watson recommended him to Lord Townsend as a good candidate \"to teach mathematics", "to the Cadets of the drawing room\" of the tower. In 1777 he worked on a survey of the coast \"from Naze in Essex to Hollseby bay in Sussex\" (actually Suffolk) to assess vulnerabilities to attack by the French. He was joined by a party of pupils and the fleet was commanded by Admiral Howe. He later complained to master-general of the ordnance, the duke of Richmond, that he was not paid \"a farthing\". Henry Watson in the meantime was recalled to Bengal and offered to take Burrow along. Burrow resigned on 30 April 1782 \"in order to go to the East Indies.\" "]}, {"page": "Watgunge", "response": ["Watgunge is named after Colonel Henry Watson (1737\u20131786), who set up the first dockyard in Bengal.Nair, P.Thankappan, The Growth and Development of Old Calcutta, in Calcutta, the Living City, Vol. I, p. 20, Edited by Sukanta Chaudhuri, Oxford University Press, 1995 edition."]}, {"page": "Henry Watson (1737-1786)", "response": ["#REDIRECT :Henry Watson (1737\u20131786)"]}]}}
