They then tailored their operas to the particular abilities of these performers.Jacobs, p. 111; Ainger, pp. 133\u201334 The skill with which Gilbert and Sullivan used their performers had an effect on the audience: as critic Herman Klein wrote, \"we secretly marvelled at the naturalness and ease with which [the Gilbertian quips and absurdities] were said and done. For until then no living soul had seen upon the stage such weird, eccentric, yet intensely human beings\u00a0.... [They] conjured into existence a hitherto unknown comic world of sheer delight.\"Jacobs, p. 113 Gilbert acted as stage director for his own plays and operas. He sought naturalism in acting, which was unusual at the time, just as he strove for realistic visual elements. He deprecated self-conscious interaction with the audience and insisted on a style of portrayal in which the characters were never aware of their own absurdity but were coherent internal wholes.Cox-Ife, William.
