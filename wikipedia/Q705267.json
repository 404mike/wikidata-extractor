Upon his passing, his successor Paul Kidby painted a portrait of Kirby into the cover art of the novel Night Watch, in tribute to the artist."]}, {"page": "Northolt", "response": ["* Paul Kidby, artist, known for his association with author Terry Pratchett's Discworld, was born in Northolt."]}, {"page": "Fordingbridge", "response": ["* Paul Kidby \u2013 artist, born 1964, best known for his art based on Terry Pratchett's Discworld, lives and works in Fordingbridge"]}, {"page": "Sam Vimes", "response": ["He first appeared in the novel Guards!

Her hair is pure white, but with a streak of black running through it from end to end.  Although its natural state is a frizzy mass reminiscent of a dandelion, it rearranges its style of its own accord depending on Susan's mood; it tends to form a tight bun while she is working. Susan's hair is an inverted homage to Elsa Lanchester's appearance in Bride of Frankenstein, in which she wore a black beehive wig with white streaks. In The Art of Discworld, Paul Kidby draws Susan in Edwardian clothing, which he feels fits well with her job as a nanny in Hogfather."]}, {"page": "The Pratchett Portfolio", "response": ["The Pratchett Portfolio is a small collection of the artistic works of Paul Kidby, illustrating the characters of Terry Pratchett's Discworld.
