English physicist and inventor Shelford Bidwell constructed the phototelegraph in 1881 that scanned and transmitted images using selenium photocells. German physicist Arthur Korn in the early 1900s developed a practical mechanical television system, known as the Bildtelegraph, that transmitted photographs and fingerprints of criminals. In the early 1900s, French photographer and engineer \u00c9douard Belin invented a phototelegraphic apparatus called the B\u00e9linographe (t\u00e9lest\u00e9r\u00e9ographe), which was a system for receiving photographs over telephone wires and was used by newspapers. His system was used beginning in 1928 by French radio stations to broadcast scanned photographs over airwaves. In 1923, Richard H. Ranger, engineer of Radio Corporation of America, invented the wireless photoradiogram radio facsimile that was able to scan and send images of pictures and signed documents across the Atlantic Ocean, between England and the United States. Herbert E. Ives, television engineer of AT&T, designed a system in 1927 that transmitted live scanned images of a person's face using electronic \"electric eyes\" mounted in a cabinet. This was a forerunner of the movable studio television camera and the hand-held camcorder."]}, {"page": "Shelford", "response": ["* Shelford Bidwell (1848\u20131909), English physicist and inventor"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society A, B, C", "response": ["| Shelford Bidwell||04/06/1886||6 March 1848 \u2013 18 December 1909"]}, {"page": "Bidwell (surname)", "response": ["* Shelford Bidwell (1848\u20131909), English physicist and inventor", "* Shelford Bidwell (historian) (1913\u20131996), English soldier  and historian"]}, {"page": "List of presidents of the Institute of Physics", "response": ["*1897\u20131899 Shelford Bidwell"]}]}}
