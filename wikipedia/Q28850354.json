He was born in Wallingford; died in Eastbourne.Pawling's uncle and guardian was Charles Mudie, proprietor of Mudie's Circulating Library, and Pawling worked at Mudies from the age of 15. In 1893 he became a partner in the publishing house of William Heinemann, and he remained the minority partner until his death, when tributes were paid to his solid business acumen.Pawling was a stalwart of Hampstead Cricket Club and at one time reputed to be the fastest bowler in England. It was said that on one occasion he matched himself against Fred Spofforth, the Australian fast bowler, in bowling across the County Ground at Essex. Spofforth's ball apparently reached the rails, but Pawling's did so and also rebounded back three yards.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Heinemann (publisher)", "response": ["William Heinemann began working in the publishing industry under Nicolas Tr\u00fcbner, who was a major publisher of what was called Oriental scholarship. When, two years after Tr\u00fcbner's death, his company was taken over by the firm of Kegan Paul, Heinemann left and founded William Heinemann Ltd in Covent Garden, London, in 1890. The first title published was Hall Caine's The Bondman, which was a \"stunning success\", selling more than 450,000 copies. The company also released a number of works translated into English under the branding of \"Heinemann's International Library\", edited by Edmund Gosse. In 1893, Sydney Pawling became a partner. They became known for publishing the works of Sarah Grand. The company published the British version of Scribners' Great Education Series under the title Heinemann's Great Education Series, but did not include credits for the original American editor, Nicholas Murray Butler, an omission for which they were criticized."]}]}}
