Diana was represented by Anthony Julius in the case. She received a lump sum settlement of \u00a317million () as well as \u00a3400,000 per year. The couple signed a confidentiality agreement that prohibited them from discussing the details of the divorce or of their married life. Days before, letters patent were issued with general rules to regulate royal titles after divorce. Diana lost the style \"Her Royal Highness\" and instead was styled Diana, Princess of Wales. As the mother of the prince expected to one day ascend to the throne, she continued to be regarded as a member of the royal family and was accorded the same precedence she enjoyed during her marriage. The Queen reportedly wanted to let Diana continue to use the style of Royal Highness after her divorce, but Charles had insisted on removing it. Prince William was reported to have reassured his mother: \"Don't worry, Mummy, I will give it back to you one day when I am King.\" Almost a year before, according to Tina Brown, Prince Philip had warned Diana: \"If you don't behave, my girl, we'll take your title away.\" She is said to have replied: \"My title is a lot older than yours, Philip.\"", "Diana remains one of the most popular members of the royal family throughout history, and she continues to influence the younger generations of royals. She was a major presence on the world stage from her engagement to Prince Charles in 1981 until her death in 1997, and was often described as the \"world's most photographed woman\". She was noted for her compassion, style, charisma, and high-profile charity work, as well as her ill-fated marriage. Diana's former private secretary, Patrick Jephson described her as an organised and hardworking person, and pointed out Charles was not able to \"reconcile with his wife's extraordinary popularity\", a viewpoint supported by biographer Tina Brown. He also said she was a tough boss who was \"equally quick to appreciate hard work\", but could also be defiant \"if she felt she had been the victim of injustice\". Diana's mother also defined her as a \"loving\" figure who could occasionally be \"tempestuous\". Paul Burrell, who worked as a butler for Diana, remembered her as a \"deep thinker\" capable of \"introspective analysis\". She was often described as a devoted mother to her children, who are believed to be influenced by her personality and way of life.", "In the early years, Diana was often noted for her shy nature. Journalist Michael White perceived her as being \"smart\", \"shrewd and funny\". Those who communicated with her closely describe her as a person who was led by \"her heart\". In an article for The Guardian, Monica Ali described Diana as a woman with a strong character, who entered the royal family as an inexperienced girl and, despite being uneducated, she could handle their expectations and overcome the difficulties and sufferings of her marital life. Ali also believed that she \"had a lasting influence on the public discourse, particularly in matters of mental health\" by discussing her eating disorder publicly. According to Tina Brown, in her early years Diana possessed a \"passive power\", a quality that in her opinion she shared with the Queen Mother and a trait that would enable her to instinctively use her appeal to achieve her goals.

He described it as a song that was designed as \"'Vision of Love' meets 'Hero'\", and wrote, \"Mariah is back in the adult contemporary camp, no longer trying to prove that she's real.\" Cara DiPasquale from the Chicago Tribune called it a \"powerhouse ballad\", while Entertainment Weeklys Tom Sinclair wrote \"embellished with her trademark vocal pyrotechnics, it is one of those highly personal songs about finding your way out of an emotional wilderness, but it sinks in its own sodden sentimentality\". Similarly, a writer from Newsday also described \"Through the Rain\" as a \"powerhouse ballad\", and felt it was reminiscent of Carey's previous single \"One Sweet Day\" (1995). Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Randy Lewis noted how the song was able to effectively take listeners right into Carey's personal struggles from the previous year. Tina Brown from Newsweek felt that while Carey's personal troubles may not have been fully solved, the song made her appear \"strong and triumphant\". Bob Waliszewski of Plugged In noted that \"Through the Rain\" \"encourages listeners to weather life's storms with the help of faith, prayer and perseverance\"."]}, {"page": "George W. S. Trow", "response": ["In 1994, when new editor Tina Brown invited Roseanne Barr to oversee a special issue on women, Trow quit the magazine in protest. He abandoned the house he was building in Germantown, New York, and traveled around North America, living in Texas, Alaska, and Newfoundland. Several years before his death, he moved to Naples, Italy. In 2006 he died there, alone, having secluded himself for a decade."]}, {"page": "Robert Gottlieb", "response": ["**July 1, 1992, Deirdre Carmody, \"Tina Brown to Take Over at The New Yorker\""]}, {"page": "Wigwag (magazine)", "response": ["Notable staffers at Wigwag include Nancy Holyoke, who went on (with the help of Harriet Brown, another Wigwag editor, now a professor at the S.
