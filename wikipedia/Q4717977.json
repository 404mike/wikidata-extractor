The EP showcased a heavier post-hardcore influenced sound that differed greatly to Busted's material. The EP was recorded during November with Mark Williams in London.

After the show, they returned to Simpson's flat and played guitars and a v-drum kit; they then wrote their first song, \"Too Much Punch\". Westaway later invited his school friend Haigh to practise with the band, and they began booking rehearsal sessions.

It was a critical success, though Punknews.org reviewed it negatively. Alex Westaway, the band's lead guitarist and co-lyricist, drew its artwork (based on Edward Norton) for the booklet; the EP's lead single, \"Palahniuk's Laughter\", was inspired by David Fincher's film Fight Club (1999), which in turn was based on the novel of the same name by Chuck Palahniuk. \"Palahniuk's Laughter\" received heavy rotation on music-video channels and spent many weeks on charts based on video and radio requests. The track, originally entitled \"Out Swimming in the Flood\", was renamed after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. The EP's UK version contained five tracks (including a sixth hidden track), and was ineligible for the UK Singles Chart.

Richardson, who had previously produced albums for Funeral for a Friend, Machine Head and Fear Factory, was meticulous during pre-production and took five days to tune the drums.

Upon completion of recording in December, Simpson stated, \"We're so happy with what were doing. No matter how people perceive it when it comes out, we'll still be very proud and that's the most important thing.\" Richardson was also \"immensely proud\" of the completed record, adding, \"It's records like these that will go a long way to putting the British scene back on the map.

Westaway has explained that \"[R]elationships and things we've actually experienced are involved, but the basic concept is about two people who experience the last few days of life as they know it before the world's ended. Neon Genesis and stuff. It's from a manga series called Evangelion, which is about angels that come down from heaven to wipe out human kind. It's related to that same kind of feeling, that only chosen people survive, and the world becomes a better place afterwards.\"", "Journalist Chris Long of BBC Music wrote a favourable review and opined that \"[M]ake no mistake, Fightstar are Charlie Simpson's proper grown-up band, a full-on rock machine. Bursting with energy and thrilling on several tunes, not least the dual powers of the split title track and the throbbing 'Paint Your Target', Grand Unification is a belting collection\". Sharon Mawar of AllMusic was also complimentary in her review, awarding the album 3\u00bd stars out of five; \"[T]he album opens with a dreamy acoustic instrumental, 'To Sleep', and then the feedback of Alex Westaway's guitar crashed in and the first part of 'Grand Unification' arrived. The second part, later in the album, had a spoken interlude and a softly sung melody over a chilled-out song, at least its first two minutes. Between the two parts was a hard rock album with heavy hitting guitar chords and screamed vocals. It's not quite as angry as Slipknot, but not too far behind, either, although 'Build an Army' certainly sounds like a call to arms.
