The 36-year-old Essex left-arm spinner John Childs made his debut, becoming the oldest England debutant since Dick Howorth in 1947.  Childs joined the recalled Gatting and DeFreitas, and newcomer David Capel. Small and Jarvis were both unavailable as a result of injury, and Pringle was dropped.  Most media attention however was focused on Broad, who was also dropped, \"ostensibly for his consistent failure to make runs in home Tests, but there was always a suspicion that he was being disciplined for the incident at Lord's when he was spotted by a television camera mouthing his disappointment at an lbw decision\".  For West Indies, Haynes was unfit, ending a run of 72 consecutive caps. He was replaced by the spinner Harper, and Patterson was replaced by Benjamin."]}, {"page": "1986 English cricket season", "response": ["*Wisden - John Childs, Graeme Hick, Dilip Vengsarkar, Courtney Walsh, James Whitaker"]}, {"page": "John Childs", "response": ["John Childs may refer to:", "*John Childs (aviator), 18th century aviator", "*John Childs (cricketer) (born 1951), English cricketer", "*John Childs (murderer), British man convicted of six murders in 1979", "*John Childs (historian) (born 1949), professor of military history", "*John Childs, victim of the 1995 kidnapping of Western tourists in Kashmir"]}, {"page": "List of Gloucestershire County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* John Childs (1975\u20131984) : J.
