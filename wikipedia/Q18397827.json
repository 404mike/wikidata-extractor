Robert Hutchison, Thomas's heir responsible for completing the castle, was a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and an expert in arboriculture, leaving the wine trade behind. Two of his sons were knighted for their contributions to the realm: Sir Robert Hutchison, First Baronet of Thurle in Streatly in the County of Berkshire, a respected medical authority and the President of the Royal College of Physicians and Sir Thomas Hutchison, Lord Provost of Edinburgh, First Baronet of Hardiston in the County of Kinross, who held the office from 1921\u20131923. Robert's niece was the renowned Arctic explorer and botanist Isobel Wylie Hutchison. ", "Unlike Robert Hutchison, his younger brother Thomas Hutchison (Isobel Wylie Hutchison's father) devoted himself to the wine trade in the family tradition. Having spent time in India where he set about expanding the business and amassed considerable wealth, he returned and married at the age of 40. For the first few years of his marriage, he lived with his wife at his family's former home of Glendevon House where their eldest two children Nita and Walter were born.", "However, Thomas's elder brother's lifestyle and academic pursuits had exhausted the family's fortunes and they had fallen into debt. In 1888, to rescue the reputation of the family and the home where he had grown up, Thomas paid off his brother's debts and took over Carlowrie Castle. Isobel Wylie Hutchison was the first of his children to be born there on 30th May 1889. Two further children were born at the castle, and Carlowrie remained with this branch of the Hutchison family until Isobel's death and subsequent sale of the property in 1982.", "thumb|Isobel Wylie Hutchison in an eskimo coat on expedition", "The twentieth century was a tumultuous period for the castle. Thomas Hutchison passed away in 1900 after contracting a chill that rapidly developed into pneumonia. He was soon followed by his two sons, one to World War One and the other to a mountaineering accident. The tragedies left scars on the family that were never to heal fully, but in their own way contributed to the burgeoning career of Isobel Wylie Hutchison, endowing her with the independent financial means to fund her expeditions and enabling her to defy convention, steadfastly refusing to marry and settle down. Isobel was awarded the Mungo Park Medal by the Royal Scottish Geographical Society, for whom she later acted as Vice President."]}]}}
