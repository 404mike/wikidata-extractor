No case was available \u2013 it was such a large instrument 17 1/8 inches \u2013 so my wife came to the rescue by wrapping it in her waterproof coat, and that is how it was taken across the English Channel.\" Tertis preferred a large viola to get an especially rich tone from his instrument. Knowing that some would find a 17-1/8-inch instrument too large he created his own Tertis model, which provides many of the tonal advantages of the larger instrument in a manageable 16-3/4-inch size. Tertis sold the 1717 Montegnana to his pupil Bernard Shore in 1937, who in turn passed it on to his pupil Roger Chase.
