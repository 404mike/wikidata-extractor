The siege ended with a British surrender on October 19, 1781; over 7,000 British soldiers were made prisoners of war, in the last major land battle of the American Revolutionary War. Washington negotiated the terms of surrender for two days, and the official signing ceremony took place on October 19; Cornwallis claimed illness and was absent, sending General Charles O'Hara as his proxy. As a gesture of goodwill, Washington held a dinner for the American, French, and British generals, all of whom fraternized on friendly terms and identified with one another as members of the same professional military caste."]}, {"page": "Ralph Abercromby", "response": ["After spending time with Dundas over Christmas, Abercromby was summoned to London 21 January 1800. The Portuguese, concerned that they were under threat from Spain, requested British support and wanted Abercromby to lead their army. However, Abercromby refused to serve under a foreign ruler and would only take command of a joint army. Before he could leave for Portugal to inspect their defences and army, the resignation of General Charles Stuart in the Mediterranean in April led to a change of plans. The Austrian plan was that Abercromby could create a distraction from the activities of General Michael von Melas in North Italy by landing at various points on the Italian coast. Abercromby received instruction from London to send 2,500\u20133,000 men to take French-occupied Malta. Thereafter, he was to receive a further 6,000 men to assist the Austrians. General Charles O'Hara in Gibraltar was pleased with the appointment, for while Stuart had been hot-tempered and difficult to work with, Abercromby was \"a reasonable, considerate good soldier, and listens with temper and patience to every proposal made to him\". However, delays caused by the weather meant that the situation in Italy had changed drastically by the time that Abercromby reached Minorca 22 June.Divall, General Sir Ralph Abercromby, 226\u2013230."]}, {"page": "The Patriot (2000 film)", "response": ["* Peter Woodward as Brigadier General Charles O'Hara  Cornwallis' second-in-command.

Yet he was still determined to pursue Greene into North Carolina and destroy Greene's army. According to Cornwallis, \"The loss of my light troops could only be remedied by the activity of the whole corps.\"  At Ramsour's Mill, Cornwallis burned his baggage train, except the wagons he needed to carry medical supplies, salt, ammunition, and the sick.  In the words of Charles O'Hara, \"In this situation, without Baggage, necessaries, or Provisions of any sort...it was resolved to follow Green's army to the end of the World.\"  As Cornwallis departed Ramsour's Mill on 28 January, Greene sought to reunite his command but ordered Edward Carrington to prepare for possible retreat across the Dan River into Virginia.  In Greene's words, \"It is necessary we should take every possible precaution. But I am not without hopes of ruining Lord Cornwallis, if he persists in his mad scheme of pushing through the Country...\"  On 3 February, Greene joined Daniel Morgan's Continentals at Trading Ford on the Yadkin River, and on 7 February, Lighthorse Harry Lee rendezvoused with the rebel army at Guilford Courthouse.  By 9 February, Greene commanded 2036 men, 1426 of whom were regular infantry, whereas Cornwallis had about 2440 men, 2000 of whom were regulars.  Now began the \"Race to the Dan\":  Greene's council of war recommended continuing the retreat, opting to fight at a future date and location.  By 14 February, Green's army was safely across the Dan after a retreat that was, according to Tarleton, \"judiciously designed and vigorously executed.\"  Cornwallis was now  from his supply base at Camden, South Carolina.  He established camp at Hillsborough and attempted to forage for supplies and recruit Tories. Though Greene's army enjoyed an abundance of food in Halifax County, Virginia, Cornwallis found a \"scarcity of provisions,\" resorted to plundering the farms of the local inhabitants, and lost men \"...in consequence of their Straggling out of Camp in search of whiskey.\" On 19 February, Greene sent Lee's Legion on a reconnaissance mission south across the Dan. By then, according to Buchanan, \"Buford's Massacre inflamed rebel passions. Pyle's Massacre devastated Tory morale.\"  On 22 February, Greene moved his army south across the Dan.  On 25 February, forced to abandon Hillsborough, Cornwallis moved his camp to the south of Alamance Creek between the Haw River and the Deep River.  Greene camped on the north side of the Creek, within  of Cornwallis's camp.  By 6 March, Cornwallis's men suffered from hunger.  His men plundered tory and rebel inhabitants, and desertions rose, forcing Cornwallis to seek a definitive battle with Greene.  Cornwallis had lost almost 400 men through disease, desertion or death, reducing his strength to about 2000 men.  On 10 March, Greene was joined by North Carolina militia, led by John Butler and Thomas Eaton, and Virginia militia, led by Robert Lawson.  On 12 March, Greene marched his army of about 4440, 1762 of whom were Continentals, to Guilford Courthouse. ", "On 15 March, Cornwallis's column appeared along the New Camden Road at 1:30 P.M, and Singleton commenced firing his two six-pounders, while John McLeod's Royal Artillery battery responded with three six-pounders.  According to Buchanan, Cornwallis, \"...did not know how many men Greene had. He was ignorant of the terrain too, he also lacked intelligence on Greene's dispositions.  Cornwallis \"...had marched hundreds of miles, had driven his army to rags and hunger...\" Cornwallis deployed the 33rd Foot and Royal Welsh Fusiliers on his left wing, led by James Webster, and supported by Charles O'Hara with his 2nd Guards Battalion, Grenadiers, and the J\u00e4gers. Cornwallis's right wing, led by Alexander Leslie, included the 2nd Battalion of Fraser's Highlanders and Hessian Regiment von Bose, supported by the 1st Guards Battalion.

Lincoln played a major role in the Siege of Yorktown and the surrender of Lord Cornwallis on October 19, 1781. Cornwallis plead illness, and so did not attend the surrender ceremony, choosing instead to send his second-in-command, the Irish General Charles O'Hara.

During the course of the battle, the Foot Guards were involved in a very bitter struggle with American Dragoons after being the subject of an attack by the Dragoons from the rear.

Brenton identified the ships as merchantmen, attempting to evade the British at Gibraltar in the bad weather. On Speedys approach, they scattered, four sheltering under a fort. Speedy approached and fired on them, causing their crews to abandon their ships. They were driven ashore by the wind, and despite sending boats out, it was impossible to get them off, so they were left to be reduced to wrecks. Three days later, Speedy was standing off Europa Point when twelve gunboats were sighted coming out of Algeciras to attack two merchant ships making their way past Gibraltar. One, the Unity, was carrying wine and spirits for the fleet. Their combined firepower far outweighed that of Speedy, but Brenton turned his ship towards them, covering the escape of one of the merchantmen with his fire. The gunboats were attempting to catch the Unity when Brenton took his ship through the flotilla, close enough to break many of their oars, maintaining a constant fire from his guns and with every spare member of the crew firing muskets. The Spanish flotilla broke and fled. Speedy suffered two men killed and one wounded, and sustained considerable damage to her rigging and below her waterline. She was unable to return to Gibraltar in the rising wind, and was forced to run along the coast to T\u00e9touan Bay, where her shot-holes were plugged to allow her to make her way back. During the engagement with the gunboats, the guns in the fortress of Gibraltar had not fired in support of Speedy. When Brenton asked why, the Governor of Gibraltar, General Charles O'Hara, replied that he had arranged with the Governor of Algeciras for the guns never to be fired at the gunboats so as not to annoy the inhabitants of the town."]}, {"page": "Jahleel Brenton", "response": ["On 6 November Speedy was standing off Europa Point while escorting a merchant vessel and a transport ship laden with wine for the British fleet when twelve Spanish gun boats raced out from Algeciras to launch an opportunistic attack.James, Vol II, pp. 395\u2013396. Although greatly outgunned, Brenton bore down on the enemy ships and opened fire, enabling the merchant ship to escape to safety. The gunboats then concentrated their efforts on capturing the transport ship. Brenton took Speedy amidst the flotilla, close enough to break several oars, while firing broadsides from both sides of the ship and maintaining a brisk musketry for around 45 minutes.
