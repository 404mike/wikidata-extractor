During the 1920s, the phrase came into regular use by lay commentators,e.g.: \"Sea Chanteys Kept Alive. Sailors' Club in London is Collecting and Preserving the Old Songs of Sail,\" New York Times (7 Nov. 1926); Thomas, J.E., Lucy E. Broadwood, Frank Howes, and Frank Kidson, \"Sea Shanties,\" Journal of the Folk-Song Society 8(32) (1928) pp. 96\u2013100. though it was not documented in use by sailors themselves, nor has it been used by knowledgeable authors on the subject such as Stan Hugill. The term \"sea shanty/chantey\" has become a staple of popular usage, where it helps to disambiguate the work song genre from other meanings of the word \"shanty\".", "Shanty-writer Stan Hugill called Mobile Bay\u2014one of the main cotton outports\u2014a \"shanty mart\", at which sailors and laborers of different cultural backgrounds traded their songs.Hugill, Shanties from the Seven Seas, p. 17.", "====Stan Hugill and Shanties from the Seven Seas====", "One of the most celebrated volumes on shanties produced in the 20th century is Stan Hugill's Shanties from the Seven Seas (1961).Hugill, Stan, Shanties from the Seven Seas: Shipboard Work-songs and Songs Used as Work-songs from the Great Days of Sail, Routledge & Kegan Paul (1961). It is the largest of its kind, owing to Hugill's methodology and chronological position. With respect to methodology, Hugill aimed to be as inclusive as possible\u2014to account for and to present, if sometimes only in fragments, any and all items of shanty repertoire that he was currently able to find. Any song that he had heard or read being attested as having been ever \"used as shanty\" was included\u2014regardless of whether that song was not generally known as a shanty or if its use as a shanty was rare and incidental. The result is a varied portrait of the genre, highlighting its maximum diversity without, however, giving a focused sense of what songs were most common during the heyday of shanties or in latter eras. Hugill readily included more recently popular songs\u2014those that evidently were not sung until after the shanty genre was experiencing decline, but which were extant when Hugill sailed (1920s\u201340s). He also culled from the major collections of non-English-language sailor work songs. Hugill's practice of liberally culling from all major prior works, in combination with original material from his own field experiences, makes it a handy sourcebook for performers, but a difficult work to assess in terms of historical accuracy.", "With respect to chronological position, while Hugill is affectionately known as \"The Last Shantyman,\" he was also one of the last original shanty collectors.Schreffler, Gibb, \"Confronting the Legacy of 'The Last Shantyman': New Media in an Auto-ethnography of Sea Shanty Performance,\" paper delivered at British Forum for Ethnomusicology Annual Conference, Liverpool, U.K. (April 2009). A few original collections followed, notably Roger Abrahams'Abrahams, Roger D., Deep The Water, Shallow the Shore, University of Texas Press (1974). and Horace Beck'sBeck, Horace, Folklore and the Sea,  Mystic Seaport Museum (1973). works on contemporary shantying in the Caribbean, yet most publications in the \"song collection\" genre are general anthologies based in Hugill and his predecessors' works. To a great extent, Shanties from the Seven Seas is considered the \"last word\" on shanties and the first stop as a reference. The book's \"authoritative\" position is bolstered by the personal image of its author. In contrast to many of the academic folklorists who had collected shanties before him, Hugill possessed the look and pedigree of an old-time sailor, and he was actually able to perform the songs from his collection at sea music festivals. Shanties from the Seven Seas and Stan Hugill's performances have had a tremendous bearing on how shanties have been understood and performed by enthusiasts since the second half of the 20th century up to today.", "The next revival in shanties occurred as part of the Anglophone folk music revival of the mid-20th century. The American folk revival group The Almanac Singers were recruited by Alan Lomax to record several shanties for the 1941 album Deep Sea Chanteys and Whaling Ballads.Carr, \"New Sea Chantey Compilations On Compact Disc.\" In Britain, the incorporation of shanties into the folk revival repertoire was largely led by A.L. Lloyd starting in the 1950s. An amateur folklorist, Lloyd discarded the earlier classical style of presentations in favor of a more \"authentic\" performance style. He was generally mysterious about the sources of his shanty arrangements; he obviously referred to collections by editors like Sharp, Colcord, and Doerflinger, however it is often unclear when and whether his versions were based in field experience or his private invention. Lloyd's album The Singing Sailor (1955)Lloyd, A.L. and Ewan MacColl, The Singing Sailor Topic LP (1955). with Ewan MacColl was an early milestone, which made an impression on Stan Hugill when he was preparing his 1961 collection,Hugill, Shanties from the Seven Seas, p. 36. particularly as the performance style it embodied was considered more appropriate than that of earlier commercial recordings. Many other performers followed, creating influential versions and interpretations of shanties that persist today. For example, Lloyd's personal interpretation of \"South Australia\" was taken up by the Irish folk revival group The Clancy Brothers, from which this version spread to countless folk performers to become established as the \"standard\" form of what is usually presented as a \"traditional\" shanty. Through the mass distribution of particular shanty forms through recordings and clubs, the folk revival has had the effect of creating an impression of rather consistent forms of texts and tunes\u2014a sharp contrast to the highly variable and often improvised nature of work-based shanty singing. Another effect, due to the fact that most folk performers sang shanties along with other genres, is that shanty repertoire was ever more incorporated within the generic fold of \"folk song,\" and their distinctive use, manner of performance, and identity were co-opted.", "With one foot firmly planted in the world of traditional shanties, the veteran sailor and author Stan Hugill also became a leader (and follower) of trends in the folk music revival. His presence as an exclusive performer of sailor songs did much to establish sea music as a revival genre apart from or within folk music.Frank, Stuart M., \"Stan Hugill 1906\u20131992: A Remembrance,\" in Stan Hugill, Shanties From the Seven Seas, abridged edition, Mystic Seaport (1994) p. xx.  By the late 1970s, the activities of enthusiasts and scholar-performers at places like the Mystic Seaport Museum (who initiated an annual Sea Music Festival in 1979) and the San Francisco Maritime Museum established sea music\u2014inclusive of shanties, sea songs, and other maritime music\u2014as a genre with its own circuit of festivals, record labels, performance protocol, and so on.", "*\"Shanties from the Seven Seas\" project on YouTube contains sample performances of the over 400 shanties and sea songs included in Stan Hugill's largest print collection of the same name."]}, {"page": "Aberdyfi", "response": ["* Stan Hugill (1906\u20131992), Musician and artist, lived in Aberdyfi, and worked at the Outward Bound centre from 1950 to 1975"]}, {"page": "English folk music (1900\u20131949)", "response": ["* Stan Hugill (1906\u20131992)"]}, {"page": "English folk music (1990\u20131999)", "response": ["* Stan Hugill (1906\u20131992)"]}, {"page": "Tom Lewis (songwriter)", "response": ["In 2000, he won the Stan Hugill International Trophy when the competition was held in Douarnenez, France."]}, {"page": "Drunken Sailor", "response": ["The opera singer Leonard Warren recorded the song in July 1947 with the  pronunciation.
