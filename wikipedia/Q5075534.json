As early as 1906 Charles Benjamin Redrup had demonstrated to the Royal Flying Corps at Hendon a 'Reactionless' engine in which the crankshaft rotated in one direction and the cylinder block in the opposite direction, each one driving a propeller. A later development of this was the 1914 reactionless 'Hart' engine designed by Redrup in which there was only one propeller connected to the crankshaft, but it rotated in the opposite direction to the cylinder block, thereby largely cancelling out negative effects. This proved too complicated for reliable operation and Redrup changed the design to a static radial engine, which was later tried in the experimental Vickers F.B.12b and F.B.16 aircraft, unfortunately without success."]}, {"page": "Axial engine", "response": ["The Bristol Axial Engine of the mid-1930s was designed by Charles Benjamin Redrup for the Bristol Tramways and Carriage Company; it was a 7-litre, 9-cylinder, wobble-plate type engine. It was originally conceived as a power unit for buses, possibly because its compact format would allow it to be installed beneath the vehicle's floor. The engine had a single rotary valve to control induction and exhaust. Several variants were used in Bristol buses during the late 1930s, the engine going through several versions from RR1 to RR4, which had a power output of 145\u00a0hp at 2900\u00a0rpm. Development was halted in 1936 following a change of management at the Bristol company."]}, {"page": "1878 in Wales", "response": ["*28 October \u2013 Charles Benjamin Redrup, aeronautical engineer (died 1961)"]}, {"page": "Barry Engine", "response": ["The Barry Engine first appeared in 1904 when it was exhibited at the Stanley Exhibition in London's Burners Hall. Designed by Charles Benjamin Redrup and manufactured in partnership with Alban Williams by the Barry Motor Company, the engine was a two-cylinder supercharged rotary engine. The prototype motorcycle retained the pedals of a conventional cycle and the engine rotated on the pedal shaft between the driver's knees. The driver was protected by a colander-type perforated cage which enabled cooling air to reach the cylinders."]}]}}
