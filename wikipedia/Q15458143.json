S. Lewis met in 1919 as students at Oxford University and were close friends for 44 years. \"It is no exaggeration to say that his friendship with Barfield was one of the most important in his [Lewis's] life\u2026\" The friendship was reciprocal.  Almost a year after Lewis's death, Barfield spoke of his friendship in a talk in the USA: \"Now, whatever he was, and as you know, he was a great many things, CS Lewis was for me, first and foremost, the absolutely unforgettable friend, the friend with whom I was in close touch for over 40 years, the friend you might come to regard hardly as another human being, but almost as a part of the furniture of my existence.\u201dColin Duriez (2013) C.  S.  Lewis: A Biography of Friendship. Lion Books. p 88 When they met, Lewis was an atheist who told Barfield, \"I don\u2019t accept God!\"Duriez, op. cit. Barfield was influential in converting Lewis. Lewis came to see that there were two kinds of friends, a first friend with whom you feel at home and agree (Lewis's close friend Arthur Greeves was an example of this) and a second friend who brings to you a different point of view.The ecclesiastic Ronald Knox was another such friend, see Milton Walsh, Second Friends: C.S. Lewis and Ronald Knox in Conversation. San Francisco: Ignatius Press, 2008. 360 pp. . He found Barfield's contribution in this way particularly helpful despite, or because of, the fact that \"during the 1920s, the two were to engage in a long dispute over Barfield's (and their mutual friend, A.C. Harwood's) connection to anthroposophy and the kind of knowledge that imagination can give us\u2026 which they affectionately called 'The Great War'.Colin Duriez (2013) C.  S.  Lewis: A Biography of Friendship. Lion Books. pp 87\u201388. Through their conversations, Lewis gave up materialist realism \u2013 the idea that our sensible world is self-explanatory and is all that there is \u2013 and moved closer to what he had always disparagingly referred to as \u201csupernaturalism.\u201dBremer, J.

The book was written by presuppositionalist theologian Francis A. Schaeffer and first published in 1976. The book served as the basis for a series of ten films. Schaeffer narrated and appeared throughout the film series, which was produced by his son Frank Schaeffer and directed by John Gonser.Colin Duriez (2008).  Francis Schaeffer - An Authentic Life, page 184. InterVarsity Press In the film series, Schaeffer attacked the influences of the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, and Charles Darwin. The films were credited with inspiring a number of leaders of the American conservative evangelical movement, including Jerry Falwell.

Clark's Civilization, Bronowski's The Ascent of Man, Carl Sagan's Cosmos \u2013 they all say it. There is only one final view of reality that's possible and that is that the final reality is material or energy shaped by pure chance.

In an initial speaking tour of eighteen cities in 1977, there was an enthusiastic response to the screening of the ten half-hour episodes... The film series was also shown around Europe, including local screenings set up by churches and Christian groups in the United Kingdom... The prospect of a large screen presentation perhaps removed peoples fears of being lost, as when hearing or reading Schaeffer undiluted. The seminar pattern, with a lecture by Francis and a showing of an episode followed by his taking questions from the audience, anticipated the more controversial series Whatever Happened to the Human Race? which, however, had smaller audiences.\"Duriez.

Tolkien's influences", "response": ["Tolkien was a core member of the Inklings, an informal literary discussion group associated with the University of Oxford between the early 1930s and late 1949. The group shared in Colin Duriez's words \"a guiding vision of the relationship of imagination and myth to reality and of a Christian worldview in which a pagan spirituality is seen as prefiguring the advent of Christ and the Christian story.\" Shippey adds that the group was \"preoccupied\" with \"virtuous pagans\", and that The Lord of the Rings is plainly a tale of such people in the dark past before Christian revelation. He further writes that what Tolkien called the Northern theory of courage, namely that even total defeat does not make what is right wrong, was \"a vital belief\" shared by Tolkien and other Inklings. The group considered philosophical issues, too, which found their way into Tolkien's writings, among them the ancient debate within Christianity on the nature of evil. Shippey notes Elrond's Boethian statement that \"nothing is evil in the beginning. Even [the Dark Lord] Sauron was not so\",The Fellowship of the Ring, \"The Council of Elrond\" in other words all things were created good; but that the Inklings, as evidenced by C. S. Lewis's Mere Christianity, book 2, section 2, to some extent tolerated the Manichean view that Good and Evil are equally powerful, and battle it out in the world. Shippey writes that Tolkien's Ringwraiths embody an Inkling and Boethian idea found in Lewis and Charles Williams, that of things being bent out of shape, the word wraith suggesting \"writhe\" and \"wrath\", glossed as \"a twisted emotion\"; even the world became bent, so men could no longer sail the old straight road westwards to the Undying Lands. All the same, Shippey writes, Tolkien's personal war experience was Manichean: evil seemed at least as powerful as good, and could easily have been victorious, a strand which can also be seen in Middle-earth. At a personal level, Lewis's friendship greatly encouraged Tolkien to keep going with The Lord of the Rings; he wrote that without Lewis \"I should never have brought The L. of the R. to a conclusion.\""]}, {"page": "C.

Colin Duriez, author of three books on Lewis, suggests that Lewis believed that to reach a post-Christian culture one needed to employ pre-Christian ideas.Lewis, the Sneaky Pagan  ChristianityToday, 1 June 2004 Lewis disliked modernity, which he regarded as mechanized and sterile and cut off from natural ties to the world. By comparison, he had hardly any reservations about pre-Christian pagan culture. As Christian critics have pointed out, Lewis disdained the non-religious agnostic character of modernity, but not the polytheistic character of pagan religion.See essay \"Is Theism Important?\" in God in the Dock by C.S.Lewis edited by Walter Hooper", "J. R. R. Tolkien was a close friend of Lewis, a fellow author and was instrumental in Lewis' own conversion to Christianity.Carpenter, The Inklings, p.42-45. See also Lewis' own autobiography Surprised by Joy As members of the Inklings literary group the two often read and critiqued drafts of their work. Nonetheless, Tolkien was not enthusiastic about the Narnia stories, in part due to the eclectic elements of the mythology and their haphazard incorporation, in part because he disapproved of stories involving travel between real and imaginary worlds.See Jack: A Life of C. S. Lewis by George Sayer, Lyle W. Dorsett p. 312-313 Though a Catholic himself, Tolkien felt that fantasy should incorporate Christian values without resorting to the obvious allegory Lewis employed.On eclecticism, see Tolkien and C.S. Lewis: The Gift of Friendship by Colin Duriez, p. 131; also The Inklings by Humphrey Carpenter, p. 224. On allegory, see Diana Glyer, The Company They Keep, p. 84, and Harold Bloom's edited anthology The Chronicles of Narnia, p. 140.

Birzer, in The J. R. R. Tolkien Encyclopedia, calls Secret Fire \"the best of the post-Pearce Christian works\" on Tolkien. Mike Foster, in Tolkien Studies, writes that \"this self-described search for 'Tolkien's secret fire' finds it in the author's devout Catholicism\". He finds Caldecott's blending of criticism and Catholicism problematic, as \"the reader perforce has two subjects to weigh and balance: literary scholarship and theological interpretation\". Among other things, Foster notes that Frodo \"fails his last temptation\", as it is Gollum's action that destroys the Ring; he finds Caldecott's interpretation, that \"in the end it is not Frodo who saves Middle-earth at all ... nor Gollum, who took the Ring into the Fire. It can only be God himself, ... using even our mistakes and the designs of the Enemy ... to bring about our good\". Foster calls this \"simply too forgiving of Frodo, whose will fails him\". Colin Duriez, reviewing the book for Theology, calls it a \"perceptive and well-reasoned book\" that examines Tolkien's appeal to people \"from Christian to neo-pagan\". Among these reasons, writes Duriez, is the rooting of his writing in the First World War, and Tolkien's experience of loss and death; and \"his love affair with language\". Duriez remarks, too, on Caldecott's account of Tolkien's \"veneration of Mary\" and its impact on the Elf-lady Galadriel and \"the angelic Elbereth\"."]}]}}
