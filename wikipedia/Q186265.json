Among the greatest of the Victorian art-architects, he sought in his work to escape from both nineteenth-century industrialisation and the Neoclassical architectural style and re-establish the architectural and social values of a utopian medieval England. Burges stands within the tradition of the Gothic Revival, his works echoing those of the Pre-Raphaelites and heralding those of the Arts and Crafts movement.\nBurges's career was short but illustrious; he won his first major commission for Saint Fin Barre's Cathedral in Cork in 1863, when he was 35, and he died, in 1881, at his Kensington home, The Tower House, aged only 53. His architectural output was small but varied. Working with a long-standing team of craftsmen, he built churches, a cathedral, a warehouse, a university, a school, houses and castles.\nBurges's most notable works are Cardiff Castle, constructed between 1866 and 1928, and Castell Coch (1872\u201391), both of which were built for John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute. Other significant buildings include Gayhurst House, Buckinghamshire (1858\u201365), Knightshayes Court (1867\u201374), the Church of Christ the Consoler (1870\u201376), St Mary's, Studley Royal (1870\u201378), in Yorkshire, and Park House, Cardiff (1871\u201380).\nMany of his designs were never executed or were subsequently demolished or altered. His competition entries for cathedrals at Lille (1854), Adelaide (1856), Colombo, Brisbane (1859), Edinburgh (1873), and Truro (1878) were all unsuccessful. He lost out to George Edmund Street in the competition for the Royal Courts of Justice (1866\u201367) in The Strand. His plans for the redecoration of the interior of St Paul's Cathedral (1870\u201377) were abandoned and he was dismissed from his post. Skilbeck's Warehouse (1865\u201366) was demolished in the 1970s, and work at Salisbury Cathedral (1855\u201359), at Worcester College, Oxford (1873\u201379), and at Knightshayes Court had been lost in the decades before.\nBeyond architecture, Burges designed metalwork, sculpture, jewellery, furniture and stained glass. Art Applied to Industry, a series of lectures he gave to the Society of Arts in 1864, illustrates the breadth of his interests; the topics covered including glass, pottery, brass and iron, gold and silver, furniture, the weaver's art and external architectural decoration. For most of the century following his death, Victorian architecture was neither the subject of intensive study nor sympathetic attention and Burges's work was largely ignored. The revival of interest in Victorian art, architecture, and design in the later twentieth century led to a renewed appreciation of Burges and his work.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 20", "response": ["*1881 \u2013 William Burges, English architect and designer (b. 1827)"]}, {"page": "British Museum", "response": ["The William Burges collection of armoury was bequeathed to the museum in 1881.

Only one section of the proposed campus plan \u2014 the Long Walk\u2014 was completed.", "The first buildings completed on the current campus were Seabury and Jarvis halls in 1878. Together with Northam Towers, these make up what is known as the \"Long Walk\". These buildings are an early example of Collegiate Gothic architecture in the United States, built to plans drawn up by William Burges, with F.H. Kimball as supervising architect.  The Long Walk has been expanded and is connected with several other buildings.  On the northernmost end there is the chapel, whose western side is connected to the Downes and Williams Memorial building. Heading south, the next building is Jarvis Hall, named after Abraham Jarvis.  Jarvis becomes Northam Towers heading south, then Seabury Hall.  Seabury Hall, named for Samuel Seabury, is connected to Hamlin Hall.  To Hamlin's east is Cook, then Goodwin and then Woodward.  The dormitories on the Long Walk end there, and the terminal building on the south end of the long walk is Clement/Cinestudio.  Clement is the chemistry building; Cinestudio a student run movie theater. If one travels to the south of Hamlin there will be Mather Hall and the Dean of Students Office. "]}]}}
