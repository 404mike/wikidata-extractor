Three members of the Brussels Swimming and Water Polo Club, Georges Romas, Guillaume S\u00e9ron, and A. R. Upton, are also left off of some lists despite evidence that they participated in the first round. The roster for the Osborne Swimming Club of Manchester as listed by the International Olympic Committee is Thomas Coe, John Henry Derbyshire, Peter Kemp, William Lister, Arthur G. Robertson, Eric Robinson, and George Wilkinson. Lister, however, had died two weeks prior to the Games, while Derbyshire, Robinson, and Wilkinson all played water polo matches in England either during the tournament or too soon after it to have traveled back from Paris in time. A list of players contemporary to the match does not include Robertson, but does list Coe and Kemp in addition to Robert Crawshaw, William Henry, John Arthur Jarvis, Victor Lindberg, and Frederick Stapleton. Lindberg has been considered the first New Zealand Olympian, although he \"was born in Fiji to Swedish and Irish parents, lived in New Zealand from a young age and, in Paris, represented a British club.\""]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 1900 Summer Olympics", "response": ["|align=left| Robert Crawshaw ||rowspan=3| Men's 200 metre freestyle || 2:40.0 || 2 q || 2:45.6 || 4", "|align=left| Robert Crawshaw || 3:15.0 || 2 q ||  || 9"]}, {"page": "Swimming at the 1900 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 200 metre backstroke", "response": ["Before the Games, Great Britain's Robert Crawshaw was described in the The New York Herald Tribune as the \"champion breast and back swimmer of the world\"."]}, {"page": "Mixed teams at the Olympics", "response": ["Robert Crawshaw,"]}, {"page": "List of Olympic medalists in water polo (men)", "response": ["|rowspan=2 valign=top| (Osborne Swimming Club of Manchester)Thomas CoeRobert CrawshawWilliam HenryJohn Arthur JarvisPeter KempVictor Lindberg (NZL)Frederick Stapleton"]}, {"page": "Mixed team at the 1900 Summer Olympics", "response": ["Robert Crawshaw", "|Robert Crawshaw"]}, {"page": "Crawshaw", "response": ["* Robert Crawshaw (1869\u20131952), British water polo player and swimmer "]}, {"page": "List of 1900 Summer Olympics medal winners", "response": ["|rowspan=2 valign=top| (Osborne Swimming Club of Manchester)Thomas CoeRobert CrawshawWilliam HenryJohn Arthur JarvisPeter KempVictor Lindberg (NZL)Frederick Stapleton"]}, {"page": "Crawshaw, Robert", "response": ["#redirectRobert Crawshaw"]}, {"page": "List of Olympic champions in men's water polo", "response": ["| P2 || style=\"text-align: left;\" data-sort-value=\"Crawshaw, Robert\" | Robert Crawshaw || FP || style=\"text-align: left;\" | || style=\"text-align: right;\" | || style=\"text-align: right;\" |  || style=\"text-align: left;\" |  || Yes || "]}]}}
