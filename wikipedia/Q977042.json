She made her London debut in 1883.  She played many Shakespearean roles, but is best known as a pioneer of major roles in the works of Ibsen and George Bernard Shaw. Her most notable role was as Nora in the first English production of A Doll's House (1889). She was married to actor Charles Charrington.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "A Doll's House", "response": ["Before 1899 there were two private productions of the play in London (in its original form as Ibsen wrote it)  \u2014 one featured George Bernard Shaw in the role of Krogstad. The first public British production of the play in its regular form opened on 7 June 1889 at the Novelty Theatre, starring Janet Achurch as Nora and Charles Charrington as Torvald. Achurch played Nora again for a 7-day run in 1897.

The Theatre Royal was built in 1787, burned down in 1829 and was remodelled in 1879 giving Margate more national publicity. The exterior is largely from the 19th century. From 1885 to 1899 actor-manager Sarah Thorne ran a school for acting at the Theatre Royal which is widely regarded as Britain's first formal drama school. Actors who received their initial theatrical training there include Harley Granville-Barker, Evelyn Millard, Louis Calvert, George Thorne, Janet Achurch, Adelaide Neilson and Irene and Violet Vanbrugh, among others.

It being hopeless to get me to read anything, she told me the story... In the following autumn I was the guest of a lady [Beatrice Webb] of very distinguished ability\u2014one whose knowledge of English social types is as remarkable as her command of industrial and political questions. She suggested that I should put on the stage a real modern lady of the governing class\u2014not the sort of thing that theatrical and critical authorities imagine such a lady to be. I did so; and the result was Miss Vivie Warren ... Mrs. Warren herself was my version of the heroine of the romance narrated by Miss Achurch. The tremendously effective scene\u2014which a baby could write if its sight were normal\u2014in which she justifies herself, is only a paraphrase of a scene in a novel of my own, Cashel Byron's Profession (hence the title, Mrs Warren's Profession), in which a prize-fighter shows how he was driven into the ring exactly as Mrs. Warren was driven on the streets."]}, {"page": "List of women who died in childbirth", "response": ["*the biological mother of Janet Achurch (1864)"]}, {"page": "Masks or Faces", "response": ["Some actors did help.
