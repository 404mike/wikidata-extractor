He was active in the British desert camouflage unit in the Second World War, and was responsible for the dummy railhead at Misheifa and for the effective camouflage and large-scale military deception in the defence of Tobruk in 1942.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Camouflage", "response": ["As in the First World War, artists were pressed into service; for example, the surrealist painter Roland Penrose became a lecturer at the newly founded Camouflage Development and Training Centre at Farnham Castle, writing the practical Home Guard Manual of Camouflage. The film-maker Geoffrey Barkas ran the Middle East Command Camouflage Directorate during the 1941\u20131942 war in the Western Desert, including the successful deception of Operation Bertram. Hugh Cott was chief instructor; the artist camouflage officers, who called themselves camoufleurs, included Steven Sykes and Tony Ayrton. In Australia, artists were also prominent in the Sydney Camouflage Group, formed under the chairmanship of Professor William John Dakin, a zoologist from Sydney University. Max Dupain, Sydney Ure Smith, and William Dobell were among the members of the group, which worked at Bankstown Airport, RAAF Base Richmond and Garden Island Dockyard. In the United States, artists like John Vassos took a certificate course in military and industrial camouflage at the American School of Design with Baron Nicholas Cerkasoff, and went on to create camouflage for the Air Force."]}, {"page": "Coventry Cathedral", "response": ["File:Coventry Cathedral -interior2.jpg|Chapel of Christ in Gethsemane, mosaic by Steven Sykes"]}, {"page": "Retford", "response": ["As the Catholic community continued to expand it was decided to build a bigger church and land was purchased on the Babworth Road. The present Catholic church - St Joseph's - opened in 1959 and was designed by Ernest Bower Norris in modern Romanesque design, incorporating Art Deco elements. The church was later reordered in 1968 by renowned Modernist architect Gerard Goalen, at which time a large sculpture by Steven Sykes was introduced. St Joseph's is prominently located on Babworth Road and its campanile serves as a local landmark. In its Conservation Plan, Bassetlaw Council says: \"The bell tower with copper roof is one of the most prominent architectural features within the entire Conservation Area.\" Next to the church is St Joseph's Catholic Primary School."]}, {"page": "Operation Bertram", "response": ["Richardson asked if they could use something like Steven Sykes's dummy railhead which had worked so well at Misheifa.Sykes, 1990. pp41\u201353.

The intent, which succeeded, was to divert German aerial attacks from the real railhead and deceive the Germans into believing that the British attack would not begin until the dummy was completed. Before the Second Battle of El Alamein, camouflage unit commander Geoffrey Barkas led Operation Sentinel and Operation Bertram, which used dummy equipment and other deceptive measures to deceive German commander Erwin Rommel about Allied strength and the timing and location of the Allied attack.Stroud, 2012. pp. 183\u2013208."]}, {"page": "Liturgical Movement", "response": ["An example of reordering is St Joseph's church in Retford, which was designed by Ernest Bower Norris in modern Romanesque design, incorporating Art Deco elements. It opened in 1959 and in 1968 was re-ordered by Goalen to comply with the recommendations of Vatican II. During the re-order, Goalen commissioned a large Christus Resurrexit for the sanctuary wall by Steven Sykes.", "The Catholic church became a major patron of modern architecture and art during the 1950s and 60s in the UK. A group of modernist architects including Gillespie, Kidd & Coia, Gerard Goalen, Francis Pollen, Desmond Williams and Austin Winkley utilised contemporary design and construction methods to deliver the \u2018noble simplicity\u2019 instructed by Vatican I, literally to express the values of the Liturgical Movement in buildings. Desmond Williams noted that his St Mary Dunstable church was: \"circular, with the object being to bring as many of the congregation near the altar, and proved very popular in attracting worshippers.\" Architects in this movement also collaborated with notable ceramic and glass artists such as Dom Charles Norris and Steven Sykes (artist).
