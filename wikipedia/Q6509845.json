A second soon after was deflected by Notts County's goalkeeper Carly Telford. The resulting corner setup Gemma Davison for a shot which went wide. In the 37th minute, Aluko found centre forward Ji So-yun inside the box and set her up for a short range goal. Notts County came back on the attack after the half. A long-range shot from midfielder Desiree Scott was deflected and a header by Leanne Crichton in the resulting corner was narrowly cleared off the line. Chelsea hunted for a second goal but Aluko had another shot deflected while midfielder Drew Spence sent a shot wide. In the end So-yun's lone goal proved enough and Chelsea won 1\u20130.", "|RM ||18|| Leanne Crichton || "]}]}}
