He was also a contributor to the cult black music magazine Soul Underground between 1988 and 1990.\nHis show on Kiss 100, The Cosmic Jam from 0100 to 0300 on Sunday nights, used to dovetail with his old colleague Gilles Peterson, who was on BBC Radio 1 from 2300 to 0100. However, Peterson's show has since moved back to its original slot on a Wednesday night, but at a later time, from 0200 to 0400. \"The Cosmic Jam\" was a two-hour show broadcast on Sunday nights on Mi-Soul.  As of 2019, Forge has a monthly show on NTS radio which is of a similar format to \"The Cosmic Jam\".\nThe two DJs play similar styles of music, have played at numerous clubs and also music weekenders. If anything Forge strays more into Latin Jazz styles more than Gilles, but has also been known to drop tracks from Crosby Stills and Nash, Pentangle, America and Ellen McIlwaine.\nHe is also a member of Brazilian influenced group Da Lata and has worked with or in collaboration with numerous other groups, including Batu, a group from the early to mid 1990s that also featured Da Lata members Christian Franck, Lillian Chachian and contributors such as Oli Savill, among others.  One of Forge's most well known spots is \"Brazilian Love Affair\" as well as \"Sunday Afternoon at Dingwalls\", in which Forge on his own, or in collaboration with other DJs perform live sets.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gilles Peterson", "response": ["Upon leaving BBC London in 1987, Peterson took up a new Sunday afternoon residency at Dingwalls in Camden. It was around the same time that he'd started BGP Records, a sub-label of Ace Records focused on soul, funk and jazz dance, together with DJ Baz Fe Jazz. Playing alongside fellow London DJ Patrick Forge, the night, dubbed Talkin' Loud And Sayin' Something, ran for five years. It coincided with the rise of acid house in UK clubland and would grow to establish itself as a legendary session. The sessions were characterised by jazz dancers in suits, hats and spats, well-known jazz dance classics including tracks from Yusef Lateef, Pharoah Sanders, Freddie Hubbard, Airto, Herbie Hancock, and the anthemic In The Fast Lane by Jean-Luc Ponty; but the jazz was fused with hip-hop and the more experimental tracks. It was at a Special Branch show, with fellow DJ Chris Bangs, that the term \"acid jazz\" was coined, starting as an in-joke. At the time, acid house was in the ascendant, and at one of the shows Bangs played a rare groove record, grabbed the mic and shouted: \"Fuck that, if that was acid house, this is acid jazz!\u201d. In 1988, Peterson and Eddie Piller founded Acid Jazz Records, a label whose roster included the Brand New Heavies, Jamiroquai, Corduroy, the James Taylor Quartet and Snowboy.", "* Gilles Peterson & Patrick Forge Present \u2013 Sunday Afternoon at Dingwalls Ether 2006"]}, {"page": "Homelands (festival)", "response": [":Patrick Forge"]}, {"page": "Kiss (UK radio station)", "response": ["From 1985, DJs and presenters have included: Norman Jay, Coldcut (Matt Black & Jonathan More), Paul Trouble Anderson, Colin Dale, Colin Faver, Judge Jules, Tim Westwood, Lindsay Wesker, Max LX & Dave VJ, Jazzie B, Steve Jackson, Trevor Nelson, Lisa l'Anson, Danny Rampling and Richie Rich.

In 1998, he released a second single, \"Fingerprints Of The Gods\", which was the only British track to feature in the Hip Hop Connection's top ten tracks of the year and which The Independent called \"impressive\". Speaking to The Independent at the time, he remarked how the genre was entering a new era and how the quality of British Hip Hop in general was improving.

As the garage scene waned the label diversified and changed their roster becoming a nu-jazz down tempo entity. Greasy Geezers adapted to the new market with releases by neo-soul and Latin house acts such as the Wah Wah Collective and Gafanhoto Lingo. The soulful diversification proved successful and the Wah Wah Collective gained notoriety in leading UK soul magazines with releases on playlists at Kiss FM (Patrick Forge), BBC Radio 1 (Giles Peterson), Smooth FM (Rosie Kendrick) and in the US with Rafe Gomez, dj/host of the nationally syndicated jazz mix show \"The Groove Boutique\"."]}]}}
