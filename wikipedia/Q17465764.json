He was picked up by Notts County when his RAF Syerston side played them in a friendly. After he was de-mobbed from his national service on 15 March 1953, he was signed up by the Magpies. He also played non-league football for clubs including Washington and Ashington.In an autobiographical article written by Bobby Bulch himself it is written: \n\"Sport has always been my main interest. Football, Golfing (9 handicap) and Snooker. Football, but only as a viewer in recent years. Golf is still an interest even after having held a 9 handicap for nearly twenty years, snooker in recent times because it was a far less strenuous activity. I also enjoy gardening, fitting the necessary housework in between, as my wife still works for a living, and of course watching T.V. with my grandchildren\".\nBobby's family later made this article freely available to the people of Washington and was reproduced verbatim.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Deaths in May 2012", "response": ["*Bobby Bulch, 79, English footballer."]}, {"page": "Robert Bulch", "response": ["#REDIRECT Bobby Bulch"]}]}}
