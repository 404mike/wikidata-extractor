This earned him a place in the starting eleven for the next few matches, but he failed to score and lost his place. In the second half of the season he scored once from three starts and one substitute appearance, and returned to the Fourth Division with Hereford United for 1991\u201392. He was reportedly disappointed at being given insufficient opportunity to succeed at the higher level."]}]}}
