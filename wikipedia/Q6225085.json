He helped establish and command several military training establishments in Britain, was involved in large-scale military planning during 1918 and 1919 and was pivotal in establishing the tank as an important feature of the British Army. Although Capper was sometimes described as pompous and possessing poor communication skills, earning the nickname Stone Age for his attitude towards the ideas of junior officers in the Royal Tank Corps, he nevertheless played a vital role in the development and deployment of armoured vehicles in the British Army.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wright brothers", "response": ["In October\u00a01904, the brothers were visited by the first of many important Europeans they would befriend in coming years, Colonel J.E.
