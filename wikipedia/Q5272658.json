This adds to the affection the support from the time had for him. Bonnar moved to Dumbarton in 1958 - he had lost his place in the first team to Dick Beattie three years earlier and had made only sporadic appearances thereafter. After his spell at Dumbarton, Bonnar left the game to concentrate on business interests. However, St Johnstone managed to entice him back, where he helped the club win promotion for the first time. Bonnar was also one of the founders of the Celtic's original development fund during the 1960s and was in charge of organising the Fund during that period."]}, {"page": "1956 Scottish League Cup Final", "response": ["|GK ||||Dick Beattie", "|GK ||||Dick Beattie"]}, {"page": "Duntocher Hibernian F.C.", "response": ["*Dick Beattie\u00a0\u2013 Celtic goalkeeper in the 1957 Scottish League Cup Final, later to receive a lifetime ban from the game for involvement in the British betting scandal of 1964."]}, {"page": "1956 Scottish Cup Final", "response": ["|GK || Dick Beattie"]}, {"page": "Template talk:Match fixing in association football", "response": ["The article name for the 1964 scandal is 1964 British football match-fixing scandal and it mentions that one of the convicted players was Dick Beattie who played for the Scottish club St Mirren F.C. at the time. He had earlier played for English clubs earlier in the 1960s, but the article is not clear as to whether his conviction related to offences in Scotland or his time in England. If the latter then the 1964 England descriptor would be fair, but if it related to matches in Scotland, then 1964 Britain would be more appropriate. A bit of online research would seem to suggest that the specific charges related to his time in the English leagues, but if anyone could clarify this, it would be helpful. It might also be worth considering renaming the 1964 British football match-fixing scandal if it did just involve matches in England. Dunarc (talk) 20:47, 28 May 2020 (UTC)"]}]}}
