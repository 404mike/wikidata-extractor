In the run-up to Wimbledon 2006, she played two WTA tournaments courtesy of wildcards. She lost in the first round of the Birmingham Classic (Tier III) to fellow wildcard Sarah Borwell in three sets, and also lost in the first round of qualifying for the Tier-II tournament in Eastbourne. In June, South played for the first time in the Wimbledon main draw as a wildcard and reached the second round by beating No. 11 seed, Francesca Schiavone, in the first round. She lost to Shenay Perry in the second round. South's win over world No. 14 Schiavone was a career-first top-20 victory, and the best win in terms of ranking for a British player since Sam Smith beat No. 7, Conchita Mart\u00ednez, at Wimbledon in 1998. After Wimbledon, South won another ITF tournament, reached three semifinals and two more quarterfinals. She participated in the qualifying tournament for the US Open in September but did not progress further than the first round. Her year-end ranking was world No. 176."]}]}}
