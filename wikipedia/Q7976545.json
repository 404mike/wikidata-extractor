Newcastle manager Bobby Robson later wrote that Bellamy was \"a great player wrapped round an unusual and volatile character\". Bellamy's Newcastle debut came in the UEFA Intertoto Cup, with the club drawn against Belgian side Lokeren. In the first leg, Newcastle secured a 4\u20130 victory, in which Bellamy assisted Wayne Quinn and Shola Ameobi before scoring his first goal for the club in the second leg. Bellamy scored his first Premier League goal for Newcastle in a 1\u20131 draw against local rivals Sunderland at St James' Park on 28 August 2001. Two weeks later, he scored a hat-trick in a 4\u20131 victory over Brentford in the League Cup, scoring all three goals within 12 minutes. Newcastle enjoyed a positive start to the season and moved into first place on 18 December 2001 after a 3\u20131 win over Arsenal. Bellamy was shown a straight red card in the match after being adjudged to have swung an arm at Ashley Cole, although the decision was overturned on appeal. Under Robson, Bellamy formed a productive strike partnership with Alan Shearer; the pair scored 41 goals between them during his first year. Bellamy remarked that his pace and creativity complemented Shearer's game."]}, {"page": "Aaron Hughes", "response": ["Before the 2001\u201302 season, Hughes featured as Newcastle reached the final of that summer's UEFA Intertoto Cup.

In the second leg of the final on 21 August, he scored a last-minute equaliser for a 4\u20134 draw against Troyes, but his team lost on the away goals rule. On 27 January 2002, he confirmed a 4\u20132 win at Peterborough United in the fourth round of the FA Cup, again heading in a cross from Quinn.

The squad was bolstered with a contingent of loan signings such as Wayne Quinn, Neil Mellor, Matthew Kilgallon, Niclas Alexandersson, Robbie Stockdale and Jon Harley.
