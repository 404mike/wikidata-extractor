His attack on a clause of the Finance Act 1930 drew much praise from both Liberal and Conservative politicians, including Winston Churchill, who said that \"I have rarely heard a speech more precisely directed at the object under debate, more harmoniously attuned to the character of Committee discussion, than the excellent statement the Honourable and learned Gentleman has just made\". Birkett led the Liberal response to the Labour proposal of the Trade Disputes Bill 1931 and \"reduced it to tatters\", although the Bill passed because of some Liberal abstentions.Hyde (1965) p. 324. The speech was a particularly well-received one and led MacDonald to again offer the position of Solicitor General to Birkett, as the incumbent postholder James Melville was about to resign.Hyde (1965) p. 325. Again Birkett refused, and Stafford Cripps was appointed. When the Liberal Party returned to power in 1931 in coalition with the Conservatives and National Labour as part of MacDonald's National Government, it was expected that Birkett would be offered the position being a Liberal Member of Parliament, but by the time they proposed candidates for Solicitor General, the Liberals had exceeded their ministerial quota agreed to in the coalition.Hyde (1965) p. 326.

Birkett was forced to retract. He argued instead that the book was tasteful and possessed a high degree of literary merit.Souhami, 216, 225\u2013226. James Melville, appearing for Leopold Hill, took a similar line: the book was \"written in a reverend spirit\", not to inspire libidinous thoughts but to examine a social question. The theme itself should not be forbidden, and the book's treatment of its theme was unexceptionable.Souhami, 226\u2013227.", "Hill and Cape appealed to the London Court of Quarter Sessions.Kitch.

The panel of twelve magistrates who heard the appeal had to rely on passages Inskip read to them for knowledge of the book, since the Director of Public Prosecutions had refused to release copies for them to read.
