The stage with the sample was not moving, instead the illumination spot was, allowing faster image acquisition: four images per second with 512 lines each. Hugely magnified intermediate images, due to a 1-2 meter long beam path, allowed the use of a conventional iris diaphragm as a \u2018pinhole\u2019, with diameters ~1\u00a0mm. First micrographs were taken with long-term exposure on film before a digital camera was added. A further improvement allowed zooming into the preparation for the first time. Zeiss, Leitz and Cambridge Instruments had no interest in a commercial production. The Medical Research Council (MRC) finally sponsored development of a prototype. The design was acquired by Bio-Rad, amended with computer control and commercialized as 'MRC 500'. The successor MRC 600 was later the basis for the development of the first two-photon-fluorescent microscope developed 1990 at Cornell University."]}, {"page": "Association of Biomolecular Resource Facilities", "response": ["*2015 John G.

He studied the role of cell\u2013cell interaction in determining the lineage pattern, stimulating a wide field of research. In more recent work, John and his co-workers partially confirmed his earlier model of cytokinesis; they discovered genes controlling cytokinesis and found features previously thought specific to plant cell division. Recognising the potentialities of laser-scanning confocal microscopy, John built a prototype microscope: with William Bradshaw Amos he developed this into a commercially produced instrument now widely used."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society A, B, C", "response": ["| William Bradshaw Amos||17/05/2007||21 November 1945 \u2013 Molecular Biology, Cambridge"]}, {"page": "William Amos", "response": ["*William Bradshaw Amos (born 1945), British biologist"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society elected in 2007", "response": ["#William Bradshaw Amos"]}]}}
