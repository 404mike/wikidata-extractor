Oakwood was part of the Leeds Rural District, a district containing the then growing estates of Roundhay and Seacroft, and was heavily tied to the city of Leeds. The land was sold by Goodman in 1825 to a local wealthy wool merchant family. Soon after the land purchase, Oakwood House had begun construction under the name of Wood End. It is not known exactly when the house started construction but maps show between 1825 and 1847. The house would change hands multiple times between 1847 and 1865 when it was sold to the Hudson family, who dropped the Wood End name and settled on Oakwood House. By 1867 the house would stop being advertised and surveyed as part of Roundhay as the name Oakwood had also begun to be used for the land surrounding the house. In 1891 much of the land was put up for sale as the Oakwood Building Estate and would form the basis for Oakwood as a settlement."]}, {"page": "Leeds (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Sir George Goodman"]}, {"page": "United Kingdom general election records", "response": ["The first Baptist general election victor was George Goodman at the 1852 general election."]}, {"page": "Records of members of parliament of the United Kingdom", "response": ["The first Baptist general election victor was George Goodman at the 1852 general election."]}, {"page": "George Goodman (disambiguation)", "response": ["George Goodman (1930\u20132014) was an American economics commentator known also as \"Adam Smith\".", "George Goodman may also refer to:", "* George Goodman (politician) (c. 1792\u20131859), English politician, Member of Parliament for Leeds", "* George Goodman (RAF officer) (1920\u20131941), Battle of Britain pilot", "* George Goodman (Royal Navy officer) (1900\u20131945), Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve, awarded the George Cross", "* George Goodman, a pseudonym for footballer George Getgood", "* George Goodman (table tennis), English table tennis player"]}, {"page": "George Goodman (MP)", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Goodman (politician)"]}, {"page": "Mayor Goodman", "response": ["* George Goodman (politician) (1791\u20131869), English wool-stapler and politician, 1st mayor of Leeds, England in 1836 and 1847"]}]}}
