He was the son of William Moon (1818\u20131894), inventor of \"Moon type\", an embossed alphabet for the blind.\nRobert Moon's career choice in ophthalmology was influenced by his experiences as a youth, helping his father in translating and transcribing reading matter for the visually handicapped. From 1866 to 1878 he practiced medicine at the South London Ophthalmic Hospital, a facility founded in 1857 by John Zachariah Laurence (1829\u20131870). Along with Dr. Laurence, the \"Laurence\u2013Moon syndrome\" is named, a disease characterized by retinitis pigmentosa combined with several additional symptoms.\nIn 1879 Moon emigrated to the United States, where he settled into an ophthalmological practice in Philadelphia. Following retirement, he became involved in a number of philanthropic activities for the blind. In 1905 he became editor of the monthly \"Moon Magazine\", published by Gardner's Trust for the Blind. Also, he served as secretary for the Philadelphia Home Teaching Society.\nMoon is interred at West Laurel Hill Cemetery, Providence Section, Lot 622, Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of eponymous diseases", "response": ["* Laurence\u2013Moon syndrome \u2013 John Zachariah Laurence, Robert Charles Moon", "* Laurence\u2013Moon\u2013Bardet\u2013Biedl syndrome (a.k.a.
