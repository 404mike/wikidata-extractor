In the late 1920s, after the excavation of Windmill Hill and other sites, it became apparent that causewayed enclosures were a characteristic monument of the Neolithic period.  About a thousand causewayed enclosures have now been found in Europe, including around seventy in Britain.  The site was excavated again in 1961 by Graham Connah, who kept thorough stratigraphic documentation. In 2011, the Gathering Time project published an analysis of radiocarbon dates which included several new dates from Connah's finds and concluded that there was a 91% chance that the Knap Hill enclosure was constructed between 3530 and 3375 BC. ", "=== Benjamin and Maud Cunnington, 1908\u20131909 ===", "The Neolithic enclosure was first excavated by Maud and Benjamin Cunnington, in the summers of 1908 and 1909.  The first summer's investigation revealed the segmented nature of the earthworks, and led to the publication of a short note by Maud Cunnington in the journal Man in 1909 in which she asked readers of the journal to suggest explanations:Cunnington (1909), pp. 49\u201352.", "Maud Cunnington described the excavation in a 1912 paper. She and Benjamin excavated a  long stretch of one of the ditches, and discovered that the width and depth varied greatly, from  deep and  wide at the bottom at the west end of the section, to  deep and only  wide at the bottom at the east end.  They also made cuttings along the southern edge of the hilltop to determine if a ditch existed there which was no longer visible on the surface, and found two short ditch sections at the eastern corner (marked S\u2013S on the plan).Cunnington (1912), pp. 59\u201360. ", "Most of the relics obtained from the ditches were found in clusters, and were usually within  of the bottom; they included some sherds of pottery, flint flakes and burnt flints, fragments of animal bones, and pieces of sarsen stone.  The only human bone found was a small jaw bone with worn teeth.Cunnington (1912), pp. 60\u201361.  The pottery was coarse, with flint inclusions, and was found associated with flint flakes, leading Maud Cunnington to suggest that the people who used the pottery may have been Neolithic, though she concluded that the inability to tell undecorated pottery of the Bronze Age and Neolithic periods apart meant that it was not possible to confidently assign a period.Cunnington (1912), p. 50.Cunnington (1912), pp. 56\u201357.  The Cunningtons found several flint-knapping clusters, including one group of seventy-two flint chips  deep in the ditch.Cunnington (1912), pp. 61\u201362.Whittle, Bayliss & Healy (2015), pp. 97\u201398.", "The discovery of a second enclosure, to the northeast of the original target of their excavation, complicated the Cunningtons' work.  To distinguish it from the \"Old Camp\", the new enclosure was labelled the \"Plateau Enclosure\" in Maud Cunnington's published paper.  It was clear to Cunnington that the plateau enclosure was much more recent than the old enclosure, since the plateau enclosure's southwestern ditch was dug through the old enclosure's ditch, which had silted up almost completely by that time.  Cunnington considered the plateau enclosure to have been constructed no earlier than the early Iron Age.  The ditch and low rampart that surrounded the enclosure were mostly undetectable on the surface; the Cunningtons cut sections around the perimeter at intervals to confirm their path. ", "Within the plateau enclosure was a long bank, running from southwest to northeast, with a circular mound at the northeastern end.  The Cunningtons found pottery sherds in the long bank that Maud Cunnington dated to Roman times, and also found in the centre of the bank that two pits lay beneath it, each marked P. on the plan.  These had been dug from the ground level before the bank was raised, and were both circular, about  deep, and  in diameter.  These contained flint flakes, coarse pottery and some animal bones, and Cunnington concluded that they were contemporary with the old enclosure and that it was a coincidence the long bank was raised over them.Cunnington (1912), pp. 51\u201353. ", "The Cunningtons also opened the barrow outside the old enclosure, to the southwest (not marked on their plan, but labelled \"Grinsell 10\" on Connah's plan, below), and found a skeleton fairly near the surface, face down.  It was missing all the bones of the legs and feet, and the right hand; Maud Cunnington speculated that the body had been buried so near the surface of the barrow that the missing bones had been disturbed by animals.  The only pottery sherds found were from the Roman period and were all near the surface, implying that the burial preceded the Roman occupation.Cunnington (1912), pp. 58\u201359."]}, {"page": "List of women anthropologists", "response": ["| Maud Cunnington"]}, {"page": "TrowelBlazers", "response": ["* Maud Cunnington"]}]}}
