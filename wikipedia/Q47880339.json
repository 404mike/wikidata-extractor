A useful contact Shubik made was with John Carnell, a key figure in British science fiction, founder of the magazine New Worlds and agent for many British science fiction writers.  Carnell assisted Shubik in selecting material and put her in contact with writers and publishers.  Carnell also promoted the series heavily in New Worlds, giving it the cover of the July 1962 edition.  When a strike by actor's union Equity hit production of Armchair Theatre, it bought Shubik the extra time she needed to find sufficient scripts.  All but two episodes were adaptations of short stories and novels.  Shubik took the name Out of This World from a series of anthology collections published by Blackie and Son, edited by Amabel Williams-Ellis."]}, {"page": "Left Review", "response": ["Left Review was a journal set up by the British section of the Comintern-sponsoredMurphy, J.F.
