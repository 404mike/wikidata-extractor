He was born in Tamworth.\nWylie made only three first-class appearances.\nHe picked up just two wickets in his brief first-team career: the first, on his debut against Nottinghamshire in 1993, was a rather fortunate one, having Bruce French dismissed hit wicket.\nTwo years later he had Middlesex's John Emburey caught by David Leatherdale.He had played for Worcestershire's Second XI as early as 1989,\nand joined the staff in 1991. However, injury blighted his chances and it was not until 1993 that a feature in The Guardian listed him as Worcestershire's \"one to watch\", noting his \"extremely rapid\" bowling. He now has a wife, karen wylie, and 4 children, Dan, Tom, Eva and Georgia.Wylie also played club cricket for Droitwich Spa in the Midland Combined Counties League.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alexander Wylie", "response": ["Alexander or Alex Wylie may refer to:", "*Alex Wylie (cricketer), English cricketer"]}]}}
