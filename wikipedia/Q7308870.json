At times during its history, it has been referred to as a Unitarian and Free Christian or simply Free Christian chapel.  This means that members do not adopt a particular statement of faith or set of beliefs: the Bible and personal interpretation of it are considered the sole authority for their views.  Services are held on Sunday mornings at 11.00am. The chapel was registered for marriages on 29 December 1837, and people married here include the conductor Sir Adrian Boult in 1933.  The author William Hale White, who used the pseudonym Mark Rutherford, fellow writers John Middleton Murry and G. K. Chesterton, and Reginald Sorensen, Baron Sorensen  had links to the chapel or visited it at various times."]}]}}
