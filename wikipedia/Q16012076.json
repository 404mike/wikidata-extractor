He appeared in 121 first-class matches as a right arm bowler, deploying both off spin and medium pace seam. He was a righthanded tail-end batsman. Garlick was born in Kirkby Lonsdale, Westmorland, 11 April 1917 and died in Blackpool on 16 May 1988. He was awarded two county caps, Lancashire in 1947 and Northamptonshire in 1949; he left Lancashire after the 1947 season and joined Northants for the 1948 season. He scored 1,663 runs in first-class cricket with a highest score of 62 not out, one of four half-centuries. He took 332 wickets with a best performance of six for 27.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1947 English cricket season", "response": ["Lancashire finished third for the second season in succession. They lost only once (to Somerset) but drew ten and tied one. They were well served by their openers Cyril Washbrook and Winston Place who both scored more than 2,000 runs in all first-class matches, Washbrook playing in all five Tests and Place being selected for the West Indies tour. There were problems in the middle order where only Geoff Edrich performed consistently well, but the two Test all-rounders, Jack Ikin and captain Ken Cranston scored over 1,000 runs. Lancashire's outstanding bowler was paceman Dick Pollard who finished the season strongly after an indifferent early phase and took 144 wickets in all matches. Slow left armer William Roberts bowled steadily and took 74 championship wickets but Playfair remarked that he was short of Test class. As with the batting, the all-rounders Cranston and Ikin shored up the bowling with 56 and 48 championship wickets respectively. Looking to the future, Lancashire made a \"find\" in wicketkeeper Alfred Barlow and there were good reports of Alan Wharton who became a Lancashire stalwart for many seasons. Batsman Barry Howard played some good innings in his debut season and, along with Cranston, was awarded his county cap. Other players included future county captain Nigel Howard, Tom Brierley, Phil King in his final season, future Test umpire Eddie Phillipson, Eric Price, and Gordon Garlick who joined Northamptonshire in 1948.Playfair, pp. 87\u201388."]}, {"page": "Garlick", "response": ["*Gordon Garlick, English cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of Northamptonshire County Cricket Club seasons", "response": ["|align=left|Gordon Garlick"]}, {"page": "Peter Konig", "response": ["Born in Vienna to Jewish parents, his family likely fled Austria following its annexation by Nazi Germany in 1938, arriving in the United Kingdom at some point thereafter. Konig later made a single first-class appearance for Leicestershire against Northamptonshire at the County Ground, Northampton in 1949. In Northamptonshire's first-innings of 239 all out, Konig made a single stumping when he stumped Gordon Garlick off the bowling of Gerry Lester. In Leicestershire's first-innings response, Konig was the last man out, dismissed for 6 runs by Des Barrick. In Northamptonshire's second-innings of 350/5 declared, Konig caught Percy Davis off the bowling of Charles Wooler. This was his only major appearance for the county."]}, {"page": "Richard Garlick", "response": ["#REDIRECT Gordon Garlick"]}]}}
