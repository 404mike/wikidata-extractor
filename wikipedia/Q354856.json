He is an atheist.When describing a total solar eclipse, Close wrote: \"It was simultaneously ghastly, beautiful, supernatural. Even for a 21st century atheist, the vision was such that I thought, \"If there is a heaven, this is what its entrance is like.\" The heavenly vision demanded music by Mozart; instead we had the crickets.\" Frank Close, 'Dark side of the moon', The Guardian, August 9, 2001, Guardian Online Pages, Pg. 8."]}, {"page": "John Clive Ward", "response": ["This can be used to derive the correlation of the quantum polarisations of the two photons. Their prediction was confirmed experimentally by Chien-Shiung Wu and I. Shaknov in 1950. This was the first experimental confirmation of a pair of entangled photons as applicable to the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox. The result was subsequently explained by Richard Dalitz and Frank Duarte. Apparently following Dirac's doctrine, Ward was never bothered by issues of interpretation in quantum mechanics."]}, {"page": "Deaths in January 2006", "response": ["*Richard Dalitz, 80, Australian physicist, expert in exotic particles, studied quarks."]}, {"page": "Dick Dalitz", "response": ["#redirect Richard Dalitz"]}, {"page": "List of University of Melbourne people", "response": ["* Richard Dalitz \u2013 inventor of the Dalitz plot"]}, {"page": "Richard Henry Dalitz", "response": ["#REDIRECT Richard Dalitz "]}, {"page": "Richard H.
