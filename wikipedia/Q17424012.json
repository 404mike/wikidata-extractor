He drew audiences first at provincial towns such as Bath, then moving his venue to London. His theatre (dubbed \"Punch's Opera\" or \"Punch's Theatre\") established itself in early 1710 at its first location, at the north end of St. Martin's Street intersected by Litchfield St., not quite in Covent Garden. But by 1711 he relocated the theatre to the galleries of Covent Garden, at Little Piazza, opposite St. Paul's Church.He has been credited with establishing the stock form of the Punch and Judy plays. Charles Magnin, the learned author of the Histoire des Marionnettes en Europe, calls the years of Powell's pre-eminence \"the golden age of marionettes in England.\" It has been commented \"Powell is described as a deformed cripple but his powers of satire were considerable,\" to the extent that the ministry recruited Powell to lampoon the French prophets to diminish their influence among the populace. He not only narrated (spoke the lengthy prologues), with a wand in hand, but was a puppeteer himself, and he is thought to have built his own puppet figures and written the plays himself.A 20th-century scholar assesses the period of Powell's prominent activity to be 1709\u20131720, the popularity of his puppetry having waned in the latter years, \"his son briefly carried on the tradition in the [1720s]\", and he died 1729.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Punch and Judy", "response": ["In the early 18th century, the puppet theatre starring Punch was at its height, with showman Martin Powell attracting sizable crowds at both his Punch's Theatre at Covent Garden and earlier in provincial Bath, Somerset. Powell has been credited with being \"largely responsible for the form taken by the drama of Punch and Judy\". In 1721, a puppet theatre opened in Dublin that ran for decades. The cross-dressing actress Charlotte Charke ran the successful but short-lived Punch's Theatre in the Old Tennis Court at St. James's, Westminster, presenting adaptations of Shakespeare as well as plays by herself, her father Colley Cibber, and her friend Henry Fielding. Fielding eventually ran his own puppet theatre under the pseudonym Madame de la Nash to avoid the censorship concomitant with the Theatre Licensing Act of 1737."]}, {"page": "Jack the Giant Killer", "response": ["\"The History of Jack and the Giants\" (the earliest known edition) was published in two parts by J.
