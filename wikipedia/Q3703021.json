They returned in June the following year, playing at The Scala in London to promote the release of Time For Action: The Anthology (Sanctuary), a major CD retrospective of hits, rarities and previously unreleased tracks. The concert was filmed and released on DVD. In 2005, Page and Cairns attempted to mend their sometimes fractious relationship and started work on a fourth Secret Affair album, recording five new songs. The album eventually came to fruition in 2012, entitled Soho Dreams, entirely financed by the band without any record company involvement. In 2017, they continued to tour and record as Secret Affair and celebrate their 40th anniversary in 2019 with a 14 date UK April/May spring tour."]}, {"page": "Walk on Fire", "response": ["The band was formed by David Cairns and Alan King in 1987, signing to UNI/MCA Records in the US, and MCA in the UK, and initially managed by Bill Curbishley. The early pre-production of the album was produced by Dave Cairns' former Secret Affair band-mate Dennis Smith, who also co-wrote one of the album tracks, \"Tell It Like It Is\" with Alan King. The album was recorded at Hook End Manor & The Virgin Manor Studios, Oxford, in the UK and produced by Walter Turbitt, engineer and producer of The Cars. It featured Steve Ferrone (drums), Keith Airey (guitar), Richard Cottle and Pete Vitesse (keyboards).", "The live band featured Alan King (vocals), Michael Casswell (guitar), Trevor Thornton (drums), Phil Williams (bass) & David Cairns (keyboards). Walk on Fire toured with Foreigner, The Dan Reed Network, Ratt and Nils Lofgren and toured the UK extensively, but despite favourable reviews following the US release and over 245,000 units sold worldwide, the album was not enough of a commercial success for MCA Records to keep the band and Walk On Fire were regretfully dropped over financial issues. The band went on to record material (mainly) written and produced by Dave Cairns in 24 track recording studios in and around London for a second album but with the grunge music explosion, no label was going to sign an AOR album and the band broke up.", "Alan King went on to sing the lead role in Jeff Wayne's follow up to 'War of The Worlds'  - Spartacus - alongside Catherine Zeta-Jones and with a cast that included Anthony Hopkins and Dave Cairns went on to be appointed Special Projects and Events Manager for Gibson Guitars USA throughout the 1990s.

(There! I didn't say commercialism!) The bottom line, however, is the material. There are no dire tracks, and most are at least pleasant. 'Live for Today', which deserves far more urgent music, points out that some bland, pretty-ish tunes aren't suited to the lyrics. When it all comes together, as on the ambitious 'When the Show Is Over' or the straightforward 'I'm a Bullet', the results are impressive.\""]}]}}
