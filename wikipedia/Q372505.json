Ken MacLeod stated that \"the political strand in [science fiction] can be described as a dialogue with Heinlein\". Science fiction critic Darko Suvin wrote that Starship Troopers is the \"ancestral text of US science fiction militarism\" and that it shaped the debate about the role of the military in society for many years. The novel has been credited with popularizing the idea of powered armor, which has since become a recurring feature in science fiction books and films, as well as an object of scientific research. Heinlein's depiction of a futuristic military was also influential. Later science fiction books, such as Joe Haldeman's 1974 anti-war novel The Forever War, have been described as reactions to Starship Troopers. The story has been adapted several times, including in a 1997 film version directed by Paul Verhoeven with screenplay by Edward Neumeier that sought to satirize what the director saw as the fascist aspects of the novel.", "Criticism of the style of the book has centered on its political aspects. Heinlein's discussions of his political beliefs were criticized as \"didactic\", and the novel was derided for \"exposition [that was] inserted in large indigestible chunks\". Author Ken MacLeod's 2003 analysis of the political nature of Starship Troopers stated that it was \"a book where civics infodumps and accounts of brutal boot-camp training far outweigh the thin and tensionless combat scenes\". Scientist and author Brunner compared it to a \"Victorian children's book\", while the Science Fiction Handbook published in 2009 said that the novel provided \"compelling images of a futuristic military\" and that it raised important questions, even for those who disagree with its political ideology. However, it stated that the story was weak as a tale of an alien encounter, as it did not explore alien society in any detail, but presented the Arachnids as nameless and faceless creatures that wished to destroy humanity. Boucher, founder of The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, remarked in 1960 that Heinlein had \"forgotten to insert a story\". A 1979 summary said that though Heinlein's vision might verge on fascism, his tightly controlled narrative made his ideology seem \"vibrantly appealing\".", "Heinlein's books, and Starship Troopers in particular, had an enormous impact on political science fiction, to the extent that author Ken MacLeod has stated that \"the political strand in [science fiction] can be described as a dialogue with Heinlein,\" although many participants in this dialogue disagree with Heinlein. Science fiction critic Darko Suvin states that Starship Troopers is the \"ancestral text of US science fiction militarism\" and that it shaped the debate about the role of the military in society for many years."]}, {"page": "Sidewise Award for Alternate History", "response": [":2001 \u2013 Ken MacLeod, The Human Front"]}, {"page": "Future history", "response": ["There are several ways this is dealt with. One solution to the problem is when some authors set their stories in an indefinite future, often in a society where the current calendar has been disrupted due to a societal collapse or undergone some form of distortion due to the impact of technology. Related to the first, some stories are set in the very remote future and only deal with the author's contemporary history in a sketchy fashion, if at all (e.g. the original Foundation Trilogy by Asimov). Another related case is where stories are set in the near future, but with an explicitly allohistorical past, as in Ken MacLeod's Engines of Light series."]}, {"page": "List of science-fiction authors", "response": ["*Ken MacLeod (born 1954)"]}, {"page": "The Green Hills of Earth", "response": ["In his 2005 book Learning the World, Ken MacLeod pays homage to this song: Chapter 17 (\"Fire in the Sky\") ends with a scene where a spacecraft evades an attack.
