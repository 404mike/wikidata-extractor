Receiving a commission in the army in 1763.  Returning to England, he commenced work on the defences at Portsmouth Dockyard, before accompanying General Sir John Burgoyne's army to Canada in 1776, where he was responsible for a number of defensive programmes.  He returned to England in 1783.  Over the following years, Twiss oversaw the construction of various defences, including the chain of Martello Towers along the Kent and Sussex coastline.  Twiss also accompanied the army on expeditions to the Netherlands, the Channel Islands and Ireland.  Twiss was made Major General in 1805, and in 1809 became colonel-commandant of Royal Engineers Corps.  1825 saw him made full general.After retiring, Twiss lived at Myrtle Grove in Bingley, West Yorkshire. He died 14 March 1827, aged 82, and is buried in the church of All Saints, Bingley.Twiss married Elizabeth Wood (1740/41\u20131835), in 1775.

William Twiss, the Commanding Engineer of the Southern District, as part of his brief to improve the town's defences, completed the remodelling of the outer defences of Dover Castle by adding the huge Horseshoe, Hudson's, East Arrow and East Demi-Bastions to provide extra gun positions on the eastern side, and constructing the Constable's Bastion for additional protection on the west. Twiss further strengthened the Spur at the northern end of the castle, adding a redan, or raised the gun platform. By taking the roof off the keep and replacing it with massive brick vaults, he was able to mount heavy artillery on the top. Twiss also constructed Canon's Gateway to link the defences of the castle with those of the town."]}, {"page": "Royal Engineers", "response": ["The Western Heights of Dover are one of the most impressive fortifications in Britain.

First given earthworks in 1779 against the planned invasion that year, the high ground west of Dover, England, now called Dover Western Heights, was properly fortified in 1804 when Lieutenant-Colonel William Twiss was instructed to modernise the existing defences.

A total of 103 Martello towers were built in England, set at regular intervals along the coast from Seaford, Sussex, to Aldeburgh, Suffolk. Most were constructed under the direction of General William Twiss (1745\u20131827) and a Captain Ford.Mead (1948), pp. 205\u201317, 294\u2013303.Ward (1949), pp. 18\u201337.

The meeting, which was attended by the Prime Minister, William Pitt the Younger, agreed to adopt a revolutionary scheme to build a chain of mutually-supporting circular artillery towers along a stretch of the Channel coast where the French were thought to be most likely to land. The scheme had been devised by Captain William Henry Ford of the Royal Engineers and championed by Brigadier-General William Twiss who commanded the Royal Engineer Southern District. The original plan called for 83 Martello towers, each mounting a single heavy gun, at intervals along the coast and three 11-gun towers at Sea Houses (Eastbourne), Rye Harbour and Dymchurch. In the event, 74 Martello Towers were actually built and plans for the 11-gun tower at Rye were abandoned.Clements, Bill (2011), Martello Towers Worldwide, Pen & Sword Books Limited,  (pp. 24-26) The 11-gun towers, which came to be known as \"circular forts\" or \"grand redoubts\", were intended to act as barracks and stores depots for the rest of the Martello chain, as well as formidable fortresses in their own right. A third redoubt was later constructed at Harwich in Essex to support the Martello chain built to defend the east coast; although broadly similar, it differs in some details from the south coast redoubts.Lowry, Bernard (2008), Discovering Fortifications: From the Tudors to the Cold War, Shire Discovering  (p. 49)"]}, {"page": "Bere Island", "response": ["In December 1796, a French fleet entered Bantry Bay and Berehaven Harbour, led by General Hoche under the direction of Wolfe Tone, the leader of the United Irishmen.

In August 1798, there was a further invasion attempt, at Killala in County Mayo, following the Irish Rebellion of that year. The result of these events was that the British authorities reviewed their defensive plans and in 1803, with the country once again at war with France, Lieutenant-Colonel William Twiss was sent to Ireland to draw up a plan of defence for the country.
