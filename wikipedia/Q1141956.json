His column in the Financial Times, \"Since You Asked\", ran between 2011 and 2014 and offered a sceptical look at the news of the week.In October 2007 Harford assumed the presenter role at the BBC Radio 4 broadcast segment More or Less. The series segments are also available as podcasts. Subsequently Harford launched his own podcast on the podcast production network Pushkin Industries, called Cautionary Tales.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Nuffield College, Oxford", "response": ["Visiting fellows include Stephanie Flanders, former BBC economics editor, Tim Harford, author and economist, and George Soros, investor and philanthropist.", "File:Tim Harford in 2012.jpg|Tim Harford, economist and journalist "]}, {"page": "Price discrimination", "response": ["For certain products, premium products are priced at a level (compared to \"regular\" or \"economy\" products) that is well beyond their marginal cost of production. For example, a coffee chain may price regular coffee at $1, but \"premium\" coffee at $2.50 (where the respective costs of production may be $0.90 and $1.25). Economists such as Tim Harford in the Undercover Economist have argued that this is a form of price discrimination: by providing a choice between a regular and premium product, consumers are being asked to reveal their degree of price sensitivity (or willingness to pay) for comparable products. Similar techniques are used in pricing business class airline tickets and premium alcoholic drinks, for example."]}, {"page": "Wealth", "response": ["The wealth of households amounts to US$280 trillion (2017).

This reflected widespread gains in equity markets matched by similar rises in non-financial assets, which moved above the pre-crisis year 2007's level for the first time this year.

Before 2005, tactics included staying out of dangerous urban areas except on patrols, with US forces returning to their bases each night. These patrols had little success in turning back the insurgency because local Iraqis who feared retaliation would very rarely assist in identifying them to US forces. McMaster deployed his soldiers into Tal Afar on a permanent basis, and once the local population grew confident that they weren't going to withdraw nightly, the citizens began providing information on the insurgents, enabling US forces to target and defeat them. After hearing of McMaster's counterinsurgency success in Tal Afar, Vice President Dick Cheney invited McMaster to personally brief him on the situation in Iraq and give an assessment on what changes needed to be made to American strategy."]}, {"page": "The Undercover Economist", "response": ["The Undercover Economist () () is a book by Tim Harford published in 2005 by Little, Brown."]}, {"page": "Pigou Club", "response": ["|Tim Harford || December 8, 2006 ||Economist"]}, {"page": "Category talk:British journalists", "response": ["Tim Harfordnot yet classified"]}, {"page": "Peter J.
