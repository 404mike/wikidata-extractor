However, it has been suggested that Henley may have misread the label. Others date the start of his career as late as 1750, from which period there are more extant instruments. However, Ward is thought to have been working as a violin maker at Christ Church Yard, Dublin by around 1740. It is uncertain who Ward apprenticed with, but it is possible that he was a pupil of Dublin luthier Thomas Molineux (d. 1757), who also resided at Christ Church Yard."]}]}}
