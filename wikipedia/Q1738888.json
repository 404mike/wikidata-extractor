Born in South Wales, he moved to London with his family as a child, and was educated at Christ's Hospital. In 1896 he lived in Dublin for a while, where he became friends with George William Russell. From 1908 to 1930 Morris lived in California as a member of staff of the Theosophical Society headquarters at Point Loma. The last seven years of his life were spent back in his native Wales, during which time he founded seven Welsh theosophical lodges. Morris\nwas a friend of Talbot Mundy, and the two writers often commentated on each other's work in The Theosophical Path \nmagazine.In the verdict of Ursula K. Le Guin, Morris appears as one of the three master prose stylists of fantasy in the 20th century, together with E. R. Eddison and J. R. R. Tolkien.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ursula K. Le Guin", "response": ["Commentators have also described Le Guin as being influential in the field of literature more generally. Literary critic Elaine Showalter suggested that Le Guin \"set the pace as a writer for women unlearning silence, fear, and self-doubt\", while writer Brian Attebery stated that \"[Le Guin] invented us: science fiction and fantasy critics like me but also poets and essayists and picture book writers and novelists\". Le Guin's own literary criticism proved influential; her 1973 essay \"From Elfland to Poughkeepsie\" led to renewed interest in the work of Kenneth Morris, and eventually to the publication of a posthumous novel by Morris. Le Guin also played a role in bringing speculative fiction into the literary mainstream by supporting journalists and scholarly endeavors examining the genre."]}, {"page": "Mabinogion", "response": ["* Kenneth Morris, himself a Welshman, pioneered the adaptation of the Mabinogion with The Fates of the Princes of Dyfed (1914) and Book of the Three Dragons (1930)."]}, {"page": "Mythopoeic Awards", "response": ["|Kenneth Morris"]}, {"page": "Historical fantasy", "response": ["The Welsh tradition has been particularly influential, which has its connection to King Arthur and its collection in a single work, the epic Mabinogion.
