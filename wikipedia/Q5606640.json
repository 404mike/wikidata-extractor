Zacchia focused on FIA GT for the next two seasons before returning to LMS in 2007, once again with Larbe with support from Aston Martin Racing as Larbre ran their DBR9. His team mate for the majority of the season was Gregor Fisken. For the final round, the 2007 Mil Milhas Brasil, the duo were joined by Roland Bervill\u00e9 and Brazilian racer Fernando Rees. It was the final round at Interlagos that he won in the GT1 class but only half points were awarded due to less than five cars competing in that particular class. Zacchia and Fisken finished eighth in the GT1 standings, with their No. 51 car finishing sixth in the teams championship. In 2008, he was signed by Swiss team Speedy Racing Team Sebah (now Rebellion Racing) for the Le Mans Series season.
