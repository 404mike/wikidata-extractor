He worked variously with N-Trance, The Time Frequency, Belinda Carlisle, Ice MC, Scooter, Mary Kiani and DJ Dado.His multi-award-winning dance music show, Steppin' Out, started in 1985 and ran for fourteen years on Radio Forth, Forth RFM and Forth FM. Although the show was only broadcast to East and Central Scotland, tapes of the show were sent all over the world, hence the reason there were  requests from listeners in Australia, Canada and Hong Kong. Due to the success of his show and the Scottish dance music boom, Wilson's Bonus Beats programme aired on Forth FM during the mid-1990s. This allowed many local DJs the opportunity to provide one-hour mixes, spawning the growth of Tartan techno.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of house music artists", "response": ["*Tom Wilson"]}, {"page": "Bouncy techno", "response": ["Local artists and DJs soon appeared in Western Europe, Australia and Japan; Q-Tex (Brown) and Ultra-Sonic played at the Mayday music festivals in Germany of 1994.
