In September 1909 he (together with several other amateur internationals) was persuaded to join Samuel Hill-Wood's team at Glossop North End."]}, {"page": "Sam Jepp", "response": ["He made his debut for the \"Saints\" on 15 February 1908, when he replaced former England international Harry Hadley at left-half in a 4\u20130 defeat at Brentford.

In 1908\u201309, he had two runs in the side with six matches at left-half in October (replacing John Johnston with Bert Trueman switching to the right), and twelve matches from mid-January at centre-half whilst Frank Thorpe was out with injury."]}, {"page": "John Robertson (footballer, born 1884)", "response": ["In 1908\u201309, Robertson was in-and-out of the side, alternating with Horace Glover at left-back in the early part of the season before a handful of matches in the latter part of the season at half-back. In the following season, he missed only six matches and played in all five defensive roles, as well as making one appearance up front, this time at outside-left.
