Astro Teller, the head of Google X, explained to Levy that 10X is \"just core to who he [Page] is\", while Page's \"focus is on where the next 10X will come from.\" In his interview with Levy, Page referred to the success of YouTube and Android as examples of \"crazy\" ideas that investors were not initially interested in, saying: \"If you're not doing some things that are crazy, then you're doing the wrong things.\" Page also stated he was \"very happy\" with the status of Google+, and discussed concerns over the Internet concerning the SOPA bill and an International Telecommunication Union proposal that had been recently introduced:... I do think the Internet's under much greater attack than it has been in the past. Governments are now afraid of the Internet because of the Middle East stuff, and so they're a little more willing to listen to what I see as a lot of commercial interests that just want to make money by restricting people's freedoms. But they've also seen a tremendous user reaction, like the backlash against SOPA. I think that governments fight users' freedoms at their peril.At the May 2013 I/O developers conference in San Francisco, Page delivered a keynote address and said \"We're at maybe 1% of what is possible. Despite the faster change, we're still moving slow relative to the opportunities we have. I think a lot of that is because of the negativity ... Every story I read is Google vs someone else. That's boring. We should be focusing on building the things that don't exist\" and that he was \"sad the Web isn't advancing as fast as it should be\", citing a perceived focus on negativity and zero-sum games among some in the technology sector as a cause. In response to an audience question, Page noted an issue that Google had been experiencing with Microsoft, whereby the latter made its Outlook program interoperable with Google but did not allow for backward compatibility\u2014he referred to Microsoft's practice as \"milking off\". During the question-and-answer section of his keynote, Page expressed interest in Burning Man, which Brin had previously praised\u2014it was a motivating factor for the latter during Schmidt's hiring process, as Brin liked that Schmidt had attended the week-long annual event."]}, {"page": "Greeklish", "response": ["Giannis Androutsopoulos (see references) talks about Exegesis, a book in Greeklish that was published by Oxy Publications in 2000.
