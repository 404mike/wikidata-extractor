Mooney was a great hit from the start and was the club's top scorer for the two season he was at the club. After winning promotion to the second division in 1978, Haugar went all the way to the Norwegian Cup Final in 1979, and Mooney put them 1-0 up against Viking with a trademark header. A dubious penalty and an own-goal turned the match around after half-time, in what was to be Mooney's last game for the club.

By mid-December, Blunstone had just 12 fit players available and despite spending over a further \u00a325,000 on attackers Roger Cross, Barry Salvage and Andy Woon, Brentford's slide towards relegation continued through the early months of 1973. The mid-season signings failed to help arrest the slump and Brentford were relegated after taking just two points from the final six matches of the season.
