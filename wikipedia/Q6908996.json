She also sang Tatiana (Eugene Onegin), Venus (Tannh\u00e4user), Abigaille (Nabucco), Eboli (Don Carlos) Santuzza (Cavalleria rusticana) and many other roles. Her operatic career in Australia was relatively brief, lasting only from 1965 until 1983, with a final recital at the Sydney Opera House in 1983.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Morag", "response": ["* Morag Beaton, Scottish-Australian soprano"]}, {"page": "List of Scottish musicians", "response": ["*Morag Beaton (1926\u20132010), dramatic soprano"]}, {"page": "Wuthering Heights (Herrmann)", "response": ["Wuthering Heights was recorded, in full, by Pye Records in 1966, under the direction of the composer, who conducted the Pro Arte Orchestra.
