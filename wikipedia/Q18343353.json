By 1815, three commercial manufacturers had established woollen mills in Milnrow. while topographer James Butterworth wrote that Newhey consisted of \"several ranges of cottages and two public houses\" in 1828.Butterworth (1828), p.\u00a0113. The Industrial Revolution introduced the factory system which was adopted by the local inhabitants; the River Beal was the main power source for new woollen weaving mills and technologies. Construction of large mechanised cotton mills in nearby Oldham was admired by business owners in Milnrow, prompting them to build similar factories; the principal occupation remained as wool weaving, but cotton spinning and chainmaking was introduced.Hignett (1991), p.\u00a011. Unusually for the period and region, women in particular were employed as chainmakers by Milnrow's blacksmiths during the 19th century. Nationally, the factory system and the Corn Laws combined to reduce wages and increase food prices in the early-1840s, leading to protests and disorder at Milnrow in August 1842; the Riot Act was read and the 11th Hussars were deployed to restore order and protect burgeoning mills and their owners from harm. The Corn Laws were repealed in 1846, and Ordnance Survey maps show Milnrow to have had three woollen mills, and one cotton mill by 1848. The Oldham Corporation obtained compulsory purchase rights in 1858 to acquire and dam the Piethorne Brook, completing the Piethorne Reservoir in 1863. The construction of rectangular multi-storey brick cotton mills followed,Sellers (1991), p.\u00a047. and The British Trade Journal noted that cottages in Milnrow and Newhey were \"in great demand\". Terraced houses with slate roofs and facades of stone or red brick were built in rows to house an influx of workers and families. Streets and roads were cobbled, and transport was horse-drawn or by the Rochdale Canal. The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway opened the Oldham Loop railway line in 1863, with stations at Milnrow and Newhey\u2014the latter gave rise to the \"industrial village\" of Newhey, with mills and housing built concentrically outwards from the railway line. Butterworth Hall Colliery opened in 1865. However, public street lighting was not widely available until after a dispute was heard by the House of Lords in April 1869. Providers of gas lighting in the neighbouring Municipal Borough of Rochdale originally overlooked Milnrow because they had \"not thought it worth their while extending their mains into a thinly populated district\", but later conceded \"there had been a great increase of population\" and it was \"thriving\". In the 1870s, wool was supplanted by cotton \"with success\". Ring spinning companies \u2013 some of the earliest in the UK \u2013 were formed by local influential businessmen, giving rise to Milnrow's reputation as a company town\u2014the Heap business family exercised significant deferential and political influence upon the newly-formed Milnrow Local Board of Health from their Cliffe House home in Newhey. Inspired by the Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers, and using the Rochdale Principles, consumers' co-operative groups were established at Milnrow, Newhey, Ogden and Firgrove throughout the second half of the 19th century. In 1885, municipal buildings were developed for the Milnrow Local Board, while an Act of Parliament empowered the Oldham Corporation to make further purchases in the Piethorne Valley so as to create additional reservoirs. An elected urban district council was established for the \"thriving town\" of Milnrow and its hinterland in 1894, followed by the introduction of new amenities: a golf course at Tunshill in 1901, and a Carnegie library at Milnrow in 1907. A steam-powered tram system connected to Rochdale was authorised for Milnrow in 1904, but was resisted\u2014and later abandoned\u2014by the district's \"influential folk\" who felt that \"drawing the two communities closer\" would result in \"hastening the annexation\" of Milnrow in to Rochdale. Milnrow Council approved terms with Rochdale Corporation Tramways in 1909 for an electric-powered street-level passenger tramway running from Firgrove in the west to Newhey in the south."]}, {"page": "Hollinwood, Greater Manchester", "response": ["James Butterworth (1826) described it as being of 66.5 Cheshire acres (approx. 140 statute acres). It was enclosed by the Oldham Enclosure Acts (42 and 43 George III; May 1802). Hollinwood's mills such as the Heron, Fox, Asia, Wharf, Richmond and Park were later built on what had been the Hollinwood Common.

Among early historical references to this area we find, in 1212, Ralph Tagun held Sholver as 4 oxgangs of land; it was part of the Nevill estate then in hand of King John. In 1346 it was held in moieties by Richard de Pilkington and Cecily de Hulme. From the Hulmes it descended to the Prestwich family, who held it till the middle of the 17th century. It was sold to various persons about 1657. In April 1540, during the reign of Charles I of England, Robert Lytham carried out some measuring of Sholver moor.", "As cotton milling was introduced in the 18th century, the cottage industry of Sholver declined, and instead became an important source of coal which was growing in demand. James Butterworth claimed that \"the Manchester market seems to prefer the coal dug in this parish before that of any other.\" As early as 1791 Edmund Kershaw of Sholver was a known collier, though some of the early coal mines in the area-bell or beehive pits-date back as early as 1542."]}, {"page": "Cowhill, Greater Manchester", "response": ["Mentioned in the mid-16th century as Coohill and Cohyll, the district's growth during the late 18th and early 19th centuries led to this description in 1826 by local historian James Butterworth -", "History and Description of the Parochial Chapelry of Oldham.
