Byron apparently fell in love with the 12-year-old girl; in a letter to Henry Drury the poet declares to be \"dying for love of three Greek Girls at Athens\", \"Teresa, Mariana, and Kattinka\", and wrote the poem for her before departing for Constantinople. On his way back from Turkey to the Morea, on 17 July 1810, he stayed at Mrs. Makri's house for another ten days.
