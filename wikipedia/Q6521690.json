He began his career as an apprentice with Bristol City, turning professional in September 1971, although he had made his league debut on the last day of the previous season.

However Shaw did make two substitute appearances in the Anglo Scottish Cup in August 1975. Cashley started in goal in season 1976\u201377 in the First Division before Len Bond was given a chance with two games but was injured so John Shaw finally made his League debut in goal for Bristol City in a 0\u20131 defeat v Birmingham City on 26 October 1976. This was the start of a run of 103 successive league appearances for Shaw. Bristol City hovered around the relegation places throughout their first season back in the First Division. Lying bottom in 22nd place with four games to go they managed two wins and two draws to finish 18th. The final game at Coventry City ended in a 2\u20132 draw which was enough to save both teams from relegation with the ball hardly leaving the centre circle during the last 15 minutes of the game. Shaw made 33 appearances in 1976\u201377. John Shaw was the only ever present City player in 1977\u201378 with 42 appearances as the \"Robins\" rose to 17th in the table. Shaw also played in all nine Anglo Scottish cup ties culminating in a two legged final 3\u20132 aggregate win over St Mirren in December 1977. It was during this period that John Shaw was spoken of as a possible replacement for Alan Rough in the Scotland full international team; but despite his splendid form the call to international duty never came."]}, {"page": "Trevor Porter", "response": ["Injury to Len Bond and a suspension for Graham Cox saw Porter return to the Football League to sign for Third Division club Brentford in August 1978 for a \u00a3750 fee.

Yeovil then faced Millwall in the second round of the League Cup, after being reduced to ten-men Yeovil were knocked out losing 2\u20131. The game turned out to be the last match at Yeovil for manager Gary Johnson, who left the club to join West Country rivals Bristol City. Johnson departed after four seasons in which he had overseen two promotions and victory in the FA Trophy. Johnson's assistant Steve Thompson took over as caretaker boss and recorded a 1\u20130 victory in his first match in charge against Port Vale, with summer signing Matt Harrold scoring his first goal for the club. On 27 September, Yeovil travelled to Southend United and despite taking the lead courtesy of a Jevons free-kick ultimately lost 4\u20131.

Though Sweetzer was sold for \u00a330,000 late in the 1977\u201378 season, Brentford kept their heads and secured promotion back to the Third Division with a 4th-place finish.
