The film stars Michael Segal, Debbie Rochon, Marysia Kay, Gerry Shanahan, and Eleanor James.  Bloody Disgusting praised the film, stating Zuccon \"managed to do the famous writer's twisted tale of unseen terror a really fair share of justice by capturing the bleak, grotesque and utterly frightening atmosphere of the source material very, very well\". The 2010 film Die Farbe (The Color), directed by Huan Vu, is an adaptation set in Germany. It is shot mainly in black and white, the exception being the \"Colour\" itself. S. T. Joshi described it as \"the best Lovecraft film adaptation ever made\". The 2018 film Annihilation\u2014itself based on the 2014 novel of the same name by Jeff VanderMeer\u2014contains numerous plot similarities with Lovecraft's story, most prominently a colorful alien entity that crash lands on earth and begins mutating nearby plant and animal life.
