In January 2011 he signed a contract extension with Villa, tying him to the club until 2014. Herd made his first start for the \"Villans\" in a 3\u20130 defeat to Manchester City in the FA Cup Fifth Round. Due to the injuries and suspensions of a few senior defenders at Villa, Herd then followed this making his first Premier League start for Villa, lining up in at right back, in the match against local rivals, Wolverhampton Wanderers at Molineux on 19 March.
