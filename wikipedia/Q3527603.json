Over the winter, the side had been settled, with Norman Cowans and Chris Cowdrey playing all five Tests.  Neil Foster and Richard Ellison shared the third spot alongside the spinners, playing two and three Tests respectively. Cowdrey and Ellison had struggled with the ball, both averaging more than 70. However, the side was extensively remodelled for the first Test of that summer's Ashes series. Of the bowlers who had played the last Test in India, only Cowans had survived the cull and it set the tone for the series. England won the first Test, yet dropped Cowans and Peter Willey, replacing them with Phil Edmonds and Foster. After losing the second Test, and struggling with the ball in the third Test, when Australia made 539 all out in their only innings, England decided to make further changes."]}, {"page": "Black British people", "response": ["In cricket, many have represented England: Mark Alleyne, Jofra Archer, Mark Butcher, Michael Carberry, Norman Cowans, Phillip DeFreitas, Dean Headley, Chris Jordan, David Lawrence, Chris Lewis, Devon Malcolm, Gladstone Small, and Alex Tudor to name a few."]}, {"page": "World Championship of Cricket", "response": ["David Gower (captain), Jonathan Agnew, Norman Cowans, Chris Cowdrey, Paul Downton, Phil Edmonds, Richard Ellison, Neil Foster, Graeme Fowler, Mike Gatting, Allan Lamb, Vic Marks, Martyn Moxon, Tim Robinson."]}, {"page": "English cricket team in Australia and New Zealand in 1982\u201383", "response": ["The England selectors announced their squad on 11 September which flew out to Australia on 13 October. Doug Insole was appointed Tour Manager, with Norman Gifford as his assistant, while Warwickshire physiotherapist Bernard Thomas joined the squad for his eleventh successive tour. Veteran pace bowler Bob Willis was appointed captain. The squad was weakened by the absence of a number of players from the previous Ashes series who had become ineligible for selection; Graham Gooch, Geoff Boycott, John Emburey, Mike Hendrick, Alan Knott, Wayne Larkins, Chris Old, Peter Willey and Bob Woolmer were serving three-year bans from international cricket due to their participation in the rebel tour to South Africa. Somewhat more controversial was the omission of available players like Mike Gatting, Trevor Jesty, Graham Dilley and Phil Edmonds; Gatting and Edmonds had played pivotal roles in Middlesex' county championship success, Gatting scoring over 1600 runs at an average of nearly 59, as well as contributing 21 wickets, and Edmonds taking 80 wickets. With three off-spinners selected in the squad (Hemmings, Marks and Miller), his left-arm orthodox spin would have provided much-needed variety. To bolster their pace stocks, the selectors sprang a surprise by including 21-year-old Jamaican-born Norman Cowans.", "* Norman Cowans (Middlesex)", "|Norman Cowans||8||13||2||70||6.36||36|| || ||6||", "|Norman Cowans||1342||745||26||28.65||6/77||1|| ||51.6"]}, {"page": "1983 Cricket World Cup squads", "response": ["|Norman Cowans"]}, {"page": "Harry Frei", "response": ["It was not until the age of 31 that he made his first-class cricket debut, picked to play against a Bob Willis led England XI.
