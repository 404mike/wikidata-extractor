Many classical scholars, such as historian Ignace Gelb, credit the Ancient Greeks for creating the first alphabetic system (c. 750 BCE) that used distinctive signs for consonants and vowels. But Goody contests, \"The importance of Greek culture of the subsequent history of Western Europe has led to an over-emphasis, by classicists and others, on the addition of specific vowel signs to the set of consonantal ones that had been developed earlier in Western Asia\".Goody, Jack (1987).

As noted above, Anthropologist Jack Goody's comparative study of marriage around the world utilizing the Ethnographic Atlas found that the majority of Sub-Saharan African societies that practice extensive hoe agriculture show a correlation between \"Bride price\" and polygamy. A survey of other cross-cultural samples has confirmed that the absence of the plough was the only predictor of polygamy, although other factors such as high male mortality in warfare (in non-state societies) and pathogen stress (in state societies) had some impact."]}, {"page": "Polygyny", "response": ["Anthropologist Jack Goody's comparative study of marriage around the world, using the Ethnographic Atlas, demonstrated a historical correlation between the practice of extensive shifting horticulture and polygyny in many Sub-Saharan African societies.

This favored polygamous marriages in which men sought to monopolize the production of women \"who are valued both as workers and as child bearers.\" Goody, however, observes that the correlation is imperfect, and also describes more traditionally male-dominated though relatively extensive farming systems such as those common in much of West Africa, particularly the savanna region,  where more agricultural work is done by men, and polygamy is desired more for the production of male offspring whose labor in farming is valued.Goody, Jack.

Subhash Kak disagrees with the proposed Semitic origins of the script, instead states that the interaction between the Indic and the Semitic worlds before the rise of the Semitic scripts might imply a reverse process.Kak, S.

Evidence for a continuity between Indus and Brahmi has also been seen in graphic similarities between Brahmi and the late Indus script, where the ten most common ligatures correspond with the form of one of the ten most common glyphs in Brahmi.Kak, S.

Salomon considered simple graphic similarities between characters to be insufficient evidence for a connection without knowing the phonetic values of the Indus script, though he found apparent similarities in patterns of compounding and diacritical modification to be \"intriguing.\" However, he felt that it was premature to explain and evaluate them due to the large chronological gap between the scripts and the thus far indecipherable nature of the Indus script.", "Jack Goody (1987) had similarly suggested that ancient India likely had a \"very old culture of writing\" along with its oral tradition of composing and transmitting knowledge, because the Vedic literature is too vast, consistent and complex to have been entirely created, memorized, accurately preserved and spread without a written system."]}, {"page": "Clerical celibacy", "response": ["* Jack Goody 1983 The Development of the Family and Marriage in Europe (Cambridge University Press)"]}, {"page": "Raksha Bandhan", "response": ["** 1990, Jack Goody \"The ceremony itself involves the visit of women to their brothers ... on a specific day of the year when they tie a gaudy decoration on the right wrists of their brothers, which is at once \"a defence against misfortune, a symbol of dependence, and a mark of respect.\"", "Scholars who have written about the ritual, have usually described the traditional region of its observance as north India; however, also included are: central India, western India and Nepal, as well other regions of India, and overseas Hindu communities such as in Fiji.
