The symptoms described have remained unchanged. The cause was thought to be brought on by dampness, cold weather, and foggy conditions, and treatments were aimed towards various cough mixtures, respiratory stimulants, and tonics. It was noted that something other than the weather was thought to be at play. Exacerbations of the condition were also described at this time. Another physician Harry Campbell was referred to who had written in the British Medical Journal a week before. Campbell had suggested that the cause of chronic bronchitis was due to toxic substances, and recommended pure air, simple food, and exercise to remove them from the body."]}, {"page": "Harry Campbell", "response": ["Harry Campbell may refer to:", "*Harry Campbell (footballer, born 1867) (1867\u20131915), Scottish footballer", "*Harry Campbell (footballer, born 1995), football goalkeeper", "*Harry Campbell (boxer) (1938\u20131961), American lightweight boxer", "*Harry Campbell (physician) (1860-1938), British physician", "*\"Harry Campbell and the Heavies\", a song by Billy Connolly from the album Transatlantic Years"]}, {"page": "Bickiepegs", "response": ["#REDIRECT Harry Campbell (physician)"]}]}}
