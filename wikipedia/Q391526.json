The original tortoise, who resided at the college for at least 43 years, was known as Rosa, named after the Marxist Rosa Luxemburg.  Each June, pet tortoises from various Oxford colleges are brought to Corpus Christi College where they participate in a very slow race; Balliol's own Rosa competed and won many times.  Rosa disappeared in the Spring of 2004, and while numerous conspiracy theories abounded, none is officially recognised by the college.  However, on 29 April 2007, Chris Skidmore, a graduate of Christ Church working at the House of Commons, donated a pair of tortoises - one to his own college, and one to Balliol, where he had attended an open day in 1999.  The new tortoise, Matilda, died in April 2009.  Taking care of the resident tortoise is one of the many tasks assigned to Balliol students each year.  This position, known as \"Comrade Tortoise\", has been filled by a student every year."]}, {"page": "List of current members of the British Privy Council", "response": ["| Chris Skidmore"]}, {"page": "Roger Berry", "response": ["Berry lost his seat to Conservative Party candidate Chris Skidmore in the 2010 General Election. The seat was not very high among the Tory targets, and his unseating was the result of a swing of nearly 10% in favour of the Tories, with Labour Party officials blaming his defeat on a restructuring of constituency boundaries which were seen to favour the Tory vote. Under the average swing of 3.7% in that election, Labour would have held the seat."]}, {"page": "Institute of Economic Affairs", "response": ["Cabinet ministers and MPs (notably Michael Gove and Liz Truss) spoke at the organisation's launch.

Chris Skidmore concurs with this in his 2010 book Death and the Virgin: Elizabeth, Dudley and the Mysterious Fate of Amy Robsart, adding that Robert Dudley used the oak as a personal symbol in his youth,Skidmore 2010 p. 21 the sitter wearing oak leaves and gillyflowers at her breast. Recently a point has been made of the fact that the sprig of yellow flowers at the lady's breast corresponds with the colours of the Robsart coat of arms, green and yellow, or Vert and Or. The name gilliflower or gillyflower derives from the French girofl\u00e9e from Greek karyophyllon meaning nut-leaf, the association deriving from the flower's scent, making it another possiple wordplay for oak for Robert or even Robsart, Robur being Latin for oak. A portrait miniature of the same woman was sold at Sotheby's in 1983 by the Duke of Beaufort, a direct descendant of Lettice Knollys, who was the second wife of Amy's widower Robert Dudley.", "A few modern historians have considered murder as an option. Alison Weir has tentatively suggested William Cecil as organizer of Amy Dudley's death on the grounds that, if Amy was mortally ill, he had the strongest murder motive and that he was the main beneficiary of the ensuing scandal.Weir 1999 p. 109 Against this idea it has been argued that he would have risked damaging neither Elizabeth's reputation nor his own position.Gristwood 2007 p. 119; Skidmore 2010 p. 357 The notion of Sir Richard Verney killing Amy Robsart after long and fruitless efforts to poison her (with and without his master's knowledge) has been revived by George Bernard and by Chris Skidmore on the basis that Verney appears in both the c.\u00a01563 chronicle by John Hales (also called Journal of Matters of State) and the 1584 libel Leicester's Commonwealth.Bernard 2000 pp. 169\u2013174; Skidmore 2010 p. 355 This coincidence has as often been evaluated as no more than a tradition of gossip,Adams, Archer, and Bernard 2003 p. 66; Adams 2011 poison being a stock-in-trade accusation in the 16th century.Gristwood 2007 p. 97", "That Robert Dudley might have influenced the jury has been argued by George Bernard, Susan Doran, and by Chris Skidmore. The foreman, Sir Richard Smith (mayor of Abingdon in 1564/1565), had been a household servant of Princess Elizabeth and is described as a former \"Queen's man\" and a \"lewd\" person in Hales' 1563 chronicle, while Dudley gave a \"Mr. Smith\", also a \"Queen's man\", a present of some stuffs to make a gown from in 1566; six years after the inquest.Doran 1996 pp. 228; Bernard 2000 pp. 170\u2013171; Skidmore 2010 pp. 369\u2013370 It has, however, not been established that Sir Richard Smith and the \"Mr. Smith\" of 1566 are one and the same person, Smith being a \"very common\" name.Doran 1996 p. 228; Bernard 2000 p. 171 Susan Doran has pointed out that any interference with the jury could be as easily explained by the desire to cover up a suicide rather than a murder."]}, {"page": "Bow Group", "response": ["| Chris Skidmore "]}, {"page": "Kingswood (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["Kingswood is a constituency represented in the House of Commons of the UK Parliament since 2010 by Chris Skidmore, a Conservative.", "| Chris Skidmore"]}, {"page": "List of Parliamentary constituencies in Avon", "response": ["|Chris Skidmore\u2020"]}, {"page": "Skidmore (surname)", "response": ["* Chris Skidmore (born 1981), British politician", "* Chris Skidmore (cricketer) (born 1991), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Priti Patel", "response": ["Along with fellow Conservative MPs Kwasi Kwarteng, Dominic Raab, Chris Skidmore and Liz Truss, Patel was considered one of the \"Class of 2010\" who represented the party's \"new Right\".
