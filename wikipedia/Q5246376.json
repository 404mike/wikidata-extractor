Stevenage took the lead five minutes before the interval, Darius Charles heading in from close range after Michael Bostwick's looping header was guided towards goal. Bostwick was sent-off twenty minutes into the second-half, receiving a second bookable offence for a foul on Mark Allott. The home side equalised late on when Jack Lester headed in Dean Morgan's cross. Three days later, Stevenage earned their first win of the season, securing a 3\u20131 away victory against Bournemouth. Stevenage took the lead shortly before half-time, Craig Reid's quick turn and shot beating Shwan Jalal in the Bournemouth goal after Lawrie Wilson's threaded ball beat the offside trap.

The away side took the lead once more with half an hour remaining, John Mousinho scoring from the penalty spot after Bournemouth captain Adam Barrett handled Stacy Long's shot on the line, receiving a red card in the process for denying a goalscoring opportunity. Stevenage doubled their advantage in injury-time when Chris Beardsley latched on to Scott Laird's pass and beat Jalal with a first time finish.

The game ended up being one of the toughest wins of the season, with Wednesday winning 2\u20131 after a first-half goal from almost nothing by Jonathan Obika gave Yeovil Town the lead, but Jermaine Johnson's shot from 25-yards equalised and then the other Johnson, Reda Johnson added another goal to the season with ten-minutes to go to win the game. In such an important part of the season, where points are so vital, there was a mid-week distraction for The Owls in the FA Cup replay against Blackpool, many changes were made and proved costly as The Owls went down 0\u20133, all goals coming in the first-half. Although Gary Megson did not see this as an unfortunate happening when Sheffield Wednesday were knocked out at the fourth round replay stage. Back to their only competition left, the League One they were away to relegation-threatened Exeter City, and although Wednesday were second in the league they had played two extra games than some of the teams around them, the most threatening of which was Sheffield United. Therefore, it was more important to get maximum points in the games in hope they can get far enough ahead that the games in hand Sheffield United and other teams have would not be enough to catch them. Having struggled the previous game but still came out with a win, Jermaine Johnson scored is fourth goal in as many matches when he struck in the second-half, however two minutes later on the sixty-eighth minute, Billy Jones equalised for Exeter City, before David Noble scored with six minutes to go and ending the game in a 2\u20131 loss for Wednesday. This gave teams around them a chance to catch up and Sheffield United were now one point behind them and their city rivals had two games in hand, meaning if they won those they would be five points clear in second, and probably ending any hopes Sheffield Wednesday had of automatic promotion. However, their next game was at home in Sheffield Wednesday's first mid-week home fixture of the season, and having only being beaten once at home against top of the table The Owls were hoping to bounce back. With city rivals Sheffield United breathing closely down Wednesday's backs, Sheffield Wednesday were hoping they would slip up on the same night as they played tough opposition against fourth place Huddersfield Town. However, it was a night to forget for Sheffield Wednesday as a goal from Scott Laird on the stroke of half-time saw The Owls lose for the second time at home this season against Stevenage and meanwhile Sheffield United won Huddersfield Town away 0\u20131. This meant Wednesday's city rivals went two points ahead with two games in hand. After three losses on the bounce in all competitions Sheffield Wednesday came across North Derbyshire rivals Chesterfield away. Chesterfield were second-to-bottom of the league, but in a derby game form usually 'goes out of the window'. Sheffield Wednesday conceded a penalty on the seventy-eighth minute that Dean Morgan finished and ended the game 1\u20130 to Chesterfield. Sheffield United won again and with it being the later stages of the season Sheffield Wednesday felt their automatic promotion chances were gone and rivals Sheffield United would beat them to it. Sheffield Wednesday in such a poor run of form, their poorest of the season, it could not have come at a worse time for the club as they face Sheffield United in the Steel City derby at the last weekend of February. Meanwhile, Gary Megson had signed Michail Antonio from Reading on loan until the end of the season after other winger Jermaine Johnson had been put aside injured. Rumours in the media had been suggesting that Gary Megson was not going to last much longer as manager of the club, although Wednesday fans dismissed this as the club still had the chance of getting promoted as they were third in the league even though the club had lost their last four matches in all competitions. Sheffield United were clear favourites having won their last three games, but saw themselves all level at 0\u20130 at half-time. A surprisingly even contest saw Sheffield Wednesday just having the better of the play in the second half in front of the largest crowd of the season of over 36,000. Then quite amazingly a ball down the right-hand side by debutant Michail Antonio saw Lewis Buxton cross the ball into the box first time and Chris O'Grady headed into the back of the net. The Sheffield Wednesday supporters went crazy and all the players went to celebrate with supposedly under-pressure manager Gary Megson. Although having conceded late goals in the past Wednesday went on to win 1\u20130. However, after that win Sheffield United were two points ahead of Sheffield Wednesday and if they won their games in hand it could potentially be eight points, leaving Sheffield Wednesday still with hardly any hope of reaching the automatic promotion spot. Mid-week saw Sheffield United win one of their games in hand to put them five points clear and that same night probably the most surprising and shocking news of the season was confirmed, Sheffield Wednesday manager Gary Megson had been sacked."]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Chesterfield F.C. season", "response": ["|= ||FW || ||17 ||Dean Morgan || 3 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 4", "|Dean Morgan", "| Dean Morgan"]}, {"page": "2005\u201306 Luton Town F.C. season", "response": ["The club began pre-season with a mini-tournament in Bulgaria, losing to Bulgarian champions CSKA Sofia, and drawing with Cypriot Second Division club APEP.
