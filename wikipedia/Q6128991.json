Contributors include William Hazlitt, William Roscoe, John Bowring and Thomas Pringle; the enterprise appears to have been successful, at least enough to encourage an offer from John Murray, scion of the John Murray publishing house to purchase a half-share in the business. The offer was rejected; but a downturn in publishing and hence in advertising revenue for literary journals, and a need on Richard's part to return to his employers in India led him to enter into an agreement under which Henry Colburn would assume control of the journal in return for Richardson receiving a share in the profits of sales of the London Weekly Review. Colburn ingeniously renamed the publication as the Court Journal, and Richardson's anticipated rewards evaporated."]}, {"page": "Edward Edwards (librarian)", "response": ["After having been dismissed by two libraries, Edwards turned towards science, both in the fields of literature and librarianship.

The first volume containing the memoir, however, appeared almost simultaneously with that of James Augustus St. John and \"it was remarked with surprise that each biography appeared to be deficient in whatever gave interest to the other, and that the two would need to be blended to produce a really satisfactory work\"."]}, {"page": "Bayle St. John", "response": ["Bayle Frederick St. John (1822\u20131 August 1859)Date of birth and death at the Oxford Dictionary of National BiographyRobert J.
