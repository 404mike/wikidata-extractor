They were indifferently received by critics in his lifetime, but his fame grew rapidly after his death. By the end of the century he had been placed in the canon of English literature and become the inspiration for the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, with a strong influence on many writers; the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica described one ode as \"one of the final masterpieces\". Jorge Luis Borges called his first encounter with Keats's work an experience that he felt all of his life. It had a style \"heavily loaded with sensualities\", notably in the series of odes. Typically of the Romantics, he accentuated extreme emotion through emphasis on natural imagery. Today his poems and letters remain among the most popular and analysed in English literature. Especially acclaimed are \"Ode to a Nightingale\", \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\", \"Sleep and Poetry\" and the sonnet \"On First Looking into Chapman's Homer\".", "link_mentions": {}}}
