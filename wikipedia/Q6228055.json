Together with Brian Hogan he was the author of Smith & Hogan's Criminal Law, a leading undergraduate text on English criminal law. The book is now in its fourteenth edition (2015) and has been used as persuasive authority on crimes prosecuted in the law courts of England and Wales and elsewhere in the common law world. In 1998, Lord Bingham praised Smith; \"whom most would gladly hail as the outstanding criminal lawyer of our time.\" Smith and Hogan's Criminal Law is now edited by Professor David Ormerod QC.\nAlthough Smith won a scholarship to the University of Oxford to read history he never took it up, choosing to work on the railway instead. Smith's initial interest in law was developed whilst he was serving in the Royal Artillery; subsequently, he helped administer courts martial. After leaving the Army in 1947, Smith read law at Downing College at the University of Cambridge. In 1950, Smith was called to the English Bar Lincoln's Inn becoming an Honorary Bencher in 1977.\nSmith joined the Department of Law at the University of Nottingham in 1950. He was promoted to Professor of Law in 1957. For thirty years, Smith was influential in making Nottingham University one of the premier law schools in England and Wales. He also spent a year at Harvard University.\nDuring the 1960s Smith was a member of the Criminal Law Revision Committee. The resulting recommendations played an important part in the development of the Theft Acts of 1968 & 1978. Smith was an advocate for a criminal code of England and Wales (an English Criminal Code) working on a draft criminal code in the early 1980s, which was adopted by the Law Commission in 1989. The code has not yet been adopted, which, during his lifetime, was to the great disappointment of Professor Smith.\nSmith, who published prolifically as J.C. Smith, had a long association with the Criminal Law Review and wrote many case notes for that journal which were notable for their incisive, playful and amusing analysis.\nHe also wrote the book Criminal Evidence published by Sweet & Maxwell (1 June 1995).\nSmith was a fellow of the British Academy. He was made QC in 1973 and knighted in 1993.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of University of Nottingham people", "response": ["* Sir John Cyril Smith \u2013 lawyer"]}, {"page": "Cotherstone", "response": ["The jurist John Cyril Smith was born in the village in 1922.Andrew Ashworth, \u2018Smith, Sir John Cyril (1922\u20132003)\u2019, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, January 2007 accessed 2 May 2011"]}, {"page": "John C.

Mere lawful presence in a location is not enough to satisfy the conduct requirement; illegal trespass, however, is sufficient. John Cyril Smith has suggested that wilfully refusing to retract an inadvertent act that causes the victim to apprehend violence may constitute an assault by omission. It is arguable that there was once a rule that \"mere words\" could not constitute an assault, but the case of R v Ireland confirmed that even silent phone calls would be grounds for the charge of assault.Simester et al.
