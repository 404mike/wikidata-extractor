A product of the club's youth system, he signed his first professional contract in 2000 but saw his first season ravaged by injury and did not make his league debut in the 2001\u201302 season. In January 2002, he joined League of Ireland Premier Division side Longford Town on loan along with Richard Rose. Spiller came to the fore during the 2003\u201304 season when he was player of the season after a string of man-of-the-match performances. He finished the season by signing a contract keeping him at Priestfield Stadium until 2007. In 2004 West Ham tabled a bid of \u00a3750,000 for Spiller which was subsequently turned down by the Gillingham board.

With the help of a member of the Millwall coaching staff, however, he was taken on by Kent-based club Gillingham as a trainee.

He came on as a 76th-minute substitute for Richard Rose in a match which his team lost 3\u20131. He next played for the first team in an FA Cup defeat to Burnley on 24 January 2004, and went on to feature regularly in the team in March and April. In total he made two starts and eight substitute appearances during the 2003\u201304 season, but also continued to play for the youth team, helping them reach the last sixteen of the FA Youth Cup.
