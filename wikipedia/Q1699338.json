The Birch was used in place of the Red Special in the music videos for \"We Will Rock You\" however it was not used to record the song, and \"Spread Your Wings\". The guitar differs from the original in its all-maple construction and natural finish except for the back which is gold finished.

It is seen in Slade's (probably) first TV-performance in 1969. Lea got the bass in exchange for a Gibson EB-0 that he owned. The EB-3 was refinished in white when Lea had it in with John Birch to get some minor circuit and servicing work done to it. Lea said that he had only mentioned the refinish idea in passing, some time previously, then John Birch went ahead with it, without checking with him. After that bass was stolen in 1976 from the John Birch workshop, Lea's main bass was a very similarly styled custom-made sunburst John Birch bass, given as a replacement. He also carried a John Birch J2 bass as a backup bass on some tours. Other notable basses that Lea owns include a Jaydee bass (which, uncommonly for a bass guitar, has a tremolo arm fitted), a pre-1981 Gibson Flying-V bass (which was used a lot in the studio in the seventies).", "Slade often used hired/borrowed instruments in mimed TV performances. Lea used a Fender Precision Bass, Fender Jazz bass and a Rickenbacker style bass, made by John Birch, as well as a Shaftesbury replica of a 4001 bass for TV and video shoots."]}, {"page": "Dave Hill", "response": ["Though Hill is left-handed, he played and still plays guitar right-handed.

Later he moved to Ealing Strings on Ealing Common, London.() During this time Eccleshall still found time to make and repair guitars, eventually becoming so busy, especially with work on multiple instruments owned by Rory Gallagher, that he set up his own workshop and went into making guitars full-time. British guitar makers were virtually unheard of at the time, but Eccleshall was one of the first to win recognition, along with Tony Zemaitis and John Birch. Week after week the three were involved in a competition to get their outlandish guitar designs onto Top of the Pops during the heyday of British glam rock. Although his name is better known to insiders than to the general public, Eccleshall became well established as one of the world's leading guitar makers."]}]}}
