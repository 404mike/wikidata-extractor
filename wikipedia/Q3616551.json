The reference work The Bond Files by Andy Lane and Paul Simpson indicates that it was based upon a story Jenkins claimed he and Fleming had worked on around 1957, and that the storyline was set in South Africa and dealt with diamond smugglers and a spy ring and bore some resemblance to Fleming's Bond novel Diamonds Are Forever as well as his non-Bond work, The Diamond Smugglers. However, in an interview with Kiss Kiss Bang Bang magazine published in 2005, Peter Janson-Smith, Fleming's former literary agent and former chairman of Glidrose, claimed that he believed the story may have been about gold. This makes more sense, as the title derives from the line \"per fine Troy ounce\" or a variation of. A fine ounce is a Troy ounce of not quite pure gold. Jenkins' synopsis found by John Pearson in Fleming's papers featured gold bicycle chains, baobab tree coffins and the magical Lake Fundudzi\u2014presumably, Jenkins used some or all of these elements in the book itself. Four draft pages of the manuscript were discovered in 2005, in which we learn that the Double-O Section has been closed down and James Bond defies M on a matter of principle, resigning from MI6 to pursue his mission in South Africa alone."]}, {"page": "Mike Yates", "response": ["* \"Where the Heart Is\" by Andy Lane (Decalog 2: Lost Property)"]}, {"page": "Ace (Doctor Who)", "response": ["*Lucifer Rising by Jim Mortimore and Andy Lane", "*All-Consuming Fire by Andy Lane"]}, {"page": "Zoe Heriot", "response": ["*\"Fallen Angel\" by Andy Lane (Decalog)"]}, {"page": "Jamie McCrimmon", "response": ["*\"Fallen Angel\" by Andy Lane (Decalog)"]}, {"page": "James Bond, The Spy Who Loved Me", "response": ["In their guide The Bond Files, Andy Lane and Paul Simpson say Wood's novel \"counts as a decent Bond novel in its own right, and is certainly more stylish than many of the later volumes.\""]}, {"page": "Eighth Doctor Adventures", "response": ["|35 || The Banquo Legacy||Andy Lane and Justin Richards || June 2000"]}, {"page": "Lane (surname)", "response": ["*Andy Lane (born 1963), author and journalist"]}, {"page": "Justin Richards", "response": ["** Decalog 3, Consequences (1996) (editor, with Andy Lane)", "** Decalog 4, Re:generations (1997) (editor, with Andy Lane)", "** Dependence Day (Decalog 4, Re:generations, 1997) (with Andy Lane)", "** The Banquo Legacy (2000) (with Andy Lane)"]}, {"page": "Virgin Missing Adventures", "response": ["|16 || The Empire of Glass||Andy Lane||First||Steven, Vicki; plus Irving Braxiatel||November 1995"]}]}}
