Earlier in her career, as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Jarrow, she became a national figure when she played a prominent role in the 1936 Jarrow March of the town's unemployed to London to petition for the right to work. Although unsuccessful at that time, the March provided an iconic image for the 1930s and helped to form post-Second World War attitudes to unemployment and social justice.\nWilkinson was born into a poor though ambitious Manchester family and she embraced socialism at an early age. After graduating from the University of Manchester, she worked for a women's suffrage organisation and later as a trade union officer. Inspired by the Russian Revolution of 1917, Wilkinson joined the British Communist Party, and preached revolutionary socialism while seeking constitutional routes to political power through the Labour Party. She was elected Labour MP for Middlesbrough East in 1924, and supported the 1926 General Strike. In the 1929\u201331 Labour government, she served as Parliamentary Private Secretary to the junior Health Minister.  She made a connection with a young female member and activist Jennie Lee. Following her defeat at Middlesbrough in 1931, Wilkinson became a prolific journalist and writer, before returning to parliament as Jarrow's MP in 1935. She was a strong advocate for the Republican government in the Spanish Civil War, and made several visits to the battle zones.\nDuring the Second World War, Wilkinson served in Churchill's wartime coalition as a junior minister, mainly at the Ministry of Home Security where she worked under Herbert Morrison. She supported Morrison's attempts to replace Clement Attlee as the Labour Party's leader; nevertheless, when he formed his postwar government, Attlee appointed Wilkinson as Minister of Education. By this time, her health was poor, a legacy of years of overwork. She saw her main task in office as the implementation of the wartime coalition's 1944 Education Act, rather than the more radical introduction of comprehensive schools favoured by many in the Labour Party. Much of her energy was applied to organising the raising of the school-leaving age from 14 to 15. During the exceptionally cold weather of early 1947, she succumbed to a bronchial disease, and died after an overdose of medication, which the coroner at her inquest declared was accidental.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Clement Attlee", "response": ["As Prime Minister, Attlee appointed Hugh Dalton as Chancellor of the Exchequer, Ernest Bevin as Foreign Secretary, and Herbert Morrison as Deputy Prime Minister, with overall responsibility for nationalisation. Additionally, Stafford Cripps was made President of the Board of Trade, Aneurin Bevan became Minister of Health, and Ellen Wilkinson, the only woman to serve in Attlee's cabinet, was appointed Minister of Education. The Attlee government proved itself to be a radical, reforming government. From 1945 to 1948, over 200 public Acts of Parliament were passed, with eight major pieces of legislation placed on the statute book in 1946 alone.Rachel Reeves, and Martin McIvor. \"Clement Attlee and the foundations of the British welfare state\".

Over time, political differences separated the women MPs; by 1931 Astor became hostile to female Labour members such as Susan Lawrence.Sykes (1984), pp. 266\u201367, 354, 377Masters (1981), p. 137"]}, {"page": "1926 United Kingdom general strike", "response": ["* Ellen Wilkinson's 1929 novel Clash focuses on a woman activist's involvement with the strike.\"Ellen Wilkinson's first novel, Clash, explores the playing out of this [class] war during the week of the General Strike in May 1926...\"  Nicola Wilson, Home in British Working-Class Fiction.

As a child Marie had met Francis Galton, one of the founders of modern eugenics, through her father. She joined the Eugenics Education Society in 1912 and became a life fellow in 1921. Clare Debenham in her 2018 biography of Stopes argues in Chapter Nine that she was a maverick eugenicist, who was shunned by the inner circle of the Eugenic Society. In 1934, she reflected: \"I am a Life Fellow and would have much more interest in the Eugenics Society if I had not been cold shouldered\".Archive letter to Cora Hudson 24 March 1934 (British Library, London, Marie C.

The houses are black, the ships are black, the sky is black, and if you go there for an hour or two, reader, you will be black\".Newcastle Chronicle, June 1858, quoted in Wilkinson, p. 72 According to Wilkinson, the yard's founder, Sir Charles Palmer, \"regarded it as no part of his duty to see that the conditions under which his workers had to live were either sanitary or tolerable\".Wilkinson, p. 73", "Following the Palmer's closure, a small hope of relief and some industrial resurrection was offered by the industrialist Sir John Jarvis, who held the ceremonial office of High Sheriff of Surrey.  He was the prospective Conservative candidate for Guildford.   On 4 October 1934, Jarvis announced the \"adoption\" of Jarrow by the county of Surrey, and promised to bring new industries to the town; he mentioned ship-breaking, bottle manufacture and furniture-making.  While acknowledging the generous principle behind Jarvis's scheme, Betty Vernon (biographer of Jarrow politician Ellen Wilkinson) described it as ultimately superficial, offering little more than patchwork assistance.Betty Vernon, p. 148 Blythe observes: \"This excellent man failed, as anyone must fail who tries to play the good squire to a town of nearly forty thousand people\".Blythe, p. 189", "===Ellen Wilkinson===", "thumb|Ellen Wilkinson marching with the Jarrow Marchers, Cricklewood, London", "In the  1931 general election, in the nationwide rout of Labour, the Jarrow constituency was won by the National Government's candidate, William Pearson,  a Conservative borough councillor and former mayor.
