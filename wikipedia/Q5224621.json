He regularly played about ten different roles for the company over these years, including the Pirate King in The Pirates of Penzance, Dick Deadeye in H.M.S. Pinafore, and the title character in The Mikado, which he played more than 3,000 times.  Fancourt was famous for his melodramatic style, creating the controversial Mikado laugh that was later adopted by some of his successors.  His performances are preserved in nineteen of the company's recordings made between 1923 and 1950.", "link_mentions": {}}}
