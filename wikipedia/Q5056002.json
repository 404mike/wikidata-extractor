He found the net fairly regularly during his one season at The Dell, scoring nine goals in 23 league appearances, thus becoming top-scorer for the 1911\u201312 season. He had problems settling in the south, however, and in March 1912 was suspended (along with Andrew Gibson) for a serious breach of club discipline, as a result of which he was placed on the transfer list. Following his departure Saints tried several players at centre forward including Cecil Christmas and Leonard Dawe before finally settling on Percy Prince."]}, {"page": "List of people from Hampshire", "response": ["*Cecil Christmas, footballer, was born in Southampton"]}]}}
