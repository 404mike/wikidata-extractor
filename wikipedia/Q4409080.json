The character was described by Oberman as being like Angie \"but with 15 more years of feminism behind her\", and was hailed by the TV editor of the Evening Standard as \"the only strong woman left in Walford\". She became well known for her deviousness and \"scheming\", echoing the traits of her husband, with the official EastEnders website characterising her as \"happy to play mind games\" and \"often two steps ahead\" of Den. As part of the Watts family and the last of its major members to have appeared on the show, Chrissie's storylines explored her tumultuous marriage to Den; bonding with his adopted daughter Sharon (Letitia Dean) and her two half-siblings, Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman) and Vicki Fowler (Scarlett Alice Johnson); conspiring with Den to retake ownership of The Queen Victoria public house; forming a relationship with her boyfriend Jake Moon (Joel Beckett) after Den's murder; attempting to sell the Queen Vic Jake's gangland boss Johnny Allen (Billy Murray) and local businessman Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt); being blackmailed by young wayward Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner); and feuding with the rival Mitchell family. During her time on the show, Chrissie sparked numerous clashes with other female characters - such as her archenemy Sam Mitchell (Kim Medcalf); Stacey's cousin Kat (Jessie Wallace); Phil's girlfriend Kate Morton (Jill Halfpenny); Kat's daughter Zoe (Michelle Ryan); and Sam's mother Peggy (Barbara Windsor). It was noted by Oberman herself that Chrissie \"had more fights on EastEnders than most women have in their whole lives\", and was constantly scheming against those who got in her way - thereby earning her the sobriquet of \"super-bitch\".", "As Chrissie settles herself in the square and recoups her marriage with Den, she manages to bond with his children by getting along with Dennis; helping out Vicki with her plans to enter fashion school; and working with Sharon in the management of their nightclub called \"Angie's Den\" \u2014 which Chrissie quickly learns is partly named after Den's deceased first wife Angie (Anita Dobson). She soon befriends an locally ex-policewoman, Kate Morton (Jill Halfpenny), and the two work together as hairdressers in her nail salon. However, this does not last when Chrissie discovers that Den has been sleeping with Kate \u2014 which confirms her earlier suspicions about Den and his monogamous habits, despite his attempts to convince her that she is mistaken. Chrissie later exacts revenge on Kate by offering to give her a haircut, only to end up hacking most of her hair. She then proceeds to smash up the beauty salon in a rage, and slaps Kate that results in the pair fighting \u2014 which Den breaks up moments later; Chrissie promptly slaps Den and confronts him over his \"dirty little secret\". As she goes to leave the salon, Chrissie runs into Kate's boyfriend Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) and tells him that Den is Kate's \"mystery man\". She later departs Walford, distraught and hurt at Den's betrayal, but then returns due to being the co-owner of Kate's salon; ironically enough, Den has temporarily left the square to sort out his \"loose ends\" in Spain.", "In an interview with the official EastEnders website, Oberman detailed the background dynamic to Chrissie and Den's relationship as it existed before their appearance on the show: \"They were a real match for each other and ran a successful wine bar. The couple made a good team, but he was always going off with other women. She'd end up leaving him, but they'd always end up back together.\" Den's womanising and philandering nature was deliberately set against Chrissie's strong and forceful personality, and culminated on-screen in his affair with Kate Mitchell (Jill Halfpenny). The plot was praised by television editor Ru Green as being one of the \"better storylines\" during an otherwise weak year for the show, with media attention at the time profiling Chrissie's dramatic plans for revenge. The climax, which saw Chrissie cut off Kate Mitchell's hair in retribution for the affair, was a highlight for Oberman and an important dramatic milestone for her character: \"cutting off Jill Halfpenny's hair in the salon... was a really great episode.

Despite him and Gail planning to go to Canada and adopt the baby, Sarah gives birth to Bethany Platt (Amy and Emily Walton). In 1999, Martin becomes friendly with Rebecca Hopkins (Jill Halfpenny), and Gail accuses him of having an affair, but is reassured. Martin and Rebecca subsequently do have an affair, which Martin confesses to Gail only after Rebecca has left him.

Shepherd)."]}, {"page": "Gemma Atkinson", "response": ["Atkinson played the role of Hannah in the 2011 romantic comedy film How to Stop Being a Loser. The film also starred Richard E.
