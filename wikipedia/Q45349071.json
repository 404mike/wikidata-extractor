He also played in non-league football for Kettering Town and Dartford. He played as a centre forward or inside forward.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jimmy Loughlin", "response": ["Ahead of the 1929\u201330 season, the Coventry Telegraph speculated that, with the return to full fitness of Billy Kirton and Alf Widdowson, Loughlin would be competing with John Starsmore for the centre-forward position. Loughlin began the season in possession, but an injury in the opening match caused him to miss the next five fixtures. Returning at inside left with Starsmore in the centre, Loughlin scored Coventry's second goal in a 3\u20131 win away to Watford, and contributed five goals in the next five matches, but changes made to try and \"stop the rot\" of too many defeats meant he spent the next few weeks out of the team. Brought back into the team at the last minute for the home match against Gillingham on 23 November, he scored twice in a 5\u20130 win, and this time kept his place apart from two brief absences through injury. From 35 appearances in league and FA Cup, he scored 30 goals, which made him Coventry's top scorer by a distance; his 24 goals from 31 league matches helped his club finish sixth in the division."]}, {"page": "Jack Starsmore (footballer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Starsmore"]}, {"page": "Starsmore, John", "response": ["#redirectJohn Starsmore"]}]}}
