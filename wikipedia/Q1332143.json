In this procedure the 'ball' part of the hip joint (femoral head) and a portion of its neck are removed and the 'socket' part (acetabulum) is grated in preparation.  These are replaced with an artificial ball and socket with a long stem in the thigh bone. This and other designs of THRs have since transformed the quality of life of millions of old patients with severe hip arthritis. Because these devices contained polyethylene as one of the rubbing surfaces, Charnley was justifiably very wary of using it in young patients. He warned against the use of a THR in any young patient unless there were other physical restraining factors which would stop her/him from getting back to high activity levels. True to his prediction when these THRs were used in young patients they failed early even in the best centres on the world, including Charnley's own centre at Wrightington Hospital in the UK. The Swedish Hip Register shows that in young patients, 19% of THRs failed 10 years after the operation and 67% had failed by 16 years.Henrik Malchau, Peter Herberts, Peter S\u00f6derman, Anders Od\u00e9n, Department Of Orthopaedics, G\u00f6teborg University, Sweden., www.jru.orthop.gu.se Because these patients are young, early failure implies the need for repeated revision operations using progressively more invasive and more complex devices. It was therefore always attractive to surgeons to employ a bone conserving procedure in young patients initially. When they need a revision there is more useful bone preserved to fix the new device to.", "McMinn was also invited to deliver the 2008 Sir John Charnley Lecture at the British Orthopaedic Association and the 2008 Sir Robert Jones Lecture at the New York University Hospital for Joint Diseases in New York City, USA.
