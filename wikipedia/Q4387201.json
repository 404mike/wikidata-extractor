The genus was named in honour of Erasmus Darwin, grandfather of Charles Darwin by Edward Rudge in 1816. Most darwinias grow to a height of between , and many are prostrate shrubs. Most have small, simple leaves and the flowers are often grouped together, each flower with five red, white or greenish petals and ten stamens. In many species, the flowers are surrounded by large, colourful bracts, giving rise to their common names.", "The genus Darwinia was first formally described by Edward Rudge in 1816 and the type species is Darwinia fascicularis. Rudge published his description in Transactions of the Linnean Society of London. There are about 70 species but many have not been formally described.

The church was significantly rebuilt in about 1470, replacing the earlier church.  From 1659 it ceased to have its own vicar and was served by the clergy of All\u00a0Saints.  The fabric of the church deteriorated and by the winter of 1718 it had become unusable.  Repairs started in 1737, but these were done badly, and the roof collapsed in 1800.  The church was abandoned.  In the early 19th\u00a0century, Edward Rudge commissioned the architect Harvey Eginton, who carried out a major re-building in 1836\u201337. This included adding a north aisle in a similar style to the south aisle, and rebuilding the roof.  During the 20th\u00a0century, the size of the congregation declined.
