He played first-class cricket for five years, appearing for Kent County Cricket Club. He was Kent's captain for the last three years of his career before retiring at the end of the 1951 season. He was President of MCC in 1977\u201378.During World War II he was a parachute instructor at Ringway during the formation of the British Airborne Forces, and was then attached to 2nd Battalion the Parachute Regiment, with whom he fought in North Africa, Sicily and Italy. During the attack on Sicily his glider landed in the sea and he swam to shore with 3 other survivors. He was then posted to HQ 1st Airborne Division and ended up at the bridge in Arnhem with 2 Para, where he was eventually taken prisoner. A modest man, he never mentioned his wartime service.He is likely to be best remembered for chairing the committee set up by the MCC in 1965 to \"examine the future of county cricket in the widest possible terms and if thought fit to recommend alterations in the structure and playing conditions of the County Championship\". The first-class counties rejected most of the recommendations made in the so-called \"Clark Report\", including those for reducing the County Championship to sixteen games and introducing a new one-day league, also of sixteen games. However, before many years had passed changes not dissimilar to these would be introduced. According to Mike Turner, a member of the Clark committee: \"We started the ball rolling. The Clark Report was a great stimulus for fresh thinking.\"Clark was the tour manager of the 1970-71 English Ashes tour of Australia. The England fast bowler John Snow wrote that the tour \"emphasised the gulf between players and administrators\" and \"I was sick of the biased attitude and incompetence which was apparent in cricket administration\". Clark was described by the England captain Ray Illingworth as \"an amiable, but somewhat ineffectual man\" and there were soon divisions between him and the players.\nJohn Snow had bowled over 50 eight-ball overs in the First Test and was rested for the state match against Western Australia, but Clark insisted that he practice in the nets with the others. Snow bowled a couple of desultory overs and Clark berated him for five minutes after which Snow told him \"that as far as my good conduct money was concerned he could swallow it\" and went walkabout until the next day. Ray Illingworth smoothed things over, but after the Second Test Clark criticized both captains for cautious play, England for their short-pitched bowling and indicated that he would prefer to see Australia win 3-1 than see four more draws. Ray Illingworth only discovered this when he was asked for a comment by a journalist in the morning and the rest of the team when they read the newspapers at the airport. As a result, Illingworth effectively took over the running of the tour with the support of the players and Clark's influence declined.Clark's only ally was the vice-captain Colin Cowdrey, also from Kent, who became isolated as a result. In the final Test at Sydney, Clark tried to push Illingworth back onto the field when he took the team off because of the crowd throwing beer cans after the Snow\u2013Jenner incident. A furious Illingworth said he would not return until the playing area had been cleared and the crowd had calmed down and objected to Clark constantly siding with the Australians against his own team. When the team returned to England, Illingworth said that \"all hell would break loose\" if anyone was denied his good conduct bonus, but this did not happen. However, Geoffrey Boycott and John Snow had to report to Lord's for a dressing down by the MCC Secretary Billy Griffith for their behaviour.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Colin Cowdrey", "response": ["Cowdrey made his first first-class century in 1951, 143 for the Free Foresters vs Oxford University, soon followed by 106 for the Gentlemen vs Players at Scarborough, captained by Len Hutton with Alec Bedser leading the bowling. After the match, the former Yorkshire captain Brian Sellers told him \"If you are not playing for England and on that boat to Australia there'll only be one person to blame\".Cowdrey, p. 54 He made 1,189 runs (33.02) in the 1951 season and was awarded his county cap by captain David Clark after making 71 against the touring South Africans, at 18 the youngest man to be capped by Kent. ", "Cowdrey's return to the England team fueled speculation that he was to resume the captaincy from Illingworth, but he did not and in the Third 'Test' he was told that his rival would be made captain for the Australian tour. He was willing to accompany him as a player, but had to think about being vice-captain again as he thought a younger man should be chosen. In the end he accepted in order to help his Kent teammate David Clark with the administration. ", "Cowdrey was made vice-captain for an Australian tour for the fourth time and Illingworth's tough no-nonsense approach to the game clashed with the MCC tour manager David Clark, who had been captain of Kent in Cowdrey's youth and had given him his county cap.

The rotund Cowdrey was in the sunset of his career and failed on tour, making only one century \u2013 101 against Victoria \u2013 which was so slow that he was likened to a beached whale.Richard Whitington, Captains Outrageous?

Ray Illingworth won the toss and decided to field, but rain began to fall before the teams went out and after three days of continuous rain the match was abandoned without a ball being bowled. Desperate attempts to dry the boggy outfield were made by Ian Johnson and the MCG ground staff, who claimed that \"if the match had been in England the teams would have played. The outfield was good, the wicket firm and bowlers' run-ups safe\". Each day they announced that play would be able to start \"as soon as the rain stopped\" to encourage spectators to come to the ground.p 90-91, Snow One English writer said that the 8,000 people who arrived on the Thursday would have 'gladly paid a dollar each to permit the M.C.G. to buy a proper cover'.p 115, Whitington Sir Cyril Hawker, President of the MCC, and Gubby Allen, the treasurer, happened to be in Melbourne and with David Clark arranged the historic One Day International for the fifth day with Sir Donald Bradman and the Australian Board of Control.

Ray Illingworth and the England players were not consulted and only found out when Bradman came into the dressing room to thank them for their co-operation.p 89, Snow The players had severe misgivings about this state of affairs as the extra Test might cost them the Ashes and cancelled one of their rest days. They now had only five rest days in the last six weeks of the tour, and these included official receptions and engagements.
