Born in Darwen, Lancashire, he began his career with his hometown club, Darwen F.C., before moving to Manchester United in May 1921 in a \u00a3750 joint transfer that also brought George Haslam to Old Trafford. He made his debut in January 1922 in a 3\u20130 away defeat to Sheffield United, playing alongside Charlie Radford in the absence of Jack Silcock. Howarth played three more games that season, this time with Silcock in place of Radford, including a 3\u20132 win in the return fixture against Sheffield United. Manchester United were relegated at the end of the season, but although they used 29 players in the Second Division in 1922\u201323, Howarth never played for the club again.
