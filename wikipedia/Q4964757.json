He was the son of Joe Mears, also a chairman of Chelsea, and grandson of Joseph Mears, co-founder of the club. He was born in Richmond, Surrey, and educated at Malvern College. In 1950 he emigrated to Canada where he began working  life in a seed factory. He returned to the United Kingdom shortly afterwards and did his national service as a radio  operator in the Royal Air Force.Brian Mears took over as chairman following the death of Len Withey in 1969 and presided over the club's successful period in the early 1970s, when the FA Cup and Cup Winners' Cup were won in consecutive seasons. He remained in the position until 1981, when a boardroom coup d'etat led by Viscount Chelsea saw him removed with the club in a dire position both on and off the pitch, mainly a result of the disastrous attempt to redevelop Stamford Bridge during the 1970s. He sold the club to Ken Bates a year later for a nominal sum of \u00a31. Mears came under fire when his shares in the Stamford Bridge freehold were later sold to property developers Marler Estates; he insisted that it was his wife who controlled the shares.After leaving Chelsea, Mears relocated to the United States, where he was involved with several North American soccer teams and ran a car dealership in Long Beach, California. He wrote several books on Chelsea. Despite befriending Chelsea director Matthew Harding and chairman Bruce Buck in later years, he never set foot in Stamford Bridge again Mears married June Ware in 1955 and they had two children: a son, Christopher; and a daughter, Suzanne. Through Suzanne, Mears was the father-in-law to former footballer Steve Wicks and grandfather to Wicks' son Matt.\nMears died of heart failure on 28 July 2009.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Chelsea F.C.", "response": ["Chelsea Football Club were founded by Gus Mears in 1905. After his death in 1912, his descendants continued to own the club until 1982, when Ken Bates bought the club from Mears' great-nephew Brian Mears for \u00a31. Bates bought a controlling stake in the club and floated Chelsea on the AIM stock exchange in March 1996. In the mid-1990s Chelsea fan and businessman Matthew Harding became a director and loaned the club \u00a326\u00a0million to build the new North Stand and invest in new players."]}, {"page": "Eddie McCreadie", "response": ["Upon his retirement from playing in 1973, McCreadie joined the coaching staff at Chelsea having made 410 appearances for the club. In April 1975 he was appointed manager but by this stage the team was in decline with the club heavily in debt and he couldn't prevent relegation to the Second Division. Nevertheless, McCreadie re-built the side - taking the captaincy from John Hollins and giving it to 18-year-old Ray Wilkins in the process - and with no money to spend, put together a team of youth players and veterans from the club's heyday. Chelsea were promoted back to the First Division in 1977. It was then that he lost his job in somewhat bizarre circumstances. Having won promotion, his request for a company car was rejected by chairman Brian Mears, so he resigned. Mears then relented and offered him the car but with his sense of pride he did not come back to the club as he had already made his mind up."]}, {"page": "History of Chelsea F.C.", "response": ["Former left-back Eddie McCreadie became manager shortly before Chelsea's relegation in 1975 and, after a year of consolidation in 1975\u201376, led the side to promotion again in 1976\u201377 with a team composed of youth players, most notably Ray Wilkins and 24-goal striker Steve Finnieston, and veterans from more successful times like Cooke, Harris and Bonetti. But McCreadie left following a contract dispute with chairman Brian Mears over a company car and another ex-player was appointed, this time former right-back Ken Shellito."]}, {"page": "Mears", "response": ["*Brian Mears (born 1932), British author and former chairman of Chelsea Football Club"]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Chelsea F.C. season", "response": ["*28.07.09: Former Chelsea chairman Brian Mears passes away at the age of 78."]}, {"page": "Matt Wicks", "response": ["Wicks is the son of fellow footballer Steve Wicks and grandson of former Chelsea F.C. chairman Brian Mears."]}, {"page": "Deaths in July 2009", "response": ["*Brian Mears, 78, British Chairman of Chelsea Football Club (1969\u20131991)."]}, {"page": "List of Old Malvernians", "response": ["* Brian Mears, chairman of Chelsea FC"]}, {"page": "Mears, Brian", "response": ["#redirectBrian Mears"]}]}}
