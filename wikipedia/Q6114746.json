Cringan broke a collarbone in his first game, and was replaced by reserve left-back Jack Randle, who played four games before Smith, the second reserve, was drafted in for his debut at Derby County on 17 September 1932, which finished as a 2\u20132 draw. This was the first of a run of games, but when the experienced Barkas returned to the side Smith could not dislodge him.Matthews, p. 175."]}, {"page": "1928\u201329 Birmingham F.C. season", "response": ["Twenty-five players made at least one appearance in nationally organised competition, and there were twelve different goalscorers.
