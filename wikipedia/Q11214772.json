He was one of the few players who \u2013 at his request \u2013 was routinely known by his pseudonym, Felix. When his father died in 1824 he had inherited the running of his school, aged only nineteen, and he was afraid that the parents of pupils might think that cricket was too frivolous a pastime for a schoolmaster.\nFelix was a specialist left-handed batsman, although he did occasionally bowl underarm slow left-arm orthodox. He was a mainstay of the great Kent team of the mid-19th century alongside such players as Alfred Mynn, Fuller Pilch, William Hillyer and Ned Wenman. In the words of the famous elegy, best loved of Bernard Darwin,\n\nAnd with five such mighty cricketers 'twas but natural to win\nAs Felix, Wenman, Hillyer, Fuller Pilch and Alfred Mynn.Felix played for Kent from 1830 until 1852.  He also appeared for MCC sides and was a member of William Clarke's All-England Eleven.\nIn his overall first-class career, Felix played in 149 matches and scored 4,556 runs with a highest score of 113. He played at a time when prevailing conditions greatly favoured bowlers and was rated very highly as a batsman by his contemporaries.\nHe was the author of a famous instruction book: Felix on the Bat published in 1845. He also invented the catapulta (a bowling machine) as well as India-rubber batting gloves. A man of many talents, he was also a classical scholar, musician, linguist, inventor, writer and artist.\nFelix died at Wimborne Minster in Dorset and is buried in Wimborne cemetery.", "link_mentions": {}}}
