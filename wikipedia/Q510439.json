The women attended vivisections at University College London, and in 1903 published their diary, The Shambles of Science: Extracts from the Diary of Two Students of Physiology, which accused researchers of having vivisected a dog without adequate anaesthesia. The ensuing scandal, known as the Brown Dog affair, included a libel trial, damages for one of the researchers, and rioting in London by medical students.In 1906 Lind af Hageby co-founded the Animal Defence and Anti-Vivisection Society and later ran an animal sanctuary at Ferne House in Dorset with the Duchess of Hamilton. She became a British citizen in 1912, and spent the rest of her life writing and speaking about animal protection and the link between that and feminism. A skilled orator, she broke a record in 1913 for the number of words uttered during a trial, when she delivered 210,000 words and asked 20,000 questions during an unsuccessful libel suit she brought against the Pall Mall Gazette, which had criticized her campaigns. The Nation called her testimony \"the most brilliant piece of advocacy that the Bar has known since the day of Russell, though it was entirely conducted by a woman.\"\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of feminists", "response": ["|1875\u20131939||data-sort-value=\"Hageby, Lizzy Lind af\"|Lizzy Lind af Hageby||Sweden||1878||1963||||"]}, {"page": "Carol J.
