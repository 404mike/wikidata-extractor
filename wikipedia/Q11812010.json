Saunders did not gain his first aerial victory until 10 May 1918, destroying a German Pfalz D.III fighter aircraft. Six days later, an Albatros D.V fell to his guns over Beaulencourt, France. On 23 May, he shared with Captain James Belgrave in the destruction of another Albatros D.V over Fricourt. On 9 June, the two men accounted for two Hannover reconnaissance aircraft over Arras, setting one afire and driving the other down out of control, and Saunders was an ace. On 2 July 1918, Saunders fought his memorable action\u2013one which would be cited as a reason for awarding him the DFC. He dived 8,000 feet, leading an attack by his flight of six upon six German fighters. Saunders shot one Pfalz D.III down, and two others collided while evading his assault. Saunders was credited for all three. On 29 July he was appointed a flight commander with the temporary rank of captain, taking command of \"A\" Flight. On 1 August, Saunders vanquished one of the new Fokker D.VIIs, sending it out of control over Bapaume. A week later, it was the turn of a German reconnaissance two-seater to fall out of control over Chaulnes.
