A forward, he scored 59 goals in 221 games in the Football League.\nWith Port Vale between 1945 and 1958, a bright period of the club's history, he scored 56 goals in 196 appearances in league and cup competitions. He helped the club to the Third Division North title and the semi-finals of the FA Cup in 1953\u201354. He moved on to Mansfield Town in January 1958, before moving into non-league football with Stafford Rangers, Wellington Town, Sankeys, Macclesfield Town, Northwich Victoria, Nantwich Town and Wolstanton United. Griffiths died in August 2008, at the age of 78. He was survived by wife Nancy and daughter Valerie, grandchildren Andrea, Nicola, and Tracey, and five great-grandchildren. He died days apart from former teammate Selwyn Whalley.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Stafford Rangers F.C.", "response": ["|  Ken Griffiths"]}, {"page": "Griffiths", "response": ["* Ken Griffiths (1930\u20132008), English footballer", "* Ken Griffiths (photographer) (1945\u20132014), New Zealand born photographer"]}, {"page": "Norman Low", "response": ["Preparing for the Third Division South campaign in 1957\u201358, he said his team would \"fight like hell to get back into the Second Division\".

His team were third in the league by November, and he added to his squad with the signatures of Bert Carberry and Jack Wilkinson. However they then lost their form, and Low attempted to shake things up by selling Ken Griffiths to Mansfield Town and bringing in Noel Kinsey from Birmingham City for \u00a35,000.

Their achievements came as a team, without any outstanding stars, which caused The Sentinel to remark that the whole team were stars.", "On 3 October, Vale secured the biggest ever win at Vale Park when they beat York City 5\u20130. Seven days later Vale's clean sheet streak came to an end, though they still secured a 2\u20131 victory over Chesterfield at Saltergate; Cyril Hatton was the scorer for Chesterfield, though it proved not enough to save his team's unbeaten home record. Albert Mullard had a penalty kick saved towards the end of the game by goalkeeper Ron Powell, the only one of two penalties the club were awarded throughout the campaign. Vale then beat Tranmere Rovers 2\u20130 after their defence successfully contained the threat posed by the division's then-top scorer Cyril Done. The following week they won 1\u20130 at Halifax Town in a game where Ken Griffiths hit the woodwork three times.", "On 7 November, Vale conceded twice in one game for the first time in the season, as Peel Park saw their Accrington Stanley side achieve a 2\u20132 draw with the Vale. Vale lost a two-goal lead in the match, as Ian Brydon scored after the ball got stuck in the mud and then Les Cocker scored the equalising goal after Ray King failed to hold on to a shot. By this time Vale were building a significant point advantage over the rest of the league. On 28 November, Ken Griffiths scored a hat-trick as Vale 'tore apart' a poor Rochdale side 6\u20130, exceeding the record Vale Park win that had been set only two months earlier.", "The Fourth Round held First Division club Cardiff City in snowy conditions at Ninian Park. Vale won 2\u20130, and their victory was aided by the fact that Cardiff goalkeeper Ron Howells had to leave the pitch after 20 minutes after being knocked out following a collision with defender Derrick Sullivan, leaving his ten-man team to play 70 minutes with defender Alf Sherwood in goal. Vale attacked through the wings to get in numerous crosses to the box, from which Ken Griffiths and Albert Leake scored their goals. Centre-half Tommy Cheadle restricted centre-forward Trevor Ford to a quiet game, and at full-time the pair were full of bruises but still left the pitch with a handshake and a smile. Cardiff placed a \u00a325,000 transfer bid for winger Colin Askey, and after their offer was rejected Cardiff stated they were prepared to pay more than \u00a325,000, but Port Vale refused any negotiations. Other top clubs also made inquiries, but were all turned away.", "The 25,000 tickets Vale were allotted for the semi-final clash with West Bromwich Albion at Villa Park sold out on the first day. In all 100 coaches and 14 excursion trains took the supporters to Birmingham for the match on 27 March, at which time high-scoring West Brom were top of the First Division \u2013 in all 68,221 spectators packed into the stadium. This meant the match secured the club a total of \u00a320,086 in gate receipts. Ken Griffiths was unable to recover from a knee injury in time for the match and so was replaced by Derek Tomkinson, this was the first and only change to the first eleven throughout the cup run. In the match itself, Albion's 'constructive play' was halted by the Vale defence, and a Leake goal on 40 minutes saw Vale 1\u20130 up at half-time. The second half saw the \"Throstles\" switch to a long ball game, and on 62 minutes Cheadle was bustled off the ball and could only watch the equaliser cross the line. Eight minutes later captain Cheadle was judged to have fouled George Lee just inside the penalty box, though the Port Vale players maintained that the challenge took place well outside of the box, and that Lee also handled the ball. Former \"Valiant\" star Ronnie Allen converted the resulting penalty. Later in the match Leake had an equalising goal disallowed for offside, and Vale therefore failed to be the first third-tier club to reach an FA Cup Final.", "|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Ken Griffiths", "|3||FW||||Ken Griffiths||16||1||17"]}, {"page": "1954\u201355 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["In the FA Cup, the \"Valiants\" drew 2\u20132 with West Ham United at Upton Park after going two goals behind.
