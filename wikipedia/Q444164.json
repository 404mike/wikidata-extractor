In 1906 Outram Bangs suggested that because Linnaeus had wholly copied Catesby's text when coining C.\u00a0macroura, this name should apply to the passenger pigeon, as E.\u00a0macroura. In 1918 Harry C. Oberholser suggested that C.\u00a0canadensis should take precedence over C.\u00a0migratoria (as E.\u00a0canadensis), as it appeared on an earlier page in Linnaeus' book. In 1952 Francis Hemming proposed that the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) secure the specific name macroura for the mourning dove, and the name migratorius for the passenger pigeon, since this was the intended use by the authors on whose work Linnaeus had based his description. This was accepted by the ICZN, which used its plenary powers to designate the species for the respective names in 1955."]}, {"page": "1789", "response": ["* October 8 \u2013 William John Swainson, English naturalist, artist (d. 1855)"]}, {"page": "1855", "response": ["* December 6 \u2013 William John Swainson, English naturalist, artist  (b. 1789)"]}, {"page": "Serranidae", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by William John Swainson"]}, {"page": "List of biologists", "response": ["*William John Swainson (1789\u20131855), English ornithologist,Abbreviation in zoology: Swainson malacologist, conchologist, entomologist and artist"]}, {"page": "American dipper", "response": ["The American dipper was described by the English zoologist William John Swainson in 1827 and given the binomial name Cinclus mexicanus.
