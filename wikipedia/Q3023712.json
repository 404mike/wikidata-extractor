During this time Perl became interested in how the activity of C-fiber afferent neurons was transferred to the cerebral cortex, a project that proved difficult, but which influenced his interest in these unmyelinated afferent fibers and their then-presumed participation in the detection and transmission of pain and temperature sensations to the brain."]}, {"page": "List of honorary doctors of the University of Otago", "response": ["| 1969 || Derek Denny-Brown || DSc"]}]}}
