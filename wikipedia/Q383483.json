He spent time on loan at Darlington, Scunthorpe United, and Sheffield Wednesday, before signing for Sheffield Wednesday in 2004. He then joined rivals Barnsley in 2007, but only made three appearances for them before signing with Leeds United in the same year. After spending much of the 2007\u201308 season as an unused substitute, he began to establish himself as the first choice goalkeeper at Elland Road, impressing manager Gary McAllister with a series of good displays continuing into the following season. He made a number of appearances before being dropped in December, subsequently only appearing on the bench. He signed for Swindon Town in June 2009. Lucas had a successful season in which he played a major part in Swindon reaching the Football League One play-offs. Lucas' contract with Swindon was terminated one year early by mutual consent, and he signed a one-year deal with Rochdale on 3 August 2011, taking up a player/coach role. Lucas was released by Rochdale at the end of the season, before he signed a one-year contract with Championship club Birmingham City on 10 July 2012. He made one appearance before leaving when the January 2013 transfer window opened, to join League Two club Fleetwood Town, reuniting with former Preston North End teammates Graham Alexander, now manager of Fleetwood, and first team coach Chris Lucketti.\nLucas has played internationally for England, five times at under-18 and four times at under-20 level.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1977", "response": ["** David Lucas, English footballer"]}, {"page": "Lee Clark (footballer)", "response": ["On 26 June 2012, Clark was confirmed as manager of Birmingham City, with Terry McDermott as his Assistant Manager and Derek Fazackerley and Steve Watson as his First Team Coaches.

Clark signed Peter Lovenkrands, David Lucas, Hayden Mullins and Darren Ambrose in the summer of 2012, as well as Ravel Morrison, Ben Gordon, James Hurst, Leroy Lita, Paul Caddis, Paul Robinson, Rob Hall, Shane Ferguson and Wes Thomas later on throughout the 2012\u201313 season.", "Clark endured a difficult start to his managerial reign, with a draw and two losses in a row for his first three games in the Championship. His first win came against Peterborough but Birmingham suffered a 5\u20130 home defeat against Barnsley in September. During the January 2013 transfer window, Clark sold Jake Jervis, David Lucas and Jack Butland, who returned on loan for the remainder of the season. Clark struggled to get Birmingham out of the bottom half of the league until back to back wins against Derby County and Middlesbrough took them up to 12th place in March. Despite receiving criticism from fans for alleged poor management skills regarding public fallouts with Nikola Zigic, Clark has been praised for introducing academy players into the first team squad, players including Jack Butland, Will Packwood, Mitch Hancox, Callum Reilly, Koby Arthur and Reece Hales. Clark continued the start of 2013 with his team producing good form, including a 4\u20130 away win at Crystal Palace and back to back 1\u20130 wins against Bristol City and Leeds. After finishing the season in 12th place, 7 points off the play-offs, Clark made his first signings for the 2013\u201314 Championship season with Darren Randolph, Andrew Shinnie and Lee Novak all signing on free transfers, whilst Olly Lee's loan was made permanent. The 2013\u201314 season started poorly again for Clark, with Birmingham winning a single game in the league against Yeovil Town as the Blues made their worst start to a league season for 25 years. Despite poor results in the league (including an 18 home match run without a league win) and the removal from the coaching staff of Clark's right hand men Derek Fazackerley and Terry McDermott, Clark managed to keep Birmingham City in the Championship with an injury time equaliser from Paul Caddis in the final game of the 2013\u201314 season against Bolton, the 2\u20132 result being enough to keep the team up on goal difference."]}, {"page": "Jonathan Douglas", "response": ["On 21 May 2009 it was reported that Leeds would be offering him a new deal.

Arguably Boyd's best goal came against Sheffield Wednesday, on a cold, wet and windy Friday night at Victoria Park. With Hartlepool already 2\u20130 up, Boyd received the ball outside the box and faked his way past two players before curling a shot over Sheffield Wednesday goalkeeper David Lucas with the outside of his boot for his hat-trick.

Boyd ended the season strongly and scored a brace in the first leg of the play-off semi-final match against Tranmere Rovers. This helped to secure Hartlepool's place in the play-off finals for the first time to forge a reputation for his goalscoring exploits, which has won him admirers such as Alan Shearer. His teammates likened him to his childhood idol Dennis Bergkamp.Match 24\u201330 August, page 29.

To make matters worse, Boyd's injury treatment went badly as he contracted a blood infection, which resulted him being out for five months. Former manager Mike Newell, then of Luton Town, sought to take advantage of the effect that his injury had had on his value and made Hartlepool two offers thought to be of approximately \u00a3500,000 that the club quickly rejected.
