He is also considered the best singer/songwriter in the group; for example, he wrote and performed \"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life\" from The Life of Brian. Unlike Jones, he often played female characters in a more straightforward way, only altering his voice slightly, as opposed to the falsetto shrieking used by the others.
