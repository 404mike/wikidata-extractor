He was a director of the family firm along with his brothers John and Harry and its Managing Director from 1882 until his death. For a time he was also Chairman of the company. Chubb was knighted in 1885 and created a Baronet, of Newlands, in 1900. In 1927 he was further honoured when he was raised to the peerage as Baron Hayter, of Chislehurst in the County of Kent. George Chubb's middle name Hayter, (his grandmother's maiden name) was used for the Barony since at the time it was considered unacceptable for company names (albeit a family company) to be used in the House of Lords.\nLord Hayter married Sarah Vanner Early, daughter of Charles Early, in 1870. She died in 1940. They had three daughters and two sons. \nHayter survived her by six years and died in November 1946, aged 98. He was succeeded in his titles by his elder son, Charles.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Hayter Chubb, 1st Baron Hayter", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Chubb, 1st Baron Hayter"]}, {"page": "Sir George Chubb, 1st Baronet", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Chubb, 1st Baron Hayter"]}, {"page": "George Hayter Chubb", "response": ["#Redirect George Chubb, 1st Baron Hayter"]}, {"page": "George Chubb", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Chubb, 1st Baron Hayter"]}, {"page": "George Chubb (disambiguation)", "response": ["George Chubb, 1st Baron Hayter (1848\u20131946) was a British businessman."]}, {"page": "Chubb, George", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Chubb, 1st Baron Hayter"]}]}}
