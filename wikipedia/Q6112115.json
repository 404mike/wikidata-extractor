He was one of the early successes of Channel 5, winning an award as stand-in host of a late-night TV talk show usually presented by Jack Docherty. This was followed by a comic quiz show on Channel 5 called Bring Me the Head of Light Entertainment, which was not well received as a programme but enhanced Norton's reputation as a comic and host.

This is briefly interrupted when the doorbell rings and one character answers it to find a pesky dog (who is, in fact, a double-glazing salesman) before the other persuades him to enter into a game of shadow puppets. The first character is frustrated by his acquaintance's appalling representation of a cow and later his failure to recognize a rather fantastic rabbit (His misled guesses include a 'fireman chasing an igloo' and an 'Otter with two sausage strapped to his head'). After an amusing outburst from the poor fellow, his annoying partner accuses him of being 'shirty'. This leads him to explode, furiously crying \"I'm stuck indoors playing 'Guess the misshapen beast' with someone who clearly wouldn't recognise a rabbit if it came to his house for tea, said 'What's up Doc?' and started burrowing into his head! There are blind people with no fingers who are better at shadow puppets than you! No wonder I'm a tad miffed!\" An awkward silence follows this, until the doorbell rings and the first character goes to answer it and finds the second character's 'cow' shadow puppet, which moos. Despite being disappointed with being wrong about a cow's appearance, he simply responds to this with a cheery \"Not today, thank you.\" and closes the door in front of the camera, thus ending the animation.Best Animated Short: Best Animated Short -  1999", "* Jack Docherty"]}, {"page": "The Strangerers", "response": ["*Jack Docherty as Cadet Niven"]}, {"page": "53rd British Academy Film Awards", "response": ["The ceremony took place at the Odeon Leicester Square in London and was hosted by Jack Docherty."]}, {"page": "The One Show", "response": ["|22-26 August 2016 || colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| Patrick KieltyAlex Jones || colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| Jack DochertyAlex Jones", "* Jack Docherty (2016; 2 episodes)"]}, {"page": "Pappy's", "response": ["Pappy's most notable television showpiece is that of Badults which aired on BBC Three in 2013 and 2014, starring themselves along with Emer Kenny, Katherine Ryan, Jack Docherty and Cariad Lloyd."]}, {"page": "Moray Hunter", "response": ["Moray Hunter (born 6 October 1957, Hawick, Scotland) is a Scottish comedian, writer and performer.

Presented by comedian Jack Docherty, the programme was one of the first to air on the channel, doing so as part of its opening-night schedule on 30 March 1997. The show was recorded at London's Whitehall Theatre during the early evening and would then be broadcast in a late-night slot. It featured a mixture of chat with celebrity guests, comedy, and music, and followed a similar format to shows such as NBC's Late Night with David Letterman in the United States.", "Docherty was frequently absent from the programme, usually during school holidays, and when this happened the show was retitled Not The Jack Docherty Show and would be presented by a stand-in. Guest presenters included Phill Jupitus, Graham Norton, Fred MacAulay, Carol McGiffin, Melinda Messenger, Rich Hall and Tim Vine.

Docherty \u2013 who was also attending the ceremony \u2013 had expected to win the award himself. Norton went on to front his own series on Channel 4 in 1998 titled So Graham Norton.", "Channel 5 had originally wanted to call the show The Docherty Will See You Now, and when first on air it was broadcast five nights a week. However, as the series progressed numbers of episodes were reduced as the channel moved away from its original \"stripped and stranded\" scheduling format, and, in the first instance, because Docherty had requested he do fewer shows. From September 1997 it dropped to four nights a week when the Friday edition was withdrawn from the schedule, then three in March 1998 after Monday's episode was also dropped. By September 1998 the series dropped to a Tuesday and Thursday airing, while the Wednesday slot was then taken up with the somewhat similar Melinda's Big Night In, a chat show hosted by Melinda Messenger. One weekly episode of The Jack Docherty Show was aired during its last few months, before the final edition went out on 23 June 1999.", "The decreasing number of weekly editions also had much to do with the show's poor viewing figures. Often these would be higher when Docherty was absent, with model Melinda Messenger achieving higher viewing figures when she stood in for him. The show was also panned by critics, particularly when, in 1998, Docherty decided not to renew his contract with Channel 5 when it expired at the end of that year. In November 1998 a television reviewer in The Independent observed: \"In effect, The Jack Docherty Show (C5, Tue and Thur) is working out its notice. And boy, does it show. It's as if Docherty is perfunctorily doing his job even as the removal men are dismantling the show and packing it off to the archive. The house band has gone, the flats of the set have been taken down, and the script has been stowed at the bottom of a cardboard box file.\" This sentiment was echoed in the 19 February 1999 edition of Private Eye, which claimed that Docherty had closed one episode with the words, \"In line with Channel 5 policy, it's past eleven o'clock and time for some tatty pornography\", and had then simulated fellatio on a pizza salesman. The scene was edited out before broadcast in what Private Eye suggested was a decision influenced by criticism of Channel 5, which at the time included soft-core pornography in its schedule.
