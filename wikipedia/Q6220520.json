The building was demolished in 2010 by Westminster City Council.\nBancroft explained the design of the school in a 2008 interview: \"I wanted pupils to feel they were part of a community... So I divided the place up into a form of glass screen so you would get views down from the level you were at into the other parts of the school. And also I wanted to make sure that you could from time to time glimpse the outside so that you would know where you were in the great surrounding community that Pimlico is, and the buildings surrounding it\"His other school designs include the Elfrida Rathbone Girls' School in Camden and the Philippa Fawcett Teacher Training College in Streatham.\nBancroft was a staunch defender of the GLC's unpopular Brutalist landmarks.  Though he did not design it, he argued that the County Hall Island Block, vacant for 20 years, should have been listed as an early example of open plan office architecture and expressed himself \"quite horrified\" by the demolition of Pimlico School. Bancroft devoted much of his career to building conservation and was an active member of the Twentieth Century Society, the Victorian Society and an avid supporter of the charity Docomomo.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Brutalist architecture", "response": ["In the United Kingdom, architects associated with the Brutalist style include Ern\u0151 Goldfinger, wife-and-husband pairing Alison and Peter Smithson, some of the work of Sir Basil Spence, the London County Council/Greater London Council Architects Department, Owen Luder, John Bancroft, and, arguably perhaps, Sir Denys Lasdun, Sir Leslie Martin, Sir James Stirling and James Gowan with their early works.
