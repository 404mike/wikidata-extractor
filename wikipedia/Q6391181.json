In August 1978, the band were joined by Martin Cooper (saxophone), Andy McCluskey (lead vocals and bass, who was previously in the Id) and Kenny Peers (drums), along with poets Gordon Hon (aka \"The Worm\") and Max the Actor. In September, McCluskey quit to rejoin a former Id bandmate, Paul Humphreys, to form Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, and by October 1978, only Gill and Hughes remained in the band. As a duo, they signed to Inevitable Records. A demo of \"Freedom Fighters\" attracted the interest of Phonogram Records, who then signed them."]}, {"page": "Dalek I Love You (album)", "response": ["*Kenny Peers"]}]}}
