We just went in and played...and that's when you know you're playing really well, when you don't have to think about it.

Morris later recalled: \"They did my head in, completely and utterly. There you go. That's life.

According to Leckie, the band's compositional practices would regularly see them working until \"four a.m. every night\u00a0... they were quite a nocturnal band\u00a0... they didn't get much sleep. They smoked a lot of dope.\" The band's guitarist, Nick McCabe, favored a sound that \"was about the tape echo and the reverb\" in contrast to the prevailing orthodoxy of studio recording at the time, which he bemoaned as being \"still stuck in the aesthetics of 80s recording techniques.\" According to his bandmate Jones, McCabe \"didn\u2019t treat the guitar like a guitar... He didn\u2019t want to be a guitar hero. He wasn\u2019t into Jimmy Page... It was all about texture.\"", "The album has gone on to accumulate further praise in the years since its release and has been described by one publication as The Verve's \"masterpiece\" and a landmark in psychedelic rock. Rudi Abdallah, writing for Drowned in Sound, declared that the \"sounds explored on [A Storm in Heaven] are The Verve\u2019s true form, the intuitive sound with which they should be identified.\" Nick Southall's 2003 retrospective for Stylus Magazine described the album's genesis as a result of the band going \"into the studio with half a dozen riffs, half a dozen half-baked lyrics and a thousand ideas of ways to reach the sky. Leckie managed to seize the controls and apply the necessary degree of restraint and maturity, guiding the band back down to earth when they threatened to fly too close to the sun\". In September 2016, Ian King, writing for PopMatters, awarded the album nine out of ten and remarked, \"The greatest depth on A Storm in Heaven comes from the vaporous dreams that poured out of McCabe's guitar, traced patiently by Simon Jones' bass playing and Peter Salisbury's drumming. Though the Verve were able to compress their sound into radio-shaped singles \"Slide Away\" and \"Blue\", the most compelling compositions -- \"Already There\", \"Beautiful Mind\", \"Virtual World\"\u2014are those that are allowed to naturally ebb and flow in a zone somewhere between pop editing and the looser jamming of the material that turned up on their singles and EPs\".", "* Simon Jones \u2013 bass, backing vocals on \"Star Sail\""]}, {"page": "Howie Day", "response": ["While certain tracks on Australia had featured session musicians, Stop All The World Now saw Day joined for the first time by a permanent backing band, consisting of multi-instrumentalist Les Hall, drummer Laurie Jenkins, Drummer Mark Heaney, and ex-Verve bassist Simon Jones.
