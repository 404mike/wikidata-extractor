He is best known as presenter of the BBC miniseries Chased by Dinosaurs, its sequel, Sea Monsters, as well as the ITV miniseries Prehistoric Park. He is also known for his unorthodox, spontaneous, and daring style of presenting wildlife documentaries as well as for including factual knowledge in the proceedings. This has led some people to compare him to Steve Irwin. Nigel ran the 2008 London marathon in 4 hours and 4 minutes to try to raise \u00a320,000 for the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society UK.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Way We Went Wild", "response": ["*Nigel Marven"]}, {"page": "King of the Jungle (TV series)", "response": ["King of the Jungle is an American reality television program, that appears on the Animal Planet cable television network.

The show was plagued with inconsistencies in judging and content, but was a ratings hit for Animal Planet. A sequel was hosted by Madison Michele; it debuted in July 2004. This show failed to earn the ratings of the first season.  A hastily produced third season consisting of teams of two was all but buried by Animal Planet before and during its airing. It was called King of the Jungle: Pairs and had 14 contestants instead of 12. The teams were: Lori and Lisa, twin science teachers from Boston; Hindley and Thomas, best friends from Alabama; Lolita and Matt, lifelong friends from Columbus; Kevin and Sherry, a married couple, also from the Columbus area; David and Petite, hair stylists from Kennesaw, Georgia; Wendy and Troy, brother and sister from Indiana; and Steve and Danielle, another married couple from Greensboro, North Carolina.

The series is narrated by Karen Hayley.", "Following in the footsteps of The Giant Claw (2002) and Land of Giants (2003), special episodes of the nature documentary series Walking with Dinosaurs, Sea Monsters sees time-travelling zoologist Nigel Marven travel back in time to encounter and interact with prehistoric life. Whereas both of the previous specials took place on land and were confined to a single setting, Sea Monsters focuses on the aquatic life of seven different geological periods between 4 and 450\u00a0million years ago. Travelling on this prehistoric safari with his boat, The Ancient Mariner, Marven aims to dive in the seven deadliest seas of all time, searching for the most dangerous sea creatures to ever live.", "In 2004, Sea Monsters won a BAFTA TV Award for Best Visual Effects.

For his work in Sea Monsters and in the preceding Land of Giants, Nigel Marven was nominated for a Royal Television Society Programme award for best presenter (factual).", "The inclusion of a presenter instead of just narration was notably criticised by evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins, who stated that \"I think the Nigel Marven programmes are awful, awful - really naff\". Dawkins elaborated, saying that \"it is as though they think the public are so stupid that they can't enjoy the spectacle of the animals themselves\" and \"isn't it at least patronising and condescending when television people assume, without asking them, that their audiences can't cope with science unless the pill is coated with the sugar of personal anecdote?\". Defending Sea Monsters, Jasper James did not believe that the series was patronising, stating that \"if you can enjoy the drama of a programme while learning something then that's great\".", "As with past entries into the Walking with... series, some scientists feared that Sea Monsters sacrificed scientific accuracy for drama and entertainment. Parts of the series, such as mating behaviour of the various animals, can only ever be speculation and guess work, but it is not made clear what is and is not fact in the programme itself. Dawkins pointed out that \"In Nigel Marven's past programmes they didn't give the viewer any indication of what is known and what is conjecture\". In response to such fears, James stated that nothing in the series was said \"unless there was some evidence for it\".", "Palaeontologists have cited Sea Monsters as inspirational for their careers. Jack A. Cooper, who led a team investigating the body size of megalodon and published a study concerning it in 2020, cited the animal's appearance in Sea Monsters as the inspiration that made him pursue a career in palaeontology and inspired him to study the ancient shark. Cooper was six years old at the time the programme first aired and remembered being both terrified and captiviated. Following the paper's publication, Nigel Marven tweeted his congratulations to Cooper.", "Jasper James and Nigel Marven co-authored a companion book for the series, titled Sea Monsters: Prehistoric Predators of the Deep (published in the United States as Chased by Sea Monsters: Prehistoric Predators of the Deep). The book begins with a description of the Big Bang, before going through the seven periods of time featured in the series, from the Ordovician to the Pliocene, referred to as the \"seven most deadly seas of all time\". Each chapter features renderings of the animals as seen in the series and sidebars feature information about each of the featured animals, including how to pronounce their names, their classification, their size and their diet."]}, {"page": "Saba Douglas-Hamilton", "response": ["Since 2000, Saba has appeared in wildlife documentaries produced by the BBC and others.
