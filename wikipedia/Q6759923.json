He was associated with George Petrie, Stokes, and other Irish arch\u00e6ologists in the foundation of the Irish Archaeological Society in 1840, and of the Celtic Society in 1845. In 1849 and 1869 he presided over the meetings of the Cambrian Archaeological Association held at Cardiff and Bridgend, and in 1871 was president of a section of the Royal Arch\u00e6ological Institute. In 1862 he accompanied Montalembert on a tour in Scotland, and five years later travelled in France and Italy, with the view of making a special study of campaniles. But Irish arch\u00e6ology mainly occupied him. He is said to have visited every barony in Ireland, and nearly every island off the coast. He was usually attended by a photographer, and Dr. William Stokes and Miss Margaret Stokes were often in his company.", "After Petrie's death in 1866, Dunraven took it upon himself to complete his book, Notes on Irish Architecture. He spent four years traveling and working on Notes, two lengthy folios published after his death, under the editorship of Margaret Stokes, with a preface by the fourth Earl of Dunraven, and notes by Petrie and Reeves. The work was illustrated by 161 wood engravings, from drawings by G. Petrie, W. F. Wakeman, Gordon Hills, Margaret Stokes, Lord Dunraven, and others, besides 125 fine plates. The first part dealt with stone buildings with and without cement, and the second part with belfries and Irish Romanesque."]}, {"page": "Stokes (surname)", "response": ["*Margaret Stokes, Irish antiquarian, artist and author"]}, {"page": "Fran\u00e7oise Henry", "response": ["She worked for UCD from 1932 to 1974, with her first appointment being to the French department in 1932. Her first major work, Irish art in the early Christian period, was published in 1940, and focused on an area of study largely untouched since Margaret Stokes in the 1800s. The book charts Irish art from the prehistoric up to the twelfth century, covering sculpture, manuscripts, and metalwork. In the 1960s, it was expanded and updated to three volumes, published first in French and then English."]}, {"page": "William Reeves (bishop)", "response": ["Reeves was a friend of Margaret Stokes and with his colleague Todd is credited with setting off her interest in Irish antiquities."]}, {"page": "Margaret Mcnair Stokes", "response": ["#Redirect Margaret Stokes"]}, {"page": "Manch\u00e1n of Mohill", "response": ["The ten figures adorning the shrine are newer, probably 13th century. It is believed the half-round cast-bronze figure carrying an axe on the Manchan Shine, is an early representation of Olaf II of Norway (Saint Olaf), considering the sub-Viking context of the art, and iconographical association of a man with axe. In 1861, an \"appliqu\u00e9\" figure of gilt, cast copper-alloy,  high,  wide, and  thickness, was reportedly found at the grave-yard of Clonmacnoise, and presented with a short beard and moustache, a pointed decorated hat covering his ears, hands flat on his bare chest, with a pleated decorated kilt, one missing leg, and was very similar those remaining on the shrine of Manchan, so is assumed to have fallen off. Margaret Stokes claimed a robed figurine holding a book, found buried near Saint John's Abbey at Thomas Street, Dublin, bears resemblance to the Manchan shrine figures, but \"of much finer workmanship and evidently earlier date\", but unfortunately she fails to expand further."]}]}}
