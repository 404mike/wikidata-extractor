He worked at the British Museum and was responsible for examining and describing shells from collections made over the years that had been deposited there. The German malacologist Johannes Thiele determined in 1934 that the characteristics of the Antarctic scallop were sufficiently different from those of other members of the genus Pecten to warrant its inclusion in a separate genus, Adamussium. More recently, examinations of the chromosome structure and of the mitochondrial DNA of A. colbecki have been undertaken, but the exact phylogenetic relationship it has with other pectinids is still unclear. The specific name most likely honours William Colbeck, the cartographer and magnetic observer on the British Southern Cross Antarctic Expedition (1898-1900)."]}, {"page": "William Colbeck (seaman)", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Colbeck (sea captain)"]}]}}
