It was during this period that he achieved career-bests both in bowling (5-36 for against the Army at The University Parks in June 1926) and in batting (43 against Essex at Chelmsford in June 1927); both these feats were performed for Oxford.\nAfter that, Greenstock played only two more first-class matches, for Free Foresters against Oxford in 1928, and for H. D. G. Leveson-Gower's XI against Cambridge University the following year. He bowled only seven overs in that final match, taking the single wicket of William Harbison.\nGreenstock was born in Great Malvern, Worcestershire; he died in a Gloucester hospital at the age of 86.\nHe was the nephew of the seven Foster brothers, all of whom played first-class cricket for Worcestershire. Like them, he was also educated at Malvern College but he did not show great potential at cricket there. His cousin Peter Foster played for Oxford and Kent, while another cousin (Christopher Foster) and his father William Greenstock also had short first-class careers.", "link_mentions": {}}}
