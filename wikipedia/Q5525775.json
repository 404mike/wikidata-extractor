Potter helped Chester win three successive games but defeats to Exeter City and Mansfield Town led to Chester breaking their transfer record to sign Chris Dunleavy.Potter had to wait until March 1974 for his next five league outings and he added just one league appearance during the club's promotion season of 1974\u201375 before leaving the club and professional football.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Summer Sundae", "response": ["*Gary Potter"]}, {"page": "List of people from Chester", "response": ["*Gary Potter, footballer."]}, {"page": "1972\u201373 Chester F.C. season", "response": ["||| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Gary Potter"]}, {"page": "1973\u201374 Chester F.C. season", "response": ["||| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Gary Potter"]}, {"page": "1974\u201375 Chester F.C. season", "response": ["||| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Gary Potter"]}, {"page": "Potter, Gary", "response": ["#redirectGary Potter"]}]}}
