Stephens appeared in 14 films between 1954 and 1966, then chose to drop out of acting and made his adult career outside the profession.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jack Clayton", "response": ["The film has consistently received high praise on many counts \u2013 Kerr's superb performance, which is often rated as one of the best of her career; the powerfully unsettling performances of the two juvenile leads, Martin Stephens (Miles) and Pamela Franklin (Flora); the eerie score by the French composer Georges Auric; and especially the lush black-and-white widescreen cinematography of Freddie Francis. Although Clayton was initially dismayed at Fox's insistence that the film be shot in CinemaScope (a format he greatly disliked) Francis was able to use it to great advantage, carefully framing each scene, and using innovative techniques, such as placing protagonists at the extreme opposite edges of the screen during dialogue scenes, or focusing on the central region while using specially-made filters to blur the edges of the frame, creating a subtle but disturbing sense of unease in the viewer. Capote's screenplay (with uncredited contributions from John Mortimer) was mainly adapted from William Archibald's stage version of the story."]}, {"page": "Village of the Damned (1960 film)", "response": ["* Martin Stephens as David Zellaby", "On January 4, 2017, Martin Stephens gave an extensive interview on his career as a child actor during a TEDx episode titled 'Movies, Marriage and Meditation'."]}, {"page": "The Innocents (1961 film)", "response": ["For the roles of the children, Clayton cast eleven-year-old Pamela Franklin (in her film debut) as Flora, and Martin Stephens as her brother, Miles; Stephens had featured in the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer horror film Village of the Damned (1960). Australian-born actress Clytie Jessop was cast as the spectral Miss Jessel (also in her film debut), while Peter Wyngarde was cast in the role of Quint, Miss Jessel's illicit lover. Though he receives top billing, Michael Redgrave appears only in the beginning of the film in a cameo role as the children's uncle.", "Filming of The Innocents took place primarily at Shepperton Studios in Surrey. Interior sequences were shot on sound stages at Shepperton, as well as the sequences which took place in the greenhouse veranda; a fa\u00e7ade for Bly house was also built by the art department on the studio lot. On-location exterior scenes were shot at the Gothic mansion of Sheffield Park in East Sussex. To ensure that his child actors' performances remained uninhibited, Clayton withheld the full details of the story from Martin Stephens and Pamela Franklin, who only received those parts of the script that lacked the surprising and mysterious adult elements of the film. According to script supervisor Pamela Mann, star Deborah Kerr was specifically attuned to making sure the children \"had fun on set\". Writer Truman Capote was present during the first several weeks of filming, writing additional dialogue for Stephens and Franklin, and making minor script alterations.", "On 4 January 2017, Martin Stephens gave an extensive interview on his career as a child actor during a TEDx episode titled \"Movies, Marriage and Meditation\"."]}, {"page": "Another Time, Another Place (1958 film)", "response": ["| Martin Stephens || Brian Trevor"]}, {"page": "The Witches (1966 film)", "response": ["The village of Hambleden, Buckinghamshire, was the filming location for the fictional village of Heddaby.
