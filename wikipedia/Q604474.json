The analysis of signaling games and other communication games has provided insight into the evolution of communication among animals. For example, the mobbing behavior of many species, in which a large number of prey animals attack a larger predator, seems to be an example of spontaneous emergent organization. Ants have also been shown to exhibit feed-forward behavior akin to fashion (see Paul Ormerod's Butterfly Economics)."]}, {"page": "Kew", "response": ["*Paul Ormerod, economist, lives in Kew."]}, {"page": "Michael Albert", "response": ["In 2003, Parecon: Life After Capitalism was published further outlining participatory economics in a more accessible, less academic format.
