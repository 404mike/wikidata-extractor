Many historic sites and monuments commemorate his life, and he has been depicted numerous times in literature, film, and television. He is chiefly portrayed as a protagonist, although historical accounts of his actions are often controversial, and much of his career is known to have been exaggerated both by himself and by contemporary mythmakers. While Hickok claimed to have killed numerous named and unnamed gunmen in his lifetime, his career as a gunfighter only lasted from 1861 to 1871. According to Joseph G. Rosa, Hickok's biographer and the foremost authority on Wild Bill, Hickok killed only six or seven men in gunfights. April 1, 2002Rosa, Joseph G.

However, there are no indications that he was ever in any other gunfights short of this one. Some believe Riley died soon after from his poor health. But the legend has it that Riley was not dying. He was explained in writings from the time as being gaunt, emaciated, and scarecrow like, with no mention of a sickness causing these things. Now many jump to thinking he was dying because of those descriptions but he could have just been a thin, frail looking young man. It is said that he moved East across the Mississippi River where he settled at a plantation. Either way, he disappeared from historical record."]}, {"page": "Mike McCluskie", "response": ["Riley has been listed as a gunfighter in some historical accounts.
