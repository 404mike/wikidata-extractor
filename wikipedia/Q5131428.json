As a member of the Long Parliament, he became an outspoken critic of the conduct of its affairs, and allied himself to William Prynne. Author of the History of Independency, which as a project with several editions included also his Anarchia Anglicana, he was a strong opponent of religious factionalism, and was imprisoned in the Tower of London, where he died without being brought to trial. He used the pseudonym Theodorus Verax (sometimes misprinted \"Varax\").\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Buckingham Palace", "response": ["In 1531, Henry VIII acquired the Hospital of St James, which became St James's Palace,Goring, p. 28. from Eton College, and in 1536 he took the Manor of Ebury from Westminster Abbey.Goring, p. 18. These transfers brought the site of Buckingham Palace back into royal hands for the first time since William the Conqueror had given it away almost 500 years earlier. Various owners leased it from royal landlords, and the freehold was the subject of frenzied speculation during the 17th century. By then, the old village of Eye Cross had long since fallen into decay, and the area was mostly wasteland.Wright, pp. 76\u201378. Needing money, James I sold off part of the Crown freehold but retained part of the site on which he established a  mulberry garden for the production of silk. (This is at the north-west corner of today's palace.)Goring, pp. 31, 36. Clement Walker in Anarchia Anglicana (1649) refers to \"new-erected sodoms and spintries at the Mulberry Garden at S. James's\"; this suggests it may have been a place of debauchery.

On the arrival, however, of Prince Rupert on 22 July, although the place was in no condition to resist an attack, Fiennes held out until Rupert's troops had forced an entry into the city and further resistance was both hopeless and a waste of life.
