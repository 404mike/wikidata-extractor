He had originally expected to play a reserve-team match at Ryde but, because of an injury crisis which had sidelined Jack Hogg, Alex Glen and Bill Gray, he was included in the first-team for the Southern League match against Watford on 30 March 1907, which ended 0\u20130.

He then lost his place to Edward Bell for two matches before being recalled for the final match of the season."]}]}}
