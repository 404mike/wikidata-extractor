He was born at Maxton, Dover, Kent and died at Cheltenham, Gloucestershire.\nWright was educated at Malvern College and Selwyn College, Cambridge; at school he played for the first eleven at cricket and captained the soccer team. He played in two first-class cricket matches as a left-arm opening bowler while at Cambridge in 1899, taking one wicket in each of them; his better bowling figures, one for 16, and his highest first-class score of 14, made as a tail-end batsman, came in the first of these, the match against Surrey. He appeared in a single match for Somerset in 1902, batting at No 11 and failing to score in either innings; he bowled just two overs and did not take a wicket in this match.The Malvern Register compiled in 1904 records Wright's family as living in Wickwar, Gloucestershire and that he was employed, after graduation, as an assistant master at a preparatory school, Stone House School, Broadstairs, Kent.", "link_mentions": {}}}
