Alex McLean of Slub and Nick Collins coined the word \"algorave\" in 2011, and the first event under such a name was organised in London, UK. It has since become a movement, with algoraves taking place around the world.", "Algorithmic approaches have long been applied in electronic dance music from the 1970s when Brian Eno established randomised musical practises which evolved into generative music over the course of his long career. This, in turn, influenced rave culture and techno of the 1990s by Farmers Manual, Autechre, and Aphex Twin. The Anti EP was an explicit response to the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 - specifically the track \"Flutter\" as a means of creating \"non-repetitive beats\" at raves which had been outlawed by the wording of the Act. The snare rush famously featured on the Girl/Boy EP of 1996 is an earlier form of digital algorithmic coding and featured in drum and bass influenced electronic music of the early to mid 1990s, this approach later evolving into glitch music. Traditional use of algorithms include Maypole dancing, where they are applied to the dance itself as a form of Algorithmic Choreography and bell-ringing. The first self-proclaimed \"algorave\" was held in London as a warmup concert for the SuperCollider Symposium 2012. However, the name was first coined in 2011, after live coders Nick Collins and Alex McLean tuned into a happy hardcore pirate radio station on the way to a performance in the UK. Since then, algorave has been growing into an international movement, with algoraves having been held mainly in Europe and Asia; and few events in Australia and North America."]}, {"page": "List of Cambridge Companions to Music", "response": ["| data-sort-value=\"Collins, Nick, Escriv\u00e1n, Julio d'\"| Nick Collins, Julio d'Escriv\u00e1n, Andrew Hugill, , Ge Wang, Sergi Jord\u00e0, Karlheinz Essl, Amy Alexander, Julian Rohrhuber, Stefania Serafin, , Natasha Barrett"]}, {"page": "Shelly Knotts", "response": ["Knotts is also active in event curation, including organising several Algorave events in Newcastle, three editions of the international Network Music Festival, chairing the Live Coding and Collaboration symposium in 2014, and chairing the artistic programme of the International Conference on Live coding in 2015.
