These turned out to be forgeries undertaken by an Italian mother and daughter, Amalia and Rosa Panvini. In 1981 Rupert Murdoch, who owned several other papers in Australia, New Zealand and the UK, purchased Times Newspapers Ltd, which owned both The Times and its Sunday sister. Murdoch appointed Frank Giles to be the editor of The Sunday Times. Hugh Trevor-Roper, then Regius Professor of Modern History at Oxford University, became an independent national director of The Times in 1974. He was created Baron Dacre of Glanton in 1979 and was a specialist on Nazi Germany, having worked for the British intelligence services during and after the Second World War. At the war's end he had undertaken an official investigation of Hitler's death, interviewing eyewitnesses to the F\u00fchrer's last movements. In addition to the official report he filed, Trevor-Roper also published The Last Days of Hitler (1947) on the subject.
