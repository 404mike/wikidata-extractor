The brothers were generally regarded as the finest fullbacks in England for a number of years; according to Philip Gibbons in his \"History of the Game from 1863 to 1900\" this was due mainly to their own defensive system based on the combination game used by the Royal Engineers during the early 1870s.", "link_mentions": {}}}
