They were a formidable team and ensured Berlin's ideals were largely achieved. Wolfson is perhaps the most egalitarian college at Oxford, with few barriers between students and fellows. There is no high table, only one common room for all the members of the college, and gowns are worn only on special occasions. Graduate students serve on the college's governing body and participate in General Meetings. Berlin's reputation and presence in the early years also helped shape the intellectual character of the college, attracting many distinguished fellows like Niko Tinbergen, who won a Nobel Prize for his studies in animal behaviour in 1973. Berlin's own prominence in the humanities helped attract many graduate students like Henry Hardy, interested in political philosophy and the history of ideas."]}, {"page": "1920 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["** Michael Brock, historian (died 2014)"]}, {"page": "Newport (Isle of Wight) (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["*Michael Brock, The Great Reform Act (London: Hutchinson, 1973)"]}, {"page": "Aldborough (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["*Michael Brock,The Great Reform Act (London: Hutchinson, 1973)."]}, {"page": "Venetia Stanley (1887\u20131948)", "response": ["* Asquith, H.H.
