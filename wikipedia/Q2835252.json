In this paper, Parson suggested that the electron is not merely an electric charge but is also a small magnet (or \"magneton\" as he called it) and furthermore that a chemical bond results from two electrons being shared between two atoms.Parson, A.L. (1915). \"A Magneton Theory of the Structure of the Atom\". Smithsonian Publication 2371, Washington.  This, according to Lewis, meant that bonding occurred when two electrons formed a shared edge between two complete cubes."]}, {"page": "Toroidal ring model", "response": ["The toroidal ring model, known originally as the Parson magneton or magnetic electron, is a physical model of subatomic particles. It is also known as the plasmoid ring, vortex ring, or helicon ring. This physical model treated electrons and protons as elementary particles, and was first proposed by Alfred Lauck Parson in 1915.", "In 1915, Alfred Lauck Parson proposed his \"magneton\"Alfred L.

At about the same time Leigh Page developed a classical theory of blackbody radiation assuming rotating \"oscillators\", able to store energy without radiating.Leigh Page, \"The Distribution of Energy in the Normal Radiation Spectrum\", Physical Review, S2, V7, N2, pp. 229\u2013240 (Feb 1916). Gilbert N. Lewis was inspired in part by Parson's model in developing his theory of chemical bonding.Gilbert N. Lewis, \"The Atom and the Molecule \", Journal of the American Chemical Society, V38, pp. 762\u2013786 (1916). Then David L. Webster wrote three papers connecting Parson's magneton with Page's oscillatorDavid L.

Grondahl confirmed the model with his experiments on free electrons in iron wires.Lars O. Grondahl, \"Proceedings of the American Physical Society: Experimental Evidence for the Parson Magneton\", Physical Review, S2, V10, N5, pp. 586\u2013588 (Nov 1917). Parson's theory next attracted the attention of Arthur Compton, who wrote a series of papers on the properties of the electron,Arthur H.
