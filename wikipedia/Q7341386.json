Between the years 1837 and 1839 the teetotaller Aitken was in London preaching \"in the open air\" in Lambeth and at Whites Row Chapel in Spitalfields. It was in Spitalfields that a Methodist local preacher and hat block maker from Southwark  William Bridges, heard Aitken evangelize on the text Enoch walked with God. Bridges became \"a changed man\" and in 1837 founded his own tiny religious sect called the Plumstead Peculiars. That same year Bridges visited one of his sisters in Rochford and struck up a friendship with Banyard, swapping ideas and discussing \"religious topics\".  Bridges invited Banyard to stay with him in London and at some point led him to Aitken. Banyard instinctively realised that Aitken and Bridges had \"something more than he\" and before leaving Bridges' home at 8 Gravel Lane Southwark, is said  to have gone to an upstairs room, fallen to his knees and been 'born again'.
