In the rest of years of the 1960s he was in another three bands, the last of them, the second with his brother Kevin, called Friendly Persuasion, which became famous.In June 1970, Friendly Persuasion disbanded and Jim and Kevin formed Salvation, a pop supergroup with Nod Kerr on drums, Mario Tortolano on organ, and Ian Kenny on lead gu\u0131tar. Kenny left in December 1970 and was replaced by Brian Denniston and Kerr left around May 1971, being replaced by Matt Ca\u0131rns. They also had Robin B\u0131rrel on organ for a wh\u0131le. James Ure (shortly afterwards named Midge Ure) on lead gu\u0131tar, Billy McIsaac on organ and Kenny Hyslop on drums joined the brothers in March 1972. That membership remained until Kevin left in April 1974, so the remaining members changed the band name to Slik. The band had numerous musical styles including glam and soft rock, and after failed promising hits and the arrival of punk rock, McGinlay left the band on March 1977, being replaced by Russell Webb, but the band lasted until September and with another name, PVC2.\nLater he joined his brother Kevin's band Revival, that until now are active (but without Kevin).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Midge Ure", "response": ["Ure joined Salvation as a guitarist in 1972.
