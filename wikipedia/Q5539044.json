He left the Army in August 1902, to work for the NSPCC, and rejoined in January 1915. When he was 40 years old, and a Company Sergeant-Major in the 18th Battalion (3rd Manchester Pals), The Manchester Regiment of the British Army during the First World War, Evans was awarded the Victoria Cross for his deeds on 30 July 1916 during the Battle of the Somme at Guillemont, France:\nCompany Sergeant-Major Evans volunteered to take back an important message after five runners had been killed in attempting to do so. He had to cover about 700 yards, the whole of which was under observation from the enemy. He succeeded in delivering the message in spite of being wounded, and then rejoined his company despite having been advised to go to the dressing station. The return journey had again meant facing 700 yards of severe rifle and machine-gun fire, but by dodging from shell-hole to shell-hole he managed it.Evans was captured following his VC action, and spent the rest of the war as a POW. His Victoria Cross, gazetted in January 1920, was the last to be gazetted for the First World War.\nHe died on 28 September 1937 and was buried in Elmers End Cemetery, Beckenham.His VC is held at the Imperial War Museum in London.", "link_mentions": {}}}
