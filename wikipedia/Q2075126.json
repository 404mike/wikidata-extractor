Over the next few years, Hassell used his position in the executive committee of the Central European Economic Congress to discuss with Allied officials what might happen after a possible coup d'\u00e9tat in Germany.

Though Britain in 1940 was prepared to cede the first two demands, but the demand that Poland was to surrender land to Germany as part of a peace terms proved to be a problem."]}, {"page": "James Lonsdale", "response": ["*James Lonsdale-Bryans (1893\u20131981), writer, British amateur diplomat and Nazi sympathiser"]}, {"page": "Edvard Bene\u0161", "response": ["On 22 February 1940 during a secret meeting in Switzerland between Ulrich von Hassell representing the German conservatives and James Lonsdale-Bryans representing Great Britain, the former told the latter there was no possibility of a post-Nazi Germany ever agreeing to return the Sudetenland. In 1939 and 1940, Chamberlain repeatedly made public statements that Britain was willing to make an \"honorable peace\" with a post-Nazi Germany, which meant the Sudetenland would remain within the Reich.

It was on the pretext of a Haushofer/Burckhardt meeting that Albrecht travelled to Geneva on 28 April 1941. A fortnight later, Hess flew to Scotland. Haushofer had returned to Germany via Arosa in Switzerland, where he visited Ilse von Hassell, staying with her recuperating son at the Hotel Isla. It is Harris' contention that at this meeting the necessary navigational information was passed to Hess (via Haushofer) in connection with the forthcoming flight. A year earlier, the British amateur diplomat James Lonsdale-Bryans had used the same location and venue as part of his \"semi official\" peace negotiations. The Von Hassell family returned home to Bavaria on 16 May 1941."]}, {"page": "Lonsdale-Bryans, James", "response": ["#redirectJames Lonsdale-Bryans"]}]}}
