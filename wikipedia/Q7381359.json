By now team captain, Farrell received the Championship shield from Dr. Russell Bencraft, who was both president of the League and of the club, at a ceremony in the Artillery Drill Hall in Southampton. In the FA Cup, the Saints reached the Second Round Proper where they were defeated 3\u20131 at Newton Heath in a replay.

Somerset were awarded first-class status in 1882,Foot (1986), p17 and it was in this season that Winter made his debut first-class appearance, playing for the county against Hampshire. By the time of his first-class debut, Winter was still only aged 15, making him among the youngest debutants to have played first-class cricket for Somerset.  Coming on to bowl at the first change of bowling, Winter claimed a wicket in his first innings, with the Hampshire captain Russell Bencraft being caught off his bowling. He was dismissed for six in both of Somerset's innings. In his second match, against the MCC, Winter claimed four wickets for 49 runs in the second-innings, achieving a return that would remain his best until 1885. It was another match against Hampshire in which Winter improved his bowling figures, taking four wickets for 20 runs. Playing the same opposition later that season, Somerset had only travelled to Southampton for the match with nine players. After scoring 22 in the first-innings, Winter was promoted to open the second for Somerset, and scored his highest total, and only half-century, making 62 runs."]}, {"page": "1896\u201397 Southampton St. Mary's F.C. season", "response": ["As team captain, Farrell received the Championship shield from Dr. Russell Bencraft, who was both president of the League and of the club, at a ceremony in the Artillery Drill Hall in Southampton.
