Records in March 1990. Jools Holland left Squeeze again in early 1990, and was not immediately replaced. In his stead, the band used session musicians such as Irving (who was no longer an official band member), Steve Nieve, and Bruce Hornsby for the 1991 release Play, which came out on the Reprise label. This release again spawned no UK hits, although in the US the singles \"Satisfied\" and \"Crying in My Sleep\" received significant airplay on modern rock stations, and in Canada \"Satisfied\" was a top 50 hit. However, Reprise dropped the band after this album. Following this, drummer Gilson Lavis was let go in 1992, and replaced by Nieve's Attractions bandmate Pete Thomas. Paul Carrack also returned to the band in 1993, although by this point Squeeze was not so much a band as it was a trade name for Difford and Tilbrook plus sidemen."]}, {"page": "The Lords of the New Church", "response": ["Having signed with Copeland's I.R.S. Records, Copeland also took on managerial duties, the Lords of the New Church released their selfproduced eponymous debut album in July 1982. Musically, the album is a mix of punk, glam, garage rock and goth, described by New Noise Magazine as a \"seedy concoction of spidery guitars, sleazy bass lines, jungle drums and gothic keyboards.\" For the subsequent tour, the band enhanced their live sound with keyboardist Matt Irving, who had also played on the album. The Lords of the New Church was well-received and peaked at #3 on the UK Indie Chart.
