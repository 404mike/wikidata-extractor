His wine cellar was more extensive than his library.\"", "The Robinson's had a country home in the Catskills, in the style of a Scottish Castle, in Jordanville, New York that was known as Henderson House and modeled after Sir William Douglas' Gelston Castle in Scotland.

Fanny had inherited the home from her aunt Harriet (n\u00e9e Douglas) Cruger, the sister of her mother, Elizabeth Douglas Monroe.
