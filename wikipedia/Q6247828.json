In total he played 489 league games in a nineteen-year career in the Football League.\nStarting his management career at Port Vale in 1979, he won them promotion out of the Fourth Division in 1982\u201383. Following this he left to take the reins at Chester City in 1984.

John McGrath steered the club to promotion in 1982\u201383, though he departed after relegation became inevitable the following season. His assistant, John Rudge, stepped up to become the club's longest-serving and most successful manager, leading the club from 1983 to 1999.

Despite this Matthew's was never paid \u00a37,000 that the club owed him and this lead him to never manage in England again. Gordon Lee took the helm following this punishment, and steered the club to promotion at the end of the 1969\u201370 campaign. However, the 1970s did not prove a successful period for the Valiants, as the club languished in the bottom half of the Third Division for much of the decade. Lee left in 1974, and a succession of managers failed to prevent relegation in 1977\u20131978. The 1979\u201380 season saw Port Vale finish 20th in the Fourth Division (88th overall), the club's worst ever finish.
