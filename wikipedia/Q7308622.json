On his journey, he first stopped at Freetown to meet with a group interested in establishing a branch of the WAYL there. The Sierra Leoneans expressed genuine interest in the WAYL, but they hesitated to establish a branch there before obtaining a copy of the league's constitution. Wallace-Johnson then continued on his journey before stopping in Paris, where he contacted the International Bureau of Youth in hopes of setting up a meeting with general secretary. However, the secretary was out of town, so Wallace-Johnson pressed on in his journey. On arrival to London, he began to strategise and plan his upcoming events. Besides presenting his appeal case to the Privy Council, Wallace-Johnson planned to establish a lobby in England to pursue claims on behalf of WAYL members and to campaign for a commission of inquiry into Gold Coast political, economic and educational affairs. He first contacted Arnold Ward of the Negro Welfare Association and Reginald Bridgeman of the League Against Imperialism, two strong contacts he had made years before in Accra.. Ward and Bridgeman sought to publicise Wallace-Johnson's objectives for colonial reform. Using a cautionary approach, the two men suggested that Wallace-Johnson seek the support of sympathetic members of Parliament, make another attempt at meeting with the general secretary of the International Bureau of Youth, and contact leaders of the youth movement in England. He immediately started working on Ward and Bridgeman's suggestions. He met with interest groups and Labour Party politicians during the day and delivered speeches at public gatherings and rallies at night.."]}, {"page": "List of Old Harrovians", "response": ["*Reginald Bridgeman CMG (1884\u20131968), member of Her Majesty's Diplomatic Service and attempted Labour Party candidateHarrow, 1800\u20131911, p. 792"]}, {"page": "Bridgeman", "response": ["*Reginald Bridgeman"]}, {"page": "Francis Bridgeman (British Army officer)", "response": ["In later life he lived at The Priory, Beech Hill, near Reading, Berkshire.

Its leading black activists were Arnold Ward and Peter Blackman from Barbados, and Desmond Buckle and Rowland Sawyer from West Africa.

It was noted in local media that the philosopher and political activist Bertrand Russell had declined an invitation, later writing in 1963 that he felt desolation over the triumph of the Chinese Communist Revolution. The event came about following the formation of a new committee chaired by John Platts-Mills, Arthur Clegg, and Reginald Bridgeman, that paved the way for the later established Society for Anglo-Chinese Understanding. Records from these events, up until 1955 name a \"Sam Ching\" as well as a \"Sam Chen,\" as the principle contact between the Communist Party of Great Britain and the Ambassadors of China. Both of these names have been assumed by historians to be in reference to Chinque. "]}]}}
