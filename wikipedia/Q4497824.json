At the annual conversazione of the Leeds Philosophical and Literary Society in 1863, the Reverend Thomas Hincks stated that, \"he was afraid that the tiger... had been too much the great lion... and that they had neglected many other noble beasts surrounding it\". In a long article extolling the philanthropy of William Gott, the Leeds Mercury reported, \"The setting up of this tiger is so natural and so perfect in posture and anatomical detail, that it is certainly to be looked upon as a work of art quite as much as an object for scientific observation... \"  and in the same vein, \"Professor Owen has more than once stated that it is the finest and largest animal of its species not only in England but in Europe\"."]}]}}
