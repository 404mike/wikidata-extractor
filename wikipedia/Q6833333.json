He began his career with Nottinghamshire and Lancashire, for whom he played briefly for the Second XI, though it was with Derbyshire that he was to decide to play first-class cricket. He signed a professional contract in 1964. Page's Derbyshire debut, in June 1964, was a steady one, as he scored 25 and aided team-mate Edwin Smith in a seventh-wicket partnership of 57 against Worcestershire. In August of the same year he scored 112 against Leicestershire at Chesterfield, the first of nine centuries which included a career-best of 162 against Leicestershire in 1969.\nPage also helped the Derbyshire team to the runners-up spot in the Gillette Cup competition of 1969. He remained a first-team choice for Derbyshire until his final match for the first team in August 1975. 1975 was one of six seasons in which he scored more than 1000 runs.Page was a right-handed batsman and a right-arm off-break bowler. At the beginning of his career he bowled occasionally, and he took four wickets on one occasion for Derbyshire's Second XI.  Though there was an early attempt to turn him into an opener, his primary role ultimately became that of a middle-order batsman.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1969", "response": ["Derbyshire played 24 games in the County Championship, one match against Oxford University, and one against the touring New Zealanders.
