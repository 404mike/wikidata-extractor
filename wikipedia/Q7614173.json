His development team, Graftgold, mostly wrote for games published by Hewson Consultants during the 1980s.\nThe first computer he bought was a ZX80 which had to be assembled by hand.  At school he was a member of a computing club where he learnt the Algol 60 programming language.  During the 1970s he added Cobol to his repertoire from a government funded training course.  He went on to a programming job in the Civil Service.  Turner was 30 when he decided to move into games development.  His first game was written whilst he was still employed as a programmer and he handed his notice in when he received his first royalty cheque.He also wrote a series of articles for ZX Computing between August 1986 and January 1987, called The Professional Touch. Andrew Hewson had previously written for the magazine but got too busy to do it and Turner replaced them.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Rainbow Islands: The Story of Bubble Bobble 2", "response": ["The game took the whole team. John Cumming took charge of the maps and graphics. Gary Foreman did the C64 version. David O'Connor did the ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC versions. Jason Page did the 16-bit and C64 sounds.

Andrew Braybrook did the 16-bit versions."]}, {"page": "Paradroid", "response": ["Andrew Braybrook's Graftgold partner, Steve Turner, wrote a version of Paradroid for the ZX Spectrum called Quazatron in 1986, also published by Hewson.

Realising that his ambitions were too much for one man to realise, he hired a close friend, Andrew Braybrook, to work for him. After a brief spell developing games for the Dragon home computer, Graftgold soon turned their attention to the more lucrative Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum markets.", "Towards the end of the 1980s, it became apparent that Hewson Consultants were suffering financial difficulties. Steve Turner decided it would be in Graftgold's best interest to seek another publisher, so they parted ways with Hewson and signed a publishing deal with Telecomsoft, the software division of British Telecom. Two of Hewson's in-house programmers, Dominic Robinson and John Cumming, responded to this development by leaving the company to join Graftgold.", "Hewson weren't happy to see their most successful development partner jump ship, particularly because Graftgold were due to deliver two keenly anticipated titles -- Magnetron (by Steve Turner, for the ZX Spectrum) and Morpheus (by Andrew Braybrook, for the C64). Graftgold argued that because they weren't contracted to Hewson, they were perfectly within their rights to seek an alternate publisher. Unable to sustain a protracted legal wrangle, Hewson eventually settled with Telecomsoft out of court and parted company with Graftgold.", "In 2014 Steve Turner appeared in the documentary feature film From Bedrooms to Billions (2014), a film that tells the story of the British video game industry from 1979 to present.", "===Steve Turner===", "After leaving a job in commercial programming in 1982, Steve Turner decided to concentrate on freelance computer game development.

In his spare time he wrote games in BASIC for the ZX80, ZX81 and Dragon 32. His first foray into professional games came while he was playing bass guitar in a rock band with Steve Turner. Turner was writing games for the ZX Spectrum in his spare time and decided to make his break into full-time games production by starting the company which went on to become Graftgold. A few months after its inception, Turner asked Braybrook to join him in September 1983. Braybrook was commissioned by the magazine Zzap!64 to write a diary detailing the making of the video game Paradroid. This was followed by a subsequent diary published in the magazine about his game Morpheus."]}, {"page": "Steve Turner", "response": ["* Steve Turner (rugby league) (born 1984), Australian rugby league footballer", "* Steve Turner (Australian rules footballer) (born 1960), Australian rules footballer", "* Steve Turner (tennis) (born 1946), American professional tennis player", "* Steve Turner (NASCAR team owner), team owner of Turner Scott Motorsports", "* Steve Turner (game programmer), game programmer and composer", "* Steve Turner (guitarist) (born 1965), American musician", "* Steve Turner (journalist) (1930s \u2013 2016), British journalist and trade union leader", "* Steve Turner (trade unionist) (born 1962), British trade unionist", "* Steve Turner (writer), British music journalist, biographer and poet"]}, {"page": "List of ZX Spectrum games", "response": ["|Avalon||Hewson Consultants||Graftgold (Steve Turner)||||1984", "|Quazatron||Hewson Consultants||Steve Turner||||1986", "|Flying Shark||Firebird Software||Graftgold (Dominic Robinson, John Cumming, Steve Turner)||Taito||1987", "|Ranarama||Hewson Consultants||Graftgold (Steve Turner)||||1987", "|Zynaps||Hewson Consultants||John Cumming, Dominic Robinson, Stephen Crow, Steve Turner||||1987", "|Intensity||Firebird Software||Graftgold (Steve Turner), Drew Northcott||||1988", "|Magnetron||Firebird Software||Graftgold (Steve Turner), Drew Northcott||||1988", "|Ivan 'Ironman' Stewart's Super Off Road Racer||Virgin Games||Graftgold (Steve Turner, John Cumming, Jason Page)||Leland Corporation||1990"]}, {"page": "Ranarama", "response": ["Ranarama (also Rana Rama) is a top-down Gauntlet-like action game developed by Graftgold and published by Hewson Consultants in 1987.
