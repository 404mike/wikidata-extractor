He resigned from the FA in 1962 to become General Secretary of the Central Council of Physical Recreation (CCPR) and was appointed as the first Director of the Sports Council in 1965. He was knighted for his services to sport in 1978 when he retired.

He obtained coaching qualifications during his second spell at Fulham, and coached Oxford University A.F.C.. Robson made his debut as a manager in January 1968 at his former club Fulham, against Macclesfield Town, then in the Cheshire County League, in the third round of the FA Cup. Fulham were struggling with 16 points from 24 matches. Despite the acquisition of the young Malcolm Macdonald, Robson could not save the club from relegation to the Second Division, and he left them in November with the club sitting eighth in the Second Division. He discovered he had been sacked not from the club itself, but from the headline \"Robson sacked\" on an Evening Standard placard outside Putney station."]}, {"page": "Stanley Matthews", "response": ["Manager Walter Winterbottom began to look for a more defensive winger, and so used Matthews just once in 1949 \u2013 a 3\u20131 defeat to Scotland in the British Home Championship. Only after impressing in an FA tour of Canada was he was named as a last minute inclusion in the England squad for the 1950 FIFA World Cup in Brazil. He did not play in the win over Chile or in the infamous defeat to the United States, but played just once, in the 1\u20130 defeat to Spain at the Maracan\u00e3 Stadium. The preparation was not ideal as the FA did not take the competition seriously, and the hotel had \"unpalatable\" food and no training facilities."]}, {"page": "Alf Ramsey", "response": ["Ramsey's first taste of playing as an international had come while he was at Southampton, when he played for England B against Switzerland B in May 1948. He made his full England debut in December that year, in a 6\u20130 win over Switzerland at Highbury. He briefly lost his England place to his Southampton teammate Bill Ellerington, but following strong performances for Tottenham he returned in England's 2\u20130 home win over Italy on 30 November 1949. Ramsey's introduction to the England set-up coincided with the team's first ever World Cup campaign, the British Home Nations having rejoined football's world governing body FIFA in 1946 after two decades' absence, therefore being excluded from the first three World Cup tournaments in the 1930s. The Football Association (FA) in London had moved on little since the modern game's genesis in the late 19th century, yet remained convinced that English football and the England team were the finest in the world\u2014so superior, indeed, that entering the World Cup was hardly necessary. The evidence presented for this was that England had never lost at home to any team from outside the British Isles. The team was picked by a panel of eight FA selectors, with the role of England manager, held by Walter Winterbottom, combined with that of FA director of coaching.", "England lost to Brazil in the quarter-final of the 1962 World Cup in Chile and, being under attack from the British press, manager Walter Winterbottom resigned five months later. Although Ramsey's position as England manager was confirmed in October 1962, he formally took charge in May 1963, because Ramsey felt it would be wrong to walk out on Ipswich, who were struggling at the time.McKinstry, p. 199 The Times reported that Ramsey had taken on \"a vulnerable position\" out of duty, but that he had delayed taking up his role due to Ipswich being \"engaged in the European Cup but also facing a struggle\u2014through injuries and other factors\u2014at the wrong end of the League table\", with hope expressed that he would take up the reins \"from the new year\". When Ramsey took over as manager, he demanded complete control over squad selections: previously Winterbottom had been manager, but selections and other decisions were often carried out by board committees. Ramsey's appointment and his appropriation of all such responsibilities led to him being referred to as \"England's first proper manager\"."]}, {"page": "Duncan Edwards", "response": ["Edwards began the 1957\u201358 season in good form and rumours abounded that top Italian clubs were seeking to sign him.McCartney, p. 105. His final match in England took place on 1 February 1958, when he scored the opening goal to help United defeat Arsenal 5\u20134 at Highbury. The press were critical of his performance, with the Sunday Pictorials correspondent writing that he did not \"think [Edwards'] display in this thrilling game would impress England team manager Walter Winterbottom, who was watching. He was clearly at fault for Arsenal's fourth goal when, instead of clearing, he dallied on the ball\".McCartney, p. 113. Five days later he played his last ever match as United drew 3\u20133 away to Red Star Belgrade to progress to the semi-finals of the European Cup by an aggregate score of 5\u20134."]}]}}
