Gerrard then served as a squadron commander in the newly formed Royal Flying Corps and was posted as a flight commander to the Central Flying School.  Whilst at the Central Flying School, Gerrard set two records for flying at high altitude with passengers.  On the first occasion, he flew to 10,000 feet with Major Hugh Trenchard. Later, Gerrard flew to 8,400 feet with two passengers.\nFollowing the outbreak of the First World War, Gerrard took up command of No. 1 Squadron of the Royal Naval Air Service. One of his first acts was to attack the D\u00fcsseldorf Airship Sheds in a B.E.2a.
