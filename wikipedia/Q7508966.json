After a difficult start to the season fans became impatient, and Len Birks was sold to Sheffield United for 'a substantial sum', whilst Alfred Strange was brought in from Portsmouth. Vale won ten of their first thirteen league games in 1925, with striker Wilf Kirkham proving to be prolific. The \"Valiants\" finished in eighth, fifteen points behind second-placed Manchester United.", "Schofield added to his squad for the 1927\u201328 campaign by signing Alf Bennett (Nottingham Forest), David Rollo (Blackburn Rovers), Alex Trotter (South Shields), and Robert Gillespie (Luton Town). He also later signed Bert Fishwick from Blackpool. Vale went on to finish in ninth place, again always seeming likely to remain in the Second Division.

The defence had tightened up, but the attack, and especially top-scorer Kirkham had been somewhat off the boil. This led to Jack Lowe, Sidney Blunt, and Alex Trotter all being handed free transfers; they left for Oldham Athletic, Shrewsbury Town, and Manchester Central respectively. Meanwhile, back-up keepers Matthews and Holdcroft were also released, the former went to Halifax Town; however the latter would eventually find himself an England international and FA Cup winner at Preston North End."]}]}}
