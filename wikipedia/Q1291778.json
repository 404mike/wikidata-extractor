A 1,250 strong 2nd\u00a0Division was organised in 1851 under Colonel George Mackinnon, during the Eighth Xhosa War. In 1857, an expeditionary force was formed from the Indian Army for service in the Second Opium War. The force contained a 2nd\u00a0Division, which was under the command of Major-General Robert Napier. Major-General George Jackson Carey took command of a 2nd\u00a0Division, which was around 10,000-men strong and had been formed in September 1871 solely for training manoeuvres in England. In 1879, Major-General Edward Newdegate commanded a 2,400-man strong 2nd\u00a0Division during the Anglo-Zulu War. During the 1882 Anglo-Egyptian War, Lieutenant-General Edward Bruce Hamley commanded another newly established 2nd Division."]}, {"page": "Category talk:Military writers", "response": ["List of all pages in category Military writers retrieved by PockBot.PockBot is currently Undergoing Trials.

Regimental duty was seen as more honourable than appointments to the staff, and officers were often discouraged by their Colonels from attending the Staff College.Spiers (1992), p.109 Entry to the College was supposedly by examination, but to prevent intellectually inclined officers from the supporting arms monopolising the College, they (and officers from the Indian Army) were restricted to a small quota, and even officers from the infantry and cavalry who had failed the examination could therefore attend.Spiers (1992), p.112 (The Indian Army established its own Staff College at Quetta in 1905.) Although Wolseley encouraged his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s to attend the Staff College, he (and Roberts) preferred to appoint officers on personal preferences rather than Staff College grades. In many campaigns, officers ignored the Staff College doctrines and improvised transport and supply arrangements to meet local conditions and situations.
