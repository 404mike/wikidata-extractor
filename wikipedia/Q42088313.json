However, they separated soon afterwards and had no issue, meaning that on his death in 1830 the earldom and estate passed to his younger brother Thomas.He was laid to rest in  St Mary's church on the Easton Neston estate, where he is commemorated by a white marble funerary monument of a lifesize male figure seated by an urn.
