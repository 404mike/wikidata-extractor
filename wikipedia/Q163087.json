He argued that positivism supplies a false account of knowing, which if taken seriously undermines humanity's highest achievements.\nHis wide-ranging research in physical science included chemical kinetics, x-ray diffraction, and adsorption of gases. He pioneered the theory of fibre diffraction analysis in 1921, and the dislocation theory of plastic deformation of ductile metals and other materials in 1934. He emigrated to Germany, in 1926 becoming a chemistry professor at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin, and then in 1933 to England, becoming first a chemistry professor, and then a social sciences professor at the University of Manchester. Two of his pupils, and his son John Charles Polanyi won Nobel Prizes in Chemistry. In 1944 Polanyi was elected to the Royal Society.\nThe contributions which Polanyi made to the social sciences include an understanding of tacit knowledge, and the concept of a polycentric spontaneous order to intellectual inquiry were developed in the context of his opposition to central planning.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bertrand Russell", "response": ["Early in his life Russell supported eugenicist policies. He proposed in 1894 that the state issue certificates of health to prospective parents and withhold public benefits from those considered unfit. In 1929 he wrote that people deemed \"mentally defective\" and \"feebleminded\" should be sexually sterilized because they \"are apt to have enormous numbers of illegitimate children, all, as a rule, wholly useless to the community.\" Russell was also an advocate of population control:The nations which at present increase rapidly should be encouraged to adopt the methods by which, in the West, the increase of population has been checked. Educational propaganda, with government help, could achieve this result in a generation. There are, however, two powerful forces opposed to such a policy: one is religion, the other is nationalism. I think it is the duty of all to proclaim that opposition to the spread of birth is appalling depth of misery and degradation, and that within another fifty years or so. I do not pretend that birth control is the only way in which population can be kept from increasing. There are others, which, one must suppose, opponents of birth control would prefer. War, as I remarked a moment ago, has hitherto been disappointing in this respect, but perhaps bacteriological war may prove more effective. If a Black Death could be spread throughout the whole world once in every generation survivors could procreate freely without making the world too full.In 1956, immediately before and during the Suez Crisis, Russell expressed his opposition to European imperialism in the Middle East. He viewed the crisis as another reminder of the pressing need for a more effective mechanism for international governance, and to restrict national sovereignty to places such as the Suez Canal area \"where general interest is involved\". At the same time the Suez Crisis was taking place, the world was also captivated by the Hungarian Revolution and the subsequent crushing of the revolt by intervening Soviet forces. Russell attracted criticism for speaking out fervently against the Suez war while ignoring Soviet repression in Hungary, to which he responded that he did not criticise the Soviets \"because there was no need. Most of the so-called Western World was fulminating\". Although he later feigned a lack of concern, at the time he was disgusted by the brutal Soviet response, and on 16 November 1956, he expressed approval for a declaration of support for Hungarian scholars which Michael Polanyi had cabled to the Soviet embassy in London twelve days previously, shortly after Soviet troops had already entered Budapest.Collected Papers of Bertrand Russell (Psychology Press, 2005)"]}, {"page": "Epistemology", "response": ["In his paper On Denoting and his later book Problems of Philosophy, Bertrand Russell brought a great deal of attention to the distinction between \"knowledge by description\" and \"knowledge by acquaintance\". Gilbert Ryle is similarly credited with bringing more attention to the distinction between knowing how and knowing that in The Concept of Mind. In Personal Knowledge, Michael Polanyi argues for the epistemological relevance of knowledge how and knowledge that; using the example of the act of balance involved in riding a bicycle, he suggests that the theoretical knowledge of the physics involved in maintaining a state of balance cannot substitute for the practical knowledge of how to ride, and that it is important to understand how both are established and grounded. This position is essentially Ryle's, who argued that a failure to acknowledge the distinction between \"knowledge that\" and \"knowledge how\" leads to infinite regress."]}, {"page": "Eugene Wigner", "response": ["After graduating from the secondary school in 1920, Wigner enrolled at the Budapest University of Technical Sciences, known as the M\u0171egyetem. He was not happy with the courses on offer,  and in 1921 enrolled at the Technische Hochschule Berlin (now Technical University of Berlin), where he studied chemical engineering.  He also attended the Wednesday afternoon colloquia of the German Physical Society. These colloquia featured leading researchers including Max Planck, Max von Laue, Rudolf Ladenburg, Werner Heisenberg, Walther Nernst, Wolfgang Pauli, and Albert Einstein. Wigner also met the physicist Le\u00f3 Szil\u00e1rd, who at once became Wigner's closest friend. A third experience in Berlin was formative. Wigner worked at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry (now the Fritz Haber Institute), and there he met Michael Polanyi, who became, after L\u00e1szl\u00f3 R\u00e1tz, Wigner's greatest teacher.

This was one of the best schools in Budapest and was part of a brilliant education system designed for the elite. Under the Hungarian system, children received all their education at the one gymnasium. The Hungarian school system produced a generation noted for intellectual achievement, which included Theodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n (born 1881), George de Hevesy (born 1885), Michael Polanyi (born 1891), Le\u00f3 Szil\u00e1rd (born 1898), Dennis Gabor (born 1900), Eugene Wigner (born 1902), Edward Teller (born 1908), and Paul Erd\u0151s (born 1913).

Albert Einstein once observed that \"there is no logical bridge between phenomena and their theoretical principles.\" Charles Sanders Peirce, borrowing a page from Aristotle (Prior Analytics, 2.25)Aristotle (trans. 1853) Prior Analytics 2.25 via Wikisource  described the incipient stages of inquiry, instigated by the \"irritation of doubt\" to venture a plausible guess, as abductive reasoning. The history of science is filled with stories of scientists claiming a \"flash of inspiration\", or a hunch, which then motivated them to look for evidence to support or refute their idea. Michael Polanyi made such creativity the centerpiece of his discussion of methodology."]}, {"page": "Special relativity", "response": ["The constancy of the speed of light was motivated by Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism and the lack of evidence for the luminiferous ether. There is conflicting evidence on the extent to which Einstein was influenced by the null result of the Michelson\u2013Morley experiment.Michael Polanyi (1974) Personal Knowledge: Towards a Post-Critical Philosophy, , footnote page 10\u201311: Einstein reports, via Dr N Balzas in response to Polanyi's query, that \"The Michelson\u2013Morley experiment had no role in the foundation of the theory.\" and \"..the theory of relativity was not founded to explain its outcome at all.\"  In any case, the null result of the Michelson\u2013Morley experiment helped the notion of the constancy of the speed of light gain widespread and rapid acceptance."]}, {"page": "Relationship between religion and science", "response": ["Michael Polanyi asserted that it is merely a commitment to universality that protects against subjectivity and has nothing at all to do with personal detachment as found in many conceptions of the scientific method. Polanyi further asserted that all knowledge is personal and therefore the scientist must be performing a very personal if not necessarily subjective role when doing science. Polanyi added that the scientist often merely follows intuitions of \"intellectual beauty, symmetry, and 'empirical agreement'\". Polanyi held that science requires moral commitments similar to those found in religion."]}]}}
