As he was about to escape to a sixth-form place at St Anselm's college, owned and run by the Irish Christian Brothers, he lost his best childhood friend, Dessie, to a drug overdose. He felt the event marked a transition from boy to adult, and announced his intention to become a monk.\nIn 1988, while still a Christian Brother, he went to study theology at Durham University. He left the order shortly before taking his final vows, disillusioned by the restrictions increasingly placed upon the social work of the Brothers in Liverpool. Later, he returned to Durham University for a Masters in systematic philosophy and subsequently a PhD.\nIn 1997, he was appointed as a lecturer in religious studies at Lancaster University, where he remained until his death in 2008. Fletcher's influence in modern philosophy has been affirmed by some of the top speakers in British philosophy and his controversial ideas in applied ethics have been cited as having influenced some of the more radical modern philosophical approaches.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Index of philosophy articles (I\u2013Q)", "response": ["* Paul Fletcher (theologian)"]}, {"page": "Paul Fletcher", "response": ["Paul Fletcher may refer to:", "* Paul Fletcher (footballer) (born 1951),  retired English professional footballer", "* Paul Fletcher (politician) (born 1965), Liberal member of the Australian House of Representatives", "* Paul Fletcher (theologian) (1965\u20132008), English Roman Catholic philosophical theologian and lecturer", "* Paul Fletcher (baseball) (born 1967), American baseball player"]}]}}
