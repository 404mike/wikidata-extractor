He was a right-handed batsman, a wicket-keeper and an occasional right-arm offbreak bowler.\nAs a youth he toured New Zealand with England Young Cricketers in the 1990\u201391 season, playing two test matches and two one day internationals. He also played two youth ODIs against Australia the following summer, opening the batting with future county colleague Mal Loye.\nHe made his first team debut for his home-county Northamptonshire in 1992, and played for the county in 109 first-class matches over ten seasons. During this time he made ten centuries, with a highest score of 201 not out, but only reached the landmark of 1000 runs in a season once; in 2001.\nWarren left Northamptonshire at the end of the 2002 season. His departure was occasioned by a dressing room split after he began going out with the ex-fianc\u00e9e of his fellow wicketkeeper Toby Bailey.Following this, Warren played for Nottinghamshire in the 2003\u20132006 seasons. Despite scoring five first-class centuries in this period, he was released at the end of the 2006 season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gloucestershire County Cricket Club in 2005", "response": ["Ten wickets fell on the first day at Trent Bridge, and twenty on the second, as Nottinghamshire recorded a victory to extend their hold on Division One of the County Championship.

The second highest score was 39 from Trevor Penney who put on 168 in 31 overs with Lara. The last wicket partnership between Graeme Welch and Tim Munton grew to 68 before the innings was ended. Early in the reply Munton took the wickets of both openers before a 137 run partnership between Allan Lamb and Rob Bailey (54) recovered the situation. Welch, on his Championship debut, took the wickets of Lamb, Bailey and Mal Loye in a 22 ball spell and Northamptonshire lost their last 5 wickets for 27 runs allowing Warwickshire to enforce the follow on. Northamptonshire fared better second time around despite losing their first four wickets by the time the score reached 83. Loye and Kevin Curran (56) repaired the innings so the hosts ended day three with a lead of 84 runs and three wickets remaining. Loye, 99 overnight, reached his century before his seven-hour innings was ended. The resistance was continued by Russell Warren (94) and tail-ender Paul Taylor who took 113 balls for his 26.
