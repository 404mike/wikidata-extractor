A slow left-arm orthodox spin bowler and a lower order right-handed batsman, he played first-class and List A cricket from 1978 to 1994. He is currently an ECB appointed umpire on the professional circuit. He was born in Leicester and attended Lutterworth Grammar School.\nCook made his international debut against New Zealand. He picked up 32 wickets in his first four Tests, taking four five-fors, including one on debut, and a best bowling match return of 11 for 83 against Pakistan at Karachi. However, Cook's next 11 Tests fetched him 20 wickets at an average of 56.75, and he was dropped. His total of 52 Test wickets were taken at an average of 32.48.\nIn the domestic game, Cook played for Leicestershire, before later moving to Northamptonshire.Since retiring from the game, Cook has become an umpire and in November 2008, was promoted to the ECB full list for the 2009 season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Northamptonshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["* Nick Cook"]}, {"page": "Leicestershire County Cricket Club", "response": ["* Nick Cook"]}, {"page": "Richard Johnson (cricketer, born 1974)", "response": ["Despite his performance on debut, Johnson was not picked as part of the England Test squad to tour Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.  However, when Anderson was ruled out with a knee injury, Johnson cancelled his honeymoon and an injury to Steve Harmison in the first Test saw him selected for the second.  He responded by becoming the first English bowler since Nick Cook in 1983 to take five-wicket hauls in his first two Tests.  He finished with match figures of 9/93, and was once again rewarded by being named man of the match.  In the subsequent ODIs, Johnson claimed three wickets in the second match after remaining wicket-less in the first.  Johnson's third, and final, Test appearance came in the first Test against Sri Lanka in December 2003.  He claimed a solitary wicket, that of Kumar Sangakkara.  England opted to replace Hoggard and Johnson with a sixth batsman and James Kirtley for the second Test, with both bowlers receiving criticism for lacking the variety needed on a flat track at Galle."]}, {"page": "Birmingham and District Premier League", "response": ["* Nick Cook West Bromwich Dartmouth"]}, {"page": "Eddie Hemmings (cricketer)", "response": ["A change in policy saw the spin department filled by left armers such as Phil Edmonds and Nick Cook in 1983.  For the arrival of the West Indies in 1984, Pat Pocock was preferred as the England off spinner.  With Emburey's ban lifted in 1985, Hemmings was again forced onto the sidelines in the test arena.  By 1987 Emburey was not taking as many wickets as expected and, while he kept his place in the team as a masterly containing bowler, Hemmings began to press Emburey for his place in the World Cup in 1987 being instrumental in the win against the West Indies at Jaipur during that tournament. One of the finest moments of Hemmings' ODI career would come in the semifinals of the tournament where he took 4/52 to curtail India's chase. Hemmings' spell would account for the key wickets of Mohammad Azharuddin, Kapil Dev and Ravi Shastri."]}, {"page": "Neil Foster", "response": ["Foster made his Test debut against New Zealand at Lord's in 1983, with Jeremy Coney becoming his first wicket and only wicket of that game. Foster made his debut alongside other debutants, Nick Cook and Chris Smith, and it was the first time since 1959 that England had fielded three new players in a home Test."]}, {"page": "Bradford Premier League", "response": ["* Nick Cook (England)"]}, {"page": "Lutterworth College", "response": ["* Nick Cook, cricketer"]}, {"page": "1989 Ashes series", "response": ["|| Nick Cook || 17 June 1956 || Right || Left arm orthodox || Leicestershire", "The Australians replied with an impressive 447 driven by 4 half-centuries amongst their top six batsmen, and the fourth time in the series that they had done so. England's second innings was a mirror of the first, all out on the morning of the fifth day for 264, leaving the Australians with half a day to pick up the 78 runs required for victory, and the Ashes. A dogged not out century to wicket-keeper Jack Russell had delayed the inevitable, but when David Boon swept Nick Cook towards the square leg fence in the 32nd over of Australia's innings, the tourists passed the required mark and gained victory by 9 wickets, regaining the Ashes which England had held since 1985.", "England began day two in the hope that Robin Smith could go on to a big score, and the tail would be there to provide support. Whilst Smith edged towards 150, the hoped for wagging of the tail did not emerge. Foster went early in the first session, and although the final two batsmen Angus Fraser and Nick Cook both absorbed a few overs each to help Smith move onto 143, neither really bothered the scorers, Fraser out for 2, and Cook was 0 not out when Smiths wicket finally fell, caught by Hohns off Merv Hughes. England all out for 260 early on day two.", "Foster's replacement, Angus Fraser, likewise frustrated the Australian's who were going for the kill. He batted for 40 minutes in making 3 runs, and allowed Russell to continue pushing the score along. Fraser was out cutting off Trevor Hohns, caught by Geoff Marsh and England were left at 255 for 9. Nick Cook wasn't able to repeat the stalling of his two previous teammates and last only 10 minutes and 11 balls, although he did strike a clean boundary in his 5 runs. When he was caught behind off Merv Hughes, he left Russell stranded on 128 not out and England had been dismissed for 264 runs, leaving Australia a target of 78 with the best part of two sessions to get the runs.", "Taylor and Marsh went on the attack, sensing the possibility of a humiliating 10 wicket victory. However it was not to be. They made a solid opening stand of 62, but Marsh mistimed Emburey to be caught by Robinson for 31. That left Boon to come in, and he and Taylor mopped up the last few runs. Boon swept Nick Cook to the square leg boundary for four to bring up the winning runs, and Australia had regained the Ashes by taking an unassailable 3\u20130 lead with only two tests remaining to be played. Geoff Lawson's match figures of 9 for 153 earned him the man-of-the-match award.", "Day four began with more rain clouds looming, but holding off for the time being. Gower managed to push on from his overnight 43 to reach 76, and 27 from Derek Pringle, 31 to Nick Cook, and a well made 59 to number 9 Gladstone Small got England to 285, and avoid the follow-on. Terry Alderman had taken his sixth 5 wicket haul with figures of 5 for 66."]}]}}
