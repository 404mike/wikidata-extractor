The six-part series aired on BBC One in August 2021. It stars Suranne Jones, Rose Leslie, Shaun Evans, Paterson Joseph, and Martin Compston. The series is set in Scotland and much of the action takes place on a fictional ballistic missile submarine of the Royal Navy.", "Lucy Mangan of The Guardian found the first episode intriguing, awarding it five stars and describing it as \"solid, old-fashioned entertainment\". The Independent gave the first episode four out of five stars, praising the cast and Tom Edge's writing. In a four-starred review for London's Evening Standard, Katie Rosseinsky said: \"[S]cenes set in the depths of the sub are visually striking, lit up in reds and blues. Add in some jump scares, a handful of near-catastrophes and a couple of cliffhangers and you have all the makings of a taut mystery with intriguingly murky depths. Sunday nights are stressful again \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\" In a five-starred review, Empire magazine described Vigil as \"[a] relentless conspiracy drama bursting with performers who know how to keep their cards close to their chests. British TV doesn\u2019t get more thrilling than this.\" Hugo Rifkind in The Times described \"[s]etting a whodunnit on a submarine\" as \"a masterstroke\". Giving the programme four stars, Suzy Feay of the Financial Times said that \"The submarine setting has the welcome effect of pressure-cooking some fairly standard ingredients into a tasty concoction\"."]}]}}
