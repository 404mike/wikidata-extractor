He joined Wycombe Wanderers in July 2016 but initially failed to win a first-team place and instead spent time on loan at Eastleigh and Cheltenham Town.

However he tendered his resignation on 30 January, stating that \"I am very proud of the job we did in keeping the club in League Two and we leave the club in a better place on and off the pitch.
