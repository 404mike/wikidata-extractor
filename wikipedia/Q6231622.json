The latter was a pioneering work aimed at a West Indian audience. In 1961 he joined with astronomer Fred Hoyle (for scientific authenticity) to write another ground-breaking TV science fiction serial A for Andromeda, which set the tone for what was to follow in its stead. The success of A For Andromeda prompted a sequel, The Andromeda Breakthrough, in 1962.Following Andromeda, Elliot wrote more one-off plays, but his talents were perhaps underused by the BBC. He resigned from the corporation in 1963 but, as a parting gift, offered an option on his concept for the drama series Mogul (renamed The Troubleshooters from the second series) for which he wrote much of the seven series.His other works include programmes such as Fall of Eagles and Survival as well as novels including Duel, Blood Upon the Snow, A For Andromeda and The Andromeda Breakthrough (also co-written with Fred Hoyle).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Fred Hoyle", "response": ["* A for Andromeda, 1962 (co-authored with John Elliot)", "* Andromeda Breakthrough, 1965 (co-authored with John Elliot)"]}, {"page": "SF Masterworks", "response": ["|Fred Hoyle and John Elliot"]}, {"page": "A for Andromeda", "response": ["A for Andromeda is a British television science fiction drama serial first made and broadcast by the BBC in seven parts in 1961. Written by cosmologist Fred Hoyle, in conjunction with author and television producer John Elliot, it concerns a group of scientists who detect a radio signal from another galaxy that contains instructions for the design of an advanced computer. When the computer is built, it gives the scientists instructions for the creation of a living organism named Andromeda, but one of the scientists, John Fleming, fears that Andromeda's purpose is to subjugate humanity.", "Fred Hoyle was an astronomer best known for his work on the understanding of the creation of the elements through stellar nucleosynthesis, for developing the steady state theory of the universe and for coining the term \"Big Bang\" for the steady state theory's rival dynamic evolving model of the universe.Gregory, Fred Hoyle's Universe, passim. Hoyle also had a taste for science fiction, having written a novel, The Black Cloud (1957), about a cloud of interstellar gas that threatens the Earth; this was adapted for radio and broadcast on 14 December 1957 by the BBC Home Service.Pixley, Viewing Notes, p. 3 The BBC were also interested in adapting The Black Cloud for television but Hoyle had already signed away the movie rights. Hoyle followed The Black Cloud with another science fiction novel, Ossian's Ride (1958); this attracted the interest of Norman James, a BBC designer keen to move into television production, who contacted Hoyle with a view to obtaining the rights to the novel. In discussion with the writer, James learned that Hoyle was interested in writing an original story for television. James contacted John Elliot, the assistant head of the BBC Script Department, who was interested in making a science fiction serial. Elliot, along with James and BBC script editor Donald Bull, met with Hoyle who outlined a potential story for an eight-part serial; this was what would eventually become A for Andromeda. Hoyle drew his inspiration for the serial from the work of astronomer Frank Drake who at that time had begun \"Project Ozma\", one of the first experiments in the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI). In late June 1960, the BBC made an offer of 250 guineas to Hoyle for the idea, which would be dramatised for television, as a serial in seven 30-minute parts, by John Elliot.Mitton, Conflict in the Cosmos, p. 253. Hoyle replied, \"It has seemed to me that the overall sum of 250 gns is unsatisfactorily low. My own computations would suggest 1000 gns. I estimate that such a sum would still be only 2\u20133 percent of the receipts by the BBC from licences. Such a percentage still seems low \u2013 it is considerably less than rates available in the US\".Mitton, Conflict in the Cosmos, p.\u00a0254. Eventually, a fee of 700 guineas was agreed. Elliot delivered his draft scripts between March and April 1961; at this point it was decided that each episode should run for 45 minutes and so Elliot had to work to expand each script.Pixley, Production Notes, p.7.", "The prospect of novelising A for Andromeda arose early in the serial's production when Souvenir Press contacted the BBC in May 1961 indicating their interest in publishing a tie-in novel. John Elliot responded stating that while the concept had been Hoyle's, the characterisation, dialogue and plot structure was his. Elliot sent copies of the shooting scripts to Souvenir and was formally commissioned to write the novelisation in July 1961. The terms of the contract concerned Hoyle as they gave Souvenir first call on the sequel; he insisted that this could only be permitted if the sequel's novelisation was largely written by Elliot. Elliot delivered his manuscript on 28 September 1961. The novelisation was closer to the original 30-minute scripts and had much of the material required to pad each episode to 45 minutes removed. Promoting it as the story that would \"out-Quatermass Quatermass\", the book was published by Souvenir in February 1962.", "Category:Television shows written by John Elliot (author)"]}, {"page": "Lovell Telescope", "response": ["* In 1962, the telescope was mentioned in a sci-fi novel A for Andromeda, by Fred Hoyle and John Elliot."]}, {"page": "Play of the Month", "response": ["| (novel); adapted by John Elliot", "|, translated by Dmitri Makaroff, adapted by John Elliot"]}, {"page": "The Andromeda Breakthrough", "response": ["The Andromeda Breakthrough was a 1962 sequel to the popular BBC TV science fiction serial A for Andromeda, again written by Fred Hoyle and John Elliot.", "Category:Television shows written by John Elliot (author)"]}, {"page": "Mathilde Kschessinska", "response": ["* Fall of Eagles, 13-part television drama created by John Elliot for the BBC; portrayed by Jan Francis (1974)."]}, {"page": "Fall of Eagles", "response": ["Fall of Eagles is a 13-part British television drama aired by the BBC in 1974.
