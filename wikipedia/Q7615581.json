She was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1998, and is also a fellow of the Welsh Academy. Her novel The Element of Water was longlisted for the Booker Prize in 2001, and won the Wales Book of the Year in 2002.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Emily Bront\u00eb", "response": ["Charlotte Bront\u00eb remains the primary source of information about Emily, although as an elder sister, writing publicly about her only shortly after her death, she is considered by certain scholars not to be a neutral witness. Stevie Davies believes that there is what might be called Charlotte's smoke-screen and argues that Emily evidently shocked her, to the point where she may even have doubted her sister's sanity. After Emily's death, Charlotte rewrote her character, history and even poems on a more acceptable (to her and the bourgeois reading public) model. Biographer Claire O'Callaghan suggests that the trajectory of Bront\u00eb's legacy was altered significantly by Elizabeth Gaskell\u2019s biography of Charlotte, concerning not only because Gaskell did not visit Haworth until after Emily\u2019s death, but also because Gaskell admits to disliking what she did know of Emily in her biography of Charlotte. As O'Callaghan and others have noted, Charlotte was Gaskell's primary source of information on Emily's life and may have exaggerated or fabricated Emily\u2019s frailty and shyness to cast herself in the role of maternal saviour."]}, {"page": "Jane Eyre", "response": ["The early sequences, in which Jane is sent to Lowood, a harsh boarding school, are derived from the author's own experiences. Helen Burns's death from tuberculosis (referred to as consumption) recalls the deaths of Charlotte Bront\u00eb's sisters, Elizabeth and Maria, who died of the disease in childhood as a result of the conditions at their school, the Clergy Daughters School at Cowan Bridge, near Tunstall, Lancashire. Mr. Brocklehurst is based on Rev. William Carus Wilson (1791\u20131859), the Evangelical minister who ran the school. Additionally, John Reed's decline into alcoholism and dissolution recalls the life of Charlotte's brother Branwell, who became an opium and alcohol addict in the years preceding his death. Finally, like Jane, Charlotte became a governess. These facts were revealed to the public in The Life of Charlotte Bront\u00eb (1857) by Charlotte's friend and fellow novelist Elizabeth Gaskell.Stevie Davies, Introduction and Notes to Jane Eyre.

Dana Aspinall writes \"Since its first appearance, some time between 1588 and 1594, Shrew has elicited a panoply of heartily supportive, ethically uneasy, or altogether disgusted responses to its rough-and-tumble treatment of the 'taming' of the 'curst shrew' Katherina, and obviously, of all potentially unruly wives.\" Phyllis Rackin argues that \"seen in the context of current anxieties, desires and beliefs, Shakespeare's play seems to prefigure the most oppressive modern assumptions about women and to validate those assumptions as timeless truths.\" Stevie Davies says that responses to Shrew have been \"dominated by feelings of unease and embarrassment, accompanied by the desire to prove that Shakespeare cannot have meant what he seems to be saying; and that therefore he cannot really be saying it.\" Philippa Kelly asks:"]}, {"page": "The Tenant of Wildfell Hall", "response": ["According to Stevie Davies, Anne's depiction of the woman as fee-earning artist \"trebly trespasses on the domain of the masculine: female artists dabbed in water-colours or sketched decoratively in pen and ink; ladies did not engage in trade; and, besides, tools of her trade [legally belonging to her husband] in this case count as stolen.\"  Melinda Maunsell believes that Helen is \"both revealed and concealed by her artistic hand; providing her with an acceptable means of expression within her social construction, the artists hand also offers a form of independence, a possibility of earning a living, in a period when a woman had virtually no independent power base in any sphere.\"", "Often, when depicting the same subject as her sisters, Anne presents it in a completely different light: Wildfell Hall, an old superannuated mansion, she pictures not as a \u2018haunted\u2019 house like Thornfield Hall or Wuthering Heights in her sisters' works, but as a decayed relic of an outworn patrician class, whose pretensions are mocked by the recrudescence of building into moor. Stevie Davies has argued that Anne's ancient hall demystifies Gothic. Wildfell Hall is not haunted, it is simply dilapidated, damp and un-welcoming.", "Stevie Davies believes that the settings and characters in The Tenant are influenced by Anne's juvenile fiction. In their childhood Emily and Anne Bront\u00eb created the imaginary kingdom of Gondal, about which they composed prose and poems. Thomas Moore's biography of Byron, with its description of womanizing, gaming and carousing, directly influenced the Gondal mythos and was echoed in Bront\u00eb's adult works. The characteristics of Arthur Huntington and Annabella Wilmot, both self-indulgent sexual transgressors, may be the relics of Gondal, where most of the main heroes were extravagant and led adventurous lives.", "The Tenant has established its reputation as a landmark feminist text. In her 1996 introduction to the novel, Stevie Davies called it \"a feminist manifesto of revolutionary power and intelligence.\" The novel's framing structure, long dismissed as faulty, started to get acclaim as a fitting narrative device, essential to Anne's critical and artistic purposes."]}, {"page": "Agnes Grey", "response": ["Stevie Davies points to the intellectual wit behind the text: ", "Stevie Davies remarks that Agnes Grey could be called a \"Protestant spiritual autobiography\". First, the book retains a sober tone, and Agnes displays a very strong Puritan personality reflected in her name. Agnes is derived from the Greek for chaste, hagne, and Grey commonly is associated with \"Quakers and quietists to express radical dissociation from gaudy worldiness\".", "Beyond the treatment of animals, Anne carefully describes the actions and expressions of animals. Stevie Davies observes that this acuity of examination along with the moral reflection on the treatment of animals suggests that, for Anne, \"animals are fellow beings with an ethical claim on human protection.\""]}, {"page": "2004 in literature", "response": ["*Stevie Davies \u2013 Kith & Kin"]}, {"page": "Royal Society of Literature", "response": ["| Stevie Davies"]}, {"page": "Davies", "response": ["* Stevie Davies, Welsh novelist"]}, {"page": "2002 in Wales", "response": ["**English language: Stevie Davies, The Element of Water"]}, {"page": "Morriston", "response": ["*Stevie Davies, award-winning Welsh novelist"]}, {"page": "Wales Book of the Year", "response": ["| Stevie Davies"]}, {"page": "The Mysteries of Glass", "response": ["*Stevie Davies in The Independent writes \"Gee's gentle and restrained story celebrates the sanctity of the ordinary and the beauty of holiness.

It treats us to passages of Scripture and chunks of liturgy. The dialect characters ought to be shot (\"Minna Davies! How be thee keeping this long time?\"). The archaic theological conflicts have little sharpness. However, the novel transcends all this. Its clement and often sombre prose intelligently gratifies a taste for romance.
