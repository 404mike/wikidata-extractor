The extractive industries sometimes left a trail of cruelty, on occasion of horror. The Peruvian Amazon Rubber Company was started by then villainous Julio C\u00e9sar Arana to exploit the Putumayo River valley, disputed land between Peru and Colombia, isolated and unpoliced. Trouble soon began. The company became financed, and then taken over and directed, by a London-based concern which took the name Peruvian Amazon Company, later notorious. Thousands, probably tens of thousands, of Huitoto (Witoto) natives were enslaved to work in rubber collection, and subjected to torture; hundreds perhaps thousands were murdered, many were raped; the tribe's numbers plummeted by perhaps four-fifths. In 1907 a young traveler from the USA, Walter Ernest Hardenburg, discovered and began to expose the company's crimes, and later also Roger Casement, a British official from Ireland. It became a major scandal in the world press.

She discusses the misery endured in modern Iquitos by newly arrived forest Indians, often called cholos. Being the poorest, they are distinct from both trigue\u00f1os (of middle rank), and the elite, these last two groups being mestizos. Although \"jungle wise\" the cholos have not yet picked up \"street smarts\". Hence their Indian identity seems to mark them as targets for unscrupulous urban hucksters. Especially since 1900, the Peruvian Amazon has been in a state of continual transformation, for better or for worse. Among intrusions during the last five centuries: the military, missions, and traders; the government, settlers, and botanists; rubber, lumber, and oil; ranching, air travel, and urban retail; transistor radios, tourism, and mobile phones.Cf., Davis (1996), e.g., at 252\u201353."]}, {"page": "2014 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Anthony Smith, 88, explorer, balloonist and television presenter."]}, {"page": "Deaths in July 2014", "response": ["*Anthony Smith, 88, British explorer, balloonist and television presenter.RIP Anthony Smith"]}, {"page": "SS Anglo Saxon (1929)", "response": ["By the fiftieth anniversary in 1990, the boat had been put in storage at the museum.
