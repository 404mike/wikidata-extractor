Over time, many of the NDR musicians could not always get time off to tour with the Last band, so Last used this chance to make the orchestra more international. Some of the top musicians who have played in the James Last orchestra include Canadian violinist Trudean Conrad, Welsh drummer Terry Jenkins, Belgian trombonist Georges Delagaye, Swedish trumpeter Leif Uvemark and a number of American trumpeters including Bob Lanese, Rick Kiefer and brothers Chuck Findley and Bob Findley. Another trumpeter, Derek Watkins from England, recorded with The Beatles, playing on \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" and \"Revolution 1\". Some musicians are family: father-and-son violinists Dmiter Pintev and Stefan Pintev, and husband and wife Bob Coassin (trumpet, USA) and Anne-Louise Comerford (viola, Australia). Bob Coassin is widely known in America. All in all, about 20 different countries are represented in the membership of the orchestra.(All of Which were Recruited through the various James Last Admin Offices in Hamburg, London, and North America when the band became more of a Multi-National orchestra).", "James Last took much influence from the world of rock and pop when arranging music for his orchestra. A typical example is his version of \"Here Comes the Sun\" from the album Beachparty 2 which is influenced by the version sung by Richie Havens in the film Woodstock. Last's epic version of \"Greensleeves\" is a combination of the styles of Iron Butterfly and Blood, Sweat & Tears, two bands that he publicly declared his favourites in the late 1960s. His studio recordings do not always capture the energy unleashed at his live concerts where a combination of skilful arranging and talented musicians give some surprising performances. His versions of \"Nature Boy\" featuring Chuck Findley and \"MacArthur Park\" featuring Derek Watkins are two examples. James Last has so far (2013) sold more than 80 million albums during his career, which has honoured him with 208 Golden and 11 Silver records.", ": Adam Weckerle (1968\u20131970), Kuddl Pohle (1968\u20131970), Manfred Moch (1968\u20131972, 1976\u20131977), Heinz Habermann (1968\u20131972, 1976\u20131978), Leif Uvemark (1969\u20131973), Rick Kiefer (1973\u20131976, 1978), Dieter Kock (1970\u20131975), Alex Malempre (1972), Bob Lanese (1972\u20132002), Ack van Rooyen (1975), Eddie Engels (1975), Lennart Axelsson (1973\u20131977, 1978\u20131980, 1990\u20131991), H\u00e5kan Nyqvist (1975\u20132002), Derek Watkins (1976\u20132007), Gregory Bowen (1978), Lawrence Elam (1977), Kenny Wheeler (1977), Etienne Cap (1977), Jan Kohlin (1980\u20131981), Bob Coassin (1981\u20132015), Jan Oosthof (1991, 2002\u20132015), Ingolf Burkhardt (1991), Stuart Brooks (2002), John Barclay (2002), Martin Kr\u00e4mer {2002), Chuck Findley (2001-), Bob Findley (2002-)"]}, {"page": "The Drift", "response": ["* Derek Watkins \u2013 flugelhorn"]}, {"page": "Voice (Alison Moyet album)", "response": ["* Derek Watkins \u2013 trumpet (tracks: 3, 6, 10)", "* Derek Watkins \u2013 flugelhorn (tracks: 2, 6) "]}, {"page": "Derek Watkins", "response": ["*Derek Watkins (trumpeter) (1945\u20132013), British session musician", "* Derek Watkins, dock workers shop steward and one of the Pentonville Five"]}, {"page": "Forever Now (Level 42 album)", "response": ["*John Thirkell, Derek Watkins and Stuart Brooks \u2013 trumpets"]}, {"page": "Bankstatement", "response": ["** Derek Watkins - trumpet"]}, {"page": "For Your Eyes Only (soundtrack)", "response": ["# \"For Your Eyes Only (Instrumental)\" \u2013 Fl\u00fcgelhorn solo: Derek Watkins"]}, {"page": "Baby, the Stars Shine Bright", "response": ["* Alan Downey, Derek Watkins, Luke Tunney, Stuart Brooks \u2013 trumpet"]}, {"page": "The Manhattan Transfer Live", "response": ["* Tony Fisher, Bobby Haughey, Ronnie Hughes and Derek Watkins \u2013 trumpet"]}, {"page": "Matt Bianco (album)", "response": ["*Derek Watkins: trumpet on tracks No. 3, and #9; flugelhorn on track No. 3"]}, {"page": "Brian Lemon", "response": ["|with Derek Watkins"]}, {"page": "Forever Now (Level 42 song)", "response": ["*John Thirkell, Derek Watkins and Stuart Brooks - Trumpets"]}, {"page": "Time for Fantasy", "response": ["*Derek Watkins- trumpet, flugelhorn"]}, {"page": "Kenny Clarke/Francy Boland Big Band", "response": ["The band collaborated with Stan Getz, Zoot Sims, Derek Watkins, and Phil Woods."]}, {"page": "Music for Large & Small Ensembles", "response": ["* Derek Watkins \u2013 trumpet"]}]}}
