A total of 1,046 ballots (4,750 votes) were cast in Stanley, representing a turn-out of 75.4%, and 242 ballots (675 votes) in Camp, representing a turn-out of 85.5%. As no political parties are active in the Falklands, all the candidates stood as Independents. The Chief Executive of the Falkland Islands, Keith Padgett, acted as returning officer. It was the second election since the new Constitution came into force replacing the Legislative Council (which had existed since 1845) with the Legislative Assembly."]}, {"page": "2013 Falkland Islands sovereignty referendum", "response": ["The results were announced by Keith Padgett, the Chief Executive of the Falkland Islands, at 22:40 FKST (UTC\u22123), in Stanley Town Hall. The high vote to remain a British territory was widely expected, with even the small Argentine population on the islands saying they would vote 'Yes'. Several commentators, including the BBC's correspondent Caroline Wyatt, had anticipated a fairly large 'No' vote from islanders who wanted a second referendum on independence. However, out of the 1,518 ballots cast, only three voters were against keeping the islands' current status. Turnout was over 90% with 1,650 islanders eligible to vote in a population of 2,841. It is possible that at least one of the three people that voted 'No' did so out of a desire for full independence. There was one blank and one invalid votes each, the latter coming from a voter who both ticked the Yes box and crossed the No one. Despite recognizing the intent for a yes vote, the officials considered it invalid, as the rules written directly above on the ballot clearly forbade making signs in both boxes. Around twenty to thirty \"doubtful\" votes with signs others than ticks or crosses in the yes box were examined during the count, and deemed valid yes votes."]}, {"page": "List of state leaders in 2013", "response": ["**Head of Government\u00a0\u2013 Keith Padgett, Chief Executive of the Falkland Islands (2012\u20132016)"]}, {"page": "List of state leaders in 2014", "response": ["**Head of Government\u00a0\u2013 Keith Padgett, Chief Executive of the Falkland Islands (2012\u20132016)"]}, {"page": "List of state leaders in 2015", "response": ["**Head of Government\u00a0\u2013 Keith Padgett, Chief Executive of the Falkland Islands (2012\u20132016)"]}, {"page": "List of state leaders in 2016", "response": ["**# Keith Padgett, Chief Executive of the Falkland Islands (2012\u20132016)"]}, {"page": "List of governors of dependent territories in the 21st century", "response": ["::*Keith Padgett, Chief executive (2012\u20132016)"]}, {"page": "List of leaders of dependent territories in 2016", "response": ["**# Keith Padgett, Chief Executive of the Falkland Islands (2012\u20132016)"]}, {"page": "List of leaders of dependent territories in 2015", "response": ["**Chief Executive \u2013 Keith Padgett, Chief Executive of the Falkland Islands (2012\u20132016)"]}, {"page": "List of leaders of dependent territories in 2014", "response": ["**Chief Executive \u2013 Keith Padgett, Chief Executive of the Falkland Islands (2012\u20132016)"]}, {"page": "List of leaders of dependent territories in 2013", "response": ["**Chief Executive \u2013 Keith Padgett, Chief Executive of the Falkland Islands (2012\u20132016)"]}]}}
