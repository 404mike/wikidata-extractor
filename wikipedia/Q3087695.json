He is a professor at the University of Bristol, has written 14 books and has appeared on British television and radio. He held a fellowship at Magdalen College, Oxford, and is a Commissioner of English Heritage.\nBorn in Ootacamund, India, his family returned to England, and he attended a school in Ilford and became particularly interested in archaeology. He volunteered in a number of excavations until 1976 and visited the country's chambered tombs. He studied history at Pembroke College, Cambridge, and then Magdalen College, Oxford, before he lectured in history at the University of Bristol from 1981. Specialising in Early Modern Britain, he wrote three books on the subject: The Royalist War Effort (1981), The Restoration (1985) and Charles the Second (1990).\nIn the 1990s, he wrote books about historical paganism, folklore and Contemporary Paganism in Britain; The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles (1991), The Rise and Fall of Merry England (1994), The Stations of the Sun (1996) and The Triumph of the Moon (1999), the latter of which would come to be praised as a seminal text in the discipline of Pagan studies. In the following decade, he wrote on other topics: a book about Siberian shamanism in the western imagination, Shamans (2001), a collection of essays on folklore and Paganism, Witches, Druids and King Arthur (2003) and then two books on the role of the Druids in the British imagination, The Druids (2007) and Blood and Mistletoe (2009).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Aleister Crowley", "response": ["Crowley's theological beliefs were not clear. The historian Ronald Hutton noted that some of Crowley's writings could be used to argue that he was an atheist, while some support the idea that he was a polytheist, and others would bolster the idea that he was a mystical monotheist. On the basis of the teachings in The Book of the Law, Crowley described a pantheon of three deities taken from the ancient Egyptian pantheon: Nuit, Hadit, and Ra-Hoor-Khuit. In 1928, he made the claim that all true deities were derived from this trinity. Jason Josephson-Storm has argued that Crowley built on 19th-century attempts to link early Christianity to pre-Christian religions, such as Frazer's Golden Bough, to synthesize Christian theology and Neopaganism while remaining critical of institutional and traditional Christianity.", "Crowley considered himself to be one of the outstanding figures of his time. The historian Ronald Hutton stated that in Crowley's youth, he was \"a self-indulgent and flamboyant young man\" who \"set about a deliberate flouting and provocation of social and religious norms\", while being shielded from an \"outraged public opinion\" by his inherited wealth. Hutton also described Crowley as having both an \"unappeasable desire\" to take control of any organisation that he belonged to, and \"a tendency to quarrel savagely\" with those who challenged him. Crowley biographer Martin Booth asserted that Crowley was \"self-confident, brash, eccentric, egotistic, highly intelligent, arrogant, witty, wealthy, and, when it suited him, cruel\". Similarly, Richard B. Spence noted that Crowley was \"capable of immense physical and emotional cruelty\". Biographer Lawrence Sutin noted that Crowley exhibited \"courage, skill, dauntless energy, and remarkable focus of will\" while at the same time showing a \"blind arrogance, petty fits of bile, [and] contempt for the abilities of his fellow men\". The Thelemite Lon Milo DuQuette noted that Crowley \"was by no means perfect\" and \"often alienated those who loved him dearest.\""]}, {"page": "Beltane", "response": ["According to 17th-century historian Geoffrey Keating, there was a great gathering at the hill of Uisneach each Beltane in medieval Ireland, where a sacrifice was made to a god named Beil. Keating wrote that two bonfires would be lit in every district of Ireland, and cattle would be driven between them to protect them from disease.Keating, Geoffrey. The History of Ireland \u2013 Translated by David Comyn and Patrick S. Dinneen . CELT: Corpus of Electronic Texts. There is no reference to such a gathering in the annals, but the medieval Dindsenchas includes a tale of a hero lighting a holy fire on Uisneach that blazed for seven years. Ronald Hutton writes that this may \"preserve a tradition of Beltane ceremonies there\", but adds \"Keating or his source may simply have conflated this legend with the information in Sanas Chormaic to produce a piece of pseudo-history.\" Nevertheless, excavations at Uisneach in the 20th century found evidence of large fires and charred bones, showing it to have been ritually significant.Patterson, Nerys.

All hearth fires and candles would be doused before the bonfire was lit, generally on a mountain or hill.Danaher, Kevin (1972) The Year in Ireland: Irish Calendar Customs Dublin, Mercier.  pp. 86\u2013127 Ronald Hutton writes that \"To increase the potency of the holy flames, in Britain at least they were often kindled by the most primitive of all means, of friction between wood.\" In the 19th century, for example, John Ramsay described Scottish Highlanders kindling a need-fire or force-fire at Beltane. Such a fire was deemed sacred. In the 19th century, the ritual of driving cattle between two fires\u2014as described in Sanas Cormaic almost 1000 years before\u2014was still practised across most of Ireland and in parts of Scotland. Sometimes the cattle would be driven \"around\" a bonfire or be made to leap over flames or embers. The people themselves would do likewise. In the Isle of Man, people ensured that the smoke blew over them and their cattle. When the bonfire had died down, people would daub themselves with its ashes and sprinkle it over their crops and livestock. Burning torches from the bonfire would be taken home, where they would be carried around the house or boundary of the farmsteadEvans, Irish Folk Ways, pp. 274\u2013275 and would be used to re-light the hearth. From these rituals, it is clear that the fire was seen as having protective powers. Similar rituals were part of May Day, Midsummer or Easter customs in other parts of the British Isles and mainland Europe.Frazer, James George (1922). The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion. Chapter 62: The Fire-Festivals of Europe . According to Frazer, the fire rituals are a kind of imitative or sympathetic magic. According to one theory, they were meant to mimic the Sun and to \"ensure a needful supply of sunshine for men, animals, and plants\". According to another, they were meant to symbolically \"burn up and destroy all harmful influences\".Frazer, James George (1922). The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion.

It is also the most-filmed of Dickens's stories, with many versions dating from the early years of cinema. According to the historian Ronald Hutton, the current state of the observance of Christmas is largely the result of a mid-Victorian revival of the holiday spearheaded by A Christmas Carol. Dickens catalysed the emerging Christmas as a family-centred festival of generosity, in contrast to the dwindling community-based and church-centred observations, as new middle-class expectations arose.. Its archetypal figures (Scrooge, Tiny Tim, the Christmas ghosts) entered into Western cultural consciousness. \"Merry Christmas\", a prominent phrase from the tale, was popularised following the appearance of the story.. The term Scrooge became a synonym for miser, and his exclamation \"Bah! Humbug!'\", a dismissal of the festive spirit, likewise gained currency as an idiom..

Arguments against Murray's thesis would eventually include arguments against Leland. Witchcraft scholar Jeffrey Russell devoted some of his 1980 book A History of Witchcraft: Sorcerers, Heretics and Pagans to arguing against the claims Leland presented in Aradia. Historian Elliot Rose's A Razor for a Goat dismissed Aradia as a collection of incantations unsuccessfully attempting to portray a religion. In his book Triumph of the Moon, historian Ronald Hutton doubted not only of the existence of the religion that Aradia claimed to represent, and that the traditions Leland presented were unlike anything found in actual medieval literature,Hutton, 2000, pp. 145\u2013148. but also of the existence of Leland's sources, arguing that it is more likely that Leland created the entire story than that Leland could be so easily \"duped\".

Some Pagan practitioners also prefer \"Neopaganism\", believing that the prefix conveys the reformed nature of the religion, such as its rejection of practices such as animal sacrifice. Conversely, most Pagans do not use the word \"Neopagan\", with some expressing disapproval of it, arguing that the term \"neo\" offensively disconnects them from what they perceive as their pre-Christian forebears. To avoid causing offense, many scholars in the English-speaking world have begun using the prefixes \"modern\" or \"contemporary\" rather than \"neo\". Several Pagan studies scholars, such as Ronald Hutton and Sabina Magliocco, have emphasized the use of the upper-case \"Paganism\" to distinguish the modern movement from the lower-case \"paganism\", a term commonly used for pre-Christian belief systems. In 2015, Rountree stated that this lower case/upper case division was \"now [the] convention\" in Pagan studies. Among the critics of the upper-case P are York and Andras Corban-Arthen, president of the ECER.

English esotericist Gerald Gardner was at the forefront of the burgeoning Wiccan movement. He claimed to have been initiated by the New Forest coven in 1939, and that the religion he discovered was a survival of the pagan witch-cult described in Murray's theory. Various forms of Wicca have since evolved or been adapted from Gardner's British Traditional Wicca or Gardnerian Wicca, such as Alexandrian Wicca. Other forms loosely based on Gardner's teachings are Faery Wicca, Kemetic Wicca, Judeo-Paganism or jewitchery, and Dianic Wicca or feminist Wicca, which emphasizes the divine feminine, often creating women-only or lesbian-only groups.Telesco (2005) p.114 In the academic community Wicca has also been interpreted as having close affinities with process philosophy.", "A study by Ronald Hutton compared a number of different sources (including membership lists of major UK organizations, attendance at major events, subscriptions to magazines, etc.) and used standard models for extrapolating likely numbers.

Hutton says it may be that no religious rites are mentioned because, centuries after Christianization, the writers had no record of them. Hutton suggests Samhain may not have been particularly associated with the supernatural. He says that the gatherings of royalty and warriors on Samhain may simply have been an ideal setting for such tales, in the same way that many Arthurian tales are set at courtly gatherings at Christmas or Pentecost.Hutton, Ronald (1996) Stations of the Sun: A History of the Ritual Year in Britain.

The total number of witch trials in Europe which are known to have ended in executions is around 12,000. Based on Ronald Hutton's essay Counting the Witch Hunt. Prominent contemporaneous critics of witch-hunts included Gianfrancesco Ponzinibio (fl. 1520), Johannes Wier (1515\u20131588), Reginald Scot (1538\u20131599), Cornelius Loos (1546\u20131595), Anton Praetorius (1560\u20131613), Alonso Salazar y Fr\u00edas (1564\u20131636), Friedrich Spee (1591\u20131635), and Balthasar Bekker (1634\u20131698).Charles Alva Hoyt, Witchcraft, Southern Illinois University Press, 2nd edition, 1989, pp. 66\u201370, .

Hutton nevertheless believed that this approach could be \"fundamentally challenged\"."]}, {"page": "Aradia", "response": ["In 1899, the American folklorist Charles Godfrey Leland published Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches, a book which he claimed was the religious text belonging to a group of Tuscan witches who venerated Diana as the Queen of the Witches. He also claimed that he had been given the book by a Tuscan woman named Maddalena, although historians such as Ronald Hutton have disputed the truth of these such claims.", "Leland also equates Aradia with Herodias, explaining his speculation that Herodias was actually Lilith: \"This was not ... derived from the Herodias of the New Testament, but from an earlier replica of Lilith, bearing the same name ... So far back as the sixth century the worship of Herodias and Diana by witches was condemned by a Church Council at Ancyra.\"Leland is referring to the Canon Episcopi. Pipernus and other writers have noted the evident identification of Herodias with Lilith. Historian Ronald Hutton suggests in Triumph of the Moon that this identification with Herodias was inspired by the work of Jules Michelet in Satanism and Witchcraft. Anthropologist and field folklorist Sabina Magliocco, on the other hand, is willing to consider a connection between the Italian Erodiade (Herodias), the  Cult of Herodias, the night assembly, and Aradia."]}, {"page": "Rhiannon", "response": ["Like some other figures of British/Welsh literary tradition, Rhiannon may be a reflection of an earlier Celtic deity. Her name appears to derive from the reconstructed Brittonic form *R\u012bganton\u0101, a derivative of *r\u012bgan- \"queen\". In the First Branch of the Mabinogi, Rhiannon is strongly associated with horses, and so is her son Pryderi. She is often considered to be related to the Gaulish horse goddess Epona.e.g. Sioned Davies (trans.), The Mabinogion, Oxford 2007, p. 231. She and her son are often depicted as mare and foal. Like Epona, she sometimes sits on her horse in a calm, stoic way.Gruffydd, W. J. Rhiannon: An Inquiry into the Origins of the First and Third Branches of the Mabinogi This connection with Epona is generally accepted among scholars of the Mabinogi and Celtic studies, but Ronald Hutton, a historian of paganism, is skeptical."]}, {"page": "Belisama", "response": ["The presence of the goddess in  Britain is more difficult to establish.

There are, however, indications that they may be fertility spirits of some kind. Ronald Hutton argues that in some cases they are carrying shapes that can be seen as eggs, symbolizing life and rebirth, while Graham Webster has argued that the curved hoods are similar in many ways to contemporary Roman curved phallus stones. However, several of these figures also seem to carry swords or daggers, and Henig discusses them in the context of warrior cults."]}, {"page": "The White Goddess", "response": ["However, The White Goddess was accepted as history by many non-scholarly readers. According to Ronald Hutton, the book \"remains a major source of confusion about the ancient Celts and influences many un-scholarly views of Celtic paganism\". Hilda Ellis Davidson criticised Graves as having \"misled many innocent readers with his eloquent but deceptive statements about a nebulous goddess in early Celtic literature\", and stated that he was \"no authority\" on the subject matter he presented.Davidson, Hilda Ellis (1998). Roles of the Northern Goddess, page 11. Routledge.  While Graves made the association between Goddesses and the moon appear \"natural\", it was not so to the Celts or some other ancient peoples. In response to critics, Graves accused literary scholars of being psychologically incapable of interpreting mythInter alia \u2013 The White Goddess, Farrar Straus Giroux, p. 224.  or too concerned with maintaining their perquisites to go against the majority view.
