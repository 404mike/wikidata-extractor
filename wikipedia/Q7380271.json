He received great help and encouragement from Theo Tyler, Fellow and Tutor in Law at Balliol College, Oxford. Tyler himself was nearly blind. Under his stimulus and rigour, Cross gained a First in Jurisprudence in 1935. '[H]ad he not been overstanding for honours he would have obtained a First in BCL, which he took in 1937', according to H. L. A. Hart. He was awarded the degree of D.C.L. in 1958.Cross became a solicitor in 1939 and was a tutor, Law Society, from 1945 to 1948.\nFrom 1948 to 1964 he was a Fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford.

His family was Jewish. He graduated from Harvard University in 1953 with an A.B. summa cum laude, where he majored in philosophy and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa in his junior year. He then attended Magdalen College, Oxford, where he was a Rhodes Scholar and a student of Sir Rupert Cross and J.H.C. Morris. Upon completion of his final exams at Oxford, the examiners were so impressed with his script that the Professor of Jurisprudence (then H. L. A. Hart) was summoned to read it. He was awarded a B.A. with a Congratulatory first. Dworkin then attended Harvard Law School, graduating in 1957 with a Juris Doctor, magna cum laude. He then clerked for Judge Learned Hand of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.

Not long after, Cornelia Sorabji was the first woman to read Law at Oxford in 1889. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, there were prominent professors in Oxford such as Frederick Pollock, William Anson, and Albert Dicey. The emergence of a large community of legal scholars in twenty-five men's colleges can be dated from the 1920s and 1930s, but the development was consolidated in the 1950s and 1960s, when Law Fellowships also became common in the women's colleges.
