A tough second row forward with a strong physique, Arthur was often criticised for being over-vigorous. Though his style of play was fairly typical for Welsh rugby at the time.\nArthur was also a strong scummager and was adaptable in the open and was excellent in the line-out. His signature move was his line-out 'flip', where he would grab the ball one handed and guide it to his waiting scrum-half.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1986 in Wales", "response": ["*1 November \u2013 Tom Arthur, Wales national rugby player, 80"]}, {"page": "Arthur (surname)", "response": ["*Tom Arthur (rugby union) (1906\u20131986), Welsh rugby player"]}, {"page": "1906 in Wales", "response": ["*10 January - Tom Arthur, Wales international rugby player"]}, {"page": "Glynneath RFC", "response": ["* Tom Arthur"]}, {"page": "1931\u201332 South Africa rugby union tour of Britain and Ireland", "response": ["Neath & Aberavon: Phil Lloyd (Neath), Dan Jones (Neath), Glyn Daniels (Neath), Gwyn Moore (Neath), Fred Nicholas (Aberavon), Wilf Selby (Aberavon), Tal Harris (Aberavon), Tom Arthur (Neath), Miah McGrath (Aberavon), Ned Jenkins (Aberavon), Walter Vickery (Aberavon), Gordon Hopkins (Neath), Arthur Lemon (Neath), Cyril Griffiths (Aberavon) (Capt.), Glyn Prosser (Neath)", "Wales: Jack Bassett (Penarth) (capt.), Jack Morley (Newport), Claude Davey (Swansea), Frank Williams (Cardiff), Ronnie Boon (Cardiff), Dicky Ralph (Newport), Wick Powell (London Welsh), Tom Day (Swansea), Lonza Bowdler, (Cross Keys), Archie Skym (Cardiff), Ned Jenkins (Aberavon), Tom Arthur (Neath), Arthur Lemon (Neath), Watcyn Thomas (Swansea), Will Davies (Swansea)"]}, {"page": "Ned Jenkins", "response": ["Ned Jenkins (28 July 1904 \u2013 8 November 1990) was an international rugby union lock who represented Wales and played club rugby for Aberavon.

The match was against England at their national stadium, Twickenham. Wales had failed to win at the ground in their first nine attempts, and the Welsh failure at the ground was known as the 'Twickenham bogey'. Isaac was placed at open-side flanker, opposite the veteran Tom Arthur who was positioned on the blind side.Smith (1980), pg 274. In an exciting match Isaac, along with Turnbull, and Arthur, continually spoiled the English scrum.Smith (1980), pg 276. When Isaac caused the English half-backs to loose the loose maul, Watcyn Thomas heeled the ball back for Wooller, and then Davey to feed Ronnie Boon who scored a Welsh try.Smith (1980), pg 277. The game ended 7\u20133, with all the Welsh points scored by Boon, who had also placed a drop goal. Isaacs played just one more international game in the very next match of the Home Nations Championship against Scotland at St. Helens, his international career identical to that of Raymond Bark-Jones."]}, {"page": "Tommy Scourfield", "response": ["Scourfield was born in Pontypridd in 1909 before moving to Ynysybwl. In 1930 Scourfield was selected for his one and only appearance for Wales in a game against France as part of the 1930 Five Nations Championship. Under the captaincy of Guy Morgan, Scourfield made the trip to Paris to play the French at Stade Colombes. The game was an extremely bad-tempered affair from a French team well known throughout the 1930s for their rough play. The game took a turn for the worse when Scourfield collected a loose ball from the back and kicked it into touch. One of the French players who was chasing the ball, ignored the fact that the ball was cleared, continued his race towards Scourfield and punched him in the head. Later on Bert Day, the Welsh hooker, was kicked in the faceOn This Day \u2013 21 April ESPN requiring nine stitches. When Welsh forward Tom Arthur retaliated on the wrong French player, the game fell into running fist fights, with the referee having to halt the game on several occasions. Wales won the game 11\u20130, but Scourfield did not represent Wales at rugby union again."]}, {"page": "Thomas Arthur", "response": ["Thomas Arthur or Tom Arthur may refer to:", "*Tom Arthur (rugby union) (1906\u20131986), Welsh international rugby union player", "*Tom Arthur (Australian politician) (1883\u20131953)", "*Tom Arthur (Scottish politician) (born 1985), member of Scottish Parliament"]}]}}
