He generally opened the batting, though he moved down the order towards the end of his career. He had a good range of strokes, most notably the drive and the hook.\nBorn in Sutton, Surrey, Fletcher joined Surrey immediately after the war. He had only a single game in 1946, but the following year established his place in the side and scored four hundreds. One of those came in strange circumstances, when he played for the North against the South at Kingston upon Thames because they were a man short.\nFrom 1948 to 1951 he fared poorly, but he returned to form in 1952, when his 1960 runs at 37.96 made an important contribution to the first of Surrey's seven successive County Championship wins. He also did well in 1953, but after that rather fell away, although he kept his place in the side. He had a good season in 1960, but the following year he played in only one match after mid-May and announced his retirement.\nHe died on 27 April 2015.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Surrey County Cricket Club", "response": ["*  David Fletcher"]}, {"page": "Sutton Grammar School", "response": ["*David Fletcher \u2013 Surrey CCC cricketer"]}, {"page": "1947 English cricket season", "response": ["Surrey showed improvements on 1946 but Playfair remarked on \"the need for new blood\". Having said that, the arrival of Jim Laker certainly resolved any problems in spin bowling and his future partner Tony Lock was already making progress at second eleven level. Another good start was made by opening batsman David Fletcher who was awarded his county cap with Laker and Eric Bedser. Six Surrey batsmen topped 1,000 runs in the championship: Eric Bedser, Fletcher, captain Errol Holmes, Tom Barling, John Parker and Stan Squires. Laurie Fishlock had a chequered season having been dogged by serious illness since he went to Australia with England in the winter. Wicketkeeper Arthur McIntyre played well and produced some good batting performances. The main bowlers were Alec Bedser, Jim Laker and the retiring Alf Gover, who took 121 wickets in his final season. Seamer Eddie Watts could make only a few appearances due to injury. Geoffrey Whittaker made eight appearances and two future Surrey mainstays Bernie Constable and Stuart Surridge also played.Playfair, pp. 92\u201394.", "Martin Donnelly dominated the Lord's match with \"a truly magnificent innings\", scoring 162 not out as the Gentlemen made 302 in the first innings, Bill Edrich scoring 79. The Players replied with 334 for eight declared, Cyril Washbrook scoring 101 and David Fletcher 77. The Gentlemen slumped to 25 for five as wickets fell to Cliff Gladwin and Harold Butler but were rescued by Norman Yardley and Ken Cranston, rain ensuring that the result was a draw. The Gentlemen were led by England captain Norman Yardley and selected three Oxford University players \u2014 Donnelly, Tony Pawson and Tony Mallett \u2014 and two from Cambridge University: Guy Willatt and Trevor Bailey. The team included current England players Edrich and Cranston while Billy Griffith kept wicket. Reg Simpson made his first appearance in the fixture but could only score 4 and 0. The Players were captained by Les Ames who played as a batsman, Godfrey Evans keeping wicket. Washbrook opened with Jack Robertson, the other batsmen being Denis Compton, Charlie Barnett and Fletcher.
