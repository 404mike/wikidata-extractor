The song and video highlight racism in American society, with Leaf recreating aspects of Clark's childhood as described by the musician to the director, and Clark's response to the policies of President Donald Trump since he was elected in 2016. The track was inspired by \"This Land Is Your Land\" by Woody Guthrie, with Clark commenting in an interview with American Songwriter: \"It\u2019s one of the first songs we learn, and we sing it together ... It's like the Pledge of Allegiance ... And when you're kids, everybody's together. You don't see differences until you get older, and older people influence you to think about other people a certain way. I just want to get back to singing that song like we were kids again, you know?\" Writer Dan Solomon, in Texas Monthly, described \"This Land\" as \"perhaps the first truly great song of Clark's career, a defiant, statement-piece anthem that fits alongside pieces like Childish Gambino's \"This is America\" and Beyonc\u00e9's \"Formation\" in its vocal addressing of racism in America.\""]}, {"page": "62nd Annual Grammy Awards", "response": ["**Savanah Leaf, video director; Jason Cole, Danielle Hinde, Alicia Martinez & Devin Sarno, video producers, video producers"]}, {"page": "Priestess (rapper)", "response": ["She was the subject of a documentary, The 4th Wave (in reference to fourth-wave feminism), directed by Savanah Leaf that premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2019."]}]}}
