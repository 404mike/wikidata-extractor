The new Tory government was led by Lord Salisbury. However, as a minority administration it was not expected to last, and a swift return of the former administration was anticipated. During this period serious (if unproven) charges of plotting and ruthless ambition were about to be levelled against Lady Rosebery. Sir Charles Dilke, considered as a likely replacement for Gladstone,Sir Charles Dilke. and thus a rival to Rosebery in government, was implicated in one of the most scandalous and ruinous divorce cases of the era. Involvement in any divorce was social suicide in the 19th century, but the facts which emerged were enough to ensure it was political suicide as well. A friend of the Roseberys, Donald Crawford, MP, sued his wife Virginia for divorce naming Dilke as co-respondent. There was little evidence and Dilke denied the charge, which could have been ultimately forgotten, if Virginia had not suddenly decided to sign a confession giving such lurid details that a great scandal was unavoidable. She claimed that not only had Dilke slept with her and taught her \"French vices\", but also slept with her mother and partaken in a three-in-a-bed orgy with Virginia and a maid.McKinstry, p. 149. Dilke denied everything, but his hopes of high political office were ruined forever. Dilke claimed the whole thing was an embroidery of lies and conspiracies by his political enemies. Rumours began to circulate that the Roseberys, and Lady Rosebery in particular, were at the bottom of Dilke's misfortune.These came in the form of whispers and anonymous letters. McKinstry, p. 150. In his futile quest to exonerate himself, and grasping at rumour, Dilke wrote to Rosebery accusing Lady Rosebery of having paid Virginia to make the confession. An outraged Rosebery denied all on his wife's behalf,McKinstry, p. 151. while in December 1885 Lady Rosebery's only response on being told of Virginia Crawford's confessions was: \"Dilke's behaviour is very astonishing in some reports, though it is not an actual surprise to me.\"McKinstry, p. 149. Quote attributed to Lady Rosebery writing to Hamilton on 16 December 1885. Early the following year Gladstone was returned to power and Rosebery was appointed Foreign Secretary in Gladstone's third but brief term of office. Dilke's political career was ruined, and for years afterwards he continued to expound the Rosebery conspiracy theory. Nothing was ever proven against Lady Rosebery and no tangible evidence exists to substantiate the claim."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1885 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Donald Crawford "]}, {"page": "North East Lanarkshire (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Donald Crawford"]}, {"page": "2006 Washington State Senate election", "response": ["Dale Brandland was challenged by Georgia Gardner (D), Peter Tassoni (G) and Donald Crawford (L) in 2002, and received 49.25% of the vote."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1892 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Donald Crawford"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1886 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Donald Crawford"]}, {"page": "Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame", "response": ["* 1987: Guitar Allen, Donald Crawford, Jesse Dandy, Ted Galloway, Jerry Greene, Tommie Harris, Aldolphus Williams"]}, {"page": "St Cuthbert's Church, Edinburgh", "response": ["* Sir Donald Crawford (1837\u20131919)"]}, {"page": "Women in journalism", "response": ["Virginia Mary Crawford began writing for The Pall Mall Gazette in the 1880s after a much publicised divorce from her husband Donald Crawford.
