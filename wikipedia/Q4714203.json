The Second Division hosts beat their top-flight visitors by a single goal, which was scored by Arnold in the 67th minute after Pompey goalkeeper Jock Gilfillan saved a shot from Matson. Portsmouth's Alec Mackie was involved in two incidents during the game, first committing a foul on Arnold in the first-half which led to the referee introducing a police officer on standby, and later being sent off following an \"unfortunate incident\". In the final at The Dell, the Saints lost 3\u20132 to Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic despite a strike from Drake and an own goal."]}]}}
