He also played more than 100 games for Walsall, scoring 45 league goals, before he was sold on to Leicester City for a \u00a380,000 fee in January 1988. He was sold on to Port Vale for a \u00a3125,000 fee in June 1989, and would play a total of 176 games for the club in league and cup competitions, winning the Football League Trophy in 1993, and helping the club to promotion out of the Third Division in 1993\u201394. After this success he spent two years with Hereford United, before heading into non-league football with Solihull Borough in 1996.

However, he picked up a calf strain and lost his first team place to Nicky Cross, who performed well in Slaven's absence. He was also punched in the face by Peter Swan in a training ground incident, though the pair would eventually make up and become friends. Slaven wanted to return to the North-East to be with his wife Karen and new-born son Dominic, however manager John Rudge was reluctant to lose Slaven despite being unable to promise him a contract for the following season.

For the first time in thirty two years, Vale were in the Second Division. A new club record was set in January 1989, as Rudge purchased classy defender Dean Glover from Middlesbrough for \u00a3200,000. The next month he added Liverpool winger John Jeffers to the squad for \u00a335,000, using the money he received from selling Steve Harper to Preston North End. To boost the side for the oncoming 1989\u201390 season, defender Neil Aspin was purchased from Leeds United for \u00a3150,000, Aspin would play over 300 games for Vale in the next ten years. \u00a3125,000 was splashed out on striker Nicky Cross, who would play around 150 games over the next five years. Vale fans were not used to such purchases, but compared to other teams in the division, the money spent was quite modest. Now on a par with rivals Stoke City, both league games ended as draws, though Stoke were relegated in bottom place."]}, {"page": "Ron Futcher", "response": ["In August 1988, Port Vale manager John Rudge paid \u00a335,000 for his services, having tried unsuccessfully to sign a total of five other strikers.

He played in both legs of the Third Division play-off final victory over Bristol Rovers, setting up Robbie Earle for the first goal of a 2\u20131 aggregate victory. However he was dropped in October 1989, after losing his spot to new signing Nicky Cross in 1989\u201390, and he 'forced the issue' and was sold on to Fourth Division Burnley for \u00a360,000 the following month. He hit 10 goals in 30 games for Frank Casper's \"Clarets\" in 1989\u201390 to become the club's top scorer.

The 1989\u201390 saw many improvements being made to Vale Park, as on the pitch the team did well to establish themselves in the division.
