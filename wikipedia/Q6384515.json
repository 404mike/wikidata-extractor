A forward, he scored 184 goals in 687 league and cup games.\nHe started his professional career at Hartlepool United in February 1978, after failing to win a contract at Chesterfield. He was coached by Billy Horner to become a strong centre-forward, using his natural strength and power to retain possession in attacking positions. Financial difficulties forced the club to sell him on to Leyton Orient for \u00a325,000 in March 1982. After failing to impress in his two years in London, he was moved on to York City for \u00a315,000 in March 1984. He played seven games in the club's Fourth Division title winning season in 1983\u201384, before transferring to Scunthorpe United for \u00a340,000 in March 1986. He did not settle at the club, but in the summer he was fortunate enough to win a \u00a360,000 move up through three tiers to First Division side Coventry City.\nThough never a prolific player for the \"Sky Blues\", he scored a spectacular headed goal in the 1987 FA Cup Final at Wembley, which earned him Match of the Day's Goal of the Season award. He featured in the 1987 FA Charity Shield, but faded from the first team picture at Highfield Road, and in March 1989 he joined Scottish Premier Division side Hibernian for a fee of \u00a3325,000. He returned to England in August 1991 when he was sold to Port Vale for \u00a3100,000. After falling out with manager John Rudge he returned to Hartlepool on a free transfer in June 1993. He was appointed as player-manager in April 1995, but endured a tough time at Victoria Park, and left the club in November 1996. He later coached at the Middlesbrough Academy and entered the property market.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Coventry City F.C.", "response": ["| FA Cup Winners: 1987 FA Cup Final;FA Youth Cup Winners: 1987 FA Youth Cup Final;BBC Goal of the Season:  Keith Houchen"]}, {"page": "Hartlepool United F.C.", "response": ["Once again then, it was a huge relief for the supporters that Horner managed to make considerable improvements the following season. A large part of this was due to the strike partnership of Bob Newton and Keith Houchen; the latter would be the club's leading scorer in each of the following four seasons. There was also relative success in the FA Cup, with Crystal Palace being defeated at the Victoria Ground thanks to two goals from Newton as the club made the Fourth round.", "1978\u201379 saw a finish in 13th place; 19th the following season was still enough to stay clear of the re-election zone, and then 1980\u201381 saw the team produce its best season in over a decade, never being out of the top 10 and looking promotion contenders for a long spell before falling away to finish ninth. Keith Houchen was top scorer with 17 league goals, with Newton also making double figures.", "The next five seasons saw constant struggle and a succession of managers. Gibson finally sold the club to local businessman Harold Hornsey, who at least was able to financially stabilise the club; but with little money available for players times were hard. MacPhail left early in 1994\u201395 and was replaced by Dave McCreery; he was replaced towards the end of the same season by Keith Houchen, who had returned as a player. Houchen was in turn replaced after 18 months by Mick Tait. Meanwhile, the club finished in 18th, 20th (twice) and 17th. There was also a change of ownership in 1997: Hornsey sold the club to an IOR Ltd, with Ken Hodcroft becoming chairman.", "* 1995  Keith Houchen"]}, {"page": "York City F.C.", "response": ["In 1981\u201382, York endured a club-record run of 12 home matches without victory, but only missed out on promotion in 1982\u201383 due to their poor away form in the second half of the season. York won the Fourth Division championship with 101 points in 1983\u201384, becoming the first Football League team to achieve a three-figure points total in a season. In January 1985, York recorded a 1\u20130 home victory over First Division Arsenal in the fourth round of the 1984\u201385 FA Cup, courtesy of an 89th-minute penalty scored by Keith Houchen. They proceeded to draw 1\u20131 at home with European Cup holders Liverpool in February 1985, but lost 7\u20130 in the replay at Anfield; York's record cup defeat. The teams met again in the following season's FA Cup, and after another 1\u20131 home draw, Liverpool won 3\u20131 in the replay after extra time at Anfield.

Smith spent half of this sum (a club record) on Aldershot forward Dale Banton, who went on to score 49 goals in 138 appearances for the club. He also released winger Brian Pollard, but found that the man he signed in his place, Gary Nicholson, was not able to replicate Pollard's form.

City won promotion as the division's runners-up in 1988\u201389, and went on to finish 14th in the First Division in 1989\u201390 under new boss Howard Kendall. Towards the end of the 1990\u201391 season, new manager Peter Reid allowed Beckford to drop down a division to play four games on loan at Don Mackay's Blackburn Rovers. After returning from Ewood Park, he found himself out of the first team picture at Maine Road. John Rudge \u2013 who had sold his brother Darren a few months earlier \u2013 brought Beckford on loan to Port Vale in September as cover for the injured Keith Houchen. He claimed a goal in a 2\u20131 win over Grimsby Town at Blundell Park on 12 October, before leaving Vale Park after five Second Division appearances. He moved on to Birmingham City in the 1991\u201392 season for a \u00a3150,000 fee, but his Blues career was blighted with a serious knee injury for 20 months which kept him out of manager Terry Cooper's first team plans. He scored the \"Blues\" consolation goal on his debut in a 2\u20131 defeat to Stoke City at the Victoria Ground on 4 January, but started just two league games as Birmingham won promotion as runners-up of the Third Division. He started three games at the start of the 1992\u201393 campaign, and claimed a goal at St Andrew's in a 2\u20130 win over Southend United on 1 September. Beckford's only appearances in the 1993\u201394 season came at Gigg Lane in a three-game loan spell with Mike Walsh's Bury after coming back from long term injury at Birmingham. Beckford spent the first half of the 1994\u201395 season at Stoke City, but made just three starts for the \"Potters\". He then joined Mick McCarthy's Millwall, and played nine First Division games in the second half of the 1994\u201395 season. However, he left The Old Den at the end of the season, and arrived at Third Division side Northampton Town for the start of the 1995\u201396 campaign. He made four substitute appearances for Ian Atkins's \"Cobblers\", before announcing his retirement at Sixfields due to injury sustained in his spell at Birmingham City FC."]}, {"page": "Micky Adams", "response": ["After 103 appearances for Third Division Gillingham he moved on to top-flight Coventry City in 1983 for a fee approaching \u00a385,000. He struggled with injury during his time at Highfield Road, and was never popular with the fans. Keith Houchen also recalled that he did not get along with manager John Sillett and was prone to sulking when left out of the team.Strange, Jonathan. A Tenner and Box of Kippers: The Story of Keith Houchen p. 104 (Stadia, 2006, ) Despite this he managed to play over 100 games for City over a four-year period before Leeds United manager Billy Bremner took him to the Second Division for a \u00a3110,000 fee. Near the end of his first season at Leeds he played in the club's FA Cup Semi-final defeat to former club Coventry at Hillsborough, as Coventry won 3\u20132 in extra time. Leeds suffered further heartbreak in 1987 by losing the play-off Final to Charlton Athletic, again after extra time."]}]}}
