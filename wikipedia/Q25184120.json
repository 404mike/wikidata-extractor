He joined the Socialist Party of Great Britain in 1940 and in 1944 became one of the party's accredited speakers. In 1950 he was running speakers' classes. He was one of the most formidable orators of the 1940s and 1950s, when outdoor public speaking was at its peak. He was one of the main voices for the Socialist Party of Great Britain, and could command audiences in Hyde Park of more than 1,000. As central organiser of the party, he arranged meetings, debates, conferences and dances. On behalf of the party in both 1960 when he gave radio interviews and 1970 he visited the companion party World Socialist Party of the United States in Boston. In 1991 he was a member of the two branches dissolved who founded the group Socialist Studies where May was central organiser.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Socialist Studies (1989)", "response": ["The history of the group now known as Socialist Studies dates to 1991, when the Camden and North West London branches were expelled from the SPGB in a party-wide referendum. Some of these ex members, comprising sixteen individuals, refused to recognise the expulsions and attempted to continue operating as the SPGB, which they claimed to have \"reconstituted\".According to a Socialist Studies retrospective article (), the sixteen founder members were J Bell, O Blomley, J D'Arcy, E Hardy, G Howlett, L Lestor, L Frank, A D'Arcy, T D'Arcy, D Davies, M Davies, K Knight, R Lloyd, C May, G Wilson and Harry Young. Among them were Edgar Hardcastle and Cyril May, who became their central organiser. As the original SPGB had never been dissolved and indeed continued to operate following the expulsions, it successfully mounted various legal challenges against Socialist Studies's use of the SPGB name.The Socialist Party of Great Britain v Britannia Building Society (1993, Edmonton County Court case \u2116 ED400825) Because of this and to differentiate itself from the original SPGB, the group has variously referred to itself in its publicity material as the Reconstituted Socialist Party of Great Britain, the New Socialist Party of Great Britain and Socialist Studies. Third parties refer to them as the Socialist Studies group."]}, {"page": "Cyril May", "response": ["Cyril May (born 1929) is an Australian country music singer and songwriter who often performs with Mexican-American singer-songwriter, Jack McDonald.", "Cyril May was born in 1929 and was raised on a farm on Hellhole Creek Road, near Kergunyah, Victoria. He was one of five children. When 15 he would cycle  to and from Albury where he participated in the weekly Air League parade as a cadet. He aspired to be a jockey. May's philosophy of life is reflected in the words and music he has been writing for more than 40 years. As a young man May left Australia to work his way through the South Sea Islands and Canada. He finally settled down in Long Beach, California with his American wife, Dorothy \"Dottie\" Frazier (n\u00e9e Reider, born 1921), who contributes harmony to many of May's songs.", "May's lyrics tell of his personal search for gold, feeling the freedom of hang-gliding, the purr of his motorcycle on the open road and his never ending love of Australia. In the early 1970s May's surfboard washed him onto the beaches of San Blas, Mexico where he met McDonald and introduced him to western style music. The two have since collaborated on several albums, with May performing vocals and guitar, and McDonald contributing various musical arrangements. McDonald, who now lives in Australia, collaborates long-distance with May, and the duo have recorded at least three albums together.Cyril May Music | Travelin' On | Off the Beaten Track ", "May's first album, Off the Beaten Track, features the hit single \"Gold Fever,\" which was used in the 1999 movie remake of Dudley Do-RightDudley Do-Right (1999) - Soundtracks   and played as a lead-in to the American Outdoor Channel television show, \"Gold Fever\".http://www.cyrilmaymusic.com/audio/goldfever.mp3 Cyril May Music | Gold Fever", "* The Great Australian Salute (by Cyril May and Jack McDonald) (1981) Larrikin Records (LRB-088)"]}, {"page": "Socialist Party of Great Britain debates", "response": ["| 1946-10-17 || Tom Colyer || Independent Labour Party || Cyril May || Co-op Hall, Lakedale Road, Plumstead, SE18 ||", "| 1948-02-19 || Sir Waldron Smithers, MP || League of Individualists || Cyril May || Surbiton Assembly Rooms ||", "| 1949-01-20 || G.
