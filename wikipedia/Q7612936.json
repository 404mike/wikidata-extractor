Zzap!64s Steve Jarratt appreciated the \"fast and furious\" action and his colleague Ciaran Brennan said  Barbarian should have been the licensed video game to the fantasy action film Highlander (which had a lot of sword fights and decapitations) instead.  Amiga Computings Brian Chappell enjoyed \"hacking the foe to bits, especially when a well aimed blow decapitates him.\"  Several other reviewers express the same satisfaction in chopping the heads off their foes. Although shocked at the game's violence, Antics reviewer said the \"sword fight game is the best available on the ST.\" According to Jarratt, Barbarian represented \"new heights in bloodsports\". Equally pleasing to the reviewers at Zzap!64 and Amiga User Internationals Tony Horgan was the simplicity of the game; they observed that almost anyone could quickly familiarise themselves with the game mechanics, making the two-player mode a fun and quick pastime."]}, {"page": "Edge (magazine)", "response": ["Edge is a multi-format video game magazine published by Future plc.

Reviewing the game for Amiga Computing, Chris Holmes argued that the game was difficult and that once the player has learned to overcome this, \"the game becomes a touch monotonous as the action does not vary.\" He rated the game at 66%, docking points for the sound in particular. Steve Jarratt of Commodore User complained that in the Amiga version \"the gameplay fails to fulfil [sic] the promise of the graphics\" and gave it a 4 out of 10. The following month, the French gaming magazine G\u00e9n\u00e9ration 4 rated it at 45%, criticizing its similarity to other games in the genre and calling it a \"pale copy of Zaxxon\", although praising its graphics. Conversely, Richard Silsby of Australian Commodore and Amiga Review, in the July 1989 issue, recommended the Amiga version due to its graphics and music.

Likewise, both Robin Hogg and Cameron Pound from The Games Machine commended the visuals, action and gameplay.

Sega Powers Andy Smith and Steve Jarratt regarded it as a decent rendition of the sport, commending the use of multiple perspectives, music, number of leagues, two-player mode and smooth gameplay but criticized said gameplay for being luck-based, as well as the lack of visual variety and crowd noise, recommending HardBall! instead.
