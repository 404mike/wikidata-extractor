She was a close companion of the writer Samuel Johnson, who said he was \"very desolate\" when she died. Cataracts left Williams blind or visually impaired in the 1740s, when Johnson took her under his wing and helped to support her. She joined his household until her death, apart from an interval of six years. In return, Williams supervised Johnson's household management and expenses. Besides poetry, she wrote an unfinished dictionary of philosophical terms and translated and published a French biography of the emperor Julian.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of English-language poets", "response": ["*Anna Williams (1706\u20131783, W/E)"]}, {"page": "Samuel Johnson", "response": ["On 16 March 1756, Johnson was arrested for an outstanding debt of \u00a35 18s. Unable to contact anyone else, he wrote to the writer and publisher Samuel Richardson. Richardson, who had previously lent Johnson money, sent him six guineas to show his good will, and the two became friends. Soon after, Johnson met and befriended the painter Joshua Reynolds, who so impressed Johnson that he declared him \"almost the only man whom I call a friend\". Reynolds' younger sister Frances observed during their time together \"that men, women and children gathered around him [Johnson]\", laughing at his gestures and gesticulations. In addition to Reynolds, Johnson was close to Bennet Langton and Arthur Murphy. Langton was a scholar and an admirer of Johnson who persuaded his way into a meeting with Johnson which led to a long friendship. Johnson met Murphy during the summer of 1754 after Murphy came to Johnson about the accidental republishing of the Rambler No. 190, and the two became friends. Around this time, Anna Williams began boarding with Johnson. She was a minor poet who was poor and becoming blind, two conditions that Johnson attempted to change by providing room for her and paying for a failed cataract surgery. Williams, in turn, became Johnson's housekeeper."]}, {"page": "1766 in literature", "response": ["*Anna Williams \u2013 Miscellanies in Prose and Verse"]}, {"page": "1783 in literature", "response": ["*September 6 \u2013 Anna Williams, Welsh-born poet (born 1706)"]}, {"page": "Elizabeth Montagu", "response": ["By 1770, Montagu's home on Hill Street had become the premier salon in London. Samuel Johnson, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Edmund Burke, David Garrick, and Horace Walpole were all in the circle. For writers, being introduced there meant patronage, and Montagu patronized a number of authors, including Elizabeth Carter, Hannah More, Frances Burney, Anna Barbauld, Sarah Fielding, Hester Chapone, James Beattie, James Woodhouse and Anna Williams. Samuel Johnson's hostess, Hester Thrale, was also an occasional visitor to Hill Street. Among her persistent admirers was the physician Messenger Monsey. Among the Blue Stockings, Elizabeth Montagu was not the dominant personality, but she was the woman of greatest means, and it was her house, purse and power that made the society possible. As a literary critic, she was a fan of Samuel Richardson, both Fieldings (Henry Fielding and Sarah Fielding), and Fanny Burney, and she was pleased to discover that Laurence Sterne was a distant relation through the Botham family. He entrusted her with the disposition of his papers on his departure for France, as he was in ill health and the prospect of his dying abroad was real. She was a supporter of Bishop Percy's Reliques of Ancient English Poetry."]}, {"page": "1766 in poetry", "response": ["* Anna Williams, Miscellanies in Prose and Verse"]}, {"page": "1780s in Wales", "response": ["**6 September - Anna Williams, friend of Dr Johnson, 77?"]}, {"page": "Anna Williams", "response": ["Anna Williams may refer to:", "* Anna Williams (poet) (1706\u20131783), writer and friend of Samuel Johnson", "* Anna Williams (politician) (born 1980), American politician serving in the Oregon House of Representatives", "* Anna Williams, one of the intended victims of serial killer Dennis Rader, \"The BTK Strangler\"", "* Anna Williams (Tekken), fictional character for the Tekken video game series", "* Anna Williams, character in The Actress", "* Anna Williams (footballer), head coach of the Sierra Leone women's national football team"]}, {"page": "Anna Williams (writer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Anna Williams (poet)"]}, {"page": "1760s in Wales", "response": ["**Anna Williams - Miscellanies in Prose and Verse"]}, {"page": "1740s in Wales", "response": ["*Anna Williams - Life of the Emperor Julian (translation from the French)"]}, {"page": "1783 in Wales", "response": ["*6 September - Anna Williams, friend of Dr Johnson, 77?"]}]}}
