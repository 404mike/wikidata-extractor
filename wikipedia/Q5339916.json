His mother, for instance, was sexually attracted to him. White, moreover, spoke of his own attraction to his father: \"I think with my father he was somebody who every eye in the family was focused on and he was a sort of a tyrant and nice-looking, the source of all power, money, happiness, and he was implacable and difficult. He was always spoken of in sexual terms, in the sense he left our mother for a much younger woman who was very sexy but had nothing else going for her. He was a famous womanizer.

So I was really inventing a genre, and it was a way of administering a therapy to myself, I suppose.\"", "White is gay and much of his work draws on his gay experience.
