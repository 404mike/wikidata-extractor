Simon Schaffer writes that his views of the 1830s included disestablishment of the Church of England, a broader political franchise, and inclusion of manufacturers as stakeholders. He twice stood for Parliament as a candidate for the borough of Finsbury. In 1832 he came in third among five candidates, missing out by some 500 votes in the two-member constituency when two other reformist candidates, Thomas Wakley and Christopher Temple, split the vote. In his memoirs Babbage related how this election brought him the friendship of Samuel Rogers: his brother Henry Rogers wished to support Babbage again, but died within days. In 1834 Babbage finished last among four.- Note some confusion as to the dates. In 1832, Babbage, Herschel and Ivory were appointed Knights of the Royal Guelphic Order, however they were not subsequently made knights bachelor to entitle them to the prefix Sir, which often came with appointments to that foreign order (though Herschel was later created a baronet)."]}, {"page": "History of science and technology", "response": ["*Simon Schaffer"]}, {"page": "Joseph Priestley", "response": ["Priestley's work on \"airs\" is not easily classified. As historian of science Simon Schaffer writes, it \"has been seen as a branch of physics, or chemistry, or natural philosophy, or some highly idiosyncratic version of Priestley's own invention\".Schaffer, 152. Furthermore, the volumes were both a scientific and a political enterprise for Priestley, in which he argues that science could destroy \"undue and usurped authority\" and that government has \"reason to tremble even at an air pump or an electrical machine\".Qtd. in Kramnick, 11\u201312; see also Schofield (2004), 121\u201324.", "Considering the extent of Priestley's influence, relatively little scholarship has been devoted to him. In the early 20th century, Priestley was most often described as a conservative and dogmatic scientist who was nevertheless a political and religious reformer.McEvoy (1983), 47. In a historiographic review essay, historian of science Simon Schaffer describes the two dominant portraits of Priestley: the first depicts him as \"a playful innocent\" who stumbled across his discoveries; the second portrays him as innocent as well as \"warped\" for not understanding their implications better. Assessing Priestley's works as a whole has been difficult for scholars because of his wide-ranging interests. His scientific discoveries have usually been divorced from his theological and metaphysical publications to make an analysis of his life and writings easier, but this approach has been challenged recently by scholars such as John McEvoy and Robert Schofield. Although early Priestley scholarship claimed that his theological and metaphysical works were \"distractions\" and \"obstacles\" to his scientific work, scholarship published in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s maintained that Priestley's works constituted a unified theory. However, as Schaffer explains, no convincing synthesis of his work has yet been expounded.Schaffer, 154\u201357. More recently, in 2001, historian of science Dan Eshet has argued that efforts to create a \"synoptic view\" have resulted only in a rationalisation of the contradictions in Priestley's thought, because they have been \"organized around philosophical categories\" and have \"separate[d] the producers of scientific ideas from any social conflict\".Eshet, 131."]}, {"page": "Reproducibility", "response": ["The first to stress the importance of reproducibility in science was the Irish chemist Robert Boyle, in England in the 17th century. Boyle's air pump was designed to generate and study vacuum, which at the time was a very controversial concept. Indeed, distinguished philosophers such as Ren\u00e9 Descartes and Thomas Hobbes denied the very possibility of vacuum existence. Historians of science Steven Shapin and Simon Schaffer, in their 1985 book Leviathan and the Air-Pump, describe the debate between Boyle and Hobbes, ostensibly over the nature of vacuum, as fundamentally an argument about how useful knowledge should be gained. Boyle, a pioneer of the experimental method, maintained that the foundations of knowledge should be constituted by experimentally produced facts, which can be made believable to a scientific community by their reproducibility. By repeating the same experiment over and over again, Boyle argued, the certainty of fact will emerge.", "The air pump, which in the 17th century was a complicated and expensive apparatus to build, also led to one of the first documented disputes over the reproducibility of a particular scientific phenomenon. In the 1660s, the Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens built his own air pump in Amsterdam, the first one outside the direct management of Boyle and his assistant at the time Robert Hooke. Huygens reported an effect he termed \"anomalous suspension\", in which water appeared to levitate in a glass jar inside his air pump (in fact suspended over an air bubble), but Boyle and Hooke could not replicate this phenomenon in their own pumps. As Shapin and Schaffer describe, \u201cit became clear that unless the phenomenon could be produced in England with one of the two pumps available, then no one in England would accept the claims Huygens had made, or his competence in working the pump\u201d. Huygens was finally invited to England in 1663, and under his personal guidance Hooke was able to replicate anomalous suspension of water. Following this Huygens was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society. However, Shapin and Schaffer also note that \u201cthe accomplishment of replication was dependent on contingent acts of judgment. One cannot write down a formula saying when replication was or was not achieved\u201d.Steven Shapin and Simon Schaffer, Leviathan and the Air-Pump, Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey (1985)."]}, {"page": "Literature of Kashmir", "response": ["*Mir Tafazzul Hussain Khan Kashmiri (1727-1800), originally from Kashmir,Hamid Afaq Qureshi, The Mughals, the English & the rulers of Awadh, from 1722 A.D. to 1856 A.D., New Royal Book Co (2003), p.79Amaresh Misra, Lucknow, fire of grace: the story of its revolution, renaissance and the aftermath, HarperCollins Publishers India (1998), p. 57Purnendu Basu, Oudh and the East India Company, 1785-1801, Maxwell Company (1943), p. 22 born in SialkotSimon Schaffer, The Brokered World: Go-Betweens and Global Intelligence, 1770-1820, Science History Publications (2009), p. 53 where his parents moved and himself based in Lucknow where he served as Prime Minister (or diwan) to the Nawab of Oudh Asaf-ud-Daula thanks his erudition.

Hobbes saw the whole approach as a direct contravention of the method of physical inquiry enjoined in the De Corpore. He had reasoned out his own conclusions years before from speculative principles, and he warned them that if they were not content to begin where he had left off, their work would come to naught.
