Sussex also became a major centre for surrealism in the early 20th century.  At West Dean, Edward James was patron to artists including Salvador Dal\u00ed and Ren\u00e9 Magritte while at Farley Farm House near Chiddingly the home of Roland Penrose and Lee Miller was frequented by artists such as Pablo Picasso, Man Ray, Henry Moore, Eileen Agar, Jean Dubuffet, Dorothea Tanning and Max Ernst.  Both collections form one of the most important bodies of Surrealist art in Europe."]}, {"page": "Lee Miller", "response": ["In 1949, the couple bought Farley Farm House in Chiddingly, East Sussex. During the 1950s and 1960s, Farley Farm became a sort of artistic Mecca for visiting artists such as Picasso, Ray, Henry Moore, Eileen Agar, Jean Dubuffet, Dorothea Tanning, and Max Ernst. While Miller continued to do the occasional photo shoot for Vogue, she soon discarded the darkroom for the kitchen, becoming a gourmet cook. According to her housekeeper Patsy, she specialized in \"historical food\" like roast suckling pig as well as treats such as marshmallows in a cola sauce (especially made to annoy English critic Cyril Connolly who told her Americans didn't know how to cook). She also provided photographs for her husband's biographies on Picasso and Antoni T\u00e0pies. However, images from the war, especially the concentration camps, continued to haunt her and she started on what her son later described as a \"downward spiral\". Her depression may have been accelerated by her husband's long affair with the trapeze artist Diane Deriaz."]}, {"page": "Swanage", "response": ["Between 1934 and 1936 Swanage was the home of artist Paul Nash. He worked on the Shell Guide to Dorset and produced a considerable number of paintings and photographs during this period.

With funding from Eileen Agar, Underwood co-founded a graphical quarterly magazine, The Island, in 1931 which, despite contributions from Henry Moore, Agar, CRW Nevinson and Mahatma Gandhi was only published for four issues. In 1934 he published an artistic manifesto, Art for Heaven's Sake: Notes on a Philosophy of Art. Underwood was always convinced that subject matter formed a fundamental role behind the power of both his own and primitive art, and had no belief in subject-less or purely abstract form in his own work.", "In 1938, Underwood closed the Brook Green School. During the School's existence, its students had included Henry Moore, Eileen Agar, Gertrude Hermes, Blair Hughes-Stanton, Raymond Coxon, Edna Ginesi and Roland Vivian Pitchforth. Moore later spoke of his indebtedness to Underwood's teaching."]}, {"page": "Paul Nash (artist)", "response": ["Between 1934 and 1936 Nash lived near Swanage in Dorset, hoping the sea air would ease his asthma whilst he worked on the Shell Guide to Dorset. He produced a considerable number of paintings and photographs during this period, some of which he used in the guide book. The guide was published in 1935 and featured some peculiarities of landscape and architecture that are often overlooked. Nash found Swanage with its diverse flora and fauna, fossils and geology to have certain Surrealist qualities. In a 1936 essay, entitled Swanage or Seaside Surrealism, he wrote that the place had something \"of a dream image where things are so often incongruous and slightly frightening in their relation to time or place.\" Whilst there Nash met the artist Eileen Agar. The two began a relationship, which lasted some years, and also collaborated on a number of works together. In Swanage, Nash produced some notable surrealist works such as Events on the Downs, a picture of a giant tennis ball and a tree trunk seemingly embarking on a journey together and, later, Landscape from a Dream, a cliff-top scene with a hawk and mirror. For a collage of black and white photographs entitled Swanage, Nash depicts objects found in, or connected to, locations around Dorset within a surrealist landscape. On Romany Marsh Nash found his first surrealist object, or Objet trouv\u00e9. This piece of wood retrieved from a stream was likened by Nash to a fine Henry Moore sculpture and was shown at the first International Surrealist Exhibition in 1936 under the title Marsh Personage."]}]}}
