In the first round of the cup they were drawn against Third Division North leaders Darlington. The first tie at Cardiff's ground, Ninian Park, ended in a goalless draw with the poor state of the pitch being blamed for a lack of excitement in the game. A replay at Darlington's Feethams ground drew a record crowd of more than 18,000 people for the club but again ended goalless. A third match was arranged at a neutral venue, Anfield in Liverpool, where Cardiff finally overcame their lower ranked opponents in front of more than 22,000 spectators. Second-half goals from Len Davies and Willie Davies secured a 2\u20130 win and set up a home tie against Fulham. Cardiff's second round match was played in a heavy downpour that caused play to be suspended for ten minutes. A Len Davies goal late in the first half was enough to give Cardiff a 1\u20130 win.", "Cardiff hosted Leicester City in the fourth round where after a goalless first half Harry Beadles gave Cardiff the lead, only for Johnny Duncan to level the score. In the final minute, Willie Davies scored directly from a corner to send Cardiff through with a 2\u20131 win. This was the first season in English football that a new law allowed players to score direct from a corner kick. Davies was mobbed by supporters following the goal, but there remained confusion among other members of the crowd and Davies, along with teammate Jimmy Blair, was forced to return to the field from the dressing room after the match to confirm to the crowd that Cardiff had won the tie.", "The semi-final saw Cardiff return to Meadow Lane as a neutral venue for their match with five-time winners Blackburn Rovers, who were appearing in their twelfth semi-final. A close match had been predicted as both sides were similarly placed in the First Division table at the time, but early goals from Nicholson, Gill and Willie Davies gave Cardiff a 3\u20130 lead at half-time. John McKay replied for Blackburn with a headed goal after the break but the game finished 3\u20131 to Cardiff. By winning the match, Cardiff became the first Welsh team to reach an FA Cup final.", "The match kicked-off at 3pm and started brightly, the first 20 minutes providing the best football of the day according to The Times. Cardiff's Hardy later noted how nervous he and his teammates were at the start of the match, describing the side as \"shaking like kittens\". United's forward pairing of Gillespie and Tunstall proved testing to the Cardiff defence early on and the majority of the opening period was spent in the Welsh side's half. Johnson nearly gave United the lead when he received David Mercer's cross unmarked in the opposition area but he was unable to immediately control the ball, which allowed Blair to close in and block his effort. Cardiff's best chance of the first half fell to Nicholson, who received the ball near the edge of the opposition penalty area. Despite having space to run into, Nicholson chose to shoot early but his effort went well over the bar. Nicholson caused issues for the United defence on the edge of their area that drew a foul from Ernest Milton on Willie Davies, but the resulting effort was wasted. Cardiff had few further opportunities in the first half; the Devon and Exeter Gazette described how Cardiff \"placed the ball too square, so that speed was lost\".", "|FW || Willie Davies"]}, {"page": "1926\u201327 Cardiff City F.C. season", "response": ["Cardiff began the campaign with an away match against Burnley on 28 August. The match was a highscoring affair; Ferguson, Cardiff's top goalscorer the previous year, opened his account with a brace and Len Davies added a third. However, Burnley scored four to take the opening day victory. Cardiff claimed their first point of the season two days later with a goalless draw with Leeds United. The side played their first home fixture on 4 September and worries over attendance figures due to the economic downturn in South Wales proved unfounded as more than 19,000 spectators attended a match against West Bromwich Albion. Some reports noted that fans were walking up to 20 miles to attend fixtures in order to save money on train fares. Len Davies scored his side's goal in a 1\u20131 draw. In the return fixture against Leeds on 6 September, Cardiff recorded their first win of the campaign with a 3\u20131 victory, Potter Smith and Willie Davies scored their first goals of the campaign while Ferguson added a third.", "A 3\u20130 victory over mid-table side Sheffield United on 9 October lifted Cardiff two places, Willie Davies, Irving and Ferguson with the goals. A goalless draw with Huddersfield preceded a three-match winning run that lifted the club to mid-table by the start of November. Cardiff opened with a 3\u20130 victory over Sunderland with a brace from Ferguson and one from Curtis. Bury were beaten 3\u20132 a week later, despite Keenor and Willie Davies missing the game on international duty. Another brace from Ferguson and McLachlan's first goal of the season secured victory. A 1\u20130 win over Birmingham on 6 November secured Cardiff's fourth win in five matches but the game was watched by a crowd of just over 10,000, the lowest home crowd of the year as early season optimism faded. Cardiff's winning run was brought to an end by a 4\u20131 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur on 13 November, the first time they had lost at White Hart Lane.", "The return fixture against West Ham resulted in a 2\u20131 defeat soon after and Cardiff were dealt a further blow as Willie Davies made his final appearance of the season as he was ruled out indefinitely after contracting pleurisy and confined to a sanatorium. Cardiff's next fixture against Sheffield Wednesday was delayed for two days owing to heavy fog in the Yorkshire area. When the two teams did meet, Cardiff were beaten 3\u20130. The side's first win in more than a month, a 1\u20130 victory over fellow strugglers Everton lifted the side above the relegation zone. Concerned about his team's faltering performances, Stewart made several more additions to his squad in December, adding goalkeeper Tommy Hampson from Darlington and forwards Fred Castle and Frank Matson from Mid Rhondda and Reading respectively. Matson made his debut against Blackburn Rovers on 18 December and Castle against Newcastle a week later, but neither were able to stop the side falling to 1\u20130 and 5\u20130 defeats. Cardiff ended the calendar year with a 2\u20130 win over Arsenal following goals from Ferguson and Curtis. The match attracted the largest home crowd for a league fixture of the season with more than 25,000 in attendance.", "Keenor was restored to the side for the club's first match in February and helped secure a 1\u20130 victory over Bolton, with Len Davies scoring Cardiff's winning goal. A 1\u20131 draw with Manchester United was followed by a 2\u20131 defeat of West Brom. A 3\u20131 defeat away to Sheffield United briefly derailed Cardiff's improved form but the side continued to see a marked improvement in results. They were aided by the arrival of forward Billy Thirlaway from Birmingham, a signing which allowed Stewart to move Ferguson to his natural centre-forward position, having been used to cover there since Willie Davies had been ruled out. Thirlaway made his debut on 12 March in a 2\u20132 draw with Sunderland, with Irving scoring both of Cardiff's goals. Ferguson rediscovered his goalscoring form after being switched and added a brace in a 2\u20130 win over Derby the following week in front of 10,057 spectators, the lowest league crowd of the season at Ninian Park. He added another in a 2\u20131 victory over Bury on 19 March, McLachlan scoring the other, and scored another brace in a 2\u20130 defeat of Huddersfield. These results meant Cardiff had lost only once since mid-January, winning five and drawing the remaining four of their previous ten fixtures, and had elevated the side to 12th place by the end of March."]}, {"page": "Wales national football team results (1920\u20131939)", "response": ["|1923\u201324 British Home Championship|| Willie Davies, Len Davies || 26,000", "|1923\u201324 British Home Championship|| Willie Davies, Ted Vizard || 30,000", "|1927\u201328 British Home Championship|| Wilf Lewis, Willie Davies || 27,563", "|1928\u201329 British Home Championship|| Willie Davies (2) || 50,421"]}, {"page": "Bert Gray", "response": ["Gray made his international debut for Wales in the 1924 British Home Championship match against Scotland on 16 February 1924.

In the semi-finals, Cardiff defeated Blackburn Rovers 3\u20131 to set up a final against Sheffield United. After a dour final played out in front of 91,763 fans, the game was decided by England international Fred Tunstall who capitalised on a mistake by Harry Wake to score the only goal in a 1\u20130 victory for Sheffield United.

Manager Fred Stewart, who was entering his tenth competitive season in charge, made several changes to his playing squad with ten players being signed. Harry Beadles had arrived at the club from Liverpool immediately following the end of the previous season and had been part of the club's overseas tour. He had previously had a trial at the club after the First World War which had proved unsuccessful. Several players from local teams were also brought in, including forwards Jack Nicholls, son of Cardiff director Sydney Nicholls who was signed from Newport County, and Willie Davies, signed from Swansea Town for \u00a32,500. The club also signed Joe Nicholson from Clapton Orient and Tom Sloan from Linfield, as well as James McLean from amateur side Barn Athletic, a player who was regarded as deaf and dumb although he never played for the first team.", "Cardiff entered the FA Cup in the first round and were drawn against Third Division North side Darlington. Despite being considered heavy favourites, Cardiff could only manage a goalless draw in a result that was regarded as one of the surprise results of the round, with the home side being jeered off the pitch by their own supporters. The result was partly blamed on the substandard condition of the pitch at Cardiff's Ninian Park ground, with the surface being noted for its \"deadness that made accurate passing impossible\". The two teams met in a replay four days later where the pitch at Darlington's home ground, Feethams, also drew criticism with Cardiff players being quoted as saying the pitch was \"worse than Ninian Park had ever been\". The teams played out a second goalless draw necessitating a second replay, held at Anfield in Liverpool. Their lower ranked opponents created several scoring opportunities in the opening stages of the match but were unable to convert any, hitting the crossbar twice. Early in the second half, Cardiff took the lead when Beadles' shot rebounded off the crossbar allowing Len Davies to open the scoring. Willie Davies added a second later in the half as the match finished 2\u20130.", "In the fourth round, Cardiff were drawn against Second Division side Leicester City, the second meeting between the two sides in the FA Cup in three seasons; Cardiff had eliminated Leicester in the second round during the 1922\u201323 season. More than 50,000 spectators attended the fixture and Leicester enjoyed the better play of the first half but it was Cardiff who took the lead early in the second half when Beadles headed in from Willie Davies' cross. Leicester quickly equalised when Arthur Chandler's shot was parried by Cardiff goalkeeper Tom Farquharson, allowing Johnny Duncan to lift the ball over the stricken keeper and into the net. In the final moments of the game, Leicester defender Adam Black cleared the ball out for an opposition corner after being pressured in possession. Willie Davies took the corner for Cardiff, sending the ball into the box where it looped over the head of the opposition goalkeeper and into the net. The Times match report described the goal, writing \"As it came across it seemed to hang in the wind and then took a quick swerve, curling into the farther corner of the net.\" The referee immediately blew his whistle for both the goal and the end of the match. As the rule stopping a player to score directly from a corner kick had only been lifted the previous year, there was initially confusion in the ground as to whether the goal stood before some Cardiff fans invaded the pitch and engulfed Willie Davies in celebration. He later recalled his goal and the moments after, remarking \"I took it in a hurry with my right foot. The swerve on the ball beat everybody and it went straight into the net! I had forgotten, in the excitement, that a goal could now be scored direct from the corner-flag, but the next minute I was being mobbed by thousands of spectators.\" Despite some celebrations, there were still large parts of the crowd who were unsure whether the goal stood and the overall outcome of the match.

Although losing 2\u20131 to Scotland in the opening game, a goalless draw with England and a 2\u20131 victory over Ireland did secure the side the runners-up spot. With club sides in Wales attracting record crowds, the national team often found itself losing out to the domestic game in terms of spectators. The victory over Ireland came on the same day Cardiff City hosted South Shields in the Football League Second Division; only 11,000 attended the national side's match in Swansea while more than 30,000 attended Cardiff's fixture. Disappointing results between 1922 and 1923 prompted a revamp of the team for the 1923\u201324 British Home Championship. One of the debutants in the team was Swansea Town's Willie Davies who scored in a 2\u20130 victory over Scotland in the opening game. Davies added a further goal again in Wales' second match, a 2\u20131 victory over England with Ted Vizard scoring the winning goal. A final win over Ireland, via a Moses Russell penalty, secured the title for Wales having beaten all three sides in the same tournament for the first time. The success was partly attributed to the team's star players being released to play, but the change was short-lived. Six players withdrew from the squad for the opening match of the 1924\u201325 tournament, a 3\u20131 defeat to Scotland. Wales' success did prompt England to agree to a Saturday fixture in Wales for the first time; Fred Keenor scored for Wales but the side fell to a 2\u20131 defeat.

Cardiff took the lead through Willie Davies before Clem Stephenson equalised. Nelson had the opportunity to win the match for Cardiff but failed to convert a penalty in the second half. In their next match, Cardiff defeated in-form Tottenham Hotspur, inflicting their opponents' first defeat of the season with goals from Davies and Denis Lawson. However, the team soon entered a poor run of form, losing the return fixture against Tottenham 1\u20130 before being defeated by the same scoreline against league leaders Sunderland. This was followed by a heavy 6\u20133 defeat against Blackburn Rovers. The club enjoyed a brief respite by defeating Bury 3\u20132 with goals from Joe Nicholson, Len Davies and Beadles, although The Times noted it was \"strange to find a team so good as Cardiff City so near the bottom of the table.\" Three straight defeats followed. The run began with a defeat against Birmingham in which Stewart experimented with team selection, including defender Fred Keenor at centre-forward. Cardiff took a 2\u20130 lead with goals from Willie Davies and Keenor but Birmingham recovered to take the victory, winning 3\u20132. A 5\u20130 defeat against Arsenal and a 2\u20130 loss against Manchester United left Cardiff bottom of the table at the end of October.", "The Football Echo described how the Cardiff side had struggled to adapt to the new offside law change, writing \"there are players who forget what is required of them under the new conditions, and adhere to the old methods.\" The team's struggles prompted wholesale changes from Stewart. Blair, Keenor and Willie Davies were absent due to international call-ups and Harry Wake was dropped from the defensive side of the line-up and the changes proved significant as they defeated Aston Villa 2\u20130. Stewart continued making changes and the club accepted an offer of \u00a33,200 for Gill from Blackpool, the striker leaving after five years with Cardiff. The money was given to Stewart to reinvest in the squad and the directors provided further transfer funds as the manager reshaped the club's attack. Joe Cassidy was signed from Bolton Wanderers for \u00a33,800 and George McLachlan from Clyde for \u00a32,000. The most significant signing was the arrival of Hughie Ferguson from Motherwell for a club record fee of \u00a35,000. The arrival of Ferguson was seen as a coup, with the Football Echo writing that the signing \"was regarded as a triumph for Mr Fred Stewart ... for prevailing upon the Scottish officials to part with their star player\". The new arrivals prompted a reshaping of the squad, with Beadles, Lawson and Jack Evans being largely omitted for the remainder of the season.", "All three new signings started the Cardiff's next match against Leicester City and the trio combined to earn the club's first points at home for a month. Willie Davies and Ferguson opened the scoring for Cardiff before Cassidy completed a hat-trick in a 5\u20132 victory. A 1\u20130 defeat to Leeds United followed, but a goalless draw with Newcastle United on 21 November was enough to lift the side above the relegation zone. A 1\u20130 victory over Bolton Wanderers began a much improved run of form for Cardiff who went on to win three of their five matches in December, led largely by the goals of Ferguson and Len Davies. A brace from Ferguson secured a 2\u20131 victory over Notts County before Ferguson and Len Davies scored one each to beat Liverpool a week later. The pair each scored again in a 3\u20132 defeat to bottom-placed Burnley, before Cardiff recovered to beat West Bromwich Albion 3\u20132. Len Davies opened the scoring, his third in three games, before another brace from Ferguson secured his seventh goal in five matches. His scoring run was brought to an end in the reverse fixture against West Brom, who won 3\u20130 on 26 December. Despite the defeat, Cardiff ended the calendar year in 16th place.", "During the season, manager Fred Stewart used 28 players in all competitions. Willie Davies and Hardy made the most appearances, each playing in 39 matches, while Len Davies and Nelson made one less appearance with 38. Two players, Alfie Hagan and Harry McCracken, made only a single appearance for the club. McCracken's appearance in the Welsh Cup was his only game for the side. Despite signing for Cardiff midway through the season, Ferguson was the club's top goalscorer, netting 21 times in all competitions. Author James Leighton notes that without Ferguson's goals \"Cardiff would probably have been relegated\". No other player reached double figures for goals during the campaign, Willie and Len Davies were both tied for second with nine goals each. In total, 13 players scored at least once during the campaign for Cardiff. The squad for the season contained 16 players with at least one cap at international level, a club record, while Tom Watson also won his first cap at the end of the campaign."]}, {"page": "1927\u201328 Cardiff City F.C. season", "response": ["Despite his goalscoring efforts, Smith was replaced by the returning Curtis for a 2\u20130 defeat to West Ham United before Curtis himself was replaced by Willie Davies.

He scored his side's third goal to give them a 3\u20130 lead in front of a home league fixture low crowd of 6,606, but Derby rallied and the match ended tied. Crowd numbers had initially remained high at the start of the season as the team's FA Cup success peaked interest, but numbers dropped as the campaign progressed with the economic downturn in the South Wales region affecting the club's supporters. The Football Express noted that \"enthusiasts who, in previous seasons were regular visitors, but who now, on the score of the economy ... content themselves with a visit to selected games.\" Another high-scoring game followed, as Cardiff ended November with a 4\u20133 win over Sheffield United.", "On 3 December, Cardiff met Aston Villa at Ninian Park. Ferguson gave his side the lead after three minutes and, although Villa equalised soon after, he added a second midway through the first half to give Cardiff a 2\u20131 victory to move into third place. They moved up to second by defeating Sunderland 2\u20130 a week later despite spending a period effectively reduced to 10-men due to an injury to Keenor. However, this proved to be the pinnacle of their league season as a three-game losing streak through mid-December began with a 1\u20130 defeat to mid-table Bury at Ninian Park, their first home defeat of the season. The match also proved to be the final game for Willie Davies who was sold to Notts County in order to raise funds as low attendance figures continued to impact the club's finances. The three-game losing streak concluded with a 2\u20131 losses to Burnley on 24 December and league leaders Everton two days later. The latter match was played in driving snow as Everton dominated the tie with Dixie Dean scoring both of the opposition goals. Harry Wake scored for Cardiff in only his second appearance of the season and he followed this up by scoring against Everton again in the reverse fixture the following day to help his side to a 2\u20130 victory.
