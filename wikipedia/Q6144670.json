He brought instant success as Hampshire won promotion as champions to the County Championship First Division with victory over Glamorgan on 23 September 2014. The 2015 season was reasonable successful with Hampshire qualifying for a record 6th successive Twenty20 Finals Day, however their First class performances at the beginning of the season were poor leading to Adams' resignation as captain. James Vince took over as captain, having already become List A and T20 captain previously, and led a revival as Hampshire won four of their last five games, meaning that Hampshire completed the 'Great Escape' as victory over Nottinghamshire in their final games thanks to 10 wickets from West Indian Fidel Edwards, and Yorkshire's victory over Sussex meant that Sussex and Worcestershire were relegated to Division Two with Hampshire staying up.", "2019 again saw strong performance in first-class cricket as Hampshire finished 3rd in the County Championship, their highest finish in over 10 years. Kyle Abbott once again was leading wicket taker, while also taking the best Hampshire bowling figures in a match when he took 17/86 against Somerset in September. Ajinkya Rahane also became the first Indian player to represent Hampshire during an overseas spell in June. Hampshire once again also made the 2019 Royal London One-Day Cup final, however this year they were defeated in the final by Somerset. There was though success for Hampshire academy graduates James Vince and Liam Dawson as they were part of England's victorious World Cup winning side. Hampshire, though, again failed to progress from the group in T20 cricket. The following 2020 season was heavily disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic with only a shortened localised red ball tournament and T20 played. Hampshire, missing a large number of players to injury, international selection and travel restrictions, struggled winning just two red ball and two white ball games. A large number of young academy players though made their debuts while James Fuller took a hat-trick in a first-class game against Surrey, while overseas player Shaheen Afridi took four wickets in four balls in the final T20 match of the season against Middlesex. West Indian fast bowler Fidel Edwards announced his departure during the season due to not being able to travel due to the restrictions around COVID-19 and the impending change to the Kolpak ruling, after taking over 200 wickets in all formats. 2021 saw a return to the traditional County Championship, although in a differing format, with Hampshire missing out on their first County Championship title since 1973 following a loss to Lancashire in the final match of the season. In Twenty20 cricket, Hampshire made Finals Day following a dramatic 2 run win over Nottinghamshire in the Quarter Final, but lost to Somerset in the semi-finals. Hampshire's List A side was depleted due to The Hundred competition being played alongside the One Day Cup competition. With Hampshire missing 7 players to The Hundred, they missed out on the playoffs, although a number of young players were given the opportunity to play. Individually, Keith Barker won Hampshire's Players Player of the Year, while fellow bowler, overseas international Mohammad Abbas picked up a hat-trick in the County Championship against Middlesex.", "|style=\"text-align:center\"|14|| James Vince*\u00a0 ||  ||  || Right-handed || Right-arm medium ||Club Captain"]}, {"page": "Chris Benham", "response": ["Come the 2010 County Championship, Benham started the season in the first-class starting XI, but throughout the season he failed to hold down a regular place in the team, due in part to the emergence of batsman James Vince.

The decision to move Moeen Ali up the order did work out, and England's spinners didn't offer a genuine threat throughout the series. Despite the setback, England continued their progression under Bayliss in limited overs cricket. Despite losing the opening match of the ODI series, they recovered to win it 3\u20131, winning the last three games by a margin of 95 runs, 6 wickets and 84 runs respectively.

With the T20 World Cup approaching, England experimented in their selections for the three T20 internationals.

England won the fourth game by six wickets, with Jason Roy scoring yet another century, before England won the final game of the series after a strong bowling performance, which included four wickets for David Willey, meaning they won the series 3\u20130. The only T20I between the two sides saw Bayliss hand England debuts to Liam Dawson and Tymal Mills. Dawson was particularly impressive, tasking figures of 3\u201327, before an unbeaten 73 from Jos Buttler saw England record an eight wicket victory, and meant they had not lost in their nine matches against Bayliss' former side."]}, {"page": "Al-Amin Hossain", "response": ["In 2012, he was selected to Bangladesh \"A\" squad to play against England Lions.
