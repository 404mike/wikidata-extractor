His musical career started when he played guitar in the Scottish band Josef K.  They released a string of singles and an album, The Only Fun in Town, on Postcard Records in the early 1980s.\nAfter the demise of Josef K, Ross joined Edwyn Collins in the group Orange Juice, playing and writing songs for both the Rip it Up and Texas Fever albums. After Orange Juice, Ross joined Roddy Frame in Aztec Camera as the second guitarist, and recorded and toured the Mark Knopfler produced Knife album. Next, Ross embarked on other projects such as the High Bees with his wife, Syuzen Buckley, and Dave Ruffy (formerly with The Ruts).\nIn the mid-1980s and throughout the 1990s, Ross worked with many artists such as former Josef K bandmate Paul Haig, Momus, Edwyn Collins, Dave Graney and The Coral Snakes, Blancmange and Barry Adamson (ex-Magazine and The Bad Seeds). He was also hired as musical consultant on The Beatles biographical film Backbeat (1993), and contributed to the original musical score of the film Chocolat (2000), playing guitar alongside Johnny Depp.\nRoss appeared on ex-Fire Engine Davy Henderson's band The Nectarine No. 9's last album: I Love Total Destruction (2004) and is currently working with another ex-Fire Engine, [[Russell Burn] in their new band: Stac Lee. Ross continues to play with wife Syuzen in the group: Buckley's Chance mostly around Edinburgh, Scotland. He has also worked in various one-off projects including The Lonely Crowd with Bassist Billy Buckley, (his brother-in-law) Drummer Chris McArthur and New York songwriter Spike Priggen.\nRoss' solo career includes two solo albums on the German label Marina Records: Low Shot (1995) and: Happy Boy (1998). A compilation of Ross' work was released on Re-Action Recordings in 2006 and he recently was performing as a member of Barry Adamson's live band. Future collaborations for Ross with: Hulk Hogan and Lenny Henry are eminent.\nRoss appeared prominently in the 2015 history of Scotland's post-punk scene: Big Gold Dream.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Orange Juice (band)", "response": ["Edwyn Collins pursued a successful solo career following the band's split, whilst other members James Kirk, David McClymont, Malcolm Ross and Zeke Manyika have had lower-profile solo releases. The original line-up of the band reunited once in 2008 to be honoured for their influence on Scottish music, but the band has never reformed.", "Shortly after Duncan's departure, one of Collins' colleagues in the Glasgow Parks Department, David McClymont, joined the band on bass, and the band was rechristened as Orange Juice. Collins, Kirk, McLymont and Daly's first gig as Orange Juice occurred in April 1979 in the Glasgow School of Art refectory. At another early gig at Teviot Row House at the University of Edinburgh was recorded by Malcolm Ross of Josef K, and one track from this (Kirk's \"Felicity\") was pressed as a flexi-disc to be distributed with a planned fanzine to be called Strawberry Swtichblade, a name later adopted for a band formed by friends of Alan Horne, the manager of Postcard Records, which he started with Collins in 1979 primarily as a conduit to release Orange Juice's music. In the event, the fanzine never appeared, though some copies of the flexi were given away the \"Ten Commandments\" fanzine run by Robert Hodgens (of The Bluebells).", "Daly left shortly after the Teviot Row gig, joining local punk act Fun 4, who released the controversial single 'Singing in the Showers' in November 1979 (the lyrics referring to Nazi gas chambers). Daly was replaced in Orange Juice by Chris Gordon on drums, but was persuaded back to record the band's debut single Falling and Laughing for Postcard records after Gordon suffered from stage fright at a number of gigs. The debut single was recorded in December 1979 in Strathaven, with Malcolm Ross co-producing and adding guitar to both the a-side and the playful b-side \"Moscow', the latter recorded as a tentative 'theme tune' for the coming 1980 Moscow Olympics. Fewer than 1,000 copies of Falling and Laughing were pressed, and most included copies of the Felicity flexi: 200 also included a postcard of the band. The wrap-round cover and amateur packaging established Postcard's home-spun aesthetic, with the label's  \"Sound of Young Scotland\" tagline marking it out as something of a reaction to much of the seriousness and angst of post-punk. Released in February 1980, Falling and Laughing was Postcard's signature tune: lyrically and musically, it celebrated the innocence of youth and was very much at odds with much contemporary independent music, combining a disco bass-line purloined from an ELO song with jangly guitars reminiscent of the Velvet Underground.", "Debut album You Can't Hide Your Love Forever was not released until February 1982, and received mixed reviews, with the use of backing singers and synthesizers anathema to some of the band's long-term fans. Retrospectively, however, the album is often cited as a classic of the era  and a key influence on the C86 generation and beyond. By the stage the album was released, the band in any case had a new line-up: in August 1981, Josef K split up, with Collins asking guitarist Malcolm Ross to join the band, making it a five-piece. This caused some ructions, with Daly and Kirk reportedly feeling the band was losing its original sound (Daly in particularly having publicly objected to the first Polydor single L-O-V-E (Love), a cover of the Al Green classic, released in October 1981). Collins was reported in the press as siding with Kirk and Daly before deciding to leave with Malcolm Ross and bass player David McLymont. Collins, Ross and McLymont performed as a three-piece, with stand-in drummers, on a couple of Autumn 1981 gigs before Zeke Manyika made his live debut in January 1982 at the London Venue. As such, the line-up that promoted You Can't Hide Your Love Forever on tour in early 1982 was not the line-up that recorded it: ignoring older material penned by James Kirk (e.g. \"Felicity\", \"Wan Light\", \"You Old Eccentric\", \"Three Cheers for Out Side\") the band often used dates to debut new songs that overtly more pop in style, including a cover of The Staple Singers \"I'll take you there\", future single \"I Can't Help Myself\" (with its telling reference to The Four Tops), and \"In spite of it all\", later renamed and issued as the single \"Two Hearts Together\" in the summer of 1982. The latter single was backed by \"Hokoyo\", a song co-written by Zeke Manyika and featuring lyrics in Shona, showing the band moving away from its original guitar-based sound towards a more varied and eclectic musical palette.", "Edwyn Collins continues to perform Orange Juice songs at his live shows. Though Malcolm Ross was initially part of Collins' live band, and Kirk, Manyika, and McLymont continue to record and perform intermittently, the band has never reformed. To date, the original line-up of the band has reunited publicly just once, in 2008, when they were honoured for their influence on Scottish music by the Nordoff Robbins musical trust."]}, {"page": "Aztec Camera", "response": ["After High Land Hard Rain, Bernie Clarke left the band, and was replaced by Malcolm Ross on second guitar and backing vocals.

Early members included Owens (bass) and Mulholland (drums).

It was their only album release while together, and while it placed well on the UK Independent Chart, it received a poor critical reception.

Torrance joined Boots for Dancing and later (with Weddell) formed The Happy Family with Nick Currie (aka Momus).
