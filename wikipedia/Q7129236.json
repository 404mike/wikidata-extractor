The new exhibition galleries were opened on 14 July 1884 and were a great success.Pilbeam, ibid. pp. 166, 168\u20139. But Randall had bought out his cousin Louisa's half share in the business in 1881, and that plus the building costs resulted in his having too little capital. He formed a limited company in 1888 to attract fresh capital but it had to be dissolved after disagreements between the family shareholders. In February 1889 Tussaud's was sold to a group of businessmen, led by Edwin Josiah Poyser.Pilbeam, ibid. p. 170. The first wax sculpture of a young Winston Churchill was made in 1908; a total of ten have been made since.Pamela Pilbeam Madame Tussaud: And the History of Waxworks. P.199.
