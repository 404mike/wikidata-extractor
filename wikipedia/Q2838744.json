McLeod began his senior career with St Mirren in 1970. He scored four goals in one Scottish League Cup game for St Mirren against Rangers at Ibrox.\nSouthampton then signed McLeod, but he failed to settle in Hampshire and he returned to Scotland with Hibernian. MacLeod, who was a relatively prolific goalscorer in a defensive era, scored for Hibernian in the 1979 Scottish Cup Final second replay against Rangers.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "MacLeod", "response": ["*Ally McLeod (born 1951), Scottish football player"]}, {"page": "Graeme Souness", "response": ["While a Middlesbrough player, Souness received his first international cap for Scotland on 30 October 1974 in a 3\u20130 friendly victory over East Germany at Hampden Park.
