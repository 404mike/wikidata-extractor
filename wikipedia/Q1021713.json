In 1854 he traversed the Northwest Passage by boat and sledge, and was the first to circumnavigate the Americas.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Northwest Passage", "response": ["For centuries, European explorers, beginning with Christopher Columbus in 1492, sought a navigable passage as a possible trade route to Asia, but were blocked by North, Central, and South America, by ice, or by rough waters (e.g. Tierra del Fuego). An ice-bound northern route was discovered in 1850 by the Irish explorer Robert McClure. Scotsman John Rae explored a more southerly area in 1854 through which Norwegian Roald Amundsen found a route, making the first complete passage in 1903\u20131906. Until 2009, the Arctic pack ice prevented regular marine shipping throughout most of the year. Arctic sea ice decline has rendered the waterways more navigable for ice navigation.", "Sir Robert McClure was credited with the discovery of the Northwest Passage in 1851 when he looked across McClure Strait from Banks Island and viewed Melville Island. However, this strait was not navigable to ships at that time. The only usable route linking the entrances of Lancaster Sound and Dolphin and Union Strait was discovered by John Rae in 1854.", "During the search for Franklin, Commander Robert McClure and his crew in  traversed the Northwest Passage from west to east in the years 1850 to 1854, partly by ship and partly by sledge. McClure started out from England in December 1849, sailed the Atlantic Ocean south to Cape Horn and entered the Pacific Ocean. He sailed the Pacific north and passed through the Bering Strait, turning east at that point and reaching Banks Island."]}, {"page": "1807", "response": ["* January 28 \u2013 Robert McClure, Irish-born Arctic explorer (d. 1873)"]}, {"page": "1873", "response": ["* October 17 \u2013 Sir Robert McClure, British Arctic explorer (b. 1807)"]}, {"page": "List of explorers", "response": ["| Robert McClure"]}, {"page": "Victoria Island (Canada)", "response": ["In 1826 John Richardson saw the southwest coast and called it \"Wollaston Land\". In 1839 Peter Warren Dease and Thomas Simpson followed its southeast coast and called it \"Victoria Land\".

In 1850 and 1851 Robert McClure circumnavigated most of Banks Island, thereby separating it from the rest of Victoria Land. His men also charted the northwest and west coasts of Victoria Island."]}, {"page": "John Rae (explorer)", "response": ["He made a final push, the coast swung to the northeast and on 24 May, he could look north across Prince Albert Sound. Unknown to Rae, just 10 days earlier, a sledge party from Robert McClure's expedition had been on the north side of the sound. He turned south, crossed Dolphin and Union Strait safely and on 5 June turned inland. The journey to camp on the Kendall River was the least pleasant part of the journey since he had to travel over melting snow and through meltwater."]}, {"page": "Kensal Green Cemetery", "response": ["*Vice Admiral Sir Robert John Le Mesurier McClure CB (1807\u20131873) discoverer of the Northwest Passage 1850\u201353thumb|Grave of Robert McClure in Kensal Green Cemetery, London"]}]}}
