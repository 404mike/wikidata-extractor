Klein's famous brothers included Charles and Manuel Klein.  His second wife was the writer Kathleen Clarice Louise Cornwell, and one of their children was the writer Denise Robins.\nFor thirteen years, Klein was a vocal teacher at the Guildhall School of Music in London, becoming a lifelong proponent of the methods of Manuel Garcia and helping to edit Garcia's book on the subject.  In 1876 he took up musical journalism, writing for The Sunday Times from 1881\u20131901, among other publications.  He also contributed prolifically to The Musical Times.  From 1901 to 1909, Klein lived and taught singing in New York City, where he wrote for The New York Herald.  He was one of the first critics to take notice of the gramophone and was appointed \"musical adviser\" to Columbia Records in 1906 in New York.  He returned to England in 1909.\nKlein wrote over half a dozen books about music and singers, as well as English translations of operas and art songs.  He was a noted authority on Gilbert and Sullivan.  In 1924 he began writing for The Gramophone and was in charge of operatic reviews, as well as contributing a monthly article on singing, from then until his death.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Phonograph", "response": ["The music critic Herman Klein attended an early demonstration (1881\u20132) of a similar machine.

Recording for that primitive machine was a comparatively simple matter. I had to keep my mouth about six inches away from the horn and remember not to make my voice too loud if I wanted anything approximating to a clear reproduction; that was all. When it was played over to me and I heard my own voice for the first time, one or two friends who were present said that it sounded rather like mine; others declared that they would never have recognised it.

Two recordings from the period, in 1924 and 1931, do not agree on a musical text, which suggests that the changes were not made all at once. David Russell Hulme, editor of the Oxford University Press 2000 scholarly edition of the score, has attributed the cuts and other changes to the music principally to Harry Norris, musical director of the D'Oyly Carte at the time of the Glasgow revival, and the modifications to the opera's orchestration, as well as the new overture, to Geoffrey Toye.  He concluded that some lesser changes may have been made by Malcolm Sargent, but in a few cases Hulme was uncertain as to which conductor was responsible for which change.

He called its quality 'most exquisite', with an amazingly smooth legato, comparable to the great tenor Antonio Giuglini. \"Edward Lloyd's is one of those pure, natural voices that never lose their sweetness, but preserve their charm so long as there are breath and power to sustain them. His method is, to my thinking, irreproachable and his style absolutely inimitable. His versatility was greater than that of Sims Reeves, though he was never a stage tenor; for he was equally at home in music of every period and of every school. In Bach and Handel, in modern oratorio, in the Italian aria, in Lied, romance or ballad, he was equally capable of arousing genuine admiration.\"Klein 1903, 465. His performance of 'Love in her eyes sits playing' (Handel, Acis and Galatea) he called 'absolutely unsurpassable', and greater than any Handelian singing heard thereafter. This extremely high praise came from a most discerning critic. David Bispham considered him the foremost tenor of the concert platform.", "After almost thirty years before the public Edward Lloyd gave his farewell concert at the Royal Albert Hall in December 1900, two months after the Gerontius premiere. Herman Klein said that, like his great predecessor Sims Reeves (who had died in October 1900), although Lloyd was quite unlike him in character of voice and method, both exemplified the purest attributes of the bel canto and upheld the best traditions of the British oratorio school.Klein 1903, 462."]}, {"page": "Marie Brema", "response": ["Herman Klein, describing the London musical scene circa 1900, noted the absence of leading English-born contralto singers, apart from the three notable exceptions of Clara Butt, Marie Brema and Kirkby Lunn.
