Voynich operated one of the largest rare book businesses in the world, but he is best remembered as the eponym of the Voynich manuscript.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Roger Bacon", "response": ["*Wilfrid Voynich"]}, {"page": "1912", "response": ["* Wilfrid Voynich discovers the eponymous manuscript in the Villa Mondragone."]}, {"page": "Voynich manuscript", "response": ["The manuscript currently consists of around 240 pages, but there is evidence that additional pages are missing. Some pages are foldable sheets of varying size. Most of the pages have fantastical illustrations or diagrams, some crudely coloured, with sections of the manuscript showing people, fictitious plants, astrological symbols, etc. The text is written from left to right. The manuscript is named after Wilfrid Voynich, a Polish book dealer who purchased it in 1912. Since 1969, it has been held in Yale University's Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library.", "The codicology, or physical characteristics of the manuscript, has been studied by researchers. The manuscript measures , with hundreds of vellum pages collected into 18 quires. The total number of pages is around 240, but the exact number depends on how the manuscript's unusual foldouts are counted. The quires have been numbered from 1 to 20 in various locations, using numerals consistent with the 1400s, and the top righthand corner of each recto (righthand) page has been numbered from 1 to 116, using numerals of a later date. From the various numbering gaps in the quires and pages, it seems likely that, in the past, the manuscript had at least 272 pages in 20 quires, some of which were already missing when Wilfrid Voynich acquired the manuscript in 1912. There is strong evidence that many of the book's bifolios were reordered at various points in its history, and that the original page order may well have been quite different from what it is today.", "While Wilfrid Voynich took Raphael's claim at face value, the Bacon authorship theory has been largely discredited. However, a piece of evidence supporting Rudolph's ownership is the now almost invisible name or signature, on the first page of the book, of Jacobus Horcicky de Tepenecz, the head of Rudolph's botanical gardens in Prague. Rudolph died still owing money to de Tepenecz, and it is possible that de Tepenecz may have been given the book (or simply taken it) in partial payment of that debt.", " Wilfrid Voynich acquired 30 of these manuscripts, among them the one which now bears his name. He spent the next seven years attempting to interest scholars in deciphering the script, while he worked to determine the origins of the manuscript.", "The timeline of ownership of the Voynich manuscript is given below. The time when it was possibly created is shown in green (early 1400s), based on carbon dating of the vellum. Periods of unknown ownership are indicated in white. The commonly accepted owners of the 17th century are shown in orange; the long period of storage in the Collegio Romano is yellow. The location where Wilfrid Voynich allegedly acquired the manuscript (Frascati) is shown in green (late 1800s); Voynich's ownership is shown in red, and modern owners are highlighted blue.", " Marci said that he was suspending judgment about this claim, but it was taken quite seriously by Wilfrid Voynich, who did his best to confirm it. Voynich contemplated the possibility that the author was Albertus Magnus if not Roger Bacon.", "Many books and articles have been written about the manuscript. Copies of the manuscript pages were made by alchemist Georgius Barschius (the Latinized form of the name of Georg Baresch; cf. the second paragraph under \"History\" above) in 1637 and sent to Athanasius Kircher, and later by Wilfrid Voynich."]}, {"page": "Sidney Reilly", "response": ["In 1895, Reilly encountered author Ethel Lilian Voynich, n\u00e9e Boole. Boole was a well-known figure in the late Victorian literary scene and later married to Polish revolutionary Wilfrid Voynich. She and Reilly had a sexual liaison in Italy together. During their affair, Reilly supposedly \"bared his soul\" to Ethel and revealed to her the peculiar story of his revolutionary past in the Russian Empire. After their affair had concluded, Voynich published in 1897 The Gadfly, a critically acclaimed novel whose central character is allegedly based on Reilly's early life. Alternatively, Reilly modelled himself on the hero of Voynich's novel, Giuseppe Mazzini, although historian Mark Mazower observed \"separating fact from fantasy in the case of Reilly is difficult\". For years, the existence of this purported relationship was doubted by sceptical historians until confirmed by new evidence in 2016. Archived communication between Anne Fremantle\u2014who attempted a biography of Ethel Voynich\u2014and a relative of Ethel's on the Hinton side demonstrates that a liaison did occur. The theme music for the 1983 television mini-series is essentially a piece of The Gadfly Suite (Op. 97a) by Dmitri Shostakovich."]}, {"page": "Jacobus Sinapius", "response": ["Book dealer Wilfrid Voynich saw Jakub's name and title at the bottom of the first page of the Voynich manuscript. Voynich saw the faint writing later revealed as Jacobus Sinapius (Jacobus Ho\u0159\u010dick\u00fd de Tepenec), Voynich subsequently used many chemicals to make it clearer but failed. It was later revealed by ultraviolet light and has been compared with other samples of his signature. Jakub is thus the second person known to have owned the Voynich manuscript after Emperor Rudolf II. Its attested provenance begins with him, since the story that it was owned by Emperor Rudolf II rests on a single piece of unsubstantiated hearsay, related at second hand in a letter to Athanasius Kircher."]}, {"page": "Jan Marek Marci", "response": ["Marci at some time came into possession of the Voynich Manuscript, apparently upon the death of its former owner, the alchemist Georg Baresch. He sent the book to his longtime friend Athanasius Kircher, with a cover letter dated 19 August 1666, or possibly 1665. This cover letter has remained intact and was present when the manuscript was obtained by Wilfrid Voynich."]}, {"page": "Wilfrid M.

In 1919 he began an analysis of the Voynich Manuscript at the request of Wilfrid Voynich.

During the next several years, Newbold developed a complex system to decipher it and his analysis, The Cipher of Roger Bacon, was published two years after his death. Newbold's theory was entirely disproved in a 1931 paper by his friend John Matthews Manly and it is now mostly disregarded."]}, {"page": "Sir Walter Strickland, 9th Baronet", "response": ["He has been linked with the Voynich manuscript.
