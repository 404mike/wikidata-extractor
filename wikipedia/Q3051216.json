Her main areas of interest were 19th- and 20th-century opera (French and Scandinavian in particular) and singers, both historical and present-day. She contributed many reviews and articles to several notable periodicals and newspapers internationally including the Financial Times (which she joined in the early 1970s, working with Andrew Porter and then Ronald Crichton), The Independent, The Musical Times, Opera, Opera Canada and Opera News among several others.\nBorn in Camberley, she was the author of numerous books on various subjects related to opera, including her 1985 work, Mario and Grisi, which details the lives of opera singers Giulia Grisi and Giovanni Matteo Mario. She wrote a significant number of singing translations of many operas, from French, German and Swedish, including works by Gaspare Spontini, Giacomo Meyerbeer and Franz Berwald, and also extensively contributed to reference works on singers and other operatic topics, including several hundred articles in the Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians.\nShe died on 22 October 2014.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Marietta Alboni", "response": ["Her debut at Teatro alla Scala took place in December 1842 as \"Neocle\" in the Italian version of Le si\u00e8ge de Corinthe, which was followed by roles in operas by Marliani, Donizetti (as \"Maffio Orsini\" and \"Leonora\" in the Scala premiere of an Italian version of La favoriteIt was given in 1843 under the title of Elda (William Ashbrook, Favorite, La, in Sadie, II, p. 141).), Salvi and Pacini.
