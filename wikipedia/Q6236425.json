Sarah Barnett & Christine Wilson) Coupling Season 1 DVD (Region 1), BBC Video,  The first series received criticism from some teachers and teaching unions, who criticised the representation of their professions. Letters were printed in specialist publications such as the Education Guardian. The Association of Teachers and Lecturers labelled Chalk as \"perverse\" and \"vapid\", and its leader called upon the show to be axed. Teachers, according to the Daily Record, complained that the show portrayed teachers as \"mentally unstable\", and deterred people from entering the profession. John Grillo, who played Mr Carkdale, recalls that he was appearing in a West End play at the time he was auditioning for the role; a fellow actor in the play was meant to be auditioning for Chalk but, having been a deputy head teacher earlier in his career, was so disgusted by the material that he refused to attend.\"The Staff Meeting\" DVD audio commentary, Chalk Series 1 DVD, ReplayDVD The unions' derision actually inspired The Times's Matthew Bond to like the show. However, despite identifying \"genuine humour\" such as Slatt's rant against French teachers, Bond's review is largely critical. He concedes, \"the teaching organisations, you see, are half right. Slatt has no credible basis in the teaching profession, but far more importantly he has no credible basis in the human race. And what we don't believe in, we rarely find funny.\"", "The complete first series was released on Region 2 PAL DVD by ReplayDVD, the independent label that had released Joking Apart, on 15 December 2008.
