Duguid has since appeared on several albums by Stiltskin's old vocalist Ray Wilson, who for a short time in the late 1990s was lead singer with Genesis.\nIn 2004 he worked on some demo material with Paolo Nutini and appeared as Paolo's keyboard player at 2 events, a live BBC Radio Scotland session and a gig at King Tut's Wah Wah Hut.\nIn 2006 he began writing songs with singer Louise Rutkowski, 7 years later in 2013 had finished an album of work (Diary of a Lost Girl) which was funded by Pledge Music and finally released in 2014.\n2007 saw Duguid producing the double album Duan Nollaig by Fiona Mackenzie. This was released on the Greentrax record label and is believed to be the first such collection of Christmas songs and Carols in the Gaelic language. He also arranged most of the 35 songs and played piano on about half of these. Scots singer Karen Matheson was one of the guest vocalists on the album.\nDuguid has appeared as a keyboard player on many UK touring musicals including We Will Rock You, The Producers, The Full Monty and on The Bodyguard in London.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1969", "response": ["** Irvin Duguid, Scottish rock keyboard player (Stiltskin)"]}, {"page": "Gun (band)", "response": ["The band took a break and returned three years later with yet another new drummer, Stuart Kerr (formerly of Texas), a keyboard player, Irvin Duguid, a revised name (G.U.N. \u2013 the reason given at the time, was to distance the band's name from the Dunblane shooting incident and to show some sensitivity to those involved, as Rankin explained in an interview for the website dotmusic.com) and a new album 0141 632 6326 produced by INXS keyboard player Andrew Farriss. However, the album sold poorly in comparison to Swagger, peaking at No.\u00a032 in the UK Albums Chart. Many fans and even some of the band blame the overproduction of Farriss for the failure of the album . Demos of some of the songs exist such as \"Crazy You\" and \"My Sweet Jane\" that show how the album was intended to sound before Andrew Farriss took over the production helm, showcasing a continuation of sorts of the \"Swagger\" era sound.
