He won his first medal in the 1985\u201386 season, when Celtic won the title on goal difference from Hearts. Although he played only 16 games (with one goal scored), in his third and last season at the club (1986\u201387), he scored 15 goals in his 38 league games.He then moved to English club Aston Villa, helping them win promotion in 1988. He was transferred in 1989 to German giants Bayern Munich, where he stayed for four years. In his first season at Bayern he made 31 appearances and scored 10 goals as he helped them win the 1989\u201390 Bundesliga. During this period he appeared in eight international games for Scotland and was selected for their 1990 FIFA World Cup squad.  After playing for Kilmarnock during the 1993/94 season, McInally retired from playing football. He has since worked in the media, most notably for the Sky Sports show Soccer Saturday. He also commentated on the FIFA 19 video game.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of sports announcers", "response": ["* Alan McInally \u2013 Sky Sports 1998\u2013present"]}, {"page": "Ayr United F.C.", "response": ["From 1948 to 2016, Ayr United used a crest which is a shield containing a Scottish saltire, with a scroll beneath stating the club's name. In 2015, the club became subject to a legal action which claimed that the crest was an unregistered coat of arms. After it had emerged that the club's badge was in jeopardy, a petition was started by fans and gained 700 signatures in 24 hours. The campaign gained support and many political, footballing figures and fans alike lent support to keep the Ayr badge intact. Leader of the Scottish Conservative Party leader Ruth Davidson stated \"If archaic rules are forcing the team to change the badge, then I think we need to look at those rules again. When John Scott brought this issue to my attention, I was happy to take it all the way to the UK Government.\" Another prominent name to join the campaign was former Ayr United and Bayern Munich striker and now a Sky Sports pundit on Soccer Saturday,  Alan McInally, who said \"Badges are so important to football supporters and are treasured by everyone.

Celtic lost the first leg 1\u20133 in Austria, but despite rough-house tactics from the Austrians, it was only Celtic's Alan McInally who found himself red-carded.  The return match at Parkhead was an even more bad-tempered affair as Celtic raced to a 3\u20130 lead in spite of Rapid Vienna's foul play. The match erupted near the end when Tommy Burns was punched by a Rapid Vienna player.  In the ensuing chaos, coins and at least one bottle were thrown onto the pitch by Celtic fans.  None appeared to hit anybody, but one of the Rapid Vienna players was carried off the pitch with his head swathed in bandages. The match finished 3\u20130, with Celtic winning the tie 4\u20133 on aggregate.  However, Rapid Vienna appealed \u2013 citing the alleged injury to their player.  The initial appeal was dismissed by UEFA, but a second appeal from Rapid Vienna was upheld and a replay was ordered to take place at least 150 kilometres (90 miles) from Glasgow.  The Celtic board acquiesced to this decision in spite of considered opinion that Celtic should withdraw from the tournament on principle. As such, the match at Parkhead was declared void and a third match was held in Manchester at Old Trafford. Celtic lost 0\u20131, and two Celtic fans assaulted Rapid Vienna players.  UEFA fined Celtic and ordered their next home European tie to take place behind closed doors.  This was an episode that highlighted both UEFA corruption and the incompetence of a spineless Celtic board.", "When Billy McNeill returned to manage the club in 1987, he oversaw significant change in playing personnel over the summer.
