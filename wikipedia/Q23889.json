He produced the world's first slimline electronic pocket calculator (the Sinclair Executive) in 1972. Sinclair then moved into the production of home computers in 1980 with Sinclair Research Ltd, producing the Sinclair ZX80 (the UK's first mass-market home computer for less than \u00a3100), and in the early 1980s, the ZX81, ZX Spectrum and the Sinclair QL. Sinclair Research is widely recognised for its importance in the early days of the British and European home computer industry, as well as helping to give rise to the British video game industry.Sinclair also had several commercial failures, including the Sinclair Radionics Black Watch wristwatch, the Sinclair Vehicles C5 battery electric vehicle, and the Sinclair Research TV80 flatscreen CRT handheld television set. The failure of the C5 along with a weakened computer market forced Sinclair to sell most of his companies by 1986. Through 2010, Sinclair concentrated on personal transport, including the A-bike, a folding bicycle for commuters which was small enough to fit in a handbag. He also developed the Sinclair X-1, a revised version of the C5 electric vehicle, which never made it to the market.\nSinclair was appointed Knight Bachelor in the 1983 Birthday Honours for his contributions to the personal computer industry in the UK.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "July 30", "response": ["*  1940   \u2013 Clive Sinclair, English businessman, founded Sinclair Radionics and Sinclair Research (d. 2021)"]}, {"page": "Reverse Polish notation", "response": ["In Britain, Clive Sinclair's Sinclair Scientific and Scientific Programmable models used reverse Polish notation."]}, {"page": "September 16", "response": ["*  2021   \u2013 Clive Sinclair, English entrepreneur and inventor (b. 1940)"]}, {"page": "ZX Spectrum", "response": ["The Spectrum was among the first home computers in the United Kingdom aimed at a mainstream audience, similar in significance to the Commodore 64 in the US or the MO5 in France.

Some credit it as the machine which launched the British information technology industry. Licensing deals and clones followed, earning Clive Sinclair a knighthood for services to British industry.", "Later in 2014, the Sinclair ZX Spectrum Vega retro video game console was announced by Retro Computers Ltd and crowdfunded on Indiegogo with the backing of Clive Sinclair. The Vega, released in 2015, took the form of a handheld TV game but the lack of a full keyboard led to criticism from reviewers due to the large number of text adventures supplied with the device. Most reviewers branded the device cheap and uncomfortable to use"]}, {"page": "ZX81", "response": ["The ZX81 could be bought by mail order preassembled or, for a lower price, in kit form. It was the first inexpensive mass-market home computer to be sold by high street stores, led by W. H. Smith and soon many other retailers. The ZX81 marked the point when computing in Britain became an activity for the general public rather than the preserve of businessmen and electronics hobbyists. It produced a huge community of enthusiasts, some of whom founded their own businesses producing software and hardware for the ZX81. Many went on to have roles in the British computer industry. The ZX81's commercial success made Sinclair Research one of Britain's leading computer manufacturers and earned a fortune and an eventual knighthood for the company's founder Sir Clive Sinclair.", "Clive Sinclair's first company Sinclair Radionics, established in 1962, made its name producing a wide range of cheap electronics aimed at the hobbyist market. Its products include amplifiers, radios, multimeters and other items which were generally sold in kit form to hi-fi enthusiasts and other electronics hobbyists. The company entered a new market in 1972 when it launched the first \"slimline\" pocket calculator, the Sinclair Executive. It was a major success that Radionics followed up by launching a wide range of pocket calculators. The company's subsequent expansion made it Europe's biggest calculator manufacturer by 1975.", "Clive Sinclair's relationship with the NEB was fraught due to conflicting notions about which direction the company should go. Radionics had begun a project to develop a home computer but the NEB wanted to concentrate on the instrument side of the business, which was virtually the only area where Radionics was profitable. Sinclair disagreed vehemently with what he characterised as the view \"that there was no future in consumer electronics\". This and other disputes led to Sinclair resigning from Radionics in July 1979.", "While he was struggling with the NEB, Clive Sinclair turned to a \"corporate lifeboat\" in the shape of an existing corporate shell under his exclusive control \u2013 a company called Ablesdeal Ltd, which he had established in 1973 and later renamed Science of Cambridge. It became a vehicle through which he could pursue his own projects, free of the interference of the NEB. Despite his later success in the field, Sinclair saw computers as merely a means to an end. As he told the Sunday Times in April 1985, \"We only got involved in computers in order to fund the rest of the business\", specifically the development of the ultimately unsuccessful TV80 pocket television and C5 electric vehicle. In an interview with Practical Computing, Sinclair explained:", "Sinclair's first home computer was the MK14, which was launched in kit form in June 1978. It was a long way from being a mass-market product. Its very name \u2013 MK standing for \"Microcomputer Kit\" \u2013 was indicative of its origins as a product developed by, and for, hobbyists. It had no screen but instead used an LED segment display (though Science of Cambridge did produce an add-on module allowing it to be hooked up to a UHF TV); it had no case, consisting of an exposed circuit board; it had no built-in storage capabilities and only 256 bytes of memory; and input was via a 20-key hexadecimal keyboard.MK14 advertisement (1978) Despite the limitations of the machine it sold a respectable 10\u201315,000 units; by comparison, the much more expensive Apple II had only sold 9,000 units in the United States, a much bigger market, in 1978. This success convinced Clive Sinclair that there was an untapped market for low-cost computers that could profitably be exploited.", "Sinclair followed up the MK14 by producing the ZX80, at the time the world's smallest and cheapest computer, which was launched in January 1980 costing \u00a399.95 (equivalent to \u00a3319 at 2009 prices.MeasuringWorth.com (retail price index)) The company conducted no market research whatsoever prior to the launch of the ZX80; according to Clive Sinclair, he \"simply had a hunch\" that the general public was sufficiently interested to make such a project feasible and went ahead with ordering 100,000 sets of parts so that he could launch at high volume.", "The launch of the ZX81 was catalysed in part by the British Broadcasting Corporation Computer Literacy Project's plan to produce The Computer Programme TV series, to be broadcast in 1982, aimed at popularising computing and programming. The BBC intended to commission an existing manufacturer to provide it with a BBC-branded home computer to tie in with the series. When Clive Sinclair heard of the project in December 1980, he wrote to the BBC informing them that he would be announcing a new version of the ZX80, to be called the ZX81, in early 1981. It would remedy some of the ZX80's deficiencies and would be both cheaper and more advanced. Sinclair wanted the ZX81 to be a candidate for the BBC contract and lobbied for its adoption. He pointed out that there were already 40,000 users of the ZX80 and that by the time the series was broadcast there were likely to be upwards of 100,000 ZX81 users (which turned out to be an underestimate by over 400,000 \u2013 an indication of how the ZX81's success exceeded even Sinclair's expectations).", "The ZX81's ROM was doubled to 8\u00a0KB, from the ZX80's 4\u00a0KB ROM. This enabled a fuller implementation of a version of ANSI Minimal BASIC (termed Sinclair BASIC by the company). Clive Sinclair re-commissioned a company called Nine Tiles, which had produced the ZX80 ROM, to develop the new ROM software for the ZX81. The code was written by John Grant, the owner of Nine Tiles, and Steve Vickers, who had joined the company in January 1980. Grant concentrated on the software that drove the ZX81's hardware, while Vickers developed the new BASIC and the accompanying manual. Sinclair's brief to the pair was fairly non-specific but primarily concerned remedying a key defect of the ZX80 so that the new machine could be used for practical programming and calculations. Vickers later recalled:", "The reliability of the ZX81 was controversial. W.H. Smith, one of the machine's key distributors, had a company policy of ordering a third more ZX81s than were actually required for sale, so that it would have enough replacements for faulty machines. Similar problems were reported in the US market, where contemporary reports suggested that only a third of the ZX81s shipped actually worked. However, figures released by Sinclair claimed that only 2.4 per cent of pre-assembled machines were returned, although 13 per cent of kits were returned. Clive Sinclair strongly denied any problem with reliability:", "Sinclair attributed the higher failure rate of the kits to customers breaking the components by inserting or soldering them the wrong way, though the company admitted that there was a persistent problem with power supplies that affected both kits and pre-assembled ZX81s. The bigger problem was perhaps Sinclair's lack of after-sales service, which Robin Clarke of New Scientist described as \"one of the worst after-sales performance records of any company ever established.\" The Financial Times observed that \"Clive Sinclair's offices are filled with returned computers which can take months to be repaired.\" The company's slowness in replacing returns and delivering freshly ordered machines meant that Sinclair Research gained a reputation for poor customer service.", "The marketing of the ZX81 was handled by Sinclair's long-standing marketing agency Primary Contact (now part of Ogilvy & Mather), which had provided marketing services for Sinclair since 1971 and was to continue doing so until 1985. Sinclair's entry into the nascent home computing market gave Primary Contact a major challenge \u2013 how to market a product simultaneously at hobbyists and at the \"man on the street\", who probably had little or no computer literacy. The answer was to pursue what the journalist David O'Reilly of MicroScope magazine described as a single-minded \"user-friendly strategy.\" Chris Fawkes, one of Primary Contact's directors, explained: \"We brought personal computers to the mass market by showing that you didn't have to be a whizzkid to use one.\" As Clive Sinclair put it in a 1982 interview with Your Computer,", "According to Ben Rosen, by pricing the ZX81 so low, \"Sinclair has opened up a completely new market among people who had never previously considered owning a computer.\" Clive Sinclair acknowledged the role that guesswork had played in his decision to launch the ZX81 on such a large scale: \"It was a surmise that the man in the street would want such a computer. He does, and our information is that a lot of people are using the machines avidly.\" A New Scientist retrospective published in 1986 commented:", "This approach to advertising was driven by Sinclair's reliance on mail-order marketing. It came with a high up-front cost in terms of purchasing space in publications but it had the advantage of ensuring that all sales were firm and pre-paid. A big splash on launch produced a large influx of cash at the outset of a campaign, though it did also depend on the advertiser having enough product to satisfy the initial surge in demand. The advertisements served an additional purpose of priming the market for over-the-counter sales by \"getting the story across\", as Clive Sinclair put it: \"Not that big a proportion do buy on mail order, but they see the ads, and that helps to prepare them for buying when the item appears in the shops.\"", "The success of the ZX81 led almost immediately to enthusiasts producing a huge variety of peripherals and software. Clive Sinclair was \"amused and gratified\" by the attention the machine received but other than what Clarke described as \"a few remarkably poor programs on cassette\", his company made little effort to exploit the demand, effectively ceding a very lucrative market to third party suppliers, a decision that undoubtedly forfeited a lot of potential earnings. W.H. Smith, for instance, was able to exploit a peculiarity of the ZX81; owners found that technically obsolete low-fidelity mono tape cassette recorders worked better as storage devices than higher-quality music systems. Smith's purchased cheap \"shoebox\" cassette recorders in the Far East and sold them with the W.H. Smiths logo as \"data recorders\". Over 100,000 were sold in 18 months.", "Many non-Sinclair peripherals aimed to remedy the ZX81's flaws and provide many new capabilities. These included RAM packs providing up to 64\u00a0KB of extra memory and promising to \"fit snugly ... giving a firm connection\" to the computer, typewriter-style keyboards, more advanced printers and sound generators, and even a hard disk interface, which Clive Sinclair thought was \"quite overgilding the lily\". A wide range of software was also published. Within only a year of the ZX81's launch, around 200 independent companies had been established to manufacture and sell Sinclair-compatible hardware.Kewney (3 May 1982) The people behind the ZX81 cottage industry were very often not computer professionals but were, as the Financial Times noted, \"school teachers, civil servants, electrical engineers and technicians [who] have set up small operations in their own time\".", "In addition, consumers' attitude in the US was quite different from that in the UK. Clive Sinclair told Informatics magazine in June 1981 that \"our competitors thought that consumers didn't want to learn programming. We [Sinclair Research] think they failed because of this and because of price.\" Timex evidently shared this belief but events proved it to be a false assumption. The TS1000/ZX81's price advantage was erased when its main rivals \u2013 the Texas Instruments TI99/4A and the Commodore VIC 20 \u2013 had their prices cut to below the all-important $100 mark. Competitors such as Apple, Atari, Commodore and Texas Instruments promoted their machines as being for business or entertainment rather than education, highlighting the value of computers with ready-made applications and more advanced features such as graphics, colour and sound.", "The ZX81 had an immediate impact on the fortunes of Sinclair Research and Clive Sinclair himself. The company's profitability rose enormously, from a pretax profit of \u00a3818,000 on a turnover of \u00a34.6 million in 1980\u201381 to \u00a38.55 million on a turnover of \u00a327.17 million in 1981\u201382. Clive Sinclair became one of the UK's highest-profile businessmen and a millionaire, receiving a \u00a31 million bonus on top of a salary of \u00a313,000. He received a knighthood in the Queen's Birthday Honours and the Young Businessman of the Year award in 1983.BBC News (8 August 2003)", "The machine also had a widespread and lasting social impact in the United Kingdom, according to Clive Sinclair, purchasers of the ZX81 came from \"a reasonably broad spectrum\" that ranged from readers of the upmarket Observer and Sunday Times newspapers to the more downmarket but numerous Sun readers. The largest age group was around 30 years old. The Financial Times reported in March 1982 that most Sinclair computers were being bought for educational purposes, both for adults and children, though the children were usually able to learn much more quickly. Ian Adamson and Richard Kennedy note that the popularity of the ZX81 was \"subtly different from the run-of-the-mill social fad\"; although most enthusiasts were in their teens or early twenties, many were older users \u2013 often parents who had become fascinated by the ZX81s that they had bought for their children. However, the ZX81 boom was overwhelmingly male-dominated."]}, {"page": "1940", "response": ["* July 30 \u2013 Clive Sinclair, English inventor (d. 2021)"]}, {"page": "2021", "response": ["** Sir Clive Sinclair, English entrepreneur and inventor (b. 1940)"]}, {"page": "Acorn Computers", "response": ["On 25 July 1961, Clive Sinclair founded Sinclair Radionics to develop and sell electronic devices such as calculators.

In June 1978, SoC launched a microcomputer kit, the Mk 14, that Curry wanted to develop further, but Sinclair could not be persuaded so Curry resigned.
