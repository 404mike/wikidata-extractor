He was born in Oldham and died in Portsmouth. He appeared in 124 first-class matches as a righthanded batsman and wicketkeeper. He scored 636 runs with a highest score of 23 and held 230 catches with 28 stumpings.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Brian Krikken", "response": ["Krikken played a large number of games for Lancashire's Second XI between 1965 and 1968, but the county persisted with Keith Goodwin as first-team keeper and Krikken appeared for them only twice at first-class level, making little impression on either occasion: against Oxford University in 1966 he took three catches and scored 4 and 0, while against Scotland the following year he took two catches but did not bat in either innings."]}, {"page": "Mach One", "response": ["Mach One are a British neo-progressive rock band, founded in 1980 by a group of students attending Burlington Danes High School in West London.  After a series of studio demos, school gigs and lineup changes, the band attracted the attention of Keith Goodwin (notable as publicist for Yes, Rod Argent, Black Sabbath, in the 1970s, and Marillion in the 1980s) who represented them through 1983-85.  During this time Mach One embarked on a series of live shows at pubs and clubs around London, and universities across England, while releasing two albums Six of One and Lost for Words that featured prominently in underground progressive rock fanzines (such as the Genesis Fanzine called Afterglow) and specialist progressive rock catalogues.  However, in the more mainstream press they received mixed reviews for their second album, including a humorous 1-star review by Mary Anne Hobbs in Sounds (a British music paper), although their live show was given a positive write-up in the same paper a few weeks thereafter by journalist Gareth Thompson."]}, {"page": "List of musical supergroups", "response": ["* Keith Goodwin (Days Away)"]}]}}
