His wife was American mathematician Dorothy Maharam.\nStone studied at Trinity College, Cambridge. His first paper dealt with squaring the square, he proved the Erd\u0151s\u2013Stone theorem with Paul Erd\u0151s and is credited with the discovery of the first two flexagons, a trihexaflexagon and a hexahexaflexagon while he was a student at Princeton University in 1939. His Ph.D. thesis, Connectedness and Coherence, was written in 1941 under the direction of Solomon Lefschetz. He served as a referee for The American Mathematical Monthly journal in the 1980s.The Stone metrization theorem has been named after him, and he was a member of a group of mathematicians who published pseudonymously as Blanche Descartes.
