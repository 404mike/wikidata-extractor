Zamora began his career at Football League club Bristol Rovers, but was soon signed by Brighton & Hove Albion, where he found first-team success. Zamora scored 77 goals in three seasons and helped the club achieve two successive promotions.\nFollowing a spell at Tottenham Hotspur, Zamora was signed by West Ham United, where he played for five years and won promotion to the Premier League. Zamora joined Fulham in 2008, where, in his first season, he played regularly but scored only four goals. However, Zamora's form in the 2009\u201310 season gained praise and subsequently saw the player gain a call-up for England. Zamora had an important role in Fulham's successes in the Premier League, FA Cup and UEFA Europa League, before transferring to Queens Park Rangers in January 2012. He returned to play for Brighton in 2015 and retired from football in December 2016.\nZamora also played for the England national under-21 team before gaining his first full cap at senior level almost a decade later.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Fulham F.C.", "response": ["Fulham's Premier League form in the 2011\u201312 season was mixed, with the continuing away-record hangover of previous seasons dragging on.

Pardew set out to rebuild the side bringing in Nigel Reo-Coker, Marlon Harewood and Brian Deane. In his first season in charge, they made the playoff final only to lose to Crystal Palace. His signings of Bobby Zamora, Matthew Etherington and veterans Chris Powell and Teddy Sheringham saw West Ham finishing sixth and subsequently beat Preston North End 1\u20130 thanks to a Zamora goal in the 2005 playoff final, securing a return to the Premier League.

Canio to the tune of Ottawan's \"D.I.S.C.O.\", or the chant of \"Who Let The Potts Out?\" to the tune of Baha Men's \"Who Let the Dogs Out?\" when Steve Potts could be seen warming up to come on as substitute late on in his career, or \"That's Zamora\" to the tune of Dean Martin's 1953 \"That's Amore\" in honour of former striker Bobby Zamora.

Interpretations of 4\u20134\u20131\u20131 can be slightly muddled, as some might say that the extent to which a forward has dropped off and separated himself from the other can be debated.

They faced Hughes' former club Manchester City at the City of Manchester Stadium, who needed a win to secure the Premier League title. Despite scoring twice through Ciss\u00e9 and Jamie Mackie, two late goals from Edin D\u017eeko and Sergio Ag\u00fcero earned City a dramatic victory and championship title.
