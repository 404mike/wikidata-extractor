Saward also rewrote portions of the script pertaining to the story-arc, particularly the final confrontation scenes at the end of Part Four. Peter Moffatt had been originally scheduled as the serial's director, but following the problems with the Space Whale script he was asked to helm its replacement due to his experience, and so Fiona Cumming was asked to take over Enlightenment."]}, {"page": "Entertaining Mr Sloane", "response": ["A television adaptation was broadcast by ITV in the Playhouse series on 15 July 1968, and directed by Peter Moffatt.

The intention was to create a Doctor that was initially unlikeable, but would gradually reveal a kind-hearted soul (glimpsed in Revelation of the Daleks). This was also intended to be a contrast to the instantly likeable Tom Baker and Peter Davison Doctors. However, in later interviews, director Peter Moffatt said that the original idea was merely to have the Doctor in a much more energetic state than he was during the Fifth Doctor's d\u00e9but story Castrovalva. Colin Baker said during a 2003 documentary celebrating the series' 40th anniversary that \"the idea was that over the many, many years I would be playing the part, the outer layers would gradually peel away, revealing the kind-hearted soul.\""]}, {"page": "The Two Doctors", "response": ["The Two Doctors was released on VHS in November 1993.

The DVD contains a full-length commentary provided by director Peter Moffatt and actors Colin Baker, Nicola Bryant, Frazer Hines, and Jacqueline Pearce. The DVD was subsequently incorporated into the box set Bred for War, along with The Time Warrior, The Sontaran Experiment and The Invasion of Time.

Perhaps his most famous role was as TV's Sexton Blake (1968\u201371) on ITV in Britain. It was while filming an episode of Sexton Blake that he lost the sight in his left eye during rehearsal of a sword fighting scene with actor Basil Henson, following a hard sword blow against the side of his head.  Peter Moffatt took him straight away to Moorfields Eye Hospital, and Payne was told that, if he could lie still for a week without moving his head, his retina would join up again so preserving his sight. Instead of doing this, Payne went back to work, got hit in a fist fight, and so lost his sight in that eye."]}, {"page": "Moffat (surname)", "response": ["* Peter Moffatt (1922\u20132007) British television director"]}, {"page": "2007 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 21 October \u2013 Peter Moffatt, television director (born 1922)"]}, {"page": "List of EastEnders crew members", "response": ["*Peter Moffatt (1986)"]}, {"page": "Castellan (Doctor Who)", "response": ["Director Peter Moffatt was able to rehire Paul Jerricho to reprise his Arc of Infinity role of the Castellan in The Five Doctors, but had to recast Borusa, (his new appearance explained by one of the Castellan's lines as a \"new regeneration\"), and replace the character of Chancellor Thalia with Chancellor Flavia."]}, {"page": "Deaths in October 2007", "response": ["*Peter Moffatt, 84, British television director (All Creatures Great and Small, Doctor Who)."]}, {"page": "Funeral Games (play)", "response": ["The Funeral Games script eventually passed to Yorkshire Television, which produced it - along with an adaptation Entertaining Mr Sloane - as contributions to the Playhouse series.
