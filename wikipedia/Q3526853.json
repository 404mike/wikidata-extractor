Born in Kingston, Jamaica, Malcolm played in 40 Test matches for his adopted country, and took part in 30 One Day Internationals.\nAt his best, he was the unquestionably the fastest bowler in world cricket at the time and could devastate the opposition's batting, but his playing style was also notable for his perceived wayward profligacy with the ball, his powerful throwing arm but poor catching as a fielder, and his general lack of ability with the bat, with his batting and fielding being described as of \"court-jester standard\".\n\nHis under-average ability as a batsman seemed however to add to his public popularity, and he was often given a big cheer when he went out to bat, more often than not at number eleven, a position for which he was often in close competition with the equally batting-averse Phil Tufnell.  With a fondness for mighty swings across the line of the ball, he hit some huge sixes for both England and Derbyshire, and became a particular favourite of commentator Brian Johnston.\nAs the cricket writer, Colin Bateman, noted, \"Malcolm, incredibly wholehearted as a bowler and with an easy charm, was a natural underdog with the bat and awkward in the field, and so became a national hero\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "February 22", "response": ["*  1963   \u2013 Devon Malcolm, Jamaican-English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Richard Hadlee", "response": ["His economical action was notable for his close approach to the wicket at the bowler's end (to the point where he occasionally knocked the bails off in his approach), a line which meant he was able to trap many batsmen leg before wicket.

Graham Gooch, although nearly 40, was captain, opening batsman, and in the form of his life: having only the previous year scored 333 against India. His long search for a reliable opening partner seemed to have been ended by the emergence of Michael Atherton, who had made the position his own over the previous year with centuries against New Zealand, India and Australia. In the middle order, Allan Lamb was still highly regarded as a fine player of fast bowling, and his record against the West Indies ensured him a place in the team at the start of the summer: while Robin Smith, the only one of many debutants in the disastrous 1988 series to emerge with credit, was utterly fearless against fast bowling, and already recognised as world-class.  Sadly, internal squabbles - and a belief that, despite having a better average than many of his competitors, he was still definitely aging (although younger than Gooch) - kept David Gower out of the side: but at the younger end of the scale, two highly regarded newcomers were coming through. Graeme Hick, Zimbabwean-born and having gone through a long residency qualification, had not only been breaking records all over the place in county cricket, but had thumped a magnificent 172* off the full West Indian attack for Worcestershire the only time he had faced them in 1988, was now qualified for England, and was rushed into the side: and not far behind his county record, came Mark Ramprakash of Middlesex.  In the one-day matches they would be joined by Neil Fairbrother, regarded as a brilliant specialist in the shorter format but not quite technically sound enough for Tests. Jack Russell, equally eccentric in manners and mannerisms both on and off the pitch, was widely thought of as one of the best wicket-keepers in the world, as well as being a more than handy nuisance with the bat: an alternative wicketkeeper was Alec Stewart, not as fine a keeper but a good enough batsman to be selected for that alone. For bowling, the picture was considerably less clear: especially because Angus Fraser, far and away England's best bowler of the past two years, had broken down injured on the winter tour of Australia, and would miss the series (and indeed the next two years).  Devon Malcolm, as fast a bowler as any of the West Indians but not always reliably accurate - perhaps best compared to Patterson - had mostly cemented a place in the team, although he was being pushed hard for it by the bulky David Lawrence of Gloucestershire - both being regarded as sufficiently risky that there was not room for both in the team.  England, unlike West Indies, would at least consider selecting a specialist spin bowler, and the choice was between two slow left-armers: Phil Tufnell who had bowled well in his debut series but had severe off-pitch disciplinary issues, and moreover was a hopeless batsman and fielder, or Richard Illingworth, who spun the ball less but was more accurate on the pitch and reliable off it, and moreover was a fine enough lower-order batsman to have scored first-class centuries.  The lively fast-medium swing of Phil DeFreitas had made him a first choice pick in English conditions: Chris Lewis was of similar repute, but untried, as a bowler with pretensions to batting, while the military-medium of Derek Pringle had slowed down recently but become more accurate, and Steve Watkin of Glamorgan had been taking wickets by the hatful in county cricket. The trouble was, as usual, deciding which of them deserved a place above the others, all being good but few having made a truly compelling claim to a permanent position. And waiting in the wings was that old warhorse of an all-rounder Ian Botham, now portly, aging and far slower than he had been, out of the team for two years, but still wanting one last crack at the only team he had never really done himself justice against.", "In the early season, up at Headingley in Yorkshire, with plenty of rain and overcast conditions forecast, it was to nobody's surprise that neither side selected a spinner. England gave Test debuts to Hick and Ramprakash: dropping Fairbrother, who had been pigeonholed as an ODI player, made room for the return of Robin Smith who had missed the ODI series. Devon Malcolm returned to the bowling attack, joining Pringle and DeFreitas, and a debut was also handed to Steve Watkin, it being thought that the conditions would suit the tall seam-up Glamorgan bowler (and he was the closest like-for-like replacement for Fraser, for whom this pitch could have been tailor-made had he not been out with his long-term injury.) For Windies, Haynes was fit to return as opener, while Greenidge's injury forced him to return home, Simmons taking over permanently as Haynes's opening partner. The rest of the team largely picked itself, with the only doubt being whether the young and promising Lara would get a chance at the expense of Logie: but the latter had long since established his credentials in English conditions."]}, {"page": "English cricket team in South Africa in 1995\u201396", "response": ["*Devon Malcolm", "*Devon Malcolm"]}]}}
