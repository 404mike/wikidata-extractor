He was born and died in Swansea.\nBancroft's brother, Billy, was a Welsh rugby international and the first paid professional for the Glamorgan cricketing side.

John's final international was at home to France. He successfully converted four penalty goals in a 20\u20136 victory to Wales, and in scoring his final penalty surpassed the Wales international points scoring record of Jack Bancroft set nearly 60 years earlier.

Morgan was an unpopular choice, but Cardiff's Billy Neill had switched to the professional league game and left a position to fill. In a tough game, Wales won 9\u20136 in which Morgan played well. He was selected for the next year's Home Nations Championship, and in a team that contained not only Owen, but also Jack Bancroft and Billy Trew, Wales beat England 8\u20130. In the next year's tournament, Morgan played all three games, including the newly introduced French team, against whom Morgan scored two tries. Morgan would play 13 matches in total for Wales, scoring a total of six tries, and lifting the Triple Crown in 1911. Due to strategic formation changes by the Welsh selectors, Morgan was dropped in 1912 and was sorely missed in the game against England when Wales were beaten fairly easily.Thomas (1979), pg 53."]}, {"page": "Walter Martin (rugby union)", "response": ["Martin made his debut for Wales against Ireland at the Balmoral Showgrounds on 9 March 1912 as part of the Five Nations Championship. In an inexperienced team, Martin was one of seven new caps, under the captaincy of Jack Bancroft, and although leading at half time the team lost 12-5. Despite the loss, Martin was back for the next match, and this time finished on the winning side. Martin did not play for Wales the next season, but was back after the First World War, in a game against the New Zealand Army, which is now recognised as an international game. Martin was not the first choice in the New Zealand game, as the selectors had chosen Cardiff's Clem Lewis, but Lewis had picked up an injury playing for the British Army team. Martin was drafted in as a late replacement but during the game injured his head saving a try. Martin was removed from play, but later recovered and resumed the game, although his play was not as strong after the event.Billot (1972), pg 51.

Thomas's last game was the following year in a match against Scotland.

While playing in Britain he represented two county teams, Somerset and Monmouthshire. In 1908 Waller turned out for Newport against the touring Australian team. He debuted for Wales against the same touring Australian team he faced with Newport. The next year he was selected to play in all three matches of the 1909 Home Nations Championship. In his first Home Nations match against England he was joined by fellow Newport player Jack Jones and Swansea's Jack Bancroft. Wales won all their matches and won the Triple Crown. Wales and Waller also faced France during 1909, and after beating them Wales won the unofficial Grand Slam. Waller is therefore one of the very few Welsh internationals to have defeated a Southern Hemisphere team and won a Grand Slam in the same season. Waller played once more for Wales, again against France in a record breaking game in 1910."]}, {"page": "List of cricket and rugby union players", "response": ["| Jack Bancroft"]}, {"page": "William Davies (rugby)", "response": ["Davies began playing rugby union as a schoolboy playing for both Aberavon Council School and Port Talbot County School. The first notable club that Davies represented was Aberavon, and it was from Aberavon that Davies was first selected to represent the Wales national team. Davies played two international games for Wales, both as part of the 1912 Five Nations Championship. Davies' first cap was against Scotland played at St Helen's, which Wales won 21\u20136. Davies was selected for the next Wales match of the tournament, an away encounter to Ireland. The game started well for Wales, with Davies scoring his only international points, a try in the first half which was converted by Jack Bancroft. Despite Wales leading 5\u20130, the more experienced Irish team came back in the second half winning 12\u20135.", "By the end of 1912, Davies had switched clubs from Aberavon to Swansea, and in October he was selected to play for county team Glamorgan when they faced the second touring South African team. Davies was not originally a first choice for the team, with Cardiff's Billy Spiller chosen not only as centre but also team captain. Three of the backs selected for the encounter, Spiller, Swansea centre Alf Thomas and fullback Jack Bancroft were all withdrawn injured after the teams met in a club clash the previous Saturday. Davies was called in to replace Spiller and was also given the captaincy.
