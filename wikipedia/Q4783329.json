She championed Darwinian evolution with particular emphasis on the mind and morals, in contrast to the prevailing emphasis on competition and physical survival. Charles Darwin described her as being able to 'treat evolution with much dexterity and thruthfulness'.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Darwin from Insectivorous Plants to Worms", "response": ["Wallace was suffering \"ever-increasing anxiety\" over funds, and Arabella Buckley, Lyell's old secretary, pleaded with Darwin to help him find \"some modest work\". Hooker persuaded Darwin it was hopeless, noting that Wallace had \"lost caste\" over spiritualism and a \u00a3500 bet he had won by proving the world was a globe to a rich flat-earth fanatic who then started litigation which cost Wallace more than the bet had won. When Wallace's \"best book\" to date, Island Life, came out in November 1880 Darwin devoted all his attention to getting his friends to sign a testimonial he wrote, then rushed it to Gladstone before the re-opening of Parliament at the start of January and was overjoyed when Gladstone agreed to recommend a civil list pension of \u00a3200 a year, backdated six months. As Darwin passed on the good news to Wallace, Emma organised the family accounts so that Charles could distribute the surplus from the year's \u00a38,000 investment income to the children."]}, {"page": "List of people from Brighton and Hove", "response": ["*Arabella Buckley, writer and populariser of science, was born in Brighton in 1840"]}, {"page": "William Kitchen Parker", "response": ["That is certainly not the prose of the usual science author.
