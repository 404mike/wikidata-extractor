He specialises in algebra and group theory.\nHe studied at Peterhouse, Cambridge, before taking a PhD at Queen Mary College, University of London, in 1972, supervised by Bertram Wehrfritz, with a dissertation on group theory entitled Groups of Automorphisms of Infinite Soluble Groups. He is an Emeritus Fellow of All Souls College at Oxford, where he was sub-warden from 2006 to 2008.His postgraduate students have included Marcus du Sautoy and Geoff Smith.

These include classification of aleph-one categorical theories of groups and fields in 1971, which was very influential in the development of geometric stability theory. In 1976, he proved a result on quantifier elimination for p-adic fields from which a theory of semi-algebraic and subanalytic geometry for p-adic fields follows (in analogy with that for the real field) as shown by Jan Denef and Lou van den Dries and others. This quantifier elimination theorem was used by Jan Denef in 1984 to prove a conjecture of Jean-Pierre Serre on rationality of various p-adic Poincar\u00e9 series, and subsequently these methods have been applied to prove rationality of a wide range of generating functions in group theory (e.g. subgroup growth) and number theory by various authors, notably Dan Segal and Marcus du Sautoy. Macintyre worked with Zo\u00e9 Chatzidakis and Lou van den Dries on definable sets over finite fields generalising the estimates of Serge Lang and Andr\u00e9 Weil to definable sets an revisiting the work of James Ax on the logic of finite and pseudofinite fields.
