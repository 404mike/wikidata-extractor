He was the founder of a great school of English horn playing.  His grandson Dennis Brain was to become perhaps the most famous horn player of all time.  \nA.E. Brain was born in 1860.  His father fought in the Crimean War and was an invalid.  Alfred was not well educated.  When he was 12 he joined the Scots Guards and played the horn in the band.  He married in 1880 and had seven children.  Two of the children became great horn players: Alfred and Aubrey.   \nHe played in several orchestras, including the Philharmonic Society, the Queen\u2019s Hall Orchestra and Covent Garden.  He played a lot for Henry Wood in The Proms.  In orchestras he nearly always played fourth horn, so his nickname was \u201cGeorge IV\u201d.  In 1904 he became a founding member of the London Symphony Orchestra.  The four horn players in that orchestra: Adolf Borsdorf,  Thomas Busby,  Henri Van der Meerschen and A.E. Brain, were often called \u201cGod\u2019s Own Quartet\u201d because they blended together so well.\nHe died in 1929 after a short retirement. \n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Aubrey Brain", "response": ["Aubrey Harold Brain was born in London in 1893.
