In 1944, his father Laurence Goodwin was killed by a V-1 flying bomb (\"doodlebug\") while waiting at a bus stop in South London. In 1948, while working at a department store, Goodwin approached Monkhouse and they formed a writing and comedy partnership that lasted for fourteen years.Goodwin and Monkhouse wrote scripts for comedians such as Derek Roy, Ted Ray and Arthur Askey. Eventually they were given their own television series, Fast and Loose (1954), which they co-wrote and in which they both appeared. However, Goodwin lacked Monkhouse's talent for improvisation and was less assured as a performer.His creative partnership with Monkhouse gradually disintegrated and finally came to an end in 1962 when he was offered work in the US on Bob Hope's gag writing team. However, Goodwin was unable to cope with the fast-paced life in America and returned to England. After returning to the UK he was the scriptwriter for Bright's Boffins (1970) and in 1974 wrote shows for Max Bygraves and David Frost.\nHe was married twice: his first marriage was to Barbara (1956) with whom he had two children \u2014 Jeremy (1958) and Suki (1960). They divorced in 1967 and in 1971 he married Jane Cappleman.\nIn 1968, he was convicted of shoplifting from a West End shop and fined \u00a370.In 1975, Goodwin committed suicide by means of an overdose of sleeping tablets, aged 45.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Charlie Drake", "response": ["Drake made his first appearance on stage at the age of eight, and after leaving school toured working men's clubs.
