They later scripted the BBC sitcom All Night Long. In 1982 Wallington walked the South West coast path with his urban dog, Boogie. He wrote up the journey in 500 Mile Walkies which became a best seller. Boogie up the River followed in 1989. In 1991 Wallington published a novel, The Missing Postman, and then scripted the TV series of the same name starring James Bolam. His second novel, Happy Birthday Shakespeare (1999), was also turned into a TV two-parter.\nWallington's further TV work includes Station Jim (2001) and The Man Who Lost His Head (2007). In 2005 he published The Day Job, an account of his gardening days, and in 2012 The Uke of Wallington, the story of his journey through Britain with a ukulele.\nHe is married with two sons, Francis and Daniel.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "River Thames", "response": ["Mark Wallington describes a journey up the Thames in a camping skiff, in his 1989 book Boogie up the River ()."]}, {"page": "Pennine Way", "response": ["Barry Pilton's book One Man and His Bog gives a more lighthearted and personal account of completing the Pennine Way, with a foreword by Mike Harding.
