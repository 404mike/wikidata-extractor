Ward said that Lawson provided no evidence to back his claim which is contrary to satellite measurements, and Lawson similarly incorrectly implied that the correlation between CO2 and sea levels was uncertain as well as that sea levels were rising more slowly since 1950 than before it."]}, {"page": "Kevin Anderson", "response": ["Kevin Anderson may refer to:", "* Kevin Anderson (actor) (born 1960), American actor", "* Kevin Anderson (tenor) (fl. 1990s), American opera singer", "* Kevin Anderson (cinematographer), Australian cinematographer and filmmaker", "* Kevin Anderson (athletic director) (born 1955), American university sports administrator", "* Kevin Anderson (soccer) (born 1971), American soccer midfielder", "* Kevin Anderson (boxer) (born 1983), British boxer", "* Kevin Anderson (tennis) (born 1986), South African tennis player", "* Kevin Anderson (basketball) (born 1988), American basketball player", "* Kevin Anderson (scientist) (born 1962), British climate scientist", "* Kevin Anderson (train conductor) (died 2018), fatally wounded during the Ponton train derailment", "* Kevin Anderson (politician), Australian politician"]}, {"page": "Charles Moore, Baron Moore of Etchingham", "response": ["In December 2019, Moore was a guest editor on the BBC flagship news programme, Today, where he invited fellow Global Warming Policy Foundation affiliates Matt Ridley and Michael Kelly to be interviewed in back-to-back editions of the programme also featuring climate activist Greta Thunberg and climate scientist Kevin Anderson.
