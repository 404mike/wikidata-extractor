In 1836 he settled in Florence, Italy, where he spent the rest of his life.As a painter, he specialized, mainly painting Alpine landscapes. At the 1870 Exhibition of Fine Arts in Parma, he exhibited an oil: Bagni of Lucca. Among other works are Dallo Porte Sante and La pensierosa. At Florence, in 1882: Veduta della Marina. In 1885, in the same city: Veduta del Chalet Plauta.Though not himself an entomologist, he joined the Entomological Society of London at its founding in 1833, and was noted as its longest-surviving original member.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cassone", "response": ["Since a cassone contained the personal goods of the bride, it was a natural vehicle for painted decoration commemorating the marriage in heraldry and, when figural painted panels began to be included in the decor from the early quattrocento, flattering allegory. The side panels offered a flat surface for a suitable painting, with subjects drawn from courtly romance or, much less often, religious subjects.  By the 15th century subjects from classical mythology or history became the most popular. Great Florentine artists of the 15th century were called upon to decorate cassoni, though as Vasari complains, by his time in the 16th century, artists thought such work beneath them.  Some Tuscan artists in Siena and Florence specialized in such cassone panels, which were preserved as autonomous works of art by 19th century collectors and dealers, who sometimes discarded the cassone itself. From the late 1850s, neo-Renaissance cassoni were confected for dealers like William Blundell Spence, Stefano Bardini or Elia Volpi in order to present surviving cassone panels to clients in a more \"authentic\" and glamorous presentation.Ellen Callmann, \"William Blundell Spence and the Transformation of Renaissance Cassoni\".

His interest in painting fostered friendships with Massimo d'Azeglio, Prime Minister of Piedmont, and Giovanni Morelli, who were entertained at the British Legation. Hudson's mutual friends, art historian and diplomat Austen Layard and Florence-based English artist William Blundell Spence were visitors, and all could have been longstanding friends, Layard and Spence being at school together in Florence during Hudson's visit in 1829. First mention of Hudson's collection at the Legation was in 1856 by a National Gallery agent, who noted the Portrait of a Young Knight by Moretto da Brescia, seen again during a viewing of all Legation paintings by Sir Charles Eastlake, director of the National Gallery; The Moretto was acquired for the Gallery in 1857.Eastlake, Elizabeth Rigby (1895); Journals & Correspondence of Lady Eastlake, edited C.
