Barry Conlon scored two of the goals in just his fourth league start of the season, with Peter Thorne scoring City's other goal in a 3\u20133 draw. The first round of the FA Cup saw City drawn against Milton Keynes Dons, who had won promotion to League One the previous season. However, City pulled off an upset with a 2\u20131 victory at stadium:mk with goals from Daley and Lee. The following week's return to league action saw City against Wycombe Wanderers, who were second in the league and had the only remaining undefeated league record in the country. A second half goal from Lewis Hunt gave Wycombe a 1\u20130 victory. Full back Luke O'Brien scored his first senior goal in City's next league game as City defeated Rotherham United 2\u20130 in their first game at the Don Valley Stadium, Rotherham's temporary home. Nicky Law's first goal of his second spell completed the scoring. A second half penalty from Conlon three days later against Chesterfield gave City back-to-back victories and their second 3\u20132 of the season after being 2\u20130 down. First half goals from Graeme Lee and Michael Boulding had started the comeback in the first half before Chesterfield were reduced to ten men when Alan Goodall was sent off for committing the foul which led to Conlon's penalty. Winger Omar Daley was injured in the game, becoming the latest midfielder to be sidelined. As a result, McCall brought into another loan transfer two days later by signing Steve Jones from Burnley for one month. Jones made his debut the following weekend as City lost 2\u20131 in the FA Cup second round to League One's Leyton Orient."]}, {"page": "List of Bradford City A.F.C. players (1\u201349 league appearances)", "response": ["|Lewis Hunt||||2010\u20132011||25||1||"]}, {"page": "History of Southend United F.C.", "response": ["Following the play off defeat to Doncaster Rovers manager Steve Tilson began a mass summer clear out when Goalkeeper Steve Collis, Defender Lewis Hunt, Winger Tommy Black and club captain and loyal servant for over 10 years Kevin Maher were all released.
