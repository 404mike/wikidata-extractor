He played more than 150 games in the top two divisions of the Football League for Birmingham City.\nBorn in South Yardley, Birmingham, Foster joined Birmingham City as a junior, making his first-team debut at the age of 19 as a full back. For the next three seasons he played occasionally for the first team either at full back or as Trevor Smith's deputy at centre-half, most notably in the first leg of the 1961 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final against A.S. Roma. When Smith sustained the injury that resulted in him leaving the club, Foster took over at centre half and kept his place for another couple of seasons. He was used less frequently in his last two years at the club, and spent three months on loan at Crewe Alexandra before making a permanent move to Plymouth Argyle where he ended his Football League career. He went on to play for Chelmsford City and Bromsgrove Rovers, and spent one season as Bromsgrove's assistant manager.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of people from Birmingham", "response": ["*Winston Foster \u2013 Footballer"]}, {"page": "1961 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final", "response": ["Going into this match, Birmingham were bottom of the table with only one win in ten games. The previous week, forward Robin Stubbs had dislocated his shoulder, and during a Football League Cup replay unhelpfully scheduled for the Monday night, 48 hours before the Roma match, England international Trevor Smith had to leave the field with a thigh strain as Birmingham lost to Third Division side Swindon Town. The 19-year-old Winston Foster, who had previously been used only at right-back, took Smith's place at centre-half, alongside Hennessey and Malcolm Beard in a half-back line composed entirely of teenagers. The players were intended to enjoy a relaxing visit to Warwick Castle the day before the game, but the weather was so wet that the trip was cancelled.", "|CH||5|| Winston Foster"]}, {"page": "Winston (name)", "response": ["* Winston Foster (born 1941), English former footballer"]}, {"page": "1968\u201369 Birmingham City F.C. season", "response": ["!scope=\"row\"| Winston Foster"]}, {"page": "1967\u201368 Birmingham City F.C. season", "response": ["!scope=\"row\"| Winston Foster"]}, {"page": "1966\u201367 Birmingham City F.C. season", "response": ["!scope=\"row\"| Winston Foster"]}, {"page": "1965\u201366 Birmingham City F.C. season", "response": ["!scope=\"row\"| Winston Foster"]}, {"page": "1964\u201365 Birmingham City F.C. season", "response": ["Twenty-six players made at least one appearance in nationally organised first-team competition, and there were fifteen different goalscorers.
