In this it drew upon a longstanding tradition of Cuban nationalism. Castro biographer Sebastian Balfour noted that \"the vein of moral regeneration and voluntarism that runs through\" Castro's thought owes far more to \"Hispanic nationalism\" than European socialism or Marxism\u2013Leninism. Historian Richard Gott remarked that one of the keys to Castro's success was his ability to use the \"twin themes of socialism and nationalism\" and keep them \"endlessly in play\". Castro described Karl Marx and Cuban nationalist Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed as his main political influences, although Gott believed that Mart\u00ed ultimately remained more important than Marx in Castro's politics. Castro described Mart\u00ed's political ideas as \"a philosophy of independence and an exceptional humanistic philosophy\", and his supporters and apologists repeatedly claimed that there were great similarities between the two figures.", "Historian and journalist Richard Gott considered Castro to be \"one of the most extraordinary political figures of the twentieth century\", commenting that he had become a \"world hero in the mould\" of Giuseppe Garibaldi to people throughout the developing world for his anti-imperialist efforts. Balfour stated that Castro's story had \"few parallels in contemporary history\", for there existed no other \"Third World leader\" in the second half of the twentieth century who held \"such a prominent and restless part on the international stage\" or remained head of state for such a long period. Bourne described Castro as \"an influential world leader\" who commanded \"great respect\" from individuals of all political ideologies across the developing world. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau described Castro as a \"remarkable leader\" and a \"larger than life leader who served his people.\" The European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said that Castro \"was a hero for many.\" Russian President Vladimir Putin described Castro as both \"a sincere and reliable friend of Russia\" and a \"symbol of an era\", while Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping similarly referred to him as \"a close comrade and a sincere friend\" to China. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi termed him \"one of the most iconic personalities of the 20th century\" and a \"great friend\", while South African President Jacob Zuma praised Castro for aiding black South Africans in \"our struggle against apartheid\". He was awarded a wide variety of awards and honors from foreign governments and was cited as an inspiration for foreign leaders like Ahmed Ben Bella and Nelson Mandela, who subsequently awarded him South Africa's highest civilian award for foreigners, the Order of Good Hope.

Richard Gott extended the mediocrity principle to argue that if there is nothing special about observing an object in the present moment (Tnow), then one can expect the present moment to occur randomly between the start (Tstart) and the end (Tend) of the observed object's longevity. Therefore, the total longevity of an observable object can be expected (with 50% confidence) to lie in the interval 1/3 \u22c5 Tstart < Tnow < 3 \u22c5 Tend. This estimation technique was derived after a 1969 visit to the Berlin Wall, which was constructed eight years prior. Gott reasoned that there was nothing special about the timing of his visit, so the above equation (with T = 8) estimates that the Berlin Wall would last for at least 2.67 years but would last no longer than 24 years (the Berlin Wall fell 22 years later, in 1991).

Krause's philosophy  flourished in Spain (where it was known as \"Krausismo\") because it contains elements which were very appealing - at the time - to a diverse class of people. Krausism in Spain was popular and successful, more as a broad cultural movement rather than as a specialised form of cosmo-theology. As a cultural movement, it emphasised scientific rationalism, combined with Christian spirituality, a liberal commitment to individual freedom, and opposition to privilege and arbitrary power. Spanish intellectuals influenced by Krause include Francisco Giner de los R\u00edos (1839-1915) and Gumersindo de Azc\u00e1rate (1840-1917).
