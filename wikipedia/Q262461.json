She is the author of several books, including The PETA Practical Guide to Animal Rights: Simple Acts of Kindness to Help Animals in Trouble (2009) and Animalkind: Remarkable Discoveries About Animals and Revolutionary New Ways to Show Them Compassion (2020). Newkirk has worked for the animal-protection movement since 1972. Under her leadership in the 1970s as the District of Columbia's first female poundmaster, legislation was passed to create the first spay/neuter clinic in Washington, D.C., as well as an adoption program and the public funding of veterinary services, leading her to be among those chosen in 1980 as Washingtonians of the Year. She is an atheist.Newkirk founded PETA in March 1980 with fellow animal rights activist Alex Pacheco. They came to public attention in 1981, during what became known as the Silver Spring monkeys case, when Pacheco photographed 17 macaque monkeys being experimented on inside the Institute of Behavioral Research in Silver Spring, Maryland. The case led to the first police raid in the United States on an animal research laboratory and to an amendment in 1985 to the Animal Welfare Act. Since then, Newkirk has led campaigns to stop the use of animals in crash tests, convinced companies to stop testing cosmetics on animals, pressed for higher welfare standards from the meat industry, and organized undercover investigations that have led to government sanctions against companies, universities, and entertainers who use animals. She is known, in particular, for the media stunts that she organizes to draw attention to animal-protection issues. In her will, for example, she has asked that her skin be turned into wallets, her feet into umbrella stands, and her flesh into \"Newkirk Nuggets\", then grilled on a barbecue. \"We are complete press sluts\", she told The New Yorker in 2003: \"It is our obligation. We would be worthless if we were just polite and didn't make any waves.\"Although PETA takes a gradualist approach to improving animal welfare, Newkirk remains committed to ending animal use and the idea that, as PETA's slogan says, \"animals are not ours to eat, wear, experiment on, or use for entertainment\". Some animal rights abolitionists, most notably Gary Francione, have criticized PETA, calling it and other groups \"the new welfarists\". Some members of the animal advocacy movement have responded that Francione's position is unnecessarily divisive. Newkirk has also been criticized for her support of actions carried out in the name of the Animal Liberation Front. Newkirk's position is that the animal rights movement is a revolutionary one and that \"[t]hinkers may prepare revolutions, but bandits must carry them out\". PETA itself, however, \"maintains a creed of nonviolence and does not advocate actions in which anyone, human or nonhuman, is injured\". Newkirk and PETA have also been criticized for euthanizing many of the animals taken into PETA's shelters, including healthy pets,  and opposition to the whole notion of pets,  and her position that \"There's no rational basis for saying that a human being has special rights. A rat is a pig is a dog is a boy,\" as well as seemingly seeing eradication as a goal. PETA has responded to this line of criticism.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Peter Singer", "response": ["* Save the Animals!

She moved to the United States as a teenager, first studying to become a stockbroker, but after taking some abandoned kittens to an animal shelter in 1969 and being appalled by the conditions that she found there, she chose a career in animal protection instead.Phelps, Norm.

If, as has been reported, this dentist and his guides lured Cecil out of the park with food so as to shoot him on private property, because shooting him in the park would have been illegal, he needs to be extradited, charged, and, preferably, hanged.\"", "In 2017, Ingrid Newkirk sent a letter of complaint to Nintendo about their video game 1-2-Switch, during which players get to milk a cow. In her letter, Newkirk called the game \"unrealistic\" and wrote \"you've taken all the cruelty out of milking\". She also suggested that \"instead of sugarcoating the subject, Nintendo switch to simulating activities in which no animals suffer.\""]}, {"page": "Animal welfare", "response": ["Animal rights advocates, such as Gary L. Francione and Tom Regan, argue that the animal welfare position (advocating for the betterment of the condition of animals, but without abolishing animal use) is inconsistent in logic and ethically unacceptable. However, there are some animal right groups, such as PETA, which support animal welfare measures in the short term to alleviate animal suffering until all animal use is ended.Interview with Ingrid Newkirk, David Shankbone, Wikinews, 20 November 2007.", "According to PETA's Ingrid Newkirk in an interview with Wikinews, there are two issues in animal welfare and animal rights. \"If I only could have one thing, it would be to end suffering\", said Newkirk. \"If you could take things from animals and kill animals all day long without causing them suffering, then I would take it... Everybody should be able to agree that animals should not suffer if you kill them or steal from them by taking the fur off their backs or take their eggs, whatever.
