In 1818 following experiments with animals, he performed the first successful transfusion of human blood to treat postpartum hemorrhage. Blundell used the patient's husband as a donor, and extracted four ounces of blood from his arm to transfuse into his wife. During the years 1825 and 1830, Blundell performed 10 transfusions, five of which were beneficial, and published his results. He also invented a number of instruments for the transfusion of blood.Ellis, H.

He made a substantial amount of money from this endeavour, roughly $2 million ($50 million real dollars).", "Work to emulate James Blundell continued in Edinburgh.

The first solutions which saw widespread use for IV injections were simple \"saline-like solutions\", which were followed by experiments with various other liquids, including milk, sugar, honey, and egg yolk. In the 1830s, James Blundell, an English obstetrician, used intravenous administration of blood to treat women bleeding profusely during or after delivery. This predated the understanding of blood type, leading to unpredictable results."]}, {"page": "1818 in science", "response": ["* September 25 \u2013 In London, Dr James Blundell carries out the first blood transfusion using human blood."]}, {"page": "List of English inventions and discoveries", "response": ["* 1818 or 1829: First successful blood transfusion performed by James Blundell (1791\u20131878)."]}, {"page": "James Blundell", "response": ["James Blundell may refer to:", "*James Blundell (physician) (1790\u20131878), English obstetrician", "*James Blundell (singer) (born 1964), Australian country music singer", "**James Blundell (album), 1989"]}, {"page": "James Blundell (1791-1878)", "response": ["#REDIRECT James Blundell (physician)"]}, {"page": "1818 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 25 September \u2013 Dr James Blundell carries out the first blood transfusion using human blood, in London."]}, {"page": "Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service", "response": ["* James Blundell (physician)"]}, {"page": "Blundell", "response": ["*James Blundell (physician) (1791\u20131878), British obstetrician", "*James Blundell (singer) (born 1964), Australian country music singer"]}, {"page": "Birmingham Accident Hospital", "response": ["In his 1957 lecture to the St. John Ambulance Brigade Surgeons' Conference in Harrogate, Ruscoe Clarke described the old theory of shock and why it failed.
