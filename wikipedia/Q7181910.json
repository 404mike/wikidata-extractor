(1967\u2013present)", "response": ["The following season Davison was again top scorer and, alongside new signings such as Jeff Chandler, Ross McLaren and future-England manager Steve McLaren and John Gregory, helped the club earn promotion for the third tier at the second attempt, setting the club record of 84 points in a season from 3 points for a win, as they finished third in the 1985\u201386 Third Division, recording some big wins along the way; a 7\u20130 win over Lincoln City was the club's biggest league win since before World War I. With a 46-game league programme, a run to the FA Cup fifth round, which included a 6\u20131 win over Telford United, the League Cup 3rd Round and participation in the Associate Members' Cup's Southern Qualifying Group, Derby played 60 competitive matches between 17 August 1985 and 12 May 1986, a club record, with Steve Buckley, Ross McLaren and Gary Micklewhite taking part in 58 games each. A buoyant feeling had returned to The Baseball Ground, and Cox was in his pomp, shaping a tightly knit group of players who each knew their jobs and respected each other which was supplemented with considered signings such as Phil Gee from Gresley Rovers and Nigel Callaghan from Watford. Following promotion the club won the 1986\u201387 Second Division at a canter, 6 points ahead of second placed Portsmouth and equalled the previous season's record of 84 points, though this was taken from 42 rather than 46 fixtures. After an opening day home defeat by Oldham Athletic the club went unbeaten at The Baseball Ground in the league for the rest of the season. Bobby Davison (who finished top league scorer for the fifth season on a row, with 19 strikes, taking his league tally to 82 in 5 years) and Phil Gee grabbed 32 goals between them, half of Derby's total, and Cox's team set a club record with 11 away league victories to secure a return to top-flight football after a traumatic seven years away.", "Despite such struggles Saunders had managed an impressive 17 goals, almost half of Derby's 37 total, and it was no surprise that the club failed to hold on to him as he was sold to Liverpool for \u00a32.9m (over \u00a32m more than the previous record fee received for a Derby player), along with Mark Wright, who commanded a \u00a32.3m. Much of the cash from this \u00a35.2m windfall went into paying off Robert Maxwell. Maxwell was replaced first by Brian Fearn and then by Lionel Pickering, who made his fortune through the founding and running of a free newspaper, and brought majority shareholdings and invested \u00a312m in the form of a loan. Derby went from being financially stricken to one of the richest clubs outside the top flight. Derby twice broke its transfer record in the space of a month when in March 1992 they signed Paul Kitson for \u00a31.3m from Leicester City (Phil Gee being one of two players going in the opposite direction) and then Tommy Johnson for Notts County ten days later. Paul Simpson also came in from big money (\u00a3800k from Oxford United) as did Marco Gabbiadini (\u00a31.3m from Sunderland) and even Bobby Davison (who had left for Leeds United three years earlier), returned for a spell on loan and reached a century of goals for Derby, only the 7th player and most recent to do so, when he netted in a 2\u20132 draw with Newcastle United. Despite such attacking prowess, and the setting of a new club record for 12 away wins in a season, Derby could only finish 3rd in the 1991\u201392 Second Division and missed out on automatic promotion by 2 points. As a result, Derby entered the Football League playoffs for the first time since they had been introduced in 1987. Facing off against fellow big spenders Blackburn Rovers, Derby fell at the semi final stage as a 2\u20131 win at The Baseball Ground wasn't enough to overcome a 4\u20132 defeat at Ewood Park in the first leg and they crashed out 4\u20135 on aggregate and missed out on the opportunity to be a part of the inaugural Premier League, instead spending the 1992\u201393 season in the renamed Division One."]}, {"page": "Derby County F.C.\u2013Leicester City F.C. rivalry", "response": ["* Phil Gee"]}, {"page": "1991\u201392 Derby County F.C. season", "response": ["*  Phil Gee \u2013  Leicester City, part-exchange for Kitson, March"]}, {"page": "1991\u201392 Leicester City F.C. season", "response": ["|Phil Gee"]}, {"page": "1986\u201387 Derby County F.C. season", "response": ["|Phil Gee"]}, {"page": "1992 Football League Second Division play-off Final", "response": ["Businessman Jack Walker had bought a 62% controlling stake in Blackburn Rovers in 1991.

David Lacey in The Guardian reported that Dalglish spent \u00a35.5million (equivalent to \u00a3\u00a0million in ) on transfers during the season.
