For his performances he was awarded the club's Player of the Year award. However, he went into retirement in the summer, joining Staffordshire Police as a recreation officer. He did though return to Vale Park on a non-contract basis in September 1986 after Mark Grew picked up a knee injury; this crisis was resolved in November 1986, when Vale signed Alex Williams, and so Arnold stepped down once more, having played fifteen games of the 1986\u201387 campaign."]}, {"page": "1986\u201387 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["The season opened with a 2\u20132 draw at crisis club Middlesbrough, who were forced to play the fixture at Hartlepool, after finding themselves kicked out of Ayresome Park. Vale also drew their opening home match the following week against Rotherham United, and Grew was forced off with a knee injury and Alan Webb split his shinbone. Jim Arnold agreed to return to the club on non-contract terms to replace the injured Grew. Playing a 'fluent, passing game', Vale defeated bogey-team Walsall, who had maintained a 21-game unbeaten league run against the \"Valiants\" since 1965. Ageing Arnold failed to maintain his fitness and Vale struggled around the foot of the table. Rudge signed 'giant' Alex Williams on loan from Manchester City. Despite Andy Jones leading the scoring charts, Vale still suffered, and Rudge's attempts to sign Steve Bull from West Bromwich Albion failed. On 9 November, Vale Park hosted an American football match, in which Locomotive Derby beat the Stoke Spitfires 13\u20138. By the end of the month Vale were cut four points adrift at the bottom of the league. The next month John Williams was sold to Bournemouth for \u00a330,000, having been in poor form for Vale. Rudge then splashed out \u00a35,000 on Bristol City's Gary Hamson. He also brought Bob Hazell in from Reading on a free transfer.", "Hazell successfully shored up the Vale defence, as in his first three games the Vale kept three clean sheets. In January, O'Kelly required a knee operation, but good news came as Alex Williams was signed permanently for \u00a310,000. On 27 January, Robbie Earle made his 142nd consecutive appearance in a 1\u20131 draw with Rotherham United at Millmoor, picking up a groin injury that put him into the treatment room. The next week a 4\u20132 win over Doncaster Rovers was the last of a streak of six games unbeaten, that took the Vale up to fourteenth in the table. Rudge attempted to sign Don Goodman, who was transfer listed at Bradford City, but ended his interest after being quoted \u00a3100,000. A bad February ended with a 6\u20131 capitulation at home to Blackpool, Vale's biggest home defeat since March of the disastrous 1956\u201357 season. Vale picked up eleven of a possible eighteen points in March, with Rudge also signing Darren Beckford on loan from Manchester City. On 28 March, the club recorded their biggest ever away win by thumping Fulham 6\u20130 at Craven Cottage, with Jones bagging a hat-trick. On 1 April, Jones was selected for the Wales squad, and scored past Finland.

More injuries came as Chris Banks had his nose broken after a reserve match at Barnsley when he was attacked by a gang of youths whilst waiting at a fish and chip shop. Alan Webb then suffered second degree burns at Preston North End's plastic pitch at Deepdale. The next month Rudge tried to replace Jones when he signed David Riley from Nottingham Forest for \u00a320,000. Despite a good start Riley soon entered a goal drought, as Vale went twelve league games without a win (including eight defeats). Robbie Earle missed much of this period with a hernia injury. In November Kevin Steggles was signed from West Bromwich Albion for 'a small fee' to replace the still-injured Webb.
