He studied medicine at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, graduating MA. In the subsequent years, he studied natural sciences at the University of Cambridge and was awarded DSc.\nHe conducted research on plant physiology, in particular photosynthesis, in Cambridge until his retirement in 1936. Gabrielle Matthaei was his assistant until 1905. He was elected in May 1906 a Fellow of the Royal Society, his candidature citation reading \"Fellow of St John's College, Cambridge. Ex-Lecturer and now Reader in Botany in the University.\" He has made distinguished investigations in plant physiology. In 1921 he was awarded the Royal Medal and in 1923 delivered the Croonian lecture.\nHe was buried at the Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground in Cambridge, with his wife Elsie (1882 - 1967).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "July 25", "response": ["*1866 \u2013 Frederick Blackman, English physiologist and academic (died 1947)"]}, {"page": "January 30", "response": ["*1947 \u2013 Frederick Blackman, English botanist and physiologist (b. 1866)"]}, {"page": "Photosynthesis", "response": ["In the early 20th century, Frederick Blackman and Gabrielle Matthaei investigated the effects of light intensity (irradiance) and temperature on the rate of carbon assimilation."]}, {"page": "1947", "response": ["* January 30 \u2013 Frederick Blackman, British plant physiologist (b.1866)"]}, {"page": "1866", "response": ["* July 25 \u2013 Frederick Blackman, English plant physiologist (d. 1947)"]}, {"page": "1905 in science", "response": ["* Frederick Blackman proposes his law of limiting factors in relation to photosynthesis.\"Optima and Limiting Factors\".

The land was flat and unpromising as a garden site, but the layout was planned with great skill, utilizing an old gravel pit to construct a lake with a high mound running into it. Trees and shrubs were planted according to their botanical sequence, a range of glasshouses was built in the 1860s, and a rock garden, one of the earliest of its kind in the country, was constructed about the same time. The Garden has also long been known for its many fine specimens of rare trees. By the 1870s the main features of the Garden had been developed and, it was ready to play its part in the great expansion of botanical teaching and research that was about to take place at Cambridge. During the early years of the 20th century much of the pioneer work of William Bateson, Charles Chamberlain Hurst, and Edith Rebecca Saunders on plant genetics was carried out at the Garden, and it was later used for researches on plant physiology by Frederick Blackman and George Edward Briggs, and on plant pathology by Frederick Tom Brooks and others."]}, {"page": "Limiting factor", "response": ["In 1905 Frederick Blackman articulated the role of limiting factors as follows: \"When a process is conditioned as to its rapidity by several separate factors the rate of the process is limited by the pace of the slowest factor.\" In terms of the magnitude of a function, he wrote, \"When the magnitude of a function is limited by one of a set of possible factors, increase of that factor, and of that one alone, will be found to bring about an increase of the magnitude of the function.\"F.F.

It was during this time period that he met his future wife, Brenda Stoessiger who was a research student working with Karl Pearson, a pioneer of mathematical statistics. Years later, Donald Pigott, then Director, Cambridge University Botanic Garden, wrote (for Clapham's obituary in the Journal of Ecology) that it was probably through his connection to Fisher that Clapham met Stoessiger.

She also produced two papers independently.

After Darwin's retirement, Pertz was encouraged by Frederick Blackman to undertake research on meristematic tissue, but after a year observing germinating seeds her results were inconclusive.
