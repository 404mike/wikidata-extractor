She purchased Home Farm and residents believed she was a wealthy widow. However, Bernice Blackstock (Samantha Giles) realised Stella reminded her of her old hairdresser from Leeds and after \"one glass of champagne too many\", Stella revealed that she was a hairdresser who had won the National Lottery. Of why Stella kept her past a secret, Schonfield said \"She came to Emmerdale to be somewhere where nobody would know her. Previous experiences have taught her people can get a bit funny about her being a Lottery winner and treat her differently as a result.

However, Bernice's sister, Nicola (Nicola Wheeler), later calls Steve's wife to let her know about the affair. On Steve's past and the affair with Bernice, Mannion explained \"This is presumption and assumption on my part, but from what I suspect, this is the first time this has happened to Steve. I don't think he has done this before - he's not a practised philanderer. An affair is not the norm for him. I think Steve has been totally swept up by this gorgeous, attractive woman who has come into his life. He's just gone, 'Wow this is really different'. I don't think he expected it to go the way it has, and now he's terrified about his marriage break-up.
