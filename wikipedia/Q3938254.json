He was the son of Sir William Dormer, and thus a grandson of Robert Dormer, 1st Baron Dormer. His mother was Alice Molyneux, daughter of Sir Richard Molyneux, 1st Baronet, and Frances Gerard.

In 1635 the townsfolk of Chesham protested to the Sheriff of Buckinghamshire, Sir Peter Temple, who was reluctantly enforcing a writ requiring payment of a levy to the King. Not surprisingly given the local allegiances to John Hampden, the towns' people largely sided with the Parliamentarians at the outbreak of the English Civil War. During 1642 the influential Parliamentarians John Pym and Earl of Warwick were headquartered in the town along with large numbers of troops. There are records of skirmishes in the area during 1643 when Prince Rupert was stationed near Aylesbury and dispatched Robert Dormer, 1st Earl of Carnarvon to pillage nearby towns, such as Wendover. Heading toward Chesham a company of horse of the Parliamentary Army from the town met them outside Great Missenden where a skirmish took place ending with the Parliamentary force being driven back."]}, {"page": "Dorchester, Dorset", "response": ["In 1642, just before the English Civil War, Hugh Green, a Catholic chaplain was executed here. After his execution, Puritans played football with his head. The town was heavily defended against the Royalists in the civil war and Dorset was known as \"the southern capital of coat-turning\", as the county gentry found it expedient to change allegiance and to swap the sides they supported on several occasions. In 1643, the town was attacked by 2,000 troops under Robert Dormer, 1st Earl of Carnarvon. Its defences proved inadequate and it quickly surrendered but was spared the plunder and punishment it might otherwise have received. It remained under Royalist control for some time, but was eventually recaptured by the Puritans."]}, {"page": "Buckland, Buckinghamshire", "response": ["Before the Norman conquest of England, the manor of Buckland was held by the Diocese of Dorchester-on-Thames in Oxfordshire under the control of Godric. After 1066 William I granted it to the Bishop of Lincoln. It remained so until the 16th century when the then tenant, the Earl of Warwick forfeited it to the Crown. By 1584 it had been passed to Robert Dormer, 1st Earl of Carnarvon. Robert was killed fighting on the Royalist side during the English Civil War at the first Battle of Newbury. His lands, including Buckland, were confiscated by the Parliamentarians but were recovered in 1653 by the Charles Dormer, 2nd Earl of Carnarvon and held until death in 1709. Through marriage it passed to Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield and remained in the family until George Hassall of Cholesbury acquired it around 1815.
