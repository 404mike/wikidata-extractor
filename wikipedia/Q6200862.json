Described by police detectives as \"extremely professional\" and \"extremely intimidating\", Moody's speciality was robbing armoured trucks and he used a chainsaw to saw through the side of security vehicles.Moody was born to a mother who was a wartime evacuee from Camberwell, London. His father was killed during World War II after his ship was torpedoed by a German U-boat.  Moody was an enforcer for the Richardsons and did freelance \"work\" for the Krays. He was considered by many of his peers to be \"the hardest man in London\". In the 1970s, he joined a team of criminals to form the Chainsaw Gang who went on to become that decade's most successful group of armed robbers.Moody was convicted, along with his brother Richard, of manslaughter in 1967 for the killing of William Day, a young merchant navy steward. He was released in 1972, but sent in 1979 on remand to Brixton Prison to await trial for armed robbery. His cellmate was Provisional IRA member Gerard Tuite. The two men and fellow-robber Stan Thompson escaped Brixton Prison on 16 December 1980, which put them to the top of Scotland Yard's most wanted list. It was alleged that Moody had been paid \u00a310,000 by the IRA to help get Tuite out of prison.Fleeing to Northern Ireland, Moody worked with the Provisional IRA. It was there that Moody coined the expression of \"awarding someone an OBE\" (\"one behind the ear\" - a shoot in the head), a play on an OBE Award. The expression was reportedly used by killers in Belfast for the next decade or so. Tuite was later arrested in Dublin.Still on the run, Moody returned to London in the late 1980s where he was now known as \"Mick the Irishman\". Now he was also wanted by the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the British security services.  He was shot dead on 1 June 1993 in the Royal Hotel (now Royal Inn on the Park) in Hackney, East London by an unknown assailant, who was described as being in his late forties and wearing a leather bomber jacket. The assailant fled in a stolen Ford Fiesta.Following his death, Moody was linked to multiple unsolved murders including that of gangster David Brindle in August 1991, of businessman Terry Gooderham and his girlfriend Maxine Arnold in Epping Forest, and that of a couple, the Dixons, walking the Pembrokeshire coast in June 1989 who were thought to have inadvertently unearthed a cache of Provisional IRA weapons.  There was speculation that he was involved in the murder of car dealer Nick Whiting, found in Rainham, Essex, in 1990.However, Pembrokeshire-based serial killer and rapist John Cooper was found guilty of the murder of the Dixons in May 2011.  The police were unable to establish what Moody had been doing since his return to England, nor who had arranged a council flat for him.  His flat was only traced three weeks after his death, by which time it had been completely emptied.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Richardson Gang", "response": ["Other members of the gang included the hitman Jimmy Moody, Roy Hall (who operated the electric generator), Bartholomew (Barry) Harris (who was the getaway driver for the gang), Albert Longman, Grandad Findley (South London Enforcer for the gang), Harry Rawlins, Alan Morse/Rigby, Frank Bailey, Harry Banks, Tommy Clark, Ron Large (Ronnie), Tommy Quinlan, James Kemmery and Mick O'Brien."]}, {"page": "Frankie Fraser", "response": ["It was in the early 1960s that Fraser first met Charlie and Eddie Richardson of the Richardson Gang, rivals to the Kray twins. According to Fraser, it was they who helped him avoid arrest for the Great Train Robbery by bribing a policeman. Together they set up the Atlantic Machines fruit-machine enterprise, which acted as a front for the criminal activities of the gang. In 1966, Fraser was charged with the murder of Richard Hart, who was shot at Mr Smith's club in Catford while other Richardson associates, including Jimmy Moody, were charged with affray. A witness changed his testimony and the charges were eventually dropped, though Fraser still received a five-year sentence for affray. He was also tried in court in the so-called 'Torture trial', in which members of the Richardson Gang were charged with burning, electrocuting and whipping those found guilty of disloyalty by a kangaroo court. Fraser himself was accused of pulling out the teeth of victims with a pair of pliers. Following a trial at the Old Bailey in 1967, he was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment."]}, {"page": "HM Prison Brixton", "response": ["* Jimmy Moody, a gangster and hitman escaped with Tuite in 1980."]}, {"page": "James Moody", "response": ["* Jimmy Moody (1941\u20131993), British gangster"]}, {"page": "Moody (surname)", "response": ["*Jimmy Moody (died 1993), English mobster"]}, {"page": "Gerard Tuite", "response": ["Tuite served his sentence in Brixton Prison until 16 December 1980 when, in one of the most daring prison break-outs witnessed in Britain he escaped with two British inmates, Jimmy Moody and Stan Thompson. Tuite and company escaped by tunnelling through walls of their cells in Brixton's top security remand wing and dropping into a yard where they used builders' planks and scaffolding piled up for repairs to scale the 15\u00a0ft perimeter wall.Rob Rodwell '27 Maze escapers still free' The Guardian, Monday 26 September 1983. Coming during a major IRA hunger strike this proved to be an enormous boost to the morale of the movement, and consequently his escape was deemed to be a political emergency.In his review of a biography of Moody, Anthony McIntyre who in December 1980 was an IRA prisoner, had this to say: \"When Gerard Tuite escaped in 1980 from Brixton prison it was a fillip for morale in the H Blocks. Seven men had passed the fifty-day stage of their hunger strike for political status and an end of some sort was imminent. Although Tuite was accompanied on the escape by two other remand prisoners, for the population of the H-Blocks Tuite's was the only name we cared for. He was the sole IRA escapee. The names of the other two men meant absolutely nothing to us. So concerned were we in the contentious crucible of the prison to assert our distinctive political motivation some in our number even wondered what Tuite was doing escaping alongside hoods. Most just envied him and hoped he would evade the security dragnet that would inevitably seek to pull him back inside.\"Anthony McIntyre on Tuite's escape, phoblacht.net; accessed 5 October 2015. The escape led the British police to immediately issue 16,500 posters of him under the heading \"Terrorist Alert. This Man Must Be Caught.\"'Rosie Cowan and Duncan Campbell, 'On the run \u2013 but where did they run to?'
