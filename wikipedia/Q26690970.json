Elections in Blackburn at that period involved some violence and intimidation. William himself represented Blackburn from 1857 to 1865, having been the first mayor in 1852 and failing to be elected in an 1853 by-election.

At the 1832 general election, he ran for the newly created constituency of Blackburn, \"almost like a bomb shell, offering himself to the Free and independent electors of both parties\". He made an election speech outside the Old Bull Hotel to a large crowd of working men, saying, \"Gentlemen, They said I wouldn\u2019t come; but I am come, and will be here at the day of the election. I'll stand the contest. It rains; it will wet you and will wet me. Good night. Give us three cheers.\" He then went into the inn and bought barrels of beer for the crowds.  Turner was elected as a Member of Parliament (MP) for Blackburn and held the seat until the 1841 general election, when he was defeated by the Conservative Party candidate John Hornby."]}]}}
