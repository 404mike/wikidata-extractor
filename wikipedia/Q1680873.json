He was awarded a Commonwealth Fund Fellowship which enabled him to continue his studies  at the University of Michigan where he earned his doctorate in 1931 under the direction of Stephen Timoshenko with a dissertation titled Compression of Rectangular Blocks, and the Bending of Beams by Nonlinear Distributions of Bending Forces.\nTimoshenko moved to Stanford University in 1936 and Goodier eventually succeeded him there.He was co-author of two classic books in this field:\"Theory of Elasticity,\" with Timoshenko, 1951; and \"Elasticity and Plasticity,\" with P. G.\nHodge, Jr., 1958 and was awarded the Timoshenko Medal by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 1961. He was chairman of the Applied Mechanics Division of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers from 1945 to 1946, and was elected Fellow of that Society in 1964. He had more than fifty doctoral students, one of whom was George F. Carrier.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Timoshenko Medal", "response": ["*1961 \u2013 James N.

Goodier (mechanical engineer and academic), Sir Morien Morgan (called the \"Father of Concorde\") and Beryl Platt, Baroness Platt (Conservative peer). He was also in contact with Russian railway engineer Yury Lomonosov and lectured to biochemist Albert Chibnall. Despite mentoring some of the best engineers of their generation Inglis was realistic about the actual intentions of many of his students at the time.  He once told a new intake class: \"Your fathers, gentlemen, have sent you to Cambridge to be educated, not to become engineers. They think, however, that reading engineering is a very good way of becoming educated. In 10 years' time, however, 90% of you will have become managers, whether of design, manufacturing, sales, research or even accounts departments in industry. The remaining 10% of you will have become successful lawyers, novelists, and things of that sort\". Undeterred, Inglis sought to give his students the broadest possible engineering education, covering all fields to prevent them becoming \"cramped by premature specialisation\"."]}, {"page": "George Westinghouse Award (ASEE)", "response": ["* 1946: James N.

The family moved to Suzhou, where they remained until the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War. In 1937, Hsu and his older brother moved to Chongqing, and Hsu enrolled at the Chongqing Institute of Technology. Upon graduating in 1945, Hsu served one year in the National Revolutionary Army, then worked at Shanghai Naval Dockyard and Engineering Works from 1946 to 1947. He left for Stanford University in the United States after becoming one of sixty students to win a nationwide contest for a scholarship. Hsu completed a master's degree in 1948, and a doctorate advised by James N. Goodier in 1950. From 1951 to 1958, Hsu was an engineer at IBM. He began teaching at the University of Toledo in 1955, leaving for the University of California, Berkeley in 1958. In 1964, Hsu was named full professor at Berkeley, and awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship. He was elected a fellow of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 1977. Subsequently, Hsu was elected a member of the United States National Academy of Engineering in 1988, \"[f]or the development of innovative techniques, especially cell-to-cell mapping, and for the analysis of the dynamics of nonlinear systems.\" A year before his retirement in 1991, Hsu was elected a member of Academia Sinica."]}]}}
