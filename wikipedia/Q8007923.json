Two Dukes, Hamilton and Lennox, challenged this claim, but it was confirmed by an Order of the Privy Council in 1669.\nThis Lord Mordington was responsible for the rebuild of the wall and stone entrance to the burial vault containing Black Agnes.\nThe 2nd Lord Mordington appears to have been in debt, doubtless due to the prevailing wartime scenario in Scotland, and the disruption to agriculture, and there are a great many papers in the National Archives of Scotland in this respect. An example (GD206/1/47) is a Great Seal charter of confirmation of a bond, dated 23 September 1667, by William, Lord Mordingtoun, to William Dowglas, advocate, for \u00a32000 Scots and an annual rent of \u00a3120 Scots from the lands and barony of Chirnside and teinds thereof in the parish of Chirnsyde and sheriffdom of Berwick.\nConfirmation in the register is dated 7 July 1671, by which time Lord Mordington is thought to have died.\nHe married Elizabeth, daughter of Hugh Sempill, 5th Lord Sempill, and had the following issue:\n\nJames Douglas, 3rd Lord Mordington (b.1651), his son and heir.\nWilliam (b.1653).\nLewis (d. 7 July 1682, Westminster, London, England).\nFrancis (b.1655).\nAnne, married c1690 Patrick Porterfield in Comiston.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1626", "response": ["* September 27 \u2013 William Douglas, 2nd Lord Mordington, eldest son and heir of Sir James Douglas (d. 1671)"]}, {"page": "William Douglas", "response": ["*William Douglas, 2nd Lord Mordington (1626\u2013?)"]}, {"page": "Edrington", "response": ["Patrick Scott and James Winraham, who held wadsets (mortgages) over Edrington, resigned \"the lands of Edrington\", with fishings etc., and \"the manor-place\" [castle], on 16 June 1661 by sale, recorded in the Great Seal of Scotland, to James, Master of Mordington, \"eldest lawful son of William Douglas, 2nd Lord Mordington, and his heirs male, whom failing to William Douglas his next younger brother and his heirs male, whom failing to Francis Douglas his second brother\" etc."]}, {"page": "James Douglas, 3rd Lord Mordington", "response": ["James Douglas, 3rd Lord Mordington (born 1651), succeeded his father William Douglas, 2nd Lord Mordington,", "It is recorded in The Great Seal of Scotland (charter number 294) confirmed at Edinburgh on 2 August 1662, that James Douglas, Master of Mordington, eldest son of William Douglas, 2nd Lord Mordington, acquired the estates of Nether Mordington, as well as Edrington and its castle, which occupied the lower half of the parish. In the National Archives of Scotland (GD206/6/20) are Legal papers relative to the 20 merklands of Over and Nether Mordington in parish of Mordington, regality of Dalkeith and sheriffdom of Berwickshire, dated 1671 \u2013 1710.", "An Inventory of the Writs in the National Archives (GD206/6/153) produced for Walter Harper in process of reduction and improbation pursued by Robert Rochead of Masterton are against the creditors of [Lord] Mordington with the Writs (legal papers), dated 1706.

The first parish church of which there is reasonable record stood on high ground known as the Kirk Park, near Mordington House, above the ancient bullock-track which dissected the parish from the Whiteadder to Lamberton Common. Apart from the tarmac, this single-lane road is the same today. In 1275 the vicar at Mordington refused to pay the crusader's tithe, and his successor, Bernard de Linton, swore allegiance to King Edward I on 24 August 1296.  It mysteriously burnt down in 1757 and a new church was erected on the Duns road on what became known as the Minister's Glebe. Both of these churches had burial grounds attached to them, and the latter has survived. Little remains of the original churchyard, although in 1662 William Douglas, 2nd Lord Mordington erected a new doorway to an ancient burial vault which is still extant. The parish was long united to Longformacus, but was disjoined in 1666. In 1870 a new church was erected a quarter of a mile uphill from the 2nd church. It was Gothic and cruciform. It too had a churchyard, which is still in use. This church was quickly demolished circa 1989 when the Duns Presbytery refused to pay less than \u00a310,000 for essential roof repairs."]}, {"page": "James Douglas, 1st Lord Mordington", "response": ["* William Douglas, 2nd Lord Mordington, his son and heir."]}]}}
