On 15 December 2008, Turner took over as caretaker-manager at Hartlepool following the departure of Danny Wilson, in addition to his Director of Sport role at the club. He then led Hartlepool to a 19th-place finish in League One at the end of the 2008\u201309 season, two places and one point above the relegation zone. Speaking in January 2010, Turner responded to criticism from supporters by saying that \"people have to realise to get into the top six is very difficult for the majority of clubs in this division\". Pools ended the 2009\u201310 campaign above the relegation zone on goal difference after being deducted three points for fielding an ineligible player as Gary Liddle played against Brighton & Hove Albion when he should have served a suspension. On 19 August 2010, Turner resigned from his position at Hartlepool. He had previously stated his frustration at what he said was a lack of funds to sign players.
