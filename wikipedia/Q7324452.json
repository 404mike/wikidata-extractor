He had brief loan spells at Kidderminster Harriers and Worcester City in the second half of the 1999\u20132000 season, before joining Southern League Division One West team Bromsgrove Rovers. He returned to the English Football League with Port Vale in April 2001, but failed to make an impression and was allowed to return to the non-league scene with Nuneaton Borough in January 2002. He went back to Bromsgrove Rovers for the 2002\u201303 season, and later had spells with Redditch United, Halesowen Town, Stourport Swifts, Bewdley Town and Bromyard Town.

Horton came under pressure from the board at the start of the 2000\u201301 campaign, as his team went 13 games without a win, and were knocked out of the FA Cup by non-League Canvey Island. Horton described it as \"the greatest embarrassment of my football career\". He responded to this humiliation by placing five players on the transfer list. He signed Steve Brooker for \u00a315,000; brought in Onandi Lowe and Richard Burgess on free transfer, whilst also offloading Jeff Minton to Rotherham United. Vale's form improved, as they avoided defeat to Stoke City in both Potteries derby games. Horton was named Manager of the Month in March, after a good run of results ended fears of a second successive relegation. He also won his first trophy as a manager as Vale lifted the Football League Trophy, coming from behind to beat Brentford at the Millennium Stadium. Vale upset supporters by selling Dave Brammer to Crewe Alexandra for \u00a3500,000."]}, {"page": "Richard Burgess", "response": ["Richard Burgess may refer to:", "*Richard Burgess (murderer) (1829\u20131866), murderer in New Zealand", "*Richard Burgess (footballer) (born 1974), English soccer player", "*Richard Burgess (biblical scholar)  (1796\u20131881), archaeologist and biblical scholar"]}, {"page": "1997\u201398 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Richard Burgess"]}, {"page": "1999\u20132000 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|29||align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Richard Burgess"]}, {"page": "2000\u201301 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["The season opened with a disappointing 4\u20131 defeat at Boundary Park to Oldham Athletic, though the Vale then recovered to record two 3\u20130 victories.

During this run the Vale renewed hostilities with rivals Stoke City, recording a 1\u20131 draw at Burslem on 17 September. Their form stabilized with a four-game unbeaten run throughout November, but then no points were gained from any of the four December games. Horton attempted to sign Isaiah Rankin on loan from Bradford City, but Bill Bell rejected the move as he felt the wage bill was already too high. In January, young striker Steve Brooker was signed from Watford for a \u00a315,000 fee. Jamaican international striker Onandi Lowe also arrived on a short-team deal, and Wayne Gray joined on loan from Wimbledon. Vale then found their feet in February, and managed to avoid defeat to Stoke at the Britannia Stadium, as they lost just three of their final 21 league games. In March, Jeff Minton was transferred to Rotherham United, and Ashley Dodd arrived at Vale Park on loan from Manchester United. The next month Richard Burgess also joined the club after leaving Bromsgrove Rovers. A cup run and numerous fixture postponements meant the club were forced to play eight games in April, of which only two ended in defeat; for this achievement Horton was named Manager of the Month.
