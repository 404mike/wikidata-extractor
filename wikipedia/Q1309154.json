As there was no one at the school competent enough to advance Parry's studies in composition, he turned to George Elvey, the organist of St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, and began studies with him sometime in 1863.Dibble, pp. 22\u201325 Elvey was musically conservative, preferring Handel to Mendelssohn, and though Parry initially idolised his teacher,Dibble, pp. 24\u201325 he eventually realised how unadventurous he was compared to S.\u00a0S. Wesley.Dibble, pp. 36\u201337 Parry nonetheless benefited from Elvey's tuition and gained the advantage of being able to write anthems for the choir of St George's Chapel, which under Elvey's direction had reached a standard exceptional in English choral singing of that time. Elvey started his pupil on the contrapuntal disciplines of canon and fugue;Dibble, p. 25 recognising his pupil's talent, he soon became ambitious to train him to a standard sufficient to earn the music degree at Oxford. He therefore introduced his student to the string quartets of Haydn and Mozart,Dibble, p. 34 and ultimately to some of the rudiments of orchestration.Dibble, p. 37 Meanwhile, Parry, on his own initiative, explored the orchestral scores of Beethoven, Weber, and his beloved Mendelssohn. While still at Eton, Parry successfully sat the Oxford Bachelor of Music examination, the youngest person who had ever done so.

Under his guidance, Stainer became the youngest ever successful candidate for the Bachelor of Music degree at Oxford.Dibble, p. 52. For this, Stainer wrote a cantata, Praise the Lord, O my soul, with text from Psalm 103. Its traditional style was designed to appeal to the examining board and sounds stilted when set against his later works.Dibble, p. 52.
