He joined Everton in 2007, helping them reach the 2009 FA Cup Final. He played for England at under-21 and senior levels. Baines was included in the England squads at UEFA Euro 2012 and the 2014 FIFA World Cup. He announced his retirement from football on 26 July 2020, going on to integrate into coaching. Baines currently occupies a dual role at Everton, serving as the interim assistant manager of Everton U18s and as a Professional Development Coach for the Everton Academy.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "December 11", "response": ["*1984 \u2013 Leighton Baines, English footballer"]}, {"page": "Everton F.C.", "response": ["|Leighton Baines", "|Leighton Baines", "* 2010\u201311  Leighton Baines", "* 2012\u201313  Leighton Baines"]}, {"page": "Kirkby", "response": ["*Leighton Baines \u2013 Former Everton player, formerly of Wigan Athletic"]}, {"page": "Formby", "response": ["*Leighton Baines"]}, {"page": "David Moyes", "response": ["It was the 2007\u201308 season that Everton displayed the most consistency and stability since Moyes arrived at the club, finally ending the cycle of alternating between the top and bottom halves of the league. In his sixth full season in charge, Moyes secured fifth place in the league and reached the semi-final of the Football League Cup as well as the last 16 of the UEFA Cup, eventually being beaten on penalties by Fiorentina. Moyes also signed four more players who went on to become very important players for Everton: Yakubu was signed for another record fee of \u00a311.25\u00a0million, Steven Pienaar for \u00a32.05\u00a0million after an initial loan, Phil Jagielka was brought in for \u00a34\u00a0million, and Leighton Baines was signed for a fee that could rise to \u00a36\u00a0million. All of this gave Everton and its fans cause for optimism as a string of strong performances broke the pattern inconsistency which saw league finishes of 15th, 7th, 17th, 4th and 11th under Moyes. His reputation as a disciplinarian could be seen to manifest in Everton's yellow card count.

On 1 June 2010, he was named in the final 23-man selection by manager Fabio Capello, ahead of other left back Leighton Baines.

On 7 June 2010, he played in a friendly match against Platinum Stars before the tournament.

In March 2008, Edman was injured in a match against Blackburn Rovers, damaging his anterior crutiate ligament in his knee. This means he missed the rest of Wigan's season, as well as Euro 2008. Edman made his return to the Wigan team, as a substitute in January 2009 at Old Trafford, as Wigan lost 1\u20130 to Manchester United.

He was only able to make 5 appearances as Wigan were promoted, and he lost his place to the young Leighton Baines. McMillan only made two league appearances for Wigan in their debut Premiership season, against Charlton and Fulham.
