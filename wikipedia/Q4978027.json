Both of the Parkinson sons are seen making fun of their father's traditional post-war reserved British attitude, whilst also facing their own issues such as unemployment, girlfriend troubles, cannabis use against the wishes of their horrified father, and teenage pregnancy, when Russell fathers a child with his on-off girlfriend. Bruce Montague plays Ria's friend Leonard, a successful businessman aged 44, whose wife has recently left him; he, like Ria, is approaching a mid-life crisis.

She is disgusted to learn that Reenie's husband Pete Buchanan (Kai Owen) has been sexually abusing her teenage niece Cleo McQueen (Nadine Rose Mulkerrin), and comforts Reenie when she reveals that she too was repeatedly raped as a child by Nana's abusive ex-partner, Derek Clough (Bruce Montague). In March 2016, Myra is furious to learn that John Paul's transgender boss, Sally St. Claire (Annie Wallace), has sacked him, so behind his back she confronts her. However, she recognises Sally as her ex-boyfriend, Iain Naismith, who is also John Paul's father. She is adamant not to allow Sally to reveal her identity to John Paul, and after a heated argument, Sally agrees that it is for the best not to say anything. When the truth comes out during a showdown with Pete, John Paul refuses to speak to Myra or Sally. However, he slowly warms to Sally when he finds and reads a letter from her which should have been given to him when he was a child, and becomes more hostile towards Myra for withholding it. She later demands that Sally pay for all the years of child maintenance that she missed out on for John Paul, which Sally agrees to but Myra storms off. When Sally catches up with her, she attacks Sally, which results in Myra falling down the stairs at the school. She is rushed to hospital, and it transpires that Sally pushed Myra down the stairs in self-defence. Celine McQueen (Sarah George) then breaks the news to Myra that she is pregnant with Diego's baby.

Sexual abuse is a crime that rips apart families and I am very pleased with the way that Hollyoaks has thoughtfully approached an enormously emotive and challenging subject. Sexual abuse of children within families is disturbingly the most common form and the impact on victims is devastating, sometimes damaging them long into adulthood if they don't get the right support. Children can stay silent for fear of what speaking out will do to the relationships they have with other members of the family. Abusers may cynically use this fear to keep children silent, leaving them suffering a daily nightmare. Its important children know that help is out there and they can move forward positively.\" Hollyoaks' executive producer, Bryan Kirkwood spoke about how viewers should be aware that Nana McQueen (Diane Langton) suffered sexual abuse within her family, and how the research that the Hollyoaks team did found that abuse can in fact infiltrate generations. He continued to speak about what he hopes to achieve: \"Her daughter Reenie is as much the victim here as her daughters in that her own childhood was filled with such unclear boundaries that she is unable to spot the markers that mean her own girls are at risk. But this is not a hopeless story \u2013 far from it. It will endeavour to show that we do have the power to stop abuse and most importantly that it is possible to recover and to go on and have a happy and successful life. The campaign 'no secrets' is a simple message that can be used to encourage adults not to ask children to keep secrets and let children know that they shouldn't have secrets either. It is the secrets kept by generations of this family that have led to what we will see play out on screen this year.\" It was then revealed that Nana's ex-partner, Derek Clough (Bruce Montague), was her real father as Reenie was raped by him."]}, {"page": "List of Hollyoaks characters (2015)", "response": ["Ben Bradley's drug-addicted daughter Carly Bradley (Sophie Wise) made her first appearance in July, as did Angela Brown (Adele Silva), her husband, Mark (Ben Faulks) and con artist Wayne (Nathan Whitfield).
