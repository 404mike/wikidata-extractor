Although Monash University was founded to focus primarily on science and technology, it would inevitably establish a law school.Peter Balmford, \"Foundation of the Monash Law School\", Monash University Law Review, vol. 15, 1989, p. 139  The need was not considered pressing enough to make a law school a foundation faculty of the new university; however, when Melbourne Law School imposed quotas on law school candidates due to a lack of resources, a new law school was immediately needed to cater for the extra students.  The Victorian Council of Legal Education, the Chief Justice of Victoria and the Victorian Government pushed for the overnight establishment of a law school at Monash University, but this was resisted by the University's Vice-Chancellor, Sir Louis Matheson, who wanted a high quality, well-planned, original faculty of law.  In the end, it was over a relatively short period of time \u2013 5 months from October 1963 to March 1964 \u2013 that a  first-year law school curriculum was established and two teaching staff were appointed. However, when students first arrived in 1964, they did so with the knowledge that the curriculum for their later years was still being written.  A law library was established with impressive speed, after substantial book donations from two former justices of the Supreme Court of Victoria. Appropriately for a law school, the Faculty's establishment was delayed by a dispute over the interpretation of the Monash University Act, concerning when and how the University Council could set up new faculties. Following debate between Monash University, the Crown Solicitor and the Parliamentary Draftsmen, the Act was eventually amended."]}, {"page": "Monash University, Clayton campus", "response": ["The campus has three major academic libraries: the Louis Matheson Library (for arts and commerce), the Hargrave-Andrew Library (for engineering, science and technology) and the Law Library.

Darling learned that Harold Holt's government intended to replace him in an article in The Age. According to insiders, Holt's government was unhappy with the ABC's current events shows which appeared to take a contrary position on their policies. Madgwick was chosen as Darling's replacement, reportedly because he was considered unidentified with any political party and was widely respected. Gorton approached Madgwick in late May 1967, offered him the position, and gave him one day to reply to the offer. Madgwick asked the advice of Louis Matheson and Philip Baxter of the Vice-Chancellor's Committee. Then, he checked with his daughter Mary, who worked in the ABC's education department, if she would be \"embarrassed\" to have her father as chairman. The next day Madgwick informed Gorton and Alan Hulme, the Postmaster-General who governed the ABC, that he would accept the position.Inglis, pp.\u00a0322\u2013323"]}, {"page": "Matheson (surname)", "response": ["*Louis Matheson, British-Australian academic"]}, {"page": "Newport Power Station", "response": ["The union leadership agreed to a compromise that a panel led by Louis Matheson would investigate the proposed plant. Matheson was considered unsympathetic to the campaign against the plant, because he had risen to national prominence as Vice-Chancellor of Monash University in the late 1960s, during a time of widespread student protest there. The panel's findings were mixed. Its interim report stated that even a  plant at Newport would do unacceptable environmental damage, but its final report in April 1977 endorsed the plant, but with only one  generator unit. There were claims that some panel members changed their votes at the last minute under political pressure. The campaign continued at the grassroots level, but the trade union leadership refused to seriously enforce construction bans. As a result, protesters invaded Trades Hall Council meetings, demanding enforcement of the bans. Protesters clashed with police at the construction site, while campaign meetings continued to draw hundreds of workers and residents. Nonetheless, with the union leadership refusing to enforce a picket or construction ban, construction went ahead.

The first University Council, led by Monash's first Chancellor Sir Robert Blackwood, selected a British professor of engineering, Sir Louis Matheson, to be the first Vice-Chancellor of Monash University, a position he held until 1976. The University was granted an expansive site of 115 hectares of land at Clayton, after it had argued that, in the distant future, it was possible that Monash would have up to 12,000 students.", "In its early years of teaching, research and administration, Monash had the advantage of no entrenched traditional practices. This enabled it to adopt modern approaches without resistance from those who preferred the status quo. Matheson had also deliberately selected young, talented staff to fuel the rapid rise of the University. A modern administrative structure was set up, Australia's first research centres and scholarships devoted to Indigenous Australians were established, and, thanks to Monash's entirely new facilities, students in wheelchairs were able to enroll. By contrast, Melbourne University struggled to enter the modern educational era, to the point that there was talk of a Royal Commission to overcome its antiquated style. In other respects, however, the youth of Monash was a burden. While Louis Matheson had good relations with government, Monash in the 1960s existed in a city where almost all professionals had attended Melbourne University.  This meant that many officials and heads of professional bodies were \"unsympathetic\" to Monash's requests. For example, it was many years before the Faculty of Medicine received funding for Monash Medical Centres to complement its teaching and research.", "* Sir Louis Matheson, Still learning, South Melbourne, Macmillan, 1980"]}, {"page": "Australian knights and dames", "response": ["| Louis Matheson"]}, {"page": "1972 New Year Honours", "response": ["* Professor James Adam Louis Matheson, , Vice-Chancellor, Monash University."]}, {"page": "1976 Birthday Honours", "response": ["*James Adam Louis Matheson, C.M.G., M.B.E., of South Yarra.
