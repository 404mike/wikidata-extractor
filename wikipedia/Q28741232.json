After releasing tapes of experimental, industrial music as Migraine Inducers he formed Eyeless In Gaza with Peter Becker in January 1980. The duo became known for their unconventional instrumentation and arrangements, and for Bates\u2019s passionate vocals, which at times were whispered, howled, or stammered. Eyeless In Gaza released six albums on Cherry Red Records.  These were Photographs as Memories (1981), Caught in Flux (1981), Pale Hands I Loved So Well (1982), Drumming the Beating Heart (1982), Rust Red September (1983) and Back from the Rains, and then went on hiatus until 1992.\nPicking up from 1982\u2019s acclaimed Letters Written (1982) solo album, Bates then concentrated mostly on solo work for a while, going on to collaborate with Anne Clark (Just After Sunset 1998) \u2013 also starting the short-lived bands Cry Acetylene Angel, Hungry I, and The Sing Circus (with This Mortal Coil \u2019s Deirdre Rutkowski). He contributed to Derek Jarman's soundtracks The Garden and The Last of England. Then he temporarily relocated his main focus to Europe, releasing three solo albums on the Belgian based Antler Subway label \u2013 Love Smashed on a Rock (1988), Letters to a Scattered Family (1990) and Stars Come Trembling (1990), which musically offered initial glimpses of the acoustic folk roots of his youth.In 1993, Bates began working with former Napalm Death drummer Mick Harris, collaborating on a three album series of Murder Ballads, creating an innovative  marriage of \u201cisolationist\u201d ambience with folk-song form. In the same time frame Bates created a virtually acapella work \u2013 a two volume series of \u201csong-settings\u201d of James Joyce's chamber music Chamber Music cycle of 36 poems (released in 1994 and 1996).\nFrom 1992 onwards, Bates has run a parallel career recording and performing with a re-vitalised Eyeless In Gaza \u2013 with Eyeless deftly blending song with collaged soundscaping - while Bates otherwise continues to develop his own intense and possibly autobiographical solo work.\nBates\u2019s solo outings of particular note include the albums Imagination Feels Like Poison (1997), Arriving Fire (2014), and I Said To Love (2018). As Twelve Thousand Days, since 2000 Bates has also worked with Orchis/Temple Music/Nurse With Wound collaborator Alan Trench - producing five albums of \u201cchannelled wyrd folk, psych-musics & other curios\u201d, including the forthcoming album Field\u2019s End (2020).\nBates is the author of five books of \u201clyrics to songs heard and unheard, and other gathered miscellany\u201d.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Barleycorn", "response": ["Many versions of the song have been recorded, including a popular version by the rock group Traffic, appearing on their 1970 album John Barleycorn Must Die.

Most closely identified with the city's Downwards Records label and its local producers Regis, Surgeon and Female, Birmingham techno's characteristic hard, fast and uncompromising style was influenced as much by the local industrial music scene that developed around Mick Harris of Napalm Death and Martyn Bates of Eyeless in Gaza as it was by the pioneers of American techno. Downwards would become one of the most important labels in world techno, and the \"darkly reductionist\" influence of its \"huge slabs of unrelentingly unchanging minimalism\" would be unmistakable in the development of the later techno scenes in New York City and at the Berghain in Berlin."]}, {"page": "48 Cameras", "response": ["48 Cameras, often referred simply as 48C, is a musical and international collective in a format that varies according to circumstances.
