The Fairchild Family tells the story of a family striving towards godliness and consists of a series of lessons taught by the Fairchild parents to their three children (Emily, Lucy and Henry) regarding not only the proper orientation of their souls towards Heaven but also the right earthly morality (envy, greed, lying, disobedience, and fighting are immoral). The overarching narrative of the tale includes a series of tract-like stories which illustrate these moral lessons. For example, stories of the deaths of two neighbourhood children, Charles Trueman and Miss Augusta Noble, help the Fairchild children to understand how and why they need to look to the state of their own hearts.Vallone, p. 84. The faithful and \"true\" Charles has a transcendent deathbed experience, suggesting he is saved; by contrast, the heedless, disobedient Augusta burns up while playing with candles and is presumably damned.Vallone, p. 86. Unlike previous allegorical literature with these themes, such as Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, Sherwood domesticated her story\u2014actions in the children's day-to-day lives, such as stealing fruit. These are supremely important because they relate directly to their salvation.Cutt, p. 66.

They reflected more conventional Victorian plots and themes. For example, Gipsy Babes (1826), perhaps inspired by Walter Scott's Guy Mannering (1815), emphasizes \"human affections.\"Cutt, p. 87. In 1835 came a Gothic novel for adolescents entitled Shanty the Blacksmith; it employs all the tropes of the genre \u2014 \"lost heir, ruined castle, humble helpers and faithful retainer, sinister and mysterious gypsies, prisoner and plot\" \u2013 in what Cutt calls \"a gripping\" and \"exciting tale.\"Cutt, p. 89. In 1835 Sherwood published the novel Caroline Mordaunt, telling of a young woman forced to become a governess. Her parents die when she is young, but luckily relatives pay to educate her, so that she can earn her own living. It follows her progress from a flighty, discontented girl to a reliable, content woman; she learns to accommodate herself to the whims of a proud nobility, silly literati, and dogmatic evangelicals. She realizes that in her dependent position she must be content with less than complete happiness. Once she recognizes this, though, she finds God, and in the last chapter an ideal husband, so granting her near-complete happiness after all.
