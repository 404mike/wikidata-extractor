The sisters, Jane and Ann Taylor and their authorship of various works have often been confused, in part because their early ones were published together. Ann Taylor's son, Josiah Gilbert, wrote in her biography, \"Two little poems \u2013 'My Mother,' and 'Twinkle, twinkle, little Star' \u2013 are perhaps more frequently quoted than any; the first, a lyric of life, was by Ann, the second, of nature, by Jane; and they illustrate this difference between the sisters.\"\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
