A regular under Martin Foyle, he also spent the 2006\u201307 season at Vale Park, where he and Tony Dinning became the old heads at the centre of the park. Sonner was popular with the fans and in fact played more games for the club than he did for any other club. However, at the age of 35, Sonner rejected Vale's contract offer, claiming that offer was too low paying. He said: \"I deserve a rise and a decent offer. The club wants me to play for next to nothing. If they carry on paying Conference wages, then the club is going nowhere. They talk about promotion, but don't want to keep players.\" Chairman Bill Bratt responded by saying that: \"The manager had faith in Danny to pluck him from Peterborough reserves and to offer him another contract with better terms... if he thinks he is on next to nothing he should try working in the pottery industry for 40 hours a week for \u00a3200.\""]}, {"page": "Ian Brightwell", "response": ["He returned to the third tier when he joined Gu\u00f0j\u00f3n \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson's Stoke City in March 2002.
