He served as minister plenipotentiary at Brussels 1791, at Warsaw 1793, and as commander in chief of the forces at Nova Scotia and New Brunswick (1805-1806).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Arthur White", "response": ["William's mother was Elizabeth Lila Gardiner (1798\u20131849), the daughter of British soldier William Neville Gardiner (1748\u20131806) and his second wife Lucy O'Moore (died 1849). Gardiner served in the Foreign Office twice as the Minister in Warsaw, in 1784 and 1794. Following William Gardiner's death in Nova Scotia in 1806, Lucy and her daughter continued to live in Poland. They first lived on the estate G\u00f3ra Pu\u0142awska, and later held under lease the estate Wysock, the country residence of the Czartoryski family. It is likely that Gardiner had formed an arrangement with the Czartoryskis in which they would provide protection for his widow and daughter. The Czartoryskis played a large part in the upbringing of Elizabeth. The family owned considerable estates in Poland."]}]}}
