In Paris Shanks became influenced by the paintings of \u00c9douard Manet. His painting Tiddley Winks was exhibited at the Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts in 1897 and at one time was owned by Eliot Hodgkin who sold it to art dealer Charlotte Frank, the aunt of Anne Frank; Sir David Montagu Douglas Scott obtained it from her in 1962 for \u00a360. On loan to the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge from 2007 to 2008, it sold at Sotheby's in 2008 for \u00a3181,250, a record for the artist.
