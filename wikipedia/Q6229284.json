After a tough one point win over Fermanagh in the first round of the Ulster Championship, Tyrone then went on to give their best performance of 2007 by blitzing the National League Champions Donegal at St Tiernach's Park in Clones on a scoreline of 2\u201315 to 1\u20137. The highlight of this match was a 5-point haul by captain Brian Dooher in possibly his best performance in a Tyrone jersey. The final against Monaghan was a wonderful occasion as Clones played host once again to the Ulster Senior Football final after the 04,05,06 finals were at Croke Park in Dublin. The match itself was an up and down affair Tyrone raced into an early 1\u20135 to 0\u20131 lead their goal coming for left half back Phillip Jordan but Monaghan fought back to trail 1\u20138 to 0\u20137 at half time. The Second half then started much like the first with Tyrone extending their lead to 1\u201313 to 0\u20138, A Tomas Freeman goal spurred a Monaghan fight back with the score at 1\u201313 to 1\u201310 Sean Cavanagh opened up for Tyrone at wing half forward then scored a point to put 4 between the sides a Monagan free meant there was only a kick of a ball between the sides when Vincent Coreys shot was saved by keeper John Devine"]}, {"page": "Pascal McConnell", "response": ["McConnell competed with John Devine and Niall Morgan to be first choice goalkeeper for Tyrone.
