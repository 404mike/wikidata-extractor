Although he gained the name of the \u2018Manchester Wilson\u2019, his works in oil are opaque, flat, and ineffective. His works in watercolour, though in the light and washed style then practised, are well drawn and interesting. The British Museum possesses three of his watercolour drawings, all of which are landscapes with figures, and there is a cleverly drawn landscape by him in grey faded tints at South Kensington. There is a landscape in oils in the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool, by Rathbone, and two hang in the Peel Park Art Gallery, Salford. Between 1785 and 1806 Rathbone exhibited forty-eight landscapes at the Royal Academy and two at the Society of Artists. He also exhibited three landscapes at the exhibition of the Society of Artists in Liverpool in August 1774. Rathbone died in 1807.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Liverpool Academy of Arts", "response": ["Its membership included local artists such as the landscapists John Rathbone, Richard Ansdell, Thomas Chubbard, Alfred William Hunt and Charles Barber, and the sculptor John Gibson."]}, {"page": "Charles Towne (artist)", "response": ["Towne was born in Wigan, the son of Richard Town, a portrait-painter from Liverpool, and his wife Mary.
