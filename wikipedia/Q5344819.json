He was elected fellow of Balliol in the same year. In 1827 he went to Delgany, co. Wicklow, where for a year he tutored the sons of Edward Pennefather and fell under the influence of Pennefather's brother-in-law, the Rev John Nelson Darby, one of the nascent group of Plymouth Brethren, who he describes in Phases of Faith as \"the Irish Clergyman\". Conscientious scruples respecting the ceremony of infant baptism led him to resign his fellowship in 1830, and he went to Baghdad as assistant in the faith mission of Anthony Norris Groves. This journey, which included wives, a baby in arms, and an elderly woman, has been described as \"a mad jaunt whose real tragedy \u2014 two of the wives died and the men of the party were many times near death \u2014 is blurred by silly incompetence and downright nonsense of most of its members.\"Lionel Trilling, \"Matthew Arnold\", W.W. Norton Company, 1939, p. 169 In 1833 he returned to England to procure additional support for the mission, but rumours of unsoundness in his views on the doctrine of eternal punishment had preceded him, and finding himself generally looked upon with suspicion, he gave up the vocation of missionary to become classical tutor in an unsectarian college at Bristol. His letters written home during the period of his mission were collected and published in 1856."]}, {"page": "Whig government, 1830\u20131834", "response": ["| Edward Pennefather"]}, {"page": "King's Inns", "response": ["|1846\u20131847 Edward Pennefather, LCJ", "|1880\u20131881 Edward Pennefather, QC"]}, {"page": "Solicitor-General for Ireland", "response": ["*Edward Pennefather: 27 January 1835 \u2013 1835", "*Edward Pennefather 21 September 1841 \u2013 1841"]}, {"page": "Attorney-General for Ireland", "response": ["* Edward Pennefather: 23 December 1830"]}, {"page": "First Peel ministry", "response": ["| Edward Pennefather"]}, {"page": "Second Peel ministry", "response": ["| Edward Pennefather"]}, {"page": "Frederick Stopford", "response": ["He was a younger son of James Stopford, 4th Earl of Courtown, and his second wife Dora Pennefather, daughter of Edward Pennefather, Lord Chief Justice of Ireland."]}]}}
