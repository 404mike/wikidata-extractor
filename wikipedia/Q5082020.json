He had served with the 2nd battalion in the Bermuda Garrison before the war, arriving on the Western Front with that battalion 6 November 1914.\nHe was an Acting Corporal in the 2nd Battalion, Lincolnshire Regiment, British Army and 26 years old when the following deed took place during the Battle of Aubers Ridge in First World War for which he was awarded the VC.\nOn 9 May 1915 at Rouges Bancs, France, Corporal Sharpe was in charge of a blocking party sent forward to take a portion of the German trench. He was the first to reach the enemy's position and using bombs with great effect he himself cleared them out of a trench 50 yards (46 m) long. By this time all his party had fallen and he was then joined by four other men with whom he attacked the enemy with bombs and captured a further trench 250 yards (230 m) long.He later achieved the rank of Company Sergeant Major. He left the army in 1928.\nOn return to civilian life, he worked at a number of jobs, notably as a physical training instructor to boys at the Hereward Camp approved school at Bourne.  In World War II a number of bombs were dropped on the approved school, a row of wooden huts adjacent to Bourne Woods that may have been mistaken for a military camp; Sharpe was injured.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lincolnshire", "response": ["* Charles Richard Sharpe (1889\u20131963), Victoria Cross recipient"]}, {"page": "List of English Victoria Cross recipients", "response": ["|Charles Richard Sharpe ||British Army || 1915 || First World War || Rouges Bancs"]}, {"page": "Royal Lincolnshire Regiment", "response": ["* Acting Corporal Charles Richard Sharpe, First World War (9 May 1915)"]}, {"page": "Sharpe (surname)", "response": ["* Charles Richard Sharpe, English recipient of the Victoria Cross"]}, {"page": "Charles Sharpe", "response": ["*Charles Richard Sharpe (1889\u20131963), English recipient of the Victoria Cross"]}, {"page": "List of people from Lincolnshire", "response": ["* Charles Richard Sharpe (1889-1963), Victoria Cross recipient"]}]}}
