(Others included Ernest Satow and W. G. Aston.) He also wrote some of the earliest translations of haiku into English. He is perhaps best remembered for his informal and popular one-volume encyclopedia Things Japanese, which first appeared in 1890 and which he revised several times thereafter. His interests were diverse, and his works include an anthology of poetry in French.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ainu people", "response": ["*Basil Hall Chamberlain, Language, Mythology and Geographical Nomenclature of Japan viewed in the Light of Aino Studies and Aino Fairy-tales (1895)"]}, {"page": "February 15", "response": ["*1935 \u2013 Basil Hall Chamberlain, English-Swiss historian, author, and academic (b. 1850)"]}, {"page": "Haiku", "response": ["Although there were further attempts outside Japan to imitate the \"hokku\" in the early 20th century, there was little understanding of its principles.

It was in Japan, however, that he found a home and his greatest inspiration.

During his fifteen-month stay in Matsue, Hearn married Koizumi Setsuko, the daughter of a local samurai family, with whom he had four children: Kazuo, Iwao, Kiyoshi, and Suzuko.Kazuo, Iwao, Kiyoshi, and Suzuko: Katharine Chubbuck, 'Hearn, (Patricio) Lafcadio Carlos (1850\u20131904)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 He became a Japanese citizen, assuming the legal name Koizumi Yakumo in 1896 after accepting a teaching position in Tokyo; Koizumi is his wife's surname and Yakumo is from yakumotatsu, a poetic modifier word (makurakotoba) for Izumo Province, which means \"where many clouds grow\".

The report mentioned major peaks, but the topography was mostly guesswork. From 1891, foreign travelers were able to find useful information in Basil Hall Chamberlain and W.\u00a0B. Mason's Handbook for Travellers in Japan. However, for decades, the Japanese were climbing these mountains without a comparable guidebook. Japanese people did physical exploration over a decade in the 1890s. They divided the mountains into (north, central, and south) depending on how they were conventionally grouped. William Gowland, an English geologist, first thought of this swath of terrain as forming a single coherent landscape, comparable to the European Alps. Gowland's view was further developed by another Englishman and Christian missionary, Walter Weston, who was able \u201cto canonize Gowland's geographical conception, deploying it as a de facto proper noun\u201d. Gowland explored several parts of the ranges in the 1860s, being the first documented foreigner to climb two peaks in the Alps, Mount Yari and Mount Norikura. Gowland was an archaeologist, and he explored these ranges for archaeological reasons. While Gowland was the first foreigner to explore the ranges, Reverend Walter Weston, a Christian missionary, was the first foreigner to document his experiences."]}, {"page": "Houston Stewart Chamberlain", "response": ["In August 1914, he started suffering from a progressive paralysis of the limbs. At the end of the war, Chamberlain's paralysis had already befallen much of his body; his chronically bad health had reached its final stage. By the time World War I started in 1914, Chamberlain remained British only by virtue of his name and nationality. When the war started, Chamberlain tried to enlist in the German Army, but was turned down on the account of his age (then 58) and bad health.Field (1981), p.363 In August 1914, Chamberlain wrote a letter to his brother, the Japanologist Basil Hall Chamberlain, explaining why he had sided with his adopted country that read: \"No war has ever been simpler than this; England has not for a moment reduced her efforts to do everything humanly possible to bring it about and to destroy every peaceful impulse. ... Germany's victory will not be England's ruin; quite the contrary, it is the only hope for England's rescue from the total ruin in which she now stands. England's victory will be terrible for the whole world, a catastrophe.\"Field (1981), p. 352 The same month, Chamberlain published an essay celebrating Wilhelm II as an \"Aryan soldier-king\" and as a \"Siegfried\" who had embraced the \"struggle against the corroding poison of Jewry\".R\u00f6hl (2004), p. 207 Chamberlain went on to call the war \"a life-or-death struggle ... between two human ideals: the German and the un-German\". Accordingly, the Reich must \"for the next hundred years or more\" strengthen all things German and carry out \"the determined extermination of the un-German\". Chamberlain happily welcomed the war, writing in September 1914 to his friend Prince Max of Baden: \"I thank God that I have been allowed to experience these two exaltations\u20141870 and 1914\u2014and that I was both times in Germany and saw the truth with my own eyes.\"Field (1981), p. 381 In his 1914 essay, \"Whose Fault Is the War?\", Chamberlain blamed the war on France, Russia and especially Britain.Field (1981), p. 365 Chamberlain argued though St. Petersburg and Paris were both seeking war, it was London who had masterminded the war, and the French and Russians were just British puppets.Field (1981), pp. 365\u201366  Initially Chamberlain expected the war to be over by the end of 1914, and was very disappointed when that did not occur. In 1916 he also acquired German citizenship. He had already begun propagandising on behalf of the German government and continued to do so throughout the war.
