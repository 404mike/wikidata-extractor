The social stigma from dissecting a corpse and travelling abroad counted him an outcast for much of the Indian community."]}, {"page": "Poison dress", "response": ["In 1870, Norman Chevers, M.D., a Surgeon-Major to the Bengal Medical Service, authored Manual of Medical Jurisprudence for India, describing unusual crimes involving poisons native to India.
