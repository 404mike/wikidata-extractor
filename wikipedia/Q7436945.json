He made his name in non-league as a goal-scoring winger and he came to the attention of a number of league clubs. He had trials with three of them and eventually won a move to League Two side Bradford City. He scored a goal on his full debut but Bradford soon changed manager and Neilson dropped back into non-league, first out on loan to Cambridge United and then signed by Crawley Town, having spent less than 12 months with Bradford. Neilson spent a short but successful loan spell with Grimsby Town in 2012, and then joined Luton on a short-term contract in January 2013 before his release a few months later. He returned to Grimsby permanently before joining Whitehawk.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ware F.C.", "response": ["* Scott Neilson"]}, {"page": "Scott Neilson (footballer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Scott Neilson"]}]}}
