Born in Watford, England he started his career at Brentford in 1978 where he spent ten seasons playing in the lower divisions before switching to Sheffield United with whom he enjoyed his most successful period, gaining two promotions and playing in the top flight. He returned to Brentford for a further two seasons before injuries prompted him to retire. A spell on the coaching staff at Brentford was followed by a period as assistant manager at Brighton & Hove Albion where he was twice installed as caretaker manager during his tenure.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Herb Alpert", "response": ["The popularity of the Tijuana Brass in the 1960s spawned many imitation groups. TJB member and composer of Spanish Flea, Julius Wechter, had good success between 1962 and the mid 1970s with his Baja Marimba Band, which was under contract by A&M. On the other side there were cheaply produced \"drugstore records\" by acts such as the Mexicali Brass, Mariachi Brass, Guadalajara Brass, Bullfight Brass, Pert Lapert and his Iguana Brass,  and others. There were also several comic parodies, e. g. by the Frivolous Five's \"Sour Cream and Other Delights\", Bob Booker and George Foster's production \"Al Tijuana and His Jewish Brass\", and David Seville and the Chipmunks' \"Sorry About That, Herb!\""]}, {"page": "Zesh Rehman", "response": ["In the 2003\u201304 season, Rehman made his professional debut on 23 September 2003 in a 1\u20130 defeat away to Wigan Athletic in the second round of the Football League Cup, coming on as a substitute for Junichi Inamoto after 57 minutes.
