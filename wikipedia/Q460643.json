Kenny is the holder of most Olympic gold medals (7) and medals (9) for a British athlete. His wife, Laura Kenny, holds the same records on the female side, and together they are the most successful married couple in Olympic history where both spouses have won at least one gold medal (with 12 gold and 3 silver medals between them). Kenny's seven Olympic gold medals place him joint 15th by reference to gold medals won in the Summer Olympic games since 1896. He is the single holder of most Olympic golds and medals for a cyclist.\nAfter winning World and European Junior titles in 2006 and achieving medals in the under-23 European championships in 2007, Kenny was selected to compete for Great Britain at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. With Chris Hoy and Jamie Staff, he won a gold medal in the team sprint, breaking the world record in the qualifying round. He finished behind Hoy in the final of the individual sprint, gaining a silver medal.\nIn January 2012, he gained his first world championship title, when Gr\u00e9gory Baug\u00e9's results were nullified after a backdated 12-month ban for missing a drugs test, and the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) promoted Kenny to the gold medal. At the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, he won gold medals in both the team sprint and the individual sprint, beating Baug\u00e9 in the final. At the 2016 Summer Olympics Kenny again won in the Team Sprint and the Individual Sprint, and also won the Keirin.  In the 2020 Summer Olympics he won the Keirin again.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Kraftwerk", "response": ["In 2009, Kraftwerk performed concerts with special 3D background graphics in Wolfsburg, Germany; Manchester, UK; and Randers, Denmark.
