Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Lacarra (1907\u20131987) affirmed that the cross was originally only a diocesan boundary, of Carolingian provenance, and was associated with the Way of Saint James. The famous Spanish historian Ram\u00f3n Men\u00e9ndez Pidal argued that the cross was an important stage in the pilgrim's journey because it marked their entrance into Spain.Stephen G.
