Worrall (8 September 1910 \u2013 13 April 1979) was an English footballer born in Warrington, Lancashire, who played as an outside right in the Football League for Oldham Athletic, Portsmouth and Crewe Alexandra. He was capped twice for England, scoring on his debut against the Netherlands in Amsterdam in May 1935, before following it up with another goal in England's 3\u20131 win over Ireland in the British Championship in November 1936. He was noted for his superstitious nature: when Portsmouth played in the 1939 FA Cup Final, he took his small horseshoe, put a sprig of white heather in each sock, tied a small white elephant to one of his garters and put a lucky sixpence in his boots, as well as putting on Pompey manager Jack Tinn's lucky spats. He set up the second goal in Portsmouth's 4\u20131 win, and left the club at the end of the Second World War. He had continued to play for Portsmouth during the war, but also made seven appearances for Manchester United during the 1945\u201346 War League season, scoring twice.", "link_mentions": {}}}
