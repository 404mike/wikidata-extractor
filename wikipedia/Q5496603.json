Worrall (8 September 1910 \u2013 13 April 1979) was an English footballer born in Warrington, Lancashire, who played as an outside right in the Football League for Oldham Athletic, Portsmouth and Crewe Alexandra. He was capped twice for England, scoring on his debut against the Netherlands in Amsterdam in May 1935, before following it up with another goal in England's 3\u20131 win over Ireland in the British Championship in November 1936. He was noted for his superstitious nature: when Portsmouth played in the 1939 FA Cup Final, he took his small horseshoe, put a sprig of white heather in each sock, tied a small white elephant to one of his garters and put a lucky sixpence in his boots, as well as putting on Pompey manager Jack Tinn's lucky spats. He set up the second goal in Portsmouth's 4\u20131 win, and left the club at the end of the Second World War. He had continued to play for Portsmouth during the war, but also made seven appearances for Manchester United during the 1945\u201346 War League season, scoring twice.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1978\u201379 in English football", "response": ["* 13 April 1979 - Fred Worrall, 68, was capped twice by England as a right-winger in the 1930s and was an FA Cup runner-up in 1934 and a winner in 1939 with Portsmouth."]}, {"page": "1934 FA Cup Final", "response": ["Portsmouth started away to Manchester United, who at the time of the match were in the relegation zone of the Second Division.

After defeating Grimsby Town and Swansea Town 2\u20130 and 1\u20130 respectively, they faced Bolton Wanderers in the quarter-finals. Bolton had scored 12 goals in three FA Cup games thus far, however they could not get a goal against Portsmouth, who won emphatically, 3\u20130. Leicester City were the opponents in the semi-final, held at St Andrew's, Birmingham, in front of a record crowd for the venue. Portsmouth took an early lead, when a Jack Smith free kick was received by Rutherford, who set up the scoring chance for Jack Weddle. 15 minutes later Weddle scored again, from a Fred Worrall cross. After a flurry of chances Leicester got a goal back before half-time, but Portsmouth had the better of the second-half. First Weddle completed his hat-trick, then Rutherford took advantage of poor positioning from the Leicester defence to score a fourth Portsmouth goal, to make the final score 4\u20131.", "| ||7 || Fred Worrall"]}, {"page": "1939 FA Cup Final", "response": ["| ||7 || Fred Worrall"]}, {"page": "Worrall (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Fred Worrall (fl. 1930s), English association football player"]}, {"page": "Warrington", "response": ["*Fred Worrall (1910 in Warrington\u2013 1979), footballer, made 425 professional appearances"]}, {"page": "1931\u201332 Southampton F.C. season", "response": ["Southampton and Portsmouth met again on 9 May in the Rowland Hospital Cup, the first of their annual end-of-season charity cup matches.
