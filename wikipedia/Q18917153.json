She sat the external examination of London University for Classics while still at school, placing in the first class.  She then won a scholarship to Girton College, Cambridge which she attended from 1904, reading for the Classical Tripos.  She passed parts one and two in 1907 and 1908, achieving first class honours in both. She also won the Agnata Butler prize, the Therese Montefiore prize and the Gilchrist fellowship for research.  As Cambridge University did not grant degrees to women, she took her bachelor's degree at Bedford College, London, which had been founded as a ladies' college by Unitarian women.  She graduated in 1906 and then took her master's degree three years later for her thesis on the genesis of Plato's theory of ideas. Her doctorate was awarded by London University much later in 1930."]}, {"page": "Agnata Frances Ramsay", "response": ["#REDIRECT Agnata Butler"]}, {"page": "Agnata Frances Butler", "response": ["#REDIRECT Agnata Butler"]}, {"page": "Agnata Ramsey", "response": ["#REDIRECT Agnata Butler"]}, {"page": "Agnata Ramsay", "response": ["#REDIRECT Agnata Butler"]}, {"page": "Agnata Butler Prize", "response": ["#REDIRECT Agnata Butler"]}, {"page": "List of women classicists", "response": ["*Agnata Butler, first lady of Cambridge"]}, {"page": "Sir James Ramsay, 10th Baronet", "response": ["Ramsay received honorary doctorates from the University of Glasgow and the University of Cambridge, and he was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 1915.
