However, when World War II broke in 1939, Newcastle had a chance to regroup, and in the War period, they brought in Jackie Milburn, Tommy Walker and Bobby Cowell. They were finally promoted back to the First Division at the end of the 1947\u201348 season. During the 1950s, Newcastle won the FA Cup trophy on three occasions within a five-year period, beating Blackpool in 1951, Arsenal in 1952, and Manchester City in 1955. However, after this last FA Cup victory the club fell back into decline and were relegated to the Second Division once again at the end of the 1960\u201361 season under the management of Charlie Mitten. Mitten left after one season in the Second Division and was replaced by former player Joe Harvey. Newcastle returned to the First Division at the end of the 1964\u201365 season after winning the Second Division title. Under Harvey, the club qualified for European competition for the first time after a good run in the 1967\u201368 season and the following year won the 1969 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final, triumphing 6\u20132 over two legs against Hungary's \u00dajpest in the final."]}, {"page": "Northumberland", "response": ["There are many notable footballers from the county, pre Second World War and immediate post war greats were George Camsell and Hughie Gallacher, these were described in the \"Clown Prince of Football\" by Len Shackleton.

Keegan explained that Shankly's motivation was made easy after the pre-game talking by Supermac (Malcolm Macdonald) and to a lesser extent John Tudor. Tudor and Keegan's friend, Macdonald, gave interviews confidently proclaiming they had more ability whilst also being critical of older Liverpool pros such as Tommy Smith. Keegan also believed Shankly may have got into the heads of the Newcastle players when on the night before the game Shankly and Joe Harvey were being interviewed and Shankly was heard on the microphone, but off-camera, stating, \"Joe looks a bag of nerves...\" Keegan explained, knowing Shankly it would not surprise him if this was not an accident and Shankly knew what he was doing and that this statement was meant to neutralise any of Newcastle's confidence and that this did indeed rub off into the heads of some of the Newcastle players who became anxious. In the final, Keegan scored two as Liverpool beat Newcastle United 3\u20130. It was the first brace in an FA Cup final since Mike Trebilcock scored twice for Everton in 1966. The game against Newcastle was Keegan's first FA Cup Final. To Keegan, with the 100,000 inside the ground, the non-stop chanting of both sets of fans, and then the millions watching on TV, this game was as close to a non drug-induced psychedelic experience as he could ever get. He noted how after this final Shankly, he and the other Liverpool players were sympathetic to the devastated Newcastle players and tried to not rub it in with their victory."]}, {"page": "St James' Park", "response": ["| Joe Harvey"]}, {"page": "Jackie Milburn", "response": ["In 1943, Newcastle were participants in the Northern First Championship as the Football League had been suspended due to the outbreak of the Second World War. Milburn attended his first training session the day after his signing, and immediately impressed his new teammates by out-sprinting Albert Stubbins in a 100-yard dash. Milburn joined the playing squad for United's next match against Bradford City at Valley Parade on 28\u00a0August\u00a01943. Seymour invited Milburn's father to accompany him and Jackie recalled later that this was \"to give me confidence on such a momentous day\". Milburn started at inside-forward in the number 10 shirt and later recalled that this was \"the most memorable moment of my career, even those Wembley victories can't match it. To pull on the black and white jersey for the first time was something special\". Milburn and United were beaten 2\u20131, with a nervous Milburn heading wide of an open goal in the early moments. The Bradford goals were both scored by half-back Joe Harvey. Milburn, disappointed to have made little impact, was consoled afterwards by Seymour, who assured him \"you'll be in the side next week\". A return fixture was played against Bradford City at St James' Park on 4\u00a0September\u00a01943 and Milburn scored his first ever goal for United \u2013 with a left-footed strike inside the opening two minutes of a 3\u20132 win. It was Milburn's first touch of the match. Milburn later recalled that \"the Sunday papers said it was an excellent goal but...I saw the ball in a cluster of players and dashed up and belted it\". Milburn continued to combine his football career with his work at the colliery. As author Roger Hutchinson later explained: \"None of those wartime footballers could be counted as full-time professionals during the war\". By the turn of 1943 he had almost completed his apprenticeship at the colliery and was transferred to Woodhorn Colliery. Milburn used to combine his work at Woodhorn with training on two or occasionally three evenings a week, and there were some instances where Milburn would work a double shift on a Friday, so he would be free to play for United on the following Saturday.", "United manager Stan Seymour almost entirely rebuilt his Second Division squad during the warHutchinson, 2004: 133 so when United played Barnsley at St James' Park in the third round of the resumed FA Cup on 5 January 1946, Milburn, Bobby Cowell, Charlie Crowe, Joe Harvey and Charlie Wayman were five of nine players making their competitive debut. 60,284 spectators saw Milburn score twice \u2013 his first official goals for the club \u2013 in a 4\u20132 win.

He scored six goals on his debut in Newcastle's 13\u20130 defeat of Newport County at St James' Park on 5 October, with three of his goals coming within the space of just 155 seconds.The Times, 7 October 1946, Association Football Newcastle's 13 Goals However his return to Park Avenue in his fourth game for Newcastle was not a happy one, as he had a penalty saved by former teammate Chick Farr in a 2\u20131 defeat to Bradford PA. The \"Magpies\" boasted a devastating forward line of Jackie Milburn, Roy Bentley, Charlie Wayman, Shackleton, and Tommy Pearson, and totalled 95 league goals in the 1946\u201347 season, though their tally of 62 goals conceded and 13 defeats left the club having to settle for fifth place. They did though reach the semi-finals of the FA Cup, where they were beaten 4\u20130 by Charlton Athletic. After the semi-final game he and club captain Joe Harvey went on strike over housing issues; the club's board eventually relented and granted Shackleton the house they had initially promised him, though to save face told the press that Harvey and Shackleton had been in the wrong and had apologised. He further came into conflict with the club at Christmas 1947, when he and goalkeeper Jack Fairbrother refused to join the squad on a scouting party on opponents Charlton Athletic, who they faced later that season in the third round of the FA Cup.

He teamed up with Stan Seymour to rebuild United and the Black'n'Whites returned to the elite as Second Division Champions in 1965. United then became very much an unpredictable side, always capable of defeating the best, but never quite realising their huge potential until very recently.", "Joe Harvey's side qualified for Europe for the first time in 1968 and stunned everyone the following year by lifting the Inter Cities Fairs Cup; the forerunner of the UEFA Cup. United possessed a solid eleven and Newcastle's tradition of fielding a famous Number 9 at centre-forward since earliest years continued as big Welshman Wyn Davies was prominent along with the likes of Pop Robson, Bobby Moncur and Frank Clark.", "Nicknamed 'Supermac', Macdonald was one of United's greatest hero figures. Brash, arrogant and devastating in front of goal, he led United's attack to Wembley in 1974, against Liverpool in the FA Cup. But the Magpies failed to bring the trophy back to Tyneside, and a complete lack of success in any of the competitions the next season resulted in Joe Harvey being sacked in mid-1975.", "Smith then signed Portsmouth striker Mick Quinn and Newcastle began the 1989-90 season on a high note, beating promotion favourites Leeds United 5-2 on the opening day with Quinn scoring four goals, and Newcastle appeared to be on the path to a revival. However, they missed out on automatic promotion by one place, before enduring a humiliating play-off exit at the hands of local rivals Sunderland. The intensifying boardroom battle soon took its toll on the club, and Smith resigned early in the following season with the side stuck in mid-table. Ossie Ardiles became the club's new manager, and despite being initially being the club's most popular manager since Joe Harvey, Newcastle dropped to the bottom of the Second Division in October 1991. Results failed to improve, despite the acquisition of a new striker in David Kelly and the efforts of promising young players including Steve Howey, Steve Watson and Gavin Peacock, and in February 1992 Ardiles was sacked. Despite being the best-supported side in the division and frequently still managing to pull in crowds of more than 20,000, Newcastle were also millions of pounds in debt and faced with the real prospect of third tier football for the first time ever. A saviour was needed, and in came new chairman John Hall, who offered the manager's job to Kevin Keegan. Despite having vowed never to enter management following his retirement as a player, Keegan accepted the offer to manage Newcastle. His first task was to deliver Second Division survival."]}]}}
