Pugin attempted to popularize advocacy of the neo-gothic, and repudiation of the neoclassical, by composing and illustrating books that contended the supremacy of the former and the degeneracy of the latter, which were published from 1835. In 1845, Pugin, in his Contrasts: or a Parallel Between the Noble Edifices of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Centuries and Similar Buildings of the Present Day, which the author had to publish himself as a consequence of the extent of the defamation of society architects therein, satirized John Nash as \"Mr Wash, Plasterer, who jobs out Day Work on Moderate Terms\", and Burton as \"Talent of No Consequence, Premium Required\", and included satirical sketches of Nash's Buckingham Palace and Burton's triumphal arch at Hyde Park. Consequently, the amount of commissions received by Burton declined, although he retained a close friendship with the aristocrats amongst his patrons, who continued to commission him. Burton completed a new portico, hall, and staircase for the William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire's residence near Piccadilly; additions to 10 Belgrave Square for the 2nd Earl of Burlington (later the 7th Duke of Devonshire); the enlargement of Grimston Park, Yorkshire, for John Hobart Caradoc, 2nd Baron Howden and the Russian Princess Bagration; additions to Syon House for Lord Prudhoe (later the 4th Duke of Northumberland); and a new town, Fleetwood, in Lancashire, for Sir Peter Hesketh-Fleetwood."]}, {"page": "List of ambassadors of the United Kingdom to Spain", "response": ["|John Hobart Caradoc, 2nd Baron Howden"]}, {"page": "Royal Guelphic Order", "response": ["* John Hobart Caradoc, 2nd Baron Howden"]}, {"page": "Order of Saint Anna", "response": ["*John Hobart Caradoc, 2nd Baron Howden"]}, {"page": "Baron Howden", "response": ["*John Hobart Caradoc, 2nd Baron Howden (1799\u20131873)"]}, {"page": "John Hobart Caradoc", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Hobart Caradoc, 2nd Baron Howden"]}, {"page": "Catherine Bagration", "response": ["In Paris on 18 January 1830 she married the British general and diplomat Sir John Hobart Caradoc, 2nd Baron Howden and Grimston; she was fifteen years his senior.
