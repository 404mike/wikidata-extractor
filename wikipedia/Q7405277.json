The term butch tends to denote a degree of masculinity displayed by a female individual beyond what would be considered typical of a tomboy. It is not uncommon for women with a butch appearance to face harassment or violence. A 1990s survey of butches showed that 50% were primarily attracted to femmes, while 25% reported being usually attracted to other butches. Feminist scholar Sally Rowena Munt described butches as \"the recognizable public form of lesbianism\" and an outlaw figure within lesbian culture."]}, {"page": "List of feminists", "response": ["|1940\u20131999||data-sort-value=\"Munt, Sally Rowena\"|Sally Rowena Munt||United Kingdom||1960||\u2013||Feminist academic and lesbian theorist, author of Heroic Desire: Lesbian Identity and Cultural Space (1998)||"]}, {"page": "Munt", "response": ["** Sally Rowena Munt, British feminist and academic"]}, {"page": "Sally Munt", "response": ["#Redirect Sally Rowena Munt"]}, {"page": "Jack Donovan", "response": ["Investigative journalist and right-wing extremism expert Chip Berlet noted that the emergence of homosexual figures such as Donovan and James O'Meara among the alt-right in the United States was unusual compared to white supremacist groups in Europe.
