The Zanzibar police had caught a slave trader in the act of exporting slaves from Pemba and he had been arrested.  However, despite claims he was a native of Pemba he claimed French nationality as a native of the Comoros islands and flew a French flag from his dhow.  Raikes returned the flag to M. Laronce the French consul and, in court with the Arab caid, pronounced a sentence of one years imprisonment on the slaver.  The British consul Arthur Henry Hardinge pronounced that the likelihood was that the slaver was born in Pemba and even if from the Comoros his birth would have preceded the declaration of the French protectorate. In 1899 Raikes, on behalf of the Zanzibari sultan, accepted the line of demarcation proposed by Hardinge between British and Zanzibari possessions on the African mainland, this crossing the line of the Uganda Railway."]}, {"page": "Arthur Edward Hardinge", "response": ["On 30 December 1858, he married Mary Georgina Frances Ellis, daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel the Honourable Augustus Frederick Ellis, and had one son (Arthur Henry Hardinge) and three daughters."]}, {"page": "John Tilley (diplomat)", "response": ["After promotion early in 1909, he was made Head of the African Department.
