His research was mainly on the phonetics of English and French, but he also worked on the phonetics of Hausa and Yoruba. He committed suicide while a patient at the Broadmoor Criminal Lunatic Asylum, where he was committed after killing his wife, the violinist Elsie Winifred Owen, in 1941.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Daniel Jones (phonetician)", "response": ["Apart from his own vast array of published work, Jones will be remembered for having acted as mentor to numerous scholars who later went on to become famous linguists in their own right.
