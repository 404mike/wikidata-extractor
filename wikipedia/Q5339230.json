Adams was born in Shepton Mallet and died in Kingston upon Thames. A book published in 2017 gives his date of death as 24 March 2005.Adams batted in just one innings of the match against Essex at Clacton. He scored five coming in fifth in the batting order in the first innings, but when Somerset captain Reggie Ingle rejigged the order to make swift runs for a declaration in the second innings, Adams did not bat. Ingle's tactics were justified with a 150-run victory.", "link_mentions": {}}}
