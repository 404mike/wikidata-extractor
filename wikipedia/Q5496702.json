Freddie Calthorpe was educated at Windlesham House School, Repton and Jesus College, Cambridge. He served in the Royal Air Force during World War I.In a first-class career that extended from 1911 to 1935, Calthorpe played cricket for Sussex, Cambridge University, Warwickshire and England. He toured with Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) to Australia and New Zealand in 1922\u201323, a trip that also served as a honeymoon for him and his bride Dorothy. He captained Warwickshire from 1920 to 1929, and also led a strong MCC team on a tour of the West Indies in 1925\u201326.He captained England in his only four Test matches: on the first ever Test tour of the West Indies in 1929\u201330, which was drawn 1\u20131. This tour was played simultaneously to another England Test tour to New Zealand, where England were captained by Harold Gilligan. During the tour, in a speech he gave in Barbados, he condemned the bowling tactic, later known as bodyline, which had been used by the West Indian fast bowler Learie Constantine.He died of cancer in Worplesdon, Surrey.\nCalthorpe is distantly related to the cricket commentator Henry Blofeld, and more closely to the England captain H. D. G. Leveson Gower and the early cricket patron John Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bodyline", "response": ["Some fast bowlers experimented with leg theory prior to 1932, sometimes accompanying the tactic with short-pitched bowling. In 1925, Australian Jack Scott first bowled a form of what would later have been called bodyline in a state match for New South Wales; his captain Herbie Collins disliked it and would not let him use it again. Other Australian captains were less particular, including Vic Richardson, who asked the South Australian bowler Lance Gun to use it in 1925,Frith, pp. 27\u201329. and later let Scott use it when he moved to South Australia. Scott repeated the tactics against the MCC in 1928\u201329.Douglas, pp. 79\u201380.Frith, pp. 28\u201329. In 1927, in a Test trial match, \"Nobby\" Clark bowled short to a leg-trap (a cluster of fielders placed close on the leg side). He was representing England in a side captained by Douglas Jardine.Douglas, pp. 59\u201360. In 1928\u201329, Harry Alexander bowled fast leg theory at an England team,Douglas, p. 83. and Harold Larwood briefly used a similar tactic on that same tour in two Test matches. Freddie Calthorpe, the England captain, criticised Learie Constantine's use of short-pitched bowling to a leg side field in a Test match in 1930;Howat (1976), p. 60. one such ball struck Andy Sandham, but Constantine only reverted to more conventional tactics after a complaint from the England team.Frith, pp. 31\u201332."]}, {"page": "Henry Blofeld", "response": ["Blofeld is a distant relative of the Honourable Freddie Calthorpe, a former England Test captain, but, contrary to common belief, he is not Calthorpe's nephew."]}, {"page": "Wally Hammond", "response": ["Hammond's performances earned him selection for the M.C.C. winter tour of the West Indies in the 1925\u201326 season. At that time, such tours were popular with amateur cricketers, who were often chosen for social rather than cricketing reasons. The touring party contained only eight professionals, who were expected to do most of the bowling and provide the cricketing quality.Foot, pp. 26\u201327. The West Indies team did not have Test status, so no official internationals were scheduled, but a series of representative matches against a West Indian team were played. Rain disrupted much of the cricket, but Hammond enjoyed the experience.Foot, p. 32.Hammond, p. 28. In first-class matches, he scored 732 runs at an average of 48.80, with two hundreds and two fifties, and took 20 wickets at an average of 28.65. He scored 238 not out in the first representative game against a West Indies side. Following the tour, he won praise from Warner and the captain of the M.C.C. team, Freddie Calthorpe, and was believed to be close to the full England side.Foot, p. 34."]}, {"page": "History of the West Indian cricket team", "response": ["The West Indies played 19 Tests in the 1930s in four series against England and one against Australia. The first four of these were played against an England team led by the Honourable Freddie Calthorpe that toured in 1929\u201330. However, as Harold Gilligan was leading another English team to New Zealand at exactly the same time, this was not a full-strength England side. The series ended one-all, with the West Indies first ever Test victory being recorded on 26 February 1930. West Indian George Headley scored the most runs (703) in the rubber and Learie Constantine took the most wickets (18)."]}, {"page": "List of England cricket captains", "response": ["| 33 || Honourable Freddie Calthorpe || 1929\u201330 || || West Indies || West Indies || 4 || 1 || 1 || 2"]}]}}
