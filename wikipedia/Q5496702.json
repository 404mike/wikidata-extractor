Freddie Calthorpe was educated at Windlesham House School, Repton and Jesus College, Cambridge. He served in the Royal Air Force during World War I.In a first-class career that extended from 1911 to 1935, Calthorpe played cricket for Sussex, Cambridge University, Warwickshire and England. He toured with Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) to Australia and New Zealand in 1922\u201323, a trip that also served as a honeymoon for him and his bride Dorothy. He captained Warwickshire from 1920 to 1929, and also led a strong MCC team on a tour of the West Indies in 1925\u201326.He captained England in his only four Test matches: on the first ever Test tour of the West Indies in 1929\u201330, which was drawn 1\u20131. This tour was played simultaneously to another England Test tour to New Zealand, where England were captained by Harold Gilligan. During the tour, in a speech he gave in Barbados, he condemned the bowling tactic, later known as bodyline, which had been used by the West Indian fast bowler Learie Constantine.He died of cancer in Worplesdon, Surrey.\nCalthorpe is distantly related to the cricket commentator Henry Blofeld, and more closely to the England captain H. D. G. Leveson Gower and the early cricket patron John Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset.", "link_mentions": {}}}
