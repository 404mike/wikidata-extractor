Another Cambridge try early in the second half gave them a five-point lead, but an injury to a winger reduced them to 14 men. Poulton capitalised on it: he scored from a dummy pass to Geen; and ran in a solo try after receiving a pass from flyhalf Freddie Knott.

Under the captaincy of Dicky Owen, Wales won the game 21-6, with Hirst and fellow debutant Reggie Plummer scoring a try each. Hirst had difficulty holding his role in the Welsh team, and was replaced by Bryn Lewis and later Billy Geen. Hirst recovered his place the next year when he was again selected to face Scotland in the 1913 Five Nations Championship. Hirst was again on the winning team, but found himself dropped once more. In the 1914 Championship Hirst managed to hold down the role on the wing when he played in all four matches, losing only once, in the opening game against England. During the tournament, Hirst scored a further two tries and two drop goals."]}, {"page": "List of international rugby union players killed in World War I", "response": ["| || Bryn Lewis || 1912\u20131913||2 ||2 April 1917 (26)||Ypres, Belgium||"]}, {"page": "Poulton's Match", "response": ["|LW ||Ronnie Poulton||LW ||Bryn Lewis"]}, {"page": "Bryn (given name)", "response": ["* Bryn Lewis (1891\u20131917), Welsh international rugby union player"]}]}}
