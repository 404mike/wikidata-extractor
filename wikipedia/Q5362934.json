They travelled on to Cork, Ireland where they acted together.See, e.g., The Private Correspondence of David Garrick, 2 volumes (Henry Colburn and Richard Bentley, London 1831), I, pp. 642-45 (Google). They both returned to London for the autumn season, Hartley to continue at Covent Garden and Smith to Drury Lane. Garrick having engaged him for Drury Lane, he remained there until retirement in 1788. Though for a long time he played lead roles in tragedy, for which he had a suitably tall and well-proportioned figure, his facial features lacked the flexibility and expressiveness, and his vocal delivery was somewhat too harsh and monotonous, to be considered ideal.J. Boaden, The Life of Mrs. Jordan: Including Original Private Correspondence, 2 vols (Edward Bull, London 1831), I, pp. 120-23 (Google). However, he won popularity as Richard III, Hotspur, and Hastings, and was also admired in the roles of Kitely (Every Man in his Humour, in which he was preferred to GarrickIpswich Journal, 9 October 1819, p. 4.), Archer, and Oakly. It was said that he prided himself on the reflection that he was never called upon to perform in an after-piece, or to pass through a trapdoor in any entrance or exit on the stage.Ipswich Journal, as above.", "In his early days, Smith was often distracted from his professional work by his love of fox-hunting.Ipswich Journal, as above. He first married the sister of John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich, Mrs Kelland Courtnay (a widow), who died in 1762. His elopement to Ireland with Elizabeth Hartley followed. In later life he was remarried, to Miss Newson of Leiston in Suffolk. (Through the second marriage in the Newson family is traced a relationship to Hamlet Watling, whose brother Edwin also married a daughter of Smith'sHamlet Watling, 'Suffolk Heraldry & Genealogy in 12 Vols' (MS, Ipswich Museum, Christchurch Mansion) Vol 8.). Smith died at Bury St Edmunds on 13 September 1819 in his 89th year. There his elegant figure was remembered as always wearing a white hat edged with green, a blue coat, figured waistcoat, fustian coloured breeches, and gaiters to match, and carrying a gold-headed cane. He was loved by the youngsters of Bury whom he often obliged with sweets from the candy-shop.W.
