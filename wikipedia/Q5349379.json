Several of her new neighbours at this time were constructing residences in the square's newly developed north side, and Home followed suit. In June 1772, she bought a ninety-year lease on a parcel of land. She commissioned the young architect James Wyatt, who had just completed the Pantheon in London, to construct a lavish town house at the site. Wyatt worked on the project until 1775, when a disagreement led to his replacement with the brothers Robert and James Adam. This new estate, Home House, was built in part to entertain and house two large portraits by Thomas Gainsborough of her friends the Duke and Duchess of Cumberland and Strathearn; the Duke was a royal prince shunned from court for his unequal marriage, and his wife was a daughter of the Luttrells. The project produced one of the city's finest interiors; architectural historian Eileen Harris writes that the inside of Home House is \"rightly regarded as among Robert Adam's masterpieces.\" Historians have remained uncertain as to why Lady Home decided to build the house, considering that she was childless and in her dotage. Home died on 15 January 1784 in London and is buried in Westminster Abbey."]}, {"page": "Country Life (books)", "response": ["*The Country Houses of Robert Adam (2007) Eileen Harris, Aurum Press, 192 pages, , ."]}]}}
