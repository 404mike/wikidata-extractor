In 1770 he reprinted a letter of \"Junius\", for which he was put on trial and by a jury found guilty, although it is unclear what, if anything, was his punishment.During the American Revolution, he published a monthly series of papers entitled The Remembrancer on events in America. In 1784 he established a newspaper, the General Advertiser, but it was unsuccessful. He published Biographical, Literary, and Political Anecdotes in 1797, and his Correspondence with friend John Wilkes appeared posthumously.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hansard", "response": ["In 1771 Brass Crosby, who was Lord Mayor of the City of London, had brought before him a printer by the name of John Miller who dared publish reports of Parliamentary proceedings. He released the man, but was subsequently ordered to appear before the House to explain his actions. Crosby was committed to the Tower of London, but when he was brought to trial, several judges refused to hear the case and after protests from the public, Crosby was released. Parliament ceased to punish the publishing of its debates as harshly, partly due to the campaigns of John Wilkes on behalf of free speech. There then began several attempts to publish reports of debates. Among the early successes, the Parliamentary Register published by John Almon and John Debrett began in 1775 and ran until 1813."]}, {"page": "William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield", "response": ["On 19 December 1769, Junius wrote a letter attacking the King, and incensed at this, the government ordered several people to be arrested and tried for seditious libel, including Woodfall for publishing the letters, John Almon for selling them, and John Miller for republishing them. Almon's case was heard at Westminster Hall by Mansfield and a jury on 2 June 1770. He was found guilty, although it is unclear in what fashion he was punished, if at all.  Woodfall was tried on 13 June 1770, by Mansfield and a jury. While Mansfield believed that the language used was libellous, the jury disagreed, and held that he was \"guilty of printing and publishing only\", and innocent of seditious libel.Heward (1979) p. 128 Miller was tried on 13 July 1770, and after six hours of discussion, the jury found him innocent. As a result of these two trials, it became clear that no jury would convict a printer for printing these letters, leaving Junius free to continue publishing them."]}, {"page": "Junius (writer)", "response": ["The pre-established harmony between Junius and his readers accounts for the rapidity of his success, and for the importance attributed to him by Burke and Johnson. Before 1772 there appeared at least twelve unauthorized republications of his letters, made by speculative printers. In that year he revised the collection titled Junius: Stat nominis umbra, with a dedication to the English people and a preface. Other independent editions followed in quick succession. In 1801 one was published with annotations by Robert Heron. In 1806 another appeared with notes by John Almon. The first new edition of real importance was issued by the Woodfall family in 1812. It contained the correspondence of Junius with Henry Sampson Woodfall, a selection of the miscellaneous letters attributed to Junius, facsimiles of his handwriting, and notes by John Mason Good. Curiosity as to the mystery of the authorship began to replace political and literary interest in the writings. Junius himself had been early aware of the advantage he secured by concealment. \"The mystery of Junius increases his importance\" is his confession in a letter to Wilkes dated 18 September 1771."]}, {"page": "Francis Dashwood, 11th Baron le Despencer", "response": ["About 1755 Dashwood founded the famous \"Hell-fire Club\", or \"monks of Medmenham Abbey\".

They were in close consultation throughout the summer of 1763. He then acted for Wilkes in his application for a writ of habeas corpus in May 1763, in the action against George Montagu Dunk, 2nd Earl of Halifax, and in the trial which took place in 1764 on the republication of The North Briton in volumes. He was the advocate of John Almon in 1765, pleaded in the king's bench against the outlawry of Wilkes in 1768, and was counsel for Alderman James Townsend in his action in June 1772 against the collector of land tax, which Townsend had refused to pay, urging the nullity of Parliament through the irregularity of the Middlesex election."]}, {"page": "George Nicol (bookseller)", "response": ["Nicol was born in Scotland, probably in May 1740 (or perhaps in 1741).Painting.Maxted.
