He attended University College, Oxford, where, in his rooms, the historic meeting between Robert Southey and Coleridge took place. He was also an associate of Hazlitt and William Godwin, and a number of scholars have speculated that he was responsible for the acquaintance of Lamb and William Godwin. Coleridge lamented in a letter that Godwin was having a negative influence on Allen and had cause him to become a religious sceptic.\nAllen married a widow much older than himself who had children as old as he was. Lamb is known to have strongly objected to the marriage. Sadly for Allen his wife died shortly after they were married. In 1797 Allen was appointed Deputy Surgeon of the Second Royal Dragoons in Portugal. And in 1802 he spent time in the Lake District with John Stoddart, the brother-in-law of William Hazlitt. \nAllen practiced as a journalist for a number of years, writing for the periodicals The Oracle, The True Briton, The Star, and The Traveller. But journalism offered Allen little success.\nLamb wrote several short reminiscences of Allen included in his essay \"Newspapers\", and \"Christ's Hospital Five and Thirty Years Ago\". Leigh Hunt's Autobiography also contains a panegyric to Allen. Hunt wrote: \"Nor shalt thou, their composer, be quickly forgotten, Allen, with the cordial smile, and still more cordial laugh, with which thou wert wont to make the old cloister shake, in thy cognition of some poignant jest of theirs; or the anticipation of some more material, and, peradventure, practical one, of thine own.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Robert Allen", "response": ["*Bob Allen (Pennsylvania politician) (born 1945), American state legislator", "*Bob Allen (Florida politician) (born 1958), American state legislator", "*Bob Allen (shortstop) (1867\u20131943), American baseball player and manager", "*Bob Allen (American football/baseball) (1894\u20131975), halfback and center fielder", "*Bob Allen (1930s pitcher) (1914\u20132005), American right-hander in National League, 1937", "*Bob Allen (1960s pitcher) (born 1937), American League left-hander, 1961\u201367", "*Bob Allen (basketball) (born 1946), American power forward", "*Bob Allen (Australian footballer) (1908\u20131992), player with Fitzroy in VFL", "*Bob Allen (footballer, born 1916) (1916\u20131992), English winger", "*Bob Allen (surgeon) (1772\u20131805), English journalist and surgeon", "*Bob Allen (economic historian) (born 1947), American professor of economic history at Oxford University"]}, {"page": "List of people educated at Christ's Hospital", "response": ["*Bob Allen \u2013 Army surgeon and journalist"]}, {"page": "List of alumni of University College, Oxford", "response": ["*Bob Allen, surgeon"]}, {"page": "Robert (Bob) Allen", "response": ["#REDIRECT Bob Allen (surgeon)"]}]}}
