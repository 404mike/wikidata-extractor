He was selected to play for the Third division South representative team in 1956\u201357.\nElsworthy was part of the Wales squad for the 1958 FIFA World Cup in Sweden, but didn't travel to Sweden as the Welsh FA were too short of money to send a full squad.

He was an inductee of the Ipswich Hall of Fame.After retiring from football he ran a post office branch in Ipswich. In his later years, he suffered from Alzheimer's disease.
