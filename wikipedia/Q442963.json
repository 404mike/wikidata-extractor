He became established as one of the leading Polish composers, and as a conductor he was instrumental in the re-establishment of the Warsaw Philharmonic orchestra after World War II. After his increasing frustration with the extra-musical demands made on him by the country's regime, he defected to the United Kingdom in 1954, and took up British citizenship. In 1957, he became chief conductor of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, a post he relinquished after two years to devote all his time to composition.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Polish composers", "response": ["*Andrzej Panufnik (1914-1991)"]}, {"page": "September 24", "response": ["*  1914   \u2013 Andrzej Panufnik, Polish pianist, composer, and conductor (d. 1991)"]}, {"page": "1991", "response": ["** Andrzej Panufnik, Polish musician and composer (b. 1914)"]}, {"page": "Music of Poland", "response": ["Following World War II and the country becoming a communist system, some composers, such as Roman Palester and Andrzej Panufnik, fled the country and remained in exile.

The style emerged from the political crisis in 1956, following Stalin's death. In the same year the Warsaw Autumn music festival was inaugurated, both closely connected. According to conductor Antoni Wit composers were given artistic freedom because the Polish regime wasn't as harsh as other Eastern European dictatorships and music wasn't considered ideologically relevant unlike literature, theater or cinema.Antoni Wit: \"Creo que cada vez lo hago un poco mejor\" .

This artistic censorship, which ultimately came from Stalin personally, was to some degree prevalent over the whole Eastern bloc, and was reinforced by the 1948 Zhdanov decree. By 1948, the ZKP was taken over by musicians willing to follow the party line on musical matters, and Lutos\u0142awski resigned from the committee. He was implacably opposed to the ideas of Socialist realism.;  quotes Lutos\u0142awski speaking in 1957, \"[I]t is difficult to conceive of a more absurd hypothesis than the idea that the achievements of the past several decades should be abandoned and that one should return to the musical language of the nineteenth century .... The period of which I speak may not have lasted long ... but all the same it was long enough to do our music immense harm.\" His First Symphony was proscribed as \"formalist\", and he found himself shunned by the Soviet authorities, a situation that continued throughout the era of Khrushchev, Brezhnev, Andropov and Chernenko. In 1954, the climate of musical oppression drove his friend Andrzej Panufnik to defect to the United Kingdom. Against this background, Lutos\u0142awski was content to compose pieces for which there was social need, but in 1954 this earned him\u2014much to the composer's chagrin\u2014the Prime Minister's Prize for a set of children's songs.
