His main motivation for changing nation was the prospect of medals at the Commonwealth Games.\nOn 16 December 2010 Badminton England and Badminton Scotland announced that Blair would be returning to Scotland. The reason(s) for Blair's return to Scotland remain unclear, but reports suggest a falling-out with members of the Badminton England setup was central to the decision.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gail Emms", "response": ["| align=\"left\" |  Robert Blair   Natalie Munt"]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 2004 Summer Olympics", "response": ["|align=left|Robert BlairNatalie Munt"]}, {"page": "Nathan Robertson", "response": ["| align=\"left\" |  Robert Blair   Natalie Munt"]}, {"page": "Lars Paaske", "response": ["| align=\"left\" |  Anthony Clark  Robert Blair"]}, {"page": "Jonas Rasmussen", "response": ["| align=\"left\" |  Robert Blair   Anthony Clark"]}, {"page": "Robert Mateusiak", "response": ["|align=\"left\"| Robert Blair Imogen Bankier", "|align=\"left\"| Robert Blair Imogen Bankier", "* / Robert Blair & Gabrielle White 1\u20130"]}, {"page": "Tadashi \u014ctsuka", "response": ["He also competed in mixed doubles with partner Shizuka Yamamoto.
