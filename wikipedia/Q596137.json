He remains famous for his futuristic television programmes, especially his 1960s productions filmed with \"Supermarionation\" (marionette puppets containing electric moving parts).\nAnderson's first television production was the 1957 Roberta Leigh children's series The Adventures of Twizzle (1957-58). Torchy the Battery Boy (1960), Four Feather Falls (1960), Supercar (1961\u201362) and Fireball XL5 (1962\u201363) followed later, both series breaking into the US television market in the early 1960s. In the mid-1960s Anderson produced his most successful series, Thunderbirds. Other television productions of the 1960s include Stingray and Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons.\nAnderson also wrote and produced several feature films. Following a shift towards live action productions in the 1970s, he had a long and successful association with media impresario Lew Grade and Grade's company ITC, continuing until the second series of Space: 1999.\nAfter a career lull when a number of new series concepts failed to get off the ground, his career began a new phase in the early 1980s when audience nostalgia for his earlier Supermarionation series (prompted by Saturday morning re-runs in Britain and Australia) led to new Anderson productions being commissioned.

Thirty-nine 13-minute episodes were produced, broadcast by Granada from February until November 1960.

The studio suggested Raven, Shark, Squid, Vulture, Tarantula, Snipe, Sphinx, Dooom, and Maggot (the last used in early scripts). Although no legal action took place, the name \"WASP\" was used in the feature version To Trap a Spy. The original pilot kept THRUSH (presumably since it was not intended to be released to the public in that version). Felton and Rolfe pushed for the reinstatement of \"THRUSH\". It turned out that WASP could not be used, since Gerry Anderson's British television series Stingray was based on an organization called W.A.S.P. (World Aquanaut Security Patrol). By May 1964, THRUSH was retained for the television episode edit of the pilot.

The hand with the match was, until sometime in the sixth season, that of creator Bruce Geller; in the revival series, the hand belonged to Peter Graves, who was shown holding the match. Several British teleseries produced by Gerry Anderson and his then wife Sylvia Anderson, the contemporaneous Thunderbirds (made in 1964) and the mid-1970s Space: 1999 (which starred Mission: Impossible alumni Martin Landau and Barbara Bain) amongst them, also showed clips in the opening sequence. The reimagined Battlestar Galactica TV series also used this device. The clips in the opening sequence were chosen to showcase dramatic moments in the upcoming mission, such as moments of surprise, moments of violence, or equipment in use. In particular, the first clip shown was often someone getting punched and/or knocked out. For the first two seasons, the closing credits showed clips from that mission in freeze frame.

In later life, he said that he invented the term to increase the \"respectability\" of puppetry, a medium that he had not originally intended to work with. According to Sylvia, the productions were described as \"Supermarionation\" to distinguish them from traditional puppet theatre. Noting that a major disadvantage of APF's marionettes was their inability to walk convincingly, commentators have argued that the term expressed Gerry's preference for artistic realism and his wish to make the company's puppet techniques more lifelike.Garland, p.\u00a065.", "The term was coined in 1960 by Gerry Anderson.Hearn, p.\u00a020. Sources describe Supermarionation as a style of puppetry,Sangster and Condon, pp.\u00a0726-727. a production technique or process,O'Neill, p.\u00a04. or a promotional term. Emma Thom of the National Science and Media Museum defines it as APF's use of electronics to synchronise puppets' lip movements with pre-recorded dialogue. According to Jeff Evans, it \"express[es] the elaborate style of puppetry\" used in APF's productions. Anderson denied that the term referred to a process, stating that he coined it as a promotional tool to separate APF's output from other children's puppet series like Muffin the Mule and Flower Pot Men. This was motivated by his embarrassment in working with puppets as opposed to live actors, and his wish to dispel the notion that APF's marionettes were \"the sort of puppets that were used in pre-school programmes\".Hearn, p.\u00a032. He also likened Supermarionation to a \"trademark\". According to Sylvia Anderson, the term was used to \"distinguish the pure puppetry of the stage from our more sophisticated filmed-television version\". Lou Ceffer of the website Spy Hollywood calls Supermarionation a \"marketing term\".", "A 1960s supplement of the British trade newspaper Television Mail described Supermarionation as a \"technical process\" whose main features, besides electronic puppet control, were use of 35\u00a0mm colour photography, -scale filming stages, back projection, live-action inserts and live action-style special effects, and video assist to guide the crew. According to Chris Bentley, the term encompasses \"all of the sophisticated puppetry techniques\" used by APF \u2013 the foremost being the automatic mouth movement \u2013 \"combined with the full range of film production facilities normally employed in live-action filming\" (such as front and back projection, location shooting and visual effects).Bentley, p.\u00a048. Other commentators have cited the complexity and detail of the puppets, models and sets as aspects of Supermarionation. Marcus Hearn states that the term reflected Gerry Anderson's desire to \"promote his company's collective ingenuity as a proprietary process\" and \"[ally] his productions with Hollywood photographic techniques such as CinemaScope and VistaVision.\" He adds that it \"encompassed the full panoply of APF's expertise \u2013 production values in model-making, photography, special effects, editing and orchestral music that had never been so consistently applied to any type of children's programme, let alone those featuring puppets.\"Hearn, pp.\u00a020; 33.", "Gerry Anderson's first experience with puppet filming was in 1956, when Pentagon Films \u2013 a group of five filmmakers including Anderson and his friend Arthur Provis \u2013 was contracted to make a series of Noddy-themed TV advertisements for Kellogg's breakfast cereal. Around this time, Pentagon also produced a 15-minute puppet film called Here Comes Kandy. These early efforts were noticed by children's author Roberta Leigh, who had written a collection of scripts titled The Adventures of Twizzle and was looking for a film company to turn them into a puppet TV series. By this time, Anderson and Provis had left Pentagon to form their own company, Anderson Provis Films (AP Films or APF). They accepted the commission, disappointed not to be working with live actors but realising that they needed Leigh's investment to stay in business. Before starting production, Anderson and Provis hired three staff: continuity supervisor Sylvia Thamm (former secretary at Pentagon and Anderson's future wife), art director Reg Hill and camera operator John Read. All three would later be made co-directors of the new company and play a significant role in the development of its productions.La Rivi\u00e8re 2014, pp.\u00a014-16.", "In a 1977 interview, Gerry Anderson said that the steps taken to make the puppets more lifelike were an attempt to \"make the [puppet] medium respectable\".

In 2006, Anderson stated that the transition to this genre \"wasn't a conscious move at all\", but rather a natural progression given the basic deficiencies of the puppets.

The change in puppet design has divided opinion, while the wisdom of making the protagonist \"indestructible\" has also been questioned. However, the series has been praised for its use of a multinational, multi-ethnic puppet cast and depiction of a utopian future Earth. A computer-animated reboot, Gerry Anderson's New Captain Scarlet, was first broadcast in 2005.", "As a result of the cancellation, Gerry Anderson was forced to come up with an idea for a new Supermarionation series. He had once been inspired by the thought of creating a live-action police drama in which the hero would have unexpectedly been murdered halfway through the series and replaced by a new lead character.Bentley 2001, p.\u00a014. Now giving fresh consideration to this idea, Anderson realised that a major selling point for his new production could be a character who is killed at the end of each episode and resurrected by the start of the next. This, coupled with contemporary theories about the possibility of life on Mars, led to the idea of an interplanetary war between Earth and its neighbour and a worldwide security organisation being called upon to defend humanity.Bentley 2001, p.\u00a05. After further thought, Anderson decided that \"Scarlet\" would be a suitably unusual name for this organisation's \"indestructible\" agent, while his partner in the field could be called \"Blue\". From this, Anderson reasoned that all personnel should have colour codenames and that the organisation should be called \"Spectrum\".Sellers, pp.\u00a0102\u2013103.

In all Anderson series prior to Captain Scarlet, the puppets' heads had been disproportionately large compared to the rest of their bodies as the cranium contained the solenoid that powered the automatic mouth movements. Scaling up the bodies to match the heads was not an option, as the puppets would have become too heavy to operate and there was not enough studio space to enlarge all of the sets.Archer and Hearn, p.\u00a0151.La Rivi\u00e8re 2009, p.\u00a0150.Bentley 2017, p.\u00a049. This gave the puppets a caricatured look that frustrated Gerry Anderson, who wanted their design to reflect natural anatomical proportions. Before Captain Scarlet entered production, Reg Hill and associate producer John Read created a new type of puppet with the solenoid built into the chest, thus enabling the heads to be scaled down to realistic size.Drake and Bassett, p.\u00a0203.La Rivi\u00e8re 2009, p.\u00a0151.", "Despite their realistic form, the new puppets were harder to animate on set, making the overall design ironically less lifelike than Gerry Anderson had intended.La Rivi\u00e8re 2009, p.\u00a0153. Compared to the Thunderbirds cast, the Captain Scarlet puppets had inferior weight distribution: when standing, characters often had to be held in place with clamps and tape to prevent wobbling. The smaller heads made close-up shots difficult to obtain, and because most of the wires were headmounted, significantly reduced the puppeteers' level of control, with the result that head movements and other actions became jerkier.La Rivi\u00e8re 2014, pp.\u00a0264\u2013265. To reduce the amount of movement required, characters were frequently shown standing on moving walkways or sitting at moving desks: for example, Lieutenant Green operates the Cloudbase computer from a sliding chair and Colonel White's desk rotates. Puppeteer Jan King commented:", "Gerry Anderson said that he pushed for the new design to satisfy the audience, regarding it not as \"a case of moving to a new technique, but more a case of incorporating new ideas with existing methods.\" However, in later years he expressed doubts about the wisdom of the redesign: \"[T]he problem was that exact and precise movements became more vital than ever and that caused us terrible difficulties.\"", "Francis Matthews, who supplied the voice of Captain Scarlet, had turned down offers to voice characters in Thunderbirds.Bentley 2001, p.\u00a023. According to Matthews, Gerry Anderson went to great lengths to cast him after being impressed by his imitation of Cary Grant in a radio programme, and indeed the actor based the voice of Scarlet on Grant's Mid-Atlantic tones.Archer 1993, p.\u00a043. Anderson, however, stated in his biography that the Grant impression was Matthews' choice at audition, and that while it was not the voice that had been intended for Scarlet the production was happy to use it.Archer and Hearn, p.\u00a0153.", "The music for Captain Scarlet was composed by Barry Gray, who had scored all prior Supermarionation series. The opening theme \u2013 titled \"The Mysterons\" \u2013 was produced electronically and accompanied by a seven-note staccato drumbeat to introduce the protagonist, Scarlet.Bentley 2001, p.\u00a040.

Looking back on it, however, I can see that what he came up with worked very well.\"La Rivi\u00e8re 2014, p.\u00a0266. The drumbeat also had two other functions: to cut from one scene to another, with the shot alternating between the previous scene and the next in time with each beat; and to cut into and out of each episode's midpoint advert break, where it was accompanied by a zooming image of the Spectrum logo (a stylised \"S\" on a background of concentric rings in the colours of the rainbow).Archer and Hearn, p.\u00a0156.", "In 1967, Century 21 Records (a label founded by Century 21 and Pye Records) released an extended play titled TV Themes from Captain Scarlet, which included commercial re-recordings of the series' opening and closing theme music.Bentley 2017, p.\u00a0139. The soundtrack has since had two CD releases: the first by Silva Screen Records, the second by Fanderson, the official Gerry Anderson fan club. Fanderson's version was available exclusively to club members and contained music from every episode except \"The Heart of New York\" and \"Treble Cross\" (which contain no original music) and \"Traitor\" (whose cue recordings are lost). Both CD releases' tracks are listed below.", "Although Thunderbirds had run for two series, Grade's unexpected cancellation of that production led Gerry Anderson to assume that there was no possibility of Captain Scarlet lasting more than one.Drake and Bassett, p.\u00a0280.

I simply went to Lew and asked, 'What's the next thing you want us to do?Archer and Hearn, p.\u00a0166.", "To others, Captain Scarlet remains a \"camp classic\". According to Bould, it is one of several Anderson productions to depict \"a utopian future benefiting from world government, high technology, ethnic diversity, and a generally positive sense of Americanisation. They articulate the commonly made connection between technological developments and economic prosperity.\" He also writes that the series espouses \"Euro-cool consumerism\". A recurring concept in the Supermarionation productions, world government was inspired by Gerry Anderson's thoughts on the subject: \"I had all sorts of fancy ideas about the future\u00a0... we had the United Nations and I imagined that the world would come together and there would be a world government.\"Cull 2006, p.\u00a0121. On the depiction of technology, Peter Wright notes the \"qualified technophilia\" that Captain Scarlet shares with Thunderbirds.", "Considered a cult programme by some,Sellers, p.\u00a0109. Captain Scarlet came 33rd in a 2007 Radio Times poll to determine the greatest science fiction series of all time. It was ranked 51st in Channel 4's 2001 list show 100 Greatest Kids' TV Shows. Cornell, Day and Topping argue that the series is perhaps Gerry Anderson's best production. However, Anderson's own verdict was clear: \"Nothing was as successful as Thunderbirds. Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons was very successful, but once you've had a smash hit, everything tends to look less successful in comparison.\"", "Captain Scarlet has attracted both positive and negative commentary on its use of female and ethnic minority characters \u2013 an aspect that according to Daniel O'Brien gives the series a \"more cosmopolitan\" feel compared to Thunderbirds. During its 1993 re-run on BBC2, the series drew some criticism for its use of the codenames \"Black\" and \"White\" in reference to the benevolent Colonel White and the villainous Captain Black, which some commentators interpreted as a form of negative black-and-white dualism.La Rivi\u00e8re 2009, p.\u00a0160.

He believes that the episode \"Marineville Traitor\", which focuses on a hunt for an \"enemy within\", has an \"especially strong Cold War flavour\".
