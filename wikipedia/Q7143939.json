Although Hibs had a bigger support base than Dunfermline and had enjoyed success in the 1950s, the club was struggling. Hibs had narrowly avoided relegation in 1963 and were sitting in 12th place when Stein was appointed. The players noticed an immediate difference from previous managers as Stein took an active part in practice sessions. Stein built his defence around John McNamee, who had been discarded by Celtic, and Pat Stanton. In midfield he had Pat Quinn and Willie Hamilton, who were talented players but had under-achieved. Hamilton had problems with drinking and gambling, but he produced his best performances under Stein's guidance. Stein led Hibs to victory in the Summer Cup, their first trophy in ten years. Neil Martin scored regularly and was capped for Scotland under Stein."]}, {"page": "Ian St John", "response": ["He was managed by Bobby Ancell, and was part of a group of talented young players (also including Andy Weir, Willie Hunter, Pat Quinn and Sammy Reid) that were nicknamed the \"Ancell Babes\".Ancell's Babes: Steelmen, Sinners and the Saint, The Football Pink, 12 February 2019 His debut was against Dumfries side Queen of the South in an away fixture at Palmerston Park. St John scored a hat-trick for Motherwell in two minutes and 30 seconds against Hibernian in 1959, one of the fastest recorded in Scottish football history.

The \u00a392,000 cost of this work was financed by a small quote and the selling of two players, Pat Quinn and Ian St John. To minimise disruption to the smaller old stand, the steel frame was built over and behind it. Construction of the stand stopped 20 yards short of the south end, however, because a local resident successfully objected to a full-length structure because it would have restricted light to the garden and reduced the value of the property. By the time the property owner had decided to sell, Motherwell did not have the funds or will to complete a full-length main stand, leaving a section of the frame intact but unused to this day. The club instead bought the house and used it for their offices."]}, {"page": "List of Scotland international footballers", "response": ["|The Scottish Football Association archive credits the 3rd Scotland goal in the 9\u20133 match to Davie Wilson, and footage from the match (Footage #1 \u2013 2:05 and Footage #2 \u2013 1:29) appears to confirm this; most sources (and the contemporary commentary on the footage) credit the goal to Pat Quinn"]}, {"page": "Gerry Baker", "response": ["Baker signed with Scottish First Division club Motherwell, where he played as outside left, in December 1956.
