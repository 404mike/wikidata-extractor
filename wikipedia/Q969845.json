Related styles include ambient industrial (see below) and isolationist ambient."]}, {"page": "Blast beat", "response": ["There are instances of drummers incorporating blast beat patterns prior to the 1970s.  Drummer Bill Ward of Black Sabbath can be seen playing a brief blast beat in a 1970 performance of \"War Pigs.\"  Additionally, drummer Carl Palmer of the progressive rock super-group Emerson, Lake & Palmer briefly used a blast beat in the band's 1970 instrumental \"The Barbarian\". King Crimson's \"The Devil's Triangle\" from their 1970 album In the Wake of Poseidon also features an early example of proto-blastbeats in the later half of the song. However, the blast beat as it is known today originated in the European hardcore and grindcore scenes in the 1980s. Contrary to popular belief, blast beats originated from punk and hardcore music, not metal music.  DVD: ASIN: B002UD475Y.  In the UK punk and hardcore scene of the early 1980s there were many bands attempting to play as fast as possible. In 1985 emerging grindcore band Napalm Death replaced their former drummer Miles \"Rat\" Ratledge with Mick Harris, who brought to the band a whole new level of speed. Harris is credited with developing the term \"blast beat\", describing the fast notes played on the kick and snare. Harris started using the blast beat as a fundamental aspect of Napalm Death's early musical compositions. It was finally with Napalm Death's first full-length album Scum (1987) that blast beat started to evolve into a distinct musical expression of its own. Blast beats became popular in extreme music from the mid to late 1980s . The blast beat evolved into its modern form as it was developed in the American death metal and grindcore scene of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Pete Sandoval, drummer of Terrorizer (1986\u20131989) and later Morbid Angel (1984\u20132013), purportedly was the first to use blast beats in metronomic time (and not as arhythmic or non-metric white noise) and thus gave it a more useful musical characteristic for timekeeping."]}, {"page": "John Zorn", "response": ["In 1991, Zorn formed Painkiller with Bill Laswell on bass and Mick Harris on drums.Huey, S.

The two sides are very different, and the two taken together serve to bridge stylistic elements of heavy metal and punk rock.

After various personnel changes, demo recordings, and a period of dormancy, they had returned to activity in 1985 with a lineup of Nicholas Bullen (vocals, bass), Justin Broadrick (guitar), and Miles Ratledge (drums).  Around this time, Daz Russell, promoter of the club The Mermaid in Birmingham, had essentially made Napalm Death the punk \"house band\" of his club.Alex Mudrian, Choosing Death: The Improbable History of Death Metal & Grindcore, Bazillion Points, 2016, pp. 103.
