He explored and analyzed water chemistry from environments as diverse as the mid-ocean ridge hydrothermal vents to the polar oceans to remote rivers and lakes in South America, Africa, Siberia, and Tibet.  He and his students and colleagues in his lab measured more chemical elements at lower concentrations in water than had ever been done before.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society D, E, F", "response": ["| John Marmion Edmond||20/03/1986||27 April 1943 \u2013 10 April 2001"]}]}}
