These three stages are further divided into twelve parts of equal length. This symmetry contributes to the impression of completion, which has often been commented on. George Gissing, for example, when comparing Joe Gargery and Dan'l Peggotty (from David Copperfield), preferred the former, because he is a stronger character, who lives \"in a world, not of melodrama, but of everyday cause and effect.\"Cited by  G. B. Shaw also commented on the novel's structure, describing it as \"compactly perfect\", and Algernon Swinburne stated, \"The defects in it are as nearly imperceptible as spots on the sun or shadow on a sunlit sea.\"Cited by David Trotter, Introduction to Great Expectations, London, Penguin Books, 1996, p.vii A contributing factor is \"the briskness of the narrative tone.\"Cited in Dickens and the Twentieth Century, Gross, John and Pearson, Gabriel, eds, London, Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1962, p.199-211.", "Following Moynahan, David Trotter notes that Orlick is Pip's shadow. Co-workers in the forge, both find themselves at Miss Havisham's, where Pip enters and joins the company, while Orlick, attending the door, stays out. Pip considers Biddy a sister; Orlick has other plans for her; Pip is connected to Magwitch, Orlick to Magwitch's nemesis, Compeyson. Orlick also aspires to \"great expectations\" and resents Pip's ascension from the forge and the swamp to the glamour of Satis House, from which Orlick is excluded, along with London's dazzling society. Orlick is the cumbersome shadow Pip cannot remove.", "*  introduction by David Trotter"]}, {"page": "King Edward VII Professor of English Literature", "response": ["* David Trotter (2002)"]}, {"page": "David Trotter", "response": ["David Trotter (born 4 March 1986) is a former professional Australian rules footballer who played for the Kangaroos Football Club in the Australian Football League (AFL)."]}, {"page": "Open Humanities Press", "response": ["*Technographies edited by Steven Connor, David Trotter and James Purdon"]}]}}
