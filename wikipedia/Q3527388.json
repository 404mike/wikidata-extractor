His bulldog spirit was exemplified by the Union Jack tattooed on his arm.  He played in 23 Test matches between 1980 and 1988, but scored more than 50 runs only five times in 41 innings.  In 1990, Athey joined the rebel tour to South Africa.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "September 27", "response": ["*1957 \u2013 Bill Athey, English cricketer, footballer, and coach"]}, {"page": "1987 Cricket World Cup", "response": ["In the English reply, opener Tim Robinson was out LBW for a first ball duck. Bill Athey (58 from 103 balls, 2 fours) top-scored, and England were almost on target, when captain Mike Gatting (41 from 45 balls, 3 fours, 1 six) handed back the initiative with the loss of his wicket, going for a reverse sweep which ended a growing partnership of 69 runs in 13 overs between him and Athey. Allan Lamb (45 from 55 balls, 4 fours) also posted a great innings, but it was in vain as the required run-rate for England began to rise.

This generated much protest from Boycott supporters, who rallied, calling for his reinstatement at a meeting on 9 October in Ossett, Yorkshire. Bill Athey left the club at this time, and while Boycott in his biography maintained that he had no reason to believe that his actions had caused Athey's departure, Athey later stated to biographer Leo McKinstry that \"Boycott's attitude and the atmosphere he created had everything to do with my decision to leave Yorkshire.\" The \"Members 84 Group\", consisting of strong supporters of Boycott, met regularly to clamour for the batsman's reinstatement.McKinstry, pp. 240\u2013241. Their leader, Peter Briggs, stated \"Geoffrey Boycott is a giant playing among pygmies.\"Hopps, p. 241."]}, {"page": "Mike Gatting", "response": ["In 1987, Gatting gained notoriety in the \"Shakoor Rana affair\" when he argued with umpire Shakoor Rana in Faisalabad. He was accused of adjusting the field illegally, i.e. after the bowler had started running in, and warned. In fact, Gatting had been signalling to the long leg fielder to stop walking in, and the move was legal as it was not in the batsman's eyeline. Rana shouted 'stop, stop' and signalled dead ball, however, infuriating Gatting. Tempers were already frayed following a string of umpiring decisions that had gone against England, and the England team were unhappy that Rana was wearing a Pakistan sweater under his jacket. An on-pitch argument ensued, during the course of which Rana accused Gatting of breaking the rules and Gatting shouted 'We made the rules'. He had to be dragged away by Bill Athey. Rana refused to resume the match the following morning until Gatting delivered a handwritten apology, which he did under protest \u2013 eventually, the match was drawn due to bad light. The England hierarchy supported him, flying officials out to mediate with the board and deal with press relations. The Pakistan board supported Rana, naming him umpire for the deciding Test, from which position they only backed down when it was clear the England team would not play if Rana officiated, naming two other umpires. Indeed, the TCCB subsequently paid all players in the England party a \u00a31000 'hardship' bonus for the tour."]}, {"page": "Wicket-keeper", "response": ["This rule was sometimes suspended, by agreement with the captain of the batting side. For example, during the England\u2013New Zealand Test Match at Lord's in 1986, England's specialist keeper, Bruce French, was injured while batting during England's first innings. England then used four keepers in New Zealand's first innings: Bill Athey kept for the first two overs; 45-year-old veteran Bob Taylor was pulled out of the sponsor's tent to keep for overs 3 to 76; Bobby Parks, the Hampshire keeper, was called up for overs 77 to 140; and Bruce French kept wicket for the final ball of the innings."]}, {"page": "Yorkshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["* Bill Athey"]}, {"page": "John Emburey", "response": ["Politically, Emburey is a Conservative, and once appeared on stage at a Conservative Party conference in the 1980s alongside England teammate Bill Athey."]}, {"page": "English cricket team in Australia in 1986\u201387", "response": ["* Bill Athey (Gloucestershire)"]}, {"page": "Bob Taylor (cricketer)", "response": ["This would not be Taylor's last outing with the club, however. He captained Derbyshire Second XI in 1985 for eight games, though he did not keep wicket. Batting last in the order, he was rarely called on to bat. During New Zealand's 1986 Test match at Lord's, Taylor was present in the hospitality tent when Bruce French was injured by a Richard Hadlee delivery. After trialling Bill Athey behind the wicket, New Zealand captain Jeremy Coney permitted Taylor to come on the field to keep for the remainder of the day. Wisden recorded \"[Taylor] equipped himself with an assortment of borrowed kit, although he did, far-sightedly, have his own gloves in his car... Despite having retired from first-class cricket two years earlier, Taylor ... kept without a blemish.\" Bobby Parks was brought in to keep for the following day. Also in 1986, Taylor was selected as part of Brian Close's invitational XI to play New Zealand at Scarborough on 31 August. Taylor kept wicket, and scored 21 as well as taking two catches. He was part of Michael Parkinson's World XI in 1988, playing against the MCC where Taylor again kept wicket and scored four runs."]}, {"page": "Martyn Moxon", "response": ["The winter touring party for the trip to Australia in 1986/7 was far from settled in advance.  Chris Broad was recalled after a two-year absence, Wilf Slack brought back having missed all but one Test during the summer, and Bill Athey was included as an 'auxiliary' batsman.  The choice of two left-handers at the top of England's order highlighted the fact that Australia's big threat came from the battery of left arm seamers available to them, led by Bruce Reid.  In the event, Slack, out of form, played  no International cricket on the tour while Athey and Broad flourished as an opening pair, Broad going on to be named as the International Cricketer of the Season. Moxon had to wait until the last Test of 1987 for a recall.

By chance, former England wicket-keeper Bob Taylor, who had retired from first-class cricket, was in the hospitality tent.
