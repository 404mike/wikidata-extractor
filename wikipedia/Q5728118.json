Trenchard had witnessed mutinies among French troops during World War I, and was quite prepared to be ruthless in his dealings.Lamb, Dave 1919: The Southampton mutiny 2005  After speaking to the ineffective camp commandant and sizing up the situation, Trenchard marched out onto the docks and personally issued a loud summons for the men to assemble. He then informed the soldiers that he would hear their grievances but only after they had returned to their duties. This resulted in much heckling and Trenchard almost knocked over by the restless surging crowd. Leaving the scene in some disorder, he decided force would be needed, and arranged for 250 soldiers, including military policemen, to be sent to the docks.  Whilst they were en route, Sir Henry Sclater, the General Officer Commanding Southern Command, telephoned Trenchard in the middle of the night, and after hearing Trenchard's plan, insisted that Trenchard must under no circumstances order the security detachment to open fire on the mutineers. Trenchard replied that he was not seeking the G.O.C.'s approval, merely informing him of his intentions."]}, {"page": "List of Knights Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire", "response": ["**Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Sclater (1 January)"]}, {"page": "James Macklin", "response": ["On 16 September 1918 Macklin \"was presented to His Majesty [King George V] by Lieut.-General Sir Henry Sclater.
