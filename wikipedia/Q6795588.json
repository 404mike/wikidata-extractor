Stephenson had been staying at the hospital since 26 July and left on 7 December. His profession, and his private studies of the 'occult sciences', made him take a more than average interest in the evolving murder series. At the London Hospital the murders were, as elsewhere, the major subject of conversation. After witnessing one Doctor Morgan Davies performing a demonstration of how the murderer may have been subduing and killing the victims,Stewart P. Evans & Keith Skinner, The Ultimate Jack The Ripper Sourcebook, p. 669.  Stephenson found Davies' behaviour suspicious, and brought the story to George Marsh, an ironmongery salesman professing to be an amateur detective.Evans & Skinner, p. 671. George Marsh, on his side, found Stephenson to be the more suspicious character, and went to the Scotland Yard. One of the officers, Inspector Roots, immediately recognized the suspect by description as being a man he had known for 20 years \u2013 Robert Donston Stephenson: \"a travelled man of education and ability, a doctor of medicine upon diplomas of Paris and New York: a major from the Italian Army \u2013 he fought under Garibaldi: and a newspaper writer\".Evans & Skinner, p. 673. From Roots's report it may seem that Stephenson was cleared of suspicion without further ado. According to Maxim Jakubowski and Jonathan Braund \"it appears that his (Stephenson's) cultured manner and eagerness to assist the police with arcane knowledge evoked their admiration rather than their suspicion\".The Mammoth Book of Jack the Ripper, p. 448, Ed. Maxim Jakubowski and Nathan Braund.", "Stephenson later fell under the suspicion of newspaper editor William Thomas Stead, the writer Mabel Collins and her friend Baroness Vittoria Cremers. Cremers told Aleister Crowley that Stephenson was a doctor and had committed the Whitechapel murders as part of a magic ritual and that the sites of the murders, when joined together on a map, formed a calvary cross (which is untrue). The suspicion was not merely caused by Stephenson's preoccupation with \"black magic\". He had been, by his own account, in love with a prostitute, and had contracted venereal disease from others. The fact that Stephenson's wife seemingly disappeared in 1886 has led to the otherwise unsupported speculation that he may have killed her.The Mammoth Book of Jack the Ripper, p. 446, Ed. Maxim Jakubowski and Nathan Braund. According to Jakubowski and Braund, Stephenson claimed to have killed others, and that he was keeping ties stained with human blood, as well as being the owner of candles made from human fat.The Mammoth Book of Jack the Ripper, p. 449, Ed. Maxim Jakubowski and Nathan Braun. Collins and Cremers' theory was later resurrected by Richard Whittington-Egan in A Casebook on Jack the Ripper and subsequently developed by the author Melvin Harris in Jack the Ripper: The Bloody Truth and its two sequels. Crime writer Colin Wilson praised the research done by Harris but concluded it didn't prove any connection between Stephenson and Jack the Ripper.Colin Wilson, \"A Lifetime in Ripperology\", in The Mammoth Book of Jack the Ripper, p. 421, Ed. Maxim Jakubowski and Nathan Braund. Jakubowski and Braund state that the major problem with Stephenson as a suspect is that the idea is heavily reliant on his own testimony, both as to \"the depth of his heartlessness and iniquity and as to his activities\". Whilst Cremers, the principal witness, was closely linked to Aleister Crowley and Stephenson's \"air of mystery and his somewhat theatrical, throwaway boast of wickedness\" seem to anticipate Crowley's own romancing, the statements about blood and candles may have been theatrical props specifically designed to have the effect which they had \u2013 to frighten two impressionable women.The Mammoth Book of Jack the Ripper, p. 449, Ed.

With the third issue, the magazine adopted the standard little-magazine format of the time: A4 pages, card cover, stapled. Alembic 3, 4 and 5 also marked a more self-conscious engagement with contemporary London-based experimental poetry.jacket2.org/interviews/transatlantic-axis-alembic Alembic 3 (Spring 1975) announced the intention to engage with 'one area of contemporary creative practice' in each issue in order to represent the range of poetry being written in the UK.Alembic 3 This issue focused on contemporary work that had its roots in surrealism. It included Lee Harwood's essay 'Surrealist Poetry Today', which had been a talk given at the Poetry Society, and it included work by Harwood, Paul Matthews, Jeff Nuttall, Heathcote Williams and others. Alembic 4 was edited solely by Hampson and was dedicated to open field poetry and the idea of place. Allen Fisher was the featured poet: in addition to work by him, there was also an interview with him conducted by Barry and Edwards.

This issue was also the first to be offset. (Like Alembic 4. it had a wrap around cover rather than card.) Alembic 6 (Summer 1977)was again solely edited by Hampson. It included further work by contributors to earlier issues.

It included work by Jeremy Adler, Paul Buck, Herbert Burke, Paula Claire, cris cheek, Bob Cobbing, Glenda George, Robert Sheppard, E. E. Vonna-Michel, Lawrence Upton and others.
