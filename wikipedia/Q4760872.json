He was best known for his work with post-punk bands Level 9, Foreign Playground and German band Styffe. Kanavan also played briefly with Killing Joke, Enigma, The Maisonettes and Dire Straits. He was recognized as a very capable drummer, as showcased in concerts such as Larks in the Park. He was also a founding member of Mellow Yellow.A session musician, Kanavan drummed for Decca, Polydor and indie label Sabre, and became the drummer for the band Dream Cast on their ill-fated European tour, in which Dave Elliott (guitar), Chris Nichols (keyboards) and Helen Raven (vocals) died in a horrific traffic accident.\nBorn in Accrington, the former Royal Marine Officer built a reputation for his aggressive and rhythmic style of drumming. As a rock and soul drummer for bands both in Europe and the UK, Kanavan was never short of work. Following his brief spell of notoriety, Kanavan stepped away from the limelight in the early 1980s and began a new life as a music tutor in the South of England.\nFollowing the death of his wife on 11 August 1989, Blue Haze vocalist Barbara Mac, he lost his love of music. He would fail to show at concerts and was soon dropped by mainstream record labels and bands.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Accrington", "response": ["*Andy Kanavan, rock drummer with Dire Straits and Level 9 a.k.a.
