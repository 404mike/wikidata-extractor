He also writes the Thraxas series of fantasy novels under the pseudonym Martin Scott.\nThe novels he writes as Martin Millar dwell on urban decay and British sub-cultures, and the impact these have on a range of characters, both realistic and supernatural.  There are elements of magical realism, and the feeling that the boundary between real life and the supernatural is not very thick. Most of them are set in Brixton, Millar's one-time place of residence. Many are at least semi-autobiographical, and Love and Peace with Melody Paradise and Suzy, Led Zeppelin and Me both feature Millar himself as a character.\nAs Martin Scott his Thraxas novels are a fusion of traditional high fantasy and pulp noir thrillers.\nIn 2000, he won the World Fantasy Award for best novel with his book Thraxas.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Martin Millar (disambiguation)", "response": ["Martin Millar (born 1959) is a Scottish writer.", "Martin Millar may also refer to:", "* Martin Millar (Doctors)", "* Martin Millar (sport shooter), see 2002 Commonwealth Games results"]}, {"page": "Martin Scott (writer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Martin Millar"]}, {"page": "Millar, Martin", "response": ["#redirectMartin Millar"]}, {"page": "Martin Millar (writer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Martin Millar"]}, {"page": "Elbakin.net", "response": ["** Martin Millar : Kalix, le loup-garou solitaire"]}, {"page": "Acme Press", "response": ["Acme's relationship with Eclipse ended in 1992 (Eclipse would go defunct a year later), and Acme struck up a new arrangement with another up-and-coming American black-and-white publisher, Dark Horse Comics.
