Biographers agree that their marriage was in many ways a happy one; however, some have asserted that Albert Edward did not give his wife as much attention as she would have liked and that they gradually became estranged, until his attack of typhoid fever, the disease which was believed to have killed his father, in late 1871 brought about a reconciliation.Duff, p. 111, and Philip Magnus, quoted in Battiscombe, pp. 109\u2013110. This is disputed by others, who point out Alexandra's frequent pregnancies throughout this period and use family letters to deny the existence of any serious rift.Battiscombe, p. 110. Nevertheless, the prince was severely criticised from many quarters of society for his apparent lack of interest in her very serious illness with rheumatic fever.Hough, pp. 132\u2013134. Throughout their marriage Albert Edward continued to keep company with other women, including the actress Lillie Langtry, Daisy Greville, Countess of Warwick, humanitarian Agnes Keyser, and society matron (and great-grandmother of Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall) Alice Keppel. Alexandra knew about most of these relationships, and later permitted Alice Keppel to visit her husband as he lay dying.Battiscombe, p. 271, and Priestley, p. 18, 180.
