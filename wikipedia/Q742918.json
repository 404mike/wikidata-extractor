His best-known novel is Take Back Plenty (1990), winner of both major British science fiction awards, the 1990 British SF Association award and the 1991 Arthur C. Clarke Award, as well as being a nominee for the 1992 Philip K. Dick Award for the best original paperback published that year in the United States.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Michael Moorcock", "response": ["Moorcock is the subject of four book-length works, a monograph and an interview, by Colin Greenland. In 1983, Greenland published The Entropy Exhibition: Michael Moorcock and the British 'New Wave' in Science Fiction. He followed this with Michael Moorcock: Death is No Obstacle, a book-length interview about technique, in 1992. Michael Moorcock: Law of Chaos by Jeff Gardiner and Michael Moorcock: Fiction, Fantasy and the World's Pain by Mark Scroggins were published more recently.", "Moorcock talks about much of his writing in Death Is No Obstacle by Colin Greenland, which is a book-length transcription of interviews with Moorcock about the techniques in his writing.", "Most of Moorcock's earlier work consisted of short stories and relatively brief novels: he has mentioned that \"I could write 15,000 words a day and gave myself three days a volume. That's how, for instance, the Hawkmoon books were written.\" Over the period of the New Worlds editorship and his publishing of the original fantasy novels Moorcock has maintained an interest in the craft of writing and a continuing interest in the semi-journalistic craft of \"pulp\" authorship. This is reflected in his development of interlocking cycles which hark back to the origins of fantasy in myth and medieval cycles (see \"Wizardry and Wild Romance \u2013 Moorcock\" and \"Death Is No Obstacle \u2013 Colin Greenland\" for more commentary). This also provides an implicit link with the episodic origins of literature in newspaper/magazine serials from Trollope and Dickens onwards. None of this should be surprising given Moorcock's background in magazine publishing."]}, {"page": "Time Out of Joint", "response": ["Colin Greenland reviewed Time Out of Joint for Imagine magazine, and stated that \"As usual, Dick 's deadpan investigation of a paranoid world reveals more than a little of the unreal dimensions of our own 'safe' environments.\""]}, {"page": "Philip K.

A review in Orange Coast magazine stated that \"the distinguishing virtue of The Terminator is its relentless tension.

The review by Time Out called it \"a rather lame sci-fi love story\" which \"lacks the drive, energy and surprise which one associates with Carpenter.\" It continued \"The best special effects are in the first five minutes. Thereafter, it's all rather predictable. The normally excellent Bridges shuffles his way through a robotic performance as though he's just been unplugged, and the film's (very) basic gag \u2013 his na\u00efve response to what he experiences \u2013 wears thin pretty quick.\" Colin Greenland reviewed Starman for Imagine magazine, and stated that it \"starts well, with engaging performances from Karen Allen as the woman trying not to go crazy and Jeff Bridges as the man in the borrowed body.
