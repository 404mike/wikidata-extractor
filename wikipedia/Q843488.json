It is estimated that an acceptable rate of PULs that eventually undergo surgery is between 0.5 and 11%.

It was not until after reading of the findings by Louis Pasteur that Joseph Lister introduced the use of carbolic acid as an antiseptic, and in doing so, reduced surgical infection rates. Lawson Tait shifted the movement then from antisepsis to asepsis, instilling practices such as a strict no-talking policy within his operating room and drastically limiting the number of people to come in contact with a patient's wound.
