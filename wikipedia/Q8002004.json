He was born at Brighton, Sussex, and died at the rectory at Kimcote, Leicestershire.\nYoung was educated at Harrow School and as a right-handed middle-order batsman and a right-arm slow bowler he played in the socially important Eton v Harrow cricket match at Lord's in three seasons from 1883 to 1885. He went to Selwyn College, Cambridge University, and played in a trial match for the Cambridge cricket team, but did not make any first-team appearances. He appeared for Somerset in several matches in the 1889 and 1890 seasons: Somerset was at this point a second-class county, and the success of the side in 1890 was a material factor in its elevation to first-class cricket status for the 1891 season, when it was allowed to compete in the County Championship. Young only appeared twice in first-class matches for Somerset, once in each of the 1891 and 1893 seasons, and he did not bowl in either of them. His only runs came in the 1891 match: he scored 13 against Surrey. In his 1893 game against Lancashire he failed to score in either innings.He became a parson in the Church of England and his final post was as rector of Kimcote, where he died in 1947.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Old Harrovians", "response": ["*Wilfrid Young (1867\u20131947), English first-class cricketerHarrow, 1800\u20131911, p. 599"]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Wilfrid Young (1891\u20131893) 2 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Somerset County Cricket Club in 1890", "response": ["| Wilfrid Young || style=\"text-align:center\"| ||  || Right-handed || Right arm slow ||"]}, {"page": "Somerset County Cricket Club in 1891", "response": ["| Wilfrid Young ||  ||  || Right-handed || Right arm slow"]}]}}
