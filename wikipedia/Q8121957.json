He was a born sketcher, but made great strides in the technical knowledge of his art during his stay in Venice. The Rialto and the Interior of Sta. Maria dei Miracoli were fine specimens of the capabilities of water colour. In 1866 he travelled in Spain with Francis William Topham. The oriental character of Spain seems to have acted as a spur to his powers; his drawing of the Gates of the Alhambra was one of his most brilliant works. The Fair at Seville, with its lines of tents, clouds of dust, and picturesque horsemen; his Bull Ring at Seville, with its brutal crowd in the shade, and the blazing sunshine in the arena, suddenly raised his art from the tranquil portraiture of stately buildings and a pearly atmosphere to a higher and more imaginative level, and gained him his membership in the autumn of 1867. Every year he went to France, Germany, or Italy, and made elaborate studies of the subjects he meant to paint."]}, {"page": "Hugh Carter (painter)", "response": ["He was born in Birmingham on 4 March 1837, the son of Samuel Carter, a railway solicitor.
