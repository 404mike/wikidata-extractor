A long paragraph detailing errors in names concludes with Elstein noting: \"Two of those whose names are mis-spelled are amongst the twelve people thanked for reading drafts of the book\". His review finishes by stating, \"Yet surely what we need from a professor of media history is a degree of accuracy, respect for the facts, ability to check detail, detachment and sound judgement, all of which Pinkoes and Traitors so lamentably lacks. Let us hope her successor as BBC historian serves us better.\"Elstein, David.\"'Pinkoes and Traitors': a tunnel vision of broadcasting history\", Open Democracy, 20 March 2015. Responding to Elstein's criticisms in her own article for openDemocracy, Seaton acknowledged: \"Elstein does point to a number of inaccuracies in my book; they are my responsibility, and deeply regretted. [\u2026] Independently, I owe Stewart Purvis an apology. Just after Lady Diana\u2019s engagement, tabloid papers were blazoned with pictures of her in a low-cut dress which they said exposed a nipple. ITN, edited by him, ran a story showing that it was the shadow of her bouquet falling on her chest \u2013 not a nipple. In the last edit of the book I garbled the story and the key word \u2018not\u2019 was cut. I welcome the opportunity to correct these errors, and others, in a revised edition of the book this autumn\". However, she challenged at length other aspects of Elstein\u2019s article, saying \"The wonderful thing about David Elstein\u2019s ferocious review of Pinkoes and Traitors is that his agenda, pursued single-mindedly for over 30 years, is so transparent. He wants the BBC to be smaller or broken up or reorganised. He is in favour of anything that damages the BBC and crushes its universality. Above all he wants it financed by individual subscription for specific services. This would be the end of the BBC. His urge to say ITV was always better, first, superior, pristine in the past, is in his hands another aspect of the same argument\". Elstein has since written a further openDemocracy article, rejecting Seaton\u2019s claims about him."]}, {"page": "List of honorary graduates of the University of Exeter", "response": ["* Stewart Purvis (LLD)"]}, {"page": "British Academy Television Award for Best News Coverage", "response": ["| ITV Royal Wedding Coverage || Jim Pople, Stewart Purvis and the Production Team", "| Channel 4 News || Stewart Purvis and the Production Team", "| Channel 4 News || Stewart Purvis and the Production Team", "| rowspan=\"7\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|1987 || style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\"|Channel 4 News || style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\"|Stewart Purvis", "| rowspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|1988 || style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\"|Special Edition Of Channel 4 News: Coverage of the Zeebrugge Disaster || style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\"|Stewart Purvis", "| Channel 4 News || Richard Tait, Stewart Purvis"]}]}}
