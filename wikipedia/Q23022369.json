Marcus's arguments would prove exceptionally influential, including claims that the master-concept of Nicholas Nickleby was a hostility to \"prudence\"; that the abstract principle governing Dombey and Son was resistance to change and temporal decay; that Sam Weller cagily subverts the idealizing morality of Mr. Pickwick; and that Oliver Twist makes its most incisive political indictments through \"satiric innocence\", or a position of non-partisan humanity. Though immediately recognized as an eminent work of Dickens criticism, From Pickwick to Dombey was widely criticized for an over-reliance on Freudian concepts, a tendency that academic reviewers called \"facile\",Edgar Johnson, Nineteenth-Century Fiction 20.4 (1966): 399. \"deeply flawed\",Harry Stone, \"Critic of the Hour\", Kenyon Review 27.3 (1965): 518. and, according to Barbara Hardy, \"rigidly orthodox\" and \"tactless\".Barbara Hardy, Victorian Studies 9.3 (1966): 207.
