In common with the other Sinn F\u00e9in members elected, he did not take his seat in the short-lived new Commons, sitting instead in the revolutionary Second D\u00e1il.\nDerham was re-elected as a Pro-Treaty Sinn F\u00e9in candidate at the 1922 general election, and as a candidate for the new Cumann na nGaedheal party at the 1923 general election. He died suddenly aged about 35, less than three months later, in November, triggering D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann's fourth-ever by-election, which was won on 19 March 1924 by the Cumann na nGaedheal candidate, Batt O'Connor.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
