Having just lost two-key players of Michail Antonio and Connor Wickham, along with the possibility of Giles Coke being out for a longer amount of time, manager ave Jones made three loan signings over the last two-days of the emergency loan window. Firstly, Hull City experienced midfielder Seyi Olofinjana was signed until the end-of-the-season, and then one of Bolton Wanderers' star men, Stuart Holden, signed for one-month having just come back from injury and looking for some game time. Then just a few-minutes later it was confirmed forward Steve Howard had been signed for the rest of the season on loan from bottom of League One side Hartlepool United. The signing of Howard was by far the strangest as the 36-year-old has been unable to even break into the Hartlepool side, who were bottom of the league below Sheffield Wednesday. The Easter weekend came and the Owls faced local rivals and also a mighty relegation battle against Barnsley, who were in very good form. It was seen as the biggest game of the season so far, with the crowd amounting to the highest attendance of the season so far at Hillsborough. The game started with both teams fired-up and looking for the win. Leroy Lita had an early goal correctly disallowed for offside, while the same then happened to Marlon Harewood at the other end, however he did not hit the target. Lita then had a goal mouth scramble eventually cleared away by Barnsley. Both teams had cancelled each other out in the first half and although they were both giving it their all in this clash, they both somehow needed to find more in order to try to get a winner. Into the second half and substitute Reuben Noble-Lazarus had a long-distance shot very well saved by Chris Kirkland. Another substitute by Barnsley, Jason Scotland, then had a chance as his shot was also well saved by Kirkland. Then soon after at the other end of the pitch, good link up play between Jermaine Johnson and Lewis Buxton saw a cross into the box met by Gary Madine who tapped home a vital Sheffield Wednesday goal to give them the lead. Madine then had several shots within a few-seconds saved and blocked when there was another goal-mouth scramble in the box. Then with just over ten-minutes to go, plus stoppage time, a free-kick taken by Miguel Llera was launched into the box and R\u00e9da Johnson headed home to give Wednesday a fantastic two-goal lead. With six-minutes to go the Owls were then wrongly given a penalty for handball. Gary Madine stepped up but very poorly ended-up putting the ball wide. Three-minutes later and Lewis Buxton failed to stay ten-yards away when Barnsley were given a free-kick just outside the area. Buxton was shown a second yellow-card and was sent-off. There was six-minutes added time and in the second Jacob Mellis volleyed a ball into the far-corner to give Barnsley a chance of gaining something from the game. However, it was not to be and the game ended with a great chance for Barnsley just going wide, however the chance had been given as offside anyway."]}, {"page": "Hakeeb Adelakun", "response": ["He made 28 appearances and scored 2 goals in the 2013\u201314 season as Scunthorpe won promotion back to League One.
