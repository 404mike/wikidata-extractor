As a player, he was a competent wicket-keeper and lower-order right-hand bat. He played for Worcestershire between 1935 and 1946, having played once for Yorkshire in 1930. In 1939, he was severely injured in the car crash that killed Worcestershire opening batsman Charlie Bull, on the Sunday evening of the Whitsun match with Essex, and missed the next two months of cricket.\nHe made his debut as a first-class umpire in 1951. He umpired in 33 Tests between 1956 and 1969. He was awarded the MBE in 1965. In August 1970, Buller collapsed and died at Edgbaston, Birmingham, during a break for rain, when officiating in a match between Warwickshire and Nottinghamshire.\nA fearless umpire, he repeatedly called Geoff Griffin for throwing in the exhibition match staged following the early conclusion of the Lord's Test between England and South Africa in 1960, after Frank Lee had called him during the Test itself. This had the effect of ending Griffin's Test career.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 23", "response": ["*1909 \u2013 Syd Buller, English cricketer and umpire (d. 1970)"]}, {"page": "Wes Hall", "response": ["Perhaps Hall's greatest performance of the English summer was in the second Test at Lord's. On the final day of the Test, Hall bowled unchanged for 200 minutes, broken only by the tea interval. As in the Tied Test in Brisbane three years earlier, Hall found himself bowling the final over of the match with both sides still capable of winning. In the innings as a whole Hall bowled 40 overs for a return of 4/93 but despite Hall's brave efforts, England managed to hold on for a draw\u2014the England batsman Colin Cowdrey returned to the crease with a broken arm to help save the match. The Times said of Hall that day, \"His energy was astonishing, his stamina inexhaustible, his speed awesome, from the first ball to the last\". Hall himself claimed that it was his \"finest hour\".Smith, p. 124. There was a sour note in the final Test at The Oval when Hall was informally warned about intimidatory bowling. Hall bowled two successive bouncers to the England opening batsman Brian Bolus, prompting umpire Syd Buller to speak with West Indies captain Worrell saying, \"We don't want this sort of bowling to get out of hand otherwise I will have to speak to the bowler.\" Later than innings, Griffith was formally warned by the same umpire."]}, {"page": "List of Test cricket umpires", "response": ["|Syd Buller||||33||1956||1969"]}, {"page": "Rest of the World cricket team in England in 1970", "response": ["Wisden commented that, with England having been completely outclassed in this opening match, \"few could have expected the four following games to be so closely contested\". The match started, unusually, on a Wednesday so that the Thursday could be a \"rest day\" for the general election. The outstanding performer was Gary Sobers who had first forged a bond between his multi-national players so that they became a formidable team rather than, as some had predicted, a collection of star-name individuals. Sobers then destroyed England's batting on the first morning, taking six for 21. Ray Illingworth batted well for a defiant 63 but, overall, it was a disastrous batting performance with England sorely missing the absent Geoff Boycott and John Edrich. Eddie Barlow with 119 demonstrated the sort of concentration that Boycott and Edrich might have provided. On Friday afternoon, Sobers and Intikhab Alam scored 197 together in the final two and a half hours of the day, the World XI completing a massive first innings lead of 419 on Saturday morning. England did better in their second innings and Illingworth fell (to Sobers) six short of a well-deserved century. Intikhab took the bowling honours with six for 113 and England were well beaten by an innings and 80 runs with a whole day to spare. Umpire Syd Buller, who died suddenly on 7 August, officiated in his last international match."]}, {"page": "Harold Rhodes (cricketer)", "response": ["Although facing strong competition from bowlers such as Brian Statham and Fred Trueman, Rhodes might have expected to play many more Tests. But doubts about the legality of his bowling action emerged, and in the 1960 season, playing for Derbyshire against the South Africans, he was \"called\" for throwing \u2013 bowling the ball with a bent arm that straightens in the delivery \u2013 by the umpire and former Test batsman, Paul Gibb. Later in the 1960 season, he was no-balled again by Gibb, and by Syd Buller. He took 78 first-class wickets in the season and took two five wicket innings."]}, {"page": "Geoff Griffin", "response": ["In the exhibition match, despite its informal nature, the umpires Lee and Syd Buller chose to apply the Laws of cricket strictly. Bowling  at half-pace from a shortened run, Griffin was no-balled by Buller for throwing on four occasions. When the South African captain, Jackie McGlew, remonstrated, Buller replied: \"We are playing to the Laws, which I must abide by\". Griffin was allowed to finish the over by bowling underarm, but was then pedantically no-balled again by Lee, standing at square leg, for failing to notify him of the change of action.    These events provoked both great sympathy for the player and contempt for the authorities. The South African writer Louis Duffus challenged Buller's intransigency concerning the Laws; the exhibition  match, he said, was being played outside the \"strict tenets of play\", because of the arrangement that every player was required to bowl. McGlew later wrote: \"My own feeling at that moment was that cricket, its laws and their application, had been reduced to complete and utter farce.\"  There was general anger that the South African management had exposed Griffin to the Lord's Test, given the high likelihood of an incident; the management's response was to blame the press for stirring up the trouble."]}, {"page": "Throwing (cricket)", "response": ["Twenty-one-year-old South African Geoff Griffin, who had already been called when playing for Natal, was called in May 1960 while playing against MCC at Lords and his test career was ended by umpire Frank Lee who called him four times during the Second Test. Remarkably he claimed a hat trick during the test but South Africa lost by an innings, prompting an exhibition match to be staged as the Queen was due to visit the ground. Griffin was called by umpire Syd Buller, ending an over bowling underarm when he was no-balled again for not informing the umpire of a change of action."]}, {"page": "1960 English cricket season", "response": ["South Africa toured England, playing a five match Test series which England won 3\u20130. During the series there was a throwing controversy which saw umpire Frank Lee call South African fast bowler Geoff Griffin for throwing in the Lord's Test. This led to umpire Syd Buller repeatedly calling the Griffin for throwing in the following tour match. This had the effect of ending Griffin's Test career and of bringing to a head worldwide discontent about throwing and \"dragging\" that had caused controversy for the previous two years."]}, {"page": "Buller", "response": ["* Syd Buller (1909\u20131970), English Test cricket umpire"]}, {"page": "Frank Lee (cricketer)", "response": ["His most controversial Test match was the game at Lord's in 1960 between England and South Africa when he no-balled the South African fast-medium bowler Geoff Griffin 11 times for throwing. He and other umpires had already called Griffin for throwing earlier in the season, but this was the first time a touring team bowler had been called in a Test match. When the Lord's Test ended early, Lee's fellow umpire Syd Buller called Griffin again in the \"friendly\" match that was arranged to fill in the time, and the action of both umpires was instrumental in ending Griffin's career and in bringing to a head the problems of throwing and dragging that had affected international cricket for several years."]}, {"page": "Hugo Yarnold", "response": ["Yarnold was a diminutive lower-order right-handed batsman and a wicketkeeper who played for Worcestershire. He made his first-class debut in an end-of-season match in the 1938 season as the deputy for Syd Buller, who would later be an umpiring colleague.  He was then Buller's replacement for two months of the 1939 season after Buller was seriously injured in the car crash that took the life of opening batsman Charlie Bull during the Whitsun match with Essex."]}, {"page": "John Aldridge (cricketer)", "response": ["Aldridge was capped by Worcestershire in 1959, and was used alongside Derek Pearson and Coldwell as a regular seam attack to support Flavell. Aldridge had his best season in terms of wickets, taking 68 wickets at an average of 23.63. Worcestershire's bowling attack, however, proved controversial as in different matches first Pearson and then Aldridge were no-balled by the leading umpire Syd Buller for throwing the ball; Buller was a leading figure in a campaign in the 1959 and 1960 seasons to eradicate throwing from first-class cricket following the controversial tour of Australia in 1958\u201359. Pearson's bowling action had been subject to scrutiny before (he was no-balled for throwing in 1954 as well), but Aldridge was then no-balled twice in the game against Leicestershire at Kidderminster."]}, {"page": "Bernard Quaife", "response": ["By 1937, Syd Buller had taken over behind the stumps for Worcestershire, and Quaife was coming under pressure from other, younger players. He retired at the end of the season, although he acted as captain for a large number of games in the absence through illness of usual captain Charles Lyttelton for most of the summer."]}, {"page": "Charlie Bull", "response": ["Bull played 15 times in 1938, but passed 50 only three times and scored under 500 runs in the season. In late May 1939, during the weekend of the match against Essex at Chelmsford, he was killed in a car accident which also left his team-mate Syd Buller injured."]}, {"page": "Derek Pearson", "response": ["Pearson's career was at times controversial. He was called for throwing in his second match in 1954, and in the opening match of the 1959 Indian tour, he was no-balled five times by umpire Syd Buller on the first day. He was no-balled again once in a County Championship match three weeks later, and then twice more in a match in 1960."]}, {"page": "John Jewell (Worcestershire cricketer)", "response": ["A right-handed middle-order batsman, Jewell played in the first first-class match of the West Indies tour, scoring 4 and 24 and taking two catches as Worcestershire won the match inside two days. His only other first-class game was the Whitsuntide match against Essex at Chelmsford in the middle of which the Worcestershire opening batsman Charlie Bull was killed in a car crash and the wicketkeeper Syd Buller was severely injured. Worcestershire's two innings in the match both came after the tragedy, and were unsurprisingly unsuccessful; Jewell scored 2 and 0, and did not play first-class cricket again."]}]}}
