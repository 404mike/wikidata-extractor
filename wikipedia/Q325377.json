He is best known as a promoter and manager of bands the New York Dolls and the Sex Pistols.\nBrought up unconventionally by his grandmother after his father, Peter, left the family home, McLaren attended a number of British art colleges and adopted the stance of the social rebel in the style of French revolutionaries the Situationists. McLaren realised that a new protest style was needed for the 1970s,which he supplied fashions from the Chelsea boutique SEX, which he operated with girlfriend Vivienne Westwood. After a period advising the New York Dolls in the U.S., McLaren managed the Sex Pistols, for which he recruited the nihilistic frontman Johnny Rotten. The issue of a controversial record, \"God Save the Queen\", satirising the Queen's Jubilee in 1977, was typical of McLaren's shock tactics, and he gained publicity by being arrested after a promotional boat trip outside the Houses of Parliament.\nMcLaren performed with acclaim as a solo artist, initially focusing on hip hop and world music and later diversifying into funk and disco, the dance fashion for \"voguing\" and merging opera with contemporary electronic musical forms. When accused of turning popular culture into a cheap marketing gimmick, he joked that he hoped it was true. His first album, Duck Rock  was certified silver in the U.K. and spawned 2 top-10 singles: \"Buffalo Gals\" and \"Double Dutch\".\nIn his later years, he lived in Paris and New York City, and died of peritoneal mesothelioma in a Swiss hospital.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 8", "response": ["*2010 \u2013 Malcolm McLaren, English singer-songwriter (b. 1946)"]}, {"page": "January 22", "response": ["*1946 \u2013 Malcolm McLaren, English singer-songwriter and manager (d. 2010)"]}, {"page": "Leonard Peltier", "response": ["It was reported by Joseph Corr\u00e9 that the last words of his father, Malcolm McLaren, were \"Free Leonard Peltier\"."]}, {"page": "Marley Marl", "response": ["Marley's career started with an interest in electronica. As a young intern at Unique Recording Studios in the early 1980s, he had an opportunity to experiment with very expensive samplers like the Fairlight CMI. One day during a studio session with an artist named Captain Rock he discovered sampling by accident. \"I was actually trying to get a riff off of a record. I made a mistake and got the snare in there before the sound came. I was truncating the vocal part but the snare was playing with the beat \u2014 we was truncating while the beat was playing. Thank God the beat was playing, because it probably wouldn't have happened if the beat wasn't playing. So I was playing it and the snare sounded better than the snare that I had from the drum machine when I was popping it.\"A short time later pioneering hip-hop radio DJ Mr. Magic heard Marley Marl's remix of Malcolm McLaren's Buffalo Gals, leading to Marley becoming his DJ. They eventually started the hip-hop collective the Juice Crew together in 1983. 1986 saw the foundation of Cold Chillin' Records, where Marley served as in-house producer for many projects. He earned $250,000 per year for his production work.

In the early 1980s, new wave acts embraced a crossover of rock music with African and African-American styles. Adam and the Ants and Bow Wow Wow, both acts with ties to former Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren, used Burundi-style drumming. Talking Heads' album Remain in Light was marketed and positively reviewed as a breakthrough melding of new wave and African styles, although drummer Chris Frantz said he found out about this supposed African influence after the fact. Second British Invasion acts were influenced by funk and disco.", "Between 1976 and 1977, the terms \"new wave\" and \"punk\" were used somewhat interchangeably. Music historian Vernon Joynson said new wave emerged in the UK in late 1976, when many bands began disassociating themselves from punk. That year, the term gained currency when it appeared in UK punk fanzines such as Sniffin' Glue, and music weeklies such as Melody Maker and New Musical Express.Gendron, Bernard (2002). Between Montmartre and the Mudd Club: Popular Music and the Avant-Garde (Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press), pp. 269\u2013270.

The mid-1970s British pub rock scene was the source of many of the most-commercially-successful new wave acts, such as Ian Dury, Nick Lowe, Eddie and the Hot Rods, and Dr. Feelgood.Adams, Bobby. \"Nick Lowe: A Candid Interview\", Bomp magazine, January 1979, reproduced at .

In addition to the T-shirt, and leather jackets they wore ripped jeans and boots, typically Doc Martens. The punk look was inspired to shock people. Richard Hell's more androgynous, ragamuffin look\u2014and reputed invention of the safety-pin aesthetic\u2014was a major influence on Sex Pistols impresario Malcolm McLaren and, in turn, British punk style.Strongman (2008), pp. 58, 63, 64; Colegrave and Sullivan (2005), p. 78. (John D Morton of Cleveland's Electric Eels may have been the first rock musician to wear a safety-pin-covered jacket.)See  McLaren's partner, fashion designer Vivienne Westwood, credits Johnny Rotten as the first British punk to rip his shirt, and Sex Pistols bassist Sid Vicious as the first to use safety pins, although few of those following punk could afford to buy McLaren and Westwood's designs so famously worn by the Pistols, so they made their own, diversifying the 'look' with various different styles based on these designs. Young women in punk demolished the typical female types in rock of either \"coy sex kittens or wronged blues belters\" in their fashion.Habell-Pallan, Michelle (2012). \"Death to Racism and Punk Rock Revisionism\", Pop: When the World Falls Apart: Music in the Shadow of Doubt. p. 247-270.

Early female punk musicians displayed styles ranging from Siouxsie Sioux's bondage gear to Patti Smith's \"straight-from-the-gutter androgyny\".Strohm (2004), p. 188. The former proved much more influential on female fan styles.See, e.g., Laing (1985), \"Picture Section,\" p. 18. Over time, tattoos, piercings, and metal-studded and -spiked accessories became increasingly common elements of punk fashion among both musicians and fans, a \"style of adornment calculated to disturb and outrage\".Wojcik (1997), p. 122. Among the other facets of the punk rock scene, a punk's hair is an important way of showing their freedom of expression. The typical male punk haircut was originally short and choppy; the mohawk later emerged as a characteristic style.Wojcik (1995), pp. 16\u201319; Laing (1985), p. 109. Along with the mohawk, long spikes have been associated with the punk rock genre.", "After a brief period unofficially managing the New York Dolls, Briton Malcolm McLaren returned to London in May 1975, inspired by the new scene he had witnessed at CBGB.

Another Sex habitu\u00e9, Johnny Rotten, auditioned for and won the job. Adopting a new name, the group played its first gig as the Sex Pistols on 6 November 1975, at Saint Martin's School of Art, and soon attracted a small but dedicated following.Gimarc (2005), p. 22; Robb (2006), p. 114; Savage (1992), p. 129.

The quote has been incorrectly ascribed to McLaren (e.g., Laing [1985], pp. 97, 127) and Rotten (e.g., \"Punk Music in Britain\" , BBC, October 7, 2002), but Savage directly cites the New Musical Express issue in which the quote originally appeared. Robb (2006), p. 148, also describes the NME article in some detail and ascribes the quote to Jones. The band often provoked its crowds into near-riots. Rotten announced to one audience, \"Bet you don't hate us as much as we hate you!\"Quoted in Friedlander and Miller (2006), p. 252. McLaren envisioned the Sex Pistols as central players in a new youth movement, \"hard and tough\".Quoted in Savage (1992), p. 163.

Some of the first hip hop MCs called themselves punk rockers, and some punk fashions have found their way into hip hop dress and vice versa. Malcolm McLaren played roles in introducing both punk and hip hop to the United Kingdom. Hip hop later influenced some punk and hardcore bands, such as the Beastie Boys, Hed PE, Blaggers I.T.A., Biohazard, E.Town Concrete, The Transplants, and Refused.

From February 1976, Siouxsie, Severin and some friends began to follow an unsigned band, the Sex Pistols. Journalist Caroline Coon dubbed them the \"Bromley Contingent\", as most of them came from the Bromley area in south east London, a label Severin came to despise. \"There was no such thing, it was just a bunch of people drawn together by the way they felt and they looked\". They were all inspired by the Sex Pistols and their uncompromising attitude. When they learned that one of the bands scheduled to play the 100 Club Punk Festival, organised by Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren, were pulling out from the bill at the last minute, Siouxsie suggested that she and Severin play, even though they had no band name or additional members. Two days later, the pair appeared at the festival held in London on 20 September 1976. With two borrowed musicians at their side, Marco Pirroni on guitar and John Simon Ritchie (already commonly known as Sid Vicious) on drums, their set consisted of a 20-minute improvisation based on \"The Lord's Prayer\"."]}, {"page": "Sex Pistols", "response": ["The Sex Pistols originally comprised vocalist John Lydon (known at the time by his stage name \"Johnny Rotten\"), guitarist Steve Jones, drummer Paul Cook and bassist Glen Matlock. Matlock was replaced by Sid Vicious in early 1977. Under the management of Malcolm McLaren, the band attracted controversies that both captivated and appalled Britain. Through an obscenity-laced television interview in December 1976 and their May 1977 single \"God Save the Queen\", attacking Britons' social conformity and deference to the Crown, they popularised punk rock in the UK. It was banned not only by the BBC but also by nearly every independent radio station, making it the \"most heavily censored record in British history\".", "The Sex Pistols evolved from The Strand, a London band formed in 1972 with working-class teenagers Steve Jones on vocals, Paul Cook on drums and Wally Nightingale on guitar. According to a later account by Jones, both he and Cook played on instruments they had stolen. Early line-ups of The Strand\u2014sometimes known as The Swankers\u2014also included Jim Mackin on organ and Stephen Hayes (and later, briefly, Del Noones) on bass.Savage, Jon. England's Dreaming, pp. 77\u201379; Strongman, Phil, Pretty Vacant, p. 84.

McLaren's and Westwood's shop had opened in 1971 as Let It Rock, with a 1950s revival Teddy Boy theme. It had been renamed in 1972 to focus on another revival trend, the '50s rocker look associated with Marlon Brando. As John Lydon later observed, \"Malcolm and Vivienne were really a pair of shysters: they would sell anything to any trend that they could grab onto.\"Robb, John, Punk Rock, p. 83.

Jordan, the wildly styled shop assistant, is credited with \"pretty well single-handedly paving the punk look\".Robb, John, Punk Rock, p. 84.", "Pogoing aside, Vicious had been involved in a notorious incident during that memorable second night of the 100 Club Punk Special. Arrested for hurling a glass at The Damned that shattered and blinded a girl in one eye, he had served time in a remand centre\u2014and contributed to the 100 Club banning all punk bands.Robb, John, Punk Rock, pp. 217, 224\u2013225; Strongman, Phil, Pretty Vacant, pp. 137\u2013138.

He was the knight in shining armour with a giant fist.\" \"Everyone agreed he had the look,\" Lydon later recalled, but musical skill was another matter. \"The first rehearsals...in March of 1977 with Sid were hellish.... Sid really tried hard and rehearsed a lot\".Lydon, John, Rotten, p. 143. For a view that Vicious was a more competent bass player than his reputation would have it, see Strongman, Phil, Pretty Vacant, p. 117. Marco Pirroni, who had performed with Vicious in Siouxsie and the Banshees, has said, \"After that, it was nothing to do with music anymore.

Noting that \"[i]mage to the contrary, the Pistols were very serious about music\", he argues, \"the real rebel yell came from Jones' guitars: a mass wall of sound based on the most simple, retro guitar riffs. Essentially, the Sex Pistols reinforced what the garage bands of the '60s had demonstrated\u2014you don't need technique to make rock & roll.

He arranged a rehearsal studio in Denmark Street, London, where a three-piece band consisting of Hynde, Mal Hart on bass (he had played with Hynde and Steve Strange in the Moors Murderers), and Phil TaylorMiles, of Mot\u00f6rhead on drums played a selection of Hynde's original songs. Dave Hill was impressed and arranged a day at Studio 51 to record another demo. Although it was rough, he felt he had seen and heard enough \"star potential\" to suggest that Hynde form a more permanent band to record for his new label, Real Records. Hynde then formed a band composed of Pete Farndon on bass, James Honeyman-Scott on guitar, and Gerry Mcilduff on drums. This band, then without a name, recorded five tracks at Regents Park Studio in July 1978, including \"Stop Your Sobbing\". Shortly thereafter, Gerry Mcilduff was replaced on drums by Martin Chambers.

Key figures included DJ Kool Herc and Grandmaster Flash.  Cutting (alternating between duplicate copies of the same record) and scratching (manually moving the vinyl record beneath the turntable needle) became part of the culture, creating what Slate magazine called \"real-time, live-action collage.\"  One of the first mainstream successes of this style of remix was the 1983 track Rockit by Herbie Hancock, as remixed by Grand Mixer D.ST. Malcolm McLaren and the creative team behind ZTT Records would feature the \"cut up\" style of hip hop on such records as \"Duck Rock\". English duo Coldcut's remix of Eric B. & Rakim's \"Paid in Full\" Released in October 1987 is said to have \"laid the groundwork for hip hop's entry into the UK mainstream\".

In San Antonio, Vicious struck an audience member on the head with his bass; the audience member had antagonised Vicious, who responded by hitting him.

Ant regrouped with new members, including Marco Pirroni to release his second album Kings of the Wild Frontier (1980). It reached number one in the UK Album Chart, spawned three hit singles and the album was the UK number one selling album in 1981 (and the 48th best seller in 1980) and won Best British Album at the 1982 Brit Awards. He released his third and final album with the group, Prince Charming (1981), which spawned two UK number one singles \"Stand and Deliver\" and \"Prince Charming\".", "Ant approached Malcolm McLaren (the manager of The Sex Pistols) and asked him to manage the band.

I might have had a broken heart at the time, but Malcolm didn't leave me with nothing.  He mentored me. He said: 'Look, what do you want?' I said: 'I wanna sell millions of records', and he said, 'Well, you're going the wrong way about it.

However, his overall contribution to these songs has been disputed: Jones said in a 2011 interview he was \"tired of Matlock's claims that he had co-written some of the punk icon's biggest tunes\", stating that he himself had written as many songs as Matlock, whilst Matlock himself notes in his autobiography, I Was a Teenage Sex Pistol, that the band only wrote two songs after his departure. According to a 2014 interview, he played a big role in writing the songs that appeared on the album and Cook has stated that Matlock wrote most of the songs appearing on the album.
