Lenin wrote that the  Marxist concept of dictatorship meant an entire societal class holds political and economic control, within a democratic system.

Vladimir Lenin and the Bolsheviks saw the soviet as the basic organizing unit of society in a socialist system and at first supported this form of democracy. The soviets also played a considerable role in the February and October Revolutions. At that time, they represented a variety of socialist parties in addition to Bolsheviks. According to the official Soviet historiography, the first soviet was formed in May 1905 in Ivanovo (north-east of Moscow) during the 1905 Russian Revolution (Ivanovsky Soviet). In his memoirs, the Russian anarchist Volin claims that he witnessed the beginnings of the St Petersburg Soviet in January 1905. The Russian workers were largely organized at the turn of the 20th century, leading to a government-sponsored trade union leadership. In 1905, as the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905) increased the strain on Russian industrial production, the workers began to strike and rebel. The soviets represented an autonomous workers' movement, one that broke free from the government's oversight of workers' unions. Soviets sprang up throughout the industrial centers of Russia, usually organized at the factory level. The soviets disappeared after the Revolution of 1905, but re-emerged under socialist leadership during the Russian Revolution. Lenin argued for the destruction of the foundations of the bourgeois state and its replacement with what David Priestland described as an \"ultra-democratic\" dictatorship of the proletariat based on the Paris Commune's system."]}, {"page": "Titles of distinction awarded by the University of Oxford", "response": ["* David Priestland, Professor of Modern History"]}, {"page": "The Dawn of Everything", "response": ["While wondering whether a book that \u201chypothesizes confidently in the face of scant or confusing evidence, can be trusted\u201d, historian Daniel Immerwahr described the book as \u201ca work of dizzying ambition\u201d.
