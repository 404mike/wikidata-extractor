Two days later in his first match, Shrewsbury won 2\u20131 against Walsall to reach the third round of the EFL Trophy; he was the first manager to win on his Shrewsbury debut since Graham Turner in 2010. He brought in eight players in the January 2019 transfer window including Tyrese Campbell, Ro-Shaun Williams and Scott Golbourne. In early 2019, Ricketts lead the club to the fourth round of the FA Cup. The club's cup run ended at the hands of rivals, and one of Ricketts' former clubs, Wolverhampton Wanderers. Town were 2\u20130 up in the original tie at New Meadow with just under 20 minutes to play, but late goals from Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez and Matt Doherty took the tie to a replay at Molineux.

His solo goal on 11 April, in which he ran the length of the pitch to score the winner against Wolverhampton Wanderers, was his first since the Reading match and earned him the club's Goal of the Season award. According to The Guardian, \"It was not so much the 18-year-old's pace that impressed as his persistence in running at and then pressurising Wolves full-back Scott Golbourne into error, and the certainty with which he then slid the ball past the Wolves goalkeeper\". He finished the season with 43 appearances in all competitions, of which two-thirds were as a starter, and won the club's Young Player of the Season award."]}]}}
