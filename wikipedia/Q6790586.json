It was created by Chris Chibnall, who acted as an executive producer and wrote all 24 episodes, and produced by Kudos in association with Imaginary Friends Productions Ltd. The series is set in Broadchurch, a fictional English town in Dorset, and focuses on police detectives DI Alec Hardy (David Tennant) and DS Ellie Miller (Olivia Colman). The series features an ensemble cast that in addition to Tennant and Colman includes Jodie Whittaker, Andrew Buchan, Charlotte Beaumont, Arthur Darvill, Jonathan Bailey, Vicky McClure, Adam Wilson, and Matthew Gravelle.", "Matthew Gravelle was cast as Joe Miller, DS Miller's husband.  Gravelle auditioned along with many other actors for the role, but Chibnall has said the casting team early on considered Gravelle their top choice for the role. The producers knew this was a critical casting decision: whoever they hired to play Joe Miller would need to act with great power in the final episode, so they researched Gravelle's past acting roles and watched as many of his performances as they could find.

Sims' casting was finally revealed in late August 2014, when the media reported he was shooting scenes for series two. Actor Will Mellor character (alleged psychic Steve Connolly) and actress Vicky McClure character (journalist Karen White) do not return in series two. Actor Matthew Gravelle's return was never confirmed prior to airing.", "The production went to some length to keep actor Matthew Gravelle return a secret as well. His character, Joe Miller, confessed to the crime of murder at the end of series one, and there appeared to be no reason for Joe to return in series two. But Chibnall planned to bring Joe back, and include a major plot twist involving him. As late as January 5, his participation in series two remained unconfirmed. To keep Gravelle's presence a secret, he had to wear glasses and a wig and wear a hoodie while filming on location so that the public and press would not recognise him and link him to the programme. Gravelle also had to stay in a different hotel from the rest of the cast, and could not socialise with them after filming ended each day.", "Actor Matthew Gravelle took his role as the alleged murderer and possible paedophile Joe Miller very seriously. \"You don't want to get it wrong with whoever you're playing. You try to be as true to somebody who might actually be like that as possible,\" Gravelle said. \"Whatever happens, he's still ultimately not a good person and you've got to try and be sympathetic towards him just to see it from his point of view.\" He did not research paedophilia per se, but tried to discover research on individuals with pre-paedophiliac tendencies. He found there was little scientific research in the area. Gravelle was therefore forced to come up with his own rationales for Joe's crimes. \"The need to be loved was the root of it,\" he said. \"Joe had love but he didn't have the attention in the way that he got it from Danny. It's probably an ego thing. ... He's not working. It's a self-worth issue.\" Forced to stay apart from the rest of the cast to prevent the public or press from suspecting his involvement in series two, Gravelle used his sense of isolation to bring his character to life. Gravelle said he found that the key to his character in series two was desperation. Joe Miller, he said, sought spiritual relief in both series one and two out of a desperate bid to feel better about himself and his crime. His not-guilty plea in series two, Gravelle felt, was also motivated by desperation (rather than a months-long plan to expose the town's secrets)."]}, {"page": "List of American films of 2014", "response": ["|Christopher Spencer (director/screenplay); Richard Bedser, Colin Swash, Nic Young (screenplay); Diogo Morgado, Greg Hicks, Adrian Schiller, Darwin Shaw, Sebastian Knapp, Joe Wredden, Simon Kunz, Paul Marc Davis, Matthew Gravelle, Amber Rose Revah, Roma Downey"]}, {"page": "Juliet Ace", "response": ["| Mali Harries, Mared Swain and Matthew Gravelle"]}, {"page": "Broadchurch (series 1)", "response": ["* Joe Miller (Matthew Gravelle)\u00a0\u2013 Ellie's husband and father to 11-year-old Tom and 2-year-old Fred.

The scene had been suggested by Olivia Colman. During her first meeting with Chibnall and Featherstone to discuss her character, she asked, \"I just want to know, do we get him [the killer] and do I get to kick him in the balls?\" Although no such scene had been written, they assured her it would be included (assuming Ellie Miller was not the murderer). Actors Olivia Colman and Matthew Gravelle were kept apart before the scene was filmed as a means of heightening the tension between the two during their meeting. The scene called for Colman to attack Gravelle, who would fall to the ground and allow Colman to kick him in the back. Gravelle's back was fitted with safety padding, but Colman's performance was so intense that she kicked him too hard and Gravelle was bruised for three weeks.", "Visual clues to the killer's identity were given throughout the series. In the first episode, Mark Latimer walks along the Broadchurch High Street on his way to work in the morning. Director Strong asked actors Matthew Gravelle (Joe Miller) and Adam Wilson (Tom Miller) to improvise some father-son horseplay. Viewers could thus see Joe with his arm around Tom's neck, \"strangling\" him. The slug in the Miller household, first seen in episode two, is meant to indicate that there is something wrong the Miller family. Joe's visits to the skatepark in episodes three and six indicate not only his link to Danny Latimer but also his desire to be around young boys with whom he could form a relationship similar to the one he had with Danny.", "Actor Matthew Gravelle (who played murderer Joe Miller) was the second cast member to learn the killer's identity. Chibnall called to tell him two weeks before the final three scripts filmed. By this time, Gravelle was already on the set of another television production. Chibnall kept his revelation short, saying, \"It's you.\" Gravelle paused for about 20 seconds, and then said, \"Oh, brilllllliant.\" He was very enthused to be able to play what were going to be critical scenes at the end of the series. But he also admitted he had never guessed he was going to be the killer. Over the next few days, Chibnall and Gravelle had many long conversations to discuss Joe Miller's backstory and motivation, how to integrate the filmed performance with the upcoming performance, and how Gravelle could play the character going forward."]}, {"page": "2015 in British television", "response": ["| rowspan=\"2\" | =41 || Broadchurch || rowspan=\"2\" | 10.86 || 5 January || The debut of the second series of the drama, starring David Tennant and Olivia Colman.
