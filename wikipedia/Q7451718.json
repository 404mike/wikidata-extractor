Born in Whitburn, County Durham, in 1912, he was the seventh son born in his family, hence the name Septimus.He is often considered the best all round player in Leicester City's history and is also the club's longest serving player of all-time having been a player at the club for 19 years and 246 days, as well as captaining the club for 13 years (making him by far the club's longest serving captain).Smith spent his entire career at Leicester, starting in 1929 and ending in 1949. He made 373 competitive appearances for the Foxes, scoring 37 goals. However, he lost seven seasons of his career because of World War II, during which time he made a further 213 appearances and scored 48 goals during regionalised wartime football. Including these wartime appearances, his tally of 586 appearances makes him Leicester's second top appearance maker of all-time behind Graham Cross.Smith mentored former Leeds United and England manager Don Revie during his time at Leicester. Revie, who dedicated an entire chapter in his autobiography entitled \"What I Owe to Sep Smith\" claimed \"I'm proud now to think of how much time Sep spent passing on his Soccer knowledge to me. He played a big part in my shaping my career.\" He also referred to Smith as \"an extraordinary footballer,\" saying \"he could place the ball within an inch of a man's toe \u2013 [and] that when he lobbed the ball to his winger the opposing full back felt the ball graze his hair as he tried to strain his neck that extra inch, like a drowning man trying to lift his head out of the water.\"He was the guest of honour at the Leicester's final game at Filbert Street (the club's home for over 110 years) in April 2002 and a suite at Leicester's current home ground The King Power Stadium is named after him in recognition of his service to the club.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Leicester City F.C.", "response": ["*  Sep Smith 373"]}, {"page": "Don Revie", "response": ["He signed as a professional footballer for Leicester City in August 1944, choosing them ahead of local club Middlesbrough primarily due to the close links between Middlesbrough Swifts and Leicester City; he also worked as an apprentice bricklayer. Leicester originally thought him not good enough to turn professional, but he was taken under the wing of Leicester player Sep Smith who mentored Revie on many of his ideas about the game. Smith instructed Revie that \"When not in position, get into position; never beat a man by dribbling if you can beat him more easily with a pass; it is not the man on the ball but the one running into position to take the pass who constitutes the danger; and the aim is to have a man spare in a passing move. Soccer would then become easy.\" He played in the wartime league, before making his debut in the Football League on the opening day of the 1946\u201347 season, a 3\u20130 defeat to Manchester City, who would go on to win the Second Division that season. He showed good form at Filbert Street before breaking his right ankle in three places after a tackle from Tottenham Hotspur's Ron Burgess; the injury could have ended his career, but he recovered to full fitness within 19 weeks."]}, {"page": "2006\u201307 in English football", "response": ["*28 July 2006 \u2013 Sep Smith, 94, former Leicester City wing-half, and oldest living England international.Sep Smith Passes Away  FoxFanzine.com.
