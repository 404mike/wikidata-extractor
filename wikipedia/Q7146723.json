From 1794 to 1803 he was a Whig Member of Parliament for Kirkcudbright Stewartry.\nHe was the grandson  of Patrick Heron of Kirroughtrie,\nwho had been MP for the Stewartry from 1727 to 1741.\nHis mother Margaret was the daughter of John Mackie of Palgoun. He was educated at the University of Glasgow.He married Jean Home, in 1761, daughter of Henry Home, Lord Kames, but the couple were divorced in 1772.  In 1775, he married Lady Elizabeth Cochrane, daughter of Thomas Cochrane, 8th Earl of Dundonald,\nand cousin to the diarist James Boswell.\nHe was a founder of a bank in Ayr, Douglas, Heron & Company, which went bankrupt during the Credit crisis of 1772.\nHeron was elected unopposed at a by-election in March 1795 as the MP for the Kirkcudbright Stewartry, filling the vacancy caused by the death of Alexander Stewart. His election was the result of a deal brokered with the support of Henry Dundas whereby he was to alternate the seat with two others. However, Heron managed to keep the seat for himself and was re-elected unopposed in 1796. At the general election in July 1802, he faced a contest from the Tory candidate Montgomery Stewart, son of the Earl of Galloway. Heron was returned, but Stewart lodged a petition, and on 10 May 1803 the result was overturned in Stewart's favour by the Committee of the House of Commons which heard the case.The campaigns are recorded in three works by Robert Burns, now known as the Heron Ballads.  Burns was himself a supporter of Heron:\n\nAn' there will be trusty Kerroughtree,\nWhose honour was ever his law,If the virtues were pack'd in a parcel,\nHis worth might be sample for a'.\nHeron died on 9 June 1803, aged about 68. He was survived by only one child, a daughter Mary.  She had married John Maxwell, who changed his name to Heron-Maxwell when they inherited Mary's father's estates.\nThe following year he succeeded to his father's baronetcy, becoming Sir John Heron-Maxwell, 4th Baronet.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Kirkcudbright Stewartry (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|  Patrick Heron", "|  Patrick Heron  "]}, {"page": "Patrick Heron (disambiguation)", "response": ["Patrick Heron (1920\u20131999) was an English artist.", "Patrick Heron may also refer to:", "*Patrick Heron (died 1761), Scottish politician, MP for Kirkcudbright Stewartry 1727\u201341", "* Patrick Heron (1736\u20131803), Scottish politician and banker, MP for Kirkcudbright Stewartry 1795\u20131803", "*Patrick Heron (British Army officer) (c. 1690 \u2013 c. 1752), British Army officer", "*Patrick Heron (author) (1952\u20132014), Irish writer"]}, {"page": "Douglas, Heron & Company", "response": ["The nominal capital of the company was \u00a3150,000 or \u00a3160,000, of which \u00a396,000 was immediately subscribed.

While the disputing landholders were away at court in Edinburgh, the corn ripened and their wives had it cut down and fed it to the cattle of both properties, thus ending the dispute.McKerlie, p422", "In 1683, following the Covenanter insurrection in Scotland, Patrick Heron's son Andrew Heron (c.1617\u20131695) was fined 5000 Scottish merks by the Privy Council of Scotland for \"being at house and field conventicles, and intercommuning with, and resetting his son Patrick Heron a ring leader at (the battle of) Bothwell Bridge, and his son in law who had been likewise there\".Morton, p180 Andrew Heron was, however, allowed to keep both his life and his estate because, it seems, he had voluntarily admitted to the contact and pleaded ignorance of the law.  Conventicles were held around a stone called the Preacher's Stone in a field to the northeast of Kirroughtree House. The persecutions of nonconformists during this period, called 'the Killing Time', may have been a reason why many of the Heron family emigrated to Ireland around this time.", "The Revolution of 1688 ended the persecution of nonconformists and facilitated rising prosperity for the Heron family. The former fugitive and Bothwell \"ring leader\" Patrick Heron (1642\u20131721), accrued considerable wealth through raising cattle and exporting them to England. Each year from 1689 to 1691 it is recorded that he raised 1000 cattle in a park at Baldoon, south of Wigtown, and drove them to England via Dumfries for a handsome profit.Alistair Livingston \"January 2009 edit, Galloway Levellers\", Last of the Westland Whigs, http://westlandwhig.blogspot.com.au/2009/01/january-2009-edit-galloway-levellers.html.

After his father\u2019s 1695 death, Patrick Heron succeeded to Kirroughtree Estate and began to acquire additional land and enclose more parks for livestock, building dykes (dry stone walls) and planting trees around the landholdings. His prosperity enabled the building of the current Kirroughtree House and its dovecote,Morton, p181 but his enclosures also contributed to the villagers of Minnigaff losing their access to fertile agricultural land and thus, after his death, to the Galloway Levellers uprising of 1724.", "Patrick Heron's son, also named Patrick Heron (1672\u20131761), was instrumental in 1724 in the defusing of a tense situation during the uprising when the Levellers, men who were protesting against the use of enclosures by landowners like Heron (their name came from their practice of \"levelling\" the dykes that the landowners had erected), were confronted by a party of landowners.Morton, p181 Heron convinced his fellow landowners that, as their numbers were less than the numbers of the Levellers, negotiation was a better strategy than force. Heron went to meet the Levellers, hat in hand, and proposed a conference.  The conference enabled the Levellers to air their grievances, the landowners to deny those grievances and thus the status quo to be restored without violence. Following this, Heron was elected (by fellow landowners) to the House of Commons and was the Member for Kirkcudbright Stewartry from 1727 to 1741.\"Patrick Heron (c.1672\u20131761), of Heron, Kirroughtrie, Kirkcudbright\", the History of Parliament: the House of Commons 1715\u20131754, ed.
