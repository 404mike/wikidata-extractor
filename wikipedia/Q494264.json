Champion left England in February 1879 for Guatemala, where he arrived on 16 March. Then commenced four years of journeys and intensive collecting, which are described in a series of articles he wrote to the Entomologist's Monthly Magazine. Successful as a collector, he returned to England in 1883 with 15,000 species of insects. A former watchmaker, he was employed by Godman and Salvin as a secretary, and he saw through the press the 52 volumes of the Biologia Centrali-Americana.

This was followed by his work on the Beetles of Central America, prepared chiefly from material collected by Frederick DuCane Godman and Osbert Salvin, and published in 1894 and later years in that monumental work known as the \"Fauna Centrali-Americana\". In 1895 appeared the first volume of the Insecta in the Cambridge Natural History, this being followed by the second volume in 1899. Of their influence on the advancement of entomology, and especially of our knowledge of insects as living things, too much cannot be said. The publication was so popular that it prevented him for producing a new edition incorporating improvements in the classification of the insects. He published on the topic in the Entomologist. In 1910 the Insecta was translated into Russian by N. Y. Kuznetsov. In 1912 the Entomological Society of London, with the assistance of the Royal Society, brought out as Part III of the Transactions The Comparative Anatomy of the Male Genital Tube in Coleoptera by Sharp & Muir, an exhaustive treatise of 166 pages, and 37 plates.

The herbarium at the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences has sheets that are marked \"Beauv.\", but show plants native to India, a place never visited by Palisot. Therefore, Palisot must have incorporated specimens from other collectors, which would explain the strange origin of some of the insects from his collection. Horn & Kahle (1937) state that some of Palisot's beetles, the Elateridae, were later sent by Pierre Fran\u00e7ois Marie Auguste Dejean to Frederick DuCane Godman and Osbert Salvin  at the British Museum of Natural History to be included in the Biologia Centrali-Americana.
