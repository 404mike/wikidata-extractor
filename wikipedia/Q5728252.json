Yeats", "response": ["In 1867, the family moved to England to aid their father, John, to further his career as an artist. At first, the Yeats children were educated at home. Their mother entertained them with stories and Irish folktales. John provided an erratic education in geography and chemistry and took William on natural history explorations of the nearby Slough countryside. On 26 January 1877, the young poet entered the Godolphin School, which he attended for four years. He did not distinguish himself academically, and an early school report describes his performance as \"only fair. Perhaps better in Latin than in any other subject. Very poor in spelling\". Though he had difficulty with mathematics and languages (possibly because he was tone deafSessa, Anne Dzamba; Richard Wagner and the English; p. 130. ), he was fascinated by biology and zoology. In 1879 the family moved to Bedford Park taking a two-year lease on 8 Woodstock Road.Yeats in Bedford Park , chiswickw4.com For financial reasons, the family returned to Dublin toward the end of 1880, living at first in the suburbs of Harold's Cross and later Howth. In October 1881, Yeats resumed his education at Dublin's Erasmus Smith High School. His father's studio was nearby and William spent a great deal of time there, where he met many of the city's artists and writers. During this period he started writing poetry, and, in 1885, the Dublin University Review published Yeats's first poems, as well as an essay entitled \"The Poetry of Sir Samuel Ferguson\". Between 1884 and 1886, William attended the Metropolitan School of Art\u2014now the National College of Art and Design\u2014in Thomas Street. In March 1888 the family moved to 3 Blenheim Road in Bedford Park \"The attraction of Bedford Park\"  by Amy Davies, 8 April 2013, Weidenfeld & Nicolson where they would remain until 1902.

Oisin introduces what was to become one of his most important themes: the appeal of the life of contemplation over the appeal of the life of action. Following the work, Yeats never again attempted another long poem. His other early poems, which are meditations on the themes of love or mystical and esoteric subjects, include Poems (1895), The Secret Rose (1897), and The Wind Among the Reeds (1899).

His friend and contemporary Rudolf Thomas Siegfried (1830\u20131863) became assistant librarian in Trinity College in 1855, and the college's first professor of Sanskrit in 1858.

A number of its members were influenced by political or cultural nationalism, and some took an interest in the literature of the Irish language.

At the same time, archaeological and historical work was beginning to make progress in constructing a better understanding of regional history. Interest in ornamental 'Celtic' art developed, and 'Celtic' motifs began to be used in all sorts of contexts, including architecture, drawing on works like the Grammar of Ornament by the architect Owen Jones. Imitations of the ornate Insular penannular brooches of the 7\u20139th centuries were worn by figures such as Queen Victoria,Royal Collection , Brooch given in November 1849, and Christmas 1849 many produced in DublinVictorian penannular brooches from the V&A Museum. by West & Son and other makers."]}, {"page": "Michael D.
