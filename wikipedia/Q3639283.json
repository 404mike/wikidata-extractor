Europe does not stand the changes brought about by the French Revolution and so did Italy: many piemontesi nobles, including the new king of the region-State Carlo Emanuele IV, live under some sort of control of the French and to pay the consequences are farmers and the people, harassed by soldiers greedy and unscrupulous. In this climate makes a return to Rivombrosa, after completing his studies in Paris, the Countess Agnese Ristori (Sarah Felberbaum), daughter of the Countess of Rivombrosa Elisa Scalzi (Vittoria Puccini) and Count Fabrizio Ristori (Alessandro Preziosi), is now in marriageable age. On the way back, Agnese is stopped by the men of a robber in the area, known as the sparrowhawk that, however, let go without cause her harm. Came home a little 'shock, Agnese embraces his brother Martino Ristori (Paolo Seganti), heir to Rivombrosa after his father's death, which occurred on the morning of Christmas of 1773 at the hands of a trap concocted by the late Duke Ottavio Ranieri (Luca Ward) , and that of Elisa, died in 1784 (for unspecified reasons). Agnes soon realizes the great changes that have occurred in her house and discovers that the sparrowhawk, although it is feared by the French as a robber, is actually considered a hero by most of the inhabitants of the village, tired of the harassment of French and the inertia of the nobles who should provide them with protection."]}, {"page": "Via Zanardi 33", "response": ["*Sarah Felberbaum: Lucia"]}, {"page": "The Jewel (2011 film)", "response": ["* Sarah Felberbaum as Laura Aliprandi"]}, {"page": "The Young Montalbano", "response": ["* Livia Burlando \u2013 Sarah Felberbaum.
