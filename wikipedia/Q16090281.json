At that time the parade was held on 12 August each year. Participants from across Northern Ireland and Britain marched along the city walls above the Bogside, and were often openly hostile to the residents.McCann, Eamonn, War and an Irish Town, p. 21 On 30 July 1969 the Derry Citizens Defence Association (DCDA) was formed to try to preserve peace during the period of the parade, and to defend the Bogside and Creggan in the event of an attack.  The chairman was Se\u00e1n Keenan, an Irish Republican Army (IRA) veteran; the vice-chairman was Paddy Doherty, a popular local man sometimes known as \"Paddy Bogside\" and the secretary was Johnnie White, another leading republican and leader of the James Connolly Republican Club.  Street committees were formed under the overall command of the DCDA and barricades were built on the night of 11 August.McCann, Eamonn, War and an Irish Town, pp. 58 \u2013 59 The parade took place as planned on 12 August.  As it passed through Waterloo Place, on the edge of the Bogside, hostilities began between supporters and opponents of the parade. Fighting between the two groups continued for two hours, then the police joined in. They charged up William Street against the Bogsiders, followed by the 'Paisleyites'. They were met with a hail of stones and petrol bombs. The ensuing battle became known as the Battle of the Bogside.  Late in the evening, having been driven back repeatedly, the police fired canisters of CS gas into the crowd.  Youths on the roof of a high-rise block of flats on Rossville Street threw petrol bombs down on the police.History \u2013 Battle of the Bogside , The Museum of Free Derry. Retrieved 11 November 2008. Walkie-talkies were used to maintain contact between different areas of fighting and DCDA headquarters in Paddy Doherty's house in Westland Street,McCann, Eamonn, War and an Irish Town, p. 60 and first aid stations were operating, staffed by doctors, nurses and volunteers.

On the third day of fighting, 14 August, the Northern Ireland Government mobilised the Ulster Special Constabulary (B-Specials), a force greatly feared by nationalists in Derry and elsewhere. Before they engaged, however, British troops were deployed at the scene, carrying automatic rifles and sub-machine guns. The RUC and B-Specials withdrew, and the troops took up positions outside the barricaded area.Adams, Gerry, The Politics of Irish Freedom, Brandon Books, Dingle, 1986, p. 33", "The Irish Republican Army (IRA) had been inactive militarily since the end of the Border Campaign in 1962.

I haven't the men nor the guns to do it.\"\u00d3 Dochartaigh, Niall, From Civil Rights to Armalites, p. 103 During the 1960s the leadership of the republican movement had moved to the left.

The Derry Citizens' Defence Association was formed initially by republicans, who then invited other nationalists to join.McCann, Eamonn, War and an Irish Town, p. 58  Although there were tensions between the younger leaders like Johnnie White and the older, traditional republicans such as Se\u00e1n Keenan, both sides saw the unrest of 1968\u201369 as a chance to advance republican aims, and the two shared the platform at the Easter Rising commemoration in April 1969.\u00d3 Dochartaigh, Niall, From Civil Rights to Armalites, pp. 40,42"]}, {"page": "Battle of the Bogside", "response": ["The actions of the Bogside residents were co-ordinated to some extent.
