Stevenage lost the game 2\u20131, with a goal from Mitchell Cole sandwiched in between two from Morison for Millwall.

On 31 July, Stevenage played League One club Southend United. Stevenage won the game 2\u20131, with two first half goals from Joel Byrom and Darren Murphy. The following day, Stevenage played out a 0\u20130 draw with Conference South side Woking in their final pre-season fixture. Despite joining Woking on-loan, Peter Vincenti featured for his parent club, whilst former Mansfield Town winger Nathan Arnold also played a part in the match.
