Lady Gregory read the manuscript and advised Synge to remove any direct naming of places and to add more folk stories, but he declined to do either because he wanted to create something more realistic.Smith 1996, xvi The book conveys Synge's belief that beneath the Catholicism of the islanders it was possible to detect a substratum of the pagan beliefs of their ancestors.

In photography Pictorialism aimed to achieve artistic indeed painterly effects; The Linked Ring contained the leading practitioners.  The American John Singer Sargent was the most successful London portraitist at the start of the 20th century, with John Lavery, Augustus John and William Orpen rising figures.  John's sister Gwen John lived in France, and her intimate portraits were relatively little appreciated until decades after her death.  British attitudes to modern art were \"polarized\" at the end of the 19th century.. Modernist movements were both cherished and vilified by artists and critics; Impressionism was initially regarded by \"many conservative critics\" as a \"subversive foreign influence\", but became \"fully assimilated\" into British art during the early-20th century.
