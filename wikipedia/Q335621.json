He attended the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and served in the Second Boer War. Denman sat with the Liberal Party in the House of Lords, and was made a Lord-in-waiting in 1905 and Chief Whip in 1907. He was appointed to the governor-generalship at the age of 36, and remains the youngest person to have held the position. Denman and his young family were immensely popular with the general public, and he enjoyed friendly relations with Prime Minister Andrew Fisher, with whom he shared many similar political opinions. However, he suffered from ill health and returned to England after less than three years as governor-general. Denman never again held public office, but remained active in the House of Lords and briefly commanded a unit in the First World War.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1954", "response": ["* June 24 \u2013 Thomas Denman, 3rd Baron Denman, 5th Governor-General of Australia (b. 1874)"]}, {"page": "List of people on the postage stamps of Australia", "response": ["* Anne Judith Denman, daughter of Governor-General Thomas Denman, 3rd Baron Denman as recipient of first Australian banknote (2013)"]}, {"page": "Thomas Denman", "response": ["*Thomas Denman, 3rd Baron Denman (1874\u20131954), British politician, Governor-General of Australia"]}, {"page": "Baron Denman", "response": ["*Thomas Denman, 3rd Baron Denman (1874\u20131954)"]}, {"page": "Weetman Pearson, 1st Viscount Cowdray", "response": ["*Gertrude Mary Pearson (Gertrude Mary, Baroness Denman, GBE), who married Thomas Denman, 3rd Baron Denman, Governor-General of Australia."]}]}}
