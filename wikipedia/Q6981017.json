His best known works on marine larvae were his poems published as Larval Forms and Other Zoological Verses, especially The Ballad of the Veliger. They describe the form and function of several marine larvae as well as illustrating some controversies in evolutionary biology of the time.Garstang was known for his vehement opposition to  Ernst Haeckel's Biogenetic Law, now discredited.

The proposal implied (if it were correct) a shared phylogeny of tunicates and vertebrates, and that heterochrony was a principal mechanism of evolutionary change.", "Walter Garstang suggested the neotenous origin of the vertebrates from a tunicate larva, in opposition to Darwins opinion that tunicates and vertebrates both evolved from animals whose adult form was similar to (frog) tadpoles and the 'tadpole larvae' of tunicates. According to Richard Dawkins, Garstang's opinion was also held by Alister Hardy, and is still held by some modern biologists.

By moving the mantle cavity over the head, the gastropod can retract its vulnerable head into its shell. Some gastropods can also close the entrance to their shell with a tough operculum, a door-like structure which is attached to the dorsal surface of their foot. In evolutionary terms, the appearance of an operculum occurred shortly after that of torsion, which suggests a possible link with the role of torsion, though there is not sufficient evidence for or against this hypothesis. The English zoologist Walter Garstang wrote a famous poem in 1928, The Ballad of the Veliger, in which he argued with gentle humour in favour of the defence theory, including the linesHardy A.C. 1951.

Taylor, his assistant lecturer and demonstrator in zoology, and Ll. Lloyd, his first advanced student (and later to be his reader in entomology and protozoology).  Ll. Lloyd, who had known the area since boyhood, later recalled  that they stayed at the Bay Hotel \"and its verandha, the sea washing its wall at high tide, was our Laboratory\" where they sorted and examined the great variety of animals collected from the shore and rock pools.  In 1912, in cooperation with Alfred Denny, professor of zoology at Sheffield University,  Walter Garstang established a marine research facility in Baytown, in an old building at the Wayfoot previously used as the coastguard cottage, and owned by Mrs. Martha Storm, a member of the long-established local fishing family. Jointly funded by Leeds and Sheffield Universities, the facility was known as Yorkshire Universities Marine Laboratory, and was used as a summer base for fieldwork, teaching and research by the Departments of Zoology and Botany. Initially for a two-year trial period, the two universities agreed to the annual outlay of \u00a34 each for rent and up to \u00a310 each for upkeep.", "In 1914 they agreed to continue the arrangement and to rent for a further \u00a33 annually the adjoining large room, previously occupied by an auctioneer, and formerly being the coastguards' rocket apparatus room. In agreeing to the expansion, the Leeds University Finance Committee suggested that any funds required for additional equipment should be raised by private subscription.  Walter Garstang was confident that he could acquire the necessary funds.  Martha Storm had been willing to sell the premises in 1914, but it was not until 1922 that the buildings were jointly purchased by Leeds and Sheffield for the sum of \u00a3220. There were very few permanent facilities at the laboratory, so when the classes travelled over from Leeds and Sheffield they had to bring all the equipment they needed with them and carry it down from the top of Bay Bank.", "However, generations of Leeds students and researchers, and visiting marine scientists, benefited from working in Robin Hood's Bay.
