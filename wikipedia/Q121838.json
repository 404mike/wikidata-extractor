(1977) The Cement Industry 1796\u20131914: A History, David & Charles. , Ch. 5. In 1824, Joseph Aspdin patented a similar material, which he called Portland cement, because the render made from it was in color similar to the prestigious Portland stone quarried on the Isle of Portland, Dorset, England. However, Aspdins' cement was nothing like modern Portland cement but was a first step in its development, called a proto-Portland cement. Joseph Aspdins' son William Aspdin had left his father's company and in his cement manufacturing apparently accidentally produced calcium silicates in the 1840s, a middle step in the development of Portland cement. William Aspdin's innovation was counterintuitive for manufacturers of \"artificial cements\", because they required more lime in the mix (a problem for his father), a much higher kiln temperature (and therefore more fuel), and the resulting clinker was very hard and rapidly wore down the millstones, which were the only available grinding technology of the time. Manufacturing costs were therefore considerably higher, but the product set reasonably slowly and developed strength quickly, thus opening up a market for use in concrete. The use of concrete in construction grew rapidly from 1850 onward, and was soon the dominant use for cements. Thus Portland cement began its predominant role. Isaac Charles Johnson further refined the production of meso-Portland cement (middle stage of development) and claimed he was the real father of Portland cement.Hahn, Thomas F. and Kemp, Emory Leland (1994).

Minutes in the ICE library suggest Barlow quietly patented his ideas for a cylindrical cutting shield but never built one. Greathead, unaware of Barlow's initial patent and succeeding provisional patent, went on to design, patent and build the credited first cylindrical tunnelling shield in history. Simultaneously, Alfred Ely Beach built a cylindrical tunnelling shield in New York and designed a shield that very closely resembled Barlow's patented idea around the same time as Greathead. According to a 2017 video lecture given by Professor Lord Mair for the ICE, the Brunels' shield ideas were well known in both USA and UK. Since Barlow was a Brunel pupil, he was likely well acquainted with the rectangular tunnelling shield design. It must have been obvious that a cylindrical design was far more suitable and stable which lead to three famous men independently designing their own unique tunneling shields within a few years of each other. Since Portland cement had only been invented in 1824 by Joseph Aspdin of Leeds, it was not fully appreciated by the construction industry for many years. It was only because of Portland cement's hydraulic properties and ability to set in wet environments that these first tunnel ventures under the Thames came to fruition at all. Beach never came to England to learn of Barlow's patent and later provisional patent, and Greathead did not know about Barlow's provisional patent idea until 1895 when it was discussed in the Institution of Civil Engineers meeting attended by Greathead shortly after Barlow's death and shortly before his own death.

The emergence of Portland cement in the 1840s made grinding considerably more difficult, because the clinker produced by the kiln is often as hard as the millstone material.  Because of this, cement continued to be ground very coarsely (typically 20% over 100 \u03bcm particle diameter) until better grinding technology became available.  Besides producing un-reactive cement with slow strength growth, this exacerbated the problem of unsoundness.  This late, disruptive expansion is caused by hydration of large particles of calcium oxide.  Fine grinding lessens this effect, and early cements had to be stored for several months to give the calcium oxide time to hydrate before it was fit for sale.  From 1885 onward, the development of specialized steel led to the development of new forms of grinding equipment, and from this point onward, the typical fineness of cement began a steady rise.  The progressive reduction in the proportion of larger, un-reactive cement particles has been partially responsible for the fourfold increase in the strength of Portland cement during the twentieth century.P. C. Hewlett (Ed)Lea's Chemistry of Cement and Concrete: 4th Ed, Arnold, 1998, , p 12  The recent history of the technology has been mainly concerned with reducing the energy consumption of the grinding process."]}, {"page": "Rawmill", "response": ["The history of the development of the technology of raw material grinding defines the early history of cement technology.  Other stages of cement manufacture used existing technology in the early days.  Early hydraulic materials such as hydraulic limes, natural cements and Parker's Roman cement were all based on \"natural\" raw materials, burned \"as-dug\".  Because these natural blends of minerals occur only rarely, manufacturers were interested in making a fine-grained artificial mixture of readily available minerals such as limestone and clay that could be used in the same way.  A typical problem would be to make an intimate mixture of 75% chalk and 25% clay, and burn this to produce an \u201dartificial cement\".  The development of the \"wet\" method of producing fine-grained clay in the ceramics industry afforded a means of doing this.  For this reason, the early cement industry used the \"wet process\", in which the raw materials are ground together with water, to produce a slurry, containing 20\u201350% water.  Both Louis Vicat and James Frost used this technique in the early 19th century, and it remained the only way of making rawmix for Portland cement until 1890.  A modification of the technique used by the early industry was \"double-burning\", in which a hard limestone would be burned and slaked before combining with clay slurry.  This technique avoided the grinding of hard stone, and was employed by, among others, Joseph Aspdin.  Early grinding technology was poor, and early slurries were made thin, with a high water content.  The slurry was then allowed to stand in large reservoirs (\"slurry-backs\") for several weeks.  Large, un-ground particles would drop to the bottom, and excess water rose to the top.  The water was periodically decanted until a stiff cake, of the consistency of pottery clay, was left.  This was sliced up, discarding the coarse material at the bottom, and burned in the kiln.  Wet grinding is comparatively energy-efficient, and so when good dry-grinding equipment became available, the wet process continued in use throughout the 20th century, often employing equipment that Josiah Wedgwood would have recognized."]}, {"page": "Roman cement", "response": ["From around 1807 a number of people looked to make artificial versions of this cement (or more strictly hydraulic lime as it was not burnt at fusion temperatures).
