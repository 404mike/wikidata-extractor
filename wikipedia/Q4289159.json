It wasn't until on 11 September 2010 when Baird made his first appearance of the season, in a 2 \u2013 1 win over Wolves. On 14 September 2010 Baird signed a new contract with Fulham, keeping him at Craven Cottage until at least the summer of 2013, and on 28 December 2010 he scored his first and second goals for Fulham against Stoke City at the Britannia Stadium in a 2\u20130 victory. This was voted the second Fulham \"Goal of the Season\" by the Fulham fans, just behind his teammate Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9. Both were long-range strikes, earning him the nickname \"Bairdinho\" amongst Fulham fans. Baird was charged with abusive and insulting gestures towards a match official during a match against Liverpool on 9 May 2011, after he played the full 90 minutes and picked up a yellow card by referee Lee Mason in the 5\u20132 defeat at Craven Cottage. He then subsequently missed the last two games of the season against Birmingham City and Arsenal and was replaced by Philippe Senderos. Despite this, Baird made twenty\u2013nine appearances for the club in the 2010\u201311 season."]}, {"page": "Bojan Krki\u0107", "response": ["Bojan scored his first goal for Stoke in a 1\u20132 friendly defeat against Schalke 04 on 29 July 2014.

BBC Sport said that Bojan \"impressed\" for Stoke in the match. However, after a couple of ineffective performances, Hughes stated that he was prepared to give Bojan time to adapt to English football. He returned to the starting line-up on 1 November 2014 in a 2\u20132 draw against West Ham United. Eight days after that, he scored his first Stoke goal to open a 2\u20131 win at Tottenham Hotspur, a dribble followed by a shot from outside the penalty area. On 6 December 2014, Bojan scored in a 3\u20132 win over Arsenal. On 26 December, he won a contested penalty in the first half at Goodison Park when referee Lee Mason declared that he had been fouled by Everton's James McCarthy; Bojan then converted the spot-kick past Tim Howard for the only goal of the game. Bojan scored in a 1\u20130 victory against Leicester City on 17 January 2015. Nine days later, he scored his fifth goal of the season in a 4\u20131 victory in the FA Cup fourth round against Rochdale, but was later substituted having suffered a knee injury which ruled him out for the remainder of the 2014\u201315 season."]}, {"page": "FA Cup Final referees", "response": ["|2018||Michael Oliver||Ian HussinLee Betts||Lee MasonConstantine Hatzidakis||Neil SwarbrickMick McDonough||"]}, {"page": "Antonio Conte", "response": ["Conte was sent to the stands for the first time in his Chelsea career during the first half of a home match against Swansea City on 29 November 2017.
