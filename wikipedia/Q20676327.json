However, a recent fashion that has been taken up by several nations is the process of giving a player making his Test debut an appearance number, along with his Test cap, for reasons of historical continuity. The number represents how many players have made their Test debuts including the one wearing it. If two or more players make their debut in the same match, they are given numbers alphabetically based on surname. For example, Thomas Armitage is Test player number 1 for England. He made his debut in the very first Test Match, against Australia, on 15 March 1877, and was first in alphabetical order on England's team. Mason Crane made his debut for England on 4 January 2018 against Australia; his number is 683. These numbers can be found on a player's Test uniform, but it is always in discreet small type on the front, and never displayed prominently."]}, {"page": "Crane (surname)", "response": ["* Mason Crane (b. 1997), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of Worthing inhabitants", "response": ["* Mason Crane, international cricketer, grew up in the town and attended Thomas a Becket School and Lancing College"]}, {"page": "Worthing Cricket Club", "response": ["The club was a founder member of the Sussex League, having been a member since its inception in 1971.
