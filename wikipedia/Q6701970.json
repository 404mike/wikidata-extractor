However, in a study commissioned by Jubilee Australia, two Australian economists \u2013 Paul Flanagan and Luke Fletcher \u2013 compared the predictions of this report in 2018 with actual outcomes. They found an actual fall in employment, household incomes, employment, government income, and imports where the ACIL-Tasman study predicted increases. GDP was expected to double as a result of LNG/PNG in the ACIL-Tasman study, but the researchers found a mere 10% growth. The Jubilee study has been criticised because the researchers did not produce a credible counterargument: What would have happened in the absence of the PNG LNG project and to what extent are the observed effects related to PNG LNG?Mark McGillvray  Modelling or Muddling?

Mekere Morautachallenged the exemption of General Sales Tax  and interest withholding tax given to LNG PNG in parliament. The exemption of interest withholding tax is important as the project is highly geared and much income is needed to service these loans. Arthur Somare, the relevant minister at the time, stressed that a 30 percent corporation tax on profit remained despite these concessions.More powers for IPBC Available at: https://www.thenational.com.pg/more-powers-for-ipbc/  Posted on: 5/3/2010 Accessed: 12/3/2019  A second concern was raised by Aaron Batten while presenting a seminal report by the Asian Development Bank: \"Papua New Guinea: Critical Development Constraints\". He mentioned the taxation concessions to the LNG project. The Internal Revenue Commission argued that companies need the time to extract, produce, export, and sell their products before they can generate a continuous income that is taxable. However, the Internal Revenue gave no definite and precise information of income flows from LNG PNG. As a result of these concessions, substantial income was not expected until after 2020.(Tax holidays worrisome\"  The National 6/8/2012 p.38 Also available at: https://www.thenational.com.pg/tax-holidays-worrisome/   Posted at 6/8/2012  Accessed on: 21/3/2019 Patrick Saniwa Sakal and  Gynnie Kero, \"IRC Exec defends tax holidays\" The National  8/8/2012 Also available at: https://www.thenational.com.pg/irc-exec-defends-tax-holidays/  Posted on: 7/8/2012 Accessed on: 21/3/2019See also: \"LNG revenue to flow in 2020: Vele\"  by Gedeon Timothy  The National  4/10/2016 Available at: http://www.thenational.com.pg/lng-revenue-flow-2020-vele/ Accessed on: 4/11/2016 The actual arrangements between government and companies are in a secret Resource Development Agreement. However, Flanagan and Fletcher suggested that Exxon and Oil Search should be paying AUD$500,000 to the PNG government every year, since the gas started to flow in 2014. Instead, they are paying a fraction of this amount, partly because of their use of tax havens in the Netherlands and the Bahamas as they do in Australia.Paul Flannigan and Luke Fletcher, (2018) Double or Nothing,, the broken promises of PNG/LNG Available at: https://www.jubileeaustralia.org/latest-news/new-jubilee-report-shows-that-efic-funded-png-lng-project-has-hurt-png Posted on:  29/4/2018 Accessed on: 21/3/201 Pp. 31-34 Accessed on 13/3/2019", "The income dependent on profit is unsatisfactory.John Barrett, Tom Westbrook, In Papua New Guinea exxons giant lng project fuels frustration Available at: https://www.reuters.com/article/us-papua-lng-exxon-mobil-insight/in-papua-new-guinea-exxons-giant-lng-project-fuels-frustration-idUSKCN1PA32M Posted on 17/1/2019 ExxonMobil claims to have paid 5 billion kina  (US$1.4 billion) in royalties, development levies, taxes, and dividends to the PNG government.
