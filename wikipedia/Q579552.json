Analysis of its teeth has shown that Lesothosaurus sliced up its food with its beak and was not able to chew its food. Studies of the tooth wear have shown much less abrasion on the teeth than would be expected of a plant-eater feeding mainly on tough, arid-climate plants, and concluded that Lesothosaurus was probably an opportunistic omnivore, feeding primarily on small animals during seasons when softer plants were not available.Sciscio L, Knoll F, Bordy EM, de Kock MO, Redelstorff R.

Paul concluded in 1984 that segnosaurs had no theropodan features but were derived, late-surviving Cretaceous prosauropods with adaptations similar to those of ornithischians. He found segnosaurs to be similar to prosauropods in the morphology of their snout, mandible, and hindfoot; to ornithischians in their cheek, palate, pubis, and ankle; and to early dinosaurs in other respects. He proposed that ornithischians were descended from prosauropods and that the segnosaurs were an intermediate relic of this transition, which supposedly took place during the Triassic period. In this way, he considered segnosaurians to have a comparable position to herbivorous dinosaurs in general, as monotremes have to mammals. He found it unlikely but did not rule out that segnosaurs could have derived from theropods or that segnosaurs, prosauropods and ornithischians were each independently derived from early dinosaurs. David B. Norman considered Paul's idea contentious and \"bound to provoke much argument\" in 1985. In 1988, Paul maintained that segnosaurs were late-surviving, ornithischian-like prosauropods and proposed a segnosaurian identity for Therizinosaurus. He also placed segnosauria within Phytodinosauria, a superorder Robert Bakker had created in 1985 to contain all plant-eating dinosaurs. In a 1986 study of the inter-relationships of saurischian dinosaurs, Jacques Gauthier concluded segnosaurs were prosauropods.

Criticisms of the novel included a perceived lack of characterization and average writing. Some scientists, such as paleontologist David B.

The paleontologist Thomas Holtz noted that Bakker combined fauna in ways not directly supported by the fossil record; for example, several of the dinosaurs featured in the books lived millions of years after Utahraptor died out. Michael Taylor, curator of vertebrate paleontology at the National Museums of Scotland, panned the book, saying that \"Raptor Red is an accurate portrayal only within the context of uncertainties over the reconstruction of fossil animals as living forms ... Bakker's postscript never really admits these uncertainties.\" David B. Norman criticized the book as \"no more than a children's adventure story\u2014and a rather poorly written one at that ... The merging of science and fantasy is at its worst in books like Raptor Red because none but the experts can disentangle fact from fiction; this type of nonsense turns an uninformed reader into a misinformed one.\" Jay Ingram, from the Discovery Channel, published a rebuttal, saying, \"The most important point is that Bakker's portrayal of the dinosaurs in Raptor Red is vivid\u2014vivid in a way few museum displays or factual accounts can be.

Historically used for forms lacking large vertical plates, Kenneth Carpenter proposed in 1997 the first informal definition of the group, as all ornithischians closer to Ankylosaurus than Stegosaurus.Carpenter, K., 1997, \"Ankylosauria\" pp. 16-20 in: P.J. Currie and K. Padian (eds.), Encyclopedia of Dinosaurs, Academic Press, San Diego This definition was further refined by Paul Sereno in 2005 to specify Ankylosaurus magniventris and Stegosaurus stenops, the type species of both genera, a definition that was followed by Madzia and colleagues in 2021 when the group name and definition was formalized following the PhyloCode. Phylogenetic and morphological studies have differed on the inclusion of certain early taxa into Ankylosauria, especially the armoured Early Jurassic form Scelidosaurus. As some analyses, like that of Carpenter from 2001 or David B. Norman in 2021 find Scelidosaurus and possibly other early forms like Emausaurus and Scutellosaurus to fall closer to Ankylosaurus than Stegosaurus, Carpenter and later Norman suggested redefining Ankylosauria to limit it to the two subclades Nodosauridae and Ankylosauridae, creating the new clade Ankylosauromorpha for all taxa closer to Ankylosaurus than Stegosaurus. However, as historically even these primitive forms were considered ankylosaurs if they were more derived than Stegosaurus, Madzia and colleagues considered a redefinition of Ankylosauria to be undesirable, instead preferring to abandon Ankylosauromorpha as a same-definition junior synonym of Ankylosauria. The informal clade Euankylosauria, suggested by Norman as an alternative to redefining Ankylosauria, was discussed as potentially being useful in future for the typical group of nodosaurids and ankylosaurids, and was defined in 2021 by Soto-Acu\u00f1a and colleagues as such as the result of their novel phylogenetic results, which grouped Antarctopelta, Kunbarrasaurus (Minmi sp. of earlier analyses) and their new taxon Stegouros as a unique group of non-euankylosaurian ankylosaurs, which they gave the name Parankylosauria.

Peter Dodson interpreted similar features in other duckbills as having use in sexual identification. Marya\u0144ska and Osm\u00f3lska, noting the hollow base, suggested that the crest increased the surface area of the respiratory cavity, and helped in thermoregulation. James Hopson supported a function as a visual signal, and further mentioned the possibility that the inflatable skin flaps over the nostrils could have acted as resonators and additional visual signals.

The maxillae are slightly flattened, which minimises the strength of the buccal emargination, a diagnostic character of ornithischians where the maxillary tooth row and bone directly above it is inset from the outer edge of the bone. The presence of an arched diastema in Echinodon is a topic of disagreement. While Galton and American palaeontologist Paul Sereno interpret a diastema as present as in Heterodontosaurus, British palaeontologists David B. Norman and Paul M. Barrett concluded in 2002 that, based on the images of Owen prior to later damage of the fossil NHMUK 48209, a diastema was absent. Sereno reiterated in 2012 that a diastema was present and arched based on the maxilla NHMUK 48211. Nine teeth are present in the maxilla of Echinodon, the first being an enlarged and slender canine similar to those seen in the premaxilla of Lycorhinus and Heterodontosaurus. Owen also figured a partial tooth in front of the caniniform, but it has since been lost in damage to the material. While Norman and Barrett used this as evidence for a second caniniform smaller than the one behind, Galton in 1978 and Sereno in 2012 identified only one canine present. The first post-caniniform tooth of Echinodon is the largest, although only slightly taller than those following, which are all the same size.

The postcranial skeleton was briefly described by palaeontologists Albert Santa Luca, Crompton and Charig in 1976. Its forelimb bones had previously been discussed and figured in an article by the palaeontologists Peter Galton and Robert T. Bakker in 1974, as the specimen was considered significant in establishing that Dinosauria was a monophyletic natural group, whereas most scientists at the time, including the scientists who described Heterodontosaurus, thought that the two main orders Saurischia and Ornithischia were not directly related. The skeleton was fully described in 1980. SAM-PK-K1332 is the most complete heterodontosaurid skeleton described to date.

They therefore agreed that the name Podokesaurus should be restricted to the holotype, and that it and the natural cast should be considered Theropoda incertae sedis. In the same volume, the paleontologist David B. Norman agreed with this assessment, and stated the features used to unite Podokesaurus with Coelophysis merely confirm that they were dinosaurs rather than establish a specific relation between them. The paleontologist Thomas R. Holtz agreed in 1994 that the family name Podokesauridae should be replaced by Coelophysidae. By this time, the idea that small theropods should be grouped in Coelurosauria and large theropods in Carnosauria was falling out of favor, and Coelophysoidea was considered a separate group of gracile, early theropods.

However, basal ornithopod phylogeny is poorly known at this point, albeit under study. Like Thescelosaurus, Parksosaurus had a relatively robust hindlimb, and an elongate skull without as much of an arched shape to the forehead compared to other hypsilophodonts.

Peter M. Galton retained it in the family in 1978, though he noted that there were significant differences between Alocodon and Fabrosaurus, and the Middle to Late Jurassic fabrosaurids Alocodon, Trimucrodon and Echinodon were representative of three independent branches of the family, with Nanosaurus not preserving enough material to determine its relationships. Given that the species was only represented by teeth, Alocodon was designated as a nomen dubium in 1990 by David B. Weishampel and Lawrence M. Witmer, as an indeterminate member of Ornithischia outside Ornithopoda. While a basal ornithischian position outside Ornithopoda was retained by Paul Sereno in 1991, it was considered a possibly valid taxon based on its broad central denticle. Simultaneously, Galton revised his opinion to Alocodon to be a member of Hypsilophodontidae, still a family within Ornithopoda. Weishampel, Witmer and colleague David B. Norman followed their 1990 opinion on Alocodon in 2004, though they noted that further study could potentially support the validity of the taxon. Features of the teeth identified by Jos\u00e9 I. Canudo and colleagues in 2004 instead supported a more specific position for Alocodon, as a member of Ankylosauria. Canudo et al. based this assignment on the anatomy of the denticles and cingulum of the crown. A denticulate cingulum present in Alocodon was also identified as an ankylosaur feature, by Paul M. Barrett and colleagues in 2010, though more material was considered necessary to verify the importance of the feature. Alocodon was considered an ornithopod by Filippo M. Rotatori and colleagues in 2020. Because of its incomplete nature, Alocodon has been excluded from phylogenetic analyses."]}]}}
