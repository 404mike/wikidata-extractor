The house is a large two storey mansion with an Italian architectural style. Charles Lanyon bought the house himself in 1862 and lived in the house with his family until his death in 1889. Following Lanyon's death, the house was sold at auction in Belfast, and lay derelict until 1897 when it was purchased by the Granville Hotel Company, who intended to convert the house into a private tuberculosis treatment centre. By the turn of the century, tuberculosis was the most pressing health problem in the UK and Ireland, but the hospitals of the time were unable to cope with the volume of patients suffering from the disease. Most TB patients were nursed in cramped, crowded hospital wards. It was soon realised that Belfast needed a dedicated hospital for the treatment of tuberculosis, and in 1904 The Abbey was purchased by Belfast Union to function as a sanitorium."]}]}}
