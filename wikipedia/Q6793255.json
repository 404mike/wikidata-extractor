His father had been the Oxford University head of finance ('Keeper of the University Chest') and a Fellow of Balliol College, Oxford, and after schooling at Winchester College, Maurice became an undergraduate there in 1954. He was a contemporary and lifelong friend of Tom Bingham, later the Senior Law Lord, as well as of the military historian, Sir John Keegan, whose sister Mary he married.\nKeen's first success came with the writing of The Outlaws of Medieval Legend while still a Junior Research Fellow at The Queen's College, Oxford, 1957\u20131961. He was elected a tutorial Fellow of Balliol in 1961, retaining his fellowship until his retirement in 2000, when he was elected a Fellow Emeritus. He also served as Junior Dean (1963\u201368), Tutor for Admissions (1974\u20131978), and Vice-Master (1980\u201383).\nIn 1984, Keen won the Wolfson History Prize for his book Chivalry. The book redefined in several ways the concept of chivalry, underlining the military aspect of it.Keen was elected a Fellow of the British Academy, a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society, and a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London.\nHe appears in the 1989 fictional novel The Negotiator by Frederick Forsyth.\nHe was an enthusiastic governor of Blundell's School in Tiverton for many years, the school being linked to Balliol by a scholarship and fellowship foundation gift.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Robin Hood", "response": ["It is from the association with the May Games that Robin's romantic attachment to Maid Marian (or Marion) apparently stems. A \"Robin and Marion\" figured in 13th-century French 'pastourelles' (of which Jeu de Robin et Marion  1280 is a literary version) and presided over the French May festivities, \"this Robin and Marion tended to preside, in the intervals of the attempted seduction of the latter by a series of knights, over a variety of rustic pastimes\".Dobson and Taylor, p. 42. In the Jeu de Robin and Marion, Robin and his companions have to rescue Marion from the clutches of a \"lustful knight\".Maurice Keen The Outlaws of Medieval England Appendix\u00a01, 1987, Routledge, . This play is distinct from the English legends. although Dobson and Taylor regard it as 'highly probable' that this French Robin's name and functions travelled to the English May Games where they fused with the Robin Hood legend.Dobson and Taylor (1997), p. 42. Both Robin and Marian were certainly associated with May Day festivities in England (as was Friar Tuck), but these may have been originally two distinct types of performance \u2013 Alexander Barclay in his Ship of Fools, writing in  1500, refers to  \u2013 but the characters were brought together.Jeffrey Richards, Swordsmen of the Screen: From Douglas Fairbanks to Michael York, p. 190, Routledge & Kegan Paul, Lond, Henly and Boston (1988). Marian did not immediately gain the unquestioned role; in Robin Hood's Birth, Breeding, Valor, and Marriage, his sweetheart is \"Clorinda the Queen of the Shepherdesses\".Holt, p.\u00a0165 Clorinda survives in some later stories as an alias of Marian.Allen W. Wright, \"A Beginner's Guide to Robin Hood\" ", "There is at present little or no scholarly support for the view that tales of Robin Hood have stemmed from mythology or folklore, from fairies or other mythological origins, any such associations being regarded as later development.Holt, p. 55.Dobson and Taylor (1997), p. 63. It was once a popular view, however.A number of such theories are mentioned at . The \"mythological theory\" dates back at least to 1584, when Reginald Scot identified Robin Hood with the Germanic goblin \"Hudgin\" or Hodekin and associated him with Robin Goodfellow.Reginald Scot \"Discourse upon divels and spirits\" Chapter 21, quoted in Charles P.

Maurice KeenThe Outlaws of Medieval England Appendix 1, 1987, Routledge, . provides a brief summary and useful critique of the evidence for the view Robin Hood had mythological origins. While the outlaw often shows great skill in archery, swordplay and disguise, his feats are no more exaggerated than those of characters in other ballads, such as Kinmont Willie, which were based on historical events.Holt, p. 57."]}, {"page": "Chivalry", "response": ["# Honour: honour was what was achieved by living up to the ideal of the preudomme and pursuing the qualities and behaviour listed above. Maurice Keen notes the most damning, irreversible mode of \"demoting\" one's honorific status, again humanly through contemporary eyes, consisted in displaying pusillanimous conduct on the battlefield. The loss of honour is a humiliation to a man's standing and is worse than death. Bertran de Born said: \"For myself I prefer to hold a little piece of land in onor, than to hold a great empire with dishonor\"."]}, {"page": "Princes in the Tower", "response": ["Many historians believe the princes were murdered; some have suggested that the act may have happened towards the end of summer 1483. Maurice Keen argues that the rebellion against Richard in 1483 initially \"aimed to rescue Edward V and his brother from the Tower before it was too late\", but that, when the Duke of Buckingham became involved, it shifted to support of Henry Tudor because \"Buckingham almost certainly knew that the princes in the Tower were dead.\"M. H. Keen, England in the Later Middle Ages: A Political History, Routledge: New York, 2003, p. 388. Alison Weir proposes 3 September 1483 as a potential date;Alison Weir, The Princes of the Tower (p. 157) however, Weir's work has been criticised for \"arriving at a conclusion that depends more on her own imagination than on the uncertain evidence she has so misleadingly presented.\""]}, {"page": "Gentleman", "response": ["Therefore, the English social category of gentleman corresponds to the French gentilhomme (nobleman), which in Great Britain meant a member of the peerage of England. In that context, the historian Maurice Keen said that the social category of gentleman is \"the nearest, contemporary English equivalent of the noblesse of France.\" In the 14th century, the term gentlemen comprised the hereditary ruling class, which is whom the rebels of the Peasants' Revolt (1381) meant when they repeated:"]}, {"page": "Andrew Harclay, 1st Earl of Carlisle", "response": ["Though historians have generally shown understanding for Harclay's actions, it is nevertheless common to refer to the event as \"Harclay's treason\".;  In the words of Maurice Keen: \"To make a truce, or to indeed to give safe-conducts or make any agreement with the king's enemies without proper grant of powers, again constituted l\u00e8se majest\u00e9 and can be found defined as such in other military cases\". Harclay had received such powers in February 1322, but he was considered to have overstepped his prerogative by the 1323 treaty.;  It is also possible that Edward held a grudge against Harclay for the latter's failure to come to the rescue at Byland, and that this was behind the king's later, severe reaction. There is, however, no evidence that Harclay received the royal letter in time to arrive at the battlefield any earlier than he did."]}, {"page": "List of Balliol College, Oxford people", "response": ["* Maurice Keen"]}, {"page": "Conquests of the Longbow: The Legend of Robin Hood", "response": ["Conquests of the Longbow is based on tremendous historical and cultural research, for detail within the story's setting and puzzles. The game manual lists twenty-eight volumes in the bibliography, including Robin Hood by J.C. Holt, The Outlaws of Medieval Legend by Maurice Keen, and The White Goddess by Robert Graves. The manual includes essays by Marx outlining the history of the legend and the approximate dates at which different characters were incorporated into the Robin Hood legend, such as Friar Tuck and Marian in the 15th century. Guy of Gisbourne is mentioned but absent from the game. Other essays cover the tree lore, early British history, and video game piracy. "]}, {"page": "Ennoblement", "response": ["Medieval theorists of nobility relied on earlier classical concepts (Platonic, Aristotelian and Christian-Hellenistic) of what personal traits and virtues constitute grounds for ennoblement. In Plato's Republic, he provides for promotion and degradation of citizens according to a strict spiritual meritocracy. In the words of Will Durant, \"If the ruler's son is a dolt he falls at the first shearing; if the boot-black's son is a man of ability the way is clear for him to become a guardian of the state\" (Durant, The Story of Philosophy, 1961, p.\u00a028). In medieval times, heraldic writers cited biblical examples to demonstrate that nobility is not just a matter of descent but of personal virtue: Shem, Ham and Japheth sprang from the same father, yet Ham was ignoble and King David rose from shepherd to become king through sheer faith and soldierly courage. Bartolus defined natural nobility by reference to Aristotle, who in his Politics explains how some are marked out for freedom by their virtues (and specifically by their capacity to rule), and are so distinguished from the mass of men whose talents fit them only for a servile role. Those free men whose virtues thus fit them to rule Bartolus defines as the natural nobility. With regard to natural nobility, Bartolus applauded Dante Alighieri's argument in his Convivio that nobility does not derive from ancient riches adorned with fine manners, but is the meed of individual virtue. Bartolus argues that the prince should strive to make his dominion a true mirror of God's own by advancing only those who are naturally noble (see Maurice Keen, Chivalry, p.\u00a0149). Geoffroi de Charny, the noted celebrant of knighthood, argued \"God will mark out those who labor valorously, even though they come of little estate\" (Livre de chevalrie, in Oeuvres de Froissart, ed. K. de Lettenhove I, pt. iii, 494, 495). During the Renaissance, the Platonic-Christian humanist belief in virtue as the essence of nobility was summed up in the Latin phrase: Virtus vera nobilitas est (Virtue is the True Nobility). The counter-revolutionary author Edmund Burke wrote on merit-based promotion: \"...the road to eminence and power, from obscure condition, ought not to be made too easy, nor a thing too much of course. If rare merit be the rarest of all rare things, it ought to pass through some sort of probation. The temple of honor ought to be seated on an eminence. If it be opened through virtue, let it be remembered, too, that virtue is never tried but by some difficulty and some struggle.\" Napoleon Bonaparte and Friedrich Nietzsche were later to continue the tradition of promoting a vision of aristocratic meritocracy, although no longer within (and opposed to) the Catholic-chivalric framework."]}]}}
