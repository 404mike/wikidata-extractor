Buck, xii\u2013xiv. Kang Liao argues that Buck played a \"pioneering role in demythologizing China and the Chinese people in the American mind\". Phyllis Bentley, in an overview of Buck's work published in 1935, was altogether impressed: \"But we may say at least that for the interest of her chosen material, the sustained high level of her technical skill, and the frequent universality of her conceptions, Mrs. Buck is entitled to take rank as a considerable artist. To read her novels is to gain not merely knowledge of China but wisdom about life.\" These works aroused considerable popular sympathy for China, and helped foment a more critical view of Japan and its aggression."]}, {"page": "1932 in literature", "response": ["*Phyllis Bentley \u2013 Inheritance"]}, {"page": "Vera Brittain", "response": ["Brittain's first published novel, The Dark Tide (1923), created scandal as it caricatured dons at Oxford, especially at Somerville.

Vera Brittain wrote from the heart, basing many of her novels on actual experiences and actual people. In this regard, her novel Honourable Estate (1936) was autobiographical, dealing with Brittain's failed friendship with the novelist Phyllis Bentley, her romantic feelings for her American publisher George Brett Jr, and her brother Edward's death in action on the Italian Front in 1918. Brittain's diaries from 1913 to 1917 were published in 1981 as Chronicle of Youth. Some critics have argued that Testament of Youth differs greatly from Brittain's writings during the war, suggesting she was more in control when writing retrospectively."]}, {"page": "Fiction set in ancient Rome", "response": ["* Freedom, farewell! by Phyllis Bentley."]}, {"page": "Inheritance (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Inheritance, 1932 novel by Phyllis Bentley"]}, {"page": "Warley Town", "response": ["The writer Dr Phyllis Bentley was also a famous and long-term Warley resident."]}, {"page": "Cheltenham Ladies' College", "response": ["*Phyllis Bentley, novelist and authority on the Bront\u00eb family"]}, {"page": "Armchair detective", "response": ["Marian Phipps, a character in stories by Phyllis Bentley, is an armchair detective in her earliest appearances, solving cases that a policeman friend relates to her.Marvin Lachman, \"Introduction,\" in Chain of Witnesses: The Cases of Miss Phipps, by Phyllis Bentley (Norfolk, Virginia: Crippen & Landru, 2015), p. 3."]}, {"page": "Publishers Weekly list of bestselling novels in the United States in the 1930s", "response": ["# Inheritance by Phyllis Bentley"]}, {"page": "List of Ace titles in K series", "response": ["*K-183 NA Phyllis Bentley The House of Moreys"]}, {"page": "List of Ace miscellaneous letter-series single titles", "response": ["*K-183 NA Phyllis Bentley The House of Moreys"]}, {"page": "List of Ace single volumes", "response": ["* K-183 NA Phyllis Bentley The House of Moreys"]}, {"page": "Cultural depictions of Julius Caesar", "response": ["*Freedom, Farewell!

In writing The Delusson Family, Ducharme stated he sought to bring the story of his people to the broader American audience. From a strictly literary standpoint, the book received mixed reviews. In The Saturday Review critic Kenneth Payson Kempton noted Ducharme had \"no sense of what Phyllis Bentley calls 'scene'\" and described the story as \"sometimes dull\" with a pronounced absence of commentary on industrial exploitation. But Kempton would add that the faults were those of an inexperienced author, and stated he saw the book as the start of a promising career."]}]}}
