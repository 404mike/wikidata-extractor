He was a seam bowler and useful tail-end batsman. During a first-class career lasting from 1966 to 1982, he took 1,402 wickets. He was a member of the Surrey side that won the County Championship in 1971, and also played for Western Province in South Africa in 1971\u201372, and for Rhodesia between 1972\u201373 and 1979\u201380.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 13", "response": ["*  1945   \u2013 Robin Jackman, Indian-English cricketer and sportscaster"]}, {"page": "Ian Botham", "response": ["Botham led England on the controversial tour of the West Indies from January to April 1981.

Botham took the most wickets for England, but Wisden said \"his bowling never recovered the full rhythm of a year before\". His batting, however, apart from one good LOI performance in the first one-day international \"was found wanting in technique, concentration and eventually in confidence\". In Wisden's view, Botham's loss of form \"could be cited as eloquent evidence of the undesirability of saddling a fast bowler and vital all-rounder with the extra burden of captaincy\". The closest England came to a victory was in the first ODI, in which England bowled the West Indies out for 127 but, thanks to six wickets from Colin Croft, failed by two runs in the chase which was anchored by Botham's 60: this was, at the time, the lowest ODI total batting first to be successfully defended."]}, {"page": "Shimla", "response": ["* Robin Jackman, former England cricket player"]}, {"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  Robin Jackman"]}, {"page": "Jackman", "response": ["*Robin Jackman, English cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of cricket commentators", "response": ["|  Robin Jackman (1945\u20132020)"]}, {"page": "Surrey County Cricket Club", "response": ["A fallow period followed, and over the next forty years to 1998, Surrey won the County Championship only once, in 1971 during the career of England opener John Edrich and under the captaincy of Micky Stewart, but greater success was achieved in the shorter form of the game. In 1969, Surrey employed their very first overseas player: the very popular Pakistani leg break bowler Intikhab Alam. In addition to Intikhab, the Surrey attack in their Championship-winning side possessed four current or future England Test cricketers in Geoff Arnold, Robin Jackman, Bob Willis and Pat Pocock. Edrich was subsequently appointed captain in 1973 and led Surrey to second position in the County Championship in his first year in charge and then secured Surrey their first limited overs silverware the following year with victory in the Benson and Hedges Cup. Edrich's replacement as captain, Roger Knight, led Surrey to NatWest Trophy glory at Lord's in 1982.

They tried to keep the death a secret until his son Guy could be told at his boarding school, but his body had to be sent to the mortuary via the lobby and the news soon leaked.

They had a minute's silence at the team meeting before returning to the Kensington Oval, where Barrington had made his maiden Test century 21 years before. The news was announced at the ground and there was another one minute's silence at the beginning of play. The England team were distraught and Robin Jackman said he couldn't bowl properly as he had tears in his eyes.

He prepared to spend the winter employed at the Crystal Palace Recreation Centre while playing as a goalkeeper for local football club Cobham. However, Ray Illingworth and Colin Cowdrey, captain and vice captain of England's Test side, contacted him via telephone to ask him to travel to Australia and join the current England tour there. Willis, who knew that Illingworth and Cowdrey had little knowledge of his bowling, later credited his call-up to the influence of senior member of the touring party John Edrich, Willis' long-term friend, mentor and Surrey teammate."]}, {"page": "International cricket in South Africa from 1971 to 1981", "response": ["DH Robins' XI team squad comprised: Tony Brown; David Brown; Frank Hayes; Jackie Hampshire; Robin Hobbs; David Hughes; Robin Jackman; Roger Knight; John Lever; Peter Lewington;  Arnold Long; John Murray; Clive Radley; Mike Smith; David Turner; Peter Willey;  Bob Willis;"]}, {"page": "List of nicknames used in cricket", "response": ["* Robin Jackman \u2013 Jackers"]}, {"page": "Christopher Mpofu", "response": ["It was former Zimbabwean fast-bowling great Heath Streak who helped Mpofu believe he could.
