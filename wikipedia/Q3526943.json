The tour had come as a reward for his most prolific season with the bat, when he scored 1,629 runs in 20 matches, including a career best 268 not out, at an average of 49.36.  He was named one of Wisden's cricketers of the year in 1912.  A left-handed batsman and occasional right arm bowler, Kinneir made his debut for Warwickshire in 1898 and played for the team until 1914.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jack Hobbs", "response": ["Hobbs was an automatic selection for the MCC tour of Australia in the winter of 1911\u201312.Arlott, p. 59.McKinstry, p. 121.

Rhodes was in the team, but did not open the batting owing to his poor form; Hobbs opened with Septimus Kinneir.McKinstry, p. 125. England recovered to win the second Test; after bowling Australia out for 184 and taking a first-innings lead of 81, the visiting team eventually faced a target of 219 to win. Hobbs and Rhodes, restored to the opening position, began with a partnership of 57. Hobbs scored 126 not out, his first century against Australia, and scored particularly well from the bowling of H. V. \"Ranji\" Hordern, a googly bowler who had taken 12 wickets in the first Test.McKinstry, p. 126. Wisden commented that Hobbs \"played one of the finest innings of his life\", and England won by eight wickets. Australia were once more bowled out for a low score in the third Test; this time Hobbs and Rhodes added 147 for the first wicket and Hobbs scored 187. England reached a total of 501 and won the match by seven wickets.McKinstry, p. 127."]}, {"page": "Septimus", "response": ["*Septimus Kinneir (1871\u20131928), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Kinneir", "response": ["#REDIRECT Septimus Kinneir"]}, {"page": "Sep Kinneir", "response": ["#REDIRECT Septimus Kinneir"]}, {"page": "Septimus Paul Kinneir", "response": ["#REDIRECT Septimus Kinneir"]}, {"page": "Early life of Jack Hobbs", "response": ["Hobbs was an automatic selection for the MCC tour of Australia in the winter of 1911\u201312, and in previewing the series, former Australian captain Harry Trott saw Hobbs as the key batsman.McKinstry, p. 121.

The side faced immediate difficulties when their captain, Pelham Warner became seriously ill shortly after scoring 151 in the opening game. Warner named Johnny Douglas his replacement as leader, a decision which pleased the team and Hobbs, an admirer of Douglas, in particular. However, several leading batsmen struggled for form in the opening games, including Hobbs.McKinstry, p. 124. Affected by sunstroke, Hobbs highest score, and only fifty, in seven innings before the Tests began was 88. Nor did Douglas' captaincy convince Australian critics at first.Mason, p. 85. Problems continued during the first Test, which Australia won by 146 runs, and Douglas faced severe criticism of his leadership. Hobbs scored 63 in the first innings, although by his own admission he did not play well, and 22 in the second.
