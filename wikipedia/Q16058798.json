She had suffered a severe injury in an accident aged 23 which prevented her from walking for two years, during which time she intensified her reading. She went on to study at Girton College, Cambridge, and whilst at the university she met- and later married- fellow student Alfred John Oakley. They then both changed their surname to Cooper-Oakley. . Alfred stayed some years at Adyar, India, as an assistant to Henry Steel Olcott. He left to become Registrar of the University of Madras. Sometime in the late 1890s, G.R.S. Mead became her brother-in-law when he married her sister, another prominent Theosophist, Laura Cooper.\nIsabel Cooper-Oakley died on March 3, 1914, at Budapest, Hungary.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Count of St. Germain", "response": ["The Comte de Saint Germain (;  \u2013 27 February 1784)Isabel Cooper Oakley, p45 was a European adventurer, with an interest in science, alchemy and the arts.

These include the Marquis de Montferrat, Comte Bellamarre, Chevalier Schoening, Count Weldon, Comte Soltikoff, Graf Tzarogy and Prinz Ragoczy.Spellings used are those given in The Comte de St. Germain by Isabel Cooper-Oakley In order to deflect enquiries as to his origins, he would make far-fetched claims, such as being 500 years old, leading Voltaire to sarcastically dub him \"The Wonderman\" and that \"He is a man who does not die, and who knows everything\".Comte de Saint-Germain (French adventurer) - Britannica Online Encyclopedia.

Milan, Italy: Ars Regia, 1912. However, this would account for his wealth and fine education. The will of Francis II R\u00e1k\u00f3czi mentions his eldest son, Leopold George, who was believed to have died at the age of four. The speculation is that his identity was safeguarded as a protective measure from the persecutions against the Habsburg dynasty. At the time of his arrival in Schleswig in 1779, St. Germain told Prince Charles of Hesse-Kassel that he was 88 years old.S. A. Le Landgrave Charles, Prince de Hesse, M\u00e9moires de Mon Temps, p. 133. Copenhagen, 1861.

It is a compilation of letters, diaries, and private records written about the count by members of the French aristocracy who knew him in the 18th century.
