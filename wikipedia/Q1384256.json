This was followed by the release of his sixth album, Hit the Ground Running, in 2017. In November and December 2018, Faulkner starred as the Sung Thoughts of the Journalist in the 40th anniversary musical version of Jeff Wayne's War of the Worlds.On December 10, 2018, Faulkner announced through social media channels the forthcoming release of The Very Best of Newton Faulkner...So Far, featuring 31 songs: selected songs from his six studio albums, three new tracks, and recordings of \"all the covers I play live, from 'Bohemian Rhapsody' to \u2019Send Me On My Way' and a track I promised myself I'd never record!\" A new Christmas-themed track called \"Wake Up\" was previewed on his website to promote the album.
