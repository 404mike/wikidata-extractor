He was a fellow of the Royal Society and Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Atom", "response": ["The development of the mass spectrometer allowed the mass of atoms to be measured with increased accuracy. The device uses a magnet to bend the trajectory of a beam of ions, and the amount of deflection is determined by the ratio of an atom's mass to its charge. The chemist Francis William Aston used this instrument to show that isotopes had different masses. The atomic mass of these isotopes varied by integer amounts, called the whole number rule. The explanation for these different isotopes awaited the discovery of the neutron, an uncharged particle with a mass similar to the proton, by the physicist James Chadwick in 1932. Isotopes were then explained as elements with the same number of protons, but different numbers of neutrons within the nucleus."]}, {"page": "November 20", "response": ["*  1945   \u2013 Francis William Aston, English chemist and physicist, Nobel Prize laureate (b. 1877)"]}, {"page": "September 1", "response": ["*1877 \u2013 Francis William Aston, English chemist and physicist, Nobel Prize laureate (d. 1945)"]}, {"page": "Trinity College, Cambridge", "response": ["|Francis William Aston"]}, {"page": "1945", "response": ["* November 20 \u2013 Francis William Aston, British chemist, Nobel Prize laureate (b. 1877)"]}, {"page": "1877", "response": ["** Francis William Aston, English chemist, Nobel Prize laureate (d. 1945)"]}, {"page": "1922", "response": ["* Chemistry \u2013 Francis William Aston"]}, {"page": "J. J. Thomson", "response": ["In 1897, Thomson showed that cathode rays were composed of previously unknown negatively charged particles (now called electrons), which he calculated must have bodies much smaller than atoms and a very large charge-to-mass ratio. Thomson is also credited with finding the first evidence for isotopes of a stable (non-radioactive) element in 1913, as part of his exploration into the composition of canal rays (positive ions). His experiments to determine the nature of positively charged particles, with Francis William Aston, were the first use of mass spectrometry and led to the development of the mass spectrograph.", "One of Thomson's greatest contributions to modern science was in his role as a highly gifted teacher. One of his students was Ernest Rutherford, who later succeeded him as Cavendish Professor of Physics. In addition to Thomson himself, six of his research assistants (Charles Glover Barkla, Niels Bohr, Max Born, William Henry Bragg, Owen Willans Richardson and Charles Thomson Rees Wilson) won Nobel Prizes in physics, and two (Francis William Aston and Ernest Rutherford) won Nobel prizes in chemistry. In addition, Thomson's son (George Paget Thomson) won the 1937 Nobel Prize in physics for proving the wave-like properties of electrons."]}, {"page": "List of chemists", "response": ["*Francis William Aston (1877\u20131945), 1922 Nobel Prize in Chemistry"]}, {"page": "Cavendish Laboratory", "response": ["# Francis William Aston (Chemistry, 1922)"]}]}}
