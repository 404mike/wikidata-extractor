The two had plans to call their group The Pigeons but later changed their minds. As they pulled together songs for their debut EP, Champion Versions, they added Robin Jones (drums), John Maclean (DJ, sampler, keyboards), and Steve Duffield (bass). While living in a flat in Shepherd's Bush they met Phil Brown, who after hearing their demo took it to Miles Leonard, who promptly signed the band. Duffield quit the band soon after recording Champion Versions. Not long after they were signed to Regal/Parlophone, Anderson became ill and quit the band. He later produced recordings under the name Lone Pigeon.
