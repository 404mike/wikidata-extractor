A precocious child, by the age of 15 she had learned navigation from her sea captain father and went on to obtain her Masters Certificate. She taught navigation in a school she founded to help local seamen better themselves. In 1865 she won the crown in the Aberystwyth National Eisteddfod under the bardic name of Cranogwen. She became a popular lay-preacher and eventually gave up school teaching to concentrate on preaching and on establishing the South Wales Women's Temperance Union in 1901 to counter the harm done by alcohol among the working classes."]}, {"page": "1916 in Wales", "response": ["*27 June - Sarah Jane Rees (Cranogwen), writer and temperance activist, 78"]}, {"page": "1839 in Wales", "response": ["*9 January \u2013 Sarah Jane Rees (Cranogwen), writer (d. 1916)"]}, {"page": "Cranogwen", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sarah Jane Rees"]}, {"page": "List of Welsh women writers", "response": ["*Sarah Jane Rees (1839\u20131916), teacher, poet and temperance campaigner"]}, {"page": "List of Welsh women", "response": ["*Sarah Jane Rees (1839\u20131916), teacher, poet, temperance campaigner"]}, {"page": "Women's suffrage in Wales", "response": ["One of the first periodicals to launch after the publication, and in direct response to, the 'Blue Books' was Y Gymraes (The Welshwoman). Its editor Evan Jones (1820-1852) known by his bardic name of \"Ieaun Gwynedd\" was seen as a champion of Welsh women following his detailed defence of their morality following the controversy surrounding the Report. Y Gymraes, launched in January 1850, set out to create the 'perfect' Welshwoman, a virtue of morality, sobriety and thrift, a beacon that would see the Welsh nation above all future criticism. As early as the autumn of 1851, with the health of its editor failing, Y Gymraes was merged with the monthly penny periodical Y Tywysydd (The Guide), and became Y Tywysydd a'r Gymraes in early 1852. Despite its title the majority of the contributors were men, and the publication continued to emphasise the importance of high moral standards rather than give practical advice. Although the publication continued into the 1880s, it eventually made way for Y Frythones (The Female Briton) under the editorship of Sarah Jane Rees. Although these periodicals had their roots in the temperance movement, and many of the articles within their pages were frivolous, by the 1880s they began broaching the topic of female emancipation."]}, {"page": "Alice Gray Jones", "response": ["The earliest of her poems in print were published in 1874, and by 1880 she was recognised as a poet, journalist and contributor to many periodicals.

In Cardiff, the only statue of a woman who actually lived was that of Boudicca in the City Hall. This contrasted with the number of statues of famous men, including Aneurin Bevan, Ivor Novello and Lloyd George. In 2016, Helen Molyneux (the Chair of the Institute of Welsh Affairs), Carolyn Hitt, and the Welsh Women's Equality Network, organised 'Monumental Welsh Women', a task force to tackle this imbalance. In 2019, the BBC ran the 'Hidden Heroines' campaign to decide who should be the subject of Cardiff's first statue of a named woman, decided by a public vote. Five women were shortlisted: the poet and teacher Cranogwen (Sarah Jane Rees), the suffragette Lady Rhondda (Margaret Haig Thomas), the political organiser Elizabeth Andrews, the writer and anthropologist Elaine Morgan, and Betty Campbell."]}, {"page": "List of women writers (M\u2013Z)", "response": ["*Sarah Jane Rees (1839\u20131916, Wales), poet & teacher"]}]}}
