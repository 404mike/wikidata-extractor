He was educated at Finchley Catholic Grammar School and King's College London (LLB).His father, Gaudenzio Rossi, came to London in 1919 after serving in the Italian Army in the First World War.Rossi was elected a councillor on Hornsey Borough Council 1956\u201365, serving as deputy mayor 1964\u201365, and on the successor London Borough of Haringey from 1964. He was also a Middlesex County Councillor 1961\u201365. Rossi was Member of Parliament (MP) for Hornsey from 1966 to 1983, and (after boundary changes) for Hornsey and Wood Green, 1983 to 1992.\nA junior minister in the governments of Edward Heath and Margaret Thatcher, he was on the 'One Nation' wing of the party. Michael Heseltine praised his social housing ideas (especially Right to Buy) as fundamental to Conservative general election successes. He retired in 1992, after which the Conservative Party lost the Hornsey and Wood Green seat, when his successor as Conservative candidate, Andrew Boff, was defeated by the Labour Party.\nRossi was knighted in Thatcher's 1983 Dissolution Honours List.He died in April 2020 at the age of 92.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Michael Heseltine", "response": ["During the 1980s over a million council houses \u2013 around 20% of the stock \u2013 were sold, and by 1987 Labour had dropped their opposition to the Right to Buy. This was an enormous social change, doing much to increase Conservative support amongst new homeowners and which Heseltine often cites as one of his major achievements.Crick 1997, pp. 200\u20131. Heseltine noted that, \"no single piece of legislation has enabled the transfer of so much capital wealth from the state to the people.\" He said that the 'right to buy' policy had two main objectives: to give people what they had wanted, and to reverse the trend of ever-increasing dominance of the State over the life of the individual. He said: \"There is in this country a deeply ingrained desire for home ownership. The Government believe that this spirit should be fostered. It reflects the wishes of the people, ensures the wide spread of wealth through society, encourages a personal desire to improve and modernize one's own home, enables parents to accrue wealth for their children and stimulates the attitudes of independence and self-reliance that are the bedrock of a free society.\"\"Housing Bill \u2013 Provisions and Enactment\" in Keesing's Contemporary Archives v. 27, January 1981 p. 30644. Many of the homes sold were \"street properties\" rather than flats, which arguably helped to ghettoise the remaining council tenants on run-down inner city estates. In fact, in Crick's view, he deserves only limited credit \u2013 it had been a Conservative commitment since 1974, and much of the detailed work was done by his juniors Hugh Rossi (in opposition) and John Stanley (in government)."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1987 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Sir Hugh Rossi"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1983 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Hugh Rossi"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1979 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Hugh Rossi"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the October 1974 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Hugh Rossi"]}, {"page": "John Townend", "response": ["At the 1979 general election Townend was elected as the Conservative Party Member of Parliament for Bridlington, East Riding of Yorkshire, a seat which he held until his retirement in 2001.
