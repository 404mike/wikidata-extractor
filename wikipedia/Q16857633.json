Possibly the best critique was Thomas Kerchever Arnold, Remarks on the Rev E. B. Elliott's Horae Apocalypticae London: Rivingtons (1845) to which Elliott produced a Reply to ... London: Rivingtons (1845). At the other extreme Elliott had to contend with numerous unauthorised abridgments of his long work as well as unacknowledged plagiarism in the case of Albert Barnes by those who disagreed either his method or his conclusions.Elliott's system defined the relationship between prophecy and world history very tightly - as his standard of proof required. As a result, his fiercest disputes were with those closest to his own point of view. An earlier work An Exposition of the Book of Revelation by Henry Gauntlett, London: Seeley (1821) p. 54 had suggested the wisdom of a gentler approach, \"It is necessary, for obvious reasons, that prophecy should be involved in clouds of obscurity previously to its fulfilment ... But it has this peculiar and astonishing property connected with it: - the fulfilment dissipates the clouds and renders the objects of the predictions distinct and defined ... The Author of prophecy never intended to make us prophets,\" too. Gauntlett's book is unjustly forgotten for it remains one of the most readable and thought-provoking introductions to Revelation. These attacks intensified as Elliott's timetable began to break down. His original scheme anticipated \"the time of the end\" as forecast in Daniel 12:12 closing around 1865. He held to the view of a pre-millennial advent of Christ. As the mid-1860s approached undramatically, he was forced to shift his timeframe so that the end was no longer anticipated until 1941.Horae Apocalypticae Vol 1 p. xxiv This perceived change of heart caused considerable scoffing in the popular press."]}, {"page": "Prophetic conference", "response": ["The Society for the Investigation of Prophecy was founded in 1826 by Frere, Irving and Lewis Way. Way was involved with the London Jews' Society, and in 1822 had written as \"Basilicus\" in its publication The Jewish Expositor on the Second Coming. His view on the personal reign of Christ at Jerusalem was contested by Henry Gauntlett, and a controversy resulted. Samuel Roffey Maitland, author of An Enquiry into the Grounds on which the Prophetic Period of Daniel and St. John has been supposed to consist of 1,260 Years (1826), contended against the prevailing interpretative conventions for prophecy of the 1820s."]}, {"page": "Henry Gauntlett (clergyman)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Henry Gauntlett (priest)"]}]}}
