The 1988 festival opened with  Harry Kupfer's grim interpretation of Das Rheingold, in which Wotan and the other gods were represented as gangsters in mafioso sunglasses. This entire Ring, says Spotts, was \"a parable of how the power-hungry cheat, lie, bully, terrorise and kill to get what they want\". In August Everding's Chicago Reingold (which would become part of a full Ring cycle four years later), the Rhinemaidens were attached to elasticated ropes manipulated from the wings, which enabled them to cavort freely through the air, using lip sync to co-ordinate with off-stage singers. Edward Rothstein, writing in The New York Times, found the production \"a puzzle ... cluttered with contraptions and conceits\"  which, he imagined, were visual motifs which would be clarified in later operas.  Keith Warner, in his 2004 production for Covent Garden, portrayed, according to Barry Millington's analysis, \"the shift from a deistic universe to one controlled by human beings\". The dangers of subverted scientific progress were demonstrated in the third Rheingold scene, where Nibelheim was represented as a medical chamber of horrors, replete with vivisections and \"unspeakable\" genetic experiments."]}, {"page": "Andrea Ch\u00e9nier", "response": ["The Keith Warner-directed production was performed in 2011 and 2012 in Bregenz, Austria, under the name of \"Andr\u00e9 Ch\u00e9nier\", using an almost 78-foot high statue of a dying Jean-Paul Marat sinking in the water, an ode to the 1793 Jacques-Louis David painting, The Death of Marat, which depicts the murdered revolutionary slumped over in his bathtub.Austrian Opera Recreates David's \"Death of Marat\" for a Revolutionary Production on Lake Constance artinfo.com"]}, {"page": "Passion (musical)", "response": ["The musical had its Italian premiere at the Cantiere Internazionale d'Arte of Montepulciano on July 12, 2019, directed by Keith Warner.
