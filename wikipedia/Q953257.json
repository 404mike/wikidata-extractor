Viewing figures had been steadily increasing since the popular Free George Jackson plot of 1984, but they rose to unprecedented levels in July 1985 during an extreme and hard-hitting siege storyline which saw three characters held hostage at gunpoint.Brookside. The First 10 Years. The Authorised History. Boxtree. Page 98 At this point, the show was only in its third year and number 7 Brookside Close was then home to young nurses Sandra Maghie (Sheila Grier) and Kate Moses (Sharon Rosita), and former hospital porter Pat Hancock (David Easter). They rented the property from Harry and Edna Cross, who had moved into the bungalow next door after Harry suffered a serious angina attack. Through their nursing, they encountered John Clarke (Robert Pugh), whose elderly mother eventually died of natural causes in hospital, while under their care. Gradually, John's instability grew into insanity as he was unable to cope with the death of his mother, and he forced his way into number 7 armed with a gun and ready to avenge his mother's death. He held the three hostage for several days in a tense three-episode run with Brookside Close sealed off and surrounded by armed police. The siege culminated in three shots resulting in the death of Kate followed by John's suicide. Some critics took issue with the unlikely plot-premise; for example, Hilary Kingsley described it as \"ludicrous\" in her book Soap Box, while others were critical of the producers' decision to kill off Kate, the series' only black character.Kingsley, p. 47 Viewers disagreed and ratings were pushed to over 8 million for the first time.20 Years of Brookside by Graham Kibble-White.

Boxtree. Page 99 In September, Brookside's longest-serving family, the Corkhills, arrived. The first generation to appear in the Close were Billy (John McArdle) and Doreen (Kate Fitzgerald), who moved into number 10 with their children Rod (Jason Hope) and Tracy (Justine Kerrigan). Stories involving the Corkhills were strongly concerned with marital problems and debt. With Billy languishing on the dole, Doreen struggled to raise money to support her desperate family. Doreen's interfering mother, Julia Brogan (Gladys Ambrose), followed the family and became a hugely popular comedy character, often dropping in to see her daughter at the most inappropriate moments. Julia remained in the series for well over a decade, long after her daughter and grandchildren moved on."]}, {"page": "Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World", "response": ["* Robert Pugh as John Allen, Master"]}, {"page": "Casualty (TV series)", "response": ["Casualty follows the professional and personal lives of the medical and ancillary staff of Holby City Hospital's emergency department.
