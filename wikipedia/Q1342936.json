Johnston, who played as a forward, started his senior football career with Partick Thistle in 1981. He moved to Watford in 1983, where he scored 23 league goals and helped them reach the 1984 FA Cup Final. In 1984 he joined Celtic and scored 72 goals in 128 matches, won the Scottish Cup in 1985 and the Scottish league championship in 1986. Johnston signed for Nantes in 1987. He returned to Glasgow with Rangers in 1989, becoming the second player to cross the Old Firm divide since World War II (Alfie Conn was first) and the first open Catholic to play for Rangers since World War I.\nJohnston won two Scottish league titles with Rangers, scoring 46 goals in 100 games. He later played for Everton, Hearts, Falkirk and American Major League Soccer (MLS) side Kansas City Wizards. Johnston received his first international cap for Scotland in 1984, when he was at Watford. He scored 14 goals in 38 appearances for Scotland, including one at the 1990 World Cup.\nAfter retiring as a football player in 2001, Johnston went on to coach in MLS. He was most recently the manager and later Director of Soccer at MLS club Toronto FC before he parted company with them on 14 September 2010.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sporting Kansas City", "response": ["The Kansas City Wiz played their first game on April 13, 1996, defeating the Colorado Rapids at Arrowhead Stadium, 3\u20130.

Although the confrontation between the two sets of supporters was often labelled as 'Sectarianism', 'Native-Immigrant tension' was an equally accurate catalyst for hostility between the two teams' supports in Scotland. Rangers' traditional support was largely from the Protestant community, and for decades the club had an unwritten rule whereby they would not knowingly sign a player of the Catholic faith. The policy was decried by Graeme Souness when he became manager, and he brought ex-Celtic forward Mo Johnston to the club in a very public move away from the practice, which no longer continues. Celtic's support was largely from those of Irish Roman Catholic backgrounds and while the club practiced no exclusion of Protestants and signed many of them to play for the team, there was a pro-Catholic mindset among some of the employees. One effect is that Scottish flags are rarer than might be expected amongst both sets of supporters; Celtic fans are more likely to wave the Irish tricolour while Rangers fans tend to wave the Union Jack.", "* Mo Johnston (Celtic 1984\u20131987, Rangers 1989\u20131991)"]}, {"page": "Jock Stein", "response": ["Scotland began their qualifying campaign for the 1986 FIFA World Cup with a 3\u20130 win over Iceland at Hampden Park in October 1984. Paul McStay scored twice in the first half, and came close to getting a hat-trick when he struck the crossbar in the second half. Charlie Nicholas scored Scotland's third goal. Stein observed that Scotland \"won with style\" and singled out winger Davie Cooper along with McStay for the flair they both displayed. The Scots turned in an even better showing in their next tie, a 3\u20131 home win over Spain. Two first half headed goals from Mo Johnston gave Scotland a 2\u20130 lead at half-time. Spain pulled a goal back in the second half, but with 18 minutes remaining Kenny Dalglish dribbled past three Spanish defenders before striking a powerful shot high into the net for Scotland's third. It was Dalglish's 30th international goal, equalling the record held by Denis Law. Stein described the win over Spain as \"the most satisfying since I became [Scotland] manager\", adding that \"we scored three goals against a quality team that came to defend\". Spanish manager Miguel Mu\u00f1oz praised the Scots' performance, describing them as \"tremendous\". Performances and results were more mixed in the later qualifying ties, losing the return match in Spain, going down to a 1\u20130 defeat against Wales in Glasgow and scraping a narrow 1\u20130 win over Iceland in Reykjav\u00edk.

That title win was the first of nine-in-a-row, but McCoist found himself in and out of the first team for the first three of those successes. During the 1990\u201391 season, Mo Johnston and new signing Mark Hateley were the preferred front pairing, and when McCoist attended the Cheltenham Festival when the players were given free time prior to back-to-back games against Celtic, he was dropped from the match squad by Souness and forced to apologise for 'breaching team discipline' in a press conference.

His most noteworthy act was the signing of Mo Johnston in 1989. Rangers, historically a team supported by Protestants, had for most of the 20th century a policy of refusing to sign Roman Catholics. Although there had been many Rangers players of Catholic faith, particularly before the sectarian divisions hardened after World War I, none of them were as high-profile as Johnston. He had previously played for Celtic, and had looked set to rejoin them from Nantes until Souness made an offer to sign him. Johnston publicly announced he would return to Celtic in a press conference at Celtic Park, but days later he signed for Rangers. Souness stated that religion was not an issue for him; his first wife was a Catholic and the children from that marriage were baptised Catholic. His main consideration was that Johnston was a good player, but he also believed that the signing would damage Celtic."]}, {"page": "Preki", "response": ["Preki left Chivas \"by mutual consent\" on 12 November 2009, following Chivas' failure to progress to the latter stages of the MLS playoffs.
