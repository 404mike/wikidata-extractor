Hon. Lord Justice Alan Ward ruled that the group, including some of its top leaders, had in the past engaged in abusive sexual practices involving minors and had also used severe corporal punishment and sequestration of minors. He found that by 1995 TF had abandoned these practices and concluded that they were a safe environment for children. Nevertheless, he did require that the group cease all corporal punishment of children in the United Kingdom and denounce any of Berg's writings that were \"responsible for children in TF having been subjected to sexually inappropriate behaviour\"."]}, {"page": "List of current members of the British Privy Council", "response": ["| Sir Alan Ward"]}, {"page": "The Children Act (novel)", "response": ["McEwan explains his inspiration in an essay he wrote for The Guardian which begins,  \"Some years ago I found myself at dinner with a handful of judges \u2013 a bench is the collective noun.

How easily, I thought at the time, this bench could be mistaken for a group of novelists discussing each other's work, reserving harsher strictures for those foolish enough to be absent.  At one point, our host, Sir Alan Ward, an appeal court judge, wanting to settle some mild disagreement, got up and reached from a shelf a bound volume of his own judgments. An hour later, when we had left the table for coffee, that book lay open on my lap. It was the prose that struck me first. Clean, precise, delicious. Serious, of course, compassionate at points, but lurking within its intelligence was something like humour, or wit, derived perhaps from its godly distance, which in turn reminded me of a novelist's omniscience.\"Ian McEwan: the law versus religious belief, The Guardian, Friday 5 September 2014.Sarah E Green, solicitor at TLT, reviews Ian McEwan\u2019s latest novel which concerns a High Court judge in the Family Division Retrieved 2015-03-30."]}, {"page": "List of Privy Counsellors (1952\u2013present)", "response": ["*Sir Alan Ward (b. 1938)"]}, {"page": "Lord Justice Ward", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alan Ward (judge)"]}, {"page": "Alan Hylton Ward", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alan Ward (judge)"]}, {"page": "David Foskett", "response": ["On 1 June 2019, Sir David took up the role of Chair of the Civil Mediation Council.
