Born in Luton, Udezue was raised in Saudi Arabia and England and graduated from St Edmund Hall, Oxford, in 2007. In 2006, he started his rapping career and pursued it full-time in 2011, and has released numerous albums. In July 2008, Udezue was misidentified and arrested by police at gunpoint at Bournemouth railway station due to miscommunication regarding a suspect's description. The suspect was a black man wearing a black t-shrt, and Udezue matched that description. The incident received media coverage and the police apologized for the incident, which was compared to the shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes. Udezue received numerous supportive messages from the public on social media.\nIn March 2019, Udezue received worldwide attention after posting a video on Twitter of himself performing a deadlift of 238 kg (525 lb) with a statement saying he had broken the British women's deadlift record while \"identifying as a woman\". Udezue said he does not think trans women should be allowed to compete in women's sports and said that he broke the record to demonstrate the flaws of the arguments of those who believe they should be. This added to the controversial issue of transgender people in sports.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Zuby (settlement)", "response": ["Zuby  is a settlement in the administrative district of Gmina Susiec, within Tomasz\u00f3w Lubelski County, Lublin Voivodeship, in eastern Poland.
