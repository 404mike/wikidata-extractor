Oldfield did everything in his power to make it impossible to make extracts and Virgin returned the favour by barely promoting the album.", "During the 1980s Oldfield became expert in the use of digital synthesizers and sequencers (notably the Fairlight CMI) which began to dominate the sound of his recordings: from the late 1990s onwards, he became a keen user of software synthesizers. He has, however, regularly returned to projects emphasising detailed, manually played and part-acoustic instrumentation (such as 1990's Amarok, 1996's Voyager and 1999's Guitars).", "* Amar", "* Amarok (1990)"]}, {"page": "List of one-word stage names", "response": ["* Amar (born 1982), British-Indian singer", "* Amarfis, Dominican singer-songwriter"]}, {"page": "Asian Underground", "response": ["*Amar (singer)"]}, {"page": "Tubular Bells III", "response": ["The tracks \"The Source of Secrets\", \"Jewel in the Crown\", and \"Secrets\" feature Amar as a vocalist.
