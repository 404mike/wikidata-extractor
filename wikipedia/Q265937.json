She was the youngest child of Mary Elizabeth, n\u00e9e Parsons, and Sir William Edmonstone, 4th Baronet. In 1891 she married George Keppel, an Army officer, and they had two daughters. Alice Keppel became one of the best society hostesses of the Edwardian era. Her beauty, charm and discretion impressed London society and brought her to the attention of the future King Edward VII in 1898, when he was still Prince of Wales, whose mistress she remained until his death, lightening the dark moods of his later years, and holding considerable influence.\nThrough her younger daughter, Sonia Cubitt, Alice Keppel is the great-grandmother of Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, the former mistress and second wife of Edward's great-great-grandson Charles, Prince of Wales.", "link_mentions": []}}
