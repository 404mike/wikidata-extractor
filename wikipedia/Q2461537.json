Points were awarded using a complex scoring system. A ball driven into the proper fairway scored 1 point. Two concentric circles were drawn on each green and a player scored 9 points for being inside the smallest circle in the regulation number of strokes, 8 for being inside the larger circle and 7 for being elsewhere on the green. A player missing the green could score 6, 5 or 4 points for their next shot (3rd shot on a par 4) or 3, 2 or 1 point if they took two strokes more than regulation to be on the green (4 strokes on a par 4). A player single-putting a hole scored 2 points for holing from within the smallest circle, 3 for holing from inside the larger circle and 4 for holing from elsewhere on the green or from off the green. A player two-putting scored 1 point. A player who failed to hole out in one more than the par had to pick up his ball. The system meant that a player might score as many as 11 points for par-4 (1 for hitting the fairway, 9 for being within the smaller circle and 1 for two-putting) they would only score 8 points if they had missed the fairway, then missed the green and saved par with a single putt. On the first day Abe Mitchell scored 173 points and led by 12 from Charles Corlett. Mitchell had the joint best score on the second day, with 164, and won by 18 points from Sandy Herd. The target competition was played in the morning and was followed by an exhibition match in the afternoon. The first day's exhibition match was a repeat of a famous 1906 foursomes match with Harry Vardon and J. H. Taylor playing James Braid and Sandy Herd.

Simond, Hillyard, Tolley, Najuch, Cazalet, and Dunkerley were tennis players themselves. Tolley was also a British Amateur golf champion, while Towle was a hotel magnate.

After Lenglen briefly left the court a third time for more cognac, Wills took a 15\u201330 lead in Lenglen's service game. The next point featured a long rally that ended with Lenglen hitting the ball cross-court near the intersection of the service line and the sideline. Although the shot was called good, it is generally accepted that linesman Cyril Tolley missed the call. Reporter Don Skene in particular noted that it landed wide by \"three inches at least\". Wills, who typically had a calm demeanor, became enraged and screamed at Tolley to question his call. Although the spectators also backed Wills, the call stood and Lenglen ended up winning the game. Wills then held serve in a game that went to deuce. Lenglen followed suit with a hold to love to keep the set level at 5\u20135."]}]}}
