This had meant a lot was expected of the club to challenge for the title and they started the season with an impressive 3\u20130 win over Warren Feeney's Linfield and several wins over Glenavon and eventual champions Crusaders They also showed the capability of being champions when in a match against basement side Institute; with the match leveled at 1\u20131 in the dying minutes, Michael Gault scored a late, long distance effort to secure the three points amid the sense of relief for all those at the match. However, a shock 2\u20131 defeat away to Warrenpoint Town saw The Ports blow a chance to go seven points clear in the NIFL Premiership, and losing 3\u20132 to Linfield, with Ross Redman missing a penalty in the final minute of the match. This saw The Ports fall away in the league, but in the Irish Cup quarter-final, they took on Linfield once again at Shamrock Park, with Chris Casement putting the home side 1\u20130 up with a penalty very early on, and a superb performance from Scot Gary Twigg pitching in with a simple finish after a mistake from Linfield defender Glenn Belezika and a magnificent first-time finish had meant Portadown were 3\u20130 up after about 30 minutes. They went on to win the match 3\u20132 with a huge home crowd staying well after the final whistle to show their appreciation."]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Oldham Athletic A.F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"right\"|41||||DF||align=\"left\"|Glenn Belezika"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Oldham Athletic A.F.C. season", "response": ["| Glenn Belezika", "| width=50px|27 || width=50px|DF || width=300px|Glenn Belezika || width=50px|3 || width=50px|3 || width=50px|0 || width=50px|3 || width=50px|3 || width=50px|0 || width=50px|0 || width=50px|0 || width=50px|0 || width=50px|0 || width=50px|0 || width=50px|0 || width=50px|0 || width=50px|0 || width=50px|0"]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Oldham Athletic A.F.C. season", "response": ["The Latics faced a summer of rebuilding on and off the pitch as 18 players were out of contract from the 2012\u201313 season and work finally recommenced on the demolition of the old Broadway Stand in preparation for its replacement by the new North Stand.
