In the words of Lyndall Gordon, his widow acted as \"fairy godmother\"  to early feminist Mary Wollstonecraft, then a young and unpublished schoolmistress, helping her to set up her own boarding school.

He arrived in 1758 with his wife Sarah, and took up residence in No. 54 the Green, in the middle of a terrace even then a hundred years old (The building still survives as London's oldest brick terrace, dated 1658). Many important politicians, thinkers, reformers, and writers visited him at Newington Green, including Founding Fathers of the United States, British politicians such as Lord Lyttleton, the Earl of Shelburne, Earl Stanhope (known as \"Citizen Stanhope\"), and even the Prime Minister William Pitt ; philosophers David Hume and Adam Smith; agitators such as prison reformer John Howard, gadfly John Horne Tooke and husband and wife John and Ann Jebb.

Governor Bernard of Massachusetts speculated privately that the letters might originate from New York. Lord Hillsborough, Secretary of State for the Colonies, might have suspected Benjamin Franklin of authoring the letters, as Franklin related to his son in a letter: \"My Lord H. mentioned the Farmer's letters to me, said he had read them, that they were well written, and he believed he could guess who was the author, looking in my face at the same time as if he thought it was me. He censured the doctrines as extremely wild, &c.\" Franklin in turn speculated that a \"Mr. Delancey\", possibly a reference to Daniel Dulany, might be the author. Due to the initial anonymity of the author, the character of \"the farmer\" attained a lasting reputation independent of Dickinson. \"The farmer\" was the subject of numerous official tributes throughout the colonies, such as a paean written by the town of Boston on the suggestion of Samuel Adams, and was sometimes compared to Whig heroes such as William Pitt and John Wilkes. The letters sparked limited critical reactions in the colonies, such as a series of satirical articles organized by the speaker of the Pennsylvania assembly, Joseph Galloway, which like the original Letters appeared in the Pennsylvania Chronicle. The response to the letters was substantially critical in England with only a few favorable views, such as from Granville SharpBritain and the American Revolution, by H. T. Dickinson, p. 168 and James Burgh.Neither Kingdom Nor Nation, By Neil Longley York, p. 88An English Audience for American Revolutionary Pamphlets Tory papers in England rebutted Dickinson's constitutional argument by arguing that the colonists were virtually represented in Parliament, and by emphasizing the indivisibility of Parliament's sovereignty in the Empire; these rebuttals were not widely circulated in the colonies. Praise for the letters in English Whig newspapers were more widely reprinted in the colonies, producing a skewed impression in the colonies of the English reaction."]}, {"page": "List of people from the London Borough of Hackney", "response": ["|James Burgh"]}, {"page": "Thomas Brand Hollis", "response": ["Brand Hollis was in 1780 a founder of the Society for Constitutional Information, and a local member of the Yorkshire Association.

Charles Morton (1626\u20131698), the educator and minister who ended his career as vice-president of Harvard College, ran an influential academy; the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography judges Morton's \"probably the most impressive of the dissenting academies [prior to 1685], enrolling as many as fifty pupils at a time\". The ODNB goes on to describe its advanced and varied curriculum (religion, classics, history, geography, mathematics, natural science, politics, and modern languages) and a well-equipped laboratory, and even \"a bowling green for recreation\". Lectures were given in English, not Latin, and Daniel Defoe, one of Morton's students, praised its attention to the mother tongue. Samuel Wesley the elder, a contemporary of Defoe's, described his teacher \"as universal in his learning\", although he also attacked the academy on uncertain grounds for promoting king-killing doctrines. James Burgh, author of The Dignity of Human Nature and Thoughts on Education, opened his dissenting academy there in 1750.Gordon, Lyndall (2005), Vindication: A Life of Mary Wollstonecraft.
