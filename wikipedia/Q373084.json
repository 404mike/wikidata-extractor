He has reached the last-16 in four world ranking events (three in Asia, in three different seasons, and at the 2008 Grand Prix), but has yet to progress beyond that stage. He has yet to qualify for the final stages of the World Championship.\nWhile practising in 2003 he pulled off the remarkable feat of compiling three 147 breaks in 4 frames, the only player to do so. He has not been able to bring that kind of form to the tournaments, but he has compiled a 147 in tournament play. He is noted for taking a long time to play safety shots.Notable victories he achieved during the 2007\u201308 season included beating Marco Fu 5\u20133 in last 48 of the Northern Ireland Trophy, and Matthew Stevens 9\u20137 at the same stage of the 2007 UK Championship from 5\u20137 behind, to qualify for the final stages of the event played in his home town for the first time. He lost to Peter Ebdon 5\u20132 and Ding Junhui 9\u20133 in the last 32 of both tournaments respectively, but his consistent performances took him up to number 36 in the 2008/2009 rankings. He also had a notable run in the 2008 Grand Prix, upsetting former World Champion Shaun Murphy 5\u20133 in the first round (Murphy went on to win the UK Championship and reach the final of the World Championship later in the same season), then coming from 3\u20130 down against Steve Davis to level at 3\u20133 and 4\u20134 and led by over forty points in the deciding frame, before Davis produced a great clearance to the pink to snatch victory.\nThe 2011/12 season was rather average only qualifying for 2 of the 8 ranking events, the UK Championship and the German Masters, both losing in the first round to Mark Allen and Stephen Lee. At the end of the season, he finished No 69 outside the top 64, but he played in the Q School events but did not manage to qualify for the main tour by reaching the Quarter-finals in any of the 3 events and then lost his place in the main tour soon afterwards.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Adrian", "response": ["*Adrian Gunnell (born 1972), English snooker player"]}, {"page": "Steve Davis", "response": ["He qualified for the 2010 World Snooker Championship, his 30th time at the event, by defeating Adrian Gunnell 10\u20134.
