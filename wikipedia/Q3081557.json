The person who originally formulated the hypothesis was Henry Power in 1661. Boyle in 1662 included a reference to a paper written by Power, but mistakenly attributed it to Richard Towneley. In continental Europe the hypothesis is sometimes attributed to Edme Mariotte, although he did not publish it until 1676 and was likely aware of Boyle's work at the time."]}, {"page": "Linus", "response": ["*Francis Line (also known as Linus of Li\u00e8ge) (1595\u20131675), English Jesuit priest and scientist"]}, {"page": "Writing of Principia Mathematica", "response": ["natural philosopher Robert Hooke,  Anthony Lucas, mathematical professor at Liege; Francis Line,"]}, {"page": "Francis Hall", "response": ["* Francis Hall, alias of the Jesuit priest Francis Line (1595\u20131675)"]}, {"page": "Linus of Li\u00e8ge", "response": ["#REDIRECT Francis Line"]}, {"page": "Linus of Liege", "response": ["#REDIRECT Francis Line R from alt name"]}, {"page": "Franciscus Linus", "response": ["#REDIRECT Francis Line R from alternate name"]}, {"page": "Gilbert Clerke", "response": ["In 1660 he issued his first work, De Plenitudine Mundi.
