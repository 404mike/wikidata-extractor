However, the validity of polygraph tests have been questioned by researchers to the point that they are rarely cited as a source of legal evidence in countries such as the United States, and its use on the show has been criticised, in spite of the show asserting the results to be infallible. At one point to prove the legitimacy of the \"lie detector\" test Jeremy Kyle performed a live on stage test with the question, \"Are you, or have you ever been, a llama?\" to which he replied yes, which was identified as a lie. Carole Cadwalladr wrote in The Observer in 2008: \"Kyle regularly claims the lie detector is 96 per cent accurate, whereas a 1997 survey of 421 psychologists estimated it to be 61 per cent. Or not much better than chance.\" Towards the end of the show, an on-screen disclaimer was shown before polygraph results were read out on the programme, stating, \"The lie detector is designed to indicate whether someone is being deceptive.

He stated that when he informed the producers of his bipolar disorder and borderline schizophrenia, \"There wasn't really a reaction\". His stepmother Karen commented that the show was \"so, so very wrong\" and \"almost like ritual abuse\".

In The Observer, Carole Cadwalladr was of the opinion that \"the show is built around creating a spectacle out of the damaged fragments of people's lives\" and summarised it as an \"explosive spectacle of anger, vitriol and confrontation\". Of Kyle, Cadwalladr said that \"Some of his opinions are so well-worn they're almost catchphrases\" and wrote in 2008 that the show was \"more like a witchcraft trial. Where the judge and jury is Jeremy Kyle\".
