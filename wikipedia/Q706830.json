He is known for his work on the Earth's magnetic field. He discovered that magnetic declination \u2013 the angle of dip of a compass needle \u2013 is not constant but changes over time. He announced this in 1635, relying on previous observations by others, which had not yet been correctly interpreted.He was the son of the physician Henry Gellibrand (1568\u20131615) and Mary Faversham. His four younger brothers were John, Edward, Thomas and Samuel. Samuel Gellibrand, became a prominent seventeenth century London bookseller.He also devised a method for measuring longitude, based on eclipses. The mathematical tables of Henry Briggs, consisting of logarithms of trigonometric functions, were published by Gellibrand in 1633 as Trigonometria Britannica.\nHe was Professor at Gresham College, succeeding Edmund Gunter in 1626. He was buried in St Peter Le Poer.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of geophysicists", "response": ["* Henry Gellibrand (English, 1597\u20131637) \u2013 discovered that magnetic declination varies with time"]}, {"page": "1637 in science", "response": ["* Henry Gellibrand, English mathematician (born 1597)"]}, {"page": "Gresham Professor of Astronomy", "response": ["| 4 || Henry Gellibrand || 2 January 1626/27"]}, {"page": "History of navigation", "response": ["In 1635, Henry Gellibrand published an account of yearly change in magnetic variation.."]}, {"page": "1597 in science", "response": ["* Henry Gellibrand, English mathematician (died 1637)"]}, {"page": "1590s in England", "response": ["** Henry Gellibrand, mathematician (died 1637)"]}, {"page": "Hannibal Potter", "response": ["The son Richard Potter, a prebendary of Worcester Cathedral, Hannibal Potter was educated at the King's School, Worcester under Henry Bright.

This was soon to be proved false by a series of measurements in London. In 1580, William Borough measured the declination and found it to be 11\u00b0 NE. In 1622, Edmund Gunter found it to be 5\u00b0 56' NE. He noted the difference from Borough's result but concluded that Borough must have made a measurement error. In 1633, Henry Gellibrand measured the declination in the same location and found it to be 4\u00b0 05' NE. Because of the care with which Gunther had made his measurements, Gellibrand was confident that the changes were real. In 1635 he published A Discourse Mathematical on the Variation of the Magneticall Needle stating that the declination had changed by more than 7\u00b0 in 54 years. The reality of geomagnetic secular variation was rapidly accepted in England, where Gellibrand had a high reputation, but in other countries it was met with skepticism until it was confirmed by further measurements."]}, {"page": "Index of physics articles (H)", "response": ["*Henry Gellibrand"]}, {"page": "Gellibrand (surname)", "response": ["* Henry Gellibrand (1597\u20131637), English mathematician"]}, {"page": "Tenerife meridian", "response": ["Cartographers like Mercator, Hondius and Blaeu played a significant role in the development of cartography around the turn of the seventeenth century. They were also among the first (in Europe) to deviate from the use of the Ferro meridian, which was based on the works of the Greek astronomer and geographer Ptolemy (c. AD 90 \u2013 c.\u2009168). Mercator used prime meridians through Fuerteventura, the Azores and Boa Vista. Other mapmakers put their reference meridians through different places in the Canaries, the Azores, or the Cape Verde. Near the end of his career Mercator came under the influence of the idea that there could be a nature-given reference line where no difference would be observed between geographic and magnetic poles. His lead was followed by cartographers like Abraham Ortelius and Jodocus Hondius. Both inconclusive observations and new scientific theory, in particular that of Henry Gellibrand, put an end to this theory in the first half of the seventeenth century."]}, {"page": "Magnes sive de Arte Magnetica", "response": ["Kircher was not the first scholar to write about magnetism.

Among Jesuit scholars, Leonardo Garzoni wrote Trattati della Calamita ('Treatise on the Lodestone') (around 1580) which described the double polarity of magnets.

Magnetism was an important theme in Kircher's 1664 work Mundus Subterraneus as well as his 1667 book Magneticum Naturae Regnum.
