He was elected at the 1935 general election as Member of Parliament (MP) for Stoke and served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade from 1945 to 1946. He was elected the first MP for the new Stoke-on-Trent South constituency when the seat was created in 1950, and served until his retirement in 1966.

Football resumed at Old Trafford on 8 March 1941, but another German raid on 11 March 1941 destroyed much of the stadium, notably the main stand (now the South Stand), forcing the club's operations to move to Cornbrook Cold Storage, owned by United chairman James W. Gibson. After pressure from Gibson, the War Damage Commission granted Manchester United \u00a34,800 to remove the debris and \u00a317,478 to rebuild the stands. During the reconstruction of the stadium, Manchester United played their \"home\" games at Maine Road, the home of their cross-town rivals, Manchester City, at a cost of \u00a35,000 a year plus a percentage of the gate receipts.Murphy, p. 45 The club was now \u00a315,000 in debt, not helped by the rental of Maine Road, and the Labour MP for Stoke, Ellis Smith, petitioned the Government to increase the club's compensation package, but it was in vain. Though Old Trafford was reopened, albeit without cover, in 1949, it meant that a league game had not been played at the stadium for nearly 10 years. United's first game back at Old Trafford was played on 24 August 1949, as 41,748\u00a0spectators witnessed a 3\u20130 victory over Bolton Wanderers.White (2008), p. 224"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1951 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Ellis Smith"]}, {"page": "Stoke-on-Trent South (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Ellis Smith"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1955 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Ellis Smith"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1959 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Ellis Smith"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1964 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Ellis Smith"]}, {"page": "Attlee ministry", "response": ["|rowspan=4|Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade||Ellis Smith||4 August 1945||\u00a0"]}, {"page": "Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade", "response": ["* 1945\u20131946 Ellis Smith"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1935 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Ellis Smith"]}, {"page": "Bessie Braddock", "response": ["In 1947 Bessie was elected to the Labour Party's National Executive Committee (NEC). At the time she was generally identified with the left wing of the party, and was associated with a grouping known as the \"Socialist Fellowship\", which espoused a programme of colonial freedom, workers' control and reduced arms expenditure. She resigned from the Fellowship in 1950, along with fellow-MPs Fenner Brockway and Ellis Smith, when it condemned the United Nations intervention in the Korean War. She continued her wholehearted campaigning on behalf of the poorest in the country, pleading with parliament to \"remember the queues outside the Poor Relief offices\", and castigating the \"New Look\" fashion of 1948 as wasteful, \"the ridiculous whim of idle people\". Bessie's fiery reputation did not harm her electorally; in the February 1950 general election, with the Exchange constituency greatly increased by boundary changes, her majority rose to 5,344. Nationally, Labour lost 76 seats, and its parliamentary majority was reduced to five. Attlee's second government was short-lived; in the October 1951 general election Bessie increased her personal majority again, to 6,834, but nationally Labour was defeated by the Conservatives and went into opposition."]}, {"page": "Stoke-on-Trent, Stoke (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Ellis Smith", "*Labour: Ellis Smith"]}, {"page": "Naming (parliamentary procedure)", "response": ["| Ellis Smith"]}, {"page": "United Patternmakers' Association", "response": [":1946: Ellis Smith"]}, {"page": "Florence Farmer", "response": ["Farmer was chairman of the local branch of the Labour Party between 1929 and 1931.
