Despite his exit, Shrewsbury manager Gary Peters said the pair could both return to Shrewsbury at the end of the season. He played his first Macclesfield game in a 1\u20130 defeat to Peterborough on 12 January, and scored his first goal as Macclesfield drew 1\u20131 with Milton Keynes Dons on 29 January. It was his only goal in his first eight games and he was dropped for Macclesfield's 3\u20130 defeat against Peterborough on 23 February when he came on as a substitute in the 44th minute. He returned to the side a week later for new manager Keith Alexander's first match against Notts County when Macclesfield were denied a victory by a late goal from Richard Butcher. While Symes was on loan at Macclesfield, Shrewsbury manager Peters left the club and was replaced with Paul Simpson, who promised Symes and other players out on loan that he would monitor their progress and build his own opinion of them. Macclesfield were involved in a relegation fight during Symes' stay and it was not until a 1\u20130 victory over Chesterfield on the penultimate weekend of the season that Macclesfield ensured they would be in the league the following season.

Shrewsbury had only qualified for the play-offs by defeating Dagenham & Redbridge in the final match of the regular season, enabling them to overtake their opponents in the league table and leave them in eighth place, one point outside the play-off places.  In the play-off semi-finals, Gillingham were paired with sixth-placed Rochdale and Shrewsbury with fourth-place finishers Bury.  Each semi-final was played on a two-legged basis, with one game at each team's home stadium and the result determined based on the aggregate score of the two games.  The first leg of Gillingham's semi-final, played at Rochdale's Spotland Stadium on 7 May 2009, finished in a 0\u20130 draw; BBC Sport commented that \"the two sides largely cancelled each other out\".  The first leg of the other semi-final, played on the same day at Shrewsbury's home ground, New Meadow, was decided by a late own goal from Shrewsbury's Neil Ashton, who accidentally lobbed the ball over his own goalkeeper Luke Daniels to give Bury a 1\u20130 win.", "|LB ||3 ||Neil Ashton"]}, {"page": "2007 Football League Two play-off Final", "response": ["Bristol Rovers had reached the play-off final in their sixth season back in the fourth tier of English football, having been relegated from the Second Division (equivalent of League One) in the 2000\u201301 season and Shrewsbury in their third season, after their promotion from the Football Conference in the 2003\u201304 season. The 2007 final was watched by a crowd of 61,589 people, a record for a fixture played at the fourth tier of English football, and refereed by Mike Jones. Shrewsbury opened the scoring through Stewart Drummond who scored after three minutes from a Neil Ashton free kick.  Richard Walker levelled the match midway through the first half when he scored from a Ryan Green cross.  Ten minutes before half-time, Walker scored his and Bristol Rovers' second goal after running clear and chipping the ball over Chris Mackenzie, the Shrewsbury Town goalkeeper.  Shrewsbury were reduced to ten players when Marc Tierney was sent off near the end of the match for two yellow cards before Sammy Igoe scored into an empty goal to give Bristol Rovers a 3\u20131 victory and promotion to League One.", "The match kicked off around 3p.m. on 26 May 2007 at Wembley Stadium in front of a crowd of 61,589. Three minutes into the match, Shrewsbury Town took the lead: Neil Ashton's free-kick from the right was met by Stewart Drummond  with a glancing header which sent the ball Bristol Rovers goalkeeper Steve Phillips into the bottom corner of the goal.  Ashton had an opportunity to equalise after Derek Asamoah's cross was passed on by Ryan Green but failed to connect with the ball.  In the 21st minute, Green took the ball down the right wing before crossing for Walker who struck the ball first time past Chris Mackenzie in the Shrewsbury Town goal.  Asamoah then found Cooke with a cross but the Shrewsbury striker was unable to convert the chance to score.  With ten minutes of the half remaining, Lewis Haldane passed the ball down the left, and after Richard Hope failed to make the interception, Walker took a controlling touch of the ball and lobbed it over MacKenzie to make it 2\u20131 before the interval.  Late in the second half, Shrewsbury Town's Marc Tierney was sent off after being shown a second yellow card following a late tackle on Campbell.  Two minutes into stoppage time, Shrewsbury Town won a corner for which their goalkeeper MacKenzie came up the pitch.

Creighton became a huge influence in the Wrexham side during the 2010/2011 season and played in the side that lost to Luton Town in the Conference Premier play-off semi-finals. In the 2011/2012 season Creighton again proved to be influential in the Wrexham defence playing a part in breaking the club record for the most clean sheets in a row for the club; goalkeeper Joslain Mayebi gave credit to his regular defence (Nathaniel Knight-Percival, Neil Ashton and Chris Westwood). Creighton played in massive matches for the Dragons during the 2011/2012 season including the FA Cup 3rd Round draw away to Brighton & Hove Albion and in the replay back at The Racecourse which Wrexham lost on penalties. He also took part in another play-off semi-final against Luton, which Wrexham lost for a second year running. In February 2012 Creighton signed a new two-year deal to keep him at the Racecourse until 2014. Creighton continued a successful pre-season into the 2012/2013 season, scoring against Woking on the first day of the season in a 3\u20131 win. But just three matches into the season he picked up a season-ending injury 6 minutes into an away match at Ebbsfleet United. During his time off the pitch Creighton set up his own business, Raw Ink Tattoo studio in nearby Coedpoeth. As well as his tattooing business Creighton also joined Welsh Premier League side Bala Town FC as a voluntary coach in January 2013. Creighton returned from injury on the final day of the 2012/2013 season in a match away to Mansfield Town. He took part in the following pre-season and started the first game of the 2013/2014 season against Welling United. His second game of the season came in the cross border derby against Chester, but in the first half he picked up another injury setting himself back once again. He returned from injury once again in a 1\u20133 loss away to his former club Kidderminster, coming on as a sub for Robert Ogleby in the 84th minute. He went on to play further games against Dartford FC and Forest Green Rovers, coming on as a sub in both matches. "]}]}}
