He is a session and road-tour percussionist who has worked with numerous musically diverse bands and artists including Peter Maffay, George Harrison, Billy Joel, Rick Wakeman, Eric Clapton, Pink Floyd and Elton John.\nCooper absorbed the influence of rock drummers from the 1960s and 1970s such as Ginger Baker, Carmine Appice and John Bonham. Incorporation of unusual instruments (for rock drummers of the time) such as cowbells, glockenspiel and tubular bells, along with several standard kit elements, helped create a highly varied setup. Continually modified to this day, Cooper's percussion set offers a large array of percussion instruments for sonic diversity such as the tambourine, congas, crash cymbals, cowbells, rototoms, tubular bells, the gong, snare drum and timpani.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Traveling Wilburys", "response": ["The five band members sat in a circle playing acoustic guitars in Stewart's kitchen;, event occurs between 3:40 and 4:08. once each song's basic track had been written and recorded there (with accompaniment from a drum machine), the group recorded their vocals in another room, usually after dinner each night.

Believe it or not, I'm in awe of you guys, and it's the same for me.\" While most of the songs had a primary composer, all of the band members were creative equals.

As the group's producers, Harrison and Lynne directed the sessions, with Harrison often auditioning each member to decide who should sing a particular lead vocal part.
