He then spent brief spells with Bristol Rovers, Shrewsbury Town, Kidderminster Harriers, and Forest Green Rovers, before moving to Ireland in 2005 to sign with Sligo Rovers. He helped Sligo to the League of Ireland First Division title in 2005, before moving on to Bohemians the following year. The club finished as League of Ireland Cup runners-up in 2007, and then League of Ireland and FAI Cup champions in 2008. He switched to Dundalk in 2009.

He scored some important goals during the season, including two against St. Patrick's Athletic on 11 August.

The following year following the departure of centre-backs Michael McNamara and Liam Burns Peers moved into the centre of defence and has been the rock at the heart of the Sligo defence ever since. Injuries forced him to miss much of the 2009 League of Ireland season and his presence was badly missed.
