He won three All-Ireland Senior Football Championship medals, two Under 21 medals, and a Minor medal. He was the 2005 All Stars Footballer of the Year, and won All Stars Awards in 2001, 2005 and 2009.\nHis style of play is quite traditional as a full forward, often getting on the end of passes, and scoring with his preferred left foot. It's his superior physical strength that sets him apart from his peers, coupled with his agility on the ball, making him very difficult to mark.\nO'Neill announced his retirement from the Tyrone Gaelic football team in January 2008, but made himself available for the All-Ireland final of the same year. Tyrone won the competition, but O'Neill refused to accept the medal, citing the fact that he felt he had not earned it, having not been part of the team on their journey to the final.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Strabane", "response": ["*Stephen O'Neill, member of the 2003, 2005 and 2008 All-Ireland winning Tyrone Gaelic football teams."]}, {"page": "List of Gaelic footballers", "response": ["|2005||Stephen O'Neill||Tyrone"]}, {"page": "Stranmillis University College", "response": ["* Stephen O'Neill; former Tyrone Gaelic footballer"]}, {"page": "Donemana", "response": ["*Stephen O'Neill, Tyrone All-Ireland-winning GAA "]}, {"page": "Greencastle, County Tyrone", "response": ["*In 2006 Our Lady of Lourdes Primary School in Greencastle launched a Cookery Book with recipes from Ireland's top GAA players, to mark the school's 25th Anniversary and raise funds for the Cormac McAnallen Trust.
