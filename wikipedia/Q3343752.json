He was influential in setting up National Parks in Malawi (Nyasaland), Zambia and Zimbabwe (Rhodesia) in the 1950s and 1960s. In Zambia, his vision of Conservation through Tourism led him to set up the country's first safari company, Norman Carr Safaris, with a focus on local employment and empowerment. He is widely regarded as the pioneer of walking safaris as part of non-consumptive tourism (photography safaris) in Africa.Carr helped establish the Rhino Trust in the 1970s (now under the WWF), helped return two lion cubs (Big Boy & Little Boy) to the wild, and provided wildlife education to local children in the South Luangwa Valley through the Kapani School Project, which has been running since 1986.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Zambians", "response": ["* Norman Carr \u2013 British wildlife conservationist who set up national parks in Zambia"]}, {"page": "Carr (name)", "response": ["*Harold Norman Carr (1887\u20131974), Canadian politician", "*Norman Carr (1912\u20131997), British conservationist"]}, {"page": "Kafue National Park", "response": ["Kafue National Park was established in the 1950s by Norman Carr, an influential British-Rhodesian conservationist."]}, {"page": "South Luangwa National Park", "response": ["It was initially created as Luangwa Game Reserve in 1904.

Guests shot with cameras and not rifles; thus the South Luangwa became the home of the photographic and walking safari.  Profits from this remote photographic camp in the bush went back into community and eco-tourism in Africa was born.
