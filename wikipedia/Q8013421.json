In her efforts to escape the blockade of New York President grounded on a sandbar but, after incurring damage, managed to break free into the Atlantic. Following the Royal Navy's standing orders, President was pursued by a squadron consisting of four frigates, one being a 56-gun razee. President was an extremely fast ship and successfully out-sailed the British squadron with the exception of , which has been regarded as the fastest ship in the age of fighting sail. Captain Henry Hope of Endymion had fitted his ship with Philip Broke's gunnery technology as used on Shannon. This gave him the slight advantage at range and he was able to slow President with rigging hits. Commodore Decatur commanding President had the advantage in scantling strength, firepower crew, and tonnage, but not in manoeuvrability. Despite having fewer guns, Endymion was armed with the larger 24-pounders just like President. Using her speed Endymion was able to position herself to rake President and following Broke's philosophy of \"Kill the man and the ship is yours\", fired into the hull severely damaging her. President was left shot holes below the waterline, ten to fifteen starboard guns disabled, water in the hold and shot from Endymion were later found inside the magazine. Decatur knew his only hope was to damage or disable the Endymions rigging and then outrun the rest of the squadron. However the cumulative damage told and he struck his colours. Both ships then paused to conduct repairs and Decatur took advantage of the fact Endymion had no boats intact to send over a prize crew with and attempted to escape under the cover of night. After the crew of the Endymion had quickly repaired her rigging, she, along with HMS Pomone and HMS Tenedos finally overtook and captured the damaged President. Later Decatur was to give unreliable accounts of the battle stating that President was already \"severely damaged\" by the grounding before the engagement, but was undamaged after the engagement with Endymion. He stated Pomone caused \"significant\" losses aboard President, although Presidents crew claim they were below deck gathering their belongings as they had already surrendered. Despite saying \"I surrender my ship to the captain of the black frigate\", Decatur also writes that he said, \"I surrender to the squadron\". Nevertheless, many historians such as Ian Toll, Theodore Roosevelt and William James quote Decatur's remarks to either enforce that Endymion alone took President or that President surrendered to the whole squadron, when actually it was something in-between."]}, {"page": "Carronade", "response": ["The East India Company (EIC) also used carronades, and these appear to be larger, and heavier than those that Royal Navy used. In his discussion of the single-ship action in which the French frigate Pi\u00e9montaise captured the East Indiaman Warren Hastings on 11 June 1805, the naval historian  William James compared the 18-pounder carronades on Warren Hastings with the 18-pounder carronades that the British Royal Navy used. The EIC 18-pounder was  long, and weighed 15.5 cwt; the Royal Navy's 18-pounder carronade was  and weighed 10.5 cwt (). James's figures show the EIC's 12-pounder carronades were   long, and weighed 8.5 cwt (); the Royal Navy's 12-pounder carronade was  and weighed 6.5 cwt ().James (1837), Vol. 4, pp.239\u201344."]}, {"page": "List of historians", "response": ["*William James (1780\u20131827), historian of the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars"]}, {"page": "Glorious First of June", "response": ["By early spring of 1794, the situation in France was dire. With famine looming after the failure of the harvest and the blockade of French ports and trade, the French government was forced to look overseas for sustenance. Turning to France's colonies in the Americas, and the agricultural bounty of the United States, the National Convention gave orders for the formation of a large convoy of sailing vessels to gather at Hampton Roads in the Chesapeake Bay, where Admiral Vanstabel would wait for them.

This was attributed to the Dutch tactics, mirrored by the British, of firing at the enemy hulls rather than attempting to disable their masts and rigging as in other continental navies.James, p. 71 The worst hit of the British ships were those in the first wave, such as Ardent with 148 casualties, Monarch with 136 and Belliqueux under Cpt John Inglis with 103, while both Adamant and Agincourt escaped without a single man killed or wounded. Among the dead were Captain Burges of Ardent and two lieutenants, while the wounded included Captain Essington of Triumph and twelve lieutenants. In total, British losses were recorded after the battle as 203 killed and 622 wounded, although later assessments based on charitable requirements of those wounded or killed gave the higher figures of 228 killed and 812 wounded, including 16 of the latter who subsequently died.James, p. 72 Many of the British ships were badly damaged, taking on large quantities of water through damaged hulls.James, p. 380 One of the worst hit was Venerable, which had to be completely dismantled and reconstructed after returning to Britain before the ship was ready for active service again.Tracy, p. 231", "De Winter's actions during the battle have been commended: Edward Pelham Brenton wrote in 1836 that \"The Dutch admiral displayed, in his own person, the most undaunted valour ... but was compelled at length to yield to superior skill, it would be untrue to say superior bravery.\"Brenton, p. 348 while William James noted in 1827 that after the battle \"\"Batavian prowess\" still claimed the respect of an enemy and the applause of the world\". De Winter was released from captivity in 1798 after news reached Britain that his wife had suffered a stroke, and he subsequently became the Batavian ambassador to France, before resuming command of the Dutch fleet at the start of the Napoleonic Wars. He was a trusted subordinate of Louis Bonaparte, King of Holland between 1806 and 1810, and was honoured by Emperor Napoleon in 1811 before his sudden death in Paris the following year."]}, {"page": "Frederick Chamier", "response": ["He also wrote nautical novels somewhat in the style of Marryat, including The Unfortunate Man (1835), Ben Brace, the Last of Nelson's Agamemnons (1836), The Arethusa (1837), Jack Adams, the Mutineer (1838), The Spitfire (1840), Tom Bowling (1841), a trilogy Count Konigsmark (1845) and Jack Malcolm's Log (1846). In addition, he continued William James's Naval History and wrote some books of travel.

George Cokayne notes in  The Complete Peerage (1913) that King George II revived the order when he created sixteen knights bannerets on the field of the Battle of Dettingen in 1743, and although his source for this, a diary entry by Gertrude Savile, states \"This honour had been laid aside since James I, when Baronets were instituted\", which contradicts other sources, a news magazine published in the same year as the battle recorded the honours. Several sources, including Edward Brenton (1828) and William James (1827), record that captains Trollope and Fairfax and were honoured with bannerets by King George III for their actions during the Battle of Camperdown (1797). However, these awards were never recorded in The London Gazette and is much more likely that these knighthoods, which first appear in formal records in December 1797 without their nature being specified, were as knights bachelor."]}, {"page": "Battle of San Domingo", "response": ["The victory, just four months after the success at Trafalgar, was celebrated in Britain and across the Empire, particularly in the Caribbean. Mere rumours of Leiss\u00e8gues' presence had stifled trade and caused panic among the merchant houses of the West Indies and Duckworth's victory helped to restore confidence in commercial ocean travel once more.Rose, p. 39 In Britain both the House of Commons and the House of Lords voted their thanks to the entire squadron when Duckworth's account of the action was read out, the motions led by Lord Grenville and Charles Grey, who both made expansive speeches in praise of Duckworth. Head money, a bounty on enemy servicemen killed, wounded or captured, was paid for 4,268 men, even though records showed that the French fleet carried significantly fewer men than that. Additional prize money was paid for the captured Jupiter and awards of money, ceremonial plate and ornate swords were made by patriotic societies and Lloyd's of London insurers. Admiral Louis was made a baronet and Cochrane a Knight Companion of the Order of the Bath, while a number of promotions were distributed among the first lieutenants.James, Vol. 4, p. 200 Duckworth, however, received nothing beyond his share of the general rewards. Vice-Admiral Lord Collingwood, commander in chief of the Mediterranean, was furious that Duckworth had deserted his post off Cadiz, failed to bring Willaumez to battle in December and then sailed for the West Indies to resupply rather than returning to the Spanish coast.  Historians William James and William Laird Clowes both considered that if Duckworth had not defeated Leiss\u00e8gues he would probably have faced a court martial.Clowes, p. 193  Duckworth's absence forced Collingwood to divert some of his own ships to the Cadiz blockade. The force provided still proved inadequate \u2013 on 26 February a French frigate squadron broke out of the port and escaped to Rochefort.Gardiner, p. 25 Collingwood's influence was enough to block additional rewards to Duckworth, who subsequently returned to the Mediterranean and in 1807 commanded the fleet at the ineffectual Dardanelles Operation.Duckworth, Sir John Thomas, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, A.

Ironically, Linois was eventually captured at the action of 13 March 1806 after mistaking a squadron of British ships of the line for a merchant convoy in the mid-Atlantic.The Victory of Seapower, Gardiner, p. 29 Linois was concerned throughout the engagement for the safety of his ships: with the nearest dockyard over  away at \u00cele de France, he could not afford to suffer severe damage to his rigging or masts that would leave his squadron crippled.Maffeo, p. 191 He also sought to defend his behaviour off Pulo Aura with the claim that the British convoy was protected by as many as eight ships of the line, and that he had performed heroically in saving his squadron from this overwhelming force.James, Vol. 3, p. 250 Subsequent historians have ridiculed this latter statement: William James wryly commented in his account of the action, written in 1827, that \"it would be uncharitable to call into question the courage of Rear-admiral Linois\"James, Vol. 3, p. 251 and William Laird Clowes said in 1900 that \"his timidity and want of enterprise threw away a great opportunity\".Clowes, p. 339 Nicholas Rodger, writing in 2004, was even more critical, insisting that \"his [Linois's] officers do not seem to have been fooled, and it is extremely difficult to believe that he was.\" He goes on to suggest that no experienced seaman could possibly have mistaken a poorly manned and poorly trained merchant crew for the crew of a real Royal Navy ship of the line, concluding that \"Linois had thrown away a prize worth at least \u00a38 million through mere timidity\". The most scathing criticism of Linois's conduct came from Napoleon himself, who wrote to Minister of Marine Denis Decr\u00e8s on the subject, stating:"]}, {"page": "Action of 25 September 1806", "response": ["It took some time for the British squadron to effect repairs on their ships and prizes in preparation for the journey back to Britain. They had suffered light casualties of nine killed and 29 wounded, but among the more seriously injured was Hood, whose arm had been amputated during the battle. French losses were much heavier but are unknown: Hood did not include them in his official report but promised to provide them soon afterwards in a follow up letter, which, if it was written, has never been located.James, p. 264 All four of the captured frigates were large new vessels that were immediately purchased for service in the Royal Navy, Gloire and Armide retaining their names while Infatigable became HMS Immortalite and Minerve became HMS Alceste. Although Hood and his men were commended at the time, subsequent historical focus has been on the bravery of the inexperienced French crews in resisting an attack by an overwhelming force for so long. William James wrote in 1827 of the \"gallant conduct on the part of the French ships\" and William Laird Clowes, writing in 1900 stated that \"The resistance offered by the French to a force so superior was in every way credible\".Clowes, p. 391James, p. 266"]}, {"page": "Battle of Groix", "response": ["In common with the battle of the Glorious First of June the previous year,James, p. 181 rewards for the British victory at Groix were unevenly distributed. Bridport's dispatch to the Admiralty was short and lacking in detail; the only officer commended was Bridport's own flag captain William Domett, whose ship had joined the action only in the last stages. The situation was worsened by the Parliament of Great Britain, which voted thanks for the battle but specifically named only Bridport, Lord Hugh Seymour and Vice-Admiral Sir Alan Gardner of Queen. This omitted not only the numerous captains who had taken part in the battle, but also Vice-Admiral John Colpoys of London, whose ship had been much more heavily engaged than Gardner's.Clowes, p. 265 Numerous historians have commented on these unexplained omissions, William James noting that Douglas and Queen Charlotte were particularly unfortunate in this regard as the admiral normally aboard, Rear-Admiral Sir Roger Curtis, was ashore at the court-martial of Captain Anthony Molloy and consequently the ship received no recognition despite being the most heavily engaged of any in the British fleet."]}]}}
