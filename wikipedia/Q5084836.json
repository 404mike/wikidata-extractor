After playing 12 matches for the \"Shots\" Tutin joined First Division Stoke City for \u00a3500. Standing at just 5\u00a0ft 4in he looked well out of place in Stoke's squad and he made a nightmare start. Tasked with marking Middlesbrough's Charlie Ferguson on his debut, Tutin left him unmarked twice as Stoke crashed to a 6\u20131 defeat. However, he soon got to grips with top flight football and his lack of height was his main asset as his job in the side was to win the ball back and play in the wingers Frank Soo and Stanley Matthews and it was a task he excelled at. He became an ever-present in the Stoke side in the mid 30s playing every match during the 1935\u201336 season as Stoke finished in 4th position their highest up to that point. He remained in Bob McGrory's team for two more seasons before losing his place to Jock Kirton."]}, {"page": "1940\u201341 Dumbarton F.C. season", "response": ["|  Charlie Ferguson"]}]}}
