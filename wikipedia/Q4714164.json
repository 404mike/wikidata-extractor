His teammate, Tommy Johnson, scored a club record of 38 league goals that season. Brook scored once, and Johnson scored five times, in a 6-2 defeat of Everton in September that season. In the 1929\u201330 football season Brook helped Manchester City to third in the league. The City team had been strengthened by the acquisition of the outside right Ernie Toseland and the wing half Matt Busby. Brook scored a brace in a 6-1 victory against Liverpool in October that season. Brook also scored in a 10-1 victory against Swindon Town in the fourth round of the 1929\u201330 FA Cup. City were defeated 2-1 by Hull City in the subsequent round. In the 1930\u201331 football season City bought the prolific Scottish centre forward Dave Halliday from Arsenal as a replacement for Tommy Johnson. Despite this, Brook was the club's top scorer that season with 16 goals, and was also the club's top scorer in 1935\u201336. He often played in the centre forward position for his club, roaming the pitch, which later drew comparisons with Don Revie and N\u00e1ndor Hidegkuti in this position. In the 1931\u201332 season the City team, which now included the Scottish centre forward Alec Herd, managed to reach the semi-final of the FA Cup but were defeated by Arsenal by 1\u20130 with a goal from Brook's England teammate Cliff Bastin.
