In some sources her name appears as Maria Jackson, Mary Jackson or Mary Elizabeth Jackson. She spent most of her life in Cheshire and Derbyshire, where she lived with her sister following her father's death.\nSocial conventions of the time obliged her to publish anonymously. She was influenced by Erasmus Darwin at a time when the new but controversial sexual classification of plants proposed by Linnaeus was becoming known in England. She published four books on the topic.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1829", "response": ["* October 10 \u2013 Maria Elizabetha Jacson, British botanist (b. 1755)"]}, {"page": "1755", "response": ["** Maria Elizabetha Jacson, British botanist (d. 1829)"]}, {"page": "1829 in literature", "response": ["*October 10 \u2013 Maria Elizabetha Jacson, English writer on botany and gardening (born 1755)"]}, {"page": "1755 in literature", "response": ["*Unknown date \u2013 Maria Elizabetha Jacson, English writer on botany and gardening (died 1829)"]}, {"page": "1829 in science", "response": ["* October 10 \u2013 Maria Elizabetha Jacson (born 1755), English botanist."]}, {"page": "1804 in science", "response": ["* Publication in London of Maria Elizabetha Jacson's Botanical Lectures by a Lady."]}, {"page": "1755 in science", "response": ["* Maria Elizabetha Jacson, English botanist (died 1829)."]}, {"page": "List of female scientists before the 20th century", "response": ["* Maria Elizabetha Jacson (1755\u20131829), English botanist"]}, {"page": "1829 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 10 October \u2013 Maria Elizabetha Jacson, botanist (born 1755)"]}, {"page": "List of 18th-century British children's literature authors", "response": ["* Maria Elizabetha Jacson (1755\u20131829)"]}, {"page": "Frances Jacson", "response": ["Frances Jacson was one of five surviving children of the Anglican rector of Bebington, Rev.
