After some early lessons from William Lloyd Webber he went on to study composition under Herbert Howells and violin under Isolde Menges at the Royal College of Music in London. Other teachers included Gordon Jacob (orchestration) and George Dyson (conducting). His first acknowledged score was the String Quartet No 1 of 1942, op 1. On leaving the college in 1944 Salzedo immediately became a freelance composer, supplementing his earnings by playing violin with the London Philharmonic Orchestra and the Royal Philharmonic. He worked closely with the Ballet Rambert, for whom his first ballet, The Fugitive, was commissioned in 1944, receiving over 400 performances over the following six years. In 1945 Salzedo married the dancer Pat Clover, and the two of them were both closely involved with Les Ballets N\u00e8gres, a mostly black dance group founded in 1946 by Berto Pasuka and Richie Riley. He wrote four scores for the group for piano, tom tom and maracas: De Prophet, They Came, Market Day and Aggrey.His most successful ballet was The Witch Boy based on the \u2018Ballad of Barbara Allan\u2019, choreographed by Jack Carter and premiered by the Ballet der Lage Landen in Amsterdam in May 1956. It received over 1,000 performance in 30 different countries, and also became popular as a concert suite. Four of his ballet scores were choreographed by Norman Morrice: The Travellers (1963), The Realms of Choice (1965), Hazard (1967) and The Empty Suit (1970). Salzedo was musical director of the Ballet Rambert from 1967 to 1972 and principal conductor with the Scottish Ballet from 1972-74. He became musical director of the City Ballet of London in 1982 and devoted himself full-time to composition from 1986.\nHe wrote many film scores, including several for Hammer Films, amongst them the war movie The Steel Bayonet (1957) and the horror film The Revenge of Frankenstein (1958). But chamber music was also central to his output, including 10 string quartets spanning his whole career - from No 1 in 1942 to No 10 (op 140) dating from 1997. Percussion forms another strand of his work, including a Percussion Concerto (1968) and several works for percussion ensemble. After 1986 he had more time to work on larger scale pieces such as the Requiem Sine Voxibus (\"Requiem Without Voices\") for large orchestra (1989), the Stabat Mater (1991), the Violin Concerto (1992) and the Piano Concerto (1994), which was written for Leslie Howard.The fanfare which forms the first six bars of Salzedo's Divertimento for three trumpets and three trombones, opus 49 (1959), was used as the theme tune for the Open University's educational programmes on BBC television and radio from the 1970s to the 1990s. Another of his tunes, Guadalajara, was used by the BBC to accompany their \"pie chart\" schools' presentation during the 1960s and early 1970s, up until 1973.Per Sir Thomas Beecham's widow, Shirley (see her letter published in Gramophone, June, 1999), Sir Eugene Goossens did not write the orchestration for Sir Thomas's notorious and still-controversial 1959 recording of Handel's \"Messiah.\"  Salzedo - who gets no credit on the current CD's packaging - wrote the orchestration.  (Beecham became impatient with Goossens's slow writing pace and was, moreover, not happy with the quality of his work.)\nSalzedo died in Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire, aged 78.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Messiah (Handel)", "response": ["In 1954 the first recording based on Handel's original scoring was conducted by Hermann Scherchen for Nixa, quickly followed by a version, judged scholarly at the time, under Sir Adrian Boult for Decca. By the standards of 21st-century performance, however, Scherchen's and Boult's tempi were still slow, and there was no attempt at vocal ornamentation by the soloists.Porter, Andrew, in Sackville West, pp. 337\u201345 In 1966 and 1967 two new recordings were regarded as great advances in scholarship and performance practice, conducted respectively by Colin Davis for Philips and Charles Mackerras for HMV. They inaugurated a new tradition of brisk, small scale performances, with vocal embellishments by the solo singers.    Among recordings of older-style performances are Beecham's 1959 recording with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, with orchestration commissioned from Sir Eugene Goossens and completed by the English composer Leonard Salzedo, Karl Richter's 1973 version for DG,  and David Willcocks's 1995 performance based on Prout's 1902 edition of the score, with a 325-voice choir and 90-piece orchestra."]}, {"page": "List of film score composers", "response": ["* Leonard Salzedo"]}, {"page": "Savage Club", "response": ["*Leonard Salzedo"]}, {"page": "2000 in British music", "response": ["*6 May \u2013 Leonard Salzedo, conductor and composer, 78"]}, {"page": "Salcedo", "response": ["*Leonard Salzedo (1921\u20132000), English composer and conductor"]}, {"page": "Piccolo oboe", "response": ["Other contemporary works for the instrument are Scherzo Furioso by William Blezard, Tasmanian Ants by Ian Keith Harris, Iberian Improvisations and Bailables by Leonard Salzedo, Variations on a Sicilian Shepherd Tune by Clive Strutt."]}, {"page": "The Revenge of Frankenstein", "response": ["Conductor and composer Leonard Salzedo was hired to write the score, and most of the regular Hammer crew returned in other roles, including Jack Asher as cinematographer, Bernard Robinson on design and Phil Leakey on make-up."]}, {"page": "John Fletcher (tubist)", "response": ["Fletcher's recordings included the Vaughan Williams Tuba Concerto.Ottaway, Hugh, Review of LP recording of Vaughan Williams Pastoral Symphony and Tuba Concerto (1972).
