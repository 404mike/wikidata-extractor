He joined Oxford City in August 2010 along with fellow Reading defender Jack Mills and made seven appearances during a one-month stay. Hector then moved to Horsham in November on an initial one-month loan and scored his first career goal on debut against Billericay Town. In December his loan was extended for a second month after which he returned to Reading having made 12 appearances, scoring once. His spell at Horsham was marred by three red cards, including two dismissals in successive games prompting manager John Maggs to accuse referees of \"destroying\" the young defender."]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Reading F.C. season", "response": ["| Jack Mills", "| Jack Mills"]}]}}
