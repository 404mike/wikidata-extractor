He played as a left back.\nBell was born in Johnstone, Renfrewshire. He played for Queen's Park in the Scottish Football League and for Leeds United, Leicester City and Brighton & Hove Albion in the English Football League. He played more than 200 league games for Leeds United in the 1960s. Leeds had many hard men but Bell was only cautioned once with a booking in over 200 games for Leeds. Norman Hunter said of him \"Willie Bell was one of the bravest men I have seen in my life. He never blinked, he never flinched, he just went for it.\" The Definitive History of Leeds United published a small biography of Bell titled Willie Bell \u2013 Hewn of Scottish granite saying he was \"a consistent force at left back for Leeds between 1962 and 1967\" as well as being \"one of a clutch of old hands amongst a squad of novices as United sprinted to the top of the English game\".Bell played in the 1965 FA Cup Final and multiple European club competitions.\nAt international level, Bell represented Scotland multiple times at various levels including being called up twice for full-international duty. His International career included a 1\u20131 draw with Brazil in 1966 at Hampden Park. Bell had one of the stronger outings that day, effectively shutting Jairzinho out of the match.\nAfter retiring from playing, Bell managed Birmingham City and Lincoln City, and then moved to the United States, where he coached the Liberty University Flames in Lynchburg, Virginia. Bell spent 21 seasons coaching at Liberty, compiling a 198-149-40 record overseeing the Flames transition from the NAIA to NCAA Division II and eventually NCAA Division I status in 1987. Bell received a Doctorate Degree from Liberty University upon his retirement and was later inducted into the Liberty University Flames Hall of Fame.\nBell is a devout Christian and an ordained minister, who together with wife Mary founded a ministry which visits prisons in England and the United States. He wrote an autobiography of his life in 2014 called \"The Light at the End of the Tunnel\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alf Ramsey", "response": ["He had joined the board of First Division club Birmingham City in January 1976. When Willie Bell was sacked as manager in September 1977, Ramsey refused the offer to take his place on a permanent basis, but did agree to act as caretaker until a successor could be found. By early November, he had changed his mind. He resigned his directorship to take on the role of consultant, with a remit that covered not only day-to-day team management but also a wide-ranging responsibility for club affairs, to include the selection of Birmingham's next manager. His tenure lasted just four months. In February 1978, star player Trevor Francis was fined for giving newspaper interviews about his desire to leave a club he saw as lacking ambition, and the board accepted Ramsey's recommendation to place him on the transfer list. Three days later, when the decision was reversed for fear of a backlash from supporters, Ramsey gave two weeks' notice to quit. The club announced his resignation before the notice period ended, and reports attributed his departure to the recent 4\u20130 defeat by Coventry City. Ramsey was quick to deny any such link, insisting that he had \"never walked out on anyone\". Francis was sold less than a year later to Nottingham Forest, in what became English football's first \u00a31 million transfer."]}, {"page": "Lincoln City F.C.", "response": ["|align=left|Willie Bell"]}, {"page": "1977\u201378 in English football", "response": ["8 September 1977: Sir Alf Ramsey makes a shock return to management, taking over at the First Division's basement side Birmingham City following the resignation of Willie Bell.
