Players who have played first-class cricket for Cambridge University can be found in List of Cambridge University Cricket Club players.\nThe Cambridge UCCE was formed in 2001 by Cambridge University Cricket Club and Anglia Polytechnic University, now Anglia Ruskin University (ARU), with funding and support from Cambridge University and the England & Wales Cricket Board (ECB).  It continued until the 2009 season, when the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) took over funding from ECB, at which point is was renamed the MCCU.  It then also received  some support from ARU.\nThese teams include students from Anglia Ruskin University, as well as Cambridge University, and play in three-day first-class matches as well as in the UCCE/MCCU Championship, the British Universities & Colleges Sport National League one day competition and, in recent years, an inter-MCCU T20 competition.\nNo matches were played in the 2020 season due to the restrictions put in place during the Coronavirus outbreak.  In 2021, coinciding with the end of funding from MCC and any support from ARU, the team reverted to the UCCE title, as did the other MCCUs.  However, unlike the other UCCEs, Cambridge played as a single institution, selecting players only from Cambridge University.  With Coronavirus restrictions still in place, they competed against Durham UCCE, Loughborough UCCE and Leeds Bradford UCCE in the National league (North).\nThe details are the player's usual name followed by the years in which he was active as a player and then his name is given as it would appear on match scorecards. Current players are shown as active to the end of the current or most recent season.", "link_mentions": []}}
