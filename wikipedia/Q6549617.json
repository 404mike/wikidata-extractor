The song was part of the soundtrack of Brazilian successful telenovela La\u00e7os de Fam\u00edlia. American recording artist Britney Spears and actresses Zoe Saldana and Taryn Manning sang along to the track during Spears' first movie Crossroads (2002). In that same year, it was performed by Molly Shannon in the form of a Christmas spoof in The Santa Clause 2. It was used to comic effect in a 2004 Chevrolet Colorado TV commercial, in which a group of men are traveling in one of the vehicles, and one of them begins singing along very enthusiastically with Twain's recording (from the female narrative), much to the discomfort of his friends. It also appeared to comedic effect in an episode of Limmy's Show, in which Limmy aka Brian Limond plays a woman dressed in leopard print halter top and leather skirt, attempting to corral the viewer into declaring \"Let's Go Girls!\" following the song's opening riff. On the third attempt, the camera appears to accelerate towards this character, striking her and propelling her across the Glasgow skyline. The woman finally falls to the ground after colliding with a tall building, revealing in the process that she is wearing a \"strap on\" dildo beneath her skirt. The scene ends with the woman lying in great pain and embarrassment."]}, {"page": "Victoria Park, Glasgow", "response": ["The park is also featured in Limmy's Show, in a sketch in which Limmy bemoans the poor state of the railings around the park."]}, {"page": "David Robertson (broadcaster)", "response": ["In January 2008, David Robertson's apparently regular on-air pen trick during Reporting Scotland was spotted and highlighted in the media  and on YouTube by Scottish comedian Limmy."]}, {"page": "Colin McAllister and Justin Ryan", "response": ["McAllister and Ryan presented STV's 2008/2009 Hogmanay Stories, a mix of traditional Hogmanay celebrations, with music from Michelle McManus, John Carmichael and some surprise guests.
