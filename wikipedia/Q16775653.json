John Nash designed the \"radically Grecian [Classical]\" tower at the west end in 1815\u201316, and only this part survived the wholesale reconstruction carried out in 1867 to the design of Arthur Cates.  The chancel and apse were further rebuilt in 1900 by H. Lloyd.  The church has the mausoleum of the Ward family of neighbouring Northwood House (George Ward was a friend of John Nash and a benefactor of the church).  The multicoloured brick interior contrasts with the rough stonework of the exterior."]}]}}
