He joined the band after leaving another punk group called Puncture. When X-Ray Spex disbanded in 1979, he and the group's bassist Paul Dean formed Airport and Dean.\nIn 1979, he and fellow X-Ray Spex member, drummer BP Hurding formed, alongside singer Sal Solo, the new wave band Classix Nouveaux, but he had left the band by the end of the year. He retired from the music industry then worked at VVL London and also in the BBC's corporate and public relations department.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "X-Ray Spex", "response": ["Initially, the band featured singer Poly Styrene (born Marion Joan Elliott-Said) (alternatively spelled Marian or Marianne) on vocals, Jak Airport (Jack Stafford) on guitars, Paul Dean on bass, Paul 'B. P.' Hurding on drums, and Lora Logic (born Susan Whitby) on saxophone. This last instrument was an atypical addition to the standard punk instrumental line-up, and became one of the group's most distinctive features.  Logic played on only one of the band's records.  As she was only fifteen, playing saxophone was a hobby and she left the band to complete her education.", "Jak Airport later worked for the BBC's corporate and public relations department under his real name, Jack Stafford; he died on 13 August 2004 of cancer."]}, {"page": "Catford", "response": ["*Jak Airport, guitarist of punk band X-Ray Spex and new wave band Classix Nouveaux, was born and raised there."]}, {"page": "Jak", "response": ["* Jak Airport (c. 1955\u20132004), English guitarist born Jack Stafford"]}, {"page": "Germfree Adolescents", "response": ["* Jak Airport \u2013 guitar"]}, {"page": "Classix Nouveaux", "response": ["The break-up of X-Ray Spex triggered an advertisement placed in Melody Maker, searching for a new lead singer.Sal Solo history \u2013 Classix Nouveaux  SalSolo.com.
