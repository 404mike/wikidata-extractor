He played in two further matches in the following week, a 3\u20131 defeat to Luxembourg, during which he scored again, and a 2\u20130 defeat to West Germany. Over the following two seasons, Brown was an integral part of the amateur side, rarely missing a match and scoring consistently for the side, including braces in matches against Scotland and France in 1961. He went on to appear in 14 matches for the side, scoring 12 times. Following his decision to turn professional with Watford at the start of the 1961\u201362 season, he became ineligible to represent the amateur side.", "Having represented England at amateur level, his performances for Barnet attracted the attention of the manager of the Great Britain Olympic football team, Norman Creek, who had been alerted to Brown following his brace in the 1959 FA Amateur Cup final. While still an amateur, Brown was chosen in the Great Britain squad for the 1960 Summer Olympics, along with his Barnet teammate Roy Sleap. Brown scored in all three of teams group matches, including a brace in their opening game during a 3\u20132 defeat to Brazil, as Britain finished the group stage in third-place resulting in their elimination. After seeing Brown score against his Italy side during the tournament, Giuseppe Viani offered Brown a contract at his club side A.C. Milan, however Brown kept the offer on hold as he was due to tour Australasia with an FA XI, which included England internationals such as Tom Finney and Bobby Moore. During the tour, he played in a number of the games against the New Zealand teams, and scored hat-tricks against both Otago and the Minor Provinces. When he returned to England, Brown discovered that Viani had suffered a heart attack and had subsequently stepped down as Milan manager."]}]}}
