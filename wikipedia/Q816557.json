Being second favourites for the title, Wednesday were expected to come out with a comfortable win in their first game against Rochdale. In front of the home crowd at Hillsborough Stadium the game finished in a 2\u20130 win, after goals from captain Rob Jones from a corner-kick, and then a superb volley from outside the area by David Prutton, after the ball was cleared away from a corner. The goal is now up for contention for Sheffield Wednesday's goal of the season. Three days later, The Owls confirmed the signing of striker Chris O'Grady from Rochdale. It was rumoured before the previous game that O'Grady was soon to sign for Wednesday, and actually played his last game for Rochdale against Sheffield Wednesday when he came off the bench in the later stages of that game. Chris O'Grady signed on a three-year contract for an undisclosed fee. With Wednesday only having two first team forward's for their first game of the season, they desperately needed some attacking players. O'Grady made it three strikers at the club, and still needing more depth in that department, The Owls confirmed that Nigerian Danny Uchechi had signed on a six-month loan deal from fellow country team FC Dender. 21-year-old Uchechi had never made a first team professional appearance throughout his career, although having experience at several other English clubs, including Charlton Athletic, West Ham United and Leicester City. However, the next day Uchechi did make his first career appearance when The Owls were hosts to Blackpool in the Football League Cup. The game, which was live on ESPN, was made clear by manager Gary Megson of its unimportance to the club and its seasons expectations, with it possibly being a distraction in gaining promotion in the league. Megson therefore made several changes to the team's starting line-up including giving debuts to youngsters Cecil Nyoni, and Matthew Tumilty \u2013 who came off the bench. Blackpool being a league above The Owls were inevitably favourites, even though making several changes themselves. The match went without any goals throughout the full 90 minutes and extra time, even though Blackpool were reduced to ten men after Ashley Eastham was sent-off in the seventy-eighth minute. Wednesday went on to win 4\u20132 on penalties, after Blackpool missed their first two. Another signing for The Owls was made the same evening of the Blackpool game, this time in midfield with Chris Lines from Bristol Rovers on an undisclosed fee, and a contract lasting three-years. The end of a busy week for Wednesday was ended with their first away trip of the campaign, against AFC Bournemouth. Sheffield Wednesday continued their same away form as the end of the previous season \u2013 losing 2\u20130. Goals in each half from Adam Barrett and Harry Arter finished off The Owls. Wednesday were away again three days later in their first mid-week game of the season. An early goal from Ryan Lowe and a goal five minutes before half-time by Damien Mozika meant Bury led 2\u20130 at half-time. Although, Chris Sedgwick pulled a goal back for The Owls at the beginning of the second half, Wednesday could not grab another for a draw, the game ended 2\u20131 and meant a second consecutive loss for Sheffield Wednesday. Before the weekends game back at Hillsborough Stadium against Notts County, Wednesday confirmed the loan signing of winger Ben Marshall from Premier League club Stoke City. Marshall made his debut for Sheffield Wednesday in the 2\u20131 win against Notts County on the following Saturday. Jeff Hughes gave Notts County an early lead from the penalty spot on the tenth minute. It was not until the second half when Wednesday equalised through Julian Bennett, scoring his first goal for the club having joined in mid-July. Then Gary Madine got the winner fourteen-minutes later, giving The Owls two wins on the bounce at home. A second consecutive mid-week game saw Wednesday visit Premier League club Blackburn Rovers in the Football League Cup. Megson made several changes for the Football League Cup tie once again, and within the first seven-minutes The Owls were already 3\u20130 down. Although, Clinton Morrison did pull a goal back in the second half, the game finished 3\u20131, sending Wednesday out of the competition in the second round. The last league game in August saw Wednesday visit captain Rob Jones's former club, Scunthorpe United. With Scunthorpe United recently being relegated from the above division, it was expected to be the toughest opposition in the league yet. The game showed to be a close encounter, in front of a crowd of 16,862 at Hillsborough Stadium, the game finished 3\u20132 to The Owls. A double-brace from Gary Madine and a first goal in two appearances for Ben Marshall were the goal scorers for Wednesday, and Robert Grant and Mark Duffy both scoring for Scunthorpe United. On 30 August The Owls confirmed another loan signing, this time with defender David Kasnik being brought into the team from Slovenian side Olimpija Ljubljana for six months. The same day Sheffield Wednesday were to play live on Sky Sports in the Football League Trophy against Bradford City. Gary Megson's intentions for this competition were clear again, as just another unimportant fixture, of which was a distraction to the club. He gave a debut to youngster Ayo Obileye who became one of the youngest ever players to play for the club, at the age of 16 years and 363 days. The competition however states that a club has to start at least 'six first team players', so The Owls were unable to make as many changes as they would have liked, but instead three of their 'first team players' were subbed within the first seventeen minutes of the game. One player who did come on was Cecil Nyoni, who was given is second ever career appearance. The game finished goalless and went to penalties, with Bradford City going through 3\u20131 on penalties. Throughout that game there were many reports that Bury striker Ryan Lowe was in the later stages of signing for the club. It was confirmed after the game that he indeed had signed on a two-year contract for an undisclosed fee, rumoured to be around \u00a31million. The next day saw the last day of the transfer window, The Owls let go Giles Coke on loan to Bury for six months, and Mark Beevers on loan to Milton Keynes Dons.", "The beginning of October saw Wednesday travel to Hartlepool United. With an impressive record over Hartlepool United in previous encounters, The Owls built on this fact and scored on the thirty-third minute through Reda Johnson, whose goal turned out to be the winning goal with the game finishing 0\u20131. The next two games were the biggest of the season so far, with Wednesday facing rivals Chesterfield at home, and then there was the Steel City derby against Sheffield United at Bramall Lane. Going into the Chesterfield game Wednesday were without Liam Palmer who had been called up to the Scotland U-21 side, and defender Reda Johnson being called up to the Benin national football team. With Johnson scoring the winning goal in the previous game and being named in the team of the week, Wednesday would have to deal without him. Wednesday did go onto win the game comfortably in a 3\u20131 win, with goals from Lewis Buxton, Gary Madine, and loanee Ben Marshall, with former Sheffield Wednesday player Leon Clarke getting a consolation goal just before Wednesday's third. The win took The Owls into the automatic-promotion position of second. In the build-up to the biggest game of the season so far, the Steel City derby against Sheffield United, Wednesday had some good news with top scorer Gary Madine winning The Football League Young Player of the Month award for September. The highly anticipated first Steel City derby of the season was at Bramall Lane in front of over 28,000 fans, and an over a further 11,000 watched the game at Hillsborough Stadium on three large television screens. Wednesday started the game well, and was neutrally supported to have been unlucky to find themselves behind, but at half-time The Owls had not taken their chances and The Blades had taken their two, with Stephen Quinn and Ched Evans finding the net to make it 2\u20130. The second half was more of an even contest, but The Owls still seemed to be making more chances. Finally, their well and truly deserved goals came twice in four minutes with ten minutes of the game left to play, Chris O'Grady and Gary Madine both scored with headers. Captain Rob Jones nearly grabbed an amazing win in the final minutes but his header was straight at goalkeeper Steve Simonsen. The game finished 2\u20132, and although Megson felt 'over the course of the game' Wednesday deserved to win, although it was the Wednesday fans who went home the happier. The week after Wednesday's amazing comeback saw David McGoldrick go back to Nottingham Forest after spending one-month on loan, scoring one goal and making four appearances. Also, youngster Nathan Modest left the club by mutual consent on 18 October, after making four appearances in 2008 for the club, and unable to break into the side since, he later signed for local club Sheffield F.C. The Owls built on the Steel City derby result as they won Colchester United 2\u20130 the next weekend. Goals from captain Rob Jones and Reda Johnson in the second half won the game at Hillsborough. Tuesday 25 October saw Wednesday travel to Carlisle United. Unfortunately for The Owls they ended up dropping points and went two points behind second-place Huddersfield Town after losing 3\u20132. Impressive loanee Ben Marshall scored against his former club to open the game, before Carlisle United scored three in the second-half, with goals from Lee Miller, Rory Loy, and Liam Noble. To make matters worse, top scorer Gary Madine gained his second bookable offence and got sent-off, but still pushing to somehow get back in the game Rob Jones scored his second in two games, but it was not enough for Sheffield Wednesday. Wednesday were away again in the league at the weekend, this time against Wycombe Wanderers. Vice-captain Jose Semedo scored his first goal for the club to put The Owls in the lead. However, the lead just lasted six-minutes when a wonderful solo dribble and shot saw Jordon Ibe score. Jordon Ibe became the youngest ever player to score for Wycombe Wanderers at just an amazing 15 years and 244 days old on his first-start for the club. Another, first goal for a club came when Ryan Lowe scored to put Wednesday back in the lead, after recently coming back from injury. The goal was enough to seal a 2\u20131 victory for The Owls. The last piece of news in October was that Wednesday were drawn away in Round 1 to Morecambe in the 2011-12 FA Cup, with the game due to be played on the weekend of 12 November.", "The first of many league games in December came at Hillsborough Stadium in the FA Cup against Aldershot Town. The Owls obviously went into the game favourites, due to Aldershot Town being a league below them. The game was a close encounter though and it was Ryan Lowe's goal that separated the sides meaning The Owls went through to the next round 1\u20130. Round 3 saw Sheffield Wednesday drawn against top Football League Championship side West Ham United at home. Sheffield Wednesday played Oldham Athletic away on 10 December. After, a very tense and tough first hour, Wednesday continued to battle away and got their award as David Prutton scored one of the club's goals of the season, then a penalty from Ryan Lowe put the game to bed with six-minutes to go, adding another win for The Owls. During the game, the Sheffield Wednesday supporters showed their appreciation to chairman Milan Mandaric, who took over the club one year previously. Mandaric had taken Wednesday out of much debt and chances of administration and up towards the top of the league by making managerial changes. Their fans showed their appreciation at the Oldham Athletic game through a large banner/sign across the away stand which said 'THIS CITY IS OURS \u2013 XBA\u041bA MILAN', with the end words translating to 'thank you Milan'. Mandaric's reacted 'emotionally' to this in which he explained in a statement towards his appreciation of the fans. The banner was put up at the next home game, which was the biggest home game of the season against West Yorkshire rivals Huddersfield Town. The games importance was not only the rivalry, but mainly due to league positions, and could prove to be an important factor in the outcome in the race to automatic promotion. Wednesday were one point ahead of Huddersfield Town in second, however Huddersfield Town had one game in hand, so the three points for either team was of much importance and could be pivotal at the end of the season. The game turned out to be one of the most, if not the most, dramatic and exciting games of the season. In front of the highest attendance of the season so far, and an away crowd filling the away stand The Owls started poorly and Scotland international Jordan Rhodes, the league's top scorer, opened the game to put Huddersfield Town 0\u20131 up. Just three minutes later and Huddersfield Town's second attack of the game saw Jordan Rhodes score his second of the afternoon and Wednesday were already feeling beaten. On the twenty-seventh minute however Rob Jones pulled one back for The Owls and then another three minutes later Reda Johnson astonishingly put Sheffield Wednesday back on level terms for half-time. Sheffield Wednesday came out into the second-half much like the end of the first-half \u2013 the better team. Finally, their award came and Wednesday had managed to come back from two goals behind and turn it into a 3\u20132 lead, when Ben Marshall took on two players and finished coolly into the bottom corner. So far quite an unbelievable game and to add to the games excitement so far Chris O'Grady scored his second goal for the club to put Wednesday into what was surely a comfortable 4\u20132 lead. With twelve minutes of the game to go however Wednesday Jordan Rhodes, son of Sheffield Wednesday's goalkeeping coach Andy Rhodes, scored his hat-trick to set up a very nervy last moments of the game. The Owls began to sit-back in order to defend their lead in such an important game and was shocked to hear seven minutes added time had been awarded at the end of the game, due to many yellow cards. Huddersfield Town were pushing closer and closer, and every time goalkeeper Stephen Bywater cleared the ball it went back into the possession of Huddersfield Town. And then in the dying moments a long-ball up field by the opposition keeper and a flick on found Jordan Rhodes threw on goal, with Reda Johnson, Lewis Buxton, and Jose Semedo all unable to catch him or make a tackle, Jordan Rhodes showed his complacency and scored in the ninety-seventh minute of the game. All Huddersfield Town's players went over to celebrate, while Wednesday were left devastated, even though it ended in a 4\u20134 draw. A total of nine yellow cards were handed out in the game with Wednesday getting five of them. After such an unbelievable game The Owls travelled to Walsall for their Boxing Day match. During the week between the games Wednesday were given a Christmas treat when they heard consistent centre back Danny Batth had extended his loan deal from Wolverhampton Wanderers until the end of the season. Wednesday took the lead at Bescot Stadium at the weekend on the hour mark thanks to Ryan Lowe. With nerves and thoughts being remembered by the club of the previous weeks last-minute goal, the defence looked 'shaky' and quite astonishingly conceded another goal in stoppage time for the second consecutive week when Claude Gnakpa scored in the ninety-first minute. After that blow Wednesday fell asleep and gave a free-kick away and the ball was floated into the box when Reda Johnson missed timed his jump for the ball by a long way and Emmanuele Smith scored at the far post in the ninety-third minute. Sheffield Wednesday had given away three vital points in the matter of minutes, at the dying moments of the game. After throwing away five points in stoppage time over the last two weeks, Wednesday somehow had still managed to hold onto that second spot. However, this can be seen as even more frustrating as The Owls could have been six points clear in the automatic promotion spot. The team's character and strength was shown though in the next game, when they was away at Preston North End and won 0\u20132. Goals from loanees Danny Batth and Ben Marshall in the first-half secured the points for The Owls on New Year's Eve. That same day the last piece of news about Sheffield Wednesday in 2011 was that Stephen Bywater had signed on a permanent deal from Derby County on a free transfer. Bywater had impressed manager Gary Megson, after spending the previous three months at the club due to usual first choice goalkeeper Nicky Weaver had been out with an injury.", "The start of 2012 was highly anticipated by Sheffield Wednesday with knowledge of the possibility of being promoted to the Football League Championship at the end of season in May. The key aim was to gain automatic promotion and that was a task that had so far in the first half of the season been greatly helped by on loan winger Ben Marshall, who had probably been the best player for The Owls so far. However, the thing on all the fans' minds was Marshall's future at the club, as his loan from Stoke City was due to end during the middle of the month and his contract at Stoke City due to end in the summer. Only being 20 years of age, it was made clear by Gary Megson, known to be great friends with Stoke City manager Tony Pulis, the outcome would either be that 'Marshall will either sign a new contract at Stoke City and hopefully come back on loan to us (Sheffield Wednesday) or another club will snap him up and buy him'. Wednesday had a match to concentrate on however and their first game of 2012 came at home to Tranmere Rovers. The home game was first of four in a row for Wednesday. Sheffield Wednesday got off to a great start when Reda Johnson scored on just the second minute, then five minutes later Chris Lines scored his first home goal of the club to put The Owls 2\u20130 up. The game relaxed after this until the eighty-second minute when Ian Goodison scored from a corner to put a nervous last ten minutes of the game, with Sheffield Wednesday losing points in the final minutes of games just weeks earlier. However, Sheffield Wednesday managed to hold on and the game finished 2\u20131. On the Thursday after this game left back Mark Reynolds who had played only a few games since he joined the club at the beginning of the season was sent out on loan till the end of the season to Aberdeen. Sheffield Wednesday faced top of the Football League Championship West Ham United in the FA Cup the following weekend. Both teams made changes and was a very tight encounter even though the odds were stacked up on West Ham United to go through to the next round. It took a late goal to separate the sides when Chris O'Grady scored with two minutes to go of the ninety and sent Sheffield Wednesday through to the next round of the competition. The next day Sheffield Wednesday found they would be playing Blackpool away in Round 4 of the competition. With the transfer market open for the January month The Owls made their first signing when Miguel Llera, who had signed on loan for the month previously, signed on a two-year contract on a free transfer from Blackpool. Also, the club saw the introduction of Mike Jones a winger signed on an undisclosed fee for two-and-a-half years from fellow League One club Bury. In terms of departures, the club saw three when young goalkeeper Sean Cuff was sent out on loan to Cambridge United for a month, out-of-contract James O'Connor left for American club Orlando City, and Giles Coke went back on loan to Bury for the rest of the season. Back to matches and Sheffield Wednesday faced their toughest opponent of the season so far when the played top of the league Charlton Athletic at home, Charlton Athletic were five points clear of second place Sheffield Wednesday and had not dropped from the top of the league since October. The first goal was largely expected to be the key goal and the team who would go on to win the game. Sheffield Wednesday, unbeaten at home throughout the season and only having two draws at Hillsborough Stadium, started slightly on the back foot in front of a crowd of over 26,000 and were the first to concede when Charlton Athletic captain Johnnie Jackson curled a free-kick around the wall and into the net. That turned out to be the only goal of the game and Sheffield Wednesday were ended of their unbeaten run since the beginning of the season at home. Although with much of the season to go, the game was likely to end any chances of Sheffield Wednesday winning the league with Charlton Athletic now eight points clear of second place and Wednesday slipping down to fourth place with city rivals Sheffield United taking up second place four points ahead of The Owls, although they had played one extra game. The final of the four straight home games was against Hartlepool United and after a goalless first half it was Peter Hartley's goal that put Hartlepool United ahead two minutes into the second half. It took a goal by Jermaine Johnson when he took on four players on the right flank before finishing into the far, low bottom corner to put Sheffield Wednesday back on level terms. That goal lifted the fans in the stadium and the players reacted and scored a second with fifteen minutes to go with Gary Madine on the score sheet this time. However, again The Owls opted to start to defend their lead and then what seemed to be a goal out of nothing from outside the box and caught the keeper off his line, as Antony Sweeney's eighty-eighth minute effort meant Sheffield Wednesday could only manage a draw. With Wednesday reaching Round 3 of the FA Cup it meant that the game they would have played in the league on that same weekend was rescheduled to mid-week. This game was rescheduled to 24 January and was away to Scunthorpe United. After two disappointing results in a row Sheffield Wednesday were looking to bounce back. Sheffield Wednesday did exactly that when Chris O'Grady scored in under a minute after a long ball from Miguel Llera found the striker. Sheffield Wednesday then doubled their lead seventeen minutes later as Chris O'Grady grabbed his second. In the second half there was another goal from Jermaine Johnson, when he took on three players after running from the half-way line and slotted the ball coolly into the net when he found himself one-on-one. Jordan Robertson did pull one back for Scunthorpe United from a corner, but the game did finish 1\u20133 to The Owls. Sheffield Wednesday's next trip was in the FA Cup against Blackpool. Gary Megson made many changes to the side as he wanted to rest his key players ready for the tough mid-week tie in the league against fifth place MK Dons. One of those changes was striker Clinton Morrison who put The Owls unexpectedly ahead on the fifty-second minute. However, Sheffield Wednesday conceded yet another late, late goal, this time it was in the last minute of stoppage time again when Sheffield Wednesday conceded a penalty and Kevin Phillips scored from the spot in the ninety-minute, meaning a replay had to be played \u2013 something that neither team wanted due to their league focuses. The draw for the FA Cup saw the winner of the replay to play Premier League side Everton in the fifth round of the competition. After this Tottenham Hotspur young midfielder John Bostock join The Owls on loan until the end of the season. Mid-week and the last day of the month saw Sheffield Wednesday away to fifth place Milton Keynes Dons. Sheffield Wednesday were six points ahead of Milton Keynes Dons in fourth place; however they had played one more game than Milton Keynes Dons. An effort from distance saw the ball hit the bar and then hit goalkeeper Stephen Bywater's leg and roll into the net, giving Milton Keynes Dons the lead after seventeen minutes. Ten minutes later however a corner for Sheffield Wednesday saw Gary MacKenzie put the ball into his own net after the ball bounced off his knee, making it two own goals in the game. The game finished 1\u20131 and as a result Sheffield Wednesday went home happy with. However, the bad news of the month was Sheffield Wednesday were unable to extend key player Ben Marshall's loan until the end of the season. Marshall had made twenty-two appearances for the club, scoring five goals, and was signed by Football League Championship club Leicester City for over a million pounds. The loss of Marshall could have affected the team coming up to the 'business' and most crucial part of the season, and with Sheffield Wednesday only winning one of their last four gains with Ben Marshall, how much of an effect would his loss have on Sheffield Wednesday's automatic promotion hopes?", "|= ||MF || ||10 ||Ben Marshall || 5|| 0 || 0 || 0 || 5", "|2 ||MF || ||10 ||Ben Marshall || 6 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 6", "|3 ||MF || ||10 ||Ben Marshall || 5 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 5", "|10 || ||MF ||Ben Marshall || 2 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 2 || 0", "| Ben Marshall", "| Ben Marshall", "| Ben Marshall", "| Ben Marshall", "| Ben Marshall", "| Ben Marshall", "| Ben Marshall", "| Ben Marshall", "| Ben Marshall"]}, {"page": "Adam Henley", "response": ["Ahead of the 2014\u201315 season, Henley was publicity called out by Manager Bowyer to fight for his first team place in the right\u2013back position. In response, Henley said he's determined to fight for his first team place for the new season. At the start of the 2014\u201315 season, he continued to rehabilitate from ankle injury and didn't return until August. It wasn't until on 12 August 2014 when he returned from injury, starting the whole game, in a 1\u20130 defeat to Scunthorpe United in the first round of the League Cup.

Barkley who had impressed while on loan at Wednesday made 13 appearances scoring 4 goals. After Barkley's departure it could mean that manager Dave Jones would look for a replacement to bring on loan, along with the rumours of the manager looking to bring in a forward on loan before the emergency loan deadline on Thursday 22 November. Thursday 22 November came and within the space of half an hour before midday, it was confirmed that the club had captured two players on loan. The first being left-back/left-winger J\u00e9r\u00e9my H\u00e9lan on loan for a month from Manchester City. The other loan capturing was Mamady Sidib\u00e9, from Stoke City, with the striker also coming on loan for a month. The end of a busy week for Wednesday ended back at Hillsborough Stadium, as the Owls entertained the in-form Leicester City. New loan signings Mamady Sidib\u00e9 and J\u00e9r\u00e9my H\u00e9lan were handed starts for their debuts, and the first twenty-minutes of the game was quite evenly contested.

Although, Sheffield Wednesday gave it a go and restricted Leicester City more, the Owls hardly created a chance. Then on the seventy-sixth minute last season's loanee Ben Marshall cut inside and curled a delightful effort with his left-foot into the far corner to confirm Leicester City's victory. Marshall did not celebrated however, in respect to his former club Sheffield Wednesday. Leicester could have increased their lead even further before the full-time whistle as they had a couple more key chances after they had hit the bar. The game finished in another loss for Wednesday, with some fans losing patience with players and the manager alike."]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Blackburn Rovers F.C. season", "response": ["|10||12||MF|| Ben Marshall||2||0||0||2", "|  Ben Marshall"]}]}}
