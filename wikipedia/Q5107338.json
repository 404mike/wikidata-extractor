Having returned to semi-professional football, he worked part-time as an electrician. Helliwell took over as caretaker manager at Ilkeston after Keith Alexander resigned in October 2000, and led the team to the first round of the FA Cup before John McGovern was appointed in November. In March 2001, Helliwell was appointed as one of a three-man management team at Ilkeston alongside former Burnley teammate Charlie Bishop and former York teammate Chris Marples. The trio guided the club to safety at the end of 2000\u201301; Marples was consequently hired as manager on a permanent basis in May 2001 and Helliwell returned to his playing role. After Marples left Ilkeston in March 2002, Bishop and Helliwell took caretaker charge before John McGinlay was appointed later that month. Helliwell retired from football following 2001\u201302, having spent four seasons with Ilkeston."]}]}}
