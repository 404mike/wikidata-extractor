Because Coghlan surpassed the mark indoors and before the IAAF validated indoor performances as being eligible for outdoor records, World Masters Athletics still had not recognised a sub-4-minute-mile performance as a record in the M40 division. Many elite athletes made the attempts to extend their careers beyond age 40 to challenge that mark. Over 18 years after Coghlan, that was finally achieved by UK's Anthony Whiteman, running 3:58.79 on 2 June 2012."]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 2000 Summer Olympics", "response": ["|align=left|Anthony Whiteman"]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 1996 Summer Olympics", "response": ["* Anthony Whiteman"]}, {"page": "List of male middle-distance runners", "response": ["* Anthony Whiteman, GBR"]}, {"page": "Johnny Gray", "response": ["Gray attempted to extend his career into masters athletics.
