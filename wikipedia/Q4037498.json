This style was championed by the labels Emotif and No U-Turn, and by artists like Trace, Ed Rush, Optical, and Dom & Roland. It is commonly referred to as techstep, which in turn gave birth to the neurofunk subgenre. Techstep focused intensely on studio production and applied new techniques of sound generation and processing to older Jungle approaches. Self-consciously underground, and lacking the accessible influences of much other drum and bass, techstep is deeply atmospheric, often characterized by sinister or science-fiction themes (including samples from cult films), cold and complex percussion, and dark, distorted basslines. The sound was a conscious move back towards the darker sounds of Belgian Techno and Darkside Hardcore (again the already mentioned darkcore), albeit with a greater electro / techno emphasis than darkcore."]}, {"page": "Burial (Burial album)", "response": ["Sputnikmusic review Nick Butler described Burial as \"claustrophobic, nervous, and at times, scary\",  but also occasionally \"gorgeous\", like on \"Forgive\" which he called  \"heartbreakingly beautiful\" yet \"painfully minimal\". Pitchfork Media critic Tim Finney noted the beats to be reminiscent of the playfulness of 2-step, except that the rhythms sound more nervous than joyful, and have a fast-running insubstantiality that brings to mind the fear and dread of dubstep. Lugubrious synths are played over these beats, which Finney said pass \"over one another like successive waves of blue and purple rainclouds.\" He also noted this raincloud effect to be similar to techstep made by artists of Parasol Records sub-label Hidden Agenda or producer Dom & Roland in the late 1990s. Crackles of pirate radio and vinyl, as well as actual recordings of rain and fire, which Burial opined \"would put most electronica producers to shame they\u2019re so fucking heavy\", are present on the album, as well as vocal samples that have been described as yearning and ghostly."]}, {"page": "DJ-Kicks: Kemistry & Storm", "response": ["# \"Trauma\" - Dom & Roland \u2013 3:19"]}, {"page": "Rollcage Stage II", "response": ["In 2015, Robert Baker approached former ATD and Rollcage teammate David Perryman to form Caged Element under the impulsion of entrepreneur Chris Mallinson.
