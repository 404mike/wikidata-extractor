In 1831, upon the death of his mother, he inherited the Barony of de Ros, the oldest surviving barony in the Peerage of England.\nHe was an excellent whist player, but was involved in a gambling scandal in 1836. Lord de Ros was accused of cheating at Graham's Club by the trick of sauter la coupe, and by marking the cards with his thumbnail. He sued his accusers for libel, but lost the case. He died not long after, and was commemorated by Theodore Hook with the punning epitaph, \"Here lies the premier baron of England, patiently awaiting the last trump.\" He died in London, unmarried and without issue.\nIt has been suggested that Charles Dickens may have based the character of Sir Mulberry Hawk in his novel Nicholas Nickleby to some extent on Lord de Ros, a man-about-town with a reputation for fleecing gullible young men, seducing women and various forms of swindling.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Duke of Leinster", "response": ["***15px Henry FitzGerald-de Ros, 21st Baron de Ros (1793\u20131839)"]}, {"page": "Baron de Ros", "response": ["*Henry FitzGerald-de Ros, 21st Baron de Ros (1793\u20131839)"]}, {"page": "William FitzGerald-de Ros, 22nd Baron de Ros", "response": ["Fitzgerald-de Ros was born into an Anglo-Irish aristocratic family at Thames Ditton, Surrey, the third son of Lord Henry FitzGerald, fourth son of The 1st Duke of Leinster and Lady Emily Lennox.
