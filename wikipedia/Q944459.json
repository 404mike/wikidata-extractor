The director was initially wary of being typecast as a horror film director, although he eventually agreed to make The Descent, emphasizing, \"They are very different films.\" Marshall decided to cast only women in the main roles, going against the original plan for a mixed cast, due to his belief that women were underrepresented in the horror genre.", "Filmmakers originally planned for the cast to be both male and female, but Neil Marshall's business partner realized that horror films rarely have all-female casts. Defying convention, Marshall cast all women, and to avoid making them clich\u00e9d, he solicited basic advice from his female friends. He explained the difference, \"The women discuss how they feel about the situation, which the soldiers in Dog Soldiers would never have done.\" He also gave the characters different accents to enable the audience to tell them apart and to establish a more \"cosmopolitan feel\" than the British marketing of Dog Soldiers.", "Director Neil Marshall first chose to have a dark cave as the setting for his horror film The Descent then decided to add the element of the crawlers, describing them as \"something that could get the women, something human, but not quite\". The crawlers were depicted as cavemen who never left the caves and evolved in the dark. The director included mothers and children in the colony of creatures, defining his vision, \"It is a colony and I thought that was far more believable than making them the classic monsters. If they had been all male, it would have made no sense, so I wanted to create a more realistic context for them. I wanted to have this very feral, very primal species living underground, but I wanted to make them human. I didn't want to make them aliens because humans are the scariest things.\"", "The crawlers reappear in The Descent Part 2, a sequel by Jon Harris with the first film's director Neil Marshall as executive producer. For the sequel, Hyett improved the camouflaging ability of the crawlers' skin tones to deliver better scares.

The film's theatrical distributor in the UK, Path\u00e9, recalled the posters from their placement in the London Underground and reworked the campaign to exclude the word \"terror\" from advertised reviews of The Descent. Path\u00e9 also distributed the new versions to TV and radio stations. The distributor's marketing chief, Anna Butler, said of the new approach, \"We changed tack to concentrate on the women involved all standing together and fighting back. That seemed to chime with the prevailing mood of defiance that set in the weekend after the bombs.\" Neil Marshall stated in a review \"Shauna was pretty upset about it; it was on newspapers all across the county\" and cites the attacks as harming the film's box office, as \"people were still trapped underground in reality, so no one really wanted to go see a film about people trapped underground...\".

Philosophical questions concerning the morality of modern prisons were derived from Michel Foucault's Discipline and Punish. For an insight into contemporary prison culture, and the United States penal system as a whole, the developers looked at Jack Abbott's In the Belly of the Beast and Ted Conover's Newjack: Guarding Sing Sing, while for inspiration regarding setting the game in an impoverished non-specific area of East Baltimore, they read David Simon's The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood. Filmic influences included Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, which was also a major influence on the first game. The developers also cited Roman Polanski's Repulsion and Rosemary's Baby, Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho and The Birds, and David Lynch's Blue Velvet and Mulholland Drive. More specific horror films included Japanese horrors such as Hideo Nakata's Ring and Dark Water, and Takashi Shimizu's The Grudge, as well as English language films such as Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar's The Others and Neil Marshall's The Descent, to which Rouse referred for its strong sense of claustrophobia and entrapment.

When the virus is found in London, political leaders send a team led by Major Eden Sinclair (Rhona Mitra) to Scotland to find a possible cure. Sinclair's team runs into two types of survivors: marauders and medieval knights. Doomsday was conceived by Marshall based on the idea of futuristic soldiers facing medieval knights. In producing the film, he drew inspiration from various movies, including Mad Max, Escape from New York and 28 Days Later.", "Director Neil Marshall lived near the ruins of Hadrian's Wall, a Roman fortification built to defend England against Scotland's tribes. The director fantasised about what conditions would cause the Wall to be rebuilt and imagined a lethal virus would work. Marshall had also visualised a mixture of medieval and futuristic elements: \"I had this vision of these futuristic soldiers with high-tech weaponry and body armour and helmets\u2014clearly from the future\u2014facing a medieval knight on horseback.\" The director favoured the English/Scottish border as the location for a rebuilt wall, finding the location more plausible than a lengthy boundary between the United States and Canada. Additionally, Scotland is the home to multiple castles, which fit Marshall's medieval aspect.", "Neil Marshall's car chase sequence also involved the use of visual effects. A scene in which the Bentley crashes through a bus was intended to implement pyrotechnics, but fire marshals in the South African nature reserve, the filming location for the scene, forbade their use due to dry conditions. A miniature mock-up was created and visual effects were applied so the filming of the mock-up would overlay the filming of the actual scene without pyrotechnics. Other visual effects that were created were the Thames flood plain and a remote Scottish castle. A popular effect with the visual effects crew was the \"rabbit explosion\" scene, depicting a rabbit being shot by guns on automatic sensors. The crew sought to expand the singular shot, but Neil Marshall sought to focus on one shot to emphasise its comic nature and avoid drawing unnecessary sympathy from audiences.", "Reviewer James Berardinelli found the production of Doomsday to be a mess, complaining, \"The action sequences might be more tense if they weren't obfuscated by rapid-fire editing, and the backstory is muddled and not all that interesting.\" Berardinelli also believed the attempted development of parallel storylines to be too much for the film, weakening the eventual payoff. Dennis Harvey of Variety said Neil Marshall's \"flair for visceral action\" made up for Doomsday's lack of originality and that the film barely had a dull moment. He added, \"There's no question that Doomsday does what it does with vigor, high technical prowess and just enough humor to avoid turning ridiculous.\" Harvey considered the conclusion relatively weak, and found the quality of the acting satisfactory for the genre, while reserving praise for the \"stellar\" work of the stunt personnel. Peter Hartlaub of the San Francisco Chronicle also praised the film's stunts, noting that it was reminiscent of \"the beauty of the exploitation film era\".
