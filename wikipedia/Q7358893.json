Music journalist Matty Karas regarded it as \"a quintessential pop album that was also a perfect distillation of the anger and bitterness seething beneath the surface of Reagan-era America.\" Although Springsteen's previous record Nebraska had darker songs, he said Born in the U.S.A. was not entirely different: \"If you look at the material, particularly on the first side, it's actually written very much like Nebraska \u2013 the characters and the stories, the style of writing \u2013 except it's just in the rock-band setting.\" Springsteen considered leaving \"No Surrender\" off the album, explaining that \"you don't hold out and triumph all the time in life. ... You compromise, you suffer defeat; you slip into life's gray areas.\" Co-producer Steven Van Zandt convinced Springsteen otherwise: \"He argued that the portrait of friendship and the song's expression of the inspirational power of rock music was an important part of the picture.\""]}, {"page": "Jan Ravens", "response": ["After Cambridge, Ravens became a radio comedy producer.
