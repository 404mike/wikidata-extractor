Collier initially joined as player-manager, but was forced to retire from playing due to a broken ankle after two matches. He was in charge for York's last season in the Midland League before their election to the Football League in June 1929. Collier oversaw the club's successful transition from non-League football to the Third Division North, but left the club in May 1930 to become a publican. Billy Sherrington combined his duties as club secretary with that of manager for the next three years, before Collier was reappointed manager in May 1933. With results at a low ebb, he helped York establish themselves in the Football League, and led them to the fourth round of the 1936\u201337 FA Cup. In March 1937, Collier retired from football to go into business with his brother. Former player Tom Mitchell was appointed, and in his first full season led York to the quarter-final of the 1937\u201338 FA Cup."]}, {"page": "History of York City F.C. (1922\u20131980)", "response": ["York's first match in the Football League was against Wigan Borough at Springfield Park on 31 August 1929 and finished with a 2\u20130 victory for the visitors. Reg Stockill, the scorer of the first goal, became the youngest player to represent the club in a competitive match at the age of 15 years and 281 days. The 1929\u201330 season brought two meetings with First Division team Newcastle United in the FA Cup third round, and a sixth-place finish in York's debut Football League season. Collier resigned as manager in May 1930 and Billy Sherrington took over for the following three years, combining this with his role as club secretary. Sherrington's first season in charge saw York rank 12th in the league, and they again faced First Division opposition in the FA Cup third round, taking Sheffield United to a replay. Despite an improved league position of ninth in 1931\u201332, York were eliminated from the FA Cup in the first round. This, combined with disappointing average home crowds, resulted in a deficit of \u00a31,539 over the season. In August 1932, York moved to a new ground at Bootham Crescent, which was closer than Fulfordgate to the club's centre of support and the railway station. The ground was officially opened for a match with Stockport County on 31 August 1932; it ended a 2\u20132 draw, and the first goalscorer at the ground was Tom Mitchell. York's worst performance in the Football League to date came in 1932\u201333, finishing in 20th place. The club only avoided having to seek re-election after winning the last match of the season.", "After a dispute with the directors over team selection, McCormick resigned in September 1954, after which team affairs were handled by trainer Tom Lockie and secretary Billy Sherrington. With an emphasis on close-passing attacking football, the team embarked on a 10-match unbeaten sequence. In the 1954\u201355 FA Cup, York became the first third-tier club to participate in an FA Cup semi-final replay. York beat Scarborough, Dorchester Town, Blackpool (winners of the competition 18 months earlier), Bishop Auckland, Tottenham Hotspur and Notts County in the previous rounds before playing Newcastle United in the semi-final. After drawing 1\u20131 at Hillsborough, York were defeated 2\u20130 in the replay at Roker Park, which ended an FA Cup campaign in which Arthur Bottom scored eight goals. The team were billed \"The Happy Wanderers\" after a popular song; Henry Rose of the Daily Express said, \"There are no weak spots in this First Division side masquerading in Third Division shirts\". By the end of the cup run, York were on the fringes of the Third Division North promotion race, but injuries and a congested fixture list led to them finishing fourth in 1954\u201355. Bottom was the divisional top scorer that season, with 31 goals."]}, {"page": "Bill Sherrington", "response": ["#REDIRECT Billy Sherrington"]}, {"page": "Sherrington (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Billy Sherrington (1890\u20131977), English football manager"]}, {"page": "Sherrington, George", "response": ["#REDIRECT Billy Sherrington"]}, {"page": "George Sherrington", "response": ["#REDIRECT Billy Sherrington"]}, {"page": "George William Sherrington", "response": ["#REDIRECT Billy Sherrington"]}]}}
