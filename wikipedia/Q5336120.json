In the resulting play, McGuire got the ball to Ryan Hall who passed inside to Keith Senior who had the ball stripped on-on-one tackle by Jamie Lyon. The 2nd minute of play saw Manly make a break from the halfway line with Adam Cuthbertson getting the ball out to Michael Robertson on the left wing. Leeds winger (and former Manly player from 2003\u201305) Scott Donald attempted to tackle Robertson but he managed to get a pass away. Leeds centre Carl Ablett failed to gather the loose ball and managed to knock the ball straight into the waiting hands of Brett Stewart who had originally overrun the ball. The Manly fullback picked the ball up 12 metres out from the line and with no one to beat scored his second try of the night. Orford missed the conversion, and the score was 16\u20134 in favour of the visiting team. The Sea Eagles scored again one minute later as they were returning the ball from the kick-off. Michael Robertson made another break down the right wing and centre kicked ahead for Brett Stewart who got a perfect bounce. Stewart came close to scoring but was forced to swerve soon after gathering the ball by a converging Ryan Hall who was flying in off his wing. Hall finally brought the Manly fullback down just 10 metres from the Rhino's line. From dummy half the ball then went left to Watmough at first receiver before Leeds' defence could regather and he went over for his second try of the game. Orford kicked the extras so Manly had gotten away to a 22\u20134 lead. When returning the following kick-off as well the Sea Eagles scored again, this time Shane Rodney made a break 25 metres from his own line and got to the Leeds 40 metre line before finding L'Estrange in support who in turn popped a pass to Steve Matai who had an easy 20 metre run to the line (even had Matai been caught, he still had an un-marked Robertson in support). Manly had scored their 3rd try in only 6 minutes and 45 seconds of the second half which had taken the game away from Leeds and silenced the mostly pro-Rhinos crowd, though there were a few Manly supporters scattered throughout the stadium and a group of supporters had come from Sydney to watch the Sea Eagles with Sky Sports television commentator Eddie Hemmings telling the audience that his director was finding them in the crowd as he himself was an Australian and just happened to be a Manly-Warringah fan.
