Over time, they got stories of their own, notably Martha's attempts to affect a relationship with her old school friend Ted Ashley (Jerold Wells).", "In the summer of 1963, Martha saw a doctor and was put on pills which she took three times a day - a fact she kept private even from her family and friends. With health issues and money stashed away, Martha was of a mind to break from her mundane routine. The catalyst was the return of Ted Ashley (Jerold Wells), a former classmate at Bessie Street who had long since emigrated to Australia and made a good life for himself as a farmer and shopkeeper. Ted was back in Weatherfield to look up old friends and visit his cousin Clara - who also happened to be Martha's next-door neighbour. Setting her cap at Ted, who was now a widower, Martha asked Clara to invite him over to hers for tea. Ena's suspicions were aroused when Martha bought a tin of best salmon from the corner shop and invited both her and Minnie Caldwell (Margot Bryant) to tea, even though it wasn't a Sunday. Ted did turn up, but he barely remembered the ladies from his school days and got his memories of them hopelessly confused. Martha clung to Ted throughout his stay, and the man was too gentlemanly to put her off. When Martha told him that she had never been out of Lancashire, Ted suggested that she go to London to stay with his sister Alice as she missed the north. Martha took this as an invitation to go along with him when he left Weatherfield, and she immediately made travel arrangements - much to the surprise of Ted, who had no romantic interest in Martha. Martha went to London expecting a proposal from Ted, but none came and instead she spent her time sightseeing on her own. Back in Weatherfield, a humiliated Martha hid away from her friends, although Frank Barlow (Frank Pemberton) spotted her going into her house and told everyone that she was back. Ena and Minnie confronted her and she sheepishly admitted that Ted had shown no affection for her whatsoever."]}, {"page": "The New Avengers (TV series)", "response": ["| Peter Cushing, Derek Farr, Frank Gatliff, Trevor Baxter, Jerold Wells, Sydney Bromley, Brian Anthony, Peter Porteous"]}, {"page": "Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell", "response": ["* Jerold Wells as Landlord"]}, {"page": "Maniac (1963 film)", "response": ["* Jerold Wells as Giles"]}, {"page": "Smashing Time", "response": ["* Jerold Wells as Workman"]}, {"page": "Comedy Playhouse (series 1)", "response": ["| style=\"font-size: 100%;\" |This episode focused on a reunion of old friends, and the resulting consequences.
