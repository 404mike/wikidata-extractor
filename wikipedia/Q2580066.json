As colonel leading a state militia, in 1776 he prevented the British from taking Charleston, and Fort Moultrie was named in his honor.\nAfter independence, Moultrie advanced as a politician; he was elected by the legislature twice within a decade as Governor of South Carolina (1785\u201387, 1792\u201394), serving two terms. (The state constitution kept power in the hands of the legislature and prohibited governors from serving two terms in succession.)", "link_mentions": {}}}
