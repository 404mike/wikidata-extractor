Macclesfield Town were champions in each of the first two seasons of the competition, finishing 12 points clear in 1968\u201369, and by goal average in 1969\u201370. The 1969\u201370 season also resulted in a trip to Wembley for the inaugural final of the FA Trophy, a knockout competition for non-league clubs. Macclesfield Town defeated Telford United 2\u20130 in front of more than 28,000 spectators to win the competition. A period of decline then followed, despite the performances of Willie Mailey in goal, and the side's fortunes reached a nadir when the club finished bottom of the Northern Premier League in 1979, a year when the stronger teams from the division formed the national Alliance Premier League (now known as the National League). The 1980s saw steady rebuilding. The club finished as Northern Premier League runners-up in the 1984\u201385 season."]}, {"page": "Mailey", "response": ["*Willie Mailey (1943\u20131992), Scottish footballer"]}]}}
