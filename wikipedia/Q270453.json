Torry (born 29 November 1947) is a British singer, well known for writing and performing the wordless vocals on the song \"The Great Gig in the Sky\" by the group Pink Floyd on their 1973 album The Dark Side of the Moon. She also covered the Dolly Parton single \"Love Is Like a Butterfly\" for the opening titles of the BBC TV series Butterflies, which ran for four series between 1978 and 1983.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Alan Parsons Project", "response": ["* Clare Torry \u2013 vocals (1979)"]}, {"page": "Dolly Parton", "response": ["As a songwriter, Parton has twice been nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song, for \"9 to 5\" and \"Travelin' Thru\" (2005) from the film Transamerica. \"Travelin' Thru\" won Best Original Song at the 2005 Phoenix Film Critics Society Awards. It was also nominated for both the 2005 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song and the 2005 Broadcast Film Critics Association Award (also known as the Critics' Choice Awards) for Best Song. A cover of \"Love Is Like A Butterfly\" by Clare Torry was used as the theme music for the British TV show Butterflies."]}, {"page": "The Dark Side of the Moon", "response": ["The record builds on ideas explored in Pink Floyd's earlier recordings and performances, while omitting the extended instrumentals that characterised their earlier work. The group employed multitrack recording, tape loops, and analogue synthesisers, including experimentation with the EMS VCS 3 and a Synthi A. Engineer Alan Parsons was responsible for many sonic aspects and the recruitment of singer Clare Torry, who appears on \"The Great Gig in the Sky\".", "Dark Side of the Moon: A Piece for Assorted Lunatics, as it was then known, was performed in the presence of an assembled press on 17 February 1972 more than a year before its release at the Rainbow Theatre, and was critically acclaimed. Michael Wale of The Times described the piece as \"bringing tears to the eyes. It was so completely understanding and musically questioning.\" Derek Jewell of The Sunday Times wrote \"The ambition of the Floyd's artistic intention is now vast.\" Melody Maker was less enthusiastic: \"Musically, there were some great ideas, but the sound effects often left me wondering if I was in a bird-cage at London zoo.\" The following tour was praised by the public. The new material was performed in the same order in which it was eventually sequenced on the album release; differences included the lack of synthesisers in tracks such as \"On the Run\", and Clare Torry's vocals on \"The Great Gig in the Sky\" being replaced by readings from the Bible.", "Each side of the album is a continuous piece of music. The five tracks on each side reflect various stages of human life, beginning and ending with a heartbeat, exploring the nature of the human experience and, according to Waters, \"empathy\".  \"Speak to Me\" and \"Breathe\" together highlight the mundane and futile elements of life that accompany the ever-present threat of madness, and the importance of living one's own life \"Don't be afraid to care\". By shifting the scene to an airport, the synthesiser-driven instrumental \"On the Run\" evokes the stress and anxiety of modern travel, in particular Wright's fear of flying. \"Time\" examines the manner in which its passage can control one's life and offers a stark warning to those who remain focused on mundane pursuits; it is followed by a retreat into solitude and withdrawal in \"Breathe (Reprise)\". The first side of the album ends with Wright and vocalist Clare Torry's soulful metaphor for death, \"The Great Gig in the Sky\".", "The album's credits include Clare Torry, a session singer and songwriter, and a regular at Abbey Road. She had worked on pop material and numerous cover albums, one of which convinced Parsons to invite her to the studio to sing on Wright's composition \"The Great Gig in the Sky\". She declined this invitation as she wanted to watch Chuck Berry perform at the Hammersmith Odeon, but arranged to come in on the following Sunday. The band explained the concept behind the album, but were unable to tell her exactly what she should do. Gilmour was in charge of the session, and in a few short takes on a Sunday night Torry improvised a wordless melody to accompany Wright's emotive piano solo. She was initially embarrassed by her exuberance in the recording booth, and wanted to apologise to the band only to find them delighted with her performance. Her takes were then selectively edited to produce the version used on the track. For her contribution she was paid \u00a330, her standard session fee, equivalent to about \u00a3 in . In 2004, she sued EMI and Pink Floyd for 50% of the songwriting royalties, arguing that her contribution to \"The Great Gig in the Sky\" was substantial enough to be considered co-authorship. The case was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum, with all post-2005 pressings crediting Wright and Torry jointly.", "left|thumb|upright|alt=Photograph|Clare Torry in 2003", "* Clare Torry\u00a0\u2013 vocals on \"The Great Gig in the Sky\""]}, {"page": "Robin Gibb", "response": ["On 19 March 1969, he announced that he was leaving the Bee Gees the same day as the band recorded \"Tomorrow Tomorrow\", their first single without Robin. In his solo career, Gibb was initially successful with a number 2 UK hit, \"Saved by the Bell\", which sold over one million copies and received a gold disc. He performed that song on the German TV show Beat-Club. Also in 1969, Gibb co-produced \"Love for Living\". The song was performed by Clare Torry and was released as a single. He also started a mini-tour, making television appearances in a dozen countries to promote \"Saved by the Bell\". By 19 July 1969, New Musical Express announced \"Tonight, [Robin Gibb] is fronting a 97-piece orchestra and a 60-piece choir in a recording of his latest composition, 'To Heaven and Back', which was inspired by the Apollo 11 moonshot. It is an entirely instrumental piece, with the choir being used for astral effects. The single will be billed as by 'The Robin Gibb Orchestra and Chorus' and it will be rush-released as soon as possible by Polydor\". At that time, he was doing a musical score for Henry The Eighth and making his own film called Family Tree. Later, it was reported on NME that Gibb wrote dozens of songs for Tom Jones.
