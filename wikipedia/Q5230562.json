When Gillard later met Bernbach in the United States, he was told that \"Two or three or the best people we've had here came in off the street\"\u2014an idea that strongly resonated and influenced Gillard's eclectic choice of students in the years that followed. Crucially, as copywriter David Abbott, founder of Abbott Mead Vickers BBDO, observed Gillard: \"always gave his people real tasks that allowed them to gain creative judgement\". Bob Connor of Brunnings Advertising later recalled that Gillard's pupils from the London College of Printing were \"fresh and original, clear thinking with a different perspective. Just like him... Many of today's top creative stars came from those early beginnings\". ", "Gillard was highly respected and his influence extended beyond his own pupils. In a 1986 interview with The British Journal of Photography, for example, Paul Arden, some time creative director of Saatchi and Saatchi, described his \"enormous admiration\" for Gillard's educational work. Copywriter David Abbott agreed, noting that \"I never failed to be impressed by the people he had taught\". Lamenting the closure of The School of Communication Arts, shortly after John Gillard's death, Caroline Marshall, then editor of Campaign, noted that his \"fame extended far beyond this advertising village and his influence will not be forgotten\"."]}]}}
