He established a British 25-mile (40 km) record of 49 minutes and 24 seconds in 1978, averaging 30.364 mph (49.190 km/h). He was the first rider to beat 50 minutes and thus the first to average more than 30 mph (48 km/h).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Fixed-gear bicycle", "response": ["Some road racing and club cyclists use a fixed-gear bicycle for training during the winter months, generally using a relatively low gear ratio, believed to help develop a good pedalling style. In the UK until the 1950s it was common for riders to use fixed-gear bicycles for time trials.  The 1959 British 25 mile time trial championship was won by Alf Engers with a competition record of 55 minutes 11 seconds, riding an 84-inch fixed-gear bicycle. The fixed-gear was also commonly used, and continues to be used in the end of season hill climb races in the autumn.  A typical club men's fixed-gear machine would have been a \"road/path\" or \"road/track\" cycle. In the era when most riders only had one cycle, the same bike when stripped down and fitted with racing wheels was used for road time trials and track racing, and when fitted with mudguards (fenders) and a bag, it was used for club runs, touring and winter training. By the 1960s, multi-gear derailleurs had become the norm and riding fixed-gear bicycles on the road declined over the next few decades. Recent years have seen renewed interest and increased popularity of fixed-gear cycling."]}, {"page": "List of British cyclists", "response": ["* Alf Engers"]}, {"page": "List of cyclists", "response": ["* Alf Engers"]}, {"page": "Alf engers", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alf Engers "]}, {"page": "Archer Road Club", "response": ["Alaric Gayfer won the juvenile 10-mile time trial championship in 1972 and the junior 25-mile time trial championship in 1974.
