The brigade was part of the 4th Infantry Division and was sent overseas in October 1939 to join the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). The 2nd Battalion fought against the German Army in the battles of Belgium and France, until being forced to retreat to Dunkirk and were evacuated back to the United Kingdom, where they stayed until late 1942, anticipating a German invasion. In June 1942, the 11th Brigade, of whom the 2nd Lancashire Fusiliers were a part, was transferred to the newly created 78th Infantry Division. They then served in the final stages of the North African Campaign, the Tunisian Campaign, where the 78th Battleaxe Division gained an excellent reputation, Medjez El Bab, Sicily, and the Italian Campaign (as part of the Gothic Line). During the fighting in Italy, Fusilier Frank Jefferson was awarded the Victoria Cross."]}, {"page": "78th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)", "response": ["The 78th Division was initially held in reserve in North Africa for the Allied invasion of Sicily and spent the time bringing units up to strength with reinforcements, and training for future operations. However, Montgomery's Eighth Army, facing stiff German resistance, requested reinforcements and the 78th landed in Sicily in late July 1943, where it became part of Lieutenant General Sir Oliver Leese's XXX Corps. The division fought with distinction in Sicily, in particular at the Battle of Centuripe in August, earning the praise of the Army commander. The division then, after a short rest after the fighting in Sicily was over, went on to fight in the Italian Campaign, landing in Italy in late September 1943, transferring back to Lieutenant General Allfrey's V Corps. Notable engagements in Italy (where, from December 1943 onwards the division was commanded by Major General Charles Keightley)) include the assaults on the Viktor Line (Battle of Termoli), the Moro River Campaign, the Barbara Line and the Winter Line as well as the Battle of Monte Cassino\u2013where Fusilier Frank Jefferson of the 2nd Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers earned the division's third and final VC of the war\u2013and the Trasimene Line."]}, {"page": "Francis Arthur Jefferson", "response": ["#REDIRECT Frank Jefferson"]}]}}
