He was an officer in the British Army, as well as an amateur zoologist who spent many years in South-East Asia.\nHe was Curator of the Sarawak Museum from November 1908 to January 1915, and founding editor of the Sarawak Museum Journal in 1911.  He served with his regiment \"The Wilts\", in India 1915\u20131916 and as staff officer in Singapore 1916\u20131919, following which he resigned with the rank of Major.  In July 1919 he was appointed Director of the Raffles Museum in Singapore, a position he held until 1923. After this, Moulton returned to Sarawak as the Chief Secretary to the third White Rajah, Charles Vyner Brooke. Moulton specialised in research on cicadas. He was interested in entomology, birds and mammals.  Most of his scientific papers were published in the journals of the Straits and Malayan branches of the Royal Asiatic Society as well as in the Sarawak Museum Journal.\nAfter returning to England on 29 May 1926 for a 3-month break and visit to his ancestral home, The Hall in Bradford-on-Avon, he fell ill on the following day and was operated on for appendicitis in a London nursing home by Sir Arbuthnot Lane but died there on 6 June at the age of 39. He is buried in a family grave with his parents and widow in the churchyard at Christ Church, Bradford-on-Avon.\nThe genus Moultonianthus Merr. and many species of plants were named after him.\nAlex Moulton, innovative engineer and inventor (9 April 1920 \u2013 9 December 2012) was his son.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alex Moulton", "response": ["Moulton was educated at Marlborough College and King's College, Cambridge. He was the great-grandson of the rubber pioneer Stephen Moulton, the founder of the family business George Spencer Moulton & Co. Ltd., in which he worked after World War II, specialising in rubber suspension systems for vehicles. His father, John Coney Moulton, was a naturalist working in the Far East."]}, {"page": "Mount Murud", "response": ["The first attempt to climb Mount Murud was made in 1914 by John Coney Moulton, curator of Sarawak State Museum but failed due to food shortage and killings of their native guides due to a Dayak Lun Bawang invasion. He made a second attempt to climb the mountain in 1920 but failed again. The first successful ascent of Mount Murud was by a Swedish zoologist who was also a curator of Sarawak State Museum, Eric Mj\u00f6berg in October 1922. He spent six days at the summit of the mountain and collected various animal and plant species. His collections were documented by various authors in the third volume of Sarawak Museum Journal in 1928. Following this, his footsteps were followed by other botanical collectors in the 1960s and 1990s. During Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation, a Gurkha post was built at the summit. In the 1980s, a man from Ba'kelalan named Agung Bangau saw a vision to build a church there. A church was later built at a plateau on the mountain and the  first prayer meeting was held in July 1985, attended by 600 people from the nearby villages of Ba'kelalan and Bario. Today, a village is built around the church completed with public amenities; receiving visitors around the world. It is regarded as a sacred mountain where smoking and alcoholic drinks are prohibited. Prayer meetings are held every two years by the Mount Murud Prayer Ministry. In 1995, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak (UNIMAS) organised an expedition to Mount Murud. During the expedition, a species of Vanilla orchid  named Vanilla kinabaluensis, Rafflesia pricei, and slipper orchid Paphiopedilum were discovered. A total of 70 samples were collected by the UNIMAS expedition team."]}, {"page": "Sarawak State Museum", "response": ["* John Coney Moulton \u2014 November 1908 \u2013 22 January 1915"]}, {"page": "Nabalua", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by John Coney Moulton"]}, {"page": "John Coney", "response": ["*John Coney Moulton (1886\u20131926), British zoologist"]}, {"page": "Moulton (surname)", "response": ["*John Coney Moulton, British military officer, entomologist and museum director"]}, {"page": "Trengganua", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by John Coney Moulton"]}, {"page": "List of heads of government of the Raj of Sarawak", "response": ["|11|| ||John Coney Moulton||1923\u20131926||"]}, {"page": "List of plant genera named for people (K\u2013P)", "response": ["|data-sort-value=\"Moulton\"|John Coney Moulton (1886\u20131926)"]}]}}
