Alex Williams, who was Clyde's top scorer the previous season, missed the match through injury along with Sean Higgins and Fergus Tiernan. Craig Samson started in goals for County, with on loan Celtic duo Gary Irvine and Michael Gardyne also getting starts. Gardyne was partnered by Frenchman Amick Ciani, the only non-Scot in both squads, in attack. Experienced duo Don Cowie and Derek Adams were partnered in the centre of midfield. The midfield was completed by youngsters Craig Gunn and Martin Scott. Midfielder Kevin McKinlay found himself in the unfamiliar position of left back, playing alongside Andy Dowie and Alex Keddie. Jason Crooks, who would go on to score the winning penalty, was making his first senior appearance from the bench."]}, {"page": "2004\u201305 Ross County F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Fergus Tiernan"]}, {"page": "2006\u201307 Dumbarton F.C. season", "response": ["|  Fergus Tiernan"]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Dumbarton F.C. season", "response": ["|  Fergus Tiernan"]}, {"page": "Aberdeen F.C.
