Unlike Big L, Radio 1 was not a full-time station, but a hybrid of recorded music and live studio orchestras. Peel recalled, \"I was one of the first lot on Radio 1 and I think it was mainly because ... Radio 1 had no real idea what they were doing so they had to take people off the pirate ships because there wasn't anybody else.\" Peel presented a programme called Top Gear. At first he was obliged to share presentation duties with other DJs (Pete Drummond and Tommy Vance were among his co-hosts) but in February 1968 he was given sole charge of Top Gear; he continued to present the show until it ended in 1975. Peel played an eclectic mix of the music that caught his attention, which he would continue to do throughout his career."]}, {"page": "Tommy (The Who album)", "response": ["When it was released, critics were split between those who thought the album was a masterpiece, the beginnings of a new genre, and those that felt it was exploitative. The album had a hostile reception with the BBC and certain US radio stations, with Tony Blackburn describing \"Pinball Wizard\" as \"distasteful\". Nevertheless, BBC Radio 1 received an advance copy of the album at the start of May and gave the material its first airplay on Pete Drummond's show on 3 May. Townshend promoted the album's release with interviews in which he attempted to explain the plotline. Unfortunately, because it fundamentally dealt with the abstract concept of Meher Baba's spiritual precepts, the interviews often gave confusing and contradictory details."]}, {"page": "Trapeze (band)", "response": ["Working with The Moody Blues bassist John Lodge as producer, Trapeze recorded their self-titled debut album at London's Morgan Studios and Decca Studios. Despite Jones being the band's official lead singer, Hughes performed all vocals on the release. Hughes has revealed that he was asked to sing on the album by the group's management, who deemed him to be the better of the two vocalists.Archived at Ghostarchive and the Wayback Machine:  Before the end of the year, the Rowley composition \"Send Me No More Letters\" was released as the band's first single, backed with \"Another Day\" (written by Galley, Hughes and Jones). Trapeze was released in May 1970. The album was generally well received by critics \u2013 Billboard magazine described it as featuring \"a strong rock personality\" and dubbed it \"a candidate for big chart action\", while journalist Nigel Williamson hailed it as \"a classic period example of English prog, mixing pastoral whimsy, swirling psychedelia, rock guitars and pop harmonies\". It also received significant airplay on BBC Radio 1 from DJs such as Bob Harris and Pete Drummond, and was played in full by the station. Trapeze was promoted on a string of shows in the UK between January and July."]}, {"page": "Tales from Topographic Oceans", "response": ["The album was finished in the first week of November 1973, and aired on British radio several times before its release in stores.

In March 1968, the Move returned to the charts with \"Fire Brigade\", another UK Top 3 hit, and the first on which Wood sang lead vocal. A few weeks later, around the time of the LP's release, Kefford was let go from the band due to increasing personal problems, escalated by drug usage. Wood stated that from the day the band was founded, Kefford had not got along well with any of the other band members. The Move then became a four-piece, in which Burton and (occasionally) Wayne took turns on bass on stage."]}, {"page": "Knighton, Powys", "response": ["In August 1970, Knighton hosted a rock festival with bands such as The Move, along with Pete Brown & Piblokto, Roger Bunn, Forever More, Clark-Hutchinson, James Litherland's Brotherhood (James was originally part of Colosseum) and Killing Floor.

It was hosted variously by Tommy Vance, Pete Drummond and, most notably, John Peel, who, with the help of sympathetic producers Bernie Andrews and John Walters, turned it into an award-winning show, while retaining the emphasis on new music. In 1971, the programme merged with the Sounds of the Seventies strand, broadcast on FM. It was still introduced by Peel, and moved from its weekend slot to two evenings a week."]}, {"page": "Premiata Forneria Marconi", "response": ["The first release by the six-piece band was Chocolate Kings in 1975.

The controversial US/UK cover showed a chocolate bar in a partially peeled Stars and Stripes wrapper on the front, along with the crumpled and discarded wrapper on the back.

In fact, in several songs, including during Ginger Baker's drum solo, he seems to change clothes at lightning speed due to careless post-editing, as well as Eric Clapton playing two different guitars. This is because footage from both sets, with the band wearing different clothes and Clapton using a Gibson Firebird for the first set, a Gibson 335 for the second, were edited together. The BBC used four static cameras and two hand held cams, all recording onto video tape, whilst Palmer himself filmed footage at the front of the stage, utilising a 16mm film camera.
