Those are the only two ingredients in Delia Smith's 1987 recipe.D. Smith, p. 154 Clarissa Dickson Wright's 1996 version consists of crushed cooked potatoes, finely chopped raw onion, and cooked cabbage (or brussels sprouts), seasoned with salt and pepper, mixed together and shallow-fried until browned on the exterior.Paterson and Dickson Wright, p. 97. Like Smith, Dickson Wright specifies dripping (or lard) for frying, finding vegetable oil unsuitable for frying bubble and squeak, because the mixture will not brown adequately. Several other cooks find oil or butter satisfactory.Hix, p. 214; Oliver, p. 383; and J.

To some extent the office of rector has evolved into more of a figurehead role, with a significant number of celebrities and personalities elected as rectors, such as Stephen Fry and Lorraine Kelly at Dundee, Clarissa Dickson Wright at Aberdeen, and John Cleese and Frank Muir at St. Andrews, and political figures, such as Mordechai Vanunu at Glasgow. In many cases, particularly with high-profile rectors, attendance at the university court in person is rare; the Rector nominates an individual (normally a member of the student body) with the title of Rector's Assessor, who sits as a voting member of the University Court."]}, {"page": "English cuisine", "response": ["English cookery has developed over many centuries since at least the time of The Forme of Cury, written in the Middle Ages around 1390 in the reign of King Richard II. The book offers imaginative and sophisticated recipes, with spicy sweet and sour sauces thickened with bread or quantities of almonds boiled, peeled, dried and ground, and often served in pastry. Foods such as gingerbread are described. It was not at all, emphasises Clarissa Dickson Wright in her A History of English Food, a matter of large lumps of roast meat at every meal as imagined in Hollywood films.", "All five of David's early books remained in print half a century later, and her reputation among cookery writers such as Nigel Slater and Clarissa Dickson Wright is of enormous influence. The historian of food Panikos Panayi suggests that this is because she consciously brought foreign cooking styles into the English kitchen; she did this with fine writing, and with practical experience of living and cooking in the countries she wrote about. She deliberately destroyed the myths of restaurant cuisine, instead describing the home cooking of Mediterranean countries. Her books paved the way for other cookery writers to use foreign recipes. Post-David celebrity chefs, often ephemeral, included Philip Harben, Fanny Cradock, Graham Kerr (\"the galloping gourmet\"), and Robert Carrier.", "Curry was created by the arrival of the British in India in the seventeenth century, beginning as bowls of spicy sauce used, Lizzie Collingham writes, to add \"bite to the rather bland flavours of boiled and roasted meats.\" The 1758 edition of Hannah Glasse's The Art of Cookery contains what Clarissa Dickson Wright calls a \"famous recipe\" which describes how \"To make a currey the Indian way\"; it flavours chicken with onions fried in butter, the chicken being fried with turmeric, ginger and ground pepper, and stewed in its own stock with cream and lemon juice. Dickson Wright comments that she was \"a bit sceptical\" of this recipe, as it had few of the expected spices, but was \"pleasantly surprised by the end result\" which had \"a very good and interesting flavour\"."]}, {"page": "Countryside Alliance", "response": ["The Countryside Alliance Awards is a national awards scheme set up in 2006, also known as The Rural Oscars. Its aim is to \"award rural businesses that go the extra mile, who support their local economy and are unsung heroes in every community\". The awards are led by public nominations, covering seven categories: village shop/post office, local food and drink, rural enterprise, pub, butcher, game and the Clarissa Dickson Wright award, which was instituted in 2013.", "In 2019, the Countryside Alliance stated that it had received over 17,000 nominations. The awards ceremony is usually held in the month of June at the House of Lords. Previous judges have included Michael Gove, Andrea Leadsom, Liz Truss, William Sitwell and the late Clarissa Dickson Wright."]}, {"page": "Isabella Beeton", "response": ["The Book of Household Management has been edited, revised and enlarged several times since Beeton's death and is still in print as at 2016. Food writers have stated that the subsequent editions of the work were far removed from and inferior to the original version. Several cookery writers, including Elizabeth David and Clarissa Dickson Wright, have criticised Beeton's work, particularly her use of other people's recipes. Others, such as the food writer Bee Wilson, consider the censure overstated, and that Beeton and her work should be thought extraordinary and admirable. Her name has become associated with knowledge and authority on Victorian cooking and home management, and the Oxford English Dictionary states that by 1891 the term Mrs Beeton had become used as a generic name for a domestic authority. She is also considered a strong influence in the building or shaping of a middle-class identity of the Victorian era.", "Beeton and her main work have been subjected to criticism over the course of the twentieth century. Elizabeth David complains of recipes that are \"sometimes slapdash and misleading\", although she acknowledges that Prosper Montagn\u00e9's Larousse Gastronomique also contains errors. The television cook Delia Smith admits she was puzzled \"how on earth Mrs Beeton's book managed to utterly eclipse\u00a0... [Acton's] superior work\", while her fellow chef, Clarissa Dickson Wright, opines that \"It would be unfair to blame any one person or one book for the decline of English cookery, but Isabella Beeton and her ubiquitous book do have a lot to answer for.\" In comparison, the food writer Bee Wilson opines that disparaging Beeton's work was only a \"fashionable\" stance to take and that the cook's writing \"simply makes you want to cook\". Christopher Driver, the journalist and food critic, suggests that the \"relative stagnation and want of refinement in the indigenous cooking of Britain between 1880 and 1930\" may instead be explained by the \"progressive debasement under successive editors, revises and enlargers\". David comments that \"when plain English cooks\" were active in their kitchens, \"they followed plain English recipes and chiefly those from the Mrs Beeton books or their derivatives\". Dickson Wright considers Beeton to be a \"fascinating source of information\" from a social history viewpoint, and Aylett and Ordish consider the work to be \"the best and most reliable guide for the scholar to the domestic history of the mid-Victorian era\"."]}, {"page": "Keith Allen (actor)", "response": ["In 2001, he played the character of \"problem-solver\" Jim Napeworth in an episode of Murder in Mind, and in 2004 cameod in Black Books as poker-player Dave 'Mouse Ears' Smith. In 2002 he played the London Records executive Roger Ames in 24 Hour Party People, a film about Factory Records and the Manchester music scene. Allen cameoed in the Channel 4 sitcom Spaced in a short homage to the Stanley Kubrick film, The Shining. He appeared as the villain in the sequel to 2004's Agent Cody Banks, Agent Cody Banks 2: Destination London, opposite Frankie Muniz. He appeared in the hospital drama, Bodies, as Mr Tony Whitman, a sarcastic but somehow likeable consultant obstetrician with an enormous ego. In 2005 he appeared in the Endemol-produced BBC Two television programme Art School alongside Ulrika Jonsson, John Humphrys and Clarissa Dickson Wright where he discovered a passion for painting. From 2006 to 2009, Allen appeared in the BBC's Robin Hood drama series, as the Sheriff of Nottingham."]}, {"page": "University of Aberdeen", "response": ["The rector of the university has been\u2014since 1860\u2014elected by the students to serve a three-year term of office; before that, the office was appointed.
