It began teaching on the site of the former Richmond Theological College, part of the University of London, founded in 1843 as a Methodist theological college. AIFS had been previously using the college site for a number of years for their London study abroad programmes. AIFS purchased half of the college's 10-acre site for \u00a3300,000 (equivalent to \u00a33.82 million in 2015), including the majority of its buildings and front lawns, to form a new American liberal arts college.Cyril Taylor. 2013.

The meeting was organised by Cyril Taylor and focused on the growing issue of unemployment amongst the youth. Among the attendees were Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Secretary of State for Employment David Young and 60 other business leaders and politicians. It was decided that around 100 schools would be funded to specialise in technology via direct grants to fulfil business qualifications. The resulting City Technology Colleges (CTC) programme was announced at that year's Conservative Party Conference by Secretary of State for Education and Science Kenneth Baker. The following year, the City Technology Colleges Trust, made to oversee the establishment of CTCs, was established. It was chaired by Cyril Taylor. CTC schools were then introduced a year later through the Education Reform Act 1988, specialising in science and technology-based subjects. CTCs operated in the state school apparatus but were granted independence from the local education authorities (LEAs), instead being controlled and funded by sponsors and the central government. The original target for schools with CTC status was 200, but this soon proved to be impossible. A total of 15 CTCs were established before the programme's discontinuation. ", "Upon discontinuation in 1993, the Major government announced a replacement Technology College programme, thus beginning the specialist schools programme. Continuing the restrictions on LEA control, this programme was originally exclusively offered to voluntary aided and grant-maintained schools. Schools wishing to be designated as a specialist Technology College had to apply through a raised private sponsorship bid of \u00a3100,000. If accepted, schools with specialist status were then allocated a fund equivalent to the money raised that would be spent towards their specialism over a three-year period (later four), re-designating after this period had expired. The required amount of money raised decreased to \u00a350,000 some years later, however the funding received (\u00a3100,000) stayed the same. The programme launched in 1994 and applications were extended to LEA schools under the direction of then education secretary, Gillian Shepherd. This led to much of Labour, who initially opposed the programme, to lend their support. Shepherd planned to introduce a MFL specialism, beginning designations in 1995. These were the specialist Language Colleges and a year later, in 1996, Sports and Arts Colleges were announced and, after that, introduced in 1997. By the end of 1996, 182 schools were designated specialists, with the majority being Technology Colleges. In light of this, the City Technology Colleges Trust was renamed to the Technology Colleges Trust (it oversaw and delivered the programme). Cyril Taylor, chairman of the trust and successive adviser to multiple education secretaries, convinced Labour leader Tony Blair to support specialist schools.", "The CTC programme was supported and announced by education secretary Kenneth Baker. Although most major companies and businessmen saw no reason to support the programme, sponsors were found in people like Lord Harris (later the sponsor of the Harris Federation), Harry Djanogly, Stanley Kalms and Michael Ashcroft. The City Technology Colleges Trust led by Cyril Taylor also sponsored, oversaw and delivered the programme. Taylor was the main supporter of specialist schools, often being regarded as their pioneer. The supporters within the government were Chris Patten, Tony Kerpel, Alistair Burt, George Walden, Bob Dunn and Virginia Bottomley. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and her chief policy adviser, Brian Griffiths, also offered their guidance and feedback on the programme. Thatcher's main motivation for this was her opposition to the LEAs and her vision to move schools out of their control. Griffiths often compared them to Soviet republics, bringing this comparison to anti-communist Thatcher:"]}, {"page": "Deaths in January 2018", "response": ["*Sir Cyril Taylor, 82, British educator.Sir Cyril Taylor"]}, {"page": "Cyril Julian Hebden Taylor", "response": ["#REDIRECT Cyril Taylor (educationist)"]}, {"page": "Cyril Taylor", "response": ["Cyril Taylor may refer to:", "*Cyril Taylor (doctor) (1921\u20132000), British doctor and Liverpool politician", "*Sir Cyril Taylor (educationist) (1935\u20132018), British educationist and social entrepreneur"]}, {"page": "William L.
