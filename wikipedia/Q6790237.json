In that same season he made a single first-class appearance for Lancashire against Somerset at the County Ground, Taunton, in the County Championship.  He batted once in the match, scoring 16 runs in Lancashire's first-innings, before he was dismissed by Matthew Bulbeck.  It was in that same season that he also made his List A debut against Middlesex at the Denis Compton Oval in the 2002 Norwich Union National League.  He made a second List A appearance the following season against India A at Stanley Park, Blackpool.  He thereafter appeared for the Lancashire Second XI, with Rees agreeing a new contract during the 2004 season.  However, with opportunities limited at Lancashire, he left the county during the 2005 season."]}, {"page": "List of Somerset Cricket Board List A players", "response": ["Only two players took part in all five of the SCB's List A matches; Kevin Parsons and Mathew Dimond. Parsons captained the SCB in all five matches, and was also the team's highest aggregate run-scorer, accumulating 125 runs for the team, while Dimond took more wickets for the SCB than any other player, claiming six during his matches for the team. Arul Suppiah, who only played for the team once, scored 70 runs in an innings against Cornwall in 2002, the team's highest score. Another player who only appeared once for the side, Matthew Bulbeck, has the best bowling figures for the team, after taking five wickets against Norfolk in 2001. That performance also gives him the best bowling average amongst SCB players, with 3.60. In all, 31 players have appeared for the SCB, of which ten have also made first-class cricket appearances."]}, {"page": "Bulbeck", "response": ["*Matthew Bulbeck (born 1979), former English First-class and List A cricketer"]}, {"page": "Bulbeck, Matthew", "response": ["#redirectMatthew Bulbeck"]}]}}
