And Possibly A New Celebrity Jesus Christ Soapstar Superstar Strictly On Ice, a fully scripted fictional spoof on the talent show genre. The show parodied the emotional manipulation behind Cowell's shows, with Waterman memorably interrupting a funeral to tell an ousted contestant that the loss of his gran (who had died of shock when learning her grandson had been dropped from the show) would provide the sob story he needed to get him on to the show."]}, {"page": "Pop Idol", "response": ["The Saturday night primetime show initially followed the audition process, as hopefuls sang before four judges (record producer and music executive Pete Waterman, music executive and music manager Simon Cowell, music promoter and music manager Nicki Chapman and Radio DJ and television personality Neil \"Dr\" Fox) at various locations around the UK. Besides the successful auditionees, the poorest \"singers\" were often aired due to their obvious lack of talent or presence. Poor singers often faced harsh criticisms from the judges, especially from Simon Cowell (whose controversial rantings also made him famous on American Idol). The judges' reactions to such performances often ranged from disgust to nearly open laughter; their style of judgement and attitude towards pop-star wannabes resulted in the controversial opinions of others about the show's setup, including that of Take That manager Nigel Martin Smith."]}, {"page": "Will Young", "response": ["On 20 June 2001, one of Young's university classmates showed him an advertisement in the News of the World for auditionees of Pop Idol, a planned nationwide televised talent show to find a solo pop artist in a similar way that Popstars had created the pop band Hear'Say the previous year.Young (2002) pp. 15\u201316 The winner was guaranteed a \u00a31\u00a0million recording contract with BMG and representation by 19 Management.McPhee (2005) p.54.

He was the final contestant the judges saw, and after a day of watching mostly poor performances they were not in the best spirits. Again, Young performed \"Blame It on the Boogie\", but the judges thought his overall performance was merely average. Chapman told him that his dance moves had let him down, but his vocal was good.

The following week, auditions were held at the Criterion Theatre, and Young sang \"All or Nothing\" by O-Town, the Drifters' \"Up on the Roof\" and \"Fast Love\" by George Michael.
