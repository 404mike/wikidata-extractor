In 1933, and more forcefully in 1934, during the prophet's birthday celebrations Abd al-Rahman displayed signs with \"various expressions advertising the Mahdi's prophetic standing\". Sir Stewart Symes, Governor-General of Sudan from 1934 to 1940, sternly warned him to remove the signs or face consequences.", "A British view of Abd al-Rahman at this time was given by Sir Stewart Symes, writing in April 1935, \"He has the defects of a Sudanese of his type, the liking of intrigue, vanity, irrelevance and opportunism. On the other hand, he has quick perceptions, panache and subtle tenacity of purpose... He has used [or misued] the opportunities ... of laying the foundations of his Mahdist organization in the provinces... His favorite role is that of the loyal supporter of Government who is maliciously misunderstood\". Symes refused to take action to suppress neo-Mahdism, preferring to follow a policy of ensuring that Abd al-Rahman conformed to agreed guidelines of behavior, with the implied threat of punishment if he broke these rules.
