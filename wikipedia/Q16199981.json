Greater Manchester's chief constable Peter Fahy called the attack \"cold-blooded murder\" and then British prime minister David Cameron described it as a \"despicable act...of pure evil\".\nOn 12 February 2013, Cregan changed his plea to guilty in relation to the murder of the two police officers. Three months later he admitted to carrying out two separate murders in 2012, which were linked to a gangland feud in Manchester.
