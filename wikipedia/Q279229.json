Szklarski admits that King is another \"urban whodunit\" but that it goes about it from a distinctively female point of view. Eric Volmers of the Calgary Herald found the fallibility of the character Derek Spears to be \"what promises to give King its continued dramatic tension.\" Bill Harris of Quebecor Media found King is \"not a cookie-cutter police procedural\" in that DS King's personal life is a significant part of the show."]}, {"page": "Canadian Screen Award for Best Actress in a Continuing Leading Dramatic Role", "response": ["| Amy Price-Francis"]}, {"page": "1st Canadian Screen Awards", "response": ["* Amy Price-Francis, King"]}, {"page": "The Purge: Anarchy", "response": ["* Amy Price-Francis as Mrs. Grass, Warren's wife"]}, {"page": "Bosch (TV series)", "response": ["Amazon Studios announced on October 31, 2013, that Bosch had been given the green light for production.
