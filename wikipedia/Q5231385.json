They first tasted success in this division when they finished runners-up to Margate in 1977/78, going unbeaten in the final 16 matches of the season, with manager David Best utilising his links with old club AFC Bournemouth to attract former first-teamers such as John O'Rourke, Jack Howarth and Harry Redknapp to the Avenue.", "The formation of the Alliance League (now the Football Conference) unfortunately meant the Magpies ended up back in the reformed Southern Division a year later, but the club celebrated its centenary by winning the Southern Division in 1979/80 by a one-point margin over Aylesbury. Stuart Bell succeeded David Best as manager during the season, and the Magpies went unbeaten in the last 14 games to clinch the title. A young Trevor Senior impressed alongside ever-present top scorer Paul Thorne, whilst Graham Roberts joined neighbours Weymouth early in the campaign for \u00a36,000 before going on to star for Tottenham Hotspur and England."]}, {"page": "Trevor Whymark", "response": ["The following season Whymark only recorded eight full appearances with two substitute appearances and a single goal (in a 4\u20130 victory of Manchester United). It would appear this was a season cut short by injury as all of these games were played before October 10. It is also worth noting that following an injury to goalkeeper David Best in a game against West Bromwich Albion Whymark came off the bench to play in goal."]}, {"page": "Best (surname)", "response": ["* David Best (footballer) (born 1943), former English footballer", "* David Best (politician) (1880\u20131949), Manitoba politician", "* David Best (sculptor) (born 1945), American sculptor"]}, {"page": "Laurie Sivell", "response": ["Sivell spent 15 years with Ipswich Town, between 1969 and 1984.

He  also played two games on loan to Lincoln City in the 1978\u201379 season. Sivell was noted for his bravery, typically diving at the feet of oncoming strikers to snatch the ball, and had considerable athletic ability to offset his diminutive size (for a goalkeeper).  Sivell contributed to Ipswich's victorious 1980-81 UEFA Cup campaign, making one appearance during the run.

Bobby Robson led the club to finish fourth in the First Division 1972\u201373 season and qualified for the 1973\u201374 UEFA Cup where their opponents in the first round were Spanish team Real Madrid.  A deflected shot from Mick Mills proved to be the only goal of the game, marred by the referee being struck by a projectile from the crowd which had caused a two-minute delay.  The second leg in Madrid ended goalless allowing Ipswich to progress to the second round 1\u20130 on aggregate.  The second round draw saw Ipswich face Italian team Lazio, the first leg to be played at Portman Road.  Trevor Whymark scored four times, twice in each half, to enable Ipswich to take a 4\u20130 lead back to Rome.  The return leg in the Stadio Olimpico was a bad-tempered affair.  Despite taking an early two-goal lead, Lazio conceded a penalty with fifteen minutes remaining which Colin Viljoen converted; he was punched and kicked on his way to for the restart.  Full beer cans were thrown from the crowd which were subsequently used by Lazio players as missiles against both the Ipswich players and the referee. Union Jacks were burnt by some members of the crowd.  On the pitch, Lazio's Giorgio Chinaglia completed his hat-trick but a last-minute goal from David Johnson ended the leg 4\u20132, with Ipswich going through 6\u20134 on aggregate.  At the final whistle, the Ipswich players sprinted off the pitch during which goalkeeper David Best was injured by the Lazio supporters. The team were locked in their dressing room for their own protection from the home supporters for more than an hour.    Robson later remarked \"Lazio were human beings gone berserk!\"  Ipswich faced FC Twente of the Netherlands in the third round, winning the first leg on a frozen and snow-covered Portman Road pitch 1\u20130 courtesy of a late Whymark goal who tapped the ball into an empty net after Twente goalkeeper Piet Schrijvers palmed away a shot from Clive Woods.  The return leg in Enschede ended 2\u20131 in Ipswich's favour, with second half goals from Bryan Hamilton and Peter Morris, the tie ending 3\u20131 on aggregate.  Once again violence affected the game with Hamilton being punched to the ground out of the referee's vision, and four Ipswich fans requiring hospital treatment after clashing with Twente supporters.  The quarter final draw paired Ipswich with Lokomotive Leipzig. The first leg, played at Portman Road, ended 1\u20130 with a late goal from Kevin Beattie after Ipswich \"had done everything but score\".  Robson noted that Leipzig should be happy with the result, suggesting \"they were only just short of a thrashing\".  The second leg saw Mick Mills being sent off late in the first half for what he claimed to be a retaliatory foul on East German international player Wolfram L\u00f6we.  Five minutes into the second half,  scored from a L\u00f6we corner, and the game ended 1\u20130, with an aggregate score of 1\u20131 sending the game into penalties. At 3\u20133, it was sudden death; Allan Hunter's penalty was then saved by Werner Friese, and Ipswich were out."]}]}}
