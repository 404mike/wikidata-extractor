He played for Bakerloo, but left the group following the release of its only album. He subsequently became the first drummer of Supertramp (then called Daddy) between late 1969 and early 1970. Baker joined Uriah Heep prior to their second album Salisbury, replacing Nigel Olsson. He recorded the album with the group, but left when he did not want to tour extensively with the band and was replaced by Ian Clark.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Uriah Heep (band)", "response": ["When Nigel Olsson returned to Elton John's group in the spring of 1970, Keith Baker took his place. The band's second album, Salisbury (February 1971), was more squarely in the progressive rock genre, with its 16-minute title track featuring a 24-piece orchestra. One of the album's tracks, \"Lady in Black\", described by Donald A. Guarisco as \"...a stylishly arranged tune that builds from a folk-styled acoustic tune into a throbbing rocker full of ghostly harmonies and crunching guitar riffs,\" became a hit in Germany upon its re-release in 1977 (earning the band the Radio Luxemburg Lion award). Produced by Gerry Bron, the second album was significant for Ken Hensley's rise to the position of main songwriter.", "In December 1970 Keith Baker left the band and was replaced by Iain Clark (from another Vertigo band, Cressida).

He offered Swindon-born keyboardist Rick Davies, a former bandmate of Irish singer-songwriter Gilbert O'Sullivan, whose talent he felt had been \"bogged down\" by the group, an opportunity to form his own band with Miesegaes's financial backing. Davies assembled Roger Hodgson (bass and vocals), Richard Palmer (guitars and vocals), and Keith Baker (percussion) after placing an advertisement in the weekly music newspaper Melody Maker.", "In January 1970 Keith Baker left, and to avoid confusion with the similarly named Daddy Longlegs, at Palmer's suggestion, the band changed its name to \"Supertramp\", a moniker inspired by The Autobiography of a Super-Tramp by William Henry Davies.\"Supertramp\", www.classicbands.com.
