A good reporter, he was soon earning as much as \u00a320 a week, but thought there were more possibilities, and money, in the theatre. He joined forces with London impresario Sir Edward Moss and staged revues at the London Hippodrome.\nIn the 1930s he turned to making films. His two most famous films,  both featuring Jessie Matthews were There Goes the Bride (1932) and The Midshipmaid (1932). He also directed The Wrecker, an adaptation of Arnold Ridley\u2019s play of the same name, and Seven Sinners (1936).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1939 in film", "response": ["*The Lambeth Walk, directed by Albert de Courville, starring Lupino Lane and Sally Gray \u2013 (GB)"]}, {"page": "Jessie Matthews", "response": ["Matthews' first major film role was in Out of the Blue (1931).

In another scene, he played a drunken gentleman who accidentally secures a box at the Savoy Theatre instead of an intended hotel room. The audience appeared unresponsive to the character, so he changed it mid-performance to that of a naive Yorkshire man. The change provoked much amusement, and it became one of the most popular scenes of the show. Zig-Zag ran for 648 performances. Stoll again secured Robey for the Alhambra in 1918 for a sequel, The Bing Boys on Broadway.
