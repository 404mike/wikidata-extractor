A good reporter, he was soon earning as much as \u00a320 a week, but thought there were more possibilities, and money, in the theatre. He joined forces with London impresario Sir Edward Moss and staged revues at the London Hippodrome.\nIn the 1930s he turned to making films. His two most famous films,  both featuring Jessie Matthews were There Goes the Bride (1932) and The Midshipmaid (1932). He also directed The Wrecker, an adaptation of Arnold Ridley\u2019s play of the same name, and Seven Sinners (1936).", "link_mentions": {}}}
