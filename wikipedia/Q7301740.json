The aim of the project was to explore themes from the perspective of practicing painters which held a particular 21st century resonance. Following the initial programme of solo exhibitions at the crypt a group drawn from the exhibited painters formed an advisory board. Out of this, a series of group exhibitions was developed along with a series of talks, reading groups and the donation of paintings by members of the group to art collections, galleries and museums in the UK and around the world. This was further enabled through the formation of an external advisory board including members Michael Peppiatt (owner and publisher of Art International 1985-1995 and board member of the Palazzo delle Esposizioni, Rome), Amanda Geitner (Senior Curator of the  Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts, 1998-2015 and Director East Anglian Art Fund), Professor Rebecca Fortnum (Director of Graduate Studies in Fine Art Middlesex University and Dr Lisa Wade (Head of Department, Arts and Humanities, University Campus Suffolk)."]}, {"page": "List of people named Rebecca", "response": ["*Rebecca Fortnum (born 1963), British artist, writer, and academic"]}]}}
