In December 1996, Byng was released by Doncaster, joining Ilkeston on a free transfer.\nHe is now a Quantity Surveyor in Plymouth.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Torquay United F.C. records and statistics", "response": ["* Youngest first-team player: David Byng, 16 years 36 days (against Walsall, 14 August 1993, Division Three).", "* Youngest goalscorer: David Byng, 16 years 36 days (against Walsall, 14 August 1993, Division Three)."]}, {"page": "Byng, David", "response": ["#redirectDavid Byng"]}]}}
