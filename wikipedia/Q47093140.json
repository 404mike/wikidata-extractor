Specialising in prestressed concrete, he designed several bridges in Australia.  Stott's work on the Hammersmith flyover brought him to the attention of the London County Council where he was appointed deputy chief engineer.  He subsequently became chief engineer and was appointed Director of Highways and Transportation upon the creation of the Greater London Council.  He became one of the first joint controllers at the council when the planning department became part of his remit.  Stott left the council to become Director-General of the National Water Council.  He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1978 and in 1983 became a professor at King's College London.  Stott wrote a 1987 report on the use of open level crossings on the rail network that led to a significant change in British Rail policy and served as president of the Institution of Civil Engineers for 1989\u201390.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1978 Birthday Honours", "response": ["*Peter Frank Stott, Director-General, National Water Council."]}]}}
