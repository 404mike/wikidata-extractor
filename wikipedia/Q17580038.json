This last until Abdou \"received a straight red card for a two-footed tackle on Callum Cooke\", as AFC Wimbledon lost 1\u20130 to Blackpool on 2 September 2017 and served a three match suspension. It was not until on 26 September 2017 when he returned to the first team from suspension, coming on as a substitute in the second half, in a 1\u20130 loss against Southend United. Abdou found himself in and out of the starting eleven for the side, as he was often placed on the substitute bench and being called to the national squad on two occasions. Abdou then regained his first team place for the side by December, playing in the midfield position. He then scored his second goal for the club, in a 4\u20130 win over Bradford City on 27 January 2018. For his performance throughout January, Abdou was nominated for January's PFA Player of the Month for League One, but lost out to John-Joe O'Toole. He later appeared in and out of the first team for AFC Wimbledon towards the end of the season and helped the side retain their League One status next season.
