He was the son of Colonel H. A. Kaulback and had a younger brother Roy (known as Bill). After studying at the University of Cambridge and learning surveying at the Royal Geographical Society he accompanied Frank Kingdon-Ward on an expedition to Tibet. For political reasons Kaulback was forbidden to continue on the second part of that journey. So he, Brooks Carrington and some others set out on a route by Fort Hertz and Burma which included crossing the Diphuk La and after travelling at the worst season reached Fort Hertz. He travelled in Burma, Nepal and Tibet. His account of his journey, Tibetan Trek, was published by Hodder & Stoughton in 1934; in 1937 the 3rd edition was published.Kaulback wrote in defence of the possible existence of the Yeti, having seen what he took to be large footprints while attempting to locate the source of the Salween River.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Salween River", "response": ["At the start of the 20th century, there was still great uncertainty regarding the true sources of the river and how far west it extended into the Himalayas; some believed the upper Brahmaputra River (the Yarlung Tsangpo) might be the true source of the Irrawaddy, Salween or Mekong. In 1935-36, British geographer Ronald Kaulback walked the length of the Salween River from Burma to eastern Tibet, producing some of the first comprehensive maps of the river's course. Kaulback allegedly found giant footprints in the snow while attempting to locate the source of the Salween.
