They often also deal with emotional concepts and, sometimes, storyline concepts. Later in his career, he adapted his songwriting to better suit pop music, and wrote a number of successful songs for artists such as Celine Dion, Cher, Cliff Richard, Leo Sayer, Five Star, and Bucks Fizz.\nIn 2005, Sinfield was referred to as a \"prog rock hero\" in Q magazine for his lyrical work and influence in the music industry.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "December 27", "response": ["*  1943   \u2013 Peter Sinfield, English songwriter and producer"]}, {"page": "King Crimson", "response": ["Founded by Robert Fripp, Michael Giles, Greg Lake, Ian McDonald and lyricist Peter Sinfield, the band initially focused on a dramatic, doom-laden sound rich with layers of Mellotron strings, flute, and Lake's distinctively powerful vocals.
