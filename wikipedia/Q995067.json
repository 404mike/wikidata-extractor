He was a prominent authority on seabirds, publishing numerous books and articles on gannets, cormorants and other species, teaching zoology at the University of Aberdeen, and conducting pioneering ornithological research in Jordan, Christmas Island and the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. In his lifetime, Nelson was \"acclaimed as the world's leading expert on the northern gannet\".  He also contributed to the creation of Christmas Island National Park, which helped to preserve the habitat of the endangered Abbott's booby.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Northern gannet", "response": ["The Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner gave the northern gannet the name Anser bassanus or scoticus in the 16th century, and noted that the Scots called it a solendguse. The former name was also used by the English naturalist Francis Willughby in the 17th century; the species was known to him from a colony in the Firth of Forth and from a stray bird that was found near Coleshill, Warwickshire. It was one of the many species originally described by the Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus in the landmark 1758 10th edition of his Systema Naturae, where it was given the binomial name Pelecanus bassanus. The French biologist Brisson placed it in the genus Sula in 1760, and his compatriot Louis Vieillot moved the species to his new genus Morus in 1816. Morus is derived from Ancient Greek moros, meaning \"foolish\", and refers to the lack of fear shown by breeding gannets and boobies, which enables them to be easily killed. The specific name bassanus is from the Bass Rock in the Firth of Forth. The ornithologist Bryan Nelson in 1978 supported the species' inclusion in Sula as he felt the differences in anatomy, behaviour, ecology and morphology between gannets and boobies were not sufficient to warrant separate genera."]}, {"page": "1932 in science", "response": ["* March 14 \u2013 Joseph Bryan Nelson (died 2015), British ornithologist."]}, {"page": "Cape Kidnappers", "response": ["*Joseph Bryan Nelson and Kazimierz Wodzicki, who conducted important bird studies there."]}, {"page": "2006 New Year Honours", "response": ["* Dr. Joseph Bryan Nelson, Ecologist and Ethologist.
