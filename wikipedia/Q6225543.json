Professor of Film and Television Studies at the University of Glasgow, his books include Theories of Authorship, A Companion to British and Irish Cinema and Television Drama: Realism, Modernism, and British Culture. He is on the editorial board of the British film and television journal, Screen, and is a  Council member of the Arts and Humanities Research Council, U.K.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sydney Newman", "response": ["Newman's principal tool for shaking up this established order was a programme which had been initiated before he had arrived at ABC, Armchair Theatre. This anthology series was networked nationally across the ITV regions on Sunday evenings, and in 1959 was in the top ten of the ratings for 32 out of the 37 weeks it was broadcast, with audiences of over  viewers. Newman used the strand to present plays by writers such as Alun Owen, Harold Pinter and Clive Exton, also bringing over associates from Canada such as Charles Jarrott and Ted Kotcheff. Writing in 2000, the television historian John Caughie stated that \"Newman's insistence that the series would use only original material written for television made Armchair Theatre a decisive moment in the history of British television drama.\""]}, {"page": "George Formby", "response": ["Richards identifies in Formby \"an innocence that was essentially childlike\u00a0... which explains why George was as popular with children as he was with adults\"; Igoe agrees, and writes that \"we know he loves children, because himself he is a child\". Formby's screen and stage persona of innocence and simplicity was not seen as ignorance or stupidity, although Basil Dean disagreed and thought that Formby \"didn't act gormless as many successful Lancashire comedians have done, he was gormless\". Much of the innocence in Formby's performance is connected to sex, and the use of double entendres within his songs. John Caughie and Kevin Rockett, in their examination of British film, and Richards, see a connection between Formby's approach to sex and the saucy seaside postcards of Donald McGill. Richards sees the function of Formby's humour as being the same as McGill's: \"the harmless diffusion of a major source of tension in a deeply repressed and conventional society\". Formby's delivery of the sexual content\u2014what McFarlane identifies as being \"sung with such a toothy grin and air of innocence\"\u2014negated any possible indignation, and this contrasts with the more overtly sexual delivery of other performers of the time, such as Max Miller and Frank Randle."]}, {"page": "Caughie, John", "response": ["#redirectJohn Caughie"]}]}}
