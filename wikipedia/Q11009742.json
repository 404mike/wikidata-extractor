The longer patronymic form of his name is usually used to distinguish him from the earlier and better-known Gruffudd ap Cynan, king of Gwynedd.\nHe was born c.1150 and died at Aberconwy Abbey in 1200. He is known to have fought alongside his brother Maredudd against his uncle Hywel in 1170 and later fought on the side of his cousin Llywelyn ab Iorwerth between 1194-1197 in a campaign to depose another uncle Dafydd. Gruffudd is known to have had only one son, Hywel ap Gruffudd ap Cynan ab Owain Gwynedd, who is not known to have had any children of his own and died in 1216.", "link_mentions": {}}}
