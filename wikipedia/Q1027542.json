He also spent time on loan at Sheffield United prior to joining permanently, and returned to Burton on a permanent basis in 2017. He has made seven appearances for the England C team.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tony McMahon", "response": ["On 17 August 2013, McMahon made his first appearance of the 2013\u201314 season, starting in a 1\u20131 draw with Colchester United, and was almost ever-present in the starting eleven until 24 January, when he left for Championship club Blackpool as part of an initial \"loan-swap\" with another full back, Bob Harris. According to manager Nigel Clough, \"We have had to sacrifice Tony McMahon to get the deal done but, fortunately, we have managed to bring in John Brayford, which gives us further defensive options. We were not looking to move Tony on but with his contract up in the summer this gives him a chance to impress at Championship level.\""]}, {"page": "Russell Anderson", "response": ["Anderson started the 2010\u201311 season alongside Dean Leacock in the centre of the Derby defence as they earned a 2\u20131 win at Leeds United before an injury sustained in training ruled him out for the next two months. He returned to action with a 60-minute appearance in the reserves 3\u20131 defeat at Rotherham United. He returned to first team action as an 89th-minute substitute the following Saturday against Preston North End, winning a 93rd-minute penalty which Robbie Savage converted in a 3\u20130 Derby victory. He suffered a hamstring injury soon after which ruled him out for another three months before picking up a calf injury in his rehabilitation to rule him out until mid-February 2011. He returned to the side on 2 April with a substitute appearance in a 4\u20131 defeat at Cardiff City and featured in the remaining six games of the campaign with a further three starts and three substitute appearances. Following the end of the 2010/11 season, it was reported that Aberdeen had a move for Anderson accepted but the player rejected the chance of a move, preferring to remain at Pride Park. Anderson started the season in Derby's first team but was injured 35 minutes into the first game and missed the first month of the season. Upon returning to the side for a 3\u20130 win over Millwall at the end of September, Anderson played a role in seven of Derby's next eight games, often employed at right-back in the absence of first choice John Brayford. However, a hamstring injury sustained in a 3\u20130 home defeat to Cardiff City saw him ruled out of action for two months. The injury proved to be the final injury of a blighted spell with the Rams as his contract was canceled by mutual consent on 12 December 2011, with just 19 appearances coming in his 15 months as permanent player at the club."]}, {"page": "Lee Peltier", "response": ["On 24 January 2015, Peltier signed for Cardiff City on a deal until the summer of 2018, reuniting with his former Yeovil manager Russell Slade. Signed as a replacement for John Brayford, he made his debut for the club, a week later in a 2\u20130 loss to Derby County, and went on to help Cardiff push away from a relegation battle and finished mid-table. The following season, Peltier became an ever-present member of the team which just missed out on a play-off place to Sheffield Wednesday."]}, {"page": "Derby County F.C.", "response": ["* 2010\u201311  John Brayford"]}, {"page": "Michael Coulson (footballer)", "response": ["He joined Conference Premier club Northwich Victoria on a one-month loan on 31 August 2007 to provide cover for the injured Lee Steele. He made his debut on 4 September 2007 in a 2\u20130 defeat at home to Burton Albion, in which he came close to scoring but goalkeeper Kevin Poole and defender John Brayford blocked his efforts on goal. His first goal for Northwich came with the team's only goal in a 3\u20131 home defeat to Histon, before being substituted in the 79th minute with calf strain. Coulson returned to Barnsley after the loan expired on 30 September 2007, despite caretaker manager Paul Warhurst having convinced him to stay at Northwich for another month. He finished the loan with two goals in six appearances."]}, {"page": "Danny Buijs", "response": ["In the summer of 2009, Buijs joined ADO Den Haag, after already being on loan with the team for half a season. He signed a contract for 2 years. However, ADO Den Haag struggled in the Eredivisie in Bujis first season there and, on 14 April 2010, English Football League Championship side Derby County announced they had agreed a deal to sign Buijs for the start of the 2010\u201311 season. They pulled out of the deal, however, following the signing of Crewe Alexandra's John Brayford."]}, {"page": "Craig Alcock", "response": ["In July 2014, Alcock signed a two-year deal with Sheffield United. Alcock started as a regular in the side both at centre half and then in his more customary role at right back. However, after an injury he has found himself in a more peripheral role, made harder by the January arrivals of additional full backs Kieron Freeman and John Brayford. In his second season at United, Alcock again found match time hard to come by, and as a result joined fellow League One side Doncaster Rovers on a 28-day loan On 10 November 2015. The loan was made permanent on 7 January 2016."]}]}}
