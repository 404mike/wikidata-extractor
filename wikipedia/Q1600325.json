He commissioned production designers John Barry and Roger Christian, who were working on the sets of the film Lucky Lady (1975) when Lucas first approached them, to work on the production sets. Christian recounted in 2014: \"George came to the set I was doing, it was an old salt factory design and he helped me shovel salt, just like two students in plaid shirts and sneakers. And we spoke and he looked at the set and couldn't believe it wasn't real.\" They had a conversation with Lucas on what he would like the film to appear like, with them creating the desired sets. Christian said that Lucas \"didn't want anything [in Star Wars] to stand out, he wanted it [to look] all real and used. And I said, 'Finally somebody's doing it the right way.'\"", "The Elstree sets designed by John Barry, according to Gilbert Taylor, \"were like a coal mine.\" He said that \"they were all black and gray, with really no opportunities for lighting at all.\" To resolve the problem, he worked the lighting into the sets by chopping in its walls, ceiling and floors. This would result in \"a 'cut-out' system of panel lighting\", with quartz lamps that could be placed in the holes in the walls, ceiling and floors. His idea was supported by the Fox studio, which agreed that \"we couldn't have this 'black hole of Calcutta. The lighting approach Taylor devised \"allowed George to shoot in almost any direction without extensive relighting, which gave him more freedom.\" In total, the filming in Britain took 14-and-a-half weeks.", "| John Barry, Norman Reynolds, Leslie Dilley and Roger Christian", "| John Barry"]}, {"page": "The Empire Strikes Back", "response": ["Lucas considered replacing producer Gary Kurtz with Howard Kazanjian because of issues that arose while filming Star Wars in which Kurtz had not fulfilled his role and left problems unresolved. Kurtz convinced him otherwise by trading on his long-time loyalty to Lucas and his existing knowledge of the Star Wars property. Lucas took an executive producer role, enabling him to focus on his businesses and the development of Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981). By late 1977, Kurtz began hiring key crew members including production designer Norman Reynolds, consultant John Barry, makeup artist Stuart Freeborn, and first assistant director David Tomblin. Lucas re-hired artists Ralph McQuarrie and Joe Johnston to maintain visual consistency with Star Wars, and the three began conceptualizing the Hoth battle in December. By this point, the budget had increased to $10million. Lucas wanted a director who would support the material and accept that he was ultimately in charge. Lucas considered around 100 directors, including Alan Parker and John Badham, before hiring his old acquaintance Irvin Kershner in February 1978. Kershner was reluctant to direct the sequel to a film as successful as Star Wars, and his friends warned him against taking the job believing he would be blamed if it failed. Lucas convinced Kershner it was not so much a sequel but rather a chapter in a larger story; he also promised him he could make the film his own way.", "The Star Wars stage was completed in early May, although it was too small to house the Rebel hangar and Dagobah sets and an extension had to be funded and built. Even so, the producers mandated filming begin on the stage on May\u00a018, regardless of its state. The hangar scene involved 77 rebel extras, costing \u00a32,000 per day. Around  of dendritic salt, mixed with magnesium sulfate for a sparkle effect, were used for the snowy sets; the combination gave the cast and crew headaches. Second unit director John Barry died suddenly in early June; Harley Cokeliss replaced him a week later. The typical purpose of the second unit was to film time-consuming tasks for special effects, but they were involved in filming main scenes\u2014including Luke's ice cave imprisonment\u2014because the schedule had overrun by around 26 days. Hamill was unavailable for several days after injuring his hand during a stunt jump from a speeder bike. Having been called in for the stunt the same day his son was born, combined with exhaustion and the aggravation of the salt-laden setting, Hamill angrily rebuffed Kurtz for not using a double for the scene. Kershner's hands-on directing style, acting out how he should perform a scene agitated Hamill; Kershner was frustrated that Hamill was not following his advice."]}, {"page": "Tatooine", "response": ["George Lucas originally envisaged filming the Utapau/Tatooine scenes in Algeria (inspired by Michelangelo Antonioni's 1975 film The Passenger), Libya or Iran, but these locations were rejected by 20th Century Fox. When production began on Star Wars, production designers John Barry and Robert Watts scouted for filming locations in Morocco and Tunisia. Lucas, accompanied by producer Gary Kurtz visited the Tunisian island of Djerba with them and were impressed by the desert landscape and the unusual architecture, and selected Tunisia to provide the desert planet setting. Lucas was also keen to shoot at the Hotel Sidi Driss in Matmata, a decision which extended the shoot by a day and consequently the budget. Filming in Tunisia began on March 22, 1976, and immediately ran into difficulty: the region was experiencing its first heavy rainfall in seven years, which disrupted the setting of an arid desert planet. The Matmata hotel consisted of a troglodyte dwelling in a large hole in the ground. Combined with shots at Chott el Djerid, near Nefta, this formed the setting for the Lars homestead and moisture farm. The landing site for  and  escape pod was filmed in sand dunes at La Grande Dune, near Nefta, and exterior shots of Mos Eisley spaceport were shot on Djerba. The name Tatooine is not actually mentioned in the final screenplay of Star Wars\u2014Lucas was still working on his fourth draft while scouting locations, and adapted the name from a town in southern Tunisia called Tataouine (French spelling, or Tataween spelling in Tunisian Arabic)."]}, {"page": "John Barry", "response": ["John Barry may refer to:", "* John Barry (composer) (1933\u20132011), English film composer", "* John Barry (set designer) (1935\u20131979), British film production designer", "* John Barry, drummer and member of Stretch Arm Strong", "* John Barry (naval officer) (1745\u20131803), officer in the Continental Navy during the American Revolutionary War and in the United States Navy", "* John Barry (VC) (1873\u20131901), recipient of the Victoria Cross", "* John Barry (MP) (1845\u20131921), Irish MP for South Wexford 1885\u20131893", "* John Barry (Green Party politician) (born 1966), Irish Green Party politician", "* John Barry (tennis) (born 1928), New Zealand tennis player", "* Sir John Barry, rector of St Andrew's Church, Chew Stoke, 1524\u20131546", "* John Barry (bishop) (1799\u20131859), Irish-born American bishop in the Roman Catholic Church", "* John Barry (Dean of Elphin) (1728\u20131794), Irish Anglican dean", "* John Barry (WD-40) (1924\u20132009), American business executive; popularized the WD-40 water-displacing spray and lubricant", "* John Barry (ship), one of several vessels named John Barry", "* John Barry, used by Australians as a placeholder name, similar to John Q.

Donen was initially hired to produce, but Grade asked him to complete the film when first-time director Barry was unable to direct. According to Donen \"only a tiny bit of what Barry shot ended up in the finished film.\" It was a critical and financial disaster and initially Donen did not want to be credited as director.

Donen eventually dropped out of the project and David Cronenberg directed the film a few years later.
