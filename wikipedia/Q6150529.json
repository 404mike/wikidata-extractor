Garfield Weston acquired the store and became its chairman following a boardroom coup.

Every hour,  models of William Fortnum and Hugh Mason emerge and bow to each other, with chimes and 18th-century\u2013style music playing in the background. The chimes were incorporated into Jonathan Dove's orchestral adaptation of Zeb Soanes' children's book Gaspard's Foxtrot, which depicts the clock and its figures as illustrated by James Mayhew.  Since Garfield Weston's death in 1978, the store has been run by his granddaughters, Jana Khayat and Kate Weston Hobhouse.
