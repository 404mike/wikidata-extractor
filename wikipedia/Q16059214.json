During  World War II two of his sons, Charles Hastings Pillman and Robert Pillman, joined the 4/7 Royal Dragoon Guards and trained together for D-Day.  Robert was killed six weeks before D-Day when he stood on a landmine while playing golf. Charles Hastings was killed on D-Day after dismounting from his tank, by a shell from HMS Orion. Losing two sons within two months was a tragedy from which Charles and his wife never recovered. \"A Duty to Serve\" Tonbridge School and the 1939\u201345 War pg 71", "Pillman ended his international career, the next year, playing in three matches of the 1914 Five Nations Championship. In the opening game of the tournament against Wales, Pillman and Cambridge wing Cyril Lowe attacked the Welsh backs with sparkling runs, which put the Welsh under constant pressure.Griffiths (1982) p. 143 Pillman then set up a try for Bruno Brown, and followed this with his own try when Wales fumbled the ball near their own line. England won the game 10\u20139. This was followed by victories over Ireland and Scotland giving England their successive Triple Crown titles. Pillman scored his final international points in the win over Ireland, with a try started by a run in their own half from his captain, Ronald Poulton-Palmer.Griffiths (1982) p. 144 Pillman may have played in the final game of the Championship, a win over France, but he suffered a broken leg during the Scotland match.Griffiths (1982) p. 145 His place was taken by his brother, Robert Pillman, who gained his one and only cap in the encounter."]}, {"page": "Robert Lawrence Pillman", "response": ["#REDIRECT Robert Pillman"]}, {"page": "List of international rugby union families", "response": ["*Charles Pillman and Robert Pillman; brothers"]}, {"page": "Pillman", "response": ["*Robert Pillman (1893\u20131916), English rugby union player"]}, {"page": "Pillman, Robert", "response": ["#redirectRobert Pillman"]}]}}
