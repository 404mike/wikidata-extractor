The Nereis Britannica, which was issued in parts, deals mainly with the brown algal seawracks or fuci, and was based on his own researches, discussions with James Edward Smith, comments on proofs by friendsThomas Jenkinson Woodward, Dawson Turner, Dr. Samuel Goodenough, Lilly Wigg, John Pitchford, and Colonel Thomas Velley and the herbaria of Dillenius, Bobart, and Linn\u00e6us. The complete work, which was printed privately and published in folio at Bath, with Latin and English text and twelve coloured plates by the author, appeared as part I in 1795, part II in 1797 and part III in 1801. An enlarged edition, with twenty-four coloured plates, was published at Bath in 1801, in folio; and another at Oxford in 1816, in quarto, with Latin text only and twenty plates. The Illustrationes Theophrasti in usum Botanicorum pr\u00e6cipue peregrinantium, Oxford, 1811, contains a lexicon and three catalogues giving the Linn\u00e6an names of the plants mentioned. The edition of Theophrasti Eresii de Historia Plantarum libri decem, \"perhaps the most unsatisfactory\" ever published (according to Benjamin Daydon Jackson, Guide to the Literature of Botany (1881), p.\u00a022), in 2 vols. 1813 and 1814, contains the Greek text, Latin notes, a glossary and Greek-Latin and Latin-Greek catalogues of the plants. From it Stackhouse reprinted in a separate form De Libanoto, Smyrna, et Balsamo Theophrasti Notiti\u00e6, with prefatory Extracts from James Bruce's Travels in Abyssinia, Bath, 1815."]}, {"page": "Woodwardia", "response": ["Woodwardia was first described by James Edward Smith in 1793. It was named after Thomas Jenkinson Woodward. When broadly circumscribed, the genus contains about 15 species (plus some hybrids). In the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I), the genera Anchistea and Lorinseria (each with one species) are kept separate."]}, {"page": "Myriostoma", "response": ["Myriostoma coliforme is a distinctive species easily characterized by its size\u2014being the largest earthstar fungus\u2014as well as the multiple openings on its spore sack and stalk supporting the sack. Historically, it was thought that the holes might have been a result of insects. This was discussed and rejected by Thomas Jenkinson Woodward in 1797: It has been doubted whether these mouths might not be accidental, and formed by insects after the expansion of the plant. But this (not to mention their regularity, and that each is furrowed by its border of cilia) is clearly disproved, from the marks of the projections formed by the mouths being seen on the expanded rays, when freshly opened ... I have likewise found an abortive plant, in which the seed did not ripen; but which had numerous projecting papillae on the head, where the mouths should have been formed."]}, {"page": "Battarrea phalloides", "response": ["The species was first mentioned in the scientific literature in 1784, when Thomas Jenkinson Woodward described a new species found by Mr. Humphreys of Norwich. It was named by James Dickson in 1785 as Lycoperdon phalloides, and the type locality was Suffolk, England. Christian Hendrik Persoon sanctioned the name when he transferred to Battarrea in his 1801 Synopsis Methodica Fungorum, a newly circumscribed genus named after the Italian mycologist Giovanni Antonio Battarra. Synonyms include Phallus campanulatus, published by Miles Berkeley in 1842 based on collections made by Charles Darwin in Maldonado (Uruguay) in 1833, and Ithyphallus campanulatus, a new combination based on Berkeley's name, published by Diederich Franz Leonhard von Schlechtendal in 1933."]}, {"page": "Woodw.", "response": ["#REDIRECT Thomas Jenkinson Woodward"]}, {"page": "List of botanists by author abbreviation (W\u2013Z)", "response": ["* Woodw. \u2013 Thomas Jenkinson Woodward (1745\u20131820)"]}, {"page": "Woodward (surname)", "response": ["* Thomas Jenkinson Woodward (1745\u20131820), English botanist"]}]}}
