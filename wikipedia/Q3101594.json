He independently from Clemens C. J. Roothaan discovered the Roothaan-Hall equations. He was awarded a Ph.D. degree for this work in 1950 supervised by Sir John Lennard-Jones at Cambridge University. He then lectured at Cambridge University as Assistant in Research in Theoretical chemistry. He was elected to a Fellowship at St John's College, Cambridge in 1953. From 1955 to 1962 he lectured in Mathematics at the Imperial College, London.  In 1957\u201358 he spent a year with Per-Olov L\u00f6wdin in Uppsala, Sweden. He became Professor of Mathematics at the University of Nottingham in 1962. In 1982 he took early retirement from Nottingham University and was appointed an emeritus professor. He  moved in 1983 to Kyoto University, Japan, returning to Nottingham in 1988. He has collaborated with (inter alia) A.T. Amos, K. Collard, and D. Rees. He was Emeritus Professor and Senior Research Fellow in the Shell Centre for Mathematical Education at the University of Nottingham. He has a Sc. D. degree from Cambridge University and an Honorary D. Eng. degree from Kyoto University.\nHe was a member of the International Academy of Quantum Molecular Science.\nHe received an honorary DSc from the National University of Ireland at Maynooth.\nHe had three children and six grandchildren. He died peacefully in Nottingham at the age of 93 on 6 May 2018.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Hall", "response": ["* George G.
