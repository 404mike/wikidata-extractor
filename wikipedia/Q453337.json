He started his career in 1964 at Blackpool before moving to Liverpool in 1967. He made 665 appearances for Liverpool, and captained the side to four league titles and an FA Cup victory in the 1970s. Added to these domestic honours were two European Cups, including Liverpool's first in 1977; and two UEFA Cup titles. Hughes won the Football Writers' Player of the Year in 1977. Hughes completed a full set of English football domestic honours by winning the League Cup with Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1980. In addition to Wolves, he later played for Rotherham United, Hull City, Mansfield Town and Swansea City. Hughes earned 62 caps for the England national team, which he also captained.After retiring from football he worked as a media personality, mainly with the BBC. He was made an OBE in 1980 for his services to sport. Hughes died of a brain tumour, aged 57, in 2004.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 28", "response": ["*1947 \u2013 Emlyn Hughes, English footballer (d. 2004)"]}, {"page": "Liverpool F.C.", "response": ["| Emlyn Hughes || 1973\u20131978"]}, {"page": "November 9", "response": ["*  2004   \u2013 Emlyn Hughes, English footballer and manager (b. 1947)"]}, {"page": "1947", "response": ["** Emlyn Hughes, English footballer (d. 2004) "]}, {"page": "2004", "response": ["** Emlyn Hughes, English footballer and TV personality (b. 1947)"]}, {"page": "Peter Osgood", "response": ["A broken leg suffered in a challenge by Blackpool's Emlyn Hughes in the League Cup on 5 October 1966 seriously curtailed his progress, and he missed Chelsea's first-ever Wembley FA Cup final on 20 May 1967.

Shankly recognised the potential of Blackpool teenager Emlyn Hughes, a future England captain, and signed him for \u00a365,000 in February 1967. Liverpool's performance in the 1966\u201367 European Cup was poor and, after struggling to overcome FC Petrolul Ploie\u0219ti in the first round, they were well beaten in the last 16 by Ajax Amsterdam, inspired by 19-year-old Johan Cruyff.Shankly, p. 107. Ajax won 7\u20133 on aggregate after defeating Liverpool 5\u20131 in Amsterdam. Several years later, in his autobiography, Shankly still complained that the match in Amsterdam should never have started because of fog and, although Liverpool lost 5\u20131, he still thought Liverpool would win the tie at Anfield. Although Shankly claimed to have been unworried about the Ajax defeat, he acknowledged that he was examining the team and planning ahead.Shankly, p. 108. The Liverpool site argues that Shankly was mistaken in his decision at this time to postpone team rebuilding.", "The only long-term success that Shankly had in the transfer market in the late 1960s was his signing of Emlyn Hughes, who went on to captain Liverpool to victory in the European Cup. Otherwise, he did not significantly change the team until the 1969\u201370 season when Liverpool finished fifth in the league championship, a long way behind the winners, their local rivals Everton. Shankly was characteristically defiant whenever Everton got the better of Liverpool and, although he liked and respected everyone connected with Everton, would always talk up Liverpool at Everton's expense. Typical of this was his joke about the city having two great football teams \u2013 Liverpool and Liverpool reserves.", "In the 1969\u201370 FA Cup quarter final, Liverpool played against struggling Second Division side Watford at Vicarage Road and lost 1\u20130 after a very poor performance. The Liverpool site records that the defeat signalled the end for St John, Hunt, Byrne, Yeats and Lawrence; the incomers included Ray Clemence, Alec Lindsay, Larry Lloyd, John Toshack, Brian Hall and Steve Heighway. Apart from Hall who graduated through the reserves, they were all signed from clubs in lower divisions or even, in the case of Heighway, from non-league football.Shankly, pp. 115\u2013117. Adding the new players to Tommy Smith, Ian Callaghan, Chris Lawler and Emlyn Hughes, Shankly formed the nucleus of a second great team which went on to dominate English and European football in the 1970s."]}, {"page": "Dore, South Yorkshire", "response": ["Former England footballer and Captain, the late Emlyn Hughes, lived in the village."]}, {"page": "Barrow-in-Furness", "response": ["Football players born in Barrow include England internationals Emlyn Hughes and Gary Stevens, as well as Harry Hadley, and Vic Metcalfe."]}, {"page": "Rotherham United F.C.", "response": ["|Emlyn Hughes"]}]}}
