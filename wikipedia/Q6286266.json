Pitt envisaged Pittville as a new spa town, one which would rival the existing fashionable quarters of Cheltenham. Development began in 1824-5. Pitt employed the architect John Forbes, who designed the basic layout of the estate, and most importantly the Pittville Pump Room, which opened on 20 July 1830, and the landscape gardener Richard Ware, who laid out the gardens (now Pittville Park).

Pittville Park provides 33ha (82 acres) of parkland, including an ornamental lake with elegant bridges dating from 1827 and a boating lake, formerly known as Capper's Fish Pond.

His family's good financial standing no doubt also enabled him to purchase the Park estate in Cheltenham in 1839, and to develop it in the tradition of speculators such as Pearson Thompson and Joseph Pitt. Daukes was a convinced eclecticist, working in all the styles that were fashionable in his day. He was an admirer of Pugin and a long-term member of the Ecclesiological Society, although a low churchman and not wholly in sympathy with the ecclesiological movement, as he designed churches in the neo-Norman and Perpendicular styles. He was able to use these styles and also the Italianate of Abberley Hall, Witley Court and Colney Hatch, with considerable originality and dash, and he comes across as an architect full of self-confidence, with a secure command of the Picturesque elements of a composition. He failed, however, to adapt to the changing stylistic climate of the High Victorian period, and in the 1860s his practice seems to have declined, although he was still building churches in the Midlands."]}, {"page": "John Forbes (architect)", "response": ["He designed the Pittville Pump Room for Joseph Pitt (1825-1830) and St Paul's Church (1829-1831).

Admitted to full studentship in June 1830, he was awarded a silver medal that year.
