She travelled on the Nascopie to meet him and join in his work surveying the Arctic and studying local flora and fauna. The two travelled by boat to remote areas, and made camp on land for the winter. They used dogsleds to explore the surrounding area. Manning learned to craft warm clothes and live independently in the Arctic without relying on local guides. During her time in the Arctic, Manning also helped to collect botanical samples with Dr. Nicholas Polunin. She returned to Ottawa during the Second World War. ", "In approximately 1935, she briefly met Thomas Henry Manning. She received a telegram from him in 1938, inviting her to leave her post in Montreal and join him exploring the Arctic. They were married upon her arrival. They separated amicably in the 1960s though they were never divorced."]}]}}
