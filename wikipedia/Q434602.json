Kirk Douglas convinced Andress to take the part at a party hosted by Derek. To appear more convincing as a Jamaican, Andress had a tan painted on her and ultimately had her lines redubbed by voice actress Nikki van der Zyl due to Andress' heavy Swiss-German accent. For Bond's antagonist Dr. No, Ian Fleming wanted his friend No\u00ebl Coward, and Coward answered the invitation with \"No! No! No!\" Fleming considered that his step-cousin, Christopher Lee, would be good for the role of Dr. No, although, by the time Fleming told the producers, they had already chosen Joseph Wiseman for the part. Harry Saltzman picked Wiseman because of his performance in the 1951 film Detective Story, and the actor had special make-up applied to evoke No's Chinese heritage.
