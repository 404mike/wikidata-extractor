Hailing from Canvey Island, Essex, the group are best known for early singles such as \"She Does It Right\", \"Roxette\", \"Back in the Night\" and \"Milk and Alcohol\". The group's original distinctively British R&B sound was centred on Wilko Johnson's choppy guitar style. Along with Johnson, the original band line-up included singer Lee Brilleaux and the rhythm section of John B. Sparks, known as \"Sparko\", on bass guitarThe spelling is Sparks on all the album credits, but is spelt Sparkes in a few references, and he is also known as \"Sparko\". and John Martin, known as \"The Big Figure\", on drums.

With Mayo, the band was never as popular as with Johnson but still enjoyed their only Top Ten hit single in 1979, with \"Milk and Alcohol\". Johnson never achieved any great success outside the band, apart from a brief spell with Ian Dury and The Blockheads from 1980. Fans always speculated about a return by Johnson that never occurred.", "Every year after Brilleaux's death, a special concert known as the Lee Brilleaux Birthday Memorial was held on Canvey Island, where former and current Feelgoods celebrated the music of Dr. Feelgood, and raised money for The Fair Havens Hospice in Westcliff-on-Sea. Fans attended from all over the globe, and the 20th and final event was held on 9 May 2014.
