He was the grandson of Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton, a British MP and social reformer, and the son of Sir Edward North Buxton, also an MP.\nHe attended Harrow School and Trinity College, Cambridge. He was commissioned captain in the Tower Hamlets Rifle Volunteers (No. 3) on 4 May 1860. He married Lady Victoria Noel, daughter of Charles Noel, 1st Earl of Gainsborough, and Lady Frances Jocelyn, daughter of Robert Jocelyn, 3rd Earl of Roden on 12 June 1862.  Of their 13 children, ten survived infancy:\n\nSir Sir Thomas Buxton, 4th Baronet (8 Apr 1865 \u2013 31 May 1919)\n\nEdith Frances Buxton (30 Aug 1867 \u2013 25 Mar 1930)\n\nNoel Edward Noel-Buxton, 1st Baron Noel-Buxton (9 Jan 1869 \u2013 12 Sep 1948)\n\nMary Catherine Buxton (29 Jul 1870 \u2013 6 Jan 1960)\n\nConstance Victoria Buxton (5 Jun 1872 \u2013 22 Sep 1957)\n\nVictoria Alexandrina Buxton (5 Jan 1874 \u2013 30 May 1953)\n\nCharles Roden Buxton (27 Nov 1875 \u2013 16 Dec 1942)\n\nMabel Frances Evelyn Buxton (29 Jan 1878 \u2013 25 Oct 1966)\n\nRt.

After his defeat, he stood again for Parliament unsuccessfully on several other occasions: in Westminster at the 1874 general election, in Western Essex at the 1880 general election and at the by-elections in Northern Norfolk in 1876 and 1879. He was appointed High Sheriff of Norfolk in 1876.\nWhen Buxton was appointed governor, the Premier of South Australia, Charles Kingston was angry that the South Australian government had not been involved in the decision about who should be the new governor, so made life as hard as possible for Buxton and his family. The governor's allowance was reduced and customs duty was charged on their household items (including his wife's invalid carriage). Buxton took up the job anyway, and later was described as the most genial, sociable and common-sense governor, due to his gentle and unassuming friendliness. He visited gaols and hospitals, and showed genuine interest in Aboriginal culture during his time as governor. He eventually returned to England due to the ill-health of his wife.A memorial to Sir Fowell and his wife Victoria was erected in St Thomas' Church in Upshire in Essex in 1917, designed by Sir Robert Lorimer.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alfred Waterhouse", "response": ["Easneye Park (1866) near Stanstead Abbotts, Hertfordshire, was a country house built for Thomas Fowell Buxton, a large red brick in early Tudor style, with typical diaper work and terracotta decoration with crow-stepped gable and tiled roof the chimneys are base on those at Hampton Court Palace.
