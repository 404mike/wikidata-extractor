He served a single term in Parliament as a Conservative Party Member of Parliament (MP), but never contributed to any debate. He was a member of Lancashire County Council for nearly twenty years. His Military and political career came to a premature end when his colourful private life brought about a court judgment against him and resulted in his bankruptcy.\nHe was the last proprietor of Roanhead mines, which he managed from 1914 until they were worked out in July 1942.", "link_mentions": {}}}
