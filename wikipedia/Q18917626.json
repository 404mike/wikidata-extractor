A few years later Stroud District Council tried to demolish 18th-century buildings in the town centre. Stroud High Street Action Group, with some rooftop protests and a high court judgement, demonstrated against this. The restored buildings are now a feature of the High Street. After a short occupation a compromise was reached in the demolition of buildings in Cornhill with many being saved, including one identified as a medieval house. This campaign led to the formation of the Stroud Preservation Trust. which has been instrumental in saving many of the town's oldest buildings such as Withey's house, the Brunel Goods Shed and the Hill Paul building."]}, {"page": "Melksham", "response": ["*Julia de Lacy Mann (1891\u20131985), economic historian, principal of St Hilda's, Oxford; retired to Melksham, was president of the West Wilshire Historical Society"]}, {"page": "List of Somerville College, Oxford, people", "response": ["*Julia de Lacy Mann (1891\u20131985), economic historian and Principal of St Hilda's College, Oxford", "*Julia de Lacy Mann (1891\u20131985), economic historian and Principal of St Hilda's College, Oxford"]}]}}
