He went to the Hugh Christie School in Tonbridge, Kent. He won the Brabazon Trophy in 1981.\nWay turned professional in 1982 and quickly found success on the European Tour, winning that year's KLM Dutch Open.\nFor a few years, Way was one of Europe's most promising young golfers, and he represented Europe in the Ryder Cup in 1983, when he became the second youngest Ryder Cup player up to that time after Nick Faldo, and again in 1985, when Europe captured the trophy which had been in American hands for twenty-eight years. He had an outstanding Ryder Cup record of six wins, two losses and one halved match.\nWay did not sustain his early success. His last top 100 finish on the Order of Merit was in 1993 and after 1997 he played little tournament golf. He began playing on the European Senior Tour after turning 50 in March 2013.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "March 12", "response": ["*  1963   \u2013 Paul Way, English golfer"]}, {"page": "Bernhard Langer", "response": ["| Paul Way"]}, {"page": "Nick Faldo", "response": ["| Warren Humphreys,  Brian Waites, Paul Way"]}, {"page": "Sandy Lyle", "response": ["| Paul Way"]}, {"page": "BMW PGA Championship", "response": ["| 1985 || Paul Way|| align=\"center\" |282 || align=center|\u22126 || Playoff ||  Sandy Lyle ||Wentworth Club|| align=\"center\" |42,000"]}, {"page": "World Cup (men's golf)", "response": ["|1985||||Dave Barr and Dan Halldorson||La Quinta, California, United States|| \u2013 Howard Clark and Paul Way"]}, {"page": "European Open (golf)", "response": ["| 1987 ||  Paul Way || align=center|279 || align=center|\u22129 || 2 strokes ||  John Bland Gordon Brand Jnr || Walton Heath"]}, {"page": "Dutch Open (golf)", "response": ["| 1982 ||  Paul Way || align=center|276 || align=center|\u221212 || 2 strokes ||  David Feherty Vicente Fern\u00e1ndez || De Pan"]}, {"page": "Jacques L\u00e9glise Trophy", "response": ["*1980 Alan Currie, David Curry, Andrew Glen, Ronald Gregan, Michael McLean, G Miller, Mark Roe, Paul Way"]}, {"page": "Tunisian Open", "response": ["| 1985 ||  Stephen Bennett || align=center|285 || align=center|\u22123 || Playoff ||  Paul Way"]}, {"page": "Stephen Bennett (golfer)", "response": ["| Paul Way", "| Paul Way"]}, {"page": "Lawrence Batley International", "response": ["| 1983 ||  Nick Faldo || align=center|266 || align=center|\u221218 || 4 strokes ||  Warren Humphreys Brian Waites Paul Way"]}, {"page": "Tournament Players Championship (United Kingdom)", "response": ["| 1983 ||  Bernhard Langer || align=center|269 || align=center|\u221211 || |2 strokes ||  Paul Way || align=center|13,330 || St. Mellion"]}]}}
