The Bermuda delegation held several meetings with the most senior officials in the U.S. Government including the President, Vice-President, Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary of State and National Security Advisor in order to successfully implement a tax treaty between Bermuda and the United States.

However, an independence referendum called by a sharply divided UBP in the summer of 1995 was resoundingly defeated and resulted in the resignation of the Premier and UBP leader, Sir John Swan. Just over 58% of the electorate voted in the independence referendum, which had to be postponed one day due to disruptions caused by Hurricane Felix in 1995. Of those voting, over 73% voted against independence, while only 25% voted in favour. The vote may not have been a true test of support for independence, however, as the Progressive Labour Party (PLP) urged its membership and supporters to boycott the referendum. The PLP stated that the unwillingness of the UBP government to put forward a plan of substantive constitutional reform made it impossible for it to support the referendum."]}, {"page": "John William David Swan", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Swan (Bermudian politician)"]}, {"page": "John W.

In 1990, she enforced a ban on fishpots in Bermuda, despite widespread opposition from the island's fishing and political sectors. The ban was highly controversial, but Bermuda's fishing stocks were collapsing at the time. At the time, there were 1,400 licensed fishpots in Bermuda, but many fisherman illegally set double or triple the number of fishpots that they were licensed to use. The illegal fishing led to overfishing and a depletion of fish populations around the coral reefs. The fishpot ban initially hurt the domestic fishing industry during the mid-1990s.
