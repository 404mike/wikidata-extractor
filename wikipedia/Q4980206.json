Fox explained that upon Nancy discovering that Kris and Ravi have been having a relationship she thought she would \"be flying in there, fists flailing, but this has completely stumped her. For the first time ever, Nancy has nothing to say. She just bolts\". She added that Nancy is \"speechless\" which is different for her as \"she's always got a comeback for everyone, but in this case she just doesn't do anything\". Fox said that Nancy has \"no right\" to be angry with Kris and Ravi as they have all been having sex with each other without the other knowing. Nancy, Kris and Ravi decide to carry on having relationships with each other with each other's consent, Fox was shocked when she learned of this development, saying: \"No words could describe how I felt when I read it for the first time!\" The actress revealed that Hollyoaks' time slot restricted the characters having a threesome so instead the characters having an open three-way relationship was introduced. Fox explained that when Nancy begins the three-way relationship she soon realises she is not comfortable with it so she decides to end the relationship. She added Nancy wants a relationship with \"someone who'll love and look after her. Deep down, she wants that security which a conventional relationship brings as she hasn't had that for so long\"."]}, {"page": "Ben Mitchell (EastEnders)", "response": ["In May 2010, it was announced that Ben would be written out of EastEnders as part of the show's revamp by executive producer Bryan Kirkwood.

I know I will shed a few tears on the day I leave but I am so excited about what the future holds.\" Hollyoaks series producer Bryan Kirkwood commented on her departure, stating: \"As well as being the nation's sexiest soap star for two years running, Roxanne has worked incredibly hard to prove herself as a talented actress.

To facilitate the departure, Bianca will feature in a major storyline, which executive producer Bryan Kirkwood said was the only possible reason Bianca would have for leaving her family. In December 2010, it was announced that Natalie Cassidy would return as part of Bianca's departure storyline which started in January 2011. Bianca's departure was broadcast on 21 January 2011. Palmer gave birth earlier than expected, meaning that she started leave three weeks before she planned to. Key moments were therefore not filmed, and changes had to be made to the storyline to accommodate her absence. Bianca reappeared from December 2011, though Palmer stated in February 2011 that she was in no hurry to return, did not miss it and did not know when she would be back. On 19 July 2011, Palmer revealed that she had signed a new 'working mums' contract and would be returning before the end of the year."]}, {"page": "Blossom Jackson", "response": ["Following producer Bryan Kirkwood's decision to kill off Blossom's great grandson Billie Jackson (Devon Anderson), Hammond was asked to reprise the role of Blossom for a brief stint.

It will be great to see some familiar faces and work alongside old friends again.\" Executive producer Bryan Kirkwood commented \"Lucy's character Lisa was responsible for one of the biggest cliffhanger episodes in EastEnders, so it's a real treat to have her back on screen,\" while a spokesperson for the show added \"Lisa Fowler was a major part of Phil's life\u00a0\u2013 she knows him as well as anyone, so she won't be happy about him looking after his daughter.

Discussing her brief return, Benjamin said, \"What I liked about doing this storyline was that it did explain where Lisa had been. When I was watching it, I was thinking 'Where's her mother? Where is Lisa? It's just ridiculous'. But it does make sense. She is mentally unstable and she does have times like that and the little girl is old enough to make her own decisions and say, 'I want to live with my dad now'. So she had to let her go.
