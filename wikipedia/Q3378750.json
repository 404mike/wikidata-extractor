In the Doctor's absence Rose relies on her observations of him and tries to mimic his actions. Collinson felt it was important to resolve any mistrust between the pair by the end of the Christmas Special, as the public had responded well to Rose and the Doctor's friendship previously. Davies had scripted dialogue in \"The Christmas Invasion\" explaining the newly regenerated Doctor's estuary English accent by stating he had imprinted on Rose and adopted her way of speaking. However, due to time constraints this sequence was not filmed. Discussing how Rose had developed by the second series, Piper described her as having \"come on in leaps and bounds\" and stated she is now \"a lot more proactive.\" She felt that there is a \"different kind of energy\" between Rose and the Tenth Doctor, whilst Tennant remarked that the audience would get to see the Doctor-companion relationship \"developing and becoming something that it maybe hasn't before.\" Piper stated that with the Tenth Doctor, Rose is \"more tetchy and more possessive\" over him as \"she feels like she's lost him once and doesn't want to lose him again\". She cited Rose's \"catfight\" with former companion Sarah Jane Smith in \"School Reunion\" as evidence of this. Discussing the possibility of Rose and the Tenth Doctor becoming more romantically involved Piper stated \"You want it to happen, but at the same time you don't want it to happen\". Tennant likened the dynamic between the pair to that of Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) in The X-Files. Both Tennant and Piper agreed that the expectation of the relationship is more exciting than having it realised. To add to the tragedy of their separation, Davies scripted the series two story arc so that Rose and the Doctor would be indirectly responsible for their separation. \"It's deliberate when that happens [the Doctor and Rose's arrogance]\", said Davies, \"and they do pay the price.

Davies wanted the storyline to be easy to follow and drawn from human emotions. Additionally, the previous seven episodes had established why Rose was a good companion, and so \"Father's Day\" shows that she does make mistakes, but in a relatable way. Davies chose Paul Cornell to write the episode; Cornell had written Doctor Who spin-off material, especially in novels for the Virgin New Adventures, which bridged the gap between the classic series and the new. Davies originally intended that the episode be a small budget-saver character piece investigating the death of Rose's father, but Cornell suggested the addition of the Reapers and BBC Head of Drama Jane Tranter encouraged the additions of monsters to the new series. Working titles for the episode included \"Wounded Time\" and \"Wound in Time\".", "When time is damaged, one of the effects is that mobile telephones all begin to repeat the message, \"Watson, come here, I need you,\" purportedly Alexander Graham Bell's first words ever spoken over a telephone. However, historical records indicate the words to be \"Watson, come here, I want you.\" The error was not present in Paul Cornell's original script, but crept in at some point during production.

In the episode after assuming responsibility for the destructive time paradox, Pete assures Rose \"I'm your dad, it's my job for it to be my fault\".
