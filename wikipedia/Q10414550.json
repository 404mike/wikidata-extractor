The first-round Staffordshire Cup-tie at Wolverhampton Wanderers was drawn, the home goalkeeper saving a penalty. Playing with a vocal crowd of 5,000 spectators and a strong wind behind them, Small Heath's first two goals against Newton Heath were disallowed, both for offside, before they conceded against the run of play, but they then took advantage of the conditions to score three times before half-time, through Abbott, Walton and Robertson. Against the wind, they changed their style of play: \"they no longer indulged in short passing, but in long kicking and rushing\", the defence, particularly Billy Pratt stood firm, and Inglis made the final score 4\u20131.\"Small Heath v.

They scored more goals than any other team in the division except Manchester City, and scored more at home than any other, but their away record was poor.
