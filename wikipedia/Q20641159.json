Later that year, Woodburn was sent off for retaliation in a match with Stirling Albion. The clubs met again the following season in a League Cup tie at Ibrox on 28 August 1954. Playing with a knee injury, Woodburn took exception to a bad foul and retaliated by headbutting a Stirling player. The Scottish Football Association convened a disciplinary hearing the following month, which lasted just four minutes, and Woodburn was suspended sine die. The England international Tom Finney, one of many well-known forwards Woodburn had encountered in his international career, described the ban as \"a grave injustice\". The SFA revoked their punishment three years later, but by then Woodburn was 37 and his playing career was over."]}, {"page": "1938\u201339 Scottish Cup", "response": ["|CF |||| Davie Mathie"]}, {"page": "1944\u201345 Southern League Cup (Scotland)", "response": ["|CF  ||||Davie Mathie"]}, {"page": "Mathie", "response": ["*Davie Mathie (1919\u20131954), Scottish football player"]}]}}
