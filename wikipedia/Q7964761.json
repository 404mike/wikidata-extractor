He was elected to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom in 1918, and besides an interval of months in 1923\u201324, remained in parliament until his death. His Cabinet roles were as the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in the National Government (1931\u20131935) of Ramsay MacDonald; as the Secretary of State for Scotland in the National Government (1935\u20131937) of Stanley Baldwin; and as Minister of Health in Neville Chamberlain's National Government (1937\u20131939) and the short-lived Chamberlain war ministry.\nWhile in medical training at university he was President of the Glasgow University Union and served in the First World War, winning the Military Cross on two occasions. In the course of his career he was Member of Parliament for the constituencies of Lanark, Glasgow Kelvingrove, and Combined Scottish Universities. He was also Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, Rector of the University of Aberdeen, and Rector of the University of Glasgow.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Stanley Baldwin", "response": ["* Walter Elliot \u2013 Minister of Agriculture", "* October 1936 \u2013 Walter Elliot succeeded Collins as Scottish Secretary.

He was a signatory to the April 1919 Lowther Petition calling for harsher peace terms against Germany in the Treaty of Versailles then being negotiated. In the 1918\u20131922 Parliament, Wood was an ally of Samuel Hoare, Philip Lloyd-Greame and Walter Elliot, all ambitious younger MPs in favour of progressive reform.", "By this time, Halifax was becoming increasingly influential in foreign affairs. Cabinet met on the morning of 18 December 1935 to discuss the public outcry over the Hoare\u2013Laval Pact. Halifax, who was due to make a statement in the Lords that afternoon, insisted that the Foreign Secretary Samuel Hoare must resign to save the government's position, causing J. H. Thomas, William Ormsby-Gore and Walter Elliott also to come out for his resignation. Anthony Eden was appointed Foreign Secretary in Hoare's place.Roberts 1991, pp. 78\u201379. The following year, Halifax said the provisions of the Pact \"were not so frightfully different from those put forward by the Committee of Five [of the League]. But the latter were of respectable parentage: and the Paris ones were too much like the off-the-stage arrangements of nineteenth-century diplomacy\".Keith Feiling, A Life of Neville Chamberlain (London: Macmillan, 1970), p. 275."]}, {"page": "Secretary of State for Scotland", "response": ["| rowspan=2 | The Right HonourableDr Walter ElliotMC FRS FRSEMP for Glasgow Kelvingrove(1888\u20131958)"]}, {"page": "Secretary of State for Health and Social Care", "response": ["| Dr Walter Elliot"]}, {"page": "Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food", "response": ["| rowspan=2 | The Right HonourableWalter ElliotMC FRSEMP for Glasgow Kelvingrove(1888\u20131958)"]}]}}
