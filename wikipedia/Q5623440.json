She also organised women-only climbing courses, together with the noted climber and feminist Jill Lawrence. She was only the second woman to qualify, in the 1960s, as a British Mountain Guide (after Gwen Moffat), and was the first woman to hold the badge of the UIAGM as an international mountain guide.The Independent: \"Brede Arkless. Eyebrow-raising mountain guide\" by Stephen Goodwin, 10 April 2006; last accessed 29 December 2009. Increasingly involved in all-women climbing and guiding, she eventually separated from her husband, moved to New Zealand in September 1990 and became a New Zealand citizen in 1995.
