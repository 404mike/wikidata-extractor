In the event storms pushed her south and having been driven past Barbados she eventually touched land in Dominica on 23 January 1953. After an extended stopover in the Caribbean she sailed north to Florida and finally to New York by way of the Intracoastal Waterway.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1952", "response": ["* May 18 \u2013 Ann Davison becomes the first woman to single-handedly sail the Atlantic Ocean."]}, {"page": "Rosie Swale-Pope", "response": ["In 1983, Rosie Swale sailed solo across the Atlantic in a small  cutter, which she had found in a cowshed in Wales and named Fiesta Girl.
