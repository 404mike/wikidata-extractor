Retrieved 11 December 2016. The Barnard family moved to local property Coomooboolaroo, south of Duaringa, in 1873.  The patriarch of the family, George Barnard, built a collection of insect and bird eggs and specialised in moths, butterflies and beetles. George's wife Maria was an artist who drew specimens.  George's collection grew so large that a private museum was built on the cattle station.  Upon his death, George Barnard's collection was acquired by Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild's Natural History Museum at Tring but his children continued similar work, making names for themselves with their own achievements. The Barnard property hosted many internationally renowned naturalists and zoologists including Albert Stewart Meek, and Carl Sofus Lumholtz.  Charles and Harry Barnard both served as chairmen on the Duaringa Divisional Board at various times."]}, {"page": "Albert S.

It is believed to have been a terrestrial species that laid a single egg in an unlined depression in the ground. It roosted in pairs or small groups of three or four in small shrubs and was reportedly very tame, allowing hunters to pick it up off its roost. The Choiseul pigeon lived in lowland forests, particularly in coastal swampy areas that lacked mangroves. It was only recorded by Albert Stewart Meek, who collected six adults and an egg from the northern part of the island in 1904. Despite many subsequent searches, the bird has not been definitively reported since. It is believed to have been rare when Meek collected his specimens. The indigenous peoples reported that the species was driven to extinction due to the introduction of cats, as the pigeon had never previously confronted a carnivorous mammal on Choiseul. The last unconfirmed report of a Choiseul pigeon was in the early 1940s, and the species is considered extinct.", "The Choiseul pigeon was described by Walter Rothschild in 1904 on the basis of six skins\u2014three male and three female\u2014and an egg collected by Albert Stewart Meek earlier that year. It was placed in the monotypic genus Microgoura, whose name comes from the Ancient Greek word mikros \"small\", and goura, a New Guinean aboriginal name for the similarly-crested crowned pigeons of the genus Goura. Rothschild named the species after Meek, giving the bird the specific name meeki. Though its relationships are unclear, the Choiseul pigeon is believed to have been closest to the thick-billed ground pigeon (Trugon terrestris) from Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, which has similar plumage. It has been suggested that the Choiseul pigeon was a link between the thick-billed ground pigeon and the crowned pigeons; however, other sources argue that it may not have been closely related to the crowned pigeons as its crest was quite different. Based on behavioural and morphological evidence, Jolyon C. Parish proposed that the Choiseul pigeon should be placed in the Gourinae subfamily along with the Goura pigeons, the dodo, the Rodrigues solitaire, and others. The Choiseul pigeon has no known subspecies.", "In January 1904 six specimens and an egg were collected by Albert Stewart Meek, a bird collector for Lord Walter Rothschild, near Choiseul Bay on Choiseul. Several local boys told Meek that the pigeon was also present on the nearby islands of Santa Isabel and Malaita. Though Meek did not travel to these islands, he did search for the Choiseul pigeon on the adjacent Bougainville Island, but did not find any evidence of its presence. No other specimens were ever collected or seen by Western scientists."]}, {"page": "Ornithoptera meridionalis", "response": ["O. meridionalis was first collected by Albert Stewart Meek near Samarai, Milne Bay Province, Papua New Guinea.
