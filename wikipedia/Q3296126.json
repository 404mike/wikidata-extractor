Later, \"The System of Lunar Craters, quadrants I, II, III, IV\" was published, under the direction of Gerard P. Kuiper. These works were adopted by the IAU and became the recognized sources for lunar nomenclature."]}, {"page": "Blagg (crater)", "response": ["Blagg is a tiny lunar impact crater located on the Sinus Medii.
