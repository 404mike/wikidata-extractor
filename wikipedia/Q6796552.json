A medieval king could not be expected to work towards some future ideal of a parliamentary monarchy as if it were good in itself; rather, his role was a pragmatic one \u2013 to maintain order and solve problems as they arose. At this, Edward excelled.McKisack (1960), pp. 4\u20135. Edward had also been accused of endowing his younger sons too liberally and thereby promoting dynastic strife culminating in the Wars of the Roses. This claim was rejected by K.B. McFarlane, who argued that this was not only the common policy of the age, but also the best. Later biographers of the king such as Mark Ormrod and Ian Mortimer have followed this historiographical trend. The older negative view has not completely disappeared; as recently as 2001, Norman Cantor described Edward as an \"avaricious and sadistic thug\" and a \"destructive and merciless force\"."]}, {"page": "Peasants' Revolt", "response": ["Interpretations of the revolt have changed over the years. 17th-century historians, such as John Smyth, established the idea that the revolt had marked the end of unfree labour and serfdom in England. 19th-century historians such as William Stubbs and Thorold Rogers reinforced this conclusion, Stubbs describing it as \"one of the most portentous events in the whole of our history\". In the 20th century, this interpretation was increasingly challenged by historians such as May McKisack, Michael Postan and Richard Dobson, who revised the impact of the revolt on further political and economic events in England. Mid-20th century Marxist historians were both interested in, and generally sympathetic to, the rebel cause, a trend culminating in Hilton's 1973 account of the uprising, set against the wider context of peasant revolts across Europe during the period.; ; ;  The Peasants' Revolt has received more academic attention than any other medieval revolt, and this research has been interdisciplinary, involving historians, literary scholars and international collaboration."]}, {"page": "William Stubbs", "response": ["In the main Stubbs' ideas of a confrontational political framework have been superseded by K. B. McFarlane's \"community of interest\" theory; the idea that the amount of possible conflict between a king and his nobles was actually very small (case in point, Henry IV, 1399\u20131413). Historians like Michael Hicks, Rosemary Horrox and notably May McKisack, have pushed this view further."]}, {"page": "Oxford History of England", "response": ["*Volume V: The Fourteenth Century, 1307\u20131399 \u2014 May McKisack (1959)"]}, {"page": "Wonderful Parliament", "response": ["The opening\u2014and for the King, most important\u2014business on the parliamentary agenda was a subsidy of four fifteenths and two tenths\u2014the then massive sum of about \u00a3155,000. \"Never before had such a sum been demanded, and it was this that precipitated Suffolk's fall. There was an immediate\u2014and concerted\u2014assault by the Commons and the Lords, who were of \"with one mind\" and \"complaining grievously.\" The Commons represented public opinion (which, explains May McKisack, \"demanded a scapegoat\") and with the Lords (composed of such powerful men as the Earls of Warwick and Arundel, the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishops of Winchester and Exeter), would have, it has been said, \"presented a formidable opposition to a boy of nineteen,\" as the King was. The precise political manoeuvrings of the various parties are now obscured, but no royal business was transacted. At some point the discussions moved from the question of tax to that of the King's Chancellor. However it came about, it certainly resulted in the King making a spirited defence of his right to choose his own ministers and the royal prerogative. The Commons also demanded that the King appoint his councillors in parliament."]}, {"page": "English nationalism", "response": ["The Hundred Years' War with France (1337\u20131453) aroused English nationalist feeling.Hastings, p. 47.
