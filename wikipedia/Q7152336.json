The three founder members were Paul McDowell (who originally played trombone), Philip Harrison (who originally played banjo) and Brian Innes (drums). Gradually the band evolved into a nine-piece ensemble with a light-hearted and humorous performing style, although they were all serious musicians. The name \"Temperance Seven\" was suggested by Douggie Gray, of the Alberts fame. The Alberts were cult figures in the art scene in the mid 1950s and were forerunners of the sort of humour that became Monty Python. (This was not the band's only link with Monty Python; see below). The Temperance Seven was a subtle play on words \u2013 the number seven being \"one under the eight\". That there were nine members or \"one over the eight\" implied intemperance.", "Before the band became known nationally, Paul McDowell had also been a member of the Experimental Theatre Club revue, with Ian Davidson, Robin Grove-White and Doug Fisher. At the time, they had been performing their show, called \"****\" (Four Asterisks), at the Edinburgh Fringe, but after the runaway success of \"You're Driving Me Crazy\", McDowell had to quit the group to tour with his band. This prompted Davidson to look for a replacement, and he found Terry Jones, future Monty Python member, who thus obtained his first chance to be part of the revue.", "* \"Whispering\" Paul McDowell (trombone, vocal refrains)", "===Paul McDowell solo single==="]}, {"page": "A Royal Flush", "response": ["| Paul McDowell"]}, {"page": "List of The Good Life episodes", "response": ["| style=\"font-size: 100%;\" |After Tom barters for a range from the rag and bone man Sam (Tony Selby), Barbara is left to clean all the rust off it, while Tom tries to invent something to scare the birds.
