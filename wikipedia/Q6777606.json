He played midfield and was considered one of the brightest prospects that the QPR youth team had produced for many years. He began establishing himself in the first team towards the end of the 1971\u201372 season when he started the last fourteen matches. The 1972\u201373 season again saw him start every game until catastrophe struck in a game against Fulham at Craven Cottage in October. He suffered an extremely badly broken leg and it was thought at the time to be career-ending. After the best part of eighteen months out of the game he did return to play but was never quite the same player and remained only a fringe player until he moved to Portsmouth on loan for a spell in 1976. At the end of that season he was transferred to Notts County before rejoining Rangers in September 1977.\nHe went on to play 146 league games for Rangers scoring 17 league goals in his 2 spells with the club. He retired in 1981 following an injury. He is the younger brother of former Fulham striker Viv Busby.\nHe had a brief spell as joint manager of Maidenhead United with Alan Devonshire from June 1996 to March 1997.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Viv Busby", "response": ["He is the older brother of former Queens Park Rangers midfielder Martyn Busby."]}, {"page": "Mike Keen", "response": ["Keen ran two sports shops in High Wycombe.
