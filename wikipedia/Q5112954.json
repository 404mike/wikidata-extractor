His maternal grandmother Barbara Pryde (n\u00e9e Lauder) was a niece of the famous artist brothers Robert Scott Lauder and James Eckford Lauder. The family moved to London in 1896. Nicholson was educated at Tyttenhangar Lodge Preparatory School, Seaford, at Heddon Court, Hampstead and then as a boarder at Gresham's School, Holt, Norfolk.  He trained as an artist in London at the Slade School of Fine Art between 1910 and 1911, where he was a contemporary of Paul Nash, Stanley Spencer, Mark Gertler, and Edward Wadsworth. According to Nash, with whom he formed a close friendship, Nicholson spent more time during his year at the Slade playing billiards than painting or drawing, since the abstract formality of the green baize and the constantly changing relationships of the balls were, he later claimed, of more appeal to his aesthetic sense.David Boyd Haycock, A Crisis of Brilliance: Five Young British Artists and the Great War (2009), p.73."]}, {"page": "Nancy Nicholson", "response": ["Born Annie Mary Pryde Nicholson, she was the only daughter of the artists Sir William Nicholson and Mabel Pryde.

Many artists are the offspring of equally famous artists. I think the additional parameter could be very useful, to help summarise important relationships at-a-glance. Note how, given no such optional parameters to use, the creator(s) of Hans Holbein the Younger had to use the \"Influenced by\" paramemeter to get his elder namesake in! Influenced by his dad, well well! Similarly Hans Holbein the Elder's Infobox says he \"influenced\" Hans Holbein the Younger and Ambrosius Holbein, although you have to read the full article to find they were his sons! Other families who could benefit from the extra Infobox parameter(s) are the Freuds (Lucien Freud and Jane McAdam Freud, the Nicholsons [[painters Sir William Nicholson and Mabel Pryde, with children including artist Ben Nicholson, artist Nancy Nicholson and architect Christopher Nicholson), the Berninis (Gian Lorenzo Bernini and author son Domenico Bernini), the Breugels (Pieter Bruegel the Elder and sons - their father apparently died too young to \"influence\" them, and thus that parameter if used would have to state their grandmother, artist Mayken Verhulst!). Artistic relatives are rarer than theatrical relatives, but they do exist! With no optional extra \"relatives\" parameters there's a potential for inconsistency, too. Take the Renoirs for example: Pierre-Auguste Renoir's \"artist\" Infobox has no \"children\" parameter and yet his children, filmmaker Jean Renoir and actor Pierre Renoir, have \"person\" Infoboxes that can include their \"father\" whenenever anyone desires to expand them from basic to full parameter boxes. Are artists' box \"parents/children\" paramemeters forbidden or deprecated, or are editors allowed the discretion of adding particular parents or children to the artist Infobox wherever it seems appropriate or useful?
