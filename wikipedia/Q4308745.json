In 1981 he won the Grand Prix and gold medal at the International Ballet Competition in Moscow and was immediately invited to join the Bolshoi Ballet as a principal dancer, where he not only became Grigorovich's favourite danseur but went to become the youngest man ever to dance the leading role in Spartacus.After defecting from the Soviet Union in 1990, he became a Senior Principal Dancer with the Royal Ballet in London, remaining with the company for many years and dancing lead roles in the classic ballets as well as the English repertoire.

MacMillan thought the piece could be successfully reworked with some cuts to the score, but the Britten estate refused to allow any alterations.Parry, p. 664 MacMillan reverted to classical ballet for the piece, creating a fairy-tale work far from his accustomed style.
