This taboo presumably originated because of cleanliness concerns, and ultimately, led to other prejudices such as the taboo on marrying outside one's caste. Jaiswal argues that this theory cannot explain how various social groups were isolated as untouchable or accorded a social rank. Jaiswal also notes that several passages from the ancient Vedic texts indicate that there was no taboo against accepting food from people belonging to a different varna or tribe. For example, some Shrauta Sutras mandate that a performer of the Vishvajit sacrifice must live with the Nishadas (a tribe regarded as untouchable in later period) for three days, in their village, and eat their food."]}, {"page": "Indo-Pakistani Sign Language", "response": ["Early in the 20th century, a high incidence of deafness was observed among communities of the Naga hills.

The game was documented as Terh\u00fcch\u00fc by John Henry Hutton in The Angami Nagas, With Some Notes on Neighboring Tribes (1921).  According to Hutton, Terh\u00fcch\u00fc means \"Fighting-eating\" because the two opposing pieces are fighting and eating each other.  There are a few variations of the game under the term Terh\u00fcch\u00fc, and all of them are similar to draughts and Alquerque as players hop over one another's pieces to capture them; they are most similar to Alquerque as a standard Alquerque board is used instead of a checkered square board, and in one variant eight triangular board sections are attached to the four sides (specifically to the middle vertex of each side) and the four corner vertices of the Alquerque board.  Each triangular board section is a triangle that is cross-sliced yielding an additional 48 intersections or vertices (or \"points\") to the 25 points of the standard Alquerque board which yields a total of 73 points on the board.  Each triangle is adjoined to the Alquerque board at one of its three vertices.  Each triangle is cross-sliced in such a way that a line segment is drawn from the adjoining vertex to the base of the triangle with the other line segment drawn across the breadth of the triangle. As in Alquerque, pieces can move and capture in any available direction at any time during the game following the pattern of the board.", "Another Naga people called the Sumi Naga have a very similar game that was documented as the War Game by John Henry Hutton (the same person who documented Terh\u00fcch\u00fc) in The Sema Nagas (1921)..  The Sumi Naga are also from the state of Nagaland of Northeast India.  The Sumi were referred to as Sema in the past.  Hutton provides no indigenous name for the game, or an explanation for the lack of one.  The game is very similar to Terh\u00fcch\u00fc (especially the first two variants described above) and Alquerque with only one obvious difference.  It uses a standard Alquerque board, but with each player only having 11 pieces.  In the beginning of the game, the pieces are placed similarly to that of Alquerque except only one piece from each player occupies the middle row (also known as the common third rank of each player) and they are placed on the outermost points leaving three vacant points at the beginning of the game.

Sanyal mentions that due to the lack of Vaishya and Kshatriya categories in Bengal, all non-Brahmin castes of Bengal, including the Bengali Kayastha and Baidya are Shudras. Despite this, these two castes are called \"higher castes\" along with the Brahmins as their social standing is high.
