On 26 May 2011, at 6:45 Nepali time, Geordie Stewart became the youngest Briton to complete the Seven Summits at the age of 22 years and 21 days. In 2009-10, Indian mountaineer Krushnaa Patil made a bid for the fastest woman to complete the challenge; she fell short of the challenge when, in May 2009, her seventh and final summit bid on Denali was halted by her guide's illness. George Atkinson then became the youngest person in the world to complete the round aged 16 years 362 days. On 24 December 2011, the record was once again beaten, by American Jordan Romero, who completed the challenge at the age of 15 years, 5 months and 12 days by climbing Vinson."]}, {"page": "Scouting in South East England", "response": ["HSX and their members are also notable for a series of high-profile expeditions.

The first summit was Mount McKinley (subsequently renamed Denali), the highest mountain in North America, which he tackled when he was 17 with a team from HSX. This was followed by Mount Kilimanjaro (Africa), Aconcagua (South America), Mount Elbrus (Europe), Mount Kosciuszko (Australia), Mount Vinson (Antarctica) and concluding with Mount Everest on 17 May 2006, his 20th birthday.
