What little is known of her comes primarily by way of Anglo-Saxon charters, possibly including a will, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and hostile anecdotes in works of hagiography. Her union with the king, annulled within a few years of Eadwig's reign, seems to have been a target for factional rivalries which surrounded the throne in the late 950s. By c. 1000, when the careers of the Benedictine reformers Dunstan and Oswald became the subject of hagiography, its memory had suffered heavy degradation. In the mid-960s, however, she appears to have become a well-to-do landowner on good terms with King Edgar and, through her will, a generous benefactress of ecclesiastical houses associated with the royal family, notably the Old Minster and New Minster at Winchester.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Aelfgifu, wife of Eadwig", "response": ["#REDIRECT \u00c6lfgifu (wife of Eadwig)"]}, {"page": "AElfgifu, wife of Eadwig", "response": ["#REDIRECT \u00c6lfgifu (wife of Eadwig)"]}, {"page": "\u00c6lfgifu, wife of Eadwig", "response": ["#REDIRECT \u00c6lfgifu (wife of Eadwig)"]}]}}
