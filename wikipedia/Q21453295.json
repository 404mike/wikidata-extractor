She attended school there before spending a single term at the Glasgow School of Art after which she moved to Newlyn in Cornwall. There, during 1910, she spent four months at the art school run by Stanhope Forbes and was greatly influenced by the work of other artists active in the area, notably Laura Knight and Lamorna Birch. Although largely self-taught as an artist, Buchanan later studied portraiture with Robert Heriot Westwater in Scotland and would eventually settle in Edinburgh. She abandoned painting for some years but resumed doing so in 1933 and continued until the early 1970s when her eyesight began to fail."]}]}}
