She played Fay Eaton in the 1929 Broadway version of Ian Hay's play The Middle Watch, and reprised her role in the 1930 British film version the following year. When her career wound down, she became a business woman, owning a successful millinery firm in London's West End. She was later a casting director, and head of casting for ABC Television (later Thames Television); and largely responsible for casting Diana Rigg in the role of Emma Peel in The Avengers TV series. She later became a theatrical agent.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Avengers (TV series)", "response": ["After more than 60 actresses had been auditioned, the first choice to play the role was Elizabeth Shepherd. However, after filming one and a half episodes (the pilot, \"The Town of No Return\", and part of \"The Murder Market\"), Shepherd was released. Her on-screen personality was deemed less interesting than that of Blackman's Gale, and it was decided that she was not right for the role. Another 20 actresses were auditioned before the show's casting director, Dodo Watts, suggested that producers Brian Clemens and Albert Fennell check out a televised drama featuring the relatively unknown Rigg (she had earlier guested in an episode of The Sentimental Agent that Clemens had written). Rigg's screen test with Macnee showed that the two immediately worked well together."]}, {"page": "List of British films of 1952", "response": ["|Sing Along with Me||Peter Graham Scott||Donald Peers, Dodo Watts||Musical||"]}, {"page": "List of British films of 1933", "response": ["|Hundred to One || Walter West ||Arthur Sinclair, Dodo Watts || Comedy||"]}, {"page": "List of British films of 1932", "response": ["|Honeymoon in Devon||||Dodo Watts, Jack Hobbs||Romance||"]}, {"page": "List of British films of 1930", "response": ["|Almost a Honeymoon||Monty Banks||Clifford Mollison, Dodo Watts, Donald Calthrop||Comedy||", "|The Man from Chicago||Walter Summers||Bernard Nedell, Dodo Watts||Crime||"]}, {"page": "The Wife's Family", "response": ["*Ima Nagg -\tDodo Watts"]}, {"page": "The Man from Chicago", "response": ["The Man from Chicago is a 1931 British crime film directed by Walter Summers and starring Bernard Nedell, Dodo Watts, Joyce Kennedy and Austin Trevor.
