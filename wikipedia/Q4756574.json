Other personnel staying on were Jeremy Pearce who did the design work, while Andrew Catlin was once again asked to do the photography and Sarah Southin returned as a designer. The album is unusual in that Armatrading uses female backing singers. No female backing singers had appeared on an Armatrading album since her debut album Whatever's for Us in 1972, and those were not credited. Subsequent albums used exclusively male backing vocalists. The singers were Linda Lewis, her sister Shirley Lewis and Sylvia Mason-James, all experienced session singers.\"Linda Lewis\". National Portrait Gallery. Retrieved 5 February 2014.
