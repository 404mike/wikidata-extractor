Fricker coined the term epistemic injustice, the concept of an injustice done against someone \"specifically in their capacity as a knower\", and explored the concept in her 2007 book Epistemic Injustice.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Epistemology", "response": ["Feminist epistemology is a subfield of epistemology which applies feminist theory to epistemological questions. It began to emerge as a distinct subfield in the 20th century. Prominent feminist epistemologists include Miranda Fricker (who developed the concept of epistemic injustice), Donna Haraway (who first proposed the concept of situated knowledge), Sandra Harding, and Elizabeth Anderson. Harding proposes that feminist epistemology can be broken into three distinct categories: Feminist empiricism, standpoint epistemology, and postmodern epistemology."]}, {"page": "Index of philosophy articles (I\u2013Q)", "response": ["* Miranda Fricker"]}, {"page": "Jennifer Hornsby", "response": ["* The Cambridge Companion to Feminism in Philosophy (with Miranda Fricker) (2000)"]}, {"page": "List of philosophers born in the 20th century", "response": ["* Miranda Fricker (born 1966)"]}, {"page": "Samuel Guttenplan", "response": ["*Reading Ethics (2008),  (with Miranda Fricker)"]}, {"page": "List of important publications in philosophy", "response": ["* Miranda Fricker, Epistemic Injustice: Power and the Ethics of Knowing, 2007"]}, {"page": "Feminist epistemology", "response": ["The English feminist philosopher Miranda Fricker has argued that in addition to social or political injustices, there can be epistemic injustices in two forms: testimonial injustice and hermeneutical injustice. Testimonial injustice consists in prejudices that cause one to \"give a deflated level of credibility to a speaker's word\": Fricker gives the example of a woman who due to her gender is not believed in a business meeting. She may make a good case, but prejudice causes the listeners to believe her arguments to be less competent or sincere and thus less believable. In this kind of case, Fricker argues that as well as there being an injustice caused by possible outcomes (such as the speaker missing a promotion at work), there is a testimonial injustice: \"a kind of injustice in which someone is wronged specifically in her capacity as a knower\". Such an awareness allows a hearer to account for the likely impact of the identity power relation that mediates between himself and the speaker on his spontaneous perception, essentially correcting for the problems that can result in transactions of testimonial injustice."]}, {"page": "List of British philosophers", "response": ["* Miranda Fricker"]}, {"page": "Fricker", "response": ["*Miranda Fricker, English philosopher"]}, {"page": "British Society for Ethical Theory", "response": ["*2014: Fitzwilliam College, University of Cambridge.
