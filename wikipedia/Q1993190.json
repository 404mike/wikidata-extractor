The producer from New Jersey introduced a new way of working with vocals. Instead of having full verses and choruses, he picked out vocal phrases and played them like an instrument, using sampling technology. Often, individual syllables were reversed or pitch-shifted. This type of vocal treatment is still a key characteristic of the UK garage style. Armand van Helden's speed garage remix of Sneaker Pimps' \"Spin Spin Sugar\" in 1997 further popularized the genre which is sometimes credited with breaking speed garage into the mainstream. Another van Helden remix which also proved popular is his Drum 'n' Bass Mix of CJ Bolland's \"Sugar Is Sweeter\". Huge club hits in 1997 came from speed garage duos Double 99, 187 Lockdown and Industry Standard. The former two both scored UK top 20 hits in 1997 and 1998; Double 99's \"RipGroove\" reached #14 in its second release and 187 Lockdown's \"Gunman\" and \"Kung-Fu\" reached #16 and #9, respectively. Industry Standard scored a top 40 hit with \"Vol. 1 (What You Want What You Need)\" peaking at #34 in January 1998, and the 1997 XL Recordings release of Somore featuring Damon Trueitt's \"I Refuse (What You Want)\" reached #21 also in January 1998, containing mixes by Industry Standard, Ramsey & Fen, R.I.P. Productions and Serious Danger. The Fabulous Baker Boys scored a #34 hit in 1997 with \"Oh Boy\" which samples Jonny L's 1992 rave track \"Hurt You So\"."]}]}}
