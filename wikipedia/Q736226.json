The Austrians beat Spain and Sweden, while Brazil were held to draws by the same two teams. The draw between Brazil and Sweden was especially controversial; Welsh referee Clive Thomas awarded Brazil a very late corner kick, and Zico directly headed the kick into the net; but Thomas blew for time before Zico made contact with the ball, and the goal was disallowed. The Brazilian players were not happy with the decision, but the final result remained a 1\u20131 draw. Heading into their final group game, Brazil needed to beat Austria to be certain of advancing to the second round and managed a 1\u20130 win thanks to a goal from Roberto Dinamite.

John wasn't only one of the greatest footballers who ever lived. He was one of the greatest men ever to play the game.\" He also noted that Charles is the only footballing great to be world class in two very different positions. Giampiero Boniperti, the captain of Juventus when Charles had joined the Bianconeri, spoke of the Welshman's nature as a person: \"I would say he was from another world because of his human qualities. John was one of the most loyal and honest people I have ever met, a very special person. He managed to keep the whole team united, and any quarrels or arguments quietened down as soon as he appeared on the pitch or in the dressing room.\" Jack Charlton said of his former teammate, \"John Charles was a team unto himself. People often say to me, 'Who was the best player you ever saw?', and I answer that it was probably Eus\u00e9bio, Di St\u00e9fano, Cruyff, Pel\u00e9 or our Bob. But the most effective player I ever saw, the one that made the most difference to the performance of the whole team, was without question John Charles.\" Charles' sporting behaviour led international referee Clive Thomas to say \"If you had 22 players of John's calibre, there would be no need for referees \u2013 only time-keepers.\""]}, {"page": "UEFA Euro 1976", "response": ["|Clive Thomas"]}, {"page": "Zico (footballer)", "response": ["In the opening group match of the 1978 World Cup against Sweden, Zico headed a corner kick into the goal in the final minute of the match, apparently breaking a 1\u20131 tie.

In the second round, he scored from a penalty in a 3\u20130 win over Peru. Zico eventually won a bronze medal with Brazil at the tournament, defeating Italy in the 3rd place final.

Led by the free-scoring Friday, the side continued its push for promotion; fourth or higher would be enough to go up. A vital fixture on 31 March 1976 pitted fourth-placed Reading at home against Tranmere Rovers, who occupied third spot; internationally experienced referee Clive Thomas took charge of the game.
