However, it has been suggested that the earliest written account of EHS was described in the biography of the French philosopher Ren\u00e9 Descartes in 1691.  The phrase \"snapping of the brain\" was coined in 1920 by the British physician and psychiatrist Robert Armstrong-Jones.  A detailed description of the syndrome and the name \"exploding head syndrome\" was given by British neurologist John M. S. Pearce in 1989. More recently, Peter Goadsby and Brian Sharpless have proposed renaming EHS \"episodic cranial sensory shock\" as it describes the symptoms more accurately and better attributes to Mitchell."]}, {"page": "British Psychological Society", "response": ["* Robert Armstrong-Jones"]}, {"page": "Robert Armstrong", "response": ["*Robert Armstrong-Jones (1857\u20131943), Welsh physician and psychiatrist"]}, {"page": "Gresham Professor of Physic", "response": ["| 18 || Sir Robert Armstrong-Jones || 24 May 1918"]}, {"page": "Claybury Hospital", "response": ["By 1896, the hospital had 2,500 patients.
