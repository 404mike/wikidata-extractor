Indiaglitz gave the album 4 out of 5 stating \"Vinnaithandi Varuvaya is a cute little album that has experimental score by Rahman. The man with Midas Touch, Rahman is at again. The album is a rich treasure not just for Rahman-fans but to genuine music-lovers too. The music composer seems to have set a trend which others would soon emulate.\" Behindwoods rated the album 3.5 out of 5 stating \"In a rather telling interview with Nik Gowing of BBC, Rahman expressed his deep desire to bring South Indian (he sweetly included all the four states) music out of its narrow confines and popularize it all over the world because it had so much to offer. He has taken a huge step in that direction with this album. Though the music sounds global, it has some tasteful native sensibilities.\" Rediff rated the album 3 out of 5 stating \"It isn't possible to toss an opinion of an A R Rahman album based on just one listen. This composer has a talent for coming up with numbers that grow on you. Lyricist Thamarai stands out, as well. Having said that, it doesn't look like VTV is one of her best efforts. Blame the post-Oscar hype or the burden of too many projects but aside from a few moments of brilliant heights, ARR pretty much sticks to his proven template. In this collection, he's gone more for the western crowd, it seems and there's little space for experimentation. A discerning music-lover might be left yearning for something more. For diehard ARR fans though, it's a musical treat.\" Music Aloud gave the rating of 8.5 out of 10 stating \"To sum up, it is refreshing to hear a set of totally new tunes from a Gautam Menon flick. Rahman has started off his 2010 campaign in style. And in Aaromale, he has once again shown why he is a league apart from other music directors of his time.\" Milliblog reviewed \"Gautam\u2019s fish-out-of-bowl state shows as he grapples with Rahman\u2019s divergently different melodic palette.\" Radioandmusic.com gave the album 3.5 out of 5 and reviewed \"Experimental in nature, the album Vinnaithandi Varuvaya exudes freshness. My pick in the album includes Hossana which would go well with the audiences, Alphonse Joseph owes Rahman for beautiful composition- Aaoromale and Mannipaya.\""]}, {"page": "The Hub (TV programme)", "response": ["The Hub is a news programme that was shown on the international news and current affairs channel BBC World News, between February 2010 and December 2012.
