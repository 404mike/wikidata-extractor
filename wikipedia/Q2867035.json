His son, Billy Bodin, is also a professional footballer.\nA former Chelsea youth team graduate, he moved to Cardiff City via Newport County in 1982. He helped Cardiff to win promotion out of the Third Division in 1982\u201383. He returned to non-League football with Merthyr Tydfil and Bath City in 1985, before rejoining Newport for a \u00a315,000 fee in January 1988. Two months later he was sold on to Swindon Town for twice this sum, and became the club's first choice left-back, helping them to win the 1990 Second Division play-off final and winning himself a place on the PFA Team of the Year in 1990\u201391. He was sold to Crystal Palace for \u00a3550,000 in March 1991, but was loaned out to Newcastle United before being sold back to Swindon for \u00a3225,000 in January 1992. Named as Swindon's Player of the Season in 1992\u201393, he scored the winning goal in the 1991 First Division play-off final. He featured in the Premier League, though after two successive relegations he again earned a place on the Second Division's PFA Team of the Year in 1995\u201396. He then spent two seasons with Reading, as well as a loan spell at Wycombe Wanderers, before entering management with Bath City in 1998. He also won 23 caps for Wales between 1990 and 1994.\nHe spent three seasons as Bath City's manager, before spending 12 years as a youth team coach at Swindon, also spending two games in caretaker charge of the first team in 2011.

Inconsistent form left Swindon in mid-table for much of the season; however, a 4\u20132 win at Charlton Athletic in January left fans hoping for a late-season surge.
