Tony Greig picked him for England in 1975 when he was close to retirement from county cricket for Northamptonshire.\nSteele, who was born in Bradeley, Stoke-on-Trent, was a middle-order batsman. In his eight Test matches, he played against fast bowlers including Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson for Australia; and Andy Roberts, Michael Holding, Wayne Daniel and Vanburn Holder for the West Indies. His arrival followed a period of great difficulty for the national team mired in a difficult 1975 Ashes series. It led to the phrase, coined by Clive Taylor of The Sun, that he was like a \"bank clerk who went to war\".He was appointed as county captain of Derbyshire in 1979 but resigned after six weeks. He played for the club from 1979 to 1981.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "September 29", "response": ["*1941 \u2013 David Steele, English cricketer"]}, {"page": "John Snow (cricketer)", "response": ["* David Steele, England Cricket Six of the Best: The Seventies, A Sharpe Focus Production for Green Umbrella, 2009 (showing Snow's 7/40 in the Fourth Test at Sydney in 1970\u201371, his 48 in the Fourth Test at Headingley in 1972 and his 3/22 in the Second Test at Headlingley in 1975)"]}, {"page": "Lord's", "response": ["The Long Room is found on the ground floor of the pavilion and has been described by Lawrence Booth as \"the most evocative four walls in world cricket\".Arm-Ball to Zooter, Lawrence Booth, Penguin 2006, , p.150-1 Players walk through the Long Room on their way from the dressing rooms to the cricket field; this walk is notoriously long and complex at Lord's.

Once a player reaches the Long Room is approximately 30 paces from the swing door at the rear of the room to the steps which lead onto the playing field. The Long Room is decorated with paintings of famous cricketers and administrators from the 18th to the 21st century, predominantly English players. For an overseas player to have their portrait placed in the Long Room is a considerable honour. Amongst overseas players to have a portrait in the Long Room are four Australians: Don Bradman, Keith Miller, Victor Trumper and Shane Warne."]}, {"page": "Trevor Chappell", "response": ["Over the 1975\u201376 Australian summer Chappell toured South Africa as part of DH Robins XI, a special invitational side managed by Richie Benaud.
