This encouraged him to become a full-time writer, and he developed three long chronicles of the South African experience which all became best-sellers. He acknowledged his publisher Charles Pick's advice to \"write about what you know best\", and his work takes in much authentic detail of the local hunting and mining way of life, along with the romance and conflict that goes with it. \nBy the time of his death in 2021 he had published 49 books and had sold more than 140 million copies, 24 million of them in Italy (by 2014).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of South Africans", "response": ["*Wilbur Smith, novelist (1933\u20132021)"]}, {"page": "January 9", "response": ["*  1933   \u2013 Wilbur Smith, Zambian-English journalist and author"]}, {"page": "Zulu people", "response": ["*When the Lion Feeds, Wilbur Smith, 1964"]}, {"page": "Opeth", "response": ["Opeth was formed as a death metal band in 1989 in Stockholm, Sweden, by lead vocalist David Isberg.

Koneswaram is the easternmost shrine of the 5 ancient Iswarams of Lord Shiva on the island, the others being Naguleswaram (Keerimalai), Thiruketheeswaram (Mannar), Munneswaram (Chilaw) and Tenavaram (Tevan Thurai). Koneswaram has attracted thousands of pilgrims from across Asia, its Shiva shrine mentioned in the Ramayana and the Mahabharata written from 400 to 100 B.C. describe at length its attraction to pilgrims from many countries and from 600 to 660, it has been glorified as one of 275 Shiva Sthalams, or holy Shiva dwellings on the continent in Tevaram. Swami Rock is heralded as a Shiva Upa Peetha (base) of Lanka in the Sivacharita, a Sanskrit work in praise of Shiva, and subsequent manuscripts of the Pithanirnaya (Maha Piitha Nirupana) as a general Sakta Peetha of Lanka with a temple of the compounds dedicated to the goddess Indraksi Devi and a male deity Raksasesvara\u00a0\u2013 a reference to Ravana.
