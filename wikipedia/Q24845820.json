He was born in Hawkhurst in Kent and died at Lewisham in 1900 aged 60.\nHenty was a right-handed batsman and a wicket-keeper. He was a professional at the Prince's Cricket Ground in the 1870s and also ran billiard halls in what is now south-east London. His obituary in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack in 1901 quoted Arthur Haygarth's view that he was \"above the average\" as a batsman, though inclined to be too \"steady\". But he mostly batted in the lower order and his career average was less than eight runs per innings. Almost all of his first-class cricket was for Kent: 116 out of 119 first-class games. He did not appear in the important representative matches such as Gentlemen v Players, though he did play single games for the \"Players of the South\", the \"United South of England Eleven\" and for the Single in the 1871 Married v Single game, which was counted as first-class. At the end of his playing career in 1881, Henty was granted a benefit match by Kent, in which a 13-strong team from Kent played an 11-strong \"England\" eleven in the first game of the Canterbury Cricket Week, with newspaper reports indicating an attendance of more than 4,000 people. The report in the Evening Standard stated that Henty was \"known as a well-conducted and thoroughly deserving professional\".Henty became a cricket umpire, standing in a few important games such as Gentlemen v Players in the 1870s, and then more regularly in county matches across the 1880s and up to 1894.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Henty", "response": ["** Edward Henty (1810\u20131878), pioneer, first permanent settler in Victoria in 1834", "*Edward Henty (cricketer) (1839\u20131900), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Edward Henty", "response": ["Edward Henty (28 March 1810 \u2013 14 August 1878),", "It was difficult to find suitable land in Tasmania and Edward was sent to explore the coast of the mainland. He reported that the district near Portland Bay had good possibilities, and after revisiting it with his father, it was decided that the land was suitable for settlement. Edward went first on the Thistle with labourers, stock, potatoes and seed. After a voyage of 34 days the Thistle arrived at Portland Bay on 19 November 1834 at 8 a.m. Edward Henty told the anecdote,", "Edward Henty was determined to continue with his settlement; his brother, Francis, had joined him in December 1834, and during the next five years other members of the family joined him, and gradually all of their horses, cattle and sheep were transferred from Tasmania. On 29 August 1836 the exploring party headed by Major Thomas Livingstone Mitchell reached Portland Bay and were amazed to find the country already colonised. In later years Edward Henty was fond of telling the story of Major Mitchell when he came to a hut, from which blows of a hammer rang, saying, \"Where is Mr Henty, my man,\" and the reply of the burly blacksmith, \"Here he is at your service.\" From Major Mitchell Henty learned the character of the land to the north, and gradually he was able to acquire more land. In 1845 he had over 70,000 acres (280\u00a0km\u00b2). Sometimes the price of wool and sheep fell very low and it was impossible to sell either to advantage; but over the years the stations prospered. In 1855 Edward Henty was elected a member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly for Normanby and was re-elected in 1859. He was defeated in 1861 and did not sit again in parliament. Henty's last years were spent in retirement at his Melbourne mansion 'Offington' and he died on 14 August 1878. In October 1840 he married Annie Maria Gallie who survived him. They had no children.", "Edward Henty in addition to being the first permanent settler in Victoria was the founder of the wool industry in that colony. His portrait is in the historical collection at the Melbourne public library.", "*Victorian Railways S class locomotive S302 Edward Henty", "*Images and transcripts of Edward Henty's journal and manifest of cargo on board the Thistle at the State Library of Victoria"]}]}}
