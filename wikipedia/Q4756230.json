Clendinning had only a few pounds, her husband was in prison and she had a small family. She tried and failed to find work in London, but she had a contact in Bath. She had met the flautist Andrew Ashe at the Dublin Rotunda concerts and he now directed the Bath concerts. He introduced her to Venanzio Rauzzini who gave her singing lessons. Rauzzini tried her out at a benefit concert for Ashe and she was then engaged by the \"Catch Club\" in Bath. Her benefit there in 1792 raised enough money to pay off her husband's debts. He left prison in Dublin and took a job as a ship's surgeon and died in 1793 at Portsmouth."]}]}}
