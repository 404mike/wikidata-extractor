Bunny began his career as a stage actor, but transitioned to a film career after joining Vitagraph Studios around 1910. At Vitagraph, Bunny made over 150 short films \u2013 many of them domestic comedies with the comedian Flora Finch \u2013 and became one of the most well-known actors of his era.", "In a 1915 interview, Bunny recounted how he decided to enter the film industry after determining that \"it was the 'movies' that were the main cause of the lean times on stage.\" Bunny offered his services to Vitagraph Studios, but was refused a job because the studio manager believed he could not offer Bunny a high enough salary.Lanier 1915, pp. 567\u2013574. For another interview in which Bunny describes his entrance into the film industry, see Agnew 1913, pp. 98\u2013100. Bunny, however, insisted on taking the lower pay and began working at Vitagraph Studios around 1910,Sources disagree on the exact date Bunny began working for the Vitagraph Company. As summarized by Anthony Slide, \"There is considerable question not only as to why [Bunny chose to work at] Vitagraph, but also as to when. According to William Basil Courtney, Bunny's name first appeared on the Vitagraph payroll on October 27, 1910. Albert E. Smith claims Bunny's first Vitagraph film was Doctor Cupid, released on January 10, 1911. Historian and archivist Sam Gill, who has undertaken extensive research into John Bunny's career, believes that his first screen appearance was in Jack Fat and Jim Slim at Coney Island, released on December 2, 1910. The only subject on which there is general agreement is Bunny's initial salary\u2014$40.00 a week\" (Slide & Gevinson 1987, p. 47). where he went on to star in over 150 films. At Vitagraph, Bunny was often paired with the comedian Flora Finch, with whom he made many popular comedies \u2013 often featuring situational humor in a domestic setting, in contrast with the rowdier slapstick style used in some films at the time \u2013 that came to be known as \"Bunnygraphs\" or \"Bunnyfinches\". According to the Library of Congress, the Bunnygraph genre was exemplified by A Cure for Pokeritis (1912), which features the efforts of a wife to put a stop to her husband's gambling habit by organizing a fake police raid on his weekly poker game.", "According to Frank Scheide, Bunny's films might have been taken more seriously because \"Bunny's humor was based more on comedy of manners than slapstick\", a \"polite\" and \"respectable\" form of situational comedy in contrast to the \"decidedly lowbrow, crass, and often violent\" humor of slapstick films. According to Gehring, Bunny was \"the first in a long line of American personality screen comedians\", whose approach is marked by a \"subordination of story to character\".Gehring 1995, p. 121. The personality focus of Bunny's films was also noted by the screenwriter Catherine Carr, who wrote in 1914: \"In most big companies at the present day there are maintained actors around whose personality comedies are being written; i.e., John Bunny, Flora Finch, etc. These actors take the mere germ of a comedy and develop it through their clever acting into a screen production that brings laughter wherever it is shown.\"* Modern viewers may not find Bunny's films as funny as Carr described, however. The film scholar Anthony Slide, for instance, writes that Bunny's \"characterizations contain nothing creative, and he uses no knockabout or slapstick comedy. His comedy is all very middle class and very polite. Often so dull is the storyline that the comedy is difficult to uncover. Time and again one wonders if audiences ever did laugh at his work, and, if so, why?\"Slide 2002, p. 59."]}, {"page": "List of stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame", "response": ["| Flora Finch || Motion pictures || 6673 Hollywood Boulevard"]}, {"page": "Way Out West (1937 film)", "response": ["* Flora Finch as Maw"]}, {"page": "William J.
