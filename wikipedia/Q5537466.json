He is best known for reciting the Lord's Prayer during his execution, something it was believed a witch could never do.", "George Burroughs may have been born in Suffolk, England, although some sources claim he was born in Scituate sometime in 1650.Genealogy of the Burroughs Family, 1894. Compiled by L.A.Burroughs, p.4 Another source gives his birth date and place as Virginia, 1652. He was raised by his mother in the town of Roxbury, Massachusetts. As an American Congregational pastor, he graduated from Harvard College in 1670 with distinguished honors, where he was also considered an outstanding athlete. He became the minister of Salem Village (now Danvers) in 1680 (where he would eventually be convicted of witchcraft and hanged). Burroughs became disillusioned with the community when they failed to pay his wages, and when his wife died suddenly in 1681, he resorted to borrowing money from community member John Putnam to pay for her funeral. He was unable to repay the debt, and resigned from his post, leaving Salem in 1683.", "Burroughs was described in a reading by Frances Hill: \"George Burroughs was confident, strong-willed, and decisive, a man of action as well as a preacher, unusually athletic and clever enough to do well in Harvard. Short of stature, muscular, dark-complexioned, he was highly attractive to women, as is shown by his winning the hand of a rich widow as his second wife when he was a mere village minister.\"", "Letters dated to 1691 from the Littlefields, founder of Wells, Maine, and in-laws to Peter Cloyce, and Rev.
