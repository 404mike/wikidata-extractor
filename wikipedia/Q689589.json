The programme made a number of allegations regarding Hamilton's past and more recent activities. These included his attending and giving a fraternal speech in 1972 to the Movimento Sociale Italiano (MSI) an Italian neo-fascist party led by one of Benito Mussolini's ex-ministers, Giorgio Almirante,\"Parliament Debate on Recommendation to Strip Msi Leader of His Immunity\", JTA, 24 May 1973. Hamilton's membership of the Eldon League, and his involvement with the Powellite faction of the Monday Club and the far-right activist, George Kennedy Young, the former Deputy Director of MI6 and Chairman of the Society for Individual Freedom. The programme also made the claim that Hamilton gave a Nazi salute in Berlin while \"messing around\" on a parliamentary visit in August 1983. A Nazi salute is a criminal offence in the Federal Republic of Germany.Robert Kahn, Holocaust Denial and the Law: A Comparative Study, p. 15 (2004). . In October 1986, Hamilton and his fellow MP Gerald Howarth (one of his closest friends), sued the BBC for libel along with Phil Pedley, a former chairman of the National Young Conservatives, who had appeared on the programme. The Guardian newspaper highlighted Hamilton's admission in The Sunday Times in an article he wrote after the court case that he did give \"a little salute with two fingers to his nose to give the impression of a toothbrush moustache.\"", "On 31 July 1998, Hamilton's action was approved for a court listing.

The title has several possible interpretations: victory, versus, verse, etc. Proposals to screen a filmed version of \"V\" by Channel 4 in October 1987 drew howls of outrage from the tabloid press, some broadsheet journalists, and MPs, apparently concerned about the effects its \"torrents of obscene language\" and \"streams of four-letter filth\" would have on the nation's youth. Indeed, an Early Day Motion entitled \"Television Obscenity\" was proposed on 27 October 1987 by a group of Conservative Members of Parliament (MPs), who condemned Channel 4 and the Independent Broadcasting Authority. The motion was opposed only by MP Norman Buchan, who suggested that fellow members had either failed to read or failed to understand the poem. The broadcast went ahead and, after widespread press coverage, the uproar subsided. Gerald Howarth MP said that Harrison was \"Probably another bolshie poet wishing to impose his frustrations on the rest of us\".
