He was a prolific author, producing more than 60 books and thousands of essays and reviews on literature, social issues, politics, and religion during his lifetime. A prominent critic, Murry is best remembered for his association with Katherine Mansfield, whom he married in 1918 as her second husband, for his friendship with D. H. Lawrence and T. S. Eliot, and for his friendship (and brief affair) with Frieda Lawrence. Following Mansfield's death, Murry edited her work.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Aldous Huxley", "response": ["During the First World War, Huxley spent much of his time at Garsington Manor near Oxford, home of Lady Ottoline Morrell, working as a farm labourer.

Jobs were very scarce, but in 1919 John Middleton Murry was reorganising the Athenaeum and invited Huxley to join the staff. He accepted immediately, and quickly married the Belgian refugee Maria Nys, also at Garsington..

He shows several people falling in love, or dying, or praying in different ways -- dissimilars solving the same problem.\u00a0 Or, vice versa, similar people confronted with dissimilar problems.\u00a0 In this way you can modulate through all the aspects of your theme, you can write variations in any number of different moods.\u00a0 Another way: The novelist can assume the god-like creative privilege and simply elect to consider the events in the story in their various aspects -- emotional, scientific, religious, metaphysical, etc.\u00a0 He will modulate from one to the other -- as, from the aesthetic to the physico-chemical aspect of things, from the religious to the physiological or financial. . . . Put a novelist in the novel.\u00a0 He justifies aesthetic generalizations, which may be interesting -- at least to me.

In his view, the novel's chapters are \"improvised variations on Lawrence's own experience\", and satirize people Lawrence knew. He sees the character Lilly as Lawrence himself, and Aaron as John Middleton Murry. He believes that the book's theme is Lawrence's gratification of his frustrated longing for an \"utterly obedient and subservient disciple.\" He criticizes the book's early chapters, writing that they have little or nothing of Lawrence's \"personal daimon\", and lack the \"thrilling eloquence and passionate poetry and subtle physical emotion of which he alone had the secret\", while the book as a whole shows \"the satirical Lawrence, not at his best, but almost at the level of spiteful gossip.\" According to Lawrence biographer Frances Wilson, Aldington himself is portrayed in Aaron's Rod: \"Aldington is Robert Cunningham, 'a fresh, stoutish young Englishman in khaki.'\"Wilson, Frances, Burning Man: The Trials of D.H. Lawrence, New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2021, p. 138. ."]}, {"page": "The Plumed Serpent", "response": ["Critics have disagreed about the literary merit of The Plumed Serpent, some, including the novelist E. M. Forster and the writer John Middleton Murry, praising it as Lawrence's best work and others dismissing it. According to John B. Vickery, while most critics admired \"Lawrence's masterful descriptions, his evocation of place and his handling of individual scenes\", many also criticised his \"humorless obsession\" with saving Mexico and the world. Lawrence's biographer Harry T. Moore states that The Plumed Serpent received negative reviews from P. C. Kennedy in the New Statesman, the journalist Katherine Anne Porter in the New York Herald Tribune, and the novelist L. P. Hartley in the Saturday Review. He adds that additional negative reviews appeared in The Times Literary Supplement, which described the novel as \"feeble\", and The Spectator, which described it as \"verbose\". However, Moore writes that it received a more mixed assessment, discussing both its good and bad aspects, from the poet Edwin Muir in The Nation and Athenaeum. Moore himself maintained that The Plumed Serpent could be considered a \"magnificent failure\" and that it was \"a greater achievement than the smoother work of the lesser authors celebrated at that time.\" He considered its first six chapters to be its best part, writing that they contain \"wonderful prose\". He also noted that the novel sold well."]}, {"page": "Middleton Murry", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Middleton Murry"]}]}}
