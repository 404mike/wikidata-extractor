He was regarded as a proponent of the Arts and Crafts movement which was prevalent between 1860 and 1910.\nWood's work is principally domestic, but he designed several churches and small commercial buildings. He worked as an individual designer, mostly with only one assistant, and confined himself to the smaller type of building that he could control personally. Although he was active in Manchester for over twenty years, most of his work is in nearby towns, such as Rochdale, Oldham and Middleton (of which he was native), and in outlying districts such as Bramhall and Hale.\nHe contributed to Manchester in various ways. He was a founder of the Northern Art Workers' Guild in 1896, one of the major provincial societies within the Arts and Crafts Movement and was president of the Manchester Society of Architects from 1911 to 1912. Wood retired in 1921 and twenty one of his architectural works are listed.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Arts and Crafts movement", "response": ["* Edgar Wood Centre \u2013 Manchester, England \u2013 1905"]}, {"page": "Charles Holden", "response": ["In 1895 and 1896 Holden submitted designs to Building News Designing Club competitions using the pseudonym \"The Owl\".
