He was born in Bayswater, London and died at Hastings, East Sussex.\nRichardson was educated at Tonbridge School and at Trinity College, Cambridge, from where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1869. He later received a Master of Arts degree from the same college in March 1900.A right-handed middle-order batsman, occasional wicketkeeper and even more occasional bowler of unknown style, he played first-team cricket for his school from the age of 15. At Cambridge in 1866, however, he played in only one first-class match. But when the university season was over, he appeared in five matches for Kent, and scored 50 in the second innings of his first game for the county, against Sussex. He improved on that with an innings of 92 in a return match later in the season.In the three seasons from 1867 to 1869, Richardson played regularly for the Cambridge first team and in the first two of these years was successful as a batsman; he played in all three years in the University Match against Oxford University. From 1868 he also started keeping wicket for Cambridge in occasional games and he retained that position in the 1869 season, though he did not keep wicket for other teams. In the 1869 University Match, he made four stumpings and two catches, but he was unsuccessful with the bat in all of his games against Oxford. His best season with the bat was 1868 when he scored his only century, an innings of 143 for Cambridge University against Surrey at The Oval. In the same season he played against Surrey on two other occasions too, once each for Kent and Middlesex, and also appeared in two Gentlemen v Players games.Richardson played no more first-class cricket after single matches in both 1870 and 1871. He went into business in Mumbai, then called Bombay, and was later chairman of the Anglo-Egyptian Bank and cited as an expert on trade in Egypt.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Henry Richardson", "response": ["Henry Richardson may refer to:", "*Henry Richardson (cricketer, born 1846) (1846\u20131921), English businessman and cricketer", "*Henry Richardson (baseball) (1917-1981), Negro league baseball player", "*Henry Richardson (cricketer, born 1857) (1857\u20131940), English cricketer", "*Henry Richardson (politician) (1883\u2013?), politician in Northern Ireland", "*Henry Richardson (film editor) (born 1936), English and American film editor", "*Henry Richardson (artist) (born 1961), sculptor"]}, {"page": "1868 English cricket season", "response": ["|Henry Richardson || Cambridge UniversityKentMiddlesex|| 10 || 16 || 1 || 431 || 143 || 28.73 || 1 || 3"]}, {"page": "List of Old Tonbridgians", "response": ["* Henry Richardson, cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of tied first-class cricket matches", "response": ["Henry Richardson 56"]}, {"page": "List of Gentlemen cricketers (1841\u20131962)", "response": ["* Henry Richardson (1868)"]}, {"page": "Henry Richardson (cricketer, born 1857)", "response": ["Henry Richardson (4 October 1857 \u2013 20 March 1940) was an English cricketer who played in first-class cricket matches for Nottinghamshire, the Players, the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and several other teams between 1887 and 1894.
