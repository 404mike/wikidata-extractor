In 1998, he dropped into non-league football joining Doncaster Rovers and then Boston United. His career at Boston stalled when he suffered a broken leg in the 3\u20130 FA Trophy victory over Tamworth on 13 January 2001. Regaining fitness, he joined King's Lynn ahead of the 2001\u201302 season. In January 2002, he joined Stocksbridge Park Steels on loan. In April 2002, he moved on to Grantham Town, agreeing a contract for the following two seasons. In the summer of 2004, Minett joined up with his former Grantham manager John Wilkinson at Lincoln United. Wilkinson moved back to manage Grantham in June 2007 and Minett soon followed him to the Gingerbreads. Minett retired from football in June 2008 following Grantham's unsuccessful bid for promotion.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Minett", "response": ["* Jason Minett (born 1971), English footballer"]}]}}
