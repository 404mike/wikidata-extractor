In that same year, aged 10, Butterfield played the lead role in The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas. Director Mark Herman said that they came across Butterfield early on in the audition process. He was on the first audition tape he received and he was the third hopeful he met in person. Herman thought Butterfield's performance was outstanding, but only decided to cast him after auditioning hundreds of other boys, \"so no stone was left unturned\".

Butterfield's knowledge was slim and it was purposely kept that way throughout filming so it would be easier for him to convey his character's innocence. The final scenes of the film were shot at the end of the production period to prepare both him and Jack Scanlon for the dramatic ending of the film."]}, {"page": "30th Young Artist Awards", "response": ["*Asa Butterfield & Jack Scanlon (United Kingdom) - The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas - Heyday Films/Miramax Films"]}, {"page": "Runaway (TV serial)", "response": ["| Dean Davies || Jack Scanlon || 1\u20133 || One of Sean's younger brothers"]}, {"page": "Married Single Other", "response": [";Joe: Joe (Jack Scanlon) is the younger son of Eddie and Lillie and is aged 11.
