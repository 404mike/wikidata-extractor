Statham was born in Solihull.  He was initially a soldier in the Welsh Guards regiment of the British Army playing in the Welsh Guards Band, and was occasionally given to performing as a soloist outside of his military career.\n\n(He was) particularly active in the 1950s and 1960s and is remembered mostly for his marches with titles like \"Piccadilly\", \"Birdcage Walk\", \"Path of Glory\" and best known of all as it was the original signature tune for Match of the Day, \"Drum Majorette\", not to mention other 'production' music' titles for Chappells library such as \"Morning Canter\" and \"Important Occasion\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Skeleton in the closet", "response": ["* \"Skeleton In The Cupboard\", 1953 composition by Leslie Statham"]}, {"page": "Band of the Welsh Guards", "response": ["By 1948 there was a new bandmaster, Leslie Statham who was famed for his compositional prowess by both his real name, and his assumed name Arnold Steck. Under his leadership the band played extensively in Canada to large numbers of people, possibly well over one million, whilst performing hundreds of different items. It is thought that this was off the back of the fact that the Bandmaster had performed at venues visited by the band before as a soloist from the Army School of Music Band, at Kneller Hall. Busy Canadian touring was the start of a long tradition of visiting other countries to play. The most notable tour after this one however, was in 1965, where they visited Milan, to play at \"British Week\", and were accompanied by the \"Pipes, Drums and Dancers\" of the Scots Guards for a long tour to America two years later."]}, {"page": "Arnold Steck", "response": ["#REDIRECT Leslie Statham"]}, {"page": "1974 in British music", "response": ["*28 April - Leslie Statham, composer and arranger, "]}]}}
