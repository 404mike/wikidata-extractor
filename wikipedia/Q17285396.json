Specializing in the ecology and conservation of insects, particularly bumblebees, Goulson is the author of several books, including Bumblebees: Their Behaviour and Ecology (2003), Silent Earth: Averting the Insect Apocalypses (2021), and more than 200 academic articles.

The queens were checked for mites and American foulbrood disease. Agri-environment schemes spread across the neighbouring area of Romney Marsh have been set up to provide over 800 hectares of additional flower-rich habitat for the bees. By the summer of 2013, workers of the species were found near the release zone, proving that nests had been established. The restored habitat has produced a revival in at least five \"Schedule 41 priority\" species: the ruderal bumblebee, Bombus ruderatus; the red-shanked carder bee, Bombus ruderarius; the shrill carder bee, Bombus sylvarum; the brown-banded carder bee, Bombus humilis and the moss carder bee,  Bombus muscorum."]}, {"page": "Haberdashers' Adams", "response": ["* Dave Goulson (born 1965) \u2013 professor of biology (evolution, behaviour and environment) at the University of Sussex, expert on bumblebees and founder of the Bumblebee Conservation Trust"]}, {"page": "Baillie Gifford Prize", "response": ["* Dave Goulson, A Sting in the Tale: My Adventures with Bumblebees"]}, {"page": "North Wales Wildlife Trust", "response": ["*2019 Dave Goulson"]}, {"page": "Bombus terrestris", "response": ["Since 1987, B. terrestris has been bred commercially for use as a pollinator in European greenhouse crops, particularly tomatoes\u2014a task which was previously carried out by human hand.

In Korea, however, some have chosen Bombus ignitus over the already established commercial pollinator, Bombus terrestris, for fear of competition or genetic contamination by mating with native bumblebee species.

The press reported the decline with alarming headlines, including \"Insect Apocalypse\". Ecologist Dave Goulson told The Guardian in 2017: \"We appear to be making vast tracts of land inhospitable to most forms of life, and are currently on course for ecological Armageddon.\" For many studies, factors such as abundance, biomass, and species richness are often found to be declining for some, but not all locations; some species are in decline while others are not. The insects studied have mostly been butterflies and moths, bees, beetles, dragonflies, damselflies and stoneflies. Every species is affected in different ways by changes in the environment, and it cannot be inferred that there is a consistent decrease across different insect groups. When conditions change, some species adapt easily to the change while others struggle to survive.", "In the UK, 27 ecologists and entomologists signed an open letter to The Guardian in March 2019, calling on the British research establishment to investigate the decline.
