Two tracks included drumming contributions from Clive Deamer, whose previous credits included recordings with Portishead and Roni Size. Miller states \"Pigpen\" was first demoed using the opening drum riff from the Led Zeppelin classic recording of blues original When The Levee Breaks.\nHe has provided guest vocals on tracks by Mark Van Hoen and Sing Sing, toured the US briefly with John Darnielle and Peter Hughes from American act The Mountain Goats, and recorded radio sessions with Mary Anne Hobbs for the BBC Radio 1 show Breezeblock, Gideon Coe for BBC 6Music, John Kennedy for XFM, and for British Council's The Selector. He has also collaborated with Steve Cobby, one-half of electronica acts Fila Brazillia and The Cutler.\nOf his prolonged silences Miller says: \"I create when conditions are favourable. That could be soon, or it might be never.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "4AD", "response": ["* Vinny Miller (active)", "* Starry Smooth Hound (the original alias of Vinny Miller)"]}, {"page": "Sing-Sing (band)", "response": ["Both the band's albums were produced by O'Neill's former colleague in Locust, Mark Van Hoen, but they also collaborated with the Mad Professor (remixed \"I'll Be\" in a lovers rock style), Robin Guthrie of Cocteau Twins, cellist and string-arranger Audrey Riley, Tim Keegan (Departure Lounge vocalist) and 4AD artist Vinny Miller.
