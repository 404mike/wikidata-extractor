He was the first president of the  International Matrix Group (1987-1990) and its successor, the International Linear Algebra Society (1990 \u2013 1996), which established the triennial Hans Schneider Prize in 1993. Schneider was a founding editor (1968-1972) and then editor-in-chief of Linear Algebra and Its Applications (1972 - 2012) and an Advisory Editor of the Electronic Journal of Linear Algebra.He received his Ph.D. from the University of Edinburgh in 1952; his advisor was Alexander Craig Aitken. Following his doctorate, he taught at the Queen's University of Belfast until 1959, when he moved to the University of Wisconsin. He retired in 1993. He was the author of over 160 research papers. His research covered many topics in linear algebra, such as Perron Frobenius theory and related topics,  inertia theory. and lately max algebra.

The SIAM Activity Group on Linear Algebra (SIAG/LA) holds a conference every three years (when the year minus 2000 is divisible by 3). As part of the agreement, and to encourage interaction between ILAS and SIAG/LA members, the two societies do not hold conferences in the same year. As a result, ILAS holds conferences two out of every three years. In addition, the two societies exchange speakers with ILAS sponsoring two ILAS speakers at every triennial SIAM Applied Linear Algebra (SIAM ALA) meeting (organized by SIAG/LA) and with SIAM sponsoring a SIAM speaker at every ILAS conference. The first ILAS speakers at a SIAM ALA meeting were Hans Schneider and Hugo Woerdeman in 2000, and the first SIAM speakers at an ILAS conference were Michele Benzi and Misha Kilmer in 2002."]}]}}
