He won 17 England caps between 1948 and 1950, all at left-back, and featured in the 1950 FIFA World Cup. He played in the 1948 FA Cup Final triumph over Blackpool at Wembley Stadium. He left the club in 1954 after scoring 30 goals in 284 appearances.\nAston returned to the club as Youth Team coach in the early 1960s and was then Chief Scout under new manager Wilf McGuinness in 1969, and had a three-year spell in the position before being sacked along with McGuinness's successor, Frank O'Farrell in late 1972.
