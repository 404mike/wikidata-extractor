He went to the Royal Grammar School, Newcastle, Clifton College and studied at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. He received his final medical training at St Bartholomew's Hospital. He received his Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery in 1893 and joined the Fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons.Between 1896 and 1902 he worked at the Albert Dock Seamen's Hospital. In 1902 first he became physician to the Governor-General of the Sudan. Later, in 1904, he became Director of Medical Services to the Sudan Government. He resigned from that position in 1909 and became Director of the Civil Hospitals at Khartoum and Omdurman. Christopherson served with the Red Cross in Serbia during World War I and was taken prisoner of war by the Austrian army. With the help of Rudolf Carl von Slatin, who he knew from his time in Khartoum, Christopherson was able to secure his own release. He went to France and served there as secretary to the War Office Commission on Medical Establishments in the British Expeditionary Force in the ongoing World War I. After returning to the United Kingdom he worked in a bilharzia clinic of the Ministry of Pensions.For his services during the war, he was invested as a member of the Order of the Nile and the Order of St. Sava. In 1919, for his work in the Sudan, he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire.\nChristopherson published his most influential discovery in 1918. He discovered that antimony potassium tartrate was an effective drug in the treatment of bilharzia. Although it had severe side effects, this treatment, which involved the use of antimony derivates, was the state of the art until the 1950s. The next generation of drugs also contained antimony and were in use until the 1970s.He was President of the tropical diseases section of the Royal Society of Medicine in 1929\u20131930 and a member of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de pathologie exotique.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Christoffersen", "response": ["*John Brian Christopherson (1868\u20131955), was a British physician"]}, {"page": "Antimony potassium tartrate", "response": ["The first treatment application against trypanosomiasis was tested in 1906, and the compound's use to treat other tropical diseases was researched. The treatment of leishmania with antimony potassium tartrate started in 1913. After the introduction of antimony(V) containing complexes like sodium stibogluconate and meglumine antimoniate, the use of antimony potassium tartrate was phased out. After British physician John Brian Christopherson's discovery in 1918 that antimony potassium tartrate could cure schistosomiasis, the antimonial drugs became widely used. However, the injection of antimony potassium tartrate had severe side effects such as Adams\u2013Stokes syndrome and therefore alternative substances were under investigation. With the introduction and subsequent larger use of praziquantel in the 1970s, antimony-based treatments fell out of use."]}, {"page": "September 1918", "response": ["* John Brian Christopherson published his discovery that antimony potassium tartrate was an effective cure for bilharzia."]}, {"page": "List of alumni of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge", "response": ["*John Brian Christopherson \u2013 physician and a pioneer of chemotherapy"]}, {"page": "Joseph Arderne Ormerod", "response": ["One of his uncles was Edward Latham Ormerod, F.R.C.P.
