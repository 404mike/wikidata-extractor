His being a lecturer at Basel University cannot be confirmed so far, as his name occurs nowhere in the annales and documents of this institution; the University printer only lists his name for two terms from winter 1901 to summer 1902 and tells us that he was born in Waldenburg (Switzerland) on 21. April 1881. Nobody seems to know if he received his Ph.D., he died on 26 May 1918 in Frankfurt (Germany). Registration or address books in Basel city of the years around 1900 do not include his name.
