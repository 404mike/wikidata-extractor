Harding was another significant force in shaping the sound of a PWL record, and subsequent engineers Pete Hammond and Dave Ford would follow his example. Harding and co-producer/keyboard player Ian Curnow became the club remix and production \"B team\" of PWL Studios with many remixes and productions for internal PWL SAW Productions (Kylie Minogue, Bananarama, Dead Or Alive, Mel & Kim) as well as external record company clients (e.g. Diana Ross, Michael Jackson/Jackson 5, Holly Johnson, Pet Shop Boys, Eighth Wonder, Four Tops, Chic, Depeche Mode, Erasure, Jesus Jones, Voice of the Beehive, Gary Moore) which included many U.S. dance chart No. 1s (such as ABC's \"When Smokey Sings\", Imagination's \"Instinctual\", Blue Mercedes' \"I Want to Be Your Property\"). They also produced the Princess hit \"Say I'm Your Number One\" (1985), the Mandy hit \"I Just Can't Wait\" (1987), and Sinitta's \"Toy Boy\" (1987).", "The tendency toward interchanging artists and repertoire was well established when Rick Astley's breakout album Whenever You Need Somebody got its name and title track from a minor hit the trio had produced a year earlier for O'Chi Brown. Evidently they thought the song still had some mileage, and it was even issued with an exact replica of O'chi's club mix for the Rick Astley club mix. Similarly, many of their songs were tried out and recorded by multiple artists; Mel and Kim, Pepsi and Shirlie and Sinitta all recorded the song \"Who's Gonna Catch You\", both Kylie Minogue and Mandy Smith recorded \"Got To Be Certain\", whilst Mel and Kim, Carol Hitchcock and Hazell Dean all laid down vocals for \"More Than Words Can Say\". Their prodigious, production line-like output and similar song structures led to them being referred to as the \"hit factory\" (not to be confused with the record label of the same name or the New York City recording studio The Hit Factory) and attracted criticism from many quarters, including the Guardian newspaper who unflatteringly dubbed the team, \"Schlock, Aimless and Waterdown\".

The producers wanted to make a synthesized pop album that appeals to teenagers. Stock explained his intention was to make an album full of single-potential tracks, similar to the form of greatest hits compilations. The singer was interested in recording more contemporary R&B material but her request was denied by Waterman. Her voice was double-tracked for most of the album; the producers only allowed Minogue to use her real voice on \"Look My Way\", a track that she felt sounds more like herself than the rest. \"These producers think pop music is candy music.

The TV programme has never been broadcast and is not listed in the BBC archives, yet it was transmitted to the various regional juries in BBC studios around the country, in order for them to cast their votes. The 1979 \"A Song For Europe\" final was never held at all, due to a strike by BBC sound engineers. The juries had to judge using audio recordings of the rehearsals. The songs were presented to the public on Terry Wogan's radio show the following day, after the result was known, followed later in the day with a spot on the TV magazine show Nationwide, where the top 5 were revealed and the winners, Black Lace, were interviewed as guests on the show.  As a result of this industrial action, all future contests were staged at BBC studios and not as outside broadcasts from venues. The 1980 result ended in a tie between Prima Donna's \"Love Enough for Two\" and Maggie Moone's \"Happy Everything\". To resolve this, in an unrehearsed panic, host Terry Wogan called back the juries to announce their favourite of the two songs. This led to extreme confusion when the scoreboard failed to keep up and some juries contradicted the results they had given earlier. Prima Donna won, with eight juries to Maggie Moone's six. A detailed check of the votes after the show did confirm that Prima Donna were the correct winners. Prima Donna were the first winners of the competition specifically formed to take part in Eurovision.
