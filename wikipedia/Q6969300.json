Pathology suggested an underlying inflammation of the small blood vessels of the kidneys.", "Trench nephritis, a term coined by Nathan Raw, was first reported in soldiers of the  British Expeditionary Force in Flanders in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) in 1915. The article included a list of possible causes, including influenza, metal poisoning, toxins as a result of constipation, or a type of beriberi. There was a wide spectrum of opinion on the origin of the condition. Some believed it was a result of scarlet fever. Thomas Oliver wrote authoritatively in the BMJ that exposure was a cause. The Germans had reported that the disease occurred in a particular division of their army among those soldiers who slept on pavement rather than those who slept on wooden boards.Atenstaedt (2011), Chapter 3.1. Defining the Trench Diseases: Introduction pp.45  Thereafter, the Medical Research Council began to investigate the new disease at St Bartholomew's Hospital, and the findings were discussed during the Royal Society of Medicine meeting in February 1916, with Osler as one of the four key speakers. At the time, consensus held with some uncertainty that the then understood acute nephritis was due to toxins, not infection. That this was not the case with the newly found nephritis was debated in several medical journals. Further clarity on an infectious cause was clouded by the finding that some cases did occur in men who had not been in the trenches, urine and blood cultures did not show any infection, and the disease did not appear to spread to areas near the trenches."]}]}}
