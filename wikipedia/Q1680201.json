It starred Brian Murphy with a  supporting cast that included  Hilda Braid, James Cossins, Amanda Barrie, Colin Spaull, Richard Vernon, John Forgeham, and Linda Robson. Created following the death of Yootha Joyce, the other half of the comedy duo of the successful Man About the House and George and Mildred series, it was intended as a new vehicle for Murphy.  The programme followed the misfortunes of a small town driving instructor.  Wilson has been described by Screenonline as \"arguably the most important and influential of all comedy producers/directors in British radio and television\". The series was broadcast on BBC2 in  October and November 1982.
