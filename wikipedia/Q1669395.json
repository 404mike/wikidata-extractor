Sykora, born in 1911, shortly after her parents' marriage, and Clara Phyllis Sykora. He studied geography at the University of Cambridge, where he organized the Cambridge University Band Society. He then studied business and economics at the London School of Economics. During World War II, he served as an intelligence officer in the East Asia. After the war, he taught in London at the London School of Economics and the College for Distributive Trades. Influenced by guitarist Django Reinhardt, he led his own band in the 1950s, appearing with other bandleaders such as Ted Heath. During this time he appeared on the Melody Maker reader's poll for best British jazz guitarist for five consecutive years and won it twice.He had a short first marriage to Margery Mileham whom he had married in 1947. He married his second wife, cabaret singer Helen B. Grant, in 1957 in Westminster.
