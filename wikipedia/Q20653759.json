A NatWest bank clerk, he turned professional with Brighton & Hove Albion aged 23 in October 1974 after being tipped off by Albion number two and former Long Eaton boss Brian Daykin, who was Peter Taylor's assistant. He made 53 appearances and scored thirteen goals in his first two seasons at the Albion. In 1976/77, despite strong competition from Tony Towner, Fell was able to make 26 League and cup appearances. His goals included the third against eventual champions Mansfield Town and a crucial winner versus Port Vale, both in April. Fell was subsequently sold to Southend United in November 1977 as part of the deal that brought Paul Clark to the Goldstone Ground.Following his career in the football league, Fell had a spell abroad in Hong Kong for Happy Valley, before returning to Brighton to play non-League football in the Sussex County League for Whitehawk. He finished the 1983\u201384 season as Whitehawk's leading goalscorer with 35 in all competitions and also played representative football for Sussex. In 1984 Fell captained Whitehawk to the Sussex County League Championship. He was player of the season at Whitehawk in 1984\u201385, before retiring in 1986.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Whitehawk F.C.", "response": [" In 1988\u201389, again under manager Sammy Donnelly, Whitehawk had what was at the time their best run in the FA Cup, going out 2\u20130 in a fourth qualifying round replay to Bognor Regis Town, having previously drawn 2\u20132 at Nyewood Lane. Former Brighton & Hove Albion striker Gerry Fell scored the second equaliser in the away game with virtually the last kick of the match after coming off the bench.
