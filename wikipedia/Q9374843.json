His father was a coal merchant.\nStudying at the University of Liverpool he attained his BSc with first class honours in Zoology in 1905, his MSc in 1907 and his DSc in 1911 on osmotic pressure and the blood of fishes.In 1912 Dakin applied and was appointed as the chair of Biology at the recently established University of Western Australia. Before arriving to take his post Dakin married Catherine Lewis in 1913.\nWhile at UWA Dakin published The Elements of Animal Biology in 1918, chaired the extension committee, twice visited the Houtman Abrolhos and was the president of the [[Royal Society of Westernbelgium\nfor 23 people 3=3 so thats why]\nDakin was Professor of Zoology at the University of Sydney from 1929 to 1947.Among the books he wrote was Whalemen Adventurers (1934), a history of whaling in Australia.

English zoologist Hugh Cott encouraged the use of methods including countershading, but despite his authority on the subject, failed to persuade the British authorities. Soldiers often wrongly viewed camouflage netting as a kind of invisibility cloak, and they had to be taught to look at camouflage practically, from an enemy observer's viewpoint. At the same time in Australia, zoologist William John Dakin advised soldiers to copy animals' methods, using their instincts for wartime camouflage.", "As in the First World War, artists were pressed into service; for example, the surrealist painter Roland Penrose became a lecturer at the newly founded Camouflage Development and Training Centre at Farnham Castle, writing the practical Home Guard Manual of Camouflage. The film-maker Geoffrey Barkas ran the Middle East Command Camouflage Directorate during the 1941\u20131942 war in the Western Desert, including the successful deception of Operation Bertram. Hugh Cott was chief instructor; the artist camouflage officers, who called themselves camoufleurs, included Steven Sykes and Tony Ayrton. In Australia, artists were also prominent in the Sydney Camouflage Group, formed under the chairmanship of Professor William John Dakin, a zoologist from Sydney University. Max Dupain, Sydney Ure Smith, and William Dobell were among the members of the group, which worked at Bankstown Airport, RAAF Base Richmond and Garden Island Dockyard. In the United States, artists like John Vassos took a certificate course in military and industrial camouflage at the American School of Design with Baron Nicholas Cerkasoff, and went on to create camouflage for the Air Force."]}, {"page": "Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science", "response": ["* 1949 William John Dakin"]}, {"page": "Isobel Bennett", "response": ["Isobel Ida Bennett AO 1984 (9 July 1909 \u2013 12 January 2008) was one of Australia's best-known marine biologists.
