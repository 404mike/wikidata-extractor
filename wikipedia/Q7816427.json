He subsequently moved on to Partick Thistle and Queen of the South before joining Hartlepool United on a free transfer in August 1985. He played 15 times the following season, but was released and joined Torquay United in July 1986.\nThe following season saw Torquay involved in a battle to avoid being the first side to suffer automatic relegation to the Conference, Kelly playing in the final game of the season against Crewe Alexandra in which Paul Dobson's late goal saw Lincoln City relegated. He had begun his Plainmoor career as a midfielder, but switched to left-back after the sale of Phil King to Swindon Town. Cyril Knowles took over as Torquay manager in the summer and transformed the side into one battling for promotion. Kelly played 120 times for the Gulls before moving to York City on a free transfer in June 1989.\nHe immediately became a regular in the York side, but in March 1990 moved back to Devon, joining Exeter City for a fee of \u00a315,000. He played 88 times, scoring 9 goals, for the Grecians, winning a Division Four championship medal in 1990, before returning to Torquay United on a free transfer in January 1993 and playing his part in another of Torquay's escapes from relegation to the Conference that season. He played 117 times, scoring 8 goals in his second spell with the Gulls before being released by Eddie May at the end of the 1995\u201396 season. He moved to non-league Weymouth, before moving to Teignmouth from whom he joined Ilfracombe Town.\nKelly left Ilfracombe in November 1997 to join Taunton Town, managed by former Torquay teammate Russell Musker. He quickly settled into the side and was appointed captain, taking over as player-coach when previous assistant manager Derek Fowler stepped down in September 2000. At the end of that season he played in Taunton's 2-1 FA Vase Final win over Berkhamsted Town at Villa Park.\nIn January 2004 Kelly moved to Bideford, managed by another former Torquay colleague, Sean William Joyce. He remained with Bideford until the summer of 2006 when he joined Bridgwater Town, where he played alongside his son Cameron, a midfielder.\nIn March 2007, Kelly joined Devon League side Stoke Gabriel and by 2009 he was player-manager of Bovey Tracey.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Thomas Kelly", "response": ["* Tom Kelly (musician) (born 1946), American musician and songwriter", "* \"Shotgun\" Tom Kelly (born 1949), American radio and television personality", "* Tom Kelly (actor), British television actor", "* Tom Kelly (SDLP politician), former Vice Chairman of the Social Democratic and Labour Party in Northern Ireland", "* Tom Kelly (footballer, born 1885) (1885\u20131916), English professional footballer", "* Tom Kelly (footballer, born 1919) (1919\u20131970), English professional footballer", "* Tom Kelly (footballer, born 1964) (born 1964), Scottish professional footballer", "* Tom Kelly (Irish footballer) (active 1968), Irish footballer", "* Tom Kelly (Gaelic footballer) (active 1999\u20132010), former Gaelic football player", "* Tom Kelly (basketball) (1924\u20132008), American engineer and professional basketball player", "* Tom Kelly (baseball) (born 1950), manager of the Minnesota Twins"]}, {"page": "Stuart Morgan", "response": ["In August 1993 he was appointed as manager of Dorchester Town, where he took 'The Magpies' to their highest ever Southern Premier League finish, but was sacked in September 1999 after a 3\u20130 defeat in the FA Cup qualifying rounds to a Taunton Town side that contained manager Russell Musker and four players, Tom Kelly, Mark Loram, Chris Myers, and Darren Cann, all of whom he had signed while manager of Torquay."]}, {"page": "1989 Associate Members' Cup Final", "response": ["| || ||Tom Kelly"]}, {"page": "1992\u201393 Torquay United F.C. season", "response": ["* Tom Kelly - Exeter City, January, free"]}]}}
