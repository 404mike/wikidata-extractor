A centre forward, he spent two seasons with Wednesday, but only played three First Division games with them during this time, scoring one goal in a 1\u20131 draw against Birmingham City. In 1897 he moved on to Chesterfield, making his debut against Burton Wanderers on 4 September 1897. During his time with the Spireites they were elected to the Football League's Second Division in 1899, and Gooing became a regular goalscorer, notching 25 goals in 63 league appearances.\nIn November 1901 Gooing moved to Woolwich Arsenal, making his debut on 16 November 1901 against Newton Heath, a match which Arsenal won 2\u20130. A regular over the next three seasons, Gooing spearheaded an Arsenal attack (along with Tim Coleman and Tommy Shanks) that won the side promotion from the Second to the First Division in 1903-04, the three of them scoring 66 goals between them in that season.\nHowever, after Arsenal's promotion Gooing was replaced by Charlie Satterthwaite and spent much of the 1904-05 as Satterthwaite's understudy, although he did feature in Arsenal's very first First Division match, against Newcastle United on 3 September 1904. In early 1905 he left Arsenal for Northampton Town, but later retired the same year. In total, he played 106 times for Arsenal, scoring 48 goals.\nHe died aged 95, in 1969.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Paddy Logan (footballer)", "response": ["Logan left Arsenal in the summer of 1900 to join Reading of the Southern League but returned to Woolwich Arsenal a year later. His second spell at Arsenal was shorter and less successful; he only played five league games before losing his place to Bill Gooing. He left Arsenal for Brentford in November 1901; in total he made 29 appearances for Arsenal, scoring 7 goals."]}, {"page": "Walter Anderson (footballer)", "response": ["A diminutive forward, Anderson began his career with Darlington before moving to Thornaby Utopians. He became a professional in 1899 with Sheffield United and made four appearances in the First Division of the Football League over the next two years. Anderson was transferred to Second Division side Woolwich Arsenal in December 1901. He made his first team debut against Preston North End in a 0\u20130 draw on 11 January 1902 and scored his first goal for the club in a 3\u20131 win at Chesterfield Town three weeks later. Having formed a partnership in the team's forward line with Bill Gooing, Anderson scored five goals in 13 league games as the club finished fifth in the Second Division table. The following season, he competed with Tim Coleman for a place in the team. Anderson scored five league goals in 15 matches that season and one in the FA Cup, a 3\u20131 defeat at home to Sheffield United, taking his overall tally to 11 goals in 30 appearances."]}]}}
