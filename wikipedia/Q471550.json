Halliday's third category, mode, is what he refers to as the symbolic organisation of the situation. Downes recognises two distinct aspects within the category of mode and suggests that not only does it describe the relation to the medium: written, spoken, and so on, but also describes the genre of the text (Downes. 1998, 316). Halliday refers to genre as pre-coded language, language that has not simply been used before, but that predetermines the selection of textual meanings. The linguist William Downes makes the point that the principal characteristic of register, no matter how peculiar or diverse, is that it is obvious and immediately recognisable (Downes. 1998, 309).", "*David Crystal. 1998.

The use of diacritic marks is dropped in languages such as French, as well as symbols in Ethiopian languages. In his book, Txtng: the Gr8 Db8 (which translates as \"Texting: the Great Debate\"), David Crystal states that texters in all eleven languages use \"lol\" (\"laughing out loud\"), \"u\", \"brb\" (\"be right back\"), and \"gr8\" (\"great\"), all English-based shorthands. The use of pictograms and logograms in texts are present in every language. They shorten words by using symbols to represent the word or symbols whose name sounds like a syllable of the word such as in 2day or b4. This is commonly used in other languages as well. Crystal gives some examples in several languages such as Italian sei, \"six\", is used for sei, \"you are\". Example: dv6 = dove sei (\"where are you\") and French k7 = cassette (\"casette\"). There is also the use of numeral sequences, substituting for several syllables of a word and creating whole phrases using numerals. For example, in French, a12c4 can be said as \u00e0 un de ces quatres, \"see you around\" (literally: \"to one of these four [days]\"). An example of using symbols in texting and borrowing from English is the use of @. Whenever it is used in texting, its intended use is with the English pronunciation. Crystal gives the example of the Welsh use of @ in @F, pronounced ataf, meaning \"to me\". In character-based languages such as Chinese and Japanese, numbers are assigned syllables based on the shortened form of the pronunciation of the number, sometimes the English pronunciation of the number. In this way, numbers alone can be used to communicate whole passages, such as in Chinese, \"8807701314520\" can be literally translated as \"Hug hug you, kiss you, whole life, whole life I love you.\" English influences worldwide texting in variation, but still in combination with the individual properties of languages.Crystal, David Txtng: the gr8 db8.
