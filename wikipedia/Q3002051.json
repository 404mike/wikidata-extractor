Though often in the firing line from opposition forwards, he never took a step backwards and was a firm favourite with the Cardiff faithful. He began his senior career with Llanelli and after that joined Richmond for two years. Quinnell left Cardiff in May 2002 to join English club Saracens and, for a short while, Worcester but was among the earliest recruits to the newly established Cardiff Blues, playing for three seasons until his injury enforced retirement.\nQuinnell won his first international cap as a flank forward against Fiji in 1995, becoming Wales' first tactical substitution, at the age of 20 and now has 32 international appearances to his name (the majority in the second row). He was a member of the World Cup squad in 1999 and has toured with Wales to Argentina, also in 1999 and Japan two years later.\nAs a player Quinnell had a fearsome reputation with the ball in his hands, but also had a reputation of being somewhat undisciplined, frequently picking up yellow and red cards. Problems with injury, including a serious spinal injury in 2001, meant that Quinnell never achieved as much as his brother Scott.\nOn 13 April 2006, Quinnell announced his retirement from professional rugby. This came following a neck injury sustained during a game for the Cardiff Blues against Glasgow Warriors. Doctors told him that he risked being in a wheelchair if he played rugby again.\nCraig Quinnell is the son of former Welsh international Derek Quinnell and the younger brother of Scott Quinnell. The youngest Quinnell brother, Gavin, played professionally for the Scarlets.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "July 9", "response": ["*  1975   \u2013 Craig Quinnell, Welsh rugby player"]}, {"page": "Saracens F.C.", "response": ["All Black legend Wayne Shelford took over the coaching reins for the 2002\u201303 season, while the playing squad saw the arrival of the likes of Andy Goode, Christian Califano, Craig Quinnell amongst several signings of established players.

I went to tackle Craig Quinnell and he knocked me clean unconscious with his elbow. I played on for another 25 minutes, scored a try and then, eventually, with seven minutes left in the first half, I came around.

With a Grand Slam on the cards, Hanley was one of two Sale players to make their international debut in England's final match of their 1999 Five Nations campaign along with Barrie-Jon Mather. Although Hanley scored a try, he also was handed-off by Craig Quinnell and suffered a broken arm as Wales won 32\u201331. It was the only match Hanley would play for the senior England team. It was never explained to him why he was not selected again, although there was speculation that his defence need to be improved. In 2001, he trained with rugby league side St. Helens to improve his defence. Reflecting in 2005 on why he was unable to break into the England team after 1999, Hanley said \"They had a settled side under Clive [Woodward] and once you were in, it was hard to get out as the team was winning all the time\"."]}, {"page": "National Schools Sevens", "response": ["*Craig Quinnell (Llandovery, 1992)"]}, {"page": "Llandovery College", "response": ["* Craig Quinnell"]}, {"page": "Gavin Quinnell", "response": ["Gavin Quinnell (born 25 November 1983 in Llanelli, Wales) is a former Welsh rugby union player.
