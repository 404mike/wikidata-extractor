Many of the group's recordings, notably \"Triangle\" and their epic seven-minute swan song, \"Missing the Moon\", displayed a strong influence from the popular dance music of the time. Most of the group's records were produced by Ian Catt, who later went on to develop the pop dance sound of \"Missing The Moon\" further with Saint Etienne (whose second single was a cover version of The Field Mice's \"Let's Kiss and Make Up\")."]}, {"page": "Kylie Minogue (album)", "response": ["*Ian Catt \u2013 engineering"]}, {"page": "Sound of Water", "response": ["The album is one of the few releases on which the band did not collaborate with Ian Catt in some way.

It is also arranged in 4/4 (as opposed to the original's waltz time), with a driving piano-bass-drum section. Andrew Weatherall later remixed the song to further emphasise the dub bassline; this remix was featured on both releases of the single and on the compilation Casino Classics (on American and European versions of the single, a Flowered Up remix is erroneously featured instead of the Andrew Weatherall mix).
