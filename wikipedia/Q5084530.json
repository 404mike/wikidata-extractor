He played the remaining 43 games of the 1953\u201354 season as Bradford finished fifth in Division Three (North). He was then an ever-present in the City side for the following four seasons, failing to miss a league or cup game for the club until he fractured his leg 12 minutes from the end of a game against Mansfield Town on 1 September 1958. His run of 237 league games, and 246 in total, broke the club's record of consecutive appearances held by another full back Charlie Bicknell. The run coincided with goalkeeper Geoff Smith, who played 200 consecutive league games between 1954 and 1958. Mulholland returned to the side in November 1958, playing 22 during the 1958\u201359 season and a further 28 the following season. During his stay at Bradford, he had just two partners at full back\u2014Jock Whyte and Tommy Flockett. He was renowned for his pace, and functions to defend and mark the opposition winger, and has been inaugurated into the club's hall of fame."]}, {"page": "Geoff Smith (footballer, born 1928)", "response": ["The following season, Smith's run of consecutive games came to an end against Reading in October 1958, with Jim McCusker coming into the side to replace him for two games. Smith's number of consecutive appearances is third on the club's list behind Mulholland's 231 games and Charlie Bicknell. He played 26 further games in the 1958\u201359 season, in which the club finished 11th in the newly-formed Third Division. The season proved to be Smith's final season for City as he decided to retire aged 31. His last game was a 2\u20131 defeat, once again versus Reading, on 28 February 1959. When the season finished, Smith had played a total of 270 games for the club, 253 of which came in the league, keeping a club record 70 clean sheets. His record stood until it was broken by Paul Tomlinson in the 1990s. When Smith retired, the club granted him and Mulholland each a sum of money rather than the proceeds of a benefit match."]}, {"page": "1940 Football League War Cup Final", "response": ["|||2 || Charlie Bicknell"]}, {"page": "Charlie Bicknell", "response": ["Charlie Bicknell may refer to:", "* Charlie Bicknell (footballer) (1905\u20131994), English footballer", "* Charlie Bicknell (baseball) (1928\u20132013), American Major League Baseball pitcher"]}]}}
