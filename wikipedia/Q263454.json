While legally the daughter of Sir Henry Hozier, her mother\u2019s known infidelity and his suspected infertility make her paternal parentage uncertain. She met Churchill in 1904 and they began their marriage of 56 years in 1908. They had five children together, one of whom (named Marigold) died at the age of two from sepsis. During the First World War, Clementine organised canteens for munitions workers and during the Second World War, she acted as Chairman of the Red Cross Aid to Russia Fund, President of the Young Women\u2019s Christian Association War Time Appeal and Chairman of Maternity Hospital for the Wives of Officers, Fulmer Chase, South Bucks. Throughout her life she was granted many titles, the final being a life peerage following the death of her husband in 1965. In her later years, she sold several of her husband\u2019s portraits to help support herself financially. She died in her London home at the age of 92.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
