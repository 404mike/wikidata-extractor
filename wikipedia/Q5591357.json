The Dogs Do Bark", "response": ["Ker wrote several books exploring this theory, increasingly applying it to rhymes that were not gibberish or nonsensical.  \"Hark Hark\" was addressed in the last of them.  When analyzing it, Ker concluded that the word \"bark\" was a mis-remembering of bije harcke, which he translated as \"harasser of the bee\" and then assumed \"bee\" to have been a metaphor that the Anglo-Saxon population used for itself.  He also found the word \"town\" to be a mis-remembering of touwe, meaning \"rope\", which he assumed to be a metaphor for a hangman's noose.  With these and several other similar inferences, Ker found the original meaning of \"Hark Hark\" to be that of political protest against the Norman government and the Catholic Church (a conclusion he reached with most of the rhymes that he studied).  Ker's theory was not well-accepted.  In a contemporaneous discussion of it, The Spectator found the theory to be a \"delusion\" and \"the clearest case of literary mania we remember\".  His writings were still being discussed several decades later, and still not favorably.  Grace Rhys called Ker's theory \"ingenious if somewhat addlepated\".  The year of publication is not given, but is believed by the HathiTrust to have been in 1894.  And in the Preface of a facsimile reprint of The Original Mother Goose's Melody, William Henry Whitmore noted Ker's work and added that \"opinions differ as to whether he was simply insane on the subject, or was perpetrating an elaborate joke\"."]}, {"page": "List of women writers (M\u2013Z)", "response": ["*Grace Rhys (1865\u20131929, Ireland), fiction wr., poet & es."]}, {"page": "Violet Holden", "response": ["Holden illustrated various publications.
