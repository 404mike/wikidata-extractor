He played as a centre forward.\nMorfitt was born in Sheffield, Yorkshire. He played local football in the Sheffield area and for Mansfield Town in the Midland League before he joined First Division club Birmingham in March 1928. His game was based on pace rather than strength, and he played only once for Birmingham's first team, on 21 March 1931 in a 2\u20131 home defeat to Middlesbrough. Later that year he joined fellow First Division club Blackpool, where again he played only once (in a 1\u20131 draw, against the club he had just left, at Bloomfield Road on 12 September), and in March 1932 he dropped down a division to sign for Bradford. Five goals in nine games for Bradford preceded another move, this time to Southend United of the Third Division South. Here Morfitt finally got regular first-team football. In four years he scored 23 goals in 81 appearances in all competitions before injury forced his retirement from the game in 1936.Morfitt died in 1973 aged about 60.", "link_mentions": {}}}
