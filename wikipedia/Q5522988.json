(Although that was the title given to this production, the 1993 television adaptation of Nunn's 1986 production had also used it.) For this new production, he adapted the lengthy opera to fit the conventions of musical theatre. Working with the Gershwin and Heyward estates, Nunn used dialogue from the original novel and subsequent Broadway stage play to replace the recitatives with naturalistic scenes. He did not use operatic voices in this production, but relied on musical theatre actors as leads. Gareth Valentine provided the musical adaptation. Despite mostly positive reviews, Nunn's production closed months early because of poor box office returns."]}, {"page": "Oh, Kay!", "response": ["A 1990 revival by David Merrick played at the Richard Rodgers Theatre and the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre with an all-black cast, including Brian Stokes Mitchell.\" Oh, Kay!
