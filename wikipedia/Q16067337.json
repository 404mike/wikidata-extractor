He was the last of the eight finishers in the six-man Ireland team in the team road race at the 1912 Olympics. In those Games, a few weeks after the Stockholm Games, Doyle won the Stevens Cup for the 50-mile handicap race organised by the Irish Road Club. He was the second fastest overall in 2-41:08, but won thanks to receiving a handicap of six seconds.", "link_mentions": []}}
