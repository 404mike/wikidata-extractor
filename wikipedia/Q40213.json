A pillar of the Irish literary establishment, he helped to found the Abbey Theatre, and in his later years served two terms as a Senator of the Irish Free State. He was a driving force behind the Irish Literary Revival along with Lady Gregory, Edward Martyn and others.\nYeats was born in Sandymount, Ireland, and educated there and in London. He was a Protestant and member of the Anglo-Irish community. He spent childhood holidays in County Sligo and studied poetry from an early age, when he became fascinated by Irish legends and the occult. These topics feature in the first phase of his work, which lasted roughly until the turn of the 20th century. His earliest volume of verse was published in 1889, and its slow-paced and lyrical poems display debts to Edmund Spenser, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and the poets of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. From 1900, his poetry grew more physical and realistic. He largely renounced the transcendental beliefs of his youth, though he remained preoccupied with physical and spiritual masks, as well as with cyclical theories of life. In 1923, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ernest Hemingway", "response": ["Hemingway said he \"was out of business as a writer\" from 1942 to 1945 during his residence in Cuba.qtd. in Mellow (1992), 552 In 1946 he married Mary, who had an ectopic pregnancy five months later.

Vedrenne and Harley Granville-Barker established a company at the Royal Court Theatre in Sloane Square, Chelsea to present modern drama. Over the next five years they staged fourteen of Shaw's plays. The first, John Bull's Other Island, a comedy about an Englishman in Ireland, attracted leading politicians and was seen by Edward VII, who laughed so much that he broke his chair. The play was withheld from Dublin's Abbey Theatre, for fear of the affront it might provoke, although it was shown at the city's Royal Theatre in November 1907. Shaw later wrote that William Butler Yeats, who had requested the play, \"got rather more than he bargained for... It was uncongenial to the whole spirit of the neo-Gaelic movement, which is bent on creating a new Ireland after its own ideal, whereas my play is a very uncompromising presentment of the real old Ireland.\" Nonetheless, Shaw and Yeats were close friends; Yeats and Lady Gregory tried unsuccessfully to persuade Shaw to take up the vacant co-directorship of the Abbey Theatre after J. M. Synge's death in 1909. Shaw admired other figures in the Irish Literary Revival, including George Russell and James Joyce, and was a close friend of Se\u00e1n O'Casey, who was inspired to become a playwright after reading John Bull's Other Island."]}, {"page": "Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn", "response": ["By the mid-1890s, the Golden Dawn was well established in Great Britain, with over one hundred members from every class of Victorian society.

He then decided to revise the essay-story into a novel he called Stephen Hero, a fictional rendering of Joyce's youth. He worked on this project for a number of years but eventually grew frustrated with its direction and abandoned it. He never published in this form and completely rewrote it as A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, which was published more than ten years later. The Dana did publish one of Joyce's poems in August, and later in the year he wrote a longer satirical poem \"The Holy Office\", which parodied William Butler Yeats's poem \"To Ireland in the Coming Times\","]}]}}
