When he met the American journalist and traveller May Sheldon, he was attracted because she was a modern woman who insisted on serious conversation and not social chit-chat. \"She soon lets you know that chaff won't do\", he wrote. The authors of the book The Congo: Plunder and Resistance tried to argue that Stanley had \"a pathological fear of women, an inability to work with talented co-workers, and an obsequious love of the aristocratic rich\", This is not only at odds with his opinions about society women, but Stanley's intimate correspondence in the Royal Museum of Central Africa, between him and his two fianc\u00e9es, Katie Gough Roberts and Alice Pike, as well as between him and the American journalist May Sheldon, and between him and his wife Dorothy Tennant, shows that he enjoyed close relationships with those women, but both Roberts and Pike ultimately rejected him when he refused to abandon his protracted travels.Alice Pike to Stanley 17 November 1877; also 28, 13 Oct Nov and 4 December 1874; for Katie Gough Roberts see Jeal 87-88"]}, {"page": "Jean-Jacques Henner", "response": ["Henner had numerous pupils; among them were the American painter Mathilde Mueden Leisenring and the Romanian artist Dimitrie Serafim.
