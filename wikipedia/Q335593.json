His contribution to Allied victory lay chiefly in logistics. He was particularly adept at converting data into clear charts to promote a strategy. But despite his credentials, his judgment about technology was often flawed. He tried to block the development of radar in favour of infra-red beams. He discounted the first reports of the enemy's V-weapons programme. He pressed the case for the strategic area bombing of cities on a false premise about the impact of such bombing on civilian morale.\nHis abiding influence on Churchill stemmed from close personal friendship, as a member of the latter's country-house set, including Evelyn Waugh, the Mitfords and the Sitwells. In Churchill's second government, he was given a seat in the cabinet, and later created Viscount Cherwell of Oxford.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Baden-Baden", "response": ["* Frederick Lindemann, 1st Viscount Cherwell (1886\u20131957), British physicist"]}, {"page": "Wadham College, Oxford", "response": ["Frederick Lindemann, 1st Viscount Cherwell, who was Churchill's scientific adviser during the Second World War, was a fellow of the college.
