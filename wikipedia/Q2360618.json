Born in Coventry, he is best known for producing The Moody Blues from 1966 to 1978.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers", "response": ["The first single released by John Mayall and his band, in May 1964, was the song \"Crawling Up a Hill\", with \"Mr. James\" as the b-side. The band on the single were Peter Ward, John McVie on bass, Bernie Watson on guitar, and Martin Hart on drums. After the release, Watson was replaced by Roger Dean, and Hart by Hughie Flint. This lineup played on the album John Mayall Plays John Mayall, recorded in December 1964 and released in 1965. After this, the band released a single called \"Crocodile Walk\", with \"Blues City Shakedown\" as the b-side, which was produced by Tony Clarke of Decca Records. Dean then left the group and was replaced by Clapton."]}, {"page": "The Moody Blues", "response": ["After financial misfortune and a confrontation with an audience member, the band realised that their style of American blues covers and novelty tunes was not working, and decided to perform primarily their own material. (However, as appearances on French TV show, they continued to do two covers through at least the first half of 1968: the Hayward-sung \"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood\", and \"Bye Bye Bird\", with the vocal and harmonica formerly done by Denny Laine now performed by Ray Thomas.) They were introduced to Decca staff producer Tony Clarke, who produced a recording session which saw Justin Hayward's \"Fly Me High\" and Mike Pinder's older-styled \"Really Haven't Got the Time\" (Decca F12607) as the 'Mark Two' Moodies' first single released in May 1967. These picked up both radio airplay and favourable reviews, but failed to chart in the UK. However, the sound gave clues about the direction in which their music would evolve. Their new style, featuring the symphonic sounds of Pinder's mellotron, was introduced on Pinder's song \"Love And Beauty\" (Decca F 12670) which was issued as a single c/w with Hayward's rocker \"Leave This Man Alone\" in September 1967. This too was not a UK hit, but further established their \"new\" Moodies identity. Ray Thomas's flute had been in evidence earlier (\"I've Got a Dream\") on their debut album; however, it became a far more featured instrument from this point onwards as they started incorporating distinct psychedelic influences, which was later developed in a concept album revolving around an archetypal day in the life of everyman.", "Hayward and Lodge released a duo album, the successful Blue Jays (1975), and a UK chart single, \"Blue Guitar\" (no. 8), which was credited to Hayward and Lodge even though it was just Hayward with 10cc backing him. The album had originally been a projected liaison between Hayward and Pinder, but after Pinder dropped out, John Lodge stepped in. (Tony Clarke produced it.) The members then released solo albums. Pinder said he hoped to get the band back together that year. \"Having moved to California in 1974, I returned to Britain for a visit in summer 1975. I was trying to get the band to do an album, but the response was so weak I returned to California with my two new Mk5 mellotrons and began work on my solo album The Promise.\" Edge produced two albums with guitarist Adrian Gurvitz and his brother Paul Gurvitz, Kick Off Your Muddy Boots (1975) and Paradise Ballroom (1976); Hayward composed the acoustically textured Songwriter (1977), which was followed a few years later by Night Flight (1980), Moving Mountains (1985) (which Hayward dedicated to Peter Knight), Classic Blue (1989), The View From The Hill (1996) and Live in San Juan Capistrano (1998). Lodge released Natural Avenue (1977); Pinder produced The Promise (1976); and Thomas collaborated on two projects with songwriter Nicky James, producing From Mighty Oaks (1975) and Hopes, Wishes and Dreams (1976).", "The group toured the UK, Canada and the US in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010. In addition, Hayward took part in the UK tour of Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of the Worlds in April 2006, and a second tour in November 2007, also with dates in 2009. The Moody Blues also toured Australia and New Zealand in 2006. Their long-time producer, Tony Clarke, died in January 2010.
