After graduating, he was a science teacher at Exeter School for seven years, before being appointed Professor of Chemistry at University College, Exeter (as it was then known) in 1901.  From 1925 until his retirement in 1935, he combined his position as Professor with that of Vice-Principal of the College, helping to publicise the institution throughout Devon. In his role as Professor, he was regarded as having built up the Chemistry department from nothing into a \"strong and vital unit.\" He served on the council of the Royal Institute of Chemistry from 1924 to 1927.  He was awarded an honorary doctorate by Exeter University in 1957.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1963 in Wales", "response": ["*25 May \u2013 William Lewis, chemist"]}, {"page": "Transition state theory", "response": ["In early 1900, Max Trautz and William Lewis studied the rate of the reaction using collision theory, based on the kinetic theory of gases.
