G. Wells and John Maynard Keynes and founded the Workers' Birth Control Group which provided advice on birth control to working-class women. In the same year she ran unsuccessfully as a Labour candidate for Chelsea. She campaigned in the Labour Party for birth control clinics, but the party was afraid of losing the support of Roman Catholic voters. She said that she hated the Labour Party after the leadership overruled her lobbied support at the 1925 convention. Public male ally H.G.Wells refused to support her campaign which he believed was only of appeal to women."]}, {"page": "John S.

Key figures in the emergent organisation were prominent humanist activists Dora Russell, Frida Laski, and Ernest and Dorothy Thurtle, as well as Katharine Glasier, Susan Lawrence, Margaret Bonfield, and Dorothy Jewson. They used, as Jane Lewis has written, 'no justification other than the claim of all women as mothers to knowledge of matters concerning their health'. The Workers' Birth Control Group set themselves deliberately apart from Malthusian and eugenicist birth control groups, who they viewed as seeing the poor as inferior. H.G. Wells and Julian Huxley used their own public profiles to gain publicity for the campaign."]}]}}
