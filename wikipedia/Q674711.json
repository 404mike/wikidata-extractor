K. Hack, \"Homer and the cult of heroes\", Transactions of the American  Philological Association 60 (1929:57\u201374). the earliest written reference to hero-cult is attributed to Dracon, the Athenian lawgiver of the late seventh century BC, who prescribed that gods and local heroes should both be honoured according to ancestral custom. The custom, then, was already established, and there were multiple local heroes.Carla M. Antonaccio, \"Contesting the Past: Hero Cult, Tomb Cult, and Epic in Early Greece\" American Journal of Archaeology 98.3 (July 1994:389\u2013410). The written sources emphasise the importance of heroes' tombs and the temenos or sanctuary, where chthonic rites appeased their spirits and induced them to continue to favour the people who looked to them as founders, of whom founding myths were related. In the hero's restricted and local scope he \"retained the limited and partisan interests of his mortal life.  He would help those who lived in the vicinity of his tomb or who belonged to the tribe of which he himself was the founder,\" observes Robert Parker,Parker 1988:250. with the reservation that Heracles, with his pan-Hellenic scope was again the exception."]}, {"page": "G.

In this chapter, he expounded his view of Roman imperialism in the Greek East as harsh, a view he had earlier proposed in an article on Polybius and Roman imperialism; a more accessible version of these views can be found in his chapter in the Blackwell Companion to the Hellenistic world. These (and other papers) represent a sustained argument about the impact of Rome on the Hellenistic world, contesting the previously accepted views of Maurice Holleaux on the nature of Roman expansion and of Polybius' narrative of it. Later he co-edited (with Robert Parker) a memorial volume for George Forrest, Herodotus and his World (Oxford University Press, 2003).

Horse meat was distasteful to the Romans, and Tacitus classes horses among \"profane\" animals.Tacitus, Histories 4.60 and Annals 2.24; Pascal, \"October Horse,\" p. 268. Inedible victims such as the October Horse and dogs were typically offered to chthonic deities in the form of a holocaust, resulting in no shared meal.Pascal, \"October Horse,\" p. 277; John Scheid, \"Sacrifices for Gods and Ancestors,\" in A Companion to Roman Religion, pp. 267\u2013268. In Greece dog sacrifices were made to Mars' counterpart Ares and the related war god Enyalios. At Rome, dogs were sacrificed at the Robigalia, a festival for protecting the crops at which chariot races were held for Mars along with the namesake deity,Robigus (masculine) or Robigo (feminine), who may be an \"indigitation\" of Mars, or originally an epithet or divine name to \"fix\" the desired action of warding off crop disease; William Warde Fowler, The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic (London, 1908), p. 89. and at a very few other public rites.A dog was sacrificed at the Lupercalia, an exceedingly complex festival. On the collocation of wolves (lupus in Latin, one of Mars' primary sacred animals) and bands of male youth enacting violent fertility rituals, see T.P. Wiseman, Remus: A Roman Myth (Cambridge University Press, 1995), p. 80ff., particularly p. 85 on the interpretation of the luperci as \"an initiatory rite in which adolescents had to live wild, like wolves, before returning and being accepted as fully adult members of the community\"; the goat, however, had become the most important animal of the festival in historical times. Birth deities, however, also received offerings of puppies or bitches, and infant cemeteries show a high concentration of puppies, sometimes ritually dismembered.David and Noelle Soren, \"Hecate and the Infant Cemetery at Poggio Gramignano,\" in A Roman Villa and a Late Roman Infant Cemetery (\u00abL'Erma\u00bb di Bretschneider, 1999), p. 619\u2013632, on the archaeology in relation to magical practices. Dog sacrifice was offered to the obscure Roman birth deity Mana Genita, whose name suggests a link to the spirits of the dead called the Manes. Mana Genita is perhaps to be identified with the Genitalis invoked by Horace in his choral ode composed for the Saecular Games in 17 BC, and the Greek counterpart may be Genetyllis,  \u03a3 Pausanias 1.1.5. See also Socrates of Argos, FGrH 310 F 4 apud Plutarch, Roman Questions 52.277B, on an Argive deity Eilioneia (= Eileithyia?). Discussed by Robert Parker, On Greek Religion (Cornell University Press, 2011), pp. 158\u2013159. Puppies were regular offerings in rites characterized as \"magic,\" that is, rituals undertaken on the initiative of an individual, sometimes secretly, that were not a part of public cult nor the private cult of one's gens (the sacra gentilicia), household, or self celebrated regularly by all Romans. Inedible victims were offered to a restricted group of deities mainly involved with the cycle of birth and death, but the reasoning is obscure.Hecate, for instance, was a regular recipient of dog sacrifice, as a chthonic and a birth goddess, or invoked for magic; Parker, On Greek Religion, pp. 158\u2013159, citing also R. Gordon, Revista de historiographia 5.3 [2/2006], pp. 4\u201314."]}, {"page": "Supplicia canum", "response": ["Dog sacrifice is found among other Italic peoples. According to the Iguvine Tablets, Oscans sacrificed an unblemished dog or puppy to the chthonic : it was butchered, and certain parts roasted on spits, with remains left after the sacrifice buried at the altar.Frederick J. Simoons, Eat Not this Flesh: Food Avoidances from Prehistory to the Present (University of Wisconsin Press, 1994, 2nd ed.), p. 410.  No mention is made of disposal after the supplicia canum. The Romans typically sacrificed domestic animals that were a normal part of their diet, and shared the meat in a communal meal. Victims such as dogs were considered inedible, as was the October Horse offered to Mars, and were usually consumed in a holocaust for deities whose spheres of influence pertained to the cycle of birth and death, such as Hecate and Mana Genita.C.
