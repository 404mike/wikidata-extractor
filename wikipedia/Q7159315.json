McGovern was only 19 years old and had been boxing professionally little more than two years. The bout took place at the Westchester Athletic Club in New York. The winner was to receive $7,500, and the loser $2,500, both sizable purses for the period, but far less than boxers would make for a World Title fight a decade later. The referee was George Siler. The fight was billed as the 116 pound championship. McGovern wore green trunks for the bout which he believed gave him luck.\"Sporting News\", The Topeka State Journal, Topeka, Kansas, page 2, 11 September 1899 This was the first world championship bout under Queensberry Rules to end by a one-round knockout.

He had first claimed the World Bantamweight Championship when Terry McGovern abandoned it in 1899, but defeating Palmer legitimized his claim as the world's greatest bantamweight.  According to boxing historian Ken Blady, Harris did not receive word of his twin brother's early death until shortly before entering the ring, moments before the beginning of the bout, which was probably timed to give him a disadvantage in the bout. Harris, tall and rangy for a bantamweight, had a five-inch height advantage over his opponent, and used it effectively in close fighting.  Palmer was down on the mat repeatedly in the fifth round, once for a nine count. Palmer was the favorite in the English betting, but in the sixth to the fifteenth Harris dominated Palmer with his opponent returning to his corner in a dazed state at the closing of each round.
