He later went on to manage clubs on the Isle of Wight such as Newport (IOW), Seaview and St. Helens.\nShiner joined Huddersfield in December 1951 as a replacement for Ronnie Burke at centre-forward and made his debut on Christmas Day. He played in eight further matches that season but for the next three years he was used mainly as a replacement when another forward was injured. Always an enthusiastic and vigorous player, he made a total of only 21 first-team appearances in three and a half seasons at Huddersfield, scoring six goals.\nHe moved to Sheffield Wednesday along with Ron Staniforth in the summer of 1955 where his career blossomed. In four seasons there he made 153 appearances and scored 93 goals. He then spent a season at Hull City.", "link_mentions": {}}}
