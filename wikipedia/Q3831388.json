Loaned out to non-league Weston-super-Mare, he broke through into the Rovers first team in 2003\u201304. He was loaned out to Conference club Forest Green Rovers for a part of the 2004\u201305 and 2005\u201306 campaigns. He then stormed into the Bristol Rovers first team picture with sixty appearances in 2006\u201307. At the end of the season he helped the club to win promotion into League One through the play-offs, and he also played in the club's defeat in the League Trophy final. A first team regular in 2007\u201308, he then lost his place and spent the 2008\u201309 season on loan at Conference side Oxford United.\nHe joined Port Vale on loan at the start of the 2009\u201310 season, before joining the club permanently in January 2010. He recovered from a serious infection following an insect bite sustained at the start of the 2010\u201311 season, only to be struck down with a broken leg at the start of the 2011\u201312 campaign. The injury eventually forced him to retire from professional football in October 2012, though he later returned to play semi-professionally with Yate Town, before signing for Frome Town in November 2014.
