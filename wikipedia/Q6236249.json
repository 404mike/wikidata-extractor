The church was historically associated with the Protestant Ascendancy and had been the established church until 1871; its \"southern\" membership  (one-third of the total) was mostly unionist before 1922 and pro-British thereafter. In late 1948, archbishops John Gregg and Arthur Barton devised replacement prayers to be used in the new republic, at first temporarily until the 1949 general synod would update the Book of Common Prayer. A grassroots campaign led by Hugh Maude of Clondalkin opposed any change, and the 1950 synod authorised a compromise, whereby the old prayers remained in Northern Ireland, and the republic used a \"Prayer for the President and all in authority\" and \"A Prayer for King George the Sixth \u2026 in whose dominions we are not accounted strangers\" (an allusion to the Ireland Act 1949). Likewise, the liturgy for morning and evening prayers includes \"O Lord, save the Queen\" in Northern Ireland and \"O Lord, guide and defend our rulers\" in the republic. Miriam Moffitt notes that Maude's supporters were mostly older church members."]}, {"page": "John Gregg", "response": ["John Gregg may refer to:", "*John Gregg (Guildford MP) (died 1431 or after), English MP for Guildford", "*John Gregg (Texas politician) (1828\u20131864), American politician from Texas who was killed in action during the American Civil War", "*John Gregg (bishop of Cork) (1798\u20131878), Anglican Bishop of Cork, Cloyne and Ross, 1862\u20131878", "*John Gregg (archbishop of Armagh) (1873\u20131961), Anglican Archbishop of Armagh 1939\u20131959", "*John Gregg (1899\u20131986), companion of philanthropist Robert Allerton", "*John Gregg (baker) (1909\u20131964), British founder of Greggs bakery", "*John Gregg (actor) (1939\u20132021), Australian actor", "*John Gregg (loyalist) (1957\u20132003), Ulster loyalist, member of the UDA", "*John Gregg Fee (1816\u20131901), founder of Berea College"]}, {"page": "William Alexander (bishop)", "response": ["In the years 1871 to 1877 he was much involved in the reorganisation of the Church of Ireland and was one of the conservative voices, along with the primate, Marcus Beresford, Archbishop Trench, and Bishop John Gregg of Cork, that preserved the close identity of the Irish Book of Common Prayer with that of the Church of England. He did however regret some of the more aggressively anti-Ritualist provisions in the Irish canons, such as that prohibiting the placement of a cross upon the holy table. He gave the Bampton Lectures in 1876. An eloquent preacher and the author of numerous theological works, including Primary Convictions, he is best known as a master of dignified and animated verse.
