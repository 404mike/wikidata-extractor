M.P.T. Acharya was at this time instructed by Aiyar and Savarkar to set himself up as an informer to Scotland Yard; they believed this would provide information to the police and help corroborate the reports sent by Kirtikar. Although it pursued Indian students and shadowed them closely, Scotland Yard was severely criticised for its inability to penetrate the organisation. The Viceroy's secretary, William Lee-Warner, was assaulted twice in London: he was slapped in the face in his office by a young Bengali student named Kunjalal Bhattacharji and assaulted in a London park by another Indian student. The Yard's inefficiency was blamed for these events.", "A committee set up in 1907 under Sir William Lee-Warner to investigate political unrest among Indian students in Britain noted the strong influence that India House had on this group. This was while India House was under the stewardship of Shyamji Krishna Varma. Indian students who discussed the community at the time described the growing influence of India House\u00a0\u2013 especially in the context of the 1905 partition of Bengal\u00a0\u2013 and attributed to this influence the decrease in the number of Indian applicants for Government posts and the Indian Civil Service. The Indian Sociologist attracted considerable attention in London newspapers. Others, however, disagreed with these views and described India House's appeal as limited. S.D. Bhaba, president of the Indian Christian Union, once described Krishna Varma as a man \"whose bark was worse than his bite\"."]}, {"page": "List of chief commissioners of Coorg Province", "response": ["|William Lee-Warner"]}, {"page": "The Cambridge Modern History", "response": ["|William Lee-Warner"]}, {"page": "Wife selling", "response": ["As reported in 1897 by William Lee-Warner, \"husbands sold their wives from motives of enmity as well as gain.

The rising spread south to the Khyber Pass, the route to Landi Kotal. On the British side, Udny, supported by Harold Deane, believed Ghulam Haidar Khan was fomenting the tribal uprising under orders, despite denials from the Amir. Holdich was not so definite, thinking from personal knowledge that Ghulam Haidar Khan's motivations were more religious than political.
