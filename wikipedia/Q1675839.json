Based on a concept by SHM Foundation trustee Dame Henrietta Moore, Hancock developed and led the composition of Snapshot Songs, a large-scale community song-cycle produced in collaboration with Londoners. The songs featured collaborations with and performances by several London community organisations, including the rappers and poets of creative criminal justice charity Only Connect, the teen ambassadors of HIV support charity Body & Soul, Barbican-Guildhall Creative Learning groups such as Future Band, Drum Heads and the Barbican Young Poets, together with poetry from the likes of Mat Lloyd, Luke Wright and Josh Mowll.  Snapshot Songs was performed for the first time at the Milton Court Concert Hall, Barbican, London, on 13 and 14 April 2014, with a diverse 50-strong collaborative community choir, Drum Heads, the London Schools Symphony Orchestra (conducted by Peter Ash), and the composer at the piano. One of the 19 songs, entitled \"@IvyBean104\", was Hancock's setting of the colourful tweets of internet personality Ivy Bean, who had reputedly been the world's oldest active user of Twitter at the age of 104."]}]}}
