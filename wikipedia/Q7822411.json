Rumours abound that former Bullets coach Tony Garbelotto would be hired by the club were rapidly quashed by Wilson. In the same interview with regional newspaper Birmingham Mail, Wilson was keen to stress that the new club is attempting to cut any links to the former Bullets franchise. Wilson also claimed the Bullets name was not chosen for the new franchise because of connotations with gun crime, a move that was taken by the NBA's Washington Wizards (formerly called Bullets) in 1995. Instead, the name Panthers was opted for in reference to former BBL franchise Doncaster Panthers, where Wilson started his career as a basketball coach as an assistant to Curtis Xavier in the early 1990s."]}, {"page": "Mersey Tigers", "response": ["The club looked to build on the success of their first season by appointing Tony Garbelotto, assistant coach of Great Britain, as the new first team coach.
