The following month, however, the club's form dipped and this led to John Hollins and Alan Lewer losing their jobs. The news did not go down well with the fans as the pair had stuck with Crawley when others decided to leave and they had managed to lift the club off the bottom despite a 10-point deduction. They were replaced by players Ben Judge and David Woozley with the help of John Yems, the former Fulham FC and Millwall FC coach. Life started well for the trio who picked up 10 points from a possible 12. Crawley finished 18th in the division and managed to beat the drop after securing the point they needed on the final day of the season."]}, {"page": "2007\u201308 in English football", "response": ["*28 August 2007 \u2013 David Woozley (Crawley Town)"]}, {"page": "Jon Boardman", "response": ["On 23 August 2001, Boardman accompanied his Palace teammate David Woozley to Torquay United and began a week's trial (whilst Woozley was signed on a month's loan).
