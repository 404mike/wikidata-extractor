Radmilovic had Croatian and Irish origins. He represented Great Britain at four editions of Summer Olympics. He won four Olympic titles in a 22-year Olympic career.  He won four gold medals across three successive Olympic Games, a record which stood for a Great Britain Olympic athlete until broken by Sir Steve Redgrave when he won his fifth gold medal at Sydney in 2000. In 1928, he became the first person to compete for Britain at five Olympic Games, a record that would remain until surpassed by fencer Bill Hoskyns in 1976.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Welsh people", "response": ["*Paul Radmilovic (1886\u20131968), swimmer and water-polo player"]}, {"page": "List of people from Serbia", "response": ["*Paul Radmilovic, water polo player for Great Britain in the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm"]}, {"page": "Swimming at the 1908 Summer Olympics", "response": ["| John Derbyshire  Paul RadmilovicWilliam FosterHenry Taylor"]}, {"page": "List of Olympic medalists in swimming (men)", "response": ["|valign=top| John DerbyshirePaul RadmilovicWilliam FosterHenry Taylor"]}, {"page": "Water polo at the 1908 Summer Olympics", "response": ["|George CornetCharles ForsythGeorge NevinsonPaul RadmilovicCharles SmithThomas ThouldGeorge Wilkinson", "* Paul Radmilovic", "| Paul Radmilovic ||  ||align=center| 2"]}, {"page": "Manuel Estiarte", "response": ["Estiarte is the first water polo player to compete at six Olympic Games.
