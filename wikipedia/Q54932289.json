His father made occasional business trips to the city as part of his timber business. During this sojourn, they visited the \u00cele d'Orl\u00e9ans, in search of pine timber. Walker made subsequent visits to Quebec City during the following years. His formal schooling ended at the Listowel Public School in 1872; he never went on to pursue formal academic training in art. At the age of 15, Walker moved to Toronto, Ontario to apprentice with the photographic firm Notman and Fraser. It was a fortunate opportunity, as several successful artists also worked there; Walker learned watercolour from Robert Ford Gagen, miniature portrait painting from John Arthur Fraser, and painting from Lucius Richard O'Brien and Henri Perr\u00e9.Harper, 204."]}, {"page": "Royal Canadian Academy of Arts", "response": ["| data-sort-value=\"Gagen\"|Robert Ford Gagen (1847\u20131926)"]}, {"page": "Canadian Society of Painters in Water Colour", "response": ["The founding members of the CSPWC/SCPA\"Aquarelle!, A history of the Canadian Society of Painters in Water Colour 1925-1985\", Rebecca Sisler RCA, Porcupine Quill 1986 were F.H.

The Academy chose works from the annual RCA show that year which had an unusually good selection, artists having been encouraged to put their best, not only their latest works, Established artists were selected as, for instance, Robert Ford Gagen, one of the Canadian Fine Arts Comissionaires, who exhibited a watercolour of a seascape, but relative newcomers also were included, such as Mary E. Wrinch who showed a case of miniature paintings on ivory. "]}]}}
