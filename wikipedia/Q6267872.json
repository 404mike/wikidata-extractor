This occurred when he suffered a career-threatening ankle injury at the hands of Birmingham City's Johnny Watts, and knee ligament damage sustained when tackled by Eddie McCreadie at Stamford Bridge. Being a creative and diminutive figure, Giles thereafter accepted he would have to become a tougher player in order to avoid being singled out by opponents. On later becoming a pundit, Giles at length wrote about how he felt he had to become \"a lion rather than a lamb\" on the pitch so as to help achieve his full potential. His primary reason for this was to avoid being labelled a hypocrite when the time came for him to give judgement on tough tackling by others."]}, {"page": "John Watts", "response": ["*Johnny Watts (English footballer) (1931\u20132006), English football player for Birmingham City F.C.", "*Johnny Watts (Australian footballer) (1883\u20131952), Australian rules footballer"]}, {"page": "Watts (surname)", "response": ["* Johnny Watts (English footballer), English football player for Birmingham City F.C."]}, {"page": "Bunny Larkin", "response": ["He played more frequently the following season, filling in at right-half for Johnny Watts.
