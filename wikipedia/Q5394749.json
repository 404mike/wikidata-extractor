He quickly attracted attention from several sides, including Cardiff City who had considered signing Dudley when they completed the signing of his teammate Stan Montgomery in 1948. He eventually joined Leeds United in August 1949 in a player swap deal that saw Albert Wakefield move in the opposite direction. The transfer saw Dudley's weekly wage rise from seven pound per week to twelve pound and, after making his debut for the club against West Ham United on 22 August 1949, he finished his first season with the Yorkshire club as their top goalscorer, scoring 16 times in all competitions, including four goals during their run to the FA Cup quarter-finals. The following season, Dudley continued his goalscoring form, scoring eleven times during the first half of the season before Leeds manager Frank Buckley offered Dudley to Southampton in exchange for Ernie Stevenson, Dudley signing his contract with the Saints during a train journey from Leeds to London."]}, {"page": "Wilf Grant", "response": ["He made his debut for the \"Saints\" in a Second Division game away to West Bromwich Albion on 5 October 1946 on the left wing, where he soon became settled, scoring a brace in a 5\u20131 victory over Plymouth Argyle on 26 October. Manager Bill Dodgin preferred him on the right, however, (where he replaced Billy Bevis), teaming up with the ageing Bill Rochford. This role was not to Grant's liking and his form slumped. Although he was transfer-listed in August 1948, he remained with Southampton for the next two seasons, used occasionally as replacement for Eric Day. In 1948\u201349 he seemed settled back on the left before he lost his place to Bill Heaton. After a rather frustrating time, he joined Cardiff City in March 1950 with Ernie Stevenson coming to the south coast in exchange. In his four seasons at The Dell he made 64 appearances scoring 13 goals."]}, {"page": "List of people from Rotherham", "response": ["*Ernie Stevenson, footballer"]}]}}
