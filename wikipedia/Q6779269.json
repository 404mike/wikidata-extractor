Their aim was to get women into Edinburgh University and Walker became the \"chief intellect and administrator\".

Crudelius wished to keep the ELEA separate from the controversy raging over the women aspiring to become doctors, and she built up support amongst male academics, with strong encouragement from David Masson, Professor of Rhetoric and English Literature, who offered the first university-level lectures to Edinburgh women in 1868, and whose wife Emily Rosaline Orme Masson was a leader in the women's suffrage movement in Edinburgh. The lectures were well-attended and within the next five years the association had arranged for several more subjects to be offered, including science subjects.", "*Mary Crudelius", "*Mary Crudelius"]}, {"page": "Sarah Mair", "response": ["Sarah Mair was an important member of the Edinburgh Ladies' Educational Association in 1867, present at the founding meeting, but not considered a founder member, presumably because she was unmarried and rather young.
