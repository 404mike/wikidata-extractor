Several were for stone bridges and had estimated costs of between \u00a330,000 and \u00a393,000. Brunel submitted four entries. The judging committee rejected 17 of the 22 plans submitted, on the grounds of appearance or cost.

The invitation was met with skepticism among the engineering community. At that time, there was not a suspension bridge that could allow a train to pass over it safely. While the Europeans were erecting suspension bridges by the hundreds, the Americans mostly ignored them out of safety concerns; in 1831 Sir Samuel Brown's Broughton Suspension Bridge in Britain had collapsed under the marching feet of a troop of soldiers, sending those on its deck into the River Irwell.  Furthermore, many American bridges had collapsed without experiencing weight and pressure equivalent to railroad traffic, and American engineers feared that any railway bridge would likely fail\u2014especially a suspension bridge."]}, {"page": "Royal Guelphic Order", "response": ["* Samuel Brown (Royal Navy officer)"]}, {"page": "Samuel Brown", "response": ["Samuel Brown may refer to:", "* Samuel Brown (Royal Navy officer) (1776\u20131852), English pioneer suspension bridge engineer and inventor ", "* Samuel Brown (engineer), English inventor of early internal combustion engine", "* Samuel Brown (Wisconsin politician) (1804\u20131874), American pioneer and politician in Milwaukee, Wisconsin", "* Samuel Brown (mayor) (1845\u20131909), mayor of Wellington, New Zealand", "* Samuel Brown (Alberta politician) (1872\u20131962), provincial politician from Alberta, Canada", "* Samuel Brown (Oregon politician) (1821\u20131886), American pioneer and politician", "* Samuel Brown (cricketer) (1857\u20131938), English cricketer", "* Samuel Browne (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "Royal Suspension Chain Pier", "response": ["Generally known as the Chain Pier, it was designed by Captain Samuel Brown  and built in 1823.
