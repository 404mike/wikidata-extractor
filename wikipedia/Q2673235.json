The hand with the match was, until sometime in the sixth season, that of creator Bruce Geller; in the revival series, the hand belonged to Peter Graves, who was shown holding the match. Several British teleseries produced by Gerry Anderson and his then wife Sylvia Anderson, the contemporaneous Thunderbirds (made in 1964) and the mid-1970s Space: 1999 (which starred Mission: Impossible alumni Martin Landau and Barbara Bain) amongst them, also showed clips in the opening sequence. The reimagined Battlestar Galactica TV series also used this device. The clips in the opening sequence were chosen to showcase dramatic moments in the upcoming mission, such as moments of surprise, moments of violence, or equipment in use. In particular, the first clip shown was often someone getting punched and/or knocked out. For the first two seasons, the closing credits showed clips from that mission in freeze frame. At the start of 1968, when Paramount took over from Desilu, the same clips were shown during the closing credits across episodes; later seasons eschewed that approach, featuring a freeze frame of the hand lighting the fuse."]}, {"page": "Absolutely Fabulous", "response": ["*Sylvia Anderson"]}, {"page": "Supermarionation", "response": ["Supermarionation (a portmanteau of the words \"super\", \"marionette\" and \"animation\")La Rivi\u00e8re 2009, p.\u00a067. is a style of television and film production employed by British company AP Films (later Century 21 Productions) in its puppet TV series and feature films of the 1960s. These productions were created by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson and filmed at APF's studios on the Slough Trading Estate. The characters were played by electronic marionettes with a moveable lower lip, which opened and closed in time with pre-recorded dialogue by means of a solenoid in the puppet's head or chest. The productions were mostly science fiction with the puppetry supervised by Christine Glanville, art direction by either Bob Bell or Keith Wilson, and music composed by Barry Gray. They also made extensive use of scale model special effects, directed by Derek Meddings.", "The term was coined in 1960 by Gerry Anderson.Hearn, p.\u00a020. Sources describe Supermarionation as a style of puppetry,Sangster and Condon, pp.\u00a0726-727. a production technique or process,O'Neill, p.\u00a04. or a promotional term. Emma Thom of the National Science and Media Museum defines it as APF's use of electronics to synchronise puppets' lip movements with pre-recorded dialogue. According to Jeff Evans, it \"express[es] the elaborate style of puppetry\" used in APF's productions. Anderson denied that the term referred to a process, stating that he coined it as a promotional tool to separate APF's output from other children's puppet series like Muffin the Mule and Flower Pot Men. This was motivated by his embarrassment in working with puppets as opposed to live actors, and his wish to dispel the notion that APF's marionettes were \"the sort of puppets that were used in pre-school programmes\".Hearn, p.\u00a032. He also likened Supermarionation to a \"trademark\". According to Sylvia Anderson, the term was used to \"distinguish the pure puppetry of the stage from our more sophisticated filmed-television version\". Lou Ceffer of the website Spy Hollywood calls Supermarionation a \"marketing term\".", "A major limitation of the marionettes was their inability to walk convincingly.Peel, p.\u00a016.O'Neill, p.\u00a013. This was due to their low weight and the fact that the legs of each puppet were controlled by only two strings, which made complex articulation impossible.Peel, p.\u00a019. According to Sylvia Anderson, the re-design exacerbated the puppets' core deficiencies: \"The more realistic our puppets became, the more problems we had with them ... It was just possible to get away with the awkward moments in Thunderbirds because the proportions of the characters were still caricature. It was later when we had developed a more realistic approach ... that the still imperfect walk was [all] the more obvious.\"La Rivi\u00e8re 2009, p.\u00a0153. To limit the need for leg movement, many scenes featuring walks were filmed from the waist up, with motion implied by a puppeteer holding the legs out of shot and bobbing the marionette up and down while pushing it forward.Rogers et al., p.\u00a015.La Rivi\u00e8re 2014, p.\u00a0199. Other scenes showed puppets standing, sitting or driving vehicles. Tex Tucker, the hero of Four Feather Falls, avoids walking by riding a horse called Rocky, while the characters of Fireball XL5, Stingray and Thunderbirds achieve the same through use of personal hovercraft.Sellers, pp.\u00a078; 84.Holliss, p.\u00a047.Peel, p.\u00a020. Supercar and Stingrays focus on their eponymous car and submarine, as well as Stingrays depiction of Commander Shore as a paraplegic confined to a futuristic \"hoverchair\", are examples of other devices used to overcome the puppets' lack of mobility.La Rivi\u00e8re 2009, p.\u00a044."]}, {"page": "Sylvia and Gerry Anderson", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sylvia Anderson"]}, {"page": "Gerry Anderson", "response": ["The new series, Supercar, (1960\u201361) was developed by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson and Reg Hill based on a story written by Sylvia Anderson and marked several important advances for APF.

The series was also the official debut of Supermarionation, the electronic system that made the marionettes more lifelike and convincing on screen. The system used the audio signal from pre-recorded tapes of the actors' voices to trigger solenoids installed in the heads of the puppets, making their lips move in synchronisation with the voices of the actors, and actresses.", "Another futuristic science-fiction adventure, it was based on the premise that a huge thermonuclear explosion on the Moon's surface (caused by the storage of nuclear waste there) projected the Moon out of orbit and into interplanetary space.
