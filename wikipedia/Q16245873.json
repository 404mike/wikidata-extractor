He was manager Bruno Ribeiro's first signing for the club, and Knops said that he wanted to come to Vale Park because of Ribeiro's attractive style of football. He began the 2016\u201317 season playing at left-back after injuries to Kiko and Adam Yates. He adapted well to the role and forged an effective partnership with left-winger Jerome Thomas, and remained the \"Valiants\" first choice left-back despite the signing of Sam Hart and Kiko's recovery from injury. He continued to hold down a first team place despite the arrival of specialist left-back Scott Tanser in the January transfer window. However, he snapped his knee during a 3\u20130 defeat to Rochdale at Spotland Stadium on 4 April, and was ruled out of action for nine months. His knee also became infected, forcing him to spend three weeks in hospital. Speaking in June 2017, manager Michael Brown revealed that the infection had returned to the area and further surgery was required, which would keep him ruled out for the 2017\u201318 season. In May 2018 he was released upon the expiry of his contract by new manager Neil Aspin. However he stayed on to train with the club in order to try and win a new contract.

Having allowed Santos and Hart to leave the club, Brown then signed veteran midfielder Chris Eagles on a short-term contract, and brought in 20-year loanee Callum Guy in from Derby County and 20-year striker Tyler Walker on loan from Nottingham Forest.
