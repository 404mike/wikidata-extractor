After briefly working at a secondary school in Berlin-Charlottenburg, he began the process of habilitation in 1907 at the University of Berlin and began to teach there as an untenured lecturer, known in German as Privatdozent. In 1918, Fraenkel married Ruth von Velsen, a classical scholar who gave up her career to support him. They had three sons and two daughters, one of whom was the future mathematician Edward Fraenkel. Having been promoted to an extraordinary professorship at Berlin in 1920, Fraenkel was appointed a full professor of Latin at the University of Kiel in 1923. His appointment followed the publication of a monograph on the Roman comedian Plautus  which established his reputation in the discipline."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society D, E, F", "response": ["| Ludwig Edward Fraenkel||11/03/1993||"]}, {"page": "Ludwig Edward Fraenkel", "response": ["#REDIRECTEdward Fraenkel"]}, {"page": "Jeffery\u2013Hamel flow", "response": ["In fluid dynamics Jeffery\u2013Hamel flow is a flow created by a converging or diverging channel with a source or sink of fluid volume at the point of intersection of the two plane walls.
