Besides Murdoch the club already had ten players who Charlton moulded into a championship winning side: Jim Platt (goalkeeper), John Craggs (right-back), Stuart Boam and Willie Maddren (centre-backs), Frank Spraggon (left-back), David Armstrong (left midfield), Graeme Souness (central midfield), Alan Foggon (attacking midfield), John Hickton and David Mills (forwards). Some of these players were already settled at the club and in their positions, whilst Charlton had to work with some of the other players. He moved Souness from left midfield to central midfield to compensate for his lack of pace and coached him to play the ball forward rather than side to side as was his instinct. Foggon was played in a new role which Charlton created to break the offside trap set by opposition defenders, an extremely fast player he was instructed to run behind defenders and latch on to the long ball to find himself one-on-one with the goalkeeper."]}, {"page": "Middlesbrough F.C.", "response": ["* Willie Maddren", "|1973|| Willie Maddren", "| 1984\u20131986 || Willie Maddren"]}, {"page": "Billingham", "response": ["* Willie Maddren, former Middlesbrough F.C. footballer and manager"]}, {"page": "Bernie Slaven", "response": ["In a trial game against Bradford City, Slaven scored and impressed enough to win a move to the club, who secured his services after paying Albion Rovers a \u00a325,000 fee.

He officially retired as a player in 1979, returning to the Teesside club as physiotherapist in 1982 before being promoted to the manager's seat in March 1984. Although his time as manager at the club was difficult due to the club's financial difficulties and a loss in form which pushed them towards relegation to the Third Division in 1986 (costing him his job), he built a significant part of the side which would win two successive promotions under his successor Bruce Rioch.
