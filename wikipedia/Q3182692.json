He was educated at Winchester College (1941-6) and then at the Royal College of Music (1949\u201352). In the early 1950s he was a freelance oboist, playing mostly with the Boyd Neel Orchestra and Sadler's Wells Orchestra. From 1954 until 1961 he was music critic for The Daily Telegraph, and from 1961 until 1972 he was music critic for The Sunday Telegraph. From 1978 until 1983 he served as the Artistic Director of the Leeds Festival. From 1984 until 1993 he taught on the music faculty at the University of Oxford. He is the author of Six Great Composers (1955); Carl Maria von Weber (Hamish Hamilton, 1968, 2nd ed.

Warrack also comments that the piano parts, though not lacking in harmonic interest, are discernibly written by a non-pianist.

Generally seen only in French repertoire, this Fach was named after the French singer Jean-Blaise Martin. Associated with the rise of the baritone in the 19th century, Martin was well known for his fondness for falsetto singing, and the designation 'baryton Martin' has been used (Faure, 1886) to separate his voice from the 'Verdi Baritone', which carried the chest register further into the upper range. It is important to note that this voice type shares the primo passaggio and secondo passaggio with the Dramatic Tenor and Heldentenor (C4 and F4 respectively), and hence could be trained as a tenor."]}, {"page": "Marian Anderson", "response": ["*Rosenthal, Harold and John Warrack (1979, 2nd ed.).

Although the work was generally regarded as a critical and public failure, aspects of its music have been recognised as among Tippett's best. The critic John Warrack writes that, after the violence of the opening acts, the third act's music has a lyrical warmth comparable to that of The Midsummer Marriage\".

The post of Master of the King's Musick continued because George IV maintained the traditional small orchestra, which Shield's successor, Christian Kramer, directed. That remained the chief function of the Master through the tenures of Franz Cramer (Master 1834\u201348), George Frederick Anderson (Master 1848\u201370), and Sir William Cusins (Master 1870\u201393).
