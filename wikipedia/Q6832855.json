He made his first appearance for the side as a second-half substitute for Rhys McCabe against Arbroath in the Scottish League Cup, where he made an immediate impact by helping to create Michael Moffat's second goal of the match to leave his side as 3\u20130 winners. His first start for the Pars came in the same competition, against Fife rivals Cowdenbeath. Once again, Higginbotham helped to create a goal for his side, this time coming in the form of a free-kick which was headed in goal by defender Lee Ashcroft to put Dunfermline two-nil up. His first goal for the club came in his thirteenth appearance for Dunfermline, and saw him convert a penalty in the twenthy-second minute against Hibernian, a match which the Pars eventually lost 3\u20131.
