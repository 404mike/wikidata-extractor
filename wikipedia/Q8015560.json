The works had been, for a while, in some decline and Clark took rapid steps to improve management controls, attracting additional capital and persuading Henry Austin Bruce to share with him the responsibility of the trusteeship. Clark took up his residence at Dowlais and devoted all his energies to the development of the works and the redemption of the estate. As Bruce devoted himself to politics, the whole responsibility of management devolved on Clark alone, whose rare capacity for administration was displayed no less by his rapid mastery of a complicated situation than by his wise selection of heads of departments, chief among whom was his general manager, William Menelaus."]}, {"page": "Charles Darling, 1st Baron Darling", "response": ["Darling was born in Abbey House in Colchester, the eldest son of Charles Darling and Sarah Frances, n\u00e9e Tizard.

Under the patronage of his uncle William Menelaus, he was articled with a firm of solicitors in Birmingham, before entering the Inner Temple as a student in 1872. After reading in the chambers of the pleader John Welch, Darling was called to the bar in 1874. He then devilled for John Huddleston (later Baron Huddleston) and joined the Oxford circuit. Although he took silk in 1885 he was never prominent at the bar and practised almost entirely within his own circuit. He combined his legal career with journalism, and contributed to the St. James's Gazette, the Pall Mall Gazette, and the Saturday Review."]}, {"page": "Dowlais Ironworks", "response": ["The works had been, for a while, in some decline and Clark took rapid steps to improve management controls, bringing in William Menelaus as general manager. The pair worked closely together and Dowlais again became a centre of innovation. Though the Bessemer process was licensed in 1856, nine years of detailed planning and project management were needed before the first steel was produced. The company thrived with its new cost-effective production methods, forming alliances with the Consett Iron Company and Krupp. By 1857 Clark and Menelaus had constructed the \"Goat Mill\", the world's most powerful rolling mill.Owen (1977) pp57\u201358"]}, {"page": "Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining", "response": ["The Institute's roots go back to the Iron and Steel Institute.

Menelaus was its president from 1875 to 1877, and in 1881 was awarded the Bessemer Gold Medal. In 1974 the Iron and Steel Institute merged into the Institute of Metals. The Institute of Metals then merged in 1993 with The Institute of Ceramics and The Plastics and Rubber Institute (PRI) to form the Institute of Materials (IoM).
