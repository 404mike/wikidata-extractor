In fact, the information comes from Bazhanov himself. Although it became common gossip among the inmates of the labor camps that Blumkin had indeed killed Bazhanov, and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn repeats thar legend in The Gulag Archipelago, the truth is that Bazhanov died only in 1983. Bazhanov was then also aware of the rumour of his own murder and wrote that Stalin had probably planted the rumour himself to instill fear."]}, {"page": "Georges Agabekov", "response": ["In his book The Storm Petrels: The First Soviet Defectors, 1928\u20131938 (1977), the British intelligence officer and journalist Gordon Brook-Shepherd maintained that Agabekov's defection to France in June 1930 was solely owing to the fact that he had fallen in love with an underage English girl, Isabel Streater, who taught him English.\u0411\u043b\u0438\u0436\u043d\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441 However, Agabekov's own account implied political and ideological motives and criticised what he saw as the degeneration of the revolution, the party's \"bureaucratisation\", the abuses of the apparatus, the party's lack of democracy and Stalin's autocratic rule.See Chapter XXXI of his 1931 book \u0427\u041a \u0437\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0439 as well as the conclusion of his \u0413. \u041f. \u0423. \u0417\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0447\u0435\u043a\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430 of the previous year, inter alia."]}]}}
