The subgenre mixed grime with R&B, showcasing a softer side of grime, often with accompanying R&B vocals, while keeping the 140bpm rugged sound of grime. Many UK R&B singers, such as Sadie Ama, Lady Ny, Katie Pearl and Gemma Fox would perform over R&G instrumentals, usually without an MC rapping alongside them. Many grime artists also made various R&G tracks, such as Ruff Sqwad, Wiley, Kano, Skepta and Dizzee Rascal. Producers such as Blackjack, Iron Soul, Low Deep and Kid D also incorporated R&G elements into their instrumentals. Lady Ny has stated she was the first woman to sing on grime, and the first woman to bring out a grime mixtape.", "In 2018, Gemma Fox released Grime Vocals Archive, a collection of previously unreleased or unheard rhythm & grime songs."]}, {"page": "Chucky Thompson", "response": ["* 2004: Gemma Fox: \"Messy\""]}, {"page": "List of Polydor Records artists", "response": ["* Gemma Fox"]}, {"page": "Gemma fox", "response": ["#REDIRECT Gemma Fox "]}, {"page": "Rollin' with the Nines", "response": ["# Camilla, Gemma Fox & Lady Fury : \"Girls Gotta Do\""]}, {"page": "Urban Music Awards", "response": ["| Best R&B Act||Gemma Fox"]}, {"page": "Sound of...", "response": ["| Gemma Fox"]}, {"page": "Midi Mafia", "response": ["The MIDI Mafia is a music production duo consisting of American Bruce Waynne (born Waynne Nugent) from Brooklyn, New York and Canadian Dirty Swift (born Kevin Risto) from Ottawa, Ontario.
