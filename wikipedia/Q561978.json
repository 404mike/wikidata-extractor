The Council maintained the most historically important tombs in their original positions when landscaping the churchyard in the mid-20th century.  The oldest surviving tomb is that of Captain Nicholas Tettersell, who helped King Charles II escape to France in 1651 after he fled from the Battle of Worcester.  The table-tomb dates from 1674, stands next to the south wall of the church and is a Grade II-listed structure.  The lid of the stone-built tomb recounts the story of Tettersell's involvement in the King's escape. Martha Gunn (1726\u20131815), the \"Venerable Priestess of the Bath\", was Brighton's most famous and celebrated \"dipper\" (operator of the bathing machines popular in the resort's early history).  The headstone, in the shape of a coffin, is also Grade II-listed and commemorates other members of her family.  Actress and singer Anna Maria Crouch has an elaborate, Grade II-listed, Coade stone table tomb with a carved memorial tablet, friezes with foliage patterns and Vitruvian scrolls, putti and a Classical-style urn. Phoebe Hessel (1713\u20131821) lived to 108, posed as a man and fought as a soldier for 17 years so she could be with her army husband, and later retired to Brighton where she made a living selling goods on a street corner.  Aged 79, she helped to apprehend two robbers while drinking at the Red Lion Inn, Shoreham-by-Sea.  Put into the workhouse in 1800, she discharged herself at the age of 93, became a local celebrity and received a sizeable pension paid personally by the Prince Regent.  Prominent Jewish resident Hyam Lewis paid for her tombstone, a Grade II-listed structure which was later repaired by her army regiment's modern successors. Amon Wilds, father of Amon Henry Wilds and one Brighton's most important architects, is buried in a tomb whose Grade II-listed headstone was designed by his son.  It is decorated with Ammonite capitals, one of their favourite architectural motifs. Sake Dean Mahomed (1749\u20131851), a Bengali travel writer and entrepreneur who introduced \"shampooing\" massages (Turkish baths) to England when he opened a bath-house in Brighton in 1815\u2014and later provided his services to Kings George IV and William IV\u2014is buried nearby in another Grade II-listed tomb.  Dr Swan Downer, a merchant and philanthropist who endowed the Swan Downer School for poor girls, is also buried in the churchyard.  His school building at 11 Dyke Road, near the church, survives as a nightclub.  In 1984, a memorial stone to actress Dame Flora Robson was placed near the church door.  She lived at Wykeham Terrace next to the churchyard.
