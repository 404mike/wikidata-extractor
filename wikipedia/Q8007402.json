His works include the Dorchester Hotel, Wolseley House, New Scotland Yard, and the buildings, including the former Manor House, in Stockgrove Country Park. He was awarded the Royal Gold Medal in 1942. Around 20 of his designs are listed buildings. He is the younger brother of the craftsman and furniture designer Arthur Romney Green.\nBorn in Hampshire, Curtis Green studied architecture in West Bromwich and Birmingham. He became articled to John Belcher and trained at the Royal Academy Schools. Curtis Green took up his own practice in 1898 and was soon in demand. His first commissions included several power stations and small houses.  He became an Associate Member of the Royal Academy of Arts in 1903. He took part in the Romford Garden Suburb exhibition in 1910, where he built two dwellings. This enabled him to showcase his talents.  One of the buildings won a first prize for garden design, and the other was entered into the Class I category for being one of the best homes in the development.\nIn 1921 he designed 160 Piccadilly for the Wolseley Motor Company to use as a showroom, and for which he was awarded a RIBA bronze medal. Several years later, he was commissioned by Barclays Bank to build several offices, including the refurbishment of 160 Piccadilly, which they had bought from Wolseley. His projects were now becoming grander in size. Curtis Green was elected as an associate of the Royal Academy in 1923, and became a full academician ten years later.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Edwin Lutyens", "response": ["During the later years of his life, Lutyens suffered with several bouts of pneumonia.

James Maude Richards, hired by Williams, served as an architectural assistant within the all-engineer staff. Percy Morley Horder, consulting architect to Gordon's Hotels, had not been consulted during the design process and, after seeing the plan, resigned from the project, remarking to The Observer that the design was ill-suited for the location, assuming the concrete was to be left unpainted and that the insulation would be minimal. Some 40,000 tonnes of earth were excavated to make room for the hotel's extensive basement which is one-third of the size of the hotel above the surface. The upper eight floors were erected in just 10 weeks, supported on a massive  thick reinforced concrete deck that forms the roof of the first floor. With the development of the Dorchester, concerns were raised that Park Lane would soon become New York City's Fifth Avenue.", "The architectural style adopted by William Curtis Green, largely based on Owen William's design, was a departure from the Neoclassical with its reinforced concrete covered over with terrazzo slabs. British Modernists were disappointed with the result, describing Green's adaptation as, \"a genteel period piece which looks the compromise it is\". In comparison to some of the other hotels in London such as the Lanesborough, the building's exterior is unremarkable. It is eight storeys high aside from the ground floor, with the central bay containing three windows on each floor. Christopher Matthew has stated that he thinks of the Dorchester as a \"rather American hotel\", not only because of the strong association with American actors such as Elizabeth Taylor, but because the sweeping 1930s facade reminded him of many of those which appeared in American film musicals. However, he notes that the hotel still remains \"very much an English hotel\". The hotel became a Grade II Listed Building in January 1981.", "The interior displays a \"subtle amalgam of styles\", testament to the number of different designers involved over the years, including William Curtis Green, Oliver Frederick Ford, Alberto Pinto and Oliver Messel. Green designed the original interior which is still retained in part. Kim Einhorn believes that this fusion of style was achieved tastefully and has remarked that the Dorchester Hotel is \"a good example of somewhere it may be better to add decor rather than completely re-invent\".
