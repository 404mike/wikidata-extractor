His works include the Dorchester Hotel, Wolseley House, New Scotland Yard, and the buildings, including the former Manor House, in Stockgrove Country Park. He was awarded the Royal Gold Medal in 1942. Around 20 of his designs are listed buildings. He is the younger brother of the craftsman and furniture designer Arthur Romney Green.\nBorn in Hampshire, Curtis Green studied architecture in West Bromwich and Birmingham. He became articled to John Belcher and trained at the Royal Academy Schools. Curtis Green took up his own practice in 1898 and was soon in demand. His first commissions included several power stations and small houses.  He became an Associate Member of the Royal Academy of Arts in 1903. He took part in the Romford Garden Suburb exhibition in 1910, where he built two dwellings. This enabled him to showcase his talents.  One of the buildings won a first prize for garden design, and the other was entered into the Class I category for being one of the best homes in the development.\nIn 1921 he designed 160 Piccadilly for the Wolseley Motor Company to use as a showroom, and for which he was awarded a RIBA bronze medal. Several years later, he was commissioned by Barclays Bank to build several offices, including the refurbishment of 160 Piccadilly, which they had bought from Wolseley. His projects were now becoming grander in size. Curtis Green was elected as an associate of the Royal Academy in 1923, and became a full academician ten years later.", "link_mentions": {}}}
