Many of his fights would have been title fights, but some of his opponents were not able to make the Flyweight division's 112 pound weight limit, so P\u00e9rez often had to settle for non-title wins instead.

Ferreri proved a stern test for Owen, with his counter-punching style causing the Welshman problems in the opening rounds. By the eleventh round of the fifteen-round contest, The Times judged the fight to be \"fascinatingly poised\" but Owen's renowned stamina and the eight-year age gap proved telling as he was described as \"covering the last four rounds of the fight like a sprinter\". The referee awarded the fight 148\u2013145 in Owen's favour and both fighters received plaudits from the capacity crowd; Ferreri was given a standing ovation by the largely Welsh crowd and Owen was carried to the dressing room on the shoulders of his team in celebration. Both Owen and the fight received several plaudits in annual award ceremonies, including Owen being named Best Young Fighter by the Boxing Writers' Club, becoming only the third Welshman after Howard Winstone and Dai Dower to receive the award.
