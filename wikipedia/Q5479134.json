She is currently Professor of Hebrew Bible and Ancient Religion at the University of Exeter. The main focus of her research is on the Hebrew Bible, and on Israelite and Judahite history and religion.She also popularises biblical historical subjects as a TV presenter on BBC2 and Channel 4. She comments on the Historicity of the Bible and Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) narratives, the role of women in the Abrahamic religions and the development of the Biblical texts.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Child sacrifice", "response": ["*Francesca Stavrakopoulou (2004). \"King Manasseh and Child Sacrifice: Biblical Distortions of Historical Realities', p283. \"Though the Hebrew Bible portrays child sacrifice as a foreign practice, several texts indicates that it was a native element of Judahite deity-worship.\"", "Genesis relates the binding of Isaac, by Abraham to present his son, Isaac, as a sacrifice on Mount Moriah. It was a test of faith (Genesis 21:12). Abraham agrees to this command without arguing. The story ends with an angel stopping Abraham at the last minute and making Isaac's sacrifice unnecessary by providing a ram, caught in some nearby bushes, to be sacrificed instead. Francesca Stavrakopoulou has speculated that it is possible that the story \"contains traces of a tradition in which Abraham does sacrifice Isaac\". Rabbi A.I. Kook, first Chief Rabbi of Israel, stressed that the climax of the story, commanding Abraham not to sacrifice Isaac, is the whole point: to put an end to the ritual of child sacrifice, which contradicts the morality of a perfect and giving (not taking) monotheistic God.\"Olat Reiya\", p. 93. According to Irving Greenberg the story of the binding of Isaac, symbolizes the prohibition to worship God by human sacrifices, at a time when human sacrifices were the norm worldwide.Irving Greenberg. 1988. The Jewish Way: Living the Holidays. New York : Summit Books. p.195."]}, {"page": "Moloch", "response": ["Since Day's and Heider's objections, a growing number of scholars has come to believe that Moloch refers to the mulk sacrifice rather than a deity. Francesca Stavrakopoulou argues that \"because both Heider and Day accept Eissfeldt's interpretation of Phoenician-Punic  as a  sacrificial term, their  positions are at once compromised by the possibility that biblical  could well function in a similar way as a technical term for a type of sacrifice\". She further argues that \"whoring after Moloch\" does not need to imply a deity as  refers to both the act of sacrificing and the thing sacrificed, allowing an interpretation of \"whor[ing]  after  the mlk-offering\". Heath Dewrell argues that the translation of Leviticus 20:5 in the Septuagint, which substitutes \u1f04\u03c1\u03c7\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 \"princes\" for Moloch, implies that the biblical urtext did not include the phrase \"whoring after Moloch\". Bennie Reynolds further notes that at least one inscription from Tyre does appear to mention  sacrifice (RES 367); therefore Day and Heider are incorrect that the practice is unattested in Canaan (Phoenicia). Reynolds also argues for further parallels.", "A minority of scholars, mainly scholars of Punic studies, has argued that the ceremonies to Moloch are in fact a non-lethal dedication ceremony rather than a sacrifice. These theories are partially supported by commentary in the Talmud and among early Jewish commentators of the Bible. Rejecting such arguments, Paolo Xella and Francesca Stavrakopoulou note that the Bible explicitly connects the ritual to Moloch at the tophet with the verbs indicating slaughter, killing in sacrifice, deities \"eating\" the children, and holocaust. Xella also refers to Carthaginian and Phoenician child sacrifice found referenced in Greco-Roman sources."]}, {"page": "Binding of Isaac", "response": ["Francesca Stavrakopoulou has speculated that it is possible that the story \"contains traces of a tradition in which Abraham does sacrifice Isaac\".It may be that the biblical story contains traces of a tradition in which Abraham does sacrifice Isaac, for in Genesis\u00a022:19 Abraham appears to return from the mountain without Isaac.

Friedman argued that in the original E story, Abraham may have carried out the sacrifice of Isaac, but that later repugnance at the idea of a human sacrifice led the redactor of JE to add the lines in which a ram is substituted for Isaac.Friedman, R.E. (2003). The Bible With Sources Revealed, p.\u00a065.

His views on worship of the goddess as expressed in this book have been criticised by some. On his methodological approach more generally, Francesca Stavrakopoulou has suggested that his use of the term 'folk religion' 'ultimately endorses the old stereotype of 'popular' or 'folk' religion as the simplistic practices of rural communities', so perpetuating existing 'derogatory assumptions' that more recent discourses on the topic have sought to counter.Stavrakopoulou, Francesca (2010)  'Popular' Religion and 'Official' Religion: Practice, Perception, Portrayal.

A common view among scholars is that the Ark was originally conceived as Yahweh's footstool, above which he was invisibly enthroned. Biblical scholar Francesca Stavrakopoulou states that Yahweh was physically enthroned above the Ark as a cult statue and it was only following the Exile that Yahweh was conceived as unseen and the prohibition on carved images was added to the Ten Commandments.  On the other hand, some biblical scholars believe the story of the Ark was written independently and then incorporated into the main biblical narrative just before the exile into Babylon.  Biblical scholar Thomas R\u00f6mer speculates that the Ark may have contained statues of Yahweh and Asherah, and that it could have remained in Kiriath Jearim for much longer, possibly until shortly before the Babylonian conquest."]}, {"page": "Tim Whitmarsh", "response": ["*Monotheism, Disbelief and the Hebrew Bible\u2014in conversation with Francesca Stavrakopoulou, 20 September 2013"]}, {"page": "Richard Herring's interview podcasts", "response": ["| Francesca Stavrakopoulou at Exeter Corn Exchange"]}, {"page": "Stavrakopoulou", "response": ["#REDIRECT Francesca Stavrakopoulou"]}, {"page": "Christian persecution complex", "response": ["Hornback notes that the Christian persecution complex is widespread among nationalists in Europe, who feel that they are defending the continent from a new Islamic invasion.
