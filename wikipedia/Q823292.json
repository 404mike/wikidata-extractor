Herivelismus consisted of the idea, the Herivel tip and the method of establishing whether it applied using the Herivel square. It was based on Herivel's insight into the habits of German operators of the Enigma cipher machine that allowed Bletchley Park to easily deduce part of the daily key. For a brief but critical period after May 1940, the Herivel tip in conjunction with \"cillies\" (another class of operator error) was the main technique used to solve Enigma.\nAfter the war, Herivel became an academic, studying the history and philosophy of science at Queen's University Belfast, particularly Isaac Newton, Joseph Fourier, Christiaan Huygens. In retirement, he wrote an autobiographical account of his work at Bletchley Park entitled Herivelismus and the German Military Enigma.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica", "response": ["* John Herivel, The background to Newton's Principia; a study of Newton's dynamical researches in the years 1664\u201384 (Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1965)."]}, {"page": "Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge", "response": ["Eleven members of the college worked at Bletchley Park during World War Two.
