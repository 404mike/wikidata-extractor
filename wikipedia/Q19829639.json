Its first art exhibition, held in 1889, included paintings by Gainsborough, Constable, and Canaletto. Over the years, the building has been used as the City Art Gallery, a public library, a girls\u2019 grammar school, and from the 1950s to 1982 as the Lancaster College of Art. In the 1960s there were touring exhibitions of works by Picasso, Matisse, and Francis Bacon. The permanent art collection was moved in 1968 to Lancaster City Museum.  By the 1980s the gallery was rarely used, but in 1991 a group of local artists re-established it as the Storey Gallery, and delivered a continuous programme of contemporary art until 2013. In 1998 the walled gardens behind the institute were laid out as an art work, The Tasting Garden, by Mark Dion.
