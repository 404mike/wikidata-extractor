In 1993, he published Pet Shop Boys Versus America which was written as he accompanied them on a US tour. He wrote the liner notes to the 2001 reissues of the band's first six albums, and assisted in the compilation of additional songs for inclusion. Alongside Pet Shop Boys, he contributed to the commentary track on the 2003 PopArt DVD. He writes and edits the Pet Shop Boys' fan club magazine, also called Literally, and conducts an interview for each of their tour programmes.\nHe has been a staff writer at Details, Rolling Stone, and most recently, American GQ, for which he has interviewed and written profiles of many celebrities.\nHe is also the author of the best-selling biography of Robbie Williams, Feel (2004), and its follow-up, Reveal (2017).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Pet Shop Boys", "response": ["On 16 October, Catalogue was published by Thames & Hudson, a 336-page hardcover book, written by Philip Hoare and Chris Heath, detailing their entire visual output (photography, as well as the design of albums, videos, concert tours, books and fan club magazines) from 1984 to 2004. Neil Tennant comments in the book: \"In the beginning we made a decision \u2013 and it was in our EMI contract \u2013 that that we would have control over how everything worked; that obviously the songs mattered hugely, but the way they were presented was going to matter hugely as well; and that we were never going to give up on that.\" Pet Shop Boys supported the publication of the book with signings in London, New York City, Los Angeles and Berlin. To coincide with the publication of Catalogue, a small exhibition of portraits of Pet Shop Boys opened in the Bookshop Gallery of London's National Portrait Gallery, on 30 October 2006 and ran to 28 February 2007.", "The duo have always been interested in the artwork, design and photography of their own releases. Photographer Eric Watson helped shape the original image of Pet Shop Boys, creating many of their photographs and videos from 1984 to 1991. In design they have primarily worked with Mark Farrow, who designed the cover of their first Parlophone album release in 1986. The collaboration between Mark Farrow and Pet Shop Boys is comparable to the designer/band relationship of Peter Saville and New Order, Anton Corbijn and Depeche Mode, or the epic-length collaboration of Simon Halfon and Paul Weller. Their record sleeves are quite often very minimal and the attention to detail is obvious. In October 2006, British art publisher Thames & Hudson published a 336-page hardcover book titled Pet Shop Boys Catalogue, by Chris Heath and Philip Hoare, showcasing the group's accomplishments in artwork, design and music. A German-language edition was also published. An exhibition of photographs of Pet Shop Boys was organised at the National Portrait Gallery in London to coincide with the publication."]}, {"page": "List of musicals: A to L", "response": ["| Robbie Williams, Guy Chambers and Chris Heath"]}, {"page": "PopArt: The Hits", "response": ["The DVD also features a commentary by Neil Tennant, Chris Lowe and Chris Heath."]}, {"page": "Smash Hits", "response": ["Smash Hits launched the career of many journalists, including Radio Times editor Mark Frith.
