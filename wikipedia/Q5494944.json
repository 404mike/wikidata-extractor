He attempted to challenge what many saw as a narrowly defined 'mainstream' by creating a book around different strands in radical poetry and four editors who might not otherwise have worked together: \"Their differences, both in the shape they have given their selections and in their introductory remarks, make this a many-sided, exciting, unpredictable - and no doubt contentious book.\" The anthology's multicultural and counter-cultural stance gave it a strong anti-Thatcherite flavour.

The form appears to have declined with Modernism, but has since the 1960s-70s undergone a remarkable revival.
