She and Rupert Brooke had, on her side at least, a passionate relationship. She attended the Slade School of Fine Art and was a suffragette when they met. Their conflicting politics, and his conflicted feelings, led the relationship to end.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Rupert Brooke", "response": ["As part of his recuperation, Brooke toured the United States and Canada to write travel diaries for the Westminster Gazette. He took the long way home, sailing across the Pacific and staying some months in the South Seas. Much later it was revealed that he may have fathered a daughter with a Tahitian woman named Taatamata with whom he seems to have enjoyed his most complete emotional relationship.Mike Read: Forever England (1997) Many more people were in love with him.Biography at GLBTQ encyclopaedia  by Keith Hale, editor of Friends and Apostles: The Correspondence of Rupert Brooke-James Strachey, 1905\u20131914 Brooke was romantically involved with the artist Phyllis Gardner and the actress Cathleen Nesbitt, and was once engaged to No\u00ebl Olivier, whom he met, when she was aged 15, at the progressive Bedales School.", "Another friend and war poet, Patrick Shaw-Stewart, assisted at his hurried funeral. His grave remains there still, with a monument erected by his friend Stanley Casson, poet and archaeologist, who in 1921 published Rupert Brooke and Skyros, a \"quiet essay\", illustrated with woodcuts by Phyllis Gardner."]}, {"page": "Ernest Arthur Gardner", "response": ["Gardner married Mary Wilson (died 1936) in 1887.

Her involvement with Brooke placed her in a further complicated series of triangular relationships, with Brooke's simultaneous attachment to both No\u00ebl Olivier and her sister Brynhild Olivier (Bryn), and Cox with Henry Lamb, who was in turn involved with Lytton Strachey. After Christmas 1911, Brooke travelled to Lulworth in Dorset to be with Ka and her friends, including Henry Lamb. On being told about Lamb, Brooke proposed to Ka, but she refused him and told him she loved Lamb. The breakup between Cox and Brooke is thought to have contributed to Brooke's breakdown in January 1912. However Ka and Brooke were together again by the end of the month, living in Munich during February. They continued to see each other and in late 1912 she was pregnant and had a miscarriage, or possibly stillbirth. Ka contemplated marriage, but both Lamb and Brooke were turning elsewhere, Brooke continuing to pursue both No\u00ebl and Bryn, but was firmly resisted. There were at least five other women in Brooke's life at this time, Phyllis Gardner, like Gwen Darwin, an art student at the Slade, the actress Cathleen Nesbitt, Elizabeth van Rysselberghe, daughter of the Belgian artist Th\u00e9o van Rysselberghe, Lady Eileen Wellesley, daughter of the 4th Duke of Wellington, and during 1913 a Tahitian woman named Taatamata."]}]}}
