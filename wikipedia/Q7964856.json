Born in Lambeth, south London in 1898, he directed over fifty films between 1919 from the silent era through to 1949 in the sound era. He died in Los Angeles, California in 1984.\nForde was the son of the music hall comedian Tom Seymour. During the 1920s, he was a silent film comedian, acting in a series of shorts before shifting into directing feature films. Emerging as an established film director in the 1930s, he directed films for Gainsborough Pictures and Ealing Studios.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1898", "response": ["* April 21 \u2013 Walter Forde, British actor, screenwriter and film director (d. 1984)"]}, {"page": "It's That Man Again", "response": ["Before the sixth series began recording, a film version It's That Man Again was released.

Richman had introduced her to Forde at Elstree Studios, but as she was not cast in the film in a notable role, she agreed to deliver one line in it as a favor to Richman for helping with her screen test. Laughton arranged for her to appear in the low-budget musical My Irish Molly (1938), the only film she made under her real name, Maureen FitzSimons. In the film, she plays a woman named Eil\u00e9en O'Shea, who rescues an orphan girl named Molly. Biographer Aubrey Malone stated of it: \"One could argue that O'Hara never looked as enticing as she does in Little Miss Molly, even if she isn't 'Maureen O'Hara' quite yet. She wears no makeup, and there's no Hollywood glamour, but despite (or because of?) that, she is rapturously beautiful. Her accent is thick, which is perhaps why she didn't mention the film much. It also looks as if it were made in the 1920s rather than the 1930s, so primitive are the sets and characters\". Malone added that though the lot was \"ham-fisted\", it is a \"quaint film which O'Hara scholars should view if only to see early evidence of her natural instinct for dramatic timing and scene interpretation\"."]}, {"page": "Never Say Die", "response": ["* Never Say Die (1920 film), British film by Walter Forde"]}, {"page": "Margaret Lockwood", "response": ["| Walter Forde"]}, {"page": "Arnold Ridley", "response": ["*Third Time Lucky, directed by Walter Forde (1931, based on the play Third Time Lucky)", "*The Ghost Train, directed by Walter Forde (1931, based on the play The Ghost Train)", "*The Ghost Train, directed by Walter Forde (1941, based on the play The Ghost Train)"]}, {"page": "Bulldog Drummond", "response": ["| Walter Forde"]}, {"page": "Sidney Gilliat", "response": ["===Walter Forde===", "Gilliat's early screen credits were on films directed by Walter Forde including Red Pearls (1930), Lord Richard in the Pantry (1930), Bed and Breakfast (1930), You'd Be Surprised!
