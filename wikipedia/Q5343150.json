G. Paley (3 September 1823 \u2013 23 January 1895), was an English architect who practised in Lancaster, Lancashire, in the second half of the 19th century.  After leaving school in 1838, he went to Lancaster to become a pupil of Edmund Sharpe, and in 1845 he joined Sharpe as a partner.  Sharpe retired from the practice in 1851, leaving Paley as the sole principal.  In 1868 Hubert Austin joined him as a partner, and in 1886 Paley's son Henry (who was usually known as Harry) also became a partner.  This partnership continued until Edward Paley's death in 1895.\nPaley's major work was the design of new churches, but he also rebuilt, restored, and made additions and alterations to existing churches.  His major new ecclesiastical design was that of St Peter's Church, Lancaster, which became Lancaster Cathedral.  He also carried out secular commissions, mainly on country houses in the north-west of England.  His largest and most important secular work was the Royal Albert Asylum in Lancaster.  When designing churches, Paley mainly used the Gothic Revival style, but in his secular works he employed a greater variety of styles, including Tudor Revival and Scottish Baronial as well as Gothic Revival.\nPaley played little part in the political life of Lancaster, but he was involved with cultural events and sports in the town.  His interests included music and archaeology, and he was involved in archery and rowing.  In addition to designing the Royal Albert Asylum, he served on its committee, as well as being on the committees of local schools and the Mechanics' Institute.  His work tended to be eclipsed in the later part of his career by Austin, and Paley is regarded as having been a competent architect, rather than a great one.", "link_mentions": {}}}
