Led by Tom Parker, Wales overran the English team, scoring a record eight tries against England; Hiddlestone himself not only scored one of the tries, but is also credited as being the central linchpin in the Welsh attack that won the game so comfortably.Smith (1980), pg 205."]}, {"page": "Tommy Rees (rugby)", "response": ["In 1926, Rees was playing for Welsh exile team London Welsh, and after an excellent victory against Cross Keys at Blackheath on 6 March, Rees along with teammates Windsor Lewis and Wick Powell, was selected to face Ireland as part of the 1926 Five Nations Championship.Jones (1985), pg 81. The game was played at St. Helen's, Swansea, with the Welsh team being led by Swansea's Rowe Harding.
