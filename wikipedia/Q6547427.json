Rapper G-Eazy performed a cover of \"Heard 'Em Say\" for BBC Radio 1Xtra Live Lounge on March 15. For the live rendition, G-Eazy enlisted English singer-songwriter Anne-Marie to sing the chorus. His cover is faithful to the original, with the exception of a few censors and the inclusion of the line \"From the Bay, like 40 and Dre.\" A big fan of West's, G-Eazy called him \"the greatest.\" Additionally, an interpolation of \"Heard 'Em Say\" was later for the song \"Charles Brown\" on his fourth studio album, The Beautiful & Damned (2017). During an interlude, G-Eazy delivers lines from the chorus of \"Heard 'Em Say\" in tandem with guest singer Jay Ant. For the first verse, he also again changed West's mention of the city of Chicago and Tim Hardaway into a nod to his Bay Area origins. After asking if she could share a track on Twitter, London-based rapper Little Simz released a freestyle that features her rapping over the instrumental of \"Heard Em Say\" onto SoundCloud on April 12.
