Buddha's teachings tended to promote gender equality as the Buddha held that women had the same spiritual capacities as men did. According to Isaline Blew Horner, women in Buddhist India: \"commanded more respect and ranked as individuals. They enjoyed more independence, and a wider liberty to guide and follow their own lives.\"IB Horner, Women Under Primitive Buddhism, 1930, 82. Buddha gave the same teachings to both sexes, praised various female lay disciples for their wisdom and allowed women to become monastics (Bhikkhunis) at a time when this was seen as scandalous in India, where men dominated the spiritual professions. The two chief female disciples of the Buddha were Khema and Uppalavanna. The Buddha taught that women had the same soteriological potential as men, and that gender had no influence on one's ability to advance spiritually to nirvana. In the early Buddhist texts, female enlightened Arhats are common. Buddhist nuns are however bound by an extra 8 precepts not applicable to Buddhist monks called The Eight Garudhammas. The authenticity of these rules is highly contested; they were supposedly added to the (bhikkhunis) Vinaya \"to allow more acceptance\" of a monastic Order for women, during the Buddha's time but can be interpreted as a form of gender discrimination.On the Apparent Non-historicity of the Eight Garudhammas Story Gender Discrimination and the Pali Canon Alan Sponberg argues that the early Buddhist sangha sought social acceptance through 'institutional androcentrism' as it was dependent on material support from lay society. Because of this Sponberg concludes: \"For all its commitment to inclusiveness at the doctrinal level, institutional Buddhism was not able to (or saw no reason to) challenge prevailing attitudes about gender roles in society.\"Sponberg, Attitudes toward Women and the Feminine in Early Buddhism, 1992 "]}, {"page": "Udumbara (Buddhism)", "response": ["In both the Digha NikayaDN 14, para. 1.8 in Maurice O'C.
