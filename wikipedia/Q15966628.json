She also sang in 1816 in Mart\u00edn y Soler's Una cosa rara and performed the roles of Dorabella and Susanna in Mozart's operas Cos\u00ec fan tutte, and The Marriage of Figaro.Raoul Meloncelli,  Bartolozzi, Lucia Elisabeth, in Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani, volume 6, 1964 (accessible for free online in Treccani.it) She had immediate success in both London and Paris. In the French capital city she occasionally appeared at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Italien and various other theatres. A legend that she performed as a tragic actress at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Fran\u00e7ais playing Camille opposite Fran\u00e7ois-Joseph Talma in Corneille's Horace has however turned out to be untrue. The mistake was the result of a misreading of Talma's M\u00e9moires wherein the actor narrates an episode in 1790 in which a 'Madame Vestris', not Eliza Lucia Vestris who was born several years later, but Fran\u00e7oise-Marie-Rosette Gourgaud, the wife of Angiolo Vestris, and thus a great-aunt-in-law of Eliza Lucia's husband, was once scandalized by Talma's showing up bare-legged on stage in an unusually realistic ancient-Roman costume. It was, in fact, the rehearsal of Voltaire's Brutus, and not of Corneille's Horace. The legend was first stated in 1847, when Madame Vestris was still alive, by Thomas Marshall in his book on British actors and actresses,Marshall, p. 41. and, after being almost held up to ridicule by John Westland Marston in 1888,Marston, II,  pp. 148\u2013149. it was on the contrary taken as true by Joseph Knight in his article on Madame Vestris in the Dictionary of National Biography,New York, Macmillan, 1894, Volume 32, article Mathews, Lucia Elizabeth or Elizabetta (accessible for free on line at Wikisource). and has since been regularly revived by the main following encyclopaedical sources.Such as, for instance, the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, starting from its 1911 eleventh edition (accessible for free online at Internet Archive), the authoritative Enciclopedia dello spettacolo, The New Grove Dictionary of Opera, and the Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani. Finally, the legend has been refuted by modern biographers of Madame Vestris.Appleton, pp. 11\u201312; Williams, p. 34."]}, {"page": "Alfred Austin", "response": ["On Tennyson's death in 1892 it was felt that none of the then living poets, except Algernon Charles Swinburne or William Morris, who were outside consideration on other grounds, was of sufficient distinction to succeed to the laurel crown, and for several years no new poet-laureate was nominated. In the interval the claims of one writer and another were assessed,By, for example, the theatre critic Joseph Knight and others in The Idler: see  but eventually, in 1896, Austin was appointed to the post after Morris had declined it.

Robertson", "response": ["Robertson's farcical sketch The Cantab, staged as an after-piece at the Strand Theatre in February 1861, attracted the attention of a Bohemian literary set, and led to his becoming a member of the Savage, Arundel and Reunion Clubs, where, in the words of his biographer Joseph Knight, \"he enlarged his observation of human nature, and whence he drew some curious types\". Among the up-and-coming writers with whom he mixed were F. C. Burnand, W. S. Gilbert, Tom Hood and Clement Scott. When Byron founded the magazine Fun in 1861, Robertson was a contributor from the outset. Writers for magazines and papers were seldom well paid, and to maintain a modest income Robertson wrote copiously: Pemberton lists a dozen publications to which he contributed in this period, ranging from Beeton's Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine and The Boy's Own Magazine to London Society and The Illustrated Times.Pemberton (1893), p. 84 Success remained elusive, and Robertson considered giving up writing and becoming a tobacconist."]}, {"page": "Jonas Hanway", "response": ["Hanway was the first male Londoner, it is said, to carry an umbrella, (following women who had been using umbrellas since 1705)  and he lived to triumph over all the hackney coachmen who tried to hoot and hustle him down.William John Thoms, John Doran, Henry Frederick Turle, Joseph Knight, Vernon Horace Rendall, Florence Hayllar (1850) Notes and Queries: Umbrellas.

In July 1865 she was brought out at the New Royalty Theatre, London, in the character of Juliet. Her achievement was not considered extraordinary, but it attracted some favourable attention, and she was able to continue with acting. She was a part of a production of The Hugenot Captain by Watts Phillips given by the Princess Theatre on 2 July 1866. Neilson played the role of the heroine Gabrielle de Savigny. In November 1866 she received favourable reviews for her portrayal of Victorine, another character in The Hugenot Captain. This time the play was performed at the Adelphi Theatre. She also played Nelly Armroyd, in Lost in London.
