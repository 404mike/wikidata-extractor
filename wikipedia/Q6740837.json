Researchers  argue that \"the notion that paramilitaries can 'control' local communities is something of a myth\" which ignores the dependence of paramilitaries on their communities and the support for paramilitarism within those communities.  Terrorism researcher Andrew Silke argues that both loyalist and republican paramilitaries are reluctant vigilantes, and that their vigilantism is unrelated to their . Silke argues that paramilitaries engage in vigilantism because both informing and petty crime undermine the terrorist group, the latter because if the paramilitaries' response is not satisfactory, it can erode their local support."]}]}}
