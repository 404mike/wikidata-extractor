He then moved on to Port Vale via Leicester City. He played on loan for Walsall, before signing with Mansfield Town in 1991.

York lost only three home league matches all season, but missed out on promotion after finishing seventh. In the summer of 1986 he sold MacPhail to Bristol City for \u00a315,000, whilst many of the veteran players he signed when he first came to the club were coming to the end of their careers. The 1986\u201387 season was disappointing for York as they were knocked out of the FA Cup by non-League team Caernarfon Town and ended the season in 20th-place. They did though manage to beat Chelsea 1\u20130 in the League Cup, but lost the return fixture at Stamford Bridge 3\u20130.

He played 28 Third Division (renamed the Second Division due to the creation of the Premier League) games in the 1992\u201393 season; he did though play 40 games in total throughout the campaign, as he helped the Vale to win the TNT Tournament, the Football League Trophy, and to reach the play-off final. They beat Stockport County in the Football League Trophy Final, but lost 3\u20130 to West Bromwich Albion in the play-off final. Manager John Rudge ensured his side made up for their failure to win the play-offs by leading them to promotion as the division's runners-up in 1993\u201394. However, injuries soon brought Kent's career to a halt; he fractured his hand in October 1994 and his kneecap the following February and was hospitalised in May 1995 with a back injury; this final injury brought about his early retirement at the end of the 1995\u201396 season.

Rudge switched from a formation of 4\u20134\u20132 to 4\u20133\u20133 and only one defeat followed in the next thirteen league games. As Barnes returned to Manchester, Richard O'Kelly was transferred to Walsall. Cole was replaced by another loanee Dean Holdsworth (from Watford), who found greater success with Vale. However Gary Hamson was forced to retire through injury. A 5\u20130 win over Doncaster Rovers on 2 April helped the Vale into tenth place, giving Vale a faint hope of reaching the play-offs.
