He was under attack by Oswald Boelcke and Erwin B\u00f6hme when they collided, causing Boelcke's death. Two months later, Knight would fall under the guns of Manfred von Richthofen, who had also been in the dogfight when Boelcke was killed.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Oswald Boelcke", "response": ["Though the following day was misty with a cloud layer, the squadron flew four missions during the morning, as well as another later in the day. On the sixth mission of the day, Boelcke and five of his pilots attacked a pair of British airplanes from No. 24 Squadron RFC. Boelcke and B\u00f6hme chased the Airco DH.2 of Captain Arthur Gerald Knight, while Richthofen pursued the other DH.2, flown by Captain Alfred Edwin McKay. McKay evaded Richthofen by crossing behind Knight, cutting off Boelcke and B\u00f6hme. Both of them jerked their planes upward to avoid colliding with McKay. Each was hidden from the other by their aircraft's wings. Neither was aware of the other's position. Just as B\u00f6hme spotted the other plane bobbing up below him, Boelcke's upper left wing brushed the undercarriage of B\u00f6hme's Albatros. The slight impact split the fabric on the wing of Boelcke's Albatros. As the fabric tore away, the wing lost lift, and the stricken plane spiraled down to glide into an impact near a German artillery battery near Bapaume. Although the crash seemed survivable, Boelcke was not wearing his crash helmet, nor was his safety belt fastened. He died of a fractured skull."]}, {"page": "Airco DH.2", "response": ["|Arthur Gerald Knight||8 "]}, {"page": "No. 24 Squadron RAF", "response": ["* Arthur Gerald Knight"]}, {"page": "Arthur Knight", "response": ["*Arthur Gerald Knight (1895\u20131916), Canadian World War I fighter ace"]}, {"page": "List of World War I aces credited with 8 victories", "response": ["|  style=\"background:#e3d9ff;\"|Arthur Gerald Knight"]}, {"page": "Stanley Cockerell", "response": ["Cockerell was granted his Royal Aero Club Pilot's Certificate No. 3271 on 21 July 1916 and became a sergeant pilot with 24 Squadron. He used an Airco DH.2 on 14 September 1916 to share a victory with Arthur Gerald Knight, when they set a Fokker D.II aflame. He scored again on 30 September, again setting his enemy on fire. Cockerell was wounded in the hip on 10 October (the bullet was never removed). He was commissioned a second lieutenant on 27 October 1916. He then took a break until 4 February 1917, when he shared in the destruction of a reconnaissance plane. Two days later, he was the sole destroyer of another reconnaissance plane. On 2 April 1917, he destroyed an Albatros D.III for his fifth victory. He upgraded to an Airco DH.5 on 25 May for his sixth kill, when he destroyed another Albatros D.III. Cockerell was then withdrawn to England to serve in Home Defence squadrons at Hornchurch. He was appointed a flight commander on 1 September 1917, with the temporary rank of captain. He returned to France in July 1918 with 151 Squadron. On 4 August, while flying a Sopwith Camel in the squadron's night intruder role, he bombed the German aerodrome at Guizancourt. A Gotha bomber subsequently attempted a recovery at the field, and Cockerell destroyed it for his seventh consecutive victory."]}, {"page": "List of aerial victories of Manfred von Richthofen", "response": ["| Capt.Arthur Gerald Knight, DSO \u2020"]}, {"page": "December 1916", "response": ["* German flying ace Manfred von Richthofen (nicknamed the Red Baron) shot down and killed British flying ace Arthur Gerald Knight in an act of vengeance for Knight causing the mid-air collision that killed German ace Oswald Boelcke on October 28."]}, {"page": "List of World War I flying aces from the British Empire", "response": ["* Arthur Gerald Knight"]}]}}
