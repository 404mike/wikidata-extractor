Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark: Messages. Sidgwick & Jackson. 1987. . pp. 126\u2013132. Keyboardist Paul Humphreys explained, \"We'd pushed the envelope too far and we were scared. We'd bought houses, had a management company, crew, we had financial responsibilities and we panicked. We decided to rely on our songwriting craft... and write a few hits.\" The band elected not to record in their own Gramophone Suite studio in Liverpool; instead, Humphreys and singer Andy McCluskey wrote and demoed songs separately at home. Neither man satisfied with the results of this new approach, OMD regrouped, working at Highland Studios in Inverness for three weeks. The band trialed some of the new compositions on a September 1983 UK club tour, with Howard Jones as support. Afterwards, they recorded with producer Brian Tench at both Chapel Studios in Lincolnshire, and Mayfair Studios in London. In contrast to the arduous Dazzle Ships era, recording sessions were positive and the group were writing prolifically."]}, {"page": "Human's Lib", "response": ["Human's Lib is the debut album by the British pop musician Howard Jones.
