Upon discharge, he returned to duty in Northern France.\nOn 26 August 1917, east of Hargicourt, France, Day was in command of a bombing section detailed to clear a maze of trenches still held by the enemy; this he did, killing two machine gunners and taking four prisoners. Immediately after he returned to his section, a stick bomb fell into a trench occupied by five men, one badly wounded. The corporal seized the bomb and threw it over the trench where it immediately exploded. He afterwards completed the clearing of the trench and established himself in an advanced position, remaining for 66 hours at his post, which came under intense fire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of English Victoria Cross recipients", "response": ["|Sidney James Day || British Army || 1917 || First World War || Hargicourt"]}, {"page": "Suffolk Regiment", "response": ["* Corporal Sidney James Day, First World War (26 August 1917)"]}, {"page": "Sidney J.
