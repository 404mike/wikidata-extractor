From there, Nasr discovered the works of other Perennialist metaphysicians, notably Ananda Coomaraswamy, Frithjof Schuon, Titus Burckhardt, Martin Lings, and Marco Pallis. This school of thought has shaped Nasr's life and thinking ever since. The widow of Commaraswamy gave him access to the library of her late husband, and Nasr spent much of his time and there and worked to catalogue the library. He visited Schuon and Burckhardt in Switzerland while still a student and was initiated into the Alawi branch of the Shadhili Sufi order. He considered the works of Schuon, with central importance given to the practice of a spiritual discipline in addition to doctrinal knowledge, especially instrumental in determining his intellectual and spiritual life.

According to the Traditionalist School, orthodox religions are based on a singular metaphysical origin. According to the Traditionalist School, the \"philosophia perennis\" designates a worldview that is opposed to the scientism of modern secular societies and which promotes the rediscovery of the wisdom traditions of the pre-secular developed world. This view is exemplified by Rene Guenon in The Reign of Quantity and the Signs of the Times, one of the founding works of the traditionalist school."]}, {"page": "Traditionalist School (perennialism)", "response": ["The principal authors of this school of thought are Ren\u00e9 Gu\u00e9non, Ananda Coomaraswamy and Frithjof Schuon.

The outcome of that visit was that he hosted, at his farm in Kent, the Betteshanger Summer School and Conference, the first biodynamic farming conference to be held in Britain.

I have never known the ideas and practices involved under any other name\u201d.  While he is certainly one of the central figures of the early organic movement, it is arguable that Albert Howard was of greater importance. Northbourne published Look to the Land in 1940, which raises many of the issues current to discussions of organic agriculture. After reading Look to the Land, the philosopher and author Marco Pallis contacted Northbourne and later introduced him to the writings of the Traditionalist (also known as Perennialist) philosophy.
