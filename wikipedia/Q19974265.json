Percy Charles Wyndham. He was educated at Westminster School from 1767 to 1775, and in 1801 he married Lady Anna Barbara Frances Child Villiers, daughter of the 4th Earl of Jersey and widow of William Henry Lambton of Lambton, County Durham. They had no children. According to some, he \"proposed marriage to a gentlewoman one day, married her the next and parted from her the day after\" so offspring would have been unlikely.At the 1790 general election Charles and his older brother Percy were returned as the two Members of Parliament (MPs) for Midhurst, a pocket borough in West Sussex which had recently been purchased by their oldest brother George, the 3rd Earl of Egremont.Wyndham gave up the Midhurst seat in 1795, shortly before his brother sold it, in order to sit for New Shoreham. He held that seat until 1802, when his brother persuaded him to stand for the county seat of Sussex. He held that seat until he stood down in 1812.", "link_mentions": {}}}
