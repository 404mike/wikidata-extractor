In 1950, Luard joined the Foreign Service and after learning Chinese he was stationed in Peking from 1952 to 1954. In 1956 he resigned from the diplomatic service in protest at Britain's involvement in the Suez Crisis.\nHe became a research fellow at St Antony's College, Oxford in 1957 where he was able to research Chinese relations with Britain. He was a Labour councillor on Oxford City Council 1958\u201361.\nHaving first contested the seat in 1964, Luard was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Oxford in 1966. He served as the Labour Party MP for Oxford from 1966 to 1970 and again from October 1974 to 1979. He was the only Labour member ever to represent the constituency in its original form. He served as a Parliamentary Under Secretary of State in the Foreign Office from 1969 till 1970 and again from 1976 until Labour left power in 1979.\nLuard joined the SDP soon after its formation, and contested the 1983 General election for the party in the newly formed constituency of Oxford West and Abingdon. He was de-selected in 1987 in favour of Chris Huhne.\nLuard is mainly known for his extensive writings on numerous aspects of international relations. He is also known for his sociological theories including the hierarchy theory. His exhaustive study of war, War in International Society: A Study in International Sociology, was published in Britain in 1986 and by Yale University Press in the United States in 1987. An account of his life and work appeared in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography in 2004.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1979 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Evan Luard"]}, {"page": "1970 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["*Evan Luard (Oxford)"]}, {"page": "October 1974 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Evan Luard"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the October 1974 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Evan Luard"]}, {"page": "Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs", "response": ["|Evan Luard", "|Evan Luard"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1966 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Evan Luard"]}, {"page": "Montague Woodhouse, 5th Baron Terrington", "response": ["He was defeated by Evan Luard in the 1966 Labour landslide and then worked at the Confederation of British Industry until 1970, when he was once again returned to Parliament for Oxford.

Sociologist Ludo de Witte described Kasa-Vubu's dismissal order as \"clearly not constitutional\" and labeled the invoked Article 22 as a \"totally obsolete\" provision which could only be resolved \"by a law or revision of the constitution, passed by a parliament with confidence in Lumumba.\" International relations scholar Evan Luard wrote, \"Of Kasa-Vubu's move [...] it can reasonably be said that by the way he used his power without referring to Parliament amounted to an abuse of the constitution\". Historians Emmanuel Gerard and Bruce Kuklick noted that in August 1960 Baudouin, operating within the confines of the extremely similar Belgian Constitution, had asked Prime Minister Eyskens to resign, but that Eyskens, having a solid parliamentary majority, refused and retained his office. However, the relevant article was never formally invoked in the king's request. Bomboko released a statement in late September that asserted that while \"normally\" a government under the constitution would be unseated by a censure from Parliament, \"On occasion [the President] can revoke a government when this measure is deemed necessary for any grave reason. In this case, the Parliament is not, and cannot, be invited to vote its confidence or lack of confidence in the government.\" Hoskyns wrote, \"From a legal point of view it would seem therefore that Kasa-Vubu's initial action was in accordance at least with the letter of the Loi Fondamentale\"."]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom MPs who died in the 1990s", "response": ["|Evan Luard"]}]}}
