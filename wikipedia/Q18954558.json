After leaving school, he worked in the printing office of John Haddon in Finsbury and then as a tutor until the age of nineteen. He matriculated in 1840 at the Baptist College, Stepney to prepare for the Baptist ministry and graduated in 1843 with a B.A. from the University of London.\nHe served two churches, High Wycombe (1845\u20131847) and Tauton (1947\u20131851), before taking a position at the Yorkshire Baptist College (Rawdon) as tutor in classics (1851\u20131863). In 1863, Green became principal at the college, serving until 1876.\nIn 1876 Green came to London to serve as editor, and in 1881 as editorial secretary, of the Religious Tract Society. Thenceforth his main energies were devoted to literary work, in which towards the end of his long life he was aided by his elder son, Prof. S. W. Green. His most important work was his Handbook to the Grammar of the Greek Testament, published in 1870 (revised editions in 1880, 1885, 1892, and 1904), which was followed in 1894 by a primer which had also a wide circulation. A companion volume on the Hebrew of the Old Testament appeared in 1901.\nGreen was the editorial secretary of the Religious Tract Society until 1891. In 1900 the University of St Andrews bestowed upon him the honorary degree of D.D. He was the author of eighteen books.He married in 1848.
