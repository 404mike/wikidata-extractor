Originally signed to partner Francis Lee and Wyn Davies, when both players quickly left, Byrom became the senior striker. As Bolton moved between the second and third divisions of English football, he scored 130 goals in his ten years at Burnden Park, including twenty when Bolton won the Third Division title in 1973, before moving back to Blackburn for a final season, retiring in 1977 with a knee injury.\nThe Bolton fans' song for him was \"Someone scored a goal, John Byrom\" to the tune of cumbaya.\nOn retiring, he took many jobs including driving, sweeping and selling cars before finally setting up his own gas cylinder business, from which he retired in the mid-1990s. He now lives in the Ribble Valley.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1969\u201370 Football League", "response": ["|2||align=left|  John Byrom ||align=left| Bolton Wanderers ||20||0||5||\u2014||25"]}, {"page": "List of Bolton Wanderers F.C. seasons", "response": ["|John Byrom", "|John ByromRoy Greaves", "|John Byrom", "|John Byrom"]}, {"page": "1964\u201365 Football League First Division", "response": ["|align=center| =|| John Byrom || Blackburn Rovers ||align=center| 25"]}, {"page": "John Byrom (disambiguation)", "response": ["John Byrom may refer to:", "* John Byrom (1692\u20131763), English poet, inventor of a shorthand system", "* John Byrom (footballer) (b. 1944), English footballer", "* John Byrom (cricketer) (1851-1931), English cricketer", "* John Byrom (swimmer) (born 1947), Australian swimmer"]}]}}
