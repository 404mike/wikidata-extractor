The Vichy government, itself heavily engaged in collaboration, arrested around 2,000 individuals on charges of passing information to the Germans. Their reasons for doing so was to centralise collaboration to ensure that the state maintained a monopoly in Franco-German relations and to defend sovereignty so that they could negotiate from a position of strength. It was among the many compromises that the government engaged along the way.

Paillole took control of a clandestine counter-espionage network which operated from Marseille under the codename \u2018Travaux Ruraux\u2019 (TR- \u2018Rural Works\u2019). Recent research by the British historian Simon Kitson has shown that contrary to the version presented by secret service veterans this network was not operating in opposition to the Vichy government.*Simon Kitson, Vichy et la chasse aux espions Nazis, Paris, Autrement, 2005", "*Simon Kitson, The Hunt for Nazi Spies, Fighting Espionage in Vichy France, Chicago & London, University of Chicago Press, 2008  Vichy officials were informed from November 1940 of the location of the headquarters of this network and the arrest of German agents as a result of TR  activity was actively supported by the structures of the official state: police, prisons, courts, armistice commissions. Although Vichy itself was collaborating extensively with the German forces occupying Northern France, Vichy leaders were keen to preserve their autonomy and to centralize collaboration. The work of Paillole\u2019s services served to defend sovereignty and to prevent unauthorised individual acts of collaboration on the part of ordinary French citizens.", "Kitson has also presented documentation showing that Paillole told associates in 1942 that although Germany was \u2018enemy number one\u2019 Britain was \u2018enemy number two\u2019.Simon Kitson, The Hunt for Nazi Spies, Fighting Espionage in Vichy France, Chicago & London, University of Chicago Press, 2008, p 69 Trusted by Vichy, Paillole was appointed as head of a new clandestine counter-espionage structure, the Service de S\u00e9curit\u00e9 Militaire, established by Pierre Laval and Admiral Darlan in August 1942. Nevertheless, during this same 2-year period, 1940\u20131942, Paillole also did provide a limited amount of information to the Allies and offered help to those Resisters personally known to himself, such as Henri Frenay.", "After the war Paillole devoted much energy to defending the reputation of his services trying to show that they were pro-Allied from the outset and engaged in unambiguous Resistance. In 1953, he set up a secret service veterans\u2019 association, the Amicale des Anciens des Services Sp\u00e9ciaux de la D\u00e9fense Nationale, which published a regularly bulletin relating acts of counter-espionage heroism during the occupation. Paillole also donated a personal collection of archives to the historical archives service of the army, the Service Historique de l\u2019Arm\u00e9e de Terre (SHAT),*Fonds priv\u00e9 colonel Paillole, Service historique de l'arm\u00e9e de terre, cote 1 K 545 although Kitson has suggested that this collection has been purged of virtually all reference to the anti-Allied activity of the counter-espionage service.See the introduction of Simon Kitson's Vichy et la chasse aux espions Nazis, Paris, Autrement, 2005 Whilst other archival sources were in short supply Paillole\u2019s representation of events was accepted unquestioningly by some historians. Indeed, the historian Philip John Stead, whose account of counter-espionage during the occupation period owed much to Paillole, even made a virtue of donating the royalties of his book to Paillole\u2019s veterans\u2019 association.Philip John Stead, Second Bureau, London, Evans Brothers, 1959  As archives about the period have become more available a more critical eye has been cast on Paillole\u2019s version. The publication of Paillole\u2019s memoirs in 1975 infuriated some resisters such as Toussaint Raffini, who had suffered arrest as a result of information made available to the Vichy police by the Travaux Ruraux network.* Robert Belot, La R\u00e9sistance sans de Gaulle, Paris, Fayard, 2006, pp 277-279"]}, {"page": "Vichy France", "response": ["Vichy's claim to be the legitimate French government was denied by Free France and by all subsequent French governments after the war. They maintain that Vichy was an illegal government run by traitors, having come to power through an unconstitutional coup d'\u00e9tat. P\u00e9tain was constitutionally appointed prime minister by President Lebrun on 16 June 1940 and he was legally within his rights to sign the armistice with Germany; however, his decision to ask the National Assembly to dissolve itself while granting him dictatorial powers has been more controversial. Historians have particularly debated the circumstances of the vote by the National Assembly of the Third Republic granting full powers to P\u00e9tain on 10 July 1940. The main arguments advanced against Vichy's right to incarnate the continuity of the French state were based on the pressure exerted by Pierre Laval, a former prime minister in the Third Republic, on the deputies in Vichy and on the absence of 27 deputies and senators who had fled on the ship Massilia and so could not take part in the vote. However, during the war, the Vichy government was internationally recognised,Peter Jackson & Simon Kitson \u2018The paradoxes of foreign policy in Vichy France\u2019 in Jonathan Adelman(ed), Hitler and his Allies, London, Routledge, 2007 notably by the United States and several other major Allied powers./ Australia's diplomatic relationships with Vichy: French embassy in AustraliaCanada's diplomatic relationships with Vichy: Foreign Affairs Canada . Diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom had been severed since 8 July 1940 after the attack on Mers-el-K\u00e9bir.", "Historians distinguish between state collaboration followed by the Vichy regime, and \"collaborationists\", who were private French citizens eager to collaborate with Germany and who pushed towards a radicalisation of the regime. P\u00e9tainistes, on the other hand, were direct supporters of Marshal P\u00e9tain rather than of Germany (although they accepted P\u00e9tain's state collaboration). State collaboration was sealed by the Montoire (Loir-et-Cher) interview in Hitler's train on 24 October 1940, during which P\u00e9tain and Hitler shook hands and agreed on co-operation between the two states. Organized by Pierre Laval, a strong proponent of collaboration, the interview and the handshake were photographed and exploited by Nazi propaganda to gain the support of the civilian population. On 30 October 1940, P\u00e9tain made state collaboration official, declaring on the radio: \"I enter today on the path of collaboration.\" On 22 June 1942, Laval declared that he was \"hoping for the victory of Germany\". The sincere desire to collaborate did not stop the Vichy government from organising the arrest and even sometimes the execution of German spies entering the Vichy zone.Simon Kitson, The Hunt for Nazi Spies, Fighting Espionage in Vichy France.
