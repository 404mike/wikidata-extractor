He was commissioned in 1944 into the 5th Battalion, the Welsh Guards. He served in Palestine and Egypt, and joined the British Forces Broadcasting Service in Jerusalem. He later helped start up the BBC Overseas News station in Mombasa, Kenya.\nAfter leaving the army, he failed to get a job as a BBC Radio announcer, but joined BBC Television as an announcer in March 1952 after a trial at Alexandra Palace, then the base of BBC Television. He joined the team of continuity announcers headed by McDonald Hobley and Sylvia Peters. He went on to present Come Dancing and Picture Parade, a film review programme in 1956 with co-presenter Derek Bond, the actor.\nIn 1958, he provided the BBC commentary for the Eurovision Song Contest, staged that year in Hilversum, Netherlands. He also provided the BBC radio commentary for the contest in 1962. He also presented a number of programmes on the BBC Light Programme including Movie-Go-Round on Sunday afternoons from 1956 to 1969.Although he fitted well into the style of 1950s BBC Television, with the changing style of TV after the introduction of commercial television in 1955, his career declined, and his first marriage broke up. In 1957 he had married the 1950s film star Jill Adams. The couple had a daughter, Peta Louise.\nFrom the early 1970s, he lived in Portugal running a restaurant and bar popular with British tourists, and met his German-born second wife, Inge. They returned to the UK in the 1980s but he could not resume his broadcasting career. He made a final television appearance as guest of Des Lynam on a series called It's My Pleasure. He later worked occasionally for BBC radio and did voice-overs for advertisements.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Eurovision Song Contest 1958", "response": ["| Peter Haigh"]}, {"page": "Eurovision Song Contest 1962", "response": ["| Peter Haigh"]}, {"page": "BBC Light Programme", "response": ["* Peter Haigh"]}, {"page": "Witchfinder General (film)", "response": ["*Other cast members include Nicky Henson as Trooper Robert Swallow, Wilfrid Brambell as Master Loach, Tony Selby as Salter, Bernard Kay as Fisherman, Godfrey James as Webb, Michael Beint as Captain Gordon, John Treneman as Harcourt, Bill Maxwell as Gifford, Morris Jar as Paul, Maggie Kimberly as Elizabeth, Peter Haigh as Lavenham Magistrate, Hira Talfrey as Hanged Woman, Ann Tirard as Old Woman, Peter Thomas as Farrier, Edward Palmer as Shepherd, David Webb as Jailer, Lee Peters as Sergeant, David Lyell as Footsoldier, Alf Joint as Sentry, Martin Terry as Hoxne Innkeeper, Jack Lynn as Brandeston Innkeeper, Beaufoy Milton as Priest, Dennis Thorne and Michael Segal as Villagers, Toby Lennon as Old Man, Margaret Nolan (billed as Maggie Nolan), Sally Douglas and Donna Reading as Inn Girls, and Derek Ware."]}, {"page": "Aldenham School", "response": ["*Peter Haigh (1925\u20132001), BBC Television presenter"]}, {"page": "Open House (1964 TV series)", "response": ["Open House was a 1964 BBC TV series presented by Gay Byrne, Peter Haigh and Robert Robinson.
