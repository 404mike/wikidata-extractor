Prior to his conversion to Mormonism, Parry was a Campbellite minister and was the leader of a church in Newmarket called \"John Parry's Association\", which was fashioned after the teachings of Alexander Campbell. In 1846, Parry and his wife Mary Williams were baptized by Mormon missionaries. About the Parrys, one commentator has stated that they were \"in all likelihood the most distinguished of the Welsh to join the Church up to that time, and [their conversion] caused great excitement among other Welsh Mormons\".In 1849, Parry and about 100 Welsh Mormons sailed from Liverpool to America. Upon arriving in Council Bluffs, Iowa, on May 17, 1849 Mary Parry died of cholera. Parry continued the Mormon pioneer journey to Utah Territory and arrived later in 1849.\nAt the October 1849 general conference of the LDS Church, Parry conducted 85 Welsh converts in singing several musical numbers. After the conference, church president Brigham Young invited Parry to formally organize a church choir that could provide music at future church conferences. Parry thus proceeded to organize what would later be called the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. Parry was the conductor of the choir until 1854, when he was succeeded by Stephen Goddard.Like many early Latter Day Saints, Parry practiced plural marriage. In 1851, he married Patty Bartlett Sessions, and over the next two years he would marry Grace Ann Williams\u2014a sister of his deceased wife Mary\u2014and Harriet Parry, one of his first cousins. Parry was the father of 12 children.\nParry died in Salt Lake City and was buried there.\nEdwin F. Parry, a son of John Parry, was a Mormon hymnwriter.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Parry", "response": ["John Parry may refer to:", "*John Parry (Bardd Alaw) (1776\u20131851), Welsh harpist and composer, and father of John Orlando Parry", "*John Parry (harpist) (c1710\u20131782), celebrated blind harpist from Wales", "*John Parry (Mormon) (1789\u20131868), early Welsh convert to Mormonism and first conductor of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir", "*John Orlando Parry (1810\u20131879), Welsh singer-pianist and comedian, and son of John Parry (Bardd Alaw)", "* John Parry, member of Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band", "*John Parry (1518-1584), MP for Carmarthen Boroughs (UK Parliament constituency)", "*John Parry (1724\u20131797), Welsh Member of Parliament for Caernarvonshire 1780\u201390 ", "*John Parry (American football official) (born 1965), National Football League game official from 2000 to 2018", "*John Parry (golfer) (born 1986), English professional golfer", "*John Parry (bishop) (died 1677), Bishop of Ossory 1672\u20131677", "*John Parry (editor) (1812\u20131817) Welsh editor of the Encyclopaedia Cambrensis"]}, {"page": "1868 in Wales", "response": ["*13 January \u2013 John Parry, Mormon convert, 79"]}, {"page": "John Parry (conductor)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Parry (Mormon)"]}, {"page": "List of Tabernacle Choir music directors", "response": ["The music director of The Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square is responsible for musical and creative supervision of the Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square, the Orchestra at Temple Square, the Temple Square Chorale, and the Bells on Temple Square, which are all official musical organizations within The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).
