He didn't. He just blew what he was told by the person who did write it, Gerry Rafferty.\" Michael Gray, Rafferty's former manager, agreed: \"The audible proof is there from the demos that Rafferty himself created the riff and placed it within the song's structure exactly where it ended up.\" Ravenscroft went on to play on Rafferty's next two albums.", "A requiem mass was held for Rafferty at St Mirin's Cathedral in his native town of Paisley on 21 January 2011.
