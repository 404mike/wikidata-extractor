He was born at Ottery St Mary, Devon and died at Whitechapel, London. \nA right-handed lower-order batsman and a right-arm medium-paced bowler, Reed played for the Gentlemen of Somerset team from 1871 and for Somerset in pre-first-class matches across the 1870s. In 1882, when some of Somerset's games were retrospectively accorded first-class status, he played half a dozen matches and in the first of them, against Hampshire at Southampton, he took four first-innings wickets for 35 runs in 28 four-ball overs, and these remained his best bowling figures. He did not play at all in 1883 but returned for a few games in 1884 and in the Hampshire fixture at Southampton he again did well, scoring an unbeaten 57 in the first innings, though Somerset lost the match heavily after conceding 645 in Hampshire's only innings.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Francis Reed (1882\u20131884) 10 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Ted Sainsbury", "response": ["Sainsbury added himself to the list of early Somerset centurions during 1878, hitting 105 while batting at number 6 against Hertfordshire. In doing so, he batted for over four hours, and shared an eighth wicket partnership of 114 with Francis Reed, out of a Somerset total of 249. His bowling was also on form during the match, and after collecting two wickets in the first innings, he claimed five in the second. The Somerset side during the late 1870s reflected the strength of the Lansdown club: of the eleven players that represented Somerset in their match against the Marylebone Cricket Club in early August 1878, five of them also represented Lansdown when the London club travelled down to Bath. In between these two matches against the MCC, Sainsbury scored a half-century for Somerset during their match against Devon. Toward the end of August, Sainsbury's bowling once again came to the fore, as he claimed five wickets in the first innings against Worcestershire to help defend Somerset's lead and propel them to an innings victory. He once again led the Somerset batting averages, scoring 211 runs at an average of 35.16, while his 13 wickets were the second most in the team, at an average of 9.69."]}, {"page": "Somerset County Cricket Club in 1884", "response": ["! scope=\"row\" | Francis Reed "]}, {"page": "Francis Reed", "response": ["Francis Reed may refer to:", "* Francis Reed (cricketer) (1850\u20131912), English cricketer", "* Francis Reed (inventor) (1852\u20131917), American inventor"]}, {"page": "Somerset County Cricket Club in 1882", "response": ["Facing Hampshire in Southampton for the third match, Somerset won the toss and opted to bat first. The pitch was soft, due to the heavy rainfall through the morning, and play started shortly after midday. Sainsbury was yet again one of few Somerset players to reach double figures, and they were bowled out for 101. Cecil Currie, a spin bowler for Hampshire, collected eight of the wickets. Somerset managed to restrict Hampshire's lead to 46 runs; Francis Reed took four wickets, and Fothergill three. Fowler and Fothergill were Somerset's most successful batsmen in their second innings, played mostly in light rain, helping the county to reach 118 runs. That left Hampshire requiring 73 runs to win, which the hosts achieved without losing any wickets, to beat Somerset with ten wickets to spare.", "The Somerset team travelled to Lord's in London in early August to face the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). Somerset batted first after winning the toss, but lost three batsmen for ducks early in the innings. Somerset's captain, Newton \u2013 playing his first match of the season for the county, batted for the rest of the innings to score 57 runs, and shared a large partnership with Francis Reed. The MCC started well in their innings, but the introduction of Fowler into the bowling attack brought their batting to a quick conclusion; Fowler took four wickets while only conceding eight runs, and claimed a hat-trick by bowling Edward Hawtrey, Charles Burke and Thomas Mycroft in successive deliveries. Somerset had a 25-run lead going into the second innings, in which Newton once again top-scored. In addition to his total of 67, Lyonel Hildyard made an unbeaten 59, and Fowler scored 23 runs from just six scoring shots, including a six which went out of the ground. The Western Daily Press described Fowler as \"possibly the hardest hitter amongst English cricketers\", while his history of the county, David Foot suggests that Fowler was \"perhaps the earliest Somerset batsman to parade the fundamental skills of slogging.\" Somerset totalled 219, to leave the MCC needing to score 245 runs to win. Principally due to the batting of John Russel, the MCC reached the target, but only had one wicket remaining; Fothergill having taken five wickets and Charles Winter four."]}]}}
