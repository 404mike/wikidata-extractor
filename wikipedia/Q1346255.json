The group initially had a concept of making each song sound completely different, without regard to whether or not the material could be performed in concert. Melody Maker described the result as \"a kaleidoscope of sound and imagery, new forms, and content, flashing before our eyes\". Kaleidoscope was a commercial success, peaking at number 5 in the UK albums chart.

Frusciante wanted an album of two different types of songs: songs that were more \"English-sounding\" and melodic, and songs that were more influenced by punk rock. Frusciante's punk inspiration came from listening to music by The Damned and Discharge, among others.RHCP, Mullen 2010. p. 210 Rick Rubin was not familiar with the latter bands and sound and thought that the melodic songs were original and more exciting, causing the band to focus mostly on the melodic material. However, one punk rock-influenced song was recorded during these sessions, \"Body of Water,\" but did not make the final cut and was instead included on \"The Zephyr Song\" single. Many of the more melodic inspired songs came from Frusciante listening to The Beach Boys and The Beatles, along with doo-wop groups and their harmonies. Frusciante said he listened to Emerson, Lake & Palmer every day during the recording of By the Way. These new styles as well as Frusciante being especially prolific during this era came to alienate bassist Flea, who had wanted the band to return to its earlier funk-influenced sound. Frusciante felt the band had already thoroughly explored funk and was more interested in creating something new for the band. According to Kiedis, Flea felt his voice wasn't being heard, and there was a point where he considered leaving the band. While speaking to Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet, Frusciante mentioned that he listened to guitarists such as John McGeoch for his work on the Magazine's and Siouxsie and the Banshees' albums including Juju, Adrian Fisher of Sparks for Kimono My House, Johnny Marr of the Smiths, Vini Reilly of the Durutti Column and Keith Levene of Public Image Limited. He also credits XTC singer/guitarist Andy Partridge in the 2002 issue of Total Guitar for being an influence on his guitar work for the album."]}, {"page": "The Glove", "response": ["In October 1982, when playing two one-off shows in Madrid, Banshees guitarist John McGeoch had a nervous breakdown due to alcohol and the stresses of recording and touring, and was fired by the band returning home, shortly before the start of an important European tour.

He had previously played live with the Banshees in 1979 on their Join Hands tour, when he replaced their guitarist John McKay, the latter had walked out at the start of the tour.
