He was in the club's championship winning team of 1936 and took 555 wickets overall.\nPope was born at Tibshelf, Derbyshire and began work as a coal miner at the age of 14. Between 1923 and 1926, he was playing for the Tibshelf colliery cricket club which played in the Bassetlaw League and the Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Collieries League. In 1925 at the age of 16, he was one of the scorers in a Derbyshire match at the County Ground. He joined Samuel Cadman's nursery at Derbyshire during the General Strike of 1926.Pope made his debut for Derbyshire the 1930 season in May against Middlesex taking 3 wickets in total and finishing not out in the only innings he played. He played one more match that year, and twice in the 1931 season taking a reasonable wicket toll in all matches. In the 1932 season he started playing the full season and achieved two five wicket innings with 6 for 54 against Nottinghamshire. In the 1933 season he achieved 7 for 84 against Sussex and in the 1934 season he took 6 for 21 against Nottinghamshire. He managed five 5 wicket innings in the 1935 season, two of them in one match against Hampshire giving him a 10 wicket match total. In Derbyshire's Championship winning season of 1936 Pope achieved four 5 five wicket innings with 6 for 129 and 11 wickets in the whole match against Northamptonshire. As his brother George was unavailable to bowl in the season, his captain Arthur Richardson, would warn him he might have to bowl until close of play. Pope would respond cheerfully with \"I like bowling, skipper\".With his brother back in the 1937 season he shared the honours again, but achieved 5\u201385 against Kent. In the 1938 season he had four 5 wicket innings with a best of 6 for 48 against Sussex. He also made his top run score of 103 runs in 1938 against Warwickshire.

He was a right-arm off-break and right-arm fast-medium bowler who took 555 first-class wickets at an average of 22.54 and a best performance of 7 for 84. He took 5 or more wickets in 22 innings, and took 10 wickets in 3 matches.In 1940 and 1941 Pope appeared in matches for the Bradford League and in 1941 with Bill Copson took Saltaire to the Bradford League title. He and Copson were signed for Windhill Cricket Club for the 1942 season. He played games for the North of England in 1942 and a non-status game for Derbyshire in 1945.\nFollowing the war Pope took a number of coaching ad professional jobs. He was at one time employed as a P. E. Instructor at St Joseph's College, Blackpool where he lived in Cleveleys and cycled to work. Pupils' recollections refer to Alf Pope \u2013 a \"cricketer\" and his punishments with his favourite cricket bat. He then spent twenty years coaching and as groundsman at Berkhamsted School.Pope umpired one first-class match in 1951. He reappeared at Derbyshire in 1954 playing a couple of games for the club and ground. By 1957 he was coaching at Chesham Cricket Club where he coached Mike Taylor.Pope died at Derby at the age of 86. His brothers George Pope and Harold Pope followed him into the Derbyshire team. His son Anthony played for Derbyshire 2nd XI and in various non-status matches for the MCC.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Derbyshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["From this point up to 1925, Derbyshire were perennially among the weakest counties, losing every single match in 1920 despite the efforts of Sam Cadman and Arthur Morton, persevering professionals. From 1926, the nucleus of a good team emerged around some doughty batting from Denis Smith, Stan Worthington and George Pope. Pope's bowling and that of his brother Alf, leg spinner Tommy Mitchell and seam bowler Bill Copson took the team to their one and so far only Championship victory in 1936. They won 13 of their 28 matches outright and five on first innings. Worthington, Les Townsend, Smith and Alderman all passed 1,000 runs and Copson and Mitchell took over 100 wickets, with Alf Pope taking 94. Charlie Elliott, who later became a Test umpire and selector, was another member of this team which was captained by AW Richardson."]}, {"page": "George Pope (cricketer)", "response": ["Pope was born at Tibshelf, Derbyshire, and followed his older brother Alf Pope into the Derbyshire side in 1933. He made his debut in an innings victory against Worcestershire and played one more first-class match that season. He became a regular player in 1934 and 1935. In 1936 a cartilage injury early in the season caused him to miss all but a handful of matches in the county's County Championship-winning side. He returned in 1937 and scored more than 1,000 runs with 92 wickets, and toured India with Lord Tennyson's XI in 1937\u201338."]}, {"page": "Harold Pope (cricketer)", "response": ["Pope's brothers were onetime Test cricketer George, who played for Derbyshire for fifteen years, and Alf Pope, who played first-class cricket for nine years."]}, {"page": "Arthur Walker Richardson", "response": ["Richardson was born at Quarndon, Derbyshire. He was educated at Winchester College and in a match against Harrow School scored 117 for the Winchester XI in a partnership of 295.Wisden Obituaries 1983 At the start of the 1928 season he made his debut for Derbyshire against the West Indies. In his first three seasons he managed a highest score of 70 and his best seasonal average was 25. He became Derbyshire captain in the 1931 season and led his team to 7th in the points table.

Alf Pope made his first class debut for Derbyshire in the season and went on the play until 1939, making his main contribution as a bowler.  John Gilbert also made his debut and played  occasional games for Derbyshire until 1936."]}, {"page": "History of English cricket from 1919 to 1939", "response": ["Derbyshire had a disastrous season in 1920, losing seventeen of their eighteen matches, and struggled for most of the 1920s with another winless season in 1924. Gradually, they assembled a strong team and, by 1927, they had a decent side which finished fifth and commanded respect. Harry Elliott, Jim Hutchinson and Harry Storer junior all made their debuts in 1920 and, over the next five years, the team welcomed Leslie Townsend, Stan Worthington and Garnet Lee. Denis Smith, who has one of the longest first-class careers on record, first appeared in 1927. Albert Alderman began in 1928 and then the team really took shape as Derbyshire discovered Tommy Mitchell, Alf Pope, Bill Copson, Charlie Elliott and George Pope. From 1928 to 1933, the team was always in mid-table.", "The team finally realised its potential and finished third behind Lancashire in 1934 and second behind Yorkshire in 1935. The 1936 championship-winning team was captained by A. W. Richardson and its key players were the main bowlers Copson, Mitchell, Alf Pope and all-rounder Townsend. Wicket-keeper Harry Elliott, very effective in combination with Mitchell, accounted for 62 batsmen. Four batsmen scored over 1,000 championship runs: Townsend, Worthington, Smith and Alderman. Derbyshire finished third in 1937, when Dusty Rhodes made his debut, and a creditable fifth in 1938 but then dropped back to mid-table in 1939. The promising pace bowler Cliff Gladwin made his debut in 1939 and played four times that season. Gladwin went on to play for England in the 1940s and form a formidable partnership for Derbyshire with Les Jackson."]}]}}
