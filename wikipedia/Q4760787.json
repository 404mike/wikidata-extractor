Hawkins has noted the importance of equipment and the role space plays in his sound, saying, \"I can't play through a small amp for an entire recording. I've got to have that big-amp impact along with the ambience of the room. There's a lot of complexity in a distorted guitar tone, and it needs some room to breathe.\" The Wire described him as \"a master of oceanic reverb and sustain, turning riffs from concrete slabs to gentle, body-caressing ripples.\" Hawkins has cited modern classical composers such Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti, Krzysztof Penderecki and especially Igor Stravinsky as an influence, crediting The Firebird with kindling his passion for music at an early age."]}, {"page": "Andrew Hawkins (disambiguation)", "response": ["Andrew or Andy Hawkins may also refer to:", "*Andy Hawkins (American football) (born 1958), retired American football player", "*Andy Hawkins (born 1960), American baseball pitcher", "*Andy Hawkins (musician) (born 1960), American guitarist", "*Andy Hawkins (music producer) (born 1977), British musician and record producer"]}, {"page": "An Anthology of Noise & Electronic Music", "response": ["*Andy Hawkins River Blindness 10:11 / 1995 "]}, {"page": "Jellicoe (band)", "response": ["They released their debut album As Brave As We Could Be on Do-Little Records the following year, which was produced by Andy Hawkins of Midget.
