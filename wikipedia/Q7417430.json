They initially considered casting the role of Sue to Gillian Taylforth, the actress who would go on to play Kathy Beale in the serial. In the end she was rejected because she had blonde hair and they had always envisioned Sue to be a brunette. Sandy Ratcliff (previously a model who was cast as Lord Snowdon's face of the seventies) was recommended for the role by the writer Bill Lyons. Ratcliff was invited in for audition. Holland and Smith were struck by her appearance, suggesting she had \"one of the most photogenic faces on television\". They suggested that she had a \"toughness in her face and manner, a fiery gypsy-like quality.\" and that she sounded \"East-end enough\". Holland and Smith surmised that Ratcliff would clearly be competent at playing the \"hard\" aspect to Sue's character, but they were not originally certain that Ratcliff would be able to portray the loser and victim aspects as convincingly because, on the surface, Ratcliff appeared to be the exact opposite.", "In 1987, after a long period of being shown trying to conceive, scriptwriters finally decided to make Sue pregnant in the soap opera with her second child. Sandy Ratcliff was positive about the storyline: \"It's going to be the making of Sue and Ali. Neither of them has ever got over the death of Hassan but hopefully the new baby will fill the void in their life.\" Discussing the ongoing storyline depicting marital problems with the Osmans, Nedjet Salih who played Ali said: \"The marriage was going downhill. Ali is no angel, but he's had a lot to put up with and has been very tolerant about Sue's depressions. Sue hasn't been easy to live with, she's been such a misery. No wonder he's been looking at other women ... although to be honest it's all bravado. He'd get cold feet when it came to it. It's really only Sue he loves and wants.\"", "Hilary Kingsley has suggested that despite Sue's flaws, due to the skill of Sandy Ratcliff, \"you can't help feeling sorry for her\".

He was a member of the original EastEnders cast, appearing in the first episode on 19 February 1985.

Ali was scripted as happy-go-lucky, which was in stark contrast to his highly strung wife, Sue (Sandy Ratcliff). Central to his storylines were his penchant for gambling, his tempestuous marriage, and the loss of his son to cot death, which was one of the first controversial storylines covered by the soap. He was created by Julia Smith and Tony Holland, the creators of EastEnders.", "Ali, a Turkish Cypriot, runs Bridge Street Caf\u00e9 in Walford with his wife, Sue Osman (Sandy Ratcliff), and also drives a taxicab. He is a gambler and frequently holds poker games in the caf\u00e9 after closing time and wages bets at the bookies, which is a huge source of concern for Sue. Ali rashly decides to wager his business on a bet in 1985 and wins a substantial amount of money. The Osmans are overjoyed but the next day their infant son, Hassan Osman (Michael Evangelou), is found dead in his cot. Ali and Sue spend months coming to terms with their son's death.

Their second son, Little Ali Osman (Omer Mustafa Salih), is born in 1988.", "The casting of Ali was a huge problem for Holland and Smith. During that time in the 80s only three Turkish-speaking actors could be located in London, and one of those was considered unsuitable. The other two, Haluk Bilginer and Nejdet Salih, were possibilities. Deciding which to cast caused major rows between Holland and Smith. Holland favoured Bilginer as he looked the part. He felt Salih did not have the physical presence needed and also believed that Sandy Ratcliff (the actress playing his on-screen wife) would \"make mincemeat out of him\". Smith disagreed. As Salih was actually an East Londoner whose parents were Turkish Cypriots (whilst Bilginer was Turkish) she felt he would have actual knowledge to bring to the character and wouldn't have to act the part as \"he was the part\". He also lived in the East End, as did his large family. To resolve the conflict both actors were given readings with Sandy Ratcliff and Salih eventually won the role following a cheeky, sexist remark aimed at Ratcliff and her tardy time-keeping. Both Holland and Smith felt this typified the character perfectly.
