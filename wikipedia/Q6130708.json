He became the Avro Aircraft Ltd. (Canada) chief design engineer and his ensuing involvement, ultimately as vice-president (engineering), in the design and development of the Avro Jetliner, CF-100 and CF-105 Arrow aircraft, occurred during a period which is viewed by many as the \"Golden Age\" of the Canadian aviation industry.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Avro Canada C102 Jetliner", "response": ["Chief Designer James C. Floyd was upset by these developments, but in the end found a number of advantages to the four-engine layout. The main advantage was that in an engine-out situation, the aircraft would lose only a quarter of its thrust, rather than half. In particular, the asymmetry in thrust originally called for a powered rudder to correct for yaw in the case of an engine failure, but with four engines it was found yaw was so small it could be corrected easily with just the manual trim controls."]}, {"page": "List of Canadian inventions and discoveries", "response": ["*The first commercial jetliner to fly in North America \u2014 designed by James C.
