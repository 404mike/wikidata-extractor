John obtained the nickname because he was said to closely resemble Frederick the Great, the King of Prussia, and was said to much admire him, and gave his name to the cove, located east of Penzance. The BBC said of the brothers, \"The Carters of Prussia Cove are among the most famous of all the Cornish smugglers.\"By all accounts, despite his profession, John Carter was a devout Methodist and was noted for his honest dealing as a smuggler.Much of what is known about John and the Carters came from Harry's autobiography, The Autobiography of a Cornish Smuggler, and folklore passed down through the generations.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Prussia Cove", "response": ["Prussia Cove (),   formerly called King's Cove, is a small private estate on the coast of Mount's Bay and to the east of Cudden Point, west Cornwall, England, United Kingdom.
