From the outset, Hill conceived this as a job for women only. She and her assistants (who included Emma Cons and Eva McLaren) combined the weekly rent collection with checking every detail of the premises and getting to know the tenants personally, acting as early social workers. At first Hill believed, \"Voluntary workers are a necessity. They are better than paid workers, and can be had in sufficient numbers.\" Later, she found it expedient to maintain a paid workforce. Her system required a large staff. Rent was collected on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday mornings. Rent accounts were balanced in the afternoons and arrangements were made with contractors for repairs. On Thursdays and Fridays arrears were pursued, contractors' invoices paid, new tenancy lettings and tenants' moves organised."]}, {"page": "Borough Green", "response": ["*Eva McLaren (1852\u20131921), suffragist and writer, died at Great Comp Cottage in Borough Green."]}, {"page": "List of suffragists and suffragettes", "response": ["* Eva McLaren (1852\u20131921) \u2013 suffragist, writer, and political campaigner"]}, {"page": "Lydia Becker", "response": ["In 1880, Becker and co-workers campaigned in the Isle of Man for the right of women to vote in the House of Keys elections.

The main march continued to Exeter Hall, for a meeting chaired by the Liberal politician Walter McLaren, whose wife, Eva McLaren, was one of the scheduled speakers. Keir Hardie, leader of the Labour Party, told the meeting, to hissing from several Liberal women on the platform, that if women won the vote, it would be thanks to the \"suffragettes' fighting brigade\". He spoke strongly in favour of the meeting's resolution, which was carried, that women be given the vote on the same basis as men, and demanded a bill in the current parliamentary session. At the Trafalgar Square meeting, Eva Gore-Booth referred to the \"alienation of the Labour Party through the action of a certain section in the suffrage movement\", according to The Observer, and asked the party \"not to punish the millions of women workers\" because of the actions of a small minority. When Hardie arrived from Exeter Hall, he expressed the hope that \"no working man bring discredit on the class to which he belonged by denying to women those political rights which their fathers had won for them\"."]}, {"page": "Walter McLaren", "response": ["He was the youngest child of the Liberal MP Duncan McLaren (1800\u20131886) and his third wife Priscilla Bright, a sister of the Radical MP John Bright.
