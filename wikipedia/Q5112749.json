In 1972, he was appointed to a fellowship at Harvard University's Center for Renaissance Studies,  Villa I Tatti, in Florence, Italy. During 1980\u201381, he was a visiting research curator at the Art Institute of Chicago, concentrating on the art of early Italy.\nIn 1988, Lloyd was appointed Surveyor of The Queen's Pictures for the Royal Collection, one of the largest and most important art collections in the world, held in trust by Queen Elizabeth II as Sovereign for her successors and the United Kingdom. The paintings comprise one of the best known and most significant elements of the Collection. Working to the Director of the Royal Collection, Lloyd had overall curatorial responsibility for some 7,000 oil paintings and 3,000 miniatures.\nLloyd retired as Surveyor of The Queen's Pictures in July 2005 and was succeeded by Desmond Shawe-Taylor.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Meindert Hobbema", "response": ["Hobbema's modern critical reputation is equivocal, with several critics expressing a degree of boredom with his woodland scenes, while others are more appreciative.

Early writers tended to depict female artists by correlating virtues which were traditionally held by women with similar values gleaned from interpretation of their paintings. Van Oosterwijck, who devoted her life to her painting rather than being a wife and mother, proved a challenging subject for these writers, and their accounts may not portray her as a fully formed personality. The more personal aspects of her paintings were also largely unexplored.
