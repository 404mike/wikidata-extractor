He wrote 11 novels as well as short stories, plays, and radio and television scripts, most of which focused on unemployment in the Rhondda Valley in the 1930s. He has been described by Stephen Thomas Knight as \"about the most verbally brilliant writer of Welsh fiction in English\".A Hundred Years of Fiction, p.93. His inaugural novel Sorrow for Thy Sons (1937) was rejected by Gollancz and not published until 1986. Thomas's first accepted book was a collection of short stories, Where Did I Put My Pity: Folk-Tales From the Modern Welsh, which appeared in 1946. He was also known for his negative attitude to the Welsh language, and Glyn Jones sees him as falling \"short of being a completely representative figure ... in his attitude to Wales and Welshness,\" as Gwyn Thomas \"appears in his writing to have little sympathy with the national aspirations and indigenous culture of our country\".The Dragon Has Two Tongues. p.115 Another writer who escaped from his proletarian background was Gwyn Jones (1907\u20131999). He wrote about this world in novels and short stories, including Times Like These (1936) which explores the life of a working-class family during the 1926 miners' strike. Jones founded The Welsh Review in 1939, which he edited until 1948; this journal was important for raising discussion of Welsh issues. What is probably the most famous novel about Wales, Richard Llewellyn's How Green Was My Valley, was published in 1939. It is described by Glyn Jones in The Dragon Has Two Tongues as a \"staggering and accomplished piece of literary hokum\" (p.\u00a051), \"a book [that Jones finds] impossible to take seriously, though much of it [he] read with absorption\" (p.\u00a053).

Noted for his eye for and sympathy with nature, critics of the time described this as one of the most striking features of his writings.

In his discussion of the history of the association of particular novelists with place in British literature, critic D. C. D. Pocock, described the sense of place not developing in that canon until a century after the novel form first solidified at the beginning of the 19th century. Often such British regional literature captures the social and local  character of a particular region in Britain, focussing on specific features, such as dialect, customs, history, and landscape (also called local colour): \"Such a locale is likely to be rural and/or provincial.\"J.A Cuddon, A Dictionary of Literary Terms. Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1984, p.560. Thomas Hardy's (1840-1928) novels can be described as regional because of the way he makes use of these elements in relation to a part of the West of England, that he names Wessex. Other British writers that have been characterized as regional novelists, are the Bront\u00eb sisters, and writers like Mary Webb (1881-1927), Margiad Evans (1909\u201358) and Geraint Goodwin (1903\u201342), who are associate with the Welsh border region.

Similarly, novelist and poet Walter Scott's (1771-1832) contribution in creating a unified identity for Scotland and were some of the most popular in all of Europe during the subsequent century.
