With three All Stars, three Ulster Senior Football Championship medals as a player, two as a manager to his name, and his guiding of Tyrone to their first all-Ireland triumph, the 2002 National League, he is often considered a legend of Tyrone football. He later managed his county.\nHis son Niall won the All-Ireland Minor Football Championship with Tyrone in 2008 having played the season in midfield. This has led many Tyrone supporters to hope that they might have another Eugene McKenna in their ranks. His second son, Peter, represented the Tyrone Minors in 2012, playing wing half back and both sons currently represent Donaghmore St. Patrick's GFC at senior level.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of All Stars Awards winners (football)", "response": ["| MD || 20px|border Eugene McKenna || Tyrone || 1", "| CF || 20px|border Eugene McKenna || Tyrone || 2", "| FF || 20px|border Eugene McKenna || Tyrone || 3"]}, {"page": "Ulster Senior Football Championship", "response": ["|20px|border Eugene McKenna"]}, {"page": "Augher", "response": ["* Eugene McKenna \u2013 former Tyrone Gaelic Football Captain in the 1980s and joint manager from 1999 to 2002 was from Augher.

McGuigan won an All-Star that year, as did Eugene McKenna.", "In 1986, Tyrone reached their very first All-Ireland Final. However, they were the rank outsiders to beat Kerry, who were going for their third title in a row (and eighth in twelve years). At one stage in the second half, Tyrone had amassed a seven-point lead (a penalty that could have put them nine points ahead was struck over the bar by Kevin McCabe), but two of their leading players on the day, Eugene McKenna, and John Lynch had to be replaced due to injury, and the experience of Kerry shone through, going on to win by 2\u201315 to 1\u201310 (21 points to 13).", "An unprecedented four Tyrone players won All-Star Awards that year, Plunkett Donaghy, John Lynch, Damien O'Hagan and Eugene McKenna won his second.", "Tyrone beat Donegal in the replayed 1989 Ulster Final, with Plunkett Donaghy leading the team out that day.

Harte had already Tyrone and Ulster titles with his club, Errigal Ciaran, and with Tyrone at Minor and Under 21 level, but had not proved himself on the inter-county stage at Senior level. Also, the acrimonious departure of Art McRory and Eugene McKenna, his predecessors, and two popular figures in Tyrone football over the previous twenty years, made many fans suspicious of his appointment. He soon laid those fears to rest however, immediately defending Tyrone's National League crown."]}]}}
