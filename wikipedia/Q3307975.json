From February 1960 until November 2002, he held the courtesy title Lord Mauchline.\nLoudoun was born in England and educated at Ampleforth College in Yorkshire, but emigrated to Jerilderie, New South Wales, as a teen, where he was a rice farmer and family man. He was the heir-general of George Plantagenet, the younger brother of Edward IV of England. If Edward IV had been illegitimate and the crown of England had descended by male-preference primogeniture before 1500, then George (and his heirs) would have been monarchs of England.\nAbney-Hastings died on 30 June 2012 in New South Wales.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "June 30", "response": ["*2012 \u2013 Michael Abney-Hastings, 14th Earl of Loudoun, English-Australian politician (b. 1942)"]}, {"page": "July 22", "response": ["*1942 \u2013 Michael Abney-Hastings, 14th Earl of Loudoun, English-Australian politician (d. 2012)"]}, {"page": "Barbara Abney-Hastings, 13th Countess of Loudoun", "response": ["* Michael Abney-Hastings, 14th Earl of Loudoun (1942\u20132012)"]}, {"page": "Michael Hastings", "response": ["*Michael Abney-Hastings, 14th Earl of Loudoun (1942\u20132012), English-born Australian rice farmer, Scottish aristocrat, and pretender to the ancient Crown of England "]}, {"page": "King michael of australia", "response": ["#REDIRECT Michael Abney-Hastings, 14th Earl of Loudoun"]}, {"page": "Alternative successions of the English and British crown", "response": ["# Michael Abney-Hastings, 14th Earl of Loudoun, eldest son of Barbara"]}, {"page": "Michael Abney-Hastings", "response": ["#REDIRECT Michael Abney-Hastings, 14th Earl of Loudoun"]}, {"page": "2012 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 30 June \u2013 Michael Abney-Hastings, 14th Earl of Loudoun, British Australian peer (born 1942)"]}, {"page": "Deaths in June 2012", "response": ["*Michael Abney-Hastings, 14th Earl of Loudoun, 69, British Australian peer."]}, {"page": "Simon Abney-Hastings, 15th Earl of Loudoun", "response": ["The Earl of Loudoun is the son of Michael Abney-Hastings, 14th Earl of Loudoun, whom he succeeded in 2012.
