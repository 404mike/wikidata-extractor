The first star to be honoured was Ozzy Osbourne on 6 July 2007. The event was held in Centenary Square and introduced by Elliott Webb from Birmingham's commercial radio station BRMB and the star was presented to Ozzy by Lord Mayor of Birmingham Randal Brew.

L. Doctorow, after the short story of the same title by Nathaniel Hawthorne. Bonnie Curtis and Julie Lynn would produce the film through Mockingbird Pictures, along with Elliott Webb as co-producer. Swicord had written the screenplay after meeting with Doctorow and discussing her ideas on how to present the story on film. She said, \"I had to really interrogate the story before I ever got up the courage to meet with Doctorow, because I knew he was going to want to know what kind of movie this was going to be. I met him and we had great conversations. We emailed and talked on the phone, and started the process of getting him to trust that we had all our ducks in a row.\""]}]}}
