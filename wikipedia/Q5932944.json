Immediately after the war, the signing of former England international forward George Holley for a club record \u00a3200 fee was viewed as quite a coup. Holley suffered a career-ending injury, so hardly played, but Webb replaced him with Jack Doran who finished as the club's top scorer despite joining halfway through the season.Carder & Harris, Seagulls!, pp. 68\u201370. He brought Tommy Cook through from the juniors into the first team; Cook was top scorer in three seasons, but when he left the club to concentrate on his cricket career, Webb brought in the Queens Park Rangers reserve Hugh Vallance, who turned out to be a \"goalscoring phenomenon\" alongside Dan Kirkwood.Carder & Harris, Seagulls!, p. 91. Again, when twice top scorer Arthur Attwood succumbed to appendicitis in 1933, Webb signed former Norwich City centre-forward Oliver \"Buster\" Brown who had failed to break into the first team at West Ham United; with regular football at Albion, Brown produced 41 goals in his first two seasons.Carder & Harris, Seagulls!, p. 102."]}, {"page": "Jack Curran (footballer)", "response": ["Curran signed for Brighton & Hove Albion of the Football League Third Division South in 1925, where he established a full-back partnership with Jack Jenkins that lasted several years.
