She became Head of Talks and later Head of the Current Affairs Group at BBC Television. David Attenborough described her as \"one of the most influential of television's pioneers [...] During her career she helped and encouraged countless people who were working in the medium and excited by its possibilities.\"", "She was born Grace Murrell Nisbet in Arisaig, a small village in the western Scottish Highlands.

The first general election which the television service was able to cover occurred in February 1950. The BBC engaged in no reporting of the campaign whatsoever because of a cautious reading of the Representation of the People Act 1948.
