Great Britain prop Kelvin Skerrett was sin-binned midway through the half for backchat after the use of a forearm on Paul Sironen who was attempting to tackle him. Following the restart after Hancock's try, Sironen, taking the hit up, was felled by an elbow to the head from Barrie McDermott who was put on report (and later suspended). Due to stoppages, the first half went almost 10 minutes longer than the regulation 40 minutes."]}]}}
