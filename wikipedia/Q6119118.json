He has published four collections of poetry. His novel, Talk of the Town, won the Somerset Maugham Award in 2009. His latest poetry collection, Jackself, won the T.S. Eliot Prize in 2016. Polley has co-written two short films and collaborated on multimedia poetry installations in the United Kingdom.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "English poetry", "response": ["There has been recent activity focused on poets in Bloodaxe Books' The New Poetry, including Simon Armitage, Kathleen Jamie, Glyn Maxwell, Selima Hill, Maggie Hannan, Michael Hofmann and Peter Reading. The New Generation movement flowered in the 1990s and early 2000s, producing poets such as Don Paterson, Julia Copus, John Stammers, Jacob Polley, David Morley and Alice Oswald.  A new generation of innovative poets has also sprung up in the wake of the Revival grouping, notably Caroline Bergvall, Tony Lopez, Allen Fisher and Denise Riley.Don Paterson, \"The Dark Art of Poetry\": T.S. Eliot Lecture, 9 November 2004: \"Geniune talents such as, say, Tony Lopez and Denise Riley, working recognisably within the English and European lyric traditions, are drowned by the chorus of articulate but fundamentally talentless poet-commentators\". Major independent and experimental poetry pamphlet publishers include Barque, Flarestack, Knives, Forks and Spoons Press, Penned in the Margins, Heaventree (founded in 2002 but no longer publishing) and Perdika Press.British Poetry Magazines 1914-2000: A History and Bibliography of \"Little Magazines\", David Miller and Richard Price (British Library UK & Oak Knoll Press USA, 2006). Throughout this period, publishing initiatives such as Salt Publishing and Shearsman Books promoted poetic diversity, while independent poetry presses such as Cinnamon press and Enitharmon Press have made available original work from (among others) Dannie Abse, Martyn Crucefix, Jane Duran, U. A.
