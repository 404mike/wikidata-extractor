He dropped Meredith to blood a young Jackie Sheldon. By this time, Meredith made headlines primarily due to his squabbling with the club over them stalling payment of his benefit matches and his dissatisfaction at being dropped. The club dropped to 14th spot in 1913\u201314, and only avoided relegation on the last day of the 1914\u201315 season after bribing Liverpool to lose 2\u20130 at Old Trafford; Meredith this time played no part in the resulting bribery scandal. He instead claimed to be baffled as to why his teammates refused to pass to him during the game."]}, {"page": "William McGregor (football)", "response": ["After stepping down as chairman, he was unanimously elected to an honorary position of president, a role he kept until 1894, and was named the first-ever life member of the League in 1895. The role was that of a figurehead with little actual authority, but he was used as a mediator to resolve league disagreements. In the second half of the decade McGregor's failure to attend many committee meetings led to criticism from John Bentley, his successor as president. Bentley's criticism achieved the desired effect; from 1899 until his health deteriorated in 1910, McGregor seldom missed a meeting. During this period McGregor was noted for his reserved nature. He was silent for large parts of committee meetings, but would contribute enthusiastically on the occasions he felt his input was necessary."]}, {"page": "John Bentley", "response": ["John Bentley may refer to:", "*John Bentley (MP) ( 1390), MP for Surrey", "*John Bentley (politician) (1822\u20131894), Wisconsin State Assemblyman", "*John Bentley (cricketer) (1787\u20131859), English cricketer", "*John Bentley (football manager) (1860\u20131918), English football manager", "*John Bentley (rower) (born 1957), Australian Olympic rower", "*John Bentley (rugby) (born 1966), English dual-code international rugby footballer", "*John Bentley (musician & office holder) ( 1756\u20131813), English-Canadian organist, choirmaster, harpsichordist and composer", "*John Bentley (Royal Navy officer) (died 1772), who gave his name to HMS Bentley (K465)", "*John Bentley (actor) (1916\u20132009), British actor", "*John Bentley (musician) (born 1951), British bass guitarist for the UK band Squeeze", "*The John Bentley School, Calne, Wiltshire, England"]}, {"page": "John Bentley (Manchester United)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Bentley (football manager)"]}]}}
