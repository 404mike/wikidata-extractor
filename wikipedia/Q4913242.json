Formerly a member of The Satellites, The Premiers, 1-2-3, and Clouds. He is generally acknowledged as being the first keyboard player in rock music to stand and take a leading role, thereby providing a model for others such as Keith Emerson and Rick Wakeman. He is also credited as being responsible for rewriting standard songs and arranging music in a style that later became fashionable as progressive rock. During a Saville Theatre concert in 1967, he introduced a then-unknown David Bowie to Jimi Hendrix.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Keyboardist", "response": ["The use of electronic keyboards grew in popularity throughout the 1960s, with many bands using the Hammond organ, Mellotron, and electric pianos such as the Fender Rhodes. The Doors became the first group to use the Moog synthesizer on a pop record on 1967's \"Strange Days\". Other bands, including The Moody Blues, The Rolling Stones, and The Beatles would go on to add it to their records, both to provide sound effects and as a musical instrument in its own right. In 1966, Billy Ritchie became the first keyboard player to take a lead role in a rock band, replacing guitar, and thereby preparing the ground for others such as Ray Manzarek, Keith Emerson and Rick Wakeman.The Encyclopedia of Popular Music (Muze); The Illustrated History of Rock, Clouds by Ed Ward; Q magazine article 1996 by Martin Ashton; Mojo Magazine article '1-2-3 and the Birth of Prog' nov 1994 In the late 1960s, a pioneer of modern electronic music Jean Michel Jarre started to experiment with synthesizers and other electronic devices. As synthesizers became more affordable and less unwieldy, many more bands and producers began using them, eventually paving the way for bands that consisted solely of synthesizers and other electronic instruments such as drum machines by the late 1970s/early 1980s. Some of the first bands that used this set up were Kraftwerk, Suicide and The Human League. Rock groups also began using synthesizers and electronic keyboards alongside the traditional line-up of guitar, bass and drums; particularly in progressive rock groups such as Genesis, Emerson, Lake & Palmer and Pink Floyd.  The pop-blues-rock band Fleetwood Mac was also known for synthesizer-infused hits during this period."]}, {"page": "The Nice", "response": ["The Nice were primarily a live band. Their stage performances were bold and violent, with Emerson incorporating feedback and distortion. He manhandled his Hammond L-100 organ, wrestling it and attacking it with daggers (which he used to hold down keys and sustain notes during these escapades). Emerson's playing was inspired by Jimi Hendrix, Billy Ritchie of Clouds, and Don Shinn as well as earlier figures such as pianist Jerry Lee Lewis."]}, {"page": "Clodagh Rodgers", "response": ["Young wrote and produced many of these songs. She also recorded \"Scrapbook,\" penned by Billy Ritchie, which appeared on her 1969 album Midnight Clodagh. In 1970 she recorded \"Give Me Just a Little More Line\" with Young under the name Moonshine; though it achieved airplay and critical notice, it failed to chart. Rodgers picked this track as one of her eight favourite discs when she appeared as the featured castaway on the BBC's Desert Island Discs in March 1971. In May 1970 Rodgers appeared on the bill at the NME poll-winner's concert, hosted by Tony Blackburn and Jimmy Savile."]}, {"page": "Lanark", "response": ["* Billy Ritchie Rock music's first lead keyboard player, born in Lanark"]}, {"page": "You Can All Join In", "response": ["#\"I\u2019ll Go Girl\" (Billy Ritchie, Ian Ellis, Harry Hughes) \u2013  Clouds \u2013 (from Scrapbook) (ILPS 9100)"]}, {"page": "List of keyboardists", "response": ["*Billy Ritchie (Clouds)"]}, {"page": "List of Hammond organ players", "response": ["|Billy Ritchie"]}, {"page": "Forth, South Lanarkshire", "response": ["Famous or noted residents who have lived in, or were born, in Forth include George Gracie who was included in the Guinness Book of Records as the Scotland's tallest man,http://www.forth.themutual.net/main.html Forth District website. and footballer Willie Waddell.

Though the later incarnation, Clouds, was still interesting, invention was now part of the mainstream, and the group disbanded in October 1971, unable to find a niche in an overcrowded progressive rock scene.
