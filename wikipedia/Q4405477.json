With a two-week deadline to find a new guitarist and resume the tour, Robert Sarzo, brother of the band's bassist Rudy Sarzo, was chosen to replace Rhoads. However, former Gillan guitarist Bernie Torm\u00e9 had flown to California from England with the promise from Jet Records that he had the job. Once Sharon realised that Jet Records had already paid Torm\u00e9 an advance, he was reluctantly hired instead of Sarzo. The tour resumed on 1 April 1982, but Torm\u00e9's blues-based style was unpopular with fans. After a handful of shows he informed Sharon that he would be returning to England to continue work on a solo album he had begun before coming to America.Sarzo, Rudy (2017). Off the Rails (third edition). CreateSpace Publishing.  At an audition in a hotel room, Osbourne selected Night Ranger's Brad Gillis to finish the tour. The tour culminated in the release of the 1982 live album Speak of the Devil, recorded at the Ritz in New York City. A live tribute album for Rhoads was also later released. Despite the difficulties, Osbourne moved on after Rhoads' death. Speak of the Devil, known in the United Kingdom as Talk of the Devil, was originally planned to consist of live recordings from 1981, primarily from Osbourne's solo work. Under contract to produce a live album, it ended up consisting entirely of Sabbath covers recorded with Gillis, Sarzo and Tommy Aldridge."]}, {"page": "Speak of the Devil (Ozzy Osbourne album)", "response": ["After the death of Rhoads, the band carried on for a short time with guitarist Bernie Torm\u00e9, until both parties agreed that the arrangement was not working out. Guitarist Brad Gillis arrived in New York City from California on April 5, 1982, to audition for Osbourne's band. Sharon dispatched Sarzo to Gillis' hotel room to teach him the songs. Though Gillis was vaguely familiar with Osbourne's music after seeing the band perform live the previous summer at the Day on the Green in Oakland, he was completely unfamiliar with Black Sabbath's music. He borrowed a friend's old Black Sabbath albums to become more familiar with the songs before leaving for New York City. His ability to faithfully reproduce Rhoads' parts earned Gillis the job, and he subsequently traveled with the band and became familiar with the material as Bernie Torme played his last few shows before leaving. On April 12, 1982, Gillis performed with the band during soundcheck before a show in Binghamton, New York, and played his first show with the band later that evening. Torme was described as \"the consummate professional\" during this period, staying with the band until Gillis was ready to step in, even waiting backstage during Gillis' first few shows in case he was needed."]}, {"page": "Ranelagh", "response": ["*Bernie Torm\u00e9 (1952-2019), rock guitarist, singer, songwriter"]}, {"page": "Ian Gillan Band", "response": ["*Bernie Torm\u00e9 \u2013 guitars (1979\u20131981)", "  bar:Torm\u00e9 text:\"Bernie Torm\u00e9\""]}, {"page": "Sweden Rock Festival", "response": ["*Bernie Torm\u00e9"]}, {"page": "List of people from Dublin", "response": ["*Bernie Torm\u00e9 \u2013 guitarist"]}, {"page": "Samson (band)", "response": ["In 1976, Paul Samson replaced Bernie Torm\u00e9 in London-based band Scrapyard, joining bassist John McCoy and drummer Roger Hunt. The band name was changed to McCoy, and they built up a busy gigging schedule, whilst also independently playing various sessions. Eventually, McCoy left to join Atomic Rooster. His replacement was the band's sound engineer and a close friend of Paul Samson's, Chris Aylmer. Aylmer suggested a name change to Samson, and recommended a young drummer, Clive Burr, whom he had previously played with in the band Maya. Burr joined, and Samson was born, although for a time Paul Samson used bassist Bill Pickard and drummer Paul Gunn on odd gigs, when Aylmer and Burr were honouring previous commitments. Various other people were tried out to expand the line up: Paul Samson got in touch with an old bandmate, bass player Stewart Cochrane, and asked him to try out with the group as a four-piece, with the current bass player Chris Aylmer on second guitar alongside Paul. Only one gig was played in this incarnation, at The Nag's Head pub in Rochester, Kent on 11 March 1978, where it was decided that Samson and Aylmer's playing styles were not compatible, so they went back to being a three-piece. Cochrane later joined the avant-garde jazz-rock band Spanish Fly; and later continued his career as a band-leader for Holland America Line, Windstar Cruises. Cochrane performed and recorded with members of bands The Animals, Nashville Teens and Steve Hackett Band.  Talking to Cochrane in 2017 he allegedly said \u201cNot getting the Samson gig was the best thing to happen to him as the band\u2019s lifestyle choices and the music wasn\u2019t his cup-of-tea anyway\u201d.  It appears that Cochrane and Samson had a disagreement about Samson wanting Cochrane to dress up in some weird black leather military style uniform on stage, but they fell out mainly over Cochrane pointing out that the Samson logo on the Telephone single sleeve looked too much like the Nazi SS runes.  Their friendship since their teen band days finished there and then.  Cochrane moved to California in the early 1990\u2019s, retired from performing music due to arthritis and is currently living in Las Vegas Nevada.", "  bar:torm\u00e9   text:\"Bernie Torm\u00e9\""]}]}}
