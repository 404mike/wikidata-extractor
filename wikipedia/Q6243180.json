He left a wife, Phyl, and a daughter, Jennifer - who a week later gave birth to his first grandchild, a son, an event which he was awaiting with eager anticipation.\nIn the postscript to \"Where No Stars Guide\", published posthumously in 1975, Hynam's literary collaborator and close personal friend Dan Morgan wrote: \"John had a larger-than-life physical and psychic presence. Likeable, eccentric, egocentric, kind, brusque, take your pick from the thesaurus to describe him, he was all of these and more. A man of enormous enthusiasms, he died as lived, at full speed\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of science-fiction authors", "response": ["*John Kippax (1915\u20131974)"]}, {"page": "Kippax", "response": ["*John Kippax  the pen name of English science fiction writer John Charles Hynam "]}, {"page": "New Writings in SF 22", "response": ["*\"The Time Wager\" (John Kippax)"]}, {"page": "New Writings in SF", "response": ["Dozens of prolific authors contributed stories, some in series, such as James White's Sector General.
