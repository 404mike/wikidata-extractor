There is a tradition that in the course of his wanderings he once played before George IV at Windsor. After several years in the provinces, he made his first London appearance in 1831 at the Pavilion Theatre as Wormwood in The Lottery Ticket, in which part he was much admired, and which he then acted there upward of fifty consecutive times. John Liston was then the reigning favourite in London (Joseph Shepherd Munden, who died in 1832, being in decadence), and next to Liston stood John Reeve, upon whom it is thought that the earlier style of Burton was in a measure founded."]}, {"page": "Fanny Fitzwilliam", "response": ["* 1830 (c. 1\u20136 March) With John Reeve, Mr Wilkinson and Mrs Daly \u2013 THE HEART OF LONDON and THE ELEPHANT OF SIAM at the Theatre Royal, Adelphi", "* 1833 (c. 28 January) With John Reeve, Mr Yates and Mrs Daly in DON QUIXOTTE and OTHELLO and the pantomime HARLEQUIN AND THE KING OF CLUBS at the Theatre Royal, Adelphi"]}, {"page": "Robert William Honner", "response": ["He acted subsequently at Sadler's Wells under Joseph Grimaldi (1827); at the Surrey first with Robert William Elliston, and then with Charles Elliston and D.
