After an early career as a private secretary he was unexpectedly elected as a Conservative Member of Parliament in Blaydon, a traditionally extremely secure Labour constituency. After standing up in Parliament for the local mining industry he opted out of defending his seat, and could not find election elsewhere; he then became a political journalist. After wartime service in intelligence, he supported Winston Churchill's attempt to bring European unity and then became a stockbroker. A very clubbable man, he attracted interest in the 1990s as a rare survivor of the pre-Second World War Parliament.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Blaydon (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|| 1931 || Thomas Martin || Conservative"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1931 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Thomas Martin"]}, {"page": "Thomas Martin", "response": ["*Thomas Martin (died 1583) (1530\u20131583), MP for Dorchester", "*Thomas Martin (died 1593) (1521\u20131593), MP for Ludgershall, Saltash and Hindon", "*Thomas Martin of Palgrave (1697\u20131771), British antiquary and book collector", "*Thomas Martin (died 1765) (c. 1679\u20131765), British banker and Whig politician", "*Thomas Martin (Canadian politician) (1850\u20131907), Canadian Member of Parliament", "*Thomas Martin (moderator) (1856\u20131942), Scottish minister, Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland", "*Thomas Martin (footballer), English footballer for Bradford City", "*Thomas Martin (Conservative politician) (1901\u20131995), British Member of Parliament for Blaydon", "*Thomas Martin (cricketer) (1911\u20131937), Irish cricketer", "*Thomas Martin (paleontologist) (born 1960), German paleontologist", "*Thomas Martin (musician) (born 1940), American-born double bass player and luthier", "*Thomas Martin (Maine politician), American politician and businessperson", "*Thomas Martin (judoka) (born 1956), American judoka", "*Thomas Martin (racing driver) (born 1978), American racecar driver"]}, {"page": "Thomas Ballantyne Martin", "response": ["#REDIRECT Thomas Martin (Conservative politician)"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom MPs who died in the 1990s", "response": ["|Thomas Martin"]}]}}
