He and his father John Ninham belonged to the Norwich School of painters, a group of artists who all worked or lived in Norwich during all or part of their working lives from around 1800 to 1880. Along with the Norwich School artists John Thirtle and David Hodgson, he was the foremost recorder of Norwich's architectural heritage prior to the invention of photography.\nThe son of John Ninham, one of the Norwich School's founding members, Ninham trained as a panel painter under his father and was taught art by John Crome. Throughout much of his adult life, he was directly involved in running the family printing business in Chapelfield Lane, Norwich. After a largely uneventful life, he died in Norwich in 1874.\nNinham rarely travelled far from home to find new subjects. A skilled engraver, his works have provided historians with invaluable information regarding the appearance of many of Norwich's streets and medieval, Tudor and Georgian buildings prior to their demolition.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Norwich School of painters", "response": ["*Henry Ninham"]}, {"page": "Norwich Castle", "response": ["The etcher and watercolourist Edward Thomas Daniell was one of the vociferous opponents of the proposed refacing. One of the letters he wrote about the subject appeared in the Norwich Mercury in August 1830, and referred to the \"scandalous re-facing of the ancient keep\". Although living in London during this period, his letters to his friends the artist Henry Ninham and his friend the botanist Dawson Turner reveal the extent of his opposition. In a letter to Turner, Daniell wrote, \"I have had a very beautiful drawing made of it, and I mean to etch it the size of the drawing. I can only say that if my etching be half as much like the castle, or half as good as the drawing, it will be more like, than anything yet done, of that very beautiful relic.\" To Ninham he wrote, \"Show me by a plan, how high they have got pulling down, and enable me to judge whether even now in the eleventh hour, any good can be done; and I in return will just inform you, how I stand with regard to my plate. It stands precisely as it did when I left Norwich.\" His etching of the old keep, however, was never completed, and the refacing went ahead and was successfully completed."]}, {"page": "Edward Thomas Daniell", "response": ["He normally used a small number of colours for his watercolour paintings, mainly sepia, ultramarine,  and gamboge. The distinctive style of his watercolours was influenced in part by Crome,  and John Sell Cotman. As an etcher he was unsurpassed by the other Norwich artists in the use of drypoint, and he anticipated the modern revival of etching which began in the 1850s. His prints were made by his friend and neighbour Henry Ninham, whose technique he influenced. His paintings of the Near East may have been made with future works in mind.", "Daniell may also have visited Spain, as his etchings of the country were copied by the Norwich artist Henry Ninham, but there is no direct evidence he went there. It is possible he returned home in time for the funeral of Joseph Stannard, who died from tuberculosis on 7December 1830, aged33.", "Many of Daniell's etchings were printed in Norwich by Henry Ninham, who lived a short distance from Daniell's house on St. Giles Street. His friendships with Ninham and Joseph Stannard may have begun at school.", "Daniell later employed a looser style, moving away from Stannard and towards that of Andrew Geddes and other Scottish etchers, whose output he almost certainly first saw while in Scotland during the summer of 1831. His was outstanding in the use of drypoint, strengthening his design by using the needle's point to create a burr in the plate. The burrs allowed the ink to collect, producing a darker tone in some of his prints. Thistlethwaite views the large drypoint etchings and Norfolk landscapes made after 1831 as being \"supremely independent and for his time unique\", once he had moved away from the traditional style of etchers like Geddes. He is thought to have introduced drypoint etching to his Norwich peers; both Thomas Lound and Henry Ninham etched in this way after 1831, producing works of a quality approaching Daniell's own."]}, {"page": "Thomas Lound", "response": ["Lound's 20 known etchings show the influence of drypoint technique of Edward Thomas Daniell, whose own etchings have a dark, rich quality. Along with Henry Ninham, Lound began to adopt Daniell's technique after 1831. His etchings\u2014and those of Ninham and Miles Edmund Cotman\u2014are very small in comparison with those produced by contemporaries such as Cotman, Daniell and Stannard. They were not produced for public display, but were intended to be viewed closely by Lound's friends. After the mid-1830s Lound seems not to have etched any more, although he continued to paint and draw for another 30 years."]}, {"page": "Alfred Priest", "response": ["Priest was born in Norwich on 12 December 1810, the son of John Fox Priest and his wife Elizabeth Neal (n\u00e9e Raven), and was baptised at St Gregory's Church, Norwich two days later.Image 56: Alfred Priest in \"Archdeacons transcripts for Norwich parishes, 1600-1812\", FamilySearch (Alfred Priest). His father was a chemist, who educated him to follow his profession. Acting against his father's wishes, he left Norwich. He returned to his home city after a period at sea and then briefly worked as an apprentice to a surgeon in the nearby town of Downham Market. He studied etching under the water-colourists Henry Ninham and James Stark, and the etcher E. W. Cooke. He specialised in marine painting and is noted for his depictions of water and waves. He moved to London in 1835, but returned to Norwich in 1848, living there for a further two years before he died of tuberculosis in 1850, aged forty.Walpole, Art and Artists of the Norwich School, p.156."]}]}}
