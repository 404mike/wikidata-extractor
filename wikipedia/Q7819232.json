Born in Glasgow, Bogan played for Strathclyde, Blantyre Celtic, Renfrew and Hibernian before moving to Celtic after the end of the Second World War.\nAfter two-and-a-half years with Celtic, Bogan moved to England to play for Preston North End in September 1948. He played for Preston for one season, before moving to Manchester United in September 1949. However, it was apparent that Bogan had not adapted to the English game and moved back to Scotland to play for Aberdeen in March 1951. A move back to England soon followed, with Bogan moving to Southampton after just four appearances for Aberdeen. Again, though, he struggled to fit in and he moved to Blackburn Rovers and then Macclesfield Town before retiring from professional football.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
