The book, entitled The Making of Great Men, discusses sex- and gender-based inequality and provided insight into the systems of power in Melanesia.

Each year, the LSE anthropology department asks an anthropologist at a relatively early stage of their career to give the Malinowski Lecture, and only invites those considered to have made significant contributions to anthropological theory. Graeber's address was called \"Beyond Power/Knowledge: an exploration of the relation of power, ignorance and stupidity\". It was later edited into an essay, \"Dead zones of the imagination: On violence, bureaucracy and interpretive labor\". The same year, Graeber was asked to present the keynote address in the 100th anniversary Diamond Jubilee meetings of the Association of Social Anthropologists. In April 2011, he presented the anthropology department's annual Distinguished Lecture at Berkeley, and in May 2012 delivered the second annual Marilyn Strathern Lecture at Cambridge (the first was delivered by Strathern)."]}, {"page": "Moka exchange", "response": ["Other anthropologists, however, refused to see these different \"exchange spheres\" as such polar opposites.
