He subsequently created The X Factor and Got Talent franchises which have been sold around the world. In 2004 and 2010, Time named Cowell one of the 100 most influential people in the world.Poniewozik, James (26 April 2004). \"The 2004 TIME 100: Simon Cowell\", Time. Retrieved 16 October 2018.Cannon, Nick (29 April 2010). \"The 2010 TIME 100: Simon Cowell\", Time. Retrieved 16 October 2018. In 2008, The Daily Telegraph ranked him sixth in their list of the \"100 most powerful people in British culture\". The same year, he received the Special Recognition Award at the National Television Awards. At the 2010 British Academy Television Awards, Cowell received the BAFTA Special Award for his \"outstanding contribution to the entertainment industry and for his development of new talent\". In 2018, he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in the television category.", "In 2001, Cowell was given the role of judge on the first series of Pop Idol, a show that he and the show creator Simon Fuller successfully pitched to ITV Controller of Entertainment Claudia Rosencrantz. Maggie Brown in The Guardian states, \"the show became a seminal reality/entertainment format once on air that autumn\". Cowell's S Records signed the top two finishers of the first season of Pop Idol, Will Young and Gareth Gates, both of whom went on to have No 1 UK hits, and they were the top 2 best-selling singles of 2002 and the decade of 2000s. He also became a judge on the first season of American Idol in 2002. With his notoriously critical reputation, Cowell has been likened to TV personalities such as Judge Judy and The Weakest Link host Anne Robinson. His closest predecessor was British TV critic Nina Myskow who, in the 1980s, became known for her harsh put-downs in New Faces, a talent show that Cowell cited as an influence. Cowell's prominence grew, fed by his signature phrase, \"I don't mean to be rude, but ...\", inevitably followed by an unsparingly blunt appraisal of the contestant's talents, personality, or even physical appearance. A lot of these one-liners were the product of coaching that Cowell received from publicist Max Clifford. Cowell also appeared on the one-off World Idol programme in 2003, in which it became clear that each country's version of the Idol had attempted to come up with its own \"Simon Cowell\" type personality."]}, {"page": "Queen's College, London", "response": ["*Claudia Rosencrantz (1975\u201379), journalist, Controller of Entertainment, ITV, Commissioner of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, X Factor and I'm A Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here!, Director of Programming, Living TV, Director of Television, Virgin Media"]}, {"page": "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?

In 2002, he started legal proceedings against the production company, ITV, and five individuals who had claimed they had created Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, stating that the idea from the show was taken from several elements he had created \u2013 a board game format he conceived in 1981; a two-page TV format, known as Millionaire, made in 1987; and the telephone mechanics for a TV concept he created in 1989, BT Lottery. In his claim, Bachini stated that he submitted documents for his TV concepts to Paul Smith, from a sister company of Celador's, in March 1995 and again in January 1996, and to Claudia Rosencrantz of ITV, also in January 1996, accusing both of using roughly 90% of the format for Millionaire in the pilot for the game show, including the use of twenty questions, lifelines and safety nets, although the lifelines were conceived under different names \u2013 Bachini claimed that he never coined the phrase \"phone-a-friend\" that Briggs designed in his format. In response to this claim, Celador made a counter-claim that the franchise originated from the basic format idea conceived by Briggs. The defendants in the claim took Bachini to a summary hearing but lost their right to have his claim dismissed. Although Bachini won the right to go to trial, he was unable to attend the hearing due to serious illness. Celador eventually settled the matter with him out-of-court.Birmingham Sunday Mercury, 28 August 2005"]}, {"page": "Claudia rosencrantz", "response": ["#REDIRECT Claudia Rosencrantz "]}, {"page": "Daniel Abineri", "response": ["Abineri has produced and directed several television documentaries, including One Hit Wonders for the BBC in 1997, Walk on the Wild Side for Granada TV, and Murder and Celebrity for UKTV and A Conversation With James Lovelock for Network Films.
