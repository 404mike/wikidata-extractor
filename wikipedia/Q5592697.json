In 1994 he set a world record by playing 510 games of blitz chess (five minutes for each player) in three days, winning 431 games and drawing 25 (Burgess 2000:448\u201352).\nBurgess has written more than twenty books and edited more than 250.

It loses by force\" and offered his Fischer Defense (3...d6) as a refutation.Bobby Fischer, \"A Bust to the King's Gambit\", American Chess Quarterly, Summer 1961, pp. 3\u20139. FM Graham Burgess, in his book The Mammoth Book of Chess, noted the discrepancy between the King's Gambit and Wilhelm Steinitz's accumulation theory.
