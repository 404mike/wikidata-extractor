It rapidly grew in significance and led to an expansion of classical music in Scotland, including the foundation of Scottish Opera in 1960. Scottish composers influenced by Karlheinz Stockhausen (1928\u20132007) included Iain Hamilton (1922\u20132000), Thomas Wilson (1927\u20132001) and Thea Musgrave (b. 1928). Another native of Lancashire, Salford-born Sir Peter Maxwell Davies (1934-2016), lived on Orkney from the 1970s, and co-founded the St Magnus Festival there.J.
