Smith's view was borne out by the effects of mass industrialization in the late 18th century which caused great change in how people worked and how work was organized. On this topic Lynda Gratton, the organizational theorist, describes the \"fundamental and irreversible shift which changed the experiences of every worker.\" She states that prior to the Industrial Revolution, work was an \"artisan activity engaged largely in the home, using long held and meticulously developed craft skills.\" According to Gratton these skills \"began to be transformed as the manufacturing sector was developed and began to transcend the limits of artisanal production\".Gratton, L.
