Spencer Wilks was to stay with the company until 1962, and his brother until 1963.", "A need for greater expertise within the project, along with difficult relations between Rover management and Frank Whittle (not least because Rover under AM approval had secretly designed a different engine layout, known within Rover as the B.26, which they thought was superior), led to Rover handing over their part in the jet engine project and the Barnoldswick factory to Rolls-Royce in exchange for the latter's Meteor tank engine factory at Ascot Road, Nottingham, the result of a handshake deal between Rover's Spencer Wilks and Rolls-Royce's Ernest Hives made in a local inn in Clitheroe. The official hand-over date was 1 April 1943, though there was a considerable overlap, and several key Rover staff such as Adrian Lombard and John Herriot, the latter being at Rover on secondment from the Air Inspection Department (AID) of the AM, moved to Rolls-Royce. In exchange for the jet engine project and its facilities, Rover was given the contract and production equipment to make Meteor tank engines, which continued until 1964. The Meteor engine was superseded for new tanks in 1962, and as Rover wanted more manufacturing capacity for the Land Rover they transferred the manufacture of Meteor spare parts for the British and other governments  back to Rolls-Royce at Shrewsbury. Although Rolls-Royce under Stanley Hooker were soon to be able to start producing the Whittle-designed W.2B/23 engine (known within Rover as the B.23, later named by Rolls-Royce the Welland), they evaluated the 4 Lombard/Herriot re-designed Rover W.2B/B.26 engines under test at the time of the takeover, and selected the Rover design for their own jet engine development (it became the Rolls-Royce Derwent engine)."]}, {"page": "Cromwell tank", "response": ["A solution to both their problems was offered by Ernest Hives, a Rolls board member, who had met Whittle and was fascinated by the jet engine (Rolls-Royce's major product was piston aero engines).

Whittle accused Rover of \"tampering\" with the design of the engine in order to avoid patent fees and enable Rover to claim the design as their own, whilst Rover's development work was proceeding at a slow pace. Rover was losing interest in the project after the delays and constant harassment from Whittle. Earlier, in 1940, Stanley Hooker of Rolls-Royce had met Whittle, and later introduced him to Ernest Hives. Rolls-Royce had a fully developed supercharger division, which Hooker directed, and which was naturally suited to jet engine work. Hives agreed to supply key parts to help the project along. Eventually, in early 1943, Spencer Wilks of Rover met Hives and Hooker for a dinner at the Swan & Royal Hotel, Clitheroe.

He doubted if enough experienced tradesmen would be available to restart custom body building firms. After discussions with Spencer Wilks of Rover on the course to be followed, he went to the Pressed Steel Company in 1944 and asked whether they could make the tools for a body shell and the cost per shell; they were nonplussed at the small number of bodies required even though he stretched it to 2000 per year or a third above the total pre-war average. The tooling would cost at least \u00a3250,000 and would require production of at least 5,000 bodies. Hives agreed with a \"fully tooled\" body but when Arthur Sidgreaves heard of the cost he insisted on a full-scale mock-up for the Board. Some board members objected to sinking the headlamps into the wings, but changing the design might lose their place in the queue at Pressed Steel with perhaps twelve months delay. But the body shell would cost about half of what a post-war Park Ward body would cost, and as the surface of the pressings was so good less work would be required on them before painting. The body, used for the  Rolls-Royce Silver Dawn and Bentley Mark VI, stayed in production for nine years and 6,500 bodies; a further 3,200 were made with an alteration increasing the size of the boot (luggage compartment; the Bentley R Type or later Silver Dawn). After VE day in May 1945 the Crewe factory went from Merlins to motor cars, and a body production line was created \"from nothing\".
