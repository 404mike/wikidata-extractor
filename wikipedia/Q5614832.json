In March 1939, he came to England on the Kindertransport together with his older brother, Kurt Max Treitel, and sister Celia. Treitel was once described by Lord Steyn as 'one of the most distinguished academic writers on the law of contract in the English speaking world', and has often been described as the leading authority on English contract law. He is the author of Treitel on the Law of Contract, a seminal work on English contract law.\nTreitel retired as Vinerian Professor in 1997 and received a knighthood for services to law. Treitel had been a Fellow of All Souls College since 1979; he was previously a Fellow of Magdalen College from 1954 to 1979.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "University of Oxford", "response": ["The list of noted legal scholars includes H.

In Scriven Bros & Co v Hindley & Co[1913] 3 KB 564 Scriven Bros made a bid at an auction (the auctioneer was trading as Hindley & Co) for bales of hemp and tow. The auction catalogue suggested that one of the batches contained both hemp and tow. But it only contained tow. When the auctioneer tried to enforce the high bid by Scriven Bros, Lawrence J held he could not, because the sale had been procured by the auctioneer's own negligence. Guenter Treitel has argued that the case is best explained on the basis that the court will have regard to the subjective intentions of the parties - that in fact hemp and tow was being contracted for. But Ewan McKendrick argues that this case is still explicable through taking an objective approach to the parties expressed wishes: a reasonable person in Hindley's position would not have thought there was a contract with someone misled by their negligently prepared auction catalogue.McKendrick (2007) 25"]}, {"page": "Privity in English law", "response": ["As a loophole the use of collateral contracts are limited, because the courts must first find evidence to imply some kind of collateral contract, as well as consideration.Treitel (2003) p.584 Attempts by the courts to do this have added to the perception of this as an artificial device \u2013 the decision in Charnock v Liverpool Corporation [1968] 1 WLR 1498, which used collateral contracts, has been described by Guenter Treitel as \"invented\" consideration, and by Patrick Atiyah as \"fictitious\".
