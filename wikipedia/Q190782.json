He holds the record for the most ranking titles in professional snooker, with 38. As a six-time world champion, a seven-time Masters champion, and a seven-time UK champion, he has won a record 20 Triple Crown titles, ahead of Stephen Hendry, who won 18. He has been ranked world number one on multiple occasions.\nAfter an impressive junior career, O'Sullivan turned professional in 1992, aged 16. He won his first ranking title at the 1993 UK Championship aged 17 years and 358 days, making him the youngest player to win a professional ranking event, a record he still holds. He is also the youngest player to win the Masters, which he first achieved in 1995, aged 19 years and 69 days. Now noted for his longevity in the sport, he has competed in a record 29 consecutive World Championships between 1993 and 2021. In 2020, he became the second-oldest player, after Ray Reardon in 1978, to win a world title in snooker's modern era.\nOne of the sport's most prolific break-builders, O'Sullivan made his first competitive century break at age 10 and his first competitive maximum break at age 15. In 2019, he became the first and only player to reach 1,000 career century breaks in professional competition, a record he has since extended to over 1,100 centuries. He has achieved the highest number of officially recognised maximum breaks in professional competition, with 15, and holds the Guinness World Record for the fastest competitive maximum break, compiled in a time of 5 minutes and 8 seconds at the 1997 World Championship.\nOutside his playing career, O'Sullivan works as a pundit and presenter for Eurosport, has written crime novels, autobiographies, and a health and fitness book, and has starred in the miniseries Ronnie O'Sullivan's American Hustle. He was awarded an OBE in 2016.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "December 5", "response": ["*1975 \u2013 Ronnie O'Sullivan, English snooker player and radio host"]}, {"page": "England", "response": ["Darts is a widely popular sport in England; a professional competitive sport, darts is a traditional pub game.

He won the Masters, too, and achieved his first competitive 147 break, in the Matchroom League. A year later, he retained both his World Championship title and a fifth consecutive Masters crown.

Hendry reached another World Championship semi-final but was thrashed 4\u201317 by O\u2019Sullivan with a session to spare, which was the heaviest defeat in a world semi-final. However, following O'Sullivan's decision to not enter the 2006 Malta Cup, Hendry was able to regain the world no. 1 position in 2005\u201306 due to consistency in reaching the latter stages of tournaments without, by his own admission, reproducing his form of old. He reached the final of the 2006 UK Championship in a tournament memorable for his quarter-final against Ronnie O'Sullivan, in which O'Sullivan unexpectedly forfeited the match at 4\u20131 down following a strong start by Hendry.
