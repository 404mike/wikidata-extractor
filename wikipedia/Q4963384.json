He was on the books of Middlesbrough without playing league football for them, and played non-league football for clubs including Billingham Synthonia, Stokesley, Sunderland RCA, West Auckland Town, with whom he reached and lost in the 2014 FA Vase Final, Newton Aycliffe, and a second spell at West Auckland Town, before joining Guisborough Town in September 2017.He represented Northern Ireland at under-21 and under-23 level.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Brian Close", "response": ["Dennis Brian Close,  (24 February 1931 \u2013 13 September 2015) was an English first-class cricketer, the youngest man ever to play Test cricket for England. He was picked to play against New Zealand in July 1949, when he was 18\u00a0years old. Close went on to play 22\u00a0Test matches for England, captaining them seven times to six wins and one drawn test. Close also captained Yorkshire to four county championship titles \u2013 the main domestic trophy in English cricket. He later went on to captain Somerset, where he is widely credited with developing the county into a hard-playing team, and helping to mould Viv Richards and Ian Botham into the successful players they became.", "thumb|right|Brian Close (pictured middle row, third from the right) with the England team which toured Australia in ", "At the end of 1962, Wilson retired, and the Yorkshire committee appointed Close captain. According to Bowes: \"almost overnight it seemed that Brian Close matured\". He wrote, \"Close's field placings were as intelligent and antagonistic as any seen in the county for 25\u00a0years\".", "After the fourth Test of their five-Test series against the West Indies in 1966, England were 3\u20130 down and had lost the series. Needing someone to come in to revitalise the squad, the England selectors turned to the successful Yorkshire captain, Brian Close. Close knew why he had been selected, and also why many of his men had been. At the pre-match dinner he said, \"I shouldn't be here if we hadn't made such a mess of the series. What's more, neither would a few of you. You are here because you are all fighters, and we are going to keep the pressure on and keep it on for five days.\" What Close did was to engender a battling spirit for the final Test Match. So, when England were 166 for 7 in reply to the West Indies' 268 all out, they did not give up. Instead, centuries from Tom Graveney and John Murray, and half-centuries from Ken Higgs and John Snow, saw England to a score of 527. The highlight of the match was when West Indian captain Gary Sobers, who had a batting average in the series of well over 100, came in to bat at 137 for 5 with his side still 122\u00a0runs from making England bat again. Close knew that Sobers was a fine hooker, and he knew how he wanted to approach him, so he asked Snow to bowl a bouncer first up. Everything went to plan: Sobers hooked, edged the ball into his body, and it rebounded to Close at his customary short leg position, close to the batsman, ready to take the catch \u2013 or a full blow to the body had Sobers middled it. Sobers c. Close, b. Snow 0 off one ball. England went on to win the game by an innings and 34 runs.", "In 1976, the 45-year-old Brian Close was called up for the first three Tests in England's five-Test series against the West Indies, who were no less ferocious than when Close was battered by them in 1963. In the second innings of the third Test at Old Trafford, Close's final Test innings, Close opened with the 39-year-old John Edrich. Michael Holding, Andy Roberts and Wayne Daniel, a trio of fast bowlers, pounded them for two and a half hours. It was one of the most brutal displays of fast bowling ever seen. Wisden said, \"Close and Edrich defended their wickets and themselves against fast bowling, which was frequently too wild and hostile to be acceptable\". Close himself said, \"It must have been the worst wicket I experienced in Test cricket. The faster the West Indians bowled the worse it got because the balls broke through the surface of the wicket. They exploded and flew at you.\" With this innings of 20 runs off 108 balls in 162 minutes Close completed his Test career, under a vicious barrage, standing tall and taking the damage as he had against the West Indies at Lord's 13 years earlier.", "thumb|right|Brian Close presenting an award for Yorkshire in 2008."]}, {"page": "1982 in Northern Ireland", "response": ["*27 January - Brian Close, footballer."]}, {"page": "Middlesbrough F.C.
