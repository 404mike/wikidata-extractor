Denton also successfully argued against the requirements of the Entente Cordiale, which would have assigned a mid-river port on the Gambia to the French. Denton said that the port would destroy British trade on the river and was a key factor in the British delaying their planned cession until after World War I, and, in the end, delay the plans indefinitely."]}, {"page": "1889 Birthday Honours", "response": ["*Robert Baxter Llewelyn, Administrator of the Island of Saint Lucia."]}, {"page": "1898 New Year Honours", "response": ["*Robert Baxter Llewelyn, Esq, CMG, Administrator of the Colony of the Gambia."]}, {"page": "List of governors of dependent territories in the 19th century", "response": ["::*Robert Baxter Llewelyn, Commissioner (1878\u20131883)"]}, {"page": "Robert Llewellyn (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Robert Baxter Llewelyn (1845\u20131919), colonial administrator in the British Empire"]}]}}
