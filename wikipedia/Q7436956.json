He was selected in 2003/04 to attend the ECB national academy and toured subsequently to India]\nIn May 2005, he made history as the first Surrey player to hit consecutive innings of a century and a double century in the same game, against Glamorgan.In 2009, he was dropped from the Surrey squad mid-way through the season and spent time on loan at Nottinghamshire before formally leaving Surrey at the end of the season to join traditional rivals Middlesex. There were reports that Newman's departure from Surrey was influenced by management's disappointment with his attitude on and off the pitch. This followed an altercation with the umpires in a match against Middlesex earlier that season. His stint with Nottinghamshire was also marked by a dispute with the umpires during a first-class match.On 12 March 2012 Newman joined Kent on loan for the first two months of the season. He played four matches for Kent with his highest score being 89 against Oxford MCCU.In 2017 he set up the Scott Newman Academy to coach junior players, following brief spells running cricket coaching programmes in North Middlesex and West Hertfordshire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Surrey County Cricket Club", "response": ["*  Scott Newman"]}, {"page": "Trinity School of John Whitgift", "response": ["*Scott Newman, Surrey cricketer"]}, {"page": "Warwickshire County Cricket Club in 2005", "response": ["Surrey had the better of the first three days at Whitgift School, which is located in Croydon and is now in its fifth year as a festival venue.
