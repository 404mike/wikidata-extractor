He became a leader in the affairs of the Society of Public Analysts and editor of The Analyst.\nBevan was notable for his caustic wit. He was born in Birkenhead.  After graduating, he became a chemist at the Scottish paper making firm of Alexander Cowan & Co. He met Charles Frederick Cross, and the pair then attended Owens College, Manchester.\nCross who was interested in cellulose technology went into partnership with Bevan in 1885, setting up as analytical and consulting chemists in New Court, Lincoln's Inn in London.\nIn 1888 they published what was to become a standard work on paper making. In 1892, together with another partner, Clayton Beadle (who was also an authority on paper making) they took out a patent for viscose which became the basis for the viscose, rayon and cellophane industries. In 1894 Cross and Bevan took out a patent for the manufacture of cellulose acetate - this was to become the industrial process for its manufacture.\nHe was awarded the John Scott Medal of The Franklin Institute in 1895.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Rayon", "response": ["English chemist Charles Frederick Cross and his collaborators, Edward John Bevan and Clayton Beadle, patented their artificial silk in 1894. They named their material \"viscose\" because its production involved the intermediacy of a highly viscous solution. The process built on the reaction of cellulose with a strong base, followed by treatment of that solution with carbon disulfide to give a xanthate derivative. The xanthate is then converted back to a cellulose fiber in a subsequent step.", "French scientist and industrialist Hilaire de Chardonnet (1838\u20131924), inventor of the first artificial textile fiber, artificial silk, created viscose. British scientists Charles Frederick Cross and Edward John Bevan took out British Patent No. 8,700, \"Improvements in Dissolving Cellulose and Allied Compounds\" in May, 1892. In 1893, they formed the Viscose Syndicate to grant licences and, in 1896, formed the British Viscoid Co. Ltd. to exploit the process."]}, {"page": "Synthetic fiber", "response": ["The first successful process was developed in 1894 by English chemist Charles Frederick Cross, and his collaborators Edward John Bevan and Clayton Beadle. They named the fiber \"viscose\", because the reaction product of carbon disulfide and cellulose in basic conditions gave a highly viscous solution of xanthate. The first commercial viscose rayon was produced by the UK company Courtaulds in 1905. The name \"rayon\" was adopted in 1924, with \"viscose\" being used for the viscous organic liquid used to make both rayon and cellophane. A similar product known as cellulose acetate was discovered in 1865. Rayon and acetate are both artificial fibers, but not truly synthetic, being made from wood."]}, {"page": "1894 in science", "response": ["* Viscose, a form of artificial silk or rayon, is patented by Charles Frederick Cross with Edward John Bevan and Clayton Beadle."]}, {"page": "1921 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 17 October \u2013 Edward John Bevan, chemist, partner of Charles Frederick Cross (born 1856)"]}, {"page": "\u00c9chirolles", "response": ["Former industrial village, the majority of its inhabitants worked in the viscose factories, a fabric which was invented in \u00c9chirolles in 1884 by French scientist and industrial Hilaire de Chardonnet, before becoming universally famous.
