He began his career with Manchester City having come through their youth ranks, and was named as the club's Player of the Year in 1998, before featuring in their Second Division play-off final victory in 1999. He also spent time on loan at Hartlepool United, Portsmouth and Sheffield United, before he was sold to Sheffield United for a \u00a3400,000 fee in January 2000. He scored 36 goals in 174 appearances during a four-year stay in Sheffield, being named as the club's Player of the Year in 2002 and named on the PFA Team of the Year the following year.\nHe moved back to the Premier League with Tottenham Hotspur for a \u00a3500,000 fee in January 2004. After two years with Spurs he moved on to Fulham for an 18-month stay. He was transferred to Wigan Athletic in July 2007, where he would spend two seasons before making the move to Portsmouth in August 2009. He played for the club in their 2010 FA Cup final defeat to Chelsea, but could not prevent them from being relegated out of the top-flight that same year. He joined Leeds United in July 2011, and went on to spend the next three years at Elland Road. He signed with Port Vale in July 2014, and also took on a coaching role with them, before becoming assistant manager to Bruno Ribeiro in June 2016. He was promoted to caretaker manager following Ribeiro's resignation in December 2016, but could not prevent relegation out of EFL League One at the end of the 2016\u201317 season, after which he was confirmed as the club's permanent manager. With the club lying bottom of the English Football League, he was sacked in September 2017. He has since gone on to work as a pundit and summariser for BBC Sport, Sky Sports and Quest.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "January 25", "response": ["*1977 \u2013 Michael Brown, English footballer, manager and pundit "]}, {"page": "Manchester City F.C.", "response": ["|1997\u201398|| Michael Brown"]}, {"page": "Battle of Bramall Lane", "response": ["United goalkeeper Simon Tracey was sent off in the 9th minute for deliberately handling the ball outside the area to stop a shot at goal. Albion striker Scott Dobie gave his side the lead going into half-time, and midfielder Derek McInnes doubled the lead in the 63rd minute, prompting United manager Neil Warnock to make two substitutions; Santos and Patrick Suffo came on, but both received red cards within moments. Santos committed a dangerous two-footed tackle on Johnson, and Suffo headbutted McInnes in the ensuing melee. Down to eight men, United conceded a third goal, with Dobie scoring his second of the afternoon. United midfielder Michael Brown and defender Robert Ullathorne suffered injuries that meant they could no longer take part in the match. Because United had already used all of their allowed substitutions, referee Eddie Wolstenholme, who had already declined to send off both Brown and captain Keith Curle for clear red-card offences, was forced to abandon the match in the 82nd minute, as dictated by the rules of the game.", "The match quickly turned ugly; a stray ball from McInnes in midfield, later described by United striker Laurent D'Jaffo as a \"pass from God\", led to Santos being sent off for a high and poorly timed lunging tackle on Johnson, the studs of his boot connecting with the Welsh midfielder's shin. The two teams then began a mass brawl on the pitch, and amid the ensuing melee, Suffo headbutted McInnes in full view of referee Wolstenholme, an action so violent it caused the Albion player to bleed, and Suffo was also sent off. Albion defender Darren Moore was visibly angered by the actions of the United players, and had to be physically restrained by D'Jaffo; Johnson said it was like Moore \"had the devil in him\". By the time play resumed, United had been reduced to eight men, and had none of their three allotted substitutions remaining. Soon after, United captain Keith Curle was fortunate to avoid a sending off after appearing to throw punches at McInnes, as was Michael Brown for a foul on the same player, clambering over him as Albion made a breakaway. Wolstenholme later admitted to not awarding red cards and keeping both players on the field in order to finish the match.", "|CM ||7 || Michael Brown || ", "Speaking in 2020 to the Sheffield Star, Suffo explained that his actions were solely in defence of teammate Santos, and described it as a highlight of his career on par with winning the 2000 Olympics and playing in the 2002 FIFA World Cup for Cameroon, but also spoke of his regret of the incident as he had begun to feel settled at the club. The close relationship between United club executive Derek Dooley and Megson was said to be severely damaged by the event. Suffo's teammate Michael Brown later described the match as \"bizarre\" and \"crazy\", and spoke of his regret about being involved in such a match while appearing on BT Sport in 2020. Curle has described the match as \"surreal\" and \"farcical\", while Albion striker Bob Taylor believed it was unforgettable for those involved and in attendance."]}, {"page": "Chris Kirkland", "response": ["Kirkland began coaching the goalkeepers at League One club Port Vale in January 2017 as a favour to his friend and former teammate Michael Brown.
