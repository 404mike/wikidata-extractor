Even without Strange in the team, there was strong competition for the half back positions with Horace Burrows and Gavin Malloch keeping Sharp out of the team for the early months of the 1934\u201335 season. However, an injury to Malloch on 1 December 1934 in a home draw with Sunderland led to Sharp making his debut the following Saturday in a 1\u20130 victory at Leicester. Sharp showed good form and kept Malloch out of the side for the rest of the season as Wednesday went on a fine run of results, eventually finishing third in Division One and winning the 1935 FA Cup Final. The following season saw the team struggle to avoid relegation, Sharp (who was not involved in the 1935 FA Charity Shield]]) played 24 matches and eventually asked for a transfer as his wife could not settle in Sheffield. In his two years at Wednesday, Sharp played 48 league games and 10 FA Cup games, scoring two goals.Since 1888.

He also took over from Horace Burrows as club penalty taker. Some of his goals were vital, he scored the winner at Nottingham Forest, then scored a vital brace in Wednesday's penultimate match of the season, a 2\u20131 home victory against Burnley which lifted the team out of the bottom three.

In 1936 Betts was offered a professional contract with Mansfield Town F.C. managed by Harold Wightman. Betts refused initially due to concern over leaving secure full-time employment. However, he committed to Wightman in September later that year when Wightman became the manager of Nottingham Forest.
