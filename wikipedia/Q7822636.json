Notable examples of his work are Jessie Hill's \"Ooh Poo Pah Doo\" (written by Hill and arranged and produced by Toussaint), Ernie K-Doe's \"Mother-in-Law\", and Chris Kenner's \"I Like It Like That\". A two-sided 1962 hit by Benny Spellman comprised \"Lipstick Traces (on a Cigarette)\" (covered by The O'Jays, Ringo Starr, and Alex Chilton) and the simple but effective \"Fortune Teller\" (covered by various 1960s rock groups, including The Rolling Stones, The Nashville Teens, The Who, The Hollies, The Throb, and ex-The Searchers founder Tony Jackson). \"Ruler of My Heart\", written under his pseudonym Naomi Neville, first recorded by Irma Thomas for the Minit label in 1963, was adapted by Otis Redding under the title \"Pain in My Heart\" later that year, prompting Toussaint to file a lawsuit against Redding and his record company, Stax (the claim was settled out of court, with Stax agreeing to credit Naomi Neville as the songwriter).Bowman, Rob. (1997). Soulsville U.S.A.: The Story of Stax Records. New York, Schirmer Trade Books. p. 46, note 16. Redding's version of the song was also recorded by The Rolling Stones on their second album. In 1964, \"A Certain Girl\" (originally by Ernie K-Doe) was the B-side of the first single release by The Yardbirds. The song was released again in 1980 by Warren Zevon, as the single from the album Bad Luck Streak in Dancing School it reached 57 on Billboard's Hot 100. Mary Weiss, former lead singer of The Shangri-Las, released it  as \"A Certain Guy\" in 2007.

He accepted an invitation to join the band for a gig at Wilson Hall, Garston and became the seventh member of The Searchers, replacing McGarry to join John McNally, Mike Prendergast and Tony Jackson. He adopted the name Chris Curtis after Jackson described him thus in a press interview, choosing the name from a Lee Curtis poster to avoid saying 'crummey'.", "For the next six years Curtis was an essential part of the Searchers' sound and contributed to the band's characteristic vocal harmonies with his distinctive voice, blending particularly well with the high-pitched voice of early band-mate Tony Jackson. Perhaps the finest example of this can be found in their rendition of \"Ain't That Just Like Me\", where Curtis sings the lead vocal, and Jackson chimes in with the recurring chorus."]}, {"page": "Pye Records", "response": ["* Tony Jackson and the Vibrations (1964\u20131966; issued in the US on Kapp, and then Red Bird)"]}, {"page": "2003 in British music", "response": ["*18 August \u2013 Tony Jackson, English singer and bass player, 63"]}, {"page": "The Searchers (band)", "response": ["The band grew out of an earlier skiffle group formed by McNally in 1957, with his friends Brian Dolan (guitar) and Tony West (bass \u2013 born Anthony West, in 1938, Waterloo, Liverpool, Lancashire \u2013 died 11 November 2010, West Way, Hightown, Merseyside). When the other two members lost interest, McNally was joined by his guitarist neighbour Mike Prendergast. They soon recruited Tony Jackson (born Anthony Paul Jackson, 16 July 1938, The Dingle, Liverpool, Lancashire \u2013 died 18 August 2003, Nottingham, Nottinghamshire) with his homemade bass guitar and amplifier, who was recruited as a lead singer, but took a back seat at first in order to learn the bass. The band styled themselves as \"Tony and the Searchers\" with Joe Kennedy on drums. Kennedy soon left to be replaced by Norman McGarry (born 1 March 1942, Liverpool, Lancashire), and it is this line-up \u2013 McNally, Pender (as Prendergast soon became known), Jackson and McGarry \u2013 that is usually cited as the original foursome.", "The band returned to a residency at the Iron Door Club and it was there that they tape-recorded the sessions that led to a Pye Records recording contract with Tony Hatch as producer. The first single, \"Sweets for My Sweet\", featuring Tony Jackson as main vocalist supported by Pender and Curtis, shot to number one in the UK in 1963, firmly establishing the band as a major spearhead of the \"Merseybeat\" boom, just behind The Beatles and alongside Gerry and the Pacemakers.  Their first album, Meet The Searchers, sung mostly by Jackson and Pender, was released in August 1963 and reached number 2 on the British album charts the next month.Lazell, Barry ed., with Dafydd Rees and Luke Crampton, Rock Movers & Shakers, Billboard Publications, New York, 1989 p. 445 With a slightly changed track listing, including the song \"Needles and Pins\", it hit #22 in the US album charts in June 1964.Whitburn, Joel, The Billboard Book of Top 40 Albums, Billboard Books, NY 1991 p. 235", "After scoring with their hit \"Needles And Pins\", bassist Tony Jackson, who was only allowed one co-lead vocal on their third album (on \"Sho Know A Lot About Love\"), left the band and was replaced by a Searchers' Hamburg pal, Frank Allen (born Francis Renaud McNeice, 14 December 1943, Hayes, London) from Cliff Bennett and The Rebel Rousers. Jackson was then signed to Pye as a solo act and, backed by The Vibrations, issued a few singles of which the first, \"Bye Bye Baby\", charted in the UK in 1964. He also re-cut \"Love Potion No. 9\" but it failed to chart. The next Searchers single to chart in the UK during this period was \"Some Day We're Gonna Love Again\" (1964).", "Chris Curtis's choice of Bobby Darin's \"When I Get Home\", despite a strong band performance, was a relative chart failure by their standards. This to an extent undermined Curtis's position as song selector for the band, and some internal disagreements resurfaced over musical policy and direction that had been evident earlier when Tony Jackson had left, and likely played a part in Curtis leaving as well after the 1966 Australian tour. This departure was a major blow, as Curtis had been chief songwriter, song selector, and key high harmony voice, as well as a figurehead member and the main PR man.", "*Tony Jackson: bass, vocals", "* Tony Jackson: lead vocals, bass", " bar:Jackson  text:\"Tony Jackson\""]}, {"page": "2003 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 18 August \u2013 Tony Jackson, singer (The Searchers) (born 1938)"]}, {"page": "1938 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 16 July \u2013 Tony Jackson, singer and bass guitarist (died 2003)"]}, {"page": "Mike Pender", "response": ["After the Searchers recorded the singles \"Sweets for My Sweet\" and \"Sugar and Spice\", Pender took over lead vocal duties from Tony Jackson.
