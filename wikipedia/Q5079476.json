T. Whittaker", "response": ["In 1906, Whittaker was appointed Andrews Professor of Astronomy at Trinity College Dublin, which came with the title Royal Astronomer of Ireland. He succeeded Charles Jasper Joly at the post and was appointed upon recommendation from the astronomer Robert Stawell Ball. Ball's recommendation, which was published in a collection of his letters in 1915, stated that Whittaker was the only person he knew who could \"properly succeed Joly\" and that the role would \"suit him in every way\". He then describes Whittaker as \"modest\" and \"charming\" and as \"a man who has infinite capacity for making things go\". Ball claims that Whittaker was a world leading expert in theoretical astronomy and that, in relation to Whittaker's discovery of a general solution to Laplace's equation, notes that he \"has already made one discovery which the greatest mathematician of the last two centuries would be proud to have placed to his credit\". The Royal Astronomers acted as directors for the Dunsink Observatory, which used outdated astronomy equipment; it was understood that the primary responsibility of the role was to teach mathematical physics at Trinity College. During this time, the relative leisure of his post allowed him to complete the reading required to write his third major book A History of the Theories of Aether and Electricity, from the age of Descartes to the close of the nineteenth century. Also during this time, he wrote the book The Theory of Optical Instruments, published six astronomy papers, and published collected astronomical observations."]}, {"page": "Biquaternion", "response": ["Hamilton's primary exposition on biquaternions came in 1853 in his Lectures on Quaternions.
