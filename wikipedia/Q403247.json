He appears to have originally been ruler of Gwent and Morgannwg, where his son later continued to have his power base. When Llywelyn ap Seisyll, king of Gwynedd and Deheubarth died unexpectedly in 1023, Rhydderch was able to seize Deheubarth, apparently by force of arms. In 1033 Rhydderch is recorded by Brut y Tywysogion as having been slain by the Irish, but with no explanation of the circumstances.\nThe kingdom of Deheubarth returned to the original dynasty in the form of Hywel ab Edwin and his brother Maredudd. A battle between Hywel and his brother and the sons of Rhydderch is recorded the following year. In 1045 Rhydderch's son, Gruffydd ap Rhydderch was able to seize Deheubarth from Gruffydd ap Llywelyn and held it for ten years until Gruffydd regained it.\nRhydderch had at least three sons, they were as follows:\n\nGruffydd ap Rhydderch (died 1055), King of Morgannwg and Deheubarth, killed in battle against Gruffydd ap Llywelyn.\nCaradog ap Rhydderch (died 1035), killed by the \"Saxons\".\nRhys ap Rhydderch (died 5 January 1053), put to death by order of King Edward the Confessor.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1033", "response": ["* Rhydderch ap Iestyn, king of Gwent and Deheubarth"]}, {"page": "List of rulers of Wales", "response": ["* Rhydderch ap Iestyn, prince of Glywysing (1023\u20131033)", "* Rhydderch ap Iestyn's son, Gruffydd ap Rhydderch (1047\u20131055)", "* his son, Rhydderch ap Iestyn (c. 1015\u20131033) ", "* Rhydderch ap Iestyn (1023\u20131033)"]}, {"page": "List of monarchs of Powys", "response": ["*Rhydderch ap Iestyn 1023-1033"]}, {"page": "Hywel ab Edwin", "response": ["Hywel was the son of Edwin ap Einion and great-grandson of Hywel Dda. When the previous king, Rhydderch ap Iestyn, who had usurped the throne, died in 1033 Hywel became king of Deheubarth, sharing the realm with his brother Maredudd. Hywel and Maredudd's rule did not go unchallenged as the sons of Rhydderch fought in a battle against them in 1034 at Irathwy. Though sources do not name the victors it seems as though Hywel and Maredudd were victorious as they remained in power.
