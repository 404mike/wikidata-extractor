As a former sprinter, he was able to use his speed to great effect in the reserves, earning him a call-up to the first team on 29 September 1909, replacing Wally Radford at outside-right for one match, a 2\u20131 defeat at Brentford. For the next match, manager Ernest Arnfield tried Joe Blake on the left before Frank Jefferis became the established left-winger."]}, {"page": "Bill Blackmore", "response": ["He started his career in the reserve team but soon impressed new manager Jimmy McIntyre who selected him for the third match of the 1912\u201313 season on 12 September 1912. Blackmore replaced Sid Kimpton at outside-right, while Kimpton moved to centre-forward to replace the amateur player, Leonard Dawe. The match at Northampton Town was won 2\u20131 and Blackmore retained his place for the next match before Joe Blake replaced him."]}, {"page": "John Coham", "response": ["He joined Southampton in the summer of 1910, aged 18, and initially played in the reserve team. His first-team debut came on 4 February 1911, when he took the place of Joe Blake at outside-left for the Southern League match against Exeter City, with Blake moving inside in the absence of Harry Brown. Described as a \"fleet-footed left-winger\", Coham continued to deputise for Blake for the remainder of the season, making five further appearances; of Coham's six first-team matches, four ended in defeats with two draws as the \"Saints\" struggled to avoid relegation, winning only one match from February onwards."]}]}}
