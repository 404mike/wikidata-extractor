One of these quotations occurs in the Philokalia of Sts. Gregory of Nazianzus and Basil (c. 360). Dr. Armitage Robinson showed in his edition of that work (1893) that the citation is an addition to the passage of Origen made by the compilers, or possibly by a later editor. The other citation occurs in the old Latin translation of Origen on Matthew. This translation is full of interpolations and alterations, and the passage of Pseudo-Clement is apparently an interpolation by the translator from the Arian Opus imperfectum in Matt.Journal of Theological Studies, III, 436."]}, {"page": "Ecclesiastical Household", "response": ["* Armitage Robinson 1 January 1902 - October 1902 (replacing Gore), (resigned, appointed Dean)"]}]}}
