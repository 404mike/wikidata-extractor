Under directions from Sir Sefton Brancker, a Public Inquiry was held, chaired by Sir Arthur Colefax, with Professor B M Jones and James Swinburne as assessors. The enquiry opened on 23 January 1925 at the Royal Courts of Justice, Strand, London. This was the first Public Inquiry into a civil aviation accident in the United Kingdom. The inquiry was held under the Air Navigation (Investigation of Accidents) Act, 1920, as amended in 1922. Evidence was given that the aircraft had a valid certificate of airworthiness and that at the time of the accident it was operating in an unmodified form. The aircraft was not overloaded and had been inspected on the morning of the day the accident occurred. Reported problems with the lubrication system on the Napier Lion engine had been rectified. Failure of the aircraft to reach its intended destinations in the week before the accident had been entirely due to weather conditions, and not as the result of any mechanical defect. The pilot, David Stewart, had served with the Royal Flying Corps and Royal Air Force, having been awarded the Military Cross, Distinguished Flying Cross and Air Force Cross. He had been a pilot since 1917. Evidence was given that a petrol pipe recovered from the wreckage was discovered to be partially obstructed internally. The possibility of this occurring before the crash could not be dismissed, although the obstruction could also have been as a result of the post-crash fire. The inquiry was then adjourned until 25 January."]}, {"page": "David Stewart (aviator)", "response": ["#REDIRECT David Stewart (RAF officer)"]}, {"page": "December 1924", "response": ["*Died: David Stewart, 34, British flying ace (pilot in the fatal Imperial Airways de Havilland DH.34 crash)"]}, {"page": "David Stewart (RAF)", "response": ["#redirect David Stewart (RAF officer)"]}, {"page": "David Stewart (Royal Air Force)", "response": ["#redirect David Stewart (RAF officer)"]}, {"page": "David Stewart (Royal Air Force officer)", "response": ["#redirect David Stewart (RAF officer)"]}, {"page": "David Stewart (officer)", "response": ["#redirect David Stewart (RAF officer)"]}, {"page": "David Stewart (officer in the Royal Air Force)", "response": ["#redirect David Stewart (RAF officer)"]}, {"page": "Captain David Stewart", "response": ["#redirect David Stewart (RAF officer)"]}, {"page": "Captain David Arthur Stewart", "response": ["#redirect David Stewart (RAF officer)"]}, {"page": "Captain David A Stewart", "response": ["#redirect David Stewart (RAF officer)"]}, {"page": "Captain David A.
