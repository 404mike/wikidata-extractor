He replaced Keith Newton in a 3\u20131 victory against Northern Ireland. He was subsequently included in the England squad for the World Cup in Mexico. Glanville contends that Bell's excellence was threatening Bobby Charlton's place in the England team.  England were seeking to replicate their performance in the 1966 FIFA World Cup, which they had won. Bell's City teammate Francis Lee was also included in the squad. In order to help the players acclimatise to the heat of Mexico, the team staged an intra-squad mini-olympics which saw Bell win every event. In the group stage, Bell came on as a substitute in a 1\u20130 defeat to Brazil, in which Jairzinho scored the only goal. Bell \"added spark to the England offence in the latter stages\" of the game. Bell started in the next game, a 1\u20130 victory against Czechoslovakia, in which Allan Clarke scored the only goal."]}, {"page": "Peter Storey", "response": ["Storey made his England debut under Alf Ramsey on 21 April 1971, in a 3\u20130 win over Greece at Wembley in a qualifying game for UEFA Euro 1972. Despite at the time being used as a midfielder at club level he played at right-back as Ramsey wanted to assess his options at the full-back position; his rivals for the number 2 shirt were Keith Newton (Everton), Emlyn Hughes (Liverpool), Paul Reaney (Leeds United), Chris Lawler (Liverpool), and Paul Madeley (Leeds United). He almost did not play the game as Arsenal manager Bertie Mee ordered both Storey and teammate Bob McNab to pull out of the fixture to play a league game against Burnley the day before, but was allowed to play for England after coach Don Howe persuaded Mee to reconsider his decision. Storey picked up an assist in the match after providing the cross for Francis Lee's late header. His second cap came in a 1\u20130 British Home Championship win over Northern Ireland at Windsor Park, in which he played in midfield and man-marked George Best."]}, {"page": "Derek Dougan", "response": ["Wolves enjoyed an excellent start to the 1969\u201370 season, winning seven of their opening eight games, but fell away to a mid-table finish after the shock retirement of 24-year old forward Peter Knowles, who left the game to become a full-time Jehovah's Witness volunteer.
