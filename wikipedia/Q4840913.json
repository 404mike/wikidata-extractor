According to The Guardian, Uzzaman was perhaps best known for his role as a hospital patient in the 1986 television series, The Singing Detective, opposite actor Michael Gambon.  He later appeared in numerous television roles during his career, often as a supporting character, including Torchwood, Inspector Morse, Coronation Street, Cracker, The Bill and Casualty.Uzzaman was born on 8 March 1939, in Phulpur, Azamgarh, British India. His father worked for the railway industry, so he moved to the city of Abbottabad in present-day Pakistan. He continued to move with his family depending on his father's job transfers, which included time in both Quetta and Lahore. Uzzaman graduated from Government College, Abbottabad, in 1959, where he studied English and Urdu.Uzzaman began his career as a radio presenter in Pakistan. He switched to acting, appearing in roles of Pakistan Television Corporation (PTV) following the state-owned channel's launch in 1964.In 1984, Uzzaman was cast in Malia, a Pakistani film about a traveling fair with a strong, underlying theme against the martial law imposed by the government of General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq. In the film, Uzzaman played five different characters.  The film was sharply rebuked by Zia's government, and had to be completed in London. Uzzaman left Pakistan and was granted political asylum in the United Kingdom soon after Malia's release. He became a British citizen.He is also notable for playing two television characters who were subjected to racially motivated attacks. The first was in the 1989 Casualty episode \"Victim of Circumstances\", where he appeared as Bharat Patel, a shopkeeper who was beaten up by two skinheads who had attacked his son in an earlier assault. In 1994, he appeared in the Cracker episode \"To Be a Somebody (Part One)\", in which he played the role of Shahid Ali, a shopkeeper who was the first victim of spree killer Albie Kinsella, played by Robert Carlyle.\nAt the age of 72, Uzzaman died of a lung infection on 14 June 2011.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Personal Services", "response": ["*Badi Uzzaman as Mr Patel"]}, {"page": "Kevin & Perry Go Large", "response": ["|Badi Uzzaman"]}, {"page": "List of former EastEnders characters", "response": ["|Hanif Ahmed || Badi Uzzaman || 1990"]}, {"page": "Azmi", "response": ["* Mohammed Badi Uzzaman Azmi (1939\u20132011), Pakistani actor"]}, {"page": "List of British Pakistanis", "response": ["* Badi Uzzaman \u2013 television and film actor"]}, {"page": "Mother Love (TV series)", "response": ["*Badi Uzzaman as Mini Cab Driver"]}, {"page": "2011 in film", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 14 || Badi Uzzaman || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 72 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| Indian || style=\"text-align:center;\"| Actor || "]}, {"page": "Lebewohl, Fremde", "response": ["* Badi Uzzaman - Badi"]}, {"page": "2011 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Badi Uzzaman, actor (b. 1939)"]}, {"page": "Deaths in June 2011", "response": ["*Badi Uzzaman, 72, Indian-British actor (Eastern Promises, Another Year), chest infection."]}, {"page": "List of British Muslims", "response": ["* Badi Uzzaman  television and film actor"]}, {"page": "Mohammed Badi Uzzaman Azmi", "response": ["#REDIRECT Badi Uzzaman"]}, {"page": "Mohammed Badi Uzzaman", "response": ["#REDIRECT Badi Uzzaman"]}, {"page": "Badi Uzzaman Azmi", "response": ["#REDIRECT Badi Uzzaman"]}, {"page": "Immaculate Conception (film)", "response": ["*Badi Uzzaman as Dadaji's Retainer"]}, {"page": "Firm Friends", "response": ["*Badi Uzzaman as Puran Kapoor"]}]}}
