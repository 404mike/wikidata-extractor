He married Maud Evelyn Ellicott in 1894. He entered politics, serving on Leeds City Council.\nHe was elected MP for Leeds Central at 1922 general election, defeating the incumbent Liberal MP, Robert Armitage. While campaigning in his election he regularly tipped his audiences to bet on his horse \"Leeds United\" in an upcoming race; the horse won, at 5-1 odds, the day before the election. The tip was popular, and the Yorkshire Evening Post estimated that Leeds bookmakers had had to pay out around \u00a320,000 in winnings.Willey was not very active in Parliament owing to his commitments as a solicitor, although he intended to increase his Parliamentary work in the near future, and had taken a particular interest in the Criminal Justice Bill during his first session as an MP. He intended to make his maiden speech during the debate on the bill, but it was delayed.\nOn the morning of Sunday, 1 July 1923, Willey prepared to go to church with his wife Maud. It was the anniversary of the death of his son Tom, killed at the age of 18 at the Battle of the Somme exactly seven years previously.\nWilley was taken by a sudden seizure, and never regained consciousness. He died early the following morning, aged 54.That same day, a notice that Willey had already placed in The Times \"In Memoriam\" section appeared:\n\nWILLEY \u2013 In proud and loving memory of SEC. LIEUT. TOM WILLEY, Leeds Pals Division, killed in the Somme attack on 1 July 1916. \u2013 MAUD AND ARTHUR WILLEY, \"The Grove\", Roundhay, Leeds.\n\nAt Willey's funeral, thousands of mourners lined the streets of Leeds, and a large number of public bodies and institutions were represented, together with representatives of the north country jockeys. At northern race meetings that day, jockeys wore crepe in memory of Willey.All three of his children pre-deceased him and his wife died in December 1939.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1923 Leeds Central by-election", "response": ["The by-election was caused by the death of the sitting Unionist MP, Arthur Wellesley Willey on 2 July 1923.
