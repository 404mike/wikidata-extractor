The likely discoverer, in 1850, was bushman William Chace, whose employers, the pastoralist brothers William Browne and John Browne, both medical doctors, had applied in 1850 for a pastoral lease there.  The rival claimant was pastoralist C.N. Bagot, who described the country in June 1851 in a newspaper report, after having applied for a lease, and claiming to be the discoverer. Within a week of Bagot's discovery claim appearing it was indignantly refuted by the Browne's, in favour of Chace.South Australian, 20 June 1851, page 3a."]}, {"page": "Henry Strong Price", "response": ["Price eventually made his way over to nearby Booborowie Station, owned by brothers William Browne and John Browne, both medical doctors, also from Wiltshire, with whom he then began a lasting and intimate connection.
