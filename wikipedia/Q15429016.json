The Royal Society bought the lease of the atoll in 1970 and their research station became functional from 1970. After completion of their assigned work, the Royal Society left and the Seychelles Island Foundation (SIF), a public trust of Seychelles, took over the management and protection of the atoll in 1979. SIF functions under the patronage of the President of Seychelles and Aldabra was declared a Special Nature Reserve in 1981, and a year later it became a UNESCO World Heritage Site on 19 November 1982. A brass plaque inscribed with the citation \"Aldabra, wonder of nature given to humanity by the people of the Republic of Seychelles\" is stationed on the atoll. This appreciation befits the atoll which is truly one of the greatest ecologically undisturbed raised coral atolls in the world.thumb|left|A mangrove in Aldabra Atoll"]}, {"page": "Cultural ecology", "response": ["In geography, cultural ecology developed in response to the \"landscape morphology\" approach of Carl O. Sauer. Sauer's school was criticized for being unscientific and later for holding a \"reified\" or \"superorganic\" conception of culture.  Cultural ecology applied ideas from ecology and systems theory to understand the adaptation of humans to their environment. These cultural ecologists focused on flows of energy and materials, examining how beliefs and institutions in a culture regulated its interchanges with the natural ecology that surrounded it. In this perspective humans were as much a part of the ecology as any other organism. Important practitioners of this form of cultural ecology include Karl Butzer and David Stoddart."]}, {"page": "David Stoddart", "response": ["David Stoddart may refer to:", "*David Stoddart, Baron Stoddart of Swindon (1926\u20132020), British independent Labour politician", "*David Stoddart (geographer) (1937\u20132014), British physical geographer"]}, {"page": "Gold Medal (RGS)", "response": ["|David Stoddart"]}, {"page": "Stoddart", "response": ["*David Stoddart, Baron Stoddart of Swindon (born 1926), British independent Labour politician ", "*David Stoddart (geographer) OBE, coral atoll expert"]}, {"page": "International Coral Reef Society", "response": ["The Darwin Medal, the most prestigious award given by the International Society for Reef Studies, is presented every four years at the International Coral Reef Symposium.
