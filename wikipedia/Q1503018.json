The later part of his term was marred by a succession of disputed convictions. Lane's critics claimed that his refusal to believe that police evidence could be institutionally corrupt, and his reluctance to overturn the verdict of a jury, \"represented a dangerous hindrance to justice\". His failure to allow the appeal of the Birmingham Six in 1988 led to calls for his resignation following their successful appeal in 1991; an editorial in The Times \"urged him to go\", while 140 members of parliament signed a House of Commons motion to that effect.", "link_mentions": {}}}
