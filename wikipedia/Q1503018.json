The later part of his term was marred by a succession of disputed convictions. Lane's critics claimed that his refusal to believe that police evidence could be institutionally corrupt, and his reluctance to overturn the verdict of a jury, \"represented a dangerous hindrance to justice\". His failure to allow the appeal of the Birmingham Six in 1988 led to calls for his resignation following their successful appeal in 1991; an editorial in The Times \"urged him to go\", while 140 members of parliament signed a House of Commons motion to that effect.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lane (surname)", "response": ["* Geoffrey Lane, Baron Lane (1918\u20132005), British Judge "]}, {"page": "St Ippolyts", "response": ["Politician George Lloyd, 1st Baron Lloyd (1879-1941) was buried in the churchyard, as is Geoffrey Lane, Baron Lane (1918-2005), former Lord Chief Justice of England."]}, {"page": "2005 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["** Geoffrey Lane, Baron Lane, judge and former Lord Chief Justice (born 1918)"]}, {"page": "Deaths in August 2005", "response": ["*Geoffrey Lane, Baron Lane, 87, British judge and former Lord Chief Justice."]}, {"page": "Geoffrey Lane", "response": ["#REDIRECT Geoffrey Lane, Baron Lane"]}, {"page": "Geoffrey Dawson Lane", "response": ["#REDIRECT Geoffrey Lane, Baron Lane"]}, {"page": "Lord Lane", "response": ["#REDIRECT Geoffrey Lane, Baron Lane"]}, {"page": "Index of World War II articles (G)", "response": ["# Geoffrey Lane, Baron Lane"]}, {"page": "Derby", "response": ["* Geoffrey Lane, Baron Lane  AFC, PC, QC (1918\u20132005), judge  The Guardian, 23 Aug 2005, Obituary, Lord Lane of St Ippollitts  retrieved 28 February 2018 who served as Lord Chief Justice 1980\u20131992 "]}]}}
