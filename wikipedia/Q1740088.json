He provides the lead vocals and plays the keyboard for the band. 2-D's singing voice is provided by Blur frontman Damon Albarn on Gorillaz' recordings and performances; his speaking voice was provided by actor Nelson De Freitas in various Gorillaz direct-to-video projects such as Phase One: Celebrity Take Down and Phase Two: Slowboat to Hades. In 2017, Kevin Bishop was cast as the new speaking voice of 2-D. He was created by Albarn and Jamie Hewlett in 1998.", "While 2-D's singing voice is provided by Gorillaz co-creator Damon Albarn, his speaking voice is provided by actor and comedian Kevin Bishop. Albarn has claimed that 2-D's singing voice was developed from a vocal effect produced by equipment in his studio that he has said is \"not Auto-Tune, but it was an early form of synthetic voice\". Gorillaz engineer Stephen Sedgewick says of the effect, \"The main lo-fi telephone-like effect is the typical 2-D sound...I can't tell you what it is, but it's done with hardware. The plug-ins on the inserts are a Waves Renaissance De-esser and RVox, and the Waves Kramer PIE [compressor], which I use a lot on vocals.\" 2-D's main musical characteristic has been described by Albarn as being abstract and esoteric dystopian lyrics that are often recited through spoken word Sprechgesang. In contrast to his singing voice, 2-D's speaking voice is high-pitched and squeaky, and at one point he had a speech impediment and a strong lisp due to his missing teeth. Although he is from the West Sussex region of England, 2-D speaks in a mockney accent rather than a Sussex dialect. In his first spoken appearances on the press release interview CD \"The Apex Tapes\", 2-D's speaking voice was originally portrayed as being lower and softer than the high-pitched, wheezy speaking voice that the character later developed. In Gorillaz' first American press interview (an interview with Rolling Stone), Albarn and Hewlett attempted to provide the speaking voices of 2-D and bandmate Murdoc Niccals, as they had not yet chosen proper voice actors for the characters, but Albarn gave up and the act was dropped after three questions. After this, Nelson De Freitas was chosen as the speaking voice of 2-D. In 2017, De Freitas was replaced by actor and comedian Kevin Bishop, who was suggested by Harry Enfield after declining an offer to voice the character."]}, {"page": "Shane Cullinan", "response": ["Cullinan has continued to work for theatre and film and on projects with the Royal Opera House, The Urban Culture Project, Tonic Fold, Cargem Theatre, Hanby & Barrett, and Channel 4.
