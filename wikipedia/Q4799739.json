James, however, encouraged and assisted Arthur Mitchell in preparing an English translation of Creative Evolution. In August 1910, James died. It was his intention, had he lived to see the translation finished, to introduce it to the English reading public by a prefatory note of appreciation. In the following year, the translation was completed and still greater interest in Bergson and his work was the result. By coincidence, in that same year (1911), Bergson penned a preface of sixteen pages entitled Truth and Reality for the French translation of James's book, Pragmatism. In it, he expressed sympathetic appreciation of James's work, together with certain important reservations."]}, {"page": "Arthur Mitchell", "response": ["Arthur Mitchell may refer to:", "*Arthur Mitchell (physician) (1826\u20131909), antiquary, commissioner of Lunacy", "*Arthur Mitchell (cricketer) (1902\u20131976), former England Test cricketer", "*Arthur Mitchell (dancer) (1934\u20132018), African-American dancer and choreographer", "*Arthur Mitchell (Yukon politician) (born 1950), leader of the Canadian Yukon Liberal Party", "*Arthur Mitchell (character) a.k.a.

The writings of Scottish deputy commissioner for lunacy Arthur Mitchell claiming that cousin marriage had injurious effects on offspring were largely contradicted by researchers such as Alan Huth and George Darwin.Ottenheimer. p. 84 In fact, Mitchell's own data did not support his hypotheses and he later speculated that the dangers of consanguinity might be partly overcome by proper living. Later studies by George Darwin found results that resemble those estimated today. His father, Charles Darwin, who did marry his first cousin, had initially speculated that cousin marriage might pose serious risks, but perhaps in response to his son's work, these thoughts were omitted from a later version of the book they published. When a question about cousin marriage was eventually considered in 1871 for the census, according to George Darwin, it was rejected on the grounds that the idle curiosity of philosophers was not to be satisfied. In Southern Italy, cousin marriage was a common practice within regions such as Calabria and Sicily where first cousin marriage in the previous century was close to 50% of all marriages. Cousin marriage to third cousins is allowed and considered favourably in Greece."]}, {"page": "Sir John Ritchie Findlay, 1st Baronet", "response": ["In 1898 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.

The new buildings at Craig House were planned by Clouston, and designed under the control of architect Sydney Mitchell in 1887 (whose father Dr Arthur Mitchell was on the board of directors at the asylum). The actual job architect responsible for the design was Charles Henry Greig rather than Mitchell himself, despite Mitchell being widely credited for the design.
