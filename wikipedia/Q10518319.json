After Brodie scored two goals on his debut for Barrow in a 4\u20130 away victory Tamworth in the FA Cup fourth qualifying round, Barrow's joint-manager Darren Sheridan said \"He did well and he gives us more options for the team. It was a great debut from him and we know there is still more to come in the next few games\". This performance led to him being nominated as Player of the Round for the fourth qualifying round, which was eventually awarded to Sam Hatton of AFC Wimbledon. Barrow revealed that they were hoping to sign him permanently in January 2009 if his loan spell at the club proved successful. He made his league debut for Barrow in a 3\u20131 home victory over Forest Green Rovers and he scored against Gateshead in the Conference League Cup third round for Barrow, the match finishing 3\u20131 after extra time. It was agreed for Brodie's loan at the club to be extended following the match, but York overturned this decision a day later. He made his final appearance for Barrow in a 1\u20130 home defeat to Weymouth on 22 November 2008, finishing the spell with seven appearances and four goals.
