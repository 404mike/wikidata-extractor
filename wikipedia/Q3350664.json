Under van der Doort's care, and with the guidance of painter-dealers, painter-ambassadors and English painting virtuosi, Charles had assembled what Oliver Millar, in editing a modern edition of catalogue, reckoned was the best single English collection of paintings ever made.The catalogue is \"certainly the most important single source for our knowledge of the growth, arrangement and quality of a collection unrivalled in the history of English taste\" (Millar: Preface).  George Vertue's notes on the former Royal Collection were published in 1757, which is the reason that, following its long series of the Vertue notebooks, a collated edition of the four manuscript catalogues was published by the Walpole Society as its Volume 37 (1958\u201360); it was edited by Millar, who later followed van der Doort as Surveyor of the Queen's Pictures.
