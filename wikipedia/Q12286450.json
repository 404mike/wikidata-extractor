Set in London in 1934, the play involves a conflict between Melanie Klein and her daughter Melitta Schmideberg, after the death of Melanie's son Hans Klein. The depiction of Melanie Klein is quite unfavorable: the play suggests that Hans' death was a suicide and also reveals that Klein had analysed these two children. In the original production at the Cottesloe Theatre in London, Gillian Barge played Melanie Klein, with Zo\u00eb Wanamaker and Francesca Annis playing the supporting roles. In the 1995 New York revival of the play, Melanie Klein was played by Uta Hagen, who described Melanie Klein as a role that she was meant to play.Ben Brantley,\"Theater Review: Uta Hagen returns, tossing Wine,\" New York Times, 25 October 1995. The play was broadcast on the British radio station BBC 4 in 2008 and revived at the Almeida Theatre in London in October 2009 with Clare Higgins as Melanie Klein.thumb|Melanie Klein in 1950s"]}, {"page": "British Psychoanalytical Society", "response": ["|Melitta Schmideberg", "However, the assimilation of so many prominent Psychoanalysts from continental Europe created tensions.
