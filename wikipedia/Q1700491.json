He is the brother of jazz musician David Horler and the uncle of Natalie Horler, lead singer in the band Cascada.\nHorler began on piano at age six, and learned jazz from his father, a trumpeter. He studied at the Royal Academy of Music (1963\u201367), then played with the big bands of Bobby Lamb, Ray Premru, BBC Radio, Dave Hancock, and Maynard Ferguson. He worked with Tommy Whittle for much of the 1970s, Tony Coe later in the decade, Ronnie Ross for several years in the 1980s, Peter King in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and Jimmy Hastings around the same time as King. He led small groups intermittently and accompanied John Dankworth and Kenny Wheeler on record.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Only Fools and Horses", "response": ["Only Fools and Horses has separate theme songs for the opening and closing credits, \"Only Fools and Horses\" and \"Hooky Street\", respectively. The original theme tune was produced by Ronnie Hazlehurst and recorded on 6 August 1981 at Lime Grove Studios. Alf Bigden, Paul Westwood, Don Hunt, John Dean, Judd Proctor, Eddie Mordue, and Rex Morris were hired to play the music. The tune was changed after the first series, and the new one was written by John Sullivan (he disliked the tune for the first series, and his new one explained the show's title), and Hazlehurst conducted it. It was recorded at Lime Grove on 11 May 1982, with musicians John Horler, Dave Richmond, Bigden, and Proctor. Sullivan had intended Chas & Dave to sing it because they had enjoyed success with the \"Rockney\" style, a mixture of rock n' roll and traditional Cockney music. Sullivan was persuaded to do it himself by Ray Butt. Despite the creation of a new theme tune, the original one remained in occasional use. Chas & Dave did later contribute to the show, performing the closing credits song for the 1989 episode \"The Jolly Boys' Outing\". Both songs are performed by Sullivan himself, and not \u2013 as is sometimes thought \u2013 by Nicholas Lyndhurst."]}, {"page": "Cleo Laine", "response": ["By the late 1990s, Laine's concerts sold out across the globe, usually supported by Dankworth with his band, orchestra or smaller group.
