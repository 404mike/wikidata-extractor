Oliver, a surgeon. He attended the boarding school in Gainford, Yorkshire and was then medically educated at University College, London and University College Hospital, where he qualified MB in 1865 and MD in 1873.\nHe moved to Harrogate, Yorkshire and ran an extensive practice there from 1876 until his retirement in 1908. In 1887 he was elected a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians and in 1896 delivered their Croonian Lecture on the subject of the circulation of the blood. In 1904 he founded the Oliver-Sharpey lectureship to promote physiological research by observation and experiment, and to encourage the application of physiological knowledge to the prevention and cure of disease and the prolongation of life (The lectureship was founded in honor of William Sharpey, who was Oliver's physiology professor at University College, London.)\nOliver invented several instruments such as the haemoglobinometer, haemodynamometer and arteriometer. These instruments allowed him in 1893 to observe the effect an extract of sheep's adrenal gland had on human blood vessels. He continued the study of the glands of internal secretion, especially the suprarenals, in conjunction with Professor Edward Sch\u00e4fer at University College.\nHe died in retirement in Farnham, Surrey. He was married twice: firstly in 1872 to Alice Mary Hunt, who died in 1898 and secondly in 1900 to Mary Ledgard, who survived him.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Adrenal gland", "response": ["One of the most recognized works on the adrenal glands came in 1855 with the publication of On the Constitutional and Local Effects of Disease of the Suprarenal Capsule, by the English physician Thomas Addison. In his monography, Addison described what the French physician George Trousseau would later name Addison's disease, an eponym still used today for a condition of adrenal insufficiency and its related clinical manifestations. In 1894, English physiologists George Oliver and Edward Schafer studied the action of adrenal extracts and observed their pressor effects. In the following decades several physicians experimented with extracts from the adrenal cortex to treat Addison's disease. Edward Calvin Kendall, Philip Hench and Tadeusz Reichstein were then awarded the 1950 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discoveries on the structure and effects of the adrenal hormones."]}, {"page": "Harrogate", "response": ["In 1893 Harrogate doctor George Oliver was the first to observe the effect of adrenaline on the circulation."]}, {"page": "Edward Albert Sharpey-Schafer", "response": ["He is regarded as a founder of endocrinology: in 1894 he discovered and demonstrated the existence of adrenaline together with George Oliver, and he also coined the term \"endocrine\" for the secretions of the ductless glands.

Edward Albert Sch\u00e4fer was Professor of Physiology at University College London. In 1918, he prefixed the surname of his physiology teacher William Sharpey to his own to become Edward Albert Sharpey Schafer. The canonical story, told by Henry Hallett Dale, who worked at University College London from 1902 to 1904, runs as follows:", "However often this tale has been reiterated, it is not beyond doubt. Dale himself said that it was handed down in University College, and showed some surprise that the constriction of the radial artery was measurable. Of Oliver's descendants, none recalled experiments on his son.  Dale's report of subcutaneous injections contradicts the concerned parties. Oliver: \u201cDuring the winter of 1893\u20134, while prosecuting an inquiry as to \u2026 agents that vary the calibre of \u2026 arteries \u2026 I found that the administration by the mouth of a glycerine extract of the adrenals of the sheep and calf produced a marked constrictive action on the arteries.\u201d Sch\u00e4fer: \u201cIn the autumn of 1893 there called upon me in my laboratory in University College a gentleman who was personally unknown to me. \u2026 I found that my visitor was Dr. George Oliver, <who> was desirous of discussing with me the results which he had been obtaining from the exhibition by the mouth of extracts from certain animal tissues, and the effects which these had in his hands produced upon the blood vessels of man.\u201d Systemic effects of orally given adrenaline are highly unlikely. So details of the canonical text may be legend."]}]}}
