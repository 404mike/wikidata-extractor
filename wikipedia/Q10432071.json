He made nearly 250 appearances in the Football League playing for Oldham Athletic, Birmingham and Barnsley.Born in Dipton, near Stanley, County Durham, Brunskill worked as a coal miner and began his football career with works team Lintz Colliery F.C. A trial with Newcastle United came to nothing, but in October 1930 he signed for Huddersfield Town as an amateur, signing professional forms at the end of the 1930\u201331 season. The following season produced no first-team appearances so he moved on to Oldham Athletic, where he spent four seasons before Birmingham paid \u00a31,300 for his services. After two years and 65 appearances in all competitions, he joined Barnsley, with whom he won the championship of the Third Division (North) in 1938\u201339. During the Second World War he made guest appearances for Middlesbrough and Hartlepools United, and was released from his contract with Barnsley at the end of the war. He died in Boston, Lincolnshire, aged 75.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1987\u201388 in English football", "response": ["* 28 February 1988: Norman Brunskill, 75, played 237 league games at wing-half for Oldham Athletic, Birmingham City and Barnsley between 1932 and 1947."]}, {"page": "Brunskill", "response": ["* Norman Brunskill - English footballer"]}, {"page": "1937\u201338 Birmingham F.C. season", "response": ["Twenty-four players made at least one appearance in nationally organised competition, and there were thirteen different goalscorers.
