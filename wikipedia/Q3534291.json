Bonham-Carter was the first of the Bonham-Carters to begin their connection with the village of Buriton in Hampshire.  In 1910/11 he had Buriton House built, reputedly because his wife, Emily, did not like living in Buriton Manor, which was then a working farm. Bonham-Carter had two sons: Stuart Bonham Carter, who served in World Wars, reaching the rank of vice admiral in the Royal Navy, Algernon Bonham Carter, who was awarded the DSO in World War I, and a daughter, Esme, who became a Mrs Tomlinson and subsequently Mrs. Selwyn.  His brother-in-law was the fellow Hampshire cricketer Anthony Abdy.
