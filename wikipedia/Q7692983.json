A left-arm slow roundarm bowler with a remarkable capacity for drift, his most famous achievement was taking all ten wickets in an innings for the Players against the Australians in 1878. On three occasions, he took over 100 wickets in a season. His Wisden obituarist wrote of his bowling, \"At his best Barratt was certainly a very fine slow bowler, being able on certain wickets to get more work on the ball than almost any other cricketers of his generation.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1883 in sports", "response": ["* Most wickets \u2013 Ted Barratt 148 @ 15.90 (BB 8\u201328)"]}, {"page": "Jim Laker", "response": ["Laker finally secured his Test place in 1956 and took part in all five Tests against Australia. He took all ten wickets in an innings for Surrey against the Australians. This was the first time a bowler had taken all ten against the Australians since Ted Barratt in 1878. Laker took 46 wickets in the 1956 Ashes series to establish a still-unbroken record for a five-match Test series between England and Australia, but Sydney Barnes still holds the world record of 49 wickets taken in 1913\u201314 for England in South Africa. Laker's effort led to him being awarded the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award in 1956, the first cricketer to win the award. Surrey won the County Championship for the fifth consecutive time in 1956. Roy Webber's history of the competition was published soon afterwards and, in his review of the contemporary county teams, he wrote that \"it is difficult to imagine a better and more balanced bowling attack than that presented by Alec Bedser, Peter Loader, Stuart Surridge, Jim Laker and Tony Lock\"."]}, {"page": "Edward Barratt", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ted Barratt"]}, {"page": "Edward Barrett", "response": ["*Ted Barratt (1844\u20131891), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of tied first-class cricket matches", "response": ["Ted Barratt 67"]}, {"page": "Alfred Brooks (cricketer)", "response": ["Brooks made two first-class appearances for Nottinghamshire in 1877, both against Surrey.
