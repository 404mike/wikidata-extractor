He was appointed trainer to his former club, Bradford City, in the 1937 close season, and was succeeded a year later by his assistant, Harry Peel. The 1939 Register finds Alcock living in Marlborough Road, Bradford, with his wife, Cora n\u00e9e Busfield, and working as a manipulative masseur. Cora had herself followed the same occupation before their marriage. In November 1939, he was on duty at the local first-aid station while Cora slept downstairs at home. After a spark from the fire set light to her bedding, she woke to find the room full of smoke and managed to go upstairs and rescue their baby daughter. In 1953, Alcock became masseur to Yorkshire County Cricket Club, and the club extended his services to the touring Australians for that year's Headingley Test. He later became the county's physiotherapist, and retired from the role in the 1970s."]}, {"page": "List of Bradford City A.F.C. players", "response": ["|Harry Peel||||1929\u20131936||186||26||"]}, {"page": "Bradford derby", "response": ["|Harry Peel"]}, {"page": "Harry Peel", "response": ["Harry Peel may refer to:", "* Harry Peel (footballer) (1900\u20131976), English footballer", "* Harry Peel (ice hockey) (1879\u2013?), ice hockey player"]}]}}
