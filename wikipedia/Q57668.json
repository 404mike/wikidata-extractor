At the age of fifteen, she was married to her first cousin, King Christian VII of Denmark and Norway, who suffered from a mental illness and was cold to his wife throughout the marriage. She had two children: the future Frederick VI and Louise Augusta; the latter's biological father may have been the German physician Johann Friedrich Struensee.\nIn 1769, Struensee entered the service of the Danish king; initially Caroline Matilda treated him coldly, but he quickly won the Queen's heart and they began a love affair. Struensee gained more and more power and instituted a series of reforms that Caroline Matilda supported. Struensee's reforms and his relationship with the Queen generated powerful enemies, who included Christian VII's stepmother Queen Dowager Juliana Maria and her son Prince Frederick. Juliana Maria directed a plot to overthrow the lovers, which ended with the execution of Struensee and Caroline Matilda's divorce and banishment. She died in Celle, Hanover, at the age of twenty-three from scarlet fever.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of historical films set in Near Eastern and Western civilization", "response": ["| A Royal Affair || 2012 || 1766\u20131783 || Set at the court of the mentally ill King Christian VII of Denmark, and focuses on the romance between his wife, Caroline Matilda of Great Britain, and the royal physician Johann Friedrich Struensee."]}, {"page": "Caroline Matilda of Hanover", "response": ["#REDIRECT Caroline Matilda of Great Britain"]}, {"page": "List of Danish monarchs", "response": ["| Caroline Matilda of Great Britain8 November 1766Christiansborg Palacetwo children", "| 28 January 1768Christiansborg Palaceonly son of Christian VII and Caroline Matilda of Great Britain"]}, {"page": "List of Norwegian monarchs", "response": ["| Caroline Matilda of Great Britain8 November 1766Christiansborg Palacetwo children", "| 28 January 1768Christiansborg Palaceonly son of Christian VII and Caroline Matilda of Great Britain"]}, {"page": "Decapitation", "response": ["If the headsman's axe or sword was sharp and his aim was precise, decapitation was quick and is presumed to be a relatively painless form of death. If the instrument was blunt or the executioner was clumsy, repeated strokes might be required to sever the head, resulting in a prolonged and more painful death.  The person to be executed was therefore advised to give a gold coin to the headsman to ensure that he did his job with care. Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, and Mary, Queen of Scots required three strikes at their respective executions. The same could be said for the execution of Johann Friedrich Struensee, favorite of the Danish queen Caroline Matilda of Great Britain. Margaret Pole, 8th Countess of Salisbury, is said to have required up to 10 strokes before decapitation was achieved. This particular story may, however, be apocryphal (since highly divergent accounts exist).
