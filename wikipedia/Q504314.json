After a spell teaching at Lancing College he found permanent employment at the Royal Greenwich Observatory in 1891. He joined the Royal Astronomical Society in 1888 and was its president from 1929-1931. In 1895 he joined the British Astronomical Association and was president from 1904-1906 and directed its comet section 1898-1901 and 1907-1938.In 1910 for their studies of Halley\u2019s Comet Crommelin and Philip Herbert Cowell jointly received the Prix Jules Janssen from the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 astronomique de France. For this work they also received the Lindemann prize of the Astronomische Gesellschaft in Germany.In 1914 Crommelin published an introductory book on astronomy \u201cThe Star World\u201d.Crommelin had four children, of whom two died in a climbing accident on Pillar Rock, Ennerdale, in 1933. The de la Cherois line was succeeded through Crommelin's daughter Andrina. The author May Crommelin was one of Andrews cousins.\n\nAn expert on comets, his calculation of orbits of previously identified Comet Pons 1818 II, Comet Coggia-Winnecke 1873 VII, and Comet Forbes 1928 III in 1929, showed that these were one and the same periodic comet. It thus received the rather unwieldy name \"Comet Pons-Coggia-Winnecke-Forbes\".  In 1948, he was posthumously honored when the comet was renamed after him alone (today, in modern nomenclature, it is designated 27P/Crommelin). This is similar to the case of Comet Encke, where the periodic comet is named after the person who determined the orbit rather than the possibly-multiple discoverers and re-discoverers at each apparition. In 1937 Crommelin and Mary Proctor jointly published a book entitled \"Comets: Their Nature, Origin, and Place in the Science of Astronomy\u201d.Crommelin took part in several solar eclipse expeditions including those of 1896, 1900 and 1905. In 1919 he went to Sobral, in Brazil, and measured the amount of deflection of light caused by the gravitational field of the Sun. The results from these observations were crucial in providing confirmation of the General Theory of Relativity, which Albert Einstein had proposed in 1916.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "May 29", "response": ["*1919 \u2013 Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity is tested (later confirmed) by Arthur Eddington and Andrew Claude de la Cherois Crommelin."]}, {"page": "1939", "response": ["** Andrew Claude de la Cherois Crommelin, French astronomer (b. 1865)"]}, {"page": "List of astronomers", "response": ["| Andrew Claude de la Cherois Crommelin || UK || 1865 || 1939", "*Andrew Claude de la Cherois Crommelin (UK, 1865\u20131939)"]}, {"page": "Inex", "response": ["* Andrew Claude de la Cherois Crommelin (1901), \"The 29-Year Eclipse-Cycle\", The Observatory, 24 (1901), 379\u2013382 online link."]}, {"page": "Andrew Crommelin", "response": ["#REDIRECT Andrew Claude de la Cherois Crommelin"]}, {"page": "1939 in Ireland", "response": ["* 20 September \u2013 Andrew Claude de la Cherois Crommelin, astronomer (born 1865)."]}, {"page": "Crommelin, Andrew Claude de la Cherois", "response": ["#redirectAndrew Claude de la Cherois Crommelin"]}, {"page": "Andrew C.
