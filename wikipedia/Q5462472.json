Three of the founding members, Ricky Warwick, Stump Monroe and Floyd London were friends who met at school.  Although the band members musical roots were in punk, The Almighty adopted a more heavy metal/hard rock oriented musical direction in their early years. Later albums saw the band's musical style move towards the band members' original punk roots.", "The Almighty were formed in Strathaven, Scotland, on 19 January 1988. Most of the musicians came from a punk background. Lead singer Ricky Warwick had previously done some session and tour work with New Model Army, although not on any of their recordings. Ricky, drummer Stump Monroe and bass guitarist Floyd London were friends at school and had previously played together in a local band called Rough Charm.  The three were joined by guitarist Andy 'Tantrum' McCafferty to complete the band line-up.  Despite the band members largely punk rock roots, The Almighty followed a more heavy metal/hard rock oriented musical direction, and recorded an eight-track demo to help promote their early gigs.", "The band reformed in 2000 and released the self-titled album The Almighty, replacing guitarist Pete Friesen with Nick Parsons. A second album followed in 2001, Psycho-Narco, with a new bass player Gav Gray who replaced longtime bassist Floyd London. The band disbanded again with vocalist Ricky Warwick pursuing a solo career.", "In late 2020, Ricky Warwick announced the impending release of a box-set comprising the band's back catalogue from 1994 onwards, as well as demos and other material. He also stated that he is still in regular contact with Stumpy Munroe and Tantrum, but has not spoken with Pete Friesen or Floyd London for six years - making any potential band reunion highly unlikely, particularly given Warwick's ongoing role as frontman of the Black Star Riders and his own solo career. The box-set was released in March 2021; seven discs comprising the four albums released between 1994\u20132001, as well as B-sides, remixes, live recordings and demo tracks.", "*Floyd London - bass guitar (1988\u20132000, 2006\u20132008, 2009)", " bar:Floyd     text:\"Floyd London\""]}, {"page": "Ricky Warwick", "response": ["Warwick was born in Newtownards, County Down, Northern Ireland, where he spent his formative years and got his first guitar at 14 years old. He was soon playing along to songs by various rock and country acts such as Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash. Warwick quickly migrated to the music of more harder-edged acts such as Mot\u00f6rhead, MC5, Stiff Little Fingers and The Clash. He later reminisced that \"Those artists gave me a voice\", adding that \"...when no one would listen to a fourteen year old boy, they gave me something important to say.\" A year after he moved with his family to Strathaven in Scotland. It was at his new school in Scotland that Warwick first met his future bandmates Stump Monroe and Floyd London.", "Warwick got his first break in the late 1980s, when he was invited to join New Model Army as a rhythm guitarist on their The Ghost of Cain album world tour. He states that he learnt a great deal about songwriting and stagecraft during his time with the band. Warwick then left New Model Army and formed The Almighty in 1988 with guitarist Andy 'Tantrum' McCafferty and Warwick's former school-friends, drummer Stump Monroe and bass guitarist Floyd London. Warwick was the lead vocalist and played guitar in various formats of the band.  Although all four founding members had a strong background in punk rock music, The Almighty took a more heavy metal/hard rock orientated musical direction."]}, {"page": "Sherman Robertson", "response": ["Robertson was born in Breaux Bridge, Louisiana, and raised in Houston, Texas.
