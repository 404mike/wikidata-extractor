Until the publication of a book on Somerset cricketers in 2017, Berry was believed to be \"Wilfred Ernest Berry\", born in Hertford on the same date and with an unknown date of death in 1951. He was in fact born in Bridgwater, Somerset, where he also died.\nBerry made one first-class appearance for Somerset during the 1926 season, playing against Hampshire at the United Services Recreation Ground in Portsmouth. In the only innings in which he batted, as a tailender, he scored one run, and finished the innings not out. Berry bowled a total of four overs in the match, conceding 34 runs.", "link_mentions": {}}}
