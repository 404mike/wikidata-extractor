Admiral Sir John Jellicoe ordered two cruisers and four destroyers from Rosyth into the North Sea, to block the path of the ship if it sailed west and the light cruisers  (Captain Alan Geoffrey Hotham), Calliope and Blanche with the destroyer HMS Munster, from Scapa Flow (Scapa), to sweep the Norwegian coast in case it sailed north. Just after midnight, British wireless direction-finders identified a German ship off Egersund on the south-west coast of Norway and the light cruisers from Scapa were ordered to search an arc radiating from Egersund. Columbella and Patia of the 10th Cruiser Squadron, part of the Northern Patrol, were sent to search from the north end of the Shetland Isles to the north-east. The auxiliary cruiser HMS Andes, 15,620 GRT, (Captain G. B. W. Young) was already there, having arrived to relieve , 16,034 GRT, (Captain Thomas Erskine Wardle), which was due to sail to Liverpool to re-coal. Wardle had arranged to meet the relief  east of Shetland and was close to the meeting-point at 08:00, when a signal arrived ordering Alcantara to remain, because a disguised German auxiliary cruiser was expected to sail through the patrol line that day from the south."]}]}}
