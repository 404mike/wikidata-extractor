Outside the French-speaking world, she has also been mentioned as an inspiration to female singer-songwriters like Caroline Polachek, Charli XCX, Angel Olsen, Candie Payne, Erin Rae, Heather Trost, Violetta Zironi, Zooey Deschanel and Cat Power. Hardy has also been an influence to several alternative music acts, including Broadcast, Goldfrapp, Jeremy Jay, The Chap and Xeno & Oaklander.
