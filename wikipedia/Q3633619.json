She met Engels during his first stay in Manchester, probably early in 1843. It is likely that Burns guided Engels through the region, showing him the worst districts of Salford and Manchester for his research for The Condition of the Working Class in England.Mary Burns was the daughter of Michael Burns or Byrne, a dyer in a cotton mill, and of Mary Conroy. The family may have lived off Deansgate. She had a younger sister named Lydia (1827\u20131878), known as \u201cLizzie\", and a niece named Mary Ellen Burns (born 1859), known as \"Pumps\".\nAfter meeting in the 1840s, Burns and Engels formed a relationship that lasted until Burns' sudden death at the age of 41 on 7 January 1863. Although the custom of the day was marriage, the two politically opposed the bourgeois institution of marriage and never married. After her death Engels lived with her sister Lizzie, whom he married on 11 September 1878, hours before her death.Not much is written about Mary Burns. The only direct references to Mary Burns that have survived are a letter from Marx to Engels on learning of her death, saying she was \"very good natured\" and \"witty\", and a letter from Marx's daughter, Eleanor, saying she was \"very pretty, witty and an altogether charming girl, but in later years drank to excess\". No images of Burns are known to exist.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Karl Marx", "response": ["Unable either to stay in France or to move to Germany, Marx decided to emigrate to Brussels in Belgium in February 1845.

He had a great enjoyment of wine and other \"bourgeois pleasures\".

Taking Eric Hobsbawm to task for ignoring psychoanalytic questions altogether, Marcus rejects the simplistic formula of an Oedipal turn on his father, but argues for a more subtle understanding of Engels as envisioning a proletarian fury transformed into consciousness, thereby synthesizing and resolving his admiration and resentment of his own father. Nonetheless, Marcus argues that Engels never could overcome his middle-class feelings of superiority over his romantic partner, Mary Burns, despite his enduring love for her. Marcus then turns to comparing Engels's analysis of Manchester to those of major literary observers, including Charles Dickens, Thomas Carlyle, Benjamin Disraeli, Alexis de Tocqueville, Edwin Chadwick, and French economist L\u00e9on Faucher. Marcus argues that Engels succeeds along with Dickens not because they get their data right or wrong, but because they echo the deepest unconscious contradictions of men."]}, {"page": "Sociology of Manchester", "response": ["In Manchester Engels met Mary Burns, a fierce young working woman with radical opinions with whom he began a relationship that lasted until her death in 1862.\"Friedrich Engels in Manchester\", Roy Whitfield, 1988 The two never married, as both were against the institution of marriage, which Engels saw as unnatural and unjust.
