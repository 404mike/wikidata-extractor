The brief was to emulate The Museum of Practical Geology of \"London, but embracing, in addition, the economic products of the animal and vegetable kingdoms\". The general director of the museum would be responsible to the Board. The university's Regius Professor of natural history continued as Keeper of its collection, with access to specimens to illustrate lectures, and also reported directly to the Board. In 1855 George Wilson was appointed as the museum's first director, he pressed ahead with preparations while H.M. Board of Works organised designs, but died in 1859.
