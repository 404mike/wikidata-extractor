During a 14-year first-class cricket career, he also represented Cambridge University, Middlesex and the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC).\nHe made his debut in first-class cricket for Cambridge University, where he was awarded his Blue. He then spent nine seasons playing for Somerset, and captained the side for the last five of those seasons. Working as a schoolmaster at Highgate School in London from 1876\u20131884, his playing opportunities for the south-western county were limited, and from 1885 he only played first-class cricket at Lord's, representing Middlesex in three matches that season, and appearing for the MCC on nine occasions over six years. He returned to play for Somerset in 1887 and 1890 when they had lost their first-class status. He worked as headmaster of Loudon House School in London for some years from 1888, and died following an operation in 1916 in Ipswich.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Nailsea", "response": ["Mervyn Kitchen was born in Nailsea in 1940.

Stephen Newton was the club's first official captain, holding the position during the county's first three seasons of first-class cricket, from 1882 to 1884.  Due to his commitments as a schoolmaster in London, he did not play in the opening three matches of 1882, so other players were required to deputise for him in these fixtures. Edward Sainsbury, who took over from Newton for the 1885 season, captained the side in the joint fewest matches along with Mandy Mitchell-Innes: both players captained Somerset in six first-class matches.  During the 1885 season, Somerset failed to arrange sufficient fixtures with the other first-class teams to be retain its first-class status, and matches played between 1886 and 1890 were considered 'second-class'.  During this time, the captaincy was transferred to Herbie Hewett who, after captaining his side unbeaten against county opposition in 1890, retained the captaincy upon Somerset's return to first-class cricket the following summer.Foot (1986), pp23\u201328. Hewett continued as captain for three further seasons, but retired from the captaincy and the club at the end of the 1893 season following an incident in which he felt his authority had been undermined by the club.Foot (1986), pp42\u201345. His successor as captain was Sammy Woods, who remained in the position for twelve years, the longest by any Somerset captain.  Woods, born on the outskirts of Sydney in Australia had played three Test matches for Australia in the late 1880s, and was Somerset's first captain of overseas origin, although he lived the rest of his life in Somerset and also played three Tests for England. He led Somerset in 230 first-class matches, and holds the record for both the most first-class and the most overall matches captained by any Somerset player."]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Stephen Newton (1882\u20131884) 16 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Ted Sainsbury", "response": ["Most commonly employed as a right-handed opening batsman, Sainsbury was one of Somerset's most talented batsman during their formative years. His slow underarm bowling was effective in second-class cricket, but in an era when overarm bowling was becoming the standard, he was used sparingly in the first-class game. During his time at Somerset, the county gained first-class status. After being led for three seasons by Sainsbury's Lansdown team-mate Stephen Newton, Sainsbury was given the Somerset captaincy for the 1885 season. A combination of poor results and not being able to raise a full eleven during that season led to the county's removal from the first-class game, although Sainsbury remained as captain until 1888. By the time Somerset had improved sufficiently to return to first-class cricket in 1891, Sainsbury had moved to neighbouring county Gloucestershire, where he saw out his county cricket career.", "Sainsbury played alongside his older brother, Francis, for Lansdown Cricket Club from at least 1865. His first recorded appearance for a representative county side was in August 1877, when he played for Somerset, against their Dorset neighbours. He opened the batting for the Somerset team alongside Hamilton Ross. Both had been scoring plenty of runs for Lansdown in club cricket,Roebuck (1991), p. 19. and Sainsbury made 32, a respectable score in the match, which Somerset won by an innings. Only Edward Lloyd scored more, posting an unbeaten 110, one of the earliest centuries scored for a Somerset county side. Sainsbury also opened the bowling during the match, but he claimed only one wicket over the two innings and bowled just 13 of the 104 overs. A few days later he appeared again for the county side, against Clifton, who had the Australian Test cricketer, Billy Midwinter, in their team. Sainsbury scored 96 not out, including a \"resolute\" partnership with Stephen Newton, before rain forced the game to be drawn. Subsequently, he scored 7 and 81 against the Wiltshire Wanderers, and took ten wickets in the match, including six in the first innings. In two further appearances for Somerset in 1877, Sainsbury did not surpass the score he reached against Dorset but claimed two further wickets, both against the Gentlemen of Wiltshire. Sainsbury finished the season top of Somerset's batting averages, having scored 230 runs at an average of 46.00.", "Sainsbury batting scores dipped in county cricket during 1879; in nine appearances for Somerset during the year, his highest score was 39. He performed better with the ball, twice taking four wickets during an innings, against both Bedfordshire and the MCC. The following county season began more positively for Sainsbury, as he collected nine wickets in the match against Sussex at Lansdown's ground in Bath, claiming six wickets for 54\u00a0runs in the second innings of the game. He claimed another eight wickets when Somerset travelled to Leicestershire, during which Sainsbury and Arnold Fothergill took five wickets each in Leicestershire's first innings, restricting the home side to 51\u00a0runs. Somerset won the low-scoring contest by 85\u00a0runs, Sainsbury having scored a valuable 28 during his side's first innings. Somerset's visit to Sussex saw Sainsbury continue his success against the county, this time with the bat rather than the ball. Sussex built on their 63 run first innings lead with a second innings total of 183, leaving Somerset the task of scoring 247 runs to win the match. Sainsbury scored his second century for Somerset, remaining 101 not out when Somerset reached the winning total. He was assisted by a half-century from Stephen Newton, and scores in the twenties by Bill Fowler and Frederick Smith. Later that month, his batting was once again instrumental in setting up a Somerset victory, when he top-scored with 87 as Somerset beat the MCC by an innings.", "Towards the end of the 1870s, journalists had suggested that Somerset chose their players \"upon breeding rather than skill\".Roebuck (1991), p. 20. The best players in the county, many of whom were not wealthy men, were unable to afford to play for Somerset. In turn, the cricket club could not afford to pay professionals to play for them, and were regarded as an occasional amateur outfit by many, rather than a side that could truly represent the strength of cricket within the county. The arrival of two professional players, and the acquisition of a permanent home ground in Taunton helped strengthen the club so that in 1882 they were admitted as a first-class county.Roebuck (1991), pp. 20\u201328. Bill Roe, at the time a schoolboy, rated Sainsbury as \"by far the best batsman in the side\" during their pre-first-class years. On 8 June 1882, Somerset played their first match to be universally considered first-class, against Lancashire. After losing the toss and fielding for over 150 overs as Lancashire scored 237, Somerset responded with a first innings total of 29 \u2013 their second lowest total ever in first-class cricket. Sainsbury and his fellow opening batsman, Fowler, top-scored for Somerset with 9\u00a0runs each, and both were once again the highest scorers in the second innings, when Fowler scored 18 and Sainsbury 17\u00a0runs out of a total of 51. Somerset were beaten by an innings and 157 runs, and batted for less than 70\u00a0overs. The county suffered further heavy defeats in their next two matches, losing to Gloucestershire and Hampshire, with no Somerset batsman reaching a half-century in either match. Sainsbury reached his first half-century in first-class cricket when Somerset hosted Hampshire at the County Ground \u2013 teammates Robert Ramsay and Stephen Newton also passed 50 for the county in this match, which helped Somerset to their maiden first-class victory. Sainsbury claimed a wicket in each innings of the match, during which he bowled just eight overs: in the first innings he bowled one over, conceding one run and claiming one wicket. In first-class matches in 1882, Sainsbury scored 255 runs at an average of 17.00, exceeding 50 on only one occasion. He bowled infrequently, claiming four wickets at an average in excess of 40.", "Following the departure of Somerset captain Stephen Newton, who played all his first-class cricket in London from the 1885 season onwards, Sainsbury was given the club captaincy. Somerset's first county match of the season took place in mid-July, almost two months after four of the counties had contested matches. The match, played against Hampshire, showed little sign of the troubles that were to come. Sainsbury scored 0 and 13 opening the batting for his side, but the bowling of Edward Bastard, who claimed eight wickets in the first innings and three in the second, helped Somerset to a five-wicket victory. The county's next match, played two weeks later against Gloucestershire, was their heaviest defeat when losing by an innings to that point. Gloucestershire won the toss and elected to bat, totalling 448 in 190\u00a0overs; Somerset bowlers James Parfitt and Charles Winter both conceding over 100 runs. In reply, five of the Somerset batsman were out for ducks; Sainsbury, Parfitt and Albert Clapp were the only ones to reach double figures. Sainsbury top-scored with 40\u00a0runs, but a team total of 100 meant that Gloucestershire forced his side to follow-on. The second innings progressed even more poorly for Somerset. Sainsbury was one of eight batsmen who failed to reach double figures, and the team was dismissed for 80\u00a0runs, resulting in an innings and 268\u00a0run loss."]}, {"page": "Madison Museum of Fine Art", "response": ["Founded in 2005 by Michele L.

As such, Challen's debut in first-class cricket came in August 1884, when he played for Somerset against Hampshire. Somerset lost the match by a large margin, but after scoring 11 runs in the first innings, Challen made his team's highest score in the second, finishing with 93 runs. Challen, along with Stephen Newton, played a similar role in the next match; Somerset were trailing after both teams had batted their first innings, and after following-on, Challen and Newton resisted the Lancashire bowling. When Challen was dismissed for 42 runs, the Western Daily Press said that \"it was felt that the chances of Somerset were very poor.\" They went on to lose by eight wickets. It was as a bowler that Challen was most effective in the following match against second-class Devon. In a spell described in the Exeter and Plymouth Gazette Daily Telegram as \"destructive\", Challen took four wickets in the first innings against a weak Devon side, helping Somerset earn victory by an innings. Challen completed the season with two further first-class appearances, return matches against Hampshire and Lancashire, in which he did not score many runs. In his four first-class matches in 1884, he scored 176 runs at an average of 25.14, and took seven wickets at 22.71. He also made six appearances for the East Somerset Cricket Club, where he was one of their top batsmen, scoring 155 runs at an average of just over 30."]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club seasons", "response": ["|align=left|Stephen Newton"]}, {"page": "Somerset County Cricket Club in 1885", "response": ["The 1885 season was an annus horribilis for Somerset County Cricket Club.
