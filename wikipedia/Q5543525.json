He captained three sealing expeditions to the Antarctic Ocean between 1818 and 1822.  \nPowell was born in London. During his first expedition, in 1818 and 1819, he captained the sloop Dove and visited South Georgia and Kerguelen Islands.  His second expedition, captaining Eliza, lasted from 1819 until 1821, during which time he visited the Falkland Islands and the South Shetland Islands.In 1821 and 1822 he took both Dove, which he captained, and Eliza, captained by John Wright, on another sealing expedition to the South Shetland Islands, for which he produced a very fine chart based on his own observations of the north coast of the group and the observations of others for the southern coast.  On 6 December 1821, he co-discovered the South Orkney Islands along with American Nathaniel Palmer, claiming them in the name of King George IV.Both Powell Island and Powell Basin are named after him. He died in Tonga.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1821", "response": ["* December 6 \u2013 The South Orkney Islands are discovered by seal hunters George Powell and Nathaniel Palmer."]}, {"page": "1821 in science", "response": ["* December 6 \u2013 The South Orkney Islands are discovered by George Powell and Nathaniel Palmer."]}, {"page": "South Shetland Islands", "response": ["* Chart of South Shetland including Coronation Island from the exploration of the sloop Dove in the years 1821 and 1822 by George Powell Commander of the same.

Weddell initially sailed for Madeira for provisions for the Antarctic voyage, whilst Brisbane headed for Bonavista in the Cape Verde islands for a cargo of salt with which to cure seal skins. In December, they met up at Port St Elena in what is now Chile. Brisbane sailed south to hunt for seals arranging to rendezvous with Weddell at Penguin Island on the Patagonian coast. On New Year's Day 1823, they met up once again before sailing south to the South Orkney Islands.

They arrived in the islands on 12 January 1823 and began sealing but with little success. Brisbane conducted a rough survey of the southern coasts of the islands and in response Weddell named the cliffs on the north point of Powell Island Brisbane's Bluff (now known as Cape Faraday).
