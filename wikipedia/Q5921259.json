F.M Shepard, the British consul in Danzig, reported that the Danzig Nazis were bringing arms from Germany and building fortifications.Prazmowska, Anita \"Poland, the 'Danzig Question', and the Outbreak of the Second World War\" pp. 394\u2013408 from The Origins of the Second World War edited by Frank McDonough, London: Continuum, 2011 p. 404.  In July 1939, the British government reluctantly extended its \"guarantee\" of Poland to the status of Free City of Danzig, stating a German attempt to take Danzig would be a casus belli.Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew The Road to War, Random House: London 2009 p. 18. At the beginning of August, the Senate told Warsaw that henceforward the Free City would no longer recognize the authority of Polish customs officers in Danzig, which led Beck in response to warn that the Senate did not have the right to disregard the terms of the Treaty of Versailles and that the German government also did not have the right to speak for Danzig.Prazmowska, Anita \"Poland, the 'Danzig Question', and the Outbreak of the Second World War\" pp. 394\u2013408 from The Origins of the Second World War edited by Frank McDonough, London: Continuum, 2011 p. 406. Much to the chagrin of the British Foreign Office, Warsaw did not consult Britain first when it issued a warning that the Polish Air Force would bomb Danzig if the authority of Polish customs officers continued to be ignored. The Senate backed down while the British who were informed after the fact of the Polish decision to confront the Free City were thrown into panic over the possibility of an armed clash in Danzig plunging Europe into war. The British ambassador to Poland, Sir Howard William Kennard, sought in vain for a promise from Colonel Beck that Poland would take no action in Danzig without first obtaining British approval. Beck disliked Kennard and kept him in the dark about what Poland would do if Danzig voted to rejoin Germany, but also about the state of German-Polish relations, much to the vexation of the Foreign Office.Prazmowska, Anita \"Poland, the 'Danzig Question', and the Outbreak of the Second World War\" pp. 394\u2013408 from The Origins of the Second World War edited by Frank McDonough, London: Continuum, 2011 p. 405."]}, {"page": "Alfred Austin", "response": ["On 14 November 1865 Austin married Hester Jane Homan-Mulock, tenth child of Thomas Homan-Mulock and Frances Sophia Berry at St Marylebone Parish Church, London. In his Autobiography, Austin gives a curious account of their first meeting with her. Seeing the photograph of a young lady in an album belonging to a friend in Florence, he had asked: \"Who is that?\" and received the reply, \"The girl you ought to marry, if you can.\" Austin brought home a letter of introduction, the presentation of which led to his receiving at his cottage in Hertfordshire two of the Misses Mulock and their chaperon, together with their friend T. A. Trollope, brother of Anthony Trollope. At the second visit Hester became engaged to Alfred. Throughout his career as journalist and writer Austin derived constant help and support from his wife. She died suddenly on 23 September 1929 at her residence in Kensington. His nephews included the Polar Explorer Captain George Mulock and British diplomat Sir Howard William Kennard (1878\u20131955), British Ambassador to Poland at the outbreak of the Second World War."]}, {"page": "Corfu incident", "response": ["Lord Curzon, wrote that the \"terms demanded by Mussolini are extravagant-much worse than the ultimatum after Sarajevo\".Axelord, Alan Benito Mussolini 2002 p.165 In a telegram to the Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, who was vacationing at Aix-les-Bains, Lord Curzon wrote that Mussolini's actions were \"violent and inexcusable\" and if Britain did not support the Greek appeal to the League of Nations then \"that institution may as well shut its doors\".Harold Nicolson and Sir William Tyrrell at the Foreign Office wrote a memo calling for \"concentrating our efforts to protect Greece through the agency of the League of Nations against an unfair exploitation by Italy\". Lord Curzon's initial attempt to end the crisis by referring it to the League of Nations was dropped after Mussolini threatened to leave the League.Axelord, Alan Benito Mussolini, Indianapolis: Alpha Books 2002 p.165 More importantly, sanctions against Italy would require the approval of the League Council and it was believed that France would veto any sanctions against Italy if the Corfu incident was referred to the League. Within Whitehall, the Treasury objected to sanctions against Italy under the grounds that the United States was not a member of the League and any League sanctions if adopted would be ineffective as the United States would continue to trade with Italy while the Admiralty demanded a declaration of war against Italy as the prerequisite of a blockade. Howard William Kennard, in charge of the British embassy in Rome as the ambassador Sir Ronald Graham was on vacation, wrote in a dispatch to Lord Curzon that Mussolini was possibly insane, a man suffering from a \"mixture of megalomania and extreme patriotism\".Axelord, Alan Benito Mussolini Indianapolis: Alpha Books 2002 p.166 Kennard drew the conclusion that Mussolini was perhaps rash enough to turn the crisis into an all-out war between Italy and Greece as he kept demanding sums of money in compensation that were well beyond Greece's ability to pay. However, Kennard believed that the Fascist regime was the only thing saving Italy from communism, and if Mussolini were defeated in a war, then the Fascist regime would collapse and the Italian Communist Party would take over.Axelord, Alan Benito Mussolini Indianapolis: Alpha Books2002 p.166 As Kennard much preferred Fascism in power in Italy to Communism, this led him to advocate appeasement, saying that Britain must pressure Greece to submit to the Italian terms while trying to persuade Mussolini to lower the compensation amounts as the best way of avoiding a war. Farther afield, Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia were more supportive of Greece with both governments condemning Italy's actions."]}, {"page": "List of ambassadors of the United Kingdom to Poland", "response": ["*1935\u20131941: Sir Howard William Kennard"]}, {"page": "Sir Howard William Kennard", "response": ["#REDIRECT Howard William Kennard"]}, {"page": "1938 Birthday Honours", "response": ["* Sir Howard William Kennard, , His Majesty's Ambassador Extraordinary & Plenipotentiary at Warsaw."]}, {"page": "1923 New Year Honours", "response": ["* Howard William Kennard, Counsellor of His Majesty's Embassy at Rome."]}, {"page": "Howard Kennard", "response": ["#REDIRECTHoward William Kennard"]}, {"page": "1929 New Year Honours", "response": ["*Howard William Kennard  His Majesty's Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at Belgrade."]}, {"page": "List of Knights and Dames Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George", "response": ["|Sir Howard William Kennard"]}, {"page": "List of Knights Commander of the Order of the Star of India", "response": ["*Howard William Kennard  His Majesty's Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at Belgrade.United Kingdom and British Empire: "]}, {"page": "Ni\u0161 Commonwealth Military Cemetery", "response": ["The cemetery was laid out in 1929 and was built by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission to a design by Sir Robert Lorimer.
