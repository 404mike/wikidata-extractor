He was born in Alyth, Perthshire.\nWith Silly Wizard he not only sang, but also played the tenor banjo, mandolin and tin whistles.\nStewart toured with Silly Wizard until the band broke up in 1988. After this, he recorded four solo albums, as well as three with Manus Lunny. Several of Stewart's songs became well-known within the folk community, including \"The Ramblin' Rover\", \"Golden, Golden\", \"The Queen of Argyll\" and \"The Valley of Strathmore\". In addition, his renditions of classic Robert Burns songs have been well received.Failed spinal surgery in 2012 left Stewart paralyzed from the chest down. He died from a stroke on 27 December 2015, aged 63.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Scottish folk music", "response": ["The fusing of various styles of American music with British folk created a distinctive form of fingerstyle guitar playing known as folk baroque, pioneered by figures including Davy Graham and Bert Jansch. This led in part to British progressive folk music, which attempted to elevate folk music through greater musicianship, or compositional and arrangement skills. Many progressive folk performers continued to retain a traditional element in their music, including Jansch who became a member of the band Pentangle in 1967. Others largely abandoned the traditional element of their music. Particularly important were Donovan (who was most influenced by emerging progressive folk musicians in America such as Bob Dylan) and the Incredible String Band, who from 1967 incorporated a range of influences including medieval and Eastern music into their compositions, leading to the development of psychedelic folk, which had a considerable impact on progressive and psychedelic rock.J. DeRogatis, Turn on Your Mind: Four Decades of Great Psychedelic Rock (Milwaukie MI, Hal Leonard, 2003), , p. 120. Acoustic groups who continued to interpret traditional material through into the 1970s included Ossian and Silly Wizard.S. Broughton, M. Ellingham and R. Trillo, eds, World Music: Africa, Europe and the Middle East (London: Rough Guides, 1999), , pp. 267. The Boys of the Lough and Battlefield Band, emerged from the flourishing Glasgow folk scene. Also from this scene were the highly influential The Clutha, whose line up, with two fiddlers, was later augmented by the piper Jimmy Anderson, and the Whistlebinkies, who pursued a strongly instrumental format, relying on traditional instruments, including a Cl\u00e0rsach (Celtic harp).Broughton, Ellingham and Trillo, World Music: Africa, Europe and the Middle East, pp. 261\u20133. Many of these groups played largely music originating from the Lowlands, while later, more successful bands tended to favor the Gaelic sounds of the Highlands. While fairly popular within folk circles, none of these groups achieved the success of Irish groups such as The Chieftains and The Dubliners. Some of these bands produced noted solo artists, including Andy M. Stewart of Silly Wizard, Brian McNeill of Battlefield Band, and Dougie MacLean of the Tannahill Weavers. MacLean is perhaps the best known of these, having written \"Caledonia,\" one of Scotland's most beloved songs."]}, {"page": "Andy Stewart", "response": ["* Andy M.
