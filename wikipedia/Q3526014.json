He made 57 Test, and 639 first-class cricket appearances in total, taking 1,473 catches. The 2,069 victims across his entire career is the most of any wicket-keeper in first-class history. He is considered one of the world's most accomplished wicket-keepers. He made his first-class debut for Minor Counties against South Africa in 1960, having made his Staffordshire debut in 1958. He became Derbyshire's first choice wicket-keeper when George Dawkes sustained a career-ending injury. His final First Class appearance was at the Scarborough Festival in 1988. He remained first choice until his retirement except for a short period in 1964 when Laurie Johnson was tried as a batsman-wicketkeeper.\nTaylor made his Test debut in 1971 in New Zealand at the end of the successful Ashes winning tour. Though highly regarded, Taylor was unable to displace incumbent Alan Knott, a talented keeper and a superior batsman. It was only when Knott joined World Series Cricket in 1977 that Taylor appeared in more Tests and was selected as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1977. He continued to be England's choice keeper through the 1970s, falling three short of a maiden Test century in the 1978\u201379 Ashes, and retiring from Tests in 1984 \u2013 though he would make an emergency appearance for a day of Test cricket in 1986 \u2013 and all first-class cricket in 1988.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ian Botham", "response": ["Botham's third overseas tour was to India in February 1980.

England took sixteen players on tour and fourteen of these had featured against the Rest of the World. The other two were reserve wicket-keeper Bob Taylor and Yorkshire batsman John Hampshire.

It also included four England players: Norman Gifford, Tony Greig, Richard Hutton and Bob Taylor. The World XI won this series 2\u20131. As there were no more scheduled South African tours, the need for a World XI lapsed and it was many years before the concept was resurrected. South Africa as a team were banned from international cricket while the apartheid system existed, though many individual South African players were able to take part in the major domestic competitions of other countries.
