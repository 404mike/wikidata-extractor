His form with Spartans was impressive enough to earn a \u00a3250 move to Newcastle United in 1929. He went on to play over 200 league games for the Magpies, and after ending his playing career in 1938 joined the coaching staff where he remained until 1977, serving the club for 48 years. He died in 1977.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jackie Milburn", "response": ["Although a boyhood Sunderland fan, Milburn and his Northumberland ATC teammates were invited to St James' Park by Newcastle United director Wilf Taylor, after a match against Yorkshire ATC in 1943. Milburn, along with his friend and teammate Raymond Poxton, attended United's final home game of the season. Milburn was distinctly unimpressed with what he saw, turning to his friend and saying \"Raymond, we could play better than this, surely?\" Soon after, he responded to an advertisement for trialists published in the North Mail Newspaper by Newcastle United prior to the 1943\u201344 season. The first trial was held in midweek and Milburn scored two goals in one half, earning an invitation to return on Saturday for a public trial at St James' and an 'amateur contract'. He arrived long before the 2pm kick-off with a pair of borrowed football boots wrapped in brown paper, and his lunch \u2013 two pies and a bottle of pop. Milburn's team of fellow trialists ('The Stripes') played against a Newcastle United First XI featuring Albert Stubbins and Jimmy Gordon ('The Blues'). The Stripes trailed 3\u20130 at half time and Joe Richardson told Milburn: \"you'd better buck your ideas up son, if you want to come here\". Switched to centre forward in the second half, Milburn scored six times as his side won 9\u20133. The Sunday Sun reported that \"United's second trial proved a triumph for Milburn, the Ashington inside-left, who was signed as an amateur earlier in the week. Milburn, a tall youth, showed a capacity for opportunism. Twice Milburn scored two goals within a minute\"."]}, {"page": "Eric Brook", "response": ["In April 1939, Brook was selected to play for the FA XI on a tour in South Africa. Brook, like his City teammate Frank Swift, was selected to represent England in wartime internationals. Brook won two wartime caps in games against Wales and South Africa in 1939. In the game against South Africa, Brook captained England in a 3\u20130 victory. In the match against Wales, Brook played alongside his Manchester City teammates Frank Swift and Bert Sproston. The England team also included Joe Mercer, who would go on to manage Manchester City in the 1960s. In 1940, Brook was selected to represent England in a wartime international against Scotland. Whilst travelling to the match, he and Sam Barkas were involved in a car crash. Brook suffered a fractured skull. Brook and Barkas were replaced in the England team by Joe Richardson and the Scottish International Tommy Pearson. Brook received \u00a31,625 in compensation for the collision."]}, {"page": "Joseph Richardson", "response": ["Joseph or Joe Richardson may refer to:", "* Joe Richardson (footballer, born 1908) (1908\u20131977), English footballer", "* Joe Richardson (footballer, born 1942) (1942\u20131966), English footballer", "* Joe Richardson (rugby league) (1879\u20131904), English rugby league player"]}, {"page": "List of people from Northumberland", "response": ["* Joe Richardson (1908\u20131977), played for Newcastle United"]}]}}
