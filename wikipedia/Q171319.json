Driver and commentator Anthony Davidson said that Tilke \"understands the demands of the modern cars...he gives us run-off areas and it's all well thought out. They are enjoyable to race on because they suit modern F1 cars. At a track like Silverstone you do not get as much overtaking because it was designed for cars that were slower and did not depend on downforce for speed. But the circuits designed in recent years have a long straight and bigger braking zone.\" He particularly praised Turn Eight of Istanbul Park. Similar praise has come from Clive Bowen, the managing director of Apex Circuit Design (Tilke's business partner in several large projects including Sepang International Circuit and Bahrain International Circuit), who called Istanbul \"a technical and aesthetic tour de force\".

He qualified 18th for the season-opening  and finished fifth following a plethora of first-lap retirements in his debut race. Stoddart consequently retained Webber for the rest of the season. At the  four races later, Webber and his teammate Alex Yoong were withdrawn from the race due to three wing failures during practice. He outperformed Yoong and the latter's two-race replacement Anthony Davidson since he was the only Minardi driver using power steering due to budgetary constraints.

It remains unclear whether the difference was due to the change of tyre supplier from Michelin to Bridgestone, the driving abilities of Fernando Alonso, or simply being outpaced in off-season development by the other top teams. Another possibility is that the team's wind tunnel was giving inaccurate data in late 2006 which affected the development of the 2007 car. This was cited by Pat Symonds in an issue of F1 Racing Magazine. In the early races, Fisichella obtained better results than rookie teammate Kovalainen, but in Canada and the USA it was the Finn who claimed the higher finishes. Fisichella was disqualified from the Canadian Grand Prix, along with Ferrari's Felipe Massa, for exiting the pit lane while the traffic light was showing red, the purpose of which is to prevent cars rejoining the race ahead of the safety car. He later stated that he had been busy avoiding other cars in the pit lane and had simply not noticed the red light. The Renault team seemed to have made significant progress in terms of pace by the Spanish Grand Prix, but a series of fuel rig problems meant that neither driver was able to capitalise on this apparent increase in performance. Fisichella crashed into the Super Aguri of Anthony Davidson at the 2007 Hungarian Grand Prix which broke his rear suspension and forced him to retire."]}, {"page": "2004 Spanish Grand Prix", "response": ["| Anthony Davidson"]}, {"page": "2004 Monaco Grand Prix", "response": ["| Anthony Davidson"]}, {"page": "12 Hours of Sebring", "response": ["|  Anthony Davidson   Marc Gen\u00e9 Alexander Wurz"]}]}}
