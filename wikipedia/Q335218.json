In 1920 he was appointed as the first High Commissioner for Palestine.\nSamuel was the last member of the Liberal Party to hold one of the four Great Offices of State (as Home Secretary from 1931\u201332 in the National Government of Ramsay MacDonald). One of the adherents of \"New Liberalism\", Samuel helped to draft and present social reform legislation while he was serving as a Liberal cabinet member.

The ability of Great Britain to limit French action was also significantly diminished. France issued an ultimatum and intervened militarily at the Battle of Maysalun in July 1920, deposing the Arab government and removing King Faisal from Damascus in August 1920. In 1920, Great Britain appointed Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel as high commissioner and established a mandatory government in Palestine that remained in power until 1948."]}]}}
