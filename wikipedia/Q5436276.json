According to actor Matt Smith, there were \"between 50 and 60 prosthetic aliens\" in a scene set in an alien market. The Doctor features minimally in the first act because Smith was busy filming pick-ups or reshoots for \"Nightmare in Silver\". Millennium FX's Neill Gorton remarked that he had \"always wanted to do a scene like the Star Wars cantina\" and had worked on different moulds in his spare time in case they could be used in the future, as making thirty different aliens at one time would be out of the budget. Much of the episode was constructed around talks of what could be created with limited resources. For example, Cross recalled that producer Marcus Wilson called him and asked, \"We've always wanted to have a speeder-bike like in Return of the Jedi and we know how to do it inexpensively, so can you get one into the story?\" However, Cross felt that the speeder-bike ended up having more in common with Flash Gordon. The songs were written by composer Murray Gold.
