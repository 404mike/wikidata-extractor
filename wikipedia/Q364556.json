Henry Irving's 1882 production at the Lyceum Theatre (with himself as Romeo and Ellen Terry as Juliet) is considered an archetype of the pictorial style. In 1895, Sir Johnston Forbes-Robertson took over from Irving and laid the groundwork for a more natural portrayal of Shakespeare that remains popular today. Forbes-Robertson avoided the showiness of Irving and instead portrayed a down-to-earth Romeo, expressing the poetic dialogue as realistic prose and avoiding melodramatic flourish."]}, {"page": "1937", "response": ["* November 6 \u2013 Sir Johnston Forbes-Robertson, British stage actor (b. 1853)"]}, {"page": "1853", "response": ["**Johnston Forbes-Robertson, English actor (d. 1937)"]}, {"page": "The Winter's Tale", "response": ["One of the best remembered modern productions was staged by Peter Brook in London in 1951 and starred John Gielgud as Leontes.
