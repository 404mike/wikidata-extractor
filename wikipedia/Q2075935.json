This also served as the location for frequent jam sessions with various invited musicians. The address became the title of one of his compositions \u2013 \"317 East 32nd Street\". At around the same time, Tristano started a record label named Jazz Records. It released \"Ju-ju\" and \"Pastime\" on a 45 record in 1952, before Tristano abandoned the project because of time demands and distribution problems. The two tracks were from a trio session with bassist Peter Ind and drummer Roy Haynes, and contained overdubbed second piano parts added later by Tristano. Ind described them as the first improvised, overdubbed recordings in jazz. Early reviewers largely failed to realize that overdubbing had been used.
