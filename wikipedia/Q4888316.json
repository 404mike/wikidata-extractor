Boyd briefly tried his luck on the Californian goldfields before being purportedly murdered on Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands. Many of his business ventures involved blackbirding, the practice of enslaving South Sea Islanders.Boyd was a man of \"an imposing personal appearance, fluent oratory, aristocratic connections, and a fair share of commercial acuteness\". Georgiana McCrae, with whom he had dinner when he first came to the Port Phillip District, looked at him with an artist's eye and said: \"He is Rubens over again. Tells me he went to a bal masque as Rubens with his broad-leafed hat\".", "link_mentions": {}}}
