Boyd briefly tried his luck on the Californian goldfields before being purportedly murdered on Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands. Many of his business ventures involved blackbirding, the practice of enslaving South Sea Islanders.Boyd was a man of \"an imposing personal appearance, fluent oratory, aristocratic connections, and a fair share of commercial acuteness\". Georgiana McCrae, with whom he had dinner when he first came to the Port Phillip District, looked at him with an artist's eye and said: \"He is Rubens over again. Tells me he went to a bal masque as Rubens with his broad-leafed hat\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ben Boyd National Park", "response": ["The park was established in 1971 covering 8,900 hectares (35 sq. mi.) and was named after Benjamin Boyd.  It has since been expanded to cover 10,486 hectares (40 sq. mi.).Wright, p. 223. Boyd was a wealthy pastoralist and businessman in the 1840s, with interests in shipping (including whaling), based on the South Coast of NSW.  At the time, the area was part of the District of Port Phillip and Boyd was elected to the NSW Legislative Council for the electoral district of Port Phillip.  He was the first in Australia to engage in blackbirding, a practice akin to slavery, when a ship he had commissioned brought 65 Melanesian labourers to Boyd Town in 1847. In the wake of the George Floyd protests around the world and in Australia and the Black Lives Matter movement gaining pace in May\u2013June 2020, calls for the National Park to be renamed were renewed. Matt Kean, the NSW Environment Minister, commented that \"national parks are about connecting people, not dividing them\", and promised to seek a briefing about renaming the park and then to consult with local elders and the community."]}, {"page": "Solomon Islands", "response": ["Some of the earliest regular foreign visitors to the islands were whaling vessels from Britain, the United States and Australia.Robert Langdon (ed.)

A knock-on effect of the greater European contact was the spread of diseases to which local peoples had no immunity, as well a shift in the balance of power between coastal groups, who had access to European weapons and technology, and inland groups who did not. In the second half of the 1800s more traders arrived seeking turtleshells, sea cucumbers, copra and sandalwood, occasionally establishing semi-permanent trading stations.
