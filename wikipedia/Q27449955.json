The story of John and Anne Darwin was dramatised in the BBC Four programme Canoe Man in 2010. The film starred Bernard Hill and Saskia Reeves as John and Anne Darwin, respectively. Musician Martin Gordon documented the story with the song \"Panama\" from his 2009 release Time Gentlemen Please. In fiction, it inspired a 2009 novel by Adrian Gere called Return from the Dead, and a 2010 storyline in the ITV soap opera Coronation Street saw the character Joe McIntyre attempt the same thing. In 2015, it was mentioned in the BBC soap opera EastEnders when it was revealed that the character Kathy Beale and her husband faked their deaths in South Africa for insurance payouts. The song \"Simian Son\" by Jez Lowe concerning incidents in Hartlepool references the incident. The 2018 novel Let Me Lie by Clare Mackintosh, in which a husband and wife apparently commit suicide, was inspired by John Darwin.
