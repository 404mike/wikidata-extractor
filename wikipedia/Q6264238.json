Norie took over the Naval Warehouse after Heather's retirement and founded the company J.W. Norie and Company in 1813. After Norie's death the company became Norie and Wilson, then in 1903 Imray, Laurie, Norie & Wilson.\nCharles Dickens later used the Naval Warehouse in Dombey and Son.\nJack London mentions Norie's Epitome in Chapter 5 of his novel Martin Eden, and C. S. Forester refers to it in chapters 1 and 8 of Mr. Midshipman Hornblower and in Chapter 17 of The Commodore, both of the Horatio Hornblower series of novels.\nHe died at 3 Coates Crescent in Edinburgh's fashionable West End, Leaving his house to William H.

In mid-1807 Meleager accompanied HMS Shannon above 80 degrees latitude in a mission to protect the Greenland whaling fleet. They found neither whalers nor threats and so on 23 August they were back in Leith Roads, seeking replenishment, having spent three months above the Arctic Circle.

Norie (who died in 1843) had published a similar book in 1842; this flag may have been copied from that work. Neither book reveals any further information about this flag, and such a flag is not mentioned in the Army Institute of Heraldry's detailed page on presidential flags nor other books on the flag's history. The design is simply a version of the national coat of arms (i.e. the obverse of the Great Seal), which was a common motif for flags representing heads of state and also the same basic concept used in the later presidential flag of the Navy. Both depictions also use an arc of clouds for the crest, a style which was later (and still is) used on the presidential seal. The 1848 book shows a 26-star U.S. flag, which was in use from 1837 to 1845 (the depicted presidential flag also has 26 stars)."]}, {"page": "First Russian Antarctic Expedition", "response": ["On December 20, the travelers observed an iceberg for the first time.
