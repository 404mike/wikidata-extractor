Moreover, Watson was an exceptionally accurate bowler and his short stature and consequent low trajectory meant he was impossible for contemporary batsmen to jump out to and hit. He played for the first time in 1871 but did not bowl; however in the following season he became a regular member of a county team that played only four matches but won them all using merely three bowlers: Watson, Arthur Appleby and William McIntyre!Bowling for Lancashire in 1872"]}, {"page": "Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1871", "response": ["The initial first-class match was  at Old Trafford Cricket Ground on 26 and 27 May 1871.
