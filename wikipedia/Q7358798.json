He was educated at Bedales School, of which his father was co-founder. He served as a signals officer in the Royal Flying Corps in World War I and then became a poultry farmer. In 1930 he began training as a bookbinder at the Central School of Arts and Crafts in London. After he completed the course he opened his own bindery, then became a partner with Sandy Cockerell in the major bindery of Cockerell & Son in Letchworth, Hertfordshire. He also taught part-time at the Central School until 1943, when he moved to the Royal College of Art, where he taught until his retirement in 1956. There he was succeeded by his best pupil Peter Waters.\nPowell left Cockerell & Son in 1947 and again set up his own bindery in Froxfield, Hampshire. Here he did some of his most notable work, including the rebinding of the Book of Kells and Book of Durrow in 1953, the Lichfield Gospels in 1962, and work on many other important historical manuscripts. He studied, but did not alter, the oldest European leather binding to survive, that of the Stonyhurst or St Cuthbert Gospel, and his two chapters on the binding in books edited by Battiscombe (1956) and Brown (1969) remain the most important literature on the subject.  He and Peter Waters became partners in the Froxfield firm, working together until Waters emigrated to the United States in 1971. Aided by the design talents of Peter's wife, calligrapher Sheila Waters, this partnership produced some of the most masterful and acclaimed collector designer bindings of the mid-20th century. They worked on the conservation of the many books and manuscripts damaged in the Florence flood of 1966. Powell was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1976.Fellow binder and collector Bernard Middleton described Powell as \"one of the most important and influential bookbinders of the last hundred years and, arguably, of any period\". In his monograph on the Book of Durrow, Bernard Meehan, Keeper of Manuscripts at Trinity College Dublin, described Powell as \"the leading bookbinder of his day\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Book of Kells", "response": ["Over the centuries, the book has been rebound several times. During a 19th-century rebinding, the pages were badly cropped, with small parts of some illustrations being lost. The book was also rebound in 1895, but that rebinding broke down quickly. By the late 1920s, several folios had detached completely and were kept separate from the main volume. In 1953, bookbinder Roger Powell rebound the manuscript in four volumes and stretched several pages that had developed bulges.Hoops, Johannes (ed.) \"Reallexikon der Germanischen Altertumskunde\".

The front cover includes all three colours, but the pale yellow is not used on the back cover.  The pigments have been analysed for the first time, as one benefit of the purchase of the manuscript by the British Library, and identified by Raman spectroscopy as orpiment (yellow) and indigo (grey-blue).BL online page, \"The lines of the left board are filled in yellow (orpiment) and grey-blue (indigo)\". This is covered in the 2015 book  The balance of the designs on both covers is now affected by what appears to be the greater fading of the dark blue-grey pigment.Brown (1969), 14\u201321  The bookbinder Roger Powell speculated that the \"pale lemon-yellow\u00a0... may once have been green\", giving an original colour scheme of blue, green and yellow on the red background,Battiscombe, 370 although the recent testing suggests this was not the case.", "From 1950 onwards the binding was examined several times, but not altered, at Stonyhurst and the British Museum by Roger Powell, \"the leading bookbinder of his day\", who had rebound both the Book of Kells and the Book of Durrow,Meehan, 74\u201376, 74 quoted and also fully photographed by Peter Walters.Battiscombe, 362\u2013363  Powell contributed chapters on the binding to the two major works covering the book, the first being The Relics of St Cuthbert in 1956, a large work with chapters on Cuthbert's coffin and each of the objects recovered from it.  The main chapter on the St Cuthbert Gospel was by Sir Roger Mynors, and Powell's chapter incorporated unpublished observations by the leading bindings expert Geoffrey Hobson.All referenced here as Battiscombe  The second came in 1969, when T.J. (Julian) Brown, Professor of Palaeography at King's College, London, published a monograph on the St Cuthbert Gospel with another chapter by Powell, who had altered his views in minor respects.  Brown set out arguments for the dating of the manuscript to close to 698, which has been generally accepted.  The book was placed on loan to the British Library in 1979 where it was very regularly on display, first in the British Museum building, and from 1999 in the Ritblat Gallery at the new St Pancras site of the Library, usually displaying the front cover.  Despite minor damages, some of which appear to have occurred during the 20th century, the book is in extremely good condition for its age.Battiscombe, 362\u2013368; Brown (1969), 45\u201355, 59"]}, {"page": "Lichfield Gospels", "response": ["The manuscript was rebound in 1962 by Roger Powell; it was then discovered that the pages had been trimmed during the rebinding of 1707, and the manuscript had been cut into single leaves in the rebinding of 1862.

At the RCA, Waters also met his future wife, Sheila, who was soon to become one of the foremost calligraphers and map designers in the world. In 1957, Waters and Powell formed a professional partnership in book binding and conservation at the bindery in Hampshire. They produced many designer bindings for museums and collectors, often aided by Sheila, who made many drawings and designs for stamping engravings. Powell and Waters were called upon to restore many rare books, including The Book of Durrow, the Books of Dimma and Armagh, and the Lichfield Gospels. Waters eventually took over Powell's position at the Royal College of Art and remained there until he and his family moved to the United States in 1971.
