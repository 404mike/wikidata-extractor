He regained fitness, but not his place, George Hurst being preferred initially, and then newcomer Mike Westgarth. Vine returned in place of the injured Westgarth to score the only goal after two minutes of the visit to Southport on 11 April, but it was Westgarth who completed the season."]}, {"page": "Thomas Duff (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Tommy Duff (1905\u20131951), English footballer"]}]}}
