Trained by vocal teacher Clara Novello Davies, Dyer was famed for singing to audiences after he had fought in a contest and was nicknamed 'The Singing Boxer'.\nIn 1913 Dyer was briefly Wales welterweight champion when he beat Jack Delaney, who won the belt back just six weeks later. During his professional career Dyer took two overseas tours, to Australia from 1914 to 1915 and the United States from 1916 to 1919. Due to the time spent in Australia, he became eligible to contest for national titles, unsuccessfully challenging Les Darcy for the welterweight belt in 1915. The highpoint of his time in America, then during the 'no decision' era, was a win over Panama Joe Gans. Due to a knee injury, Dyer was refused active service during the First World War; instead he was recruited into the United States Army as a boxing instructor.\nAfter retiring from fighting Dyer ran various boxing gyms in London, successfully managing British flyweight champion Bert Kirby. Dyer then became a physical culture coach and was at the forefront of a diet fad in the 1920s based on fruit and vegetable drinks. Little is known of his life after the Second World War and he faded into anonymity.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Les Darcy", "response": ["|align=left| Fred Dyer", "|align=left| Fred Dyer"]}, {"page": "Sammy Mandell", "response": ["Mandell developed his fighting skills at the Camp Grant barracks in Rockford, Illinois.

The camp boxing instructor at the time was Fred Dyer, \"The Singing Boxer,\" who recalled in a 1926 interview how Mandell beat every soldier in the bantamweight class and was able to best men 10\u00a0lbs heavier than him.

BoxRec have his first professional fight against Boxer Ryan on 18 October 1909, fought at Campbell Bannerman Hall in Newport. The six round fight only lasted until the third when Basham took the match via a knockout. He followed this win with a series of regular contests throughout 1910, mainly taking place in Newport or the surrounding areas of Wales. These were against fighters with limited experience, and his results were patchy, having won three, lost three and drawn one by June 1910, including losing to Fred Dyer, the Singing Boxer on Dyer's debut. Only one match is recorded for the second half of 1910, his first fight outside Wales, when he beat Jim Ashen in the first round at the Frank Gess' Pavilion in Gloucester. Basham began 1911 with a draw with Young Walters in Pontnewydd on 6 February. No other bouts are recorded until August, but Basham then undertook a heavy schedule of fights, taking in nine matches in the second half of the year. Basham only lost one of the fights, of which three were fought in Wrexham in north Wales, and two in Liverpool."]}, {"page": "Lost Patrol (1929 film)", "response": ["* Fred Dyer as Abelson"]}, {"page": "List of Welsh boxing champions", "response": ["|align=left | Fred Dyer"]}, {"page": "Bert Kirby", "response": ["In the late 1920s he moved to trainer Fred Dyer and boxed out of Dyer's gym in the Strand, London."]}]}}
