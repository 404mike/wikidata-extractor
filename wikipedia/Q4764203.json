A knee injury kept him out of the team for most of the 1948-49 season and so he missed out on a place in Wolves' 1949 FA Cup winning side.\nMcLean left Wolves in May 1951 to become player-manager at Aberystwyth Town, subsequently joining Bromsgrove Rovers as a player. In May 1953, McLean joined Bury as player-coach, moving to Crewe Alexandra as a player the following June.\nAfter leaving Crewe he coached a number of non-league sides before taking over from Brian Clough as manager of Hartlepools United in May 1967. The following season, he led Hartlepool to their first ever promotion, but they were relegated after just one season. Despite relegation, McLean remained in charge, but was sacked in April 1970 when Hartlepool finished in the bottom four and were forced to seek re-election to the Football League.\nMcLean managed Bromsgrove Rovers between 1973 and 1975, after which time he worked as a scout until his death in 1979.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Angus McLean", "response": ["Angus McLean may refer to:", "*Angus McLean (footballer) (1925\u20131979), Welsh football player and manager"]}, {"page": "Deeside", "response": ["*Angus McLean, former manager of Hartlepool United F.C.."]}, {"page": "List of Hartlepool United F.C. managers", "response": ["Hartlepool United Football Club is an English association football club based in Hartlepool, North East England and currently play in the National League, the fifth tier of the English football league system.
