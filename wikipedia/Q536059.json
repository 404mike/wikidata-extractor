One of the most important ones is the comic baritone's lightly orchestrated, rapid-fire patter song, which would become one of the most distinguishing and popular features of Gilbert and Sullivan operas.  Following Italian opera precedents, such as \"Largo al factotum\" from The Barber of Seville, these numbers juxtapose virtuosity in their speed of delivery (requiring clarity of elocution) with their often comic or satiric lyrics.  In \"My name is John Wellington Wells\", the title character of The Sorcerer introduces himself as a tradesman of an ironic kind: \"a dealer in magic and spells\".Benford, p. 30  Another typical Sullivanian musical technique is the contrapuntal combination of slow and rapid tunes in one song and a tenor aria set in  time.  Sullivan did this so frequently in the Savoy operas that comedian Anna Russell, in her comedy routine \"How to Write Your Own Gilbert and Sullivan Opera\",Recording and re-issue history available at: Shepherd, Marc (2002), \"How to Write Your Own Gilbert and Sullivan Opera (1953)\" , A Gilbert and Sullivan Discography, Retrieved on 12 June 2008. exclaimed, \"the tenor\u00a0...\u00a0according to tradition, must sing an aria in  time\".Anna Russell Sings!
