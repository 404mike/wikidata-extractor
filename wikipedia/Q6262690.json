This was arranged by a special squad of the CID, led by Inspector Gerald MacArthur.Under MacArthur's leadership, the Hertfordshire force was investigating the Richardsons because the Home Office could not trust the Metropolitan Police, many of whom were in the pay of the Richardsons and other London gangs. By 1966, the Metropolitan Police was allegedly so corrupt that the then Home Secretary, Roy Jenkins, was considering replacing up to 70% of the CID and other specialist branches with CID from Manchester, Kent, Devon & Cornwall and Birmingham. When Robert Mark became Police Commissioner in 1972, he succeeded Sir John Waldron. More than 400 CID officers and 300 uniformed police officers were \"retired\" early.

Here he attracted the attention of Chancellor of the Exchequer Roy Jenkins, and in February 1967 was appointed Assistant Commissioner \"D\" (Personnel and Training) of the Metropolitan Police, where his welcome was less than ecstatic from a force that did not like outsiders; at the end of his first week, he was encouraged by Commissioner Sir Joseph Simpson to apply for the post of Chief Constable of Lancashire. The following year he was briefly appointed Assistant Commissioner \"B\" (Traffic). However, in March 1968, Simpson died in office. Peter Brodie, Assistant Commissioner \"C\" (Crime), was widely tipped to succeed him, but Home Secretary James Callaghan saw the opportunity to impose government will on the force and offered the job to Mark.

The police service was being drastically reorganised, including a sharp reduction in the number of separate forces, following the Police Act 1964. There were also some special problems affecting the Metropolitan Police Service; a Times expos\u00e9 had alleged widespread corruption, and some of the allegations turned out to be well justified. Waddell worked with the Commissioners, first John Waldron and then Robert Mark, to clear up the mess.

Byers suggested that Scott was a common blackmailer who needed psychiatric help. Declaring that Byers was a \"pontificating old sod\", Scott fled the room. The enquiry then questioned police officers about letters which Scott had shown to the police in 1962, but were told that these were inconclusive.Chester et al., pp. 137\u201338 Thorpe persuaded the Home Secretary, Reginald Maudling, and the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, John Waldron, to inform Byers that there was no police interest in Thorpe's activities, and no evidence of wrongdoing on his part.Freeman and Penrose, pp. 176\u201377 As a result, the enquiry dismissed Scott's allegations."]}, {"page": "James Humphreys (pornographer)", "response": ["Drury responded to the claims by giving an interview to the News of the World claiming he and Humphreys were searching for Ronnie Biggs, one of the gang members involved in the 1963 Great Train Robbery.
