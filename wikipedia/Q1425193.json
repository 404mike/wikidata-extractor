Mann holds dual British and United States citizenships. He received a B.A. in modern history in 1963 and a D.Phil. in sociology in 1971 from the University of Oxford. \nMann has been a professor of Sociology at UCLA since 1987; he was lecturer in Sociology at the University of Essex after graduation. He then became reader in Sociology at the London School of Economics and Political Science, from 1977 to 1987. Mann was also a member of the Advisory Editors Council of the Social Evolution & History journal.\nIn 1984, Mann published The Autonomous Power of the State: its Origins, Mechanisms, and Results in the European Journal of Sociology. Mann's works include The Sources of Social Power (four volumes) and The Dark Side of Democracy, spanning the entire 20th century. He also published Incoherent Empire, in which he attacks the United States' 'War on Terror' as a clumsy experiment in neo-imperialism.\nThe last two volumes of The Sources of Social Power, Global Empires and Revolution 1890-1945 and Globalizations 1945-2011, were published by CUP in 2012 and 2013 respectively. Mann's work has been subject of several books, including J.A. Hall and R. Schroder (eds). The Anatomy of Power: Social Theory of Michael Mann, (Cambridge UP, 2006) and R. Schroder (ed.) Global Powers: Michael Mann's Anatomy of 20th century and Beyond, (Cambridge UP, 2016).\nMann was elected as a Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy in 2015.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Democide", "response": ["Researchers often give widely different estimates of mass killings or mass murders.

According to Michael Mann (sociologist), in The Dark Side of Democracy (2004), murderous ethnic cleansing is strongly related to the creation of democracies. He argues that murderous ethnic cleansing is due to the rise of nationalism, which associates citizenship with a specific ethnic group. Democracy, therefore, is tied to ethnic and national forms of exclusion. Nevertheless, it is not democratic states that are more prone to commit ethnic cleansing, because minorities tend to have constitutional guarantees. Neither are stable authoritarian regimes (except the nazi and communist regimes) which are likely perpetrators of murderous ethnic cleansing, but those regimes that are in process of democratization. Ethnic hostility appears where ethnicity overshadows social classes as the primordial system of social stratification. Usually, in deeply divided societies, categories such as class and ethnicity are deeply intertwined, and when an ethnic group is seen as oppressor or exploitative of the other, serious ethnic conflict can develop. Michael Mann holds that when two ethnic groups claim sovereignty over the same territory and can feel threatened, their differences can lead to severe grievances and danger of ethnic cleansing. The perpetration of murderous ethnic cleansing tends to occur in unstable geopolitical environments and in contexts of war. As ethnic cleansing requires high levels of organisation and is usually directed by states or other authoritative powers, perpetrators are usually state powers or institutions with some coherence and capacity, not failed states as it is generally perceived. The perpetrator powers tend to get support by core constituencies that favour combinations of nationalism, statism and violence. , Mann, Michael (2005), The Dark Side of Democracy: Explaining Ethnic Cleansing.

Like Michael Mann and Valentino to a lesser extent, Midlarsky mainly addresses genocides that did not take place.
