He was Shadow Minister for Communities and Local Government from October 2010 to October 2013. He was previously a local councillor in Derby, representing the Normanton ward from 1991 until 2011, serving twice as leader of Derby City Council.\nIn February 2019, Williamson was notified of a formal investigation and later suspended from the Labour Party for his comments about the party's response to criticism over its handling of allegations of antisemitism within the party. After an investigation, Williamson was reinstated in June 2019 with a formal warning but was resuspended two days later when the party decided to review the disciplinary decision. In October 2019, Williamson won a High Court challenge to the legality of the review of the disciplinary decision  but similar charges had been made on 3 September 2019, involving a further suspension, and the High Court ruled the Labour Party's disciplinary procedure with regard to these charges should run its course. In November that year, Labour's National Executive Committee blocked Williamson from standing as a Labour candidate in the 2019 United Kingdom general election. He resigned from the Labour Party and stood as an Independent, losing the seat and his deposit.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "De Montfort University", "response": ["File:Official portrait of Chris Williamson crop 2.jpg|Chris Williamson, politician"]}, {"page": "Republicanism in the United Kingdom", "response": ["At the swearing of oaths in the Commons following the 2017 general election, Republic reported that several MPs had prefixed their parliamentary oath of allegiance with broadly republican sentiments, such as a statement referring to their constituents, rather than the Queen.

A series of high-profile cases involved Ken Livingstone, Peter Willsman and Chris Williamson, all of whom left the party or were suspended over the issue. In 2018, the Party was divided over adopting the IHRA Working Definition of Antisemitism, prompting 68 rabbis from the Jewish community to criticise the leadership for \"claiming to know what\u2019s good for our community\". The issue was cited by a number of MPs who left the party to set up Change UK. Later, Louise Ellman also left over the issue. During the 2019 general election, Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis made an unprecedented intervention in politics, stating that antisemitism, \"[a] new poison \u2013 sanctioned from the top \u2013 has taken root in the Labour Party\". His comments were supported by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby. Earlier in 2019, the independent equalities watchdog, the Equalities and Human Rights Commission launched an investigation into whether the Labour Party had \"unlawfully discriminated against, harassed or victimised people because they are Jewish\", following complaints by the Jewish Labour Movement and the Campaign Against Antisemitism. In 2020, the EHRC found the Labour Party \"responsible for three breaches of the Equality Act: political in interference in anti-Semitism complaints\", \"failure to provide adequate training to those handling anti-Semitism complaints\" and \"harassment, including the use of anti-Semitic tropes and suggesting that complaints of anti-Semitism were fake or smears\"."]}, {"page": "Resist (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Resist, The Resistance Movement, The Resist Festival, Resistance TV, a network of left-wing groups launched by politician Chris Williamson in the UK in 2019."]}, {"page": "List of Question Time episodes", "response": ["|Michael Forsyth, Chris Williamson, Fiona Hyslop, Maggie Chapman, Peter Oborne"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 2010 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["Notable newcomers elected in this general election included Liz Kendall, Guto Bebb, Gloria De Piero, Sajid Javid, Michael Dugher, Amber Rudd, Lisa Nandy, Damian Hinds, Anna Soubry, Heidi Alexander, Jacob Rees-Mogg, Alison McGovern, Chris Williamson, Owen Smith, Nicky Morgan, Tristram Hunt, Dan Poulter, Esther McVey, Priti Patel, Luciana Berger, Karen Bradley, Chuka Umunna, Louise Mensch, Dominic Raab, Tracey Crouch, Valerie Vaz and Caroline Lucas.", "| Derby North||style=\"background-color: \"| ||Labour||style=\"background-color: \"| ||Chris Williamson\u00a0(L)||Seat held.
