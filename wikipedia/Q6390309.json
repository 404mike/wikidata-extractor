After retiring from those chairmanships in 1980 he was chairman of STC and of Beecham.\n\n\"We (Rolls-Royce) added a zero to his stature; he used to think \u00a35 million a lot of money, but after a few weeks on the RB211 he came to understand that \u00a350 million is peanuts.\" \u2013 Stanley Hooker.", "link_mentions": {}}}
