The track \"Barefoot and Tiptoe\" was one of their collaborations and featured her voice, as well as the Band of the Irish Guards. It was released as by The Sweetshop but sales were poor. Wirtz was forced to shelve the project and concentrated on Tomorrow, whose album was released in February 1968.
