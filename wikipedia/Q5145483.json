In early November of the same year, Warwickshire's Chief Executive Colin Povey announced that the ground would be up and running for the 2015 season, with a new, smaller, pavilion, to replace that which was already at the site. It is possible that First-Class games will be played at the ground on occasion in the future, if Warwickshire's home Edgbaston is out of use, for an extended period, such as was the case for the 2013 Champions Trophy. It became the Edgbaston Foundation Sports Ground and is used by the Warwickshire CCC setup."]}]}}
