He was the inspiration for Mr Brocklehurst, the autocratic head of Lowood School, depicted by Charlotte Bront\u00eb in her 1847 novel Jane Eyre.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jane Eyre", "response": ["The early sequences, in which Jane is sent to Lowood, a harsh boarding school, are derived from the author's own experiences. Helen Burns's death from tuberculosis (referred to as consumption) recalls the deaths of Charlotte Bront\u00eb's sisters, Elizabeth and Maria, who died of the disease in childhood as a result of the conditions at their school, the Clergy Daughters School at Cowan Bridge, near Tunstall, Lancashire. Mr. Brocklehurst is based on Rev. William Carus Wilson (1791\u20131859), the Evangelical minister who ran the school. Additionally, John Reed's decline into alcoholism and dissolution recalls the life of Charlotte's brother Branwell, who became an opium and alcohol addict in the years preceding his death. Finally, like Jane, Charlotte became a governess. These facts were revealed to the public in The Life of Charlotte Bront\u00eb (1857) by Charlotte's friend and fellow novelist Elizabeth Gaskell.Stevie Davies, Introduction and Notes to Jane Eyre.
