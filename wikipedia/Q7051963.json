Wijsmuller went to Vienna but was arrested for criticizing the Nazi Winterhilfe-collection, but managed to talk her way out and the next day headed straight to the then office of Adolf Eichmann, the then relatively unknown head of the Central for Jewish Emigration Zentralstelle f\u00fcr j\u00fcdische Auswanderung. At first, he refused to see her, but then let her in for five minutes and disapprovingly told her she could take 600 Jewish children if she managed to get them out within one week. She managed. She then kept on organising transport of children from Germany and Austria. This lasted until the outbreak of WW-II on Sept. 1st, 1939, when European borders were closed. The exact number of Austrian children that could flee through Wijsmuller's organisation is not exactly known but according to her biographer runs up to 10,000. The last transport - now known under the name Kindertransport was on the 14th of May, 1940, three days after The Netherlands was invaded by the Nazis, on the last ship leaving Dutch waters, the SS Bodegraven, on which she managed to place 74 German and Austrian Jewish children. She decided to remain in Holland herself, although she had had the chance of joining the group of children. All of the children she rescued, survived the war circumstances. Wijsmuller was awarded the title 'Righteous Among the Peoples' by Yad Vashem.

A Lifetime in Jerusalem: The Memoirs of the Second Viscount Samuel, Transaction Publishers, 1970 p. 79 For Sir Ronald Storrs, Hyamson was one those Jews (like Norman Bentwich) whose work for the Administration of Palestine put him in an impossible position where he was criticised by both Arabs and Jews.

In an article published in The Contemporary Review in 1945 he set forth his reasons for supporting bi-nationalism (as the best compromise between either Zionist or Arab dominance of Palestine), which he reiterated in a letter to The Jewish Chronicle in 1946.

Magnes and the Promotion of Bi-Nationalism in Palestine\", Jewish Journal of Sociology. Vol. 48, no1-2 p.63", "Prior to the publication of Palestine: A Policy, Hyamson was apparently worried by the Zionist reaction within the Jewish community and wrote to his friend Sir Ronald Storrs that he believed he would be 'in for a bout of persecution' on account of the book.
