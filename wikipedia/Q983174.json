He previously served as Cabinet Secretary for Justice from 2007 to 2014 and was a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) from 1999 to 2016. A former member of the Scottish National Party (SNP), he defected to the Alba Party in 2021.\nBorn in Edinburgh and educated at Linlithgow Academy, MacAskill studied law at the University of Edinburgh and was a senior partner in a law firm in Glasgow. He was a long-standing member of the SNP's National Executive Committee and served as treasurer and vice convener of policy, before being elected at the 1999 Scottish Parliament election. He was convener of the Scottish Parliament Subordinate Legislation Committee from 1999 to 2001.\nFollowing the SNP's victory in 2007, MacAskill was appointed as Cabinet Secretary for Justice in the Scottish Government. In this role, he oversaw the controversial transfer of convicted terrorist Abdelbaset al-Megrahi to his native Libya. MacAskill left office in November 2014 in the Cabinet reshuffle which followed the appointment of Nicola Sturgeon as First Minister of Scotland and stood down from the Scottish Parliament at the 2016 election.\nAfter standing down from the Scottish Parliament, MacAskill was elected to the House of Commons as MP for East Lothian at the 2019 general election, gaining the previously Labour-held seat from Martin Whitfield. In March 2021, MacAskill defected from the SNP to the Alba Party.

She presented a documentary about Salmond's trial on sexual assault charges, for which he was acquitted. The documentary aired several months after the end of the trial and featured both supporters and detractors of Alex Salmond reflecting on the case. Some of the women who accused Salmond spoke about the case for the first time. The programme received over 900 complaints from those who believed it was biased against Salmond. The BBC said that the outcome of the trial was \"fairly reflected in the programme\", with the programme aiming to look at the wider political consequences of the case rather than rerunning Salmond's trial. The BBC also said that Salmond had been asked to take part in the programme but had refused. The BBC said the programme contained Jim Sillars and Kenny MacAskill, who were supporters of Salmond. A later news story said that Salmond was considering taking legal action against the BBC, and possibly against Wark."]}, {"page": "Nicola Sturgeon", "response": ["On 22 June 2004, John Swinney resigned as Leader of the SNP following poor results in the European Parliament election.
