In 1750, he received an MA from Cambridge, and married Elizabeth Wade at St Mary and St Michael Church, Trumpington, Cambridgeshire. He was sent by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, or Venerable Society, to assist at St Paul's Church, Halifax, Nova Scotia under the auspices of the Bishop of London, while the rector William Tutty returned to London on private business, during which trip Tutty died in 1754. Breynton immediately took over as missionary and minister, or Rector, at St Paul's in 1754.\nEarlier, in 1753, he had founded the first free school in Nova Scotia. In 1760, he consecrated St George's 'Little Dutch' (Deutsch) Church - the second oldest church in Halifax, becoming fluent in German as a result. In 1770, he was awarded an honorary degree of Doctor of Divinity by the University of Oxford. He returned to London during 1771\u20131772 to collect his degree, but returned to resume his post in Halifax. By 30 October 1776, he was Chaplain to the Royal Fencible American Regiment.

With his second wife, he appears to have returned to London shortly after 1785, continuing to draw his Halifax salary of \u00a3190 pa until he resigned and was replaced in 1791. In June 1792, he was lodging at Mary Riley's, 63 Edgware Road, London, when he was burgled.

Mathieu da Costa, first known Black person in Canada, was interpreter for French in Acadia in early 1600s. Slaveholding dates back to the Acadian period and 266 enslaved Africans were among the inhabitants of Louisbourg. Planters, arriving mostly from the New England area, brought about 200 enslaved Africans to Nova Scotia. One African woman and girl are listed in Newport 1767 census, possibly brought by William and Susanna Haliburton who emigrated from Boston in 1761. Numerous African-Nova Scotians have lived in communities along the Avon River both as enslaved and free people. In 1776 Peter Shey who had formerly lived at Mount Shey in Scotch Village purchased an enslaved 25 year old woman named Dinah from a Rev. John Breynton of Halifax.Duncanson, John V. (1985). Newport Nova Scotia; A Rhode Island Township. Mika (Mika Publishing Co., Belleville, Ont.), The shipbuilding and related trade in the Avon River and Scotch Village areas was connected to the slave-based economy of North America and the Caribbean. Nova Scotia vessels brought dried fish and timber to Caribbean slave-based plantations and traded these for sugar, rum, and molasses, which ultimately were used to purchase more slaves in the trans-Atlantic slave-trade. This is a part of Nova Scotia's history that is seldom shared yet warrants greater awareness, especially as we strive to learn about and overcome today's legacy of slavery and the slave trade. In the 1780s, White Loyalists brought 1,500 enslaved Africans to Nova Scotia, including to Newport, Falmouth, Summerville, Windsor, Rawdon, and Douglas  (Kennetcook and Stanley) to work on farms, orchards, in construction, in domestic servitude, etc. African people who were enslaved tended horses at the stage coach inn at Newport Corner in the 1800s.Harvey Amani Whitfield (2016). North to Bondage; Loyalist Slavery in the Maritimes. UBC Press. Up to 3,000 free Black Loyalists arrived in the province in 1780s during the American Revolution, followed by about 600 Maroons from Jamaica. Many African-Nova Scotians later left the province for New England and elsewhere, including 1,150 to Sierra Leone due to harsh treatment. After the War of 1812 between Great Britain and the United States, about 2,811 Black Refugees arrived in the province and settled in many communities around Halifax as well as in the Windsor Plains area, where they worked in many trades, farmed, quarried gypsum, and established a school and a church, which after 205 years, still serves the community.Harvey Amani Whitfield (2005).

Before slavery was abolished throughout the British Empire in 1834, African-Nova Scotians contributed skills, knowledge, and labour under dreadful conditions that enriched \u201cowners\u201d and communities. Many tried to escape, some were sold to the West Indies and elsewhere, families were divided through sale, and some were indentured or maimed or slain. Despite centuries of discrimination and hardship, people of African descent from Hants County have contributed immensely to the economy and culture of Nova Scotia. In 1859 William Hall of Horton Bluff on the Avon River was the first Black and the first Canadian sailor to receive the Victoria Cross. Charles Spurgeon Fletcher, a Windsor native and a uranium expert became Harvard University's first black professor around 1935.
