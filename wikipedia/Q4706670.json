Lottery procedures in Australia were changed after the Thorne case, with winners being given the option of remaining anonymous. The case also proved pivotal to the development of forensic science and new kidnapping laws in Australia. Kidnapping for ransom was seen as a primarily American phenomenon, most notably in the Lindbergh kidnapping. Prior to the Thorne case, such events were unknown in Australia. The late crime journalist Alan Dower was of the opinion that Thorne was not Bradley's initial target. Dower's theory was that his younger sister was Bradley's goal and that he had no intention of killing her. At 4, she was young enough that, if she had been kidnapped and then released, she would not have been able to give any useful information that could identify her kidnapper. However, she was also so young that she was never away from her parents."]}, {"page": "Penrith and Cockermouth (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Alan Dower", "*Conservative: Alan Dower"]}, {"page": "Alan Gandar-Dower", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alan Dower"]}, {"page": "Alan Vincent Gandar Dower", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alan Dower"]}, {"page": "Alan Vincent Gander Dower", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alan Dower"]}, {"page": "Alan Gander Dower", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alan Dower"]}, {"page": "Alan Gander-Dower", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alan Dower"]}, {"page": "Alan Gandar Dower", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alan Dower"]}, {"page": "Dower (surname)", "response": ["*Alan Dower (1898\u20131980), British Army officer and politician"]}]}}
