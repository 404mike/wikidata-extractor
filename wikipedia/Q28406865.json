Adjacent to Cory Lodge is a superb specimen of Catalpa speciosa, an Indian bean tree from North America, with white flowers followed by long slender fruits. On the north wall of the house is a specimen of Ginkgo biloba, the Chinese maidenhair tree, trained as an espalier since 1987."]}, {"page": "William T. Stearn", "response": ["Lindley was one of Stearn's inspirations, also being a librarian who had a long association with the RHS. Lindley also bequeathed his herbarium to the Cambridge University Herbarium, where it now forms the Lindley Collection. As Stearn remarked \"I came to know his numerous publications and to admire the industry, tenacity and ability with which he undertook successfully so many different things\". Later Stearn would publish a major work on Lindley's life and work. Lindley's contributions to horticultural taxonomy were matched only by those of Stearn himself. Stearn soon set about using his antiquarian knowledge to reorganise the library, forming a pre-Linnean section. Not long after his arrival the library acquired one of its largest collections, the Reginald Cory Bequest (1934), which Stearn set about cataloguing on its arrival two years later, resulting in at least fifteen publications."]}, {"page": "Dyffryn Gardens", "response": ["The final section of the gardens is the Garden Rooms, a series of terraced themed gardens. The \"rooms\" contain an Italian Terrace, Australasian and Mediterranean Gardens, each containing plants from their respective regions. Other areas include a physic garden, rose garden, reflecting pool and Pompeian gardens. The Pompeiian gardens, entered via an archway dated 1909, were originally inspired by Reginald Cory's trips to Italy."]}, {"page": "Humphrey Gilbert-Carter", "response": ["In 1921 Gilbert-Carter returned to Cambridge to take up his position as Director of the University Botanic Garden and Curator of the Herbarium at the Botany School where he taught at the age of 37. Within a year he had published his first book, Guide To The  Botanic Garden Cambridge (1922), followed by his Descriptive Labels for Botanic Gardens (1924). The gardens were much depleted, because of the war but his friendship with Reginald Cory, a fellow alumnus, resulted in considerable funding including the building of Cory Lodge as a residence for the Director."]}]}}
