The match was hosted at Nottingham Forest's home stadium, the City Ground, as Leicester's Filbert Street was undergoing redevelopment.  The game, described by Paul Weaver in The Guardian as \"dreadful\", was \"partially redeemed by a stunning goal\" from Julian Joachim, a second-half substitute for Leicester.  It was the only goal of the game which ended 1\u20130.  The second leg was played at Fratton Park three days later and was goalless at half time.  Six minutes into the second half, Portsmouth took the lead when Alan McLoughlin scored from a George Lawrence header.  Within two minutes Leicester had equalised when Ian Ormondroyd found the target following a deflected shot from David Oldfield.  Steve Thompson then put Leicester ahead in the 69th minute with a shot from the edge of the penalty area beating the Portsmouth goalkeeper Alan Knight.  Three minutes later, Bj\u00f8rn Kristensen levelled the score once more with an  curling shot into the far corner of the Leicester goal.  The game ended 2\u20132, and ensured Leicester a 3\u20132 aggregate victory."]}, {"page": "List of foreign Veikkausliiga players", "response": ["* George Lawrence \u2013 Mikkelin Palloilijat \u2013 1992"]}]}}
