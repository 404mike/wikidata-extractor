A new youth team, named Brentford Town Juniors, was launched in 1948 and won the Hounslow Minor Shield in its inaugural season. Products of the team included Alan Bassham, George Bristow, Roy Hart and George Lowden. The youth team reached the semi-finals of the FA Youth Cup in 1952\u201353, succumbing 8\u20131 on aggregate to the eventual winners Manchester United. Under the stewardship of Alf Bew and because of the financial constraints imposed on the first team, the youth team of the early 1950s was particularly productive, yielding Vernon Avis, Johnny Pearson, Gerry Cakebread, Dennis Heath, Jim Towers and George Francis. Following financial problems in 1967, the youth team was disbanded, but was revived again in 1972 with money raised by supporters. The youth team won a youth tournament in Frankfurt the following year, beating Frem in the final, with Richard Poole top-scoring. Along with Poole, Kevin Harding and Roy Cotton progressed to play league football with the first team, while Gary Huxley won England Youth international honours.

The \u00a310,000 sale of Jimmy Bloomfield was used to pay off debts and though manager Bill Dodgin Sr. had no budget with which to work, the youth team's increasing productivity under Alf Bew presented the club with a conveyor belt of homegrown talent. During the season, the graduation of forwards Jim Towers, George Francis, Dennis Heath and goalkeeper Gerry Cakebread, allied with the experience of former youths Wally Bragg and George Bristow, would become crucial to future promotion-pushes. After a mid-table finish in 1954\u201355, Jim Towers' 22 goals in the 1955\u201356 season fired Brentford to 6th-place and George Francis established himself as Towers' strike partner in 1956\u201357, scoring 24 goals to secure another top-half finish.

Towers' 37 during 1958\u201359 made him the Third Division's top-scorer (a total just two goals away from Jack Holliday's club record), plus the 'Twins' accounted for 51 of the Bees' 78 league goals scored during the season. Manager MacDonald was able to field a settled side in the late 1950s and early 1960s, at differing times being able to draw on goalkeeper Gerry Cakebread, full backs Ken Horne, Tom Wilson, half backs George Bristow, Ian Dargie, Ken Coote, Billy Goundry and supporting forwards Johnny Rainford, Dennis Heath, Len Newcombe, George McLeod and Eric Parsons."]}, {"page": "1954\u201355 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["|Dennis Heath", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Dennis Heath", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Dennis Heath"]}, {"page": "1955\u201356 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["After finishing the previous season strongly, Brentford went into the 1955\u201356 Third Division South season full of optimism.

Ken Horne, Billy Goundry, George Bristow, Dennis Heath and Eric Parsons, who had each made over 100 appearances for the club, were released, as were five other bit-part players. Most galling for the Brentford supporters was the sale of forwards Jim Towers and George Francis (who had accounted for 299 goals between them since 1954) to divisional and local rivals Queens Park Rangers for a combined \u00a38,000 fee. \u00a36,000 Cardiff City forward Brian Edgley was signed as a replacement and Ray Reeves and Jimmy Belcher were brought in to strengthen the back lines. The signings took the squad size to just 16 players, six of whom held a part-time status (Cakebread, Dargie, Gelson, Gitsham, Reeves and Ryecraft) and of those, two (Gelson and Ryecraft) were juniors who had yet to make their senior debuts. In addition, assistant trainer Jack Holliday (the club's record goalscorer) was sacked and trainer Fred Monk resigned in April 1962."]}]}}
