Among many other contributions he is best known for his work on stress and fracture in metals that is now known as metal fatigue, as well as being one of the first to develop a strong theoretical basis for the jet engine. Griffith's advanced axial-flow turbojet engine designs, were integral in the creation of Britain's first operational axial-flow turbojet engine, the Metropolitan-Vickers F.2 which first ran successfully in 1941. Griffith however had little direct involvement in actually producing the engine, after he moved in 1939 from leading the engine department at the Royal Aircraft Establishment to start work at Rolls Royce.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "June 13", "response": ["*1893 \u2013 Alan Arnold Griffith, English engineer (d. 1963)"]}, {"page": "Jet engine", "response": ["The first patent for using a gas turbine to power an aircraft was filed in 1921 by Maxime Guillaume.

Alan Arnold Griffith had proposed a number of different bypass engine designs as early as the 1930s while he and Hayne Constant were trying to get their axial-flow jet engines working at the Royal Aircraft Establishment. Frank Whittle's Power Jets also studied a number of bypass configurations. However, the need to get jet engines into service during the war meant that work had to be put aside in favour of the simpler turbojet designs with shorter introduction times. Priorities changed dramatically at the end of the war and, by 1946, Rolls-Royce agreed that existing engines like the Rolls-Royce Avon were advanced enough to enable a start to work on more advanced concepts like bypass."]}, {"page": "Armstrong Siddeley", "response": ["The company started work on their first gas turbine engine in 1939, following the design pioneered at the Royal Aircraft Establishment by Alan Arnold Griffith. Known as the \"ASX\" for \"Armstrong Siddeley eXperimental\", the original pure-turbojet design was later adapted to drive a propeller, resulting in the \"ASP\". From then on, AS turbine engines were named after snakes. The Mamba and Double Mamba were turboprop engines, the latter being a complex piece of engineering with two side-by-side Mambas driving through a common gearbox, and could be found on the Fairey Gannet. The Python turboprop powered the Westland Wyvern strike aircraft. Further development of the Mamba removed the reduction gearbox to give the Adder turbojet."]}, {"page": "Rolls-Royce Thrust Measuring Rig", "response": ["The man largely responsible for the development of the TMR was Dr Alan Arnold Griffith, who had worked on gas turbine design at the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE), in the 1920s and was a pioneer of jet lift technology. In 1939, Griffith had been employed by Rolls-Royce. During the 1940s, he conceived of using jet propulsion as a method of directly providing vertical lift to produce an aircraft that could take off vertically.

The paper started by demonstrating that existing axial compressor designs were \"flying stalled\" due to their use of flat blades, and dramatic improvements could be made by using aerofoil designs instead. It went on to outline a complete compressor and turbine design, using the extra exhaust power to drive a second turbine that would power a propeller.

The book collects Griffith's world travels, including one trip around the world done in a record-breaking 65 days. In addition, many of Griffith's other adventures are included. His trip to South America is recounted in \"A Railway Beyond the Clouds\", \"A Ride to the City of the Sun\", \"A Paradise of Tomorrow\", \"The Most Majestic Mountain\", and \"Los Medanos\". His travels of North America in \"The Snake-Dancers of Arizona\" are somehow even more exotic. Griffith claims to have made the first intentional flight across the English Channel in \"To France by Air\". In \"When will the 20th Century Begin?\", Griffith discusses the intricacies of time zones, something with which he had quite a lot of practice. The Apogee edition includes an introduction by Griffith's grandson, John Griffith, relating some of the family history, particularly of Alan Arnold Griffith, and a biography of George Griffith by editor Robert Godwin.
