Trap music, primarily known for its hip-hop roots, consists of Electro sounding instruments, vocal samples, and hip-hop drums.  Fascinated with the sound of trap music, Josh began work on STATIK LNK's new project concentrating primarily on the growing EDM trend of trap music. Using the hip-hop sound that he was well respected for during his hip-hop days, Josh would string together a hit of trap music remixes leading up to his debut release. While working on STATIK LNK's debut Trap EP, Josh released tracks that experienced major success. His first trap remix of Zomboy\u2019s \"Here To Stay\" was critically acclaimed. The remix resulted in a top Trap Remix title being awarded to STATIK LNK for May 2013 by DJCity.com, the most popular DJ Pool in the USA [4]. The remix of \"Here To Stay\" was followed up with the success of STATIK LNK's remix of Kaskade's single \"Atmosphere\" which went viral over the internet resulting in a top hit among Kaskade Trap Remixes across the Internet. Josh continued to work on STATIK LNK's debut Trap EP while touring the US.  While working on his debut EP, Josh stayed in contact with MING.  Upon completion of the EP, Josh submitted the work to Hood Famous Music, MING's label imprint. During this time, MING had been experiencing major success with his debut release on DIM MAK, King Kong The EP. MING had also begun production in trap music. His work resulted in two Top 10 Beatport charting singles (\"Rock\", by Paul Mendez at #2 and \"Colossal\" by Fortune Cookie at #5 on the Beatport Hip Hop charts). Impressed by one of the productions on the album Josh had submitted, MING partnered with STATIK LNK to produce the anthem \"Block Party\" ft Moxiie. The critically acclaimed single experienced much success resulting in a Top 100 post on iTunes and a top 10 post on Beatport.
