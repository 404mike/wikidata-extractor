During the Second World War he was deputy controller of the Projectile Development Establishment. After the war he became director of the Ministry of Supply's Rocket Propulsion Establishment at Westcott, Buckinghamshire. In 1947 he joined the Royal Naval Scientific Service, serving as its chief from 1950 to 1954, when he became deputy head of the Weapons Group of the newly created United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA). It was under his leadership that Britain developed the hydrogen bomb, and he was present as the scientific director of the Operation Grapple nuclear tests at Malden Island in May and June 1957, and the successful thermonuclear test at Christmas Island in November 1957. In 1958, he became the UKAEA's Member for Engineering and Production, and oversaw the expansion of the civil nuclear power industry.\nCook returned to the Ministry of Defence in 1960 as one of two deputies to the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Ministry of Defence. Cook served as the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Ministry of Defence from 1966 until 1970, when he retired from the civil service. He oversaw the development of weapons such as the Panavia Tornado, Rapier surface-to-air missile, SEPECAT Jaguar and FH70 howitzer. After Rolls Royce went bankrupt in 1970, he chaired a committee that determined that the Rolls-Royce RB211 engine should be continued. When Rolls Royce was nationalised in 1971, he was appointed one of the company's directors. He retired in 1976, but continued to assist the company for four more years. He was also a director of GEC Marconi Electronics from 1972 to 1979, and Marconi International Marine from 1971 to 1975, and a consultant to British Telecom from 1982 to 1985.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Operation Grapple", "response": ["The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority Atomic Weapons Research Establishment at Aldermaston in Berkshire was directed by William Penney, with William Cook as his deputy. The scientists at Aldermaston did not know how to build a hydrogen bomb, but produced three megaton-range designs: Orange Herald, a large nuclear fission weapon with an enriched uranium tamper; Green Bamboo, an interim thermonuclear design in which fusion occurred in layers of  lithium-6 deuteride that alternated with layers of uranium-235; and Green Granite, a true thermonuclear design in which the majority of the yield came from thermonuclear burning. The British bomb designers used the terms \"Tom\" and \"Dick\" for the bomb's primary and secondary stages respectively. The Tom would be a fission bomb. It would produce radiation to implode the Dick. Implicit in the creation of a hydrogen bomb was that it would be tested. Anthony Eden, who replaced Churchill as prime minister after the latter's retirement on 5 April 1955, gave a radio broadcast in which he declared: \"You cannot prove a bomb until it has exploded. Nobody can know whether it is effective or not until it has been tested.\""]}, {"page": "William Cook", "response": ["* William Cook (footballer) (born 1907), English footballer who played for Darlington and Gateshead", "* William Cook (billiards player), World Champion of English billiards in the 19th century", "* William Cook (Lancashire cricketer) (1881\u20131947), English cricketer", "* William Cook (Surrey cricketer) (1891\u20131969), English cricketer", "* William Cook (Leeds/Bradford MCCU cricketer) (born 1995), English cricketer", "* William Cook (MP), member of parliament for Lewes", "* William Cook (British industrialist) (1834\u20131908), British industrialist and politician", "* Sir William Cook, 2nd Baronet (1630\u20131708), member of parliament", "* Antony Tudor (William Cook, 1908\u20131987), English choreographer", "* William Cook (computer scientist) (1963\u20132021), American computer scientist", "* William Cook, nineteenth and early-twentieth century creator of the Orpington poultry breeds", "* William Cook (entrepreneur) (1931\u20132011), American medical equipment manufacturer", "* William Cook (pioneer) (18th century), founder of Russellville, Kentucky", "* William Cook (1908\u20131987), English choreographer, better known as Antony Tudor", "* William Cooke (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "1958 US\u2013UK Mutual Defence Agreement", "response": ["The AEC invited the British government to send representatives to a series of meetings in Washington, DC, on 27 and 28 August 1958 to work out the details. The US delegation included Willard Libby, AEC deputy chairman; Loper; Brigadier General Alfred Starbird, AEC Director of Military Applications; Norris Bradbury, director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory; Edward Teller, director of the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory; and James W. McRae, president of the Sandia Corporation. The British representatives were Sir Frederick Brundrett, the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Ministry of Defence, and Victor Macklen from the Ministry of Defence; and William Penney, William Cook and E. F. Newly from the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment at Aldermaston. The Americans disclosed the details of nine of their nuclear weapon designs: the Mark 7, Mark 15/39, Mark 19, Mark 25, Mark 27, Mark 28, Mark 31, Mark 33 and Mark 34. In return, the British provided the details of seven of theirs, including Green Grass; Pennant, the boosted device which had been detonated in the Grapple Z test on 22 August; Flagpole, the two-stage device scheduled for 2 September; Burgee, scheduled for 23 September; and the three-stage Halliard 3. The Americans were impressed with the British designs, particularly with Halliard 1, the heavier version of Halliard 3. Cook, therefore, changed the Grapple Z programme to fire Halliard 1 instead of Halliard 3. Macmillan noted in his diary with satisfaction:"]}, {"page": "Operation Mosaic", "response": ["These were not common at this time of the year; at the start of Operation Mosaic, it had been estimated that conditions favourable for G2 would occur only three days per month. In fact, since Narvik had arrived in March, not a single day had been suitable. And good weather conditions alone were insufficient; the meteorologists had to accurately forecast them. To allow Narvik to return to the UK and refit for Operation Grapple, the first test of a British hydrogen bomb, 15 July was set as the terminal date for Mosaic. As the deadline approached, William Cook, the scientist in charge of the hydrogen bomb project at Aldermaston, determined that in view of the results of G1, G2 was now more important than ever. He agreed that, if necessary, Grapple, could be delayed to conduct G2. With time running short, the test procedures were altered to allow for a break in the weather to be exploited, with an earlier firing time and a shorter countdown."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society A, B, C", "response": ["| Edward William Cooke||04/06/1863||27 March 1811 \u2013 4 January 1880", "| George William Cooke||20/03/1969||6 January 1916 \u2013 10 February 1992"]}, {"page": "1970 Birthday Honours", "response": ["* T1401426 Flight Sergeant Sidney William Cookson."]}, {"page": "British hydrogen bomb programme", "response": ["The scientists at the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority's Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston in Berkshire included William Penney, William Cook, Ken Allen, Samuel Curran,  Henry Hulme, Bryan Taylor and John Ward.

The first series of Operation Grapple tests involved Britain's first airdrop of a thermonuclear bomb. Although hailed as a success at the time, the first test of the Green Granite design was a failure. The second test validated Orange Herald as a usable design of a megaton weapon, but it was not a thermonuclear bomb, and the core boosting did not work. A third test attempted to correct the Green Granite design, but was another failure.", "Like Hinton, Penney had difficulty recruiting and retaining the highly skilled staff he needed. In particular, he wanted a deputy with a strong scientific background. An approach to Vivian Bowden failed. After Penney repeatedly asked for William Cook, Salisbury managed to persuade McGrigor to release Cook from the Admiralty to be Penney's deputy. Cook commenced work at Aldermaston on 1 September 1954. Henry Hulme joined in 1954. He was too senior to be placed in Corner's theoretical physics division, so he became an assistant to Penney, with special responsibility for the hydrogen bomb programme. Samuel Curran, who had worked on the Manhattan Project in Berkeley, became head of the radiation measurements division. The physicist John Ward was also recruited at this time."]}, {"page": "John Challens", "response": ["In 1939, he was transferred to the rocket department. During the Second World War, this moved from Woolwich to Fort Halstead, and then to Aberporth in 1940, where it became the Projectile Development Establishment, with Sir Alwyn Crow as Controller of Projectile Development and William Cook as his deputy. On 17 April 1945, he was commissioned into the British Army as a second lieutenant on the General List. After the defeat of Germany, he was sent to Germany, and then to the United States as part of the British Scientific Mission to work on the V-1 flying bomb and the V-2 rocket. For his services, he was awarded the U.S. Medal of Freedom."]}, {"page": "Frederick Brundrett", "response": ["When Sir Charles Wright retired in 1947, Brundrett succeeded him as the Chief of the Royal Naval Scientific Service. He chose William Cook as his Director of Physical Research. The year 1947 also saw the formation of the Defence Research Policy Committee (DRPC) to advise the Minister of Defence and the Chiefs of Staff on matters of scientific policy, of which Brundrett became an ex officio member. The DRPC was initially chaired by the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Ministry of Defence, Sir Henry Tizard. Brundrett became deputy chairman in 1950 and chairman in 1954 succeeding, Sir John Cockcroft as Chief Scientific Adviser. He was also Honorary Scientific Adviser to the Ministry of Civil Aviation from 1953 to 1959. Brundrett was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1950 New Year Honours and a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the 1956 New Year Honours.
