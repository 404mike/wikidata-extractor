Initially a glam rock-inspired band, Japan developed their sound and androgynous look to incorporate electronic music and foreign influences.", "The band, who were initially nameless, opted to call themselves Japan. The name was intended by Sylvian to be temporary until they could think of something else, but ultimately became permanent. The following year they were joined by another school friend Richard Barbieri on keyboards and later by lead guitarist Rob Dean, and signed a management deal with Simon Napier-Bell in 1976. After winning a label-sponsored talent contest the band signed a recording contract with the German disco label Hansa-Ariola in 1977, becoming an alternative glam rock outfit in the mould of Lou Reed, David Bowie, T.Rex, Roxy Music, and New York Dolls although their initial material was guitar-based funk.Ola's Kool Kitchen with interview of Robert Dean from Japan, from the Internet Archive", "With personality conflicts leading to rising tensions within the band, Tin Drum was to be the band's final studio album.

Rob Dean had already departed (in May 1981) after the release of the Gentlemen Take Polaroids album, as his electric guitar work became superfluous for the band's sound on Tin Drum.

Both albums saw polarized reviews and poor sales domestically in the UK, but were commercially successful overseas.
