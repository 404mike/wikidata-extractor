He suggested to the British government the removal of the obelisk known as Cleopatra's Needle, for long centuries embedded in the sand near Alexandria, Egypt. The undertaking was considered too costly and not taken up until 1877, and the obelisk now stands on the London Embankment to commemorate the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "West India Regiments", "response": ["*1805\u20131808: Gen.

The tower's lookout, extending above the height of the main building, would have afforded a commanding view of the activities of the customs men in the area, both out to sea and inland.  A tunnel running from an entrance just above the beach straight into the cellar of the tower would have made transferring contraband from the Isle of Wight a low risk operation. It is possible that the tunnel predate the tower.  Once the goods were on the mainland, the proximity of Southampton would have made distribution expeditious. In the early 19th century the tower was sold to Richard Lambart, 7th Earl of Cavan. The earl set up tents around the base of the tower and lived in it for a while. Finding the tower too small he later built  Eaglehurst House slightly further inland. Documentation in the tower suggests there may have been tunnels from the base of the tower into the cellars of Eaglehurst House; if so they are now blocked up."]}, {"page": "Governor of Calshot Castle", "response": ["*1813\u20131837: Richard Lambart, 7th Earl of Cavan"]}, {"page": "Seventh earl of Cavan", "response": ["#redirectRichard Lambart, 7th Earl of Cavan"]}]}}
