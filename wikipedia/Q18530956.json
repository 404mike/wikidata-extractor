F. Watts matched the Victorian sense of high purpose.  The classical ladies of Edward Poynter and Albert Moore wore more clothes and met with rather less success.  William Powell Frith painted highly detailed scenes of social life, typically including all classes of society, that include comic and moral elements and have an acknowledged debt to Hogarth, though tellingly different from his work.Wilson, 85; Bills, Mark, Frith and the Influence of Hogarth, in William Powell Frith: painting the Victorian age, by Mark Bills & Vivien Knight, Yale University Press, 2006, , "]}, {"page": "Leeds Arts University", "response": ["* Vivien Knight, art historian and gallerist "]}, {"page": "Guildhall Art Gallery", "response": ["Vivien Knight was head of the Gallery, from 1983 until her death in 2009."]}, {"page": "King Edward VI High School for Girls", "response": ["*Vivien Knight (1953-2009), art historian and gallerist "]}, {"page": "A Private View at the Royal Academy, 1881", "response": ["At the left of the painting stands the \"homely figure\" of Anthony Trollope (who died on 6 December 1882), with full white beard and top hat, noting in a book as he gazes at an \"aesthetic\" family in the foreground to the right, comprising a woman in green with sunflower buttonhole gazing at the artworks (a professional model, Jenny TripWilliam Powell Frith: painting the Victorian age; Mark Bills, Vivien Knight, Guildhall Art Gallery, Mercer Art Gallery; Yale University Press, 2006; , p.70), a woman in yellow reading her catalogue, and a girl in orange looking up at her.
