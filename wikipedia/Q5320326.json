Only one or two such bombs would suffice, he said, to completely wipe out the islands where Gaelic is spoken and everyone and everything in them. But D\u00f2mhnall urged his listeners to trust that Jesus Christ, who died on the Cross out of love for the human race, would never permit such a terrible destruction to fall on those whose sins he redeemed through his blood and the wounds in his hands and his side.Domhnall Ruadh Choruna, Edited by Fred Macauley (1995), pp. 154\u2013155.", "* In the 2008 album Dual, a collaboration between Irish and Scottish folk musicians \u00c9amonn Doorley, Muireann Nic Amhlaoibh, Ross Martin, and Julie Fowlis, Fowlis recorded An Eala Bh\u00e0n, an iconic Scottish Gaelic love song by World War I poet D\u00f2mhnall Ruadh Chor\u00f9na.
