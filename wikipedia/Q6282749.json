He was married to Evelina Danby, who is generally accepted to be the illegitimate daughter of J.M.W. Turner and his mistress Sarah Danby (1766\u20131861). Together, they had seven children: Son: name unknown (1819-c1819), Daughter: Evelina Sarah Margaritta Dupuis(1821-c1821?), Son: William Dupuis (1823-c1823?), Daughter: Rosalie Adelaide Dupuis (1825\u20131900), Son: Joseph Hutton Dupuis (1827\u20131903), Son: Hanmer Lewis Dupuis (1829\u20131911), Daughter: Evelina Louisa Dupuis (1832-after 1875). Joseph Dupuis was a man of the highest reputation among his peers. He devoted much of his life to freeing Christian slaves in North Africa, and was regarded as one of the leading experts of his time on Morocco and the Sahara.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Akan people", "response": ["File:Ashantee soldier2.jpg|Empire of Ashanti Soldier, , Visual Art \u2013 Joseph Dupuis."]}, {"page": "Ashanti Empire", "response": ["European contact with the Asante on the Gulf of Guinea coast region of Africa began in the 15th century. This led to trade in gold, ivory, slaves, and other goods with the Portuguese. On May 15, 1817, the Englishman Thomas Bowdich entered Kumasi. He remained there for several months, was impressed, and on his return to England wrote a book, Mission from Cape Coast Castle to Ashantee.  His praise of the kingdom was disbelieved as it contradicted prevailing prejudices. Joseph Dupuis, the first British consul in Kumasi, arrived on March 23, 1820. Both Bowdich and Dupuis secured a treaty with the Asantehene. But, the governor, Hope Smith, did not meet Ashanti expectations.Lloyd, pp. 28-38"]}, {"page": "William Willshire", "response": ["William Willshire was born in London in 1790 and spent his early life there.Riley; Evans, p. 288.

The Company of Merchants Trading to Africa (aka the African Company) published the first version based on interviews held with Adams at their London offices. This version was titled The Narrative of Robert Adams and included an introduction, notes, and other supporting material. Simon Cock was its primary editor and Joseph Dupuis added notes based on his encounter with Adams. The book was published by John Murray in 1816. The Narrative is reminiscent of Barbary slave narratives, which were written by other shipwrecked sailors who had been taken captive and enslaved in Northern Africa (he was not captured by Barbary corsairs, and he spent his captivity in the Sub-Saharan region south of the Barbary coast). The one notable difference in the Narrative of Robert Adams is that Adams describes his visit to the legendary city of Timbuktu, much coveted by Europeans in that time. Adams was the first Westerner to ever give a full account of the city of Timbuktu. As Frank T. Kryza writes, \"No European explorer had been there and returned since the Middle Ages.\""]}, {"page": "The Narrative of Robert Adams", "response": ["Robert Adams was an American of mixed black and white ancestry.
