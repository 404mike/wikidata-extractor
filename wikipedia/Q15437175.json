She grew up in South Wales, Australia and the English home counties before studying at Saint Martin's School of Art in London. After graduating in 1958, Hemmant worked as freelance illustrator for Hamish Hamilton, Heinemann and other publishers.Hemmant has illustrated several classic books, including the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayam, Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol, and Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, as well as the work of modern authors like Ruth Manning-Sanders, Dick King-Smith, and Dorothy Edwards. Hemmant has also created designs for postage stamps, including a series of Christmas stamps issued by the island of Guernsey, and produced a cover for Reader's Digest.\nHemmant has been commissioned as a portrait painter and her works have been exhibited in a one-woman show in Bellagio in Italy. Her later work has been exhibited in London and the Republic of Ireland.\nSince 1979, Hemmant has focused on drawing and painting. Constant observation of natural forms has inspired large imaginative paintings in which plant life and architecture predominate. A major source of images is her own garden, along with landscapes in Venice and other parts of Italy. Hemmant's work is not conceptual. The only agenda is the pursuit of beauty and harmony more in keeping with nineteenth and early twentieth century styles.\nShe lives in Camberwell in south London.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ruth Manning-Sanders", "response": ["Many of her children's fairy-tale titles were memorably illustrated by Robin Jacques, who expressed a preference \"for children's books of the more imaginative and fanciful kind, since these leave greater scope for illustrative invention, where I feel most at home.
