When he died, The Times said that he was \"the most famous umpire the game has known\". The Australian Test captain Joe Darling said, \"Thoms was about the only umpire in England who was not afraid of Grace or anyone else.\" The weekly magazine Cricket said:\n\nHe was universally regarded as the umpire of the period, imperturbable, accurate and prompt in his decisions, and a great authority on the laws of the game. Unlike most umpires who, when they have given a decision, decline to argue or discuss the matter, he had a habit of explaining just what had happened, and as he very seldom made a mistake, his comments were always heard with respect and often admiration.\nThoms had appeared as a player in three first-class matches in 1850 and 1851: one for an Under 36 XI, one for Marylebone Cricket Club and Metropolitan Clubs and one for the All England Eleven. He was a fine fieldsman and an excellent sprinter over 100 yards.\n\nThoms was born in Marylebone, London. His father was part-proprietor of a cricket ground in Middlesex. He attended a \"good school\", where he learnt Latin and Greek. He frequently wrote articles on cricket for the sporting press, \"always having something interesting to say in quaint language, which was charming and entirely his own\".He and his wife, the former Elizabeth Constance Farley, had four children, two of whom died in infancy. She died in 1898; he died in 1903 at Regent's Park, London. They are buried in a family grave on the eastern side of Highgate Cemetery.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Highgate Cemetery", "response": ["* Bob Thoms, the greatest Victorian cricket umpire"]}, {"page": "List of Test cricket umpires", "response": ["|Bob Thoms||||2||1880||1882"]}, {"page": "Luke Greenwood", "response": ["Greenwood turned to umpiring even before his playing career was finished.  He umpired forty six first-class matches between 1862 and 1886.  With Bob Thoms, he officiated in one Test match, at The Oval between England and Australia in August 1882.  It was after Australia won this match by seven runs that The Sporting Times wrote an obituary for English cricket, and bails were burned and put in an urn to create 'The Ashes'.  He was no stranger to the Australian side, umpiring thirty two first-class matches involving Australian teams on their tours of 1880, 1882, 1884 and 1886."]}, {"page": "Robert Arthur Thoms", "response": ["#REDIRECT Bob Thoms"]}, {"page": "List of English cricketers (1841\u20131850)", "response": ["|Bob Thoms"]}, {"page": "Thoms", "response": ["*Bob Thoms (1826\u20131903), English cricket umpire"]}]}}
