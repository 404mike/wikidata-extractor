His time at St James Park saw him win the Football League First Division in 1993. He also played in the Football League for Charlton Athletic, Derby County, Oldham Athletic and Wycombe Wanderers. He was capped 21 times by England, scoring twice and was a member of the World Cup 98 squad.\nFollowing retirement, he harboured interests of becoming a manager and in 2006 he was interviewed for the vacant AFC Bournemouth job, but ultimately has worked away from the sport with a stint as co-commentator for TEN Sports. He was inducted into the Newcastle United Hall of Fame in 2019.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Charlton Athletic F.C.", "response": ["Eventually, Charlton were relegated in 1990 along with Sheffield Wednesday and bottom club Millwall. Manager Lennie Lawrence remained in charge for one more season before he accepted an offer to take charge of Middlesbrough. He was replaced by joint player-managers Alan Curbishley and Steve Gritt. The pair had unexpected success in their first season finishing just outside the play-offs, and 1992\u201393 began promisingly and Charlton looked good bets for promotion in the new Division One (the new name of the old Second Division following the formation of the Premier League). However, the club was forced to sell players such as Rob Lee to help pay for a return to the Valley, while club fans formed the Valley Party, nominating candidates to stand in local elections in 1990, pressing the local council to enable the club's return to the Valley - finally achieved in December 1992.", "|1991|| Rob Lee"]}, {"page": "Newcastle United F.C.", "response": ["John Hall became the club's chairman in 1992, and replaced Ardiles with Keegan, who managed to save the team from relegation to the Third Division. Keegan was given more money for players, buying Rob Lee, Paul Bracewell and Barry Venison. The club won the First Division championship at the end of the 1992\u201393 season, earning promotion to the then new Premier League."]}, {"page": "Alan Shearer", "response": ["An almost injury-free season helped Shearer improve on his previous year's tally in the 1998\u201399 season, the striker converting 14\u00a0goals in 30 league games and replacing Rob Lee as Newcastle captain, but Newcastle finished 13th again, with Ruud Gullit having replaced Kenny Dalglish just after the season got underway. He also helped Newcastle to a second consecutive FA Cup final and qualification for the following season's UEFA Cup, scoring twice in the semi-final against Tottenham Hotspur, but they once again lost 2\u20130, this time to treble-chasing Manchester United."]}, {"page": "Surbiton", "response": ["* Rob Lee - former councillor"]}, {"page": "West Ham", "response": ["*Rob Lee, footballer"]}, {"page": "Plaistow, Newham", "response": ["England international footballers  Sol Campbell, Tony Cottee, Rob Lee and Martin Peters were born in Plaistow."]}, {"page": "Emerson Park", "response": ["Being not far from West Ham United's training ground at Chadwell Heath, the area has historically been popular with footballers.

The match was tied at 1\u20131, and Manchester United needed at least a draw to keep up with Arsenal in the race for the league title, with Solskj\u00e6r being introduced in the 79th minute. Near the end of the game, Newcastle's Rob Lee had a clear goalscoring opportunity, running unopposed towards United's goal, but Solskj\u00e6r had run across the entire field to commit a professional foul against him, thus denying Newcastle a winning goal. Solskj\u00e6r did this knowing he would be sent off, and suspended for the coming matches. Supporters regarded this as an example of how Solskj\u00e6r put the club above personal interest. The Norwegian only managed six league goals in 22 appearances (15 starts) during his second season at the club, and despite his sacrifice against Newcastle, Arsenal beat Manchester United to the league title by a single point."]}, {"page": "Kevin Keegan", "response": ["Prior to the 1992\u201393 season, Keegan strengthened the defence with the acquisition of Barry Venison from Liverpool and John Beresford from Portsmouth, while striker David Kelly had arrived on Tyneside a few months before Keegan was appointed. Newcastle began the season with 11 successive wins and led the league virtually all season, and the club record signing of Bristol City striker Andy Cole in February further strengthened their side; Cole netted 12 goals in his first 12 games for the club. The addition of Charlton Athletic's Rob Lee bolstered the midfield in the autumn.", "Newcastle excelled in the first half of the 1995\u201396 season, going ten points ahead on 23 December 1995 and holding a 12-point lead from early in January to 4 February. After a 2\u20130 defeat at West Ham United on 21 February, the lead was cut to nine points. A 1\u20130 defeat at the hands of fellow title challengers Manchester United cut the gap to a single point on 4 March, and within two weeks Newcastle's lead was overhauled and they were unable to recover it. Newcastle's 4\u20133 defeat to Liverpool on 3 April is widely considered to be one of the classic Premier League games. With two games remaining Newcastle and Manchester United both had 76 points. Newcastle only got one point in a 1\u20131 drawn match against Nottingham Forest on 2 May, and with a 1\u20131 draw for Newcastle against Tottenham Hotspur on the final day of the season on 5 May, the title was won by Manchester United, whose 3\u20130 triumph at Middlesbrough would have won them the title regardless of Newcastle's result against Tottenham. Keegan stated in 2018 that if Newcastle United had won the title in that season, the squad, which included players such as Les Ferdinand, Darren Peacock, David Ginola, Peter Beardsley, Faustino Asprilla and Rob Lee would have stayed together, may have built up a momentum, and won more trophies."]}, {"page": "Robert Lee", "response": ["* Rob Lee (born 1966), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Stuart Pearce", "response": ["Pearce joined Newcastle United along with fellow veterans John Barnes and Ian Rush in the 1997\u201398 season under Kenny Dalglish, and played in the 1998 FA Cup final, though again he emerged on the defeated side. He scored once during his spell at Newcastle, in a UEFA Champions League tie against Dynamo Kyiv. Eventually, Pearce was isolated, along with other players including Barnes and Rob Lee, after Ruud Gullit succeeded Dalglish. A number of players were treated coldly by Gullit, and Pearce along with Barnes and Lee were made to train with the reserves despite cumulatively having over 150 England caps between them. Both Pearce and Barnes assert in their autobiographies Gullit felt threatened by the senior players in the squad, and they felt they were being sidelined to prevent them challenging him for the manager's position should it arise. Pearce claims also that he once kicked Gullit up in the air during a training session, and a number of other players sniggered at this due to Gullit's poor relationship with them."]}, {"page": "Nigel Spackman", "response": ["After Spackman left Barnsley, he began a new career in the media, becoming a pundit with Sky Sports before re-entering management with Millwall in 2006.
