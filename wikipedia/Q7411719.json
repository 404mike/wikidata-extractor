In 1961 he received an AM and a Ph.D. in 1963 from Princeton University. He started with the University of Toronto becoming an Assistant Professor (1963\u20131966), Associate Professor (1966\u20131970), Professor (1970\u20131984), University Professor (1984\u20131998), and upon his retirement in 1998, University Professor Emeritus. Since 2000 he is a Professor at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev. He became a citizen of Canada in 1967 and of Israel in 2000.\nSamuel Hollander is one of the most influential and controversial living authors on History of Economic Thought, especially on classical economics. His monumental studies of Adam Smith, David Ricardo, Thomas Malthus and John Stuart Mill have provoked some sharp reactions. Especially his \"new view\" of David Ricardo as a direct predecessor of later neo-classical economists such as Marshall and Walras has triggered heated debates. Apart from many critics he has also enjoyed the support of a considerable number of prominent fellow economists. His work was highly recommended by the late Lord Robbins, who says \"... he really surpasses all previous historians of economic thought, especially on Ricardo\" (Robbins, 1998, p. 143).\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "David Ricardo", "response": ["* Samuel Hollander (1979).

To scholars promoting this view, there is no hard and fast line between classical and neoclassical economics. There may be shifts of emphasis, such as between the long run and the short run and between supply and demand, but the neoclassical concepts are to be found confused or in embryo in classical economics. To these economists, there is only one theory of value and distribution. Alfred Marshall is a well-known promoter of this view. Samuel Hollander is probably its best current proponent.", "* Samuel Hollander (1987). Classical Economics.
