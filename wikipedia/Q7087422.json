The regaining of this lost ground was entirely due to the bravery and presence of mind of this NCO who accomplished his task in the midst of a hail of bombs from the enemy.He later achieved the rank of sergeant.His Victoria Cross is displayed at The Guards Regimental Headquarters (Coldstream Guards RHQ), Wellington Barracks, London.The King George V was in France at the time and was seriously injured on 28 October 1915 when thrown by his horse at a troop review. The King sustained a broken pelvis and deep bruising, and he was taken to a hospital train for the journey home.  He insisted on presenting the VC to the Lance-Sergeant on the train, so Oliver Brooks came to the King's Bedside but the Monarch was unable to pin it on to the soldier's khaki uniform.  But with some assistance, it was done - a unique medal ceremony.", "link_mentions": {}}}
