Samuel John Hill (1825 - 1881) and Leonora Josephina Muller (1833 - 1917).\nHill received a bachelor's degree in 1873 and an M.A. in 1876 from University College, London. In 1880\u20131884 he was a professor of mathematics at Mason College (which later became Birmingham University). In 1891 he earned his Sc.D. from Cambridge University. From 1884 to 1907 he was Professor of Pure Mathematics at University College, London and from 1907 to 1923 Astor Professor of Mathematics, University of London.In 1894 Hill was elected FRS. In 1926 and 1927 he served as president of the Mathematical Association. \nHill was one of the people to whom C. L. T. Griffith sent, in 1912, some of Ramanujan's work.He married Minnie Grace Tarbotton, daughter of Marriott Ogle Tarbotton at St Saviour's Church, Paddington on 21 December 1892. \nHis two sons were Roderic Hill and Geoffrey T.
