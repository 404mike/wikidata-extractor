Wedgbury scored once during the campaign, a low volley from George Donnelly's cross in a 2\u20132 draw with fellow strugglers Hereford United at Moss Rose in March 2012. He was described as \"visibly distraught\" following Macclesfield's 2\u20130 defeat to Burton Albion, the game that confirmed the club's relegation, and he stated \u2014 \"It was a sad day. We feel we've let the fans, the club, the board, everyone down. It's the first time I've experienced anything like that in my career. I'm devastated. We're truly sorry, we've let our loyal fans down after 15 years in the Football League and we know we're to blame\".

Wedgbury was once again a regular throughout the season, making 43 appearances in all competitions. He particularly impressed during Macclesfield's FA Cup run during the season, as they defeated Cardiff City in the Third Round, before bowing out in the next round following a narrow 1\u20130 defeat to eventual winners, Wigan Athletic. After Macclesfield's 2\u20131 victory over Cambridge United on 20 April 2013, the club's final game of the season, Wedgbury was voted as both Fans and Players' Player of the Year.
