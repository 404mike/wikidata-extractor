He made his debut in a 0\u20130 draw with Doncaster Rovers in 1950. His performances in the 1951\u201352 season earned him a call-up for the England B team. Towards the end of that season he sustained a serious knee injury in a match against Notts County which kept him out for the whole of the following season. On his return he found his place in the squad taken by Ron Stitfall and, although he stayed at the club until 1958, he struggled to break into the side again. He returned to non-league football after leaving Cardiff, including briefly managing Kent club Sittingbourne.\nAfter his retirement from football, Rutter set up his own tropical bird business in Cardiff's central market.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sittingbourne F.C.", "response": ["*Charles Rutter"]}, {"page": "2012 in Wales", "response": ["*19 October \u2013 Charles Rutter, Cardiff City football player, 84"]}, {"page": "Rutter, Charles", "response": ["#redirectCharles Rutter"]}]}}
