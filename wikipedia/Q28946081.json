Tradition states one of Harla's main towns was Metehara and the area between Harar and Dire Dawa is still referred to as Harla. The Harla inhabited Tchertcher and various other areas in the Horn of Africa, where they erected various tumuli. According to historian Richard Wilding, tales indicate Harla lived in the interior of Ogaden and by the seashores of modern Somaliland prior to the Somali and Oromo movements into these regions.", "According to historian Richard Wilding Harla were ancient Cushitic however ethnologist Ulrich Brauk\u00e4mper suggests a Semitic variation which he labels \"Harala-Harari\" later developed in the Islamic period. Harala-Harari speakers were evidently disrupted by the Oromo migrations, leading to isolated related Semitic languages of Harari surviving in the walled city of Harar, Zay language on the island of Lake Zway and in parts of eastern Gurage territory such as Silt\u02bce language.", "* Richard Wilding, The Arla, the Argobba and Links between the Coast and the Highlands.
