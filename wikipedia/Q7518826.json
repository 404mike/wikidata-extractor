This was despite having a succession of different strike partners throughout the season, including Simon Garner, Luther Blissett, David Speedie and even midfielder Gary Robson. However, when Andy Hunt arrived at Albion in March 1993, he and Taylor quickly forged a successful striking partnership that would last several seasons. Hunt and Taylor were part of the Baggies team that beat Port Vale at Wembley in the Division Two playoff final, to secure promotion to Division One. In the second half, with the game still goalless, Taylor was through on goal when he was brought down by former Leeds teammate Peter Swan. Swan's subsequent dismissal proved to be the turning point in the game, with Hunt scoring the first goal in a 3\u20130 victory."]}, {"page": "Joe Garner", "response": ["Born in Blackburn, Garner started his career at then Premier League club Blackburn Rovers and playing as a striker played in the same position as his namesake Simon Garner, Blackburn's highest-ever goalscorer and club legend during the 1980s and early 1990s. Contrary to some stories, the two are not related. He played for the youth and reserve teams at Ewood Park and was a prolific scorer at youth level, his record including scoring two hat tricks in one game against Manchester United U16. Despite Blackburn having high hopes for the player, Garner didn't make the breakthrough into the Blackburn Rovers senior squad due to competition for places in the Blackburn line up with players such as Paul Dickov, Paul Gallagher, Craig Bellamy, Benni McCarthy and Roque Santa Cruz forcing Garner to drop down two divisions in search of regular first team football."]}, {"page": "East Lancashire derby", "response": ["Blackburn returned to the top flight in 1957\u201358, where they would stay until 1966.

Both clubs were relegated in 1970\u201371; Burnley went down to the second tier, while Blackburn were relegated to the third tier. Burnley returned to the First Division two years later but upon relegation in 1975\u201376, they rejoined Rovers who had been promoted from the Third Division in 1974\u201375. Burnley again had the edge in the fixture, winning four of the six matches, with midfielder Peter Noble scoring in four of the games. Rovers went down again at the end of the 1978\u201379 season, but bounced straight back while Burnley moved into the opposite direction entering the Third Division for the first time at the end of 1979\u201380. Burnley won promotion in 1981\u201382 to set up a renewal of the fixture. The games in 1982\u201383 were both won by Rovers and would ultimately prove to be the last between them in the 20th century.
