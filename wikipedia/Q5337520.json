He also played in Newton Heath's 6\u20131 defeat away to Preston North End in the first round of the FA Cup on 18 January 1890, and was part of the side that won a third consecutive Manchester and District Challenge Cup.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1889\u201390 Newton Heath LYR F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Edgar Wilson"]}, {"page": "T.

On 15 March, he filled in at right half for the absent Roger Doughty, before an extended run on the left side of the forward line that lasted until the end of the season, filling in first for George Owen for seven games at inside left, then for Edgar Wilson for one game at outside left. During that run of eight games, he scored three goals, the first in a 9\u20131 home win over Small Heath on 7 April, then in a 2\u20131 home win over Birmingham St George's on 19 April and a 2\u20131 home defeat to Sheffield Wednesday on 26 April. He would have had a further two goals from a home match against Grimsby Town on 4 January, but the match was ordered to be replayed due to the poor state of the pitch. On 3 May, he played at inside right in the final of the Manchester Cup against Royton at Brooke's Bar, and scored a hat-trick as Newton Heath won 5\u20132, their fourth Manchester Cup title."]}, {"page": "Edgar Wilson (disambiguation)", "response": ["Edgar Wilson was a member of the US House of Representatives for Ohio between 1899\u20131903.", "Edgar Wilson may also refer to:", "* Edgar Wilson (footballer), English footballer", "* Edgar Wilson (died 1976), American businessman, namesake of the Edgar Wilson Award"]}]}}
