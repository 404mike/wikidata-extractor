He trained in Liverpool and then practiced in London, where from 1913, he worked in partnership with Henry Percy Adams and Charles Holden. Earlier work in London from 1901 was with Edward Schroeder Prior.During the First World War, he served in the Royal Army Medical Corps.He was the architect of Stanley Spencer's Sandham Memorial Chapel.His architectural work included a number of hospitals. These included the new Westminster Hospital (1939), Royal Westminster Ophthalmic Hospital (1928), Southend Hospital (1932), and the Mineral Water Hospital in Bath.Pearson married Melinda Elizabeth Osborne in 1932. His obituary was published in The Times on 27 March 1953.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Charles Holden", "response": ["The practice became Adams & Holden in 1907 when Holden became a partner and Adams, Holden & Pearson when Lionel Pearson became a partner in 1913. In 1913, Holden was awarded the RIBA's Godwin medal and \u00a365 to study architecture abroad. He travelled to America in April 1913 and studied the organisation of household and social science departments at American universities in preparation for his design of the Wren-influenced Kings College for Women, Kensington. Other buildings by Holden before the First World War include modernist office buildings in Holborn and Oxford Street, an extension in red brick of Alfred Waterhouse's Shire Hall in Bedford, and Arts and Crafts Sutton Valence School, Kent."]}, {"page": "Stanley Spencer", "response": ["The Sandham Memorial Chapel in Burghclere was a colossal undertaking. Spencer's paintings cover a twenty-one foot high, seventeen-and-half foot wide end wall, eight seven foot high lunettes, each above a predella, with two twenty-eight feet long irregularly shaped strips between the lunettes and the ceiling. The Behrends were exceptionally generous patrons and not only paid for the chapel to be built to Spencer's specifications but also paid the rent on the London studio where he completed The Resurrection, Cookham and built a house for him and Carline to live in nearby while working at Burghclere, as Spencer would be painting the canvases in situ. The chapel was designed to Spencer's specifications by the architect Lionel Pearson and was modelled on Giotto's Arena Chapel in Padua."]}, {"page": "Royal Artillery Memorial", "response": ["The Royal Artillery Memorial is a First World War memorial located on Hyde Park Corner in London, England. Designed by Charles Sargeant Jagger, with architectural work by Lionel Pearson, and unveiled in 1925, the memorial commemorates the 49,076 soldiers from the Royal Artillery killed in the First World War. The static nature of the conflict, particularly on the Western Front, meant that artillery played a major role in the war, though physical reminders of the fighting were often avoided in the years after the war. The Royal Artillery War Commemoration Fund (RAWCF) was formed in 1918 to preside over the regiment's commemorations, aware of some dissatisfaction with memorials to previous wars. The RAWCF approached several eminent architects but its insistence on a visual representation of artillery meant that none was able to produce a satisfactory design. Thus they approached Jagger, himself an ex-soldier who had been wounded in the war. Jagger produced a design which was accepted in 1922, though he modified it several times before construction.", "Jagger engaged the architect Lionel Pearson to design the stone structure of the memorial, and through June and July 1921 the RAWCF and the authorities considered the proposal. Jagger's model was similar to the eventual memorial, but had only two gunners at either end of an oblong memorial; the howitzer on the top was smaller than the eventual version, and pointed sideways, rather than lengthways along the pedestal.Curl, pp.84\u201385. In reporting to the committee, Jagger said that he felt strongly that the design should unashamedly focus on the events of the war, noting that it \"should in every sense be a war memorial\". Jagger explained that the artillery had \"terrific power\" and was the \"last word in force\", and that the howitzer he had chosen was the only suitable weapon to symbolise those capabilities.Curl, p.85. During the design process, the committee presented Jagger with many suggestions. He gladly accepted their advice on technical matters related to artillery procedures and the appearance of the howitzer, but was protective of his artistic independence and would not brook suggestions which he felt would impinge on the quality of the work.King, p.118. There were concerns on the committee that the design would shock members of the public, especially women, but the RAWCF eventually voted 50 to 15 in favour of accepting the design and the proposed cost of \u00a325,000. Jagger was formally awarded the contract for the memorial in March 1922."]}, {"page": "Gunner (rank)", "response": ["There is a bronze statue of a gunner called \"The Ammunition Carrier\" as part of the Royal Artillery Memorial in Hyde Park Corner, commemorating the Royal Artillery Regiment's service and memorializing its losses in World War I. The other bronze figures are \"The Captain\" (at the front), \"The Driver\" (at the left side), and \"The Fallen Soldier\" (at the rear) and it is topped with an elevated stone howitzer. The statues were done by Charles Sargeant Jagger and the stone monument was designed by Lionel Pearson.
