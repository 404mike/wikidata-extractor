His father was twice mayor of Northwich. Young was educated at the local Sir John Deane's Grammar School, from where he won a scholarship to Christ's Hospital, Horsham, and subsequently, in 1930, an organ scholarship to Selwyn College, Cambridge, where he read English, Music and History (studying composition under Cyril Rootham). After graduation, he completed a doctorate (Mus.D.) at Trinity College, Dublin. From 1934 to 1937 he was a Director of Music at Stranmillis Teacher Training College in Belfast. From 1937 to 1944, Young was a Musical Adviser to Stoke-on-Trent Local Education Authority. After that, he became Director of Music at Wolverhampton College of Technology, a position he would occupy from 1944 to 1966. From 1998 until his death in 2004, Young was an Honorary Fellow of Selwyn College, Cambridge.\nYoung published more than 50 books. Among those are biographies of musicians such as George Frideric Handel (1947), Ralph Vaughan Williams (1953), Sir Edward Elgar (1955), Robert Schumann (1957), Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly (1964), Sir Arthur Sullivan (1971) and Sir George Grove (1980).  For younger readers he also wrote a series on composers such as Handel, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven and Benjamin Britten.\nYoung published a suite from an unfinished opera by Elgar, The Spanish Lady. A chapter of his book Elgar, O. M. includes letters and a synopsis of the play, with the characters and musical sketches described.His own compositions include: \"Virgin's Slumber Song\" (1932), From a Child's Garden (Robert Louis Stevenson; 1941), Passacaglia for violin and piano (1931), Fugal Concerto in G minor for 2 pianos and strings (1951), and Elegy for String Orchestra (1960).\nYoung was also an avid football fan and historian, writing several histories of league clubs, including Wolverhampton Wanderers (Centenary Wolves 1877-1977) and Manchester United (Heinemann 1960), plus a history of the game itself (A History of British Football).  Young was also briefly a Labour councillor in Wolverhampton, gaining the Wednesfield Heath ward from the Conservatives in a by-election in April 1974 and representing it until defeated in May 1976.\nAfter the death of his first wife, Netta, Young married Renee Morris, who survived him with three sons and a daughter of his first marriage.\nYoung's archive is held at the Cadbury Research Library, University of Birmingham.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Edward Elgar", "response": ["In his final years, Elgar experienced a musical revival.

While in France, he visited his fellow composer Frederick Delius at his house at Grez-sur-Loing. He was sought out by younger musicians such as Adrian Boult, Malcolm Sargent and John Barbirolli, who championed his music when it was out of fashion.Moore (1979), pp. 42\u201347, 56\u201359, 96\u201398Aldous, p. 124 He began work on an opera, The Spanish Lady, and accepted a commission from the BBC to compose a Third Symphony.

Upon Frederick's accession in 1740, Bach became a member of the royal orchestra. He was by this time one of the foremost clavier players in Europe, and his compositions, which date from 1731, include about thirty sonatas and concert pieces for harpsichord and clavichord. During his time there, Berlin was a rich artistic environment, where Bach mixed with many accomplished musicians, including several notable former students of his father, and important literary figures, such as Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, with whom the composer would become close friends."]}, {"page": "Pomp and Circumstance Marches", "response": ["=====Version orchestrated by Percy M.

Young observes was not adopted by Mozart and other later arrangers of the music. The work begins quietly, with instrumental and solo movements preceding the first appearance of the chorus, whose entry in the low alto register is muted.Hogwood, pp. 17\u201321 A particular aspect of Handel's restraint is his limited use of trumpets throughout the work. After their introduction in the Part I chorus \"Glory to God\", apart from the solo in \"The trumpet shall sound\" they are heard only in \"Hallelujah\" and the final chorus \"Worthy is the Lamb\".Young, p. 63 It is this rarity, says Young, that makes these brass interpolations particularly effective: \"Increase them and the thrill is diminished\".Young, p. 64 In  \"Glory to God\", Handel marked the entry of the trumpets as da lontano e un poco piano, meaning \"quietly, from afar\"; his original intention had been to place the brass offstage (in disparte) at this point, to highlight the effect of distance.Luckett, p. 93 In this initial appearance the trumpets lack the expected drum accompaniment, \"a deliberate withholding of effect, leaving something in reserve for Parts II and III\"  according to Luckett.Luckett, p. 87"]}, {"page": "Johann Christian Bach", "response": ["*Percy M.
