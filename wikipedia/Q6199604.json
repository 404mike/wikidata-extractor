His league debut came on 2 September, as a substitute for Kevin Hill in the 6\u20132 defeat to Brighton & Hove Albion at the Withdean Stadium. He had to wait 12 months for his next first team appearance, making sporadic appearances, mostly as a substitute for Roy McFarland's side. He remained with Torquay until May 2004 when he was released after Torquay's promotion to Football League One. Later that month he joined non-league side Bath City, along with Dean Stevens who had also been released by Torquay.\nHe was released by Bath the following May (2005). In August 2006 he appeared for Tooting & Mitcham's reserve side.\nBenefield joined successful Sunday League side Lansdown F.C. in February 2007, making his debut in the 6\u20135 away defeat against South West Alliance.
