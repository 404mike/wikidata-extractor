The motivation for this was the clich\u00e9 that in French culture, \"older\" women tended to \"train\" the younger men in sexual matters. Numerous actors were considered for or sought roles in the film. Doris Day turned down an offer because the nudity required by the role offended her. Joan Crawford inquired about the part, while Lauren Bacall and Audrey Hepburn both wanted the role. Patricia Neal turned down the film as she had recently recovered from a stroke and did not feel ready to accept such a major role. Geraldine Page also turned it down. Other actors considered for the part included Claire Bloom, Angie Dickinson, Sophia Loren, Judy Garland, Rita Hayworth, Susan Hayward, Anouk Aim\u00e9e, Jennifer Jones, Deborah Kerr, Eva Marie Saint, Rosalind Russell, Simone Signoret, Jean Simmons, Lana Turner, Eleanor Parker, Anne Baxter and Shelley Winters. Angela Lansbury also asked about playing the part. Ava Gardner sought the role of Mrs. Robinson, and reportedly called Nichols saying,\"I want to see you! I want to talk about this Graduate thing!\" Nichols did not seriously consider her for the role (he wanted a younger woman as Bancroft was 35 and Gardner was 45), but did end up visiting her hotel. He later recounted that \"she sat at a little French desk with a telephone, she went through every movie star clich\u00e9. She said, 'All right, let's talk about your movie. First of all, I strip for nobody.'\" Meanwhile, Natalie Wood turned down not only the role of Mrs. Robinson, but also that of Elaine."]}, {"page": "The Big Country", "response": ["The Big Country is a 1958 American epic Western film directed by William Wyler, starring Gregory Peck, Jean Simmons, Carroll Baker, Charlton Heston, and Burl Ives. The supporting cast features Charles Bickford and Chuck Connors. Filmed in Technicolor and Technirama, the picture was based on the serialized magazine novel Ambush at Blanco Canyon by Donald Hamilton and was co-produced by Wyler and Peck. The opening title sequence was created by Saul Bass.", "* Jean Simmons as Julie Maragon", "Director William Wyler was known for shooting an exorbitant number of takes on his films, usually without explaining to the actors what to do differently except \"[make it] better\", and this one was no exception. Many of the actors, including Jean Simmons and Carroll Baker, were so traumatized by his directing style that they refused to speak about the experience for years. Simmons later said they constantly received rewrites for the script, making acting extremely difficult. Gregory Peck and Wyler, who were good friends, fought constantly on the set and had a falling out for three years, although they later reconciled. Wyler and Charles Bickford also clashed, as they had done 30 years previously on the production of his 1929 film Hell's Heroes. Burl Ives, however, claimed to have enjoyed making the film.", "John McCarten of The New Yorker wrote, \"Of those involved in this massive enterprise, Mr. Bickford and Mr. Ives are the most commendable as they whoop and snort about the sagebrush. But even they are hardly credible types, and as for the rest of the cast, they can be set down as a rather wooden lot.\" Philip K. Scheuer of the Los Angeles Times called the film \"too self consciously 'epical' to be called great, but at its best, which is frequently, it's better than good.\" The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote that the picture's attempts to convey a message were for the most part \"superficial and pedestrian,\" and found that \"the pivotal character of McKay, played on a monotonously self-righteous note by Gregory Peck, never comes alive. It is mainly due to the power of the climactic canyon battle, and Burl Ives' interesting playing as Rufus, that this remains a not unsympathetic film, decorated pleasantly by Jean Simmons and with spirit by Carroll Baker.\""]}, {"page": "1960s", "response": ["* Jean Simmons"]}, {"page": "1950s", "response": ["* Jean Simmons"]}, {"page": "1940s", "response": ["* Jean Simmons"]}, {"page": "1946", "response": ["** David Lean's film of Great Expectations, based on the Charles Dickens novel, and featuring John Mills, Valerie Hobson, Martita Hunt, Alec Guinness, Francis L.
