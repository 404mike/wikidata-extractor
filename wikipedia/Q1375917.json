Their return journey to McMurdo Sound was a race against starvation, on half-rations for much of the way. At one point, Shackleton gave his one biscuit allotted for the day to the ailing Frank Wild, who wrote in his diary: \"All the money that was ever minted would not have bought that biscuit and the remembrance of that sacrifice will never leave me\". They arrived at Hut Point just in time to catch the ship."]}, {"page": "Mount Erebus", "response": ["Mount Erebus' summit crater rim was first achieved by members of Sir Ernest Shackleton's party; Professor Edgeworth David, Sir Douglas Mawson, Dr Alister Mackay, Jameson Adams, Dr Eric Marshall and Phillip Brocklehurst (who did not reach the summit),  in 1908. Its first known solo ascent and the first winter ascent was accomplished by British mountaineer Roger Mear on 7 June 1985, a member of the \"In the Footsteps of Scott\" expedition.Mear, Roger and Robert Swan, In the Footsteps of Scott, pp. 95\u2013104.
