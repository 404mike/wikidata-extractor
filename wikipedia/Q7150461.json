He turned professional 18 months later, but it was not for another four years that he made his first team debut, playing in the 3\u20130 defeat away to Everton on 19 August 1969. His first \u2013 and only \u2013 goal for the club came in the December of that year. In a League Cup semi-final against Manchester City on 17 December 1969, Edwards let fly with a long-range effort that flew past the City goalkeeper. It proved to be the highlight of Edwards' Manchester United career. In his first full season with the club, Edwards made 28 appearances for Manchester United, but a run of bad form halfway through his second season resulted in a short period in the reserves. Up to that point, Edwards had mainly been deployed as a right-back, but when he returned to the first team, he was played at centre-back.\nFrank O'Farrell took over as manager of Manchester United in June 1971, and Edwards fell out of favour in the new manager's team selections. He remained at the club for two further seasons, but he found first team opportunities hard to come by and he was loaned to Oldham Athletic for six months in September 1972 before they signed him for \u00a315,000 in the summer of 1973. The following season, Edwards helped the Latics to their second Third Division title. He stayed with them until 1978, 112 appearances and seven goals later, when he moved to Stockport County, with whom he had spent a short period on loan in 1976\u201377. After 67 appearances and two goals for Stockport, Edwards retired from professional football.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Paul Edwards", "response": ["Paul Edwards may refer to:", "*Paul Edwards (boxer) (born 1986), English flyweight boxer", "*Paul Edwards (footballer, born 1947), English footballer who played for Manchester United, Oldham Athletic, and Stockport County", "*Paul Edwards (footballer, born 1963), English footballer who played for West Brom and Wolves", "*Paul Edwards (footballer, born 1965), English footballer who played for Crewe and Shrewsbury", "*Paul Edwards (footballer, born 1980), English footballer", "*Paul Edwards (footballer, born 1982), former English footballer for Crewe Alexandra", "*Paul Edwards (racing driver) (born 1978), American racing car driver", "*Paul Edwards (shot putter) (born 1959), Welsh shot putter", "*Paul Edwards (composer) (born 1955), English composer and organist", "*Paul Edwards (literary scholar) (1926\u20131992), British literary historian", "*Paul Edwards (philosopher) (1923\u20132004), Austrian-American philosopher", "*Paul Edwards (politician) (born 1961), politician in Manitoba, Canada"]}, {"page": "Chris Garland", "response": ["He formed an effective strike partnership with big target man John Galley in the 1968\u201369 and 1969\u201370 seasons, and was linked with moves away to bigger clubs.
