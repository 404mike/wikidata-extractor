He was stationed at St Mark's School in Mapanza, a community in the Southern Province of present-day Zambia (called Rhodesia at the time). He is best known for his ethnomusicological work, particularly his two-volume Studies in African Music. He made an important contribution to the literature with his work in African rhythmic structure.\nIn 1934 he introduced the technical term cross-rhythm: Formulae of movement, phrases or motifs are combined in that way, that their starting place, main accents and, or beat reference points \"cross\", that is, that they do not coincide.He is also remembered for his controversial theories on scales and the music of the xylophone, which he claimed migrated from Southeast Asia to Africa. One hundred of Jones' acetate field recordings are part of the British Library Sound Archive (number C424).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Music of Africa", "response": ["The ethnomusicological pioneer Arthur Morris Jones (1889\u20131980) observed that the shared rhythmic principles of Sub-Saharan African music traditions constitute one main system.Jones, A.

In 1959, Arthur Morris Jones published his landmark work Studies in African Music, in which he identified the triple-pulse clave as the guide pattern for many pieces of music from ethnic groups across Africa.Jones (1959: 3). An important contribution of ethnomusicology to clave theory is the understanding that the clave matrix is generated by cross-rhythm.Locke, David (1982). \"Principles of Off-Beat Timing and Cross-Rhythm in Southern Ewe Dance Drumming\u201d Society for Ethnomusicology Journal Nov. 11.", "Because  clave-based music is generated from cross-rhythm, it is possible to count or feel the  clave in several different ways. The ethnomusicologist Arthur Morris Jones correctly identified the importance of this key pattern, but he mistook its accents as indicators of meter rather than the counter-metric phenomena they are. Similarly, while Anthony King identified the triple-pulse \"son clave\" as the \u2018standard pattern\u2019 in its simplest and most basic form, he did not correctly identify its metric structure. King represented the pattern in a polymetric  time signature.King, Anthony (1961:14). Yoruba Sacred Music from Ekiti.

Tracey recorded all over Zambia in the 1950s, but also specifically recorded in the Zambezi Valley in 1958 at the request of anthropologist Elizabeth Colson before the creation of the Kariba Dam and Jones did his at Mapanza in Zambia's Southern Province.  Catholic missionaries, J. J. Corbeil and Frank Wafer have also contributed to our knowledge of traditional Zambian music.  Father Corbeil collected and documented the instrumental tradition of the Bemba in Northeastern Zambia.  Frank Wafer, a Jesuit priest located at Chikuni, has collected and preserved Batonga music.  A community radio station dedicated to promoting Batonga music and culture is also part of the Chikuni Mission Station.  They organize an annual festival of Batonga music which attracts as many as 10,000 visitors according to the organizers.  Recent ethnomusicological work has been done by native Zambians such as Mwesa Isaiah Mapoma, Joseph Ng'andu, John Anderson Mwesa and others. Recent field recordings made by native Zambian Michael Baird in Southern Province have been released on his SWP label, as well as producing two excellent compilations of Zambian hits from the 60s, 70s and 80s."]}, {"page": "Arthur Jones", "response": ["*Arthur Morris Jones (1889\u20131980), British missionary and musicologist"]}, {"page": "Arthur morris jones", "response": ["#REDIRECT Arthur Morris Jones "]}, {"page": "A.M.
