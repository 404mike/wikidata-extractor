During this time he gained the experience to write Living, his second novel, which he worked on during 1927 and 1928. In 1929, he married his second cousin, the Hon. Adelaide Biddulph, also known as 'Dig'. They were both great-grandchildren of the first Baron Leconfield. Their son Sebastian was born in 1934.Romancing: The Life and Work of Henry Green by Jeremy Treglown, 2000 In 1940, Green published Pack My Bag, which he regarded as a nearly-accurate autobiography.The Paris Review, The Art of Fiction No. 22, Summer 1958 No. 19 During World War II Green served as a fireman in the Auxiliary Fire Service and these wartime experiences are echoed in his novel Caught; they were also a strong influence on his subsequent novel, Back.", "After his death Green's works went out of print and were little-read. However, since the early 1990s there have been attempts to revive his reputation. In 1993 Surviving, a collection of previously unpublished works, edited by his grandson Matthew Yorke, was published by Viking Press. Other works have been reissued. Many contemporary authors have cited him as an influence, including John Updike,Charlie Rose  writing, \"His novels made more of a stylistic impact upon me than those of any writer living or dead\" in an introduction to an edition (Penguin Twentieth-Century Classics USA, 1993) of three of Green's novels (Living, Loving and Party Going). The novelist Sebastian Faulks, who also wrote an introduction to an edition (Vintage Classics UK, 2005) of these three novels, calls Green \"unique\" and says: \"No fiction has ever thrilled me as the great moments in Living and Loving\". David Lodge calls Green \"an exceptionally gifted and truly original writer\". In his essay The Genesis of Secrecy Frank Kermode discussed Green's novel Party Going and suggested that behind its realistic surface the book hides a complex network of mythical allusions. This led Kermode to include Green in the Modernist movement and to suggest that the novelist was strongly influenced by T.S. Eliot's idea of a \"mythic method\". Green's work has otherwise received comparatively little critical attention from academics; three of the few academics engaged with Green's work are Nick Shepley, author of Henry Green: Class, Style, and the Everyday (Oxford University Press, 2016) Jeremy Treglown, author of Romancing: The Life and Work of Henry Green (Faber and Faber, 2000), and Becci Carver, author of Granular Modernism (Oxford University Press, 2015).

In his 1984 autobiography, Dahl states that when he was a young fag, he was instructed to warm toilet seats for older boys at the school.

Dahl soon realised that Marlborough may have been a better choice, as life at Repton was difficult and cruel. The prefects, named Boazers as per school tradition, were utmost sadists and patrolled the school like secret police. The headmaster treated students similarly, and Dahl describes an occasion when his friend received several brutal strokes of the cane from the headmaster as punishment for misbehaviour. According to Dahl, this headmaster was Geoffrey Francis Fisher, who later became Archbishop of Canterbury and Bishop of London in 1939. However, according to Dahl's biographer, Jeremy Treglown, Dahl's memory was in error: the beating took place in May 1933, a year after Fisher had left Repton.
