Barrie Cadogan has toured and recorded with the band since 2006 as a replacement after the departure of guitarist Robert \"Throb\" Young.", "The band scheduled a short supporting tour to take place during July. The band had to postpone the dates. This led to speculation that there were problems within the band, and that one of the members may resign. The band's press agent issued a statement saying \"[i]t's not a drugs thing and it's not a nervous breakdown.\" Before the tour was scheduled to begin, Mulraney left the band and they were forced to use a drum machine. The initial dates were poorly received, but they eventually hired drummer Darrin Mooney and the gigs improved. Throughout the Vanishing Point tour Primal Scream employed the up-and-coming Asian Dub Foundation as a support act, helping them to break into the mainstream.", "*Darrin Mooney \u2013 drums, percussion (1997\u2013present)"]}, {"page": "Gary Moore", "response": ["From 1993 to 1994, Moore was a member of the short-lived power trio BBM (\"Baker Bruce Moore\"), which also featured Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker, both formerly of Cream.

Moore later said of the band's break-up: \"There were a lot of things within the band that would have made it impossible, long term. I think that politically Jack [Bruce] was used to having his own band, I was used to having my own band and so it was very difficult.\" In 2002, Moore collaborated with former Skunk Anansie bassist Cass Lewis and Primal Scream drummer Darrin Mooney in Scars, which released one album.
