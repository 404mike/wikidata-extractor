They met at Williams Lake, which made it a good choice for settlers and merchants. By 1861, Commissioner Nind had built a government house and had requested the funds to build a jail. With the centre of local government being at Williams Lake, the miners and businessmen all had to travel there to conduct their business and soon the town had a post office, a courthouse, a roadhouse and the jail that Nind had requested. Meanwhile, William Pinchbeck had not been idle and had built his own roadhouse, saloon and store. Eventually he would own most of the valley."]}, {"page": "Pinchbeck", "response": ["*William Pinchbeck, American pioneer"]}, {"page": "Philip Henry Nind", "response": ["In 1860 Nind took the position of Gold Commissioner and JP for Cariboo, British Columbia as the Cariboo Gold Rush was just getting under way.

While stationed in the Cariboo Nind wrote voluminous letters and reports to Vancouver Island governor James Douglas in Victoria, telling him about the many developments taking place in the district.
