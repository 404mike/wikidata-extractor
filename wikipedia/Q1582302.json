The designer Hans Schleger came to Britain as a refugee from Nazi Germany.

In 1935 the bus stop 'flag' was redesigned and simplified by Hans Schleger to include the roundel outline; the design has remained broadly the same since. A standard signs manual was created during this period, codifying the design principles that had developed."]}, {"page": "Documenta III", "response": ["|Hans Schleger (Z\u00e9r\u00f3) || Oskar Schlemmer || Joost Schmidt || Wolfgang Schmidt || Nicolas Sch\u00f6ffer ||"]}, {"page": "Schleger", "response": ["* Hans Schleger (1898\u20131976), German-English graphic designer"]}, {"page": "Z\u00e9r\u00f3", "response": ["#REDIRECT Hans Schleger"]}]}}
