After Montagu's suspension from office by Franklin, he travelled to London and managed to successfully plead his case and find the necessary support to nullify his suspension. Instead of a return to Van Diemen's Land, Montagu was offered the position of Colonial Secretary of the Cape Colony, which he accepted.\nFranklin's subsequent removal from office meant he would be available for command of the Royal Navy's renewed attempt to complete the charting of the Northwest Passage, through the Arctic archipelago. The Franklin expedition set out in 1845, and was never heard from again.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1797", "response": ["** John Montagu, Indian-born Tasmanian colonial secretary (d. 1853)"]}, {"page": "John Franklin", "response": ["* Joel, C.

In 1843, he proposed that convict labour be used to build a road along an entirely new route over the Outeniqua Mountains. In due course this was approved by the colonial secretary, John Montagu, and work was started in 1844, with H.\u00a0O. Farrel as superintendent of the project. The work turned out to be beyond him, and in his place Montagu appointed White, a qualified surveyor, who had recently become Road Inspector. Some 250\u00a0convicts were used to carry out the demanding work of constructing the new road. The project was eventually completed after four years' work at a cost of \u00a335,799 and opened to traffic in December\u00a01847, with the ceremonial opening taking place on 19\u00a0January 1848, and John Montagu personally attending.
