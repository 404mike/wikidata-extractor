of the club there were high hopes that the 1912\u201313 season would see Stoke come good in the top division of the Southern League. The players who had served the club well over the past 12 months or so were all retained and new players were added to the squad to make competition for places harder. The main ambition was a top six place, but by Christmas time Stoke were bottom of the table and stayed there. The directors attributed relegation to bad luck while the supporters blamed Barker. William Smith, who had been such a key player in attack missed most of the season through injury and his absence proved costly as Stoke had a very poor forward line. Only 14 goals were scored in the first 15 matches (4 against Watford) summed up Stoke's problems and there was no upturn in fortune after Christmas and relegation was duly suffered and it was back to the drawing board once more.", "|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| William Smith"]}, {"page": "1913\u201314 Stoke F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| William Smith"]}, {"page": "1914\u201315 Stoke F.C. season", "response": ["Stoke, now under the management of 39-year-old Peter Hodge the former boss of Raith Rovers, led the Division from virtually from the start. There was a familiar feeling to the squad with Dick Hope and Fred McCarthy the only players to come from outside the local area. Two departures in 1914 were William Smith whose long term leg injury got the better of him and skipper Ernest Mullineux. An impressive start was made to the 1914\u201315 season and a draw against Brentford on Christmas Day was only the third point Stoke had dropped. Stoke went on to comfortably claim the league title. There was also the emergence of Arthur Watkin who top scored with 24 league goals."]}, {"page": "List of Stoke City F.C. records and statistics", "response": ["|20=||align=\"left\"| William Smith||1909\u20131913||57||3||0||2||62"]}, {"page": "William Smith (footballer born 1886)", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Smith (footballer, born 1886)"]}, {"page": "Billy Smith (footballer, born 1886)", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Smith (footballer, born 1886)"]}]}}
