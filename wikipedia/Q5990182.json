Keanu confronts her in the Vic toilets, saying he still has feelings for her, but Sharon denies she feels the same. After Keanu ends his relationship with Louise and pursues Sharon again, she convinces Phil to send him to Spain on a job, which she is unaware is dangerous. After Keanu confronts her and tells her of the danger, she tries to convince him not to leave, but he does so anyway, telling her it's over. Keanu is beaten up in Spain, and Karen rages at Sharon, threatening to tell Phil of the affair unless he saves Keanu. Phil travels to Spain to help him, and he later returns to Walford, telling Sharon he blames her for what happened and now hates her. Sharon later discovers that Dennis has been involved with drug dealers, after Tiffany Butcher (Maisie Smith) informs her. This results in her punching Stix Redman (Kasey McKellar), breaking his nose and threatening him never to come near Dennis again. This results in problems with Dennis when he punches her, giving her a black eye. After Louise is kidnapped, she and Keanu begin a relationship, something Sharon is uncomfortable with. Louise later discovers she is pregnant with Keanu's baby, but after she discovers Phil was initially paying him to be in a relationship with her, she breaks up with him and tells Sharon she's pregnant and wants an abortion. Sharon takes her to the clinic, and confides in her about her own abortion many years earlier that she believed had left her infertile. Unbeknownst to her, Louise does not go through with the abortion after talking to Lola about being a mother. Sharon tries to talk to Keanu after he finds out about the abortion, and after a heart to heart in the Arches where they both admit they loved the other, they give into temptation and sleep together again. They both agree it can't happen again the following day, and Ben (now Max Bowden) nearly sees a tender moment between them. After Keanu's brothers are attacked by Dennis and other boys, Sharon realises that her parenting has contributed towards Dennis\u2019 behaviour, and decides they should attend family therapy. After some persuasion from Sharon, Louise eventually reveals to Keanu that she's still pregnant and they reunite, at the same time as Sharon takes a pregnancy test and discovers she is also pregnant. At family therapy the following day, Sharon cries over the stress of family life, as well as Phil and Dennis\u2019 poor attempts to engage with the therapy. At home afterwards, Sharon goes outside with a glass of wine, before smashing it, screaming and breaking down, realising what a mess her life has become and the stress of not knowing who the baby's father is. After looking at abortion clinics on the computer, Phil accidentally discovers she's pregnant, and Sharon lets him believe it's his. Phil later announces to the family that Sharon is pregnant, against her wishes. When Keanu discovers she's pregnant and that he could be the father, he decides that he should tell Louise about their affair. Sharon and Karen kidnap him in order to prevent this, tying him up in a warehouse in order to scare him by showing him what Phil would do if he found out. After a confrontation on the roof where Sharon tries to tell him it's not his baby, he returns home, promising not to reveal their affair as his future is now with Louise. Sharon breaks down again at home, and later decides with Phil that they need to have tests as there is a risk to the baby at her age."]}, {"page": "Strictly Come Dancing", "response": ["| style=\"background:silver;\"|Maisie Smith", "|colspan=\"2\"|HRVY & Janette Manrara, Maisie Smith & Gorka M\u00e1rquez, Jamie Laing & Karen Hauer", "| Maisie Smith", "|Maisie Smith", "| Rachel Stevens Ali Bastian Harry Judd Jason Donovan Denise Van Outen Abbey Clancy Kellie Bright Ore Oduba Debbie McGeeKelvin Fletcher Maisie SmithJohn Whaite", "| Jason Donovan & Kristina Rihanoff Denise van Outen & James Jordan Louis Smith & Flavia Cacace Natalie Gumede & Artem Chigvintsev Caroline Flack & Pasha KovalevKellie Bright & Kevin Clifton Ore Oduba & Joanne CliftonDanny Mac & Oti MabuseAshley Roberts & Pasha Kovalev Faye Tozer & Giovanni PerniceKelvin Fletcher & Oti MabuseBill Bailey & Oti Mabuse Maisie Smith & Gorka M\u00e1rquezRose Ayling-Ellis & Giovanni Pernice John Whaite & Johannes Radebe", "| HRVY & Janette ManraraMaisie Smith & Gorka M\u00e1rquez", "Comedian Bill Bailey, who was 55 when he competed in 2020, is the oldest series winner, while gymnast Louis Smith, who was 23 when he competed in 2012, is the youngest series winner.

A popular character who originally appeared in the serial between 1993 and 1999, Bianca was reintroduced in April 2008. Along with Bianca came four children, three of whom had not been seen in the serial before.

Actress Maisie Smith, aged 6 at the time of her casting, began filming for EastEnders four days a week from January 2008 and, according to her mother, shares traits with the character she plays: \"The role is an exaggeration of her own personality, she's a little madam. A lively character both on and off screen. The difference is, she's told to pronounce her t's at home!\"", "Digital Spy's Kris Green has said Maisie Smith is \"brilliant\" and \"one...to watch\", comparing her to Ellis Hollins, the award-winning child actor who plays Tom Cunningham in the Channel 4 teen soap opera Hollyoaks. She has also been praised by stage school teacher Sandra Singer, who said: \"Maisie has the most incredible memory and when it comes to script work she is fantastic. It is often very difficult for a six-year-old to act, but she handles it really well and adores it.\" In May 2009 Smith won 'Best Dramatic Performance from a young actor or actress' at the British Soap Awards. She was nominated again in 2011 for 'Best Young Performance'.
