Disgruntled BNP members left the party to found or join a wide range of rivals, among them the British Freedom Party, White Nationalist Party, Nationalist Alliance, Wolf's Hook White Brotherhood, British People's Party, England First Party, Britain First, Democratic Nationalists, and the New Nationalist Party. Various BNP members were involved in the nascent English Defence League (EDL)\u2014with EDL leader Tommy Robinson having been a former BNP activist\u2014although Griffin proscribed the organisation and condemned it as having been manipulated by \"Zionists\". The political scientist Chris Allen noted that the EDL shared much of the BNP's ideology, but that its \"strategies and actions\" were very different, with the EDL favouring street marches over electoral politics. By 2014, both the BNP and EDL were in decline, and Britain First\u2014founded by former BNP members James Dowson and Paul Golding\u2014had risen to prominence. It combined the electoral tactics of the BNP with the street marches of the EDL."]}, {"page": "1984 in film", "response": ["| Beat Street || Orion Pictures || Stan Lathan (director); Andrew Davis, David Gilbert, Paul Golding, Steven Hager (screenplay); Rae Dawn Chong, Guy Davis, Jon Chardiet, Leon W.
