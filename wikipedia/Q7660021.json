He was assigned to No. 70 Squadron to fly the Sopwith Camel single-seat fighter in May 1918. On 30 June, he gained his first victories, driving down an Albatros D.V and setting another ablaze. It would not be until 19 August that he would win again, when he destroyed a Fokker D.VII on an evening patrol. Again, there would be over a month's lapse, until he destroyed another Fokker D.VII on 28 September. On 1 October, Heron became an ace by destroying the only two-seater on his list; on the 7th he accounted for two more D.VII's, and three more on the 9th. For one of these, Heron cooperated with Captain Sydney Liversedge, Lieutenant Kenneth Watson and two other pilots to force down and capture a Fokker. Heron was appointed a flight commander with the temporary rank of captain on 23 October, going on to gain three more victories, two on 26 October, and his thirteenth and last on the 28th. In the end, besides the captured aircraft, Heron destroyed ten enemy machines and drove down two out of control.", "|10 || Fokker D.VII || Captured || West of Mayerneine || Shared with Captain Sydney Liversedge and Lieutenants E.
