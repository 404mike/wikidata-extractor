In his thirteen first-class appearances, he scored a total of 383 runs at an average of 15.95, with a high score of 65. This score, which was one of two first-class fifties he made, came against Nottinghamshire in 1998.In his debut season, Carpenter also made his List A debut against Surrey in the 1997 AXA Life League.

His appearances in this format went beyond his final first-class appearance in 2000, with his final List A match coming against Hampshire in the 2002 Norwich Union League. The majority of his List A appearances came in the 1998 and 1999 seasons, after which he found his opportunities limited. In his 57 List A matches, Carpenter scored a total of 827 runs at an average of 22.97, with a high score of 64 not out. This score was one of five half centuries he made in that format and came against Nottinghamshire in 1999.
