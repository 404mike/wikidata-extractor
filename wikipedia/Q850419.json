First held in 1956\u20131957 and contested at three year intervals, it has been contested every two years since 1984 when its scheduled times and venues were merged with those of Thomas Cup, the world men's team championship. In 2007, the Badminton World Federation decided to have Thomas and Uber Cup finals separated again but the proposal was ultimately abandoned. The Uber Cup is named after a former British women's badminton player, Betty Uber, who in 1950 had the idea of hosting a women's event similar to the men's. She also made the draw for the 1956\u20131957 inaugural tournament, which took place at Lytham St. Annes in Lancashire, England."]}, {"page": "All England Open Badminton Championships", "response": ["|rowspan=\"3\"| Herbert Uber Betty Uber", "| Marian Horsley Betty Uber", "|rowspan=\"4\"| Donald C.
