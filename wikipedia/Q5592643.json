He lived near his cousin, Robert Louis Stevenson during the final years of Stevenson's life, and went on to write a biography of him. After writing a few books, he spent time on education administration, including managing the education system of Staffordshire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Clara Collet", "response": ["Booth had planned for a chapter on women's work in his survey. In 1887 Alice Stopford Green started the investigation on women's work and wages, but in November 1888 she left Booth's project. Booth asked Beatrice Webb if she could complete the women's work study by March 1889. Webb was working on the study of the Jewish community, which had to be completed in February. Records show that Collet started work on the women's work survey in late November. It is not documented how Collet was recruited to Booth's team. Webb and Collet had a mutual friend, Eleanor Marx, and Collet had in 1887 attended the Toynbee Hall conference on women's work and wages, which had also been attended by Booth. Collet was formally employed by Booth in late 1888 and took over Green's study of women's work in the East End of London and contributed to Graham Balfour's study of Battersea Street. In 1890 she studied the Ashby-de-la-Zouch workhouse for Booth's work on the Poor Law Unions."]}, {"page": "Sidney Colvin", "response": ["Colvin was a significant editor of Stevenson's, preparing the Edinburgh edition of his works (1894\u201397); the Vailima Letters (1899), which Stevenson chiefly addressed to him;\"Vailima letters: Being Correspondence addressed by Robert Louis Stevenson to Sidney Colvin\" were first published by Methuen, London, 1895. and the posthumous collection of Letters (2 volumes, London, 1900). These publications made Colvin an authority on Stevenson's life and work. He also wrote the sketch of Stevenson for the Dictionary of National Biography (vol. liv.), and was to have written an authoritative Life, intended for publication simultaneously with the Letters, but was obliged to relinquish the task to Graham Balfour."]}, {"page": "Category talk:Presidents of the Royal Statistical Society", "response": ["* Graham Balfour, FRS, 1888-90"]}, {"page": "Sir Graham Balfour School", "response": ["Sir Graham Balfour School is a coeducational secondary school and sixth form located in Stafford, England.

While still a teenager, he developed a script for a play about Deacon Brodie, which he later reworked with the help of W. E. Henley and which was produced for the first time in 1882.Swearingen, Roger G. The Prose Writings of Robert Louis Stevenson. London: Macmillan, 1980. (ISBN) p. 37. In early 1884, he wrote the short story \"Markheim\", which he revised in 1884 for publication in a Christmas annual. According to his essay, \"A Chapter on Dreams\" (Scribner's, Jan. 1888), he racked his brains for an idea for a story and had a dream, and upon waking had the intuition for two or three scenes that would appear in the story Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. Biographer Graham Balfour quoted Stevenson's wife Fanny Stevenson: In the small hours of one morning,[...] I was awakened by cries of horror from Louis. Thinking he had a nightmare, I awakened him. He said angrily: \"Why did you wake me? I was dreaming a fine bogey tale.\" I had awakened him at the first transformation scene.", "The book was initially sold as a paperback for one shilling in the U.K. and for one penny in the U.S. These books were called \"shilling shockers\" or penny dreadfuls. The American publisher issued the book on 5 January 1886, four days before the first appearance of the U.K. edition issued by Longmans; Scribner's published 3,000 copies, only 1,250 of them bound in cloth. Initially, stores did not stock it until a review appeared in The Times on 25 January 1886 giving it a favourable reception. Within the next six months, close to 40 thousand copies were sold. As Stevenson's biographer Graham Balfour wrote in 1901, the book's success was probably due rather to the \"moral instincts of the public\" than to any conscious perception of the merits of its art. It was read by those who never read fiction and quoted in pulpit sermons and in religious papers.Graham Balfour, The Life of Robert Louis Stevenson Volume II, pp. 17-18 By 1901, it was estimated to have sold over 250,000 copies in the United States.Tim Middleton, Introduction to The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde: The Merry Men and Other Stories, Wordsworth Editions, 1993, pp. 9"]}, {"page": "1917 Birthday Honours", "response": ["*Graham Balfour, Secretary to the Staffordshire Education Committee."]}, {"page": "List of Knights Bachelor appointed in 1917", "response": ["|Graham Balfour"]}]}}
