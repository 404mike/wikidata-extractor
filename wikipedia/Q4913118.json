He went on to make 76 appearances over the next three years, amid competition from Grenville Millington, Mike Salmon, Billy O'Rourke and John Butcher. Harrington was first\u2013choice goalkeeper at Chester by the end of 1982\u201383, but an injury in the penultimate game of the season at Torquay United prematurely ended his campaign and led to defender Noel Bradley having to deputise for him. But Harrington recovered in time for one of his most memorable games for Chester in a League Cup tie against Bolton Wanderers in September 1983, when he saved the first three Bolton penalties in the penalty shoot-out to give Chester victory. This season saw him miss just five games for Chester, but unfortunately the campaign ended with the club finishing bottom of The Football League."]}, {"page": "Eric McManus", "response": ["He joined Bradford City in August 1982 where he made 139 appearances in three seasons at Valley Parade. Whilst at Bradford, he won the Third Division title in 1984\u201385. On the last day of that successful season his day was to turn into a nightmare when 56 spectators were killed in a horrendous stand fire while playing Lincoln City. Out of favour in 1985\u201386, McManus spent time out on loan at Middlesbrough (making two appearances) and Peterborough United (making 18 appearances) before leaving permanently to join Tranmere Rovers. He was second choice to Billy O'Rourke in 1986\u201387 making five appearances and later went on to play for non-league Boston United. He was head of youth scouting at Walsall, until he left on 31 October 2008."]}, {"page": "Deaths in January 2002", "response": ["*Billy O'Rourke, 41, English professional footballer, brain haemorrhage."]}, {"page": "1983\u201384 Chester City F.C. season", "response": ["||| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Billy O'Rourke"]}]}}
