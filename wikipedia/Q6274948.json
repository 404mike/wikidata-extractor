By the early nineteenth century, it was no longer exclusively associated with disreputable people, but continued to be applied to usages below the level of standard educated speech. The origin of the word is uncertain, although it appears to be connected with thieves' cant. A Scandinavian origin has been proposed (compare, for example, Norwegian , which means \"nickname\"), but based on \"date and early associations\" is discounted by the Oxford English Dictionary. Jonathon Green, however, agrees with the possibility of a Scandinavian origin, suggesting the same root as that of sling, which means \"to throw\", and noting that slang is thrown language \u2013 a quick and honest way to make your point."]}, {"page": "Jackanory", "response": ["\"Jackanory, jackanory\" said by someone in the sing-song tones of the theme tune indicates that they think that someone else is making up or \"stretching\" a story, i.e. lying.Cassell's Dictionary of Slang.

C. McNeile", "response": ["McNeile had a quiet life after the war; his biographer Jonathon Green notes that \"as in the novels of fellow best-selling writers such as P. G. Wodehouse or Agatha Christie, it is the hero who lives the exciting life\". Although he was an \"unremittingly hearty man\", he suffered from delicate health following the war. He had a loud voice and a louder laugh, and \"liked to enliven clubs and restaurants with the sight and sound of military good fellowship\"; his friend and collaborator Gerard Fairlie described him as \"not everybody's cup of tea\", and commented that \"he was loud in every possible way\u2014in his voice, in his laugh, in his clothes, in the unconscious swagger with which he always motivated himself, in his whole approach to life\". McNeile and his wife had two sons.", "In 1920 McNeile published Bull-Dog Drummond, whose eponymous hero\u2014a member of \"the Breed\"\u2014became his most famous creation. He had first written Drummond as a detective for a short story in The Strand Magazine, but the character was not successful and was changed for the novel, which was a thriller. Captain Hugh \"Bulldog\" Drummond DSO, MC was described in the novel's sub-title as \"a demobilised officer who found peace dull\" after service during the First World War with the fictional Loamshire Regiment. Drummond went on to appear in ten full-length novels by McNeile and a further seven by his friend Gerard Fairlie. The character was an amalgam of Fairlie, himself, and his idea of an English gentleman. Drummond also had roots in the literary characters Sherlock Holmes, Sexton Blake, Richard Hannay and The Scarlet Pimpernel. Drummond was characterised as large, very strong, physically unattractive and an \"apparently brainless hunk of a man\", who was also a gentleman with a private income; he could also be construed as \"a brutalized ex-officer whose thirst for excitement is also an attempt to reenact  the war\". The character was later described by Cecil Day-Lewis, author of rival gentleman detective Nigel Strangeways, as an \"unspeakable public school bully\". Drummond's main adversary across four novels is Carl Peterson, a master criminal with no national allegiance, who is often accompanied by his wife, Irma. Irma is described by Jonathon Green as \"the slinky epitome of a twenties 'vamp, and by Lawrence Treadwell as dark, sexy and from an oriental background, \"a true femme fatale\". After Carl Peterson's death in The Final Count, Irma swears revenge on Drummond and kidnaps his wife\u2014whom he had met in Bull-Dog Drummond\u2014with the intent of killing him in the ensuing chase. Irma Peterson appears in six of McNeile's books, and in a further five by Fairlie."]}, {"page": "Oz (magazine)", "response": ["With access to new print stocks, including metallic foils, new fluorescent inks and the freedom of layout offered by the offset printing system, Sharp's artistic skills came to the fore and Oz quickly won renown as one of the most visually exciting publications of its day.

Another innovation was the cover of Oz No.11, which included a collection of detachable adhesive labels, printed in either red, yellow or green. The all-graphic \"Magic Theatre\" edition (Oz No.16, November 1968), overseen by Sharp and Mora, has been described by British author Jonathon Green as \"arguably the greatest achievement of the entire British underground press.\" During this period Sharp also created the two famous psychedelic album covers for the group Cream, Disraeli Gears and Wheels of Fire.", "At the appeal trial (where the defendants appeared wearing long wigs) it was found that Judge Argyle had grossly misdirected the jury on numerous occasions and the defence also alleged that Berger, who was called as a prosecution witness, had been harassed and assaulted by police.
