He is the fitness coach for Bromley.\nMay began his career at Southampton's youth academy in 1998, before playing at Fulham's centre of excellence for a year. In 2000, he joined Millwall's youth set-up. Ahead of the 2002\u201303 season, May signed his first professional contract with the club, making his debut in August 2002. He was loaned out to Brentford, and then Colchester United, during his six-year tenure at Millwall. In September 2007, May joined Scunthorpe United on a three-month loan agreement, which was made permanent in January 2008. His time at Scunthorpe was plagued with injuries, and he was subsequently released in May 2010.\nMay signed for Stevenage on a free transfer in October 2010, and was part of the squad that earned promotion to League One during the 2010\u201311 season. May joined League Two club Barnet on loan. He was released by Stevenage in May 2012, and subsequently signed for Dover Athletic ahead of the 2012\u201313 season. After a season at Dover, May then joined Ebbsfleet United in June 2013 where spent two years.

We went through the till, paid for it and then the security guard stopped us and said he had been watching on CCTV. We just burst out laughing. Where's Jeremy Beadle then? But he said, 'No, this is serious, the police are on their way.' The police turned up and they were laughing. I said to the security guard, 'Can we not just pay the \u00a32.35?'\" He said, 'No, this is a serious offence.' So the police gave us two options: go to court and fight it out, or pay an on-the-spot fine. We couldn't be bothered going to court so we paid the fine but doing that made us look guilty\"."]}, {"page": "Frank Sinclair", "response": ["He remained a regular during the 2005\u201306 season but more often than not he was asked to play out at right-back rather than his preferred central position, even playing when not fully fit due to the side's injury problems.

With the match goalless going into injury time, Millwall defender Ben May put the ball past Doyle for an own goal to give Leeds a 1\u20130 victory. Doyle was recalled from loan on 19 December to cover for the suspended Nico Vaesen. Doyle was on the bench for Birmingham's League Cup quarter-final against Manchester United the next day, and then returned to Millwall three days later on an emergency seven-day loan. This loan deal was extended for another seven days before Doyle returned to Birmingham on 5 January 2006 after manager Steve Bruce had refused Millwall permission to use him in the FA Cup. A week later, Doyle agreed to go to Millwall for a third loan spell in the 2005\u201306 season, this time staying with The Lions until the end of the season.

Harris's old club Millwall made a loan deal for him on a six-month deal in August 2006, however Harris rejected the offer saying if he were to move it would have to be on a permanent basis, and with Darren Byfield and Ben May set to return from injury for Millwall, Harris believed he would have once again been forced out the side, which was the reason he left The Den in the first instance.

After making five appearances and scoring two goals he was recalled by Scunthorpe on 5 November due to the departure of on-loan Millwall striker Ben May. Despite this, York manager Billy McEwan was interested in bringing McBreen back to the club for another loan spell. He bought out the remainder of his Scunthorpe contract to join St Johnstone of the Scottish First Division on 2 January 2008 on a contract until the end of the season. His debut came the same day in a 1\u20131 home draw with Dundee, which he entered as a 62nd-minute substitute for Liam Craig. He suffered a knee injury during this match, and this hampered his progress at the club. On 20 April, McBreen scored the opening goal with a back-post header from Paul Sheerin's cross in St Johnstone's Scottish Cup semi-final against Rangers at Hampden Park in extra time, which they eventually lost in a penalty shoot-out.

Neither Tomlinson or Martin could find the consistency to secure their first team place though; Tomlinson conceded twelve goals in his first seven games of the season, whilst Martin conceded ten times in his first five games. Assistant manager Mark Grew told the media that \"they've both been disappointing\". On 29 October, Tomlinson was embarrassed to be caught off his line by Oxford United's Peter Leven, who found the net with a 'sensational 45-yard strike'. Adams said \"...in the division, he's the only player who would have scored that... [but] you have to question the keeper's starting position.\" He was still preferred to Martin though, and only a thigh injury kept him out of two league games in January. He returned to the first team, and was heading for a third consecutive clean sheet on 14 February when he committed an \"injury-time howler\" to allow Bradford City a share of the points at Valley Parade. On 10 March he spilled a cross to hand Barnet striker Ben May an easy winner at Vale Park. He vowed to improve his consistency, saying \"I'm a pretty confident person and it will take a lot to stop me bouncing back.\" At the end of the season he rejected the club's offer of a new contract, and his departure was announced on 3 July.

Gillingham equalised in first-half injury time, Cody McDonald scoring from close range. The visitors took the lead just after the interval, Adebayo Akinfenwa, who also scored for Gillingham in the reverse fixture, scored from six yards out following good work by Joe Martin.

Another 2\u20132 draw followed three days later, this time against Accrington Stanley. Stevenage had a two-goal lead courtesy of strikes from Byron Harrison and Lawrie Wilson, but two late Accrington goals meant that the points were shared. Three days after the draw with Accrington, Stevenage travelled to Gigg Lane for their first ever game against Bury. The game ended 3\u20130 to Bury, courtesy of goals from Andy Bishop, ex-Stevenage defender Efe Sodje, and Ryan Lowe.
