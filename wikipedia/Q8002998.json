The next season the selectors tried to keep the nucleus of the Championship winning team together and hopes were high that the Welsh team could repeat the last season's feat and retake the Triple Crown. Blake retook his place in the pack, with the forwards being led by Dick Hellings, but they lacked cohesion in the tight and although beating England at the Cardiff Arms Park, looked ragged at times.Griffiths (1987), pg 4:10. The next game Scotland took advantage of the weaknesses in the forward positions, with Wales caving in towards the end of the match, with the Scottish winning 18-8. Blake played his final international game when Wales hosted Ireland at St. Helen's for the final game of the tournament. Wales were narrow victors, but the selectors chose a new wave of players at the start of 1902, as they had done in 1899, and Blake lost his place to Will Osborne."]}, {"page": "Nathaniel Walters", "response": ["Walters was awarded his one and only international cap while representing his home team of Llanelli.

Walters was one of seven new caps for Wales for the game, including Doctor Teddy Morgan on the wing. Joining Walters in the pack were international debuts for Will Osborne, Will Joseph, Arthur Harding and Dai \"Tarw\" Jones. Adding to the unfamiliarity of the forwards was the fact that of the eight men, only Jehoida Hodges and George Boots played for the same club as each other. Under the captaincy of Gwyn Nicholls, the Welsh were victorious by a single point, thanks to a penalty goal from John Strand-Jones. Despite the win, Walters was the only member of the Welsh pack to lose his place for the next game, being replaced by Harry Jones of Penygraig. Although Walter did not play any further international matches, the Wales team won all three Home Nations matches that season, making Walters a Triple Crown winning player."]}, {"page": "1909\u201310 Northern Rugby Football Union season", "response": ["Hull FC: Harry Taylor, G.
