Chiba claimed he initially did not understand the character when first recording his lines in his debut. The actor grew attached to Jin over the years he voiced him and thus disliked how Jin changed from a kindhearted man to a corrupt person in the later games as well as his transformation into a devil. Jon Foo felt honored to play Jin's character in the live-action film based on the series. He says he is a fan of the Tekken games. Still, he found it difficult to play Jin as he spent three months on a diet in order to do the fighting moves for the live-action film. In the making of the film, Foo accidentally wounded Cung Le. The film's director, Dwight Little, found that this type of accident is common in fighting films.", "In the 2009 live-action film Tekken, Jin is portrayed by Jon Foo. This version of Jin differs significantly. He was not raised by Heihachi, and his mother was killed during a crackdown on insurgents by the Tekken Corporation. He is still the illegitimate son of Kazuya. He enters the Iron Fist tournament to take revenge on Heihachi for his mother's death, but during the tournament, he learns that it was Kazuya who was responsible. He progresses through the tournament, falling in love with Christie Monteiro and forming alliances with Steve Fox, Raven, and Heihachi himself when Kazuya overthrows him. Eventually, Jin makes it to the final, and defeats his father in battle, yet refuses to kill him because of their blood relation.", "Critics have also focused on Jin's appearances in other media. For the first Tekken live-action film, BeyondHollywood thought Jon Foo's appearance might appeal to viewers based on his similarities with Jin. The Fandom Post disliked the love interests presented to Jin as well as his fights in the Iron Fist Tournament. DVD Verdict criticized how Jin was lacking most of his important traits, most notably his Devil Gene and commented that his quest for revenge was not appealing because of his interactions with other supporting characters. DVD Talk agreed, stating that Tekken struggled \"to create a fulfilling hero's journey for Jin as he greets a dead end on his path to revenge\". Although Martial Arts and Action Movies criticized Foo's acting to the point of making Jin emotionless, his fight sequences were praised. Roobla also praised the fight sequences, most notably Jin's fight against Eddie Gordo. For the CGI film, MTV commented that the initial \"games\" between Jin and Kazuya were based on their experimentation with other people. Cheat Code Central felt the conflict between Jin and his father was simply an excuse to produce well-executed fight scenes. PALGNs Bev Chen enjoyed the new devil versions of Jin and Kazuya, comparing them to Go Nagai's series Devilman. Titan's comics of Tekken earned mixed responses because of how the conflict with Jin is handled."]}, {"page": "Tom-Yum-Goong", "response": ["Inspector Vincent initiates a search for Kham and Mark, who are hiding in a Buddhist monastery.
