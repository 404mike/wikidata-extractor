Booth thought that the material would probably cause \"a huge amount of confusion and smoke because the politically correct brigade will jump on it\". Anticipating the publication, Emma Hartley and Vanessa Thorpe in The Observer doubted the literary value of the works, citing Motion's view that the stories were \"little more than mild pornography\" which the mature poet would never have wished to see published. On publication, Booth's collection provoked a particularly hostile reaction from The Guardians critic Jenny Diski, whose review dismissed the Coleman writings as \"drivel\" and \"sad ramblings\", unworthy of publication or critical attention, and not even valid pornography: \"Not a breast, not a clitoris is seen or mentioned.\" Unlike serious pornographers, \"Larkin sketches a mere outline and then walks away with a snigger\". Diski mocks Booth's reverential descriptions of the typescripts \"as though they were slivers of the True Cross\", and concludes: \"Let this be a lesson, at least, to anyone who hasn't got around to chucking out the crap they wrote in their teens and early twenties.\""]}, {"page": "Marie de Gournay", "response": ["* Jenny Diski, \"Apology for the Woman Writing\", Virago Press, 2008  : a work of historical fiction based on the life of Marie de Gournay"]}, {"page": "Friern Hospital", "response": ["*Jenny Diski, an English writer, briefly stayed at the hospital.The London Review of Books, Vol. 36, No. 3, 6 Februari 2014 www.lrb.co.uk.
