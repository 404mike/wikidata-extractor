These fields's tools act as material for her installations, text works and photographs, and for videos in which absurd relationships develop between the performer and the rhetoric of political, commercial and legal discourse. Young's work often develops from the professional cultures she explores. In her installations, she often dons attire appropriate to the business and legal worlds, and enacts scenarios examining and questioning each institution's power to shape society. Young also teaches internationally at art colleges such as the Slade School of Fine Art in London where she is also an Associate Professor in Fine Art.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Manchester Metropolitan University", "response": ["* Carey Young \u2013 artist"]}, {"page": "Beck's Futures", "response": ["The 2003 prize, presented by Wim Wenders, was awarded on 29 April at the Institute of Contemporary Arts.
