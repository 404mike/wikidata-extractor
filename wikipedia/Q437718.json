Born in London, England, he was educated at Dulwich College, London, Queens' College, Cambridge, and later the University of York.\nSome of Swift's books have been filmed, including Waterland (1992), Shuttlecock (1993) and Last Orders (1996). His novel Last Orders was joint-winner of the 1996 James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction and a controversial winner of the 1996 Booker Prize, owing to the many similarities in plot and structure to William Faulkner's As I Lay Dying.\nThe prize-winning Waterland is set in The Fens. A novel of landscape, history and family, it is often cited as one of the outstanding post-war British novels and has been a set text on the English literature syllabus in British schools. Writer Patrick McGrath asked Swift about the \"feeling for magic\" in Waterland during an interview. Swift responded that \"The phrase everybody comes up with is magic realism, which I think has now become a little tired. But on the other hand there\u2019s no doubt that English writers of my generation have been very much influenced by writers from outside who in one way or another have got this magical, surreal quality, such as Borges, M\u00e1rquez, Grass, and that that has been stimulating. I think in general it\u2019s been a good thing. Because we are, as ever, terribly parochial, self-absorbed and isolated, culturally, in this country. It\u2019s about time we began to absorb things from outside.\"Swift was acquainted with Ted Hughes and has himself published poetry, some of which is included in Making an Elephant: Writing from Within (2009)..", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Booker Prize", "response": ["!
