While most commonly known for his pioneering work in electroacoustic music, his early career was that of a hot-jazz violinist in the London dance bands in the Roaring \u201920s, including Ray Starita's Piccadilly Revels. Even then, as a young violinist, his improvised soloing style was amazingly advanced for his era. He played with a remarkably modern chromatic style, verging on atonal, often incorporating multi-stops (playing up to four notes in harmony on the violin simultaneously utilizing multiple fingers).\nIn 1939, he emigrated to the US. He was the first composer to systematically utilize electro-acoustic sound potential within the television medium, particularly with his invention of the sound logo and the Musical Rorschach test.\nHis now-legendary Maxwell House \"Percolator\" TV commercial was one of these first innovations. He also commissioned Robert Moog to create the first percussion synthesizer, which he used extensively in his television work. Among his other contributions to the use of electro-acoustic music in television were numerous station IDs and commercials, including that of the National Educational Television network (the forerunner to PBS), the 1966 CBS \"in color\" bumper, the news sounder for the ABC Radio Networks, and the 1965\u20131976 Screen Gems/Columbia Pictures Television logos.\nThroughout his life, Siday was also an educator, creating many radio broadcasts about the nature of the so-called new music and new sound. In addition to his large commercial repertoire, he composed a number of extended works, both traditional and experimental. In the years before his death, he devoted considerable effort to exploring new ways in which to use electro-acoustic music in the building of special sound environments. Use of new music through practical design concepts was his forte.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Moog synthesizer players", "response": ["*Eric Siday first user in the sixties, used early modulars"]}, {"page": "The Space Museum", "response": ["Mervyn Pinfield was assigned to direct the serial in January 1965. The production crew hoped that The Space Museum could be made cheaply to offset more expensive serials like The Web Planet (1965), doing so with a small cast and few sets, and using Pinfield's technical experience to achieve visual effects without need for excessive filming. To save on cost, Pinfield used stock music recordings for the incidental score, including pieces from Trevor Duncan, Erik Nordgren, and Eric Siday. The sound effects provided by the BBC Radiophonic Workshop originated from previous recordings. The Dalek prop used in the first two episodes was one of those constructed for the first Dalek serial, The Daleks (1963\u20131964), while the one used at the end of the final episode had modified shoulder slats by Shawcraft Models. Several other set elements were borrowed from previous serials, such as the lecterns from The Sensorites (1964). The dummies in the third episode wore stock spacesuits from Quatermass II (1955). The visuals of the ray guns firing was achieved using a photographic flash."]}, {"page": "Moog synthesizer", "response": ["In 1964, Moog and Deutsch demonstrated the synthesizer at the electronic music studio at the University of Toronto. After the presentation impressed the composers, Moog was invited by the Audio Engineering Society to present at their annual convention in New York that October. Though he had not planned to sell synthesizers there, some customers placed orders at the show. The choreographer Alwin Nikolais became the first person to purchase a commercially made Moog synthesizer. Moog constructed synthesizers to order. The first order for a complete Moog synthesizer, for which Moog had to design a keyboard and cabinet, came from composer Eric Siday. With no Moog books and no way to save or share settings, early users had to learn how to use the synthesizer themselves, by word of mouth, or from seminars held by Moog and Deutsch."]}, {"page": "Hugo Rignold", "response": ["In the 1920s and 1930s, Rignold played violin with many jazz and dance bands of the day, including those of Mantovani, Jack Hylton, Jack Harris, Fred Hartley, Ambrose, Lew Stone and Jay Wilbur. Rignold was highly regarded as a jazz player.  In 1936 The Gramophone magazine said of him, \"With the possible exception of the Negro artist, Eddie South, and our own Eric Siday, who is abroad, there have been only two violinists who have hitherto meant anything to jazz \u2013 Venuti, of course, and more recently the French musician Stephane Grappelly (sic).
