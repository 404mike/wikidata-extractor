An English emigrant to Africa, John F. Carrington, in his 1949 book The Talking Drums of Africa, explained how African drummers were able to communicate complex messages over vast distances.Carrington, J. F. (1949), The Talking Drums of Africa, Carey Kingsgate Press. Using low tones referred to as male and higher female tones, the drummer communicates through the phrases and pauses, which can travel upwards of 4\u20135 miles. The process may take eight times longer than communicating a normal sentence but was effective for telling neighboring villages of possible attacks or ceremonies. He found that to each short word that was beaten on the drums, an extra phrase was added, which would be redundant in speech but provided context to the core drum signal."]}, {"page": "Kele people (Congo)", "response": ["The Kele were known for their drum language, described by the English missionary John F.
