He then won a move to the Scottish Premier League with Inverness Caledonian Thistle in 2005. In almost three years in the Scottish Highlands, Morgan made 31 appearances, scoring just 4 goals. After falling out of favour, Morgan was shipped off to Ross County at the tail end of the 2006\u201307 season, where he made 5 appearances, and failing to score any goals.\nHe was released by Inverness in December 2007, before being quickly snapped up by injury-hit Kilmarnock. He debuted for Kilmarnock in their 1\u20130 home defeat to Falkirk on 2 January, a match that many felt should have been postponed due to the death of Motherwell captain Phil O'Donnell the previous weekend.\nHe joined St Johnstone on a six-month loan on 26 August 2008, and returned to Kilmarnock at the end of that deal. After being released from his Kilmarnock contract, Morgan signed for Stenhousemuir in February 2009.\nAfter leaving Stenhousemuir, Morgan signed for local amateur team Musselburgh where he played out the season making 24 appearances and scoring 6 goals. Following his departure from Musselburgh, he went on to play for Ormiston and Haddington Athletic.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alan Morgan", "response": ["*Alan Morgan (footballer, born 1973), Welsh football player", "*Alan Morgan (footballer, born 1983), Scottish football player", "*Alan Morgan (sailor) (1909\u20131984), American sailor", "*Alan Morgan (bishop) (1940\u20132011), bishop of Sherwood"]}, {"page": "Alan Morgan (footballer born 1983)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alan Morgan (footballer, born 1983)"]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 Kilmarnock F.C. season", "response": ["| Alan Morgan"]}, {"page": "2007\u201308 Kilmarnock F.C. season", "response": ["|  Alan Morgan"]}]}}
