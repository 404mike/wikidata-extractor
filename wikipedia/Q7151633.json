Torquay started the first leg poorly and were fortunate when Tim Sills scored just before half-time but Exeter City levelled when Wayne Carlisle equalised. Just when the game looked like a draw Chris Zebroski pounced on a poor clearance by Paul Jones to make the final score 2\u20131 to United. Torquay knew going into the second leg that if they scored one goal Exeter City would need two goals to force extra time, and when Kevin Hill scored in the second half in his record-equalling appearance, the match seemed all over. However, Exeter City scored four goals in the space of 18 minutes, dumping Torquay out of the play-offs and ensuring they would have to spend another season in non-league football."]}, {"page": "Paul Jones", "response": ["Paul Jones may refer to:", "*Paul Jones (footballer, born 1953), former Bolton Wanderers defender", "*Paul Jones (footballer, born 1965), English former footballer for Walsall and Wolverhampton Wanderers", "*Paul Jones (footballer, born 1967), Wales international goalkeeper", "*Paul Jones (footballer, born 1974), former Birmingham City winger", "*Paul Jones (footballer, born 1976), former Wrexham defender", "*Paul Jones (footballer, born 1978), former Oldham Athletic defender", "*Paul Jones (footballer, born 1986), goalkeeper, currently with King's Lynn Town", "*Paul Jones (basketball) (born 1989), American basketball player", "*Paul Jones (boxer) (born 1966), British former professional boxer", "*Paul Jones (mixed martial artist) (born 1963), former mixed martial artist", "*Paul Jones (wrestler) (1942-2018), retired professional wrestler and manager", "*Paul Jones (American football) (born 1992), American football quarterback", "*Paul Jones (sportscaster), radio play-by-play man for the Toronto Raptors", "*Paul Jones (Australian politician) (1878\u20131972), Australian politician", "*Paul Jones (Navajo Chairman) (1895\u20131971), chairman of Navajo Tribal Council", "*Paul Jones (judge) (1880\u20131965), U.S. federal judge", "*Paul Jones (film producer) (1901\u20131968), film producer", "*Paul Jones (singer) (born 1942), BBC Radio 2 DJ and singer in Manfred Mann", "*Paul Jones (1889) English adaptation of Surcouf (op\u00e9ra comique)", "*Lynching of Paul Jones, 1919", "*Paul Jones (bishop) (1880\u20131941), American Episcopal bishop", "*Paul Jones (computer technologist) (born 1950), American computer technologist", "*Paul Jones (horse) (1917\u20131930), American thoroughbred racehorse and winner of 1920 Kentucky Derby", "*The Paul Jones, a mixer dance", "*Paul Jones (1843 ship), a Medford-built ship that brought the first cargo of ice to China", "*John Paul Jones (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "Bobby Olejnik", "response": ["On 18 June 2012, Olejnik signed a three-year contract with Championship side Peterborough United for an undisclosed fee.
