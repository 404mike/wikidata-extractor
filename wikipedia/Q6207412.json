He played as a half back.\nMorgan was born in Penicuik, Midlothian. He began his football career with Edinburgh Emmett and then came to England to sign for Birmingham of the First Division in August 1924. He played only once for Birmingham, deputising for the injured Jimmy Cringan and his regular understudy Bill Hunter at centre half in a 4\u20130 defeat at Sunderland on 6 September 1924. After a brief spell in non-league football with Redditch Town he settled at Doncaster Rovers, where he played 150 Third Division North games in four seasons. After one Second Division game in one-and-a-half seasons for Bristol City, a return to the Third with Barrow offered more playing time. Short spells with Walsall and Southport and a venture to Ireland with Brideville preceded a return to non-league football in the English Midlands with Worcester City and Atherstone Town.Morgan died in 1983 aged 93 or 94.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Morgan", "response": ["*Jock Morgan (1889\u20131983), Scottish footballer"]}]}}
