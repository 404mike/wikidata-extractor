One of the first modern historians to deal with Richard II as a king and as a person was Bishop Stubbs. Stubbs argued that towards the end of his reign, Richard's mind \"was losing its balance altogether\". Historian Anthony Steel, who wrote a full-scale biography of the king in 1941, took a psychiatric approach to the issue, and concluded that Richard had schizophrenia.Steel (1941), p. 8. This was challenged by V. H. Galbraith, who argued that there was no historical basis for such a diagnosis, a line that has also been followed by later historians of the period, such as Anthony Goodman and Anthony Tuck. Nigel Saul, who wrote the most recent academic biography on Richard II, concedes thateven though there is no basis for assuming the king had a mental illnesshe showed clear signs of a narcissistic personality, and towards the end of his reign \"Richard's grasp on reality was becoming weaker\".Saul (1997), pp. 460\u20134."]}, {"page": "House of Lancaster", "response": ["According to historian Robin Storey, \"If Henry's insanity was a tragedy; his recovery was a national disaster\". When Henry's sanity returned, the court party reasserted its authority but York and his relatives, the Nevilles, defeated them at the First Battle of St Albans. Historian Anthony Goodman suggests that around 50 men were killed; among them were Somerset and two Percy lords, Henry Percy, 2nd Earl of Northumberland, and Thomas Clifford, 8th Baron de Clifford, creating feuds that would confound reconciliation attempts despite the shock to the ruling class caused by the armed conflict.. Threatened with treason charges and lacking support, York, Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury, and Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, fled abroad. Henry was captured by the opposition when the Nevilles returned and won the Battle of Northampton.. York joined them, surprising parliament by claiming the throne and then forcing through the Act of Accord stating that Henry would remain as monarch for his lifetime and that York would succeed him. The disinheriting of Henry's son Edward was unacceptable to Margaret so the conflict continued. York was killed at the Battle of Wakefield and his head was displayed at Micklegate Bar, York, along with those of Edmund, Earl of Rutland, and Richard Neville, Earl of Salisburyboth of whom were captured and beheaded."]}, {"page": "Battle of Blore Heath", "response": ["The Yorkist force based at Middleham Castle in Yorkshire (led by the Earl of Salisbury) needed to link up with the main Yorkist army at Ludlow Castle in Shropshire.

This resistance troubled Clifford throughout his career. During the Yorkist rebellion of 1487, which attempted to place Lambert Simnel on the throne (as a pretender for EdwardIV's second son, Richard of Shrewsbury) Clifford was responsible for guarding the city. He reinforced the garrison with 200 of his men at arms; when the rebel army passed close by, Clifford followed it to Braham. He attempted to engage it on 10 June, but was beaten off. He camped in Tadcaster overnight, where word was brought to him that a small force of rebels, led by Lords Scrope of Masham and of Bolton had launched an assault on Bootham Bar. This forced Clifford to withdraw back to York and face the rebels on 13 June. The subsequent encounter was not an unqualified success, notes Summerson; Clifford was defeated in a scuffle outside the gates, and lost all his baggage. The military historian Philip A. Haigh writes that Clifford was \"utterly disgraced\" and R. W. Hoyle describes his efforts as a \"fiasco\". The city scribes \"laconically recorded the disastrous outcome\", writes Anthony Goodman, and emphasised how the King's man in the north \"had signally failed\" to contain the rising."]}, {"page": "Second Battle of St Albans", "response": ["Although strong, Warwick's lines faced north only. Margaret knew of Warwick's dispositions, probably through Sir Henry Lovelace, the steward of Warwick's own household.

Late on 16 February, Margaret's army swerved sharply west and captured the town of Dunstable. About 200 local people under the town butcher tried to resist them, but were easily dispersed.

Edward duly did so, to Thomas, Lord Stanley in November 1461, but James and his brother Sir Robert, in attempt to keep the inheritance for the family, effectively disallowed the King's grant and imprisoned (or, kept in custody) the two girls, as Anthony Goodman noted, \"contrary to their will, in divers places.\" Along with the girls, Sir James also seized Hornby castle, Lonsdale, which was the chief residence contained in the inheritance,Ross, C., Edward IV, London 1975, p. 408 but which also included Brierley, and some manors originally granted him by his father's feoffees, including George Neville, in 1463.Goodman, A., The Wars of the Roses, New York 1981, p. 98 The dispute was more complicated than merely theft and kidnapping. Harrington claimed that, in law, his father's estates were held in tail male, in which case they could only be passed through the male line and the actions of Sir Thomas's feoffees would be illegal, and the inheritance remain with him; Stanley, however, claimed them to be held in fee simple, viz through the female line as well.Pollard, A.J., North Eastern England During the Wars of the Roses: : Lay Society, War, and Politics 1450\u20131500, Oxford 1990, p. 325 In October 1466, Stanley obtained a grant to sue in the King's Court, but the matter was not dealt with until 1468, when a commission found against HarringtonRosemary Horrox, 'Harrington family (per. c.1300\u20131512)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 28 October 2013 and he and his brother were committed- \"temporarily\", Ross noted- to the Fleet Prison.Ross, C., Edward IV, London 1975, p. 408"]}, {"page": "2016 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Anthony Goodman, 80, historian."]}, {"page": "Scott L.

K., 'Yorkshire Justices of the Peace', English Historical Review 108 (1993), 287. On the other hand, he might, as John of Gaunt did in the later fourteenth century, recruit people into his affinity regardless of their social weight, as an expression of his \"courtly and chivalric ambitions\", as Anthony Goodman said.Goodman, A., 'John of Gaunt: Paradigm of the Late Fourteenth-Century Crisis', Transactions of the Royal Historical Society 37 (1987), 146\u201348. A contemporary described these as \"kin, friendis, allys and parttakaris\" (\"kin, friends, allies, and partakers\") to the lord.Wormald, J., Lords and Men in Scotland: Bonds of Manrent, 1442\u20131603 (Edinburgh, 1985), 76ff.

The members of the affinity closest to the lord were those of most use: the estate officials, treasurer, stewards, and often more than one lawyer."]}, {"page": "English invasion of Scotland (1385)", "response": ["The latest truce with Scotland was due to expire on 15 July 1385, and the fact that the English muster was due to take place on the 14th indicates that the plan was to invade immediately it had done so. Richard II was nearly eighteen, and the campaign was clearly intended to cast him\u2014as a would-be conqueror of Scotland\u2014in the same light as his father and grandfather. According to a modern commentator, it was, in contemporaries' eyes, \"not just what a king would do but also what a man would do\". He had, after all, been groomed from birth to follow in his father's footsteps, and this expedition was the point at which he demonstrated his royal independence. Anthony Goodman has suggested that apart from the obvious strategic necessity of the campaign, it had a secondary purpose in increasing Richard's military prestige and political profile, and indeed, says Sumption, \"the presence of the English King...proved to be a powerful recruiting agent\".", "The army that Richard led to Scotland was a large one. Apart from the King and Gaunt, most of the senior English nobility took part. The Earls of Buckingham and Nottingham commanded the army's vanguard with Gaunt. Arundel and Warwick, under the King, commanded the central battle. Accompanying Gaunt\u2014but with his own retinue\u2014was his son, Henry, Earl of Derby. Assessing the numbers involved, Anthony Goodman suggests that Buckingham had brought 400 men-at-arms and twice that number of archers. Arundel and Nottingham, he says, brought, between them, nearly 200 men-at-arms and 300 archers, while the Earl of Warwick had around 120 of the former and 160 of the latter. Sir Henry Percy, son of the Earl of Northumberland, brought sixty men-at-arms and the same number of archers. De Vere too, brought a \"substantial\" force. But their combined total of nearly 2,000 men was still massively outnumbered by John of Gaunt's force, which was in the region of 3,000 men. Richard did not solely call upon his nobility either. Gillespie has pointed out that about 10% of the entire host\u2014around 450 men-at-arms and 500 archers\u2014were under the direct command, not of barons, but of the king's officers. These were of the civil service (\"the chancellor, treasurer, keeper of the privy seal\") or household (\"secretary, steward of the household, under-chamberlain of the household, and controller of the wardrobe\"). Also included in the royal army were members of the Queen's Household (for example, Henry Burzebo and Henry Hask of Bohemia), as well as Spaniards and Welshmen. The army that crossed the Scottish border on 6 August 1385 bore 38 royal standards and over 90 bearing the arms of St. George's, and the flag of St Cuthbert was borne before it. Ultimately, Richard led an army of about 14,000 men from nearly every peer of England, with over two-thirds of them being archers."]}]}}
