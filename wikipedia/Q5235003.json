He served with the English Wesleyan Methodist Society. In Shanxi Province, he was instrumental in the conversion of the Confucian scholar Hsi to Christianity.\nFrom Days of Blessing in Inland China is the report provided orally at two meetings by Hsi (now known as Pastor Hsi) on his first meeting with Rev David Hill:\n\nSome time after this, in the time of the great famine, an Englishman of the name of Li (Rev. David Hill, of the Wesleyan Mission, Wu-ch\u2019ang), came to help us in our extremity. When he had been here some time distributing food and money, he offered a prize of 30 taels (\u00a37 10s.) for the best essay on given Christian subjects. The competitors had books supplied from which to read the subject up, and my essay gained the prize. The next thing was to get the money. I had heard many reports that foreigners could bewitch people, and I feared to fall under their influence. However, I went to P\u2019ing-yang Fu with my brother, and stopped in an inn. My brother volunteered to go for me to get the money, but he came back saying the foreigner wanted to see the very man who had written the essay. Well, I was in a dilemma! On the one hand I feared bewitchment, on the other hand I feared to lose the 30 taels. At last I decided to go. On inquiring at the door, I met Mr. Sung and two men of the name of Li, all there of them natives. Addressing them, I said, \u201cMay I ask what you do here?\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d said they, \u201cwe are helping the foreigner.\u201d \u201cAnd don\u2019t you fear being bewitched?\u201d \u201cNo, indeed,\u201d they replied, \u201cnor would you if you knew him.\u201d Mr. Sung then obtained an interview for me with Mr. Hill. One glance, one word, it was enough! As stars fade before the rising sun, so did his presence dissipate the idle rumors I had heard; all trace of my fear was gone, my mind was at rest. I beheld his kindly eye and remembered the words of Mencius, \u201cIf a man\u2019s heart is not right his eyes bespeak it.\u201d I realized I was in the present of a true man.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "David Hill", "response": ["David Hill may refer to:", "* David Hill (Oregon politician) (1809\u20131850), American politician, founder of the city of Hillsboro, Oregon", "* David Hill (cricketer) (1915\u20131974), Guyanese cricketer", "* David Hill (Rangers footballer) (fl. 1881\u20131882), Scottish international football player (Rangers and Scotland)", "* David Hill (footballer, born 1881) (1881\u20131928), Scottish international football player (Third Lanark and Scotland)", "* David Hill (footballer, born 1965), English footballer for Bradford City", "* David Hill (rugby league) (active 1967\u201378), British rugby league player (Wigan and Great Britain)", "* David Hill (tight end) (born 1954), American football player (Detroit Lions)", "* David Hill (wide receiver) (born 1977), American football player", "* David Hill (rugby union) (born 1978), New Zealand rugby union player", "* David Hill (swimmer), British Paralympic swimmer", "* David Hill (missionary) (1840\u20131896), Wesleyan Methodist missionary to China", "* David Hill (Mohawk) (1745\u20131790), Mohawk chief", "* David Hill (author) (born 1942), New Zealand author of fiction", "* David Hill (businessman) (born 1946), Australian businessman", "* David Hill (producer), American executive producer of television, mainly with the Fox organization", "* David Hill (choral director) (born 1957), British choral conductor and organist", "* David Hill (musician and businessman) (active 1994 and after), former member of the band Ballistic Brothers and founder of Nuphonic record label", "* David Hill (Labour adviser), British political adviser", "* David Hess (AKA David Hill, 1936\u20132011), American actor, singer, and songwriter", "* Colonel Guy Johnson and Karonghyontye (Captain David Hill), a 1776 portrait by Benjamin West", "* David Hill memorial school, a school for blind girls in Hankou, China (1883\u20131911)"]}, {"page": "Xi Shengmo", "response": ["David Hill, an English Methodist missionary, was instrumental in introducing Xi to Christianity.

David Hill, was a prominent feature in the Mission at Hankow, and this Society was also trying the experiment of giving to some of its missionaries a medical training, that they might combine preaching and healing gifts in their labors. Reverend Doctors Charles Wenyon and Roderick McDonald were chief among these medical missionaries in taking up this call. In 1884 it resolved to open a college or high school in connection with their Central Mission, and the Rev. W. T. A. Barber, M.A., was appointed principal, and arrived at Hankow early in 1885. The object of the institution was to provide a liberal Western education for the sons of official and other wealthy Chinese. Attempts to purchase land for the erection of a suitable building were unsuccessful, but in 1887 a large house was rented in the main street of Wuchang, and the work begun. A ladies auxiliary society also sent out female workers.
