Most of these players would become regular starters for the club and Jones, Brown, Scott, Gilchrist, McInally and Denton were destined for international honours. Domestically the season was not a success, with only 6 league wins out of 22 games, but the 2011\u201312 Heineken Cup campaign proved to be the most successful in the club's history when it topped Pool 2, including a remarkable home victory against Racing M\u00e9tro by 48\u201347 and setting up a quarter final against French rugby giants Toulouse by scoring four tries against London Irish. The game against Toulouse in April 2012, was played before a new club record crowd of 38,887 and was closely contested, with Edinburgh holding out for a 19\u201314 win thanks to an early try from Mike Blair and penalties from captain Greig Laidlaw, setting up a semi-final in Dublin against Ulster.

Scotland dominated the game until a surprising fight-back by Italy in the last 10 minutes saw the Azzurri score three times to set up a tense finish. A close-fought but chaotic loss to Ireland by 13-22 came the following week, with further losses to France (10-27) and eventual Grand Slam winners Wales (11-18) in the ensuing rounds. In the last game of the competition, Scotland faced England at home in Twickenham. The first half was almost entirely one-sided, with England racing out to a 31-0 lead in the first 30 minutes, until Stuart McInally scored a breakaway try off a charge-down from English captain Owen Farrell. The second half witnessed a stunning comeback by the Scots, with a flurry of tries to Darcy Graham, Magnus Bradbury, Finn Russell and Sam Johnson putting Scotland into the lead by 38-31 with 4 minutes to go before a last-gasp try to replacement English fly-half George Ford, who then converted to level the final score at 38-38. The drawn result allowed Scotland to retain the Calcutta Cup, and was both the highest-scoring draw and the highest-scoring comeback of any rugby match on record."]}, {"page": "List of Rugby World Cup try scorers", "response": ["*Stuart McInally"]}, {"page": "Scotland at the 2010 Commonwealth Games", "response": ["Lee Jones, Stuart McInally, Scott Newlands, Hefin O'Hare, Colin Shaw, Andrew Turnbull"]}, {"page": "List of Scotland national rugby union players", "response": ["|1068||McInallyStuart McInally||style=\"text-align:center; background:#ccffcc;\"|||2015-08-22|| v Italy at Stadio Olimpico di Torino"]}, {"page": "2010 end-of-year rugby union internationals", "response": ["|N8 ||8 ||Stuart McInally"]}, {"page": "Russia at the Rugby World Cup", "response": ["|HK ||16||Stuart McInally || || "]}, {"page": "Grant Gilchrist", "response": ["Initially an Elite Development player at Edinburgh and following a stint in New Zealand as part of the John Macphail Scholarship, he made his first senior appearance in a 34\u201313 win over Cardiff Blues in September 2011.
