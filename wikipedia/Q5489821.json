Around the room are dotted reminders of her \"kept\" status and her wasted life: the cat beneath the table toying with a bird; the clock concealed under glass; a tapestry which hangs unfinished on the piano; the threads which lie unravelled on the floor; the print of Frank Stone's Cross Purposes on the wall; Edward Lear's musical arrangement of Alfred, Lord Tennyson's 1847 poem \"Tears, Idle Tears\" which lies discarded on the floor, and the music on the piano, Thomas Moore's \"Oft in the Stilly Night\", the words of which speak of missed opportunities and sad memories of a happier past. The discarded glove and top hat thrown on the table top suggest a hurried assignation."]}, {"page": "Desperate Romantics", "response": ["* Phil Davis as Frank Stone"]}, {"page": "Tavistock House", "response": ["His tenancy of No. 1 Devonshire Terrace having expired in the autumn of 1851, Charles Dickens obtained the lease on Tavistock House from his friend and fellow Shakespeare Society member, the artist Frank Stone.
