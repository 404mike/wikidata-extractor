The new company did not have the facilities to build the Gull, so the prototype was produced by the British Aircraft Company of Maidstone, Kent, and the first 24 production machines were manufactured by Parnall Aircraft of Yate, Gloucestershire. In 1934, the Percival Aircraft Company moved to Gravesend Airport, Kent, where it built its own Gulls.Grey 1972, pp. 64c\u201365c.Jackson 1974, pp. 93\u201396, 511\u2013512.", "** D.30 \u2013 D.2 Gull Four airworthy with Donald McGregor Johnston of Bahrs Scrub, Queensland.

The Schlesinger African Air Race was a race from England to South Africa (6,154\u00a0miles), but G-AEKL was withdrawn ten days before the Schlesinger following a fatal taxiing accident at Liverpool Speke Airport. Two other E2H Mew Gulls were entered, both of which had been built at the same time to the same specification as the modified KL. Both failed to finish the race to South Africa. In the 1937 King's Cup Race, the rebuilt and re-painted G-AEKL was 1st with Charles Gardner at the controls in his house-colours of dark blue with pale-blue lettering and trim (See Flight of the Mew Gull, p91.). He averaged 234\u00a0mph over the 1,442-mile course.

Henshaw's win set a class record which, as of 2020, still stands. Edgar Percival flew a third Mew Gull, the E3H (G-AFAA) and finished 6th. Percival might easily have won, but as well as being made scratch-man by the Handicappers, he left the fine-tuning of his airscrew pitches until just before the race and his ground-crew were still tinkering with them as Alex Henshaw took off. At this time the Bracket-Type airscrew simply did not have the pitch-range to cope with the exceptionally wide speed range of the E3H (59\u2013265\u00a0mph). An optimisation for either cruise or takeoff and climb would inevitably compromise the other.", "The E.2H.

Sold and re-engined with a Gipsy Six Series II, G-AEKL was entered in the Schlesinger Race along withZS-AHM and ZS-AHO. However, the aircraft was damaged in a fatal accident at Liverpool Speke Airport that autumn, Tom Campbell Black being killed.  Rebuilt in 1937, G-AEKL won the Newcastle Race for its new owner. G-AEKL was rebuilt twice, was fitted with three different engines and had a total of six paint schemes. Subsequently, the aircraft passed through several hands before being destroyed by German bombs at Lympne early in the war.", "The one-off Type E.3H (the so-called \"Super\"-Mew ) was Edgar Percival's personal mount. While looking very much the same as the E2H, this was actually a completely new design, powered by a Gipsy Six Series II. It first flew in 1937 and was raced by Percival in 1937\u20131939. On loan for propeller trials at Hatfield during the war, G-AFAA was written off in a landing accident by a de Havilland pilot.

The backup Gipsy Moth with Robertson and Bennett aboard began a search and discovered the missing aircraft bogged on the edge of the salt lake.  The rescue crew were guided to a safe landing place by signals from the men on the ground, and they needed to remain overnight as all four men were required to manoeuvre the bogged aircraft to firm ground.  This was done the next day, and both aircraft returned safely to base.Sydney Morning Herald 11 July 1933 As flights were completed, the main base was moved to Roy Hill then Fitzroy Crossing, enabling a larger area of Western Australia to be surveyed.
