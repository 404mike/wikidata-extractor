This doomed his attempt to re-enter the feature-film market with Hypnotized (starring blackface comedians Moran and Mack, \"The Two Black Crows\"). However, Sennett enjoyed great success with short comedies starring Bing Crosby, which were more than likely instrumental in Sennett's product being picked up by a major studio, Paramount Pictures. W. C. Fields conceived and starred in four famous Sennett-Paramount comedies. Fields himself recalled that he \"made seven comedies for the Irishman\", his original deal called for one film and an option for six more, but ultimately only four were made with Fields as star.
