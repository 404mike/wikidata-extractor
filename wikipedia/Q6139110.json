Alongside Winston Churchill, he stood as a Conservative Party candidate in the double Oldham by-election of 1899.\nHe was born in Preston, Lancashire, to cotton spinner James Mawdsley and his wife, Jane.From the age of 9, the young James worked in a cotton mill as a \"half-timer\" (he spent half the working day in the mill and half at school). By the age of 16, he was working full-time.\nIn 1871, Mawdsley married Ann Wright, and they had seven children together. In 1878, he became the General Secretary of the Amalgamated Association of Operative Cotton Spinners. At the time, cotton spinners were considered an elite group by other union factions. Shortly after his appointment he led the operatives in south east Lancashire in a strike against a 20% reduction in wages, securing 5% of this back in early 1880. In 1885 south east Lancashire employers sought a 10% reduction in wages. Again compromise was reached and a 5% reduction imposed.In 1886, the Association worked with the Amalgamated Association of Card and Blowing Room Operatives and the Northern Counties Weavers Amalgamation to form the United Textile Factory Workers Association; the collaboration was brought about because the unions desired to promote legislation. Mawdsley became General Secretary. Under his leadership, the UTFWA was regarded as a sober and moderate union, which was opposed to socialism.Through much of the 1880s and 1890s, Mawdsley sat on the Trades Union Congress (TUC)'s parliamentary committee and was chairman of the TUC in 1885. Mawdsley was politically active; in line with most other cotton workers but against the majority of trade unionists, Mawdsley was a supporter of the Conservative Party.\nIn 1895 there was a nascent plan for Mawdsley to stand for Parliament as a Conservative, in conjunction with David Holmes of the Weavers' union as a Liberal, both being regarded as Labour representatives.In 1899, a double by-election was held in Oldham. Mawdsley was chosen as a candidate, alongside future British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill. Mawdsley was unusual as a Conservative Party candidate, who was also heavily involved in trade unions. He was also one of the first trade unionists to be associated with.Mawdsley died in 1902 at Taunton, Ashton-under-Lyne from complications following an accident. His injuries were sustained by sitting in a china bath and breaking it.He was buried at Christ Church, Ashton-under-Lyne.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Walter Runciman, 1st Viscount Runciman of Doxford", "response": ["Runciman unsuccessfully contested Gravesend in a by-election in 1898, but was elected as a member of parliament (MP) in a two-member by-election for Oldham in 1899, defeating the Conservative candidates, James Mawdsley and Winston Churchill.
