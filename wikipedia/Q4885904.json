Indeed, there have been only a few significant English speaking productions. Little is known, for example, about Harley Granville-Barker's 1904 production at the Court Theatre, F.R. Benson's 1910 production at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, Robert Atkins' 1923 production at the Apollo Theatre, or Ben Iden Payne's 1938 production at Stratford-upon-Avon. The earliest production about which we have significant information is Michael Langham's 1957 production at The Old Vic, starring Richard Gale as Valentine, Keith Michell as Proteus, Barbara Jefford as Julia and Ingrid Hafner as Silvia. In this production, set in late nineteenth-century Italy and grounded very much in high Romanticism, Proteus threatens to kill himself with a pistol at the end of the play, prompting Valentine's hasty offer of Silvia."]}, {"page": "Edward Carpenter", "response": ["Carpenter included among his friends the scholar, author, naturalist, and founder of the Humanitarian League, Henry S.

The plays produced included classics such as Euripides and Shakespeare, and she introduced works by contemporary playwrights such as Ibsen and Shaw.  She also encouraged local writers who formed what was known as the Manchester School of dramatists, the leading members of which were Harold Brighouse, Stanley Houghton and Allan Monkhouse. The Gaiety company undertook tours of America and Canada in 1912 and 1913.  Annie became a well-known public figure in Manchester, lecturing on subjects which included women's suffrage and her views about the theatre.  In 1910 she was awarded the honorary degree of MA by Manchester University.  During the First World War the Gaiety continued to stage plays but financial difficulties led to the disbandment of the permanent company in 1917, following which productions in the theatre were by visiting companies.  In 1921 Annie sold the theatre to a cinema company."]}, {"page": "Every Man in His Humour", "response": ["Ben Iden Payne produced the play in Manchester in 1909, and again in Stratford for the Jonson tercentenary in 1937.

This was performed in 1909 at Annie Horniman's Gaiety Theatre in Manchester and produced by Ben Iden Payne.  Horniman and Payne gave strong support to Brighouse in the early stages of his career.  Many of his plays were one-act pieces; three of the best of these (The Northerners, Zack and The Game) were published together as Three Lancashire Plays in 1920.  All of these plays were set in Lancashire but Brighouse also wrote plays of a different type, such as The Oak Settle and Maid of France.  His most successful play was Hobson's Choice, first produced in 1915 in New York where Payne was working.  It was first produced in England in 1916 at the Apollo Theatre, London, where it ran for 246 performances.  The play was made into a film, directed by David Lean, in 1953, and it was produced at the National Theatre at the Old Vic, London, in 1964.

In 1927, H.K. Ayliff directed a modern dress production at the Garrick Theatre in New York, with Mary Ellis and Basil Sydney. At the time, modern dress productions were still rare enough to elicit a great deal of attention, and the production ran for 175 performances, a record for the theatre at the time.  The production was remounted in England in 1928, first at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre, and subsequently at the Royal Court Theatre, starring Eileen Beldon and Scott Sunderland. In this production, the Induction was kept, with Sly moving from the front of the stage to one of the boxes after the first act. Barry Jackson, who co-directed the Birmingham performances, was initially keen to use the epilogue from A Shrew, but he ultimately decided against it \"because the actual words in the old edition are so corrupt as to be illiterate.\" In a 1935 production starring Catherine Lacey and Neil Porter, director Ben Iden Payne became the first to use the A Shrew epilogue in a performance of The Shrew at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, with Roy Byford initially playing Sly, followed by Jay Laurier. Both actors received excellent reviews for their performances."]}, {"page": "Josephine Victor", "response": ["On Broadway she debuted in The Secret Orchard by Channing Pollock (1908), and appeared in Temperamental Journey (1913),\"Beauty\" Omaha Daily Bee (October 27, 1913): 9. via Newspapers.com The Yellow Ticket (1914),\"Shift in 'The Yellow Ticket'\" The Sun (June 9, 1914): 9. via Newspapers.com The Bargain by Hermann Georg Scheffauer (1915),Louis V.
