His family were from the Llanfihangel-yng-Ngwynfa area of Montgomeryshire. Having received some education in one of \"Madam\" Bridget Bevan's schools, he decided to set up his own school at Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant. Whilst attending a local Methodist church he heard of missionary positions in Tahiti, and volunteered to join the work. He and his wife left for the island in May 1800, and remained there for the next 55 years. Davies became superintendent of a school at Papara, established by the London Missionary Society. He also encouraged the setting up of mission schools in Fiji.His published written works include a dictionary and grammar of the Tahitian language, a translation of substantial portions of the New Testament and Psalms, Brown's Catechism, the Westminster Catechism, the Pilgrim's Progress, and a number of smaller works. He also wrote a History of the Tahitian Mission, 1799-1830 (Cambridge, 1962).\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tahitian language", "response": ["When Europeans first arrived in Tahiti at the end of the 18th century, there was no writing system and Tahitian was only a spoken language. Reports by some early European explorers including Quir\u00f3s include attempts to trascribe notable Tahitian words heard during initial interactions with the indigenous people of Marquesa. Aboard the Endeavour, Lt. James Cook and the ship's master, Robert Molyneux, transcribed the names of 72 and 55 islands respectively as recited by the Tahitian arioi, Tupaia. Many of these were \"non-geographic\" or \"ghost islands\" of Polynesian mythology and all were transcribed using phonetic English spelling. In 1797, Protestant missionaries arrived in Tahiti on a British ship called Duff, captained by James Wilson. Among the missionaries was Henry Nott (1774\u20131844) who learned the Tahitian language and worked with P\u014dmare II, a Tahitian king, and the Welsh missionary, John Davies (1772-1855), to translate the Bible into Tahitian. A system of five vowels and nine consonants was adopted for the Tahitian Bible, which would become the key text by which many Polynesians would learn to read and write. John Davies's spelling book (1810) was the first book to be printed in the Tahitian language. He also published a grammar and a dictionary of that language."]}, {"page": "Aleamotu\u02bba", "response": ["Another record of the arrival of the missionaries and how they ended up in Nuku'alofa holds that at the beginning of 1826, John Davies chose two church members from Papara, Hape and Tafeta to be the first teachers to Lakeba and to prepare the way for others. With the assistance of Takai and Langi, Davies compiled a Fijian spelling book which the two Tahitians used to gain initial familiarity with the language."]}, {"page": "1800 in Wales", "response": ["*5 May - Missionary John Davies sets out for Tahiti."]}, {"page": "1772 in Wales", "response": ["*11 July - John Davies, missionary (died 1855)"]}, {"page": "Spotted green pigeon", "response": ["In 2020, after examining historical texts to clarify the origin and extinction date of the spotted green pigeon, the French ornithologist Philippe Raust pointed out that the information in Henry's 1928 book Ancient Tahiti was not gathered by her, but by her grandfather, the English reverend John Muggridge Orsmond, who collected ancient Tahitian traditions during the first half of the 19th century. The book devotes several pages to birds of Tahiti and its surroundings, including extinct ones, and the entry that Gibbs had linked to the spotted green pigeon reads: \"The titi, which cried \u201ctiti\u201d, now extinct in Tahiti, was speckled green and white and it was the shadow of the mountain gods\". The titi was included in the paragraph relating to pigeons, which suggests it was well recognised as such, and Raust found it consistent with the spotted green pigeon. Though Steadman had dismissed the idea based on the name titi also being used for shearwaters, Raust pointed out that this name was used for a wider variety of birds with vocalisations that sound like \"titi\". Raust also noted that an 1851 Tahitian dictionary compiled by the Welsh reverend John Davies included the word t\u012bt\u012bhope\u2019ore, which was used as a synonym for the titi of Henry in a 1999 dictionary. Based on definitions in Davies' dictionary, Raust translated this name as \"t\u012bt\u012b without (a long) tail.\" Raust suggested this name was used to distinguish it from the long-tailed koel (Urodynamis taitensis), which is called \"t\u012bt\u012b oroveo\", and which is somewhat similar to Latham's illustration of the spotted green pigeon, being dark brown with paler spots and underparts. Raust believed that the study of these texts reinforced the Tahitian origin of the spotted green pigeon, and suggested this could be confirmed if possible bones of this species were one day found on Tahiti and analysed for DNA. So far, few paleontological sites on Tahiti have been studied, and fossils found there have not yet revealed unknown species."]}, {"page": "Bible translations into Oceanic languages", "response": ["John Davies (1772-1855) and Henry Nott (1774-1844) translated the Bible into Tahitian.Moon Handbooks Tahiti: Including the Cook Islands - Page 133 David Stanley - 2003   The Reverend Henry Nott ... who translated the Bible into Tahitian, is buried directly behind the school (go around behind the building to see the ornate tomb).
