His family were from the Llanfihangel-yng-Ngwynfa area of Montgomeryshire. Having received some education in one of \"Madam\" Bridget Bevan's schools, he decided to set up his own school at Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant. Whilst attending a local Methodist church he heard of missionary positions in Tahiti, and volunteered to join the work. He and his wife left for the island in May 1800, and remained there for the next 55 years. Davies became superintendent of a school at Papara, established by the London Missionary Society. He also encouraged the setting up of mission schools in Fiji.His published written works include a dictionary and grammar of the Tahitian language, a translation of substantial portions of the New Testament and Psalms, Brown's Catechism, the Westminster Catechism, the Pilgrim's Progress, and a number of smaller works. He also wrote a History of the Tahitian Mission, 1799-1830 (Cambridge, 1962).", "link_mentions": {}}}
