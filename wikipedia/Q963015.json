Produced by ITV franchise contractor Southern Television in the initial run, it was first transmitted on ITV from 1979. Pertwee had first been approached to play the part of  Worzel Gummidge in a film to be written by Keith Waterhouse and Willis Hall. When this project fell through Pertwee encouraged the writers to create a television pilot instead and via his agent pitched the idea to the BBC who turned it down and then Thames Television who likewise passed on the project. Pertwee later admitted that he \"began to lose faith in the project\", until Southern Television's Lewis Rudd heard about it and enthusiastically agreed that the company would make the series. ", "The series saw Pertwee as a scarecrow, as well as using several comedic voices. The show was an immediate hit, with Pertwee describing it as \"becoming something of a cult\" after only four episodes had been broadcast. Press interest in the series was high, and it ran on the channel until 1981. Keen to continue beyond this, Pertwee campaigned for the series and it was picked up by a New Zealand network, TVNZ, in 1987. Worzel Gummidge Down Under aired for the next two years and was screened in the UK on Channel 4. In 1995, Pertwee played the role one last time in a one-off special for ITV, which celebrated 40 years of the channel. Pertwee played the title character in Worzel Gummidge, the Musical, book and lyrics by Keith Waterhouse and Willis Hall, music by Denis King, which opened at London's Cambridge Theatre in December 1981, co-starring Una Stubbs and Geoffrey Bayldon.
