Mickie Most commented on the VH1 My Generation: Herman's Hermits episode that the Hermits \"played on a lot of their records, and some they didn't.\" The group played on all their UK and US no. 1 hits (\"I'm into Something Good\", \"Mrs. Brown You've Got a Lovely Daughter\" and \"I'm Henry VIII, I Am\"), on most of their US Top Ten singles, on a number of other singles and on most album cuts.

According to Hopwood, Green and Noone, Jimmy Page played on the single \"Wonderful World\" (although Big Jim Sullivan lists the song as part of a session he played); both may have added to the backing track. Several writers have claimed that session players played on \"I'm into Something Good\"; according to the surviving band members, the song was recorded on a two-track recorder, with only a piano player in addition to the Hermits.", "* Derek Leckenby \u2013 lead guitar (1964\u20131994; died 1994)", "  bar:Derek   text:Derek Leckenby"]}, {"page": "I'm Henery the Eighth, I Am", "response": ["The rock and roll stylings of the song gave Herman's Hermits their second US number one hit; it contains only the chorus (and none of the three verses) of the original.
