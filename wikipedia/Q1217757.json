However, if the father has no subsidiary title, the older son will assume a courtesy title of \"Lord (last name)\", such as in the case of the Earl of Devon.

However, the 1990s have seen a number of conversions from Anglicanism to the Catholic Church, largely prompted by the Church of England's decision to ordain women as priests (among other moves away from traditional doctrines and structures). The resultant converts included members of the Royal Family (Katharine, Duchess of Kent, her son Lord Nicholas Windsor and her grandson Baron Downpatrick), Graham Leonard (former Anglican Bishop of London), Frances Shand Kydd (maternal grandmother of Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex), and a number of Anglican priests. Converts to Catholicism in Britain occur for any number of reasons, not least from \"the mystical buoyant instinct\" within each person to grow toward a profounder expression of what they believe.Sigrid Undset, Stages on the Road (Notre Dame: Christian Classics/Ave Maria Press, 2012); Thomas Merton, Seven Storey Mountain (New York: Harcourt, Brace, and Co., 1948) or in the New American Library paperback. In 2019, Charles Moore, former editor of The Spectator, The Daily Telegraph, and authorized biographer of Margaret Thatcher, noted that his conversion in 1994 to Catholicism followed the Church of England's decision to ordain women, \"unilaterally.\" The Church of England's \"determination to do this,\" he said, \"willy-nilly, come what may, meant that they weren't serious about Christian unity, because the Catholic and Orthodox had a different view.\"Peter Stanford, \"Himself alone,\" The Tablet, 26 October 2019 www.thetablet.co.uk This view seems to match Graham Leonard's view and many other former Anglican clerics who, according to John Jay Hughes, have noted: \"It is about authority, or lack of it, of the Church of England unilaterally to initiate a radical change in the priesthood, since it does not have its own, but only the priesthood of the whole Catholic church of which it had always claimed to be a part.\"John Jay Hughes, \"Letter to the Editor,\" National Catholic Reporter, June, 1994, p. 23.", "In October 2009, following closed-circuit talks between some Anglicans and the Holy See, Pope Benedict made a relatively unconditional offer to accommodate disaffected Anglicans in the Church of England, enabling them, for the first time, to retain parts of their liturgy and heritage under Anglicanorum coetibus, while being in full communion with Rome. By April 2012 the UK ordinariate numbered about 1200, including five bishops and 60 priests.Richard Ormrod, \"Mixed Blessings\", The Tablet, 15 October 2011. The ordinariate has recruited a group of aristocrats as honorary vice-presidents to help out. These include the Duke of Norfolk, the Countess of Oxford and Asquith and the Duchess of Somerset. Other vice-presidents include Lord Nicholas Windsor, Sir Josslyn Gore-Booth and the Squire de Lisle, whose ancestor Ambrose de Lisle was a 19th-century Catholic convert who advocated the corporate reunion of the Anglican Church with Rome. According to the first Ordinary, Mgr Keith Newton, the ordinariate will \"work on something with an Anglican flavour, but they are not bringing over any set of Anglican liturgy\".\"Ordinariate liturgy will have Anglican flavour\", The Tablet, 21 May 2011. The director of music at Westminster Abbey (Anglican), lay Catholic James O'Donnell, likens the ordinariate to a Uniate church or one of the many non-Latin Catholic rites, saying: \"This is a good opportunity for us to remember that there isn't a one size fits all, and that this could be a good moment to adopt the famous civil service philosophy \u2013 'celebrating diversity'.\"Abigail Frymann, \"Passionate perfectionist\", The Tablet, 23 April 2011. In May 2013 a former Anglican priest, Alan Hopes, was appointed the new bishop of East Anglia, whose diocese includes the Shrine of Our Lady of Walsingham.\"Ex-Anglican appointed to East Anglia\", The Tablet, 15 June 2013, p. 30. In 2021, the former Anglican bishop of Rochester, Michael Nazir-Ali, joined the Ordinariate, noting: \"I believe that the Anglican desire to adhere to apostolic, patristic and conciliar teaching can now best be maintained in the Ordinariate.\"Mark Duell and Harry Howard, \"Ex-Bishop of Rochester converts to Catholicism,\" Daily Mail.com, 14 October 2021.
