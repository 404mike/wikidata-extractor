After Stoke abandoned amateurism status in favour of professionalism Slaney left his position at Stoke.

Stoke had just finished bottom of the Football League for the second time and failed to be re-elected, instead joining the Football Alliance. Whilst Stoke had struggled to compete in the League they found the Alliance easy ending the 1890\u201391 season as champions with just two defeats and re-claimed their place in the Football League. But halfway through the 1891\u201392 campaign with the team struggling, he left his position to be replaced by Arthur Reeves."]}]}}
