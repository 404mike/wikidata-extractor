Davies has also been capped by Wales at international level. His usual position is at full back.\nDavies joined Llanelli as a 19-year-old from Carmarthen Athletic. He has since made over 100 appearances for Llanelli and the Llanelli Scarlets. During his career at Stradey Park he became the region's top try scorer, racking up 37 tries in his lengthy stay at the region.\nDavies was first included in the Welsh squad in 2004, for a series of mid-year tests, after scoring a memorable try for the Scarlets against Northampton Saints in the Heineken Cup pool stages, where the Scarlets needed to win the game to qualify for the quarter-finals, which they accomplished. This try provoked reaction all over the Welsh Rugby world and earned Davies a Wales call up. He was an unused bench replacement in a match against Argentina on 19 June.\nHe made his debut for Wales in early 2006, during the Six Nations that year. He came off the bench in a match against Ireland at Lansdowne Road, which Wales lost 31\u20135.\nIt came to light quite late in his Llanelli Scarlets career that Davies was quite a remarkable goal kicker. During and ever since the 2003 season, Davies would attempt kicks at goal from long distances. His greatest kick was against Ulster in the Celtic League at Ravenhill from an estimated distance of 59 metres. Though he did not perform these kicks often, it was this sort of play on the pitch that earned him the nickname 'Barry the boot' from one commentator during the EDF Energy and then again during the Powergen Cup semi-final against Bath.\nIn 2007, Davies joined French club CA Brive, and in June 2009, he joined the Ospreys. He was released by the Ospreys in July 2012.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ospreys (rugby union)", "response": ["* Barry Davies: (2006)"]}, {"page": "Barry Davies (disambiguation)", "response": ["Barry Davies (born 1937) is a British sports commentator.", "Barry Davies may also refer to:", "*Barry Davies (rugby union, born 1981), Welsh rugby union footballer", "*Barry Davies (rugby union, born 1875), Wales international rugby player, capped 1896", "*Barry Davies (British Army soldier) (1944\u20132016), British Army infantry soldier"]}, {"page": "Barry Davies (rugby player)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Barry Davies (rugby union, born 1981)"]}, {"page": "Barry Davies (rugby union)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Barry Davies (rugby union, born 1981)"]}]}}
