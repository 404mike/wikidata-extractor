Little Domesday was rebound in 1320, its older oak boards being re-used. At a later date (probably in the Tudor period) both volumes were given new covers. They were rebound twice in the 19th century - in 1819 and 1869, on the second occasion, by the binder Robert Riviere and his assistant, James Kew. In the 20th century, they were rebound in 1952, when their physical makeup was examined in greater detail; and yet again in 1986, for the survey's ninth centenary. On this last occasion Great Domesday was divided into two physical volumes, and Little Domesday into three volumes.Hallam 1986, pp. 29, 150\u201351, 157\u201361, 170\u201372."]}, {"page": "Rivi\u00e8re", "response": ["* Robert Riviere (1808\u20131882), English bookbinder"]}, {"page": "Robert Rivi\u00e8re", "response": ["#REDIRECT Robert Riviere"]}, {"page": "William Riviere", "response": ["Born in the parish of St Marylebone, London, on 22 October 1806, was son of Daniel Valentine Riviere, a drawing-master; and brother of Henry Parsons Rivi\u00e8re (1811\u20131888), another painter, and Robert Riviere.
