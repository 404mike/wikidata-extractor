One such element were the masks used in the orgy which were inspired by the masked carnival balls visited by the protagonists in the novel. Costume designer Marit Allen explained that Kubrick felt they fit in that scene for being part of the imaginary world and ended up \"creat[ing] the impression of menace, but without exaggeration\". As many masks as were used in the Venetian carnival were sent to London and Kubrick chose who would wear each piece.

Although Quant reportedly named the skirt after her favourite make of car, the Mini, there is no consensus as to who designed it first. Valerie Steele has noted that the claim that Quant was first is more convincingly supported by evidence than the equivalent Courr\u00e8ges claim. However, the contemporary fashion journalist Marit Allen, who edited the influential \"Young Ideas\" pages for UK Vogue, firmly stated that the British designer John Bates was the first to offer fashionable miniskirts. Other designers, including Pierre Cardin and Yves Saint Laurent, had also been raising hemlines at the same time.", "The idea that John Bates, rather than Quant or Courr\u00e8ges, innovated the miniskirt had an influential champion in Marit Allen, who as editor of the influential \"Young Ideas\" pages for UK Vogue, kept track of up-and-coming young designers. In 1966 she chose Bates to design her mini-length wedding outfit in white gabardine and silver PVC. In January 1965 Bates's \"skimp dress\" with its \"short-short skirt\" was featured in Vogue, and would later be chosen as the Dress of the Year. Bates was also famous for having designed mini-coats and dresses and other outfits for Emma Peel (played by Diana Rigg) in the TV series The Avengers, although the manufacturers blocked his request for patterned tights to enable Emma Peel to fight in skirts if necessary."]}, {"page": "Mary Quant", "response": ["The miniskirt, described as one of the defining fashions of the 1960s, is one of the garments most widely associated with Quant.
