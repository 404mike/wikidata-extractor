Eric Ives, a British historian and legal expert, advocates 1501, while Retha Warnicke, an American scholar who has also written a biography of Anne, prefers 1507. The key piece of surviving written evidence is a letter Anne wrote sometime in 1514. She wrote it in French to her father, who was still living in England while Anne was completing her education at Mechelen, in the Burgundian Netherlands, now Belgium. Ives argues that the style of the letter and its mature handwriting prove that Anne must have been about 13 at the time of its composition, while Warnicke argues that the numerous misspellings and grammar errors show that the letter was written by a child. In Ives's view, this would also be around the minimum age that a girl could be a maid of honour, as Anne was to the regent,Ives \u2013 Life & Death of Anne Boleyn Margaret of Austria. This is supported by claims of a chronicler from the late 16th century, who wrote that Anne was 20 when she returned from France.Ives, pp.18\u201320. These findings are contested by Warnicke in several books and articles, and the evidence does not conclusively support either date.The date 1507 was accepted in Roman Catholic circles. The 16th-century author William Camden inscribed a date of birth of 1507 in the margin of his Miscellany. The date was generally favoured until the late 19th century: in the 1880s, Paul Friedmann suggested a birth date of 1503. Art historian Hugh Paget, in 1981, was the first to place Anne Boleyn at the court of Margaret of Austria. See Eric Ives's biography The Life and Death of Anne Boleyn for the most extensive arguments favoring 1500/1501 and Retha Warnicke's The Rise and Fall of Anne Boleyn for her proposal of 1507.", "Anne's great-great-great-grandparents included a Lord Mayor of London, a duke, an earl, two aristocratic ladies and a knight. One of them, Geoffrey Boleyn, had been a mercer and wool merchant before becoming Lord Mayor.Ives, p. 3.Fraser, pp. 116\u201317. The Boleyn family originally came from Blickling in Norfolk,  north of Norwich. Anne's relatives included the Howards, one of the preeminent families in England; and Anne's ancestors included King Edward I of England. According to Eric Ives, she was certainly of more noble birth than Jane Seymour and Catherine Parr, Henry VIII's other English wives.Ives, p.4. \"She was better born than Henry VIII's three other English wives\". The spelling of the Boleyn name was variable, as common at the time. Sometimes it was written as Bullen, hence the bull heads which formed part of her family arms.Fraser, p.115.", "Anne's biographer Eric Ives believe that her fall and execution were primarily engineered by her former ally Thomas Cromwell.Ives, pp. 319\u2013329. See also Starkey, pp. 559\u2013569, and Elton, pp. 252\u201353, who share this view. The conversations between Chapuys and Cromwell thereafter indicate Cromwell as the instigator of the plot to remove Anne; evidence of this is seen in the Spanish Chronicle and through letters written from Chapuys to Charles V. Anne argued with Cromwell over the redistribution of Church revenues and over foreign policy. She advocated that revenues be distributed to charitable and educational institutions; and she favoured a French alliance. Cromwell insisted on filling the king's depleted coffers, while taking a cut for himself, and preferred an imperial alliance.Ives, pp. 309\u2013316. For these reasons, Ives suggests, \"Anne Boleyn had become a major threat to Thomas Cromwell.\"Ives, p. 315. Cromwell's biographer John Schofield, on the other hand, contends that no power struggle existed between Anne and Cromwell and that \"not a trace can be found of a Cromwellian conspiracy against Anne\u00a0... Cromwell became involved in the royal marital drama only when Henry ordered him onto the case.\"Schofield, pp. 106\u2013108. Schofield claims that evidence for the power struggle between Anne and Cromwell which \"now dominates many modern accounts of Anne's last weeks\" comprises \"fly-by-night stories from Alesius and the Spanish Chronicle, words of Chapuys taken out of context and an untrustworthy translation of the Calendar of State Papers.\" Cromwell did not manufacture the accusations of adultery, though he and other officials used them to bolster Henry's case against Anne.Warnicke, pp. 212, 242; Wooding, p. 194. Warnicke questions whether Cromwell could have or wished to manipulate the king in such a matter. Such a bold attempt by Cromwell, given the limited evidence, could have risked his office, even his life.Warnicke, pp. 210\u2013212. Warnicke observes: \"Neither Chapuys nor modern historians have explained why if the secretary [Cromwell] could manipulate Henry into agreeing to the execution of Anne, he could not simply persuade the king to ignore her advice on foreign policy\". Henry himself issued the crucial instructions: his officials, including Cromwell, carried them out.\"Clearly, he was bent on undoing her by any means.\" Scarisbrick, p. 455. The result was by modern standards a legal travesty;Wooding, pp. 194\u201395; Scarisbrick, pp. 454\u201355; Fraser, p. 245. however, the rules of the time were not bent in order to assure a conviction; there was no need to tamper with rules that guaranteed the desired result since law at the time was an engine of state, not a mechanism for justice.", "On 2 May 1536, Anne was arrested and taken to the Tower of London by barge. It is likely that Anne may have entered through the Court Gate in the Byward Tower rather than the Traitors' Gate, according to historian and author of The Life and Death of Anne Boleyn, Eric Ives. In the Tower, she collapsed, demanding to know the location of her father and \"swete broder\", as well as the charges against her.", "On the morning of Friday, 19 May, Anne was executed within the Tower precincts, not upon the site of the execution memorial, but, rather, according to historian Eric Ives, on a scaffold erected on the north side of the White Tower, in front of what is now the Waterloo Barracks.Ives, p. 423, based on the contemporary Lisle letters. She wore a red petticoat under a loose, dark grey gown of damask trimmed in fur and a mantle of ermine.Williams, p.146. Accompanied by two female attendants, Anne made her final walk from the Queen's House to the scaffold and she showed a \"devilish spirit\"Fraser, p.256. and looked \"as gay as if she was not going to die\".Fraser, p. 256. Anne climbed the scaffold and made a short speech to the crowd:", "Anne Boleyn was described by contemporaries as intelligent and gifted in musical arts and scholarly pursuits. She was also strong-willed and proud, and often quarrelled with Henry.Warnicke, pp. 58\u20139; Graves, 135. Biographer Eric Ives evaluates the apparent contradictions in Anne's persona:", "Because of Anne's early exposure to court life, she had powerful influences around her for most of her life. These early influences were mostly women who were engaged with art, history and religion. Eric Ives described the women around Anne as \"aristocratic women seeking spiritual fulfillment\". They included Queen Claude, of whose court Anne was a member, and Marguerite of Angoul\u00eame, who was a well-known figure during the Renaissance and held strong religious views that she portrayed through poetry. These women along with Anne's immediate family members, such as her father, may have had a large influence on Anne's personal faith."]}, {"page": "Hans Holbein the Younger", "response": ["No certain portraits survive of Anne Boleyn by Holbein, perhaps because her memory was purged following her execution for treason, incest, and adultery in 1536.Parker, 53\u201354; Wilson, 209\u201310; Ives, 43. A drawing at Windsor inscribed \"Anna Bollein Queen\" has been discounted as incorrectly labelled by K. T. Parker and other scholars, citing heraldic sketches on the reverse. Anne's biographer Eric Ives believes that there is \"little to reinstate\" that drawing or another at the British Museum inscribed \"Anne Bullen Regina Angli\u00e6 \u2026 decollata fuit Londini 19 May 1536\", though he speculates that a 17th-century copy by John Hoskins \"from an ancient original\" may be based on a lost Holbein portrait of Anne. Derek Wilson, however, follows the recent scholarship of Starkey/Rowlands in arguing that the Windsor drawing is of Anne. He doubts that John Cheke was mistaken, who made the attribution in 1542, since Cheke knew many who had seen Anne. It is clear, however, that Holbein worked directly for Anne and her circle.Rowlands, 88, 91. He designed a cup engraved with her device of a falcon standing on roses, as well as jewellery and books connected to her. He also sketched several women attached to her entourage, including her sister-in-law Jane Parker.Wilson, 208\u2013209. At the same time, Holbein worked for Thomas Cromwell as he masterminded Henry VIII's reformation. Cromwell commissioned Holbein to produce reformist and royalist images, including anti-clerical woodcuts and the title page to Myles Coverdale's English translation of the Bible. Henry VIII had embarked on a grandiose programme of artistic patronage. His efforts to glorify his new status as Supreme Head of the Church culminated in the building of Nonsuch Palace, started in 1538.Strong, 5."]}, {"page": "Thomas Cromwell", "response": ["The final session of the Reformation Parliament began on 4 February 1536.

Later, the property was in the possession of the Boleyn family, and home to Thomas Boleyn, later Earl of Wiltshire, and his wife Elizabeth between 1499 and 1505. Although the exact birth dates of their children are unknown, historians including Eric Ives are confident that all three surviving children were likely born at Blickling \u2013 Mary in about 1500, Anne in about 1501, and George in about 1504.Ives, Eric.

Based on later gossip, Elizabeth Boleyn must have been a highly attractive woman.\"Anne Boleyn,\" by Marie-Louise Bruce, p. 13 (1972). Rumours circulated when Henry was involved with Anne Boleyn that Elizabeth had once been his mistress, with the suggestion even being made that Anne Boleyn might be the daughter of Henry VIII.' However, despite recent attempts by one or two historians to rehabilitate this myth, it was denied by Henry and never mentioned in the dispensation he sought in order to make his union with Anne lawful. Most historians believe it is likely that this rumour began by confusing Elizabeth with Henry's more famous mistress Elizabeth Blount, or from the growing unpopularity of the Boleyn family after 1527.\"The Life and Death of Anne Boleyn,\" by Eric Ives, p. 16 (2004).", "In the words of historian M.L. Bruce, both Thomas and Elizabeth \"developed feelings of dislike\" for their daughter Mary. In later years, Mary's romantic involvements would only further strain this relationship. Around 1520, the Boleyns managed to arrange Mary's marriage to William Carey, a respected and popular man at court. It was sometime after the wedding that Mary became mistress to Henry VIII (the exact dates as to when the affair started and ended are unknown), although she never held the title of \"official royal mistress,\" as the post did not exist in England. It has long been rumoured that one or both of Mary Boleyn's children were fathered by Henry and not Carey. Some historians, such as Alison Weir, now question whether Henry Carey was fathered by the King.Henry VIII: The King and His Court, by Alison Weir, p. 216. Few of Henry's mistresses were ever publicly honoured, except Elizabeth Blount, who was mentioned in Parliament and whose son, Henry Fitzroy, was created Duke of Richmond and Somerset in an elaborate public ceremony in 1525.\"The Six Wives of Henry VIII,\" by Alison Weir, p. 81 (1991). Henry's relationship with Mary was so discreet that within ten years, some observers were wondering if it had ever taken place.\"The Life and Death of Anne Boleyn,\" by Eric Ives, pp. 15\u201316.", "Only a year later, the family was overtaken by a greater scandal. Elizabeth's younger daughter, Anne, and her only living son, George, were executed on charges of treason, adultery, and incest. Anne's two chief biographers, Eric Ives and Retha Warnicke, both concluded that these charges were fabricated.\"The Life and Death of Anne Boleyn,\" by Eric Ives (2004) and \"The Rise and Fall of Anne Boleyn,\" by Retha Warnicke (1989). They also agree that the King wanted to marry Jane Seymour. Beyond this obvious fact, the sequence of events is unclear and historians are divided about whether the key motivation for Anne's downfall was her husband's hatred of her or her political ambitions.For the debate, see the introduction to J.J. Scarisbrick's 1997 edition of his biography \"Henry VIII,\" \"The Life and Death of Anne Boleyn,\" by Eric Ives, pp. 319\u2013337 and \"The Rise and Fall of Anne Boleyn,\" by Retha Warnicke, pp. 189\u2013233 (1989). Despite the claims of several recent novels, academic historians agree that Anne was innocent and faithful to her husband. Nonetheless, the judges obeyed the King, condemning Anne, George Boleyn and four others to death. Elizabeth's husband Thomas Boleyn and brother Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk provided no help to the condemned. The accused men were beheaded by the axe on 17 May 1536 and Anne was executed by a French swordsman two days later."]}, {"page": "Ives", "response": ["* Eric Ives (1931\u20132012), English historian"]}, {"page": "Amy Robsart", "response": ["However, in 2009 Eric Ives suggested that a portrait miniature now in the Yale Center for British Art,Ives 2009 pp. 295, 15\u201316 the Yale Miniature, was in fact Amy Robsart.

Recently a point has been made of the fact that the sprig of yellow flowers at the lady's breast corresponds with the colours of the Robsart coat of arms, green and yellow, or Vert and Or. The name gilliflower or gillyflower derives from the French girofl\u00e9e from Greek karyophyllon meaning nut-leaf, the association deriving from the flower's scent, making it another possiple wordplay for oak for Robert or even Robsart, Robur being Latin for oak.

Richard was Edward's younger brother, but according to the Heralds' Visitations of Berkshire (1664/6), he was the father of only a single daughter, Anne. This is consistent with the descent of his manor of Great Shefford which she inherited around 1522, before Henry's execution in 1536.
