He spent two years with the club, making 26 league appearances, before joining Plymouth Argyle on a free transfer as back-up to Welsh international Bill Shortt. He made 23 appearances in his first four seasons with the club, including two in their 1951\u201352 Third Division South championship winning season. Shortt retired from League football in 1956, and it seemed likely that Major would become the club's first-choice goalkeeper but he was forced to retire from the game that year through injury. He made 78 appearances in all competitions during a seven-year stint with Argyle. He died in Derby in 2001.", "link_mentions": {}}}
