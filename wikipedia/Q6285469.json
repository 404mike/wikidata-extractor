He was born in Glasgow and studied at Glasgow School of Art in the late 1940s and early 1950s where his energy and talent was much admired by his contemporaries.McGrath is best known for his collaborations with The Goon Show stars Peter Sellers and Spike Milligan. He directed the scenes with Sellers and Orson Welles in the multi-director James bond spoof Casino Royale (1967). He also directed Sellers and Spike Milligan in The Magic Christian (1969) and The Great McGonagall (1974).McGrath also worked with director Richard Lester on the Beatles' musical-comedy films A Hard Day's Night (1964) and Help! (1965). In November 1965, McGrath directed the Beatles' first-ever music videos (known at the time as \"promo clips\"), filming the band miming to five of their hit songs, including \"Ticket to Ride\", \"Help!\" and \"Day Tripper\".In the 2004 film The Life and Death of Peter Sellers, Alan Williams plays the unnamed director of Casino Royale, whom Sellers (played by Geoffrey Rush) calls \"Joe\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "James Bond", "response": ["|Ken HughesJohn HustonJoseph McGrathRobert ParrishVal GuestRichard Talmadge"]}, {"page": "Peter Sellers", "response": ["In 1969 Sellers starred opposite Ringo Starr in the Joseph McGrath-directed film The Magic Christian. Sellers portrayed Sir Guy Grand, an eccentric billionaire who plays elaborate practical jokes on people. The critic Irv Slifkin remarked that the film was a reflection of the cynicism of Peter Sellers, describing the film as a \"proto-Pythonesque adaption of Terry Southern's semi-free-form short novel\", and \"one of the strangest films to be shown at a gala premiere for Britain's royal family\". The film, a satire on human nature, was in general viewed negatively by critics. Roger Greenspun of The New York Times believed that the film was of variable quality and summarised it as a \"brutal satire\".", "In 1974, Sellers portrayed a \"sexually voracious\" Queen Victoria in Joseph McGrath's comedic biographical film of the Scottish poet William McGonagall, The Great McGonagall, starring opposite Milligan and Julia Foster. However, the film was a critical failure, and Sellers's career and life reached an all-time low. As a result, by 1974 he agreed to accept salaries of \u00a3100,000 and 10 per cent of the gross to appear in TV productions and advertisements, well below the \u00a31 million he had once commanded per film. In 1973, he appeared in a Benson & Hedges cinema commercial; in 1975, he appeared in a series of advertisements for Trans World Airlines, in which he played several eccentric characters, including Thrifty McTravel, Jeremy \"Piggy\" Peak Thyme and an Italian singer, Vito. Biographer Michael Starr asserts that Sellers showed enthusiasm towards these roles,  although the airline campaign failed commercially."]}, {"page": "John Huston", "response": ["|||Co-director with Ken Hughes, Joseph McGrath, Robert Parrish & Val Guest"]}, {"page": "Nicolas Roeg", "response": ["|Ken HughesJohn HustonJoseph McGrathRobert ParrishVal Guest"]}, {"page": "List of film and television directors", "response": ["*Joseph McGrath"]}, {"page": "Terry Southern", "response": ["Southern and Gail Gerber moved to London in early 1966, when Southern was hired to work on the screenplay of Casino Royale.

Many planned scenes could not be filmed due to the feud between Orson Welles and star Peter Sellers, which climaxed with Sellers walking out during the filming of the casino scenes and refusing to return.

In 1968 Southern was hired for the production and he worked on a dozen drafts of the screenplay. Sellers also tinkered with it while Southern was working on The End of the Road. At Sellers' request, a draft by Southern and director Joseph McGrath was re-written by Graham Chapman and John Cleese, two young British TV comedy writers who soon became famous as members of the Monty Python team. Cleese later described McGrath as having \"no idea of comedy structure\" and complained that the film ended up as \"a series of celebrity walk-ons.\"", "In 1992, he collaborated with Joseph McGrath on a screenplay Starlets (later retitled Festival), which satirized the Cannes Film Festival. Peter Fonda reportedly tried to prevail on Southern to give up any claim on Easy Rider in exchange for a payment of $30,000, but Southern refused.
