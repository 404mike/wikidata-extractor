The basic issue was Osborne's unwillingness to go through the rewrite process, more arduous in film than it is in the theatre. Richardson had a different version. In his autobiography (p.\u00a0195), he writes that Osborne was angry at being replaced in a small role by Laurence Harvey to whom the producers had obligations.

The producer also approached Richard Burton for the role, but Burton also died in August that same year.

In that year, Alan Bridges began direction of the film with a script co-written by Ken Wheat and his brother Jim Wheat. After ten weeks of filming, the production suffered from a lack of funds from its production company Granat Releasing, and the film had to be placed on hold. Kubritz sought to revive production, but when the opportunity came a year later, Schroder had aged too considerably for the film to work.

Over the years, however, it has lost some of its status, especially in competition with the unabridged 1996 adaptation, which many critics now consider superior, as well as the 1994 animated classic The Lion King which was also based on Hamlet. The film has also been compared to Olivier's later Shakespearean adaptations of Henry V and Richard III. This is primarily because Olivier, according to some critics, overemphasised Hamlet's Oedipal fixation on his mother, and because Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, two of the more important supporting characters in the play, were omitted from this film version, robbing the film of what could have been some of its best comedic moments. The fact that Rosencrantz and Guildenstern had been included in the 1969 Nicol Williamson \u2013 Tony Richardson Hamlet and the 1990 Mel Gibson/Franco Zeffirelli version, both of which are shorter than Olivier's, did not help Olivier's rationale that the play needed such drastic cuts to work on screen. In contrast, Kenneth Branagh's 1996 film version of the complete Hamlet included everything that Olivier had omitted. However, the parts of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern (and Osric) are reduced in the Richardson and Zeffirelli versions, and Branagh's version is almost 90 minutes longer than Olivier's - the length of an entire feature film."]}, {"page": "Hamilton, South Lanarkshire", "response": ["* Nicol Williamson     (Actor, Tony Award nominee)"]}, {"page": "The Goodbye Girl", "response": ["* Nicol Williamson as Oliver Fry (uncredited)"]}, {"page": "Robert Duvall", "response": ["Duvall became an important presence in American films beginning in the 1970s.
