A sequel to Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011) and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014), it is the third film in the Planet of the Apes reboot series, and the ninth film in the Planet of the Apes film series. The film stars Andy Serkis, Woody Harrelson and Steve Zahn, and follows a confrontation between the apes, led by Caesar, and the humans for control of Earth, while Caesar himself exacts revenge for the murder of his family. Like its predecessor, its premise shares several similarities to the fifth film in the original series, Battle for the Planet of the Apes (1973), but it is not a direct remake.\nWar for the Planet of the Apes premiered in New York City on July 10, 2017, and was theatrically released in the United States on July 14, 2017, by 20th Century Fox. The film was a commercial success having grossed over $490 million. It received critical acclaim, with many reviewers highlighting the performances (particularly Serkis'), visual effects, story, direction, cinematography, musical score and emotional depth. The film received a nomination for Best Special Visual Effects at the 71st British Academy Film Awards, and was nominated for Best Visual Effects at the 90th Academy Awards. It was also nominated for four Saturn Awards, including Best Director for Reeves and Best Actor for Serkis. An untitled sequel is currently in development, with Wes Ball said to replace Reeves as director.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Switched at Birth (TV series)", "response": ["*Max Lloyd-Jones as Noah, Bay's hard-of-hearing friend (and short-term boyfriend).
