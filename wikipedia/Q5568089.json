DC Emma Summerhayes (Anna Acton) and DS Cameron Bryant (Glen Wallace) visit Ian to inform him they have found Lucy's body. Ian is inconsolable as he identifies her body and breaks the news to Jane, Denise, Cindy, Bobby and, later, Peter. It is revealed Lucy died because of a deliberate head injury. The police question the family and search Lucy's bedroom. Cindy tells Ian that Lucy was an habitual user of cocaine. Ian says that he was at his restaurant the previous evening, but Cindy says she went there and did not see him. Ian laments that he did not know his daughter at all and furiously throws Cindy out, forcing her to return to Devon. The police take a DNA sample from Lee before he returns to Afghanistan. Summerhayes returns to say that there has been a leak at the police station and the press have got hold of some vital information. It is explained that there was very little blood found at the common, meaning that Lucy was not killed in a mugging, but was murdered elsewhere, then dumped on the Common. Her purse and phone are also missing. David Wicks (Michael French) discovers Max's sexual relationship with Lucy and accuses him of killing her. Max denies it but David later finds CCTV footage of Max and Lucy arguing on the night of her death. David does not tell the police because he is worried that if Max is questioned it will affect the health of his cancer-stricken fianc\u00e9e Carol Jackson (Lindsay Coulson), who is Max's sister. He says that he does not believe Max killed her and together they burn all computer evidence of the footage."]}, {"page": "The Secret (TV series)", "response": ["* Glen Wallace as Trevor Buchanan  "]}, {"page": "List of EastEnders characters (2016)", "response": ["| A police officer who interviews Bobby Beale (Eliot Carrington) after he is arrested for assaulting his adoptive mother Jane Beale (Laurie Brett).

They introduced a patient named Andy Bryan (Glen Wallace), who is revealed to be Greg's old childhood friend. Producers hinted that the character was hiding a secret, having Andy refer to Greg by the name of Callum. MacLiam explained that Greg has tried to disassociate himself from his past. He is then dishonest with Sahira and states that Andy once beat him up. She soon learns that it was Greg who hurt Andy. He also causes more problems by refusing to treat Andy, wanting to forget his past. It was then revealed that Andy was abused by his football coach. He tries to commit suicide by jumping off the hospital roof and Greg is forced to face Andy and convince him to back down. In a storyline twist that writers had kept secret prior to the episode being broadcast, Greg reveals that he was also a victim of the abuse. MacLiam branded it a \"gritty storyline\" to portray. He added that it would test the relationships he shared with other characters as he tries to move on with his life. Sahira also offers her support to Greg during his ordeal. Craig-Brown used the storyline to ultimately bring Greg and Sahira closer together."]}]}}
