Beginning his musical career on lead guitar and accordion, he switched to bass in 1964, playing in numerous line-ups and backing chart artistes of the day such as Vince Taylor and Bert Weedon before joining soul band Lloyd Alexander Real Estate, which contained, or was associated with, the future members of Audience.  When Audience folded, Williams went on to play sessions for numerous artistes, also joining The Nashville Teens and Jonathan Kelly's Outside before retiring from the music business in 1975 to pursue interests in animal welfare, ultimately founding The Fox Project, a wildlife charity.\nWilliams reformed Audience in 2004 with other co-founders Howard Werth and Keith Gemmell, plus new drummer John Fisher, who died in 2008 and was subsequently replaced by Simon Jeffrey.  Audience finally folded in 2013 due to Gemmell's declining health and Williams' reluctance to continue with substitute musicians.\nIn 2009, Williams joined Blue Pulse, releasing, in May 2012, an album entitled Trams, largely featuring his own material.  The band has also served as backing band for vintage UK rock star, Terry Dene.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "January 19", "response": ["*1945 \u2013 Trevor Williams, English singer-songwriter and bass player "]}, {"page": "The Nashville Teens", "response": ["Arthur Sharp left in 1972 to join the band's one-time manager Don Arden, and Trevor Williams joined.
