Andy McNab has written about Nick Stone in nineteen different books. Nick has undertaken many missions including kidnapping a powerful Russian Mafia lord and killing a money-laundering Algerian business man.\nNick Stone left the SAS in 1988, soon after the shooting of three IRA volunteers in Gibraltar. Once working for British Intelligence as a 'K' on deniable operations, he also briefly worked for an American agency. Now he roams the world as somewhat of a mercenary just trying to keep his head above water. Early novels are accounts of assassination and intrigue filled with tradecraft and detail. Later novels, while still detailed, deal with more social topics such as White slavery/prostitution, government corruption, war profiteering, Human rights and torture with Nick never having answers to these complicated topics, but normally just bearing witness.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Zero Hour", "response": ["* \"Zero Hour\", a 2010 Nick Stone story by Andy McNab"]}, {"page": "Andy McNab", "response": ["The Nick Stone Missions are a successful series based on an ex-SAS soldier working on deniable operations for British intelligence.
