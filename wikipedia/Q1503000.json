His broad research interests span from evolutionary economics and history of economic thought to Marxism and theoretical biology. He first became known for his book Economics and Institutions: A Manifesto for a Modern Institutional Economics (1988), which criticises modern 'mainstream' economics and calls to revise economic theory on the new grounds of institutionalism. His reputation has become enhanced owing to the trilogy of more recent books \u2013 Economics and Utopia (1999), How Economics Forgot History (2001) and The Evolution of Institutional Economics (2004) all of which built Hodgson's arguments into a more rounded and powerful critique of mainstream economic theory.\nIn 1988, Hodgson was involved in setting up the European Association for Evolutionary Political Economy (EAEPE). He was its general secretary until 1998. In 2000 Hodgson co-founded The Other Canon, a center and network for heterodox economics research, with main founder and executive chairman Erik Reinert and others. In 2013, Hodgson co-founded the World Interdisciplinary Network for Institutional Research (WINIR). In his 2015 book \"Conceptualizing Capitalism\" and an article entitled \"Legal Institutionalism\", he sketched his own research program of a legal institutionalism.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Methodological individualism", "response": ["* Geoffrey Hodgson, (2007) \"Meanings of Methodological Individualism\", Journal of Economic Methodology 14(2), June, pp.\u00a0211\u2013226."]}, {"page": "Euthyphro dilemma", "response": ["Yale Law School Professor Myres S.
