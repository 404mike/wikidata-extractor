He joined the practice in 1977, moving to Hong Kong in 1979 to oversee the design and construction of The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation\u2019s headquarters. Returning to the UK in 1986, he proceeded to build up a remarkable portfolio of experience including the Carr\u00e9 d'Art in N\u00eemes, the ITN building in London, Cranfield University Library, Hong Kong\u2019s Chek Lap Kok airport, the Al Faisaliah development in Riyadh, London\u2019s Millennium Bridge, 30 St Mary Axe ('The Gherkin\u2019) and City Hall.\nShuttleworth left Foster and Partners to set up his own practice, Make Architects, in 2004. The practice has completed a number of award-winning buildings which include the City of London Information Centre, the 55 Baker Street office development, Grosvenor Waterside and 10 Weymouth Street residential schemes, all in central London. Other completed projects in the UK include The Cube in Birmingham, the Montpellier Chapter hotel in Cheltenham, the Oxford Molecular Pathology Institute for the University of Oxford, and the Handball Arena for the London 2012 Olympics, known as the Copper Box.\nProjects currently under construction include the Thomas Clarkson Community College in Cambridgeshire, a student housing scheme in Hammersmith, a children\u2019s hospital in Kurdistan, a boutique hotel in China and a residential tower in Hong Kong.\nShuttleworth and members of his staff appeared in the final of the UK 2007 edition of The Apprentice, where they advised the two remaining contestants on designing an iconic building for London's South Bank.\nKen Shuttleworth was a commissioner of the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (CABE) from 2004\u20132011 - an executive non-departmental public body of the UK government which promoted better design and design education.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "30 St Mary Axe", "response": ["Since its completion, the building has won a number of awards for architecture.

In December 2005, a survey of the world's largest firms of architects published in 2006 BD World Architecture 200 voted the tower as the most admired new building in the world. However, Ken Shuttleworth, who worked for Foster + Partners on the design of the building, said in 2011 that he believed the style was now out-moded: \"I was looking at the glass all around and [thought], 'Why on earth did we do that?' Now we would do things differently\".
