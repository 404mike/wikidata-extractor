Three days later, in an interview with Robin Oakley on BBC Radio 4, he said \"To be honest, I found it intellectually numbing and tedious in the extreme. I most certainly won't miss the constituency work. I've got to tell you that honestly. It's 22 years of the same cases, but just the faces and the people changing. It might sound a little disparaging to say this about people's lives and their problems, and we did deal with them, ... but I got no satisfaction from this at all. I really didn't. And all you were was a sort of high-powered social worker and perhaps not even a good one at that. I will miss being Chairman of the Works of Art Committee . . . because I was having so much intellectual enjoyment, and indeed just straightforward fun, out of reorganising our collection, and that kept me in touch with history.\""]}, {"page": "Emma Nicholson, Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne", "response": ["She contested the constituency of Blyth in 1979, but was defeated.
