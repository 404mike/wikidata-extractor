His parents, Alex (Alexander) Deutsch and Dena n\u00e9e Gerst, were German Jews.\nIn 1914, Deutsch was \"a Buffalo movie house musician\", accompanying silent films. Deutsch began his composing career on Broadway in the 1920s and 1930s, before working for Hollywood films beginning in the late 1930s. For Broadway, he orchestrated Irving Berlin's As Thousands Cheer and George and Ira Gershwin's Pardon My English.Deutsch won Oscars for his background music for Oklahoma! (1955), and for conducting the music for Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1954) and Annie Get Your Gun (1950). He was nominated for The Band Wagon (1953) and the 1951 film version of Show Boat, for which he conducted the orchestra. For Broadway and Hollywood, he conducted, composed and arranged music, but did not write songs, not even for the Broadway shows on which he worked. In addition to his music for westerns and his conducting of the scores for musicals, Deutsch composed for films noir, including The Mask of Dimitrios (1944), The Maltese Falcon (1941), and Nobody Lives Forever (1946), as well as Little Women (the 1949 adaptation), and the Billy Wilder comedies Some Like It Hot (1959), and The Apartment (1960). He retired in 1961.\nDeutsch died in 1980, at the age of 82.

It has an authentic 1920s jazz feel using sharp, brassy strings to create tension in certain moments, for example whenever Spats' gangsters appear. In terms of cinematography and aesthetics, Billy Wilder chose to shoot the film in black and white as Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis in full drag costume and make-up looked \"unacceptably grotesque\" in early color tests. Despite Monroe's contract requiring the film to be in color, she agreed to it being filmed in black and white after seeing that Curtis and Lemmon's makeup gave them a \"ghoulish\" appearance on color film. Orry-Kelly who was in charge of costume design created the costumes for Marilyn Monroe as well as Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis, after the stock costumes the studio provided for the male leads fit poorly.", "* Roger Hall's review of Adolph Deutsch's film score for Some Like It Hot", "Category:Films scored by Adolph Deutsch"]}, {"page": "Father of the Bride (1950 film)", "response": ["Category:Films scored by Adolph Deutsch"]}, {"page": "Grim Fandango", "response": ["Grim Fandango has an original soundtrack that combines orchestral score, South American folk music, jazz, bebop, swing, and big band music, inspired by the likes of Duke Ellington and Benny Goodman as well as film composers Max Steiner and Adolph Deutsch.
