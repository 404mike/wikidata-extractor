The book assessed Alestan's manor at five hides and Mortimer's at three hides. De Mortimer's tenant was another Norman, Ralph Bluet. In 1204 he or a later Ralph Bluet gave a palfrey horse in exchange for a licence to enclose an area of land south-east of the former Roman town as a deer park. Today parts of the earthwork park pale survive and parts of the former park remain wooded."]}, {"page": "House of Burnett", "response": ["There is documented evidence of the family of Burnard in England from the Norman Conquest in 1066, but not before.

There was evidence of St Aldhelm working in the area and there was an Anglo-Saxon church constructed in the area with a Norman church later being erected to replace it. There it was given the parish name of Ditchridge. Following the Norman Conquest of England, King William I of England gave the land and church to William De Ow. It was rebuilt in 1158 using stone from the nearby Hazelbury quarry. It was originally dedicated to the Virgin Mary but following the martyrdom of the Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Becket, a small chapel dedicated to him was constructed nearby in 1190. As Box was on the route to the shrine of Thomas Becket at Canterbury Cathedral, Kent for pilgrims, by the end of the 13th century, it was rededicated to Thomas Becket. The chapel was renamed Hazelbury Chapel following the church's re-dedication."]}]}}
