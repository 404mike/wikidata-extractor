He enjoyed little apparent success, but one of his dramas played a part in the campaign of the Syncretic Society to lift licensing restrictions in London, and have more serious and new drama performed.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Abraham Heraud", "response": ["The Syncretics, who included also George Stephens, became active in agitation to have unperformed drama staged. The context was the restriction in London to three theatres with patents, and an absence of new verse drama productions.Thomson, p. 380. Not short of ambition, the Dramatic Committee of the Association, through Heraud, pressed for a reformed and poetic theatre, an actors' joint stock company, and the performance of new work, as well as drama schools to elevate taste. A failed demonstration, Martinuzzi of 1841, written by Stephens, led to Heraud in particular being lampooned in Punch, by William Makepeace Thackeray.Nadelhaft, p. 637\u20138. The existing theatrical monopoly was, however, abolished by the Theatres Act 1843."]}, {"page": "George Stephens", "response": ["George Stephens may refer to:", "*George Stephens (playwright) (1800\u20131851), English author and dramatist", "*George Stephens (philologist) (1813\u20131895), British archaeologist and philologist, who worked in Scandinavia", "*George Stephens (Canadian politician) (1846\u20131916), merchant and politician in Ontario, Canada", "*George Stephens (priest) (died 1751), Canon of Windsor", "*George Stephens (American football) (1873\u20131946), college football player", "*George Stephens (cricketer) (1889\u20131950), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Hugo John Belfour", "response": ["While still 18, Belfour produced The Vampire, a Tragedy in five acts, by St. John Dorset, Tragedy London, 1st and 2nd editions, 1821, and Loveless, another five-act tragedy. The scene is laid in Egypt. The second edition was inscribed \"To W. C. Macready, Esq.\", to whom the work had been submitted in manuscript. Belfour also wrote Montezuma, a Tragedy in five acts, and other Poems, by St. John Dorset, London, 1822. Both these works are now considered collaborations with George Stephens. St. John Dorset was one of the playwrights included in George Darley's condemnation of followers of Lord Byron, in the \"John Lacy Letters\"."]}]}}
