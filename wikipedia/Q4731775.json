He was on the losing side in the 1981 Football League Cup Final against Liverpool, the same year that he collected a Second Division title medal as the Hammers returned to the First Division after three years away. In 1983\u201384, the Hammers were in the title race mid season but fell away to finish ninth. They re-emerged as title challengers in 1985\u201386 and were in the hunt for the title right up to the end of April, finally finishing third. He also helped them reach the League Cup semi-finals in 1988\u201389, but it was a disappointing season for the Hammers who were then relegated to the Second Division.
