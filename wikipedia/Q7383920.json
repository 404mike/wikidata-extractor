In February 2013, Tounkara joined League Two club Bristol Rovers on a week-long trial. The trial proved to be successful, and he signed for the club on a short-term contract until the end of the 2012\u201313 season. He made his debut for Bristol Rovers in the club's 3\u20130 win over Burton Albion on 2 March 2013, coming on as a substitute for Ryan Brunt on the hour mark. He scored twice for the club on Easter Monday, in a 4\u20132 away victory against Dagenham & Redbridge, in what was also his first starting appearance. After the match, manager John Ward praised Tounkara's performance \u2014 \"He has also got a good awareness and showed he can finish as well so he is definitely an interesting player. He's only had bits and pieces of games since he has been here, but he has worked really hard in training. The lad came over from France without a Euro in his pocket a couple of months ago determined to carve out a career for himself. If he keeps that sort of form up it won't only be me looking to try and keep him\". However, Tounkara was released by the club at the end of the season, with Ward stating the return to fitness of his other strikers meant the player would get limited game-time.
