In 1981 he filmed Woza Albert!. He was the founding head of BBC Films. Up until 2007, BBC Films was run and funded as a private company, with its own offices in Mortimer Street around the corner from Broadcasting House, while still under the full control of the BBC.\nIn 2007, a re-structure of the division saw it re-integrated into the main BBC Fiction department of BBC Vision, under the control of Jane Tranter. As a result, it moved out of its independent offices into Television Centre and David Thompson, previously head of BBC Films, left to start his own film production company, Origin Pictures. The films he has produced for Origin Pictures include The Awakening, An Education, and The Sense of an Ending. He has continued to executive-produce films for the BBC, including The History Boys (2006) and the remake of Brideshead Revisited (2008).\nDavid Thompson's two-part BBC documentary on the films of Jean Renoir in 1993 led to him editing (with Lorraine LoBianco) an anthology of the director's letters for Faber which was published in 1994. He has also edited Scorsese on Scorsese (with Ian Cristie), also for Faber.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "David Thompson", "response": ["* David M.
