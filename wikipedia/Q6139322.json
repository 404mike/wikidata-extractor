On 15 November 1884, they won their first game 4\u20130 against Brunswick Rovers. This was a friendly match, as there were no leagues until 1888. Under the presidency of James McGaul, the team had a successful inaugural season, losing only one of their fifteen matches. An unrelated, disbanded side had played under the name \"Tranmere Rovers Cricket Club (Association football section)\" in 1881\u201382. On 16 September 1885, before their second season began, Belmont F.C. adopted this name Tranmere Rovers.  Tranmere is historically a large village that was subsumed within the later expansion of the town of Birkenhead."]}, {"page": "List of Tranmere Rovers F.C. managers", "response": ["From their foundation in 1884 until they became a limited company, Tranmere Rovers were run under the presidency of local businessman James McGaul. The first man to hold a position equivalent to what is today referred to as a manager was Bert Cooke, who was appointed manager in 1912, though the directors continued to choose the team for each game. Cooke stayed in charge for 23 years, the longest spell of any manager at the club. He oversaw the club's victory in the Lancashire Combination in 1914, promotion to the Central League in 1919 and, as founder members of Division Three North, their first Football League match on 27 August 1921. He also developed a string of talented local youngsters, including Dixie Dean and Pongo Waring. However, in 1935, Cooke's career ended in discredit; following illegal payments to directors and players, he was sacked and replaced by Jack Carr."]}, {"page": "McGaul, James", "response": ["#redirectJames McGaul"]}, {"page": "McGaul", "response": ["#REDIRECT James McGaul"]}]}}
