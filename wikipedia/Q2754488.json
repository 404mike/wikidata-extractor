As a result, his actions are considered one of the most significant factors in the rise of the Indian independence movement. O'Dwyer endorsed Reginald Dyer's action at Jallianwala Bagh, making it clear that he felt Dyer's orders to shoot at the crowds was correct. He subsequently administered martial law in  Punjab, on 15 April, and backdated it to 30 March 1919.\nIn 1925, he published India as I knew it, in which he wrote that his time as administrator in Punjab was preoccupied by the threat of terrorism and spread of political agitation.\nIn 1940, in retaliation for the massacre, O'Dwyer was assassinated by the Indian revolutionary Udham Singh.", "link_mentions": {}}}
