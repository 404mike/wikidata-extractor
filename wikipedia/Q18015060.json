The Sheridans were invited to the Linley home as Elizabeth's father was seeking to impress Thomas Sheridan with the grandeur of his house while Sheridan wished to elicit help gaining new students. A close friendship soon developed between the teenage members of the families. At the end of the year, she was betrothed to an elderly but wealthy suitor, Walter Long, but the engagement was broken off shortly before the date set for the wedding. Reports vary as to why the engagement was broken; Elizabeth's sister-in-law, Elizabeth Sheridan wrote that Linley had advised Long she would never be happy in their marriage, prompting him to withdraw his suit. Other reports indicate that the characterization of Long in the play The Maid of Bath written by Samuel Foote was the cause of the break. The play, which opened on 26 June 1771 was a new comedy, which premiered at the Haymarket Theatre, dramatising Linley's story. It played for 24 nights in London and was very popular but made Elizabeth a figure of ridicule. Yet other reports indicate that Long was put off by the attention of so many other men. Whatever the reason, the engagement was severed; Long paid her compensation of \u00a33,000 in 1771 (), and she also received \u00a31,000 worth of clothing and jewellery.", "The duels were the impetus for Thomas Linley and Thomas Sheridan deciding that the young couple must be kept apart; Elizabeth was kept in Bath, overworked but otherwise confined to the house, and on 28 August Richard was sent to Waltham Abbey in Essex with the intention he would go on to study law at Middle Temple. Once separated and forbidden by their fathers from contacting each other, their ardour began to wane. Linley encouraged other wealthy suitors to court Elizabeth; Sir Thomas Clarges proposed to her but she refused him around early December 1772. Thomas Norris also asked her to marry him but she rejected him. Sheridan did not remain chaste and had affairs but when he discovered Elizabeth was due to perform at Drury Lane, just a few miles from where he was, in February 1773, the romance was revived. Details of the exact events and circumstances that transpired at the beginning of April 1773 are sketchy but Sheridan, who had turned twenty-one on 30 October 1772 so legally no longer a minor, convinced Elizabeth's father to allow them to wed. Sheridan's father was in Ireland and was not informed or invited."]}, {"page": "Thomas Sheridan", "response": ["Thomas Sheridan may refer to:", "*Thomas Sheridan (divine) (1687\u20131738), Anglican divine", "*Thomas Sheridan (actor) (1719\u20131788), Irish actor and teacher of elocution", "*Thomas Sheridan (soldier) (1775\u20131817/18)", "*Thomas Sheridan (politician) (1640s\u20131712), Chief Secretary for Ireland", "*Sir Thomas Sheridan (Jacobite), advisor in the Jacobite rising of 1745", "* Thomas Sheridan (anthropologist) (born 1951), anthropologist of Sonora, Mexico"]}, {"page": "Richard Brinsley Sheridan (politician)", "response": ["He was born in London, the eldest son of Thomas Sheridan, colonial treasurer in the Cape of Good Hope and the novelist Caroline Henrietta Callander of Craig forth and the grandson of his namesake, the playwright Richard Brinsley Sheridan.
