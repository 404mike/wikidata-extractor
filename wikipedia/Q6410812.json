His friend, Eden Phillpotts wrote that \"no record or estimate of the conte in English letters can be complete without study of his contributions thereto.\"Phillpotts, Eden (ed.) A Peakland Faggot. London: Faber and Gwyer, 1926. He dedicated his story collection, The Striking Hours, to Gilchrist, terming him \"the master of the short story.\" Gilchrist's first story collection failed to draw much attention, and while he occasionally published short stories all of his life, including one, \"The Crimson Weaver\" in the celebrated magazine, The Yellow Book, the bulk of his output was his twenty-two novels, in addition to his six short story collections, a play and four regional guide books.  He was friends with many noted writers including Phillpotts, William Sharp (Fiona MacLeod) and Hugh Walpole. He worked for noted editor and writer, William Ernest Henley, and he corresponded with Larner Sugden, Kineton Parkes and occasionally H.G. Wells."]}, {"page": "Literature of Birmingham", "response": ["Like Tolkien, Young saw Birmingham's man-made urbanity and its mechanically-driven economy as despoiling influences on the natural beauty and simple lifestyle of the rural Midlands, but other writers took a less nostalgia-driven approach. Hardware: a novel in four books was written in 1914 and is recognised as the major work of the Birmingham-educated author Kineton Parkes. It is set in the Midlands town of \"Metlingham\", which it depicts in prodigious detail and which is very obviously based on Birmingham. Parkes, like Tolkien, was influenced by the Arts and Crafts Movement but his writing also reflected the urbanist values of the Civic Gospel ideology with which the movement in Birmingham was closely associated, concluding \"at heart Metlingham was sound: the City and its Council\u2026 the life of the City and of its suburbs\u2026\". The structure of Hardware was also innovative and progressive, reflecting the fragmentation of urban life through its division into 4 books, 40 chapters and nearly 300 sections in a form that anticipated James Joyce's later work Ulysses."]}, {"page": "William Kineton Parkes", "response": ["#REDIRECT Kineton Parkes"]}]}}
