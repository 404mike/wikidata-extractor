From a background as a \"salt and water\" physician, he made detailed clinical observations and scientifically imaginative connections which were the basis of numerous advances in the molecular biology of the human kidney. Wrong himself contributed to much of the molecular work after his own \"retirement\". He dictated amendments to his final paper during his final illness in his own teaching hospital, University College Hospital (UCH), London. Though academic in his leanings, he was a compassionate physician who established a warm rapport with patients, a link he regarded as the keystone of his research. He belonged to a generation of idealistic young doctors responsible for the establishment of the UK's National Health Service in the post-War years.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "February 24", "response": ["*  2012   \u2013 Oliver Wrong, English nephrologist and academic (b. 1925)"]}, {"page": "George MacKinnon Wrong", "response": ["The historian Rosalind Mitchison and the physician Oliver Wrong were both grandchildren by Edward Murray Wrong.
