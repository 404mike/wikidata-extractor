She was educated in England and France. She became known for her recitations and her poetry written for recitation, including her dramatic poem about heroine Alice Ayres. In 1877, Blake married actor William Gowing.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alice Ayres", "response": ["Emilia Aylmer Blake wrote perhaps the first poem about Ayres, titled Alice Ayres, which she recited at a social gathering in June 1885. Sir Francis Hastings Doyle also wrote a well-received poem in honour of Ayres, as did leading social reformer and women's rights campaigner Laura Ormiston Chant. By the late 1880s Ayres was coming to be seen as a model of British devotion to duty, and her story was told in collections of heroic and inspirational stories for children, including as the first story in F. J. Cross's influential Beneath the Banner, in which Cross remarked that: \"She had tried to do her best always. Her loving tenderness to the children committed to her care and her pure gentle life were remarked by those around her before there was any thought of her dying a heroic death. So, when the great trial came, she was prepared; and what seems to us Divine unselfishness appeared to her but simple duty.\""]}, {"page": "Emilia Aylmer Gowing", "response": ["#REDIRECTEmilia Aylmer Blake"]}, {"page": "Emilia Julia Aylmer-Gowing", "response": ["#REDIRECT Emilia Aylmer Blake"]}]}}
