He was named in a three-man shortlist for the role alongside Frenchman Philippe Troussier and Welsh former international player Dean Saunders. Toshack's appointment was unpopular with some senior players with Robbie Savage claiming he could face a player mutiny if appointed. In total, seven players announced their international retirement within months of Toshack's appointment, including Savage, captain Gary Speed, who had been critical of Toshack's opinions previously, Mark Pembridge and Andy Melville. Former Wales manager Mark Hughes also questioned Toshack's suitability for the role, stating that UEFA coaching qualifications which Toshack did not possess should be considered a prequisite for the job."]}, {"page": "Brian Horton", "response": ["Horton's next move was to become assistant to former Brighton teammate Mark Lawrenson, now rookie manager at Second Division Oxford United in May 1988. Lawrenson left the Manor Ground in October 1988 after star player Dean Saunders was sold to Derby County without his consent, and the board elected Horton as his replacement; at the time both Derby and Oxford were owned by members of Robert Maxwell's family. The million pound fee for Saunders allowed Horton to build a squad of his own: former Brighton teammate Steve Foster (Luton Town), Wales international Andy Melville (\u00a3270,000 from Swansea City), New Zealand international Ceri Evans (free agent), defensive midfielder Mickey Lewis (part-exchange to Derby for Trevor Hebberd), Jim Magilton (\u00a3100,000 from Liverpool), John Durnin (\u00a3250,000 from Liverpool), and England under-21 international winger Paul Simpson (\u00a3200,000 from Manchester City). He also gave d\u00e9buts to Joey Beauchamp and Paul Kee. Under his leadership Oxford finished the 1988\u201389 Second Division campaign in 17th-place. In preparation for the 1989\u201390 campaign, he exploited the relationship between Derby and Oxford to sign Dave Penney for \u00a3175,000. On the pitch it was a case of deja-vu, as Oxford finished the season in 17th-place, again with 54 points. Hoping to build a promotion winning squad for the 1990\u201391 campaign, he bought Doncaster Rovers defender Les Robinson for \u00a3150,000. The \"Yellows\" finished in tenth-place, eight points off the play-off places.", "The club faced a financial crisis following the mysterious death of Robert Maxwell, and over the summer Horton was forced to sell striker Martin Foyle to Port Vale for \u00a3375,000. He made no major signings in Foyle's place, and instead handed d\u00e9buts to Paul Wanless, Chris Allen, and Bobby Ford. He also sold Paul Simpson to Derby for \u00a3650,000 in February 1992. The loss of close to \u00a31 million of talent showed on the pitch, as Oxford ended the 1991\u201392 season one place and two points ahead of relegated Plymouth Argyle. They secured their safety with a final day win over Tranmere Rovers. At the end of the season he gave Steve McClaren his first job in management, putting him in charge of Oxford's youth-team. There was less drama in 1992\u201393, as his side finished in 14th-place, seven points above the relegation zone. Over the summer he paid Corby Town \u00a320,000 for striker Matt Murphy, and sold Andy Melville on to Sunderland for \u00a3500,000."]}, {"page": "1998 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)", "response": ["* Andy Melville"]}, {"page": "2005\u201306 West Ham United F.C. season", "response": ["| Andy Melville"]}, {"page": "Melville (name)", "response": ["*Andy Melville (born 1968), Welsh footballer"]}, {"page": "List of people from Swansea", "response": ["*Andy Melville"]}, {"page": "List of Fulham F.C. records and statistics", "response": ["* Andy Melville"]}, {"page": "History of West Ham United F.C.", "response": ["The team saw over 15 new players brought in on both short- and long-term deals, including Rob Lee, David Connolly, Marlon Harewood, Matthew Etherington, Kevin Horlock, Hayden Mullins, Nigel Reo-Coker, Andy Melville, Bobby Zamora and Brian Deane.

The squad was bolstered with a contingent of loan signings such as Wayne Quinn, Neil Mellor, Matthew Kilgallon, Niclas Alexandersson, Robbie Stockdale and Jon Harley. As a result, the team routinely lacked cohesion and without Defoe for a large part lacked a quality striker in front of goal \u2013 though Connolly's immediate impact (five in the nine opening league games) and positive attitude coupled with Harewood's form went some way to make up for the loss of the future England international."]}, {"page": "2004 Football League First Division play-off Final", "response": ["West Ham's play-off semi-final opponents were Ipswich Town, and the first leg took place at Portman Road in Ipswich on 15 May 2004.

Twelve minutes into the second half, Darren Bent scored with a header after Richard Naylor's initial shot rebounded off the crossbar, and the game ended 1\u20130.

In the 50th minute, Matthew Etherington scored from inside the Ipswich penalty area with a strike described by the BBC as a \"screamer\" to level the tie.   Twenty minutes later, an Etherington corner was poorly defended by Ipswich, and Christian Dailly's shot was deflected into the Ipswich goal off Tommy Miller's heel.
