He was replaced by John McCartney until 1904, when he came back as manager until 1912, and won the FA Cup with them in his last season in charge (of his 2nd spell). After his success at Barnsley, he was persuaded to join Huddersfield where he laid the groundwork for the success to be achieved by Herbert Chapman. When Huddersfield chairman Hilton Crowther decided that a Leeds-based team would be a better vehicle for his attentions, he persuaded his manager to move with him, and so Fairclough took over from Dick Ray as Leeds United manager for the club's first full season in the Football League. Fairclough put together a useful team, and in 1923-24 he saw his side win promotion to the First Division. The following year saw the signing of the goal-scoring talents of Tom Jennings and Russell Wainscoat, to stand alongside the defensive abilities of Ernest Hart and Tom Townsley. Despite Jennings astonishing haul of 35 goals in 42 games, 1926-27 saw the side relegated and Fairclough resigned in the close season. He briefly returned to management with Barnsley in 1929, but resigned after a year in the job."]}, {"page": "Hughie Ferguson", "response": ["In the summer of 1923, Third Lanark arranged a tour of South America, but found themselves short of players. The team subsequently invited players from other Scottish teams to travel, with Ferguson agreeing to take part. He scored eight goals in as many matches against opponents including Independiente, Pe\u00f1arol and a Uruguay XI. Ahead of the tour, the Athletic News wrote that Ferguson had been \"the most effective centre-forward in Great Britain\" during the early 1920s. During the following season, he was again among the top scorers early in the year and, by the end of October, had scored 12 goals leaving him trailing only Tom Jennings of Raith Rovers. Two weeks later, Ferguson was sent off in a 2\u20131 victory over Queen's Park after an altercation with an opposing defender where he retaliated against some rough play. He later received a reprimand from the Scottish Football Association but avoided any further punishment. Ferguson finished third in the scorers ranking, behind Dave Halliday and Jennings, registering 27 goals in 33 league appearances."]}, {"page": "List of Leeds United F.C. seasons", "response": ["|Tom Jennings", "|Tom Jennings", "|Tom JenningsJock White"]}, {"page": "List of Leeds United F.C. records and statistics", "response": ["#Tom Jennings 117"]}, {"page": "History of Leeds United F.C.", "response": ["The following season, 1929\u201330, Leeds finished 5th \u2013 the club's best position before the arrival of Don Revie.
