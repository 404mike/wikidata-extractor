In 2003, the film topped a poll of \"Best Film Endings\", but also topped a poll by Film 2003 as \"the worst movie of all time\". In his 2012 study of the lives of the passengers on the Titanic, historian Richard Davenport-Hines said, \"Cameron's film diabolized rich Americans and educated English, anathematizing their emotional restraint, good tailoring, punctilious manners and grammatical training, while it made romantic heroes of the poor Irish and the unlettered\". The British film magazine Empire reduced their rating of the film from the maximum five stars and an enthusiastic review, to four stars with a less positive review in a later edition, to accommodate its readers' tastes, who wanted to disassociate themselves from the hype surrounding the film, and the reported activities of its fans, such as those attending multiple screenings. In addition to this, positive and negative parodies and other such spoofs of the film abounded and were circulated on the internet, often inspiring passionate responses from fans of various opinions of the film. Benjamin Willcock of DVDActive.com did not understand the backlash or the passionate hatred for the film. \"What really irks me...,\" he said, \"are those who make nasty stabs at those who do love it.\" Willcock stated, \"I obviously don't have anything against those who dislike Titanic, but those few who make you feel small and pathetic for doing so (and they do exist, trust me) are way beyond my understanding and sympathy.\""]}, {"page": "Hitler Diaries", "response": ["At The Sunday Times, Murdoch moved Giles to the new position of \"editor emeritus\".

Some of his essays are of Victorian length. All of them reduce large subjects to their essence. Many of them... have lastingly transformed their fields.\" On the other hand, his biographer Adam Sisman also writes that \"the mark of a great historian is that he writes great books, on the subject which he has made his own. By this exacting standard Hugh failed.\"Adam Sisman, Hugh Trevor-Roper (2010) p. 375", "Trevor-Roper was born at Glanton, Northumberland, England, the son of Kathleen Elizabeth Davidson (died 1964) and Bertie William Edward Trevor-Roper (1885\u20131978), a doctor, descended from Henry Roper, 8th Baron Teynham, who married, Anne, (her second husband) 16th Baroness Dacre.Hugh Trevor-Roper: The Biography, Adam Sisman, Hachette, p. 1 Trevor-Roper \"enjoyed (but not too seriously)... that he was a collateral descendant of William Roper, the son-in-law and biographer of Sir Thomas More... as a boy he was aware that only a dozen lives (several of them those of elderly bachelors) separated him from inheriting the Teynham peerage.\"One Hundred Letters from Hugh Trevor-Roper, ed. Richard Davenport-Hines, Adam Sisman, Oxford University Press, Introduction", "Hugh Trevor-Roper was made a life peer in 1979 on the recommendation of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. He was raised to the Peerage on 27 September 1979, and was introduced to the House of Lords as Baron Dacre of Glanton, of Glanton in the County of Northumberland. He did not base his title on his surname, because \"double-barrelled titles are an invention, and a monopoly, of Wilsonian peers\", and \"under the rules of the College of Arms either ['Lord Trevor' or 'Lord Roper'] would require him to change his surname to either 'Trevor' or 'Roper.'\" On mentioning the family's connection to the Dacre title to his wife, who liked the sound of it, Trevor-Roper was persuaded to opt for the title of \"Baron Dacre\", despite staunch opposition from the suo jure 27th Baroness Dacre (n\u00e9e Brand). She had her cousin, Anthony Brand, 6th Viscount Hampden, \"as titular head of the Brand family\", inform Trevor-Roper that the Dacre title belonged to the Brand family \"and no-one else should breach their monopoly\", on the grounds of the title's antiquity of over six centuries. This high-handed treatment strengthened Trevor-Roper's resolve in the face of his initial ambivalence; he observed \"why should the Brands be so 'proud', or so jealous, of a mere title... a gewgaw, which has been bandied intermittently from family to family for six centuries, without tradition or continuity or distinction (except for murder, litigation and extravagance) or, for the last 250 years, land? They only acquired this pretty toy, in 1829, because a Mr Brand, of whom nothing whatever is known, had married into the Trevor-Ropers (who had themselves acquired it by marrying into the Lennards). Now they behave as if they had owned it for six centuries and had a monopoly of it for ever. A fig for their stuffiness!\" Notwithstanding objections, Trevor-Roper duly took the title of Baron Dacre of Glanton.One Hundred Letters from Hugh Trevor-Roper, ed.
