After two years of National Service, he was a regular in the county side in 1960 and made 1,000 runs for the first time in 1961, winning his cap in 1962. Thereafter he was a fixture in the side until he retired at the end of the 1983 season, and his record of scoring 1,000 runs in 23 seasons has been beaten by only 10 other cricketers. His total career aggregate of 36,049 runs put him 35th on the all-time list of run-getters and is the highest of any player who did not play Test cricket. (Perhaps not coincidentally, his Glamorgan colleague Don Shepherd holds the record for taking the most first class wickets without playing a test match). His 56 centuries in first-class cricket is exceeded only by John Langridge among non-Test players. In addition to these first-class runs, he also scored more than 7,000 runs in List A matches. He is the Glamorgan record holder for career runs and, jointly with Hugh Morris, for centuries."]}, {"page": "1963 in Wales", "response": ["*16 December \u2013 Hugh Morris, cricketer"]}, {"page": "Alun Evans (cricketer)", "response": ["Despite only playing one first-class match during 1997, he became a heavy scorer in the Second XI, at which point the retirement of Hugh Morris allowed the young Welshman to take his place as a regular opening batsman.

Smith, who had been batting at six, had sustained an injury in between the Third and Fourth tests: England's response was to drop Atherton down a place in the order - he had looked uncharacteristically fragile this series - also moving Hick, Lamb and Ramprakash down a place, and bring in Glamorgan's opener Hugh Morris for a Test debut (had Smith been fit, Morris would still have played, Lamb would have been dropped instead.) Lawrence was dropped to 12th man to make a place for Chris Lewis, another tall fast bowler with pretensions to all-rounder status. For West Indies, they were able to reverse the change they had been forced into at Lords, Patterson being fit again, and returning to replace Allen. England crashed to 188 all out: only Gooch (45) and Ramprakash (29, his own highest score) passing 20. West Indies, in return, passed England's score with only three wickets down, and reached 253/4 by the end of the second day, the pick of the batsmen being Richardson with a fine century. Even more worryingly, DeFreitas - pick of England's bowlers so far in the series - sustained an injury halfway through an over, was unable to complete it, and limped off."]}, {"page": "List of Glamorgan first-class cricket records", "response": ["| Most runs in a season for Glamorgan || 2,276 ||  Hugh Morris || || || 1990"]}, {"page": "Cricket in Wales", "response": ["The following Welsh people have played Test cricket for England: Johnnie Clay, Robert Croft, Jeff Jones, Simon Jones, Tony Lewis, Austin Matthews, Hugh Morris, Gilbert Parkhouse, Pat Pocock, Greg Thomas, Matthew Maynard, Maurice Turnbull, Cyril Walters, Steve Watkin and Allan Watkins.", "* Hugh Morris -: He played in three Tests for England in 1991."]}, {"page": "Vicarage Field, Aberystwyth", "response": ["| Hugh Morris (83 Runs for Glamorgan against Warwickshire in 1989"]}, {"page": "Hugh Morris", "response": ["Hugh Morris may refer to:", "*Hugh Morris (cricketer) (born 1963), Welsh former cricketer", "*Hugh Morris (Scottish footballer) (1900\u20131965), Scottish footballer ", "*Hugh Morris (Welsh footballer) (1872\u20131897), Welsh footballer", "*Hugh Morris (Australian footballer) (1932\u20132013), Australian rules footballer", "*Hugh Morris (businessman) (1929\u20132010), New Zealand businessman who founded McDonald's New Zealand in 1976"]}, {"page": "Tom Maynard", "response": ["His funeral was held at Llandaff Cathedral on 4 July, with more than 1,000 people in attendance, including England players past and present.

In total, he scored 883 runs at an average of 28.48, with a high score of 131. This innings of note came against Lancashire at Colwyn Bay in 1998. Though he struggled for consistency, he still made notable contributions to the Glamorgan cause, notably against Lancashire at Blackpool in 1999 when he held out against Muttiah Muralitharan for over four hours in making 53 in Glamorgan's second-innings, though Lancashire still won the game by 10 wickets. Law was utilised more in first-class cricket, making just nine further List A appearances following his debut in that format in 1997.
