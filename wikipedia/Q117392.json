He settled on A Clockwork Orange (1971) at the end of 1969, an exploration of violence and experimental rehabilitation by law enforcement authorities, based around the character of Alex (portrayed by Malcolm McDowell). Kubrick had received a copy of Anthony Burgess's novel of the same name from Terry Southern while they were working on Dr. Strangelove, but had rejected it on the grounds that Nadsat, a street language for young teenagers, was too difficult to comprehend. The decision to make a film about the degeneration of youth reflected contemporary concerns in 1969; the New Hollywood movement was creating a great number of films that depicted the sexuality and rebelliousness of young people. A Clockwork Orange was shot over 1970\u20131971 on a budget of \u00a32 million. Kubrick abandoned his use of CinemaScope in filming, deciding that the 1.66:1 widescreen format was, in the words of Baxter, an \"acceptable compromise between spectacle and intimacy\", and favored his \"rigorously symmetrical framing\", which \"increased the beauty of his compositions\". The film heavily features \"pop erotica\" of the period, including a giant white plastic set of male genitals, decor which Kubrick had intended to give it a \"slightly futuristic\" look. McDowell's role in Lindsay Anderson's if.... (1968) was crucial to his casting as Alex, and Kubrick professed that he probably would not have made the film if McDowell had been unavailable.", "Sexuality in Kubrick's films is usually depicted outside matrimonial relationships in hostile situations. Baxter states that Kubrick explores the \"furtive and violent side alleys of the sexual experience: voyeurism, domination, bondage and rape\" in his films. He further points out that films like A Clockwork Orange are \"powerfully homoerotic\", from Alex walking about his parents' flat in his Y-fronts, one eye being \"made up with doll-like false eyelashes\", to his innocent acceptance of the sexual advances of his post-corrective adviser Deltroid (Aubrey Morris). British critic Adrian Turner notes that Kubrick's films appear to be \"preoccupied with questions of universal and inherited evil\", and Malcolm McDowell referred to his humor as \"black as coal\", questioning his outlook on humanity. A few of his pictures were obvious satires and black comedies, such as Lolita and Dr. Strangelove; many of his other films also contained less visible elements of satire or irony. His films are unpredictable, examining \"the duality and contradictions that exist in all of us\". Ciment notes how Kubrick often tried to confound audience expectations by establishing radically different moods from one film to the next, remarking that he was almost \"obsessed with contradicting himself, with making each work a critique of the previous one\".", "Film author Patrick Webster considers Kubrick's methods of writing and developing scenes to fit with the classical auteur theory of directing, allowing collaboration and improvisation with the actors during filming. Malcolm McDowell recalled Kubrick's collaborative emphasis during their discussions and his willingness to allow him to improvise a scene, stating that \"there was a script and we followed it, but when it didn't work he knew it, and we had to keep rehearsing endlessly until we were bored with it\".", "Kubrick would devote his personal breaks to having lengthy discussions with actors. Among those who valued his attention was Tony Curtis, star of Spartacus, who said Kubrick was his favorite director, adding, \"his greatest effectiveness was his one-on-one relationship with actors.\" He further added, \"Kubrick had his own approach to film-making. He wanted to see the actor's faces. He didn't want cameras always in a wide shot twenty-five feet away, he wanted close-ups, he wanted to keep the camera moving. That was his style.\" Similarly, Malcolm McDowell recalls the long discussions he had with Kubrick to help him develop his character in A Clockwork Orange, noting that on set he felt entirely uninhibited and free, which is what made Kubrick \"such a great director\". Kubrick also allowed actors at times to improvise and to \"break the rules\", particularly with Peter Sellers in Lolita, which became a turning point in his career as it allowed him to work creatively during the shooting, as opposed to the preproduction stage."]}, {"page": "Star Trek Generations", "response": ["Star Trek Generations is a 1994 American science fiction film and the seventh film in the Star Trek film series.
