Sandanski is portrayed by them as an Ottomanist, and collaborationist of the Young Turks, seen as Bulgarian enemies, and as the man who started the fratricidal war into the IMRO. He has been accused also of being transformed himself from a revolutionary into a businessperson whose political motivation became only the money earning. On the contrary, in North Macedonia, the positive connotation of him, created in the times of Communist Yugoslavia is still alive. Since then the Macedonian historiography has emphasized the particularity of the IMRO's left wing,Igor Despot, The Balkan Wars in the Eyes of the Warring Parties: Perceptions and Interpretations; iUniverse, 2012, , p. 15. while in fact Yugoslav communism and Macedonian nationalism are closely related.Roumen Daskalov, Diana Mishkova as ed., Entangled Histories of the Balkans - Volume Two: Transfers of Political Ideologies and Institutions, BRILL, 2013, , p. 499.

This federalist project was supposed to include different ethnic sections in itself, but this idea failed and the only section that was created was the faction of Sandanski, called Bulgarian section.

These are the social strata whose interests today are the interests of the Bulgarian nationality in the Empire. We consider that these interests require, in the first place, the strengthening of the constitutional regime, the expansion of liberties and the extension of reforms in the administrative and economic system. Only in this way can we create conditions for the raising of the standard of living and the prosperity of the Bulgarians in the Empire. Excerpt from a leading article entitled 'Our Positions' in the newspaper Narodna Volya, explains the demands of the Bulgarian People's Federative Party; Newspaper Narodna Volya, Soloun, No. 1, Jan. 17th, 1909; the original is in Bulgarian. /The newspaper Narodna Volya subtitled 'Organ of the Bulgarian People's Federal Party,' was the organ of the left faction in the Macedonian-Adrianople movement at the time of the H\u00fcrriyet, prepared the ground ideologically for the founding of the People's Federative Party, the Bulgarian section of which was set up at the Congress in August 1909./ Macedonia: Documents and Materials. Sofia: Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, 1978.If this attitude were not peculiar and different in comparison with their attitude towards the other nationalities in the Empire, we would undoubtedly not even mention the name of the Bulgarian nationality to which we belong. Our basic principle is to struggle for the rights and liberties of all nationalities, without exception, and we strive for the complete equality of all the subjects of the Ottoman Empire, irrespective of nationality and religion. From this standpoint, we shall not hesitate, in the least, to come out in defence of any nationality, provided we are convinced that it is being discriminated against and is below the existing level of liberty and justice enjoyed by all other nationalities. We shall not hesitate either to turn against our own nationality, if it were given some advantages and privileges to the disadvantage of the other nationalities and if its privileged position compromised the regime of universal political and civil equality in the country. A newspaper article in Konstitoutsionna Zarya entitled 'The Peculiar Attitude of the Government towards the Bulgarian Nationality'. November 26th, 1908; the original is in Bulgarian. /A newspaper expressed the views of the left faction in the organization - the group of Yane Sandanski, after the Young Turk Revolution. At the beginning of 1909 it merged with the newspaper Edinstvo, and continued to appear under the name Narodna Volya./ Macedonia: Documents and Materials. Sofia: Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, 1978. In 1909 the group around Sandanski and Chernopeev participated in the rally of the Young Turks to Istanbul that led to the deposition of sultan Abdul Hamid II from the throne. Sandanski dreamed about the creation of a Balkan Federative Republic according to the plans of the Balkan Socialist Federation and Macedonia as a part of that Federation.On no account must the population be deceived into hoping for outside help. It must rely on its own forces, and the Organization\u2019s centre of gravity must be shifted from the cheti to the mass of the people, with the cheti acting chiefly as instructors and inspectors. All those who are \u2018discontented with the existing regime\u2019 must be brought into the Organization, and this must be understood as meaning not only Bulgarians, but all the nationalities inhabiting the Organization\u2019s territory. Balkan Federation is indicated as an ultimate solution of the national problem, as \u2018the sole way for the salvation of all\u2019.

The leaflet was found among the papers of Lazar Kolchagov of Bansko, and was published by Ivan Diviziev in Istoricheski Pregled, 1964, Book 4 (Nov Dokument za Yan\u00e9 Sandansky).", "In this way it would be possible to create a healthy system aimed at the organisation of a mass uprising.\"Long ago you are regarding our Macedonian-Adrianopole question only as Bulgarian question.

And I shall always remember that evening in 1913 when Sandansky came to me to confide his doubts and vacillations: \"There, look this always happens when someone is freed by force of arms!

In the same period a group around Petar Chaulev began negotiations with the Albanian revolutionaries. The temporary Albanian government proposed to them a common revolt to be organized and risen. The negotiations from the part of the Organization had to be carried by Petar Chaulev. The Bulgarian government believed however, that it would not come to a new war with Serbia, so it did not attend the negotiations. However, later, in June 1913 the Bulgarian government sent in Tirana Yane Sandanski for new negotiations. He gave an interview for the Italian newspaper \"Il Secolo\", where he said that he came to agreement with the Albanians and that from the Bulgarian side there would be organized bands and assaults. So he helped the preparation of the Ohrid-Debar Uprising, organised jointly by IMRO and the Albanians of Western Macedonia.\u0418\u0414\u0415\u042f\u0422\u0410 \u0417\u0410 \u0410\u0412\u0422\u041e\u041d\u041e\u041c\u0418\u042f \u041a\u0410\u0422\u041e \u0422\u0410\u041a\u0422\u0418\u041a\u0410 \u0412 \u041f\u0420\u041e\u0413\u0420\u0410\u041c\u0418\u0422\u0415 \u041d\u0410 \u041d\u0410\u0426\u0418\u041e\u041d\u0410\u041b\u041d\u041e\u041e\u0421\u0412\u041e\u0411\u041e\u0414\u0418\u0422\u0415\u041b\u041d\u041e\u0422\u041e \u0414\u0412\u0418\u0416\u0415\u041d\u0418\u0415 \u0412 \u041c\u0410\u041a\u0415\u0414\u041e\u041d\u0418\u042f \u0418 \u041e\u0414\u0420\u0418\u041d\u0421\u041a\u041e, 1893-1941, \u0414\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0442\u044a\u0440 \u0413\u043e\u0446\u0435\u0432, \u0418\u0437\u0434. \u043d\u0430 \u0411\u0410\u041d, \u0421\u043e\u0444\u0438\u044f, 1983; 1912- 1919 \u0433.

He came to regret these and other murders later.We went back. We told Yan\u00e9 what had happened, and he was silent as though struck dumb.

What do you think?\" \u2018What could I say to him? I was a simple chetnik. I\u2019m telling you, those were troubled times, and there was plenty of unnecessary bloodshed. . . As for Yan\u00e9, bright soul, he grieved over everything. As cited by Mercia MacDermott, For Freedom and Perfection.

At that time, the Supremists\u2014Ferdinand\u2019s generals, as we called them\u2014appeared in our part of the country as well. And they managed to get a foothold in the village of Lyubovka. \"We are not going to stand for this,\" Yan\u00e9 decided, and collected a group of us. \"Go and wake up Lyubovka! See to it that there\u2019s no bloodshed!\" (The words are quoted in the memoirs of his adherent Atanas Yanev and published in \"Eho\" newspaper, 26.05.1972) as cited by Mercia MacDermott, For Freedom and Perfection. The Life of Yane Sandansky p. 186. Because of that he was even sentenced to death by the Centralists. The Bulgarian authorities investigated the assassinations and suspected Sandanski was the main force behind them. On the other hand, he was amnestied by the Bulgarian Parliament after the support he gave to the Bulgarian Army during the Balkan wars. ", "While Sandanski's legacy remains disputed among Bulgarian and Macedonian historiography, there have been attempts among international scholars to reconcile his conflicting and controversial activity. According to the Turkish professor of history Mehmet Hac\u0131saliho\u011flu, who is interested  in nation-building in the late Ottoman Empire,Y\u0131ld\u0131z University, Department of Political Science and International Relations, Prof. Dr. Mehmet Hac\u0131saliho\u011flu. it is very difficult to find a definitive answers to some ticklish questions related to Sandanski's biography. Hac\u0131saliho\u011flu's opinion is that Sandanski was de facto a betrayer of the national Bulgarian interests in Macedonia, collaborating with the Young Turks, supporting the idea of the autonomy of the region into the Ottoman Empire, and opposing its incorporation into Bulgaria. That would allow him to maintain his political role, as one of the native leaders in the region. However, this does not mean, he regarded the Bulgarian Macedonian population as a separate Macedonian nation.Institut national des langues et civilisations orientales, Yane Sandanski as a political leader in Macedonia in the era of the Young Turks, Mehmet Hac\u0131saliho\u011flu, Cahiers balkaniques, issue 40, 2012: Jeunes-Turcs en Mac\u00e9doine et en Ionie. Also, all the main ideologists, who indoctrinated Sandanski with these leftist ideas, were socialists from Bulgaria proper.Igor Despot, The Balkan Wars in the Eyes of the Warring Parties: Perceptions and Interpretations, iUniverse, 2012, , p. 25. Mercia MacDermott who is author of a biographical book on Sandanski, has admitted she has had a real battle over such controversial figure.John B. Allcock, Antonia Young as ed., Black Lambs & Grey Falcons: Women Travellers in the Balkans, Berghahn Books, 2000, , p. 181. Nevertheless, she has described him as Bulgarian revolutionary, who under the influence of leftist ideas, tried to solve the Macedonian Question by uniting all the Balkan peoples.See abstract from the book \"For freedom and perfection: the life of Yan\u00e9 Sandansky\".

The founders had near at hand a volume of the Notes on the Bulgarian uprisings written by the Bulgarian revolutionary Zahari Stoyanov and an exemplar of the Statute of the Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee, and used them as a models. Petar Poparsov worked out a draft-Statute on the basis of this documents. For more see: Mercia MacDermott, Freedom Or Death: The Life of Gotse Delchev, Pluto Press, 1978, , p. 99.On the cover of the first statute of the Organization, which at the time was called  Bulgarian Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Committees, is depicted a woman holding a flag with her right hand, on which is written \"Svoboda ili smart\". She is leaning on a pedestal on which a standing Bulgarian lion with a crown is depicted. With her left hand she holds a shield on which \"Macedonia\" is written.
