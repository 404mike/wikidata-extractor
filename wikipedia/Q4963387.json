He is a past President of the Landscape Institute, the UK professional body for landscape architecture.  \nClouston started his professional career at Durham Council Council in 1960 but left in 1965 establishing BCP. The practice undertook large scale coal mine pit heap and derelict land reclamation projects in England in the 1960s and 1970s culminating in work on the reclamation of the Liverpool International Garden Festival (which as president of the Landscape Institute he had lobbied for) and Willow Tree Lane landfill reclamation project in Hillingdon, NW London.\nIn the 1970s his practice worked on landscape and reclamation projects throughout the Middle East, in particular in Jeddah and Riyadh in Saudi Arabia.  In the late 1970s Clouston established an office in Hong Kong which was managed by Alan Tate from which many large scale Landscape Design projects were completed, notably at Sha Tin Town Park.  Additional offices were opened in Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and in Sydney.  In the late 1980s the United Kingdom part of Clouston's company merged with RPS PLC, Clouston being Chairman until 1993. In the 1990s he pursued property development and was director of a number of property companies in the north of England [1] .\nHe was appointed OBE in the 1990 Birthday Honours.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of landscape architects", "response": ["* Brian Clouston"]}, {"page": "Judith Wright", "response": ["With David Fleay, Kathleen McArthur and Brian Clouston, Wright was a founding member and, from 1964 to 1976, President, of the Wildlife Preservation Society of Queensland.
