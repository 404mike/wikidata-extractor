To remember these names, the mnemonic yam\u0101t\u0101r\u0101jabh\u0101nasalag\u0101m is used, in which each three-syllable pattern occurs starting at its name: 'yam\u0101t\u0101' has a short\u2013long\u2013long pattern, 'm\u0101t\u0101r\u0101' has a long\u2013long\u2013long pattern, and so on, until 'salag\u0101m' which has a short\u2013short\u2013long pattern.

A stanza contains two short lines, each with less than fifteen characters. Longer poems, composed of many dwipada, can be composed with a \"highly musical\" effect. Much of the extant corpus in this form was written using the common language of the time. The form's musicality and accessibility made the form a natural fit for spreading religious messages. Palkurki Somanatha was the first to write in this form in the 12th or 13th century. His works Basava Puranam and Panditaradhya Charitra were \"immensely singable\" devotional works to Shiva as Basaveshwara. Influenced by Shaivaite poets' use of dwipada, a Vaishnavite poet wrote the Ranganadha Ramayana, a version of the Ramayana that became incredibly popular for its singability, vernacular diction, and stories not found in Valmiki's version. The form reached its apex with Palnati Vira Charitra, popularly ascribed to the 14th century poet Srinatha. By the end of the Prabandha era, the three most important Sanskrit poems had been translated into Telugu in dwipada: the Mahabharata by Thimmaya, the Ramayana by Ranganadha, and the Bhagavatam by Tekumalla Ranga Sai. The form declined after the dwipada works of the early 17th century king-poet Raghunatha Nayak of Tanjore. Dwipada's accessibility has sometimes meant it was not a prestigious form of Telugu poetry. In the 19th century, scholar Charles Philip Brown noted \"the learned despise couplets because the poems thus written are in a flowing easy style which uneducated persons read with enjoyment.\" Only a few writers today use it out of lingering respect its history."]}, {"page": "C.
