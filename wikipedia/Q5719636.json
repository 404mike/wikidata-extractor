Sir David Brewster found that Wollaston's form worked best when the two lenses were hemispheres and the central space was filled up with a transparent cement having the same refractive index as the glass. He therefore used a sphere from a single piece of glass with a deep groove cut in it.An Introduction To Applied Optics, Volume II, L. C. Martin, Sir Isaac Pitman & Sons, Ltd, London, 1932. In 1829, Henry Coddington brought the Wollaston\u2013Brewster lens into general notice and further refined the design by modifying the shape of the groove, though Coddington laid no claim to being its inventor.History of Science, Williams, Book 4, chapter V."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society A, B, C", "response": ["| Henry Coddington||12/02/1829||- 3 March 1845"]}, {"page": "William Lax", "response": ["When he arrived at St Ippolyts Lax had trees planted in the vicarage grounds in the form of his initials \"W L\". That same year he created a park opposite to the vicarage similar to The Backs of Cambridge, built a replica of Trinity College Bridge, dammed the stream and opened springs to form a lake which was used for ice skating in the winter. In September 1801 he married Margaret Cradock (11 June 1776 \u2013 20 January 1854) at the church in Gilling West in the North Riding of Yorkshire. Margaret was the eldest daughter of Sheldon Cradock of Hartforth who was the lord of the manor of Lax's home village of Ravensworth. Lax was a proposer of Robert Woodhouse, Henry Coddington, Herbert Marsh and John Bell for Royal Society fellowship, the latter being one of Lax's closest friends, and he was a keen supporter of George Biddell Airy throughout Airy's career. Lax was a chief supporter of the Whig John Romilly, 1st Baron Romilly's parliamentary bid. In 1824 Lax purchased a coat of arms for himself."]}, {"page": "Index of physics articles (H)", "response": ["*Henry Coddington"]}, {"page": "Charles Smith Bird", "response": ["Bird went back in 1815 to Macclesfield grammar school, under David Davies (1755\u20131828).
