He had 50 dismissals in the 1891 season, the most by any wicket-keeper that year in English first-class cricket. Although he was unable to repeat his effort of effecting the most dismissals the following season, 1892, he did finish with the most stumpings. Other first-class teams that he played for during his career include AJ Webbe's XI, CI Thornton's XI and the Gentlemen of England.On the rugby field, Kemble played for Liverpool. A forward, he was capped three times for England. He made two appearances in the 1885 Home Nations Championship, both of which England won. His other Test cap came against Ireland in the 1887 Home Nations.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Kemble", "response": ["* Arthur Kemble (1862\u20131925), English cricketer and rugby union player"]}, {"page": "Liverpool St Helens F.C.", "response": ["* Arthur Kemble 1885"]}, {"page": "West Indian cricket team in England in 1900", "response": ["Lebrun Constantine was given out in this match when a ball played by him lodged in his leg guard.
