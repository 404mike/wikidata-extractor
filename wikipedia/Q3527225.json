He selected the heaviest bat from the batch that his team-mate brought out and stated \"Now I'm going to have a hit\". His rate of scoring and boundary-hitting subsequently increased. He possessed powerful hands, strong forearms and broad shoulders. Leg spinning Test team-mate Arthur Mailey recalled that Macartney would often hit him for six in Sydney Grade Cricket matches. Grinning, he would say \"Pitch another one there and I'll hit you for a few more\".
