Prior to that he was a Senior Youth Coach Developer at the Football Association, previously he was Academy Manager at Bristol Rovers and Technical Director at the Antigua and Barbuda Football Association.\nCurtis has previously played for several Football League clubs, and is perhaps best remembered for his seven-year spell at Chesterfield, where he played more than 250 games and was part of the Spireites' memorable cup run of 1996\u201397, where they reached the semi-finals, with Curtis scoring the winner from the penalty spot in Chesterfield's upset victory against Nottingham Forest. Curtis was signed by Chesterfield manager John Duncan at a time when the young footballer was undertaking a university course. Between the player and his manager, a situation was settled upon whereby Tom could continue his education whilst training with the Spireites part-time. His other clubs include Mansfield Town, Chester City (both in a Player/Coach role), Notts County and Portsmouth.\nWhile playing at Mansfield Town, Chester City, Nuneaton Borough and Alfreton Town, he was given the captaincy. At Mansfield, Curtis helped them to the 2004 Third Division Play-off Final. In the semi finals, Curtis' goal in the second leg against Northampton took the game to a penalty shootout, which Mansfield went on to win. The final against Huddersfield also went to penalties, however this time Mansfield lost and were thus denied promotion. Curtis' only other goal for Mansfield came in the FA Cup against Bishop's Stortford. Whilst at Chester, Curtis scored once in a 3\u20131 win over Barnet in October 2005.Curtis was appointed as the head coach of Loughborough University Football Team in 2007, leading the team to various trophies in his four years in the role.\nDuring his tenure Loughborough University entered the National Football Pyramid at step 6 and were quickly promoted to step 5, part of his role included the design and acquisition of the Loughborough University football stadium, which provides a home for the scholars today.\nIn April 2008, he was appointed as the assistant coach to the English Universities squad for the 2008\u201309 season.\nIn March 2011, Curtis took up the role of technical director and head coach of the Antigua and Barbuda Football Association. With the job, comes the task of managing Antigua's sole professional team, Antigua Barracuda, in their first season in the United Soccer Leagues Professional Division (the third tier of United States Soccer).\nAntigua and Barbuda rose to 79 in the world and reached the semi final stages of CONCACAF world cup qualification during his stay, by far and away the most successful period in the nations footballing history. Narrow losses to USA and Jamaica meant that they were unable to make the final hexagonal stages.\nOn 23 October 2012, he resigned from his position as Antigua and Barbuda national team coach and from Antigua Barracuda.In November 2012 Curtis returned to the UK to take up the role of academy manager at Bristol Rovers, his under-18 team remained unbeaten all season, winning both Youth Alliance League and Cup.\nIn December 2014 he was appointed a Senior Youth coach Developer for the Football Association. On 26 August 2021, Curtis was confirmed as head coach of the England U17s.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Antigua and Barbuda national football team", "response": ["=== (2011\u20132012) Historical run in 2014 World Cup qualifying (Tom Curtis Era) ===", "thumb|350px|right|Kerry Skepple about to score the game-winning goal versus Haiti on 11 November 2011 to advance to the third round of CONCACAF World Cup qualifying.Antigua and Barbuda led by Tom Curtis made a historic run to the third round of CONCACAF qualifying for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. They received a bye from the first round of CONCACAF qualifiers and were grouped with the U.S. Virgin Islands, Cura\u00e7ao and Haiti in the second round. Their first match was at home to Cura\u00e7ao. After conceding the first goal, the Benna Boys came back to win the match 5\u20132. Next, Antigua and Barbuda played away to the U.S. Virgin Islands and won convincingly 8\u20131. In their third fixture, Antigua and Barbuda had to play a tricky away match at Cura\u00e7ao. Tamarley Thomas scored the game-winning goal in the 73rd minute to give Antigua and Barbuda all 3 points. Up next in their fourth fixture of the second round was a home match versus the U.S. Virgin Islands. Antigua and Barbuda wasted little time before scoring the opening goal. In this match, the Benna Boys made history with an emphatic 10\u20130 win that saw Peter Byers and Tamarley Thomas both scoring hat-tricks. This was the biggest win in Antigua and Barbuda football history. While Antigua and Barbuda easily beat the U.S. Virgin Islands, Cura\u00e7ao drew away at Haiti. This meant that Haiti needed at least a draw in their next match in Antigua to stay alive in the competition. On 11 November 2011, Antigua and Barbuda played versus Haiti at home. This match proved difficult for the Benna Boys. For large spells of the match Haiti had majority of the possession and almost scored on a number of occasions including hitting the post twice in the first half. In the second half, Haiti was content on settling for a draw knowing that the next match was in Port-au-Prince and would be favoured to win. In the 82nd minute, Antigua and Barbuda opened up the deadlock with a strike from Kerry Skepple. After the goal, Haiti pressed for the equalizer and forced goalkeeper Molvin James to make some terrific saves. Antigua and Barbuda won this match 1\u20130 and advanced to the third round of CONCACAF qualifying thus eliminating Haiti with a game to spare. In the final match, the Benna Boys lost in the return leg in Haiti 2\u20131. Winning this group saw Antigua and Barbuda's FIFA World ranking go to 83rd, their highest ever at the time.", "|style=\"text-align: left;\"| Tom Curtis"]}, {"page": "Paul Davis (footballer, born 1961)", "response": ["On 26 August 2021, Davis was confirmed as an assistant coach for the England U17s working with Tom Curtis and Omer Riza."]}, {"page": "Antigua and Barbuda Football Association", "response": ["| Tom Curtis"]}, {"page": "Tom Curtis", "response": ["Tom Curtis may refer to:", "* Tom Curtis (American football) (born 1947), American football player", "* Tom Curtis (footballer) (born 1973), English soccer player"]}, {"page": "Omer Riza", "response": ["On 26 August 2021, Riza was confirmed as an assistant coach for the England U17s working with Tom Curtis and Paul Davis.

In the final minute of the match, Northampton were reduced to ten men when Ashley Westwood was sent off for a foul on Colin Larkin, and the match ended 2\u20130.

He scored a brace as they knocked out Bristol City in the third round, and went on to win the decisive penalty which teammate Tom Curtis tucked away against Nottingham Forest in the fifth round of the competition. He also found himself at the centre of controversy when, in the semi-final which saw the Spireites up against Middlesbrough F.C at Old Trafford, he took a shot which hit the underside of the crossbar and appeared to cross the line and yet the goal was never given.
