A revised and expanded version of the work was re-recorded in 1997 and named Glad Day. In 1982, at the insistence of the anti-nuclear campaigner E. P. Thompson, Westbrook recorded \"The Human Abstract\" as a single for CND. The cover carried an extract from Thompson's 1980 protest pamphlet Protest and Survive and the single included a poetry/graphic insert designed by Kate Westbrook and Michael Kustow.", "The Brass Band also recorded Mama Chicago, described as a \"Jazz Cabaret\", which featured the voices of Phil Minton and Kate Westbrook. The album was released on CD for the first time in 2007. More recently Mike Westbrook has developed the work further and it now includes an adult choir and on occasion, a children's choir at live performances.", "He continues to produce jazz scores, many for the theatre with his wife, the singer/songwriter Kate Westbrook. He was featured in the 2003 BBC documentary Jazz Britannia.", "More recent projects include Fine 'n Yellow, a piece written in celebration of the lives of Margery and John Styles, two friends who were founders of the Westbrook newsletter, The Smith's Academy Informer. The piece was recorded and CD copies were given to subscribers of the newsletter. It has since had a general CD release. Kate and Mike were once again joined by saxophonists Pete Whyman and Chris Biscoe. Steve Berry played bass and Jon Hiseman featured on drums. The piece received its first public performance in a concert that marked Mike Westbrook's 75th birthday at Kings Place in London on 2 April 2011. The musicians at the performance with Kate and Mike Westbrook were Chris Biscoe, Chris Caldwell and Andy Tweed, saxophones; Karen Street, saxophone and accordion; Steve Berry, bass; and Simon Pearson, drums. Another work was premiered at this concert, The Serpent Hit, which used the above musicians but without Steve Berry. The Serpent Hit, like Fine 'n Yellow, has texts by Kate Westbrook and music by Mike Westbrook. Yet another project finds Mike working with some of the finest west country musicians in The Mike Westbrook Big Band. They play a number of Westbrook originals and Mike's arrangements of pieces by Duke Ellington and others."]}, {"page": "Z\u00fclf\u00fc Livaneli", "response": ["Livaneli has composed some three hundred songs, a rhapsody recorded by London Symphony Orchestra\u2013, and a ballet.
