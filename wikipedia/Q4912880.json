Early in the game, England international goalkeeper Jack Robinson damaged his right hand, attempting to prevent a goal from Billy Langham, City's outside-right. Whilst Robinson was receiving medical attention, Harry Haynes took over in goal, preventing further goals until Robinson's return. Robinson played on in considerable pain but was unable to prevent the ball entering the goal off the cross bar from a Langham free-kick; thus the first half ended with Bristol City having a 2\u20130 lead."]}, {"page": "William Langham", "response": ["*Billy Langham"]}, {"page": "List of Doncaster Rovers F.C. players (1879\u20131918)", "response": ["*Forward: Billy Langham"]}, {"page": "List of Doncaster Rovers F.C. seasons", "response": ["|bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\"|Billy Langham"]}]}}
