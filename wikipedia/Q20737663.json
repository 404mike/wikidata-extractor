Alison de Vere, who had made \"Cafe Bar\" in 1975, was one of the first independent women animators to make an impact: \"Mr Pascal\" (1979) gained the Grand Prix at the Annecy Festival, and her masterpiece \"The Black Dog\" (1987) won many awards. Other women who began to emerge during the 1970s, making films with overtly feminist and political themes, include Leeds Animation Workshop (a women's collective), founded in 1978 and still in production after more than forty years; and Vera Neubauer, also still working today after almost five decades.", "As a public service broadcaster formed under the remit to cater to the \"tastes and interests not generally catered for\" within pre-existing media, Channel 4 was a fundamental supporter of fringe media on British broadcast TV, pushing for increased representations of underexposed issues of ethnicity and sexuality, as well as fostering political critique and artistic experimentation. This, coupled with a political climate that fostered a strong cultural response from more leftist groups, provided a fertile environment for work produced by many animators who had been working on the fringes, including that of Aardman, Joanna Quinn, Alison de Vere, David Anderson, The Quay Brothers, Paul Vester, Phil Mulloy and others.Norris, Van. British Television 1997-2010: Drawing Comic Tradition. Palgrave Macmillan, 2014, p. 31 In addition to providing exposure and monetary support, this fostering of fringe animators allowed many of these animators to make contact with the wider artistic and entertainment community of the UK, thereby creating strong ties in particular between animators, stand-up performers working within the alternative comedy movement, and writers and producers of live-action programming."]}, {"page": "33rd British Academy Film Awards", "response": ["* Mr. Pascal \u2013 Alison de Vere"]}, {"page": "2001 in animation", "response": ["* January 2: Alison de Vere, British animator, background designer (worked for Halas and Batchelor, The Beatles, Yellow Submarine, The Animals of Farthing Wood) and director (The Black Dog, Psyche and Eros), dies at age 73."]}, {"page": "Alison Weschke", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alison de Vere"]}, {"page": "Alison De Vere", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alison de Vere"]}, {"page": "Alison DeVere", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alison de Vere"]}, {"page": "Submissions for Best Animated Short Academy Award", "response": ["*Mr. Pascal (Alison de Vere) "]}, {"page": "Women Make Film", "response": ["* The Black Dog \u00a0\u2013 Alison de Vere", "* Mr Pascal \u00a0\u2013 Alison de Vere", "* The Black Dog \u00a0\u2013 Alison de Vere", "* Mr Pascal \u00a0\u2013 Alison de Vere"]}]}}
