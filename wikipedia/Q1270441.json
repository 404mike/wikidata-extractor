He became a supporter of Irish Republicanism and smuggled guns into Ireland in his sailing yacht Asgard. He was executed by the authorities of the nascent Irish Free State during the Irish Civil War. He was the son of British Orientalist scholar Robert Caesar Childers; the cousin of Hugh Childers and Robert Barton; and the father of the fourth President of Ireland, Erskine Hamilton Childers.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Erskine Hamilton Childers", "response": ["His father Robert Erskine Childers, a leading Irish republican and author of the espionage thriller The Riddle of the Sands, was executed during the Irish Civil War.", "Childers was born in the Embankment Gardens, Westminster, London, to a Protestant family, originally from Glendalough, County Wicklow, Ireland. Although also born in England, his father, Robert Erskine Childers, had an Irish mother and had been raised by an uncle in County Wicklow, and after the First World War took his family to live there. His mother, Molly Childers was a Bostonian whose ancestors arrived on the Mayflower. Robert Erskine Childers and his wife, Molly, later emerged as prominent and outspoken Irish Republican opponents of the political settlement with Britain, which resulted in the establishment of the Irish Free State.Young, John N., Erskine H. Childers, President of Ireland: A Biography (Gerrards Cross and Atlantic Highlands, N.J.: Colin Smythe, 1985, ), pp. 5\u20137 Childers was educated at Gresham's School, Holt,Young, op. cit., p. 18Benson, S. G.

In 1922, when Childers was sixteen, his father was executed by the new Irish Free State on politically-inspired charges of gun-possession. The pistol he had been found with had been given to him by Michael Collins. Before his execution, in a spirit of reconciliation, the elder Childers obtained a promise from his son to seek out and shake the hand of every man who had signed his death warrant. After attending his father's funeral, Childers returned to Gresham's, then two years later he went on to Trinity College, Cambridge."]}]}}
