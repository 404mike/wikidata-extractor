Since leaving the band in 1968, Cale has released 16 solo studio albums, including the widely acclaimed Paris 1919 and Music for a New Society.

Cale thought his sensibilities meshed well with Lou Reed's, who was already experimenting with alternate tunings. For instance, Reed had \"invented\" the ostrich guitar tuning for a song he wrote called \"The Ostrich\" for the short-lived band the Primitives. Ostrich guitar tuning consists of all strings being tuned to the same note. This method was utilized on the songs \"Venus in Furs\" and \"All Tomorrow's Parties\". Often, the guitars were also tuned down a whole step, which produced a lower, fuller sound that Cale considered \"sexy\".", "In January 2012, the \"Velvet Underground\" business partnership (of which John Cale and Lou Reed were general partners) sued The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York after the Foundation licensed the cover's banana design to Incase Designs for use on a line of iPhone and iPad cases.
