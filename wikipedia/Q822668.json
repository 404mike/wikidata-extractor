Because Oxyrhynchus was not considered an Ancient Egyptian site of any importance, it was neglected until 1896, when two young excavators, Bernard Pyne Grenfell and Arthur Surridge Hunt, both fellows of The Queen's College, Oxford, began to excavate it. \"My first impressions on examining the site were not very favourable,\" wrote Grenfell. \"The rubbish mounds were nothing but rubbish mounds.\"Quoted in A.M. Luijendijk, \"Sacred Scriptures as Trash: Biblical Papyri from Oxyrhynchus\" Vigiliae Christianae, 2010. However, they very soon realized what they had found. The unique combination of climate and circumstance had left at Oxyrhynchus an unequalled archive of the ancient world. \"The flow of papyri soon became a torrent,\" Grenfell recalled. \"Merely turning up the soil with one's boot would frequently disclose a layer.\""]}, {"page": "Eric Gardner Turner", "response": ["* Bernard Pyne Grenfell, Arthur Surridge Hunt, Eric Gardner Turner (eds.): The Hibeh papyri.

At this time, archaeology as a pursuit of knowledge was wholly unheard of, and papyri and other artifacts were treated more as items to collect. Also during this time (i.e., the late 19th and early 20th centuries), excavators were almost solely interested in artifacts dating to the older dynasties, and Graeco-Roman sites such as Karanis continued to be plundered for sebbakh until Francis W. Kelsey, a professor of Latin language and literature at the University of Michigan, observed this devastation and received grants to search for an excavation site in 1924. Starting excavations of Karanis in 1925, his goal was to \"increase exact knowledge rather than the amassing of collections\", with a focus on common people.Gazda 2-5 The papyri collected are now part of the University of Michigan Papyrus Collection.
