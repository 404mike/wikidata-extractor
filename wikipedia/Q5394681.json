Roberts spent his whole career at Bristol City playing in the Third Division South making 24 appearances in 1938\u201339 and 3 appearances in 1939\u201340 before the war. During the war he made a further 205 wartime appearances before emerging, after the war when League football recommenced, as the regular centre half and captain for several seasons. Roberts was ever present in 1946\u201347 with 42 appearances and played regularly in each of the next four seasons with 38 appearances, 41 appearances, 39 appearances and 41 appearances in season 1950\u201351 when Roberts captained the \"Robins\" to the 5th round of the FA Cup where they lost 0\u20132 at Birmingham City. Roberts was ever present again in 1951\u201352 and scored his first goal in a 1\u20131 draw with Plymouth Argyle on Boxing Day. Ernie Peacock who eventually succeeded Roberts at centre half started playing alongside Roberts at right half in February 1950. Bristol City had been languishing too long in the lower reaches of the Third Division South and when Roberts was seriously injured in 1952\u201353, manager Pat Beasley signed Jack White from Aldershot in October 1952 immediately appointing White as captain. Roberts made 17 appearances scoring 1 goal in 1952\u201353 playing centre half alongside wing halves Peacock and White again in early 1953\u201354 making his final 15 appearances as City rose to 7th in the table by November."]}, {"page": "Jack White (footballer, born 1924)", "response": ["White, a former miner, played locally for Broadworth Main and Frickley Colliery in Yorkshire. He signed for Aldershot from Sheffield FC in July 1944. Pat Beasley signed White in October 1952 from Aldershot for \u00a35,300 for Bristol City. Jack White immediately displaced Dennis Roberts both at the heart of the defence and as captain of the side. Jack White made his Bristol City debut at centre half in a 4\u20130 win v Gillingham on 11 October 1952. Bristol City briefly reached 2nd place during the 1952\u201353 season but finished in 5th position. White made 33 appearances scoring 4 goals in his first season with Bristol City. The following season 1953\u201354 Bristol City rose to 3rd place as Jack White initially played a mixture of centre half and left back when Dennis Roberts returned to the side. He spent the second half of that season at left half when Ernie Peacock and Terry Compton held the centre half position. White made 40 appearances scoring 3 goals including one goal in a 5\u20132 win at Aldershot. Jack White captained Bristol City to the Third Division South championship in 1954\u201355 when White was ever present making 46 appearances scoring 2 goals whilst playing in all three half back positions. In the Second Division in 1955\u201356 Jack White made 41 appearances scoring 1 goal missing only one match and playing mainly at right half alongside Peacock at centre half and Cyril Williams at left half.
