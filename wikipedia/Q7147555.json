This was followed by political philosophy at the University of Durham, where he earned an MA in Social Sciences in 1972 as a member of the Graduate Society. He then became a lecturer in economics at the University of Ulster, and in 1978 also took up a post at the Irish Baptist College.  He wrote a number of books on politics and economics in Northern Ireland.Roche joined the UK Unionist Party (UKUP) and headed their list in South Belfast for the Northern Ireland Forum election in 1996, but was not elected.At the 1998 Northern Ireland Assembly election, Roche was elected in Lagan Valley. With three of the other four UKUP members in the Assembly, he left in January 1999, disagreeing with leader Robert McCartney's policy of resigning from the Assembly should Sinn F\u00e9in become part of the power sharing executive.   They formed the Northern Ireland Unionist Party (NIUP), and Roche became deputy leader.During his time in the Assembly, Roche proposed a motion on sectarianism. During the debate, he called Sinn F\u00e9in MLA Gerry Kelly a convicted murderer. Kelly was convicted of conspiracy to cause an explosion in London in 1973, but not murder. He pointed this out, and when Roche refused to withdraw his comment, he was ordered to leave the chamber. Roche did not contest his seat at the 2003 election, at which the NIUP lost all its seats.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Northern Ireland Unionist Party", "response": ["The Northern Ireland Unionist Party (NIUP) was a small political party in Northern Ireland. It was formed in January 1999 as a splinter party from the UK Unionist Party (UKUP). This split was caused by disagreement between the five UKUP members of the Northern Ireland Assembly. Four of the members disagreed with UKUP leader Robert McCartney's policy of resigning from the Assembly should Sinn F\u00e9in become part of the power-sharing executive. Cedric Wilson, Patrick Roche, Norman Boyd and Roger Hutchinson disagreed with McCartney, wanting to remain in the Assembly to challenge unionists in favour of the Belfast Agreement. McCartney disciplined these members in their absence and, in response, they left the UKUP and formed the NIUP. Led by Wilson, the new party argued that it had the support of the grassroots membership of the UKUP, but McCartney disputed this."]}, {"page": "Robert McCartney (Northern Irish politician)", "response": ["He opposed the subsequent Belfast Agreement in the May 1998 referendum and his party won five seats in the Assembly elections later that year (McCartney himself in North Down, Cedric Wilson in Strangford, Patrick Roche in Lagan Valley, Norman Boyd in South Antrim and Roger Hutchinson in East Antrim)."]}, {"page": "Northern Ireland Forum", "response": ["|Robert McCartney, Cedric Wilson, Conor Cruise O'Brien, Patrick Roche, Ronnie Crawford, Alan Field, Valerie Kinghan, Stephen Nicholl, Graeme Jardin, Freda Woods"]}, {"page": "Provisional Irish Republican Army campaign", "response": ["Some authors, including Brendan O'Brien, Patrick McCarthy, Peter Taylor, Tom Hayden, Fergus Finlay and Timothy J.
