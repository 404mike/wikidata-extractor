He moved to London in 1974 and studied fine art at Hornsey Art College from 1977 to 1980, where Adam Ant was his contemporary. He became an assistant to the photographer Red Saunders in 1980 and soon branched out as a photographer in his own right, primarily in the pop music business. From 1981 to 1986 he was one of the main photographers for \"Smash Hits\" magazine where his friend Neil Tennant was assistant editor.\nWhen Tennant formed the Pet Shop Boys with Chris Lowe, Watson took the first photographs of them and was their main photographer and video director from 1984 to 1991.The first video he directed was \"Opportunities (Let's Make Lots of Money)\" for the Pet Shop Boys in 1985, his co-director being Andy Morahan. He subsequently directed a series of Pet Shop Boys videos, including \"Suburbia\", \"What Have I Done to Deserve This?\", \"Domino Dancing\", \"So Hard\" and \"DJ Culture\".\nWatson also directed videos for a number of other pop artists including Holly Johnson and Yaz before concentrating on TV commercials.He exhibited his photographs at the Blue Gallery in London and in the \"Icons of Pop\" exhibition of 1999 at the National Portrait Gallery. His photographs of the Pet Shop Boys were displayed at the National Portrait Gallery in London in 2006.In later years Watson worked as Head of Photography at a small school located in Rye, East Sussex.On 18 March 2012, Watson died after suffering a heart attack.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Pet Shop Boys", "response": ["In 1992, Pet Shop Boys were the subjects of a South Bank Show documentary on ITV. This included interviews with Neil and Chris, and contributions from Liza Minnelli, Eric Watson (photographer and video director), Simon Frith (music critic), David Alden and David Fielding.", "The duo have always been interested in the artwork, design and photography of their own releases. Photographer Eric Watson helped shape the original image of Pet Shop Boys, creating many of their photographs and videos from 1984 to 1991. In design they have primarily worked with Mark Farrow, who designed the cover of their first Parlophone album release in 1986. The collaboration between Mark Farrow and Pet Shop Boys is comparable to the designer/band relationship of Peter Saville and New Order, Anton Corbijn and Depeche Mode, or the epic-length collaboration of Simon Halfon and Paul Weller. Their record sleeves are quite often very minimal and the attention to detail is obvious. In October 2006, British art publisher Thames & Hudson published a 336-page hardcover book titled Pet Shop Boys Catalogue, by Chris Heath and Philip Hoare, showcasing the group's accomplishments in artwork, design and music. A German-language edition was also published. An exhibition of photographs of Pet Shop Boys was organised at the National Portrait Gallery in London to coincide with the publication."]}, {"page": "Chris Lowe", "response": ["A Guardian profile of the group from 1993 noted that Lowe's image of \"silent Chris walking two steps behind singing Neil\" was an intentional choice, developed in discussion with photographer and music video director Eric Watson; Watson has commented that \"Chris didn't want to be seen playing keyboards or anything. We realised there was something about somebody singing and somebody else doing nothing \u2013 just looking, then looking away \u2013 that adds a hideous tension.\""]}, {"page": "Nightlife (Pet Shop Boys album)", "response": ["* Eric Watson \u2013 inside photography"]}, {"page": "Please (Pet Shop Boys album)", "response": ["* Eric Watson \u2013 cover photograph, inner sleeve photographs"]}, {"page": "Actually", "response": ["* Eric Watson \u2013 inner sleeve photograph"]}, {"page": "Behaviour (Pet Shop Boys album)", "response": ["The video was directed by Eric Watson.
