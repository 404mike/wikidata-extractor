She was, with Elsie Inglis, one of the initial entrants to  the Edinburgh School of Medicine for Women, set up by Sophia Jex-Blake in 1886. Her determination and character were demonstrated by her standing up to Jex-Blake over a disciplinary matter, being dismissed from the school and subsequently successfully suing Jex-Blake and her school. Her career as a Scottish pioneer physician, surgeon was devoted mainly to the care of women and children. She became an active suffragette as was well known for public acts of defiance in the cause of women's suffrage. She was prominent in providing medical care and refuge for her fellow suffragettes, some of whom were released into her care directly from episodes of force feeding in prison. Her home became well known as a sanctuary for suffragettes.", "link_mentions": {}}}
