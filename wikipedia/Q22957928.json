She was, with Elsie Inglis, one of the initial entrants to  the Edinburgh School of Medicine for Women, set up by Sophia Jex-Blake in 1886. Her determination and character were demonstrated by her standing up to Jex-Blake over a disciplinary matter, being dismissed from the school and subsequently successfully suing Jex-Blake and her school. Her career as a Scottish pioneer physician, surgeon was devoted mainly to the care of women and children. She became an active suffragette as was well known for public acts of defiance in the cause of women's suffrage. She was prominent in providing medical care and refuge for her fellow suffragettes, some of whom were released into her care directly from episodes of force feeding in prison. Her home became well known as a sanctuary for suffragettes.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Elsie Inglis", "response": ["Inglis's father was religious and used his position in India to \u201cencourage native economic development, spoke out against infanticide and promoted female education.\" Inglis's maternal grandfather was Rev Henry Simson of the Garioch in Aberdeenshire.Simson/Inglis graves Dean Cemetery She was a cousin to the gynaecologist Sir Henry Simson, as well as fellow female medical student Grace Cadell."]}, {"page": "Edinburgh Seven", "response": ["*Grace Cadell"]}, {"page": "Muckhart", "response": ["* Dr Grace Cadell (1855\u20131918), militant suffragette and Scotland's first female surgeon; lived her final years at Mosspark, Yetts of Muckhart"]}, {"page": "Edinburgh School of Medicine for Women", "response": ["The Edinburgh School of Medicine for Women was founded by Sophia Jex-Blake in Edinburgh, Scotland, in October of 1886, with support from the National Association for Promoting the Medical Education of Women. Sophia Jex-Blake was appointed as both the Director and the Dean of the School. The first class of women to study at the Edinburgh School of Medicine for Women consisted of eight students, the youngest of whom was nineteen years of age. Throughout its twelve years in operation, the school struggled to find financial funding to remain open. A  rival institution, the Edinburgh College of Medicine for Women, set up by  Elsie Inglis with the help of her father John Inglis,  attracted several students of Jex-Blake, including Martha Cadell and  Grace Cadell. St Mungo's College and Queen Margaret College in Glasgow also accepted women medical students and when the Scottish universities began to do so the Edinburgh School of Medicine could no longer compete. The school closed in 1898. Over the twelve years of its operation, the Edinburgh School of Medicine provided education to approximately eighty female students. Of those eighty students, thirty-three completed the full course of medical training at the Edinburgh School while many others chose to finish their education at outside institutions.", "Jex-Blake's uncompromising approach to discipline led to problems. She was a strict rule enforcer and maintained high expectations for her students. She established strict guidelines for acceptable behavior and conduct during lectures, examinations, and training at the hospital. The academic demands Jex-Blake imposed on her students and her disciplinary persona created a level of tension between the students and herself. Tension came to a head when Jex-Blake expelled two sisters studying at the School without proper grounds. When the two sisters\u2014Ina (Martha Georgina) and Grace Cadell\u2014won the court case challenging their expulsion, the bad publicity meant that both the school and Jex-Blake herself lost support, and some students moved to Glasgow, London and Dublin; the only other places in Great Britain or Ireland where women could study medicine at that time.", "Elsie Inglis left the School and, with the help of her father John Inglis,  Ina Cadell, and Grace Cadell, set up an alternative nearby: the Edinburgh College of Medicine for Women. Jex-Blake wanted to be involved there too, but met resistance, while her relations with Leith Hospital were also becoming strained. The female students would soon be allowed to gain practical experience at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, previously blocked to them."]}, {"page": "Cadell", "response": ["* Grace Cadell (1855\u20131918), one of the first female surgeons, Scottish suffragette"]}, {"page": "Rumbling Bridge", "response": ["*Dr Grace Cadell (1855\u20131918), Scotland's first female surgeon and an active leader of the suffragettes lived her final years at Mosspark, Rumbling Bridge, and died there in 1918."]}, {"page": "Women in medicine", "response": ["*Grace Cadell (1855-1918) and Marion Gilchrist (1864-1952) were the first women to qualify as doctors in Scotland respectively in 1891 and 1894."]}, {"page": "Leith Walk", "response": ["*Grace Cadell (1855-1918), Scotland's first female surgeon.

Despite the many well wishers, she was so weak that she only allowed visits from Dr Mabel Jones or her Broughty Ferry friend, Enid Rennie, who had written to Dr. Devon who had been the lead prison doctor who latterly conducted the force feeding, that it was  'a permanent blot on the record of so many fights for liberty in which Scotland has hitherto born a noble part'. Elizabeth Gauld, Janie Allan and others wrote to object and his responses showed he would prefer to consider her 'mad'.  The arson at Whitekirk Church was said by Allan to be a revenge for Moorhead's treatment. Her prison force feeding experiences - duly related to the presscaused much protest at the cruelty involved. Her treatment and resultant activism was raised in Parliament, the Secretary of State asked on two occasions about the treatment and 'her life being endangered'.
