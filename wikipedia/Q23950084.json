He published in 1837 the first article referred to an ovariectomy performed in England and first described the picture of a kind of infantile spasm (present in his own son, James Edwin West) in an article published by The Lancet in 1841. this syndrome is typically characterized by three findings: epileptic spasms, psychomotor retardation and electroencephalogram with a characteristic layout of hypsarrhythmia, although one of the three may not appear.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Epileptic spasms", "response": ["Epileptic spasms, is an uncommon-to-rare epileptic disorder in infants, children and adults. One of the other names of the disorder, West syndrome, is named after the English physician, William James West (1793\u20131848), who first described it in an article published in The Lancet in 1841. The original case actually described his own son, James Edwin West (1840\u20131860). Other names for it are \"generalized flexion epilepsy\", \"infantile epileptic encephalopathy\", \"infantile myoclonic encephalopathy\", \"jackknife convulsions\", \"massive myoclonia\" and \"Salaam spasms\". The term \"infantile spasms\" can be used to describe the specific seizure manifestation in the syndrome, but is also used as a synonym for the syndrome itself. West syndrome in modern usage is the triad of infantile spasms, a pathognomonic EEG pattern (called hypsarrhythmia), and developmental regression \u2013 although the international definition requires only two out of these three elements.", "West syndrome was named after the English doctor and surgeon William James West (1793\u20131848), who lived in Tonbridge. In 1841 he observed this type of epilepsy in his own son, James E West, who was approximately four months old at the time. He published his observations from a scientific perspective in an article in The Lancet. He named the seizures \"Salaam Tics\" at the time."]}, {"page": "William West", "response": ["*William James West (died 1848), English surgeon and apothecary"]}]}}
