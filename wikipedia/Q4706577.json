In 2010 the Institute launched a short video explaining the opportunities for careers in the refrigeration industry under the title  Careers in Cooling.  This uses interviews with a wide range of young people working in different aspects of refrigeration and air-conditioning to explain what a rewarding career it can be.  A webpage was also set up to support the video."]}]}}
