Tyler was the protagonist of the play Wat Tyler and Jack Straw, or, The Mob Reformers (1730) first performed at Bartholomew Fair in 1730. Wat Tyler is represented in Robert Southey's Wat Tyler, A Dramatic Poem, which was written in 1794 but not published until 1813. The first novel to feature Wat Tyler is Mrs O'Neill's The Bondman: A Story of the Days of Wat Tyler (1833).

Set in Norway and Iceland during the Viking period, it depicts the stirring but bleak existence of Dark Age Europeans at a time of insecurity and constant threat from raiders.  The story follows a young woman called Ran from the time she loses her mother in a wolf attack, and a subsequent attempt to kill her as a human sacrifice, to her escape with a blind harper, Toki, to a new life in Iceland.  Even there however the threat of sudden violence hangs over small and isolated farming communities.  The book does not dwell on bloodshed but is honest about the hardship, unpredictability and cruelty of the period, showing even sympathetic central characters as not immune to painful death.  Moral choices are also at times difficult."]}, {"page": "White Wolf", "response": ["* White Wolf, a 1998 novel by Henrietta Branford"]}, {"page": "Deaths in April 1999", "response": ["*Henrietta Branford, 53, English author of children's books, breast cancer."]}]}}
