RBSA, RE, FRSA, SWE (born 1943) is a British wood engraver and printmaker.She was born in Dunfermline and spent much of her life abroad in places such as Malta and China. She studied sculpture and wood engraving at Portsmouth College of Art before embarking on a career within education. Wood engraving became her medium of choice when she had a child and stone carving in the kitchen became too hazardous. Alongside engraving, Paynter had a full-time career running the Special Needs Department of a large, inner London secondary comprehensive before training as an Educational Psychologist. Since 2000, Paynter has worked as a full-time artist. Her output is prolific, she has created an estimated 700 wood engravings. Her subject matters include epic landscapes and heroic structures interspersed with challenging socio-political prints. Her work is held in many public collections, such as the Victoria & Albert Museum (London), The Ashmolean (Oxford), the Fitzwilliam Museum (Cambridge) and the Central Academy of Fine Arts (Beijing). The Victoria & Albert Museum hold over 70 of her engravings spanning over 60 years.\nPaynter was instrumental in resurrecting the Society of Wood Engravers in the 1980s, organising the first exhibition in over 20 years at the now closed Garden Gallery in Kew, London. Since then, Paynter has held various positions in the Society including Chair and has continued to organise the Society's Annual Exhibition throughout. In meeting the Society's aims to promote wood engraving, Paynter books galleries from St Ives to the Shetland Islands and has even taken the show abroad to Russia and Georgia.\nPaynter is an Honorary Member of the Royal Birmingham Society of Artists (RBSA) and a Past President of the Royal Society of Painter Printmakers. As part of her role as Honorary Member of the RBSA, Paynter has participated as a guest artist in print exhibitions and delivered printmaking workshops for adults. In recent years, Paynter has produced a large illustrated book, titled Full Circle, to chart her work and its development. Paynter has illustrated many books including collections of poems by Carol Ann Duffy and Simon Armitage both published by Andrew J Moorhouse. In 2003, Paynter was commissioned to commemorate Thomas Bewick's 250th anniversary. The resulting Metro Project was a series of 32 vitreous enamel panels featuring Paynter's engravings, stretching 22 metres along Newcastle's Metro Central Station's platform. In 2016, Paynter was commissioned by The Arts Council, The Baring Foundation and Devon Guild to create a body of work on the theme of ageing. Paynter's body of work, entitled The Age of Enlightenment, was notable for its positive viewpoint on ageing.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Society of Wood Engravers", "response": ["The Society went into abeyance during the 1960s but was revived in 1984 by Hilary Paynter. The major regeneration of the SWE, virtually amounting to a re-foundation after a difficult mid-century, was built on the distinction between \u2018wood engraving\u2019 and \u2018woodcut\u2019: by then the more visible as the two traditions developed in different ways.  Now that synthetic materials can be used for engraving on, it has been suggested that it is the fine engraving rather than the material engraved which really defines the medium; this is the quality many practitioners are drawn to and the reason for the continued growth of the Society. The SWE supports all kinds of relief printmaking but chiefly promotes fine wood engraving \u2013 as its name implies.", "* Hilary Paynter 1998 \u2013 2006"]}, {"page": "Paynter", "response": ["*Hilary Paynter (born 1943), British artist"]}, {"page": "Royal Society of Painter-Printmakers", "response": ["The Royal Society of Painter-Printmakers (formerly Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers) has had thirteen presidents (PRE) in total since 1880.

Sadly, by 1988, deteriorating eyesight and the onset of arthritis caused him to cease wood engraving - although, even then, he still painted and drew with vigour. The wood engravings continued to be shown at exhibitions and, in 1996, Bostock was one of nineteen major artists to be included in an exhibition arranged by Hilary Paynter (Chairman of the Society of Wood Engravers) at the Bankside Gallery, London. This exhibition featured artists who were members of both The Royal Society of Painter-Printmakers and the Society of Wood Engravers. In 1997, Bostock's work was included in Hal Bishop's landmark exhibition at Exeter Museum, Twentieth-Century British Wood Engraving: A Celebration... and a Dissenting Voice. This exhibition received an Arts Council award and is possibly the most important display of British wood engraving to occur during this period."]}]}}
