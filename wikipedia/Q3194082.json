Her work is celebrated each year on April 14. A monument to her was erected in 1963 at the Sumiyoshi shrine in Uto, Kumamoto, Japan.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Nori", "response": ["The Japanese nori industry was in decline after WWII, when Japan was in need of all food that could be produced. The decline was due to a lack of understanding of nori's three-stage life cycle, such that local people did not understand why traditional cultivation methods were not effective. The industry was rescued by knowledge deriving from the work of British phycologist Kathleen Mary Drew-Baker, who had been researching the organism Porphyria umbilicalis, which grew in the seas around Wales and was harvested for food (bara lafwr or bara lawr), as in Japan. Her work was discovered by Japanese scientists who applied it to artificial methods of seeding and growing the nori, rescuing the industry. Kathleen Baker was hailed as the \"Mother of the Sea\" in Japan and a statue erected in her memory; she is still revered as the savior of the Japanese nori industry."]}, {"page": "Phycology", "response": ["* Kathleen Mary Drew-Baker (1901\u20131957)"]}, {"page": "1957 in science", "response": ["* December 14 \u2013 Kathleen Mary Drew-Baker (born 1901), English phycologist."]}, {"page": "1901 in science", "response": ["* November 6 \u2013 Kathleen Mary Drew-Baker (died 1957), British phycologist."]}, {"page": "Porphyra", "response": ["Porphyra displays a heteromorphic alternation of generations.Porphyra life cycle  The thallus we see is the haploid generation; it can reproduce asexually by forming spores which grow to replicate the original thallus. It can also reproduce sexually. Both male and female gametes are formed on the one thallus. The female gametes while still on the thallus are fertilized by the released male gametes, which are non-motile. The fertilized, now diploid, carposporangia after mitosis produce spores (carpospores) which settle, then bore into shells, germinate and form a filamentous stage.  This stage was originally thought to be a different species of alga, and was referred to as Conchocelis rosea. That Conchocelis was the diploid stage of Porphyra was discovered  in 1949 by the British phycologist Kathleen Mary Drew-Baker for the European species Porphyra umbilicalis. It was later shown for species from other regions as well.Thomas, D. 2002. Seaweeds. The Natural History Museum, London.
