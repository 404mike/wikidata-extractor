Mineo and Haworth were together on-and-off for many years. They were engaged to be married at one point. According to Mineo biographer Michael Gregg Michaud, Haworth cancelled the engagement after she caught Mineo engaging in sexual relations with another man. The two remained very close friends until Mineo's death. Mineo expressed disapproval of Haworth's brief relationship with the much older television producer Aaron Spelling. One night, when Mineo found Haworth and Spelling at a private Beverly Hills nightclub, he punched Spelling in the face, yelling, \"Do you know how old she is? What are you doing with her at your age?\" While some have described Haworth as being nothing but a close friend and a \"beard\" to Mineo to conceal his same-sex partners, Michaud casts doubt upon this claim; he asserts that Mineo's and Haworth's relationship was genuine, that Mineo fell in love with Haworth, and that Mineo regarded her as one of the important people in his life."]}, {"page": "1969 in film", "response": ["*The Haunted House of Horror (a.k.a.
