There were very few copies in circulation initially, as Wright had produced a limited amount through his personal publishing house. However, the positive reception received by Deluge attracted the attention of Cosmopolitan Book Corporation, which allowed for mass production of the novel. Deluge was Wright's first popular novel and granted him considerable financial success. Storm Jameson praised Deluge on its original publication in the magazine London Calling, comparing Deluge to Cicely Hamilton's post-holocaust novel Theodore Savage.Brian Stableford,\"Introduction\" to Deluge, Wesleyan University Press, 2003 ,  (p. i-lviii). Edward Shanks, reviewing Deluge in the London Mercury, also lauded the book. Clemence Dane, discussing Deluge in the women's magazine Eve: The Lady's Pictorial, praised Deluge and compared it to After London by Richard Jefferies. Not all reception was positive, as Wright noted in a following edition of Deluge. Certain reviewers suggested Wright was \"Full of prejudices\" in his writing. Others criticized Wright for his one dimensional female character development. However, most considered the book to be a brilliant work of science fiction. Deluge was of great inspiration to future science fiction writers John Wyndham and John Christopher. A sequel to Deluge, Dawn (novel) was completed in 1929, though it was not as well received."]}, {"page": "Dropmore Press", "response": ["Kemsley acquired the type, paper-stock, printing equipment and press-man of the Corvinus Press, which closed in 1945, following the death of its owner Viscount Carlow in the previous year. He named it after his home, Dropmore Park, near Taplow. The Press was run by a committee of directors, who selected texts and oversaw the work of the press-man, A. H. Cardew. Kemsley and his fellow directors, among whom Edward Shanks was perhaps the most active, attempted to run the Press on commercial grounds (Carlow's Corvinus Press had been a hobby), with limited success. Most of the books were printed in editions of between 300 and 1000 copies, and their style was generally formal and similar to the better 'trade' publications of the period. The books appear staid, both in design and literary terms, when compared with the publications of the Corvinus Press. Some Dropmore Press books were printed by commercial printing-firms, rather than by Cardew at the Press itself."]}, {"page": "Nineteen Eighty-Four", "response": ["When it was first published, Nineteen Eighty-Four received critical acclaim.

On the other hand, Edward Shanks, reviewing Nineteen Eighty-Four for The Sunday Times, was dismissive; Shanks claimed Nineteen Eighty-Four \"breaks all records for gloomy vaticination\". C. S. Lewis was also critical of the novel, claiming that the relationship of Julia and Winston, and especially the Party's view on sex, lacked credibility, and that the setting was \"odious rather than tragic\".

It is a tale of late night f\u00eate galante involving aristocrats and a commedia dell'arte troupe where jealousy, desire, and multiple masquerades end in the death of one of the characters. Described by the composer as a \"Dance-dream\", the opera premiered on 4 June 1923 at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre.", "The libretto was written by Smyth and the war poet Edward Shanks and closely follows Baring's story of a late night f\u00eate galante in which the Pierrot is hanged by a jealous king. Like Fantasio, Smyth's earlier comic opera, F\u00eate Galante involves mistaken identity and disguise, but is a much darker tale. Its title and themes of aristocratic open-air festivity, masquerade and commedia dell'arte harked back to the operas of Rameau and Lully but were also echoed in the neoclassical works of Smyth's contemporaries Debussy, Busoni, and Stravinsky.Wood (1995) p. 294. See for example, Rameau's Les f\u00eates d'H\u00e9b\u00e9. Lully's Les F\u00eates de l\u2019Amour et de Bacchus, Debussy's song cycle F\u00eates galantes, Busoni's Arlecchino, and Stravinsky's Pulcinella Smyth composed F\u00eate Galante in a neoclassical style, incorporating baroque dances and a madrigal set to a poem by John Donne.
