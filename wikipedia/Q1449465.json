The English organist, John Baptiste Calkin, used the poem in a processional accompanied with a melody \"Waltham\" that he previously used as early as 1848. The Calkin version of the carol was long the standard. Less commonly, the poem has also been set to Joseph Mainzer's 1845 composition \"Mainzer\". Other melodies have been composed more recently, most notably in 1956 by Johnny Marks."]}, {"page": "Christmas Present (Andy Williams album)", "response": ["# \"I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day\" (John Baptiste Calkin, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow) \u2013 2:47"]}, {"page": "Romain-Octave Pelletier I", "response": ["Pelletier spent almost two years touring Europe in 1871-1872.
