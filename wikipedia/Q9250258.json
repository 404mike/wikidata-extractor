The race was moved from the traditional early season slot in April to the season finale on September 26 due to the ongoing pandemic. The race would be a championship deciding showdown between three drivers; Alex Palou of Chip Ganassi Racing, Pato O'Ward of Arrow McLaren SP, and Josef Newgarden of Team Penske. Palou held a 35-point advantage over his rivals, meaning he only had to finish no worse than 11th to win the championship. O'Ward  and Newgarden both had to qualify on the pole to earn the awarded bonus point and win the race to put themselves in a position to win the championship. If he met those prerequisites O'Ward needed Palou to finish no better than thirteenth to win the championship. Newgarden meanwhile needed to meet those prerequisites while needing Palou to finish no better than twentieth and O'Ward to finish no better than third to clinch the championship. Qualifying for the race was highly controversial due to a yellow flag incident caused by Will Power that caused both Palou and O'Ward to be bounced from the Firestone Fast Six while Newgarden advanced. Newgarden won his season leading fourth pole position and first ever at Long Beach while Palou would start tenth and O'Ward in eighth. Further controversy erupted in a first lap pile up when Ed Jones ran into the back of O'Ward and destroyed the driveshaft on O Ward's car, knocking him out of the race and out of the championship. Meanwhile Colton Herta mounted a furious charge to the front of the field and overtook Scott Dixon and Newgarden for the lead on lap 31 and held onto it for his third win of the season.
