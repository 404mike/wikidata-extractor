Cat is concerned with little other than sleeping, eating, and fawning over his appearance, and tends not to socialise with other members of the crew in early episodes. He becomes more influenced by his human companions over time and begins to resemble a stylish, self-centred human.

However, after Molina had difficulties with the concept of the series, and of his role in particular, the role was recast and filled by Chris Barrie, a professional voice-actor and impressionist who had previously worked with both the writers on Spitting Image and with the producers on Happy Families and Jasper Carrott productions. Craig Charles, a Liverpudlian \"punk poet\", was given the role of Dave Lister. He was approached by the production team for his opinion about the \"Cat\" character, as they were concerned it may be considered by people as racist.Howarth & Lyons (1993) p. 5.

A professional dancer and singer, Danny John-Jules, arriving half an hour late for his appointment, stood out as the Cat immediately.

The first two series used a relatively sombre instrumental version of the closing theme for the opening titles; from series III onwards this switched to a more upbeat version, with Goodall singing on vocoder, the line \"Red Dwarf\" four times in the second half of the song. Goodall also wrote music for the show's various songs, including \"Tongue Tied\", with lyrics written by Grant and Naylor. Danny John-Jules (credited as 'The Cat') re-orchestrated and released \"Tongue Tied\" on 11 October 1993; it reached number 17 on the UK charts.

In the 2004 documentary Dwarfing USA, Danny John-Jules said the only actor who could have successfully portrayed an American Lister was John Belushi. In a 2009 interview on Kevin Pollak's Chat Show, Bierko said that casting him as Lister was a \"huge mistake,\" and also said a \"John Belushi-type\" would have been better suited to the role.", "| Cat || Danny John-Jules || Hinton Battle || Terry Farrell", "After a compilation bloopers show, featuring out-takes, the next programme was Universe Challenge, a spoof of University Challenge.

As Lister prepares for it, the ship is jolted severely, to which the ship's computer Holly (Norman Lovett) explains that the ship's constant acceleration has caused it to break the light barrier. Shortly after being assured the ship will be alright, Lister notices odd things, including his mirror's reflection acting on its own, a second Rimmer having a conversation in the Drive Room that makes no sense, and a second Cat running out of his quarters after breaking a tooth. Conveying his observations to Rimmer and Holly, the computer reveals that breaking the light barrier has caused them to experience temporal anomalies known as \"Future Echoes\"; events that will occur in the future that can be seen in the present.Howarth & Lyons (1993) p. 46. The pair soon believe this when they find a photograph showing Lister holding two babies in his arms and question how it will happen."]}]}}
