Although the Redcliffe-Maud Report was rejected by the Conservative government after the 1970 general election, there was a commitment to local government reform, and the need for a metropolitan county centred on the conurbation surrounding Manchester was accepted. The new government's original proposal was much smaller than the Redcliffe-Maud Report's Selnec, with areas such as Winsford, Northwich, Knutsford, Macclesfield and Glossop retained by their original counties to ensure their county councils had enough revenue to remain competitive (Cheshire County Council would have ceased to exist). Other late changes included the separation of the proposed Bury/Rochdale authority (retained from the Redcliffe-Maud report) into the Metropolitan Borough of Bury and the Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale. Bury and Rochdale were originally planned to form a single district (dubbed \"Botchdale\" by local MP Michael Fidler) but were divided into separate boroughs. To re-balance the districts, the borough of Rochdale took Middleton from Oldham. During the passage of the bill, the towns of Whitworth, Wilmslow and Poynton successfully objected to their incorporation in the new county."]}, {"page": "October 1974 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Michael Fidler"]}, {"page": "Board of Deputies of British Jews", "response": ["* Michael Fidler (1967\u20131973)"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the February 1974 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Michael Fidler"]}, {"page": "Local Government Act 1972", "response": ["*Rochdale and Bury were originally planned to form a single district (dubbed \"Botchdale\" by local MP Michael Fidler); Rochdale took Middleton from Oldham in compensation."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1970 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Michael Fidler"]}, {"page": "Conservative Friends of Israel", "response": ["It was founded in 1974 by Michael Fidler, the Conservative MP for Bury and Radcliffe.
