As a comedian, he mixed everyday situations and observations with comic absurdity. Apart from his music hall acts, he was a popular Christmas pantomime performer in the English provinces, where he excelled in the dame roles. He scored notable successes in musical revues during and after the First World War, particularly with the song \"If You Were the Only Girl (In the World)\", which he performed with Violet Loraine in the revue The Bing Boys Are Here (1916). One of his best-known original characters in his six-decade long career was the Prime Minister of Mirth.", "By the First World War, music hall entertainment had fallen out of favour with audiences. Theatrical historians blame the music hall's decline on the increasing salaries of performers and the halls' inability to present profitably the twenty or thirty acts that the audiences expected to see. Revue appealed to wartime audiences, and Robey decided to capitalise on the medium's popularity.Wilson, p. 109. Stoll offered Robey a lucrative contract in 1916 to appear in the new revue The Bing Boys Are HereCotes, pp. 83\u201385. at the Alhambra Theatre, London.Cotes, p. 195. Dividing his time between three or four music halls a night had become unappealing to the comedian, and he relished the opportunity to appear in a single theatre.Wilson, p. 110. He was cast as Lucius Bing opposite Violet Loraine, who played his love interest Emma, and the couple duetted in the show's signature song \"If You Were the Only Girl (In the World)\", which became an international success.\"The Bing Boys Are Here\", Exeter and Plymouth Gazette, 1 May 1916, p. 2.Fazan, p. 30.", "Robey left the cast of The Bing Boys during its run, in January 1917, to star at the London Hippodrome in Albert de Courville, Dave Stamper and Gene Buck's lavishly staged revue Zig-Zag!.Stone, p. 27. Robey included a sketch based on his music hall character \"The Prehistoric Man\", with Daphne Pollard playing the role of \"She of the Tireless Tongue\".Cotes, p. 85. In another scene, he played a drunken gentleman who accidentally secures a box at the Savoy Theatre instead of an intended hotel room. The audience appeared unresponsive to the character, so he changed it mid-performance to that of a naive Yorkshire man. The change provoked much amusement, and it became one of the most popular scenes of the show. Zig-Zag ran for 648 performances. Stoll again secured Robey for the Alhambra in 1918 for a sequel, The Bing Boys on Broadway. The show, again co-starring Violet Loraine, matched the popularity of its predecessor and beat the original show's run with a total of 562 performances.", "Violet Loraine called her former co-star \"one of the greatest comedians the world has ever known\",Quoted in Wilson, p. 242. while the theatrical producer Basil Dean opined that \"George was a great artist, one of the last and  the really big figures of his era. They don't breed them like that now.\" The actor John Gielgud, who remembered meeting Robey at the Alhambra Theatre in 1953, called the comedian \"charming, gracious [and] one of the few really great ones\" of the music hall era. Upon his death, Robey's costume for the Prime Minister of Mirth was donated to the London Museum, where it is on permanent display."]}, {"page": "If You Were the Only Girl (In the World)", "response": ["\"If You Were the Only Girl (In the World)\" is a popular song, written by Nat D.
