They were expecting \"a craftsman who works good openings for others\", and Roseboom did indeed prove himself both creative and technically clever, but his workrate was not of comparable quality. In February 1924, after twelve appearances and a single goal, Roseboom joined Clapton Orient in exchange for Harry Higginbotham. He made a \"sparkling display\" on his first-team debut a month later, in a goalless draw at home to Southampton. The Athletic News correspondent highlighted how \"the newcomer played with great judgment, and he rarely gave Smith a poor pass, while the way he hooked the ball into the goalmouth was a lesson to some his colleagues.\" He played twice more before being granted a free transfer and returning to Lancashire with Third Division North club Rochdale."]}]}}
