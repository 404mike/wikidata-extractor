Among his honours were the CBE in 1952, the Queen's Gold Medal for Poetry in 1953, and he was invested as a Companion of Honour in 1956.Although highly learned, Waley avoided academic posts and most often wrote for a general audience. He chose not to be a specialist but to translate a wide and personal range of classical literature. Starting in the 1910s and continuing steadily almost until his death in 1966, these translations started with poetry, such as A Hundred and Seventy Chinese Poems (1918) and Japanese Poetry: The Uta (1919), then an equally wide range of novels, such as The Tale of Genji (1925\u201326), an 11th-century Japanese work, and Monkey, from 16th-century China. Waley also presented and translated Chinese philosophy, wrote biographies of literary figures, and maintained a lifelong interest in both Asian and Western paintings.\nA recent evaluation called Waley \"the great transmitter of the high literary cultures of China and Japan to the English-reading general public; the ambassador from East to West in the first half of the 20th century\", and went on to say that he was \"self-taught, but reached remarkable levels of fluency, even erudition, in both languages. It was a unique achievement, possible (as he himself later noted) only in that time, and unlikely to be repeated.\"\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Chinese philosophy", "response": ["* Arthur Waley, Three Ways of Thought in Ancient China, 1983."]}, {"page": "Confucius", "response": ["Just as action according to l\u01d0 should be adapted to conform to the aspiration of adhering to y\u00ec, so y\u00ec is linked to the core value of r\u00e9n ().R\u00e9n consists of five basic virtues: seriousness, generosity, sincerity, diligence, and kindness.. R\u00e9n is the virtue of perfectly fulfilling one's responsibilities toward others, most often translated as \"benevolence\" or \"humaneness\"; translator Arthur Waley calls it \"Goodness\" (with a capital G), and other translations that have been put forth include \"authoritativeness\" and \"selflessness.\" Confucius's moral system was based upon empathy and understanding others, rather than divinely ordained rules. To develop one's spontaneous responses of r\u00e9n so that these could guide action intuitively was even better than living by the rules of y\u00ec.
