Missions were also exchanged with General Dwight D. Eisenhower's Allied Force Headquarters (AFHQ) in Algiers to coordinate the plans of offensive action in the Mediterranean and north western Europe in 1944. In October and November, Morgan went to Washington, to discuss the operation with the Combined Chiefs of Staff, accompanied only by Major-General Nevil Brownjohn and an aide. Morgan met with General George Marshall, the Chief of Staff of the United States Army, who instructed him to proceed with planning on the basis that Marshall would be the Supreme Allied Commander and Morgan his chief of staff. Morgan met with President Franklin D. Roosevelt at the White House. Roosevelt turned down Morgan's request for the services of Anthony Joseph Drexel Biddle, Jr. to assist with civil affairs, and also cast doubt on whether Marshall could be spared to become Supreme Allied Commander. While in the United States Morgan visited the Gettysburg Battlefield and the training camps at Camp Carrabelle, Fort Benning, Camp Mackall and Fort Bragg."]}, {"page": "Aide-de-camp general", "response": ["| General Sir Nevil Brownjohn || 31 January 1957 || 29 November 1958 ||"]}, {"page": "Quartermaster-General to the Forces", "response": ["*1956\u20131958 General Sir Nevil Brownjohn"]}, {"page": "Sidney Kirkman", "response": ["On 21 October 1930 Kirkman relinquished his appointment as staff captain with Malta Command and returned to England.
