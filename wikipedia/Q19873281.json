In the 59th minute, Cullen received the first yellow card of the game.  Pym then caught Mellor's header from a corner.  Blackpool made their second substitution of the game in the 62nd minute when Ian Black came on for Payne.  Two minutes later, Cullen put Blackpool back into the lead.  Potts made a run into the Exeter penalty area and crossed the ball: Pym deflected it with his foot only for Cullen to finish it with an outstretched leg.  In the 71st minute, Exeter made their final personnel change of the afternoon with Lee Holmes replacing Craig Woodman.  Danns shot then flew over the Exeter crossbar and with fifteen minutes to go, Cullen was replaced by Jordan Flores.  In the 78th minute, Reid's shot from the edge of the Blackpool box went just wide.
