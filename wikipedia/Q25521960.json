Though the term itself has a tradition of more than 100 years,Dunbar, Gary S. (1977): Some Early Occurrences of the Term \"Social Geography\". Scottish Geographical Journal 93 (1): 15-20. there is no consensus on its explicit content.Smith, Susan J. et al. (2010): Introduction: Situating Social Geographies. In: Smith, Susan J. et al. (eds.): The Sage Handbook of Social Geographies. London (Sage): 1-39 [5-7]. In 1968, Anne Buttimer noted that \"[w]ith some notable exceptions, (...) social geography can be considered a field created and cultivated by a number of individual scholars rather than an academic tradition built up within particular schools\".Buttimer, Anne (1968): Social geography. In: Sills, David (ed.): International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences. New York (MacMillan): 134-145 [134]. Since then, despite some callsPeter Jackson (1983): Social geography: Convergence and Compromise. Progress in Human Geography 7 (1): 116-121. for convergence centred on the structure and agency debate,Gregory, Derek (1981): Human Agency and Human Geography. Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers 6 (1): 1-18. its methodological, theoretical and topical diversity has spread even more, leading to numerous definitions of social geographyEyles, John (1986): Introduction: Diffusion and Convergence? In: Eyles, John (ed.): Social Geography in International perspective. Barnes & Noble: 1-12 [4-5]. and, therefore, contemporary scholars of the discipline identifying a great variety of different social geographies.Smith, Susan J. et al. (2010): 3. However, as Benno Werlen remarked,Werlen, Benno (2008): Sozialgeographie: Eine Einf\u00fchrung (3. ed.). Bern et al. (Haupt). [11]  these different perceptions are nothing else than different answers to the same two (sets of) questions, which refer to the spatial constitution of society on the one hand, and to the spatial expression of social processes on the other.Jackson, Peter (1987): The Idea of 'Race' and the Geography of Racism. In: Jackson, Peter (ed.): Race and Racism: Essays in Social geography. London (Allen & Unwin): 3-18 [14].The outline of these questions is basically of dialectical purpose, and, in its original context, wasn't used as a subject's definition. (Cf. Jackson, Peter (2003): Introduction: The Social in Question. In: Anderson, Kay et al. (eds.) (2003): Handbook of Cultural Geography. London et al. (Sage): 37-42.) Also note that Werlen's original two questions that social geography has to answer slightly differ from these two, and that Buttimer (1968: 135) provides another two of such questions."]}, {"page": "Peter Jackson (disambiguation)", "response": ["Peter Jackson (born 1961) is a New Zealand-born filmmaker.", "Peter Jackson may also refer to:", "*Peter Jackson (academic), Australian writer and scholar of sexual politics and Buddhism in Thailand", "*Peter Jackson (scientist) (1949\u20132011), scientist at Thomson Reuters Corporation", "*Peter Jackson (historian), scholar and author on the history of the Crusades, particularly regarding the Mongols", "*Peter Jackson (conservationist) (1926\u20132016), British journalist, photographer, tiger conservationist, and author", "*Peter Jackson (geographer) (born 1955), human geographer", "*Peter Jackson, Member of Parliament (MP) for City of York", "*Peter Jackson (judge) (born 1955), English Court of Appeal judge", "*Peter Jackson (politician) (1928\u20132020), British Labour Party Member of Parliament for High Peak 1966\u20131970", "*Peter Jackson (footballer, born 1905) (1905\u20131986), English footballer and football manager", "*Peter Jackson (footballer, born 1937) (1937\u20131991), his son, English footballer", "*Peter Jackson (footballer, born 1961) (born 1961), English footballer and football manager", "*Peter Jackson (boxer) (1861\u20131901), World Colored Heavyweight Champion boxer also known as \"Peter the Great\"", "*Young Peter Jackson (boxer, born 1877) (1877\u20131923), African American welterweight boxer known as \"The Baltimore Demon\"", "*Young Peter Jackson (boxer, born 1912) (1912\u20131979), African American lightweight boxer", "*Peter Jackson (cricketer) (1911\u20131999), English cricketer who played for Worcestershire", "*Peter Jackson (rugby union) (1930\u20132004), English rugby union footballer", "*Peter Jackson (tennis) (1934\u20132014), Irish tennis player", "*Peter Jackson (sailor) (born 1945), sailor for the United States Virgin Islands", "*Peter Jackson (rugby league) (1964\u20131997), Australian rugby league footballer", "*Peter Jackson (table tennis) (born 1964), New Zealand table tennis player", "*Peter Jackson, a fictional character in the Stephen King novels Desperation and The Regulators", "*Peter Jackson, a fictional character in the 1969 Michael Crichton novel The Andromeda Strain", "*Peter Jackson, Cigar Merchant, a 1919 novel by Gilbert Frankau", "*Peter Jackson, a pseudonym for Ernest Hemingway during his second stay in Toronto", "*Peter Jackson (artist) (1922\u20132003), artist who ran a documentary cartoon strip in the London Evening News, giving glimpses of London's history", "*Peter Jackson (journalist) (born 1950), American journalist", "*Peter Jackson (fashion designer) (1928\u20132008), Australian men's fashion outfitter and fashion designer", "*Peter Jackson, a brand of cigarettes owned by Imperial Tobacco", "*Peter Jackson (businessman) (born 1975), CEO of Paddy Power Betfair"]}, {"page": "Victoria Medal (geography)", "response": ["*2007: Peter Jackson, for research on social geography"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the British Academy elected in the 2010s", "response": ["* Peter Jackson, Professor of Human Geography, University of Sheffield", "* Peter Jackson, Emeritus Professor of Medieval History, Keele University  "]}]}}
