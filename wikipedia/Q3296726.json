Its early years were difficult; Kert\u00e9sz did not get on with Alldis, and there were difficulties within the chorus. Most of its members were amateurs, but at first, they were reinforced by a small number of professionals. This led to disputes over the balance between amateurs and professionals.Morrison, p. 182 There was a brief crisis, after which the professional element was removed, and the LSO chorus became, and remains, an outstanding amateur chorus."]}, {"page": "Atom Heart Mother", "response": ["By March, they had finished recording the track, but felt that it was rather unfocused and needed something else. The band had been introduced to Ron Geesin via the Rolling Stones tour manager, Sam Cutler, and were impressed with his composition and tape-editing capabilities, particularly Waters and Mason. Geesin was handed the completed backing tracks the band had recorded, and asked to compose an orchestral arrangement over the top of it while the band went on tour to the US. Geesin described the composing and arranging as \"a hell of a lot of work. Nobody knew what was wanted, they couldn't read music \u2026\" According to him, Gilmour came up with some of the melodic lines, while the pair of them along with keyboardist Richard Wright worked on the middle section with the choir. During the recording of his work in June with the EMI Pops Orchestra, the session musicians present were unimpressed with his tendency to favour avant-garde music over established classical works, and, combined with the relative difficulty of some of the parts, harassed him during recording. John Alldis, whose choir were also to perform on the track, had experience in dealing with orchestral musicians, and managed to conduct the recorded performance in place of Geesin.", "The piece as presented on the completed album is a progression from Pink Floyd's earlier instrumental pieces such as \"A Saucerful of Secrets\" and even earlier, \"Interstellar Overdrive\". The \"Atom Heart Mother\" suite takes up all of side one, and is split into six parts, individually named. Geesin chose the opening section name, \"Father's Shout\" after Earl \"Fatha\" Hines, while other names such as \"Breast Milky\" and \"Funky Dung\" were inspired by the album cover artwork. The orchestral arrangements feature a full brass section, a cello and the 16-piece John Alldis choir, which take most of the lead melody lines, while Pink Floyd mainly provide the backing tracks; a reverse of the 1960s pop music practice of using orchestration as the background, and putting the rock band in front.", "The band were initially enthusiastic about performing the suite.

Two major performances were at the Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music on 27 June and the \"Blackhills Garden Party\" in Hyde Park, London on 18 July. On both occasions the band were accompanied by the John Alldis Choir and the Philip Jones Brass Ensemble. Later, the band took a full brass section and choir on tour just for the purpose of performing this piece. However, this caused the tour to lose money, and the band found problems with the hired musicians, which changed from gig to gig as they simply took who was available, which, combined with lack of rehearsal and problems miking up the whole ensemble, made a full live performance more problematic. Reflecting on this, Gilmour said \"some of the brass players have been really hopeless\".
