A striker, he won six caps at international level and scored one goal. In domestic football he made 336 league and cup appearances in the English Football League and scored 116 goals.\nAfter failing to make an impact at Wrexham, Jones found massive success in Welsh football with Rhyl. This earned him a chance in the English leagues with Port Vale in 1985. He took this chance in fine style, scoring 49 goals in 90 league appearances, helping the club to promotion out of the Fourth Division in 1985\u201386, and earning himself the club's Player of the Year award in 1986\u201387. His goal tally won him a \u00a3350,000 move to Charlton Athletic in September 1987. However, he did not find success at Charlton, and was loaned back to Port Vale and then to Bristol City. In October 1990 he signed with Bournemouth, before he moved on to his final club Leyton Orient a year later.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Port Vale F.C.", "response": ["Following McGrath's dismissal, his assistant John Rudge was appointed as manager in December 1983. Though he was unable to halt Vale's immediate return to the bottom tier of the Football League, he succeeded in steadying the ship. Helped by the goals of prolific Welshman Andy Jones, Vale were promoted back to the third tier in 1985\u201386 after losing just once at Vale Park in the league all season. A major cup upset came on 30 January 1988, when Vale defeated First Division side Tottenham Hotspur 2\u20131, thanks to a superb strike from Ray Walker. After three seasons in the third tier, Rudge's Vale achieved another promotion in 1988\u201389 after Robbie Earle scored the winning goal at Vale Park to complete a 2\u20131 aggregate play-off final victory over Bristol Rovers; this marked the club's return to the Second Division after a 33-year absence."]}, {"page": "Robbie Earle", "response": ["Earle won a regular first team place in August 1984, and hit 19 goals in 56 games in 1984\u201385, including a hat-trick against Hereford United at Vale Park on 2 February; Earle and Alistair Brown's partnership got the club a combined total of 40 goals. An ever-present in the 1985\u201386 Fourth Division promotion squad, he scored 17 goals in 58 games; he and strike partner Andy Jones bagged a total of 35 goals for the club. Earle made 142 consecutive appearances between September 1984 and January 1987, the run coming to an end due to a groin strain. The strain led to a hernia operation in the autumn of 1987, but he returned to first team action in January 1988. He scored seven goals in 35 games in 1986\u201387 and scored four goals in 11 games in 1987\u201388. That season he played in the FA Cup upset when Vale knocked out Tottenham Hotspur.  A regular in the 1988\u201389 season, Rudge claimed that Earle and Ray Walker was one of the best-ever midfield partnerships at the Vale. He scored both goals past Bristol Rovers in the two-legged 1989 play-off final that took Vale through to the Second Division. After the match Earle wept in the tunnel, such was his emotions to have taken his local team to victory in the play-off final. Over the course of the 1988\u201389 campaign he scored 19 goals in 57 appearances."]}, {"page": "John Rudge", "response": ["In reality, the task in 1984\u201385 was to arrest the decline. Rudge achieved this aim, slashing the wage bill to offset the club's reduced income, the Vale finished 12th. Young striker Andy Jones was purchased for \u00a33,000 from Rhyl. In 1985\u201386, promotion was the target. An eighteen-game unbeaten run from January to April helped to win Vale a fourth place promotion place, seven points clear of fifth place Leyton Orient. At the end of the season, Rudge turned down an offer of the management job at Preston North End.", "In 1987\u201388, Vale were once again comfortable in mid-table. The cash-flow problem was eased by the sale of Andy Jones to Charlton Athletic for \u00a3350,000. Rudge spent \u00a375,000 for Simon Mills from York City, who would be a firm fixture in the first team for the next five seasons. On 20 January the club achieved a famous 2\u20130 victory over top-flight Spurs in the FA Cup. Before the cup run there were rumours that the directors were considering sacking Rudge due to a poor run of results in the league. The cup run and the sale of Jones helped to put the club in the black financially for the first time in a long time."]}, {"page": "1986\u201387 in English football", "response": ["* Andy Jones (Port Vale) \u2013 27 goals"]}, {"page": "1987\u201388 in English football", "response": ["18 September 1987 \u2013 Defender David Bardsley moves between First Division strugglers Watford and Oxford United for \u00a3265,000.

In July 1984 he joined Port Vale, then in the Fourth Division under John Rudge's stewardship, making his debut in a 1\u20130 defeat to Mansfield Town at Vale Park on 25 August 1984. With 21 goals in 49 games in the 1984\u201385 season he became the club's top scorer, forming a deadly forward pairing with Robbie Earle.

His six goals in 33 games did though help the secure the \"Valiants\" the fourth automatic promotion place. Despite smoking cigarettes during the half-time break, his experience on the field helped to improve the goal-scoring skills of Robbie Earle and Andy Jones."]}]}}
