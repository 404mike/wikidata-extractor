Epstein (15 March 1960 \u2013 3 February 2007), known as \"Larry\", was a British economic historian, and a professor at the London School of Economics.\nBrought up in Switzerland, he studied at the University of Siena, and later received a PhD from the University of Cambridge. In 1992 he was made a lecturer in economic history at the LSE, by 1997 he had been appointed reader, and in 2001 professor.\nEpstein's PhD thesis was on economic development and social transformation in late medieval Sicily. Later he expanded his research to a greater European scale, with his 2000 book Freedom and Growth, where he explored the interaction between state formation and economic development. For this work he won the Ranki Prize for a book on European economic history in 2001. Epstein also worked on the history of technology, and on the influence of guilds on technological development in medieval Europe.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Marc Bloch", "response": ["The war was fundamental in re-arranging Bloch's approach to history, although he never acknowledged it as a turning point. In the years following the war, a disillusioned Bloch rejected the ideas and the traditions that had formed his scholarly training. He rejected the political and biographical history which up until that point was the norm, along with what the historian George Huppert has described as a \"laborious cult of facts\" that accompanied it. In 1920, with the opening of the University of Strasbourg, Bloch was appointed charg\u00e9 de cours (assistant lecturer) of medieval history. Alsace-Lorraine had been returned to France with the Treaty of Versailles; the status of the region was a contentious political issue in Strasbourg, its capital, which had a large German population. Bloch, however, refused to take either side in the debate; indeed, he appears to have avoided politics entirely. Under Wilhelmine Germany, Strasbourg had rivalled Berlin as a centre for intellectual advancement, and the University of Strasbourg possessed the largest academic library in the world. Thus, says Stephan R. Epstein of the London School of Economics, \"Bloch's unrivalled knowledge of the European Middle Ages was ... built on and around the French University of Strasbourg's inherited German treasures\". Bloch also taught French to the few German students who were still at the Centre d'\u00c9tudes Germaniques at the University of Mainz during the Occupation of the Rhineland. He refrained from taking a public position when France occupied the Ruhr in 1923 over Germany's perceived failure to pay war reparations."]}, {"page": "Stephan (given name)", "response": ["* Stephan R.
