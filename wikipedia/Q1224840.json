This period saw the addition of long-term member guitarist Eric Faulkner. In mid-1973, they narrowly missed the UK Singles Chart with their fourth single, \"Saturday Night\". By the end of 1973, Clark had become disillusioned with the band's musical direction and decided to leave just when his recording of \"Remember (Sha-La-La-La)\" climbed the charts to No. 6. He was replaced as lead singer by Les McKeown.

The band released one new single, \"Boomerang\", and discussed plans for a new album.

After the 2015 Christmas shows Les was booking shows only for himself and his band during 2016 (Except T In The Park) which caused the reunion to end.
