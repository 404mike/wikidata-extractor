It was formed sometime in the first half of the 18th century, or earlier, and its earliest known record is in 1754 when its team played two matches against the prominent Dartford Cricket Club. The club, or at least a successor of it, then played a number of matches from 1797 to 1806 against Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), Montpelier Cricket Club, Croydon Cricket Club and other leading town clubs. After playing MCC in 1806, the club disappeared from the records. Throughout the period from 1754 to 1806, Woolwich's home ground was Barrack Field, part of Woolwich Common, which remains the home ground of the Royal Artillery Cricket Club (RACC). Mainstays of the club in its \"Napoleonic\" period were William Ayling, John Tanner and John Ward."]}, {"page": "Ayling", "response": ["*William Ayling (1766\u20131826), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of English cricketers (1787\u20131825)", "response": ["|Two appearances for Kent.
