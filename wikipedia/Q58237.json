In the New York Times archives, the earliest reference is from 1993 when Arnold Schwarzenegger did it with the son of a film-crew member while on the set of Last Action Hero, saying: \"Let's have five. Five high. Five low,\" at which point Schwarzenegger pulled his hand away saying \"Too slow.\" The boy reportedly laughed.\"ON THE SET WITH \u2013 Arnold Schwarzenegger; Big Guy. Big Star. Big Deal, Baby.\", Bernard Weinraub, The New York Times, March 4, 1993. Schwarzenegger did it originally in the 1991 film Terminator 2: Judgment Day, when John Connor (Edward Furlong) teaches the Terminator (Schwarzenegger) to \"Gimme five. Up high, down low, too slow.\"Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991). In 2008, They Might Be Giants released the song \"High Five!\" on an album for children titled Here Come the 123s, with lyrics \"High five! Low five! Slap me five! Down low! Too slow!,\" a gesture described in the song as \"old school\"High Five!, lyrics a slang term usually meaning something from a prior generation.See \"old school,\" The Dictionary of Modern American Slang and Unconventional English, Routledge, 2008. p. 713.
