In Essex, men not eligible for call-up into the armed forces were coming forward to join the self-styled \"Legion of Frontiersmen\". Officials were soon informed of the development of the legion, with the Adjutant-General, Sir Robert Gordon-Finlayson, arguing that the government should encourage the development of more unofficial organisations. The fear of invasion in 1939 quickly dissipated as it became evident that the German military was not in a position to launch an invasion of Britain; official enthusiasm for home defence forces waned and the legion appears to have dissolved itself at the same time."]}, {"page": "Charles Hudson (VC)", "response": ["The first few years of Hudson's service as a Regular Army officer were spent mainly on regimental duties, initially as adjutant to his regiment's 3rd (Militia) Battalion, holding this post from 11 March 1920 until 10 March 1923.

Hudson was critical of, and often rebelled against, the methods his instructors used, believing them to not differ significantly from the methods used by the senior commanders in the Great War, which often failed with a heavy cost in human life. He furthermore believed that the Staff College's training was inadequate if the army was to fight another major European war.Hudson, p. 155 His attitude was described by his instructors as awkward and often inclined to be pig-headed. Nevertheless, Hudson, for the most part, enjoyed his time there and he was recommended for future employment.Hudson, p. 154"]}, {"page": "Operation Sea Lion order of battle", "response": ["* Western Command \u2014 General Robert Gordon-Finlayson"]}, {"page": "Aide-de-camp general", "response": ["| General Sir Robert Gordon-Finlayson || 8 June 1940 || 24 November 1941 ||"]}, {"page": "Kersey, Suffolk", "response": ["*Robert Gordon-Finlayson (1881-1956), Adjutant-General to the Forces; he was created a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 1937, Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1918, and Companion of the Distinguished Service Order in 1915."]}, {"page": "General Gordon", "response": ["*Robert Gordon-Finlayson (1881\u20131956), British Army general", "*Robert Gordon-Finlayson (British Army officer, born 1916) (1916\u20132001), British Army major general"]}, {"page": "International African Service Bureau", "response": ["In 1939 the IASB worked alongside the League of Coloured Peoples and the West African Students Union to campaign against the colour bar introduced by Adjutant-General Robert Gordon-Finlayson in the British Army."]}, {"page": "Colville Wemyss", "response": ["On 10 June 1940, he replaced General Robert Gordon-Finlayson as Adjutant-General to the Forces.
