He was, however, more interested in theatre and in 1903 made his first appearance on the London stage at the Royal Court Theatre. He then spent four years at the Glasgow Repertory Theatre producing plays and acting before returning to London to manage the Lyric Theatre in the Strand.\nHe directed the play Magic by G.K.Chesterton, which had been written specially for him in 1913, and which title was the caption to the Vanity Fair caricature of him on 17 December 1913. He then produced the first performance of Chekhov\u2019s The Cherry Orchard in England and in Europe, after which he obliged to leave the theatre for a while when he contracted tuberculosis.\nIn 1915 he began a new career as a film director utilizing the production techniques and acting skills he had learned in the theatre. Many of his films were made for Astra Films. Following a relapse of his illness, he was able to return to the theatre and in the early 1920s spent some time in New York City where he produced a play on Broadway starring John Barrymore.\nHe published several novels, works of poetry and biographical studies of Richard Brinsley Sheridan and J. M. W. Turner. With Mary Pickford, Charlie Chaplin and others he published  Practical Course in Cinema Acting in Ten Complete Lessons in 1920.\nIn 1925 he opened a sandwich bar in London which soon became a great success with the theatre fraternity and was followed by more \"Sandys\" to meet the demand.\nFoss died in 1963. He had married the actress Elisabeth Gilson and had six children, two of whom died in childhood.\nIn 2005 his daughter Fanny Burney Woolnough published (under the name Fanny Burney) a biography of her father, Stage, Screen and Sandwiches: the Remarkable Life of Kenelm Foss.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William John Locke", "response": ["*The Wonderful Year, directed by Kenelm Foss (UK, 1921, based on the novel The Wonderful Year)"]}, {"page": "A Little Bit of Fluff (1928 film)", "response": ["This film version was predated by a 1919 film A Little Bit of Fluff directed by Kenelm Foss.
