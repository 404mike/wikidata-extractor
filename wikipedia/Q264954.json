His career began in 1906 when he joined the Hall\u00e9 Orchestra, where he became principal bassoonist in 1914.  In 1933 he moved to the BBC Symphony Orchestra, where he stayed until 1946 when he took up the same position in the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. Camden was also one of the first bassoonists to experiment with recording. His record of the Mozart bassoon concerto still remains one of the most popular today.\nAs a teacher, he was a professor of the bassoon at the Royal Manchester (now Northern) College of Music from 1914 to 1933; he later taught at the Royal College of Music in London. His most famous students included Roger Birnstingl, Michael Chapman, and Martin Gatt.  He also conducted the London Stock Exchange Orchestra.\nIn 1962, Camden published his book \"Bassoon Technique.\"  He was awarded an OBE in 1969.

Beecham later agreed with the Glyndebourne Festival that the RPO should be the resident orchestra at Glyndebourne each summer. He secured backing, including that of record companies in the US as well as Britain, with whom lucrative recording contracts were negotiated.

At the top of their list were leading musicians with whom Beecham had worked before the war. Four had been founder members of the LPO fifteen years previously: Reginald Kell (clarinet), Gerald Jackson (flute), James Bradshaw (timpani) and Jack Silvester (double-bass). From the current LPO they engaged the oboist Peter Newbury. Beecham persuaded the veteran bassoonist Archie Camden, who had been pursuing a solo career, to return to orchestral work. The cellos were led by Raymond Clark, enlisted from the BBC Symphony Orchestra. The principal horn player was Dennis Brain, who already held the same post in Legge's Philharmonia, but managed to play for both orchestras. Jenkins speculates that as Beecham knew all Britain's orchestral leaders at first hand he decided not to try to lure any of them away. His choice was John Pennington, who had been first violin of the London String Quartet from 1927 to 1934, and had then had a career in the US as concertmaster, successively, of the San Francisco Symphony, Los Angeles Philharmonic and Paramount Pictures orchestras.Jenkins (2005), pp. 99\u2013100Lucas, p. 317"]}, {"page": "Elaine Shaffer", "response": ["**Musical Offering, BWV 1079 : Ricercare / 5 Canons / Trio Sonata / 5 Canons / Ricercare - with  Archie Camden / Ronald Kinloch Anderson / Yehudi Menuhin"]}, {"page": "List of bassoonists", "response": ["*Archie Camden (1888-1979)"]}, {"page": "William Waterhouse (bassoonist)", "response": ["Born in London, William Waterhouse studied at the Royal College of Music, specifically the bassoon with Archie Camden, viola with Cecil Aronowitz, and harmony with the composer Gordon Jacob.
