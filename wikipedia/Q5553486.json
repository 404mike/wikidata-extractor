From 1926 to 1933, Hughes pursued a career as a conductor and chorus master, principally at the British National Opera Company, and also co-produced Shakespeare plays.  He left the musical profession in 1933, raising a family and working first as an executive in a railway company and later running luxury European tours.  From 1960 to 1972 he published a series of books on musical subjects, beginning with a study of the music of Arthur Sullivan, published in 1960.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Arthur Sullivan", "response": ["Sullivan wished to produce further serious works with Gilbert. He had collaborated with no other librettist since 1875. But Gilbert felt that the reaction to The Yeomen of the Guard had \"not been so convincing as to warrant us in assuming that the public want something more earnest still\". He proposed instead that Sullivan should go ahead with his plan to write a grand opera, but should continue also to compose comic works for the Savoy. Sullivan was not immediately persuaded. He replied, \"I have lost the liking for writing comic opera, and entertain very grave doubts as to my power of doing it.\" Nevertheless, Sullivan soon commissioned a grand opera libretto from Julian Sturgis (who was recommended by Gilbert), and suggested to Gilbert that he revive an old idea for an opera set in colourful Venice.Jacobs, pp. 282\u2013283 and 288; and Ainger, p. 294 The comic opera was completed first: The Gondoliers (1889) was a piece described by Gervase Hughes as a pinnacle of Sullivan's achievement.Hughes, p. 24 It was the last great Gilbert and Sullivan success.Ainger, p. 303"]}, {"page": "The Pirates of Penzance", "response": ["Sullivan set a particular vocal challenge for the soprano who portrays Mabel. The Sullivan scholar Gervase Hughes wrote, \"Mabel ... must be a coloratura because of 'Poor wand'ring one!', yet 'Dear father, why leave your bed' demands steady beauty of tone throughout the octave F to F, and 'Ah, leave me not to pine' goes a third lower still.\"Hughes, pp. 92\u201393 In The Music of Arthur Sullivan (1959), Hughes quoted four extracts from Pirates, saying that if hearing each out of context one might attribute it to Schubert, Mendelssohn, Gounod or Bizet respectively, \"yet on learning the truth one would kick oneself for not having recognised Sullivan's touch in all four.\" Hughes concluded by quoting the introductory bars of \"When a felon's not engaged in his employment\", adding, \"There could never be any doubt as to who wrote that, and it is as English as our wonderful police themselves.\"Hughes, pp. 50\u201351"]}, {"page": "Ruddigore", "response": ["The Sullivan scholar Gervase Hughes characterised Sir Roderic's song \"When the night wind howls\" as \"unquestionably the finest piece of descriptive music that Sullivan ever wrote, worthy of a place beside Schubert's Erlk\u00f6nig, Wagner's overture to The Flying Dutchman, and well above Saint-Sa\u00ebns' Danse macabre, all of which are tone-paintings in a similar colour. Although the vocal score gives not a hint of the uncanny brilliance of the orchestration, it demonstrates the sure footholds by which the music in a round dozen bars finds its way from D minor to A flat major and back and the shattering impact of the fortissimo chorus entry at an interrupted cadence on the chord of B flat major. The progressions that follow look to be unusual, but if we study them carefully we realise that here Sullivan is not feeling his way in unfamiliar territory. Rather we may find in these few bars an apotheosis of his matured harmonic resource.\"Hughes, p. 55", "The publication of the Oxford University Press edition in 2000 made it easier to restore passages deleted from the opera. Due to the many different editions available and the work's complex textual history, there is no standard performing version of Ruddigore. Comparing the two extant overtures, Gervase Hughes wrote:"]}, {"page": "Orpheus in the Underworld", "response": ["The score of the opera, which formed the pattern for the many full-length Offenbach operas that followed, is described by Faris as having an \"abundance of couplets\" (songs with repeated verses for one or more singers), \"a variety of other solos and duets, several big choruses, and two extended finales\". Offenbach wrote in a variety of styles \u2013 from Rococo pastoral vein, via pastiche of Italian opera, to the uproarious galop \u2013 displaying, in Faris's analysis, many of his personal hallmarks, such as melodies that \"leap backwards and forwards in a remarkably acrobatic manner while still sounding not only smoothly lyrical, but spontaneous as well\". In such up-tempo numbers as the \"Galop infernal\", Offenbach makes a virtue of simplicity, often keeping to the same key through most of the number, with largely unvarying instrumentation throughout.Faris, pp. 66\u201367 and 69 Elsewhere in the score Offenbach gives the orchestra greater prominence. In the \"duo de la mouche\" Jupiter's part, consisting of buzzing like a fly, is accompanied by the first and second violins playing sul ponticello, to produce a similarly buzzing sound.Offenbach-Keck, pp. 227\u2013229. In Le Figaro, Gustave Lafargue remarked that Offenbach's use of a piccolo trill punctuated by a tap on a cymbal in the finale of the first scene was a modern recreation of an effect invented by Gluck in his score of Iphig\u00e9nie en Aulide.Lafargue, Gustave. \"Chronique musicale\", Le Figaro, 10 February 1874, p. 3 (in French) Wilfrid Mellers also remarks on Offenbach's use of the piccolo to enhance Eurydice's couplets with \"girlish giggles\" on the instrument.Mellers, p. 139 Gervase Hughes comments on the elaborate scoring of the \"ballet des mouches\" [Act 3, 1874 version], and calls it \"a tour de force\" that could have inspired Tchaikovsky.Hughes (1962), p. 38"]}, {"page": "Andr\u00e9 Messager", "response": ["Gervase Hughes, in a study of French op\u00e9rette, comments that Messager's only technical defect was \"one all too common to many composers of operetta \u2013 too close an adherence to repetitive rhythmic figures and four-bar rigidity\", although such was Messager's \"innate artistry that criticism on that score would be academic pedantry\". One of the composer's distinguishing characteristics was a liking for chromaticism;Harding, p. 127 this appealed to a younger generation of composers. His \"Eh que ne parliez-vous?\", from La Basoche, was quoted note-for-note by Poulenc in Les Mamelles de Tir\u00e9sias. Although Messager greatly admired Wagner, and was a celebrated conductor of his music, he distanced himself from Wagnerian influences in his own compositions. In Madame Chrysanth\u00e8me he made use of leitmotifs, and included other references to Wagner, but such examples are rare in his works.Wagstaff, p. 17", "Although Messager called some of his early stage works op\u00e9ras comiques they have, Gervase Hughes suggests, more in common with op\u00e9rette than their composer acknowledged. Nevertheless, Messager introduced adventurous modern harmonic details in his early pieces, and strove to raise the artistic standards of op\u00e9rette to that of op\u00e9ra comique while retaining the essential panache of the genre.Hughes, p. 94 Hughes finds the first stage works uneven in quality but La Fauvette du temple (1884) to contain two fine expressive duets as well as waltzes and polkas with \"an Offenbach lilt\".Hughes, p. 92 Hughes judges the next two scores, La B\u00e9arnaise and La Fauvette (both 1885), less satisfying but nonetheless at least as good as anything by Messager's older contemporaries Planquette, Serpette and Lecocq.Hughes, p. 93"]}, {"page": "Patter song", "response": ["The musical scholar Gervase Hughes points to the patter number \"Bin Akademiker\" in Peter Cornelius's The Barber of Bagdad (1858) as a prototype of the later Gilbert and Sullivan model.Hughes, p. 79"]}, {"page": "Pineapple Poll", "response": ["The score, or excerpts from it, has been recorded at least seven times, including four performances conducted by Mackerras himself.The first, with Mackerras conducting the Sadler's Wells Orchestra, was made on 7 & 8 June 1951 at the Abbey Road Studios and released two months later on six 78 rpm records. Gervase Hughes wrote, \"Although the orchestration is disfigured by over-reliance on glissando harps and succulent counter-subjects for the horns, much of the music comes over well in its new guise, and the combination of a melody from the opening chorus of Patience with the second act quintet from The Gondoliers is quite brilliant.\"Hughes, p. 161 A black-and-white studio film of Pineapple Poll, danced by the Royal Ballet, with the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Mackerras, was broadcast by BBC television in 1959.

Lamb remarks on the themes for trombones and lower strings in the second movement, which \"lend the work an especial solemnity\", and finds the general mood of the symphony quite serious. Nonetheless Lamb  finds that work \"also displays Sullivan at his lightest, above all in the joyous third movement \u2026 with its jaunty theme for oboe and delightful interplay between pizzicato strings and bubbling woodwind.\"Lamb, Andrew. Notes to Chandos CD 9859 (2000)  In 2006 the analyst Andrew Burn commented that the finale displays an early example of one of the composer's favourite devices: a melody, first heard on the oboe, is combined in counterpoint with a rhythmic theme in the first violins: \"Such a device was to become a hallmark of the composer in the double choruses of his operettas\"."]}, {"page": "1984 in British music", "response": ["* July \u2013 Gervase Hughes, composer, 78"]}, {"page": "Hughes (surname)", "response": ["*Gervase Hughes (1905\u20131984), English composer"]}, {"page": "Eric Blom", "response": ["He assisted Gervase Hughes in the writing of his book The Music of Arthur Sullivan.
