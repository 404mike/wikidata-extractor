Another theme Saito pointed out was love, which he stated was unusual given that all the central cast were robots, which were not normally associated with emotions. Yoko also used the androids' and Machines' reverence for the long-extinct humanity to show how people's sense of self and worth is necessarily founded on belief in something else. The negative influence of human history on the factions also reflected his views on how people continue to fight and create boundaries between themselves despite their advancement. A recurring element from Yoko's earlier work was his examination of why people kill, and the impact of killing on others\u2014this stems from his observation of people coming to enjoy killing enemies encountered in games, which suggested to him that something was wrong or missing inside them. The darkness of the narrative was explained by Yoko as reflecting the inherent darkness of reality. The narrative makes reference to numerous influential philosophers and thinkers, with some Machine characters being named after them such as supporting character Pascal (Blaise Pascal), boss character Simone (Simone de Beauvoir), and NPC Jean-Paul (Jean-Paul Sartre). Yoko used books by Will Buckingham and Nigel Benson, which respectively explained philosophy and psychology in understandable language, as a reference for the narrative."]}]}}
