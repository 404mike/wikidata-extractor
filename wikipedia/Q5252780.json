They divorced after eight months, and Sheena decided to keep the surname Easton. That year, one of her tutors coaxed her into auditioning for Esther Rantzen, producer of the BBC programme The Big Time. Rantzen was planning a documentary film to chronicle a relative unknown's rise to pop-music stardom. Easton was selected as the subject for the programme; EMI executives awarded her a contract, and Christopher Neil was assigned as her recording producer. Deke Arlon became her first manager, and Easton spent much of 1980 being followed by camera crews, who filmed her throughout the process of her audition through to making her first EMI single, \"Modern Girl\". In the course of the filming, she met and sang for Dorothy Squires, Dusty Springfield and Lulu, whose manager Marion Massey told her that she saw Easton as a potential TV star with her own series, but not as a pop singer for the 1980s as she lacked \"rugged individuality\"."]}, {"page": "UK national selection for the Eurovision Song Contest", "response": ["| Deke Arlon, Gary Davies, Leslie Bricusse, Lulu"]}, {"page": "Deke arlon", "response": ["#REDIRECT Deke Arlon "]}, {"page": "Helen Watson (singer-songwriter)", "response": ["Watson made a demo tape with McGroarty which found its way to Keith Hopwood at Pluto Music.
