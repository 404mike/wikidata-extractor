Lynch (born 17 October 1948),  is an emeritus professor at the department of Science and Technology Studies at Cornell University. His works are particularly concerned with ethnomethodological approaches in science studies.

Using an appropriate Southern California example: ethno refers to a particular socio-cultural group (for example, a particular, local community of surfers); method refers to the methods and practices this particular group employs in its everyday activities (for example, related to surfing); and ology refers to the systematic description of these methods and practices. The focus of the investigation used in our example is the social order of surfing, the ethnomethodological interest is in the \"how\" (the methods and practices) of the production and maintenance of this social order. In essence ethnomethodology attempts to create classifications of the social actions of individuals within groups through drawing on the experience of the groups directly, without imposing on the setting the opinions of the researcher with regards to social order, as is the case with other forms of sociological investigation.Michael Lynch, Scientific Practice and Ordinary Action: Ethnomethodology and Social Studies of Science, Cambridge UP, 1993.", "Similarly, ethnomethodology advocates no formal methods of enquiry, insisting that the research method be dictated by the nature of the phenomenon that is being studied. Ethnomethodologists have conducted their studies in a variety of ways, and the point of these investigations is \"to discover the things that persons in particular situations do, the methods they use, to create the patterned orderliness of social life\". Michael Lynch has noted that: \"Leading figures in the field have repeatedly emphasised that there is no obligatory set of methods [employed by ethnomethodologists], and no prohibition against using any research procedure whatsoever, if it is adequate to the particular phenomena under study\".Michael Lynch, The Social Science Encyclopedia, Routledge, 2nd Ed., 1989.Garfinkel, H. & Wieder, D.

She also studied classical and medieval Latin with Emily Albu (pursuing research on women in the classical and medieval period). Yearly conferences in ethnomethodology brought students and colleagues from around the world to Boston University (including Harold Garfinkel, Harvey Sacks, Gail Jefferson, Emanuel Schegloff, Christian Heath, Michael Lynch, Anita Pomerantz, David Sudnow, Charles and Marjorie Harness Goodwin, Wes Sharrock, John Heritage, Rod Watson, Douglas Maynard, Paul Drew, Alene Terasaki, John O\u2019Neill, Jim Heap, and Lindsey Churchill).\u00a0It was these meetings, and Garfinkel's presence at them in 1975, that eventually led to Rawls' collaborative relationship with Harold Garfinkel.", "Recent publications from the Garfinkel Archive include Parsons\u2019 Primer (2019) (for which Rawls co-authored an introduction with Jason Turowetz), and The History of Gulfport Field 1942 (2019) (co-edited with Michael Lynch). Written in 1962 but published for the first time in 2019, Parsons' Primer documents the little known collaboration between Garfinkel and Parsons and the mutual influences these scholars, who are traditionally placed on opposite ends of the sociological spectrum, had on one another\u2019s work. In particular, it shows how Garfinkel and Parsons each put interaction at the center of their theories, and how this move embedded a radical critique of mainstream social theory, which tends to remain centered on individuals rather than on interactions (treating interaction in terms of connections between pre-existing individuals, rather than as the social rules and expectations that are used to make self and meaning in the first place). \u201cA History of Gulfport Field 1942,\u201d Garfinkel\u2019s report to the U.S. military on the training of airplane mechanics during WW-II, can in important respects be considered the first \"hybrid study\" of work, an approach to the sociology of work that Garfinkel (1986) pioneered and would popularize in subsequent decades.", "The research center aims at the development of a digital praxeology, that is informed by Ethnomethodology and Garfinkel's research available in the Archive.
