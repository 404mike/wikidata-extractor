FitzRoy had thought of the advantages of having someone onboard who could investigate geology, and sought a naturalist to accompany them as a supernumerary. At the age of 22, the graduate Charles Darwin hoped to see the tropics before becoming a parson and accepted the opportunity. He was greatly influenced by reading Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology during the voyage.

When a ship's boat was taken by the natives of Tierra del Fuego, FitzRoy tried taking some of them hostage, and after this failed he got occupants of a canoe to put another on the ship in exchange for buttons.

There seems to have been no particular fault in their design, but they were considered to be somewhat too small for the global duties they took on.Gardiner, Robert (Ed.) (1998) The Naval War of 1812, Chatham Publishing, London, p. 90. Almost a quarter of them were lost, and they were also nicknamed \"Half Tide Rock\" as they had low freeboard so the deck was frequently awash with water, and solid bulwarks preventing the water from being shed quickly.  William James, in his Naval History written before May 1827, dismissed the supposed design faults, and said that it would be \"surprising indeed that the navy board would continue adding new individuals by dozens at a time\" to \"this worthless class\". These open flush-decked ships lacked a forecastle to deflect heavy seas crashing over the bow: one was added to Beagle in 1825 before its first voyage, together with a mizzen mast which improved the handling. Despite these modifications to the design, Captain Pringle Stokes protested that \"our decks were constantly flooded\". ", "The first voyage of Beagle set out in 1826 under Captain Pringle Stokes as part of Phillip Parker King's survey of South American coasts, which returned late in 1830 with Beagle by then commanded by Robert FitzRoy. Captain Henry Foster commanded HMS Chanticleer on his survey around the South Atlantic, known as his \"pendulum expedition\", from 1827 to 1831. Chanticleer was then intended to be used for FitzRoy's next survey expedition, but was found to be in poor condition. Instead, the Beagle was repaired and modified for its famed second survey voyage from 1831 to 1836, which took along the naturalist Charles Darwin as a self-funded supernumerary. The Beagle subsequently carried out a survey of coasts of Australia from 1837 to 1843 under John Clements Wickham and John Lort Stokes.
