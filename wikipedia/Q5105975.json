Bull was unable to save the club and on 7 April 2008, Rangers were relegated to the Conference North following a 4\u20130 defeat at home to York City. He left the club on 12 December, being replaced by Chris Brindley, who was assistant manager under Bull.  At the end of the 2009 season, Stafford Rangers' future was uncertain as they needed to pay Slick Seating \u00a350,000 by 7 July. The club came up with the idea of selling 250 tickets at \u00a3200, that would be repaid in weekly draws, this worked and the club was saved from going into administration.", "|  Chris Brindley"]}]}}
