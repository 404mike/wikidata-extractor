Editor (Primitive Methodist publishing), author and historian, Kendall wrote three separate histories of the Primitive Methodist Church which came to be regarded as the definitive history of the Church.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Primitive Methodism in the United Kingdom", "response": ["The Wesleyan \"clergy\" derived its income from the Church and had a vested interest in ensuring a conservative policy. It was easier for men from the lower sorts, artisans like Bourne and Clowes. Bourne was a successful businessman (a carpenter whose contacts included supplying pit-props for local coal mines) and Clowes was a master potter, who had worked his way up from working in potteries as a young boy and married into the Wedgwood family. They both had considerable education, though not at university like John Wesley, but through their own hard work earning a living. Did they have less to lose? What counted for them was a sensed call of God to continue the evangelistic work of John Wesley. In taking the name \"Primitive Methodist\", the Prims looked back to the original and unspoiled Christianity of both John Wesley and (Wesley's reference) of the Book of Acts. By contrast to the academic treatises on Primitive Methodism, original Primitive Methodist sources included definitive histories by Holliday Bickerstaffe Kendall, early biographies of Hugh Bourne like that by Jesse Ashworth from personal acquaintance, and Joseph Ritson's classic The Romance of Primitive Methodism. These illustrate a vibrant movement which the establishment was unwilling to entertain, due partly to weariness of persecutions in the 18th century, and to political upheavals after the French Revolution and various wars in which Britain was engaged. In fact Bourne was much concerned that things be done decently and in order, and worked hard to build up the official (Wesleyan) Methodist Circuit of which he had once been a member. He had founded and built at least one Chapel, largely at his own expense, given to the Circuit. It was the issue of Camp Meetings, which Bourne and his companions saw as blessed by God, that led to their expulsion. They had not sought to found a new and separate denomination or put revivalism ahead of expediency. They had less to lose. So the Primitive Methodist movement can be seen as a reaction to the Wesleyan drive towards respectability and denominationalism. It was led by the poor and for the poor."]}, {"page": "Hugh Bourne", "response": ["Often overlooked is the change following what may be called \"Hugh Bourne's Pentecost\".

This began the time of revival when some key Primitive Methodist leaders, most importantly William Clowes, were converted.Joseph Ritson, \"The Romance of Primitive Methodism\" (1909), ch 3", "Another difference of emphasis between Hugh Bourne and some of the Wesleyans of his time was his desire to follow closely the teaching of John Wesley in the mid eighteenth century.  Weary with persecution, many Wesleyans, though true to the same doctrines, had toned down their preaching in an effort to court respectability.W H Simcock, \"Primitive Methodism in the Leek Moorlands\", 1970 This was one of the factors behind the 1807 Methodist Conference's condemnation of Camp Meetings.  The Minutes (widely quoted in Holliday Bickerstaffe Kendall and most histories of Primitive Methodism) say, \"It is our judgment, that even supposing such meetings to be allowable in America, they are highly improper in England, and likely to be productive of considerable mischief; and we disclaim all connection with them.\"Holliday Bickerstaffe Kendall, \"History of the Primitive Methodist Connexion\", (1888) p. 32"]}, {"page": "Ramshorn", "response": ["Ramsor is frequently mentioned in Hugh Bourne's writings, and it is obvious from these that he frequently visited the village.
