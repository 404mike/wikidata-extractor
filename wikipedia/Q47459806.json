During his time as a student he played non-league football for Dereham Town and Team Northumbria. He helped Dareham to win the Eastern Counties League Premier Division championship title in 2012\u201313. He joined Gateshead in 2016, and after returning from a dual registration spell at South Shields managed to established himself in the first-team. He was signed by Port Vale in January 2018, before he made a return to Cambridge United in May 2019 and helped the club to win promotion out of League Two at the end of the 2020\u201321 season. He remained in League Two however, as he left Cambridge to join Colchester United.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Luke (given name)", "response": ["*Luke Hannant (born 1993), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Dereham", "response": ["The programme allows students to follow a Level 3 BTEC in Sport alongside A levels and/or GCSE Maths and English retakes while also being part of a football academy.

Aspin remarked that the four centre-backs brought in did not cost the club much financially, and that he would have liked to have strengthened in other areas \"but for one reason or another it just hasn't happened\". However he managed to convert Cristian Monta\u00f1o from a winger to a left-back and Antony Kay from a centre-half to a central midfielder, and guided the club to safety with two games to spare. Vale ended the campaign in 20th-place \u2013 the joint-lowest finish in the club's history \u2013 with just one point above the relegation zone, having been out of the relegation zone on goal difference upon Aspin's arrival at the club."]}, {"page": "John Askey", "response": ["Askey let 14 players go and signed 14 new players for the 2019\u201320 season, with big names departing including Ben Whitfield, Luke Hannant and Ricky Miller, whilst backup goalkeeper Sam Hornby chose to leave after rejecting a new contract offer. Coming into the club were goalkeeper Jonny Maddison; defenders Adam Crookes, Kieran Kennedy and Shaun Brisley; midfielders Scott Burgess, Ryan Lloyd, Callum Evans, Alex Hurst and Jake Taylor (on loan); wingers David Amoo and Rhys Browne; and strikers Mark Cullen, Richie Bennett and Jordan McFarlane-Archer. He was again nominated for the League Two Manager of the Month, with the EFL writing that \"Slow and steady has been Vale's progress under Askey's astute management this season. Their consistency in February - three wins, three draws and 12 goals from six games - finally lifted his side into the play-off positions.\" However the club were one place outside the play-offs when the season was called off due to the COVID-19 pandemic in England."]}, {"page": "2017\u201318 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["Aspin signed three players and four loanees in the January transfer window, the most significant addition being that of Luke Hannant; meanwhile three players and four loanees left the club, the biggest loss being Gavin Gunning, who went to relegation rivals Forest Green Rovers. Vale went 14 games without a win at the start of 2018, but victory over Chesterfield on Good Friday eased genuine concerns of relegation into the National League. Nevertheless, a run of just two wins in their 21 games in 2018 meant that they finished in 20th-place, the joint-lowest finish in the club's history. They remained largely reliant on Player of the Year Tom Pope's 19 goals to stay in the league.", "Vale opened the New Year with a 1\u20130 defeat at second-placed Notts County, and though Aspin was pleased with his players he was highly critical of the referee for his award of a late penalty, calling it \"a really bad decision\". Earlier in the day he made his second signing as manager, bringing in striker Dior Angus from non-league Redditch United. Meanwhile, Gavin Gunning left the club on the expiry of his contract, whilst Jack Stobbs, Rekeil Pyke and Tyler Denton returned to their parent clubs. In contrast, Whitfield's loan was extended until the end of the season. Gunning made his debut for Forest Green on 6 January, and kept a clean sheet as Rovers beat the Vale 1\u20130 with a goal from fellow d\u00e9butante Reuben Reid; Aspin apologized to supporters after the match for the team's performance. Aspin went on to allow Lawrie Wilson to join National League side Ebbsfleet United after the full-back failed to make the first-team under his tenure. He also agreed to terminate the contract of French midfielder Anthony de Freitas, whilst bringing in striker Donovan Wilson on loan from Wolverhampton Wanderers. Vale put in a poor performance at home to Yeovil, though did claim a 1\u20131 draw after Pope converted a late penalty. Aspin went on to sign midfielder Luke Hannant from Gateshead for an undisclosed fee, having previously signed the 24-year old from Team Northumbria in 2016. He also boosted the defensive numbers by bringing in centre-back Zak Jules on loan from Shrewsbury Town. Hannant made his debut at Accrington Stanley on 20 January, a game in which Vale led 2\u20130 at half-time only to lose 3\u20132; Aspin went on to criticise both the referee for failing to spot a handball for Accrington's equaliser and also his team for poor defending. Jules made his debut and Lainton returned to the starting eleven for the visit of Colchester on 27 January, and Vale managed to secure a 2\u20132 draw despite a poor performance thanks to a brace from Worrall. A surprise departure was then announced, as Anderson was recalled early from his loan spell by Burnley. Aspin responded quickly by signing former youth-team centre-back Charlie Raglan on loan from Oxford United, 21-year old defender Kyle Howkins on loan from West Bromwich Albion and 23-year old defender Callum Howe for an undisclosed fee from Lincoln City.", "|align=\"left\"|MF||34||align=\"left\"| Luke Hannant", "|\u2013||MF||||34||Luke Hannant||1||0||0||0||1", "|34||||MF||Luke Hannant||5||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||5||0", "| 18 January 2018 || CM ||  || Luke Hannant || Gateshead || \u00a310,000 || "]}, {"page": "2018\u201319 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["Despite investing heavily in the summer, Notts County came to Vale Park on 3 November just one place above the relegation zone, and both sides had to be satisfied with a 2\u20132 draw after a late diving header from Pope rescued a point just two minutes after Elliott Ward had put County ahead on 87 minutes; in the first half Kane Hemmings had cancelled out Luke Hannant's early header. Both Aspin and County manager Harry Kewell claimed their sides deserved to win the game. Two weeks later, Vale travelled to Mansfield Town and fell to a 1\u20130 defeat, with Oyeleke sent off on his return from injury after receiving two yellow cards. Vale then slipped to a 1\u20130 defeat at home to Swindon Town in front of just 3,877 spectators for a Saturday fixture, and failed to create any meaningful chances throughout the game.
