The BBC received 82 complaints by the following morning while some, including Shamrock Rovers player Rohan Ricketts, criticised Hansen's choice of words on social network Twitter. Ricketts tweeted: \"He is part of the problem when using that word. We are BLACK Alan!\". Others defended his use of words. The Daily Telegraph blogger and commentator Toby Young wrote: \"In his defence, Hansen could cite the fact that America's foremost civil rights group is the NAACP which stands for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. If it's acceptable for the NAACP to use the word \"coloured\", why isn't it acceptable for him?\" Hansen issued an apology the following day, saying \"'I unreservedly apologise for any offence caused \u2013 this was never my intention and I deeply regret the use of the word.\""]}, {"page": "List of foreign MLS players", "response": ["*Rohan Ricketts \u2013 Toronto \u2013 2008\u201309"]}, {"page": "North London derby", "response": ["|align=left|Rohan Ricketts||MF"]}, {"page": "SV Wilhelmshaven", "response": ["*  Rohan Ricketts - former Premier League, Football League Championship and Major League Soccer player & former member of the England national under-20 football team"]}, {"page": "2007\u201308 Barnsley F.C. season", "response": ["Midfield: Anderson Silva de Franca (On loan from Everton), Jamal Campbell-Ryce (Southend United), Dominik Werling (Sakaryaspor), Andy Johnson (Leicester City), Rohan Ricketts (Wolverhampton Wanderers)"]}, {"page": "List of Major League Soccer transfers 2008", "response": ["* Rohan Ricketts Free transfer from  Barnsley"]}, {"page": "2007\u201308 Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. season", "response": ["| June 2007 || Rohan Ricketts ||align=\"center\"| Released ||align=\"center\"| Free"]}, {"page": "List of Toronto FC seasons", "response": ["|align=\"left\" |  Rohan Ricketts"]}, {"page": "Canadian Championship", "response": ["|Rohan Ricketts"]}, {"page": "2008 Canadian Championship", "response": ["|| Rohan Ricketts||Toronto FC"]}, {"page": "2008 Toronto FC season", "response": ["|align=\"center\"  | 10 || align=\"center\" | MF || align=\"left\" |  Rohan Ricketts", "|style=\"text-align:left;\"|  Rohan Ricketts"]}, {"page": "2002\u201303 Arsenal F.C. season", "response": ["!scope=\"row\"| Rohan Ricketts"]}, {"page": "2008 MLS Expansion Draft", "response": ["|Rohan Ricketts||Kevin Harmse||"]}, {"page": "2009 Toronto FC season", "response": ["|align=\"center\" | 10 || align=\"center\" | MF || align=\"left\" |  Rohan Ricketts1", "| 10 || MF || Rohan Ricketts1"]}, {"page": "2003\u201304 Tottenham Hotspur F.C. season", "response": ["|| MF || 27 || align=\"left\" | Rohan Ricketts|| 1 || 0 || 1 ||2"]}, {"page": "2002\u201303 Tottenham Hotspur F.C. season", "response": ["*  Rohan Ricketts \u2013  Arsenal, 13 July, free"]}, {"page": "2011 Shamrock Rovers F.C. season", "response": ["|27||MF||align=\"left\"| Rohan Ricketts", "|Rohan Ricketts", "!Rohan Ricketts"]}, {"page": "2006\u201307 Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. season", "response": ["|22 March 2007|| Rohan Ricketts||align=\"center\"|Queens Park Rangers||align=\"center\"|End of season "]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Stevenage F.C. season", "response": [" New signing Phil Edwards had missed a second-half penalty for Stevenage, firing wide after Byron Harrison was fouled in the area.
