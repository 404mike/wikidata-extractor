Hancock made his debut for Derbyshire in the 1897 season aged 20.  In May against Lancashire he took 4 wickets at a cost of 140 runs. He played regularly for the next three years. In the 1898 season he achieved his best bowling performance with 5 for 61 against Yorkshire. The 1899 season was Hancock's best for batting, when his average reached 11.43 and he scored 43 not out against Hampshire. Hancock left Derbyshire in 1900 after playing three matches in the 1900 season.

Most of the remaining newcomers were from mining families. Frank Davidson, Joseph Hancock and William Wilmot each played over several more seasons but more or less occasionally. James Cross, Herbert Bostock, Dick Steeples and Edward Houseman all appeared only in the 1897 season, Cross playing nine matches, Bostock four, Steeples three and Houseman one. Cross and Steeples filled in for the lack of bowling, while Bostock achieved a high average in his three games."]}, {"page": "Edwin Kirk", "response": ["Nelson made a single first-class appearance for Warwickshire against Derbyshire in the 1898 County Championship at Edgbaston. Derbyshire won the toss and elected to bat first, making 266 all out, to which Warwickshire responded to in their first-innings by making 485/8 declared, during which Kirk was dismissed for a duck by Joseph Hancock. Derbyshire then reached 161/3 in their second-innings, at which point the match was declared a draw. This was his only major appearance for Warwickshire."]}, {"page": "Hancock, Joseph", "response": ["#redirectJoseph Hancock"]}]}}
