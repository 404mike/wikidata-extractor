Players that Still has developed that have gone on to play at a higher level include Marlon King, Craig Mackail-Smith, Paul Benson, Sam Saunders, Danny Green, and Dwight Gayle. Dagenham & Redbridge managing director Steve Thompson has stated that Still's ability to do this kept the club consistently able to compete while operating on a far smaller budget than its rivals. Still's reputation for nurturing talent, combined with his vast array of contacts within the game gained through decades of coaching, have also led to highly rated young players from Premier League academies joining his teams on loan. Examples include Marlon Pack and Matt Ritchie at Dagenham, and Cameron McGeehan, Pelly Ruddock Mpanzu and Elliot Lee at Luton."]}, {"page": "Jack Marriott (footballer)", "response": ["Marriott signed for League Two club Luton Town on a one-year contract on 20 May 2015.

Luton manager John Still, who was adamant he didn't deserve the red card said, \"He shouldn't have done it but the punishment didn't fit the crime.\" Marriott scored a brace in consecutive substitute appearances against AFC Wimbledon and Hartlepool United, which resulted in two wins in a week to increase his tally for the season to six goals. He went on to score twice in 20 appearances, including a goalless drought of 10 matches, before scoring a consolation goal in a 4\u20131 defeat away to AFC Wimbledon on 13 February 2016.
