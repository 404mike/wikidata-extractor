He was originally from Lewis, but spent much of his life in Glasgow, where he was Professor of Celtic at the University of Glasgow from 1963 to 1991. He is best known for setting up the publishing house Gairm, along with its magazine, which was the longest-running periodical ever to be written entirely in Gaelic, running for over fifty years under his editorship. Gairm has since ceased, and was replaced by Gath and then STEALL. He was an Honorary President of the Scottish Poetry Library, and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and the British Academy. In June 2007, he received an honorary degree from Glasgow University.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ossian", "response": ["In 1952, the Scottish literary scholar Derick Thomson investigated the sources for Macpherson's work and concluded that Macpherson had collected genuine Scottish Gaelic ballads, employing scribes to record those that were preserved orally and collating manuscripts, but had adapted them by altering the original characters and ideas, and had introduced a great deal of his own."]}, {"page": "Sorley MacLean", "response": ["The book has been the subject of scholarly debate. Attempting to explain why MacLean's earlier poetry has had the greatest influence, Derick Thomson wrote that it is love poetry which is most timeless, while MacLean's political poetry has not aged as well. According to Maoilios Caimbeul, \"There is not, and I doubt there will ever be, a series of love poems\" that would have as much influence on Gaelic literature. Ronald Black suggested that \"duty [is not]... a comprehensible emotion nowadays\" and therefore \"the greatest universal in MacLean's verse is the depiction of that extraordinary psychosis which is called being in love\". However, this type of commentary has been criticized as an attempt to depoliticize MacLean's work. Seamus Heaney argued that Eimhir was similar to Beatrice in Dante's Divine Comedy, in that Eimhir \"resolves at a symbolic level tensions which would otherwise be uncontainable or wasteful\". Scottish poet Iain Crichton Smith said, \"there is a sense in which the Spanish Civil War does not form the background to these poems, but is the protagonist\".", "*Black, Ronald (2017). \u201cSorley MacLean, Derick Thomson, and the Women Most Dangerous to Men.\u201d The Bottle Imp 21: June 2017.

However, Crichton Smith also produced much Gaelic poetry and prose, and also translated some of the work of Sorley Maclean from Gaelic to English, as well as some of his own poems originally composed in Gaelic.
