Georgeson derived the name for his band from a second-hand copy of My Magic Life, the autobiography of the great English stage magician, David Devant (1868\u20131941).

Georgeson took the name for his band from a second-hand copy of My Magic Life, the autobiography of the great English stage magician, David Devant. A Devant show was conceived as an act of invocation, in which the spirit of the late magician would speak through Georgeson, and the songs would summon down the Spirit Wife. In concert, Georgeson performed as \"the Vessel\", wearing a black pompadour wig and a pencil moustache."]}, {"page": "Bom-Bane's", "response": ["Bom-Bane's 2014 May fringe show was inspired by Brighton's lost secret river, an intermittent stream called the Wellesbourne. Five audience members were invited to follow the river, as it flowed from its source in the attic to 'a sea-bound chorus in the cellar, followed by a feast of foods foraged en route.' Rachel Blackman described the show in Fringe Review: 'We are invited into her bedroom for one act and her bathroom for another. We trace the river through rooms in the house, all the way down to the restaurant level, gathering cast members as the river itself gathers momentum. Finally we land in the restaurant area where we are fed a three course meal of simple, delicious fare sourced locally.'Rachel Blackman, 'The Long Lost River Song', Fringe Review, 29 May 2014 4 For this show, the company comprised Jane Bom-Bane, Eliza Skelton, Foz Foster, Colin Uttley, Freya Bowyes, Martin Peters, Lynne Thomas, Sarah Angliss and Daisy Jordan.", "Bom-Banimals, in May 2016, was an animal themed fantasia, again taking place throughout the building. An audience of six was invited to move from room to room, encountering a series of musical animals (Eliza Skelton, Foz Foster, Kate Daisy Grant, Raven Kaliana, Jo McDonagh, Sebas Contreras, Kate Vaughan, and Tom Walker). Rachel Blackman described the experience in Fringe Review: 'We barely manage to squeeze into each of the modest spaces with the performers who gradually accumulate and eventually outnumber us. In each room we meet a different animal, all of whom must sacrifice a beloved item in order to find their authentic voice....if there is a message to be had, it is a light one, but touches on the notion that if we love someone, giving a piece of ourselves is a risk, but can pay off one hundredfold....And a plea maybe for the ongoing existence of this kind of intimate, real time, unrepeatable experience, where the value to each of us is so much more rich, raw and indescribable than the price of a ticket.' The show was also reviewed in Total Theatre and received five stars from the Argus."]}]}}
