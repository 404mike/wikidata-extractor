His debut season for Derbyshire in the 1875 season saw him play in four county matches, his first, an innings victory over Kent, in which he took a five-wicket haul in the second innings, chosen ahead of the usual bowling pair of William Mycroft and William Hickton. He followed this up with two County matches in the 1876 season. In 1877 Hay was playing professionally for Eland and played just one first-class match for Derbyshire in the 1875 season, scoring 31 not out, the highest score of his career thus far.\nHay was back with Derbyshire in the 1878 season, still beating Hickton to the mantle of second-choice bowler, though now he had to shake competition off from John Platts, in the same position. Though he never played as often as he did during the 1878 season on any further occasions, Hay's round-arm bowling was at times preferred to John Platts' occasional deceptively-layered pace. In the 1879 season Hay put in fewer games for Derbyshire as he was playing for Keighley.\nIn the 1880 season, Derbyshire's first match of the season was against the touring Australians, fresh in their existence as a Test nation and with several young players at their disposal. The Derbyshire bowling pair of Mycroft and Hay dealt soundly with the Australians, but then the same treatment was dealt to the Derbyshire team in a second-innings eight-wicket haul by Fred Spofforth. Hay then played four more non-status games against the Australians \u2013 for a scratch Derbyshire team, for Keighley and twice for Wermeth, maintaining his duel with Spofforth who was later to become a Derbyshire captain. Hay appeared in eight county matches for the team during 1880, scoring more runs in this season than in any other of his career. The 1881 season was nearly as successful a season, Hay playing in six county matches, Derbyshire winning two. From here on, Hay was on the playing staff of Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) where he played matches against minor counties, while still putting in five games for Derbyshire over the next five years. His two final first-class matches were in teams made up of a variety of players from all the major cricketing counties.\nHay was a right-arm round-arm fast-medium bowler and took 148 first-class wickets at an average of 16.51 and a best performance of 6\u201316. He was a right-handed batsman and played 94 innings in 55 first-class matches with a top score of 49 and an average of 8.57.Hay umpired one first-class game in 1884 and after his retirement from playing, he took charge of nearly 70 first-class matches between 1887 and 1897, including several in the early years of the County Championship with a finalsingle game in 1902.\nHay also played football, and was a goalkeeper for Staveley F.C., then an important club. It was in a game in January 1889 against Grimsby Town that William Cropper, Hay's friend and teammate at Staveley and Derbyshire County Cricket Club, collapsed after a collision on the pitch and died in Hay's arms in the dressing room.Hay died at Staveley at the age of 62.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Hay", "response": ["George Hay may refer to:", "*George Hay, 7th Earl of Erroll (1508\u20131573), Scottish nobleman and politician", "*George Hay (Virginia judge) (1765\u20131830), United States politician and judge", "*George Hay (politician) (1715\u20131778), Member of Parliament and Dean of the Arches", "*George Hay (bishop) (1729\u20131811), Vicar Apostolic of Lowland Scotland", "*George Hay (ice hockey) (1898\u20131975), Canadian hockey forward", "*George Hay (minister) (c.1530\u20131588), Church of Scotland minister", "*George Hay (writer), founder of the Science Fiction Foundation", "*George Hay, 1st Earl of Kinnoull (1570\u20131634), Lord Chancellor of Scotland", "*George Hay, 2nd Earl of Kinnoull (1596\u20131644), Scottish peer, military officer, and political official", "*George Hay, 3rd Earl of Kinnoull (died 1650), Scottish peer and military officer", "*George Hay, 5th Earl of Kinnoull (died 1687), Scottish peer and soldier", "*George Hay, 8th Earl of Kinnoull (1689\u20131758)", "*George Hay, 7th Marquess of Tweeddale (1753\u20131804), Scottish peer", "*George Hay, 12th Earl of Kinnoull (1827\u20131897)", "*George Hay, 14th Earl of Kinnoull (1902\u20131938), Scottish peer", "*George Hay, 8th Marquess of Tweeddale (1787\u20131876), British field marshal", "*George Hay, fictional character in the play Moon Over Buffalo", "*George Hay (cricketer) (1851\u20131913), English cricketer who played for Derbyshire, 1875\u20131886", "*George Hay (footballer)  1930s, Scottish footballer for Third Lanark and Queen of the South", "*George Hay, Earl of Gifford (1822\u20131862), British Liberal Party politician", "*George Hays (disambiguation)", "*George Hayes (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "Alfort Smith", "response": ["After a year out of the game, Smith transferred his allegiance to Derbyshire and played one match in the 1873 season which was a return match against his old side of Lancashire.
