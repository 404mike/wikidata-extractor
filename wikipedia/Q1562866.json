The Sicilian noun mafiusu (in Italian: mafioso) roughly translates to mean \"swagger,\" but can also be translated as \"boldness, bravado\". In reference to a man, mafiusu in 19th-century Sicily was ambiguous, signifying a bully, arrogant but also fearless, enterprising and proud, according to scholar Diego Gambetta.This etymology is based on the books Mafioso by Gaia Servadio, The Sicilian Mafia by Diego Gambetta, and Cosa Nostra by John Dickie (see Books below). In reference to a woman, however, the feminine-form, \"mafiusa\", means a beautiful or attractive female. The Sicilian word mafie refers to the caves near Trapani and Marsala, which were often used as hiding places for refugees and criminals."]}, {"page": "List of people associated with University College London", "response": ["* John Dickie, Professor in Italian Studies"]}, {"page": "Cassata", "response": ["The Arabic word qas'ah, from which cassata may derive, refers to the bowl that is used to shape the cake.

He was convinced that establishing partnerships with criminal gangs would accelerate the strategia della tensione (literally, the \"strategy of tension\"), the process by which \"revolutionary\" activity would exacerbate public discontent and bring about the fall of the democratic state, and to this end he had by the late 1970s cultivated close ties with the recently-established Roman criminal syndicate, the Banda della Magliana, whose meetings were often organised by him at his summer villa in Rieti. Carlo Lucarelli, Storie di bande criminali, di mafie e di persone oneste: dai Misteri d'Italia di Blu notte (Turin: Einaudi, 2008), p. 143. Alongside the former parliamentarian Fabio De Felice and history professor Paolo Signorelli, Semerari also hosted a number of seminars with various far-right militants at around this time, which Jeffrey Bale suggests were convened to discuss a \"new decentralized and self-financing terrorist strategy\", modelled on the activities of the Red Brigades, that could \"consolidate the remnants of various extremist groups\" in the face of official state crackdowns and the flight of several neo-fascist leaders to \"safer havens abroad\".Jeffrey Bale, 'The \"Black\" Terrorist International: Neo-Fascist Paramilitary Networks and the \"Strategy of Tension\" in Italy, 1968-1974', Ph.D. thesis, University of California, Berkeley (1994), p. 427. Bale notes that the seminars' participants frequently disagreed about which was the best route to achieve their goals, with Semerari and De Felice emerging as the leaders of a \"traditionalist\" faction that eschewed direct revolutionary action in favour of constructing a logistical base that would bring together like-minded militant groups and individuals.Bale, '\"Black\" Terrorist International', p. 428."]}, {"page": "John Dickie", "response": ["John Dickie may refer to:", "* John Dickie (evangelist), Scottish evangelist and writer", "* John Dickie (historian) (born 1963), British author, historian and academic", "* John Dickie (theologian), New Zealand Presbyterian theologian and professor", "* John Dickie (footballer) (1900-1976), Scottish footballer, played for Barrow"]}, {"page": "John Dickie (academic)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Dickie (historian)"]}, {"page": "Salvatore Lupo", "response": ["* Il tenebroso sodalizio.
