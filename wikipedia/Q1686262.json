Sheffield United alum Terry Nicholl became known as \"The General\" during his time in Wichita due to his ability to coach on the field. Jeff Bourne was a potent scorer who had played in the English first division with Derby County. The Danish connection continued to bear fruit as the Wings added midfielder Frank Rasmussen to the squad. That year's Wings squad was very successful, finishing with a 27-17 record. Though the Wings would defeat the Memphis Americans in the playoff quarterfinals, they would once again fall to the Steamers in the semis. Off the field, a new force provided a strong backbone to the Wings efforts. The Orange Army, a group of dedicated fans, followed the Wings wherever they went.

The American Soccer League collapsed following the 1983 season.  This led to the creation of the United Soccer League in 1984. The Slickers joined the new league, changing their name to the Oklahoma City Stampede.  The club once again came tantalizingly close to a league championship, winning the regular-season title on point differential over the Fort Lauderdale Sun but falling in the semifinals to the Houston Dynamos in a three-game series. This success was short-lived. After the 1984 season, the club relocated to Tulsa, Oklahoma at the Tulsa Tornados, with Brian Harvey still serving as head coach. The USL folded in the spring of 1985 after just a handful of games. During its short existence, Oklahoma City's best-known players were goalkeeper Phil Parkes and Jeff Bourne, both veterans of the North American Soccer League and English First Division.

The new owners hired Eddie Firmani, an assistant with Palace, as the team's first head coach. Firmani brought over three Palace players, Stewart Jump, Mark Lindsay and Hammond for the 1975 season. Amazingly, the Rowdies won the league championship that season, with Hammond recording clean sheets in all three playoff games. He saved a penalty in the 1\u20130 quarter-final win over Toronto, and survived an onslaught of Portland shots in the Rowdies 2\u20130 Soccer Bowl victory. However, Hammond returned to Palace at the completion of the loan and was replaced by U.S. great Arnie Mausser. Although Mausser had been capped by the U.S. national team, and was selected as the top NASL goalkeeper for 1976, Firmani preferred Hammond and negotiated his purchase from Palace. Hammond made a total of 117 Football League appearances for Palace. At this time Palace was attempting to rebuild its team and used the funds from Hammond's sale to purchase striker Jeff Bourne from Derby County. Hammond played with the Rowdies through the 1977 season, but was traded to the Houston Hurricane after only eight games of the 1978 season. He then spent the 1979 and 1980 seasons in Houston, being named to the NASL second team All Star list in 1979. While in Houston, Hammond was introduced to professional indoor soccer when a new league, the Major Indoor Soccer League began operations in 1978\u20131979.
