His tertiary education was at the Northern Polytechnic Institute, Imperial College and the Royal College of Science, all in London.Anderson's most important research work was:\non the application of Raman spectroscopy to valence problems\naccounting for the composition ranges of non-stoichiometric compounds by combining the ideas of Schottky and Wagner with those of Fowler and Lacher\nhis use of field-emission and field ion microscopy to study surface reactions at the atomic level\nhis use of the electron microscope to solve problems of reaction mechanisms in solid state chemistry\non the conditions of equilibrium of 'non-stoichiometric' chemical compounds.In addition he carried out practical investigations on the composition of minerals mined in Australia, assisted on one project by Masters candidate Ken McTaggart who went on to be a senior research officer at CSIRO. He developed a love of the Australian bush and, with his family, a lifelong attachment to the country.  \nAnderson was co-author with Harry Julius Emel\u00e9us of the seminal textbook Modern Aspects of Inorganic Chemistry, first published in 1938, which went through numerous editions and translations for over thirty years.John Stuart Anderson died from cancer in Canberra on Christmas Day, 1990.\nIn memory of John, the University of Melbourne created the JS Anderson Prize awarded to a promising research student in the area of Chemistry.", "link_mentions": {}}}
