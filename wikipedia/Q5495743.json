It was first performed in 2003 at the Royal Court Theatre, Liverpool, returning the following year to the Liverpool Empire Theatre and Manchester Opera House.", "'With a title like this you could be forgiven for expecting a night of crude humour and sexist jibes. Instead we were treated to one of the best nights of home-grown comedy theatre to be enjoyed in a long time. Filled with laughter, pathos and consistently excellent performances Slappers and Slapheads was a real triumph. Penned by Liverpool duo Len Pentin and Fred Lawless, the action was set in The Palace, a city club with more than a passing resemblance to the infamous Grafton in West Derby. Pete Price made an early appearance as the club DJ adding his own brand of humour to get the audience in the mood and add an extra layer of realism as he introduced some disco classics. The cast of Gillian Hardie, Gina Lamb, Linzi Matthews, Liam Tobin, Michael Neary and Paul Duckworth were outstanding throughout, skilfully combining raucous slapstick with moving drama. The first half was packed to the rafters with visual and verbal gags but, after the interval, the mood turned, as drunken nights out in clubs often do. Despite the more serious topics of birth and death, Pentin and Lawless managed to keep the laughter coming and more than one audience member alternatively wiped away tears of mirth and sadness. It was a little tricky to work out when the ending was coming as a series of short vignettes finished the play with each character resolving their problems before heading into the night. But when the finale finally came, many of the audience rose to their feet to deliver a well-deserved standing ovation. They may have been slappers and slapheads but they proved to be the perfect companions for another great night at the Liverpool Comedy Festival.'", "'SLAPPERS and Slapheads began life at the Royal Court in 2003, and returns whipped into shape to launch the theatre's 2009 programme. And what a belter it is. Based on a night at the city's infamous Grafton nightclub \u2013 which becomes the Palace, with off-stage DJ Pete Price warming up the audiences himself until the 18th \u2013 there's more to it than you might imagine from the title. Everything is helped, of course, by some hugely enjoyable performances that really do justice to the notably tight writing of Fred Lawless and Len Pentin. And it's pleasing to say that it's the female roles that prove to be the most memorable. Gillian Hardie, as bolshie Elaine, leads the charge. In the wrong hands, the character could be some cloying tart-with-a-heart, but, as the saucy leader of the girls and no-nonsense judge of the boys, she shines. Helen Carter, who impressed last year with her supporting role in Once Upon a Time at the Adelphi, is understated this time as heavily pregnant Sue, desperately seeking the one night stand that resulted in her condition. And Gillian Hardie's straight-laced Elaine should not be able to get away with some of the filth she eventually finds herself turned on to, but produces a comic turn surely worthy of Royal Court legend. It's crude and lewd, but so very well written and enthusiastically performed that it works well. With some great lines, great actors and great tunes, this \u201cScouse play\u201d, perhaps more than any other definitely shows the potential to travel further afield.'", "*Fred Lawless at the Internet Movie Database"]}, {"page": "Wade Deacon High School", "response": ["* Fred Lawless, writer and producer for Brookside"]}, {"page": "Go Superlambananas!", "response": ["At the end of their ten-week run, the mini Superlambananas were auctioned off for the Lord Mayor's charities, with each having a guide price ranging from \u00a33,000 to \u00a38,000.
