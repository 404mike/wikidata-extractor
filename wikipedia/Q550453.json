He was appointed there to rebuild the rail system ruined by the Civil War. Being the Commissar of War and a revolutionary military leader, he saw a need to create a militarized \"production atmosphere\" by incorporating trade unions directly into the State apparatus. His unyielding stance was that in a worker's state, the workers should have nothing to fear from the State, and the State should fully control the unions. In the Ninth Party Congress, he argued for: \"....a regime in which every worker feels himself a soldier of labour, who cannot dispose of himself freely; if the order is given to transfer him, he must carry it out; if he does not carry it out, he will be a deserter who is punished. Who looks after this? The trade unions. It creates the new regime.

Shachtman and his followers thus argued for the formation of a Third Camp opposed equally to both the Soviet and capitalist blocs. By the mid-20th century, Shachtman and many of his associates such as Social Democrats, USA identified as social democrats rather than Trotskyists, while some ultimately abandoned socialism altogether and embraced neoconservatism. In the United Kingdom, Tony Cliff independently developed a critique of state capitalism that resembled Shachtman's in some respects, but it retained a commitment to revolutionary communism.Cliff, Tony (1948). \"The Theory of Bureaucratic Collectivism: A Critique\".

This criticism was expressed in documents written by Haston. Second, there was the question of economic perspectives and the growing tendency of the Labour government of Clement Attlee to take various industries into state ownership, as was also happening in eastern Europe. Again, it was Haston who,  in the pages of Socialist Appeal, opposed the idea that state ownership could be equated with any form of socialism. A complementary document on more general economic perspectives was written for the RCP by Tony Cliff, who later acknowledged that he had been greatly influenced by Haston in this period. Finally, there was the question of whether or not the RCP should enter the Labour Party as a body. Haston opposed this idea.
