Johnson took him the full 15 rounds and got the points verdict to take the title. In January 1953 he faced Joe Lucy in a final eliminator for the British title, but lost on points, a decision that reportedly led him consider writing to his MP to challenge.  In April 1953 he lost a close fight on points to French champion Jacques Prigent. He got a second chance to regain the title in September 1953 when he faced Lucy again, but once more lost on points. This was his final fight. In his 67-fight professional career he was never stopped by an opponent."]}, {"page": "Sammy McCarthy", "response": ["McCarthy was offered a rematch with Kelly, but after failing to make featherweight against Sneyers in November 1955 decided to move up to lightweight, winning his first fight at the weight against Austrian champion Willi Swoboda. Despite losing to Dave Charnley in April 1956, he faced Joe Lucy in June for the British title. The referee stopped the fight in the thirteenth round with Lucy well ahead on points. McCarthy beat Midlands Area champion Johnny Mann twice that year and also beat Johnny Miller and Jacques Dumesnil, but in January 1957 lost on points in what proved to be his final fight, against Guy Gracia."]}]}}
