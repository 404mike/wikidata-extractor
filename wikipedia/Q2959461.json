Jameson, reporting on the Congress, warned that the task that Whitwell envisaged \"could not be hopefully undertaken with resources less formidable than those of the International Union of Academies\". The First World War made cooperation on such a scale impossible, but it was indeed the IUA who revived Whitwell's suggestion in 1920, and by the time he died in May 1928 a coordinated effort from over ten countries was well under way. His death was noted with regret at the sixth 5-yearly International Congress of Historical Studies by Charles Johnson, who said that Whitwell \"not only actively promoted the whole [international] scheme but was a zealous member of the committee [on British medieval Latin after 1066] and a generous contributor of excerpts.\""]}]}}
