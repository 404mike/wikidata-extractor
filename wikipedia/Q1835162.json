A believer in extraterrestrial life himself, Wilfred was proud of his granddaughter's adventures and helped to keep them a secret from her overbearing mother.

In The Deadly Assassin at least one of the murders was carried out with a 'staser', possibly a weapon designed to both kill and prevent regeneration (stasers are also stated to have little effect on non-living tissue).

Due to the Master's Archangel Network, the Doctor's ability to sense another Time Lord had been blocked up to that point. During \"The End of Time\", the Master and the Doctor could sense each other's presence when in proximity, with both appearing to sniff each other out. However, this ability has a limited range as stated by the Doctor to Wilfred Mott. While he could sense that the Master was still on Earth, he could not tell where he was as the Master was too far away to track precisely. In \"Dark Water\", The Doctor failed to recognize that Missy was a regeneration of The Master, and may not have been able to tell that she was a Time Lord at all until she revealed her identity to him. In \"World Enough and Time\", the disguised Master figured out that Missy was his own future self, but this was due to deduction from her mannerisms rather than any sort of special ability. In turn, Missy did not realize that the disguised Master was another Time Lord, let alone her own past self until he revealed himself.", "It has been suggested in the series many times that regeneration is not guaranteed and can fail. After his cellular structure is decimated by the Metabelis crystals in Planet of the Spiders, the Third Doctor's regeneration requires \"a little push\" from fellow Time Lord K'anpo Rimpoche before it can proceed. As he succumbs to spectrox toxaemia in The Caves of Androzani, the Fifth Doctor says, \"I might regenerate... I don't know... It feels different this time.\" He then hallucinates, seeing his former companions encouraging him to survive, before the Master overwhelms them all, telling him he must die. The 1996 TV movie showed the Doctor's regeneration delayed for more than three hours, with the Eighth Doctor later remarking that the fact his Seventh incarnation was under anaesthesia at the time of his \"death\" could have \"destroyed the regenerative process\", and that he was \"dead too long this time\" prior to his regeneration. In many episodes, the Doctor doubts his own survival, though it is not always clear whether such statements refer to the death of only that particular incarnation. (The only time he makes a completely unambiguous distinction between these two scenarios \u2013 in \"The End of Time\" \u2013 he makes it clear that he regards regeneration as nearly as bad as death, because as he sees it, he dies and \"a new man\" walks away). In The Mind of Evil the Master points a conventional firearm at the Doctor and threatens to \"put a bullet through both [his] hearts,\" while in \"Forest of the Dead\", Professor Song warns that electrocution would stop both the Time Lord's hearts, killing him. In \"Turn Left\", in which the Tenth Doctor dies in a parallel world (he drowned without his future companion Donna Noble there to inspire him to leave), a UNIT member speculates that the Doctor's death must have been too quick to allow for regeneration.
