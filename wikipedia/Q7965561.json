As a Liberal and Nationalist member of the House of Representatives, he became a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Prime Minister Billy Hughes and was groomed as his successor. He served as Minister for Trade and Customs (1919\u20131921), Defence (1921\u20131923), and Health (1921\u20131923), but his prime ministerial aspirations were brought to an abrupt halt by his defeat at the 1922 federal election. Massy-Greene subsequently served two terms as a Senator for New South Wales (1923\u20131925, 1926\u20131938), but never regained his earlier influence in politics. In retirement he held numerous company directorships.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Joseph Lyons", "response": ["Lyons adhered to the principles of \"sound finance\", opposing inflation and government debt and stressing the importance of balanced budgets and orderly loan repayments. Although he had been state treasurer for seven years, he portrayed himself as a relative outsider to economic policy who would take the advice of experts. Lyons appointed himself Treasurer, the first non-Labor prime minister to do so and the first incoming prime minister to do so since Andrew Fisher in 1914. He had earlier offered the treasurership to Ben Chifley as an inducement to leave the Labor Party, but Chifley declined. He appointed experienced assistant treasurers, initially Stanley Bruce and later Walter Massy-Greene and Richard Casey, who eventually succeeded as Treasurer in 1935."]}, {"page": "Stanley Bruce", "response": ["Returning from Europe in October 1921, he was invited by Prime Minister Billy Hughes to join his government as Minister for Trade and Customs. Bruce was not interested he was the head of one of Australia's largest importing houses and thus had a serious conflict of interest with the portfolio, as well as being very busy running the affairs of that business. But he countered by stating that he might feel obliged to accept if the position of Treasurer was offered, knowing that it had already been promised to Walter Massy-Greene. To Bruce's surprise, Hughes agreed, although Massy-Greene was to remain the number two in the government and Minister for Defence. Bruce had only been in parliament for three years, yet his business background was highly desirable to Hughes, who was facing growing criticism from the pro-business figures of the party. These figures had become increasingly suspicious of Hughes and his interventionist approach to the economy. Influential party figures such as Senator George Pearce and the National Union had also identified Bruce as their preferred choice for the treasury.", "The Nationalists lost eleven seats and their majority in the House of Representatives in the election of 1922. Only three of these seats were picked up by the Labor Party though, and Labor still lacked the numbers to form government in their own right. Rather, a breakaway anti-Hughes Liberal Party took five government seats, while the Country Party increased their number to 14 and now held the balance of power. The only politically realistic option for the Nationalists to stay in office was to come to an agreement with the Country Party.  However, Country Party leader Earle Page refused to support a Nationalist government with Hughes as prime minister, and negotiations throughout January and February failed to break the impasse.  Rather than risk being defeated in the legislature, which might have resulted in the Governor-General asking Labor to form government, Hughes surprised his colleagues by announcing his intention to resign on 2 February. With deputy leader Walter Massy-Greene having lost his seat at the 1922 election, Hughes now sent for Bruce to take over as leader of the party. After some reluctance, Bruce finally agreed, although Hughes later regretted the decision and became one of the new prime minister's most outspoken detractors."]}, {"page": "Minister for Defence (Australia)", "response": ["| Walter Massy-Greene "]}, {"page": "Fourth Hughes Ministry", "response": ["Walter Massy-Greene, who died in 1952, was the last surviving member of the Fourth Hughes Ministry.", "| Hon Walter Massy-Greene "]}, {"page": "Fifth Hughes Ministry", "response": ["| Hon Walter Massy-Greene "]}, {"page": "First Lyons Ministry", "response": ["| Hon (Sir) Walter Massy-Greene () "]}, {"page": "Institute of Public Affairs", "response": ["|Sir Walter Massy-Greene "]}, {"page": "Division of Richmond", "response": ["| rowspan=2 | Walter Massy-Greene"]}, {"page": "Members of the Australian House of Representatives, 1910\u20131913", "response": ["| Walter Massy-Greene"]}, {"page": "Members of the Australian House of Representatives, 1913\u20131914", "response": ["| Walter Massy-Greene"]}, {"page": "Robert Groves Sandeman", "response": ["Sandeman died at Bela, the capital of Las Bela state, on 29 January 1892.
