Replying to Sussex's first innings of 375, Hampshire were bowled out for just 76 (Kendall 2) and asked to follow on. However, second time around Hampshire piled on the runs, eventually declaring at 570/6; Kendall's 201 had taken slightly more than eight hours. (The match itself finished drawn.)\nKendall was capped by Hampshire in 1999, and named Hampshire Cricket Society's Player of the Year in 2000.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "David Fulton (English cricketer)", "response": ["Once established in the first-team, Fulton performed consistently in the seasons between 1995 and 1998, where he averaged over 30 every year. 1996 also saw Fulton take his only first-class wicket; that of Oxford University batsman William Kendall, caught and bowled. Fulton's best run-scoring return was 954 runs in 1998, a season in which he hit his first double century. Playing against Yorkshire at Mote Park, Maidstone, Fulton posted 207 not out over the course of ten-and-a-half hours to save Kent from a heavy defeat. However, his innings was criticised by some, notably Clive Ellis of The Daily Telegraph, of being so slow that it prevented Kent from reaching a position to set a target."]}, {"page": "Matthew Church", "response": ["The start of the 1995 season saw Church play only occasionally for the first team, and he never made the impression required to become a regular in the side, with a first-class batting average in the mid-teens and a top score of only 35 in a total of 14 innings in both forms of the game. 1996 was a better year on the face of it, with 280 first-class runs at 25.75, but more than half of those came from just one of his 11 innings, when he hit 152 (almost treble the next highest score of his career) against Oxford University in June. That game also saw Church take his first wicket, that of William Kendall, and go on to record what was to remain his best innings bowling return of 4-50."]}, {"page": "William Kendall", "response": ["William Kendall may refer to:", "*William Kendall (actor) (1903\u20131984), British actor, appeared in The Two Faces of Dr. Jekyll", "*William Kendall (cricketer) (born 1973), English cricketer", "*William Kendall (swimmer) (1916\u20132004), Australian swimmer", "*William Kendall (burgess 1657) (1621\u20131686), Virginia colonial politician, Speaker of the Virginia House of Burgesses", "*William Kendall (burgess 1688) (1659\u20131696), his son, Virginia colonial politician, Member of the Virginia House of Burgesses", "*William Kendall, character in The $5,000,000 Counterfeiting Plot"]}, {"page": "Moss Lane, Alderley Edge", "response": ["The ground was established in 1870, with Cheshire first playing there in the 1973 Minor Counties Championship against the Lancashire Second XI. Cheshire played two further Minor Counties Championship matches there, in 1975 and 1977, as well as playing there once in the 1980s when they played Durham in the same competition. Minor counties cricket did not return to the ground until 1998, when Cheshire played Shropshire in the Minor Counties Championship. Since then, Cheshire have played one match per\u2013year at the ground. The ground held its first List A match in 2004, when Cheshire played first-class opponents Hampshire in the second round of the Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy, with Hampshire winning due to half centuries by William Kendall and Dimitri Mascarenhas, as well as three wickets from Lawrence Prittipaul. The ground held a second List A match in 2008 when Lancashire played the touring Bangladesh A. Despite a fifty from Tamim Iqbal, the tourists lost the match by six wickets, with Francois du Plessis scoring 93 not out in the chase."]}]}}
