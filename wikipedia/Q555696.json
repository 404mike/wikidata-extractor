According to Ian Kershaw, in order to achieve this, the Nazis believed they would have to replace class, religious and regional allegiances by a \"massively enhanced national self-awareness to mobilize the German people psychologically for the coming struggle and to boost their morale during the inevitable war\". According to Anton Gill, the Nazis disliked universities, intellectuals and the Catholic and Protestant churches, their long term plan being to \"de-Christianise Germany after the final victory\". The Nazis co-opted the term Gleichschaltung (coordination) to mean conformity and subservience to the Nazi Party line: \"there was to be no law but Hitler, and ultimately no god but Hitler\".  Other authors, such as Richard Steigmann-Gall, argue that there were anti-Christian individuals in the Nazi Party but that they did not represent the movement's position.", "The Concordat was signed at the Vatican on 20 July 1933, by Germany's Deputy Reich Chancellor Franz von Papen, and Cardinal Secretary of State Eugenio Pacelli (later Pope Pius XII). In his 1937 anti-Nazi encyclical, Pope Pius XI said that the Holy See had signed the Concordat \"In spite of many serious misgivings\" and in the hope it might \"safeguard the liberty of the church in her mission of salvation in Germany\". The treaty consisted of 34 articles and a supplementary protocol. Article 1 guaranteed \"freedom of profession and public practice of the Catholic religion\" and acknowledged the right of the church to regulate its own affairs. Within three months of the signing of the document, Cardinal Adolf Bertram, head of the German Catholic Bishops Conference, was writing in a pastoral letter of \"grievous and gnawing anxiety\" with regard to the government's actions towards Catholic organizations, charitable institutions, youth groups, press, Catholic Action and the mistreatment of Catholics for their political beliefs. According to Paul O'Shea, Hitler had a \"blatant disregard\" for the Concordat, and its signing was to him merely a first step in the \"gradual suppression of the Catholic Church in Germany\".

Hitler moved quickly to eliminate political Catholicism, and the Nazis arrested thousands of Centre Party members. The Bavarian People's Party government was overthrown by a Nazi coup on 9 March 1933,Shirer, 1990, p. 201 and the dissolution of the Centre Party in early July left Germany without a Catholic party for the first time; the Reichskonkordat prohibited clergy from participating in politics. Anton Gill wrote that \"with his usual irresistible, bullying technique\", Hitler proceeded to \"take a mile where he had been given an inch\" and closed all Catholic institutions whose functions were not strictly religious:Gill, 1994, p. 57", "Arrests of priests and seizure of Jesuit properties by the Gestapo in his home city of Munster convinced Galen that the caution advised by his superior was pointless. He spoke on 6, 13 and 20 July 1941 against the seizure of properties and expulsions of nuns, monks and religious, and criticized the euthanasia programme. The police raided his sister's convent, and detained her in the cellar; she escaped, and Galen made his boldest challenge to the government in a 3 August sermon. He formally accused those responsible for the murders in a letter to the public prosecutor. The policy opened the way to the murder of all \"unproductive people\", including invalid war veterans; \"Who can trust his doctor anymore?\".Evans, 2008, pp. 97\u201398 Galen said that it was a Christian duty to oppose the taking of human life, even if it risked one's own. He addressed a moral danger to Germany from the government's violations of human rights. \"The sensation created by the sermons was enormous\", and they were a \"vigorous denunciation of Nazi inhumanity and barbarism\". Gill wrote: \"Galen used his condemnation of this appalling policy to draw wider conclusions about the nature of the Nazi state\". The sermons were distributed illegally,Anton Gill; An Honourable Defeat; A History of the German Resistance to Hitler; Heinemann; London; 1994; p. 60 and Galen had them read in churches.

By early 1937, the church hierarchy in Germany, which had initially attempted to co-operate with the new government, had become highly disillusioned. In March, Pope Pius XI issued the Mit brennender Sorge encyclical \u2013 accusing the Nazi Government of violations of the 1933 Concordat, and further that it was sowing the \"tares of suspicion, discord, hatred, calumny, of secret and open fundamental hostility to Christ and His Church\". The Pope noted on the horizon the \"threatening storm clouds\" of religious wars of extermination over Germany. He asserted the inviolability of human rights and expressed deep concern at the Nazi regime's flouting of the 1933 Concordat, its treatment of Catholics and abuse of Christian values.Anton Gill; An Honourable Defeat; A History of the German Resistance to Hitler; Heinemann; London; 1994; p.58"]}, {"page": "The Society for Curious Thought", "response": ["This question was put to writers, ecologists, academics, humanitarians, film makers, artists and others in order to gather together ideas/ ideals/ mechanisms to improve civic institutions/ civil society, education and to advance knowledge of rights and responsibilities, to enable people in all societies to change their own lives and communities for the better.
