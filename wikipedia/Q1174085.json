Mowat, ed. The New Cambridge Modern History: Vol. XII: The Shifting Balance of World Forces 1898\u20131945 (2nd ed. 1968) online pp. 171\u2013208. Over 65 million European soldiers were mobilised from 1914 to 1918; 20\u00a0million soldiers and civilians died, and 21\u00a0million were seriously wounded.Christopher Clark, The Sleepwalkers: How Europe Went to War in 1914 (2013) p xxiii On one side were Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria (the Central Powers/Triple Alliance), while on the other side stood Serbia and the Triple Entente \u2013 the coalition of France, Britain and Russia, which were joined by Italy in 1915, Romania in 1916 and by the United States in 1917. The Western Front involved especially brutal combat without any territorial gains by either side. Single battles like Verdun and the Somme killed hundreds of thousands of men while leaving the stalemate unchanged. Heavy artillery and machine guns caused most of the casualties, supplemented by poison gas. Czarist Russia collapsed in the February Revolution of 1917 and Germany claimed victory on the Eastern Front. After eight months of liberal rule, the October Revolution brought Vladimir Lenin and the Bolsheviks to power, leading to the creation of the Soviet Union in place of the disintegrated Russian Empire. With American entry into the war in 1917 on the Allied side, and the failure of Germany's spring 1918 offensive, Germany had run out of manpower, while an average of 10,000 American troops were arriving in France every day in the summer of 1918. Germany's allies, Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire, surrendered and dissolved, followed by Germany on 11 November 1918.Overviews include David Stevenson,  Cataclysm: The First World War as Political Tragedy (2005) and Ian F.

It set the stage for the First Battle of the Masurian Lakes a week later, when the reinforced German Eighth Army confronted the Russian First Army. Rennenkampf retreated hastily back over the pre-war border before they could be encircled. The battle was humiliating to Russia as it meant their army was weak."]}, {"page": "Causes of World War I", "response": ["As David Stevenson put it, \"A self-reinforcing cycle of heightened military preparedness... was an essential element in the conjuncture that led to disaster.... The armaments race... was a necessary precondition for the outbreak of hostilities.\" David Herrmann goes further by arguing that the fear that \"windows of opportunity for victorious wars\" were closing, \"the arms race did precipitate the First World War.\" If Franz Ferdinand had been assassinated in 1904 or even in 1911, Herrmann speculates, there might have been no war. It was \"the armaments race and the speculation about imminent or preventive wars\" that made his death in 1914 the trigger for war."]}, {"page": "The Economic Consequences of the Peace", "response": ["Some scholars have portrayed the Treaty as less harsh than it was seen to be in the immediate aftermath of the Paris Peace Conference. Gideon Rose, for instance, sees it as \"more balanced\" than it seemed at the time, and \"a mixture of discordant elements that was neither Carthaginian nor Metternichian\", while Max Hastings calls the peace treaty \"clumsy\" but writes that \"[I]f the Germans had instead been dictating the terms as victors, European freedom, justice and democracy would have paid a dreadful forfeit.\". David Stevenson argues that neither the Armistice nor the Peace Treaty made World War II inevitable \u2013 as claimed by many scholars \u2013 and that \"the peacemakers have had an undeservedly bad press. ... [T]hey were feeling their way in unprecedented circumstances, but the settlement that was constructed was more flexible than its critics acknowledged, and could either have accommodated a lasting reconciliation with the new Republican regime in Germany or ensured that it remained militarily harmless. The real tragedy of the inter-war years is that it did neither... The Treaty could have stopped another bloodbath if it had been upheld.\"  This, of course, is antithetical to the arguments of Keynes, or at least his followers, who draw a direct line between the economic conditions created by the Peace Treaty and the rise of belligerent regimes in Europe."]}, {"page": "David Stevenson", "response": ["David Stevenson may refer to:", "*David Stevenson (admiral) (1918\u20131998), Australian admiral; Chief of Staff, 1973\u20131976", "*David Stevenson (engineer) (1815\u20131886), Scottish lighthouse designer and engineer", "*David Stevenson (footballer, born 1958), Scottish footballer (Dumbarton FC)", "*David Stevenson (Hibernian footballer) (fl. 1913\u20131928), Scottish footballer", "*David Stevenson (historian) (born 1954), professor in international history at the London School of Economics", "*David Stevenson (Scottish historian), emeritus professor of Scottish history at the University of St Andrews", "*David Stevenson (cyclist) (1882\u2013?), British Olympic road racing cyclist", "*David Stevenson (cricketer) (1890\u20131974), Scottish cricketer"]}, {"page": "David Stevenson (WW1 Historian)", "response": ["#REDIRECT David Stevenson (historian) "]}, {"page": "David Stevenson (WWI Historian)", "response": ["#REDIRECT David Stevenson (historian) "]}, {"page": "David Stevenson (World War One Historian)", "response": ["#REDIRECT David Stevenson (historian)"]}, {"page": "David Stevenson (First World War Historian)", "response": ["#REDIRECT David Stevenson (historian)"]}, {"page": "David Stevenson (Great War Historian)", "response": ["#REDIRECT David Stevenson (historian)"]}, {"page": "David Stevenson (WW1 historian)", "response": ["#REDIRECT David Stevenson (historian)"]}, {"page": "David Stevenson (WWI historian)", "response": ["#REDIRECT David Stevenson (historian)"]}, {"page": "The Oxford History of Modern Europe", "response": ["Writing in 2005, David Stevenson observed that the series \"belongs to a more leisured era\" and noted that no volumes have ever published which deal with Austria, Italy and Soviet Russia.
