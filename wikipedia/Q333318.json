The incident gained considerable publicity, with party chairman Ian McCartney initially supporting the right to remove hecklers by force.

In 1992, he voted for Bryan Gould, seen as the leftwing candidate in the leadership election which followed the resignation of Neil Kinnock.  The victorious candidate, John Smith, dispensed with Marshall's services, and Marshall's support for Margaret Beckett in the following leadership election did not endear him to Tony Blair.  Increasingly out of step with the mainstream of the Labour Party, he concentrated on constituency matters, and rebelled against Blair's government on many occasions, chiefly on matters relating to immigration and education.  His constituency work, especially on immigration and benefit problems, won him strong personal support among local voters.
