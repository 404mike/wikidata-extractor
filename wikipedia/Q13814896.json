A play inspired by Querido's characterization of Jordaners, as \"hard workers, hard drinkers, working under terrible conditions and having their emotions only just below the surface\", was a big hit: Herman Boubers' Mooie Neel (1916) was the story of a factory girl who is seduced by her boss and left with the consequences. Boubers wrote a second play, this time with songs written in collaboration with Louis Davids, one of the greatest artists in cabaret in the Netherlands, whom Boubers had met by chance in a cafe on the Rembrandtplein, one of the city's main entertainment areas. Davids composed a number of Jordaan-themed songs (though he was a Rotterdammer) with his then-girlfriend, the English singer and actress Margie Morris, for the enormously popular Bleeke Bet (1917) which had the Jordaan as background and topic. One of the play's songs, \"O oude mooie toren\", later specified as \"O mooie Westertoren\", became the area's first \"anthem\"."]}, {"page": "Louis Davids", "response": ["Despite Davids being from Rotterdam, he was a popular performer of the Amsterdam Jordan repertoire. David was the founder of the career While on tour Davids made the acquaintance of Margie Morris who had moved to the Netherlands in 1913. Up until 1922 Louis and Morris formed the duo \"He, She and the piano\", with Morris as the composer. The comedic repertoire soon became well-known across the Netherlands in what is now known as the genre Levenslied. A famous song from this period is De Jantjes which was also released as a silent film in 1922, and as a full motion picture in 1934. Between 1922 and 1926 Davids was the director of the Casino Theater in Rotterdam, but the job of a director does not hold his attention for long.of some big names like Wim Kan and Corry Vonk, Wim Sonneveld and Cabaret Ping Pong."]}, {"page": "List of people from the City of Westminster", "response": ["* Margie Morris"]}]}}
