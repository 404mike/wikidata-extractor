When it's time to be funny, he skitters over the top. When he's sad or touched, he makes a mechanical, catching noise in his throat.\" John Simon called Branagh's performance \"brawny\" and \"not easy to like\" and said that Branagh's direction used \"explicitness where Shakespeare ... settled for subtlety or mere suggestion\".John Simon On Film: Criticism, 1982\u20132001 \u2013 John Ivan Simon \u2013 Google Books  Leonard Maltin, who gave the film a positive three stars in his Movie and Video Guide (and gave the Olivier version of Hamlet four stars), praised the cinematography by Alex Thomson, but stated that \"Branagh essentially gives a stage performance that is nearly as over-the-top as some of his directorial touches.\"Leonard Maltin's 2009 Movie Guide \u2013 Leonard Maltin \u2013 Google Books ", "| Alex Thomson", "| Alex Thomson", "| Alex Thomson"]}, {"page": "National Science and Media Museum", "response": ["Guests at Bradford International Film Festival included Riz Ahmed, Jenny Agutter, Michael Apted, David Arnold, Thomas Arslan, Ken Annakin, Olivier Assayas, Richard Attenborough, Simon Beaufoy, Alan Bennett, James Benning, Claire Bloom, Kenneth Branagh, Adam Buxton, Jack Cardiff, Ian Carmichael, Gurinder Chadha, Tom Courtenay, Mark Cousins, Alex Cox, Brian Cox, Benedict Cumberbatch, Terence Davies, Michael Deeley, Denis Dercourt, The Dodge Brothers, James Ellis, Mike Figgis, Freddie Francis, Terry Gilliam, Stephen Graham, Richard Griffiths, Ronald Harwood, Mike Hodges, Joanna Hogg, John Hurt, Derek Jacobi, Gualtiero Jacopetti, Terry Jones, Patrick Keiller, Mark Kermode, Mike Leigh, Euan Lloyd, Ken Loach, Malcolm McDowell, Virginia McKenna, Fernando Meirelles, Kay Mellor, Metamono, Chris Morris, Barry Norman, Michael Palin, Pawel Pawlikowski, Christian Petzold, Sally Potter, Godfrey Reggio, Menelik Shabazz, John Shuttleworth, Jean Simmons, Timothy Spall, Imelda Staunton, Eric Sykes, Julien Temple, Alex Thomson, Richard Todd, Danny Trejo, Roy Ward Baker, Peter Whitehead, Michael G.
