The programme's founders were Isa Benzie and Janet Quigley. Benzie gave the programme its name, and served as its first de facto editor.Paul Donovan, \u2018Benzie, Isa Donald (1902\u20131988)\u2019, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 4 March 2017 It was initially broadcast as two 20-minute editions slotted in around the existing news bulletins and religious and musical items. It became part of the BBC's Current Affairs department in 1963, and started to become more news-orientated. The two editions also became longer, and by the end of the 1960s it had become a single programme two hours in length that enveloped the news bulletins and the religious talk that had become Thought for the Day in 1970.Lizzie Clifford \"Thought for the Day\u2019: Beyond the god-of-the-slots\", Ekklesia [c.2009] In May 1977, Radio 4 controller Ian McIntyre cut it to two 25-minute parts, filling the gap with Up to the Hour. The new format was unpopular with BBC staff, including Peter Donaldson who on at least one occasion openly ridiculed the programme on air. It also provoked comments in the diary columns of the daily newspapers. From July 1978, Today returned to its previous length and Up to the Hour was dropped."]}, {"page": "Hester Thrale", "response": ["After Johnson's death, she published Anecdotes of the Late Samuel Johnson (1786) and their letters to each other (1788).Michael J.

Frances Burney, who considered both Johnson and Thrale to be among her dearest friends, read the unpublished manuscript with much interest, but disapproved of the decision to publish, noting, \"She has given all \u2013 every word \u2013 and thinks that, perhaps, a justice to Dr Johnson, which, in fact, is the greatest injury to his memory.\" Together with Thrale's diaries, which were known as Thraliana and not published until 1942, these sources help to fill out the biased picture of Johnson often presented in James Boswell's Life of Samuel Johnson. Johnson often stayed with the Thrale household and had his own room above the library at Streatham, in which he worked. The friendship between Johnson and Thrale was emotionally intimate, and after John Thrale died in 1781 \"Johnson's circle took it for granted that he would marry Hester.\" Based upon two letters Johnson wrote to Thrale in French and a passage in Thrale's Anecdotes of the Late Samuel Johnson, Thrale's biographer Ian McIntyre and Johnson's biographers Peter Martin and Jeffrey Meyers have suggested that Thrale and Johnson had a sadomasochistic relationship in which Thrale whipped Johnson."]}, {"page": "BBC Radio 3", "response": ["In 1978, Ian McIntyre took over as controller of Radio 3 but quickly faced uncomfortable relationships between departments. At approximately the same time Aubrey Singer became managing director of Radio and began to make programming on the station more populist in a drive to retain listeners in face of possible competition from competitors using a \"streamed format\". An example of this is the replacement of Homeward Bound in 1980 with an extended, presenter-driven programme called Mainly for Pleasure. The same year an internal paper recommended the disbandment of several of the BBC's orchestras and of the Music Division, resulting in low morale and industrial action by musicians that delayed the start of the Proms.
