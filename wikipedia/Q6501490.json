He began his career with Bradford Park Avenue in 1920. After 33 League appearances for the club, he had a spell with Gainsborough Trinity. In 1924 he joined Barnsley, for whom he made 28 appearances in the League. A year later he signed for Blackpool, making 46 League appearances in his two years with the Bloomfield Road club. He finished his career with Manchester City, where he made 84 League appearances in his four years at Maine Road.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Don Revie", "response": ["McDowall fined Revie \u00a327 for missing two weeks of training for a family holiday in Blackpool, which infuriated him as he had already won permission from trainer Laurie Barnett and had promised to train whilst on holiday. McDowall dropped Revie for much of the 1955\u201356 season, preferring instead to play Bobby Johnstone. Revie played only one FA Cup match that season before being named in the team for the 1956 FA Cup Final against Birmingham City, with Johnstone being moved to the wings. He provided the assist for Joe Hayes's opening goal, and instructed Ken Barnes to deviate from the manager's instructions at half-time, with the result being a more dominant second half display and a 3\u20131 victory; Revie was named as Man of the Match. However the rift with his manager was not forgotten, and he was moved to right-half in the 1956\u201357 campaign, leaving him to seek a move away from Maine Road."]}, {"page": "1934 FA Cup Final", "response": ["| ||2 || Laurie Barnett"]}, {"page": "1927\u201328 Blackpool F.C. season", "response": ["*Laurie Barnett"]}, {"page": "List of Manchester City F.C. players (25\u201399 appearances)", "response": ["Several listed players won medals while at the club.
