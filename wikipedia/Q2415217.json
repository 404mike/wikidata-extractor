In 1871, Scottish novelist and poet Margaret Oliphant described it as \"the culmination of Dickens's early comic fiction\";Margaret Oliphant, Blackwood's Magazine, number 109, 1871. However, in the late nineteenth-century Dickens's critical reputation suffered a decline, though he continued to have many readers. This began when Henry James in 1865 \"relegated Dickens to the second division of literature on the grounds that he could not 'see beneath the surface of things'\". Then in 1872, two years after Dickens's death, George Henry Lewes wondered how to \"reconcile [Dickens's] immense popularity with the 'critical contempt' which he attracted\". However, Dickens was defended by the novelist George Gissing in 1898 in Charles Dickens: A Critical Study. G. K. Chesterton published an important defence of Dickens in his book Charles Dickens in 1906, where he describes him as this \u201cmost English of our great writers\u201d. Dickens's  literary reputation grew in the 1940s and 1950s because of essays by George Orwell and Edmund Wilson (both published in 1940), and Humphrey House's The Dickens World (1941). However, in 1948, F. R. Leavis in The Great Tradition, contentiously, excluded  Dickens from his canon, characterising him as a \"popular entertainer\" without \"mature standards and interests\"."]}, {"page": "A Christmas Carol", "response": ["The poet Thomas Hood, in his own journal, wrote that \"If Christmas, with its ancient and hospitable customs, its social and charitable observances, were ever in danger of decay, this is the book that would give them a new lease.\" The reviewer for Tait's Edinburgh Magazine\u2014Theodore Martin, who was usually critical of Dickens's work\u2014spoke well of A Christmas Carol, noting it was \"a noble book, finely felt and calculated to work much social good\". After Dickens's death, Margaret Oliphant deplored the turkey and plum pudding aspects of the book but admitted that in the days of its first publication it was regarded as \"a new gospel\", and noted that the book was unique in that it made people behave better. The religious press generally ignored the tale but, in January 1884, Christian Remembrancer thought the tale's old and hackneyed subject was treated in an original way and praised the author's sense of humour and pathos. The writer and social thinker John Ruskin told a friend that he thought Dickens had taken the religion from Christmas, and had imagined it as \"mistletoe and pudding \u2013 neither resurrection from the dead, nor rising of new stars, nor teaching of wise men, nor shepherds\"."]}, {"page": "Great Expectations", "response": ["Overall, Great Expectations received near universal acclaim. Not all reviews were favourable, however; Margaret Oliphant's review, published May 1862 in Blackwood's Magazine, vilified the novel. Critics in the 19th and 20th centuries hailed it as one of Dickens's greatest successes although often for conflicting reasons: GK Chesterton admired the novel's optimism; Edmund Wilson its pessimism; Humphry House in 1941 emphasized its social context. In 1974, Jerome H. Buckley saw it as a bildungsroman, writing a chapter on Dickens and two of his major protagonists (David Copperfield and Pip) in his 1974 book on the Bildungsroman in Victorian writing. John Hillis Miller wrote in 1958 that Pip is the archetype of all Dickensian heroes. In 1970, Q. D. Leavis suggested \"How We Must Read Great Expectations.\" In 1984, Peter Brooks, in the wake of Jacques Derrida, offered a deconstructionist reading. The most profound analyst, according to Paul Schlicke, is probably Julian Moynahan, who, in a 1964 essay surveying the hero's guilt, made Orlick \"Pip's double, alter ego and dark mirror image.\" Schlicke also names Anny Sadrin's extensive 1988 study as the \"most distinguished.\""]}, {"page": "1897 in literature", "response": ["*June 25 \u2013 Margaret Oliphant, Scottish novelist (born 1828)"]}, {"page": "James Anthony Froude", "response": ["Amongst the strongest critics of Froude's biographical work was novelist Margaret Oliphant, who wrote in the Contemporary Review of 1883 that biography ought to be the \"art of moral portrait painting\" and described the publication of Jane Carlyle's papers as the \"betrayal and exposure of the secret of a woman\u2019s weakness.\" (quoted in ) After Froude finished his work, ownership of the manuscript material was passed to Mrs. Alexander Carlyle, who quickly authorised alternative biographical volumes by Charles Eliot Norton that excised the offensive material. The controversy persisted for so long that in 1903, nearly ten years after Froude's death, his daughters decided to publish My Relations with Carlyle, which their father had written in 1887; in this pamphlet Froude attempted to justify his decisions as biographer, yet went further than his official biography had by speculating that Carlyle's marriage was unconsummated due to impotence."]}, {"page": "The Tenant of Wildfell Hall", "response": ["Elizabeth Gaskell repeated Charlotte's words about Anne in The Life of Charlotte Bront\u00eb, claiming that the subject of The Tenant \"was painfully discordant to one who would fain have sheltered herself from all but peaceful and religious ideas.\" In his essay on Emily Bront\u00eb, Algernon Charles Swinburne briefly mentioned The Tenant in the context of Branwell's decline as a novel \"which deserves perhaps a little more notice and recognition than it has ever received\" and added that \"as a study of utterly flaccid and invertebrate immorality it bears signs of more faithful transcription from life than anything in Jane Eyre or Wuthering Heights.\"  Margaret Oliphant believed that Anne \"would have no right to be considered at all as a writer but for her association with [her sisters'] imperative spirits.\" Mary Ward, a novelist, who was widely known for her anti-feminist views, in her introduction to 1900 edition of The Tenant, accused Anne of \"the narrowness of view\" and absence of \"some subtle, innate correspondence between eye and brain, between brain and hand, [which] was present in Emily and Charlotte.\" She concluded that \"it is not as the writer of Wildfell Hall, but as the sister of Charlotte and Emily Bront\u00eb, that Anne Bront\u00eb escapes oblivion.\" May Sinclair, while famously saying that \"when [Anne] slammed the door of Mrs Huntingdon's bedroom she slammed it in the face of society and all existing moralities and conventions,\" considered that she \"had no genius.\" Despite that, her opinion about The Tenant was unexpectedly high: \"There are scenes, there are situations, in Anne's amazing novel, which for sheer audacity stand alone in mid-Victorian literature, and which would hold their own in the literature of revolt that followed... Her diagnosis of certain states, her realization of certain motives, suggests Balzac rather than any of the Bront\u00ebs.\" In her introduction to the 1914 edition of the novel Sinclair was also ambivalent about Anne and her novel \u2014 while acclaiming it as \"the first presentment of that Feminist novel\", she stated that \"it bores to tears.\" Her opinion of Helen was also mixed: \"If Agnes Grey is a little prig, Helen Huntingdon is a prig enormous... She is Anne Bronte's idea of noble womanhood, the first of the modern, large-souled, intellectual heroines.\" The only thing Sinclair wholly approved of was the author's treatment of marital laws of the time: \"Anne Bront\u00eb attacks her problem with a freedom and audacity before which her sisters\u2019 boldest enterprises seem cowardly and restrained...

In early January 1870 she delivered a lecture on Percy Bysshe Shelley at the Church of Progress in London, stressing the poet's political radicalism. In July of that year she published a review-essay on William Michael Rossetti's edition of The Poetical Works of Percy Bysshe Shelley in the Westminster Review that earned the praise of Algernon Charles Swinburne and gained her entry into a formerly all-male group of \"Shelleyites\" that included Swinburne, Rossetti, and Richard Garnett. (Garnett would remain Blind's friend and literary adviser throughout her lifetime.) A year after this essay appeared, Blind began publishing poetry and nonfiction in Dark Blue, a new Oxford-based journal that during its short run published prose and art by many of Britain's leading Pre-Raphaelites and aesthetes. Her wide-ranging publications in this journal are those of a daring feminist aesthete: she wrote sexually subversive poems about haunted lovers, an erudite essay on Icelandic poetry, and a short story exploring the corrosive effects of class divisions on human relations. In the fall of 1872, as her association with Dark Blue was ending, she began reviewing contemporary poetry and fiction for the Athenaeum, where over the next 15 years she passed judgement on a wide range of contemporary writers, ranging from William Morris to Margaret Oliphant. At the end of 1871 she published Selections from the Poems of Percy Bysshe Shelley for the Tauchnitz Collection of British Authors, containing an introductory \"Memoir\" of Shelley's life. In the following year, she brought out her translation of David Strauss's The Old Faith and the New: A Confession, which established her reputation as a daring freethinker, following in the footsteps of George Eliot, who had translated The Life of Jesus in 1853. The generic range of these early works (poetry, fiction, criticism, biography, translation), as well as their subject matter and themes (female autonomy and agency, anti-theism, aestheticism, the relationship of literary and political radicalism), indicates the aesthetic principles and themes that would characterize the remainder of Blind's career, while emphasizing the cosmopolitan nature of her sensibility and outlook."]}, {"page": "Thomas Lake Harris", "response": ["The information about Harris in Memoir of the Life of Laurence Oliphant and of Alice Oliphant, his Wife (1891), by Margaret Oliphant, his cousin, has not been shaken in any important particular, and Oliphant's own portrait of Harris in Masollam is apparently unexaggerated.
