He was one of three members of the 1934\u201335 Hitchin side who went on to play in the Football League: the others were Cyril Walker and future England international Reg Smith. Odell never appeared in Tottenham's first team. He spent one season with their nursery club, Northfleet, and one with Tottenham's reserve team before being released on a free transfer. He then signed for Wrexham of the Third Division North, for whom he was a regular at left half in his first season, during which he made 40 league appearances. He appeared less frequently in the 1938\u201339 campaign, and was used at inside left and outside left as well as at left half. An ankle injury kept him out for several weeks towards the end of the season, during which he made 21 league appearances. He was not retained, and moved on to another Northern Section club, Darlington."]}, {"page": "Cyril Walker", "response": ["Cyril Walker may refer to:", "*Cyril Walker (footballer) (1914\u20132002), English footballer", "*Cyril Walker (golfer) (1892\u20131946), English golfer", "*Cyril Walker (paleontologist) (1939\u20132006), British paleontologist"]}]}}
