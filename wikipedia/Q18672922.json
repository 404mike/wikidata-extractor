His parents were Samuel Freemoult Pringuer (1828\u20131907), a cabinet maker of Canterbury, Kent; and Eliza Hayward (1825\u20131902) of Blean, Kent.Birth Certificate: Henry Thomas Pringuer, Q1 1852, Canterbury, vol. 2a, p.504 It is likely that the Pringuer family were Walloon refugees, many of whom settled in the Canterbury area. A good portion of the Pringuer family also worshipped in Bethnal Green and Spitalfields, both often considered hubs of Walloon settlements. In 1861, at the age of just nine and a half, Pringuer was appointed organist of a chapel in Canterbury and in 1864, moved to All Saints' Church. Shortly after, he attained the coveted post of organist at St. Dunstan's. His tutors in Canterbury included Thomas Goulden FCO and Dr. William Henry Longhurst DMus. Goulden came from a large family of musicians who owned the Goulden's shop in Canterbury, which at one time sold pianofortes, American organs and gramophones.Surrey Record & Illustrated Journal, no. 22, vol. 2, October 1879 Dr. Longhurst was organist of Canterbury Cathedral and was connected with the music there for 71 years.Memorial plaque to Dr. Longhurst in Canterbury Cathedral Pringuer was a chorister at the Cathedral before the age of 14, and in both 1911 and 1914, he attended the Cathedral Choristers' Association Reunion.Canterbury Cathedral Archives"]}, {"page": "Longhurst", "response": ["*William Henry Longhurst (1819\u20131904), English organist at Canterbury Cathedral"]}, {"page": "Edmund Hart Turpin", "response": ["William Henry Longhurst, Ebenezer Prout, James Higgs as well as the first honorary Secretary Richard Limpus.

Turpin's position as Hon Sec. of the College of Organists coupled with his reputation, not only as a fine organ player but as a newspaper writer as well, naturally won for him a great deal of influence in the musical world. For a long time this manifested itself chiefly in the immense number of recitals he was asked to given in connection with the inauguration of new organs in churches, chapels, town halls, and other public buildings.Charles William Pearce, A Biographical Sketch of Edmund Hart Turpin, 1911"]}, {"page": "List of musicians at English cathedrals", "response": ["* 1873 William Henry Longhurst", "*1836 William Henry Longhurst"]}]}}
