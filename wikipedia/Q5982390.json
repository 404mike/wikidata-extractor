A strong, physical, centre forward, Mellor was top scorer in Liverpool's run to the FA Youth Cup semi-final during the 2000\u201301 season scoring eight goals in four games. He was also the top scorer for the under-19 team and Joe Corrigan's reserves during the 2001\u201302 season and in total scored 46 goals (56 including friendlies). Mellor progressed through the ranks at Liverpool and in the 2002\u201303 season he scored 20 goals for the reserve team. He made his first team debut in the same season and played a total of six games and scored in a League Cup semi-final match against Sheffield United. Although the Reds lost the match 2\u20131, Mellor showed promise and was rewarded in March 2003 with a new three-year contract running to 2006. Despite his goal he was left out of the squad for the victorious 2003 Football League Cup Final."]}, {"page": "Peter Taylor (footballer, born 1928)", "response": ["Clough was appointed as manager at Third Division Brighton & Hove Albion on 1 November 1973, with Taylor joining as his assistant. Just after the pair were appointed, the team lost 4\u20130 at home to Walton & Hersham in an FA Cup replay and then 8\u20132 at home to Bristol Rovers on 1 December. Brighton finished 19th in the final table in the 1973\u201374 season, narrowly avoiding relegation to the Fourth Division, and the pair began to rebuild the team by signing Peter Grummitt, Andy Rollings, Ian Mellor, Steve Govier, and Ken Goodeve; Taylor felt that Clough never settled at Brighton however, and spent too much time away on media commitments. Clough left for Leeds United in July 1974, but Taylor refused to go with Clough as he felt Brighton and club chairman Mike Bamber had treated them well, and so the partnership ended after nine years as Taylor stayed at the Goldstone Ground as sole manager. He went on to sign striker Peter Ward and midfielder Brian Horton, but admitted that both he and Clough were much more effective as a duo; he felt that he had struggled to make the good players he signed play to their full potential whilst feeling that Clough had bought and sold poorly as Leeds manager. He stayed on at the South coast club for a further two seasons, guiding the team to a fourth-place finish in 1975\u201376, missing promotion by two points. His successor, Alan Mullery, managed to lead the team Taylor left behind to promotion in 1976\u201377 and then into the top-flight in 1978\u201379."]}, {"page": "Steel City derby", "response": ["The Boxing Day Massacre, was a match played on 26 December 1979. It was famous for being the biggest win in recent times for Wednesday, winning 4\u20130, with goals from Ian Mellor, Terry Curran, Mark Smith and Jeff King. The United side at the time were top of the league, while Wednesday were 4th in the table. The victory for Wednesday propelled them onto promotion and is widely believed to have shaped the next 20 years fortunes for Wednesday while United languished in the 3rd division before being relegated to the 4th division, which is the only time one of the Sheffield clubs has been in the bottom tier of the football league. The match was watched by a record Third Division crowd of 49,309 spectators and is still celebrated by Owls fans today."]}, {"page": "Ian Howat", "response": ["A product of Chester's youth policy, Howat made his Chester debut as a substitute in a Football League Third Division fixture against Mansfield Town on 16 October 1976. Later in the season he scored twice during the club's run to the FA Cup fifth round and netted the winner against Port Vale in the Debenhams Cup final at the end of the season. In his time at the club, Howat had spells playing in attack alongside fellow forwards including Paul Crossley, Ian Edwards, Ian Mellor, Peter Henderson, Ian Rush and Trevor Phillips without establishing himself as a first-team regular. He memorably found the target when Chester won 2\u20131 at Wrexham in April 1978, ending his hometown club's unbeaten home league record."]}, {"page": "Rodger Wylde", "response": ["Wylde continued to score goals regularly over the following two seasons and became a crowd favourite with Wednesday supporters who gave him the nickname \"Oscar\". Wylde's trademark celebration after scoring a goal was to go on his knees with arms aloft in front of the fans. The 1979\u201380 season saw Wylde not playing as regularly for the team as Terry Curran, Ian Mellor and Andy McCulloch became the main forwards during Wednesday's promotion that season from Division Three. He was sold by manager Jack Charlton midway through that season, with Wylde playing his final game on 16 February 1980 and moving to Oldham Athletic as a replacement for Vic Halom."]}, {"page": "Nigel Clutton", "response": ["Clutton was a prolific striker playing Saturday and Sunday League football for Chester-based sides Blacon YC, Crusaders, Reliance and the Union Vaults and working as a milkman when he was given his solitary Football League outing for Chester on 1 March 1978 at home to Carlisle United.
