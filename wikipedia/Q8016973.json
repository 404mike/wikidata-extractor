Originally named the \"Oregon Shakespearean Festival\"; the name was changed in 1988. Angus L. Bowmer, founder of OSF, wrote in 1954 that Shakespeare Festivals have in common the following attributes: 1) established firmly in one place; 2) repertoire (staging a variety of Shakespeare plays) and 3) a physical stage similar to that used in Shakespeare's lifetime.Oregon Shakespearean Association Fourteenth Season program, 1954, pg 3-4 According to Bowmer, the inspiration for Elizabethan staging of contemporary Shakespeare productions came from William Poel, an English director who organized the Elizabethan Stage Society in London in the early 20th century. His concepts of Elizabethan staging were brought to North America by Ben Iden Payne."]}, {"page": "Everyman (1901 play)", "response": ["The original play was written by Dutch Monk Peter van Diest (Petrus Dorlandus) about 1470 and tells the story of Everyman, who being commanded by God to begin his journey to the grave looks for companions to accompany him. Everyman then approaches a series of allegorical characters - such as Fellowship, Kindred and Knowledge - but finds that only the character representing \"Good Deeds\" stays with him until the end of his journey. There is no record of a modern production of this play until July 1901 when the Elizabethan Stage Society of William Poel gave three Saturday productions in an outdoor courtyard at the Charterhouse (a former monastery) in London.

While Brandram himself may be called a \"forgotten eccentric\", Poel was grateful enough to have raised funds for him, and his style of elocution formed part of Poel's drive to Shakespeare productions that were plainer and less self-consciously \"poetic\"."]}, {"page": "The Taming of the Shrew in performance", "response": ["In 1913, Martin Harvey, in collaboration with William Poel, directed a production at the Prince of Wales Theatre. Starring Harvey's wife Nina de Silva and Harvey himself as Petruchio, the production was very much in the style of Poel's own minimalist and authentically Elizabethan productions. Harvey kept Sly on stage throughout, however, in a unique move, he neither incorporated text from A Shrew nor did he have Sly lose interest and fall asleep. Instead, Sly explicitly reacts to the play - laughing at certain points, attempting to climb onto the stage during the wedding before being restrained by his 'wife', and finally succeeding in getting onto the stage later in the play, at which point he shook Petruchio's hand and then introduced himself to Katherina (albeit without dialogue). In an \"extremely conventional production\" at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in 1919, starring Ethel Warwick and Edmund Willard, William Bridges-Adams stuck rigidly to the First Folio text, but completely removed the Induction and all references to Sly."]}, {"page": "July 1901", "response": ["* Everyman, a revival of a late 15th-century English morality play, The Somonyng of Everyman, was staged for the first time in more than 300 years.
