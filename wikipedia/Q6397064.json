A second consecutive All-Ireland final appearance quickly followed on 11 September 1960, with Down providing the opposition. The game was played on an even keel for much of the first-half; however, an important incident turned the game in the Ulster men's favour eleven minutes after the interval. Kevin Mussen's line ball found Dan McCartan who sent in a high forty-yard lob which Kerry goalkeeper Johnny Culloty dropped over the goal-line. Two minutes later Paddy Doherty was pulled down in the square. He converted the subsequent penalty which put Down six points up. An historic final score of 2\u201310 to 0\u20138 resulted in a defeat for O'Dwyer's side, while the Sam Maguire Cup crossed the border into Northern Ireland for the first time."]}, {"page": "Clonduff GAC", "response": ["In 1955 the club split into two distinct entities \u2013 Cabra and Hilltown \u2013 the two ends of the parish.
