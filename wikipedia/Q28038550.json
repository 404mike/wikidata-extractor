She and her husband George Hartley co-founded the publication company Marvell Press in 1954, which published volumes of poetry. They also founded the record company Listen Records. After Hartley separated from her husband and left Marvell Press, she earned degrees in English Literature and Victorian Studies from the University of Hull in the early 1970s. She taught English at her former secondary school and lectured at the Hull College of Further Education. In 1995, Hartley was made vice-chairman of the Philip Larkin Society to promote the life and works of her friend and poet Philip Larkin. She was on the steering committee of the Larkin 25 committee in 2010.

Influenced by W. H. Auden, W. B. Yeats, and Thomas Hardy, his poems are highly structured but flexible verse forms. They were described by Jean Hartley, the ex-wife of Larkin's publisher George Hartley (the Marvell Press), as a \"piquant mixture of lyricism and discontent\", though anthologist Keith Tuma writes that there is more to Larkin's work than its reputation for dour pessimism suggests.Tuma 2001, p. 445.", "Larkin's poetry has been characterized as combining \"an ordinary, colloquial style\", \"clarity\", a \"quiet, reflective tone\", \"ironic understatement\" and a \"direct\" engagement with \"commonplace experiences\",Moran 2002, p. 151. while Jean Hartley summed his style up as a \"piquant mixture of lyricism and discontent\"."]}, {"page": "Jean (female given name)", "response": ["*Jean Hartley (1933\u20132011), English autobiographer and publisher"]}, {"page": "Hartley (surname)", "response": ["* Jean Hartley (1933\u20132011), English autobiographer and publisher"]}, {"page": "Winifred Dawson", "response": ["Dawson read one of Larkin's poems at the unveiling of the Larkin plaque at King's Cross station in London.
