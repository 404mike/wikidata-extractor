Their children included the poet Frederick Locker-Lampson (1821\u20131895) and the novelist-journalist Arthur Locker (1828\u20131893), later the editor of The Graphic. The couple lived at Windsor (1815\u201319) then at Greenwich (1819 onwards).  He was appointed secretary (1819) and then civil commissioner (1824) to the Royal Naval Hospital, which he worked to improve by adding new roads by John Macadam in the Northumbrian coal mines it owned and in 1824 carrying forward his father's plans for a Naval Gallery in the Hospital's Painted Hall, with a gift of 31 paintings from George IV (the nucleus of the later National Maritime Museum). He joined Lord John Russell again as one of the founder members of the Athenaeum Club. However a mental breakdown in 1844 forced him to retire from running the hospital, and he retired to Iver, where he died five years later."]}, {"page": "John Cordy Jeaffreson", "response": ["Jeaffreson was born at Framlingham, Suffolk, on 14 January 1831.
