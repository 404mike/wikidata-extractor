Fogg, Richard L. S. Taylor, and the late Carl Sagan who believe that it is humanity's moral obligation to make other worlds suitable for life, as a continuation of the history of life-transforming the environments around it on Earth.Robert Zubrin, The Case for Mars: The Plan to Settle the Red Planet and Why We Must, pp. 248\u2013249, Simon & Schuster/Touchstone, 1996, Fogg 2000 They also point out that Earth would eventually be destroyed if nature takes its course, so that humanity faces a very long-term choice between terraforming other worlds or allowing all terrestrial life to become extinct. Terraforming totally barren planets, it is asserted, is not morally wrong as it does not affect any other life."]}, {"page": "1960", "response": ["** Martyn J.

While concluding that arguments for protecting alien biota can be made from any of these standpoints, he also concludes with an argument, similar to Zubrin's, that strict preservationism is \"untenable\", since \"it assumes that human consciousness, creativity, culture and technology stand outside nature, rather than having been a product of natural selection. If Homo sapiens is the first space faring species to have evolved on Earth, space settlement would not involve acting 'outside nature', but legitimately 'within our nature'.\""]}, {"page": "Natural History of an Alien", "response": ["The next world visited is Epona, an imaginary ecosystem created by group of scientists and science fiction writers called The Epona Project and begun by Martyn J.
