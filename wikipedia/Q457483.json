The portrait of his mistress and business manager Joanna Hiffernan was created as a simple study in white; however, others saw it differently. The critic Jules-Antoine Castagnary thought the painting an allegory of a new bride's lost innocence. Others linked it to Wilkie Collins's The Woman in White, a popular novel of the time, or various other literary sources. In England, some considered it a painting in the Pre-Raphaelite manner. In the painting, Hiffernan holds a lily in her left hand and stands upon a bear skin rug (interpreted by some to represent masculinity and lust) with the bear's head staring menacingly at the viewer. The portrait was refused for exhibition at the conservative Royal Academy, but was shown in a private gallery under the title The Woman in White. In 1863 it was shown at the Salon des Refus\u00e9s in Paris, an event sponsored by Emperor Napoleon III for the exhibition of works rejected from the Salon.", "The Franco-Prussian War of 1870 fragmented the French art community.  Many artists took refuge in England, joining Whistler, including Camille Pissarro and Monet, while Manet and Degas stayed in France. Like Whistler, Monet and Pissarro both focused their efforts on views of the city, and it is likely that Whistler was exposed to the evolution of Impressionism founded by these artists and that they had seen his nocturnes. Whistler was drifting away from Courbet's \"damned realism\" and their friendship had wilted, as had his liaison with Joanna Hiffernan.Anderson and Koval, p. 141, plate 7.", "Whistler's lover and model for The White Girl, Joanna Hiffernan, also posed for Gustave Courbet. Historians speculate that Courbet used her as the model for his erotic painting L'Origine du monde, possibly leading to the breakup of the friendship between Whistler and Courbet. During the 1870s and much of the 1880s, he lived with his model-mistress Maud Franklin. Her ability to endure his long, repetitive sittings helped Whistler develop his portrait skills. He not only made several excellent portraits of her but she was also a helpful stand-in for other sitters.Whistler had several illegitimate children, of whom Charles Hanson is the best documented.Anderson and Koval, plate 40. After parting from his mistress Joanna Hiffernan, she helped to raise Whistler's son, Charles James Whistler Hanson (1870\u20131935),Patricia de Montfort, \"White Muslin: Joanna Hiffernan and the 1860s,\" in Whistler, Women, and Fashion (Frick Collection, New York, in association with Yale University Press, New Haven, 2003), p. 79. the result of an affair with a parlour maid, Louisa Fanny Hanson. By his common law mistress Maud Franklin Whistler had two daughters: Ione (born circa 1877) and Maud McNeill Whistler Franklin (born 1879).Spencer, p. 88.

We hope it will now be felt by Sir Edwin Landseer and his friends that the intrusion of \"pretty horsebreakers\" on the walls of the Academy is not less to be regretted than their presence in Rotten Row.' Whistler's painting was reminiscent enough of Landseer's that the judges were wary of admitting it.Spencer (1998), p. 310.
