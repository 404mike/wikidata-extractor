The inspiration for the instrumentals on this record was a trip around the United States. He spent his free time during his year of teaching working on the 26-track Am Deister album, which was eventually released in the spring of 2001. Reviews were almost unanimously positive, with many commenting on its originality, innocence and Bavarian quality. This was his first album release on CD and this, coupled with a less limited release, allowed his music to be brought to a larger audience. This album was the only release by \"Dave Tyack's Dakota Oak\" as Tyack wished to leave his old nom de plume behind and become known as David Tyack from this point (this is explained in its inlay card). The one single spawned by this album is \"How Danny's friends became a force for good\", the title taken from a chapter title in the John Steinbeck novel Tortilla Flat; the single also featured a cover of Neil Young's \"Helpless\". Meanwhile Tyack had gone from teaching to working in the call centre at Smile, the internet bank, which was a happier time for him, but a publishing deal allowed him to give up his job and concentrate on his music. He began collaborating more, with Badly Drawn Boy on \"Wrecking the Stage\" and Mum and Dad on \"Black Sabbath\" in 2000, and then joining Misty Dixon, another Twisted Nerve act, initially to aid with four-track recording but eventually playing drums and piano and writing with Jane Weaver. Misty Dixon's first release was the Milk Money EP in February 2001 with Dave co-writing one of the four tracks \"Headlights (and when we drive)\"; this release also garnered some acclaim.", "2002 saw Tyack collaborating, writing and recording for several releases. At the time of his disappearance he had completed recording on the first Misty Dixon album and the second D.O.T. album. He played on Jane Weaver's mini-album Like an aspen leaf, released in May 2002, and recorded new music for the Twisted Nerve compilation Zoo. He completed recording with Malcolm Mooney on Rip Van Winkle and also painted several paintings for the project, for exhibition and for the album's artwork.
