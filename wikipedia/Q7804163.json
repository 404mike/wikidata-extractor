In 1976, 21-year-old Richmond took the car onto Lakeville Speedway at Lakeville, Ohio for some practice laps. \"Somebody put a stopwatch on me,\" Richmond said. \"I was running laps faster than Dave had been. It was the first time I had ever driven a race car.\" Richmond and his father found a red, white and blue-colored No. 98 car in Pennsylvania, which was the same number and paint scheme that Richmond used on model cars as a child. In his first competition at the track, officials placed Richmond in the slowest heat. He passed several cars before spinning out and breaking an axle. Although he made several attempts to get the car pointed in the right direction, the broken axle prevented the car from driving straight. After being towed to the pits, he parked the car for the rest of the event. Later that season, they towed the car to Eldora Speedway, only to have Richmond crash the car again. In response, Richmond's father fired him as the driver. The next season, Al Richmond bought a SuperModified better suited to his son's driving style.  In 1977 Tim Richmond became both Sandusky Speedway's Rookie of the Year and the SuperModified class track champion.", "thumb|left|Richmond's car in 1983|alt=Tim Richmond circa 1983", "thumb|left|Richmond in Hendrick's No. 25 thumb|Tim Richmond Helmet", "Although Richmond attempted a comeback in 1988, NASCAR suspended him for testing positive for banned substances. Days later the substances were identified as Sudafed, a non-prescription over-the-counter allergy medication, and Advil, an over-the-counter pain reliever. In April 1988, Richmond sued NASCAR over the suspension. In the 2010 ESPN documentary film Tim Richmond: To The Limit Bill France Jr. of NASCAR acknowledged that it \"was not a good test.\" NASCAR also demanded he release his medical records to them, which he refused. Although he retested later that year and was reinstated, he could not find a car to drive. In his final public appearance in February 1988,  Richmond denied that he abused drugs and said that a mistake had been made in his drug test.
