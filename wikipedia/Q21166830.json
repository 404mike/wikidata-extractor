After travelling with his father to St Petersburg in 1768 to inoculate Catherine the Great and her son Grand Duke Paul against smallpox, he, along with his father, received an annuity and was created Baron Dimsdale of the Russian Empire. On his return he studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh graduating with an MB in 1771.\nHe returned to Russia with his father in 1781 to carry out further inoculations within the Russian royal family. He became a partner in the family bank of Baron Dimsdale, Sons, Barnard and Staples established by his father. When his father retired in 1790 he succeeded to his father's Parliamentary seat for Hertford, holding it until 1802.\nIn 1805 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.By then he was not in good health and died on a trip for his heath to Brighton in 1811. He was unmarried and left his estate to his sister Ann Dimsdale. His barony lapsed on his death but that of his father passed down in the family via his elder brother John.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society D, E, F", "response": ["| Nathaniel Dimsdale||21/11/1805||11 April 1748 \u2013 3 July 1811 MP"]}, {"page": "Thomas Dimsdale", "response": ["In 1762, perhaps due to his reputation within London society, he was invited to Russia to variolate the Empress Catherine the Great of Russia and her son, Grand Duke Paul.

The results were a success and Catherine rewarded Dimsdale with \u00a310,000, a pension of \u00a3500 per annum, \u00a32000 expenses and a Barony of the Russian Empire. Nathaniel was also rewarded and he too received a Barony. In case the results had produced adverse effects, the Empress had arranged for a relay of fast horses to be available to speed the Dimsdales out of the country. During the long preparatory period before the variolations he wrote Tracts on inoculation written and published at St Petersburg in the year 1768.
