He was formerly styled Earl of Ancram until he inherited the marquessate in 2004.\nBorn in London and educated at Ampleforth College, Ancram studied History at Christ Church, Oxford and read Law at the University of Edinburgh. After graduating from Edinburgh, he was called to the Scottish Bar and practised as an advocate before entering politics. He unsuccessfully contested West Lothian in 1970 but was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Berwick and East Lothian at the February 1974 general election and served until the election held in October of that year. He re-entered parliament in 1979, representing Edinburgh South until 1987. During this time, he served as a minister at the Scotland Office in Margaret Thatcher's government.\nAfter being elected to represent Devizes at the 1992 general election, Ancram served at the Northern Ireland Office in John Major's government. When Major was defeated at the 1997 general election, the Conservatives entered opposition and Ancram became Chairman of the Conservative Party under William Hague in 1998, having previously covered constitutional affairs in the Shadow Cabinet. This was followed by a period as Deputy Leader of the Conservative Party under Iain Duncan Smith and Michael Howard, during which time he served in the Shadow Cabinet as Shadow Foreign Secretary and Shadow Defence Secretary respectively.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ann Widdecombe", "response": ["In 1974, Widdecombe was personal assistant to Michael Ancram in the February and October general elections of that year.
