However, many names have been assigned (usually unintentionally) to two or more different genera. For example, the platypus belongs to the genus Ornithorhynchus although George Shaw named it Platypus in 1799 (these two names are thus synonyms). However, the name Platypus had already been given to a group of ambrosia beetles by Johann Friedrich Wilhelm Herbst in 1793. A name that means two different things is a homonym. Since beetles and platypuses are both members of the kingdom Animalia, the name could not be used for both.

According to Sonnerat, the name \"aye-aye\" was a \"cri d'exclamation & d'\u00e9tonnement\" (cry of exclamation and astonishment).  However, American paleoanthropologist Ian Tattersall noted in 1982 that the name resembles the Malagasy name \"hai hai\" or \"hay hay\", which refers to the animal and is used around the island. According to Dunkel et al. (2012), the widespread use of the Malagasy name indicates that the name could not have come from Sonnerat. Another hypothesis proposed by Simons and Meyers (2001) is that it derives from \"heh heh\", which is Malagasy for \"I don't know\".

The generic name Sagittarius is Latin for \"archer\", and the specific epithet serpentarius is from Latin serpens meaning \"serpent\" or \"snake\". A second edition of Miller's plates was published in 1796 as Cimelia physica, with added text by English naturalist George Shaw, who named it Vultur serpentarius.

The onomatopoeic term currawong itself is derived from the bird's call.Higgins et al., p. 530.

His successors also applied to the trustees for permission to destroy decayed specimens. In 1833, the Annual Report states that, of the 5,500 insects listed in the Sloane catalogue, none remained. The inability of the natural history departments to conserve its specimens became notorious: the Treasury refused to entrust it with specimens collected at the government's expense.
