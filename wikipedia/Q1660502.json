In 1983 he came second in the world individual championship, and in 1988 he played on the British team that won the world team championship. In 2019 he won the European championship, beating Matthias Berg in the final in Berlin.In mathematics he gained a PhD in 1989 for work on combinatorics, supervised by B\u00e9la Bollob\u00e1s.Between 1999 and 2001 he was the chief trainer of pre-undergraduates for the British IMO team.\nGodson of mathematical philosopher Imre Lakatos of the London School of Economics, he is a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Reversi", "response": ["| 1983 || Paris ||  Ken'Ichi Ishii || N/A ||  Imre Leader || N/A || N/A"]}, {"page": "Outline of combinatorics", "response": ["* Imre Leader"]}, {"page": "B\u00e9la Bollob\u00e1s", "response": ["Bollob\u00e1s has proved results on extremal graph theory, functional analysis, the theory of random graphs, graph polynomials and percolation.
