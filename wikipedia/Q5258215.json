After four seasons Rangers were relegated to the Northern Premier League. This form continued, but with the appointment of Ron Reid as manager during the 1983\u201384 season as manager the club soon began to rebuild its reputation and won the 1984\u201385 League title. Back in the Alliance, the Bob Lord Trophy, Jim Thompson Shield and Staffordshire Senior Cup were all won within two seasons. During the late eighties and early nineties, Rangers struggled in the Conference, with six managers in seven seasons following Reid's departure in May 1988. The sale of striker Stan Collymore to Crystal Palace in December 1990 for a substantial six-figure fee stands out in this period. Under the management of Dennis Booth, Rangers enjoyed a tremendous 1992\u201393 campaign. In the league they finished 6th and reached the FA Cup Second Round, defeating Lincoln City in a First Round replay at Marston Road.", "|  Dennis Booth"]}, {"page": "Booth (surname)", "response": ["* Dennis Booth (born 1949), British footballer, manager and coach"]}, {"page": "Chris Chilton", "response": ["Chilton eventually became assistant first-team manager under Colin Appleton and later Brian Horton and for a short-spell - also caretaker manager - following the sacking of Mike Smith.

The following season was more of a struggle, with Town finishing 20th. Horton, along with Dennis Booth, David Moss and Les Chapman, was sacked in October 1997 with Huddersfield at the bottom of the table having not won a single league match. Former fans favourite Peter Jackson, who had played for the club between 1990 and 1994, was quickly given the job. Jacko had inherited an unfit Town team that had amassed 4 points from a possible 27 and were rooted to the bottom of the table without a win to their name. The rut didn't stop there and Jacko only managed one point from a possible 15. On 1 November, Huddersfield finally won in the 15th match of the season, by beating Stoke City at the McAlpine 3\u20131. Town's fortunes started to change with a 1\u20130 win against Manchester City at Maine Road which happened to be the 10th anniversary of the 10\u20131 loss in 1987. Three wins in four followed this game and lifted Town from 24th to 22nd in the table. Town climbed to 18th in the table, after a run of six games without defeat (including a 5\u20132 win away at Crewe and a 5\u20131 home win against Oxford United). However, Huddersfield went on a terrible run of form and lost five games in six and fell back down to 22nd in the table. Fortunately, another six-game unbeaten run which saw four wins lifted Town to 14th in the table and Town's Division One status was secured. Against all the odds, Jacko and Taff had saved Town from relegation in the Great Escape season."]}, {"page": "David Moss (footballer, born 1952)", "response": ["After retiring from professional football due to a serious Achilles tendon injury, he quickly moved to Oxford United to join the coaching staff under Mark Lawrenson. Then Brian Horton took over at the Manor Ground and Moss was promoted to First Team Coach. Moss remained at the club for the next five years until Horton joined Manchester City in 1993; Moss followed him and became City's Coach. He then, in 1995, moved to Huddersfield Town as Coach again under Brian Horton. In 1997, Horton was sacked along with Moss, Assistant Manager Dennis Booth and Coach Les Chapman."]}, {"page": "1981\u201382 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["The season opened with four draws, somewhat ironic considering that McGrath had stated that 'forwards are much more important now' after the Football League changed a win from earning two points to three points. On 12 September, their club-record run of six consecutive draws came to an end. Four victories in five games then put Vale into seventh place, and Colin Tartt was signed from Chesterfield for \u00a315,000. A 2\u20130 home defeat to Sheffield United in front of the television cameras was the first of a run of four defeats in five games, and sent an injury-hit Vale down into mid-table. In November, Lee Harwood was forced to retire with a knee injury. Vale then went on a fifteen match unbeaten run in the league, and between 20 January and 6 March the team went on a club-record six consecutive home draws. Stoke City offered \u00a3100,000 plus incentives for Mark Chamberlain, but Chairman Don Ratcliffe called the offer 'an insult' and rejected it out of hand. Instead Tony Sealy arrived on loan, this time from Queens Park Rangers. On 6 February Mark Chamberlain scored a memorable goal at Field Mill when he stood off the pitch to avoid being caught offside, then returned to tackle a startled Rod Arnold and tap the ball into an empty net. Mansfield Town manager Stuart Boam was so enraged that the goal stood that he raced onto the pitch to verbally abuse the linesman. In March, Johnny Miller had to retire with a knee injury. On 20 March, Mark Harrison conceded 'a crazy goal' from Hull City left-back Dennis Booth at Boothferry Park, whose fifty yard free kick hit the back of the net after several bounces. Injuries hit the Vale squad and the promotion campaign faded away. On 1 May, Vale Park witnessed its lowest ever Football League attendance when a mere 1,924 turned up against York City."]}]}}
