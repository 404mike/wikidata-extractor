He refers to the \"First Partition of the Satrapies\" (Erste Verteilung der Satrapien). Droysen's view is that Perdiccas distributed the satrapies with a view toward removing his opponents from among the Companions at the scene; thus the changes were never legitimate promotions of Diadochi, persons who expected advancement within the Empire. George Grote, the Parliamentarian-turned-historian within the British Empire, did not share this skeptical view, at least of the assignments at Babylon. He says: \"All the above-named officers were considered as local lieutenants, administering portions of an empire one and indivisible, under Arridaeus. ... No one at this moment talked of dividing the empire.\" Droysen's view prevailed. Contemporaneously with the two, another parliamentarian and historian, Edward Bunbury, was using the concepts of Droysen, not Grote, in the standard reference works being chaired by William Smith. For the Partition of Babylon Bunbury offers Droysen\u2019s \"First partition of the provinces\" with alternatives \"division of the provinces\" and \"distribution of the provinces\". There is no mention of any Diadochi."]}, {"page": "Sir Edward Herbert Bunbury, 9th Baronet", "response": ["#REDIRECT Edward Bunbury"]}, {"page": "Edward Herbert Bunbury", "response": ["#REDIRECT Edward Bunbury"]}, {"page": "Sir Edward Bunbury, 9th Baronet", "response": ["#REDIRECT Edward Bunbury"]}, {"page": "Sir Henry Charles John Bunbury, 10th Baronet", "response": ["On the death of his Uncle Edward Bunbury in 1895 he succeeded to the Baronetcy.
