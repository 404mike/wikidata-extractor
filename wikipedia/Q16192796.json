His brother Tony Kelly was also a professional footballer.\nKelly was originally signed by Bobby Gould at Bristol Rovers as a striker. He often played on the wing due to his speed. When Gould left Rovers, Kelly then joined Terry Cooper across the city at Bristol City, before linking up with Gould again at First Division Coventry City. Despite being top-scorer in Coventry reserves, he never played in the first team due to fierce competition for places as Coventry struggled against relegation.\nKelly moved to Peterborough to secure first team football, shortly before Gould was sacked in 1984. Kelly was a popular forward at Peterborough, scoring in 1-in-4 games.\nKelly then had a lucrative year playing in Sweden.", "link_mentions": []}}
