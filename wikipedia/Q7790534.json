In the early 1860s, he and Robert Carpenter, his county colleague, were rated as the two finest batsmen in England. Richard Daft was among those ranking them as equal first, though George Parr reckoned Carpenter the better of the two.Hayward was from a famous cricketing family. His father was Daniel Hayward and his nephew was the Surrey and England batsman Tom Hayward.Hayward played as a right-handed batsman for Cambridge Town Club (Cambridgeshire) 1854\u201372 and also for numerous representative teams. At the end of the 1859 English cricket season, Hayward was one of the 12 players who took part in cricket's first-ever overseas tour when an England cricket team led by George Parr visited North America. He also was member of the second All England XI to tour Australia, and travelled out on the SS Great Britain\nHis overall first-class career record covered 118 matches.
