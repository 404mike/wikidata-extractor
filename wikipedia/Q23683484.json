He was the founder of the discipline of tribology, the science and engineering of interacting surfaces in relative motion. In 1966, Jost published a report which highlighted the cost of friction, wear and corrosion to the United Kingdom economy (1.1-1.4% of GDP). It was in this eponymous report that he coined the term tribology, which has now been widely adopted.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tribology", "response": ["The word tribology derives from the Greek root \u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03b2- of the verb , tribo, \"I rub\" in classic Greek, and the suffix -logy from , -logia \"study of\", \"knowledge of\".
