He was the founder of the discipline of tribology, the science and engineering of interacting surfaces in relative motion. In 1966, Jost published a report which highlighted the cost of friction, wear and corrosion to the United Kingdom economy (1.1-1.4% of GDP). It was in this eponymous report that he coined the term tribology, which has now been widely adopted.", "link_mentions": {}}}
