Soyer worked for the Lloyds for more than three years, becoming well known among the Shropshire landed gentry, who vied to lure him away from the Lloyds or, at least, to borrow his services for important occasions.Cowen, p. 24\u201325. During his employment with the Lloyds he decided to have his portrait painted by Fran\u00e7ois Simonau, a Belgian painter and teacher. Through Simonau he met a pupil, Elizabeth Emma Jones,Cowen, p. 26\u201327. whom he was to marry in 1837. Soyer left the Lloyds in the spring of 1836 to take over the kitchens of Archibald Kennedy, 1st Marquess of Ailsa at St Margaret's House near Twickenham, a large Thames-side residence that subsequently gave its name to its entire suburb. Ailsa also had a central London base at Privy Gardens in Whitehall. A gourmet and a consistent supporter of Whig reforming legislation in the House of Lords, Ailsa was a prominent freemason and it is possible that it was he who introduced Soyer to the craft, which he pursued for the rest of his life.Cowen, p. 28\u201329. Ailsa took a very active interest in the kitchen, discussing menus in detail with Soyer, and was to remain a long-term friend.
