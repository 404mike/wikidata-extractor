The main panel of pundits appeared for the first time consisting of presenter Bill O'Herlihy and pundits John Giles and Eamon Dunphy. For their coverage of 1998 World Cup, RT\u00c9 introduced the comedy Apres Match, a mock of the panel of pundits. The Apres Match pundits first appeared on RT\u00c9's late night comedy show The End with Barry Murphy. In 1998 the Apres Match pundits for the first time took control of the punditry of the third place play-off and in 2006 surprised themselves and audiences when Barry Murphy playing the part of Liam Brady accurately guess the result \u2013 Germany 3 and Portugal 1.
