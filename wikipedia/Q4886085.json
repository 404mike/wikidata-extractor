Boasting heavy use of synthesized bass and keyboards, the album was not received quite as well as its predecessors. It contained the singles \"Head On\" and \"Blues From A Gun\". By this time, the violence that was originally associated with the band was practically non-existent and the Reid brothers were less antagonistic and aggressive in general. The Rollercoaster EP (August 1990) would be their last release for over a year, the band undertaking a tour of the same name with My Bloody Valentine, Dinosaur Jr. and Blur.", "The brothers bought their own recording studio in 1991 in Elephant & Castle in South London, which they dubbed The Drugstore, and they returned in February 1992 with the first fruits of the new studio, their next single, \"Reverence\", which gave them their biggest hit single in almost five years, reaching No.\u00a010 in the UK. Spitting feedback and punk rock bile in every direction, the track was banned from being played on BBC Radio 1 and from Top of the Pops, due to its potentially offensive lyrics ('I wanna die just like JFK, I wanna die in the USA'...'I wanna die just like Jesus Christ, I wanna die on a bed of spikes'). The single was followed by the release of the album Honey's Dead (1992), which received mixed reviews. Following the Rollercoaster Tour to support the album, the band concentrated on cracking the United States, with an appearance on David Letterman's show, and a tour as part of the Lollapalooza line-up, which William later described as \"the worst experience of our lives,\" followed by their own headlining tour. In December 1992, the Reids again lost their rhythm section, with Ben Lurie returning and Steve Monti joining on drums. Another compilation was released in 1993, The Sound of Speed, before they returned to the studio to record their fifth album proper, Stoned & Dethroned which would see release in 1994, and featured guest appearances from Shane MacGowan and William's then-girlfriend Hope Sandoval. The album was originally planned as an acoustic album, but this idea was abandoned because, in Jim's words, \"We couldn't do enough interesting things with acoustic guitars to make an album\". In the 1995 EP released under American Records, a number of new works and B-sides were published which were later collected in the album Munki.", "Though it was not until October 1999 that the split was made official, on 12 September 1998, William had a falling out in the tour bus with guitarist Ben Lurie before they were to play a sold out performance at the famous Los Angeles House of Blues. Jim appeared onstage apparently drunk and barely able to stand or sing. William walked offstage about 15 minutes into their set, and the show ended. The audience was later refunded the price of their tickets. The band finished up their U.S. and Japanese dates without William, but from that point, it was clear that the band was at its end. Jim Reid said in 2006 of the tension between himself and William: \"After each tour we wanted to kill each other, and after the final tour we tried\".", "* Ben Lurie\u00a0\u2013 rhythm guitar/bass (1989\u20131998)", "  bar:Ben text:Ben Lurie"]}, {"page": "The Gun Club", "response": ["In May 1994, Mori and Pierce split up, and she and Sanderson left the Gun Club (Mori and Sanderson formed Freeheat in 1999 with Jim Reid and Ben Lurie of the Jesus and Mary Chain).

The two decided that a guitarist was needed. So after placing an ad in the magazine Loot, the band invited Ben Lurie, a guitarist from Australia, to join them, only to see him leave them less than a week later to join The Jesus and Mary Chain. Shortly after they discovered guitarist Andy Miller, who came from Neasden (originally Northolt (an in-band joke)).

The T\u00e9dio Boys built a reputation for riotous live shows and clashes with police, and toured 3 times in the United States. The band secured support slots on tours with the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion and The Fall, where they caused further controversy and excitement by often appearing on stage naked. After the end of the band, they formed The Parkinsons, recorded a demo which would become most of their albums, sent it to Afonso so he could learn the lyrics and relocated to London 3 months after in 2000.
