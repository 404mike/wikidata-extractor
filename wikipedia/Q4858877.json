Belgian historian Jean Stengers commented, \"Terrible things happened, but Hochschild is exaggerating. It is absurd to say so many millions died.\" Hochschild was also criticized by Barbara Emerson, the author of a biography of Leopold, who described his book as \"a very shoddy piece of work\" and declared that \"Leopold did not start a genocide. He was greedy for money and chose not to interest himself when things got out of control.\" Hochschild does not use the word genocide, but describes how the mass deaths happened as a result of the forced labor system instituted at Leopold's direction. Other historians have painted a picture similar to Hochschild's of the high death toll in Leopold's Congo, among them Jan Vansina, who appeared in the documentary based on the book, and the demographer .\"What is Known of the Demographic History of Zaire Since 1885,\" in Bruce Fetter, ed. Demography from Scanty Evidence: Central Africa in the Colonial Era(Boulder, CO: Lynne Rienner, 1990), p. 303.

According to historian David Van Reybrouck, \"It would be absurd\u00a0... to speak of an act of 'genocide' or a 'holocaust'; genocide implies the conscious, planned annihilation of a specific population, and that was never the intention here, or the result\u00a0... But it was definitely a hecatomb, a slaughter on a staggering scale that was not intentional, but could have been recognised much earlier as the collateral damage of a perfidious, rapacious policy of exploitation\". Historian Barbara Emerson stated, \"Leopold did not start genocide. He was greedy for money and chose not to interest himself when things got out of control.\" According to Hochschild, \"while not a case of genocide, in the strict sense\", the atrocities in the Congo were \"one of the most appalling slaughters known to have been brought about by human agency\"."]}, {"page": "1969 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships", "response": ["| Brenda Eisler Barbara Emerson || "]}]}}
