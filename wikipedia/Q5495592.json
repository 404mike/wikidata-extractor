A New Yorker review of his first novel declares \"Wall, who is also a poet, writes prose so charged\u2014at once lyrical and syncopated\u2014that it's as if Cavafy had decided to write about a violent Irish household\". In a recent review, his long poem \"Job in Heathrow\", anthologised in The Forward Book of Poetry 2010 but originally published in The SHOp, was described as \"a chilling airport dystopia\". Poet Fred Johnston suggests that Wall's poetry sets out to \"list the shelves of disillusion under which a thinking man can be buried\". \"His apocalyptic vision of the ecological demise of our planet is suffused with humility and resignation where the global catastrophe is transformed \u201cinto a universal truth / the days are shorter / today than yesterday\u201d\", according to Borb\u00e1la Farag\u00f3. For Philip Coleman \"Ghost Estate is a deeply political book, but it also articulates a profound interest in and engagement with questions of aesthetics and poetics\"."]}, {"page": "Desmond Hogan", "response": ["In 1971 he won the Hennessy Award.

His habit is to be elliptical in politics, to insert a political jibe or universal truth as adroitly as an assassin\u2019s knife\".

The following year he received an Arts Council bursary and his collection was shortlisted for the Irish Book Awards.
