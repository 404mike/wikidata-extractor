Moriarty was also featured in the fourth and final Sherlock Holmes novel The Valley of Fear but never made direct appearance in the story. Apart from that Holmes mentions him in five other stories namely, The Adventure of the Empty House, The Adventure of the Norwood Builder, The Adventure of the Missing Three-Quarter, The Adventure of the Illustrious Client, His Last Bow. The character was introduced primarily as a narrative device to enable Doyle to kill Sherlock Holmes. Although many adaptations and pastiches give him the first name of James, the first Doyle story to feature him (\"The Final Problem\") does not give him a first name, whereas the short story \"The Adventure of the Empty House\" said his first name is James (previously said to be the name of his brother).\nMoriarty is a machiavellian, consulting criminal mastermind who does not commit crimes himself but uses his intelligence and network of resources to provide criminals with strategies for their crimes and sometimes protection from the law, all in exchange for a fee or a cut of profit. Holmes likens Moriarty to a spider at the center of a web and calls him the \"Napoleon of crime\", a phrase Doyle lifted from a Scotland Yard inspector referring to Adam Worth, a real-life criminal mastermind and one of the individuals upon whom the character of Moriarty was based. Despite only twice appearing in Doyle's original stories, later adaptations and pastiches have often given Moriarty greater prominence and treated him as Sherlock Holmes' archenemy.", "link_mentions": {}}}
