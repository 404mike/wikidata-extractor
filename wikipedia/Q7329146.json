Free will in antiquity was not discussed in the same terms as used in the modern free will debates, but historians of the problem have speculated who exactly was first to take positions as determinist, libertarian, and compatibilist in antiquity.Susanne Bobzien, Determinism and Freedom in Stoic Philosophy; Timothy O'Keefe, Epicurus on Freedom, R. W. Sharples, Alexander of Aphrodisias On Fate , David Furley, Two Studies in the Greek Atomists, Richard Sorabji, \"Necessity, Cause, and Blame \" There is wide agreement that these views were essentially fully formed over 2000 years ago. Candidates for the first thinkers to form these views, as well as the idea of a non-physical \"agent-causal\" libertarianism, include Democritus (460\u2013370 BC), Aristotle (384\u2013322 BC), Epicurus (341\u2013270 BC), Chrysippus (280\u2013207 BC), and Carneades (214\u2013129 BC).", "Richard Sorabji's 1980 Necessity, Cause, and Blame surveyed Aristotle's positions on causation and necessity, comparing them to his predecessors and successors, especially the Stoics and Epicurus. Sorabji argues that Aristotle was an indeterminist, that real chance and uncaused events exist, but never that human actions are uncaused in the extreme libertarian sense that some commentators mistakenly attribute to Epicurus.", "Aristotle accepted the past as fixed, in the sense that past events were irrevocable. But future events cannot be necessitated by claims about the present truth value of statements about the future. Aristotle does not deny the excluded middle (either p or not p), only that the truth value of p does not exist yet. Indeed, although the past is fixed, the truth value of past statements about the future can be changed by the outcome of future events. This is the problem of future contingents.Richard Sorabji, Necessity, Cause, and Blame, p. ix", "    I come now to the question of how determinism is related to involuntariness. Many commentators nowadays hold one or more parts of the following view. Determinism creates a problem for belief in the voluntariness of actions. Regrettably, but inevitably, Aristotle was unaware of this problem, and so failed to cope with it. Indeed, the problem was not discovered until Hellenistic times, perhaps by Epicurus, who was over forty years junior to Aristotle, and who reached Athens just too late to hear his lectures. In Aristotle's time no one had yet propounded a universal determinism, so that he knew of no such theory. His inevitable failure to see the threat to voluntariness is all the more regrettable in that he himself entertained a deterministic account of actions, which exacerbated the problem of how any could be voluntary. I shall argue that this account misrepresents the situation.Richard Sorabji, Necessity, Cause, and Blame, p. 243"]}, {"page": "King's College London Faculty of Arts and Humanities", "response": ["* Richard Sorabji, Emeritus Professor of Philosophy"]}, {"page": "Edmund Boulter", "response": ["In 1736 his nephew of the same name died at Avignon where he had taken his daughter for the benefit of her health. \"Edmund Boulter (1678-1736), of Harewood, Yorks, and Hasely Court, Oxon, left to the College \u00a320 yearly for a Scholarship, to be called the Cutler-Boulter Scholarship, in honour of his [great-]uncle, Sir John Cutler.
