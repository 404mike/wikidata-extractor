The appointment caused considerable surprise, given that candidates such as Osborne Reynolds or Richard Glazebrook were older and more experienced in laboratory work.  Thomson was known for his work as a mathematician, where he was recognized as an exceptional talent."]}, {"page": "Institute of Physics", "response": ["In the early part of the 20th century, the profession of \"physicist\" emerged, partly as a result of the increased demand for scientists during the First World War. In 1917, following discussions between William Eccles and William Duddell, the Council of the Physical Society, along with the Faraday Society, the Optical Society, and the Roentgen Society, started to explore ways of improving the professional status of physicists, and in 1918, the Institute of Physics was created at a meeting of the four societies held at King's College London. In 1919, Sir Richard Glazebrook was elected first president of the institute, and the inaugural meeting of the Institute took place in 1921. As with the Physical Society, dissemination of knowledge was fundamental to the institute, which began publication of the Journal of Scientific Instruments in 1922. The annual Reports on Progress in Physics began in 1934 and is still published today. In 1952, the institute began the \"Graduateship\" course and examination, which ran until 1984 when the expansion of access to universities removed demand."]}, {"page": "King's School, Rochester", "response": ["This was opened in 1909 by Dr Richard Glazebrook, Director of the National Physical Laboratory.

Richard Glazebrook, a final-year student at the time, wrote of them that they were 'a revelation', and praised Lamb for his lucid presentation of the properties of liquids in rotational motion. However, Lamb soon became romantically involved with Elizabeth Foot, sister-in-law to his former headmaster, and, since the conditions of his position at Trinity stipulated that he should hold it only so long as he was unmarried, he was compelled, in 1875, to resign and continue his work elsewhere."]}, {"page": "List of people from Merseyside", "response": ["* Sir Richard Glazebrook: Physicist."]}, {"page": "Hertha Ayrton", "response": ["George Eliot supported Ayrton's application to Girton College, Cambridge. There, Ayrton studied mathematics and was coached by physicist Richard Glazebrook. She also constructed a sphygmomanometer (blood pressure meter), led the choral society, founded the Girton fire brigade, and, together with Charlotte Scott, formed a mathematical club. In 1880, Ayrton passed the Mathematical Tripos, but Cambridge did not grant her an academic degree because at the time it did not award full degrees to women. Ayrton then passed an external examination at the University of London, which awarded her a Bachelor of Science degree in 1881."]}, {"page": "David Henderson (British Army officer)", "response": ["In 1915 Henderson returned to London to resume his London-based duties as director-general of military aeronautics, which Sefton Brancker had been performing in his absence.  This meant that when, in 1917, General Jan Smuts was writing his review of the British Air Services, Henderson was well placed to assist. While seconded to General Smuts, Henderson wrote much of what came to be called the Smuts Report. It has been argued that he had a better claim to the informal title \"father of the Royal Air Force\" than Sir Hugh Trenchard. Trenchard himself believed that Henderson deserved the accolade.

He was appointed principal assistant in 1909 and superintendent of the electricity department in 1917. His work ethic was much influenced by that of the director, Sir Richard Glazebrook. Over a period of ten years he worked on the creation of \"accurate electrical standards and methods of measurement\", including devices to accurately measure amperes, ohms, and volts, as well as improvements to the Weston cell. These developments led Smith to propose an international congress on electrical units and standards. It was held in London in 1908. In March 1910 he sailed to Washington to assist the National Bureau of Standards in the implementation of the new standards. The Bureau described his contribution: \"This work, claiming an accuracy\u00a0[...] of 1 in 100 000, marks the beginning of a new epoch in the history of the absolute measurement of electrical quantities\"."]}, {"page": "Edge Hill University", "response": ["Palatine Court Halls are named after prominent individuals associated with the historic Lancashire County Palatine: Carrington (artist Leonora Carrington), Glazebrook (physicist Richard Glazebrook), Pankhurst (campaigner for women's suffrage Emmeline Pankhurst), Roscoe (abolitionist and historian William Roscoe), Lowry (artist L.

The first issue was introduced by J. J. Thomson, then president of the Institute of Physics, who stated that no publication existed at that time in the English language specially devoted to scientific instruments. The idea for the journal was promoted by Richard Glazebrook, the first president, then director, of the National Physical Laboratory, where the journal was initially edited. The need for interdisciplinarity was recognised even then, with the desire to co-opt biologists, engineers, chemists, and instrument makers, \"as well as physicists\", on the scientific advisory committee. The Institute of Physics merged with the Physical Society of London in 1960. By this time the Proceedings of the Physical Society had grown in size and the quality of the applied journals, British Journal of Applied Physics and Journal of Scientific Instruments, had been improved. In 1968 these journals were merged to form part of the Journal of Physics series of journals, A to E, the fifth journal in the series being Journal of Physics E: Scientific Instruments. In 1990 the journal was renamed as Measurement Science and Technology to reflect the shift away from many scientists making their own instruments.

The rules called for two-seater aircraft capable of various speed, climb, endurance and field operation conditions. O'Gorman was on the judging committee, so \"factory\" aircraft were not allowed to compete; nevertheless the B.E.2 put in regular appearances at the trials, where its performance was clearly superior to most of the competing aircraft. The B.E.1/B.E.2 design was mass-produced with minor changes as the B.E.2a and later developed into the B.E.2c by E. T. Busk. Busk's objective was to create an inherently stable aircraft for military observation purposes.  Unfortunately the aircraft's stability resulted in a loss of manoeverability, and when German aircraft fitted with synchronised guns appeared in 1915 the losses of B.E.2c aircraft during the Fokker Scourge of 1915 led to a parliamentary inquiry.  Although this did not find O'Gorman at faultReport on the Royal Aircraft Factory'Flight 3 August 1916 it led to O'Gorman's departure from the Factory: his contract, which was to expire in October, was not renewed.  O'Gorman, now holding the rank of lieutenant-colonel in the Royal Flying Corps, remained as a consulting engineer to the Director-General of Military Aeronautics from 1916 to 1919.
