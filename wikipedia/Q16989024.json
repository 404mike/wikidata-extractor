He was called to the bar at the Middle Temple, 24 November 1848. He became editor of Bell's Life in London on the illness of his father in 1851. He was remarkable for his urbanity, and for the fair manner in which he discharged the duties of arbitrator and umpire in numerous cases of disputes connected with the prize-ring. He had the control of the arrangements of the international fight between Thomas Sayers and John C. Heenan, 17 April 1860, and it was by his advice that the combatants agreed to consider it a drawn battle, and to each receive a belt."]}, {"page": "Bell's Life in London", "response": ["Bell's Life was founded by Robert Bell, a London printer-publisher. Bell sold it to William Innell Clement, owner of The Observer, in 1824 or 1825, and the paper swallowed up a competitor, Pierce Egan's Life in London and Sporting Guide. From 1824 to 1852 it was edited by Vincent George Dowling, \"during which time Bell's Life became Britain's leading sporting newspaper, without which no gentleman's Sunday was quite complete\".Tony Mason, \u2018Dowling, Vincent George (1785\u20131852)\u2019, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 29 Dec 2007 Dowling's son, Frank Lewis Dowling, effectively edited the paper during the last year of his father's life, and succeeded him as editor from 1852 to 1867. By the 1860s Bell's Life was facing   competition from The Field, The Sportsman, Sporting Life, and The Sporting Times. In 1885 Edward Hulton bought Bell's Life and made it a daily, but in 1886 it was absorbed by Sporting Life.Waterloo Directory of English Newspapers and Periodicals"]}, {"page": "William Innell Clement", "response": ["During this time Clement was also the publisher of the Weekly Political Register, which was edited by William Cobbett. He stood by Cobbett when the latter man left for the United States on the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act in 1817. Three years later, Clement sold the Weekly Political Register and his newsvending business to W. H. Smith. He then bought the Morning Chronicle on the death of James Perry in 1821 for \u00a342,000, raising most of the purchase money by bills. The transaction involved him with Messrs. Hurst & Robinson, the publishers, and their bankruptcy in 1825 hit him very hard. After losing annually on the Morning Chronicle, Clement sold it to John Easthope in 1834 for \u00a316,500. More profitable for Clement was his ownership of Bell's Life in London, which he purchased between 1824 and 1825. Under the editorship of Vincent George Dowling, Bell's Life in London became a leading sporting paper, with its circulation growing from 3,000 to over 30,000 in the first two decades of Clement's ownership.D.
