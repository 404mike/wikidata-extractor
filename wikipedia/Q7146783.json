He began his military career in the Royal Flying Corps as a fighter ace, but later switched to bombers. He became well enough versed in armaments that he was appointed Director of Armament Production by Winston Churchill at the start of the Second World War. After being invalided out of the RAF for blindness, he continued to serve as President of the Air Armaments Board and was responsible for designing ever larger bombs for the bombardment of Germany. Eventually, he designed Blockbuster bombs as large as ten tons.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "No. 41 Squadron RAF", "response": ["* Having graduated Sandhurst in 1915, Air Commodore Patrick Huskinson was seconded to the RFC later that same year, and served on 2, 4, and 19 Squadrons before the cessation of hostilities. He was credited with 11 victories, and awarded two Military Crosses. Following the war, he commanded 204 and 70 Squadrons, and then spent four years in instructing roles at Cranwell. For the following 11 years from the mid-1920s, he fulfilled armament and ordinance roles in the United Kingdom and Middle East, with the exception of a 20-month period between February 1930 and October 1931 when he commanded 41 Squadron. Returning to ordinance in March 1938, he became vice president of the Ordnance Committee at Woolwich Arsenal and then the Director of Armament Development with the Ministry of Aircraft Production in 1940, reporting to Lord Beaverbrook. In April 1941, however, Huskinson and his wife were seriously injured by Luftwaffe night-time bombing in the Blitz and Huskinson was blinded. Following nine months\u2019 convalescence, he was retired as an Air Commodore in January 1942. However, he immediately became the president of the Air Armament Board, which post he held until 1945. In this role, he was involved in the development of large bunker-busting bombs, such as the Tall Boy, and in several other technologies, despite his handicap. In 1945, he was appointed a CBE and the U.S. Legion of Merit for his work in this role. Huskinson also wrote an autobiography in 1949 called 'Vision Ahead', which explains his career in some detail. He also recalls his \"very happy years in charge of Number 41 Squadron\". It was also Huskinson who wrote to the Mayor of St. Omer and obtained permission for 41 Squadron to use part of the Town Arms in its badge.", "| Patrick Huskinson, CBE, MC & Bar || 6 February 1930 ||  || William Kent AFC || 1 September 1965"]}, {"page": "List of Old Harrovians", "response": ["*Air Commodore Patrick Huskinson (1897\u20131966)"]}, {"page": "No. 19 Squadron RAF", "response": ["From November 1917, the squadron started to receive Sopwith Dolphins to replace its Spads, it being fully equipped with the Dolphin during January 1918, flying its first operational patrol with the new fighter on 3 February.Chorlton Aeroplane Autumn 2014, p. 58.
