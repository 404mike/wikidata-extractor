He began his military career in the Royal Flying Corps as a fighter ace, but later switched to bombers. He became well enough versed in armaments that he was appointed Director of Armament Production by Winston Churchill at the start of the Second World War. After being invalided out of the RAF for blindness, he continued to serve as President of the Air Armaments Board and was responsible for designing ever larger bombs for the bombardment of Germany. Eventually, he designed Blockbuster bombs as large as ten tons.", "link_mentions": {}}}
