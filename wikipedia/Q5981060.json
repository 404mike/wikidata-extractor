In March 1981 he returned to the band full-time, and would co-write  much of their early 1980s material. He left the band in 1987.Burden recorded a solo album, Loot, in 1990.\nIn 1995, Burden released a CD through Inertia Records entitled A Swim in the Ocean. This was a collaboration with Human League session player and contributor Russell Dennett. The band called themselves Deep Down Crazy, and consisted of Dan Boulton on vocals, Chris Broadhead on drums, Russell Dennett on guitar/keyboards/vocals and Burden on bass/keyboards. The recording took place at The Stockyard in Leicestershire.\nBurden played bass guitar on the 2006 debut eponymous release for The Tenth Stage, a Melbourne-based band, and also on their second album, Grand Guignol. The bass guitar used on these recordings (a Fender Telecaster Bass) was the same one he used to record \"I Love You Too Much\" and \"(Keep Feeling) Fascination\" (although in the Fascination video he is playing its technical direct successor, the Fender Precision Bass). He played an Ibanez Musician bass on \"Mirror Man\" and \"The Lebanon\", and in some live performances (including their Top of the Pops performance of \"Fascination\").Burden also contributed bass guitar to Parralox's State of Decay album, released in Germany in 2009.In 2018, he released the second solo album Hey Hey Ho Hum .", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Human League", "response": ["In addition to Sulley and Catherall, Oakey employed professional musician Ian Burden from Sheffield synth band Graph as a session keyboard player for the tour to cover for the keyboards of the now departed Ware and Marsh.", "In January 1981, although they had survived the tour, the band was still in trouble. Heavily in debt to Virgin Records, Oakey and Wright were under pressure to produce results quickly. By February 1981 the band recorded and rushed out \"Boys and Girls\". Sulley and Catherall (who had returned to their sixth-form full-time) were not involved in the recording but were included on the single's front cover. The single reached No.\u00a047 in the UK charts, the band's highest chart position to that point. Oakey acknowledged that he needed to bring in professional musicians, and so Ian Burden was tracked down and invited to join the band as a trial member.", "In 1987, Ian Burden also left the band. In November 1988, a greatest hits compilation album was released that reached No.\u00a03 in UK. This was preceded by the release of the single \"Love Is All That Matters\" from Crash.", "In 1990, the band released their last album for Virgin Records, Romantic?. By now, longstanding members Adrian Wright and Ian Burden, together with newer recruit Jim Russell, had all left the band, although Jo Callis did return to play on some of the sessions and co-wrote two songs, including the minor hit single \"Heart Like a Wheel\". New to the line-up were keyboardist Neil Sutton, who had worked with the band on the Crash tour of 1986, and guitarist/keyboardist Russell Dennett. At odds with the prevailing trend of US grunge and the Manchester scene, the Romantic? album did not re-capture the group's huge commercial success of the 1980s, with its second single \"Soundtrack to a Generation\" barely charting.", "* Ian Burden \u2013 keyboards, bass (1980\u20131987)", " bar:Burden text:\"Ian Burden\""]}, {"page": "Newark-on-Trent", "response": ["*Ian Burden (born 1957) \u2013 keyboard player with the Human League"]}, {"page": "Patience (George Michael album)", "response": ["*\"Shoot the Dog\" samples \"Love Action (I Believe in Love)\" by The Human League, written by Philip Oakey and Ian Burden."]}, {"page": "Crash (The Human League album)", "response": ["Keyboard players Philip Adrian Wright and Ian Burden also had been sidelined by Jam and Lewis.

This was followed by \"Open Your Heart\", which became another Top 10 hit. Soon afterwards they released a full album, Dare, much of it written by Oakey. Dare would soon become a number-one album in the UK and achieve multi-platinum status. At the end of 1981, the fourth and final single from the album, \"Don't You Want Me\", gave the band their first number one and went on to sell over 1.5 million in the UK, staying at number one for five weeks. It also topped the chart in the US the following year, selling another million copies there.

After the acrimonious split of the original band in October 1980 and the subsequent recruitment of Sulley and Catherall, the new band had only just survived a European tour by bringing in session keyboardist Ian Burden to temporarily assist. The band were deeply in debt and only barely commercially viable. Under pressure to produce results from Virgin Records, original members Oakey and Wright returned to Monumental Studios in Sheffield to start recording demo tracks. They recorded the track \"Boys and Girls\" from the 1980 tour, which Virgin then quickly released as a single. The style of \"Boys and Girls\" was more reminiscent of the band's earlier work. Sulley and Catherall, who were busy with school, appeared on the cover of the single but did not perform on the track itself. The synthesiser work was basic as Oakey and Wright admitted they lacked the skill of former members Marsh and Ware.  When \"Boys and Girls\" peaked at number 47 on the UK Singles Chart, Oakey realised that he would need to bring in experienced personnel to take the band in the more pop and commercial sounding direction he wanted.", "Oakey's first move was to invite guitarist and keyboard player Ian Burden from their 1980 tour back to join the band full-time. As a trained musician, not only were Burden's keyboard skills vastly superior to Oakey and Wright's but he instantly proved to be an adept songwriter as well. Virgin had suggested that Oakey needed professional production and paired him with veteran producer Martin Rushent, an expert on emerging music technologies of the time. Rushent would move the band to his Genetic Sound Studios in Reading both due to the \"unhealthy\" atmosphere at Monumental Studios in Sheffield caused by the Human League sharing it with Heaven 17, and that Rushent's studios were better-equipped for the type of music the band was making. A downside would be that the distance would cause problems for Sulley and Catherall who were taking their final school exams at the time and had to be bussed down from Sheffield regularly.", "* Ian Burden \u2013 synthesizers"]}, {"page": "List of bass guitarists", "response": ["* Ian Burden (The Human League)"]}, {"page": "Joanne Catherall", "response": ["Soon after Boys and Girls came the recruitment of professional musicians Ian Burden and Jo Callis, which sharpened the band's output considerably.
