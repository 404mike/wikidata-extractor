The first was probably a radio production of The Man of Property  in 11 weekly parts commencing 9 December 1945 on the BBC Home Service. The music used as the opening and closing theme came from Edward Elgar's Enigma Variations, specifically the Nimrod variation. This adaptation starred Leo Genn as Jo, Grizelda Hervey as Irene and Ronald Simpson as Soames.  It was adapted by Muriel Levy and produced by Val Gielgud and Felix Felton. Young Jolyons in later adaptations included Andrew Cruickshank, Leo Genn and Guy Rolfe. Another production of the dramatised cycle, which had Rachel Gurney as Irene, Noel Johnson as Young Jolyon and Alan Wheatley as Soames, came soon after the 1967 TV series. The version broadcast in 1990 comprised a 75-minute opening episode followed by 22 hour-long episodes, entitled The Forsyte Chronicles. It was the most expensive radio drama serial ever broadcast, due to its length and its big-name cast, which included Dirk Bogarde, Diana Quick, Michael Williams and Alan Howard. This radio series was rerun on BBC 7 radio in 2004, and has been released commercially."]}, {"page": "Diane de Poitiers", "response": ["* Nostradamus (1994), portrayed by Diana Quick"]}, {"page": "Nicholas and Alexandra", "response": ["*Diana Quick as Sonya, Petya's wife"]}, {"page": "Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford", "response": ["* Diana Quick, actress"]}, {"page": "2000 in film", "response": ["| Saving Grace || Fine Line Features || Nigel Cole (director); Mark Crowdy, Craig Ferguson (screenplay); Brenda Blethyn, Craig Ferguson, Martin Clunes, Tch\u00e9ky Karyo, Valerie Edmond, Jamie Foreman, Bill Bailey, Diana Quick, Tristan Sturrock, Phyllida Law, Linda Kerr Scott, Leslie Phillips, Paul Brooke, Ken Campbell, Clive Merrison || Comedy || Live action"]}, {"page": "1996 in film", "response": ["| Rasputin: Dark Servant of Destiny || HBO Pictures / Rysher Entertainment / Citadel Entertainment || Uli Edel (director); Peter Pruce (screenplay); Alan Rickman, Greta Scacchi, Ian McKellen, David Warner, John Wood, James Frain, Ian Hogg, Sheila Ruskin, Peter Jeffrey, Freddie Findlay, Julian Curry, Istv\u00e1n Bicskei, John Cater, Istv\u00e1n Hunyadk\u00fcrti, Zsofia Ivony, G\u00e1bor Koncz, Patricia Kov\u00e1cs, Robert Lang, Elena A.
