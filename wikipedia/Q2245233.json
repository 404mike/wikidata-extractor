According to sociologist John Thompson, the debate of sensationalism used in the mass medium of broadcasting is based on a misunderstanding of its audience, especially the television audience. Thompson explains that the term 'mass' (which is connected to broadcasting) suggests a 'vast audience of many thousands, even millions of passive individuals'. Television news is restricted to showing the scenes of crimes rather than the crime itself because of the unpredictability of events, whereas newspaper writers can always recall what they did not witness. Television news writers have room for fewer words than their newspaper counterparts. Their stories are measured in seconds, not column inches, and thus (even with footage) television stories are inherently shallower than most newspaper stories, using shorter words and familiar idioms to express ideas which a newspaper writer is more free to expand upon and define with precision."]}, {"page": "Public sphere", "response": ["John Thompson criticises the traditional idea of public sphere by Habermas, as it is centred mainly in face-to-face interactions.

Eysenck and Wilson described Freud and Philosophy as a good example of a defense of psychoanalysis against the claim that it should be so evaluated. They argued that Ric\u0153ur espoused a form of \"extreme subjectivism\" which implies that psychoanalytic theories cannot be tested empirically or shown to be mistaken. They suggested that Freud would have rejected Ric\u0153ur's conclusions and that few psychologists or psychoanalysts would accept them. They also argued that if Ric\u0153ur's conclusions were to be accepted, this would further undermine psychoanalysis. Kline wrote that Ric\u0153ur might be correct that psychoanalysis cannot be dealt with through experiments based on quantifiable evidence, but argued that if he is, this shows that psychoanalytic theory is not scientific. The sociologist John Thompson considered Ric\u0153ur's views about the role of language and meaning in psychoanalysis similar to those of Lacan. While Thompson praised Freud and Philosophy, he believed that Ric\u0153ur failed to resolve the \"question of the scientific status of psychoanalysis\" in the work. He and Ric\u0153ur both noted that Ric\u0153ur took a different approach to the issue in his essay \"The question of proof in Freud's psychoanalytic writings\", which was published in Hermeneutics and the Human Sciences (1981)."]}, {"page": "Critical hermeneutics", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Thompson (sociologist)#Critical hermeneutics"]}]}}
