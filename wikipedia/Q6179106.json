He played regularly for Bristol City during the 2006\u201307 season as the club were promoted to the Championship. During the 2007\u201308 season, Myrie-Williams was loaned out to Cheltenham Town and Tranmere Rovers respectively in order to gain more first-team experience. The following season, he was loaned out to Cheltenham Town again, before having further loan spells at Carlisle United and Hereford United.\nHe was released by Bristol City in May 2009, and joined Scottish Premier League club Dundee United on a free transfer a month later. After a season at Dundee United, Myrie-Williams moved to St Johnstone on a free transfer, making five appearances, before leaving the club in January 2011. He joined League Two club Oxford United in the same month, but the deal collapsed due to the fact that the player had already played for two clubs during the 2010\u201311 campaign. In July 2011, Myrie-Williams signed for League One club Stevenage on a free transfer.\nMyrie-Williams joined Port Vale on a six-week loan spell in November 2011, and following his release by Stevenage in May 2012, signed for the club on a permanent basis two months later. He helped Port Vale to secure promotion out of League Two during the 2012\u201313 season, and was also voted onto the PFA Team of the Year. He signed with Scunthorpe United in June 2014, and had a second spell on loan at Tranmere Rovers in January 2015. He joined Irish club Sligo Rovers in August 2015, and then signed for Newport County in June 2016. He signed with National League club Torquay United in September 2017, and then moved on to Hereford five months later. He helped Hereford to win the Southern League Premier Division title at the end of the 2017\u201318 season. Myrie-Williams left Hereford in October 2018 and spent the remainder of the 2018\u201319 season at National League South club Weston-super-Mare, before joining Gloucester City in June 2019.

He signed a contract to keep him at Vale Park until the end of the 2012\u201313 season, at which point his contract would be extended by 12 months if the \"Valiants\" were promoted. However Hughes later revealed that Adams was against the transfer but had been overruled by chairman Norman Smurthwaite. He marked his debut against the \"Gills\" with the winning goal that sent Vale to the top of the table. Being partnered with the country's leading goalscorer Tom Pope allowed Hughes space in front of goal vacated by opposition defenders attempting to double up on Pope. Hughes scored his first hat-trick for the \"Valiants\" in a 7\u20131 home victory over Burton Albion on 5 April, with two of his goals coming from the penalty spot as he took over from Jennison Myrie-Williams as the club's penalty taker. This performance won him a place on the League Two team of the week.

These proved to be inspired signings, as a Madjo hat-trick meant that the two Stevenage loanees scored a total of five goals between them in their first three games. However, in December he admitted that the club's off-the-field issues were a cause of concern for him and that he was being \"kept very much in the dark.\" Nominated for the Manager of the Month award for three wins in four December games, Adams revealed that due to the club's precarious financial position he was unable to sign any new players or even retain his loan players in the January transfer window \u2013 despite the chairman having previously told him to draw up a list of transfer targets. He did though manage to sign Chris Shuker and Paul Marshall on non-contract terms. He would also have signed Chris Birchall, however before the deal was finalised the Football League placed the club under a transfer embargo after a tax bill went unpaid. The club were unable to pay the player's wages in February. The club entered administration on 9 March, ending what had been a genuine push for promotion; talks between the administrator and Adams did not seem constructive, as Adams told the press that he was \"taking legal advice\". However, he stayed put, and steered the \"Valiants\" to a 12th-place finish; they would have been only 3 points off the play-offs had the club not entered administration. In May, he was linked with the vacant management position at Gillingham, with his friendship with \"Gills\" chairman Paul Scally cited in his favour in media reports.", "With the club still unable to sign new players due to administration in May 2012, Adams offered contracts to 16 of his players for the 2012\u201313 campaign. However, he lost four of his best players in Lee Collins, Anthony Griffith, Sean Rigg, and captain and top-scorer Marc Richards; all of whom signed big money contracts elsewhere, leaving Adams needing to rebuild the team largely from scratch. He duly signed midfielder Darren Murphy and winger Jennison Myrie-Williams from Stevenage, Colchester United attacker Ashley Vincent, Shrewsbury Town goalkeeper Chris Neal, Crewe Alexandra centre-back David Artell, and former Wales international Richard Duffy. He was named as Manager of the Month in September 2012, after his side beat Tranmere Rovers in the League Trophy and claimed 13 of a possible 18 points in the league to take the administration-hit club to second in the league. New owners took the club out of administration and allowed Adams to strengthen his squad in January by signing four experienced players: striker Lee Hughes, midfielder Chris Birchall, and centre-back Darren Purse. Other signings included left-back Daniel Jones, centre-back Liam Chilvers, striker Calvin Andrew, and midfielder Sean McAllister. However Vale slipped to five defeats in seven games, and Adams claimed that \"idiots\" in a \"certain section of the crowd\" were giving him \"personal\" abuse following the run of bad results and his decision to drop fan favourite Ryan Burge for disciplinary reasons. Vale managed to turn their form around and secure automatic promotion, finishing as the division's top-scorers as wingers Jennison Myrie-Williams and Ashley Vincent provided quality service to prolific striker Tom Pope throughout the campaign.", "In October 2014, Adams was appointed manager of Tranmere Rovers, who at the time were bottom of the Football League. After overseeing an upturn of results that saw the club move eight points above bottom-place Hartlepool United he was nominated for the League Two Manager of the Month award in December, with the judges saying that he \"has instilled a calm belief at Prenton Park that has won over players, supporters and directors alike\". In the January transfer window he signed a number of players who had played for him at Port Vale, including Jennison Myrie-Williams (on loan), Steve Jennings, Rob Taylor and Lee Molyneux; these players joined Chris Shuker, who Adams had signed in October to work as a player-coach (Guy Madjo also had a brief spell at the club over Christmas). He left his position as manager of Tranmere Rovers by mutual consent on 19 April, with the club still bottom of the Football League with two games left to play of the 2014\u201315 season."]}, {"page": "1988 in association football", "response": ["* 17 May: Jennison Myrie-Williams, English youth international"]}, {"page": "Louis Dodds", "response": ["Desperate to play as a striker in the 2012\u201313 season, he got his wish as he was played as a deep-lying striker in partnership with Tom Pope.

A brace in a 2\u20130 win over Exeter City at St James Park on 6 October took him to 11 goals in 13 games; this meant that, with the season only a quarter of the way in, the 27-year-old had reached his best ever goal tally. It also made him the fastest Vale player to reach double figures since Tom Nolan hit ten goals within the first eleven games of the 1933\u201334 season. Pope was quick to credit wing duo Jennison Myrie-Williams and Ashley Vincent for supplying him with the chances he needed to find the net so frequently. His seven goals in seven games saw him named as League Two Player of the Month for September 2012. Fans at Vale Park began to chant \"Feed the Pope and he will score\" throughout matches, and he picked up the nickname of the \"Sneyd Green Sniper / Assassin\", in reference to his hometown. A hat-trick in a 4\u20130 win over Bristol Rovers on 20 November meant that he became the quickest player to reach 20 goals (from the start of the season) in the club's Football League history. In February, he signed a new contract to keep him at the club until summer 2015. The next month he was named as League Two's Player of the Year after leading the division's scoring charts by five goals despite hitting an 11-game goal drought. After winning the award he claimed his third hat-trick of the season on 29 March, as Vale beat promotion rivals Cheltenham Town 3\u20132. Vale secured promotion with a third-place finish at the end of the season, and Pope finished on 33 goals in 51 games.
