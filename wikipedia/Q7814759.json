However, Saah's injury was probably the only negative point to a game which saw Torquay achieve their first League win over Devon rivals Plymouth Argyle since 1972.

The scoring was opened by Billy Bodin and it was to be his last contribution to the Gulls before he returned to Swindon Town following the completion of his loan deal.  Despite Martin Ling's best efforts, Robins boss Paolo Di Canio was reluctant to let Bodin return to Plainmoor, particularly with Torquay's recent good form making them potential rivals in the promotion race.
