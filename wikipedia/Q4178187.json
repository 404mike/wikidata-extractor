His work includes the cover artwork for Led Zeppelin's debut album, Led Zeppelin (1969), as well as that for Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon (1973) and Wish You Were Here (1975). As a designer/illustrator, Hardie has worked internationally.Since 1990, Hardie has taught postgraduate students of graphic design at the University of Brighton's Faculty of Arts. In 1994, Hardie became a member of the Alliance Graphique Internationale, for which he now serves as International Secretary. In 2012 Hardie was elected as Master of the Art Workers' Guild.

Hipgnosis had designed several of the band's previous albums, with controversial results; EMI had reacted with confusion when faced with the cover designs for Atom Heart Mother and Obscured by Clouds, as they had expected to see traditional designs which included lettering and words.  Designers Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell were able to ignore such criticism as they were employed by the band.  For The Dark Side of the Moon, Richard Wright instructed them to come up with something \"smarter, neater more classy\". The design was inspired by a photograph of a prism with a colour beam projected through it that Thorgerson had found in a photography book.", "The artwork was created by their associate, George Hardie.  Hipgnosis offered the band a choice of seven designs, but all four members agreed that the prism was by far the best. The final design depicts a glass prism dispersing light into colour. The design represents three elements: the band's stage lighting, the album lyrics, and Wright's request for a \"simple and bold\" design.  The spectrum of light continues through to the gatefold an idea that Waters came up with. Added shortly afterwards, the gatefold design also includes a visual representation of the heartbeat sound used throughout the album, and the back of the album cover contains Thorgerson's suggestion of another prism recombining the spectrum of light, facilitating interesting layouts of the sleeve in record shops. The light band emanating from the prism on the album cover has six colours, missing indigo compared to the traditional division of the spectrum into red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet.  Inside the sleeve were two posters and two pyramid-themed stickers.  One poster bore pictures of the band in concert, overlaid with scattered letters to form PINK FLOYD, and the other an infrared photograph of the Great Pyramids of Giza, created by Powell and Thorgerson.", "* George Hardie\u00a0\u2013 sleeve art, stickers art"]}, {"page": "Led Zeppelin (album)", "response": ["The album was recorded in September and October 1968 at Olympic Studios in London, shortly after the band's formation.

Storm Thorgerson had accompanied the band on their 1974 tour and had given serious thought to the meaning of the lyrics, eventually deciding that the songs were, in general, concerned with \"unfulfilled presence\", rather than Barrett's illness. This theme of absence was reflected in the ideas produced by his long hours spent brainstorming with the band. Thorgerson had noted that Roxy Music's Country Life was sold in an opaque green cellophane sleeve \u2013 censoring the cover image \u2013 and he copied the idea, concealing the artwork for Wish You Were Here in a black-coloured shrink-wrap (therefore making the album art \"absent\"). The concept behind \"Welcome to the Machine\" and \"Have a Cigar\" suggested the use of a handshake (an often empty gesture), and George Hardie designed a sticker containing the album's logo of two mechanical hands engaged in a handshake, to be placed on the opaque sleeve (the mechanical handshake logo would also appear on the labels of the vinyl album this time in a black and blue background).", "* George Hardie\u00a0\u2013 graphics"]}, {"page": "The Complete Studio Recordings (Led Zeppelin album)", "response": ["*George Hardie\u00a0\u2013 cover design"]}, {"page": "The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway", "response": ["Hipgnosis designed the album's artwork.
