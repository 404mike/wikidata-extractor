Publishers of some other street newspapers, especially in the United States, have criticised it for being overly \"commercial\" and having a flashy design. According to these critics, street newspapers ought to focus on covering political and social issues that affect the homeless, rather than emulating mainstream newspapers to generate a profit. Publishers of some smaller papers, such as Making Change in Santa Monica, California, said they felt threatened when The Big Issue began to publish in their area. Other papers have also criticised The Big Issue for its professional production and limited participation by homeless individuals in writing and producing the newspaper.  Others, however, have stated that The Big Issue uses a successful business model to generate a profit to benefit the homeless, and its founder John Bird has said that it is \"possible to be both profitable and ethically correct\".", "*\"Ethical Entrepreneurs\" John Bird founder of The Big Issue, talks about his early life and entrepreneurial journey"]}, {"page": "House of Lords Appointments Commission", "response": ["*John Bird MBE"]}, {"page": "Andrew Jaspan", "response": ["In 1993 he was appointed editor of The Scotsman but six months later was appointed by the Guardian Media Group as editor of The Observer.
