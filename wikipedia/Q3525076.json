William Wentworth duly succeeded to the estates under the settlement, and by his will dated 1775Hancock, 1897, pp. 22\u20134 resettled the estates on his own son Frederick Thomas Wentworth, 3rd Earl of Strafford (1732\u20131799), with remainder on failure of his issue, to the 3rd Earl's sister Augusta Anne Wentworth (died 1802), wife of John Hatfeild Kaye (1731\u20131804) of Hatfeild Hall, Stanley, West Yorkshire, and on failure of issue from both, (which was the event) to Sir Thomas Dyke Acland, 7th Baronet (1723\u20131785) and his issue. Following the death of Augusta Anne Kaye in 1802 without issue, Trerice and the other former Arundell estates passed to Sir Thomas Dyke Acland, 10th Baronet (1787\u20131871), grandson of the 7th Baronet.The sequence of settlements and resettlements is clearly described by Hancock, 1897, pp. 22\u20134: \"The last Baron Arundell married in June, 1722, Elizabeth, daughter of Sir William Wentworth, of Wakefield, Yorkshire, and sister of Thomas Wentworth, who, in 1711, was created earl of Strafford. It appears that on his marriage Lord Arundell settled all his manors in default of his own issue on his wife's nephew, William Wentworth of Henbury, in the parish of Sturminster Marshall, Dorset, in tail. Lord Arundell died in August, 1768, aged 66, leaving no issue. The manors of Selworthy and Luccombe then devolved on the said William Wentworth, who barred his entail by recoveries suffered in Hilary Term, 9 Geo. Ill, 1769. Mr. Wentworth by his will, dated April 14, 1775, devised all his estates in Dorset, Somerset, Devon, and Cornwall, to his wife Susanna Wentworth, for her life, with remainder to his only son, Frederick Thomas Wentworth, for his life, with remainder to his (the said Frederick Thomas) first son and other sons in tail male, with remainder to his daughters in tail, with remainder to the testator's only daughter, Augusta Ann Kaye, then the wife of John Hatfield Kaye, for her life, with remainder to her first and other sons in tail male, with remainder to her daughters in tail; and subject thereto he devised the manors of Selworthy and East Luccombe (in Somerset), Stockley Luccombe (in Devon), and Degembris, Goviley, Thurlbeer, Ebbingford, otherwise Efford, Penshayes, and the barton of Garrows (in Cornwall), which manors and farms had formed the estates of the Arundells of Trerice, to Sir Thomas Dyke Acland, the seventh baronet, and he devised the \" capital \" messuages and farms of Henbury and Loscombe in Dorsetshire to his own right heirs. William Wentworth died early in the year 1776, and on the 22 June 1776, his will was proved by his son, Frederick Thomas, in the Prerogative Court of Canterbury. His widow, Susanna, died in August, 1784, and was buried at Sturminster Marshall. The said Frederick Thomas, on the death of William, second earl of Strafford, of the creation of 1711, succeeded to the earldom. He married Elizabeth Gould, and died without issue on the 5 April 1799, and was buried at Sturminster Marshall. Mrs. Kaye died without issue on the 23 April 1802, and was buried in the parish church of Wakefield. On her death, the late Sir Thomas Acland, tenth baronet, and the grandson of the seventh baronet, entered into possession of the estates devised to the latter by William Wentworth\"", "In 1802, Trerice and other estates including Ebbingford Manor (Efford) in Stratton, near Bude in Cornwall, and Selworthy and Luccombe in Somerset, passed to Sir Thomas Dyke Acland, 10th Baronet (1787\u20131871), of Killerton in Devon and Holnicote in Somerset.Acland, Anne.

Above it is Efford Down, on which in 1835 the 10th Baronet built the surviving octagonal tower known as the \"Storm Tower\", whose sides face the cardinal and sub-cardinal points of the compass. It was designed by George Wightwick, inspired by the Tower of the Winds in Athens, and is believed to have served as a refuge for coastguards. In 1826 the 10th Baronet also built at Bude the \"Falcon Hotel\", named after the Acland crest of a falcon perched on a man's gloved hand. The Cornish estates were however difficult to manage economically as they were so far from Killerton, near Exeter.Acland, Anne. A Devon Family: The Story of the Aclands. London and Chichester: Phillimore, 1981, pp. 61, 139 Shortly before 1844 the 10th Baronet restored the Great Hall and the Chamber at Trerice and in 1844 the local newspaper reported \"Sir T. D. Acland held his Baronial Court at Trerice ... about 150 of his tenantry dined with the worthy Baronet in the noble Hall at Trerice, which has recently been restored to its original condition, and is a very fine specimen of the Elizabethan age\". The Aclands later leased Trerice with 500 acres to the Tremaine family, who farmed the estate with a staff of twelve men, four women and four boys. In 1915 Trerice was sold by the 10th baronet's grandson Sir Thomas Dyke Acland, 12th Baronet (1842\u20131919)Acland, Anne. A Devon Family: The Story of the Aclands.
