He had intended to complete work on the Tintin trilogy before resuming work on Doctor Who, but delays caused by the intervening 2007\u20132008 Writers Guild of America strike meant he could only submit part of a script for the first film.

Dubbed the \"Great Correspondence\" by Davies and Cook, The Writer's Tale covers a period between February 2007 and March 2008 and explores his writing processes and the development of his scripts for the fourth series of Doctor Who: \"Voyage of the Damned\", \"Partners in Crime\", \"Midnight\", \"Turn Left\", \"The Stolen Earth\", and \"Journey's End\". The book's first chapter focuses on Cook's \"big questions\" on Davies' writing style, character development\u2014he used the Doctor Who character Donna Noble (Catherine Tate) and the Skins character Tony Stonem (Nicholas Hoult) as contrasting examples\u2014, how he formulated ideas for stories, and the question \"why do you write?\". After several weeks, Cook assumes an unofficial advisory role to the scriptwriting and the development of the series. The book's epilogue consists of a short exchange between Davies and Cook: Cook changes from his role as \"Invisible Ben\" to \"Visible Ben\" and strongly advises to vastly alter the denouement to \"Journey's End\" from a cliffhanger which led into \"The Next Doctor\"\u2014which had occurred in the previous three series finales, \"The Parting of the Ways\", \"Doomsday\", and \"Last of the Time Lords\"\u2014to a melancholy ending that showed the Doctor alone in the TARDIS.

They are critical of some elements of the first series, such as the believability of Tony's character, or episode 6 which is described as \"Carry On Russia\", but give high praise to the second series as a whole, highlighting the death of Sid's dad as a superb moment, and calling the finale \"perfect\". Davies, creator of the award-winning Queer as Folk, also praised the handling of the show's homosexuality-related storylines, saying that he knew a boy very like Maxxie in the 1980s.Russell T Davies and Benjamin Cook, Doctor Who: The Writer's Tale (BBC Books, 2008), passim The Age called it a \"refreshing, entertaining and worthy series\" and wrote it was \"compulsory viewing for parents of teenagers as much as for teens.\" Similarly, the \"Naomily\" storyline of Series 3 and 4 proved popular with lesbian viewers; a poll conducted by American lesbian's' media website AfterEllen.com ranked Naomi and Emily as the top two fictional lesbian and bisexual characters."]}, {"page": "Astrid Peth", "response": ["In August 2007, screenwriter and executive producer Russell T Davies announced that Astrid Peth would be the next companion, following the positive reception towards Martha Jones,  (played by Freema Agyeman). Astrid's surname, Peth, was confirmed in the Christmas edition of Radio Times. Davies has stated that the character was always going to be a \"one-off\" even before Minogue was cast and that Astrid would demonstrate \"a whole new take\u00a0\u2013 again\u00a0\u2013 on what a companion can be\". The name Astrid Peth generated some speculation before the episode's broadcast over the findings that Astrid is an anagram of TARDIS, and that Peth means thing in Welsh. However, the episode established no such connection. On Doctor Who Confidential, Minogue describes Astrid as a \"dreamer\" and that meeting with the Doctor rekindles Astrid's desire to explore. Later in his book A Writer's Tale Davies discussed with co-author Benjamin Cook how he had originally named the character \"Peth\" in a treatment but it bugged him, he later renamed her to \"Astrid\" giving the reason that it \"...sounds more spacey, more like a futuristing  Doctor's companion\"."]}, {"page": "Silence in the Library", "response": ["For the role of River Song, whom executive producer Russell T Davies described as \"sort of the Doctor's wife\", the production sought to cast Kate Winslet.
