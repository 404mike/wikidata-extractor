He lived until the age of eight in a small village called Bredenbeck on the edge of the Deister wood. His debut full-length album Am Deister was named after this rural location and many of its tracks were inspired by his childhood adventures. The family moved to Ashbourne, Derbyshire and while at sixth form at Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School that he formed a short-lived band with his friends James Rutledge and Jimmy Wright. He then studied maths at the University of Manchester. After completing his degree in June 1999, Tyack began teacher training but soon realised it was not the right career for him.  ", "Having no luck in finding bandmates for a surf band, he started recording alone on a four-track, mainly playing bass guitar. Having heard Badly Drawn Boy's \"EP1\" he started taking his tapes to Andy Votel who then worked at Fat City Records. After several months and numerous demo tapes, Votel decided to sign him to the fledgling Twisted Nerve Records, which had originally been set up in 1997 merely to release Badly Drawn Boy's recordings. His first release was on Twisted Nerve compilation All Oar Nothing and his recording moniker was Dakota Oak. The band Mum and Dad and the electronic artist Sirconical joined the label at the same time and the Twisted Nerve roster began putting on live shows and DJ sets to promote the artists. Tyack felt he needed a band to play his music live, so he formed Dakota Oak Trio with Jimmy Wright and James Rutledge, but as they developed a rockier sound of their own with all three band members writing music, this became a band in its own right and was renamed D.O.T. to separate it from Tyack's solo act. Tyack played drums with D.O.T. but he played all instruments on his solo releases. D.O.T. also signed to Twisted Nerve and their first release was a rocking instrumental single called \"Say Your Prayers\", released in 2000. Dakota Oak, his solo act, released Kaleidoscope, a 10\" vinyl mini album in April 1999, which received positive reviews."]}, {"page": "Edward Laning", "response": ["  He painted murals for the Works Progress Administration during the Great Depression as well as a post office mural in Rockingham, North Carolina (1937).Park, Marlene and Gerald E.

The Noda mural was promptly rejected because Negro cotton pickers were shown wearing turtlenecked sweaters and creased trousers, because the creature pulling a poor blackamoor's farm cart seemed to be a full-blooded Percheron stallion.
