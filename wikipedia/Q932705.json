He is, statistically, the highest ranking Scottish sprinter in history, above 1980 Olympic 100m champion Alan Wells. He was part of the UK relay team which won a silver medal at the 1972 Munich Summer Olympics. Anabolic steroids were banned from athletics in 1976, and Jenkins has said that he began using steroids around then; although his times slowed from this point due in part to his increased propensity for injury. He was a finalist in the 1976 and 1980 Olympics 400m. After a 10 month period in prison in the 1980s for steroid trafficking, Jenkins has subsequently had a successful business career in the United States. He is the brother of Roger Jenkins, also formerly an international athlete, who became one of the UK's highest paid bankers.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Allan Wells", "response": ["In the 1978 season his times and victories continued to improve, he clocked a new British record at Gateshead 10.29, beating Don Quarrie and James Sanford, he also won the UK 100/200 Championships.
