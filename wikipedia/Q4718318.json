The Independent; London (UK) 11 June 1994.", "In November 1963, Dell Publishing issued a novelization of the screenplay by critic, author and war veteran Milton Shulman. The book's presentation is idiosyncratic, as it is both unabashedly a tie-in edition, yet seems to cautiously sidestep labeling itself an adaptation of the script per se (though within Shulman's sensitively internalized retelling, it is quite faithful to the film's dialogue and structure). Both the cover and title page proclaim \"Carl Foreman's The Victors\" under which the byline is \"by Milton Shulman, based on The Human Kind by Alexander Baron.\" bypassing mention of the actual screenplay. It is unknown whether Dell bid for the publishing rights and commissioned the novelization, or if Foreman engineered its publication. The latter would seem the more likely, given Foreman's possessive over-the-title billing, and that the short story collection providing the source of the screenplay is itself an established work of fiction. What does seem clear is that Baron himself was approached to write the novelization, and that he declined\u2014possibly because, with the Americanization of the characters, he felt the novel's authorship should have a genuinely American voice\u2014but nonetheless wanted to select the author and supervise. That he did so can be extrapolated from the copyright registration: The copyright is assigned to Baron, with a notation that he engaged Shulman to write the book as a work for hire. The resultant novelization sold well enough to earn at least a second print run, indicated on that identical edition's copyright page, issued in January 1964."]}, {"page": "List of American films of 1963", "response": ["|The Victors||Carl Foreman ||George Peppard, George Hamilton, Vince Edwards, Romy Schneider, Elke Sommer, Jeanne Moreau  ||War || Columbia; from Alexander Baron story"]}, {"page": "Sense and Sensibility (1981 TV series)", "response": ["Sense and Sensibility is a 1981 BBC television adaptation of Jane Austen's 1811 novel.
