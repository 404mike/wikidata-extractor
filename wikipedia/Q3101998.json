Voelcker before moving to India. Mann joined as Chief Scientific Officer of Indian Tea Association in 1900 and extensively traveled in Assam and North East India for scientific research on early tea plantations. He was instrumental in setting up the world's first tea research institute at Tocklai, Jorhat, Assam (India) known as the Tocklai Experimental Station and later renamed as the Tocklai Tea Research Institute. Mann contributed to the studies on tea pests and disease, soils, manuring, and agricultural practices. He resigned from Indian Tea Association in June 1907 and joined as principal of the Agricultural College at Poona while also serving as chemist to the Government of Bombay. He worked on the second edition of a work on the pests and diseases of tea in collaboration with Sir George Watt and served as editor for the second and third editions of the Handbook of Indian Agriculture.

He was educated at Beaumont College and went to work in the indigo industry in India in 1881 becoming a part owner of the Dalsing Sarai Indigo Concern in Bihar. He conducted experiments to introduce rhea (Boehmeria nivea) cultivation in India and calculated the profitability of processing and exporting the fibre to Europe. His research was commended by Sir John Woodburn in 1902. In 1800 he was involved in research on indigo, taking out a patent for improved indigo processing. In 1898 some Bihar indigo farmers formed an Indigo Improvement Syndicate (IIS) with the aims of conducting experiments. In 1901 Bihar Indigo Planters Association (BIPA) with their chemist Christopher Rawson and the IIS combined to work on experiments on the recommendation of Sir George Watt. Coventry worked with Begg, Dunlop and Company who hired a chemist E.A. Hancock and tried testing better indigo species (including Indigofera arrecta, experiments on which were also made at Calcutta by David Prain) and varieties from around the world. After Hancock left, the station at Dalsingserai hired Hugh Martin-Leake and chemist William P. Bloxam. By 1903 the BIPA stopped funding the project but IIS continued to support it and a fresh government grant was made in 1903 leading to a research station at Peeprah. Here Cyril Bergtheil was recruited. The research work was highly regarded by several officials including James Mollison, Denzil Ibbetson, and David Prain. Mollison who became the first Inspector General of Agriculture recommended that the Dalsingserai team be absorbed into the first agricultural science establishment formed at Pusa. Coventry was appointed principal of the Agricultural College at Pusa in 1904. The institution later became the Imperial Agricultural Research Institute. He was appointed a Companion, Order of the Indian Empire on 14th June 1912 and served as an advisor on agriculture to the government until 1916."]}]}}
