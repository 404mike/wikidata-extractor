She began her studies as a pianist, but switched to violin at the Music Academy in Budapest when Jen\u0151 Hubay accepted her as a student. After concert tours of Europe and America as a soloist and chamber musician she settled in London. She formed a notable chamber trio with the Spanish cellist Pablo Casals and the Australian pianist Frederick Septimus Kelly, with whom she was in love, even referring to him as her \"fianc\u00e9\". On memorable occasions, she and B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k gave sonata recitals together in London and Paris. His two sonatas for violin and piano were dedicated to her; Jelly and Bart\u00f3k presented them in London in March 1922 (No. 1) and May 1923 (No. 2).She was an excellent interpreter of Classical, Romantic and modern music. After d'Aranyi had, at his request, played \"gypsy\" violin music to him one evening, Maurice Ravel dedicated his popular violin-and-piano composition Tzigane to her. Ralph Vaughan Williams dedicated his Concerto Accademico to her. Gustav Holst's Double Concerto for Two Violins was written for Jelly and Adila.  The D'Aranyi String Quartet is named after her.\nShe played a curious role in the emergence and 1937 world premiere of Robert Schumann's Violin Concerto. On the basis of messages she received at a 1933 s\u00e9ance, allegedly from Schumann himself, about this concerto of which she had never previously heard, she claimed the right to perform it publicly for the first time. That was not to be, but she did perform it at the London premiere.\nFrom her 20s, Jelly d'Aranyi was a lifelong friend of Georgie Hyde-Lees, the wife of W. B. Yeats.\nShe died in Florence in 1966 aged 72.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hungary", "response": ["* Violists: Joseph Joachim, Leopold Auer, Jen\u0151 Hubay, Jelly d'Ar\u00e1nyi, Joseph Szigeti, S\u00e1ndor V\u00e9gh, Emil Telmanyi, Ede Zathurecky, Zsigmondy, Franz von Vecsey, Zolt\u00e1n Sz\u00e9kely, Tibor Varga and newcomers Antal Szalai, Vilmos Szabadi, Krist\u00f3f Bar\u00e1ti (b. 79) and others."]}, {"page": "Maurice Ravel", "response": ["Ravel's four chamber works composed after the First World War are the Sonata for Violin and Cello (1920\u201322), the \"Berceuse sur le nom de Gabriel Faur\u00e9\" for violin and piano (1922), the chamber original of Tzigane for violin and piano (1924) and finally the Violin Sonata (1923\u201327).

Casals was close friends with composer Donald Tovey, who wrote his Sonata for two cellos for the pair. On visiting the couple to present the work in 1912, an unknown event occurred between Suggia and Tovey which caused strain on the relationship between Suggia and Casals, and the friendship between Tovey and Casals.
