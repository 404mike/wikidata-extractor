They soon opened the scoring, James Higgins reacting to a shot parried by the goalkeeper, but by half time the home team had regained the lead. On change of ends, Newton Heath had much of the play, and eventually increased their lead through a Matthew Gillespie tap-in. The Manchester club's goalkeeper had no shot to save in the second half.\"Newton Heath v. Small Heath\". Manchester Guardian: p.3. 11 April 1898.
