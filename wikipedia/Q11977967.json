In January 2016, CBS ordered a pilot under the working title Drew, and that the character would be a non-Caucasian New York City police detective in her thirties. The pilot, written by Joan Rater and Tony Phelan, revolved around Nancy investigating the death of Bess Marvin, and reentering the NYPD after taking leave. Sarah Shahi was cast as Nancy Drew, with Vanessa Ferlito as George Fayne, Anthony Edwards as Carson Drew, Steve Kazee as Ned Nickerson, and Debra Monk as Hannah Gruen. The pilot was shot in location in New York City during March 2016, and was directed by James Strong. During this time, Phelan and Rater had another pilot, Doubt, which many television reporters often placed in competition for a series order with Drew. On May 14, 2016, it was announced that CBS decided to order Doubt, and pass on the Drew pilot, so CBS Studios could shop it to other networks for series consideration, though none did."]}, {"page": "Rome, Georgia", "response": ["|A television film and possible ABC series pilot, the film was produced by Loucas George and directed by James Strong.

The film gained generally good reviews, especially for its evocation of the period and for Tennant's acting, and was nominated at the Prix Europa 2011 Awards as \"Best European TV Production\". It was, however, condemned by Sandy Busby, the son of Matt Busby, who said he thought the film was \"very poorly done\", and strongly criticised the film's portrayal of his father."]}, {"page": "Clint Mansell", "response": ["|James Strong"]}, {"page": "List of film and television directors", "response": ["*James Strong"]}, {"page": "Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation", "response": ["| Doctor Who: \"Planet of the Dead\" || James Strong (director), Russell T Davies (screenplay), Gareth Roberts (screenplay) || BBC Cymru Wales"]}, {"page": "James Strong", "response": ["James Strong may refer to:", "* James Strong (college president) (1833\u20131913), American theologian and the first president of Carleton College in Minnesota", "* James Strong (director), British television director and writer", "* James Strong (theologian) (1822\u20131894), American Methodist biblical scholar and educator, creator of Strong's Concordance and co-author of McClintock and Strong's Cyclopaedia", "* James Strong (U.S. politician) (1783\u20131847), United States Representative from New York", "* James Strong (Australian businessman) (1944\u20132013), Australian businessman, CEO of Qantas", "* James Stronge (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "The Satan Pit", "response": ["This episode and \"The Impossible Planet\" were released in the UK, together with \"Love & Monsters\", as a basic DVD with no special features on 7 August 2006.

The episode was filmed as part of the third production block of the first series, along with eighth episode \"They Keep Killing Suzie\". Director James Strong wanted to film the episode in a sort of real time format. Filming largely took place at the Upper Boat Studios outside Pontypridd, where the Torchwood Hub set is located. The scene where Jack threatens to kill Ianto if he does not kill Lisa was the first scene to be shot. The flashback scene where Ianto finds a half-converted Lisa in Canary Wharf took a full day to film; it was originally supposed to take only a few hours, but the camera failed to record the scene. It was replaced, but the second camera failed to record also. Eve Myles and Burn Gorman were both trained how to handle guns and a torch like a \"secret agent.\" Strong noted that they both held the gun and torch in each hand like professionals.", "The producers noted there were a history of \"sexy, pneumatic, hydraulic women\" in science fiction, and wanted to \"tap into that.\" To make the cyberwoman costume, the props department wanted to make it as \"sexy\" as they can. Director James Strong wanted to make the costume look \"amazing,\" but threatening and scary as well. There were discussions about which parts of Lisa would be human, and which parts would be cyborg. Made out of rubber, it was custom made to fit Chikezie as much as possible. It took an entire day for the actress to get her body cast. After the costume was completed, it would take an hour to apply each morning, and an hour to remove by lunch break. Chikezie found it difficult to hear anything from the helmet while shooting scenes. It was also uncomfortable for her, but the producers noted she remained stoic throughout filming."]}, {"page": "Voyage of the Damned (Doctor Who)", "response": ["\"Voyage of the Damned\" is an episode of the British science fiction television programme Doctor Who.
