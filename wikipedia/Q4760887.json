His goals helped ensure the club's promotion from the Second Division, and in 1985\u201386, his first full season, he was the club's leading scorer, but with only nine goals for a side which failed to avoid relegation. In 1987, he joined Sheffield United on loan whilst recovering from injury, and then moved to Blackburn Rovers, where he scored 25 goals in two seasons, followed by Watford between 1990 and 1992. A loan spell at Division Three Bolton Wanderers was cut short after one game when Kennedy sustained a back injury. In 1992\u201393 he joined Division Two club Brighton & Hove Albion, spending two seasons there before finishing his Football League career at Gillingham. Still only 30 years of age, Kennedy moved to Hong Kong with Sing Tao before moving to Northern Ireland with Portadown.\nFrom 2005 Kennedy coached within the Rangers Soccer Schools programme both at home and North America. He scouted and began the career of Cammy Palmer when he was playing at Whitby Bay Soccer Club.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Andy Kennedy", "response": ["Andy Kennedy may refer to:", "* Andy Kennedy (footballer, born 1897) (1897\u20131963), Northern Ireland football player, played for Arsenal", "* Andy Kennedy (footballer, born 1964), Scottish professional footballer, played for Rangers, Birmingham City Blackburn Rovers and others", "* Andy Kennedy (Australian footballer) (1883\u20131946), Australian rules footballer", "* Andy Kennedy (basketball) (born 1968), American basketball coach"]}, {"page": "Sing Tao SC", "response": ["* Andy Kennedy"]}, {"page": "1983\u201384 Rangers F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\" | Andy Kennedy"]}, {"page": "1982\u201383 Rangers F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\" | Andy Kennedy"]}, {"page": "1990 Football League Second Division play-off Final", "response": ["Swindon Town faced Blackburn Rovers in the other play-off semi-final and the first leg was played at Ewood Park in Blackburn on 13 May 1990.
