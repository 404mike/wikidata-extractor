She was the creator of a beer recipe which became the basis for founding Canada's oldest independent brewery, Moosehead Brewery. Though she was credited with running the operation as well as acting as chief brewer, the business was incorporated in the name of her husband and sons. When her husband died, the partners sold their interests to a manager, whom Oland was able to buy out eight years later. She continued running the business until her death.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Moosehead Breweries", "response": ["In 1865, Susannah Oland moved from England to Nova Scotia, Canada. With her husband John and nine other employees, Susannah opened The Army and Navy Brewery in 1867, a name that came after their most appreciative customers. After John Oland's untimely death in 1870, the brewery changed its name to  S. Oland, Sons and Co. Over the next eight years, the brewery faced two fires, but recovered after each. In 1886, Susannah Oland died, and the company went to her two sons, Conrad and George. With the approach of the 20th century, the company changed its name to the Maritime Brewing & Malting Co. It faced hard times once again when the Halifax Explosion of 1917 killed Conrad Oland and destroyed the brewery. A year later, George Oland and his sons moved to Halifax and bought another brewery. In 1928, George bought a second, larger brewery in the city of Saint John, New Brunswick, site of the present day facility."]}, {"page": "Beer in Canada", "response": ["After the fall of New France, the numerous British soldiers in the Canadian British colonies in the eighteenth century was a benefit to breweries since the troops were each entitled to six pints of beer per day. Most preferred ales and other heavy beers, not lager. Another important base of customers was the British Loyalists that immigrated from the newly independent United States to Canada. During those centuries and into the nineteenth, a number of commercial brewers thrived, including some that became the staple of the Canadian industry: John Molson founded a brewery in Montreal in 1786, Alexander Keith in Halifax in 1820, Thomas Carling in London in 1840, John Kinder Labatt in 1847, also in London, Susannah Oland in Halifax in 1867, and Eugene O'Keefe in Toronto in 1891. The Upper Canada government issued a patent on July 6, 1842, to George Riley of Kingston, Upper Canada for \"an improved method of brewing ale, beer, porter, and other malt liquors.\" Molson's is the oldest surviving Canadian brewing enterprise."]}, {"page": "Women in brewing", "response": ["In many Western societies, brewing has been seen as a \"man's domain\"; however, ethnographic studies and archaeological records indicate that brewing alcohol was primarily an activity engaged in by women, until the industrialization of brewing began. In some areas, the tradition arose because brewing was a by-product of gathering, while in others, it fell within the domain of baking. From the 18th century onwards, women were increasingly barred from the business of brewing, except as barmaids or \"publicans\", licensees running pubs. By the 19th century, few women were employed in brewing with the exception of labor for auxiliary functions, such as bottling and secretarial posts. In the 20th century, women began to work in a limited capacity in laboratories, but aside from a few exceptions such as Susannah Oland in Canada, women were excluded from directing brewing operations. Professional female brewers in Western society before the trade became \"masculinized\", were referred to as \"brewsters\".", "In Canada, Susannah Oland, an Englishwoman who immigrated to Canada in 1865, and her husband established a popular brewery called the Navy and Army Brewery. After her husband died, Oland established a brewery of her own, though she concealed her gender by naming the business \"S. Oland Sons and Company,\" using her initials to hide the fact that she was a woman. She was the creator of a beer recipe which became the basis for founding Canada's oldest independent brewery, Moosehead Brewery."]}]}}
