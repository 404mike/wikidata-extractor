The situation caused some political debate as the UN troops had been given orders only to \"deter attacks\" and did not have a mandate or adequate equipment to fully defend the mainly Muslim town of Gora\u017ede, which was initially declared \"safe\" by the UN, thus rendering them exposed when armed members of the Army of Republika Srpska (Bosnian Serb Army) ignored the NATO ultimatum and attacked the town without warning. The regiment managed to hold off the Bosnian Serbs until they were forced to retreat into bunkers \u2013 those who did not make it quickly enough were taken hostage \u2013 and remained trapped underground while BiH Army reinforcements arrived and fought back. The commanding officer, Lt Col Jonathon Riley (later promoted to Lieutenant General), broke with protocol and directly reported to then Prime Minister John Major about the situation over the phone while in the bunker. All the men were eventually safely rescued. An unprecedented five gallantry awards, seven mentions in despatches and two Queen's Commendations for Valuable Service were awarded to the regiment. Although the incident was largely unreported at that time, the regiment was credited in hindsight by observers for saving the town from a possible genocide\u2014after failing to take Gora\u017ede, the Bosnian Serbs continued south to Srebrenica, where they would massacre over 8,000 Bosniaks."]}, {"page": "Royal Armouries", "response": ["* Lieutenant-General Jonathon Riley, September 2009 \u2013 November 2012"]}, {"page": "Operation Telic order of battle", "response": ["*GOC Multi-National Division (South-East): Major General Jonathon Riley (January 2005 to April 2005)"]}, {"page": "List of people associated with University College London", "response": ["* Lieutenant-General Jonathon Riley (Geography), former Master of the Royal Armouries (2009-2012) and Deputy Commander of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (2008-2009)"]}, {"page": "Kingston Grammar School", "response": ["* Jonathon Riley \u2014 Director General and Master of the Armouries"]}, {"page": "Sara Edwards", "response": ["Sara Edwards was 42 when she and her former husband, military historian Lieutenant General Jonathon Riley of the Royal Welch Fusiliers, became the parents of a daughter, born in Cardiff, 19 March 2006.
