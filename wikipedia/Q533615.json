Former Liverpool and England defender Mark Wright was given the manager's job, but resigned in late November, after being accused of making racist remarks to referee Joe Ross. Wright's successor, Ian Atkins, was unable to make an immediate impact and Oxford finished in 21st position in the league, at the time their lowest-ever league position. United missed out on the play-off places the following season, by one place and one point. Fifteen wins at the start of the 2003\u201304 season saw Oxford top of the table at the end of January. However, Ian Atkins was sacked in March after agreeing to take charge at rivals Bristol Rovers. His replacement, Graham Rix, could only manage a ninth-place finish at the end of the season, and was sacked the following November. Oxford replaced him with Argentine Ram\u00f3n D\u00edaz, who managed the team to a mid-table finish. Diaz and his team of assistants left the club at the beginning of May 2005, after being banned from the ground by the chairman following failed negotiations. During his time at the club, Diaz brought in a number of South American players including his own sons, and Juan Pablo Raponi.Brodetsky p.344. Ex-England midfielder and former West Bromwich Albion manager Brian Talbot signed a two-year contract to replace Rix. Talbot found little success and was sacked in March 2006, with the club in 22nd place. He was replaced by youth team coach Darren Patterson."]}, {"page": "Portsmouth F.C.", "response": ["In the 2000\u201301 season, Pulis was put on leave and replaced by Portsmouth player, Steve Claridge in a player-manager role.  On 23 February 2001, Graham Rix took over from Claridge. Portsmouth escaped relegation on the last day of the 2000\u201301 season when they won their final game and Huddersfield Town lost theirs, keeping Portsmouth up at their expense. During the summer break, former West Ham United manager Harry Redknapp was appointed director of football by Mandaric."]}, {"page": "2001\u201302 in English football", "response": ["* 25 March - Director of Football Harry Redknapp takes over at Portsmouth, replacing Graham Rix (sacked)"]}, {"page": "Harry Redknapp", "response": ["However, after the club's poor form, he replaced manager Graham Rix in March 2002. Redknapp managed the club to the Division One title in the 2002\u201303 season, gaining promotion to the Premier League, replacing his former club West Ham."]}, {"page": "Peter Crouch", "response": ["Relegation meant that QPR had to sell many of their best players to support their diminished finances, and Portsmouth bought Crouch for \u00a31.5\u00a0million. Crouch scored 18 league goals in 37 starts for Portsmouth during the 2001\u201302 season and was tipped by manager Graham Rix to have a big future in the game."]}, {"page": "Linvoy Primus", "response": ["After friendly matches with Dorchester Town and Exeter City, Primus signed a contract with Portsmouth although he was disappointed with the low wages in comparison to other players. He did not get his Portsmouth career off to a good start, scoring an own goal on his debut away at Sheffield United. Pulis was sacked early on in the 2000\u201301 season after a poor start and was replaced by fans' favourite Steve Claridge. Portsmouth were still near the relegation zone after a poor run of form that also saw Primus being sent off for the first time in his career for a foul on Fulham's Louis Saha. Gilmore's groin ruled him out of action for five months from November of that season, during which Claridge was replaced by Graham Rix, this was after Primus formed a partnership with Jamaican international Darren Moore. After a defeat to Crystal Palace (which Primus described as the \"lowest point of [his] career\"), Portsmouth needed a victory over Barnsley to stay in Division One and they duly won 3\u20130 with Huddersfield being relegated after their final day defeat. After the conclusion of the season, Primus fell out with Rix as he was unsure about whether Rix thought he had a future at the club."]}, {"page": "Lewis Buxton", "response": ["A promising young defender, after working his way up through the Portsmouth youth ranks, Buxton made his first team debut at the beginning of the 2001\u201302 season, aged 17, in a 1\u20130 win at Stockport County. He was soon a regular in Graham Rix's squad."]}, {"page": "David O'Leary", "response": ["A calm and collected central defender, O'Leary was noted for his good positioning and elegant style of play. He won his first major honour with Arsenal when he played in their 3\u20132 win over Manchester United in the 1979 FA Cup Final. He also played in the 1978 and 1980 Cup finals, and the 1980 Cup Winners' Cup final, all of which Arsenal lost. In 1982, O'Leary became club captain, but relinquished it to Graham Rix 18 months later."]}, {"page": "Gary O'Neil", "response": ["O'Neil was born in Beckenham, London. Tony Pulis gave O'Neil his Portsmouth debut as a 16-year-old on 29 January 2000 at home to Barnsley in the First Division, but kept him out of the spotlight for the rest of the season. The following year both Pulis and his successor Steve Claridge used O'Neil sparingly but Portsmouth's third manager of a disastrous season, Graham Rix, made O'Neil a starter for the final five matches of the season. Portsmouth went into the final game against Barnsley needing to win to have any chance of avoiding relegation to what was then the Second Division. They won the match 3\u20130 and survived, with O'Neil scoring the second goal, his first in professional football."]}]}}
