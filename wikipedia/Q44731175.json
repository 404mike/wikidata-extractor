He gained this victory despite being affected by sickness about 38 kilometres into the race. This sickness, apparently food-related, also affected his fellow British competitors Tebbs Lloyd Johnson and Joe Hopkins."]}, {"page": "Don Fullmer", "response": ["In 1964 he beat Jimmy Ellis, who later went on to win the World Boxing Association version of the heavyweight championship. The win against Ellis began a winning streak for Fullmer and he went on to defeat  Griffith and Archer in rematches. This streak ended when he lost to Nino Benvenuti in Rome in 1966. Benvenuti went on to win the middleweight title, and after Fullmer beat Carl \"Bobo\" Olson he fought a rematch with Benvenuti for the title in 1968. He knocked the Italian down but lost a fifteen-round unanimous decision. While never a recognized world champion, Fullmer did win a bout billed as for the \"World Junior Light Heavyweight Championship\" when he defeated Joe Hopkins in 1967. This title was the precursor to the current super middleweight championship. Few in the boxing world recognized the legitimacy of that title.", "|align=left| Joe Hopkins"]}, {"page": "Athletics at the 1936 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 50 kilometres walk", "response": ["| ||align=left| Joe Hopkins ||align=left|  || ||DNF"]}, {"page": "Joseph Hopkins", "response": ["#REDIRECTJoe Hopkins"]}]}}
