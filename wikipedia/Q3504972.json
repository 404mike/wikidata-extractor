Jason was a relatively late candidate for the part: Jim Broadbent (who would later appear in a minor recurring role as DCI Roy Slater) and Enn Reitel were earlier preferences. At the time, Broadbent was appearing in Mike Leigh's play, \"Goose-Pimples\", at the Hampstead Theatre in north London. The play was due to transfer to the West End, and consequently, Broadbent thought he would be unable to fit in with the filming schedule and turned down the part.

Orphaned when young, Rodney was raised by Del, and much of the friction between the two comes from Rodney's annoyance about his dependency on his brother and his sometimes immoral schemes, usually resulting in unsuccessful attempts to gain greater independence through girlfriends or through setting up his own businesses; he was only partially successful after marrying Cassandra and briefly going to work for her father.

In casting the role of Grandad, Sullivan had in mind an actor similar to Wilfrid Brambell, who had played Albert Steptoe in Steptoe and Son, but chose not to use Brambell himself, thinking him too closely associated with Steptoe. After seeing Pearce's audition, Sullivan chose him immediately. Unkempt and absent-minded, although sometimes displaying a high intelligence, Grandad rarely left the flat or even moved from his armchair in front of two television sets.

Therefore, Rodney must have been born during 1958. In \"Healthy Competition\", which was broadcast in the November of 1983, Rodney says that he is twenty four years old. Therefore the year of his birth  is either 1958 or 1959. In \"As One Door Closes\", set in early 1985, Rodney tells Del that he is 24, making his year of birth 1960. In \"Yuppy Love\", Del states that the Trotter family have been living at Nelson Mandela House since 1962, and that Rodney was born in the flat. Similarly, Rodney & Cassandra's wedding certificate shows that they were married on 25 January 1989 and gives Rodney's age as 26 and Cassandra's as 21. This would make Rodney born in 1962 (assuming he hadn't yet had a birthday before his wedding in 1989) and during \"Modern Men\" (set around Christmas 1996), Mickey Pearce describes Rodney as a \"34-year-old paperboy\", which would also back up a birth year of 1962. However, during \"Mother Nature's Son\", set around Christmas 1992, Rodney states that he is 31, suggesting he was born in 1961."]}, {"page": "Roy Slater", "response": ["As a child, Slater attempted to be part of Del Boy's gang at school as they used to sit next to each other in class; but he was always a loner, hated amongst his peers and infamous for his deceitful nature.
