William's hagiographer, Thomas of Monmouth, falsely claimed that every year there is an international council of Jews at which they choose the country in which a child will be killed during Easter, because of a Jewish prophecy that states that the killing of a Christian child each year will ensure that the Jews will be restored to the Holy Land. In 1144, England was chosen, and the leaders of the Jewish community delegated the Jews of Norwich to perform the killing. They then abducted and crucified William.; Langmuir, Gavin I (1996), Toward a Definition of Antisemitism, University of California Press, pp. 216ff. The legend was turned into a cult, with William acquiring the status of a martyr and pilgrims bringing offerings to the local church.", "Thomas of Monmouth's story of the annual Jewish meeting to decide which local community would kill a Christian child also quickly spread to the continent. An early version appears in Bonum Universale de Apibus ii. 29, \u00a7 23, by Thomas of Cantimpr\u00e9 (a monastery near Cambray). Thomas wrote, in around 1260, \"It is quite certain that the Jews of every province annually decide by lot which congregation or city is to send Christian blood to the other congregations.\" Thomas of Cantimpr\u00e9 also believed that since the time when the Jews called out to Pontius Pilate, \"His blood be on us, and on our children\" (), they have been afflicted with hemorrhages, a condition equated with male menstruation:Albert Ehrman, \"The Origins of the Ritual Murder Accusation and Blood Libel,\" Tradition: A Journal of Orthodox Jewish Thought, Vol. 15, No. 4 (Spring 1976): 86", "There have been several explanations put forth as to why these blood libel accusations were made and perpetuated. For example, it has been argued Thomas of Monmouth's account and other similar false accusations, as well as their perpetuation, largely had to do with the economic and political interests of leaders who did, in fact, perpetuate these myths.Jeffrey Cohen, Review of  The Murder of William of Norwich: The Origins of the Blood Libel in Medieval Europe, by E.M. Rose  Journal of Interdisciplinary History, Vol. 47, No. 3 (Winter 2017): 410.

Conflicts with the Norman authorities may have been mediated through accusations against the \"alien\" Jews protected by the foreign Norman rulers themselves. Tensions were particularly strong in the chaotic reign of King Stephen (known as The Anarchy) when the murder occurred. Thomas of Monmouth claims that the sheriff was bribed by the Jews to protect them. There may also have been background conflicts between the cathedral, the sheriff and local people about rights in the city and suburbs. Thomas repeatedly invokes God as a source of protection for the people against the corrupt Norman sheriffs, claiming that John de Chesney, the sheriff who protected the Jews, was punished with internal bleeding.", "The wish of the clergy \u2013 in particular, William de Turbeville (Bishop of Norwich 1146\u201374) \u2013 to establish a cultus may have been partly financially motivated.

James's introduction to the book is the first modern analysis of the evidence provided by Thomas. James notes that Thomas is keen to prove the truth of his version of events by citing witnesses to build up a consistent account. He argues that some testimonies seem to be pure invention, others are unreliable, but that some appear to describe real events, though facts are clearly being manipulated to fit the story. James dismisses the claim of planned ritual murder as a fantasy, which only emerges some years after the crime, promoted by the convert Theobald, keen to ingratiate himself with the Christian community. Independent support is very flimsy, such as the servant who is supposed to have glimpsed a child through a crack in the door, but did not report this until interviewed by Thomas years later.", "* Fordham University: the Jesuit University of New York.
