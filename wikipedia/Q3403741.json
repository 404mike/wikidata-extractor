Although he primarily plays as a fly-half, he is also capable of playing at full-back. Born in Llangathen, Carmarthenshire, he began his career with Llanelli RFC before progressing to the Scarlets regional side. After eight years with the Scarlets, he moved to England to play for Bath in the English Premiership, where he spent six seasons before returning to Wales with Cardiff Rugby. He made his Wales debut in 2011, and earned 50 caps \u2013 including being named in the squad for the 2011 and 2015 Rugby World Cups \u2013 before his move to England made him ineligible for selection.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Swansea University", "response": ["* Rhys Priestland, Welsh rugby union international"]}, {"page": "Bath Rugby", "response": ["| Nikola Matawalu , Dominic Day, Rhys Priestland , Alafoti Faosiliva , Francois Louw , Horacio Agulla "]}, {"page": "Carmarthen", "response": ["*Rhys Priestland (born 1987), rugby union Scarlets full-back"]}, {"page": "Cardiff Rugby", "response": ["*  Rhys Priestland"]}, {"page": "Scarlets", "response": ["* Rhys Priestland"]}, {"page": "Rhys", "response": ["* Rhys Priestland (born 1987), Welsh rugby union player"]}, {"page": "2007\u201308 Celtic League", "response": ["|align=center| 5 || align=left|  Rhys Priestland || align=left|  Llanelli Scarlets || align=center| 107"]}, {"page": "Ceiron Thomas", "response": ["Thomas began the 2007\u201308 Magners League as the Scarlets' starting fly-half, while regular number 10 Stephen Jones was on Wales duty at the 2007 Rugby World Cup in France, but lost the berth to rival fly-half Rhys Priestland before Jones' return. In the 2008\u201309 Magners League, Thomas spent much of his time on the bench, playing second-fiddle to Jones and Priestland at fly-half, and the majority of his playing time was spent in other positions, including two starts on the wing in December 2008.

Coach Warren Gatland had faith in Halfpenny, and the Blues winger did enough to force his way into the squad for the 2011 World Cup. During the World Cup, Halfpenny impressed in many positions, particularly at fullback. It was also in this game that Halfpenny became first choice kicker, ahead of fly-halves Rhys Priestland and James Hook. In the semi-final against France, Halfpenny attempted a 47-yard penalty that would have taken Wales to the final. However, the kick fell just short."]}, {"page": "Dan Biggar", "response": ["After 18 months in the wilderness, including missing the 2011 Rugby World Cup, Biggar was recalled for the 2012 Welsh squad after a run of good form with the Ospreys. This form was topped off by the match-winning conversion from the touchline in the 2012 Pro12 Grand Final, as well as a number of man-of-the-match performances in the run-in at the end of the season. Biggar finally got his chance in the Welsh number 10 shirt in the victorious 2013 Six Nations Championship campaign, starting all five games at fly half, thanks to a Rhys Priestland injury. Biggar capped off the tournament with a drop goal, conversion and penalty in the Championship decider against England.", "Biggar continued his good run of form into the 2013\u201314 season, his performances for the Ospreys earning him a call-up for the 2013 Autumn Internationals, in which he started against Australia and Argentina, scoring a try against the former. He played three games during the 2014 Six Nations, coming on as a substitute for Rhys Priestland against France and England and starting against Scotland. In June 2014 Biggar started two tests against South Africa, including in the narrow 31\u201330-second test defeat, despite being yellow-carded. Biggar cemented his place as the Wales starting fly-half during the 2014 Autumn Internationals, starting three out of the four tests. He received many plaudits for his world-class performances, as well as receiving the man-of-the-match award against South Africa in a 12\u20136 victory."]}]}}
