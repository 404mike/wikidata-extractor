However, some scholars believe that Ibn Khaldun's work may have first been introduced to Europe via Ibn Arabshah's biography of Tamerlane, translated to Latin, which covers a meeting between Ibn Khaldun and Tamerlane. According to Ibn Arabshah, during this meeting, Ibn Khaldun and Tamerlane discussed the Maghrib in depth, as well as Tamerlane's genealogy and place in history. Ibn Khaldun began gaining more attention from 1806, when Silvestre de Sacy's Chrestomathie Arabe included his biography together with a translation of parts of the Muqaddimah as the Prolegomena. In 1816, de Sacy again published a biography with a more detailed description on the Prolegomena. More details on and partial translations of the Prolegomena emerged over the years until the complete Arabic edition was published in 1858. Since then, the work of Ibn Khaldun has been extensively studied in the Western world with special interest. Reynold A. Nicholson praised Ibn Khaldun as a uniquely brilliant Muslim sociologist, but discounted Khaldun's influence. Spanish Philosopher Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset viewed the conflicts of North Africa as a problem that stemmed from a lack of African thought, and praised Ibn Khaldun for making sense of the conflict by simplifying it to the relationship between the nomadic and sedentary modes of life."]}, {"page": "Ibn Arabi", "response": ["* The Ringstones of Wisdom (also translated as The Bezels of Wisdom), or Fusus al-Hikam.

As\u00edn's first volume presents a biography, including his life as a jurist/politician and his trail through the world of intellect; As\u00edn here gives a critique of the writings of the medieval Spanish Muslim, focusing on Ibn Hazm as a theologian and as an early historian of religions.Thus As\u00edn did not intend to elaborate on his poetry, his jurisprudence, his political history, or his ethics, as these subjects had already been addressed by others, for example, Nykl, Goldziher, Dozy, and As\u00edn himself. As\u00edn, Abenh\u00e1zam (1927-1932) at I: 9.

Concerning Religions, Heresies, and Sects].Ibn Hazm's Fisal became well-known, for example, it is cited by Ibn Khaldun (1332-1406) in his Muqaddimah, e.g., at the end of section 25 on the Shi'a (Rosenthal's 1958 translation, v.1 at 414).On the Kitab al-Fisal, cf., Reynold A. Nicholson, A Literary History of the Arabs (London: T. Fisher Unwin 1907; reprint: Cambridge University 1962) at 427-428.", "Ibn 'Arabi was prolific teacher, leaving us a vast corpus of written works.As\u00edn in his El Islam (1931, 1990) at 123 n.5, mentions the 150 items of Ibn 'Arabi listed by Carl Brockelmann in his Geschichte der arabisches Literatur, 5 volumes (Weimer & Leiden 1898-1942) at I: 442-448.The immense multi-volume al-Futuhat al-makkiyya is the major work by Ibn 'Arabi. Selections are translated as The Meccan Revelations, 2 volumes (New York: Pir Press 2002 & 2004), edited by Michel Chodkiewicz [first published in French and English as Les Illuminations de La Mecque (Paris: Sinbad 1998)]; Rev. Miguel As\u00edn had translated a few selections of the Fotuhat in his El Islam (1931, 1990) at 450-518. Another major work by the Ibn 'Arabi is the shorter Fusus al-hikam, translated by R. W. J. Austin as The Bezels of Wisdom (Paulist Press 1980), Preface by Titus Burckhardt. Twenty-seven prophets are here individually addressed. As\u00edn functioned as a western pioneer in Sufi studies, particularly with respect to the difficult and demanding Ibn 'Arabi, the Shaykh al-Akbar.Up to 1911, only one of the 150 extant works of Ibn 'Arabi had appeared in a European edition: a \"brief glossary of Sufi technical terms\" published by Gustav Fl\u00fcgel in 1845.

The Life of Ibn 'Arabi (Cambridge: Islamic Texts Society 1993) at 1, and generally 1-10, in which As\u00edn the pioneer undergoes a critique. Yet unfortunately the Addas biography at 40, note 24, apparently mistakens As\u00edn's text at 37, notes 1 & 2, which does cite and quote to the Fotuhat [III:311 & I:363] regarding Ibn 'Arabi's young wife; cf., Austin's \"Introduction\" 17-59, at 46 n.3 and 22-23, to Ibn 'Arabi, Sufis of Andalucia (1971; 2002).Shaykh al-Akbar or greatest Teacher. Not surprisingly As\u00edn assumes the viewpoint of a spiritually involved Christian academic; he sees in the works of Ibn 'Arabi many similarities with his own religion's mystics and doctrines. Consequently, As\u00edn brings his specific, spiritually-informed consciousness to his discussion of the principles and practices taught by Ibn 'Arabi.As\u00edn, El Islam (1931, 1990), for example, at 5-7 (explaining his title), and at 7-28 (adumbrating his 'hypothesis'). According to Prof. Alexander Knysh, As\u00edn was one of the earlier western scholars of Ibn 'Arabi, a motivated European clergyman who was:", "In his introduction, As\u00edn observes that while Christian Spain later became deeply influenced by Muslim mysticism, previously the oriental Church had equally influenced early Islam.Miguel As\u00edn Palacios, El Islam cristianizado (Madrid: Editorial Plutarco 1931; reprint Ediciones Hiperi\u00f3n 1990), for example, at 12-13. Also, As\u00edn Palacios, \"Influencias evang\u00e9licas en la Literatura religiosa del Islam\" at 8-27, in A volume of oriental studies dedicated to Edward G. Browne (Cambridge Univ. 1922), edited by T. W. Arnold and Reynold A. Nicholson.The same year Margaret Smith described this Christian influence on early Islam in some detail in her Studies in Early Mysticism in the Near and Middle East (London: Sheldon Press 1931; reprint Oneworld 1995) at chapters VI, VII, and XI. (This book also said to be reissued in 1976 as The Way of the Mystics, reprint Oxford Univ. 1978). Islam then arrived in the far west, the Maghreb al-Aksa and Andalusia, where Ibn 'Arabi would be born. From the perspective of religious studies, it might be said that As\u00edn Palacios here presents us with a multidimensional, polyphonic text for comparative religion. In his other works on Sufi practice, As\u00edn mentions precursors of Ibn 'Arabi in al-Andalus (i.e., the school of Ibn Masarra), as well as those who drew on his teachings afterwards (for example, the tariqah of the Sadilies [or xadil\u00edes]).El Islam cristianizado at 171-174; cf. \"Selected Publications\" below (for example, Abenmasarra y su escuela, and Sadilies y alumbrados). Valdivia V\u00e1lor, Don Miguel As\u00edn Palacios at 132-133. Monroe, Islam and the Arabs in Spanish Scholarship at 180-181, 193-194. As\u00edn refers to the many parallels between al-Ghazali and Ibn 'Arabi,El Islam cristianizado, at 263 note 1, itemizing several with reference to the Fotuhat, and noting that Ibn 'Arabi gave public courses at Mecca on the Ilya of al-Ghazali. both well-known and still studied teachers."]}]}}
