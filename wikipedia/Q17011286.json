Philosophy scholar Jennifer Saul argues that the use of male generic language marginalizes women, intersex, and non-binary people in society. In recent years, some writers have started to use more gender-inclusive language (for instance, using the pronouns they/them and using gender-inclusive words like humankind, person, partner, spouse, businessperson, firefighter, chairperson and police officer)."]}, {"page": "List of women philosophers", "response": ["*Jennifer Saul (fl. 2014)"]}, {"page": "List of philosophers born in the 20th century", "response": ["* Jennifer Saul (born 1968)"]}, {"page": "Women in philosophy", "response": ["In the early 1800s, some colleges and universities in the UK and US began admitting women, producing more female academics.
