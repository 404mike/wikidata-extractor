Wilder would play six matches for Sussex, the last of which came against the Essex in 1906.\nWilder represented the England XI against Hambledon in a commemorative first-class match in 1908. In 1909 Wilder played one County Championship match for Hampshire against Derbyshire. It was during his final match that Wilder took his best first-class bowling figures, taking 3/14.\nWilder was still active in his home town of Emsworth in 1906, when he laid a stone in the then under-construction Emsworth Post Office. The inscription on the stone suggests that Wilder was living at Stansted House at the time.\nWilder died a day after his 72nd birthday, on 10 June 1948 at Las Vegas, United States.", "link_mentions": {}}}
