It was the height of the English Renaissance and saw the flowering of English literature and poetry. This was also the time during which Elizabethan theatre was famous and William Shakespeare, among others, composed plays that broke away from England's past style of plays and theatre. It was an age of expansion and exploration abroad, while at home the Protestant Reformation became entrenched in the national mindset.John A.

It is also significant, Wilson says, as being the point where poisoning\u2014both legally and in the popular imagination\u2014\"does acquire a vigorous cultural presence missing in earlier treatments\". Bellany suggests that the case \"starkly revealed the poisoner's unnerving power to subvert the order and betray the intimacies that bound household and community together\". In other words, the former was a microcosm of the latter. The secrecy with which the lower-class could subvert their superior's authority, and the wider damage this was seen to do, explains why the Acte for Poysonyngs directly compares poisoning  as a crime with that of coining. Penry Williams suggests that the Roose case, and particularly the elevation of poisoning to a crime of high treason, is an example of a broader, more endemic, extension of capital offences under the Tudors and Henry VIII in particular."]}, {"page": "Penry", "response": ["*Penry Williams (1866\u20131945), English politician ", "*Penry Williams (artist) (1802\u20131885), Welsh artist", "*Penry Williams (historian) (1925-2013), Welsh historian"]}]}}
