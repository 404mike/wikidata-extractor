The event, open to amateur walkers, was run annually from 1922 until 2000 over a distance of . It attracted up to 250,000 spectators and some of the entrants, such as Roland Hardy and John Warhurst, went on to represent their country at the Olympics and Commonwealth Games.  Women were permitted to enter from the early 1970s. In the \u201890s, its popularity declined, and the event was cancelled, being last run in 2000. It was brought back for a one-off event in 2013 to raise money to erect the Women of Steel statue.", "During the 1950s the event was very popular in the city, with some 250,000 spectators lining the route.  Future Labour Party politician and M.P. for Bolsover, Dennis Skinner, entered in 1956 after just six weeks of training.  He came second, though he thought he could have won if he had not slowed down his pace in anticipation of a steep hill.  As well as a runners-up cup Skinner received a razor blade in a leather case.  The popularity of the event, which had sometimes attracted thousands of entrants, soon declined and in 1958 only 38 walkers participated.  In 1964 Mick Barker set the record for the 12-mile version of the event, at 98 minutes 15 seconds, which remained unbeaten.  The 1967 race winner John Warhurst represented England at the 1974 British Commonwealth Games, held in Christchurch, New Zealand."]}]}}
