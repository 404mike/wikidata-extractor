His low death grunts on the band's early recordings pinpointed the group's early identification with the death/doom genre.White also fronted other bands, including The Blood Divine with former members of Cradle of Filth (for which he did backing vocals/spoken words on The Principle of Evil Made Flesh) and Dead Men Dream. His project, Serotonal, has been described as \"drone/atmospheric doom\". In February 2009 Serotonal signed a record deal with Union Black Records, and debut album Monumental - Songs of Misery and Hope was released on 24 November 2009.\nDarren is also erroneously said to have played drums for Cradle of Filth in 1991-92. This, however, was Darren Gardner. He is now singing in Antifear alongside ex Anathema bandmate Duncan Patterson", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Blood Divine", "response": ["* Darren \"Daz\" White - vocals (1995\u20131998)"]}, {"page": "Vincent Cavanagh", "response": ["Vincent Cavanagh (born 29 August 1973 in Liverpool) is an English singer and guitarist best known as a co-founder (and the sole constant member) of British rock band Anathema.
