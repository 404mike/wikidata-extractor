These included demonstrating at railway stations where immigrant-carrying trains were arriving, holding a counter-demonstration to one organised by the Anti-Apartheid Movement, and holding a rally to oppose the Lord Mayor's Show because the presiding Lord Mayor of London, Bernard Waley-Cohen, was Jewish. Even so, the BNP managed to secure an 8.1% share of the vote in Deptford in the 1960 London County Council (LCC) election, a large result for a new party without name recognition. A National Youth Movement was also organised; this was sponsored by General Sir Richard Hilton, who was leader of his own Patriotic Party. Although rumours circulated at the time that German neo-Nazi groups were funding the BNP, there is no evidence to support this; it seems likely that the party was supported by a mixture of collections held in Trafalgar Square and funds from Fountaine who was personally well-off."]}, {"page": "Harry Nathan, 1st Baron Nathan", "response": ["His wife Eleanor Nathan was Chairman of London County Council (1947\u20131948).
