He was in command of the first failed efforts to break the siege of Kut in 1916.  From a military background, Aylmer was commissioned into the Indian Army, and immediately involved in fierce fighting on the north-west frontier.  In a singularly heroic action, still in his twenties, he helped rescue Townshend's garrison at Chitral, spearheading the relief column.  For his valorous conduct he was awarded the Victoria Cross, and rapid promotion through the officer class.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Golders Green Crematorium", "response": ["* Sir Fenton Aylmer, 13th Baronet, British soldier, VC recipient"]}, {"page": "Fenton Aylmer", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sir Fenton Aylmer, 13th Baronet"]}, {"page": "Aylmer", "response": ["* Sir Fenton Aylmer, 13th Baronet, British Army general and Victoria Cross recipient"]}, {"page": "List of people from Hastings", "response": ["* Lieutenant-General Sir Fenton Aylmer, 13th Baronet (1862\u20131935), awarded the Victoria Cross in 1891 the Hunza\u2013Nagar Campaign, India.
