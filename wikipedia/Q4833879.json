He was the second Premier of the colony of South Australia, succeeding Boyle Travers Finniss; however, he only held office for 12 days from 21 August to 1 September 1857 before being succeeded by the third Premier of the colony, Robert Torrens."]}, {"page": "Richard Hanson (Australian politician)", "response": ["In 1851 Hanson was appointed advocate-general of the colony, initially as a temporary replacement for the ailing William Smillie, made permanent when Smillie died. He took an active share in the passing of many important measures, such as the first Education Act, the District Councils Act of 1852, and the Act of 1856 which granted constitutional government to the colony.  In 1856 he was attorney-general in the first ministry under Boyle Travers Finniss; becoming premier himself in 1857. Among the acts passed were the first patents act, an insolvency act, a partial consolidation of the criminal law, and the Torrens real property act, though he was at first opposed to this measure. He also passed an act legalizing marriage with a deceased wife's sister, the first of its kind in the Empire, but the royal assent was refused on this occasion."]}, {"page": "George Strickland Kingston", "response": ["Kingston's ability as a surveyor was frequently questioned and his lack of qualifications and blunders in the survey of Adelaide caused Light to have some of his work re-surveyed by Assistant Surveyors Boyle Travers Finniss and George Owen Ormsby. Completion of the survey of the city was delayed for a fortnight because of his mistakes. However it was he who was spared to return to England in August 1837 to ask for reinforcements for the Survey Department. The colonisation commissioners sent him back next June with orders unpalatable to Light, who resigned with all but three of his staff. Kingston resigned soon after Governor George Gawler's arrival in October 1838  and Ormsby, \"one of the best, if not the very best, on the staff of Col. Light\", was put in temporary charge of the survey, with directions 'to proceed with the utmost despatch'. "]}]}}
