Shot predominantly in New Zealand and a few in Central Europe, it was released in December 2005 to critical and high commercial success, grossing more than $745 million worldwide. Unlike the others who had endured an 18-month lengthy casting process, he was cast within weeks. In 2004, after the producers saw 2,000 young hopefuls, Keynes won the role of Edmund whose story is especially dramatic as his character is central to themes of betrayal, forgiveness, and redemption. He performed his own complex stunts: jumping into the ditch, sword fighting, and horse riding. He also voiced his character in the video game The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. In 2006, Keynes was awarded the CAMIE Award (Character and Morality in Entertainment) for his portrayal.", "|rowspan=5|Edmund Pevensie"]}]}}
