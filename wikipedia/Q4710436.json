He served from 23 February 1953 to 2 April 1959, and represented the Labor Party. \nHawke was born in South Australia, and began his political career in that state, winning a seat in the House of Assembly at the 1924 state election. He was only 23 at the time, making him the youngest MP in South Australia's history. Hawke lost his seat at the 1927 election, and moved to Western Australia the following year. At the 1933 state election in Western Australia, which saw a Labor landslide, he unexpectedly defeated the sitting Nationalist premier, Sir James Mitchell, in the seat of Northam.\nIn May 1936, Hawke became a minister in the government of Philip Collier. He later also served as a minister in the governments of John Willcock and Frank Wise, and was elected deputy leader of the Labor Party in July 1945. Hawke succeeded Wise as party leader in June 1951, and led Labor to victory at the 1953 state election. He retained government at the 1956 election, just a year after the 1955 party split, but was defeated in 1959 after just over six years in office. Hawke continued as Labor leader until December 1966, leading the party to two more elections, and left parliament at the 1968 election.\nHis nephew, Bob Hawke, served as the 23rd Prime Minister of Australia from March 1983 to December 1991.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "December 3", "response": ["*1900 \u2013 Albert Hawke, Australian politician, 18th Premier of Western Australia (d. 1986)"]}, {"page": "Premier of Western Australia", "response": ["| rowspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" style=\"background:red; color:white;\"| 18 || rowspan=\"2\" align=\"center\"| Albert Hawke(1900\u20131986) || rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background:white\" |100px|| MLA for Northam1933\u20131968 (did not contest) || Labor Party || 23 February1953 || 2 April1959 || Hawke Ministry || rowspan=\"2\" align=\"center\"| 1953"]}, {"page": "Kapunda", "response": ["* Albert Hawke (1900\u20131986), Premier of Western Australia"]}, {"page": "Charles Gairdner", "response": ["Gairdner's tenure was relatively free of political or constitutional crisis. When Labor's loss of the October 1955 Bunbury by-election resulted in the Albert Hawke government's losing its parliamentary majority, the possibility was raised that the governor might have to exercise his reserve powers. However the parliament remained in recess until Labor won the ensuing 1956 general election. The Perth Chest Hospital was renamed Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital in his honour in May 1963. Gairdner stepped down from his post on 26 June 1963.
