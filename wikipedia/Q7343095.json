He also became a proficient oarsman and, in addition to various successes at local regattas, he beat David Coombes (son of champion sculler, Robert Coombes) in the Thames Championship for \u00a3200, and Ted May (author of Ted May's Useful Little Book)Ted May's Useful Little Book:Hammersmith: Ted May, 1883 Retrieved on 2008-08-22 over the same course for \u00a3100. He was the head of the famous \"Colleen Bawn\" crew, who were so named when the proprietor of Queen's Theatre in Manchester gave a prize, on condition that the winning crew became known by the name of his latest theatre production. After marrying a woman named Jane Lovelock, Mark moved across the river to Ordsall in Salford and became the landlord of the Old Boathouse Inn in Everard Street off Ordsall Lane, due to its close proximity to the river. He had 4 children, Mary Jane (1861-1940), Joseph Henry (1863-1888), Elizabeth (1865-1911), and Ada (1871-1929) and for a brief period of time, he took in his brothers son, Mark Anthony (1856-1899). He continued to carry out a series of rescues. Although in Mark's youth the river was relatively clean, as the Industrial Revolution progressed it became more and more polluted, and indeed when the Suez Canal was opened in 1869, the Irwell was jokingly renamed the \"Sewage Canal\".

The race commenced from below Westminster Bridge at 1.30\u00a0p.m., with Edward Searle acting as the starter.  With a number of steamers blocking the route, Oxford made a good start and took an early lead.  The wake of the steamers caused rough water in which both crews struggled to maintain a consistent rhythm.  The lead had extended by the time the crews passed below Vauxhall Bridge and was nearly three lengths by the Spread Eagle pub.  At this point Cambridge began to reduce the deficit, but following a warning from Robert Coombes who was steering the umpire's boat Dolphin, Oxford's cox Garnett steered across the path of Cambridge.  The Light Blues maintained their course and Oxford were forced back again.  By the Red House, Cambridge had restored parity and started to pull away.  Despite suffering further rough water from the wake of another steamer at Battersea Bridge, Cambridge maintained their lead and passed through the centre arch of Putney Bridge three-quarters of a length ahead of Oxford.MacMichael, pp. 72\u201374  The winning time was 29 minutes 3 seconds, and the victory took the overall lead to 3\u20131 in favour of Cambridge."]}, {"page": "The Boat Race 1846", "response": ["For the first time in the history of the race, both boats used outriggers.MacMichael pp. 133, 136  Both crews had professional coaches: Oxford used John Noulton while Cambridge were trained by Robert Coombes, a champion sculler.
