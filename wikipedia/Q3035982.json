Among other early performances, he was leading man for two years at the Little Theatre, Great Yarmouth. In 1951, he joined the D'Oyly Carte organisation and soon began to play roles, becoming the company's principal bass until 1969.  With Thomas Round and Norman Meadmore, he formed the touring company, Gilbert and Sullivan for All, in which he continued to sing bass and bass-baritone roles as well as directing.  By the early 1980s, Adams was performing in opera and operetta throughout Britain and abroad, continuing nearly until his death. He recorded many of his roles, particularly his Gilbert and Sullivan repertoire.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Pirates of Penzance", "response": ["|Pirate King||Darrell Fancourt||Donald Adams||Donald Adams||John Ayldon||John Ayldon"]}, {"page": "The Mikado", "response": ["|The Mikado||Donald Adams||Donald Adams||John Ayldon||John Ayldon", "In 1966, the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company made a film version of The Mikado that closely reflected their traditional staging, although there are some minor cuts.
