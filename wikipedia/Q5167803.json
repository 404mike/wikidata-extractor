Cinemas and theatres of that name were built in Brixton (now the Brixton Academy), Finsbury Park, Charing Cross Road, Old Kent Road and Streatham. All were designed by Edward Albert Stone. The brand was soon extended to seaside resorts across southeast England at the initiative of a group of businessmen led by E.E. Lyons. (\"Teddy\" Lyons had opened one of Brighton's earliest cinemas, the Academy, in 1911 and was well known in the town's entertainment scene.) The group, which also included Sussex Daily News proprietor J.H. Infield (who served as chairman of the Academy Cinema until 1926), had identified a site in 1932 when they planned to open a cinema under the Plaza brand. This did not happen, but in 1933 the consortium commissioned Edward Stone to build a \"super cinema\" under the Astoria name there. The site was on Gloucester Place, north of Old Steine, and a number of houses from the Georgian and Victorian eras were knocked down to make way. Work began on 17 July 1933 on the 1,823-seat building, which was designed as a combined theatre and cinema with a full stage and dressing rooms. Thursday 21 December 1933 was the opening night; Cooper Rawson  and Margaret Hardy, respectively Brighton's Member of Parliament and Mayor, made the inaugural speeches. These were followed by a Movietone News newsreel, features by Path\u00e9 and Disney (Santa's Workshop) and the main film\u2014The Private Life of Henry VIII starring Charles Laughton."]}, {"page": "March 1935", "response": ["*A new sculpture by Jacob Epstein titled Ecce Homo went on display at the Leicester Galleries, depicting an eleven-foot tall Christ with a square face and a broad, flat nose reminiscent of Polynesian art.
