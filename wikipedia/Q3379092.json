Toosey was very different from Nicholson and was certainly not a collaborator who felt obliged to work with the Japanese. Toosey in fact did as much as possible to delay the building of the bridge. While Nicholson disapproves of acts of sabotage and other deliberate attempts to delay progress, Toosey encouraged this: termites were collected in large numbers to eat the wooden structures, and the concrete was badly mixed. Some consider the film to be an insulting parody of Toosey. ", "The major railway bridge described in the novel and film did not actually cross the river known at the time as the Kwai.

Retrieved 09-24-2015. Boulle had never been to the bridge. He knew that the railway ran parallel to the Kwae for many miles, and he therefore assumed that it was the Kwae which it crossed just north of Kanchanaburi. This was an incorrect assumption. The destruction of the bridge as depicted in the film is also entirely fictional. In fact, two bridges were built: a temporary wooden bridge and a permanent steel/concrete bridge a few months later. Both bridges were used for two years, until they were destroyed by Allied bombing. The steel bridge was repaired and is still in use today."]}, {"page": "Burma Railway", "response": ["* Philip Toosey, senior Allied officer at the Bridge on the River Kwai"]}, {"page": "Pierre Boulle", "response": ["While in Paris, Boulle used his war experiences in writing Le Pont de la rivi\u00e8re Kwa\u00ef (1952; The Bridge over the River Kwai), which became a multi-million-copy worldwide bestseller, winning the French \"Prix Sainte-Beuve\".
