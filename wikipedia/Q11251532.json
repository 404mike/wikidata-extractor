Since the first description of Thysanopode tricuspide by Henri Milne-Edwards in 1830, the similarity of their biramous thoracopods had led zoologists to group euphausiids and Mysidacea in the order Schizopoda, which was split by Johan Erik Vesti Boas in 1883 into two separate orders. Later, William Thomas Calman (1904) ranked the Mysidacea in the superorder Peracarida and euphausiids in the superorder Eucarida, although even up to the 1930s the order Schizopoda was advocated. It was later also proposed that order Euphausiacea should be grouped with the Penaeidae (family of prawns) in the Decapoda based on developmental similarities, as noted by Robert Gurney and Isabella Gordon. The reason for this debate is that krill share some morphological features of decapods and others of mysids."]}, {"page": "Gordon (surname)", "response": ["* Isabella Gordon (1901\u20131988), British biological scientist"]}, {"page": "List of Scottish scientists", "response": ["|  Isabella Gordon"]}, {"page": "Arthur Thomson (naturalist)", "response": ["While at the University of Aberdeen Thomson supervised the research of respected carcinologist Isabella Gordon."]}, {"page": "Discovery Investigations", "response": ["| Isabella Gordon DSc PhD,"]}, {"page": "Rhynchocinetes durbanensis", "response": ["Rhynchocinetes durbanensis, commonly known as the camel shrimp and the hingebeak prawn, is a species of shrimp (family Rhynchocinetidae) found in the Indo-Pacific.

The International Code of Zoological Nomenclature uses the designation Sergia kishinouyei that Nakazawa and Terao gave it in 1915.  Researchers tend to use the Sergia lucens, which Danish zoologist Hans Jacob Hansen gave it in 1922, especially since Isabella Gordon published a detailed account of the species in On New Or Imperfectly Known Species of Crustacea Macrura in 1935 using Hansen's designation.
