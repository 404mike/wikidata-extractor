In 2017, she stood for election in Coventry South, receiving 1.3% of the votes.\nIn 2018, David Challenor, Knight's father, who had been serving as her election agent, was convicted and jailed for raping and torturing a 10-year-old girl, and for making indecent images of children. Knight's recruitment of her father, despite her knowledge of the charges for 22 sexual offences, led to an investigation and Knight's suspension from the Green Party. She later resigned and joined the Liberal Democrats, but was suspended in 2019 over tweets allegedly posted by her partner concerning sexual fantasies around children. Knight resigned from Stonewall UK at around the same time, leaving the United Kingdom for the United States.\nIn March 2021, Knight\u2014who had been hired as an administrator by Reddit\u2014became a topic of contention on the website over her connection to David Challenor, leading to several sub-communities to protest her employment by the company. This resulted, after the banning of a moderator and sitewide protests, in an official statement by the website's administrators being released; in which Reddit confirmed that it had not properly vetted Knight before hiring her and that she was no longer employed by the company.", "link_mentions": []}}
