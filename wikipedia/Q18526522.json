Hooper reports that the late Gervase Mathew told him that he heard Lewis read The Dark Tower to the Inklings around that time. Anne Paxch posted in MERELEWIS  that many who never attended any Inklings meetings heard Lewis read his unpublished works elsewhere, and that she recalls Gervase Mathew and others discussing passages which later appeared in The Dark Tower. Inklings scholar John D. Rateliff suggests that the story could have been written some years later, in about 1946, pointing to a reference in a 1944 letter by Lewis's friend J. R. R. Tolkien to a story by Lewis that could be The Dark Tower.Rateliff, John D. \"The Lost Road, The Dark Tower and The Notion Club Papers: Tolkien and Lewis's Time Travel Triad\".

Alistair Fowler had clear memories of the \"Stinging Man\" character in an unfinished manuscript which Lewis showed him in 1952."]}, {"page": "David Winfield (conservator)", "response": ["Winfield was a boarder at Bryanston School in Dorset and went on to read Modern History at Merton College in Oxford, graduating in 1954. Having acquired a taste for exploring Byzantine art and architecture on a student motorcycle road trip across Europe to Istanbul via Mount Athos, Winfield, upon the advice of two of the leading academics of the time, Gervase Mathew and David Talbot Rice, applied for and won a British Council Scholarship. This award enabled him to spend two years at Belgrade University where he worked with major Serbian art historians and, in the summer holidays, he acquired valuable wall painting conservation techniques at the 13th century monastery in Sopo\u0107ani; an UN-sponsored project run by an Italian team. \u00a0"]}]}}
