Both chemists owned a chemistry plant near Gripsholm, Sweden, producing sulfuric acid by the lead chamber process. The pyrite from the Falun Mine created a red precipitate in the lead chambers which was presumed to be an arsenic compound, so the pyrite's use to make acid was discontinued. Berzelius and Gahn wanted to use the pyrite and they also observed that the red precipitate gave off a smell like horseradish when burned. This smell was not typical of arsenic, but a similar odor was known from tellurium compounds. Hence, Berzelius's first letter to Alexander Marcet stated that this was a tellurium compound. However, the lack of tellurium compounds in the Falun Mine minerals eventually led Berzelius to reanalyze the red precipitate, and in 1818 he wrote a second letter to Marcet describing a newly found element similar to sulfur and tellurium. Because of its similarity to tellurium, named for the Earth, Berzelius named the new element after the Moon.

The composition of carbon disulfide was finally determined in 1813 by the team of the Swedish chemist J\u00f6ns Jacob Berzelius (1779\u20131848) and the Swiss-British chemist Alexander Marcet (1770\u20131822).

Some notable events closer to our time, include Prince Henry the Navigator\u2019s ocean exploration in the 1400s. In 1513, Ponce de Leon described the Florida Current. In 1674, Robert Boyle investigated the relationship between salinity, temperature, and pressure in the depths of the ocean. Captain James Cook\u2019s voyages were responsible for extensive data collection on geography, geology, biota, currents, tides, and water temperatures of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans in the 1760s and 1770s. In 1820, Alexander Marcet noted the varying chemical composition of seawater in the different oceans. Not long after, in 1843, Edward Forbes, a British naturalist, stated that marine organisms could not exist deeper than 300 fathoms (even though many had already collected organisms much deeper, many followed Forbes' influence). Forbes\u2019 theory was finally believed to be incorrect by the masses when submarine cable was lifted from a depth of 1830 m and covered in animals.

This work occupied a large proportion of his effort, and his writings on urinary sediments and kidney stones were the most advanced at the time.  His work followed on from, and was much influenced by, that of Alexander Marcet and William Prout.  Marcet was also a physician at Guy's; Prout held no position at Guy's, but was connected with the hospital and well known there.  For instance, when Marcet discovered a new constituent of kidney stones, xanthic oxide, he sent it to Prout for analysis.  Prout discovered a new substance himself in 1822, a constituent of urine which he named melanic acid, because it turned black on contact with air.Rosenfeld, 1999, pp. 49\u201350Coley, p. 363"]}, {"page": "William Marcet", "response": ["He was born the son of Francis Marcet, FRS and the grandson of Alexander Marcet, FRS in Geneva, Switzerland.
