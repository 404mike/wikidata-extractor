He was soon promoted to premier danseur and was cast as partner to ballerinas Nadia Nerina, Pauline Clayden, and Pamela May in Giselle, The Sleeping Beauty, Copp\u00e9lia, and other classic works. He was particularly noted for dancing the technically demanding role of the Bluebird in The Sleeping Beauty. In the contemporary repertory, he created roles in a number of works by Ninette de Valois,Kathrine Sorley Walker, Ninette de Valois: Idealist without Illusions (London: Dance Books, 1987), pp. 227 et seq. Frederick Ashton,David Vaughan, Frederick Ashton and His Ballets (New York: Knopf, 1977), pp. 200 et seq. and Robert Helpmann.Elizabeth Salter, Helpmann: The Authorized Biography of Sir Robert Helpmann, CBE (London: Angus & Robertson, 1978).

His engaging personality made him well suited to lighthearted roles, but he was also adept at characterization in dramatic works. As a solo dancer, he was admired for his smooth, lithe movement, and he was valued by ballerinas such as Margot Fonteyn, Beryl Grey, and Violetta Elvin as an exceptionally able partner. In 1958, he danced Albrecht to the Giselle of the great French ballerina Yvette Chauvir\u00e9 in her guest appearances with the Royal Ballet."]}, {"page": "1924 in the Soviet Union", "response": ["* 3 November \u2013 Violetta Elvin, ballerina "]}, {"page": "Deaths in May 2021", "response": ["*Violetta Elvin, 97, Russian prima ballerina and actress.E' morta Donna Violetta, il sindaco: \"Aveva una grazia e una dolcezza uniche\" "]}]}}
