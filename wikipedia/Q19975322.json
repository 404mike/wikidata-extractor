Later in the year Bengough set up an office on 2 Toronto Street and with his four brothers formed the Bengough Brothers company.  Bengough continued to work at the Globe until Grip established itself. He used pseudonyms until he left the newspaper later in the year. The editor's name appeared as a \"Charles\u00a0P. Hall\" until Thomas Phillips Thompson took over as editor on 26 July under the pseudonym \"Jimuel Briggs\"; he lasted until the 6 September issue, when he printed a pro-alcohol article despite Bengough's prohibitionist views.  The Toronto Globes R.\u00a0H. Larminie then took on co-editing duties as \"Demos Mudge\" with Bengough as \"Barnaby Rudge\".  Regular contributors other than Bengough included R.\u00a0W. Phipps, who produced the greatest amount of Grips poetry; Tom Boylan, who Bengough considered Grips best humourist; Edward Edwards, who wrote sombre topical articles in contrast to the humour of the rest of the magazine; and William Alexander Foster who wrote scathing editorials about Oliver Mowat's Ontario Liberal Party, which contrasted with Bengough's position and lent credibility to the magazine's assertions of non-partisanship.  Writers such as Peter McArthur got their start with Grip.", "In 1883, Frank Wilson took over management of the printing of Grip.  Thomas Phillips Thompson became associate editor.  He shared with Bengough a radical political outlook and a taste for satire, though was less open to new ideas than Bengough, who was quick to attach himself to new causes.  Thompson was anti-imperialist, anti-capitalist, and anti-militarist.  In 1892, the managers of Grip passed the editorship from Bengough to Thompson and Bengough's cartoons stopped appearing after the 6 August 1892 issue.  Years later, Bengough's brother Thomas blamed the board of directors at Grip, Inc., for the falling out over \"general mismanagement\", which may have involved losses incurred in relation to a government contract."]}, {"page": "Thomas Thompson", "response": ["* Thomas Phillips Thompson (1843\u20131933), English-born journalist and humorist"]}, {"page": "Canadian Socialist League", "response": ["In Ontario the CSL was organized by George Weston Wrigley and Thomas Phillips Thompson, both former Knights of Labor, in an effort to pull together the reform forces that had become fragmented after the Patrons of Industry were defeated in the 1896 federal election."]}, {"page": "Women's suffrage in Canada", "response": ["It was believed in 1883 that public sentiment had sufficiently progressed to warrant the formation of a regular Woman-Suffrage Society.

Their purpose was to hold a conversation to discuss the advisability of granting the franchise to those women who possessed the property qualification that entitled men to hold it; and then to proceed to form a suffrage club. Accordingly, on that date, Jessie Turnbull McEwen, then President of the club, was present along with Mayor Arthur Radcliffe Boswell, ex-Alderman John Hallam, Alderman John Baxter, John Wilson Bengough, Thomas Bengough, Thomas Phillips Thompson, and Mr. Burgess, editor of Citizen. The Canadian Woman Suffrage Association was formally inaugurated, and 40 people enrolled themselves as members that evening."]}, {"page": "Toronto South (provincial electoral district)", "response": ["| Thomas Phillips Thompson"]}, {"page": "Grip (magazine)", "response": ["Thomas Phillips Thompson became Grips editor in 1892 after Bengough was removed."]}, {"page": "Toronto (provincial electoral district)", "response": ["| Thomas Phillips Thompson", "| Thomas Phillips Thompson"]}, {"page": "George Weston Wrigley", "response": ["In Ontario the CSL was organized by Wrigley and Thomas Phillips Thompson, both former Knights of Labor, in an effort to pull together the reform forces that had become fragmented after the Patrons of Industry were defeated in the 1896 federal election.", "Wrigley was supported by Thomas Phillips Thompson in this effort."]}, {"page": "T.
