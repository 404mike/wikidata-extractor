The movement was controversial from its inception, being accused of forcing the children to emigrate, of breaking up families, and of placing the children in a situation hardly different from slavery. Douglas sent children to the Ottawa area, to Manitoba, and into Quebec."]}, {"page": "Archibald Douglas Drumlanrig", "response": ["#REDIRECT Archibald Douglas, 8th Marquess of Queensberry"]}]}}
