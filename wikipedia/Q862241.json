He went on to report on crime, on motoring, and to become a news editor.\nHe began writing crime novels in the 1950s. Knox often wrote under pseudonyms, frequently for the American market. These included Michael Kirk, Robert MacLeod and Noah Webster.  He published over 50 crime novels, including several series, notably the \"Thane and Moss\" books.\nIn the 1970s, he was approached by Scottish Television to present a series asking for public assistance in solving crimes in the central Scotland area. Knox presented the fifteen-minute slot for over ten years, always signing off with the promise that any calls to the police \"can be in confidence\". At this time he also made a series of short programmes called Tales of Crime, also for STV, in which he recounted famous Scottish criminal cases. \nHis crime novels from the 1960s onwards, and in the 1970s his Crimedesk television series, publicised the Glasgow slang term \"neds\", referring to petty criminals or small-time hoodlums. A 1982 analysis of crime fiction discussing Knox's 1977 novel Pilot Error noted his description of Strathclyde Police as being unconcerned about \"neds\" getting hurt in a fight as long as no one else was affected.His final novel, The Lazarus Widow, was unfinished at the time of his death, and was completed by Martin Edwards.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Novelization", "response": ["| Edward Boyd and Bill Knox"]}, {"page": "William Knox", "response": ["*Bill Knox (1928\u20131999), Scottish author"]}, {"page": "Goldmann (publisher)", "response": ["Focus of the Red series was predominantly Anglo-Saxon crime fiction in which the covers were created in the corresponding color.
