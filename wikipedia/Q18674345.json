Their new type may be traced in several works issued between 1764 and 1770. The manager of Messrs. Joseph Fry & Wm Pine was Isaac Moore, formerly a whitesmith at Birmingham,Edward Rowe Mores, Dissertation upon English Typogr. Founders, 1778, p. 83 after whose speedy admission to partnership the business (Bristol Letter Foundry of 1764\u20131773) moved and went to London. He carried on as \"Isaac Moore & Co., in Queen Street, near Upper Moorfields\". Philip Luckombe mentions Moore as one of three London founders.History of Printing, 1770, p. 244 In 1774 the London firm produced a fine folio bible, and in 1774\u20131776 a well-printed edition in five volumes. Fry's first founts were cut in imitation of Baskerville's, the punches being engraved by Isaac Moore. About this time they turned away from their earlier Baskerville style of letter, to follow the more popular Caslon character."]}, {"page": "William Rufus Chetwood", "response": ["This second marriage may have contributed to severe financial difficulties by 1741, when a benefit performance of William Congreve's The Old Bachelor was given for him at Covent Garden. A collection called Five New Novels appeared in the same year. There are mentions of him working in Dublin in 1741 and 1744, and Belfast (with his daughter) in 1753. At the end of the decade there appeared his General History of the Stage (1749), which includes valuable accounts of the contemporary London and Dublin theatre. Other efforts to make a living included A Tour through Ireland (1748, with Philip Luckombe) and a poem called Kilkenny, or, The Old Man's Wish (1748). His British Theatre (1750) includes a list of Shakespeare quartos, of which several are spurious.The Oxford Companion to Shakespeare, ed.
