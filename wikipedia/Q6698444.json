Consequently, in March 1868 Lucy Osburn was sent out as Lady Superintendent of the Infirmary and was accompanied by five trained nurses. Osburn won Parkes' trust and began the challenging task of cleaning up the crumbling, foul-smelling and vermin-infested Infirmary. A week after their arrival they had a royal patient, when the Duke of Edinburgh was wounded by a would-be assassin at Clontarf. They nursed him at Government House, not Sydney Hospital. In spite of the public acclaim this brought them, Lucy Osburn and her staff faced much resistance in their efforts to reform the infirmary. In addition to the appalling conditions, they met with hostility and opposition. The idea of gentlewomen working as hospital nurses was still novel, and to many people shocking. Lucy was continually obstructed by one surgeon, Dr Alfred Roberts, and personally attacked in the Parliament.A Royal Commission on public charities in 1873 condemned the Sydney Infirmary, accusing the management committee of neglect and interfering in the duties of the nurses. Osburn was vindicated and the commission praised her work toward the improvement in the standards of nursing. A number of the Lucy Osburn's Sisters took up positions as matrons at various hospitals. By these means the Nightingale teaching and standards became accepted practice in the hospital system of the colony. By the time she returned to England she had laid the foundation of modern nursing in New South Wales.", "In 1881 the Infirmary's name was changed to the Sydney Hospital. Lucy Osburn left Sydney in 1884 and returned to London. After some years nursing among the sick and poor in London, she died of diabetes at her sister's home in Harrogate on 22 December 1891.  Lucy Osburn was described by her successor at Sydney Hospital, Miss McKay, as \"an exceptional woman\" who regarded nursing \"as the highest employment\" to be entered with \"a spirit of devotion\". One of her common recommendations to those taking up the profession was reported as being \"you nurses should exist for patients, not they for you\".", "Nurse training in Australia began on site in 1868 when Florence Nightingale sent out Lucy Osburn and five other English sisters. The brick and sandstone Gothic Revival Nightingale Wing of 1869 off the central courtyard, with its colourful fountain, was built to house the female staff of the hospital with the input of Florence Nightingale.", "; About Lucy Osburn"]}, {"page": "Florence Nightingale Faculty of Nursing and Midwifery", "response": ["* Lucy Osburn, regarded as the founder of modern nursing in Australia"]}, {"page": "Somerville House", "response": ["*  Osburn \u2013 Named after Lucy Osburn"]}, {"page": "1835 in Australia", "response": ["*Lucy Osburn"]}, {"page": "List of people associated with the University of London", "response": ["* Lucy Osburn (KCL)"]}, {"page": "List of people from Leeds", "response": ["* Lucy Osburn - 19th-century nurse"]}, {"page": "List of museums in Sydney", "response": ["| Lucy Osburn \u2013 Nightingale Foundation Museum || Medical || website, life of Lucy Osburn and the founding of the Sydney Hospital"]}, {"page": "List of alumni of King's College London", "response": ["*Lucy Osburn - regarded as the founder of modern nursing in Australia"]}, {"page": "Owen Magee", "response": ["Magee had memorials erected honouring people that had played a significant part in the history of Sydney Cove, such as George Barney, William Bligh, Robert Campbell and Lucy Osburn, but opposed plans to build a monument to Jack Munday.

In retirement he did volunteer charity work, and served as Honorary Colonel Commandant of the Royal Australian Engineers. He remained active in debates on matters such as the proposed privatisation of the Snowy Mountains Authority, the Very Fast Train between Sydney and Melbourne, which he felt would be uneconomical, and the design of the Museum of Contemporary Art.
