During his career he was champion jockey 5 times (1954, '55, '56, '58, '59) finishing second on the riders' list 7 times, riding a total of 3,112 winners. In addition he was champion apprentice in 1937.\nHis first winner was a horse called Denia at Salisbury in 1932. He quickly rose to prominence and by the end of World War II was among the leading jockeys in the country.\nDoug Smith rode four classic winners - Hypericum (1,000 Guineas, 1946), Our Babu (2,000 Guineas, 1955), Pall Mall (2,000 Guineas, 1958) and Petite Etoile (1,000 Guineas, 1959) - and trained another one - Sleeping Partner (Epsom Oaks, 1969). He never won the Derby, but came third twice, first in a controversial finish on Swallow Tail in 1949, then on Acropolis in 1955.\nDoug was well known as an outstanding rider of stayers.  During his career he won the Doncaster Cup seven times, the Goodwood Cup three times, the Cesarewitch Handicap six times and the Ascot Gold Cup twice. He stated that Alycidon, winner of the Stayers' Triple Crown (rated 138 by Timeform, in the top 20 of their all-time ratings) was the best horse he ever rode.\nFor the last 21 years of his career he was retained by Lord Derby and could still ride at 7st 9lb at retirement.Doug was brother to Eph Smith (1915\u20131972), who rode 2,313 winners in a riding career spanning 1933\u20131965. Their 5,425 winners make them the most prolific riding brothers in English racing history.  In addition, he was son-in-law to Frederick N. Winter (champion apprentice in 1911) and brother-in-law of Fred Winter (multiple champion National Hunt jockey and trainer).\nIn 1989, he committed suicide by drowning himself in the swimming pool at his home in Newmarket. He was 71.There is a road named after him in Newmarket, Suffolk \"Doug Smith Close\", intersecting with \"Lester Piggott Way\". His biography, Five Times Champion, (Pelham Books, London, 1968) was written in collaboration with Peter Willett.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing", "response": ["|Doug Smith"]}, {"page": "2000 Guineas Stakes", "response": ["| Doug Smith", "| Doug Smith"]}, {"page": "Coronation Cup", "response": ["| Doug Smith"]}, {"page": "1000 Guineas Stakes", "response": ["| Doug Smith", "| Doug Smith"]}, {"page": "Epsom Oaks", "response": ["| Doug Smith"]}, {"page": "St James's Palace Stakes", "response": ["| Doug Smith", "| Doug Smith", "| Doug Smith", "| Doug Smith"]}, {"page": "Ascot Gold Cup", "response": ["| Doug Smith", "| Doug Smith"]}, {"page": "Sussex Stakes", "response": ["| Doug Smith"]}, {"page": "Middle Park Stakes", "response": ["| Doug Smith", "| Doug Smith", "| Doug Smith", "| Doug Smith", "| Doug Smith"]}, {"page": "Dewhurst Stakes", "response": ["| Doug Smith", "| Doug Smith", "| Doug Smith", "| Doug Smith"]}, {"page": "Ribblesdale Stakes", "response": ["| Doug Smith"]}, {"page": "Hardwicke Stakes", "response": ["| Doug Smith", "| Doug Smith"]}, {"page": "Lancashire Oaks", "response": ["* Doug Smith \u2013 Smoke Screen (1947), Noble Lassie (1959), Chota Hazri (1960), Irristable (1961), French Cream (1962), Royal Flirt (1966)"]}, {"page": "Goodwood Cup", "response": ["| Doug Smith", "| Doug Smith", "| Doug Smith"]}, {"page": "Great Voltigeur Stakes", "response": ["| Doug Smith"]}, {"page": "Gimcrack Stakes", "response": ["| Doug Smith", "| Doug Smith", "| Doug Smith"]}, {"page": "Doncaster Cup", "response": ["| Doug Smith", "| Doug Smith", "| Doug Smith", "| Doug Smith", "| Doug Smith", "| Doug Smith", "| Doug Smith"]}, {"page": "Yorkshire Cup (horse race)", "response": ["| Doug Smith", "| Doug Smith"]}, {"page": "List of jockeys", "response": ["* Doug Smith"]}, {"page": "Douglas Smith", "response": ["Douglas or Doug Smith may refer to:", "* Doug Smith (composer) (born 1963), American composer and pianist", "* Doug Smith (politician) (born 1967), American politician from West Virginia", "* Doug Smith (baseball) (1892\u20131973), former MLB baseball player", "* Doug Smith (baseball coach), American college baseball coach", "* Doug Smith (basketball) (born 1969), American former basketball player", "* Doug Smith (offensive lineman) (born 1956), retired NFL American football offensive lineman", "* Doug Smith (defensive lineman) (born 1960), retired NFL American football defensive lineman", "* Doug Smith (Canadian football) (born 1952), retired CFL Canadian football offensive lineman", "* Doug Smith (footballer, born 1937) (1937\u20132012), Scottish former Dundee United footballer", "* Doug Smith (footballer, born 1922) (1922\u20132009), former Australian rules footballer for Collingwood", "* Doug Smith (footballer, born 1957), former Australian rules footballer for North Melbourne", "* Doug Smith (jockey) (1917\u20131989), English flat racing jockey", "* Doug Smith (ice hockey) (born 1963), former NHL ice hockey player", "* Doug Smith (author) (born 1964), former minor-league ice hockey player and author", "* Doug Smith (sportscaster) (1920s\u20131979), Canadian radio broadcaster", "* Doug Smith (rugby union) (1924\u20131998), Scottish rugby union player and administrator"]}, {"page": "Nell Gwyn Stakes", "response": ["| Doug Smith"]}, {"page": "Fred Darling Stakes", "response": ["| Doug Smith", "| Doug Smith", "| Doug Smith"]}, {"page": "Greenham Stakes", "response": ["| Doug Smith", "| Doug Smith", "| Doug Smith", "| Doug Smith"]}, {"page": "Jersey Stakes", "response": ["| Doug Smith"]}, {"page": "British flat racing Champion Jockey", "response": ["* 1954 - Doug Smith - 129", "* 1955 - Doug Smith - 168", "* 1956 - Doug Smith - 155", "* 1958 - Doug Smith - 165", "* 1959 - Doug Smith - 157"]}, {"page": "British flat racing Champion Apprentice", "response": ["* 1937 - Doug Smith - 45"]}, {"page": "Horris Hill Stakes", "response": ["| Doug SmithTony Ingham"]}, {"page": "2,000 Guineas Trial Stakes", "response": ["| Doug Smith"]}, {"page": "Joe Mercer (jockey)", "response": ["Mercer's career total of 2,810 winners was exceeded only by Sir Gordon Richards, Lester Piggott, and Doug Smith at the time of his retirement, and subsequently only bettered by Pat Eddery (his niece's ex-husband), Willie Carson and Frankie Dettori."]}, {"page": "Doug Smith (Jockey)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Doug Smith (jockey) "]}, {"page": "Petite Etoile", "response": ["Petite Etoile began her three-year-old season in the Free Handicap over seven furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse.
