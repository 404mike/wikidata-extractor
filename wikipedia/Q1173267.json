Retrieved 17 August 2006. Jazz FM has had other jingles and slogan. The most well known was the \"Listen in Colour\" (featuring the Jazz FM chameleon) strapline, poster advertising campaign and CD in January 1997. The campaign was created by the Willox Ambler Rodford Law advertising agency. The campaign was credited with a 48% increase in RAJAR listening figures from 437,000 to 650,000 in the last quarter of 1997. Later in 2002 a poster campaign by WARL was started with the chameleon peering through a misted window with the tagline \"Come into the Cool\". Other slogans include \"The Rhythm of the City\" and afterwards, during the GMG era, \"Get It On\" created by Kitcatt Nohr Alexander Shaw, though on-air it was swiftly replaced by \"Smooth Jazz and Classic Soul\". The \u00a35 million relaunch with Manning Gottlieb over three years from 2003 brought an end to the Jazz FM chameleon because extensive research carried out by GMG Radio found that few people could associate and recall the chameleon with Jazz FM. The Bespoke Music Company created the Jazz FM jingles which were in use since 1 January 2003, until 102.2 Jazz FM was relaunched as 102.2 Smooth FM."]}, {"page": "Dave Lee", "response": ["Dave Lee may refer to:", "* Dave Lee (basketball) (born 1942), American basketball player", "* Dave Lee (chaos magician), British writer and chaos magician", "* Dave Lee (comedian) (1947\u20132012), British comedian ", "* Dave Lee (darts player) (born 1956), English former darts player", "* Dave Lee (DJ) (born 1964), British DJ, producer, and remixer often better known as Joey Negro", "* Dave Lee (horn player), British horn and Wagner tuba player associated with the Michael Nyman Band", "* Dave Lee (jazz musician) (born 1926), jazz pianist and orchestra leader"]}, {"page": "Keith Christie", "response": ["* Dave Lee, Jazz Improvisations of Our Man Crichton (Colpix, 1965)"]}, {"page": "1926 in jazz", "response": ["* 12 \u2013 Dave Lee, English pianist, orchestra leader, arranger, songwriter, and film composer.
