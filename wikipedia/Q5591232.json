She was professor of religion, culture and gender at Manchester University from 1996 until her death from cancer at the age of 57.In Becoming Divine: Towards a Feminist Philosophy of Religion, Jantzen proposed a new philosophy of religion from a feminist perspective. She also authored works on Christian mysticism and the foundations of modernity. Her approach was influenced by Continental scholarship, particularly that of Foucault.In her final publication, Foundations of Violence, Jantzen, sketches the fascination with death and violence -- what she calls a 'necrophilia' -- that she believes has characterized much of Western culture from classical antiquity through Christianity to present paradigms.  In Jantzen's view, this emphasis on violence and death comes at the expense of the physical body in the present (a denigration of the senses, sexuality and sensuality), and thus, establishes a yearning for mystical worlds beyond the here and now.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Index of philosophy articles (D\u2013H)", "response": ["* Grace Jantzen"]}, {"page": "List of philosophers born in the 20th century", "response": ["* Grace Jantzen (1948\u20132006)"]}, {"page": "List of Canadian philosophers", "response": ["*Grace Jantzen (1948-2006), Professor of Religion, Culture and Gender at Manchester University"]}, {"page": "Grace (given name)", "response": ["* Grace Jantzen (1948\u20132006), feminist philosopher and theologian"]}, {"page": "Jantzen (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Grace Jantzen (1948\u20132006), a British philosopher and theologian"]}, {"page": "List of feminist philosophers", "response": ["*Grace Jantzen"]}, {"page": "Hanneke Canters", "response": ["Canters studied Theology and Philosophy at the University of Groningen.
