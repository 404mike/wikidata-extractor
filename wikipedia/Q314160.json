He is widely known for his 14-year tenure with Celtic, where he was club captain for 11 years and won ten Scottish league championships.\nBrown started his career with Hibernian, breaking into their first team in 2002. His only trophy with Hibs was the 2006\u201307 Scottish League Cup; in that season he also won the SFWA Young Player of the Year award. In May 2007, he was transferred to Celtic for a fee of \u00a34.4 million, the highest transfer fee paid between two Scottish clubs.\nDuring Brown's time at Celtic, the club won ten Scottish championships, six Scottish Cups, and six Scottish League Cups. He has captained the club to nine consecutive championships, and successive trebles in 2016\u201317, 2017\u201318, 2018\u201319 and 2019\u201320. Individually, Brown won the PFA Scotland Players' Player of the Year award twice, in 2008\u201309 and 2017\u201318, and the Scottish Footballer of the Year award in 2017\u201318. He made more European appearances for Celtic than any other player. Brown left Celtic in June 2021, when he signed for Aberdeen and also became their assistant manager.\nBrown played for Scotland at under-19 and under-21 levels before making his full international debut in November 2005, aged 20. He did not play for Scotland again until March 2007, but then became a regular in the squad. He scored his first goal for the senior team on 5 September 2009 in a 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification win against Macedonia. In March 2016, he won his 50th cap and was inducted into Scotland's Scottish FA International Roll of Honour.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1985", "response": ["* June 25 \u2013 Scott Brown, Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "Celtic F.C.", "response": ["* \"Scott Brown brimming with enthusiasm for another season as Celtic captain\" The Scotsman. 28 June 2010.

Hibs hoped that selling the Easter Road site would allow them to clear their debts and reduce costs. Club director Rod Petrie commented that any decision would be based on financial grounds and after consultation with the fanbase, as the club were not being forced to move. Farmer expressed support for further redeveloping Easter Road, if it could be part of a viable business plan. During the consultation, Farmer said that his main priority was ensuring the club's survival and denied that any deal had been concluded. The consultation found that the fans were largely opposed to the Straiton proposal, which the club eventually abandoned. To remove part of the debt, the club sold some land to the east of the stadium that had previously been used for car parking. Selling players, including Steven Whittaker, Scott Brown, Kevin Thomson and Steven Fletcher, also funded these debts and further work."]}, {"page": "Hibernian F.C.", "response": ["Kilmarnock manager Bobby Williamson was then hired, but he proved to be unpopular with Hibs supporters. However, a string of exciting young players emerged, including Garry O'Connor, Derek Riordan, Kevin Thomson and Scott Brown. These players featured heavily as Hibs eliminated both halves of the Old Firm to reach the 2004 Scottish League Cup Final, only to lose 2\u20130 to Livingston. Williamson departed near the end of that season to manage Plymouth Argyle and was replaced by Tony Mowbray. Mowbray promised fast-flowing, passing football, with which Hibs finished third in his first season as manager, while Mowbray won the SFWA Manager of the Year award.", "Mowbray left Hibs in October 2006 to manage West Bromwich Albion, and was replaced by former player John Collins. The team won the 2007 Scottish League Cup Final under his management, but the club sold Kevin Thomson, Scott Brown and Steven Whittaker for fees totalling more than \u00a38\u00a0million. Collins resigned later that year, frustrated by the lack of funds provided to sign new players.

A win against St Johnstone in Williamson's first match in charge effectively removed the danger of relegation. Due to financial problems at the club, Williamson had to move on several senior players, but he did not endear himself to the Hibs fans. He lightheartedly joked about this relationship by referring to himself as a \"weegie hun\". Nonetheless Hibs produced several excellent young players, including Scott Brown, Derek Riordan, Garry O'Connor, Kevin Thomson and Steven Whittaker. Williamson guided his young team to the 2004 Scottish League Cup Final, but they were beaten 2\u20130 by Livingston."]}, {"page": "Darren Fletcher", "response": ["Fletcher earned his 50th cap in September 2010, in a UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying match against Liechtenstein. His bouts of illness interrupted his international career, which meant that Scott Brown assumed the captaincy.

He resumed the captaincy in September 2016, after Brown had temporarily retired from international football."]}, {"page": "Craig Levein", "response": ["On 23 December 2009, Levein left Dundee United to become the new Scotland manager. He agreed to a -year deal. Scotland won 1\u20130 in his first match in charge, a friendly against the Czech Republic, with the goal coming from Celtic captain Scott Brown. However, his second game in charge would not be as successful, with Scotland going down 3\u20130 to Sweden on 12 August 2010. This was also followed by a disappointing 0\u20130 draw with Lithuania and an unconvincing 2\u20131 victory over Liechtenstein in the first two Euro 2012 qualifying matches."]}, {"page": "Chris Hogg", "response": ["Hogg initially struggled to establish himself in the Hibernian first team, but he started to win a regular place from January 2007 under the management of John Collins. He played in the 2007 Scottish League Cup Final against Kilmarnock, which Hibernian won 5\u20131. Hogg formed a solid defensive partnership with the captain Rob Jones, and in June 2007 he signed a contract with Hibernian until June 2011. Hogg was made vice-captain at the start of the 2007\u201308 season following the departure of Scott Brown to Celtic. Hogg was voted the club's Player of the Year by both the fans and his fellow players at the end of the 2007\u201308 season."]}]}}
