A century later the London-based Magazine of Art could describe Birmingham as \"perhaps the most artistic town in England\", and the changes that would result in this transformation had already started by the 1780s. A local trade directory of 1785 lists twenty four professional artists, including the portraitist James Millar, the still life painter Moses Haughton and the portrait miniature painter James Bisset. Of widest influence was the Birmingham School of engravers \u2013 a separate group to the landscape artists but emerging similarly from the drawing academies of Joseph Barber, Vincent Barber and Samuel Lines. Formed around the younger Barber's pupils William Radclyffe, James Tibbitts Willmore and John Pye, and Lines' pupil William Wyon, this group were to dominate high-quality European printmaking in the 1850s and 1860s and revolutionise the art of book illustration, bringing contemporary art to a much wider public than ever before.; ; "]}, {"page": "Edward Scriven", "response": ["A portrait of Scriven, painted by Andrew Morton, was engraved by Benjamin Phelps Gibbon as an illustration to John Pye's Patronage of British Art."]}, {"page": "Henry Behnes", "response": ["*Bust of John Pye (1831) now in the National Portrait Gallery, London"]}, {"page": "Birmingham School (engravers)", "response": ["* John Pye"]}, {"page": "Walter Field", "response": ["He was the youngest son of Edwin Wilkins Field by his second wife, Letitia Kinder, and was born at Windmill Hill, Hampstead, on 1 December 1837.
