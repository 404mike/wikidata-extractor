Batting once in the match, he was dismissed without scoring in the Oxford first-innings by Frank Farrands. After graduating from Oxford, he was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Huntingdon Militia. He was promoted to captain in March 1880 and the following year in July he was appointed as a justice of the peace for Huntingdonshire. By 1886, Beart was serving with the King's Royal Rifle Corps and in April of that year he was promoted to major. He died at Godmanchester in March 1895. His son, Charles, also played first-class cricket."]}]}}
