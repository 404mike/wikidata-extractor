Johnny scored five goals, set up two and scored a six-minute hat-trick. Summers later revealed that he changed his boots at half-time after his old pair had started falling apart.Johnny Summers played for Norwich City, Fulham and Millwall, prior to his Charlton career. He made his debut for Millwall in 1955 in the opening match of the 1955\u201356 season, against Brighton and Hove Albion, in front of a 25,000 plus crowd at The Den. In a 2\u20130 win, he disappointed the fickle crowd and after a few weeks disappeared into the Reserves, surfacing again the following January, as a left winger. From that time, he never looked back, and was one of the most fearsome and lethal forwards seen at The Den in years. His transfer to Charlton Athletic, for their last season in the old First Division, was regretted by Millwall fans, but seen as inevitable.\nHe died at the age of just 34 in 1962 of cancer.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Charlton Athletic F.C.", "response": ["|Most hat-tricks || Johnny Summers and Eddie Firmani (8)"]}, {"page": "Summers (surname)", "response": ["* Johnny Summers (footballer) (1927\u20131962), footballer for Charlton Athletic", "* Johnny Summers (boxer) (1882\u20131946), English boxer"]}, {"page": "Ken Taylor (cricketer, born 1935)", "response": ["He joined the groundstaff at Huddersfield Town after leaving school in 1950, and made 250 first-team appearances for them from 1953 to 1965, before playing for Bradford (Park Avenue) from 1965 to 1967, playing as a centre half.
