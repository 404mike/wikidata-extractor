He was released without making his league debut at the end of the following season, joining Torquay United in August 1991. He made his debut on the opening day of the following season, playing in Torquay's 3\u20131 win at home to Hartlepool United. He played in the following game, a 3\u20130 defeat away to Preston North End, but was substituted and replaced by Paul Holmes for the next game. He established himself in the second half of the season, but was only on the bench as the 1992\u201393 season began. Three games into the season he dislodged Arron Davis from the Torquay side and had a run in the side at left-back. He began the following season as first choice at left-back in the Torquay side and played 27 times as Torquay reached the play-offs, losing in controversial circumstances against Preston North End. He played just ten times in the 1994\u201395 season, kept out of the Torquay side by Scott Stamps and then Gregory Goodridge, and was released at the end of the season.\nHe joined Doncaster Rovers, along with fellow Torquay players Duane Darby and Darren Moore, on a free transfer in July 1995. His two seasons at Doncaster were plagued by injuries and he was released in May 1997 having played only 42 times (scoring 3 goals) for Rovers. He joined Telford United on 18 July 1997, but struggled to establish himself in their Conference side. He moved on to Stourbridge on a free transfer the following summer and then to Blakenall during the 1999\u20132000 season. In June 2000, he left Blakenall to join Redditch United and despite being linked with Bromsgrove Rovers the following close season remained with Redditch for the start of the 2001\u201302 season. He was revealed to be involved with Sky Sports presenter and Torquay United fan Helen Chamberlain in September 2001.He was released by Redditch in January 2002 and joined Willenhall Town the following week. He struggled with injuries over an 18-month spell, but returned to the side for the start of the 2004\u201305 season.After a series of injuries he attempted to resume his football career and played one cup game for Chasetown in the 2007\u201308 season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Darren Moore", "response": ["Moore arrived at Doncaster with Torquay teammates Scott Colcombe and Duane Darby.  He appeared in the first game of the season, a home victory against Scarborough om 12 August. His first goal came in a draw at Barnet on 4 November that season. Altogether Moore played 84 games and scored 8 goals in his two seasons at Belle Vue."]}, {"page": "Gregory Goodridge", "response": ["He made his debut as a substitute in the 1\u20131 draw away to Bury and soon dislodged Scott Colcombe from the side, playing eight times that season, scoring once. He became both a regular and a crowd favourite the following year with his runs with the ball and occasional long-range shooting. He moved to Queens Park Rangers in August 1995 for a fee of \u00a3250,000, but struggled to settle at Loftus Road, only appearing in the league as a substitute on seven occasions, scoring once."]}, {"page": "Pat O'Toole (footballer)", "response": ["In August 1993 he joined Torquay United, making his debut in midfield as Torquay lost on penalties in the League Cup to Hereford United, with his league debut at right-back in place of Lee Barrow in the 2-1 win away to Darlington on 28 August. He switched to left-back, in place of Scott Colcombe, with Barrow restored at right-back, for the next game, a 1-1 draw at home to Carlisle United and played in the following game, a 3-3 draw at home to Colchester United in which Adrian Foster scored a hat-trick. However, these were his only games for Torquay and he left, joining Bridgnorth Town."]}]}}
