His impressive display in the first team lead to being praised by Manager Dean Smith, who gave him a nickname as 'Mr Reliable'. Then on 5 November 2011, Sadler provided assist for Jamie Paterson, in a 1\u20131 draw against Huddersfield Town to end three games without a point. However, in a 1\u20131 draw against Charlton Athletic on 10 December 2011, Sadler was sent\u2013off after a second bookable offence in a last minutes and missed a match in the FA Cup second round replay against Dagenham & Redbridge, which saw Walsall lost in a penalty\u2013shootout. Despite the suspension, Sadler remained in the first team and then scored his first goal for Walsall on 27 March 2012, in a 3\u20131 win over Colchester United in what BBC Sport described as \"breaking one of football's longer droughts in his 193rd league game (also 222nd in all appearance\".

After the match, Brandy suffered a hamstring injury that saw him sidelined for a month. Brandy made his return from injury, coming on as a late substitute, in a 2\u20131 win over AFC Bournemouth on 29 September 2012. After making a slow start without scoring, Brandy finally scored his first goal for the club (and his first goal in English Football since late-2009) in a 2\u20132 draw against Crawley Town on 17 November 2012. Brandy continued to impress the club when he made a double assist for Jamie Paterson and Will Grigg in a 2\u20132 draw against Yeovil Town on 15 December 2012. This was followed by scoring a winner in a 1\u20130 win over Colchester United; and then scoring an equaliser and then set up a goal for Paterson, for the third goal, in a 4\u20132 win over Milton Keynes Dons. After serving a one match, he scored his fourth goal on his return on 4 January 2013, coming in Walsall's televised league match on Sky Sports against Portsmouth and set up a goal for Grigg, in a 2\u20130 win. This was followed up by scoring his fifth goal for the club, in a 3\u20131 win over Preston North End. Due to his goalscoring form, Brandy said he proved the critics wrong by placing 14th, 14 points clear of the relegation zone. However, he was sent\u2013off for a second bookable offence, in a 3\u20131 win over Bournemouth on 19 January 2013. After returning from suspension, Brandy scored his sixth goal of the season, in a 2\u20131 win over Doncaster Rovers on 9 February 2013. For his performance, he was nominated for nPower League One Player of the Month Award for February 2013 but lost out to Peter Hartley. In addition, Walsall opened talks with Brandy over a new contract. Brandy broke his three months goal drought when he scored in a 1\u20131 draw against Bury on 20 April 2013.

The game ended 2\u20131 to Stevenage, coming back from a first-half deficit to take all three points. Former Stevenage loanee, Chuks Aneke, had given Crewe the lead with a calm side-footed effort mid-way through the first period. Stevenage replied twice within the space of five second-half minutes; first Lucas Akins tapped in Anthony Grant's centre, before Akins' flick-on gave Marcus Haber room to run and slide the ball through Steve Phillips' legs in the Crewe goal. A week later, on 12 January, Stevenage's bad home form continued when they lost 2\u20131 to promotion chasing Doncaster Rovers. Doncaster, without a manager at the time of the game due to Dean Saunders leaving for Wolverhampton Wanderers, scored twice late-on to secure victory after Stevenage had led through James Dunne's powerful half-volley. The defeat meant that Stevenage were without a home win in six league matches. Stevenage's scheduled away game against Bury on 19 January was postponed as a result of heavy snowfall in the days leading up to the fixture. The Gigg Lane pitch failed an 11:30am inspection a day before the match was due to be played."]}, {"page": "Jamie Paterson", "response": ["Jamie Paterson may refer to:", "*Jamie Paterson (footballer, born 1973), Scottish footballer", "*Jamie Paterson (footballer, born 1991), English footballer"]}]}}
