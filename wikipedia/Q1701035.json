In the late 1970s, mathematicians John McKay and John Thompson noticed that certain numbers arising in the analysis of the monster group (namely, the dimensions of its irreducible representations) are related to numbers that appear in a formula for the -function (namely, the coefficients of its Fourier series).Gannon, p. 4 This relationship was further developed by John Horton Conway and Simon Norton who called it monstrous moonshine because it seemed so far fetched.Gannon, p. 5"]}, {"page": "J-invariant", "response": ["More remarkably, the Fourier coefficients for the positive exponents of  are the dimensions of the graded part of an infinite-dimensional graded algebra representation of the monster group  called the moonshine module \u2013 specifically, the coefficient of  is the dimension of grade- part of the moonshine module, the first example being the Griess algebra, which has dimension 196,884, corresponding to the term .

Firstly, the extended Dynkin diagrams \\tilde E_6, \\tilde E_7, \\tilde E_8 (corresponding to tetrahedral, octahedral, and icosahedral symmetry) have symmetry groups S_3, S_2, S_1, respectively, and the associated foldings are the diagrams \\tilde G_2, \\tilde F_4, \\tilde E_8 (note that in less careful writing, the extended (tilde) qualifier is often omitted). More significantly, McKay suggests a correspondence between the nodes of the \\tilde E_8 diagram and certain conjugacy classes of the monster group, which is known as McKay's E8 observation;Arithmetic groups and the affine E8 Dynkin diagram, by John F. Duncan, in Groups and symmetries: from Neolithic Scots to John McKay see also monstrous moonshine.
