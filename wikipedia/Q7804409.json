He was a right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium-pace bowler who played for Derbyshire between 1992 and 1999, and for Staffordshire in 2000.\nHe made his debut for Derbyshire in a loss against Glamorgan, though, playing as a lower-middle order batsman, he barely disgraced himself, being caught at 24.\nHe did not play first-class cricket again until the 1995 season, spending all of 1993 and a significant portion of 1994 in the Second XI. A slow starter upon his return, he excelled in the 1997 season, where he hit his debut first-class century, before making a career-best score of 189, and finishing high in the batting averages for the season. During his high-scoring innings, Kim Barnett partnered him to a county record second-wicket stand of 417, a record which stands to this day.\nIn 2000 Tweats played for Staffordshire.\nTweats is currently head of Business and IT at Alleyne's Academy since becoming Deputy in 2017. \nHe is the father of regional gymnast Milana Tweats and young naturalist and Celtic Reptile & Amphibian founder, Harvey-Jay Tweats.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Derbyshire first-class cricket records", "response": ["| 2nd || 417 ||  Kim Barnett Tim Tweats || v Yorkshire || Derby || 1997"]}, {"page": "Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1997", "response": ["The team set two partnership records during the season - the second wicket partnership of 417 by Kim Barnett and Tim Tweats against Yorkshire and the third wicket partnership of 316* by Adrian Rollins and Kim Barnett against Leicestershire."]}]}}
