He played a major part in founding The Retreat at Lamel Hill in York for treating mental-health needs. Tuke and his wife Esther Maud supported strict adherence to Quaker principles.

In the Western world, the arrival of institutionalisation as a solution to the problem of madness was very much an advent of the nineteenth century. The first public mental asylums were established in Britain; the passing of the County Asylums Act 1808 empowered magistrates to build rate-supported asylums in every county to house the many 'pauper lunatics'. Nine counties first applied, the first public asylum opening in 1812 in Nottinghamshire. In 1828, the newly appointed Commissioners in Lunacy were empowered to license and supervise private asylums. The Lunacy Act 1845 made the construction of asylums in every county compulsory with regular inspections on behalf of the Home Secretary, and required asylums to have written regulations and a resident physician.Unsworth, Clive.\"Law and Lunacy in Psychiatry's 'Golden Age'\", Oxford Journal of Legal Studies.

A common belief at the time was that the mad were wild beasts.Stanley, J. (2010). Inner night and inner light: A Quaker model of pastoral care for the mentally ill. Journal of Religion and Health, 49(4), 547\u201359. doi:10.1007/s10943-009-9312-4 The recommended medical practices included debilitating purges, painful blistering, long-term immobilisation by manacles, and sudden immersion in cold baths \u2013 all administered in regimes of fear, terror and brutality. But the Quakers maintained that the humanity and inner light of a person could never be extinguished. A trigger was the death in 1790 of a Quaker, Hannah Mills, a few weeks after she had been admitted to the York Asylum (now known as Bootham Park Hospital). She was not allowed to have any visitation. The asylum had not let her friends or family visit her. This situation brought several concerns about the condition of Hannah's death. Therefore, this led William Tuke to think about The Retreat as a place where people should be treated equally. However, visiting afterwards to investigate the conditions, the Quakers found that the patients were treated worse than animals.Samuel, B.

The work was taken on by other Quakers, including Tuke's son Henry Tuke who co-founded The Retreat, and Samuel Tuke who helped popularise the approach which convince physicians to adopt it in his 1813, book Description of The Retreat near York. His book explained in detail about the approach to use the moral treatment method for restoring the self-esteem, and self-control in individual with mental issues. In doing so, Samuel Tuke popularised his use of the term moral treatment that he had borrowed from the French \"traitement moral\" being used to describe the work of Pussin and Pinel in France (and in the original French referring to morale in the sense of the emotions and self-esteem, rather than rights and wrongs). The term came to refer to a number of moves towards more humane approaches that occurred toward the end of the 18th century in the context of Enlightenment thinking, including also the work of Vincenzo Chiarugi in Italy.
