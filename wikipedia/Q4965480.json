He would later return to Springfield Park as the coach of the Zambia national team, who Wigan played a friendly against in October 1978.He then moved to America to join the Portland Timbers, originally as a player before joining the coaching staff.\nIn 1980, he became assistant manager to Ron Newman at the Miami Americans in the franchise's only year of existence. After nine games, Newman quit to take over as coach at the San Diego Sockers, and Brian Tiler stepped up to become Head Coach until the team's demise at the end of the season.\nTiler later became managing director at AFC Bournemouth, where he helped engineer Bournemouth's first ever promotion to the Second Division in 1986\u201387 along with his friend, team manager Harry Redknapp. In June 1990, Tiler was killed in a car accident in Italy, when a car collided head on with the minibus in which Tiler and Redknapp were travelling.Redknapp was also badly injured in the accident, but survived and went on to make a full recovery.

Travelling through Latina, south of Rome, at night, their chauffeur-driven minibus was in a head-on collision with a car containing three Italian soldiers. The minibus was flipped onto its roof and skidded 50 yards along the road. Sitting in the seat where Redknapp had usually sat during the trip, Tiler was killed, as were the three occupants of the other vehicle. Redknapp was doused in petrol and pulled clear of the accident by Sinclair. Redknapp suffered a fractured skull, a broken nose, cracked ribs and a gash in his left leg. Ambulance services arriving at the scene believed him dead and placed a blanket over his head. Unconscious for two days, Redknapp was flown home two weeks later in a special air ambulance paid for by Bournemouth. Though he made a full recovery, apart from losing his sense of smell and gaining a facial tic, he eventually quit Bournemouth at the end of the 1991\u201392 season."]}, {"page": "Zambia national football team", "response": ["* Brian Tiler (1978\u201380)"]}, {"page": "1989\u201390 in English football", "response": ["* 30 June 1990 \u2013 Brian Tiler, 47, who played for Aston Villa during the 1970s and was a director for AFC Bournemouth from the mid-1980s, was killed in a car crash in Italy.
