Having considered demolishing the buildings and redeveloping the land, the MDHB soon entered negotiations to sell the land to Oldham Estates, a property developer owned by Harry Hyams. Many plans for the site were developed including one that envisioned the development of a mini city that would provide 10m sq feet of letting space, hotels, restaurants, bars and underground parking in the drained dock basin. With the council reluctant to allow such a grandiose development to occur and with the huge public opposition to it (inspired at least in part by the work of Quentin Hughes), Oldham Estates were forced into scaling-down the plan and so in 1970 returned with a new vision known as \"Aquarius City\", which had as its centrepiece a 44-storey skyscraper. Once again the plan failed to develop and no sooner had it been announced, than the MDHB's financial problems reached crisis point, Oldham Estates withdrew their deposit and the whole scheme fell through."]}, {"page": "Stephen Bayley", "response": ["He was later educated at Manchester University and the University of Liverpool School of Architecture, where his mentor was the historian and conservationist Quentin Hughes, whose obituary he wrote in The Guardian, 16 May 2004."]}, {"page": "Fortress Study Group", "response": ["The Fortress Study Group was formed in June 1975 at Pembroke College, Oxford amongst the founders were Jock Hamilton-Baillie, who became chairman in 1976, the late Quentin Hughes was the founding editor of the annual journal, and his Royal Highness the Duke of Gloucester remains as patron.

By the 13th century, a single-story house had been built, and eventually a synagogue existed on the site.

Changes to the fa\u00e7ade, including a shift in the orientation of the building as well as the addition of a double serrated string course and the hood mould framing the main doorway were completed at this point.

Gowans concludes that, \"however scattered the research, it is there; no one will ever be able to write about Canadian culture again without consulting No Mean City, nor will anyone who has read it be able to walk Toronto streets again without its coming to mind.\" In her 1982 obituary of Arthur, architecture critic Adele Freedman reflects that much of the writing in the book \"is quite sloppy,\" but advises readers, \"don't forget, he began all this....
