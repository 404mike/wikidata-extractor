His parents were Thomas and Elizabeth Davies. He began his career as a solicitor, and is known by the age of 24 to have been working for a practice in Newcastle Emlyn. In 1825 he married Anne, a daughter of John Lloyd of Allt-yr-odyn, and thus inherited her family estate. One of Anne's ancestors had been a David Lloyd (\"David ap Llewellin Lloid\") who was MP for Cardiganshire in the sixteenth century. John Lloyd Davies himself was descended from another of the Lloyd family of Castell-Howel to which his wife belonged.Following his first wife's death, he was re-married in 1857 to Elizabeth Bluett, the only child of Thomas Bluett Hardwicke of Tytherington Grange, Gloucestershire, supposedly a descendant of Bess of Hardwick. He served as a J.P. and D.L. for the Cardiganshire and Carmarthenshire districts, and in 1845 was appointed High Sheriff of Cardiganshire. Between 1855 and 1857 he was the elected Conservative M.P. for the Cardiganshire boroughs. In 1857 he was opposed by Captain Edward Pryse of Gogerddan who, although with little political experience was expected to receive support because of his family connections. Within a week Davies had withdrawn from the contest.Later in 1857 a vacancy arose for the representation of Carmarthenshire following the death of D.A. Saunders Davies. Lloyd Davies immediately issued an address, within days of the former member's death. His candidacy was fiercely opposed, most notably in radical journals such as the Amserau. He withdrew when it became apparent that David Pugh had considerable support in the county.He was notably a chief opposer of the Rebecca rioters in the Llandysul district, and campaigner for the construction of the railway from Carmarthen to Llandysul.\n Although he had some sympathy for the rioters' cause, he attempted to deter them from violence, and death threats were made against him as a result.He died at Blaendyffryn on 21 March 1860. His son, Arthur Lloyd Davies, assumed the surname \"Lloyd\" in accordance with the will of Davies Lloyd, the brother of John Lloyd Davies's first wife, Anne. Arthur died in 1852, and John Lloyd Davies's heir was Arthur's son, John Davies-Lloyd (born 1850).\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sir Thomas Lloyd, 1st Baronet", "response": ["Lloyd was mentioned as a possible candidate for Cardigan Boroughs at the 1857 General Election, in opposition to John Lloyd Davies who had unexpectedly captured the seat at the 1855 by-election.

Although Pryse had little political experience, his connection with the family based at Gogerddan was considered to be a considerable advantage.

His opponent's father, D.A. Saunders Davies, had previously served as MP for Carmarthenshire until his death in 1857. Powell was successful despite the fact that his opponent had the support of the majority of the county's landed gentry, most of whom were located in the south of the county. This was demonstrated by the fact that in the Cardigan district, Davies had a substantial majority. However, in Aberystwyth district, the northern part of the county, where Nanteos was located, Powell won by an even more decisive margin Both candidates were said to hold similar political views and Powell sat in Parliamnent as a Liberal-Conservative, The fact that he was supported by the former Conservative MP for Cardigan Boroughs, John Lloyd Davies, demonstrates that Powell was hardly a radical candidate."]}, {"page": "1857 Carmarthenshire by-election", "response": ["John Lloyd Davies, who had stood down as member for Cardigan Boroughs at the recent election, having faced certain defeat when opposed by Edward Pryse, was first in the field.

However, it was soon rumoured that David Pugh had the support of a large proportion of the county gentry.", "On 3 June, Charles Bishop convened a meeting at the Ivy Bush Hotel in Carmarthen to choose a candidate. The meeting was chaired by Sir John Mansel and addressed by two of the aspirants, John Lloyd Davies and Sir James Hamilton. David Pugh was not present and it was unclear whether he would abide by the decision of the meeting. Howel Gwyn, former MP for Falmouth, was also mentioned but had little support. A lengthy discussion ensued, which ended with Pugh being omitted from a ballot in which John Lloyd Davies secured a majority over Sir James Hamilton."]}]}}
