In 1929, Arthur scored a try for Wales at the Cardiff Arms Park and three French players were knocked out in the tackle to save the try. The next year at a game at the Stade Colombes, the mood and the match turned nasty with the French using fist and boot to subdue the Welsh team. The trouble started when Welsh full back Tommy Scourfield cleared a loose ball to touch only for the chasing French player to run over and punch him. Arthur and fellow second row, Aberavon's Ned Jenkins had to pack down in the front row due to the oversized French props, and after one scrummage, Welsh hooker Bert Day was kicked in the mouth by a French lock and required nine stitches. Arthur retaliated on the French pack, but mistook one of the props for the offending lock. This escalated into running fist fights throughout the match, and when Wales left the pitch, they were pelted by rubber cushions from the crowd."]}, {"page": "Thomas Scourfield", "response": ["#REDIRECT Tommy Scourfield"]}, {"page": "1937\u201338 Yorkshire Cup", "response": ["|Charles \"Charlie\" Eaton||1||Tommy Scourfield"]}, {"page": "Scourfield", "response": ["*Tommy Scourfield (1909\u20131976), Welsh rugby player"]}, {"page": "1932\u201333 Challenge Cup", "response": ["|1|| Tommy Scourfield"]}, {"page": "1934\u201335 Challenge Cup", "response": ["|1|| Tommy Scourfield"]}]}}
