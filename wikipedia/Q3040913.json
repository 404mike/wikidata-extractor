After his military service with the Royal Navy he taught at Oxford and then worked for various UN institutions. He was the director of the Institute of Development Studies at the University of Sussex from 1967 till 1972.Seers is famous for replacing the \"growth fetishism\" of the early postwar period with a greater concern for social development. He stressed the relativistic nature of judgements about development and questioned the value of the neoclassical approach to economics.Writing on the Criteria for Development Nixon Reports, Seers argument that \"Surely the values we need are staring us in the face, as soon as we ask ourselves: what are the necessary conditions for a universally accepted aim, the realization of the potential of human personality?\"(Seers in Baster). Assuming that the aim and yardstick of development is implied by this, Seers goes on to identify a number of objectives for development for developing countries:\n\nThat family incomes should be adequate to provide a subsistence package of food, shelter, clothing, and footwear.\nThat jobs should be available to all family heads, not only because this will ensure that distribution of income will generally achieve subsistence consumption levels, but also because a job is something without which personality cannot develop.\nThat access to education should be increased and literacy ratios raised.\nThat the populace should be given an opportunity to participate in government.\nThat national independence should be achieved in the sense that the views of other governments do not largely predetermine one's own government's decisions.  (Nixon in Colman and Nixon Economics of Change in Less Developed Countries)There is explicitly in Seers a sequent aspect to this. As progress is made towards the economic goals, that is 'undernourishment, unemployment and inequality dwindle'.. 'educational and political aims become increasingly important objectives of development'.", "link_mentions": {}}}
