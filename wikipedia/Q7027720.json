A cool Sone Aluko provided the Dons' with the class they needed to scrape past a spirited Alloa side. On form striker Lee Miller opened the scoring after he deflected Chris Maguire's shot. Alloa midfielder Andy Scott scored from the penalty spot to equalise for the hosts. Aluko raced clear and chipped the ball over the advancing keeper Raymond Jellema in the 56th minute. Alloa pushed forward for much of the last half-hour, but Aberdeen survived to progress. In the fifth-round, Aberdeen were then drawn at home against another Second Division team, East Fife. The game ended in a comfortable 5\u20130 victory, with the East Fife goalkeeper sent off in the first three minutes. Goals from Tommy Wright, Javan Vidal, Sone Aluko and a late chris Maguire double sealed the win for Aberdeen, earning them an away tie at Dunfermline Athletic. Sone Aluko looked to have put Aberdeen through to a semi-final when he finished neatly midway through the second half. However Nick Phinn scored with just five minutes remaining, to force a reply at Pittodrie. The replay proved to be a night to forget. A highly disappointing display saw 120 minutes of no goals, and very little activity. Dunfermline eventually won the game on penalties, Scott Severin and Richard Foster were the only players to have missed which sent the Dons' out."]}, {"page": "Nick Phinn (footballer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Nick Phinn"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Dunfermline Athletic F.C. season", "response": ["| Nick Phinn"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Stenhousemuir F.C. season", "response": ["|||MF||Nick Phinn"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Dunfermline Athletic F.C. season", "response": ["| Nick Phinn"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Stranraer F.C. season", "response": ["|||MF||Nick Phinn", "| Nick Phinn"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Dumbarton F.C. season", "response": ["|||MF||Nick Phinn", "|  Nick Phinn"]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 Dumbarton F.C. season", "response": ["|  Nick Phinn"]}]}}
