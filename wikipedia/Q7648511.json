She was science editor of the BBC's Newsnight programme, from January 1995 to November 2013.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "David Kelly (weapons expert)", "response": ["On 7 May 2003 Kelly was telephoned by Susan Watts, the science editor of the BBC's Newsnight programme; the call lasted 15 to 20 minutes. They discussed various matters relating to Iraq including, towards the end of the conversation, the matter of the 45-minute claim. Watts's handwritten shorthand notes showed Kelly stated the claim was \"a mistake to put in. Alastair Campbell seeing something in there, single source but not corroborated, sounded good.\" The pair also had a subsequent call on 12 May.", "Kelly was questioned by the Liberal Democrat MP David Chidgey about conversations with Susan Watts. It was the first time her name had been connected with Kelly in public, and it was later established that Gilligan had not only sent Chidgey excerpts from a recorded conversation, but also gave Chidgey questions to ask Kelly. The quote included Kelly's opinion on the 45 minute claim. Chidgey asked Kelly if the quotes came from the meeting he had with Watts in November 2002\u2014the only time the pair had met face-to-face; Kelly replied that \"I cannot believe that on that occasion I made that statement\". According to Goslett, this was a truthful statement, as Kelly had not made the statement in November 2002, but on 30 May that year. Mangold notes that Kelly appeared to be under stress during the interview, and that some of the questioning was overtly hostile. One MP, Andrew MacKinlay, questioned Kelly towards the end of the session:", "During the course of the day Kelly received a phone call that changed his mood. Mangold states that \"most likely explanation is that he learned from a well-meaning friend at the Ministry of Defence that the BBC had tape-recorded evidence which, when published, would show that he had indeed said the things to Susan Watts that he had formally denied saying\". Mrs Kelly was ill that day and spent some time lying down in the couple's bedroom, but she got up at 3:00\u00a0pm to find Kelly speaking on the phone, before she returned to her bedroom to sleep. Goslett thinks this phone call is likely to have been with Clark, in a discussion about one of the answers to the parliamentary questions. Kelly left for a walk between 3:00 and 3:20\u00a0pm and was last seen by Ruth Absalom, a neighbour, with whom he stopped to have a chat. She was the last person known to have seen him alive. Clark tried to contact Kelly at home\u2014where Mrs Kelly told him that her husband had gone for a walk\u2014and then on Kelly's mobile, which was switched off; Clark stated he was surprised it was off as Kelly was normally easily contactable."]}, {"page": "Newsnight", "response": ["*Susan Watts (Science Editor)"]}, {"page": "Hutton Inquiry", "response": ["These reports were aired by Andrew Gilligan on BBC Radio 4's Today programme on 29 May 2003, by Gavin Hewitt on the Ten O'Clock News the same day and by Susan Watts on BBC Two's Newsnight on 2 June. On 1 June, Gilligan repeated his allegations in an article written for The Mail on Sunday, naming government press secretary Alastair Campbell as the driving force for alteration of the dossier. ", "Despite this evidence, Hutton's report largely cleared the government of any wrongdoing. In large measure this was because Hutton judged that the government had not known of the reservations in the intelligence community: it seemed they had been discounted by senior intelligence assessors (the Joint Intelligence Committee) \u2014 thus Gilligan's claim that the government \"probably knew\" the intelligence was flawed, was itself unfounded. Furthermore, the Inquiry heard that these were not the words used by Gilligan's source, but Gilligan's own inference. However, the judgement that No. 10 was not aware of the reservations of the intelligence community was not supported by other evidence contained in the report, such as the transcript of an interview given by David Kelly to BBC journalist Susan Watts. In addition to clearing the government, Hutton determined that any failure of intelligence assessments fell outside his remit, and the Intelligence Services thus also escaped censure."]}, {"page": "Hugh Everett III", "response": ["*Are we closer to a 'theory of everything'?
