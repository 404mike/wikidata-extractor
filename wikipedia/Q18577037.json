Born in Arklow, Ireland on April 28, 1875, she became a Junior Assistant Mistress at 17 and taught in Essex, England. On December 2, 1902, she left to begin missionary work in Nsambya, Uganda, working as a Franciscan Sister of Saint Mary's Abbey, Mill Hill, London. \nIn 1952 Kearney founded the Franciscan Missionary Sisters for Africa. Kearney's work in East Africa resulted in the formation of multiple hospitals and training of nurses throughout the region. Her name serves as the root of the word Kevina, which means \"hospital\" or \"charity institute\" in Uganda. On November 6, 2016, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Lugazi opened her formal beatification process, securing her the title Servant of God.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Third Order of Saint Francis", "response": ["Motherhouse in Dundalk, Ireland.
