He wrote de la Tromba, a fine broken consort piece which has several professional recordings and first became well known due to the Julian Bream Consort.\nHe was known to be in the service of the Countess of Warwick in 1599, and then working for Sir John Scudamore. His publications are: The Psalms of David in Meter (1599) and An Hour's Recreation in musicke, apt for instruments and voyces (1606). His work also appears in Michael East's and Thomas Ravenscroft's psalters, and Thomas Morley's broken consort publication.\nHe referred in the dedication of his Psalmes to the late Ambrose Dudley, 3rd Earl of Warwick as 'my good Lord and Master'. Allison is represented by thirteen compositions in a set of consort books (dated 1588), from the household of Sir Francis Walsingham. Ten four-part settings by him appeared in East's Whole Booke of Psalms (1592), and he contributed a dedicatory poem to Giles Farnaby's Canzonets to Fowre Voyces (1598).In 1599, he published his own Psalmes of David in Meter, giving his London address as Dukes Place, near Aldgate, and describing himself as a 'gentleman' and a 'practitioner' of music. This print also includes his coat of arms, providing much information about his family. In the same year, seven of his instrumental works appeared without attribution in Morley's First Booke of Consort Lessons (claims that Allison may have been the 'gentleman' who financed the publication remain unsubstantiated and seem improbable).\nIn 1606, he published An Howres Recreation in Musicke, acknowledging Sir John Scudamore (of Holme Lacy, near Hereford) as his patron. He is not heard of again, and may well have been dead by the time of Philip Rosseter's Lessens for Consort (1609) which includes four of his compositions, together with the information that most of the contents are by composers 'whose memorie only remaines'.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Walter Raleigh", "response": ["A galliard was composed in honour of Raleigh by either Francis Cutting or Richard Allison."]}, {"page": "List of Baroque composers", "response": ["* Richard Allison (1560/1570\u2013before 1610)"]}, {"page": "List of Renaissance composers", "response": ["*Richard Allison (c. 1560/1570\u2013before 1610)"]}, {"page": "Broken consort", "response": ["Two manuscript sets of partbooks dating from 1588 and ca. 1590 are the earliest substantial sources of music for this consort.

The later set of partbooks was copied by Matthew Holmes, and is known both as the Holmes Consort Books and as the Cambridge Consort Books, because they are deposited in the Cambridge University Library. There are also individual parts from consorts found in various other manuscripts, most notably the \"Browne bandora book\", which contains the bandora parts to 35 consort pieces. There are also twenty-five surviving compositions for this type of consort by several composers in a collection published by Thomas Morley (1599/1611). There were a number of other consort compositions published by Philip Rosseter (1609), and some vocal music accompanied by this specific consort was published in collections such as William Leighton's The Teares and Lamentatacions of a Sorrowfull Soule (1614) and the Psalms of David in Metre (1599) by Richard Allison."]}, {"page": "1599 in music", "response": ["*Richard Allison \u2013 The psalmes of David in meter"]}, {"page": "1606 in music", "response": ["*Richard Allison \u2013 An howres recreation in Musicke, apt for instruments and voyces (London: John Windet)"]}, {"page": "Richard Day (printer)", "response": ["Little is known about Day's activities in his later years.

Morley's pick of Barley as an assignee (rather than experienced printers such as East or Peter Short, both of whom had previously worked with Morley) is surprising. Morley may have been looking for help in challenging the metrical psalter patent of Richard Day and his assignees. At that time, East and Short were stationers, and the Stationers' Company was actively enforcing the Day monopoly. Barley, however, was not a stationer, and in 1599 he and Morley published The Whole Booke of Psalmes and Richard Allison's Psalmes of David in Metre.Smith 92\u201393 The former was a small pocket edition that was largely based on East's 1592 publication of the same name. This work, although pirated and filled with small errors, provides some evidence of Barley's editorial skill; musicologist Robert Illing notes that if Barley \"is to be discredited for roguery, he must also be applauded for his strokes of musical imagination\" for successfully compressing such a large work into a pocket-sized production.Illing 223 In Allison's work, the two claimed that they had exclusive rights on the metrical psalter. Duly provoked, Day sued.
