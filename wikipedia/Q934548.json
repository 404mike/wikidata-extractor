For this reason, Strachan immediately inserted Nakamura into the match day lineup for the second league game of the season against Dundee United on 6 August, despite Nakamura not being match fit as he had not played since the Confederations Cup earlier in the summer. Nevertheless, Nakamura had an excellent debut and was named Man of the Match, earning a standing ovation from the home Celtic support when he was substituted in the 84th minute. Both Tommy Burns and Neil Lennon, at the time first-team coach and club captain, respectively, have credited Nakamura's arrival at Celtic with helping turn around Celtic's disappointing start to the season."]}, {"page": "Beattie", "response": ["* Craig Beattie (born 1984), Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "2005\u201306 in Scottish football", "response": ["|Alan Thompson (pen.), John Hartson, Stephen McManus, Craig Beattie"]}, {"page": "Kasper Schmeichel", "response": ["Schmeichel joined Scottish Premier League side Falkirk on loan from January 2007 until the end of the 2006\u201307 season.
