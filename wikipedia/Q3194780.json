He co-wrote the song \"Mistletoe and Wine\", which got Cliff Richard the 1988 UK Christmas number one. His TV work includes the theme music for the worldwide franchise of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?Strachan attended Blaydon Grammar School and after reading maths and science at Queen Elizabeth College, London University he became a maths teacher including a spell at Sloane Grammar School for Boys in Chelsea, London. He then left teaching to work as a musical director in the London theatre.\nIn 1976 he co-wrote his first musical, Shoot Up at Elbow Creek. He also wrote The Little Match Girl, based on Hans Christian Andersen's short story, for the Orange Tree Theatre, Richmond, which contained the song \"Mistletoe and Wine.\" HTV produced the play for television in 1986. Two years later, he received an Ivor Novello award for the song, when Cliff Richard released it as a single.Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, he directed a series of pop and rock compilation musicals for Bill Kenwright. He also created the West End hit Dancing in the Streets.In 1998, television production company Celador, for whom he had written the themes for The Detectives and Talking Telephone Numbers, called upon him to supply some music at short notice for a quiz show called Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? They requested that the pop song Pete Waterman had written be rearranged, but as Celador's brief required \"something dramatic and full of tension\", Strachan set about composing a new piece altogether. Working with his son Matthew, he took inspiration from a dissonant chord in \"Mars\" from Holst's The Planets suite. The show's huge domestic and international success means that the composition has made them millionaires. In 2002, Keith and Matthew Strachan were given an award by the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) for the Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? theme.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Christmas music", "response": ["* 1988: \"Mistletoe and Wine\", written by Jeremy Paul, Leslie Stewart and Keith Strachan for the 1976 musical, Scraps (an adaptation of Hans Christian Andersen's \"The Little Match Girl\"); released by Cliff Richard as a single (with \"Marmaduke\" on B-side), and on his album Private Collection: 1979\u20131988."]}, {"page": "1944 in television", "response": ["*January 21 - Keith Strachan, composer"]}, {"page": "Pete Waterman", "response": ["In the late-1990s, production company Celador hired Waterman to compose a song for their new quiz show, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?.

Berg saw the adaptation of a stage musical as a move that \"would enhance the brand\" and therefore got in touch with Bill Kenwright, producer Laurie Mansfield, director Bob Tomson, musical director Keith Strachan, choreographer Carole Todd and writers Laurence Marks and Maurice Gran to pen the book of the show. He had \"the basic idea of youth clubs and nostalgia and a songwriting competition\" as the basis of the show because he was a teenager in the sixties who attended a local youth club in Finsbury Park, north London.
