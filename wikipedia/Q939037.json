During the latter, he was with Shackleton at his death, and transported the body part-way back to England.\nHussey was also a member of the armed forces during World War I, serving in France and with Shackleton in Russia. After returning to private practice, Hussey rejoined the war effort in 1940 and became a decorated medical officer with the Royal Air Force during the Second World War. Returning once again to civilian practice in 1946, he was a member of the Royal College of Physicians, a lecturer, author, and Boy Scouts leader prior to retirement. Many of the items he collected during his career were donated to a number of museums.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ernest Shackleton", "response": ["Macklin, who conducted the postmortem, concluded that the cause of death was atheroma of the coronary arteries exacerbated by \"overstrain during a period of debility\".

The final composition of the Ross Sea party was hurried. Some who left Britain for Australia to join Aurora resigned before it departed for the Ross Sea, and a full complement of crew was in doubt until the last minute.Tyler-Lewis 2006, pp.\u00a048\u201353.

The expedition, known as the Shackleton\u2013Rowett Expedition (John Rowett, an old friend of Shackleton's, was the main sponsor), would also attempt to discover sub-Antarctic islands and spend the southern winter in the Pacific islands. The expedition included several Endurance veterans in addition to Worsley; Frank Wild was again second in command, and Leonard Hussey was the meteorologist.

Frank Worsley, Endurances former captain, became captain of Quest. Other old comrades included surgeons Alexander Macklin and James McIlroy, meteorologist Leonard Hussey, engineer Alexander Kerr, seaman Tom McLeod and cook Charles Green. Shackleton had assumed that Tom Crean would sign up, and had assigned him duties \"in charge of boats\", but Crean had retired from the navy to start a family back home in County Kerry, and declined Shackleton's invitation.Smith, p.\u00a0308.", "The death certificate, signed by Macklin, gave the cause as \"Atheroma of the Coronary arteries and Heart failure\" \u2013 in modern terms, coronary thrombosis.

He worked on the pram dinghy Nancy Endurance; made a small chest of drawers for Shackleton; specimen shelves for the biologist, Robert Clark; and instrument cases for Leonard Hussey, the meteorologist; and put up wind screens to protect the helmsman. He constructed a false deck, extending from the poop-deck to the chart-room to cover the extra coal that the ship had taken on board. He also acted as the ship's barber. As the ship pushed into the pack ice in the Weddell Sea it became increasingly difficult to navigate. McNish constructed a six-foot wooden semaphore on the bridge to enable the navigating officer to give the helmsman directions, and built a small stage over the stern to allow the propeller to be watched in order to keep it clear of the heavy ice."]}, {"page": "Robert Clark (zoologist)", "response": ["Once they reached the edge of the pack ice the crew set out for Elephant Island in three of the small boats of the Endurance. Clark travelled in the 22\u00bd-foot James Caird with Shackleton, Frank Hurley, Leonard Hussey, Reginald James, James Wordie, Harry McNish, Charles Green, John Vincent and Timothy McCarthy. On arriving at the island, Shackleton set out almost immediately with five of the crew to fetch rescue from South Georgia. The rest of the men, Clark among them, stayed camped on the island with Frank Wild in command. Elephant Island was inhospitable. It was cold but humid which meant that neither the clothing nor the sleeping bags were ever completely dry. Though there were penguins and seals to eat, the supplies were not inexhaustible and fuel was scarce. The routine on the island was monotonous. Clark managed to produce a primitive alcoholic beverage from methylated spirit, sugar, water and ginger which became known as \"Gut Rot 1916\" and was drunk with a toast to \"Wives and Sweethearts\" on Saturdays. On 30 August 1916, the men on Elephant Island were rescued by Shackleton aboard the Chilean ship Yelcho, four months after he had left the island."]}, {"page": "Strand School", "response": ["*Leonard Hussey, explorer.HMS ENDURANCE Visit and Learn website "]}, {"page": "List of alumni of King's College London", "response": ["*Leonard Hussey \u2013 explorer"]}, {"page": "Personnel of the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition", "response": ["| Leonard Hussey"]}]}}
