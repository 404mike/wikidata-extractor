He then joined non-League side South Liverpool, before continuing in the Football League with Bolton Wanderers, where he made three appearances. He then moved south to Millwall in the Southern League. The onset of World War II limited the number of games that Bower could play, but he did make guest appearances for Southend United, New Brighton and Aldershot. He joined Colchester United as a guest in 1945, but signed professional terms in November 1945, remaining with the club until 1949 and making 55 Southern League appearances. He wound down his playing career with Sudbury Town.", "link_mentions": {}}}
