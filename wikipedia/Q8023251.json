The P3 Class was designed by Wilson Worsdell and was a relatively minor modification of the existing North Eastern Railway NER Class P2 (LNER Class J26). The most significant change was a deeper firebox with shallower sloping fire grate.

Many examples were later rebuilt with a superheater and others had the original Joy valve gear replaced with piston valves and Stephenson valve gear. Some locos were further rebuilt with superheaters, 19\u00a0inch bore cylinders, piston valves and Stephenson valve gear.  The superheaters were later removed from some of these locomotives."]}, {"page": "NER Class S3", "response": ["After World War I, the NER experienced an increase in both freight and passenger traffic. The North Eastern Railway's express goods services were being handled by the S Class (LNER B13), S1 Class (LNER B14), and S2 Class (LNER B15) 4-6-0s, which were difficult to operate and had a high coal consumption. After superheating, all three classes proved to be much more free-steaming. However, the locomotives still struggled to keep to time with the increase in traffic. Meanwhile, express passenger traffic was being handled by the V and V/09 Classes (LNER C6) and Z Class (LNER C7) Atlantics, as well as the R Class (LNER D20) and R1 Class (LNER D21) 4-4-0s. Even though the Atlantics were doing well, the 4-4-0s were also starting to struggle with the increasing train loads. The solution came in 1919, when the NER's chief mechanical engineer, Vincent Raven came up with a 4-6-0 that could be used on both express passenger trains and express goods trains. To provide a good balance between speed and adhesion, 5-foot 8-inch driving wheels were chosen. The NER's three-cylinder layout was also used to provide plenty of power and speed. This arrangement had been used by Raven's predecessor, Wilson Worsdell and first used on his X Class (LNER T1) 4-8-0 Tanks of 1909 and his Y Class (LNER A7) Pacific Tanks of 1910. All three cylinders used Stephenson link motion. On the Y Class, the cylinders drove the front driving axle; on the X Class, meanwhile, they drove the second axle. In both cases, this provided a powerful locomotive that was also easy to maintain and repair. The boiler would also be interchangeable with the T3 Class (LNER Q7) 0-8-0s, much like the S2s, which had interchangeable wheels and cylinders with the S Class and interchangeable cylinders and boilers with the T2 Class (LNER Q6) 0-8-0s. The result was the S3 Class (LNER B16), with the first five members, Nos. 840-844 appearing in December 1919 from Darlington Works."]}, {"page": "Ackworth School", "response": ["*Wilson Worsdell (1850\u20131920), railway engineer"]}, {"page": "LNER Class ES1", "response": ["The North Eastern Railway was an enthusiastic and relatively early adopter of electric traction for railways. As part of a 1902 scheme to electrify the suburban railway networks in the Tyneside area, the NER's Chief Mechanical Engineer, Wilson Worsdell, also wished to electrify a , horseshoe-shaped freight line that went from Trafalgar Yard in Manors to Newcastle Quayside Yard. Passing through three tunnels, this line had gradients as steep as 1:27 (3.70 %) and a number of sharp curves: it presented a formidable challenge for steam traction. Working conditions inside the tunnels were atrocious because the locomotives had to work exceptionally hard to manage the gradients which meant they produced vast quantities of choking fumes that could not disperse from the tunnels; the sparks they produced were a constant fire risk to the flammable packing materials in the yards. Electrification was the obvious answer."]}, {"page": "NER Class R", "response": ["The NER Class R (later, LNER Class D20) was a class of 4-4-0 steam locomotive, designed by Wilson Worsdell for the North Eastern Railway.
