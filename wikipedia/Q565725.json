She had studied aggression among coral reef fish under the pioneering ethologist Konrad Lorenz. Her fieldwork in Kenya's Taru Desert led to a book, Mongoose Watch: A Family Observed, and to a popular German television series, Expedition ins Tierreich. She later studied social behaviour in the yellow mongoose and the sub-social tenebrionid beetle Parastizopus armaticeps.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Common dwarf mongoose", "response": ["* Anne Rasa: Mongoose Watch: A Family Observed, John Murray, 1985, .", "* Anne Rasa: Intra-familial sexual repression in the dwarf mongoose (Helogale parvula) in Naturwissenschaften, Volume 60, Number 6, p.\u00a0303-304, Springer, 1973."]}, {"page": "Helogale", "response": ["* Anne Rasa: Mongoose Watch: A Family Observed, 1985, John Murray.
