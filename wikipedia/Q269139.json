In Mercury, the goal is to guide a drop of mercury to its appointed destination by tilting the stage, in a similar fashion to Marble Madness and Super Monkey Ball. Levels come in different varieties that prioritize different methods of completing each level. The game was conceived when Archer Maclean used a previous minigame from Jimmy White's Cueball World and added a liquid metal physics. It was originally designed to have motion controls by using a tilt sensor peripheral for the PSP but was never released due to technical constraints. Mercury was released in North America on April 6, 2005, and in Europe on September 1, 2005.", "Mercury was developed by Awesome Studios with Archer Maclean as the lead designer for the game. The game was inspired by tilting puzzle games similar to Super Monkey Ball and Marble Madness. The game was conceived when Maclean used one of the minigames from Jimmy White's Cueball World and implemented a \"liquid metal physics\" prototype engine. Maclean chose to study the physics of mercury by obtaining a bottle of real mercury taken from barometers. During development, one of the challenges Awesome Studios had was emulating real mercury physics, how the mercury would split and merge. During play-testing stage of development, Awesome Studios noticed potential shortcuts in the level layouts and adjusted the level design to allow more of them. The game was originally advertised to be released with a tilt sensor peripheral in order to use motion controls, however was unable to be implemented due to cost and technical issues. Maclean chose to release the game on PSP as it could make the game more noticeable for consumers. This led the game to have a tight production schedule to match the launch of the PlayStation Portable, causing the developers to cut corners in the production and resulted in the game to not be as refined as Awesome Studios intended it to be. Mercury was published by Ignition Entertainment and released in North America on April 6, 2005. The game was distributed by Atari for the European version and was released in Europe on September 1, 2005 as a launch title for the PSP. A limited edition bundle was released with its sequel, Mercury Meltdown on October 19, 2010.", "Archer Maclean's Mercury inspired two sequels for the game. The first sequel, titled Mercury Meltdown, was released PSP. The game features new puzzles and modes, as well as a more vibrant and cartoon-like style of graphics.

It is the sequel to Archer Maclean's Mercury. Like the first game, the goal is to tilt the stage in order to navigate one or more blobs of mercury to the destination. In contrast to the original, Ignition Banbury had more time and experience developing the game and listened to player feedback, allowing the game to be easier and provide players with more freedom to choose levels. The game has new hazards, enemies, and minigames. The game was released in North America and Europe in October 2006.", "Mercury Meltdown was developed by Ignition Banbury (formerly Awesome Studios). Early in production stages Archer Maclean who originally coined the concept of the first game, had resigned from Ignition Banbury. His resignation was early enough in development to not have hindered the game's production. The first game, Mercury, was released in a tight production schedule to match the launch of the PlayStation Portable resulting in it lacking refinements. Mercury Meltdown was closer to what the development team originally wanted in the first game due to them becoming more experienced with PSP development. Ignition Banbury chose to use a cel-shaded style with the purpose of differentiating it from its predecessor and to appeal to a wider audience. One of the criticism of the original game that the developers made note of was the difficulty. Ignition Banbury focused on making it easier and less linear. It was intended to be released in Europe by September 2006 with plans of having downloadable content (DLC), however the game was delayed and no DLC was released. Mercury Meltdown was released in North America on October 3, 2006 and in Europe on October 6, 2006.

It was announced in E3 2011. Dave Pollard served as co-producer alongside James Boulton, and co-directed the game with Simon Credland. Neal Jones and Graeme Monk served as designers. The music was created by two independent artists: Jilk and Sugar Jesus. UTV Ignition Games approached Eiconic Games based on Graeme Monk's previous involvement with Archer Maclean's Mercury and due to previous development team, Ignition Banbury, no longer existing. UTV Ignition Games requested the game to be a modernized version of the series and appeal to a wider audience.  Credland created the art style, which was inspired by Portal and Wipeout. Developing the game for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 allowed Eiconic Games to make the mercury more accurate and behave with better physics. The title is a play on words for Mercury HD. Eiconic Games tailored the levels to never take more than two minutes to complete, in order to reduce the frustration of players of losing a level."]}, {"page": "Pete Lyon", "response": ["Lyon taught illustration and computer programming for the BBC Micro at Swarthmore adult college in Leeds during the mid 1980s.
