Somerset captain Rose won the toss and chose to field first in overcast conditions. Joel Garner opened the bowling for Somerset, and after keeping Paul Todd on his back foot during his first over, he bowled him with a yorker in the second over, leaving Nottinghamshire three for one. Tim Robinson and Derek Randall batted through until the seventeenth over, moving the score onto 40 for one, before Robinson was caught at mid-wicket by Viv Richards off the bowling of Colin Dredge for 13. The next over, Randall was bowled for 19, attempting to cut Vic Marks' second delivery, and having lost two wickets without scoring, Nottinghamshire were 40 for three. Basher Hassan and Clive Rice built a partnership, moving the score onto 86, until Rice got out just before lunch. Rice had been targeting the bowling of Marks; he had previously driven him for six, but attacking a similar ball he moved forwards out of his crease to try the same stroke, but was bowled. Hassan was later caught behind off the bowling of Dredge. Garner, whose first spell had been described by The Observers Scyld Berry as \"relatively expensive\", claimed two more wickets with yorkers, while Ian Botham and Hallam Moseley each also took a wicket with yorkers. Of Nottinghamshire's final six batsmen, only Richard Hadlee reached double figures, and they were bowled out for 130; the lowest total in a Benson & Hedges Cup final at the time. The journalist Paul Fitzpatrick suggested that Nottinghamshire had been unable \"to cope with the occasion or the pressure.\" Marks was praised by Henry Blofeld of The Guardian for his \"subtle variations of pace and flight\", while Berry said that he \"cleverly exploited [the Nottinghamshire batsmen's] hesitancy by giving far more flight to his off-spin than is customary in a limited-overs game.\" Marks finished the innings with two wickets, and conceded 24 runs, and Garner took three wickets for 13 runs.", "! scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight: normal; text-align: left;\" | Paul Todd "]}]}}
