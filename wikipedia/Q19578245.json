Swindon won 2\u20131, and, according to the Football Pink, Olney \"seemed to be on the slow side at the start, but he speeded up appreciably and his distribution of the ball was of a high order.\" He made eight more appearances over the next couple of months before Wilcockson regained possession of the left-half position until his injured ankle allowed Olney to play in the last match of the season. His powerful free kick was headed home by Ben Morton to open the scoring in a 3\u20131 win against Torquay United that secured his team a ninth-place finish.
