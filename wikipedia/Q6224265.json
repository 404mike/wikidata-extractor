The City Council selected the firm of Curlett and Beelman, but the Board of Public Works opted instead to hire a trio of the city's top architects in Martin, Parkinson, and Austin. Controversy continued when the architects turned in drawings for 28-story tower to house a municipal government that could adequately fit into the first four floors. In April 1926, Martin spoke in support of the design. Martin said: \"The tower, one of the most efficient parts of the structure, will care for future growth. This tower, in fact, has a three-fold advantage - it gives the building a distinctly beautiful profile, eliminates the possibility of Los Angeles having to spend money in a few years to house the city's business, and admits of a maximum of outside office space.\" The city ultimately accepted the tower plan, and in March 1928 the Board of Public Works passed a resolution commending the architects \"for the eminently satisfactory and beautiful design of the monumental building.\" It was the city's tallest building for three decades."]}, {"page": "John Corneby Wilson Austin", "response": ["#REDIRECT John C.
