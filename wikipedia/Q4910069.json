Manager Halliday was forced to play natural centre forward Adam Bowman at inside forward, which conflicted with centre forward Geordie Reid's role and necessitated the transfer swap of Bowman for Portsmouth inside forward Bill McCafferty in October 1909. After exiting the FA Cup in the second round at the hands of Accrington Stanley, Brentford emerged from a poor Christmas and January to win 10 and draw four of the final 17 matches of the season.
