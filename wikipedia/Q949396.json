More recently, the director David Bintley used Marlowe's play as the basis for the ballet Edward\u00a0II, first performed in 1995; the music from the ballet forms a part of composer John McCabe's symphony Edward\u00a0II, produced in 2000. Novels such as John Penford's 1984 The Gascon and Chris Hunt's 1992 Gaveston have focused on the sexual aspects of Edward and Gaveston's relationship, while Stephanie Merritt's 2002 Gaveston transports the story into the 20th\u00a0century."]}, {"page": "Lancashire", "response": ["More recent Lancashire-born composers include Hugh Wood (1932\u2013 Parbold), Sir Peter Maxwell Davies (1934\u20132016, Salford), Sir Harrison Birtwistle (1934\u2013, Accrington), Gordon Crosse (1937\u2013, Bury),John McCabe (1939\u20132015, Huyton), Roger Smalley (1943\u20132015, Swinton), Nigel Osborne (1948\u2013, Manchester), Steve Martland (1954\u20132013, Liverpool), Simon Holt (1958\u2013, Bolton) and Philip Cashian (1963\u2013, Manchester)."]}, {"page": "Arnold Bax", "response": ["Parlett included an extensive discography in his 1999 A Catalogue of the Works of Sir Arnold Bax,Parlett, Appendix 3 later expanded and updated in a website.
