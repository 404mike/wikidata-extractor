He made just one appearance during the season, in October 2001, during a 7\u20131 victory over Rushden & Diamonds in the Football League Trophy. Brazier became disgruntled with the situation and launched a scathing attack on Cork, stating \"I didn't matter if I played out of my skin for the reserves, I wasn't going to get a game at Cardiff this season and Alan Cork made that clear to me at the start. [...] He might say there wasn't a problem between us, but I think there was. I don't think he wanted me anywhere near the club.\""]}, {"page": "1994\u201395 Rangers F.C. season", "response": ["| Scott McCulloch ||  Hamilton Academical || Free"]}]}}
