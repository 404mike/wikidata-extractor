His main area of responsibility was the ships' safety systems such as the watertight compartments and lifeboats. As a Privy Councillor, he was known as \"The Right Honorable\".\nWhile working on the liners, Carlisle had some minor disputes with Lord Pirrie over the number of lifeboats required for a vessel of this size. Pirrie, the chairman of Harland and Wolff, was satisfied that the number of lifeboats supplied more than met the board of trade regulations. Carlisle then retired and did not have anything more to do with shipbuilding. Thomas Andrews, Pirrie's nephew, was then made master ship builder. Contemporary documentaries claimed Carlisle retired in anger due to Pirrie not accepting his lifeboat recommendations, if his recommendations were accepted the overall death toll of the Titanic\u2019s sinking would far lower.

All three ships were designed by William Pirrie and general manager Alexander Carlisle along with Andrews to be the largest, safest and most luxurious ships at sea. As he had done for the other ships he had overseen, Andrews familiarised himself with every detail of Olympic, Titanic and Britannic, in order to ensure that they were in optimal working order. Andrews's suggestions that the ship have 48 lifeboats (instead of the 20 it ended up with) as well as a double hull and watertight bulkheads that went up to B deck, were overruled."]}, {"page": "Royal Belfast Academical Institution", "response": ["In industrial Belfast, the path to civic prominence did necessarily lead through further education. In the 1860s two boys left the school, age 15, to begin apprenticeships in Belfast's engineering giant, Harland and Wolff.

In 1889, they were joined by another Instonian, Thomas Andrews, who became head of the draughting department.

During the design stage, Alexander Carlisle, Harland & Wolff's chief draughtsman and general manager, submitted a plan to provide 64 lifeboats. He later reduced the figure to 32, and in March 1910 the decision was taken to reduce the number again to 16. Carlisle is believed to have left his position in dispute of this decision. The White Star Line preferred to maximise the amount of deck space available for the enjoyment of the passengers (and the area that was free of lifeboats was, not coincidentally, the First Class promenade). The reasoning for this was explained by Archibald Campbell Holms in an article for Practical Shipbuilding published in 1918:"]}, {"page": "British Wreck Commissioner's inquiry into the sinking of the Titanic", "response": ["Surviving crew members who testified included the most senior surviving officer Charles Lightoller (Second Officer on Titanic), the lookout who sounded the alarm Frederick Fleet, the surviving wireless operator Harold Bride, and the ship's baker Charles Joughin.

Her mother's sister was the mother of William James Pirrie. Her brother, Alexander Carlisle, was the general manager of the Harland and Wolff shipyards. Their father educated the children. On 17 April 1879, she married her cousin William James Pirrie, who eventually became chairman of Harland and Wolff from 1895. Pirrie was hugely involved in her husband's business affairs, which was unusual for the time. She would often accompany him on business trips and visited the shipyard often, getting to know the managers and some of the workers. She would work with her husband on engineering designs and financial planning in the evenings, at first from their home in Belfast, Ormiston, and then from their London office."]}]}}
