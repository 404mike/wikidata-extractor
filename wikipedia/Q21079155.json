His photographs during the Second Anglo-Sikh War (1848\u20131849) of people and places associated with the British rule in India (for which he is best known), and of the Second Burmese War (1852\u20131853), count as sufficient grounds, some historians maintain, to recognise him as the first war photographer known by name. McCosh wrote a number of books on medicine and photography, as well as books of poetry.\nRoddy Simpson has written of McCosh's photographs that \"Given the circumstances, these images are a considerable achievement and, regardless of artistic merit, are historically very important\". Taylor and Schaaf have written that \"McCosh fashioned compositions that were exceptional for the period\" and that unlike his contemporaries \"in his hands, photography was not merely a pastime but became the means of recording history.\"", "link_mentions": {}}}
