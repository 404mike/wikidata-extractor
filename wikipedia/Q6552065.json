His most important political and social essays are collected in his Lettere Meridionali ed altri scritti sulla questione sociale in Italia (Turin, 1885), and Scritti sulla questione sociale in Italia (Florence, 1902). The Lettere Meridionali (originally published in the newspaper L'Opinione in 1875) produced a deep impression, as they were the first exposure of the real conditions of southern Italy. Many of his works were translated into English by his wife, Linda White Mazini Villari, with whom he had Luigi Villari. His stepdaughter, Costanza, married the artist William Stokes Hulton. They had two daughters, Gioconda Mary Hulton and Edith Teresa Hulton.
