Greg Austin, Fady Elsayed, Sophie Hopkins and Vivian Oparah star as four Sixth Formers, with Austin playing a character named Charlie, while Katherine Kelly portrays Miss Quill, a Coal Hill Academy teacher. Nigel Betts reprises his role as Mr. Armitage from \"Into the Dalek\", \"The Caretaker\" and \"Dark Water\" from the eighth series of Doctor Who. Paul Marc Davis appears in a recurring role in the programme. Anna Shaffer portrays a character named Rachel in the programme.", "Entertainment Weekly gave the show a B rating, highly praising the cast: \"The young actors are all very talented and have no trouble handling the show\u2019s heavier material. In fact, I found myself wishing there had been more than just eight episodes in the first season because it would\u2019ve been nice to have seen a bit more of the group\u2019s lighthearted side. That being said, the show\u2019s MVP is clearly Kelly, whose Quill not only delivers some of the best lines but also the best arc of the season. Without giving too much away, her dynamic with one of the student leads is the source of some of the season\u2019s most interesting thematic material.\" However, they regretted that the show's darker tone made it \"slightly less fun\" than Doctor Who. The Los Angeles Times gave the series a mixed review, stating that Ness' storytelling felt \"muddled and mechanical\" and \"tells you too much, too fast.\" They however praised that \"The female roles are especially strong and well played\", particularly praising the performances of Kelly, Sophie Hopkins and Vivian Oparah."]}, {"page": "Vivian Oparah", "response": ["In 2016 Oparah was cast in the BBC Three Doctor Who spin-off Class as Tanya Adeola.
