He was the son of Alfred Crace and the nephew of the noted interior decorator, Frederick Crace.\nFrom about 1836 until 1846 he lived in France, where, after a course of study at Paris, he became manager of some chemical works, later acting as assistant to Michel Eug\u00e8ne Chevreul. On his return to England he settled in Manchester as a consulting chemist, and was appointed honorary professor of chemistry at the Royal Manchester Institution. Devoting himself almost entirely to industrial chemistry, he gave much attention to the manufacture of coal-tar products, and particularly carbolic acid (for use in the treatment of raw sewage), for the production of which he established large works in Manchester in 1865. Besides contributing extensively to the English and French scientific journals, he published a work on Dyeing and Calico-Printing. He died in Manchester.\n\nHe is commemorated by a Royal Society of Chemistry blue plaque on Princess Street in Manchester.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
