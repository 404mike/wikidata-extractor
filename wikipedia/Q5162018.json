Luton lost 1\u20130 at home to AFC Telford United on 25 August, Paul Buckle's first league defeat as manager in a game that saw Ronnie Henry and Telford defender Dan Preston shown red cards, which was swiftly followed two days later with a 3\u20131 win over Ebbsfleet United. Stuart Fleetwood scored his fifth and sixth goals of the season, with Scott Rendell getting his first goal for the club. Following on from the red cards in the game with Telford, both clubs were charged by the Football Association with failing to control their players. In addition, striker Jon Shaw, who began the incident but was not seen by the referee, was charged by the FA with violent conduct and banned for three matches. With defenders Ronnie Henry and Alex Lacey suspended and injured respectively, Luton signed Gillingham centre-back Connor Essam on a one-month loan on the day of the transfer deadline.", "Luton drew 0\u20130 at home to Wrexham on 15 September, leaving them two points off the top of the table. This gap increased to five points six days later as Luton were heavily beaten 4\u20131 by Grimsby Town. Central defenders Kov\u00e1cs and Beckwith were both criticised in the defeat, the latter scoring an own goal and the former dropped from the first-team for Luton's next game against Tamworth on 25 September. Luton won the game 2\u20131 with goals from substitutes Yaser Kasim and Fleetwood. With the team still conceding goals from set-pieces, Buckle signed Guiseley and England C captain and centre-back Simon Ainge on a month's loan on 27 September. On the same day, left-back Greg Taylor and midfielder Adam Watkins, neither of whom had been playing in the first-team, were sent on one-month loans to Tamworth and Kidderminster Harriers respectively. Ainge partnered fellow loanee Connor Essam in central defence two days later as Luton beat Southport 3\u20131, with Kov\u00e1cs and Beckwith not even in the squad of 16 players. Fleetwood's ninth strike of the season and two goals from Rendell secured three points.", "Connor Essam's loan from Gillingham was extended for a further month on 3 October. Luton beat Lincoln City 2\u20131 on 6 October with the Hatters' goals coming from Jon Shaw, his first since the opening day, and an own goal from Lincoln goalkeeper Paul Farman. Forward Jake Robinson and defender Simon Ainge both signed extensions to their loans shortly afterwards; Robinson for one month and Ainge for two. Additionally, Ainge's parent club Guiseley reached an agreement to sell him to Luton when the transfer window in January 2013.", "|align=\"left\"|24||align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Connor Essam", "| 31 August 2012 ||  Connor Essam || Gillingham || 2 November 2012 || style=\"text-align:center;\"|"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Crawley Town F.C. season", "response": ["|Connor Essam"]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Crawley Town F.C. season", "response": ["|Connor Essam", "|Connor Essam"]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 Crawley Town F.C. season", "response": ["|Connor Essam"]}, {"page": "Alex Lacey", "response": ["Injuries prevented Lacey from breaking into the Luton first-team at the beginning of the 2012\u201313 season and, when fit, manager Paul Buckle preferred to use the loan market for young defenders, bringing in Connor Essam and Simon Ainge. Lacey joined Conference South side Eastleigh in January 2013 on a one-month loan that was later extended until the end of the season. He played in both legs of Eastleigh's play-off semi-final in April 2013, which ended in a penalty shoot-out defeat to Dover Athletic. He returned to Luton having played in 20 games, scoring once, and was praised for his performances both at centre-back and right-back."]}, {"page": "2015\u201316 Leyton Orient F.C. season", "response": ["| 27 July 2015 || DF ||  || Connor Essam ||  Dover Athletic || \u00a320,000 || ", "| 23 March 2016 || DF ||  || Connor Essam||  Dover Athletic ||End of Season||"]}, {"page": "2016\u201317 Leyton Orient F.C. season", "response": ["| 1 July 2016 || CB ||  || Connor Essam || Eastleigh  || Released || "]}, {"page": "Essam", "response": ["* Connor Essam (born 1992), English footballer"]}]}}
