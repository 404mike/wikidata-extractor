In 1978, two years after their father's death, Conrad and his older brother Montegu took majority control of Ravelston. Over the next seven years, Conrad Black sold off most of their non-media holdings in order to focus on newspaper publishing. Black controlled Hollinger International, once the world's third-largest English-language newspaper empire, which published The Daily Telegraph (UK), Chicago Sun-Times (U.S.), The Jerusalem Post (Israel), National Post (Canada), and hundreds of community newspapers in North America, before controversy erupted over the sale of some of the company's assets.\nHe was granted a peerage in 2001 and because of the Nickle Resolution, which bans British honours for Canadian citizens, gave up his Canadian citizenship in order to accept the title.\nIn 2007, he was convicted on four counts of fraud in U.S. District Court in Chicago. While two of the criminal fraud charges were overturned on appeal, a conviction for felony fraud and obstruction of justice was upheld in 2010 and he was re-sentenced to 42 months in prison and a fine of $125,000. In 2018, Black wrote a flattering biography of U.S. President Donald Trump. In 2019, Trump granted him a presidential pardon.Black is a longtime columnist and author, including having written a column for the National Post since he founded it in 1998. He has written over ten books, mostly in the fields of Canadian and American history, including biographies of Quebec premier Maurice Duplessis and U.S. presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt, Richard Nixon and Trump, as well as two memoirs. He has also hosted two interview shows on the Canadian cable network VisionTV. He is a political conservative, and belonged to the UK's Conservative Party, but also has some idiosyncratic views, including his support for Roosevelt's New Deal.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 25", "response": ["*1944 \u2013 Conrad Black, Canadian historian and author"]}, {"page": "Franklin D.

The new Society would not become involved in the Western Hemisphere, where the Monroe doctrine held sway. It would not have any control over military forces.

Maurice continued to excel in other subjects, including history, theology, Latin and Greek, which helped him become the best student in his year, but in particular sharpened his rhetorical skills while attending the debate club at the college's Saint Thomas Aquinas Society. Maurice would make what Conrad Black described as \"long apologetic speeches about the founders of French Canada that were as extravagant as they were unconvincing\", where he would show his attachment to and admiration of his roots and the Catholic faith. He was especially fond of Louis H\u00e9bert, one of the first colonizers of the New France and a pioneer of farming in the area, which Black suggests was a sign that he already had a deep affection for the rural lifestyle at this stage, particularly given that he spent the summer with his grandfather in Yamachiche.", "When finishing school, Maurice Duplessis felt attracted to the public life, while at the same time, he was equally devoted to the Catholic Church due to the influence of Brother Andr\u00e9. However, Maurice felt that being a religious minister bore too many constraints. He confided to his secretary a few years later: \"the priesthood is too much for me.\" He was not interested to pursue a business career, either, because, as Black suggested, \"he knew the English were greatly advantaged\". In the meantime, a wave of increased interest in politics engulfed Quebec at the beginning of 20th century, with the popularity of figures like Henri Bourassa and Wilfrid Laurier being felt across the province, which did not bypass Trois-Rivi\u00e8res or Duplessis. Strongly influenced by the family and by the uptick in engagement in political matters, he decided to go in his father's footsteps. Thus in autumn of 1910, he enrolled in the faculty of law at the Universit\u00e9 Laval in Montreal, which is now a separate university called Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al. Pursuing a law degree was then a standard way to get into politics. Conrad Black described Duplessis thus:", "Arthur Sauv\u00e9, in his resignation speech, asked his successor \"to reestablish order in our ravaged ranks\". Even though the new leader liked Duplessis, the future premier did not particularly trust his organizational capabilities, finding him \"an impetuous and verbose braggart\". He also said to his party colleague, Antonio Barrette, who would serve briefly as Premier in 1960: \"You will see Houde climb to the top of the hill, only for him to go down on the other slope\". Conrad Black characterized his relationship with Houde, together with his political views, in the following way:", "Despite the differences within the opposition, the governing Liberals had even more problems. Quebec was in the midst of the Great Depression, which left Canada's economy declining. The Liberal Party, in power for more than 35 years at the time, was suffering from internal tensions, too, but also from the laissez-faire economic policies that proved inadequate for the crisis, and what Conrad Black described as inflexibility and population's weariness of the government that has been in power for too long. As a result, some of the Liberal MLAs became disillusioned with Taschereau and created a new party, the Action lib\u00e9rale nationale (ALN).", "Duplessis has not been without his defenders. Conrad Black's 1977 encomium, Duplessis, painted a sympathetic portrait of the man as a transitional figure towards modernism, and the victim of partisan attack and personal malady.", "Duplessis has had numerous health problems in his life. Duplessis underwent two surgeries for strangulated hernia in 1930 and 1942, which each time ended in several-month-long stays in the hospital due to complications or other diseases slowing down his reconvalescence, as well as a shorter one for traumas he had during a car accident in 1929. Maurice has also been a heavy drinker, but on the advice his doctor, his party's pressure and Ad\u00e9lard Godbout's suggestion that this \"weakness was going to ruin [Duplessis]\", became abstinent after his second surgery. It was also in 1942 that it was discovered Duplessis had diabetes, which particularly caused trouble particularly in his last years of life.
