A good start to Nigel Adkins' second season in charge was followed by a poor run of results that ended with his sacking after the 6\u20131 away defeat to Birmingham City with Steve Clarke taking over the next day in the hope of a promotion push. However, a lack of goals and some poor form in the league meant the club faced some fears of relegation to League One, but luckily safety was secured with few games to spare. Nonetheless, during that time, the club embarked on a successful FA Cup journey, reaching the semi-final where they were unlucky to lose 2\u20131 to Arsenal at Wembley.

Armenia, considered a heavy underdog, defeated the group favorite Slovakia with two crushing defeats 4\u20130 and 3\u20131, defeated Andorra in two matches as well 4\u20130 and 3\u20130, drew with Macedonia 2\u20132 and defeated them in the deciding match 4\u20131 and tied with the group winners Russia 0\u20130. The Armenian team scored the most goals out of Group B, with a total of 22. Henrikh Mkhitaryan of Armenia scored 6 goals, the most goals scored by a single player in Group B. The national team almost made the final draw, but controversially lost in a decisive match against Ireland 1\u20132. Armenian goalkeeper Roman Berezovsky was given a red card by Spanish referee Eduardo Gonzalez at the 26th-minute for supposedly touching the ball outside the goal area. However, replays clearly showed the ball touched his chest and never touched his hands. Replays also showed that Ireland striker Simon Cox had actually touched the ball with his right hand. Despite this, Gonzalez did not penalize Cox. Cox would later admit he touched the ball with his hand. Had Cox's offence been punished, Armenia would have been awarded a free-kick. Berezovsky was substituted with 19-year-old debuting Arsen Petrosyan. Valeri Aleksanyan later accidentally scored an own goal past Petrosyan, which ended up deciding the match. Armenia and Ireland would each score another goal. The Football Federation of Armenia unsuccessfully filed protest over the match. Gonzalez had later resigned after the match. Despite not getting to play in the UEFA Euro 2012, Minasyan brought the Armenian national team to a record #41 FIFA ranking, placed the team in a personal best third place in the group stage and went on to become the longest leading head coach of the Armenian football team. Minasyan stated he was proud of the entire team.

Moore soon became a subject of chant from West Bromwich Albion's supporters over his goal scoring form. Two months later on 26 December 2009, he scored his fourth goal of the season, in a 2\u20130 win against Peterborough United. However, Moore's scoring record after was poor in the second half of the season that he was subjected of booing by the club's supporters.
