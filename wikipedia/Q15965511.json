Carnett in 1926.Carnett JB (1926) Intercostal neuralgia as a cause of abdominal pain and tenderness. J. Surg. Gynecol. Obstet. 42:625-632 The first clear description of anterior abdominal wall pain arising from structures other than the underlying viscera was Edgar Ferdinand Cyriax in 1919.Cyriax EF (1919) On various conditions that may stimulate the referred pains of visceral disease, and a consideration of these from the point of view of cause and effect. Practitioner 102:314-322 Cyriax considered that pain could be mimicked by lesions that arose from the vertebra, ribs or other associated structure or that they were the result of direct irritation of intercostal nerves. By identifying conditions such as alterations in the normal vertebral curves, minor subluxation of vertebral bodies and pressure on the peripheral portions of the intercostal nerves, he was able to employ various mechanical treatments to correct the abnormalities and relieve his patients\u2019 symptoms. Despite this paper little attention was paid to this problem until Carnett developed his simple clinical test. Carnett thought that lower abdominal pain was commonly caused by the lower six thoracic nerves and wanted to be able to distinguish this origin from that arising from the viscera."]}, {"page": "Slipping rib syndrome", "response": ["Slipping rib syndrome was first described by Edgar Ferdinand Cyriax in 1919; however, the condition is rarely recognized and frequently overlooked. Prevalence of the condition is estimated to have between ~1-5% of clinical diagnoses in two studies, with a separate study finding a prevalence of ~3% in a mixed specialty general medicine and gastroenterology clinic.", "Slipping rib syndrome was first mentioned in 1919 by Edgar Ferdinand Cyriax, an orthopedic physician and physiotherapist, who described a chest pain associated with a \"popping\" or \"clicking\" sensation. The condition was originally named after him, Cyriax syndrome, but has used multiple names since then, including clicking rib syndrome, painful rib syndrome, interchondral subluxation, and displaced ribs. The name \"slipping rib syndrome\" was first used by surgeon Robert Davies-Colley and gained popularity, becoming the most commonly quoted term for the condition. Davies-Colley was also the first to describe an operation for slipping rib syndrome, a costal cartilage removal."]}]}}
