Collins was spotted playing non-league football for Rhymney Town by Cardiff City, signing for the Bluebirds in 1923. He spent four years at Ninian Park but struggled to establish himself in the first-team, making 12 league appearances for the club. He left the club in 1929 to join Clapton Orient.He also gained one cap for Wales in his career, playing 1 match on 25 October 1930 against Scotland, in a match that was dubbed \"Keenor and the unknowns\" in reference to captain Fred Keenor and the non-league and fringe players who made up the rest of the squad after Football League clubs had refused to release their Welsh players for the tie due to a fixture clash.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1923\u201324 Cardiff City F.C. season", "response": ["! scope=row|Elvet Collins"]}, {"page": "1924\u201325 Cardiff City F.C. season", "response": ["During the season, manager Fred Stewart used 24 players in all competitions. Goalkeeper Tom Farquharson and defender Jimmy Nelson made the most appearances of any players, both featuring in 46 matches during the campaign. Five other players made 40 or more appearances. Elvet Collins, Jack Lewis, Billy Taylor and George Whitcombe all made a single appearance during the season. Lewis and Whitcombe's appearances were their final matches for Cardiff before being released."]}, {"page": "History of the Wales national football team (1876\u20131976)", "response": ["In 1930, the Football League introduced a new ruling which prohibited its members from releasing players for international fixtures. The ruling was designed to force international matches to be scheduled on days that would not clash with Football League fixtures. Wales' first match under the ruling was the opening game of the 1930\u201331 British Home Championship against Scotland, who were largely unaffected as they drew the majority of their players from Scottish leagues. Wales were forced to call up a mixture of lower division and amateur players to field a side. Nine of Wales' eleven players made their international debut in the game; only captain Fred Keenor and goalkeeper Len Evans had previous international experience. As a result, the team was dubbed \"Keenor and the 10 unknowns\". Ahead of the match, Keenor asked Ted Robbins if he could have the players to himself for four hours before the game. Taking the team to relax and discuss tactics for the match, in his pre-match team talk he exhorted his teammates, \"There's eleven of them and eleven of us, and there's only one ball, and it's ours.\" Despite their inexperience, the Welsh side held Scotland to a 1\u20131 draw having taken the lead after six minutes from a goal by Tommy Bamford. The display led to a Scottish newspaper describing the Welsh performance as \"the pluckiest display in the history of international football\". The Welsh public also responded by calling for the same side to remain for the following match against England, although Elvet Collins was replaced due to injury. There was no repeat of the result; the Welsh side lost 4\u20130 at the Racecourse Ground."]}]}}
