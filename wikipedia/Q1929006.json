The screenplay by Reeves and Tom BakerTom Baker was a childhood friend of Reeves who co-wrote Witchfinder and Reeves's earlier The Sorcerers; he is not to be confused with Tom Baker, the Doctor Who actor. was based on Ronald Bassett's novel of the same name. The film is a heavily-fictionalised account of the murderous witch-hunting exploits of Matthew Hopkins (Price), a lawyer who falsely claimed to have been appointed as a \"Witch Finder Generall\" by Parliament during the English Civil War to root out sorcery and witchcraft. Reprint of  The Discovery of Witches. Its plot follows Roundhead soldier Richard Marshall (Ogilvy), who relentlessly pursues Hopkins and his assistant John Stearne (Russell) after they prey on his fianc\u00e9e Sara (Dwyer) and execute her priestly uncle John Lowes (Davies).", "* Vincent Price as Matthew Hopkins. Decidedly not Michael Reeves's choice for the part, this was the veteran horror star's 75th film and his 17th for American International Pictures. Some of the performances he provided for his previous AIP movies had certain elements of campy overacting, but in Witchfinder he was subtle and deadly serious. The role was a great challenge for Price, as his frequent clashes with Reeves left him unsure as to what the director wanted. Despite this, Price ultimately felt he delivered \"one of the best performances I've ever given.\"", "Michael Reeves, who had just completed Tigon's The Sorcerers (1967) starring Boris Karloff, provided a story outline which met with Tenser's enthusiastic approval. Tenser immediately began putting together a preliminary budget, and requested that Reeves quickly complete a full film script, stressing to Reeves that the production would need to commence by September of that year to avoid shooting during cold weather. Reeves called in his childhood friend Tom Baker (who had co-written The Sorcerers with Reeves) to assist him with the script. Reeves and Baker began drafting a screenplay with Donald Pleasence firmly in mind as the film's star. However, once American International Pictures became involved in the production, they insisted that their contract star, Vincent Price, be given the lead, and Pleasence was dropped from the film. With the abrupt change of star, Reeves and Baker had to rethink their original concept of presenting Hopkins as \"ineffective and inadequate\u00a0\u2026 a ridiculous authority figure\", which they had believed Pleasence could play to perfection. They knew the tall, imposing Price, with his long history of horror roles, would have to be more of a straightforward villain, and they made changes to their script accordingly.", "Price felt that all the actors on the set had a difficult time with the director, explaining: \"Michael Reeves could not communicate with actors. He would stop me and say, 'Don't move your head like that.' And I would say, 'Like what? What do you mean?' He'd say, 'There\u2014you're doing it again. Don't do that'.\" Price reportedly became so upset with Reeves that he refused to watch the film's dailies.", "For its time, Witchfinder General was considered an unusually sadistic film. British film censor John Trevelyan was reportedly a distant cousin of Michael Reeves and accepted the director's good intentions when Reeves explained why he felt it was necessary to include such intense violence in the movie. Trevelyan nonetheless argued, \"The film gave the impression that it was exploiting violence, and in particular, sadism for commercial reasons.\" Consequently, the film was cut extensively by the British Board of Film Censors for its UK release. Nearly two complete minutes of what was described as \"excesses of sadistic brutality\" were removed. Reeves agreed to make some of the initial minor cuts himself, but when additional and more extensive demands were made he adamantly refused to take part in any further editing.", "Nonetheless, several critics felt the film was worth accolades. John Russell Taylor in the London Times Saturday Review said the film \"\u2026\u00a0is quite happily and deliberately a horror film: that is to say, it has no particular pretensions to being anything else\u00a0\u2026 There is much in it which would win Michael Reeves an important reputation if he were dealing with some more pretentious, but fundamentally no more serious subject\u00a0\u2026 Mr. Reeves is no longer merely promising. He already has real achievements behind him: not merely good horror films, but good films, period.\" Films and Filming noted, \"Witchfinder General has no explicit 'message', but it does say something about the springs of despair and it says it forcefully. It is a very frightening film\u00a0\u2026 Matthew Hopkins is the best of Price's recent performances. Witchfinder General is emphatically not a horror film; it is, however, a very horrifying one\u00a0\u2026\"", "AIP heads Arkoff and Nicholson had originally contributed their portion of the budget as a tax write-off, but when they were screened the completed film they were astonished by its quality. Nicholson told Louis Heyward, \"It is one of the best we have gotten from England. Everybody thinks this is about the best production in the Poe series for the past few years.\" Arkoff noted that \"Michael Reeves brought out some elements in Vincent that hadn't been seen in a long time. Vincent was more savage in the picture. Michael really brought out the balls in him. I was surprised how terrifying Vincent was in that\u00a0\u2026 I hadn't expected it.\"", "Of those who did see it, Hollywood Citizen News was appalled by the film: \"A disgrace to the producers and scripters, and a sad commentary on the art of filmmaking\u00a0\u2026 a film with such bestial brutality and orgiastic sadism, one wonders how it ever passed customs to be released in this country.\" The trade journal Box Office noted that: \"Fans of the horror film will be glad to know that Vincent Price is back to add another portrait to his gallery of arch-fiends\u00a0\u2026 bathed in the most stomach-churning gore imaginable\u00a0\u2026\" Variety opined that \"Dwyer gives evidence of acting talent, but she and all principals are hampered by Michael Reeves's mediocre script and ordinary direction.\"", "In 2000, Derek Malcolm included Witchfinder General as part of his series The Century of Films, a list of what he considered to be the one hundred most \"artistically or culturally important\" movies of the 20th Century. Malcolm asserted that the film \"is one of the most compulsively watchable ever made in Britain\" and \"transcends its genre with the sheer panache of its making.\"; A Century of Films, I.B.

Hoberman of the Village Voice stated that the film \"has long been a cult item\u2014in part because its talented 25-year-old director, Michael Reeves, died of a drug overdose before the film's release, but mainly because it is an extraordinarily bleak story of political evil\u00a0\u2026 Reeves shot on location and the movie has a robust autumnal quality perfectly matched by Price's overripe performance\u00a0\u2026 it remains contemporary, and even frightening, in its evocation of cynical Puritanism and mass deception.\"", "Category:Films directed by Michael Reeves", "Category:Films with screenplays by Michael Reeves"]}, {"page": "Ian Ogilvy", "response": ["He was a friend of the film-maker Michael Reeves and starred in all three of Reeves's films: Revenge of the Blood Beast (1966), The Sorcerers and Witchfinder General.
