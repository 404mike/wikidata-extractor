Brackenreid, Murdoch's immediate superior, is a blunt and sceptical Yorkshireman with a fondness for whisky who prefers conventional methods of detection over Murdoch's eccentric methods, though he is typically pleased and proud when Murdoch is successful despite the odds. Crabtree is often unable to grasp the more advanced methods, but his enthusiasm and loyalty make him a good assistant. Like Crabtree, Dr.\u00a0Ogden is a great supporter of Murdoch's methods. Her skill in pathology usually helps by revealing a great deal of useful evidence to aid Murdoch in solving cases. Throughout the series, Murdoch's growing infatuation with her, and his inability to express his feelings, provide a light subplot. In the fifth season, after Dr. Ogden is married to Dr. Darcy Garland (a colleague she met in Buffalo), a new doctor is introduced, Doctor Emily Grace (Georgina Reilly). She and George Crabtree show some romantic interest in each other."]}, {"page": "List of Canadian actors", "response": ["*Georgina Reilly"]}, {"page": "Georgina (name)", "response": ["*Georgina Reilly (born 1986), Canadian actress"]}, {"page": "List of Murdoch Mysteries episodes", "response": ["Georgina Reilly (Dr. Emily Grace) was promoted to series regular for the sixth season."]}, {"page": "This Movie Is Broken", "response": ["This Movie Is Broken is a 2010 Canadian film directed by Bruce McDonald.
