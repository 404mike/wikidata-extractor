He played primarily as a defensive midfielder, but he also played as a sweeper and at right-back. He was most recently the head coach at EFL League Two club Colchester United.\nMullins began his career with First Division side Crystal Palace in 1996, and signed his first professional contract with the club in 1998. He quickly established himself in the first team, and made 257 senior appearances for Palace in five seasons. In October 2003, he switched to First Division side West Ham United, initially on a short-term loan, which quickly turned into a permanent transfer. He remained at the club for five-and-a-half years, making 213 appearances, before joining Premier League side Portsmouth in January 2009. He made 129 appearances for Portsmouth, but the club's financial difficulties meant that he joined Championship side Reading on loan in March 2012. At the end of the 2011\u201312 season, Mullins left Portsmouth, and joined Birmingham City on a free transfer. After two years, during which he also spent time on loan at Notts County, Birmingham confirmed he would be released when his contract expired at the end of the 2013\u201314 season.\nMullins made three appearances for the England under-21 squad in 1999. After retiring, he became under-23 manager of Watford in 2016, and was twice their interim manager.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Portsmouth F.C.", "response": ["* 2011 \u2013  Hayden Mullins"]}, {"page": "Lee Clark (footballer)", "response": ["On 26 June 2012, Clark was confirmed as manager of Birmingham City, with Terry McDermott as his Assistant Manager and Derek Fazackerley and Steve Watson as his First Team Coaches.

With Hayden Mullins suspended and Jonathan Spector injured for the visit of Crystal Palace on 15 December, Diop made his first start for Birmingham, alongside League debutant Callum Reilly in central midfield. He scored the equalising goal, a powerful header from Rob Hall's corner, as Birmingham came back from 2\u20130 down to draw, and was rewarded with another month's contract. He injured a hamstring soon afterwards, and despite his imminent return to fitness, the club's financial difficulties meant they could not offer him a further contract extension.

Following his return, Morrison's goal scoring form continued for the rest of the 1999\u20132000 season, including his only brace of the season at Swindon Town. Financial difficulties meant that Crystal Palace were unable to make new signings for the 1999\u20132000 season and relied on youngsters such as Morrison and Hayden Mullins and veterans such as Andy Linighan as they successfully battled against relegation from the First Division. At the end of the 1999\u201300 season, he played more than 30 games, and scored 14 goals, making him the club's top scorer once again."]}]}}
