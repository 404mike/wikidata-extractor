He played at centre.\nAdams made his Gloucester first-team debut against Sale Sharks at Kingsholm on 10 September 2005 (18 years old), he came on as a replacement for Mike Tindall. He tore his ACL shortly after and spent the rest of the 05/06 season in recovery, after finding out he had made the England U21s squad at age 18.  After this long injury lay off, Adams started the 2006-07 Guinness Premiership with 2 tries in the first two home games of the season, they were both scored when he came on as a replacement. When Mike Tindall was away playing for England Adams replaced him, many times being man of the match, notably vs Wasps, Leicester Tigers & Newcastle Falcons all in the space of a few weeks. In total Adams scored 6 tries in all competitions during the 2006-07 season and set up countless others. During the 2007\u201308 and 2008-09 seasons, Adams was also dual-registered with Moseley, for whom he made many appearances, mostly at outside centre, and he also gained a cup winners medal as part of the EDF Energy Trophy winning side of 2009 and set up both tries. Adams played for England Sevens over three seasons from 2007-2009 travelling to Dubai, Adelaide, South Africa, Hong Kong, Edinburgh & Twickenham several times. He also played England Counties for two seasons running from 2012 to 2014 and was a remarkable addition to their program.\nAdams joined Bristol Rugby in 2009 signing a two-year contract, after playing over 50 games for Bristol and winning the British & Irish Cup with them he was part of the squad who lost to Exeter in the Championship final. Adams then made the move to Moseley Rugby Club. The strong running centre badly broke his thumb vs Nottingham which kept him out for the remaining 14 games of the season. Due to this injury Adams had limited options moving into the 2012 season, but Cinderford RFC saw a chance and jumped at the ex Gloucester, Bristol & England 7s player. Adams then played for them for three seasons. He was their top try scorer in the 2013/14 season and was a huge part of their 2014/15 season survival.\nAdams died on 12 June 2021 from cancer, at the age of 34.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1986 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["** Jack Adams, rugby union player (died 2021)"]}, {"page": "Jack Adams (disambiguation)", "response": ["Jack Adams (1895\u20131968) was a Canadian ice hockey player and coach of the Detroit Red Wings.", "Jack Adams may also refer to:", "* Jack Adams (ice hockey, born 1920) (1920\u20131996), Canadian pro hockey player with the Montreal Canadiens", "* Jack Adams (rugby union) (1986\u20132021), English professional rugby union player", "* Jack Adams (basketball), in the American Basketball League", "* John Adams (mutineer) (1767\u20131829), known as \"Jack Adams\" last survivor of the Bounty mutineers", "* John Adams, 1st Baron Adams (1890\u20131960), British trade unionist and politician, known as \"Jack Adams\"", "* Jack Adams Award, National Hockey League award for coaches"]}, {"page": "Jack Adams (rugby player)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jack Adams (rugby union)"]}, {"page": "Jack Adams (rugby)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jack Adams (rugby union)"]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 British and Irish Cup", "response": ["|OC ||13|| Jack Adams"]}, {"page": "2021 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["*12 June \u2013 Jack Adams, English rugby union player, cancer (b. 1986)."]}, {"page": "Deaths in June 2021", "response": ["*Jack Adams, 34, English rugby union player (Gloucester, Moseley, Bristol), cancer.Former Gloucester Rugby star Jack Adams passes away aged 34"]}]}}
