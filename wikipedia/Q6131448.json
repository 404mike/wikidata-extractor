He subsequently became chief executive, and then chairman, of Reckitt & Colman. Active from that period in the Confederation of British Industry, he became its president in 1984.\nCleminson was born in 1921 in Hull, East Riding of Yorkshire, to businessman Arnold Cleminson and his wife, Dr. Florence Stacey-Cleminson, a physician at Victoria Children's Hospital. Clemison attended Rugby School and was called up for war service in 1940 immediately after leaving. He fought in the North African Campaign and was captured, being taken to Italy as a prisoner of war. There he escaped and walked through enemy lines to rejoin his regiment during the Italian Campaign. He subsequently joined the Parachute Regiment as a captain and participated in the Battle of Arnhem, where his platoon ambushed and killed the German garrison commander Major-General Friedrich Kussin. During the fighting, Cleminson found himself trapped in an attic with Major-General Roy Urquhart, who took exception to Cleminson's mustache, which he called \"damned silly\". For three days he fought in the village of Oosterbeek, until he was wounded and captured. For his defense of the perimeter, Cleminson was awarded the Military Cross and was later featured in the film A Bridge Too Far, played by Michael Graham Cox.In early 1945, Cleminson was freed by American forces, and accompanied Urquhart to Norway at the end of the conflict. On demobilisation in 1946, Cleminson joined his father's firm, which had merged with J. J. Colman to form Reckitt & Colman. The company produced a wide array of household goods.  Cleminson rose rapidly in the food division, known as Colman's, and then was appointed to the board of Reckitt & Colman, where from 1973 he was chief executive and from 1976 chairman. In 1980 he also took a position with the Confederation of British Industry, which was suffering severely due to the effects of the 1973\u201375 recession. He remained there until 1986, spending the last two years as president, before retiring from both positions to become chairman of the British Overseas Trade Board.In retirement, Cleminson held a number of chairman and board positions and was particularly active in Norfolk, where he was instrumental in the revitalization of the Theatre Royal, Norwich. For his services to business, Cleminson was knighted in 1982 and made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1990. Cleminson was also a keen sportsman throughout his life and on his death in September 2010 was survived by his wife Judy and three children. He is buried in the graveyard of Barsham Church in Suffolk. Lady Cleminson died in 2019 at the age of 88.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Operation Market Garden", "response": ["Two attempts to capture the arched steel bridge and its southern approach failed.

The end frames have central pivots, around which they swivel freely, while the middle frame is so arranged that it can slide transversely. The three frames are connected together by articulated radiating gear, so that they act sympathetically, and, no matter how sharp the curve, each axle instantly assumes a position coincident with the radial lines of that curve, instead of remaining parallel to each other as in the ordinary construction, in which the wheels grind their way along the sides of the rails. The wear and tear of tires and rails is thus greatly reduced, because the flanges of the tires are always parallel with the rails.\"Clemison's radiating axles.
