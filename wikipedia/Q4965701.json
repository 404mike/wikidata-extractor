His education includes an MA (Natural Sciences, Cambridge 1968), PhD (Materials Science, Cambridge 1971), MPhil (Sociology of Science, Edinburgh 1977). His work has covered technology and risk assessment, public risk perceptions, and public understanding of science, focusing on the relations between expert and lay knowledge and policy decision-making.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Risk assessment", "response": ["The usefulness of quantitative risk assessment has been questioned, however. Barry Commoner, Brian Wynne and other critics have expressed concerns that risk assessment tends to be overly quantitative and reductive. For example, they argue that risk assessments ignore qualitative differences among risks. Some charge that assessments may drop out important non-quantifiable or inaccessible information, such as variations among the classes of people exposed to hazards, or social amplification. Furthermore, Commoner and O'Brien claim that quantitative approaches divert attention from precautionary or preventative measures.Commoner, Barry. O'Brien, Mary. Shrader-Frechette and Westra 1997. Others, like Nassim Nicholas Taleb consider risk managers little more than \"blind users\" of statistical tools and methods."]}, {"page": "Science studies", "response": ["A showcase of the rather complex problems of scientific information and its interaction with lay persons is Brian Wynne's study of Sheepfarming in Cumbria after the Chernobyl disaster.Wynne B (1989) Sheepfarming after Chernobyl: a case study in communicating scientific information. Environment 31(2):33\u201339. He elaborated on the responses of sheep farmers in Cumbria, who had been subjected to administrative restrictions because of radioactive contamination, allegedly caused by the nuclear accident at Chernobyl in 1986.  The sheep farmers suffered economic losses and their resistance against the regulation imposed was being deemed irrational and not adequate.  It turned out that the source of radioactivity was actually the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing complex; thus, the experts who were responsible for the duration of the restrictions were completely mistaken. The example lead to various attempts to better involve local knowledge and experience of lay people and to assess its often highly geographically and historically defined background.", "Science has become a major force in Western democratic societies, which depend on innovation and technology (compare Risk society) to address its risks. (in German: Die Risikogesellschaft 1986) Beliefs about science can be very different from those of the scientists themselves, for reasons of e.g. moral values, epistemology or political motivations.The designation of expertise as authoritative in the interaction with lay people and decision makers of all kind is nevertheless challenged in contemporary risk societies, as suggested by scholars who follow Ulrich Beck's theorisation. The role of expertise in contemporary democracies is an important theme for debate among science studies scholars. Some argue for a more widely distributed, pluralist understanding of expertise (Sheila Jasanoff and Brian Wynne, for example), while others argue for a more nuanced understanding of the idea of expertise and its social functions (Collins and Evans, for example)."]}, {"page": "Public awareness of science", "response": ["In the 1990s, a new perspective emerged in the field with the classic study of Cumbrian Sheep Farmers' interaction with the Nuclear scientists in England. Brian Wynne demonstrated how the experts were ignorant or disinterested in taking into account the lay knowledge of the sheep farmers while conducting field experiments on the impact of the Chernobyl Nuclear fall out on the sheep in the region. Because of this shortcoming from the side of the scientists, local farmers lost their trust in them. The experts were unaware of the local environmental conditions and the behaviour of sheep and this has eventually led to the failure of their experimental models. Following this study, scholars have studies similar micro-sociological contexts of expert-lay interaction and proposed that the context of knowledge communication is important to understand public engagement with science. Instead of large scale public opinion surveys, researchers proposed studies informed by Sociology of Scientific Knowledge (SSK). The contextualist model focuses on the social impediments in the bidirectional flow of scientific knowledge between experts and laypersons/communities."]}, {"page": "Science communication", "response": ["In 1990, Steven Hilgartner, a scholar in science and technology studies, criticized some academic research in public understanding of science. Hilgartner argued that what he called \"the dominant view\" of science popularization tends to imply a tight boundary around those who can articulate true, reliable knowledge. By defining a \"deficient public\" as recipients of knowledge, the scientists get to emphasize their own identity as experts, according to Hilgartner. Understood in this way, science communication may explicitly exist to connect scientists with the rest of society, but science communication may reinforce the boundary between the public and the experts (according to work by Brian Wynne in 1992Wynne, Brian (1992). \"Misunderstood misunderstanding: Social identities and public uptake of science\", Public Understanding of Science, vol. 1 (3): 281\u2013304. See also Irwin, Alan & Wynne, Brian (eds) (1996) Misunderstanding Science (Cambridge & New York: Cambridge University Press). and Massimiano Bucchi in 1998Massimiano Bucchi (1998) Science and the Media (London & New York: Routledge).). In 2016, the scholarly journal Public Understanding of Science ran an essay competition on the \"deficit model\" or \"deficit concept\" of science communication and published a series of articles answering the question \"In science communication, why does the idea of a public deficit always return?\" in different ways; for example, Carina Cortassa's essay argued that the deficit model of science communication is just a special case of an omnipresent problem studied in social epistemology of testimony, the problem of \"epistemic asymmetry\", which arises whenever some people know more about some things than other people. Science communication is just one kind of attempt to reduce epistemic asymmetry between people who may know more and people who may know less about a certain subject."]}, {"page": "David Cayley", "response": ["| Brian Wynne"]}, {"page": "Anti-nuclear movement in the United Kingdom", "response": ["*Brian Wynne, Professor of Science Studies."]}, {"page": "John Desmond Bernal Prize", "response": ["| 2010 || Brian Wynne || Rationality and Ritual: The Windscale Inquiry and Nuclear Decisions in Britain"]}, {"page": "European Network of Scientists for Social and Environmental Responsibility", "response": ["ENSSER members include Hans Rudolf Herren, winner of the 1995 World Food Prize and the 2013 Right Livelihood Award, Angela Hilbeck, senior scientist at the Institute of Integrative Biology at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology.
