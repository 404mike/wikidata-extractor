Letter 3357 \u2014 Bateman, Robert to Darwin, C. R., [1862], Darwin Correspondence Project. Darwin noted the defining characteristic of the species, its extremely long spur. From his observations, Darwin surmised, in his 1862 publication On the Various Contrivances by Which British and Foreign Orchids Are Fertilized by Insects, and On the Good Effects of Intercrossing, that there must be a pollinator moth with a proboscis long enough to reach the nectar at the end of the spur. He arrived at this conclusion after attempting in vain to remove the pollinia of the flower using needles and bristles. Only after placing a cylinder with a diameter of  of an inch (2.5\u00a0mm) down the full length of the spur was he able to detach the pollinia upon retracting it. The viscidium attached to the cylinder as he removed it. Darwin surmised that during the moth's attempt at getting the nectar at the end of the spur, the moth would get the pollinarium attached to itself.  The next orchid it visited would then be pollinated in the same manner."]}, {"page": "Knypersley Hall", "response": ["The Bowyer Baronetcy became extinct with the death of the 4th Baronet in 1702.
