The videos gained a vast amount of hits and were some of the most-viewed on YouTube. Sony quickly removed the footage but it has since been re-hosted by hundreds of other users. The blog was also noteworthy during PS3's Japanese launch; one of the freelance writers, Joel Snape, was in the queue at the Asobits store in Akihabara and blogged live using his laptop. He was second in line and was the second person in the world to buy a PS3 commercially."]}, {"page": "Men's Fitness (British magazine)", "response": ["Its editors have included Pete Muir (currently editor of Dennis's cycling magazine Cyclist), Jon Lipsey and Warner, who together set up the digital fitness publishing company IronLife in 2014, and Joe Barnes, who had formerly been editor of FHM and Front.
