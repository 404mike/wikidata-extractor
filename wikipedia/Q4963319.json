The club had declined during his absence; Leeds had dropped down into the Second Division, sold Elland Road to the council to raise money, and club supporters picked up a reputation for violence after regular hooligan riots in the stands. He quickly reinstated Don Revie's philosophy and his little traditions, for example he reinstated the sessions of carpet bowls on Friday evenings. Despite this he appointed Ian Snodin as club captain, and dropped former captain and teammate Peter Lorimer from the starting line eleven. He also moved on the young players signed by former manager and teammate Eddie Gray, choosing to sign experienced players in their place. Five key young players to leave the club were Scott Sellars (\u00a320,000 to Blackburn Rovers), Terry Phelan (free transfer to Swansea City), Denis Irwin, Tommy Wright and Andy Linighan (all to Oldham Athletic for \u00a360,000, \u00a355,000 and \u00a380,000 respectively). The money raised allowed him to buy central defender Brendan Ormsby (\u00a365,000 from Aston Villa), and also sign David Rennie, Brian Caswell and Ronnie Robinson. Leeds struggled in the 1985\u201386 season, but managed to steer away from the relegation zone to finish in 14th place."]}, {"page": "Brian Caswell", "response": ["Brian Caswell (born 13 January 1954) is an Australian author of young adult fiction.", "Brian Caswell was born in a village called Gwernaffield in Wales, on 13 January 1954.
