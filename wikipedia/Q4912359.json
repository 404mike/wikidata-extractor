Everton dominated the first half but were unable to score from any of the chances they created, and it was Albion who broke the deadlock ten minutes into the second half. Albion captain Tommy Glidden played the ball into the Everton penalty area from near the halfway line, and aided by a gust of wind it sailed past Everton goalkeeper Billy Coggins and into the net. The match was played in front of 69,241 spectators, setting a new attendance record for Old Trafford.McOwan pp. 48\u201349."]}, {"page": "Bill Coggins", "response": ["#REDIRECTBilly Coggins"]}, {"page": "William Coggins", "response": ["#REDIRECTBilly Coggins"]}, {"page": "Coggins", "response": ["*Billy Coggins (1901\u20131958), English football player"]}]}}
