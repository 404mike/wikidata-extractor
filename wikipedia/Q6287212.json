Sergeant Joseph Stones, fleeing a German ambush, ran past their position shouting \"Run for your lives, the Huns are on top of you!\", and Goggins and McDonald retreated to a reserve trench  away. Both men were subsequently charged with deserting their posts, and in spite of Stones' evidence that he had given the order to retreat, they were convicted at court martial on Christmas Eve and sentenced to death. Stones was sentenced to death at a separate court martial several days later for casting away his rifle in the same incident. The sentences were supported by Brigadier-General H O'Donnell, who wrote that he had doubts about the quality of the evidence, but felt that the executions were necessary to set an example to other men in the battalion.O'Donnell's letter is reproduced at http://www.janpieterchielens.be/shotatdawn/page28.html  by the Shot at Dawn Campaign group. All three men were executed on 18 January. The chaplain who prayed with them before their deaths remarked that he had never met three braver men."]}, {"page": "John Bevan (musician)", "response": ["In 1959, he was conscripted into the army stationed at Woolwich, London, as a musician in the Royal Artillery Staff Band. This was short-lived due to a compassionate discharge owing to the unexpected death of his father at a very early age. This did not quell his interest for music, however, and he formed the John Bevan Quartet, which became popular in the Birmingham area and also was the regular feature at the Perry Hall Hotel, Bromsgrove for many years. Classical music at this time was not the forefront of his musical activities but an opportunity presented itself in 1962 when the Bromsgrove Music Festival invited him to perform. With able assistance from the Bromsgrove String Orchestra under the conductorship of Joseph Stones he performed Richard Strauss's Duo Concerto for Bassoon and Clarinet. John was honoured to partner with Harold Evans, principle bassoonist with the Birmingham Symphony Orchestra."]}, {"page": "Stones, Joseph", "response": ["#redirectJoseph Stones"]}]}}
