Still a youth player, it was almost two years before he made his debut, in a drab 0\u20130 draw with Scunthorpe, at the end of the 1965\u201366 season.\nThe following season saw Thomas establish himself as the club's first choice right back, and he also achieved his first international honours, being selected for the Welsh under-23 squad. Widely recognised as one of the best defenders outside of the First Division, Thomas made his full international debut in a 0\u20130 draw with Northern Ireland in 1967 \u2013 he remains the club's most capped international footballer.\nDespite interest from bigger clubs, Thomas went on to make nearly 300 appearances for Swindon, including the 1969 League Cup final. By the time he left in 1973, he had made the most international appearances ever by a Swindon player, having played in thirty matches for Wales. He moved on to Derby County, when former Town manager Dave Mackay offered \u00a3100,000 for Thomas' signature. At Derby he was part of the team that won the First Division in 1975.Thomas left Derby in 1977, joining Cardiff City for \u00a310,000, making his debut in a 2\u20130 win over Stoke City. His four years at Cardiff were hampered by injuries and, in 1981, he returned to Gloucester City.\nHe made another twenty appearances for his country, and had brief spells at Newport County, Bath City and Barry Town, before his retirement in 1982.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Brigadoon", "response": ["|colspan='1' align=center| Rod Thomas"]}, {"page": "Gloucester City A.F.C.", "response": ["* Rod Thomas \u2013 47 caps for Wales."]}, {"page": "Summer Sundae", "response": ["*Rod Thomas"]}, {"page": "Warwick School", "response": ["* Rod Thomas: musician, Bright Light Bright Light"]}, {"page": "Latitude Festival", "response": ["*Rod Thomas"]}, {"page": "Bert Head", "response": ["This system produced many future Swindon greats\u00a0\u2013 Trollope, Mike Summerbee, Bobby Woodruff, Ernie Hunt, Keith Morgan, Roger Smart, Rod Thomas, David 'Bronco' Layne and Don Rogers to name but a few\u00a0\u2013 and, as they gradually climbed the league table, the team earned the nickname, \"Bert's Babes\".
