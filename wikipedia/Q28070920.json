Born in Aberlour parish to a local surgeon, she was educated in Hampshire, and was left an only child when her elder brother died in India in 1852. Two years later, she inherited a large fortune from her uncle, Alexander Grant, an Aberlour-born planter and merchant who had become rich in Jamaica.\nMacpherson Grant took up residence in Aberlour House, which had been built for her uncle by William Robertson. She lived unconventionally for a woman of her time, dressing in a manner one newspaper called \"manly\", and entering into what was described as a form of marriage with a female companion, Charlotte Temple, whom she had met in London in 1864. Macpherson Grant donated generously to charitable enterprises, especially those associated with the Scottish Episcopal Church, establishing an orphanage (now the Aberlour Child Care Trust) and founding St Margaret's Episcopal Church in Aberlour. She drank heavily, and despite attempts by friends and family members to persuade her to stop, she always relapsed into alcoholism.\nShe made several wills over the course of her life that would have left her estate to Temple but, shortly after Temple left her to marry a man, Macpherson Grant revoked her will; she died intestate five months later aged forty-two. Her disinherited former companion sued, and the court determined that the bulk of her fortune should go to cousins, who were most likely unknown to her.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Aberlour", "response": ["Aberlour once was the site of an orphanage which was founded in 1875 by Margaret Macpherson Grant and a minister called Charles Jupp. His tomb lies in St Margaret's Episcopal Church which was the church used by the children of the orphanage. The orphanage was split into two separate units \u2013 one for the girls and the other for the boys. Between the two buildings was the school where the children were taught. Aberlour Child Care Trust is now one of Scotland's main children's charities with services throughout Scotland.  The Trust was also found to be a child care institution where children suffered physical, emotional and sexual abuse at the Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry in 2021."]}, {"page": "1877 in Scotland", "response": ["* 14 April \u2013 Margaret Macpherson Grant, heiress and philanthropist (born 1834)"]}, {"page": "1834 in Scotland", "response": ["* 27 April \u2013 Margaret Macpherson Grant, heiress and philanthropist (died 1877)"]}, {"page": "Margaret Grant", "response": ["* Margaret Macpherson Grant (1834\u20131877), Scottish heiress and philanthropist"]}, {"page": "Margaret MacPherson", "response": ["* Margaret Macpherson Grant (1834\u20131877), Scottish heiress and philanthropist"]}]}}
