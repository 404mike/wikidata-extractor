A year later he was made associate director, and in 1986 he was promoted to the post of artistic director of the company. During his tenure, he succeeded in checking declining technical standards among the soloists and the corps de ballet, and he encouraged and nurtured many world-class talents, among them Darcey Bussell, Jonathan Cope, Sylvie Guillem, and Carlos Acosta.Rupert Christiansen, \"Happy Birthday to Anthony Dowell, a Ballet Marvel\", The Telegraph (London), 11 February 2013. In 1987, his new production of Swan Lake drew sharp criticism from the press and audiences alike. A number of traditional dance passages, created by Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov for their 1885 revival. were cut, much to the displeasure of balletomanes. Additional choreography by Frederick Ashton and Rudolf Nureyev added a certain interest to the development of the story but could not make up for omissions of well-loved dances. Further, radical changes in sets and costume, designed by Yolanda Sonnabend, evoked muttering among viewers. Costumes for acts 1 and 3, set in the opulence of Romanov Russia in the 1890s, were \"festooned with ribbons and golden squiggles\" while those for acts 2 and 4 dressed the swans in \"champagne ball-gowns rather than pristine white feathers\".Ismene Brown, \"Will the Real Swan Lake Please Stand Up\", The Spectator (London), 21 February 2015.
