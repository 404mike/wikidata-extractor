At half-time at the opening game of the season at Vale Park, fans were surprised to hear an announcement over the public address system telling them not to sing songs deriding rivals Stoke City. Mark Goodlad picked up an injury, allowing Jonny Brain the chance to impress between the sticks. At the end of September, star midfielder Steve Brooker was sold to Bristol City for \u00a3225,000. The club failed to bring in Christian Roberts in return, though Marc Goodfellow was signed on a four-week loan deal the following month. Teenage defender James O'Connor also joined on loan from Aston Villa. In November, Andreas Lipa returned to his homeland to play for Austria Lustenau, after Foyle released the injury-plagued defender. McMahon also left the club to join Leyton Orient. Foyle brought a new signing to Vale Park though, with striker Nathan Lowndes joining on a free transfer from Plymouth Argyle. In December, defender Tyrone Loran joined on a one-month loan from Tranmere Rovers, though returned to Prenton Park when the loan deal was up, after Foyle failed to sign him permanently. Christian Hanson was also signed from non-league Billingham Synthonia. Foyle also signed Nigerian defender George Abbey, who had been released by Macclesfield Town. In January, Dean Smith retired as a player and took up coaching at Leyton Orient. As a replacement, former Vale player Tommy Widdrington joined until the end of the season on non-contract terms. In February, veteran midfielder Danny Sonner joined on a one-month loan from Peterborough United. In March, club legend and former teammate of Foyle, Tony Naylor, joined on an emergency short-term contract, though never took to the field. Tony Dinning also was signed on loan from Bristol City. In addition to this, Mark Innes joined on a free transfer from Chesterfield. Sonner's loan deal was also extended until the end of the season, at which point he was signed permanently, as was Dinning. Vale lost to fellow relegation strugglers Torquay United and Wrexham in the last five games of the season, though a 5\u20130 win over Barnsley ensured the club's safety from the drop.", "At the end of the season teenage prodigy David Hibbert was snapped up by Preston North End, who paid Vale \u00a335,000 after a tribunal. Four players were also released: Simon Eldershaw (Northwich Victoria); Christian Hanson (Billingham Synthonia); Levi Reid (Stafford Rangers); and Ryan Brown (Leek Town). Ian Armstrong also retired due to injury.", "|align=\"left\"|DF||25||align=\"left\"| Christian Hanson", "| December 2004 || DF ||  || Christian Hanson || Billingham Synthonia || Free transfer || ", "| May 2005 || DF ||  || Christian Hanson || Billingham Synthonia || Released || "]}]}}
