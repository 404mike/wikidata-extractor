According to Sherri Rose, '\"the pun in the title, Reviewing Blindness, serves both as an invitation to the reader to rethink the origins of myths linked to blindness, and as a playful critique intended to draw awareness to the prevalence of ocularcentric rhetorical devices, such as visual metaphors (re-viewing), embedded in language. Through close readings of novels by writers including Honor\u00e9 de Balzac, Lucien Descaves, Jean Giono and Herv\u00e9 Guibert, Thompson argues that literary accounts of blindness can lead to a rich, multi-sensory experience which dismantles the hierarchy of the senses found in Western culture and celebrates the positive effects of blindness on both blind and non-blind readers and writers.
