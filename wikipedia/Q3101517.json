A two time Triple Crown winner, Davies would represent his country on nine occasions. A skillful player, Davies was unfortunate to be playing during the same period as Rhys Gabe, who was the selectors' first choice at his position. It was all the more unfortunate for Davies as it was a collision between himself and Gabe, during a Swansea match, that caused an injury that would allow Gabe to take his position for Wales.", "link_mentions": {}}}
