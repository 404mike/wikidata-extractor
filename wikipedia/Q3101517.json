A two time Triple Crown winner, Davies would represent his country on nine occasions. A skillful player, Davies was unfortunate to be playing during the same period as Rhys Gabe, who was the selectors' first choice at his position. It was all the more unfortunate for Davies as it was a collision between himself and Gabe, during a Swansea match, that caused an injury that would allow Gabe to take his position for Wales.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Davies", "response": ["George Davies may refer to:", "*George Davies (athlete) (born 1940), American pole vaulter", "*George Davies (baseball) (1868\u20131906), American major league pitcher", "*George Davies (cricketer) (1892\u20131957), Australian cricketer", "*George Davies (footballer, born 1897) (1897\u20131956), English footballer in the 1920s ", "*George Davies (footballer, born 1900) (1900\u20131942), English footballer in the 1920s", "*George Davies (footballer, born 1927) (born 1927), English footballer in the 1950s", "*George Davies (footballer, born 1996) (born 1996), Sierra Leonean footballer in the 2010s", "*George Davies (politician) (1875\u20131950), British Member of Parliament", "*George Davies (retailer) (born 1941), British fashion retailer", "*George Davies (rugby union) (1875\u20131959), Welsh international rugby player", "*John George Davies (1846\u20131913), generally known as (Sir) George Davies, a Tasmanian politician, newspaper proprietor and cricketer"]}, {"page": "George Davies (rugby player)", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Davies (rugby union)"]}]}}
