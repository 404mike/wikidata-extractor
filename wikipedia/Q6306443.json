Pinafore was first presented in 2001 on the QE2 cruise ship and sailed as far as Australia. Clarke's adaptation was designed to meet the ship's one-hour time limit for entertainments.  This was repeated in subsequent seasons on the H.M.S. President, a ship moored on the River Thames that doubled as the Festival Club for the Covent Garden Festival (Julia Goss played Little Buttercup), and in 2002 on a different cruise ship with both Pinafore and Mikado. In the energetic opening scene of Pinafore, the company erects the H.M.S. Pinafore right before the audience.  Clarke noted, \"Many an old sailor, when his sea-faring days were over, worked on the fly floor of a theatre ... used to signal cues to fly the scenery by whistling. That is the origin of the theatrical superstition that it is bad luck to whistle in the dressing room. ...  I wanted to find some visual way of showing this connection, so to have the sailors \"flying\" the scenery by pulling the ropes and tying them off would be a great trick. The company's typically zany version of Pinafore is played in Victorian dress with few textual and musical changes from the original.Beale, Robert. \"Luna-tic Pinafore is a shore-fire triumph\", Manchester Evening News, 25 March 2009.\"Fun on the high seas\".
