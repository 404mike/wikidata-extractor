He was apprenticed to Russian merchants and shipowners Carhill, Greenwood & Co. but little else is known about his early life except that at the age of ten he was in the care of a clergyman who taught him botany. He married Elizabeth Blundell in Hull on 30 June 1804 and very soon supported her brother Henry to set up the highly successful oil and colour company Blundell Spence. He was the father of artist and art dealer William Blundell Spence.\nHe became interested in entomology when he was 22 and immediately began a correspondence with leading entomologist William Kirby. Together they wrote Introduction to Entomology, published in four volumes between 1815 and 1826, the first popular book on entomology in English. Spence also published some 20 notes on entomology.\nIn 1822, he also published Tracts on Political Economy Viz. 1. Britain Independent of Commerce; 2. Agriculture the Source of Wealth; 3. The Objections Against the Corn Bill Refuted; 4. Speech on the East India Trade. With Prefatory Remarks on the Causes and Cure of Our Present Distresses as Originating from Neglect of Principles Laid Down in These Works  (London: Hurst, Rees, Orme and Brown, 1822).\nIn 1833 he was one of the founders of the Society of Entomologists of London, becoming its president in 1847. He was made an 'Honorary English Member' of the Entomological Society at the same time as Kirby was made Honorary Life President.\nHe was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in April 1834.He was the first editor of a Hull newspaper, the Hull Rockingham. There is a bust of him by Marochetti in the Hull museum.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Entomology", "response": ["Early entomological works associated with the naming and classification of species followed the practice of maintaining cabinets of curiosity, predominantly in Europe. This collecting fashion led to the formation of natural history societies, exhibitions of private collections, and journals for recording communications and the documentation of new species. Many of the collectors tended to be from the aristocracy and it spawned off a trade involving collectors around the world and traders. This has been called the \"era of heroic entomology.\" William Kirby is widely considered as the father of entomology in England. In collaboration with William Spence, he published a definitive entomological encyclopedia, Introduction to Entomology, regarded as the subject's foundational text. He also helped to found the Royal Entomological Society in London in 1833, one of the earliest such societies in the world; earlier antecedents, such as the Aurelian society date back to the 1740s. In the late 19th century, the growth of agriculture, and colonial trade, spawned off the \"era of economic entomology\" which created the professional entomologist associated with the rise of the university and training in the field of biology."]}, {"page": "William Kirby (entomologist)", "response": ["Kirby began planning his Introduction to Entomology, a celebrated title, in 1808.

The book was illustrated by John Curtis. It reached its seventh edition in 1856.

Charles Curtis died young and his widow, Frances, became a flower grower. She encouraged her son to study natural history with a local naturalist, Richard Walker (1791\u20131870). At the age of 16 he became an apprentice at a local lawyer's office in Norwich but devoted his spare time to studying and drawing insects and, with insect collecting becoming a growing craze, he found he could make a living selling the specimens he found. At this time he became a friend of Simon Wilkin (1790\u20131862), finally leaving his job and living with Wilkin at Costessey where he undertook systematic insect studies. Through Wilkin he met the entomologists William Kirby and William Spence and his illustrations were published in An Introduction to Entomology (1815\u20131826)."]}, {"page": "Charles Darwin's education", "response": ["Arriving at the University of Cambridge in January 1828, Darwin found this elite theological training institution governed by complex rules much more congenial than his experiences at Edinburgh. No rooms were available at Christ's College, so he took lodgings above a tobacconists in Sidney Street, across the road.  Extramural activities were important, and while Darwin did not take up sports or debating, his interests included music and his main passion was the current national craze for the (competitive) collecting of beetles. Trainee clergymen scoured Cambridgeshire for specimens, referring to An Introduction to Entomology by William Kirby and William Spence. Charles joined his older cousin William Darwin Fox who was already a skilled collector and like him got a small dog. The two and their dogs became inseparable.  They explored the countryside as Darwin learnt about natural history from his cousin. Darwin became obsessed with winning the student accolade and collected avidly. Once he stripped bark from a dead tree and caught a ground beetle in each hand, then saw the rare Crucifix Ground Beetle,  Panagaeus cruxmajor. With the habits of an egg-collector, he popped one ground beetle in his mouth to free his hand, but it ejected some intensely acrid fluid which burnt his tongue and Darwin was forced to spit it out. He lost all three. describes the incident and states that the insect Darwin popped into his mouth was a bombardier beetle.*They cite Darwin's correspondence and his Autobiography ()* quotes the Autobiography, and while its illustration shows a bombardier beetle, it says \"Many beetles, including the Brachinus crepitans and the Stenaptinus insignis, release irritating chemicals as a defense.\"*Letter 1009 \u2013 Darwin, C. R. to Jenyns, Leonard, 17 Oct (1846) describes the two beetles as unidentified carabi, or ground beetles.* The specimens he did not lose had to be mounted and identified, and his knowledge from Edinburgh of Lamarck proved useful. Fox introduced him for advice on identification to the Revd. John Stevens Henslow, professor of botany, and Darwin began attending his soir\u00e9es, a club for budding naturalists.

In fact, in these ancient times, the confusion between the two insects led to the disproven notion that bees undergo spontaneous generation from decaying carcasses.
