According to the British Museum it is from the 1st century BC. James R. Russell suggests that it was probably cast in western Asia Minor in the 2nd\u20131st centuries BC. Vrej Nersessian writes that it was probably created in Asia Minor in the mid-4th century BC. Terence Mitford argued, based on its style, that it is a work of the \"late Hellenistic or early Roman period\". He cites Reynold Higgins, who suggested that \"it may be a cast from a mould made in c. 150 B.C., whether a Greek or Hellenistic original, or a Roman copy.\" Brunilde Sismondo Ridgway writes that it is dated no earlier than the Augustan period. Babken Arakelian argued, based on a stylistic analysis, that the head is similar to statues created in Asia Minor in the 2nd century BC."]}]}}
