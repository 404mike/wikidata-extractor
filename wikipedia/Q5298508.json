She was a pioneer of female independence and female motoring, and taught Queen Alexandra and the Royal Princesses how to drive. In 1905 she established the record for the longest drive achieved by a lady driver by driving a De Dion-Bouton from London to Liverpool and back over two days, receiving the soubriquets in the press of the Fastest Girl on Earth, and the Champion Lady Motorist of the World.\nLevitt's book The Woman and the Car: A Chatty Little Handbook for all Women who Motor or Who Want to Motor, recommended that women should \"carry a little hand-mirror in a convenient place when driving\" so they may \"hold the mirror aloft from time to time in order to see behind while driving in traffic\", thus inventing the rear-view mirror before it was introduced by manufacturers in 1914.  She also advised women travelling alone to carry a handgun; her recommendation was an automatic Colt, as in her opinion its relative lack of recoil made it particularly suitable for women.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "May 17", "response": ["*1922 \u2013 Dorothy Levitt, English racing driver and journalist (b. 1882)"]}, {"page": "Penelope Keith", "response": ["In 2009 she presented Penelope Keith and the Fast Lady, a one-off documentary for BBC Four about Dorothy Levitt, the Edwardian motoring pioneer.

As other vehicles had been, cars were incorporated into artworks including music, books and movies. Between 1905 and 1908, more than 120 songs were written in which the automobile was the subject. Although authors such as Booth Tarkington decried the automobile age in books including The Magnificent Ambersons (1918), novels celebrating the political effects of motorization included Free Air (1919) by Sinclair Lewis, which followed in the tracks of earlier bicycle touring novels. Some early 20th century experts doubted the safety and suitability of allowing female automobilists. Dorothy Levitt was among those who laid such concerns to rest, so much so that a century later there was only one country where women were forbidden to drive. Where 19th-century mass media had made heroes of Casey Jones, Allan Pinkerton and other stalwart protectors of public transport, new road movies offered heroes who found freedom and equality, rather than duty and hierarchy, on the open road."]}, {"page": "Motorboat", "response": ["The first competition, held in July 1903, at Cork Harbour in Ireland, and officiated by the Automobile Club of Great Britain and Ireland and the Royal Victoria Yacht Club, was a very primitive affair, with many boats failing even to start.

During the weeks before the race the cars were tested around the island's roads, during which Arnott managed the fastest circuit of the course. There were also a number of accidents during the practices; Ernest de Wilton crashed his Swift into a stone wall near Castletown, causing significant damage to the car. Although it was repaired in time there was a miscommunication between de Wilton and the race organisers, and de Wilton did not present the car for inspection in time to be entered into the race. Another of the competitors, A. McCormack in a Gladiator, hit some cows after coming off the road, and caused such damage to the car's brakes that it could not be repaired in time for the race. On the Sunday prior to the race local residents were upset that forty of the cars were driving the course, and meetings were held where they expressed their indignation that it was a \"desecration of the sanctity of the Sabbath\". Three days prior to the race, the organisers began weighing the cars and filling them with the specified amount of fuel.

Unlike Dorothy Levitt, her British contemporary who drove factory prepared cars, Joan always drove her own personal cars, although they were stripped down to the bare essentials for racing. After women were banned from racing, several of her male competitors trusted her to drive their race cars in order to set yet another women's speed record. In 1906, she would continue to hone her skills at a variety of tracks, usually one-half to one mile flat dirt ovals, used for horse-racing. There were no purpose-built automobile race tracks until the Indianapolis Motor Speedway was completed in 1909, both in attempts at speed records and in competition. She also competed in popular amateur automobile events called gymkhanas. These were obstacle course events for cars instead of horses. Drivers had to drive around and over obstacles and inclines, sometimes in reverse. At the Danbury Fair in 1906, Cuneo was driving full speed in a gymkhana with two women passengers when the car caught on fire. The passengers bailed out the back of the car but she calmly shut off the engine and turned off the gas before jumping out.
