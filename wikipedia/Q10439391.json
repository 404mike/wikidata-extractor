The club had recently slipped into the Football League Second Division and manager Alan Buckley had sought after a new number 1 keeper following the departure of Paul Crichton a year before, his replacement Jason Pearcey had failed to live up to expectations and would start the 1997\u201398 season as Davison's understudy. He made his Town debut on 9 August 1997 in a 1\u20131 draw with Bristol City. His period at Blundell Park would see him play a part in one of the most successful seasons with Grimsby defeating AFC Bournemouth in the Football League Trophy final at Wembley Stadium and a few weeks later defeating Northampton Town in the Play-Off final also at Wembley. During the 1998\u201399 season, Steve Croudson became his new understudy as Grimsby cemented themselves 11th spot in the First Division. During his two-year stay he helped the club set a new clean sheet record of 50 in 100 games."]}, {"page": "Jason Batty", "response": ["Batty was born in Auckland, New Zealand. He started his career at Norwich City F.C. in their Academy system, he then moved back in New Zealand for a period of time before heading back overseas to join up with Bohemian F.C. in the League of Ireland. He then made 14 appearances for a Singapore team S-League before joining the Football Kingz. Batty made 16 appearances for the Football Kingz in their inaugural season in the NSL in 1999 before heading back to the UK for a spell in England with Championship side Grimsby Town in August 2000. He failed to dislodge regular shot stopper Danny Coyne and understudy Steve Croudson. After only six months he left the club and joined Scunthorpe United on similar terms but left at the end of the season after failing to make a 1st Team appearance. He then briefly played for Stalybridge Celtic in the Conference League."]}, {"page": "Danny Coyne", "response": ["In 1999, he left for Grimsby Town managed by Alan Buckley where he was a replacement for Town's number 1 Aidan Davison who had transferred to Sheffield United. Coyne soon became a fans' favourite for the club where he would remain for four seasons. During his time at Blundell Park he was a regular in the first team whilst having rookie Steve Croudson as his under study for the entire four-year stay. During the 2001\u20132002 season Coyne was part of the Grimsby team that beat Premier League side Liverpool 2\u20131 at Anfield in the third round of the English League Cup. In both the 00-01 and 01-02 seasons Coyne's performances would go on to see him be crowned the Supporters Player of The Season, as well as this he became a regular fixture in the Welsh international side. In the 2002\u20132003 at Grimsby he was part of a Welsh International trio of himself, John Oster and Darren Barnard who were on the books at Town. It was during that season that Grimsby would find themselves being relegated from the First Division after a five-year stay, and this would see the end of Coyne's Grimsby career."]}, {"page": "Kenny Arthur", "response": ["Arthur signed a two-year deal with Grimsby Town on 8 June 2010 taking the number one spot from Nick Colgan. Grimsby who had suffered a goalkeeping crisis in both the past two seasons saw the new seasons preparations stall when Arthur injured his hamstring in the club's defeat against Rushden & Diamonds. Incidentally an injury to his understudy Colgan meant that goalkeeping coach Steve Croudson was called up to replace Arthur for at least one game before Sheffield Wednesday's Richard O'Donnell was signed. Arthur returned to action on 20 September, against Fleetwood Town only to injure his thumb in the warm up, meaning O'Donnell was forced to fill in once again."]}, {"page": "Jonathan Rowan", "response": ["Rowan joined Conference North side Kettering Town along with fellow former Grimsby teammate Steve Croudson.

McKeown played in the final of the Lincolnshire Senior Cup on 3 August 2011, beating Lincoln City 4\u20133 to win the cup at Sincil Bank."]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 Grimsby Town F.C. season", "response": ["|Steve Croudson"]}, {"page": "2007\u201308 Grimsby Town F.C. season", "response": ["|Steve Croudson"]}, {"page": "Andy Love (English footballer)", "response": ["Love was born in Grimsby, Lincolnshire, and began his football career as a trainee at hometown club Grimsby Town in 1995.
