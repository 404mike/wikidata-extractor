I took up bookbinding in 1902, and studied at the Evelyn Nordhoff Bindery in New York City. \" (At that time, the only teaching hand-bindery in the United States.)  She began formal studies in New York City with Florence Foote at the (Evelyn) Nordhoff Bindery in 1902, and soon moved to England to study in the studios of Nordhoff's teacher Thomas J. Cobden-Sanderson, his student Douglas Cockerell, and the firm of Sangorski & Sutcliffe.

Doebbelin, and Modern Pictorial Endpapers.\" Her collection was sought after by both librarians and book publishers and collectors. Her first published work, Marbled Paper, its History, Techniques and Patterns, grew out of a talk she had given to The Club of Odd Volumes in 1932. In 1942, the Department of Printing and Graphic Arts of the Harvard Library published her book Decorated Book Papers, illustrated with specimens of original papers, in a limited edition printing."]}, {"page": "Polly Lada-Mocarski", "response": ["The couple moved to Berlin, where her husband Valla was working.

Greenhill's early customers included Hilaire Belloc and Walter de la Mare."]}]}}
