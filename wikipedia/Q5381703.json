He plays the former for the Glenullin club and, previously, for the Derry county team. With Glenullin he won a Derry Senior Football Championship and with Derry he won a National League title. He also plays association football as a striker for Coleraine.Bradley usually plays corner forward for both club and county \u2013 often paired in a two-man inside forward line with brother Patsy, but has also played in the half-forward line. He is known for his searing pace, point scoring abilities, fantastic goals and surging runs through opposing teams' defence. His \"reckless adventure\" and liability to do the unexpected is also part of his effectiveness. Although a great talent, in the past he has been criticised for some of his shot selections from ridiculous angles. However, since 2011 his decision-making in front of goal has greatly improved, which has put down to  manager John Brennan.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bradley", "response": ["* Eoin Bradley (born 1983), Irish Gaelic footballer, plays for Derry"]}, {"page": "Portadown F.C.", "response": ["This had meant they would take on Ballymena United in Irish Cup semi-final at The Oval. Once again, within 25 minutes they had blown Ballymena away and were 3\u20130 up again with goals from Mark McAllister, Peter McMahon and Michael Gault, and sealed their place in the final by winning 3\u20131 that was met with wild celebrations from the large Portadown support and the players and management. With the Kop Stand at Windsor Park collapsing, the final was forced to be moved to The Oval, where they would take on Glentoran. In the league, Portadown played Glenavon at Mourneview Park with the winner being guaranteed third place and a lucrative UEFA Europa League qualifying round spot. Glenavon raced into a two-goal lead before James Singleton was sent off for clashing with Ken Oman. Portadown had levelled it 2\u20132 through Peter McMahon and Gary Twigg goals, before Eoin Bradley was hauled down by Ross Redman and a last-minute penalty was dispatched by Andy McGory. Portadown were strong favourites going into the final, but the final failed to live up to expectations, with virtually nothing happening in the first half. In the second half, David Scullion scored to give The Glens the lead after a controversial refereeing decision had denied Portadown a penalty just before what proved to be the only goal."]}, {"page": "John Mitchel's GAC Glenullin", "response": ["In 2010, Glenullin player Eoin Bradley brought shame upon the club, assaulting referee Declan O'Connor by punching him in the face. The incident ended up in court with Bradley being convicted and fined for the assault. The shame did not end there however. In 2017, Glenullin were due to play a match against Loup. When they discovered that Declan O'Connor was scheduled to referee, they refused to field a team which ended up costing them 3 league points."]}, {"page": "Gerard O'Kane", "response": ["O'Kane was born in Philadelphia PA but now lives in Glenullin near Garvagh.
