At first his focus was poetry, influenced by John Keats among others, but he gradually established a reputation as a novelist. The Ordeal of Richard Feverel (1859) briefly scandalized Victorian literary circles. Of his later novels, the most enduring is The Egoist (1879), though in his lifetime his greatest success was Diana of the Crossways (1885). His novels were innovative in their attention to characters' psychology, and also took a close interest in social change. His style, in both poetry and prose, was noted for its syntactic complexity; Oscar Wilde likened it to \"chaos illumined by brilliant flashes of lightning\". He was an encourager of other novelists, as well as an influence on them; among those to benefit were Robert Louis Stevenson and George Gissing. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature seven times.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Charles Dickens", "response": ["Among fellow writers, there was a range of opinions on Dickens. Poet laureate, William Wordsworth (1770\u20131850), thought him a \"very talkative, vulgar young person\", adding he had not read a line of his work, while novelist George Meredith (1828\u20131909), found Dickens \"intellectually lacking\".Neil Roberts, Meredith and the Novel. Springer, 1997, p. 49. In 1888 Leslie Stephen commented in the Dictionary of National Biography that \"if literary fame could be safely measured by popularity with the half-educated, Dickens must claim the highest position among English novelists\".Dictionary of National Biography Macmillan, 1888, p. 30. Anthony Trollope's Autobiography famously declared Thackeray, not Dickens, to be the greatest novelist of the age. However, both Leo Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoyevsky were admirers. Dostoyevsky commented: \"We understand Dickens in Russia, I am convinced, almost as well as the English, perhaps even with all the nuances. It may well be that we love him no less than his compatriots do. And yet how original is Dickens, and how very English!\" Tolstoy referred to David Copperfield as his favourite book, and he later adopted the novel as \"a model for his own autobiographical reflections\". French writer Jules Verne called Dickens his favourite writer, writing his novels \"stand alone, dwarfing all others by their amazing power and felicity of expression\".Soubigou, Gilles \"Dickens's Illustrations: France and other countries\" pp. 154-167 from The Reception of Charles Dickens in Europe edited by Michael Hollington London: A&C Black 2013 p. 161. Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh was inspired by Dickens's novels in several of his paintings like Vincent's Chair and in an 1889 letter to his sister stated that reading Dickens, especially A Christmas Carol, was one of the things that was keeping him from committing suicide.Soubigou, Gilles \"Dickens's Illustrations: France and other countries\" pp. 154-167 from The Reception of Charles Dickens in Europe edited by Michael Hollington London: A&C Black 2013 pp. 164-165. Oscar Wilde generally disparaged his depiction of character, while admiring his gift for caricature.. Henry James denied him a premier position, calling him \"the greatest of superficial novelists\": Dickens failed to endow his characters with psychological depth, and the novels, \"loose baggy monsters\",. betrayed a \"cavalier organisation\".. Joseph Conrad described his own childhood in bleak Dickensian terms, and noted he had \"an intense and unreasoning affection\" for Bleak House, dating back to his boyhood. The novel influenced his own gloomy portrait of London in The Secret Agent (1907). Virginia Woolf had a love-hate relationship with his works, finding his novels \"mesmerizing\" while reproving him for his sentimentalism and a commonplace style.."]}, {"page": "Dandy", "response": ["Previous manifestations of the petit-ma\u00eetre (French for \"small master\") and the Muscadin have been noted by John C.

The dandy cultivated cynical reserve, yet to such extremes that novelist George Meredith, himself no dandy, once defined cynicism as \"intellectual dandyism\". Some took a more benign view; Thomas Carlyle wrote in Sartor Resartus that a dandy was no more than \"a clothes-wearing man\". Honor\u00e9 de Balzac introduced the perfectly worldly and unmoved Henri de Marsay in La fille aux yeux d'or (1835), a part of La Com\u00e9die Humaine, who fulfils at first the model of a perfect dandy, until an obsessive love-pursuit unravels him in passionate and murderous jealousy."]}, {"page": "List of English-language poets", "response": ["*George Meredith (1828\u20131909, E)"]}, {"page": "February 12", "response": ["*1828 \u2013 George Meredith, English novelist and poet (d. 1909)"]}, {"page": "May 18", "response": ["*  1909   \u2013 George Meredith, English novelist and poet (b. 1828)"]}, {"page": "Sonnet", "response": ["While the sonnet had now been adapted into a general-purpose form of great flexibility, by the end of the 19th century later writers had begun introducing their own variations.

He will be remembered as a writer of fiction, as the most supreme writer of fiction, it may be, that we have ever had.

Considered from the point of view of a creator of character he ranks next to him who made Hamlet. Had he been articulate, he might have sat beside him.

The cultural critic Harold Bloom has written that Gore Vidal believed that his sexuality had denied him full recognition from the literary community in the United States.

She was often sick in bed with rheumatism, and hard-pressed to continue her work at the Bohemian Club. Still, in March 1906 she gave a lengthy reading to the Pacific Coast Woman's Press Association entitled \"Some Women Poets of America.\" Coolbrith, third vice president and life member of the club, briefly discussed the most prominent early American women poets but focused more fully on ones that became known in the second half of the 19th century, reciting example verse, and critically evaluating the work. A month later, disaster struck in the form of calamitous fire following the April 1906 San Francisco earthquake: Coolbrith's home at 1604 Taylor Street burned to the ground. Directly after the earthquake but before fire threatened, Coolbrith left her house carrying a pet cat, thinking she would soon return. Her student boarder Robert Norman and her companion Josephine ZellerLeider, 1991, p. 217. were unable to carry more than another cat, a few small bundles of letters and Coolbrith's scrapbook. Immediately after he spotted heavy smoke from across the bay, Joaquin Miller took the ferry from Oakland to San Francisco in order to assist Coolbrith in saving her valuables from encroaching fire, but was prevented from doing so by soldiers who had orders to use deadly force against looters. In the blaze, Coolbrith lost 3,000 books including priceless signed first editions, artwork by Keith, many personal letters from famous people such as Whittier, Clemens, George Meredith and, above all, her nearly complete manuscript that was part autobiography and part history of California's early literary scene."]}, {"page": "Lady Diana Cooper", "response": ["Lady Diana Cooper was born at 23A Bruton Street in Mayfair, London, on 29 August 1892. Her mother, who was a devotee of the author George Meredith, named her daughter after the titular character in Meredith's novel Diana of the Crossways. Officially the youngest daughter of the 8th Duke of Rutland and his wife, the Duchess of Rutland, Lady Diana's biological father was the writer Henry (or Harry) Cust.Diana herself revealed in her autobiography that although she was brought up as a daughter of the 8th Duke of Rutland, she was actually fathered by Cust, a Lincolnshire landowner and MP. See Khan, Urmee. \"Allegra Huston Speaks of the Shock at Discovering She was the Love Child of a Lord\", The Daily Telegraph, 6 April 2009. As early as 1908, various pamphlets were being circulated by a former governess claiming that Cust fathered Diana Manners, and David Lindsay (a distant cousin of her mother) noted in his diary that the resemblance was said to be striking.See The Crawford Papers.

Cooper herself did not become aware of this until it was casually mentioned to her at a party after she had come out into society, though \"It didn\u2019t seem to matter\u2014I was devoted to my father and I liked Harry Cust too.\" She later wrote to a friend that \"I am cheered very much by Tom Jones on bastards and I like to see myself as a living monument to incontinence.\""]}]}}
