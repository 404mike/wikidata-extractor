This small majority, along with the outbreak of war in 1914 and the onset of one of the worst droughts ever to hit Western Australia, severely restricted Scaddan's policy in his second term.  The government's position was made even more unstable when, in January 1915, the Labor MLA for Roebourne, Joseph Gardiner, walked out of Parliament House, and did not return.  He subsequently left the state altogether, and in September 1915 his seat was declared vacant for non-attendance.  Labor lost the resulting by-election in November, leaving it with exactly half of the seats in parliament.  Meanwhile, Bertie Johnston, Labor's only member for a farming seat, had voted with the opposition several times in reaction to Scaddan's failure to fulfill a promise to reduce the price of crown land.  Eventually, Johnston resigned from the party and from parliament over the Nevanas affair, and was subsequently re-elected as an independent in January 1916.   This left the Labor government with a minority of seats, and in July 1916 the Liberal and Country parties cooperated to defeat the government.  Scaddan then asked the Governor Sir Harry Barron for a dissolution of parliament, but was refused.  Scaddan resigned as premier on 27 July 1916, and Liberal leader Frank Wilson took office."]}, {"page": "1910 in Australia", "response": ["*Governor of Tasmania \u2013 Major General Sir Harry Barron"]}]}}
