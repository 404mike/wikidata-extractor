Classified as \"non-warships\", the vessels were required to be tendered internationally as per Article 346 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). This received opposition from political parties, including Labour and the Scottish National Party, as well as trade unions, such as GMB and the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions, who criticized the potential loss of work for British shipyards. They recommended that the ships be reclassified as \"warships\" and therefore exempt from the treaty, allowing them to be built in British shipyards. Sir John Parker, whose recommendations formed the basis for the National Shipbuilding Strategy, also criticized the government's approach as \"not the right strategic approach\" and recommended that \"UK-only competition should be considered for future defence-funded vessels\".
