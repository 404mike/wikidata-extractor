From 1989 to 2000, the Tinderbox company hosted an annual Festival of New Irish Playwriting intended to present \"artistically dangerous\" new plays. The intention behind the Tinderbox was to challenge the sectarian hatreds that led to \"the Troubles\" of Northern Ireland and create a theater company that would \"despite the system\" put on new plays that might bring people together. Roddy was one of the co-artistic directors of the company. The Tinderbox company came to be in the 1990s and 2000s one of the leading theater companies in Belfast."]}]}}
