The Vickers team quickly assembled their plane and, at around 1:45\u00a0p.m. on 14 June, whilst the Handley Page team were conducting yet another test, the Vickers plane took off from Lester's Field. Alcock and Brown flew the modified Vickers Vimy, powered by two Rolls-Royce Eagle 360\u00a0hp engines which were supported by an on-site Rolls Royce team led by engineer Eric Platford.
