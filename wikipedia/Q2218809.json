He matriculated in 1845 at the University of London, where he earned in 1847 his bachelor's degree in mathematics and in 1849 his master's degree in mathematics and physics, as first in his class. Next he studied law and became a solicitor in 1853. After a few years of law practice he abandoned his law career and returned to mathematics, although he never had an academic position. He had his first mathematical paper published in 1848. In 1865 he was an important participant in the founding of the London Mathematical Society (LMS). From 1866 to 1892 he acted as legal counsel for LMS, from 1872 to 1880 he was the organization's treasurer, and from 1880 to 1882 its president. In 1896 he  received the De Morgan Medal of the  LMS. In 1878 he was elected FRS.\nRoberts published papers in several fields of mathematics, including geometry, interpolation theory, and Diophantine equations.\nRoberts and Pafnuty Chebyschev are jointly credited with the Roberts-Chebyshev theorem related to four-bar linkages.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Horncastle", "response": ["*Samuel Roberts (1827\u20131913), mathematician and Fellow of the Royal Society"]}, {"page": "Samuel Roberts", "response": ["Samuel Roberts may refer to:", "*Sir Samuel Roberts, 1st Baronet (1852\u20131926), British Conservative Member of Parliament, 1902\u20131923", "*Sir Samuel Roberts, 2nd Baronet (1882\u20131955), British Conservative Member of Parliament, 1921\u20131935", "*Samuel Roberts (Royal Navy officer), commander of HMS Starr in the War of 1812", "*Samuel Roberts (Sheffield writer) (1763\u20131848), cutler and social campaigner", "*Samuel Roberts (Welsh writer) (1800\u20131885), Welsh political and economic writer", "*Samuel Roberts (mathematician) (1827\u20131913), British mathematician", "*Samuel Roberts (rugby), English rugby union footballer who played in the 1880s", "*Samuel Roberts (1919\u20131940), English footballer who went by his middle name Grenville"]}, {"page": "Cognate linkage", "response": ["In kinematics, cognate linkages are linkages that ensure the same input-output relationship or coupler curve geometry, while being dimensionally dissimilar.
