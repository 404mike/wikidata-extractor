Upon his arrival, he outlined his \"five-year plan\" with the goal taking Leicester into the First Division. Bullock set about restructuring the playing squad, replacing several senior players who he deemed to hold too much power at the club, and implemented several new rules at the club. These included players being banned from riding on motorcycles. During the 1953\u201354 season, he led the club to the Second Division title and promotion to the First Division with an attacking philosophy centred around forwards Arthur Rowley and Derek Hines.

His goals ratio helped him to compete with Derek Hines for the centre forward position. He scored in every round of the 1960\u201361 FA Cup competition to help Leicester reach the final. However, after Leek's celebrations after the semi-final victory, manager Matt Gillies dropped his striker and replaced him with Hughie McIlmoyle for the final, which Leicester lost 2\u20130 to Tottenham Hotspur.
