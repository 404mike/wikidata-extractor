He was educated at Sherborne School, Dorset, and Worcester College, Oxford, where he took an degree in classics and philosophy. 1953 until 1959 he worked for The Times as a staff writer and correspondent in France and Algeria. His interest in provincial themes developed through work for Independent Television News, and as a correspondent for The Observer (1960\u201366), writing mostly about culture. His book The New French Revolution, first published in 1968, has been updated many times, most recently as France in the New Century: Portrait of a Changing Society (1999) Ardagh wrote other books to reflect \"real\" life in Europe. Tale of Five Cities, based on major provincial centers of Europe, appeared in 1979. Germany and the Germans he wrote 1987 together with his German wife Katharina. Ireland and the Irish (1994) drew on his own family roots. He was also managing editor of the Good Food Guide from 1966 to 1968, and European editor of the Good Hotel Guide for 25 years. Ardagh continued to work for better cross-Channel understanding as a member of the Franco-British Council (1992\u201398). There his name is associated with a study of publishing in France and Britain (1995), produced with the French historian, Fran\u00e7ois Crouzet. He was made a Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres by the French Government.His explorer roots went back to his childhood. His father Osmond Ardagh was a colonial administrator and played first-class cricket for Oxford University. His mother was Austrian. He was married four times, showing his \u201ccosmopolitan streak in his choice of wives: English, Czech (rescued from the Prague Spring of 1968), Australian and German\u201d(Katharina, born Schmitz, *1951 in Berlin).

Increased German control of the area was limited by the pooling of German coal and steel into the multinational European Coal and Steel Community in 1951. The nearby Saar region, containing much of Germany's remaining coal deposits, was handed over to economic administration by France as a protectorate in 1947 and did not politically return to Germany until January 1957, with economic reintegration occurring two years later. Parallel to the question of political control of the Ruhr, the Allies tried to decrease German industrial potential by limitations on production and dismantling of factories and steel plants, predominantly in the Ruhr. By 1950, after the virtual completion of the by-then much watered-down \"level of industry\" plans, equipment had been removed from 706 manufacturing plants in the west, and steel production capacity had been reduced by 6.7 million tons.Gareau (1961), pp. 517\u2013534 Dismantling finally ended in 1951.

Beside de Gaulle's ordinances granting, for the first time in France, right of vote to women, the GPRF passed various labour laws, including the 11 October 1946 act establishing occupational medicine.

With government support, younger, more active farmers bought out their neighbors, enlarged their properties, and used the latest in mechanization, new seeds, fertilizers, and new techniques. The result was a revolution in agricultural output, as well as a sharply reduced number of active farmers from 7.4 million in 1946 to only 2 million in 1975.  It also resulted in millions of empty old farm houses. They were promptly purchased and upgraded by Frenchmen who wanted a rural retreat away from the frenzy of their primary work in the cities.
