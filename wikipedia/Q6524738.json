With Colin Gill in 2005 he co-authored the book Topple the Mighty \"about knocking down statues of unpopular leaders\". The book's foreword was by George Galloway, who Kuhn helped during the 2005 United Kingdom general election. Some of his work was used by Respect \u2013 The Unity Coalition from 2005 to 2008 and by the Stop the War Coalition from 2007 onwards. His Statue of Liberty work was used in the film Children of Men.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Brian Haw", "response": ["On 2 June 2001, he began camping in Parliament Square in central London in a one-man political protest against war and foreign policy (initially, the Economic sanctions against Iraq). By his own account, he was first inspired to take up his vigil after seeing the images and information produced by the Mariam Appeal, an anti-sanctions campaign. Haw justified his campaign on a need to improve his children's future. He only left his makeshift campsite to attend court hearings, surviving on food brought by supporters. Support for Haw's protest came from former Labour cabinet minister Tony Benn and activist/comedian Mark Thomas. Among the artwork displayed was a Banksy stencil of two soldiers painting over a peace sign and Leon Kuhn's anti-war political caricature 3 Guilty Men, which, together with Kuhn's The Proud Parents, Mark Wallinger later displayed in his recreation at the Tate in 2007."]}, {"page": "Azlan McLennan", "response": ["McLennan has cited the artists John HeartfieldAzlan McLennan Artabase.
