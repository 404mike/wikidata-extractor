Craddock earned and scored a penalty after Grimsby had taken an early lead, and then, deep into injury time, crashed the ball into the far corner from long range to secure a vital point for Luton. Luton Town history was made in this game as striker Jordan Patrick pulled on the number 29 shirt to become the club's youngest ever player \u2013 at 16 years and 7 days, Patrick came off the bench to set up Craddock's equaliser. Craddock scored again in a 2\u20131 win against Bury to quickly establish himself in the team. Parkin, one of the club's highest earners, returned from injury during this game, but failed to score. He was sent out on loan to Leyton Orient days later, with a view to a permanent deal. Three days later, a Tuesday night game against AFC Bournemouth at Kenilworth Road was abandoned after only eight minutes due to bad weather.", "|align=\"left\"|29||align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Jordan Patrick"]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Luton Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|31||align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Jordan Patrick"]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Luton Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|32||align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Jordan Patrick"]}]}}
