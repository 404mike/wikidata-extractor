He played for Birmingham City in the top flight and for several clubs in the North of England in the lower divisions of the Football League.

He went straight into the starting eleven, but scored only once in his first six games, lost his place, and was unable to regain it. The following season, in the First Division, Garrett had a run of games in place of Harold Bodle: he scored four goals, of which one was the only goal of the game, and two secured 1\u20131 draws, yet as soon as Bodle became available for selection, Garrett was dropped.Matthews, pp. 183\u201384.

The match went goalless to the last half-minute of normal time, when Harold Bodle was unmarked  from goal.
