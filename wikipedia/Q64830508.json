She studied, wrote and lectured on philosophy and science, alongside publishing two volumes of poetry. Several collected works were published following her death at the young age of 31. In her honour, Robert Lewins established the Constance Naden Medal and had a bust of her installed at Mason Science College (now the University of Birmingham). William Ewart Gladstone considered her one of the 19th century's foremost female poets.", "From the late 1870s onwards Naden developed a philosophy called Hylo-Idealism in collaboration with Robert Lewins, MD, whom she first met in 1876 and corresponded with for the rest of her life. The key principle of this philosophy is that \"Man is the maker of his own Cosmos, and all his perceptions \u2013 even those which seem to represent solid, extended and external objects \u2013 have a merely subjective existence, bounded by the limits moulded by the character and conditions of his sentient being.\"Constance Naden, \u2018The Brain Theory of Mind and Matter\u2019, in Induction and Deduction (London: Bickers & Son, 1890), p. 157  She was interested in Herbert Spencer's concept of a unifying philosophy that sought to explain the universe through the principles of evolution. In his work The Social Organism (1860), Spencer compares society to a living organism and argues that, just as biological organisms evolve through natural selection, society evolves and increases in complexity through analogous processes. reprinted in  Naden agreed with this, since the theme of unity is central to Hylo-Idealism, which seeks to reconcile materialism and idealism, poetry and science, the self and other.", "In 1889 a diagnosis of infected ovarian cysts was deemed to require surgery; on 5 December she was operated on by Lawson Tait, and while initially this was a success, on 23 December she died of a related infection.Constance Naden: A Memoir, ed. William R. Hughes (London: Bickers & Son, 1890), p.56 Naden's last letter to Robert Lewins, which is printed on the opening pages of the 1891 essay collection Further Reliques of Constance Naden details the circumstances of the surgery and her worries regarding it.Further Reliques of Constance Naden, (London: Bickers & Son, 1891) She was buried in the nonconformist Key Hill Cemetery, Birmingham.'Famous graves of Key Hill Cemetery in the Jewellery Quarter', Birmingham Mail, 7 November 2014. The gravestone was badly damaged over the course of the twentieth century, and in September 2017 a campaign was launched to replace it with a more fitting memorial. A rededication ceremony for the new gravestone took place on Saturday 11 May 2019.", "Naden was lauded after her death for her philosophical writings, by Robert Lewins, M.D., her contributions to poetry, her support of the women's suffrage cause in popular women's periodicals,Women's Penny Paper reports, 1889\u201390 and for her \"Pantheistic view of immortality\" by William Ewart Gladstone, in which he ranked her among the nineteenth century's top female poets. Lewins founded the Constance Naden Medal at Mason College in her honour, which is awarded each year, first for the \"best competitive philosophical essay\" and now for the best Faculty of Arts master's degree thesis at the University of Birmingham. Lewins also commissioned a bust of Naden which he presented to Mason's College. It sits on a plinth of three books, the spine of which are inscribed \"Songs and Sonnets of Springtime and A Modern Apostle, The Elixir of Life, etc.\" on the front and \"Induction and Deduction and Hylo-Idealism\" on the back. It was originally placed in the college's library. Mason College became the University of Birmingham in 1900, and the bust stands in the Cadbury Research Library Reading Room."]}, {"page": "Lewins, Robert", "response": ["#redirectRobert Lewins"]}]}}
