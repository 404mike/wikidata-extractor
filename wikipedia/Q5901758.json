While at Hastings, he \"discovered\" Horace Glover and recommended him to his former club \u2013 Glover went on to make over 170 appearances for Southampton in the next five years, before joining West Ham United."]}, {"page": "Victor Norbury", "response": ["Norbury was born in Bartley on the eastern edge of the New Forest. His youth football was played for the village team and later for Brockenhurst, from where he joined Southampton in 1905. Norbury spent most of his football career in the reserves, but made his debut for the first team as a replacement at left-back for Horace Glover away to Brentford on 29 September 1906. Norbury retained his place for the next match, in a 5\u20131 victory at home to Millwall. This was the \"Saints\" first win of the season (having managed only two draws in the first five matches); despite this, Norbury lost his place back to Glover and made only one further first-team appearance, taking over from Jack Eastham at right-back at home to Clapton Orient on 16 February 1907."]}, {"page": "John Robertson (footballer, born 1884)", "response": ["In 1908\u201309, Robertson was in-and-out of the side, alternating with Horace Glover at left-back in the early part of the season before a handful of matches in the latter part of the season at half-back. In the following season, he missed only six matches and played in all five defensive roles, as well as making one appearance up front, this time at outside-left. Injury caused him to miss a large part of the 1910\u201311 season, but he returned in March at left-half, following the transfer of Bert Trueman to Sheffield United."]}, {"page": "Victor Glover", "response": ["* Horace Glover (1883\u20131967), also known by middle name Victor, English footballer"]}, {"page": "George Brown (footballer, born 1883)", "response": ["Brown was born in the Longfleet St Mary parish of Poole and had represented the Dorset County F.A. In March 1910, he was invited to The Dell for a trial; considered \"up to scratch\", he took the place of Horace Glover at left-back (Glover had moved to centre-forward in the absence of Charlie McGibbon) for the Southern League match at Bristol Rovers on 26 March 1910. Described as \"tall, weighty and muscular\", Brown played well enough to earn another match, a week later, at home to Norwich City."]}, {"page": "George Smith (footballer, born 1886)", "response": ["His first-team debut came on 21 March 1908 when he took the place of Horace Glover at left-back for the home Southern League match against Norwich City, which ended in a  3\u20130 defeat. Smith made two further appearances in April, at right-half and right-back. Smith was never given a long run of matches in the first-team and was used as cover for more established players. He made five appearances in 1908\u201309, followed by four in 1909\u201310 and his final appearance came in the last match of the 1910\u201311 season. Of his 13 appearances, all but three were as a full-back, although he was played at outside-right at Northampton Town on 29 January 1910."]}, {"page": "Horace (given name)", "response": ["*Horace Glover (1883\u20131967), English professional footballer"]}]}}
