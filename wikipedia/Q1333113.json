Olympic trials were held in November 1997 to select Canada's representatives at the Olympics. The Schmirler rink finished first in the round robin, and defeated Shannon Kleibrink in the final with a score of 9\u20136, behind strong shot making from Schmirler and McCusker.Lefko, pp. 62\u201365 Schmirler made a difficult in-off to win and clinch the berth to the Olympics. The 1998 Winter Olympics were held in Nagano, Japan. The Schmirler rink was among the favourites for gold, but there was a strong field in the event. After finishing the round robin in first place with six wins and one loss, Canada played their semifinal game against Great Britain's Kirsty Hay. The game was tied after regulation play and went to an extra end, where Schmirler barely made a draw with her last rock to win the game. In the final against Denmark's Helena Blach Lavrsen, Schmirler secured a win in nine ends, winning Canada the gold medal.Lefko, pp. 72\u201377 After winning the gold medal, Sandra appeared on the front page of The New York Times.Lefko, p. 77 After the Olympics, the Schmirler rink was named 'Team of the Year' by the Canadian Press. The team were also inducted into the Canadian Curling Hall of Fame in 1999. After returning from the Olympics, Schmirler and her rink had to compete almost immediately in the Scott Tournament of Hearts as Team Canada. Schmirler and her team made the playoffs, and won the 3 vs. 4 playoff game before dropping the semifinal to Anne Merklinger. After losing in the semis, Schmirler joined CBC as a colour commentator for the final match.Lefko, pp. 83\u201385"]}, {"page": "Curling at the 1998 Winter Olympics", "response": ["|||Kirsty Hay||Edith Loudon||Jackie Lockhart||Katie Loudon||Felsie Bayne", "|4|| || Kirsty Hay || 4 || 5", "|Sandra Schmirler || 85% ||Kirsty Hay || 76%", "|Elisabet Gustafson || 85% ||Kirsty Hay || 68%", "|  Kirsty Hay || 71"]}, {"page": "World Junior Curling Championships", "response": ["|Kirsty Hay"]}, {"page": "Canada at the 1998 Winter Olympics", "response": ["| || Kirsty Hay || 4 || 3"]}, {"page": "Japan at the 1998 Winter Olympics", "response": ["| || Kirsty Hay || 4 || 3"]}, {"page": "Sweden at the 1998 Winter Olympics", "response": ["| || Kirsty Hay || 4 || 3"]}, {"page": "United States at the 1998 Winter Olympics", "response": ["| || Kirsty Hay || 4 || 3"]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 1998 Winter Olympics", "response": ["| || Kirsty Hay || 4 || 3", "|Kirsty Hay||Edith Loudon||Jackie Lockhart||Katie Loudon||Felsie Bayne"]}, {"page": "Norway at the 1998 Winter Olympics", "response": ["| || Kirsty Hay || 4 || 3"]}, {"page": "Germany at the 1998 Winter Olympics", "response": ["| || Kirsty Hay || 4 || 3"]}, {"page": "Denmark at the 1998 Winter Olympics", "response": ["| || Kirsty Hay || 4 || 3"]}, {"page": "Scottish Women's Curling Championship", "response": ["| 1995 || Kirsty Hay || Edith Loudon || Joanna Pegg || Katie Loudon || Perth", "| 1996 || Kirsty Hay || Edith Loudon || Karen Addison || Katie Loudon || Perth", "| 1998 || Kirsty Hay || Edith Loudon || Jackie Lockhart || Katie LoudonAlternate: Fiona Bayne || Perth"]}, {"page": "1995 World Women's Curling Championship", "response": ["Skip: Kirsty Hay", "| || Kirsty Hay || 4 || 5"]}, {"page": "1996 World Women's Curling Championship", "response": ["Skip: Kirsty Hay", "| || Kirsty Hay || 5 || 4"]}, {"page": "1998 World Women's Curling Championship", "response": ["Skip: Kirsty Hay ", "| || Kirsty Hay || 4 || 5"]}, {"page": "1997 European Curling Championships", "response": ["|  || Kirsty Hay || 4 || 1"]}, {"page": "Frances Brodie Award", "response": ["| 1996 || Kirsty Hay || "]}, {"page": "1995 European Curling Championships", "response": ["|  || Kirsty Hay || 5 || 0"]}, {"page": "1994 European Curling Championships", "response": ["|  || Kirsty Hay || 4 || 1"]}, {"page": "Scottish Junior Curling Championships", "response": ["|Kirsty Hay (Perth), Fiona Brown, Joanna Pegg, Louise Wilkie"]}, {"page": "1992 European Curling Championships", "response": ["|  || Kirsty Hay || 3 || 3"]}, {"page": "1993 World Junior Curling Championships", "response": ["|  || Kirsty Hay || Gillian Barr || Joanna Pegg || Louise Wilkie || Fiona Brown ||", "| Women ||  Kirsty Hay ||  Kari Liapis ||  Joanna Pegg ||  Angela Street"]}, {"page": "Edith Loudon", "response": ["| Kirsty Hay || Edith Loudon || Joanna Pegg || Katie Loudon || Jackie Lockhart (ECC),Claire Milne (WCC) || Peter Loudon ||  (6th)SWCC 1995  (7th)", "| Kirsty Hay || Edith Loudon || Karen Addison || Katie Loudon || Claire Milne || Peter Loudon ||  SWCC 1996  (5th)", "| Kirsty Hay || Edith Loudon || Jackie Lockhart || Katie Loudon || Fiona Bayne || Jane Sanderson ||  (6th)SWCC 1998 WOG 1998 (4th) (7th)"]}, {"page": "Katie Loudon", "response": ["| Kirsty Hay || Edith Loudon || Joanna Pegg || Katie Loudon || Jackie Lockhart (ECC),Claire Milne (WCC) || Peter Loudon ||  (6th)SWCC 1995  (7th)", "| Kirsty Hay || Edith Loudon || Karen Addison || Katie Loudon || Claire Milne || Peter Loudon ||  SWCC 1996  (5th)", "| Kirsty Hay || Edith Loudon || Jackie Lockhart || Katie Loudon || Fiona Bayne || Jane Sanderson ||  (6th)SWCC 1998  WOG 1998 (4th) (7th)"]}, {"page": "Claire Milne", "response": ["| Kirsty Hay || Edith Loudon || Joanna Pegg || Katie Loudon || Claire Milne || Peter Loudon ||  (7th)", "| Kirsty Hay || Edith Loudon || Karen Addison || Katie Loudon || Claire Milne || Peter Loudon ||   (5th)"]}, {"page": "Kirsty Addison", "response": ["#redirect Kirsty Hay"]}, {"page": "Fiona Bayne", "response": ["| Kirsty Hay || Edith Loudon || Jackie Lockhart || Katie Loudon || Fiona Bayne || Jane Sanderson ||  (6th)SWCC 1998 WOG 1998 (4th) (7th)"]}]}}
