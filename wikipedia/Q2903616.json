He won 14 caps for Wales and was selected to play for the British Lions on the 1950 tour of Australia and New Zealand. He was in the Welsh team that won the 1950 Grand Slam.\nBorn in 1921 in Treorchy, Rhondda, Cleaver was an exciting attacking player with a shrewd change of pace. After one terrible game, under heavy weather conditions against Scotland, Cleaver gained the nickname 'Billy Kick'; though this was a harsh moniker considering his normal style of play. Cleaver was a coal miner by trade and spent most of his life within the industry, though in a managerial role for much of his later career. He was a keen patron of the arts: he was secretary of the Contemporary Arts Society for Wales (1972\u201391) and vice chairman of the Welsh Arts Council (1980\u201383).\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Treorchy", "response": ["*Billy Cleaver (1921\u20132003) \u2013 Wales international rugby player"]}, {"page": "Bleddyn Williams", "response": ["During war-time Williams joined Cardiff and switched his position to centre.

Each of Bleddyn's seven brothers also played for Cardiff, and his younger brother Lloyd represented Wales in the 1960s. At one time four of the siblings played in the same Cardiff team together and between them had a Cardiff career that spanned thirty years.

The club had a fantastic record against Newport during these years, going 15 games unbeaten against them between 1946 and 1950. Cardiff players helped Wales win their first Grand Slam in nearly forty years in 1950, and later that year supplied five players to the Lions for the first time later that year.

Although not the first club to form in the Rhondda, Treorchy provided the first international player to represent Wales while still playing for a valley club. In the opening game of the 1886 Home Nations Championship, Treorchy provided the first 'Rhondda forward' when Sam Ramsey was selected to face England. Although Ramsey would only win two caps, and the second took a wait of eight years, Treorchy would provide several players throughout their history, including Billy Cleaver who would eventually play for the British Lions In 1907, Treorchy was accused of throwing a rugby game against Aberdare, which gave Aberdare the Glamorgan League title. The resulting enquiry by the WRU saw the permanent suspension of Treorchy's entire committee.Fields of Praise, The Official History of the Welsh Rugby Union 1881-1981, David Smith, Gareth Williams (1980) pg 180 ", "*  Billy Cleaver (14 caps)"]}, {"page": "1950 British Lions tour to New Zealand and Australia", "response": ["|Billy Cleaver ||Full-back|||| Cardiff|| 3"]}, {"page": "1947\u201348 Australia rugby union tour of Britain, Ireland, France and North America", "response": ["WALES: Billy Cleaver, Ken Jones, Bleddyn Williams, Jack Matthews, Leslie Williams, Glyn Davies, Handel Greville, Emlyn Davies, Mal James, Cliff Davies, John Gwilliam, Bill Tamplin, Ossie Williams, Les Manfield, Gwyn Evans "]}, {"page": "Rex Willis", "response": ["When Tanner retired during the 1949/50 season, Willis was promoted into his position and gained regular first-class rugby. Although ignored for Welsh trials during 1949, the disastrous Five Nations Championship of that year forced the selectors to look for a new half-back partnership. Willis was chosen alongside team mate Billy Cleaver to face England at Twickenham in the opening game of the 1950 Championship in front of the largest crowd ever seen to date at the stadium.Godwin (1984), p. 235. Willis had an excellent match, releasing Cleaver, who in turn controlled the match which saw Wales win the game. In the next game against Scotland, Willis protected Cleaver from the Scottish back row which resulted in Cleaver scoring a drop goal. With tries from Thomas and Ken Jones Wales ran in easy winners after subduing the Scottish pack in the first half of the game.Godwin (1984), p. 236.

It may have been difficult to pick a full Lions side however as five members of that Lions touring party played for Cardiff; Billy Cleaver, Jack Matthews, Bleddyn Williams, Rex Willis and Cliff Davies.

Davies played his early club rugby for local team Cilfynydd RFC and sporadically he played for other more notable teams, playing his first game of four for Cardiff in the 1945/46 season. He joined Pontypridd where his natural ability was polished by endless training sessions under the tutorship of groundsman Dick Coates.Davies (1980), p. 307 It was while with Pontypridd that Davies was first called to the Wales national squad. His first cap was against Scotland in the 1947 Five Nations Championship, partnered at fly half with Haydn Tanner. Wales were comfortable winners, but the next game Davies was replaced by Billy Cleaver and Davies failed to be reselected for the rest of the campaign. In December 1947 Davies was chosen for his second Welsh international game, a 6\u20130 victory over the touring Australian team, this time partnered with Handel Greville.Griffiths (1987), p. 4:27"]}, {"page": "Cleaver (surname)", "response": ["*Billy Cleaver (1921\u20132003), Welsh rugby union player"]}]}}
