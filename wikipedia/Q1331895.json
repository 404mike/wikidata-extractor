His wishes were respected during his own lifetime, but in January 1834 a French translation, or rather imitation, was played in Brussels. Later in 1834 the original tragedy was performed at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane with Macready taking the title role. It was said that Byron had wanted Charlotte Mardyn to play the role of Myrrha as she had been Byron's lover. Macready was not keen to cast her and Ellen Tree played Myrrha. Almost twenty years later Charles Kean played Sardanapalus at the Princess's Theatre, London, with Ellen Tree (by then Mrs. Ellen Kean) again appearing as Myrrha. In 1877 the actor-manager Charles Calvert played Sardanapalus in his own adaptation of the play, and this adaptation was also staged at Booth's Theatre in New York."]}, {"page": "Ellen Keane", "response": ["Ellen Keane (born 6 April 1995) is an Irish Paralympic swimmer competing in S9, SM9 and SB8 classification events."]}, {"page": "Kean, Ellen", "response": ["#redirectEllen Kean"]}, {"page": "Long runs on the London stage, 1700\u20132020", "response": ["The first Shakespeare play to run for 100 nights was Charles Kean's production of King Henry VIII at the Princess's Theatre, with Walter Lacy as the King, Ellen Kean as Queen Katherine and Kean as Cardinal Wolsey.\"Royal Princess's Theatre\", The Standard, 17 May 1855. p. 1 It ran from 16 May 1855 to the end of the season on 14 September.
