The book received the Encore Award (2009), European Union Prize for Literature (2011) and was shortlisted for Man Booker Prize (2009) and Walter Scott Prize (2010). The book is based on the historical backdrop of a mental asylum run by Matthew Allen at High Beach in late 1830s and 1840s which had English poet John Clare admitted therein. Alfred, Lord Tennyson, another notable poet of the era, moves to High Beach to get his brother Septimus treated and Alfred, himself, has to overcome depression after the death of his close friend Arthur Hallam. The book narrates Clare's life, the asylum's effects on both poets and bases its storyline on the popular speculation of whether Clare and Tennyson had ever met.", "The Independent in the review written by Simon K\u00f6vesi, who is editor of the John Clare Society Journal, summed the book to be \"a heady mix of delicacy and grotesquery, intimacy and misanthropy.\" Author Adam Foulds notes that The Norton Anthology of English Literature that he studied in his college days dedicated only four pages to Clare but the poet's reputation increased significantly after Jonathan Bate published Clare's biography in 2003. Writing for The Washington Post, editor Ron Charles notes that the book is not the biography of Clare but \"its finely tuned sympathy will bring you close to the soul of an exuberant poet\". Charles also notes that the most moving parts of the book are of the episodes where Clare is wandering in the forest. The review in New Statesman appreciates Foulds for penning Clare's character that thinks in poems and also deemed Dr Allen and Tennyson's scenes together as awkward because of the historical nature of the book. Journalist and author Lionel Shriver notes that Foulds, who won Costa Poetry Award in 2008, keeps the book poetic without losing the plot. She also appreciates that despite featuring two poets with a background of mental asylum, the book does not \"conjure insanity as an exalted state of literary enlightenment.\" The New Yorkers critic James Wood mentions that Foulds has created his own poems in the book; like \"thick curds of summer cloud moving slowly over\"; while narrating the two poets and not simply borrowing their works. Indian writer Neel Mukherjee calls the book a \"subtle meditation on the mysterious nature of the creative process.\""]}, {"page": "Adam Samuel James Foulds", "response": ["#REDIRECT Adam Foulds"]}]}}
