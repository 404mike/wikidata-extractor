Columbia records objected that the songs she wanted to sing were not pop songs, but Streisand asserted the full creative control her contract gave her\u2014'I've always had the right to sing what I want'\u2014  with 1985's The Broadway Album, which was unexpectedly successful, holding the coveted No. 1 Billboard position for three straight weeks, and being certified quadruple platinum. The album featured tunes by Rodgers and Hammerstein, George Gershwin, Jerome Kern, and Stephen Sondheim, who was persuaded to rework some of his songs especially for this recording. The Broadway Album was met with acclaim, including a Grammy nomination for album of the year and handed Streisand her eighth Grammy as Best Female Vocalist. After releasing the live album One Voice in 1986, Streisand was set to release another album of Broadway songs in 1988. She recorded several cuts for the album under the direction of Rupert Holmes, including \"On My Own\" (from Les Mis\u00e9rables), a medley of \"How Are Things in Glocca Morra?\" and \"Heather on the Hill\" (from Finian's Rainbow and Brigadoon, respectively), \"All I Ask of You\" (from The Phantom of the Opera), \"Warm All Over\" (from The Most Happy Fella) and an unusual solo version of \"Make Our Garden Grow\" (from Candide). Streisand was not happy with the direction of the project and it was scrapped. Only \"Warm All Over\" and a reworked, lite FM-friendly version of \"All I Ask of You\" were ever released, the latter appearing on Streisand's 1988 effort, Till I Loved You. At the beginning of the 1990s, Streisand started focusing on her film directorial efforts and became almost inactive in the recording studio. In 1991, a four-disc box set, Just for the Record, was released. A compilation spanning Streisand's entire career to date, it featured over 70 tracks of live performances, greatest hits, rarities and previously unreleased material."]}, {"page": "Jamie Farr", "response": ["* Substituted in 2004 for the ailing Frank Gorshin starring as George Burns in the national tour of the one-man show Say Goodnight, Gracie.Say Goodnight, Gracie.
