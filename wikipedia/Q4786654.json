Clark remained in the job until 1957. Freddie Cox took over in 1962 and led the club to the Football League Fourth Division championship in the 1963\u201364 season, making him the first manager to win a Football League divisional title with the club. Basil Hayward was sacked in 1971 after the club was relegated back to the Fourth Division in the 1970\u201371 season, but his successor Andy Nelson led the club to promotion back to Division Three three years later before controversially resigning."]}]}}
