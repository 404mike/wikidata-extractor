He was a Professor Emeritus at Warwick University. He died on 9 June 2018.In 1996, he won a landmark case against a student who was stalking him, the first time anyone had won damages for being stalked and the first civil action in which a judge had defined stalking. The case was the topic of his memoir Being Stalked (1997), described by The Daily Telegraph as candid and troubling.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "5th Annual Grammy Awards", "response": ["**Robert Fine (engineer) for The Civil War, Vol. I performed by Martin Gabel & Frederick Fennell"]}, {"page": "6th Annual Grammy Awards", "response": ["**Robert Fine (engineer) for Civil War Vol. II performed by Frederick Fennell"]}, {"page": "On the Jewish Question", "response": ["For sociologist Robert Fine (2006)Robert Fine: Karl Marx and the Radical Critique of Anti-Semitism  in: Engage Journal 2, May 2006 Bauer's essay \"echoed the generally prejudicial representation of the Jew as 'merchant' and 'moneyman, whereas \"Marx's aim was to defend the right of Jews to full civil and political emancipation (that is, to equal civil and political rights) alongside all other German citizens\".

Tucker's paper stated that it is necessary to expand the definition of the halakhic process, and the Geller, Fine, and Fine paper redefined the corpus of Halakha as the representing the evolving beliefs and ideals of the Jewish people of a particular time and place as distinct from representing an infallible Divine will. While both papers had the support of at least 6 members, a majority of the CJLS found that both papers represented so extensive a change that they could not be accepted as a mere changes of Jewish law, but each should be regarded as a Takkanah that would uproot a Torah prohibition if passed.  Under the CJLS rules, once a majority of the committee found a responsum to be a Takkanah, accepting it would require a majority of the Committee (13 of 25 votes), while an ordinary responsum could be accepted as a valid alternative with as few as 6 of 25 votes.", ":In contrast, our colleagues Rabbis David Fine, Robert Fine and Myron Geller have argued that the verses in Leviticus should be understood to prohibit only those sexual relationships that offer no possibility of marriage. In an age when gay marriage is permitted by some jurisdictions, they argue, the Torah's ban is no longer universal. Although they present their reading as \u201cthe p\u2019shat,\u201d there is nothing simple or contextual about this interpretation. Nowhere does the passage mention marriage. The list of forbidden sexual relations includes menstrual sex, which can occur within a marital context. It is hard to accept that the Torah forbids bestiality only because it offers no opportunity for marriage. This reading, too, is sui generis \u2014 unsupported by either ancient or modern commentaries.", "Rabbis Myron Geller, Robert Fine, and David Fine wrote a dissent arguing for complete abolition of strictures against homosexual conduct, and explicit recognition of same-sex religious commitment ceremonies, on grounds that strictures were no longer socially relevant and religious support was now socially required.
