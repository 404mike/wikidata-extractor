A fourth-generation wrestler, he was the son of British wrestler Jim Hussey and the father of boxer Jono \"Rocco\" Hussey.\nRegularly appearing on ITV's World of Sport, he feuded with many of the top light heavyweight wrestlers of the era including Marty Jones, the Dynamite Kid, \"Iron Fist\" Clive Myers, Kendo Nagasaki and Satoru Sayama (billed in the UK as \"Sammy Lee) in England.

During an interview on BBC Radio Cleveland on 31 January 2007, Capes was asked about this and he stated that it never happened.

The Liger character underwent changes in conjunction with the Go Nagai anime progressing and its hero powering up. In January 1990, Liger was renamed \"Jushin Thunder Liger\", a name he continues to use to this day. Early in his career, Yamada's style mostly consisted of high flying. Years later, he started adapting more power moves and started focusing more on grappling and telling a story in the ring; part of this change was due to the fact that Liger had to reduce the stress he was putting on his body after undergoing brain tumor surgery in August 1996, which explained why he lost his match to \u00daltimo Drag\u00f3n in the first round of the J-Crown tournament."]}, {"page": "Fit Finlay", "response": ["Finlay teamed with Mark Rocco and Skull Murphy (Peter Northey) in a 1989 WWF dark match in London, defeating the team of Al Perez, Dusty Wolfe, and Tim Horner."]}, {"page": "Silver King (wrestler)", "response": ["After leaving WCW, he returned to CMLL and began wrestling for CMLL's Japanese affiliate, New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW).
