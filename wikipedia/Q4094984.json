Helen worked closely with the Charity Organisation Society (COS), using her direct experience with living among \"the poor\".

The first was individual casework, a strategy pioneered by the Charity Organization Society in the mid-19th century, which was founded by Helen Bosanquet and Octavia Hill in London, England. Most historians identify COS as the pioneering organization of the social theory that led to the emergence of social work as a professional occupation. COS had its main focus on individual casework. The second was social administration, which included various forms of poverty relief \u2013 'relief of paupers'. Statewide poverty relief could be said to have its roots in the English Poor Laws of the 17th century but was first systematized through the efforts of the Charity Organization Society. The third consisted of social action \u2013 rather than engaging in the resolution of immediate individual requirements, the emphasis was placed on political action working through the community and the group to improve their social conditions and thereby alleviate poverty. This approach was developed originally by the Settlement House Movement."]}, {"page": "Bernard Bosanquet (philosopher)", "response": ["Bernard Bosanquet  (; 14 JuneBernard Bosanquet by Helen Bosanquet, London, 1924, p. 7.
