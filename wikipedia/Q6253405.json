The ground included a separate tent for women and their male companions. Guinness World Records recognises the Racecourse Ground as the world's oldest football ground which continues to host international matches. The next ground to stage an international which is still in use is Hampden Park in Glasgow, which did not host its first match for another 27 years. The Racecourse remained the only ground to host a Wales home international match until 1890, including the first meetings between Wales and England (1880) and Ireland (1882). Wales's meeting with Ireland led to the side's first victory on home ground, with John Price scoring four times in a 7\u20131 win. Wales had considerable success against the Irish side during the 1880s, winning by five or more goals on five occasions. The final victory, an 11\u20130 win at the Racecourse, remains Wales's record victory margin in international competition.
