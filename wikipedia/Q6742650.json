He served as the Governor of Cyprus, and later as the Governor of the Seychelles.\nStevenson was born in Lisburn, Ireland, and educated at Methodist College Belfast and Trinity College Dublin, from which he graduated in 1901.  He entered the Ceylon Civil Service in that year, rising to Second Assistant Colonial Secretary in May 1911. From December 1912 to October 1913 he was seconded to the Colonial Office in London, but then returned to Ceylon as private secretary to Governor Sir Robert Chalmers. In 1914 he married Chalmers's daughter, Mabel, and in 1915 he was promoted to Principal Assistant Colonial Secretary.\nIn May 1917, Stevenson was appointed Chief Secretary of Cyprus, in which post he administered the government from November 1918 to August 1920, when he was appointed High Commissioner. In May 1925, when Cyprus was given the status of a Crown Colony, he became the first Governor, holding the post until November 1926. In May 1927, he was appointed Governor of the Seychelles, but died suddenly just six months later.\nStevenson was appointed Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in the 1920 New Year Honours and Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in the 1923 Birthday Honours.\nHe died on 27 November 1927 in the Seychelles.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lisburn", "response": ["* Malcolm Stevenson (1878\u20131927) \u2013 colonial governor."]}, {"page": "List of Trinity College Dublin people", "response": ["*Sir Malcolm Stevenson, Governor of Cyprus and of the Seychelles"]}, {"page": "List of colonial governors and administrators of Seychelles", "response": ["|May 1927 to November 1927|| ||Sir Malcolm Stevenson, Governor||"]}, {"page": "Ceylon Civil Service", "response": ["*Sir Malcolm Stevenson"]}, {"page": "Timeline of Cypriot history", "response": ["| 1920 || || Sir Malcolm Stevenson became Crown commissioner.", "| 1925 || || Cyprus became a British Crown Colony.

Adana Prelate, Bishop Moushegh Seropian, had encouraged the Melkonian brothers [commonly referred to as parerarner (\u0562\u0561\u0580\u0565\u0580\u0561\u0580\u0576\u0565\u0580=benefactors)] to undertake such a project, in order to give shelter and education to about 500 Armenian orphans of the Armenian genocide who had fled to Syria, Lebanon and Mesopotamia. According to tradition, the location, at the time 3\u00a0km outside Nicosia, is said to have been chosen in 1923 by Garabed Melkonian himself, because no minarets could be seen from there. Its foundation stone was laid on 15 February 1924 by High Commissioner Sir Malcolm Stevenson and it was inaugurated on 13 February 1926 by Archbishop Zaven der Yeghiayian. The grove in front of the school was planted by the first orphans, in memory of their relatives who perished during the Armenian genocide. The Melkonian evolved from an orphanage (1926\u20131940) to a renowned secondary school (1934\u20132005). A unique and unparalleled achievement, it was a beacon of hope and culture for Armenianism and Armenophony across the world, boasting an international membership of Armenian students from over 30 countries. From 1930 until its unjust closure in 2005, 1.828 students graduated from here. Rightly, it was called an ambassador of Cyprus to all over the world. It had a boarding section, a rich library and well-equipped laboratories."]}, {"page": "1923 Birthday Honours", "response": ["* Malcolm Stevenson, , High Commissioner and Commander-in-Chief of the Island of Cyprus."]}, {"page": "1920 New Year Honours", "response": ["* Malcolm Stevenson, the Officer Administering the Government of the Island of Cyprus."]}, {"page": "Louis Devaux", "response": ["When a new Governor, Sir Malcolm Stevenson, died shortly after arrival in 1927, Devaux, as Chief Justice, took over as acting Governor.
