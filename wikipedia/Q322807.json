He later commanded the 51st (Highland) Division at the Battles of the Ancre, Arras, Third Ypres and Cambrai. It was widely claimed by tank officers that his adoption of idiosyncratic tactics at Cambrai caused his division's failure to reach its objectives, although this view has now been called into question. He commanded IV Corps in 1918.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Allan G.

Three tanks working together would advance in a triangle formation, with the two rear tanks providing cover for an infantry platoon.
