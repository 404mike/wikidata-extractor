Ian took lessons under Charlie Farrell, but joined the Royal Air Force and took up photography as his primary interest. After Keith joined Humphrey Lyttelton's band, Ian soon followed; he completed his photography studies with Lyttelton's financial help. Ian also worked extensively with Mick Mulligan and George Melly in the 1950s and 1960s.\nAside from music, Christie worked as a film critic for The Daily Express for over 25 years and continuing to work as a photographer. He worked in trad jazz ensembles into the 2000s, with the Wyre Levee Stompers, the Merseysippi & Parade Jazz Band, and the Tony Davis Band, among others. In his later years, he played with Graham Tayar in his \"Crouch End All Stars\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ken Colyer", "response": ["In the UK, Colyer played with various bands and joined, in 1949, the Crane River Jazz Band (CRJB), with Ben Marshall, Sonny Morris, Pat Hawes, John R. T. Davies, Julian Davies, Ron Bowden and Monty Sunshine. The band played at the Royal Festival Hall on 14 July 1951 in the presence of Princess Elizabeth. Parts of that group merged with other musicians including Keith Christie and Ian Christie to form the Christie Brothers' Stompers. Colyer rejoined the Merchant Navy, jumped ship in Mobile, Alabama, and travelled to New Orleans, where he played with his idols in George Lewis' band. He was offered the job of lead trumpeter on a tour, but was caught by the authorities, detained and deported."]}, {"page": "Mick Mulligan", "response": ["Mulligan's orchestra included Roy Crimmins, Ian Christie, and Archie Semple; it rivaled Humphrey Lyttelton's in popularity on the British trad jazz circuit. While he booked excellent sidemen, Mulligan was not a top-flight musician and his own playing was often hampered by intoxication; furthermore, their recording legacy is spotty because their releases were irregular and generally for small labels. Mulligan broke up his band in 1953 but reformed it a year and a half later, continuing with the new group in 1962; Melly also sang along with this ensemble. In January 1963, the British music magazine NME reported that the biggest trad jazz event to be staged in Britain had taken place at Alexandra Palace.  The event included Melly, Diz Disley, Acker Bilk, Chris Barber, Kenny Ball, Ken Colyer, Monty Sunshine, Bob Wallis, Bruce Turner, Alex Welsh and Mulligan."]}, {"page": "Keith Christie", "response": ["Keith Ronald Christie (6 January 1931 \u2013 16 December 1980) was an English jazz trombonist.
