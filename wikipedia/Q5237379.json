He describes spornosexuals as frequently working class men who exercise at a gym in order to share eroticised selfies of their toned bodies on social media. Simpson considers spornosexuality as the second, more extreme, generation of metrosexuality, since the \"uptake by men of products, practises and pleasures previously ring-fenced for women and gay men\" has become normalised. Instead, Simpson claims, spornosexual men want to be recognised for their bodies rather than their clothes. Examples of such men include Dan Osborne, Thom Evans, David McIntosh and Cristiano Ronaldo."]}, {"page": "Celebrity Ex on the Beach (British series 1)", "response": ["All original cast members arrived at the beach during the first episode, which already featured a pair of exes in Calum and Marissa.
