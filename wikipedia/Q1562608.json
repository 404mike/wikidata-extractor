He dismissed the idea that the two were mutually exclusive: \"The best teachers are usually those who are free, competent and willing to make original researches in the library and the laboratory,\" he stated. To implement his plan, Gilman recruited internationally known researchers including the mathematician James Joseph Sylvester; the biologist H. Newell Martin; the physicist Henry A. Rowland (the first president of the American Physical Society), the classical scholars Basil Gildersleeve and Charles D. Morris; the economist Richard T.

There he was influenced by biology professor Ramsay Wright; at 22 he earned a B.A. and was awarded the medal in natural science.  Over the next several years, he taught high school in Cornwall, Ontario and continued scientific work under Wright's direction.  In 1883, he became a lecturer in biology at the University of Toronto and started work on a medical degree, studying both with Wright and with H. Newell Martin of Johns Hopkins University.  In 1888 he earned a Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins, and two years later completed a medical degree from the University of Toronto; he then became the first chair of physiology at Toronto."]}, {"page": "Henry Newell Martin", "response": ["#REDIRECT H.
