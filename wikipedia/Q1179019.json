On 10 October that year, Taylor signed for Blackpool for \u00a325,000.\nBorn in Sunderland, County Durham, in 1925, Taylor was a naval submariner when he joined Newcastle in 1942. At only 5 ft 4 in, he was one of the shortest players in the game, but his defence-splitting passes caused problems amongst the opposition. It was his back-heel that set up one of Jackie Milburn's goals in the 1951 Final.\nTaylor signed for Blackpool on 10 October 1951 and made his debut three days later in a 2\u20131 home loss to Charlton. When Matthews had recovered from an injury, the pair created a well-respected right-wing partnership. On 25 November 1953, Walter Winterbottom employed the same partnership in England's match against Hungary. England lost 6\u20133 in what was Taylor's only appearance for his country.\nEarlier in 1953, he had been a member of Blackpool's famous FA Cup-winning side that beat Bolton Wanderers. In the same competition in 1958, he helped the devastated Manchester United to an albeit unsuccessful appearance in the FA Cup Final soon after the Munich air disaster.\nOn 12 December 1958 Taylor signed for Sunderland for \u00a36,000, and later played for Altrincham and Derry before emigrating to New Zealand, where he coached New Brighton and also played for Auckland club East Coast Bays.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Clyde F.C.", "response": ["The club ventured on a 20-match tour of South Africa in 1947 and recorded 16 wins, 2 draws and 2 defeats.
