Studio recording then took place during February and March 1970. The alien underneath the spacesuit was achieved by layering the actor's face with blue make-up, tissue and latex rubber. Because it was uncomfortable for the actors, the make-up was applied shortly before they had to go on set. As the story was supposed to take place in the late 1970s, the spacesuit was designed as a futuristic version. Roy Scammell performed as a stunt double for Caroline John when she is pursued in Bessie and captured on the weir. Her husband, Geoffrey Beevers, briefly appears as a UNIT radio operator, credited as \"Private Johnson\"."]}, {"page": "The Best of Benny Hill", "response": ["*Roy Scammell"]}, {"page": "The Dorcons", "response": ["* Roy Scammell \u2014 Maya/Creature"]}, {"page": "Breakaway (Space: 1999)", "response": ["* Roy Scammell \u2014 Jim Nordstrom"]}, {"page": "Circus of Fear", "response": ["* Roy Scammell as Speedboat man"]}, {"page": "London Film and Comic Con", "response": ["| 17\u201319 July 2015|| Olympia|| Sigourney Weaver, Michael J.
