Despite the name, this was a whole new missile, and not a development of the Mark I. The Minister of Aviation, Duncan Sandys, insisted that priority be accorded to getting the Mark I into service, and the Mark II was cancelled at the end of 1959. Considerable modification was required to enable the Victors to carry Blue Steel. These included structural changes to the bomb bay. New  Conway RCo.17 engines were installed, along with a combuster ignition system to allow all four engines to be started simultaneously and reduce scramble time to  minutes per aircraft.

To make the Germans aim short, the British used these double agents to exaggerate the number of V-1s falling in the north and west of London and to under-report those falling in the south and east. Around 22 June, only one of seven impacts was reported south of the Thames, when  of the V-1s had fallen there.

Another of Macmillan's ministers, Charles Hill, stated that Macmillan dominated Cabinet meetings \"by sheer superiority of mind and of judgement\".Goodlad & Pearce, 2013 p.170 Macmillan frequently made allusions to  history, literature and the classics at cabinet meetings, giving him a reputation as being both learned and entertaining, though many ministers found his manner too authoritarian. Macmillan had no \"inner cabinet\", and instead maintained one-on-one relationships with a few senior ministers such as Rab Butler who usually served as acting prime minister when Macmillan was on one of his frequent visits abroad. Selwyn Lloyd described Macmillan as treating most of his ministers like \"junior officers in a unit he commanded\". Lloyd recalled that Macmillan: \"regarded the Cabinet as an instrument to play upon, a body to be molded to his will...very rarely did he fail to get his way\" Macmillan generally allowed his ministers much leeway in managing their portfolios, and only intervened if he felt something had gone wrong. Macmillan was especially close to his three private secretaries, Tom Bligh, Freddie Bishop and Philip de Zulueta, who were his favourite advisers.

Although missiles of the era had relatively low accuracy compared to a manned bomber, any loss of effectiveness could be addressed by the ever-increasing yield of the bombs. This suggested that there was no mission against the UK that could not be carried out by missiles, and Sandys felt it was unlikely that the Soviets would use bombers as their primary method of attack beyond the mid-to-late 1960s. Even when bombers were used, there seemed no scenario where missiles wouldn't as well, meaning the outcome of an attack would be the same whether or not the RAF shot down the Soviet aircraft."]}, {"page": "Rivers of Blood speech", "response": ["The leading Conservatives in the Shadow Cabinet were outraged by the speech.

He suspected Margaret of infidelity and, while she was in New York, he engaged a locksmith to break open a cupboard at their Mayfair home, 48 Upper Grosvenor Street. The evidence discovered resulted in the 1963 divorce case, in which the Duke of Argyll accused his wife of infidelity and included a set of Polaroid photographs of the Duchess naked, save for her signature three-strand pearl necklace, in the company of another man.

It is claimed that this analysis proved that the man in question was Fairbanks, then long married to his second wife, but this was not made public. Granting the divorce, Lord Wheatley, the presiding judge, said the evidence established that the Duchess of Argyll \"was a completely promiscuous woman whose sexual appetite could only be satisfied with a number of men\".
