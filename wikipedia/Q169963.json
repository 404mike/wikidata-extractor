Typecast as an antihero, he is known for action-thriller films and portraying tough, irredeemable, and machiavellian characters.\nStatham began practising Chinese martial arts, kickboxing, and karate recreationally in his youth while working at local market stalls. An avid footballer and diver, he was a member of Britain's national diving team and competed for England in the 1990 Commonwealth Games. Shortly after, he was asked to model for French Connection, Tommy Hilfiger, and Levi's in various advertising campaigns. His past history working at market stalls inspired his casting in the Guy Ritchie crime films Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998) and Snatch (2000).\nThe commercial success of these films led Statham to star as Frank Martin in the Transporter trilogy (2002\u20132008). After starring in a variety of heist and action-thriller films such as The Italian Job (2003), Crank (2006), War (2007), The Bank Job (2008), The Mechanic (2011), Spy (2015), and Mechanic: Resurrection (2016), he established himself as a Hollywood leading man. However, he has also starred in commercially and critically unsuccessful films such as Revolver (2005), Chaos (2005), In the Name of the King (2007), 13 (2010), Blitz (2011), Killer Elite (2011), Hummingbird (2013), and Wild Card (2015). He regained commercial success as a part of the ensemble action series The Expendables (2010\u20132014) and the Fast & Furious franchise. In the latter, he has played Deckard Shaw in Fast & Furious 6 (2013), Furious 7 (2015), The Fate of the Furious (2017), and the spin-off Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw (2019). He was credited as a co-producer on Hobbs & Shaw, receiving his first production credit.\nStatham's acting has been criticised for lacking depth and variety, but he has also been praised for leading the resurgence of action films during the 2000s and 2010s. According to a BBC News report, his film career from 2002 to 2017 generated an estimated $1.5 billion (\u00a31.1 billion) in ticket sales, making him one of the film industry's most bankable stars.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Charlize Theron", "response": ["Theron starred as a safe and vault \"technician\" in the 2003 heist film The Italian Job, an American homage/remake of the 1969 British film of the same name, directed by F.

Knight later said, \"Cillian, when you meet him, isn't Tommy, obviously, but I was stupid enough not to understand that.\" He picked Murphy after receiving a text message from Murphy that read, \"Remember, I'm an actor.\" Murphy told The Independent, \"[The scripts] were so compelling and confident, and the character was so rich and complex, layered and contradictory. I was like, 'I have to do this.'\" Peaky Blinders was praised and received high ratings. A second series began broadcasting on the BBC in October 2014. On August 25, the first episode of season 5 was broadcast on BBC One. In an interview with Digital Spy, director Anthony Byrne said, \"if we did start shooting in January (2021), we wouldn't finish until May or June and then it's another 6 months of editing.\" This would place the release date for the final season of Peaky Blinders at either the end of 2021 or the beginning of 2022.
