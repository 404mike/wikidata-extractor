He joined the Workers Educational Association, and then worked for the National Union of Tailors and Garment Workers as a negotiator and as a journal editor.  From 1965 he served as a Trades Union Congress (TUC) education officer.  In 1968, he moved to work for the National and Local Government Officers' Association (NALGO), spending time in each of the health, gas, and local government sections.  He was chosen as an assistant general secretary of the union in 1976 and progressed to deputy general secretary in 1982.When Geoffrey Drain, general secretary of NALGO, announced his intention to retire in 1983, Daly was the strong favourite to succeed him.  He only narrowly defeated John Ward of the First Division Association, the two both placing well ahead of Alan Jinkinson, Campbell Christie and Ernest Baxendale.  In the same year, he was elected to the General Council of the TUC.   He served on many TUC committees including its Labour Party Liaison Committee, and chaired the Public Services Committee.Daly retired in 1989, and was succeeded by Jinkinson.  He died in 1999, aged 68.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Daly", "response": ["John Daly may refer to:", "* John Daly (producer) (1937\u20132008), British movie producer and director of The Big Bang", "* John Daly (Irish TV presenter), Northern Irish chat show host", "* John Daly (Irish Member of Parliament) (1834\u20131888), Irish Nationalist Member of Parliament for Cork City", "* John Daly (Fenian) (1845\u20131916), Irish revolutionary and member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood", "* John Daly (Irish politician) (1867\u20131932), represented Cork in the 1920s", "* John Daly (Australian politician) (1891\u20131942), Australian lawyer and politician", "* John Daly (footballer, born 1870) (1870\u20131913), South Australian Hall of Fame footballer", "* John Daly (runner) (1880\u20131969), Irish athlete who won an Olympic silver medal", "* John Daly (footballer, born 1890) (1890\u20131968), Australian footballer for Melbourne", "* John Daly (rugby) (1917\u20131988), Irish rugby union and rugby league footballer of the 1940s and 1950s", "* John Daly (swimmer) (born 1956), Puerto Rican former swimmer", "* John Daly (golfer) (born 1966), professional golfer", "* John Daly (skeleton racer) (born 1985), American skeleton racer", "* John Daly (soccer coach), English American college soccer coach", "* John Daly (gambler) (1838\u20131906), New York City criminal", "* John Daly (outlaw) (1839\u20131864), American Western outlaw", "* John Daly (bishop) (1901\u20131985), colonial Anglican bishop", "* John Daly (academic) (1936\u20132018), Australian academic, sports historian, and athletics coach", "* John Daly (trade unionist) (1930\u20131999), British trade union leader", "* John Daly (American media personality, born 1955), 1990s American journalist", "* John Daly, gang member in the 1963 robbery of a Royal Mail train", "* John Daly (cocktail), an alcoholic mixed drink, named after American golfer John Daly"]}, {"page": "National and Local Government Officers' Association", "response": ["*1983: John Daly", "*1982: John Daly"]}, {"page": "John Ward (economist)", "response": ["In 1983, Ward stood to become General Secretary of the National and Local Government Officers' Association, but was narrowly defeated by John Daly.Patrick Wintour, \"Deputy succeeds to top job\", The Guardian, 16 April 1983"]}, {"page": "General Council of the Trades Union Congress", "response": ["|rowspan=3| John Daly"]}]}}
