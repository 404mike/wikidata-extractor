As they performed, a hard drive issue caused the recording of the song \"Girl You Know It's True\" to jam and skip, repeatedly playing the partial line \"Girl, you know it's...\" through the speakers. \"I knew right then and there, it was the beginning of the end for Milli Vanilli,\" recalled Pilatus of the incident. \"When my voice got stuck in the computer, and it just kept repeating and repeating, I panicked. I didn't know what to do. I just ran off the stage.\" Downtown Julie Brown ran after Pilatus and convinced him to finish the set. \"With a bit of pushing and screaming, and a couple of F-words I think as well, I got them back out there,\" Brown explained on VH1's Behind the Music.
