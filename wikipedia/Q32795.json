His breakthrough was in 2001, winning the City Life Best Newcomer of the Year and the BBC New Comedy Awards. In the ensuing years, Carr's career burgeoned on the Manchester comedy circuit before he became known for co-hosting The Friday Night Project (2006\u20132009) with Justin Lee Collins. This led to the release of a short-lived entertainment show Alan Carr's Celebrity Ding Dong (2008), and he went on to star in the comedy chat show Alan Carr: Chatty Man (2009\u20132016) which aired on Channel 4. Since 2017, Carr often stands in as a team captain on 8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown. In 2019, he became a judge on RuPaul's Drag Race UK.\nCarr hosted the radio show Going Out with Alan Carr on BBC Radio 2 (2009\u20132012), as well as releasing his autobiography book Look Who It Is!

An interview for Alan Carr: Chatty Man recorded during this time remains unaired, due to graphic language and content. A music video for \"Running to the Edge of the World\" \u2013 in which Manson beats a Wood lookalike to death \u2013 was released on November 4 and was condemned as a perceived glorification of violence against women. The band parted ways with Interscope on December 3. They settled the lawsuit filed by former keyboardist Stephen Bier (aka M.W. Gacy), with Manson's insurance company paying Bier's attorney's fees and Bier receiving no monetary value."]}, {"page": "Peter Sellers", "response": ["Sellers and the Goons were also an influence on Peter Cook, who described Sellers as \"the best comic actor in the world\". British actor Stephen Mangan stated that Sellers was a large influence, as did the comedians Mike Myers, Alan Carr and Rob Brydon. Sellers's characters Hrundi Bakshi (The Party) and Inspector Clouseau (The Pink Panther) later influenced comedian Rowan Atkinson's characters Mr. Bean and Johnny English. The comic performer Sacha Baron Cohen referred to Sellers as \"the most seminal force in shaping [his] early ideas on comedy\". Cohen was considered for the role of Sellers in the biographical film The Life and Death of Peter Sellers. Will Ferrell considers Sellers to be an important influence on him, citing his \"unique combination of being extremely subtle and over-the-top all at the same time.\" The three members of Spinal Tap\u2014Michael McKean, Christopher Guest and Harry Shearer\u2014have also cited Sellers as being an influence on them, as has the US talk-show host Conan O'Brien. David Schwimmer is another whose approach was influenced by Sellers: \"he could do anything, from Dr Strangelove to Inspector Clouseau.
