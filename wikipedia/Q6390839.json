He is best remembered for his commentary during the 1966 FIFA World Cup Final; in the closing minutes, Wolstenholme commented on a series of pitch invaders as Geoff Hurst dribbled down the pitch before scoring, saying \"some people are on the pitch, they think it's all over!\" The phrase has become deeply embedded in British popular culture.", "link_mentions": {}}}
