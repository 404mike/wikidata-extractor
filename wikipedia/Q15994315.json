Originally working in agriculture, he was forced by ill health to change careers and set up a shop to sell medicinal herbal remedies at Goose Gate, Nottingham. Although he had no formal qualification, he had learned the skills from his mother and from the Methodist book, Primitive Physic by John Wesley. When Boot died in 1860, his wife Mary took over the business, and his son Jesse Boot would go on to expand the business by opening more stores in poor areas, eventually expanding it into the company Boots UK.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
