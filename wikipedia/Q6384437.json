Some shows were recorded and a deal was made with Bronze Records, resulting in the Live Seventy Nine album, quickly followed by the studio album Levitation. However, during the recording of Levitation King quit and Ginger Baker was drafted in for the sessions, but he chose to stay with the band for the tour, during which Blake left to be replaced by Keith Hale."]}, {"page": "Toyah Willcox", "response": ["In London, Willcox lived in a place called \"Mayhem\", a converted British Rail warehouse serving as a studio. It was here the band Toyah recorded their first demos. For the lack of proper bed she slept for a while in a \"second-hand\" coffin, reportedly used by the French Red Cross to transport victims of fatal accidents. Citing her role in Quadrophenia as a boost to her musical career, with growing audiences Toyah signed to Safari Records, releasing a debut single \"Victims of the Riddle\", which topped the UK Indie Charts. This was followed by the Sheep Farming in Barnet EP, produced by Steve James and Keith Hale. Initially released in Germany, in 1979 it was re-released as an LP, comprising the original six tracks, \"Victims of the Riddle\" A and B sides and three tracks that were previously unavailable on vinyl. Willcox's second album, The Blue Meaning, went up to no. 40 in the UK Albums Chart in June 1980.

Blake's technician, Paul \"Twink\" Noble (who had previously played with Here and Now and would later join Gong), took Blake's place using Blake's equipment, until a road accident forced him to leave the tour after another five dates.
