Sarratt was renowned as a player and author and adopted the title \"Professor of Chess\".  He was the first professional player to teach chess in England.  He introduced into England the chess rule that a stalemate is a draw, which was commonly used on the continent of Europe. He coined with his works of 1813 and 1821 the term Muzio Gambit. He was a pupil of Verdoni and later the teacher of William Lewis and Peter Unger Williams.\nIn 1803 her met Camilla Dufour who was a singer who was writing for the same publisher as he was. where she met her future husband. He and Dufour married at St. Leonard's, church in Shoreditch at the end of 1804. She was his second wife so she inherited his two children. Her new husband became the leading person in chess in London. He would go walking with Hippolyte de Bourblanc and they would play chess against each other by remembering all the positions and never using actual chess pieces or a board.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of chess players", "response": ["* Jacob Sarratt (England, 1772\u20131819)"]}, {"page": "Rules of chess", "response": ["The rules for pawn promotion have changed several times. As stated above, originally the pawn could only be promoted to the queen, which at that time was a weak piece. When the queen acquired its current move and became the most powerful piece, the pawn could then be promoted to a queen or a rook, bishop, or knight. In the 18th century rules allowed only the promotion to a piece already captured, e.g. the rules published in 1749 by Fran\u00e7ois-Andr\u00e9 Danican Philidor. In the 19th century this restriction was lifted, which allowed for a player to have more than one queen, e.g. the 1828 rules by Jacob Sarratt .", "As chess clubs arose and tournaments became common, there was a need to formalize the rules. In 1749 Philidor (1726\u20131795) wrote a set of rules that were widely used, as well as rules by later writers such as the 1828 rules by Jacob Sarratt (1772\u20131819) and rules by George Walker (1803\u20131879). In the 19th century, many major clubs published their own rules, including The Hague in 1803, London in 1807, Paris in 1836, and St. Petersburg in 1854. In 1851 Howard Staunton (1810\u20131874) called for a \"Constituent Assembly for Remodeling the Laws of Chess\" and proposals by Tassilo von Heydebrand und der Lasa (1818\u20131889) were published in 1854. Staunton had published rules in Chess Player's Handbook in 1847, and his new proposals were published in 1860 in Chess Praxis; they were generally accepted in English-speaking countries. German-speaking countries usually used the writings of chess authority Johann Berger (1845\u20131933) or Handbuch des Schachspiels by Paul Rudolf von Bilguer (1815\u20131840), first published in 1843."]}, {"page": "Stalemate", "response": ["*A draw.

That is widely accepted today, but Jacob Sarratt, Howard Staunton, and Jos\u00e9 Capablanca felt that the exchange was worth two pawns.  Tigran Petrosian thought that one pawn was the right value.  Wilhelm Steinitz said that a rook is slightly better than a knight and two pawns but slightly worse than a bishop and two pawns .  Cecil Purdy said that the value depends on the total number of pawns on the board.  The reason is that when there are many pawns, the rooks will have limited mobility because there will not be open .  The exchange is barely worth 1\u00bd points when there are 14 or more pawns on the board.  Only when there are ten or fewer pawns may the exchange be worth 2 points  .  Purdy gave the value as 1\u00bd points in the opening and increasing to 2 points in the endgame.  In the middlegame the value would be closer to 1\u00bd than to 2 .
