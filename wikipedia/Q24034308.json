Campbell's tweet read \"Oliver Mundell is the sort of public speaker that makes you wish his dad had embraced his homosexuality sooner\". Campbell sued her for defamation, seeking damages of \u00a325,000. Campbell lost the case in April 2019, with the Sheriff concluding that, while Campbell's comment was not homophobic and he was not a homophobe, Dugdale's remarks constituted fair comment and \"were not motivated by malice, but by a genuine perception that the tweet represented an insult to homosexual people, and was homophobic\". In his judgement, the Sheriff said he did not believe Campbell had suffered any hardship and had he been minded to award any damages the sum would have been \u00a3100https://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/docs/default-source/cos-general-docs/pdf-docs-for-opinions/2019scedin32.pdf rather than the \u00a325,000 sought by Campbell. He unsuccessfully appealed in May 2020, although the three appeal court judges again found that Dugdale's comments had been \"a straightforward direct defamatory statement\"https://wingsoverscotland.com/of-no-materiality/ and that \"It is not now disputed that the article was, in its reference to the pursuer as homophobic, defamatory\". The appeal court also increased the notional value of damages by 50 times, from \u00a3100 to \u00a35000, but nevertheless upheld Dugdale's \"fair comment\" defence. Reflecting on Campbell's comment and the court case in July 2021, David Mundell told the House of Commons: \"I am pleased to say that he [Campbell] lost. I regard that as a victory, at least in Scotland, for those willing to stand up against homophobia, and I remain particularly grateful to Kez for her support.\""]}, {"page": "Endorsements in the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum", "response": ["* Scottish Conservative MSPs include Margaret Mitchell, Graham Simpson, Alexander Stewart, Ross Thomson, Gordon Lindhurst and Oliver Mundell."]}]}}
