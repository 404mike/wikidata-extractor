Post-punk bands Joy Division and New Order were heavily influenced by the band. Joy Division frontman Ian Curtis was a fan, and showed his colleagues records that would influence their music.The album Trans-Europe Express was played over the PA before Joy Division's concerts. New Order's song \"Your Silent Face\" also has some similarities with \"Europe Endless\" and had a working title of \"KW1\", or \"Kraftwerk 1\". New Order also recorded a song called \"Krafty\" that appeared as a single and on the album Waiting for the Sirens' Call. New Order also sampled \"Uranium\" in its biggest hit \"Blue Monday\".

That's why I had Shagrat - it was a rat trip. Rats turn over at an amazing pace and they have a lot of kids. Not only do they eat the poison but they thrive on it and get bigger and they can still slip under doorways. It's the ecology trip. Do you know how many rats were killed in New York last year?

Interviewed by Charles Shaar Murray in 1972 for the NME, Took commented that record companies \"didn't want to buy Steel Abortion or Peppermint Flickstick.  A bit naughty, the words, but then I'd taken in all this American culture and American society in general, and got chemicalised out of it, a general trip, and put it all into words. Now there's Alice Cooper's School's Out and Killer, Hawkwind and the general thing is there now, and it wasn't there then because they couldn't accept that it was gonna sell. I was saying to 'em. \"Look, man, look at the Yanks, because we're about three years behind them as far as youth culture is concerned. This is what's gonna sell.\" and they'd say, 'Oh yes, lads sure, do they really want to hear this sort of thing?\""]}, {"page": "Steve Peregrin Took", "response": ["He also performed at various benefit events, including the \"Nasty Balls\" benefits for the Nasty Tales magazine (whose editors, including Farren, were on trial for obscenity) as well as the 1972 Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament festival at Aldermaston, Steve's account of which was reprinted by Charles Shaar Murray in his book Shots From The Hip. Writing for the NME in 1972, Murray described Took and his stage act thus: \"Most people know who Steve Peregrine Took is, but few people know what he does. A few more know him as a somewhat bizarre figure who materialises at concerts, armed only with an Epiphone guitar, and performs a freeform set of songs, raps, jokes and anything else that flashes through his mind.\""]}]}}
