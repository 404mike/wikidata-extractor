He played 12 times in the League, scoring once, and after a spell with Northern Premier League club Workington, he moved on to football in Finland. He was a member of the Kuusysi team that won the 1984 Mestaruussarja (Finnish league) and reached the quarter-final of the 1985\u201386 European Cup, though he had left the club before that round was played. He spent the 1986 season with Finnairin Palloilijat playing in the second tier, returning to England for a few months with Conference club Gateshead. Mitchell then went back to Finland for another two seasons, initially returning to Kuusysi, with whom he won the 1987 Finnish Cup. He would see out the remainder of his career with third-tier side Lapuan Virki\u00e4. In 1988, Mitchell and former Kuusysi teammate Kevin Todd played for Humbledon Plains Farm in the FA Sunday Cup final."]}]}}
