The detachments of 21 men each were on duty for 24 hours from 1300 hours on one day to 1300 hours the next. The troops were billeted at Prideaux Place, Padstow which had sleeping accommodation for 120 men & 4 officers, a cookhouse & dining hall and an officer's mess & kitchen. Prideaux Place served as the Battery Headquarters. Water at the site was a problem and to begin with, the battery had to transport water for drinking and washing from Prideaux Place in dustbins. Later, the old Victorian water tank was cleaned and that was then used. In August 1940, an ADS Advance Dressing Station was set up at Tregirls Farm. Sick Parade was held daily at 1000 hours at the Fisherman's Institute in the town. On the night of 7 September 1940, the battery was at the utmost readiness following the issue of Codeword Cromwell, meaning invasion imminent. The Resident Naval Officer in overall charge of the defence of Padstow, Rear Admiral Gordon Campbell, V.C., and the officer in charge of the land forces, Lt Dare Wilson of the 8th Battalion Royal Northumberland Fusiliers, kept watch from the control bunker of the underwater minefield laid across the estuary. No invasion arrived. On Saturday 5 October 1940, Padstow was bombed at 8pm but the battery was not hit. Three people \u2013 three generations from one family - were killed in New Street, Padstow. Six houses were extensively damaged and 61 other buildings suffered minor damage. The fin of one of the bombs is on display at Padstow Museum. On 8 October 1940, Major Kirby, I.G., from Plymouth, arrived with a towing launch. Two rafts 20 yards apart were attached to the launch. The targets were engaged as they came into view from Pentire Head to Newland Rock. The average range was 4400 yards and five hits were registered out of 13 shots. On 15 February 1941, both guns fired 10 rounds practice shells together in 3 series at a single Hans Kay target pulled behind a launch travelling at a speed of about 10 knots. Six hits were registered. By May 1941, two War Shelters had been built to accommodate the Watch on Duty whilst the Reserve Watch slept in two huts erected at the bottom of the field by St George's Cove. In May 1942, the two naval guns were returned to sea to help in the Battle of the Atlantic. They left Padstow from the town railway station. They were replaced by two French 138mm naval guns. These required new gun houses. No 1 was built south of the old barbette and magazine. Its platform can easily be found today with mounting bolts still in place. No 2 was built just north of the old northern gun house and its location can easily be found by the ready use lockers that are still extant. The Battery Observation Post was also extended at this time. On 11 May 1942, both 138mm guns had been proofed and were ready for action. On 17 March 1943, the examination service was discontinued as such and the majority of Officers, NCO's and men were released for service overseas and the guns put into care and preservation. In November 1943, the strength was reduced to one NCO and two men and the ammunition removed to Fort Picklecombe for storage. The guns were removed in July 1945.", "Gun Point is referenced in Major Dare Wilson's autobiography \u2018Tempting The Fates\u2019, which details his work on preparing the landward defences for Padstow."]}, {"page": "General Wilson", "response": ["*Dare Wilson (1919\u20132014), British Army major general"]}]}}
