John Atherton (1697\u20131768), the elder brother of William Atherton, relocated from Preston to Liverpool as an aspiring young merchant, and became involved in numerous privateering syndicates. Some of his privateering vessels were built in Norfolk, Virginia and were sized around 250 tons. Thurloe, one of his hackboats captured the Admiral of Bordeaux as a prize ship during June 1745, the year prior to purchasing the Walton Hall. Atherton was also highly involved in the Atlantic slave trade and the triangular trade. At least 18 slave voyages between 1737 and 1757 are on record. Atherton donated land in Liverpool allowing the town to expand.  This was unlikely to atone for the origin of his wealth, simply a vehicle to elevate his social status, and marry Frances Richmond, the granddaughter of Sylvester Richmond, Lord Mayor of Liverpool (1672\u201373). Their daughter Catherine (1735\u20131819) grew up in Walton Hall and married Legh Richmond, a clergyman and the founder of one of the first Friendly societies in England. The Athertons also owned plantations in the Colony of Jamaica since before the mid 1760s. His connection with Fazarkeley and the profits from privateering and slavery had quickly elevated his position in society, allowing not only to purchase Walton Hall, but to be elected to public roles in Liverpool. Peter Bold, became president of the Liverpool Royal Infirmary, which opened in 1743, replacing his friend, Nicholas Fazakerley.  Atherton was the treasurer on two occasions (1752 and 1761). He also sent his son John to Cambridge. Both John Snr and Jnr are listed in the electoral roll of 1761 under Union Chapel. In 1766 John Snr kept offices in Hanover St, his former home, whilst his son had offices in Wolstenholme's St. John Atherton Snr died in 1768. His will dated 4 February 1768, devised other property, in addition to Walton Hall, such as Banister Hall in Walton-le-Dale, which he purchased in 1739, to his son in 1768."]}]}}
