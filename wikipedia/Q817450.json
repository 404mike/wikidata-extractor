The Nereis Britannica, which was issued in parts, deals mainly with the brown algal seawracks or fuci, and was based on his own researches, discussions with James Edward Smith, comments on proofs by friendsThomas Jenkinson Woodward, Dawson Turner, Dr. Samuel Goodenough, Lilly Wigg, John Pitchford, and Colonel Thomas Velley and the herbaria of Dillenius, Bobart, and Linn\u00e6us. The complete work, which was printed privately and published in folio at Bath, with Latin and English text and twelve coloured plates by the author, appeared as part I in 1795, part II in 1797 and part III in 1801. An enlarged edition, with twenty-four coloured plates, was published at Bath in 1801, in folio; and another at Oxford in 1816, in quarto, with Latin text only and twenty plates. The Illustrationes Theophrasti in usum Botanicorum pr\u00e6cipue peregrinantium, Oxford, 1811, contains a lexicon and three catalogues giving the Linn\u00e6an names of the plants mentioned. The edition of Theophrasti Eresii de Historia Plantarum libri decem, \"perhaps the most unsatisfactory\" ever published (according to Benjamin Daydon Jackson, Guide to the Literature of Botany (1881), p.\u00a022), in 2 vols. 1813 and 1814, contains the Greek text, Latin notes, a glossary and Greek-Latin and Latin-Greek catalogues of the plants.
