When Tanya became pregnant, Max left his wife and son to marry his mistress. Bradley never fully recovered from his father's abandonment."]}, {"page": "Branning family", "response": ["Between 2006 and 2012, new influx of Branning's joined the show - Max Branning (Jake Wood), his wife Tanya (Jo Joyner) and their children Lauren (Madeline Duggan/Jacqueline Jossa) and Abi (Lorna Fitzgerald). Max and Tanya later had another child Oscar Branning in 2007. Max's son with his ex-wife Rachel (Sukie Smith/Pooky Quesnel); Bradley Branning (Charlie Clements) was introduced earlier in 2006. Jim's son Jack Branning (Scott Maslen) and his daughter Penny Branning (Mia Mckenna-Bruce) were introduced in 2007 and 2008, as well as Bianca's children Liam Butcher (James Forde), Tiffany Dean (Maisie Smith), Morgan Jackson-King (Devon Higgs) and her ward Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty) in 2008. Suzy Branning (now played by Maggie O'Neill) also returned to the show for a five months the same year. In February 2010, Carol returned to the show with her son Billie, who was killed off months later. Once again in 2011, the Branning family were rejuvenated with the return of Derek Branning (now played by Jamie Foreman), alongside the introduction of his children Joey Branning (David Witts) and Alice Branning (Jasmyn Banks) the following year. Carol's daughter Sonia returned in 2014 with her daughter Bex Fowler (Jasmine Armfield), as did Robbie in both 2015 and 2017 and Bianca in 2019.", "The Branning family were introduced as an extension to the established Jackson family consisting of Carol Jackson (Lindsay Coulson), her children Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer), Robbie Jackson (Dean Gaffney), Sonia Fowler (Natalie Cassidy) and Billie Jackson (Devon Anderson), her husband Alan Jackson (Howard Antony) and his grandmother Blossom Jackson (Mona Hammond). Carol's father Jim Branning, played by John Bardon, had appeared in the show in 1996 as a guest character and was reintroduced in 1999 as a regular by Matthew Robinson. Three other of Jim's children, April Branning (Debbie Arnold), Derek Branning (Terence Beesley) and Sue Branning (Julie Christian-Young) also appeared in 1995 and 1996, as well as his first wife Reenie Branning (Joy Graham), who died off screen in 1999, allowing Jim to move in with his grandchildren. Jim was paired romantically with Dot Cotton (June Brown), and the couple married on screen in February 2002. The family was extended in 2005 with the arrival of Jim's grandson Bradley Branning (Charlie Clements), in January 2006. Bradley's arrival prompted a series of complaints from residents in the Hertfordshire town of Tring, where Bradley had allegedly lived before he moved to East London, as they thought their town had been portrayed as \"snobbish\". The BBC responded by saying that Tring was chosen following a storyline conference in the town, where the production team enjoyed their stay, saying that Bradley was not a snob but was portrayed as a character who led a sheltered life because his father left him when he was young. In 2006, scriptwriters decided to pair Bradley with the character Stacey Slater, played by Lacey Turner. Meanwhile, actor Jake Wood was introduced as Bradley's estranged father Max Branning, along with his second wife Tanya Branning (Jo Joyner) and their two daughters Lauren Branning (Madeline Duggan from 2006 to 2010, Jacqueline Jossa since 2010) and Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald). Max, a serial womaniser, had left Bradley with his mother Rachel Branning, played by Sukie Smith in 2006 and Pooky Quesnel from 2007 onwards, after an affair with Tanya, and had not seen his son for several years. Max arrived with a mistress, Gemma Clewes (Natalie J. Robb), who was warned off by Bradley. Scott Maslen was announced as the latest member of the Branning clan, Jim's youngest son Jack Branning, in July 2007. Minor appearances followed from Jack's ex-wife Selina Branning and daughter Penny Branning (Mia McKenna-Bruce). Sue, renamed Suzy, was reintroduced in 2008 played by Maggie O'Neill, though she departed later that year. Bardon suffered a stroke in 2007, and a storyline was written in which Jim tended to a sick Carol, and suffered a stroke while he was there. Dot and Jim remained together, with Jim making sporadic appearances throughout 2008 and 2009 to visit Dot, and Bardon made a more permanent return to the show in late 2009, which lasted until 2011."]}, {"page": "List of EastEnders characters (2006)", "response": ["Rachel Branning is played by Sukie Smith in 2006, and Pooky Quesnel from 2007 to 2010.
