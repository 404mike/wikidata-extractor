He was a founder of Lloyd's Register of Yachts.Kemp was born in Ryde, a British seaside town on the Isle of Wight. For a time, he edited the Isle of Wight Observer. He was also yachting editor of The Field.Kemp was an authority on the design of yachts and yacht racing. Of his famous yachts, Firecrest (1892) was used by Alain Gerbault in his solo circumnavigation of the globe, and was the vessel he sailed to win the Blue Water Medal in 1923. His Amazon is still afloat and made a Trans-Atlantic crossing in 2011. The British Admiralty ordered copies of his Yacht and Boat Sailing supplied to the Navy. As an architect, he was regarded as an expert on stability of vessels, and his work was supplied to officers of the Royal Navy. As recently as a 1950 analysis of Joshua Slocum's vessel Spray, Kemp's formulae and analysis were still being put to use.\nIn yacht racing, he was known for having devised a new ranking system based on the length of vessels and their area under sail. Kemp also wrote concerning the rules of yacht racing.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Yawl", "response": ["Yawl rig appears to have originated in the early 19th century. Working craft of this type include the later versions of the Falmouth Quay Punt - and interest in this local type were taken by Dixon Kemp, an authority on yacht racing, in 1875. Yachts were rigged as yawls as early as 1814. John MacGregor had his 1867-built Rob Roy designed as a yawl. (MacGregor had a number of boats, all of the same name.) British and European racing yachts were rigged as yawls from the second half of the 1870s, with a resurgence in popularity from 1896, when a change to the handicap rating system gave advantages to yawls. They remained prominent in handicap classes through the 1920s - with yachts like Rendezvous (built 1913) measuring  and setting  of sail."]}, {"page": "Amateur sports", "response": ["Corinthian has come to describe one of the most virtuous of amateur athletes\u2014those for whom fairness and honor in competition is valued above victory or gain.  The Corinthian Yacht Club (now the Royal Corinthian Yacht Club, RCYC) was established in Essex in 1872 with \"encouragement of Amateur Yacht sailing\" as its \"primary object.\" To that end, club rules ensured that crews consisted of amateurs, while \"no professional or paid hand is allowed to touch the tiller or in any way assist in steering.\" Although the RCYC website derives the name Corinthian from the Isthmian Games of ancient Corinth, the Oxford English Dictionary derives the noun Corinthian from \"the proverbial wealth, luxury, and licentiousness of ancient Corinth\", with senses developing from \"a wealthy man\" (attested in 1577) through \"a licentious man\" (1697) and \"a man of fashion about town\" (1819) to \"a wealthy amateur of sport who rides his own horses, steers his own yacht, etc\" (1823).

Her balance is marvelous \u2014 almost uncanny. Try as I would \u2014 one element after another \u2014 they all swung into the same identical line. I attacked her with proportional dividers, planimeter, rotameter, Simpson's rule, Froude's coefficients, Dixon Kemp's formulae, series, curves, differentials, and all the appliances of modern yacht designing, and she emerged from the ordeal a theoretically perfect boat. For when she is underway every element of resistance, stability, weight, heeling effort, and propulsive force is in one transverse plane, and that plane is the boat's midship section. I know of no similar case in the whole field of naval architecture, ancient or modern.\""]}, {"page": "International rule (sailing)", "response": ["It was the illustrious architect, Dixon Kemp, who began the tradition of expressing British rules as trivial fractions with a divisor of \"2\", thus starting the tradition of the age old question:"]}, {"page": "Steam yacht", "response": ["Steam yachts often used the ship prefix SY, but some were alternatively described as screw schooner, if they carried schooner rig.
