He made such a claim in a speech at Exeter in April 1983, and distributed to Tory candidates information about the background of leading members of CND. This had been assembled by Ray Whitney MP, but some of it was suspected of having come from intelligence sources. MI5 agent Cathy Massiter later wrote, in 1985 in The Observer, that from 1981 onwards and especially from 1983 she had been asked to pass on to DS19 (the propaganda unit at the Ministry of Defence) information obtained by wiretaps and by an MI5 mole in CID. MI5 bosses refused to pass on classified material about security matters but agreed to pass on information about the political links of CND members. Even this was in breach of the 1952 Directive from Home Secretary David Maxwell-Fyfe that the security services not provide information for party political purposes. Heseltine allowed his deputy Peter Blaker to debate with CND, but refused to do so himself, believing that he would be at a disadvantage against the attractive Joan Ruddock. Blaker did much of the work while Heseltine got the publicity. DS19 was wound up three months after the 1983 election, at which Heseltine was widely credited with helping the Conservatives achieve a landslide victory.Crick 1997, pp. 247\u201350."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 2001 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Joan Ruddock", "| Joan Ruddock"]}, {"page": "London Borough of Lewisham", "response": ["* Dame Joan Ruddock (2016)"]}, {"page": "Lewisham Deptford (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Dame Joan Ruddock"]}, {"page": "List of current members of the British Privy Council", "response": ["| Dame Joan Ruddock"]}, {"page": "Socialist Campaign Group", "response": ["During his time as Leader Neil Kinnock moved the Labour party to adopt centrist politics.
