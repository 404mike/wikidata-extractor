The backing tracks needed seven takes. One of the song's most distinctive features is Argent's electric piano sound; the instrument used was a Hohner Pianet. The backing vocals are in a folk-influenced close-harmony style.

Following the release of their debut single \"She's Not There\" in July 1964, White wrote a handful of songs in between performances during the band's heavy schedule.  Most of the work on the song occurred in August 1964, when the Zombies recorded both a demo and the backing track for it. The instrumentation largely differs from both earlier and later Zombies records; it features electric organ played by Rod Argent, compared to his previous usage of the electric piano. Together with record producer Ken Jones, they returned in September to finish the vocal track, which was disliked by most band members for its similarity to \"She's Not There\"; the vocals would eventually be re-recorded a few months later.", "\"Leave Me Be\" was initially recorded as a demo at Ryemuse studios in Primrose Hill, London on 13 August 1964, together with Argent's \"Kind of Girl\" and \"Woman\". This version wasn't released for over 30 years, and instead the group entered Decca Studios in West Hampstead, London on 31 August 1964 to professionally lay down the backing track to the song. Producer Ken Jones who had previously collaborated with them was also present during the session. Both \"Kind of Girl\" and \"Woman\" were also recorded during this session, along with another of Argent's compositions \"Sometimes\". The group performed eight takes of the song during that session. They then didn't finish the song for another 6 days, until 5 September 1964, once again returning to Decca for recording the vocal track. This continued the Zombies style of recording, which included recording several takes of the backing track on a prior date sometime prior, before choosing the best to overdub and add the vocal track over. Jones, who liked the \"whispery\" singing on \"She's Not There\", wanted singer Colin Blunstone to have a similar vocal performance on \"Leave Me Be\", much to Blunstone's and the Zombies' disappointment. This led to the group re-recording the vocals during a chapter of their first United States tour."]}, {"page": "She's Coming Home", "response": ["\"She's Coming Home\" is a song written by keyboardist Rod Argent recorded by his band the Zombies. The song has early origins in Argent's life; he lifted segments from the 1946 song \"Magnificat and Nunc dimittis\" which he had heard in boy choir. Characterized by its unusual chord progression, the song was recorded on 2 March 1965 during a three-hour session held at Decca Studios along with several other tracks, all of whom were by their standard producer Ken Jones, who knew what Argent had looked for in the song and attempted to produce it in that style.", "\"She's Coming Home\" was one of two Argent compositions recorded during the session, along with \"Somebody Help Me\". Two other songs were recording during that session, White's \"I Must Move\" and lead vocalist Colin Blunstone's \"Just Out Of Reach.\" Held at Decca Studios on 2 March 1965, the recording was led and produced by Ken Jones, who was a long-time collaborator of the band. The song was completed in ten takes, after which the vocals were added. This continued the Zombies style of recording, which included recording several takes of the backing track, before choosing the best to overdub and add the vocal track over. Ken Jones, who thought he knew the sound Argent wanted, attempted to create a big band mood to the song. In doing so, Jones accidentally went overboard in his use of reverberation on both the lead- and backing vocals, which at the time was common practice, but became apparent in following decades following the popularity of digital audio."]}, {"page": "I Want You Back Again", "response": ["The initial version of the song was laid down at Decca Studios number 2 on 25 November 1964, together with their standard producer Ken Jones. Because seven tracks where recorded during that session, the Zombies were tired upon the time \"I Want You Back Again was recorded, which led to them getting unsatisfied with the end result. The group would only attempt the song again on 2 March 1965, once again at Decca together with Jones. During that session, the band laid down several songs, including \"She's Coming Home.\" \"I Want You Back Again\" was recorded in 11 takes during that session, after which, the group satisfied, shelved the recording in Decca's vault. Author Claes Johansen writes that the song was rhythm and blues-inspired, which in his eyes worked well when it was written by the group. Both Matthew Greenwald from AllMusic and Michael Galluci of Ultimate Classic Rock identify the single as \"jazzy\", with Greenwald adding that it has characteristics of waltz too."]}, {"page": "Whenever You're Ready (The Zombies song)", "response": ["According to Argent, he was heavily inspired by the American vocal group the Impressions, who the Zombies also covered several tracks by on stage. One of these songs was \"People Get Ready\", a song that Argent thought was good and in an attempt to compose something in that style, he came up with \"Whenever You're Ready. The song was initially demoed in early June of 1965, following their US tour. A few weeks after this, on 24 June, the group once again returned to Decca Studios number two in order to an entire batch of songs, including \"Whenever You're Ready.\" The single took 9 takes to record,Zombie Heaven (liner notes pg. 45).
