In the first ten games of the season three players had been tried, and Derby County had lost eight of those games and conceded 36 goals at 3.6 per game. William Hopewell was the latest to be dropped and J Smith replaced him. However, Smith could not have had a tougher start. Smith made his League and Derby County debut at Deepdale, Preston home of \"The Invincibles\", Preston North End on 8 December 1888. The pitch was heavy and Derby County were kicking uphill however, Hopewell and his defending colleagues made a fight of it. Preston North End got an early goal but with some great goalkeeping by Joseph Marshall and counter-attacking, Smith nearly scored on his debut, Derby County were only 1-0 down at half-time. The second-half remained even with Marshall still playing well."]}, {"page": "Hopewell, William", "response": ["#redirectWilliam Hopewell"]}]}}
