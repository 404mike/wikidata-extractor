He left only a fragmentary prose sketch of a work to be called Die Sieger, but the topic inspired his later opera Parsifal. Furthermore, the draft was used by composer Jonathan Harvey in his 2007 opera Wagner Dream. In Wagner's version of the legend, which he based on orientalist Eug\u00e8ne Burnouf's translations, the magical spell of Prak\u1e5bti's mother does not work on \u0100nanda, and Prak\u1e5bti turns to the Buddha to explain her desires for \u0100nanda. The Buddha replies that a union between Prak\u1e5bti and \u0100nanda is possible, but Prak\u1e5bti must agree to the Buddha's conditions. Prak\u1e5bti agrees, and it is revealed that the Buddha means something else than she does: he asks Prak\u1e5bti to ordain as a bhikkhun\u012b, and live the celibate life as a kind of sister to \u0100nanda. At first, Prak\u1e5bti weeps in dismay, but after the Buddha explains that her current situation is a result of karma from her previous life, she understands and rejoices in the life of a bhikkhun\u012b. Apart from the spiritual themes, Wagner also addresses the faults of the caste system by having the Buddha criticize it."]}, {"page": "May 3", "response": ["*1939 \u2013 Jonathan Harvey, English composer and educator (d. 2012)"]}, {"page": "Richard Wagner", "response": ["Jonathan Harvey's opera Wagner Dream (2007) intertwines the events surrounding Wagner's death with the story of Wagner's uncompleted opera outline Die Sieger (The Victors)."]}, {"page": "Rudolf Steiner", "response": ["* composers Jonathan HarveyAlexandra Coghlan \"Weltethos: CBSO, Gardner, Royal Festival Hall\" ArtsDesk 08/10/2012 and Viktor Ullmann;Gwyneth Bravo, Viktor Ullmann and"]}, {"page": "Overtone", "response": ["Spectral music is a genre developed by G\u00e9rard Grisey and Tristan Murail in the 1970s and 80s, under the auspices of IRCAM. Broadly, spectral music deals with resonance and acoustics as compositional elements. For example, in Grisey's seminal work Partiels, the composer used a sonogram to analyze the true sonic characteristics of the lowest note on a tenor trombone (E2). The analysis revealed which overtones were most prominent from that sound, and Partiels was then composed around the analysis. Another seminal spectral work is Tristan Murail's Gondwana for orchestra. This work begins with a spectral analysis of a bell, and gradually transforms it into the spectral analysis of a brass instrument. Other spectralists and post-spectralists include Jonathan Harvey, Kaija Saariaho, and Georg Friedrich Haas."]}, {"page": "St John's College, Cambridge", "response": ["The choir has an extensive discography of nearly 100 commercial releases dating back to the 1950s, when it was signed to the Decca/Argo label under George Guest.
