He also appeared in three games for the Combined Services, once for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and once for an 'Over 33' side in first-class cricket.\nHalliday was born in Pudsey, Yorkshire, and was a useful county all-rounder, Halliday scored 8,556 runs at 31.80, with 12 centuries to his name, including three against Gloucestershire.  His highest score, 144, came against Derbyshire at Queen's Park, Chesterfield in 1950.  He scored 54 fifties and took 144 catches.

After his retirement from the first-class game he served as coach to Scarborough College and Scarborough Cricket Club.\nHalliday died in August 1967 in Stanley, Wakefield, Yorkshire, aged 47.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Fred Trueman", "response": ["The great Yorkshire team of the 1930s had been broken up by the Second World War and a rebuilding phase was underway by the late 1940s, although Yorkshire had won the first post-war County Championship in 1946. Norman Yardley succeeded Brian Sellers as captain in 1948 and his main team members that season were Len Hutton, Ted Lester, Harry Halliday, Vic Wilson, Willie Watson, Frank Smailes, Johnny Wardle, Don Brennan (wicket-keeper), Ellis Robinson, Ron Aspinall and Alex Coxon. Others in the picture were future captain Billy Sutcliffe and two more young fast-medium bowlers, Bill Foord and Johnny Whitehead. The main team changes in 1949 were the retirement of Frank Smailes; the immediate establishment of Close and Lowson, who played in 22 and 24 championship matches respectively while Trueman only played in four; and an injury to Aspinall who was restricted to just three games. Aspinall had taken thirty wickets in his three matches and had been picked for a Test Trial but, at the end of May, he ruptured an Achilles tendon and was out of action for the rest of the season; indeed, he was never an effective bowler again.Arlott, p. 25."]}, {"page": "Halliday", "response": ["*Harry Halliday (cricketer, born 1920) (1920\u20131967), English cricketer", "*Harry Halliday (cricketer, born 1855) (1855\u20131922), New Zealand cricketer"]}, {"page": "1947 English cricket season", "response": ["Yorkshire fell from champions to seventh and used 25 different players in the championship alone. There was future promise in five new caps: wicketkeeper Don Brennan, batsmen Willie Watson and Gerald Smithson, fast bowler Alec Coxon and left arm spinner Johnny Wardle. In addition, future stalwart Ted Lester began his career with three successive centuries and topped the county averages. Future captain Vic Wilson made a few appearances. Brian Sellers captained the team for the final time before handing over to Norman Yardley for the 1948 season. Bill Bowes in his final season topped the bowling averages and received a record benefit. He was supported by Wardle, off spinner Ellis Robinson, seamer Frank Smailes and new pace bowlers Coxon and Ron Aspinall. Yorkshire were hit by the loss through illness, after only four matches, of slow left armer Arthur Booth, who had been their outstanding player in 1946.Playfair, p. 82. The batting was generally not up to scratch and relied far too much on one man, the great Len Hutton who, because of Test calls, played in only half of Yorkshire's championship matches. Other players included Harry Crick, Harry Halliday, Freddie Jakeman, Geoffrey Keighley and pace bowler John Whitehead.Playfair, pp. 95\u201397."]}, {"page": "John Naylor (cricketer)", "response": ["Born in Thurcroft, near Rotherham, Yorkshire, England, Naylor's only game was against Somerset at Headingley in the County Championship.  He bowled 35 overs for 84 runs in the first innings, and seven more overs for four runs in the second, with his slow left arm orthodox spin.  He failed to take a wicket, although he did catch David Kitson off the bowling of Harry Halliday for 15."]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1946\u20131977)", "response": ["* Harry Halliday (1952) : H.
