Everton's Steven then attempted to score after Coventry full-back David Phillips had given away the ball, but Downs's tackle denied him. Everton had more of the possession in the latter part of the first half, but both sides continued to attack. Sharp made a run down the right wing, with Coventry's defence stretched, but Phillips stopped the attack with a well-timed tackle. Speedie then had another chance from an Ogrizovic clearance, but Everton captain Kevin Ratcliffe won the ball easily. Paul Power ran down the right, crossing the ball into the penalty area over Ogrizovic's head, but Pickering cleared the ball over the crossbar. Coventry then had what Coventry Evening Telegraph reporter Roger Draper called their \"best move of the match\", with Houchen, Pickering and Bennett all involved in the build-up, but Speedie's header went wide. Just before half-time, Heath back-heeled the ball to Steven who sprinted down the pitch and delivered a pass into the centre.  Trevor Peake was unable to reach the ball as it flew over his head and Wayne Clarke was able to strike it firmly into the roof of the Coventry City net to give Everton a 1\u20130 lead.
