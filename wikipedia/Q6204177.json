Douglas Coupland writes, \"Anybody can describe a pre-moistened towelette to you, but it takes a good observational comedian to tell you what, exactly, is the 'deal' with them.\" He adds that observational comedy first of all depends on a \"lone noble comedian adrift in the modern world, observing the unobservable \u2013 those banalities and fragments of minutiae lurking just below the threshold of perception: Cineplex candy; remote control units.\""]}, {"page": "The Comic Side of 7 Days", "response": ["Various comedians comment on the week's news.
