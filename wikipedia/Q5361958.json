For over 30 years, he devoted his spare time to photography. He was particularly interested in architecture. He took black and white photographs of buildings in Dundee from the 1870s to 1905. It was fortunate that he was active at this time, because subsequent redevelopment work in Dundee resulted in some buildings of the City vanishing forever.Before his death in 1922 he bequeathed the majority of his 5,000 glass negatives to the Free Library Committee of the Town Council, with the sum of \u00a350 to assist with the cost of conservation.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Scots", "response": ["* Alexander Wilson (died 1922), noted amateur photographer, working in Dundee"]}, {"page": "Duns, Scottish Borders", "response": ["* Alexander Wilson (d. 1922), photographer"]}, {"page": "Alexander Wilson", "response": ["* Alexander Wilson (British writer) (1893\u20131963), MI6 officer and writer of a series of spy novels", "* Alexander Wilson (Canadian writer) (1953\u20131993), American-born Canadian writer, landscape designer, and community activist", "* Sir Alexander Wilson (British Army officer) (1858\u20131937), British Army major-general and Lieutenant-Governor of Jersey", "* Alexander Wilson (Virginia politician), United States Representative from Virginia, 1803\u20131809", "* Alexander Wilson (Wisconsin politician) (1833\u20131888), attorney general of Wisconsin, 1878\u20131882", "* Alexander Wilson (New South Wales politician) (1849\u20131927), member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly", "* Alexander Wilson (Australian politician) (1889\u20131954), Member of the Australian House of Representatives", "* Alexander Wilson (Scottish politician) (1917\u20131978), Labour Member of Parliament for Hamilton", "* Alexander Wilson (cricketer) (1840\u20131911), New Zealand cricketer", "* Alexander Wilson (astronomer) (1714\u20131786), Scottish type-maker, meteorologist and astronomer", "* Alexander Wilson (ornithologist) (1766\u20131813), Scottish-American poet and ornithologist", "* Alexander Wilson (photographer) (died 1922), Scottish amateur photographer of Dundee", "* Alexander Wilson (British architect) (1888\u20131969), English architect based in Nottingham"]}, {"page": "History of Dundee", "response": ["*Alexander Wilson (died 1922) \u2013 noted amateur photographer, working in Dundee"]}, {"page": "1922 in Scotland", "response": ["* Alexander Wilson, photographer (born in Duns)"]}, {"page": "Alexander Wilson (Photographer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alexander Wilson (photographer)"]}]}}
