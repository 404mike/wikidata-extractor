It was used by six artists and designers, including David Hockney and Richard Hamilton, to create original artwork in the 1987 BBC series Painting with Light. Quantel also placed a number of Paintbox IV series systems in art schools in the UK, including Blackpool College where it was used extensively by artist Adrian Wilson to create digital images, including the James album cover for Gold Mother. Two of Wilson's Paintbox pieces were included in the pioneering Art & Computers exhibition at the Cleveland Art Gallery, England, September 1988 and he was sponsored by Quantel, who used his images for the cover of the Graphic Paintbox sales brochure. One recipient, Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art had recently appointed the video artist Stephen Partridge as a lecturer who then established (1984) The Television Workshop to support artists and filmmakers' production and access to high-level broadcast technology. Over 400 productions were supported in this way from 1984 to 1992 until desktop video pre-empted the need. Artists and filmmakers using the workshop included Richard Morrison,  Jeff Keen, Robert Cahen, Tamara Krikorian, Pictorial Heroes, Judith Goddard and many others.The Television Workshop The music video for Dire Straits' \"Money for Nothing\" was created on a Bosch FGS-4000 3D animation system using a Quantel Paintbox for backgrounds and textures. Graphics for Disney Sing-Along Songs were also created on a Paintbox."]}, {"page": "List of video artists", "response": ["* Judith Goddard"]}]}}
