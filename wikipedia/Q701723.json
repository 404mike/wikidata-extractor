The Prince Regent and his advisers decided on William, Hereditary Prince of Orange, son and heir-apparent of Prince William VI of Orange. Such a marriage would increase British influence in Northwest Europe. William made a poor impression on Charlotte when she first saw him, at George's birthday party on 12 August, when he became intoxicated, as did the Prince Regent himself and many of the guests. Although no one in authority had spoken to Charlotte about the proposed marriage, she was quite familiar with the plan through palace whispers.  Dr. Henry Halford was detailed to sound out Charlotte about the match; he found her reluctant, feeling that a future British queen should not marry a foreigner. Believing that his daughter intended to marry Prince William Frederick, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh, the Prince Regent saw his daughter and verbally abused both her and Gloucester. According to Charlotte, \"He spoke as if he had the most improper ideas of my inclinations. I see that he is compleatly  poisoned against me, and that he will never come round.\"  She wrote to Earl Grey for advice; he suggested she play for time. The matter soon leaked to the papers, which wondered whether Charlotte would marry \"the Orange or the Cheese\" (a reference to Gloucester cheese), \"Slender Billy\" [of Orange] or \"Silly Billy\".  The Prince Regent attempted a gentler approach, but failed to convince Charlotte who wrote that \"I could not quit this country, as Queen of England still less\" and that if they wed, the Prince of Orange would have to \"visit his frogs solo\".  However, on 12 December, the Prince Regent arranged a meeting between Charlotte and the Prince of Orange at a dinner party, and asked Charlotte for her decision. She stated that she liked what she had seen so far, which George took as an acceptance, and quickly called in the Prince of Orange to inform him."]}, {"page": "Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz", "response": ["|data-sort-value=\"Mary\"|Princess Mary, Duchess of Gloucester and Edinburgh||25 April 1776||30 April 1857||married 1816, Prince William Frederick, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh; no issue"]}]}}
