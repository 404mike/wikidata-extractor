He was educated at Woodcote House school, Windlesham, and afterwards entered Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where he obtained a first-class in the mathematical tripos in 1881. He afterwards carried out investigations for the Royal Meteorological Society on the subject of wind forces, and in connexion with this work designed the Dines pressure-tube anemometer.In 1901 he commenced researches into the problems of the upper air, and designed or perfected several instruments for use with kites, as well as a form of the Hargraves box-kite, which proved of great value. In 1905 he was appointed by the Meteorological Office director of experiments in connexion with the investigation of the upper air, and in 1907 designed a meteorograph for use with balloons. He also produced, in conjunction with Dr. Napier Shaw, the microbarograph and a recording mercury barometer, as well as various other instruments. From 1901 to 1902 he was President of the Royal Meteorological Society and in 1905 was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. Although he was never a full-time academic, he was a member of the International Commission for Scientific Aeronautics, and became an honorary or corresponding member of various foreign scientific societies. He is the author of many important papers on the meteorology of the upper atmosphere which appeared in the Transactions of the Royal Society, the Geophysical Memoirs of the Meteorological Office and elsewhere.\nHe lived at Pyrton House near Watlington from 1906 to 1913, and at Colne House at Benson from 1913 to 1927. He is remembered in Benson by an Oxfordshire Blue Plaque.Dines was the father of John Somers Dines, MA, and Lewen Henry George Dines, MA, AMICE.  Both sons followed in their father's footsteps as meteorologists.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Anemometer", "response": ["thumb|left|Tube anemometer invented by William Henry Dines. The movable part (right) is mounted on the fixed part (left).", "The successful metal pressure tube anemometer of William Henry Dines in 1892 utilized the same pressure difference between the open mouth of a straight tube facing the wind and a ring of small holes in a vertical tube which is closed at the upper end. Both are mounted at the same height. The pressure differences on which the action depends are very small, and special means are required to register them. The recorder consists of a float in a sealed chamber partially filled with water. The pipe from the straight tube is connected to the top of the sealed chamber and the pipe from the small tubes is directed into the bottom inside the float. Since the pressure difference determines the vertical position of the float this is a measure of the wind speed."]}, {"page": "Radiosonde", "response": ["Gustave Hermite and Georges Besan\u00e7on, from France, were the first in 1892 to use a balloon to fly the meteograph. In 1898, L\u00e9on Teisserenc de Bort organized at the Observatoire de M\u00e9t\u00e9orologie Dynamique de Trappes the first regular daily use of these balloons. Data from these launches showed that the temperature lowered with height up to a certain altitude, which varied with the season, and then stabilized above this altitude. De Bort's discovery of the tropopause and stratosphere was announced in 1902 at the French Academy of Sciences. Other researchers, like Richard A\u00dfmann and William Henry Dines, were working at the same times with similar instruments."]}, {"page": "Timeline of meteorology", "response": ["* 1892 \u2013 William Henry Dines invented another kind of anemometer, called the pressure-tube (Dines) anemometer.
