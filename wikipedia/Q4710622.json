He made one further appearance before returning to Bray Unknowns soon after. He returned to the Football League in 1933 for a brief spell with Norwich City but was unable to break into the first team. He later played for Swiss side Lausanne, Stenhousemuir, Sligo Rovers and Lisburn Distillery."]}, {"page": "1930\u201331 Cardiff City F.C. season", "response": ["A second relegation in as many seasons prompted the club to release several long-serving players including club captain Keenor, record goalscorer Davies and Harry Wake. Other first team players who were released included Blackburn, Bird, Robinson, Valentine, Bobby Weale and Williams. Albert Keating was also due to be released following a doctor's report on his knee, however he was eventually retained for the following season. The poor results of the first team severely impacted the club's finances; attendance figures at the club averaged below 10,000 for the season and totalled around \u00a39,000 in revenue, a drop of more than \u00a35,000 from the previous season. The income was the lowest the club had gained since the First World War and resulted in an overall loss of \u00a3723 for the campaign. Cardiff would not return to the second tier for more than 15 years, eventually gaining promotion in the 1947\u201348 season."]}, {"page": "1931\u201332 Cardiff City F.C. season", "response": ["Following a second relegation in three years, the club released a number of players. The most prominent of these were long-serving trio Fred Keenor, Len Davies and Harry Wake. Albert Keating was also due to be released following a doctor's report on a knee injury he had sustained, but was eventually retained for the campaign. Stewart made several new signings for the season, with Peter Ronan, Stan Holt, Owen McNally and Harry O'Neill all arriving ahead of the new campaign."]}]}}
