The Metropolitan Asylums Board had established some 8,500 isolation beds and it was agreed that these beds could be used to meet the obligations of the London County Council.  The Board was eventually dissolved in March 1930 as a result of the Local Government Act 1929 and its 24,000 beds transferred to the Council.  The Local Government Act permitted, but did not compel, local authorities to take over Poor Law institutions, and to bring some measure of order into an expanded municipal hospital system. This opportunity was exploited by the LCC, which by 1936 had become a stronghold for members of the Socialist Medical Association. Somerville Hastings, President of the SMA, was chairman of the LCC's hospital committee.  \"The LCC constituted a crucible for experiment, a state within the medical state\" which informed the Ministry of Health during the evolution of its thinking on a comprehensive health service. The expansion of health services by the LCC resulted in the maternal death rate per thousand births falling dramatically, from 7.2 in 1932 to 2.49 in 1937 and London under Labour going from well above to below the national average."]}, {"page": "Thora Silverthorne", "response": ["Thora Silverthorne (1910\u20131999), also known as \"Red Silverthorne\", was a British Communist, healthcare activist, and a nanny for Somerville Hastings, former president of the Socialist Medical Association (SMA), and Labour Party MP for Reading, Berkshire.

Although she was also a member of the UK Labour party, she remained a lifelong member of the CPGB. During her teenage years in Reading, Silverthorne supported herself by selling the Daily Worker to railway staff, and she worked as a Nanny for Reading Labour Party MP and founder of the Socialist Medical Association (SMA), Somerville Hastings. Hastings was known to have supported Silverthorne's ambition to become a nurse. In March 1931, Silverthorne started training as a nurse at the Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford, where her older sister Olive was already working as a nurse.  She volunteered as a nurse for Lancashire hunger marchers passing through Oxford during the National Hunger March, and was prone to \"helping herself to bandages and dressings\" from the wards of the Radcliffe Infirmary. During her time in Oxford, she was given the nickname \"Red Silverthorne\" for her communist activities, and would also become friends with the Marxist historian Christopher Hill who she met through the Oxford communist society known as the October Club."]}, {"page": "Horace Joules", "response": ["After completion of his studies in 1925 Joules took up the posts of house physician at the Middlesex Hospital and Brompton Hospital. He was then appointed medical officer and registrar to the City of London Maternity Hospital and Middlesex Hospitals. In 1929 he left London to become resident physician to the Selly Oak Hospital, Birmingham. \u00a0While at the Middlesex Hospital, Joules had been inspired by Somerville Hastings, surgeon in charge of\u00a0 the Ear and Throat Department,  who was also chairman of the London County Council and subsequently became a Labour MP for Barking. It is likely that Somerville Hastings influenced Joule's socialist views, although Palladino has also suggested that Joules' left-wing politics also grew out of the strong Christian Socialist tradition in Britain. In 1930 Joules became a member of the newly formed Socialist Medical Association (SMA), and was influential in its subsequent development.", "Around the same time, in 1952, Joules became aware of the evidence linking cigarette smoking to lung cancer. Richard Doll had joined the Social Medicine Unit at Central Middlesex Hospital in 1948 to work with Francis Avery-Jones on peptic ulcer disease, but by 1950 he was working with Austin Bradford Hill at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine on the possible link between cigarette smoking and lung cancer. Joules had been a heavy smoker for 30 years but after seeing Doll and Hill's results he became entirely convinced of the harmful effects of smoking. His father had died of lung cancer and he immediately stopped smoking himself and became a strident voice in the campaign against tobacco. Since Joules was a member of the CHSC, SAC(CR) and SMAC he was ideally placed to press the issue with the Ministry of Health. Still, he was often a lone voice speaking against tobacco and was opposed by many inside and outside of government. In 1952 an anonymous civil servant in the Ministry of Health wrote that:[Joules] \u2018is as you know the main protagonist against smoking - on the CHSC, on the SAC(CR) and in the Press.\u2019 Nevertheless, despite opposition from Sir Ernest Rock Carling, chair of the SAC(CR), he persuaded the Central Health Services Council to make the first official statement in Britain on the harmful effects of cigarette smoking. It is likely his contacts with the Labour Minister for Health, Hilary Marquand, and the recent death in February 1952 of King George VI, a heavy smoker, from a heart attack after an operation for lung cancer helped his case. Joules also energetically lobbied the Press, the Chief Medical Officer, and the Royal College of Physicians.  In 1953 Joules was quoted in Parliament by the Labour MP, Harry Hynd as saying that: 'by 1965...unless something is done [about smoking], the number of deaths per annum [from lung cancer] will reach 25,000.'In 1954 Joules' appointment to SAC(CR) was not renewed - he had rocked the boat too much and his political views were unpalatable to the Conservative government that had been elected in 1951. His dismissal, along with those of Somerville Hastings, and David Stark Murray resulted in trade union protests, but these had no effect. Joules was replaced by Janet Aitken, who admitted to the Health Minister that: \u2018I am not really an expert from a medical point of view in cancer and radiotherapy.\u2019 Nevertheless, although Joules had been dropped from SAC(CR), he was still a member of the SMAC and he persuaded it to advise the Minister that it was \u2018desirable that appropriate action should be taken constantly to inform the public of the known connection between smoking and cancer of the lung and of the risks involved in heavy smoking\u2019.  This was blocked by the CHSC in October 1955 who considered it would be \u2018wise\u2019 to await the outcome of further research, including that financed by the tobacco companies. Nevertheless, the tide of opinion was turning and in March 1956 the CHSC yielded to a further recommendation from the SMAC and advised that:"]}, {"page": "Mile End (London County Council constituency)", "response": ["| Somerville Hastings"]}]}}
