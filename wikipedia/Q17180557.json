He was educated in England at Harrow School, and in 1785 he married his cousin Elizabeth n\u00e9e Bateman. They had 4 sons and 2 daughters.He was High Sheriff of County Kerry in 1792.\nIn 1798 he was elected to the House of Commons of Ireland for both the borough of Tralee and for Kerry, but chose to sit for the county seat.\nHis election had been organised by his cousin John Crosbie, 2nd Earl of Glandore, whose continued support ensured his return to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom. However he ran out of money and fell out with Glandore, and with neither patronage nor money he was unable to contest the 1806 general election.A legacy and the support of Lord Ventry secured his re-election in 1812, and he held the seat until 1826. On the death of John Crosbie, 2nd Earl of Glandore he was able to obtain the coveted post of Custos Rotulorum of Kerry, which he held until his own death in 1836.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Old Harrovians", "response": ["*James Crosbie ( 1760\u20131836), MP for Kerry in both the Irish (1798\u20131800) and British parliaments (1801\u20131806; 1812\u20131826)"]}, {"page": "Kerry (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| James Crosbie", "| James Crosbie"]}, {"page": "Tralee (Parliament of Ireland constituency)", "response": ["| James Crosbie"]}, {"page": "Crosbie", "response": ["*James Crosbie (senator), Irish barrister, journalist and Fine Gael politician, senator 1938\u201351 and 1954\u201357", "*James Crosbie (Kerry politician) (c.1760\u20131836), MP for County Kerry 1798\u20131806, 1812\u201326"]}, {"page": "Kerry (Parliament of Ireland constituency)", "response": ["| James Crosbie"]}, {"page": "Members of the 1st UK Parliament from Ireland", "response": ["| James Crosbie"]}, {"page": "Members of the 2nd UK Parliament from Ireland", "response": ["| *James Crosbie"]}, {"page": "James Crosbie", "response": ["James Crosbie may refer to:", "* James Crosbie (senator), Irish barrister, journalist and Fine Gael politician, senator 1938\u201351 and 1954\u201357", "* James Crosbie (Kerry politician) (c1760\u20131836), MP for County Kerry 1798\u20131806, 1812\u201326"]}, {"page": "Custos Rotulorum of Kerry", "response": ["*1815\u20131836: James Crosbie"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1820 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|James Crosbie||"]}, {"page": "List of MPs in the first United Kingdom Parliament", "response": ["| James Crosbie"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1802 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| James Crosbie"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1812 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| James Crosbie"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1818 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| James Crosbie"]}, {"page": "James Crosbie (died 1836)", "response": ["#REDIRECT James Crosbie (Kerry politician)"]}]}}
