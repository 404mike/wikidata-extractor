From an Internet broadcast, they demand Britain cancel the ceremonies during Remembrance Sunday or Sullivan will be executed. Lucas feels determined to help, much to Harry's reluctance, as he believes Lucas should be properly rested, but eventually allows him to work until they find Sullivan. Malcolm Wynn-Jones (Hugh Simon) voice matches one of the terrorists to Aaqib Faris (Shane Zaza), and learns he works under a Munzir Hatem, a known cell leader. In the middle of the night, Adam and Lucas silently break into Hatem's home and gather intelligence from his mobile phone. On the morning of Remembrance Sunday, the team find that Hatem sends out messages to a man codenamed \"Firefly\" to relay it to Faris. Ben Kaplan (Alex Lanipekun) follows Firefly to a payphone, and Malcolm traces where he is calling. Adam and Lucas arrive at the house Sullivan is being held and successfully rescues him."]}, {"page": "Love at First Sight (2011 film)", "response": ["* Shane Zaza as S.L.Y.M.", "The male lead Shane Zaza (lead in David Hare's Behind the Beautiful Flowers at London's Royal National Theatre) won two awards for his performance in this film, both in India: for Best Actor by the Gujarat International Film Festival, and for Best Actor at the Imphal International Short Film Festival.
