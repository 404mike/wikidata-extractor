Designed by John Murray Easton for the London and North Eastern Railway, on behalf of London Transport, the main structure consists of a high, square block dominated by large arched windows at high level. The main elevation is flanked by symmetrical wings and, to the south, a single storey extension. The whole building, as well as the associated disused signal cabin and sub-station, is finished in carefully bonded, incised, gault bricks. The ticket hall takes the form of a lofty arched hall, from which leads a subway that gives access to the two island platforms. The platforms are dominated by graceful, gull-winged shaped reinforced canopies that were altered during 1980s renovations. Although some original platform furniture has been lost the timber platform benches, with the London Underground roundel forming the seat backs, survive.Underground Architecture; David Lawrence; Capital Transport; London; 1994"]}, {"page": "Royal Gold Medal", "response": ["|John Murray Easton"]}, {"page": "Cambridge Medical School building", "response": ["The Department of Zoology moved in 1933 into the redeveloped building.
