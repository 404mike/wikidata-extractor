He was one of the Uranians, a clandestine group of British men who wrote poetry idealizing the beauty and love of adolescent boys. As a school master at various boarding schools in England and Wales, Nicholson formed \"passionate friendships\" with some of his students, and dedicated much of his poetry to favoured students.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "LGBT movements", "response": ["From the 1870s, social reformers began to defend homosexuality, but due to the controversial nature of their advocacy, kept their identities secret. A secret British society called the \"Order of Chaeronea\" campaigned for the legalization of homosexuality, and counted playwright Oscar Wilde among its members in the last decades of the 19th century.McKenna, Neil (2003), \"The Secret Life of Oscar Wilde: An Intimate Biography\". (London: Century)  The society was founded by George Cecil Ives, one of the earliest gay rights campaigners, who had been working for the end of oppression of homosexuals, what he called the \"Cause\". Ives met Wilde at the Authors' Club in London in 1892. Wilde was taken by his boyish looks and persuaded him to shave off his moustache, and once kissed him passionately in the Travellers' Club. In 1893, Lord Alfred Douglas, with whom he had a brief affair, introduced Ives to several Oxford poets whom Ives also tried to recruit. In 1897, Ives created and founded the first homosexual rights group, the Order of Chaeronea. Members included Charles Kains Jackson, Samuel Elsworth Cottam, Montague Summers, and John Gambril Nicholson."]}, {"page": "The Importance of Being Earnest", "response": ["It has been said that the use of the name Earnest may have been a homosexual in-joke.Annan (1990:118) In 1892, three years before Wilde wrote the play, John Gambril Nicholson had published the book of pederastic poetry Love in Earnest. The sonnet Of Boys' Names included the verse: \"Though Frank may ring like silver bell / And Cecil softer music claim / They cannot work the miracle / \u2013'Tis Ernest sets my heart a-flame.\"Nicholson (1892:61) The word \"earnest\" may also have been a code-word for homosexual, as in: \"Is he earnest?\", in the same way that \"Is he so?\" and \"Is he musical?\" were employed. Sir Donald Sinden, an actor who had met two of the play's original cast (Irene Vanbrugh and Allan Aynesworth), and Lord Alfred Douglas, wrote to The Times to dispute suggestions that \"Earnest\" held any sexual connotations:The Times, 2 February 2001, p. 19"]}, {"page": "Frederick Rolfe", "response": ["Rolfe was entirely comfortable with his homosexuality and associated and corresponded with a number of other homosexual Englishmen. Early in his life he wrote a fair amount of idealistic but mawkish poetry about boy martyrs and the like. These and his Toto stories contain pederastic elements, but the young male pupils he was teaching at the time unanimously recalled in later life that there had never been any hint of impropriety in his relations with them. As he himself matured, Rolfe's settled sexual preference was for late adolescents. Towards the end of his life he made his only explicit reference to his specific sexual age preference, in one of the Venice letters to Charles Masson Fox, in which he declared: \"My preference was for the 16, 17, 18 and large.\"Rolfe to Fox, 13 January 1910, in Cecil Woolf ed., The Venice Letters, Cecil & Amelia Woolf, 1974, p.46. In a September 1909 letter to John Gambril Nicholson, Rolfe discussed the subject of sex between a man and a boy, a matter, he told Nicholson, of which \"you have the practical experience which I have not.\" (Miriam J Benkovitz, Frederick Rolfe: Baron Corvo, Hamish Hamilton, 1977, p.248, quoting a letter in the Martyr Worthy Collection, Columbia University Library). Nicholson is the person Rolfe is least likely to have lied to about this.  Grant Richards, in his Memories of a Misspent Youth (1932), recalls \"Frederick Baron Corvo\" at Parson's Pleasure in Oxford \u2013 where scholars could bathe naked \u2013 \"surveying the yellow flesh tints of youth with unbecoming satisfaction\"."]}, {"page": "Uranian poetry", "response": ["The chief poets of this clique were William Johnson Cory, Lord Alfred Douglas, Montague Summers, John Francis Bloxam, Charles Kains Jackson, John Gambril Nicholson, E.\u00a0E.
