He was one of the Uranians, a clandestine group of British men who wrote poetry idealizing the beauty and love of adolescent boys. As a school master at various boarding schools in England and Wales, Nicholson formed \"passionate friendships\" with some of his students, and dedicated much of his poetry to favoured students.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
