He soon made his presence felt when he punched club legend Dave Mackay during training, though no long-term rift developed because of the incident. Spurs went on to have a good 1966\u201367 season though, finishing third in the league and beating Millwall (after a replay), Portsmouth, Bristol City, Birmingham City (after a replay) and Nottingham Forest to reach the 1967 FA Cup Final to face his former club Chelsea at Wembley Stadium. Spurs won the cup with a 2\u20131 victory, Jimmy Robertson and Frank Saul providing the goals before Bobby Tambling scored a late consolation goal for Chelsea. Ironically, earlier in the season Venables had bet \u00a325 on Chelsea to win the cup at odds of 25/1, which would have paid out \u00a3500 if Spurs had lost the game, exactly the same figure as the \u00a3500 cup bonus he would receive for winning the match; in fact after tax deductions, Venables would have been better off financially if Chelsea had won."]}, {"page": "North London derby", "response": ["|align=left|Jimmy Robertson||RW", "|align=left|Jimmy Robertson", "| colspan=\"3\" | Note: Jimmy Robertson and Emmanuel Adebayor are the only players to have scored for both teams in North London derbies."]}, {"page": "James Robertson", "response": ["*Jimmy Robertson (footballer, born 1880) (1880\u2013?), Scottish footballer who played as an inside right", "*Jimmy Robertson (footballer, born 1885) (1885\u20131968), Scottish football forward (Blackburn Rovers, Falkirk)", "*Jimmy Robertson (footballer, born 1909) (1909\u20131979), Scottish footballer who played for Scotland", "*Jimmy Robertson (footballer, born 1913) (1913\u2013?), for Bradford City", "*Jimmy Robertson (footballer, born 1944), Scottish footballer who played for Scotland", "*Jimmy Robertson (footballer, born 1955), Scottish footballer who played as a left winger", "*Jimmy Robertson (American football) (1901\u20131974), American football player, coach at Geneva College (1933)", "*Jimmy Robertson (snooker player) (born 1986), English snooker player"]}, {"page": "1967 FA Cup Final", "response": ["Tottenham won the match 2\u20131 at Wembley, their 5th triumph and third of the decade .
