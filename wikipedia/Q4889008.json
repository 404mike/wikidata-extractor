Titius was a disciple of the German philosopher C.F. von\u00a0Wolf (1679\u20131754), and the second part of the text Titius inserted into Bonnet's work is in a book by von\u00a0Wolf (1723), suggesting that Titius learned the relation from him. Twentieth-century literature about Titius\u2013Bode law attributes authorship to von\u00a0Wolf. A prior version was written by D.\u00a0Gregory (1702), in which the succession of planetary distances 4, 7, 10, 16, 52, and 100 became a geometric progression with ratio 2. This is the nearest Newtonian formula, which was cited by Benjamin Martin and Tom\u00e0s Cerd\u00e0 years before the German publication of Bonnet's book. Over the next two centuries, subsequent authors continued to present their own modified versions, apparently unaware of prior work."]}, {"page": "A Dictionary of the English Language", "response": ["Several more dictionaries followed: in Latin, English, French and Italian.

Enlightenment encyclopedias also inspired authors and editors to undertake or critique \"encyclopedic\" knowledge projects in other genres and formats: the 65-volume Universal History (Sale et al) (1747-1768), for example, far exceeded its predecessors in terms of scope, and The General Magazine of Arts and Sciences (1755-1765) published by Benjamin Martin (lexicographer) sought to bring encyclopedism to the monthly periodical.

After his death, his son, Peter, did take action to enforce the patent.  A number of his competitors, including Bass, Benjamin Martin, Robert Rew and Jesse Ramsden, took action. Dollond's patent was upheld, as the court found that the patent was valid due to Dollond's exploitation of the invention while prior inventors did not.  Several of the opticians were ruined by the expense of the legal proceedings and closed their shops as a result. The patent remained valid until it expired in 1772.
