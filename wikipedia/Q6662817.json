In 1955, he played the three first-class matches at the Weston-super-Mare festival for Somerset, batting in the middle order for the matches with Surrey and Glamorgan and opening the batting against Hampshire. All three matches, on a pitch that Wisden Cricketers' Almanack called \"spiteful\", were lost heavily by Somerset and in two of them the side was dismissed for 36 all out and 37 all out, the two lowest totals of the season. Only against Glamorgan did Williams make runs: his 24 in the first innings was the highest in a total of 108. In six first-class innings, he made just 30 runs.\nWilliams was a housemaster at Millfield for many years and also played club cricket for Bath Cricket Club.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Christ College, Brecon", "response": ["* Lloyd Williams \u2013 cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Lloyd Williams (1955) 3 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Lloyd Williams", "response": ["Lloyd Williams may refer to:", "*Lloyd Williams (businessman) (born 1940), an Australian businessman and thoroughbred racehorse owner", "*Lloyd Williams (footballer) (born 1934), Australian footballer for Collingwood", "*Lloyd Williams (Welsh cricketer) (1925\u20132007), Welsh cricketer", "*Lloyd Williams (Jamaican cricketer) (born 1939), Jamaican cricketer", "*Lloyd Williams (filmmaker) (born 1940), American filmmaker", "*Lloyd Williams (rugby union, born 1933) (1933\u20132017), Wales international rugby union player", "*Lloyd Williams (rugby union, born 1989) (1989\u2013), Wales international rugby union scrum-half", "*J.
