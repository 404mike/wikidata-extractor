The pair were commissioned by Polish king Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski to compile a collection of paintings, which they spent five years doing, but Stanis\u0142aw's exile in 1795 meant the contract could not be completed and they were left with a large collection of paintings. Bourgeois outlived Desenfans and bequeathed the art to Dulwich College with an additional \u00a32000 to build a permanent building to house it. This became the Dulwich Picture Gallery, England's first purpose-built public art gallery.", "link_mentions": {}}}
