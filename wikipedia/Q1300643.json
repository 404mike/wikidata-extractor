The pair were commissioned by Polish king Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski to compile a collection of paintings, which they spent five years doing, but Stanis\u0142aw's exile in 1795 meant the contract could not be completed and they were left with a large collection of paintings. Bourgeois outlived Desenfans and bequeathed the art to Dulwich College with an additional \u00a32000 to build a permanent building to house it. This became the Dulwich Picture Gallery, England's first purpose-built public art gallery.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "National Gallery", "response": ["A plan to acquire 150 paintings from the Orl\u00e9ans collection, which had been brought to London for sale in 1798, also failed, despite the interest of both the King and the Prime Minister, Pitt the Younger. The twenty-five paintings from that collection now in the Gallery, including \"NG1\", arrived later by a variety of routes. In 1799 the dealer Noel Desenfans offered a ready-made national collection to the British government; he and his partner Sir Francis Bourgeois had assembled it for the king of Poland, before the Third Partition in 1795 abolished Polish independence. This offer was declined and Bourgeois bequeathed the collection to his old school, Dulwich College, on his death. The collection opened in 1814 in Britain's first purpose-built public gallery, the Dulwich Picture Gallery.

However, Gavin Stamp thinks it \"unlikely\" that Scott was directly inspired by either of these precedents, arguing instead that \"a dome above segmental curves is, in fact, a logical solution to the geometrical problem of designing a sculptural termination to a square pillar when a flat top is not suitable\".Stamp 1989, pp. 9\u201310."]}, {"page": "1811 in art", "response": ["*January 8 \u2013 Sir Francis Bourgeois, court painter to King George III of the United Kingdom (born 1753)"]}, {"page": "John Soane", "response": ["In 1811, Soane was appointed as architect for Dulwich Picture Gallery, the first purpose-built public art gallery in Britain, to house the Dulwich collection, which had been held by art dealers Sir Francis Bourgeois and his partner Noel Desenfans.
