He was the first of only two men to captain the country at both rugby and cricket but is also remembered as the England cricket captain whose side lost the Test match which gave rise to the Ashes, at home against the Australians in 1882. Additionally, he played football for Blackburn Rovers.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Ashes", "response": ["The first Test match between England and Australia was played in Melbourne, Australia, in 1877, though the Ashes legend started later, after the ninth Test, played in 1882. On their tour of England that year the Australians played just one Test, at the Oval in London. It was a low-scoring affair on a difficult wicket.Fred Spofforth, however, contended that, the fourth innings aside, it played perfectly well. Australia made a mere 63 runs in their first innings, and England, led by A. N. Hornby, took a 38-run lead with a total of 101. In their second innings, Australia, boosted by a spectacular 55 runs off 60 deliveries from Hugh Massie, managed 122, which left England only 85 runs to win. The Australians were greatly demoralised by the manner of their second-innings collapse, but fast bowler Fred Spofforth, spurred on by the gamesmanship of his opponents, in particular W. G. Grace, refused to give in. \"This thing can be done,\" he declared. Spofforth went on to devastate the English batting, taking his final four wickets for only two runs to leave England just eight runs short of victory."]}, {"page": "W. G. Grace", "response": ["Grace made three overseas tours during his career. The first was to the United States and Canada with RA Fitzgerald's team in August and September 1872.Midwinter, p. 45. The expenses of this tour were paid by the Montreal Club who had written to Fitzgerald the previous winter and invited him to form a team. Grace and his all-amateur colleagues made \"short work of the weak teams\" they faced.Birley, p. 122. The team included two other future England captains in A. N. Hornby, who became a rival of Grace in future years; and the Honourable George Harris, the future Lord Harris, who became a very close friend and a most useful ally. The team met in Liverpool on 8 August and sailed on the SS Sarmatian, docking at Quebec on 17 August. Simon Rae recounts that the bond between Grace and Harris was forged by their mutual sea-sickness. Matches were played in Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, London, New York, Philadelphia and Boston. The team sailed back from Quebec on 27 September and arrived at Liverpool on 8 October.Rae, pp. 110\u2013129. The tour was \"a high point of (Grace's) early years\" and he \"retained fond memories of it\" for the rest of his life, calling it \"a prolonged and happy picnic\" in his ghost-written Reminiscences.Rae, p. 110.", "Grace endured a number of tragedies in his life beginning with the death of his father in December 1871.Midwinter, p.35. He was badly upset by the early death of his younger brother Fred in 1880, only two weeks after he, W. G. and E. M. had all played in a Test for England against Australia.Midwinter, p.86. In July 1884, Grace's rival A. N. Hornby stopped play in a Lancashire v Gloucestershire match at Old Trafford so that E. M. and W. G. could return home on receipt of a cable reporting the death of Mrs Martha Grace at the age of 72. The greatest tragedy of Grace's life was the loss of his daughter Bessie in 1898, aged only 20, from typhoid. She had been his favourite child.Midwinter, p.127. Then, in February 1905, his eldest son W. G. junior died of appendicitis at the age of 30.Midwinter, p.140."]}, {"page": "Nantwich", "response": ["*A. N.

During the early 1870s, the team was dominated by A. N. Hornby\u2019s batting. The team's standard of cricket improved with the arrival of two professional players, Dick Barlow and Alex Watson. The impact of Barlow and Hornby was such that their batting partnership was immortalised in the poem At Lord\u2019s  by Francis Thompson. The team was further enhanced by A. G. Steel, an amateur sometimes considered second only to W. G. Grace as the country's best all rounder; Johnny Briggs, a professional from Sutton-in-Ashfield and the only player to score 10,000\u00a0runs and take 1,000\u00a0wickets for Lancashire; and wicket-keeper Dick Pilling, who in 1891 was rated by Wisden Cricketers' Almanack as the second-best wicket-keeper in the world behind Jack Blackham.

Though all three use different restrictions, Lohmann's average of 10.75 is considered the best. If no qualification criteria were applied at all, three players\u2014Wilf Barber, A. N. Hornby and Bruce Murray\u2014would tie for the best average, all having claimed just one wicket in Test matches, without conceding any runs, thus averaging zero."]}]}}
