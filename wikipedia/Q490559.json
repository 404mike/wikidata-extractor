This is the story of the movie The Miracle.\" Kim Seong-Hyun reviewing the film for YTN wrote that the performance of the actors was excellent but, \"despite the strong performances of these actors, the film story is overly dramatic and weakens the narrative link. The conflict structure in the film and the process of resolving it are to the point that it feels forced and artificial..\" Concluding the review Seong-Hyun said, \" The Miracle ends with Richard Sanderson's famous song \"Reality\", which was also used in the movie La Boum in the 80s. The lyrics of the song 'Dream is my reality' are as beautiful as Junkyung's dream, but it is not enough to erase the bitter taste.\""]}]}}
