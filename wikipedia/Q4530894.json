Sarah Makem and her cousin, Annie Jane Kelly, were members of the Singing Greenes of Keady.\nIn the 1950s, song collectors from the United States toured Ireland recording its musical heritage. Makem was visited and recorded by, among others, Diane Guggenheim Hamilton, Jean Ritchie, Peter Kennedy and Sean O'Boyle.
