An acute observer of the continual change in the natural world, she took light and reflection, growth and decay, beaches and tides, pebbles and stones, clouds and shadows and manipulated them to capture a unique view of her surroundings. In addition to pen and ink, pencil, oils, watercolours, and pastels, a series of commissions enabled her to employ egg tempera murals, architectural designs, and industrial enamelling techniques. Irrespective of the media employed, it was with felt that she produced her most compelling and remarkable work. In the words of lifelong friend Duncan Smith: \"Cowern took an ancient craft, pushed it in thrilling new directions and gave us contemporary pieces of the highest order.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Felt", "response": ["As part of the overall renewal of interest in textile and fiber arts, beginning in the 1970s and continuing through today, felt has experienced a strong revival in interest, including its historical roots. Stirling is commonly associated with the development of nuno felting, a key technique for contemporary art felting. German artist Joseph Beuys prominently integrates felt within his works. English artist Jenny Cowern shifted from traditional drawing and painting media into using felt as her primary media."]}, {"page": "Aspatria", "response": ["* Jenny Cowern, artist, lived at Langrigg, Aspatria"]}, {"page": "Bromfield, Cumbria", "response": ["* Jenny Cowern, artist, lived at Langrigg, Aspatria"]}, {"page": "Langrigg", "response": ["* Jenny Cowern, artist, lived at Langrigg, Aspatria"]}, {"page": "List of alumni of the Royal College of Art", "response": ["* Jenny Cowern"]}, {"page": "Mary Burkett", "response": ["While at Abbot Hall she wrote several books on Cumbrian artists and other personalities, including John Bracken, Kurt Schwitters, George Smith (\"the Skiddaw Hermit\"), May Moore, Joseph Sutton, Christopher Steele and George Senhouse.
