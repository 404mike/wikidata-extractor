He talked to black community leaders, who complained about police bias and brutality, and he later had an awkward private meeting with the Chief constable Kenneth Oxford about the matter. He arranged for the bosses of the leading banks and building societies to tour the area in a coach (they were reluctant until Heseltine's PPS Tim Sainsbury persuaded Robin Leigh-Pemberton of NatWest to come), and asked them to each second a bright young manager to the DOE for a year.Crick 1997, pp. 222\u20136."]}, {"page": "National Gallery", "response": ["One of the conditions of the 1982 competition was that the new wing had to include commercial offices as well as public gallery space.
