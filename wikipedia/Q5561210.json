Born in Oldbury, which was then part of Worcestershire, Smith was recommended to Small Heath by Fred Wheldon, and given a run of games at right back in the 1893\u201394 season. He was no improvement on other candidates for the position, and he returned to the reserves, and thence to non-league football with Berwick Rangers (Worcester) in 1894.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "G.

Former Small Heath full-back Tom Bayley was one of several newcomers for the hosts, but their visitors had few changes in personnel. Teddy Jolley came in at full-back, and replacing Billy Walton was Jack Lee, who \"dribbles cleverly, and is a very dangerous forward round goal\". In the presence of 4,000 spectators, Lee scored twice as Small Heath won 3\u20131. Fred Wheldon opened the scoring for Small Heath in the first 30\u00a0seconds of their next match, at home to Rotherham Town; 15\u00a0minutes later the visitors were 3\u20132 ahead, but by half-time the home side had regained the lead. Unsurprisingly the tempo dropped in the second half, but a game played in a \"friendly and sportsmanlike spirit\" was marred towards the end by Rotherham forward Alf Pickering suffering a fracture of his right leg just below the knee in an accidental collision with Bernard Pumfrey, \"the snap of the bone being heard all round the ground\". Initial reports suggested the break was such that he was \"almost certain\" never to play football again. This was followed by a comfortable 6\u20131 defeat of Burton Swifts, in which Jolley moved to inside right in Jack Hallam's absence through illness, giving Gilbert Smith his debut at full back.", "Fred Speller attempted a comeback, appearing twice for the first team early in the season, but the injury received against Darwen proved the end of his professional football career.Matthews, Complete Record, p. 126.
