He attracted the interest of Sheffield United, and joined the club for a five-figure fee in January 2006. He made no first-team appearances during his time in South Yorkshire, although was loaned out twice; first to Mansfield Town and then to Hungarian club Ferencv\u00e1ros. He was released by Sheffield United upon the expiry of his contract in the summer of 2010, and signed for Macclesfield Town shortly after. He spent three seasons at Macclesfield, playing over 100 games. In May 2013, Wedgbury signed for Stevenage on a free transfer. In May 2014, he joined Forest Green Rovers, where he became a fan favourite for his guile, character and uncompromising style of play. He signed for Chesterfield on 22 May 2018 after his contract with Wrexham was cancelled by mutual consent. He has also represented the England C team.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Scott Brown (footballer, born May 1985)", "response": ["On 10 August 2012, Brown signed for Conference Premier club Macclesfield Town after a trial with the club.

However, he left Moss Rose at the end of the month after the club cancelled his non-contract registration. Brown went on to label Steve King a liar and \"a joke\", and called the club a \"sinking ship\" on Twitter. He signed a short-term deal with Conference North club Chester on 5 September 2012. He remained at the Deva Stadium until the end of 2012\u201313 as Chester won the Conference North title. He also made a substitute appearance in the final of the Cheshire Senior Cup, as Chester beat Stalybridge Celtic 2\u20131 at Wincham Park.
