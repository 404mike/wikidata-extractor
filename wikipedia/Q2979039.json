Although vastly more inexperienced, the English team were victorious, and in the away game to Scotland Thomas was replaced by Evan Lloyd. Thomas' final game was his third home match, all of which had been played at different Welsh grounds, Rodney Parade, St. Helen's and now, against Ireland, the Cardiff Arms Park.

The Welsh selectors reacted by making multiple changes to the Welsh pack, but apart from replacing Owen Badger for Gwyn Nicholls, the threequarters were left alone, giving Dauncey a second cap in the second match of the tournament, home to Scotland. Played at the Cardiff Arms Park, two second half tries gave Wales victory over Scotland. Dauncey played his last international game, the last Welsh game of the 1895/96 season, away to Ireland, and Wales lost 4-8.

Morris came into a vastly changed pack to the one that faced England in the prior game, being one of five new forward caps. Included in the team were four Llanelli players; Morris, Cliff Bowen, Charles Nicholl and Jack Evans. Played at the Cardiff Arms Park, Wales beat Scotland by two tries to nil. The selectors kept faith with the team for the last game of the Championship, with the majority of the players returning for the game against Ireland.
