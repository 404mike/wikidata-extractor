The first was a home game at Swansea against England. Charlie Newman regained his position and the captaincy, but the game is more notable as the first international for future Welsh rugby talisman Arthur 'Monkey' Gould. The selectors again reshuffled the Welsh pack, which saw three new forward caps, including Goldsworthy's Swansea teammate, Evan Richards. Wales lost the match, but a more stable team was chosen for the away game to Scotland. The first two encounters between the teams had resulted in Scottish victories, therefore the final result of nil-nil was an improvement for Wales, though the press was critical of Wales as the team employed spoiling tactics to kill the game."]}, {"page": "Edward Perkins Alexander", "response": ["Alexander first came to note as a rugby player when he was selected for the Cambridge University team. He won three sporting Blues, playing in Varsity matches in 1884, 1885 and 1886. In 1885, while still a Cambridge student, he was selected for the Wales national team in their Home Nations Championship encounter with Scotland. Brought in to replace John Sidney Smith, Alexander was part of a nine-man pack which contained four players who would later become Wales team captains, Bob Gould, Tom Clapp, Willie Thomas and Frank Hill. The game ended in a 0-0 draw, Wales' best result against Scotland to date. Alexander was reselected for the next two Wales international matches, against England and Scotland in the 1896 Championship; which saw Wales adopt the four threequarters formation in the Scottish game. the first team to do so at international level. Despite Wales losing both matches, the selectors kept faith with Alexander and he played in the opening and closing matches of the 1887 tournament. Under the captaincy of Charlie Newman, Wales drew the first game against England, but Alexander was replaced for the Scottish game by Evan Richards. The Scotland game was a sporting disaster for Wales, with the Scottish team scoring 12 tries without reply. Alexander regained his position for the last match of the series, now playing for Brecon RFC,Godwin (1984), pg 18. which saw Wales win thanks to a dropped kick from Arthur 'Monkey' Gould."]}, {"page": "Lewis Cobden Thomas", "response": ["Thomas was capped for Wales twice. He was first selected for the Welsh squad in the opening game of the 1885 Home Nations Championship in a match played at St Helen's against England. Thomas was one of three first caps in the Welsh pack for the game, the other two were Ernest Rowland from Lampeter University and Swansea's Evan Richards, but the team is best remembered for introducing Arthur Gould to the Wales team. Wales lost the game, but Thomas was re-selected for the very next game, away to Scotland. Wales drew the game in a nil - nil result and Thomas was dropped for the next tournament. His cap and jersey are held at the Neath clubhouse."]}, {"page": "Ernest Rowland", "response": ["Rowland was awarded his first and only cap for Wales while still at Lampeter University. Played against England as part of the 1895 Home Nations Championship, Rowland was brought into the Welsh pack alongside fellow debuts Lewis Cobden Thomas and Evan Richards. This was the fourth time Wales had played England, and just like the three previous matches England were victorious over the Welsh team. Rowland was replaced for the next game, against Ireland, by Willie Thomas of Llandovery College, and never represented Wales again."]}]}}
