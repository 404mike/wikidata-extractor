After this, Myles continued to receive work in films such as Mansfield Park (1999), From Hell (2001) and The Abduction Club (2002), but her breakthrough role came in the form of Erika in Underworld (2003) before she won the iconic role of Lady Penelope Creighton-Ward in Thunderbirds (2004) propelling her to international stardom. \nFollowing on from this success, Myles moved to Hollywood where she played the main role of Isolde in the epic romantic film Tristan & Isolde (2006) before starring in films including Underworld: Evolution (2006), Art School Confidential (2006), Dracula (2006), Hallam Foe (2007), Outlander (2008), The Damned (2013), Transformers: Age of Extinction (2014) and Blackwood (2015).\nMyles has also received critical acclaim for her television work, particularly as Madame de Pompadour in the Doctor Who episode \"The Girl in the Fireplace\" (2006), Beth Turner in Moonlight (2007\u20132008), Beth Bailey in Spooks (2010) and Rebecca Bishop in A Discovery of Witches (2018\u20132021).\nMyles won a BAFTA for Best Actress for her role as Kate in Hallam Foe (2007) and was also nominated for a BIFA at the British Independent Film Awards for the same film.

Those familiar with the series tended to be more negative. Sukhdev Sandhu of The Daily Telegraph called it \"a quite cretinous travesty of the original series\", saying that the film lacks the TV series's romantic approach to technology (particularly mentioning its rushed version of the countdown to the Thunderbirds takeoff) and suffers from thin plotting and dialogue. He also regarded the entire trend of making films based on decades-old TV series as good-intentioned but misguided, arguing, \"Those programmes can be seen on terrestrial and cable TV. They're available on DVD. They don't need reviving and updating.\" The Houston Chronicles Amy Biancolli similarly called the film a \"rather breathtakingly misconceived attempt to revisit a vintage TV show that did not under any circumstances need to be revisited\". She found the central character Alan \"whiny and uninteresting\", the script poor, the plot contrived and unsatisfying, and the acting wooden, though she noted that her three children enjoyed it much more than she did. She gave it a C-. Ian Freer, writing for Empire, assessed that the film fails to either evoke nostalgia in the generation which watched Thunderbirds as children or provide snappy entertainment for the current generation of children. Like Sandhu, he felt the countdown sequence was so rushed that there is no sense of occasion to a Thunderbird taking to the sky. He also said that the child leads lack spirit and chemistry, and the adult characters suffer from excessive exposition and flat characterization. While he did praise Sophia Myles's performance and the vehicle designs, he considered the film an overall failure and gave it two out of five stars. On the review aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 19% \"rotten\" rating based on 106 reviews.

The story arc was resolved in \"The Time of the Doctor\", wherein it was revealed that the question had been projected by the Time Lords across all of time and space through a \"crack in the skin of the universe\" as a means of contacting the Doctor and seeing whether it was safe to leave the parallel universe in which their planet, Gallifrey, had been left following the events of \"The Day of the Doctor\".

It's more than just a secret, isn't it?\" According to the in-vision commentary on the DVD release, David Tennant had to inform actress Sophia Myles (who played Madame de Pompadour) that she was not, in fact, revealing the Doctor's surname as she believed was the intent of the dialogue. The 2011 mid-series finale \"A Good Man Goes to War\", also written by Moffat, suggested through the character of River Song that the Doctor's travels had influenced the etymology of the word \"doctor\", perverting its meaning on some worlds from \"wise man\" or \"healer\" to \"great warrior\".

To prepare for his role, he met with sex workers or people who had previously been prostitutes. The movie was panned by critics, with the New York Post's Lou Lumenick calling it an \"instant candidate for worst movie of the year\". Franco was cast as a homeless drug addict in the drama City by the Sea (2002) after co-star Robert De Niro saw a snippet of his work in James Dean. He lived on the streets for several days to better understand the subject matter as well as talking to former or still-using drug addicts. He also co-starred with Neve Campbell in Robert Altman's ballet movie The Company (2003). The success of the first Spider-Man film led Franco to reprise the role in the 2004 sequel, Spider-Man 2. The movie was well received by critics, and it proved to be a big financial success, setting a new opening weekend box office record for North America. With revenue of $783\u00a0million worldwide, it became the second highest-grossing film in 2004. The following year he made and starred in the black comedy The Ape and the 2005 war film The Great Raid, in which he portrayed Robert Prince, a captain in the United States Army's elite Sixth Ranger Battalion.
