Led by the free-scoring Friday, the side continued its push for promotion; fourth or higher would be enough to go up. A vital fixture on 31 March 1976 pitted fourth-placed Reading at home against Tranmere Rovers, who occupied third spot; internationally experienced referee Clive Thomas took charge of the game. Friday, who had already scored 18 goals that season, rose to the occasion with an effort that has been described by many sources as one of the greatest ever scored."]}, {"page": "Henderson (surname)", "response": ["*Stewart Henderson,  Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Southampton F.C. season", "response": ["On 8 July 2009 the administrators confirmed that the club had been sold to a buyer \"owned and controlled by Markus Liebherr\".
