Hunter also played five Test matches for England.\nBorn in Scarborough, Yorkshire, England, Hunter, who was one of five brothers, learnt his cricket on the beach at Scarborough and went on to become a first-class wicket-keeper.  Although not rated as amongst the best of his contemporaries, he went on Alfred Shaw's tour of Australia in 1884/5, and it was there that he played his five Tests. He was dogged by ill-health, however, and retired from cricket in 1888, when he was replaced as Yorkshire's wicket-keeper by his brother, David.\nHunter originally was a stonemason, but went on to become a pub landlord.\nHunter died in January 1891 in Rotherham, Yorkshire, aged 35.", "link_mentions": {}}}
