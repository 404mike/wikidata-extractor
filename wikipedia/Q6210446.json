Hunter also played five Test matches for England.\nBorn in Scarborough, Yorkshire, England, Hunter, who was one of five brothers, learnt his cricket on the beach at Scarborough and went on to become a first-class wicket-keeper.  Although not rated as amongst the best of his contemporaries, he went on Alfred Shaw's tour of Australia in 1884/5, and it was there that he played his five Tests. He was dogged by ill-health, however, and retired from cricket in 1888, when he was replaced as Yorkshire's wicket-keeper by his brother, David.\nHunter originally was a stonemason, but went on to become a pub landlord.\nHunter died in January 1891 in Rotherham, Yorkshire, aged 35.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Test cricketers", "response": ["Joe Hunter \u00b7"]}, {"page": "Arthur Dolphin", "response": ["Arthur Dolphin (24 December 1885 \u2013 23 October 1942) was an English first-class cricketer, who kept wicket for Yorkshire County Cricket Club between 1905 and 1927.

It is a testament to his 'good hands' that he never suffered a serious finger injury, nor were his hands damaged at the end of his career, despite the comparatively crude equipment and heavy workload of the time.  In Louis Hall's benefit match against Surrey at Sheffield in 1891, he caught five men and stumped one in an innings, and against the same county seven years later, claimed eight of the twenty wickets, catching two and stumping six at Bradford.
