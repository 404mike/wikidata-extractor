He played the remaining 43 games of the 1953\u201354 season as Bradford finished fifth in Division Three (North). He was then an ever-present in the City side for the following four seasons, failing to miss a league or cup game for the club until he fractured his leg 12 minutes from the end of a game against Mansfield Town on 1 September 1958. His run of 237 league games, and 246 in total, broke the club's record of consecutive appearances held by another full back Charlie Bicknell. The run coincided with goalkeeper Geoff Smith, who played 200 consecutive league games between 1954 and 1958. Mulholland returned to the side in November 1958, playing 22 during the 1958\u201359 season and a further 28 the following season. During his stay at Bradford, he had just two partners at full back\u2014Jock Whyte and Tommy Flockett. He was renowned for his pace, and functions to defend and mark the opposition winger, and has been inaugurated into the club's hall of fame."]}, {"page": "Tom Flockett", "response": ["#REDIRECT Tommy Flockett"]}]}}
