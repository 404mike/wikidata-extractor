As of December 2020, he was ranked the world's sixth best active light heavyweight by the Transnational Boxing Rankings Board, eighth by The Ring Magazine and seventh best by Boxrec.", "Browne used his youth, speed and power advantage to pound out a one-sided 12 round unanimous decision win over Jack, who suffered a horrendous cut on his forehead in round 7. The judges\u2019 scores were 117\u2013110, 116-111 and 119\u2013108 in Browne's favor. Both boxers started fight off slow, but it was Browne who managed to do more to win the early rounds. In round 7, following an accidental clash of heads, a vertical cut appeared on Jack's forehead, with blood streaming down. The head clash seemed to be initiated by Jack, who according to Browne, was coming forward with his head all fight. Jack had his best round in round 12, as he attacked Browne hard in landing some nice shots. At this point, Jack needed a knockout, but was not able to hurt Browne. He lacked the power, and had taken so much punishment. After the fight, Browne said, \"He was a real tough competitor. He thought he would take me deep in the rounds and drown me but I came in shape. I used my athletic ability. I did what I do best -- box the crap out of people. I was too slick, too sharp.\" Jack did not stay long after the bout and was taken to a hospital. After being stitched up, Jack congratulated Browne, \"I would like to thank all of the fans for your support! The cut was a nasty one, but I\u2019m fine now, Alhamdulillah. Congrats to Marcus Browne who fought a great fight. Regardless of the cut he was the better man tonight. I am a warrior and will never quit. I dedicated this fight to the refugee children across the world who fight a much tougher fight than I did tonight. I will continue to fight for them until the end.\" Browne landed 145 of 515 punches thrown (28%) and Jack landed 66 of his 303 thrown (22%).
