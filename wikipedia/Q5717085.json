A congregation of General Baptists began to meet in the 17th century in the village, which was a local centre for Protestant Nonconformist worship, and by the time the present simple Vernacular-style chapel was constructed in 1740 a large proportion of the population held Baptist beliefs.  Along with other General Baptist chapels in Sussex, the congregation moved towards Unitarian views in the mid-18th century; this caused a schism which resulted in a new chapel being formed at nearby Wivelsfield.  The character of the Ditchling chapel was wholly Unitarian by 1800, and it has continued under various names since then.  People associated with the chapel include William Hale White (the author \"Mark Rutherford\"), Henry Acton, Adrian Boult\u2014who was married there\u2014and G. K. Chesterton.  The chapel is set back from Ditchling's main street and has an adjoining house (built in 1672) and graveyard, all of which contribute to the character of the conservation area which covers the centre of Ditchling village.  English Heritage has listed the chapel at Grade II for its architectural and historical importance."]}, {"page": "Acton (surname)", "response": ["* Henry Acton (1797\u20131843), English Unitarian minister"]}, {"page": "Edward Acton (judge)", "response": ["Edward Acton was born in Manchester, the son of Henry Morell Acton and of Anne Shaw, n\u00e9e Williamson.
