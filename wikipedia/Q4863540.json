Lions fullback Jonathan Davies, the \"Welsh Wizard\", put in a Man of the Match performance, including a 50-metre solo try in the first half after being put into a gap by Denis Betts then outpacing Australian fullback Brett Mullins to score in the corner. Davies was also a solid last line of defence, repelling many breaks by the Kangaroos, until he dived on a loose ball close to his line and was fallen on by teammate Barrie McDermott, resulting a dislocated shoulder midway through the second half saw him leave the field and later be ruled him out for the rest of the series as well as Wales' game against the Kangaroos before the second Ashes test.", "|IC ||15|| Barrie McDermott", "Great Britain coach Ellery Hanley made a number of changes for the third test. In the press before the game there was speculation that Hanley would actually play Phil Clarke at five-eighth and himself at lock, though most were questioning why the man who sparked the Lions in the second test, former captain Garry Schofield, wasn't in the starting side (it was rumoured that personal differences between Leeds teammates Hanley and Schofield dating back to Schofield retaining the Lions captaincy over Hanley for the 1992 World Cup Final is what kept Schofield not only out of the first test team, but on the Lions bench for the final two games). The Lions changes for the decider were: Graham Steadman was dropped and Gary Connolly moved from the centres to his preferred fullback with Paul Newlove moving from the bench to replace Connolly in the centres. Shaun Edwards returned from suspension to captain the side, demoting Bobby Goulding to the bench. Phil Clarke did play 5/8 with Darryl Powell moved to the bench, Chris Joynt from the front row to lock and prop Barrie McDermott into the run on side while pacey St. Helens back rower Sonny Nickle came into the team on the bench replacing Mick Cassidy. Kangaroos coach Bob Fulton made just one change to the side that had comprehensively won the second test with David Fairleigh coming onto the bench for his second test to replace 20 test veteran Paul Sironen. Fairleigh had originally been chosen over Sironen for the second test but had fallen ill on the day of the game which saw the giant Balmain forward brought back into the side.", "|PR ||10|| Barrie McDermott"]}, {"page": "Super League Dream Team", "response": ["| Barrie McDermott"]}]}}
