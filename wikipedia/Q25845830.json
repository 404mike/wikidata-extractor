He was MP for the pocket borough of Winchelsea, between 1792 and 1794, the borough of Carlisle, between 1796 and 1802, and again for Winchelsea, between 1806 and 1807.  Sir Frederick was the 2nd Baronet of Hutton and a descendant of Sir Henry Vane the Elder.  In 1788 he served as High Sheriff of Cumberland.In the words of his grandson, Sir Frederick Fletcher Vane \u2018was not without the faults and passion of youth\u2019. He has also been described as a \u2018colourful and difficult character\u2019.  Notwithstanding the last remark, expressed after Sir Frederick's death, his character and personality while alive were interesting enough to see him successfully proposed for membership of Brooks's in 1796 by the Whig politician and wit, Charles James Fox, Brooks's being a club where the Prince of Wales was a member.  Sir Frederick joined the Whig Club on 11 April 1797 and, in 1798, Coleridge and Wordsworth made use of Sir Frederick's library at Hutton.  Bobus Smith was the inspiration behind the Whig Club and would later be a trustee on the resettlement of the Fletcher-Vane estates ahead of the marriage in 1823 of Sir Frederick's son, Francis, to Diana Beauclerk, the granddaughter of Topham Beauclerk and Lady Diana Beauclerk.Sir Frederick changed his surname to Fletcher Vane in 1790.  He was the father of Sir Francis Fletcher-Vane, 3rd Baronet, and the grandfather of both Sir Henry Fletcher-Vane, 4th Baronet, and Sir Francis Fletcher-Vane, 5th Baronet.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "James Lowther (1753\u20131837)", "response": ["James, however, took a more active role in the service of his fourth cousin, James Lowther, 1st Earl of Lonsdale.
