After retiring as an actor, he became a producer and distributor of short films. He won an Academy Award for Best Short Film in 1956 for the film The Bespoke Overcoat.He was born in Littlehampton, Sussex and died in New York City.

He associated with artistic and theatrical circles, befriending composer John Cage and his lover Don Sample, with the former getting Hay to perform vocals at one of his concerts in November 1932.  Becoming a professional voice actor, he obtained a minor role in a radio adaptation of Charles Dickens' A Tale of Two Cities performed by George K. Arthur's International Group Players for the Hollywood Playhouse. They were impressed with his talent, and gave him a job as a permanent understudy. He supplemented this income as a screen extra, usually as a stunt rider in B movies, and also worked as a freelance dialogue coach for expat aristocrats in Hollywood.Hay/Roscoe, p. 356 Through a friendship with George Oppenheimer he was able to get work screen-writing as a ghost-writer. Immersing himself in the Hollywood gay scene, he claimed to have had brief flings with Willy Wakewell, Philip Ahn, Hans Heinrich von Twardowski, and Richard Cromwell.

Arthur to form the successful comedy duo Dane & Arthur. They appeared in a number of silent, short comedy films and toured the vaudeville circuit. At the peak of his career, Dane earned $1500 a week. As the film industry transitioned from silent to sound films in the late 1920s, Dane's thick Danish accent became problematic. By 1930, Dane was relegated to less prominent roles, often with little to no dialogue. Later that year, MGM terminated his contract.  Dane attempted to pursue work in other fields but found no success. Broke and despondent, he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in April 1934.", "Soon after signing his MGM contract, Dane began work on the Vidor film, Bardelys the Magnificent. It was on this film that MGM executive Harry Rapf decided to team Dane with English actor George K. Arthur as a comedic duo. Together they were dubbed Dane & Arthur. In May 1927, the duo's first film, Rookies, opened and was an instant success. In June 1927, MGM signed Dane to a long-term contract, making such films as Detectives, Circus Rookies, and The Trail of '98.  In April 1928, Dane broke his shoulder on set.  He developed a serious case of bronchial pneumonia but eventually recovered and went back to work on the duo's films. At the peak of his success and popularity, Dane earned $1500 a week.", "Dane & Arthur's last silent short was Detectives in 1928. On 23 December 1928 their first talkie, Brotherly Love was released. By this time, sound films were rising in popularity and MGM was worried that actors with thick foreign accents would not be ideal for sound films. In his memoirs, George K. Arthur claimed that after MGM tested the duo for sound films, they felt his British accent was \"more desirable\" and thought Dane's thick Danish accent made his English difficult for audiences to understand. As a result, MGM began offering Dane fewer roles.Petersen Balogh 2009 p.149 Dane & Arthur made only six more talkies, ending with China Bound in 1929.", "In 1933, Dane began working as a waiter in a \"tiny cafe\" in Westwood, Los Angeles. According to Dane's biographer, Laura Petersen Balough, oft told accounts that Dane \"bought stake in a hot dog stand outside the gates of MGM Studios\" which was supposedly shunned by his former co-workers are likely false. The \"hot dog stand\" or \"hot dog cart\" that is often referred to was actually similar to a luncheonette, a small, permanent structure that had a counter and seating for patrons. Dane eventually bought a stake in the cafe after the owner thought that having a former film star as a co-owner would drum up business.Petersen Balogh 2009 pp.163-164 Dane's former comedy partner, George K.
