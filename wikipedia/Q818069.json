He was a senior lecturer in the School of Sport and Exercise Sciences at Liverpool John Moores University (LJMU) and is a visiting fellow at the University of Buckingham.Peiser established the Cambridge Conference Network in 1997. Peiser acknowledges that he is \"not a climate scientist\" and has \"never claimed to be one\". His interest as a social anthropologist, is in \"how climate change is portrayed as a potential disaster and how we respond to that\".As an outspoken climate change denier, Peiser became director of the newly established UK lobbying group Global Warming Policy Foundation in 2009. He serves as co-editor of the journal, Energy & Environment and is a regular contributor to Canada's National Post.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Attribution of recent climate change", "response": ["Than (2007) pointed to the view of Benny Peiser, a social anthropologist at Liverpool John Moores University in the UK.

These included Neptune's moon Triton,See also:  Jupiter,See also:  PlutoSee also:  and Mars. In an e-mail interview with Than (2007), Peiser stated that:\"I think it is an intriguing coincidence that warming trends have been observed on a number of very diverse planetary bodies in our solar system, (...) Perhaps this is just a fluke.\"Than (2007) provided alternative explanations of why warming had occurred on Triton, Pluto, Jupiter and Mars."]}, {"page": "Easter Island", "response": ["Benny Peiser noted evidence of self-sufficiency when Europeans first arrived. The island still had smaller trees, mainly toromiro, which became extinct in the wild in the 20th century probably because of slow growth and changes in the island's ecosystem. Cornelis Bouman, Jakob Roggeveen's captain, stated in his logbook, \"... of yams, bananas and small coconut palms we saw little and no other trees or crops.\" According to Carl Friedrich Behrens, Roggeveen's officer, \"The natives presented palm branches as peace offerings.\" According to ethnographer Alfred M\u00e8traux, the most common type of house was called \"hare paenga\" (and is known today as \"boathouse\") because the roof resembled an overturned boat. The foundations of the houses were made of buried basalt slabs with holes for wooden beams to connect with each other throughout the width of the house. These were then covered with a layer of totora reed, followed by a layer of woven sugarcane leaves, and lastly a layer of woven grass."]}, {"page": "Cambridge Conference Network", "response": ["#REDIRECT Benny Peiser#Cambridge Conference Network"]}, {"page": "John Houghton (physicist)", "response": ["In a November 2006 article in Australia's The Daily Telegraph, journalist Piers Akerman quoted Houghton as saying \"Unless we announce disasters, no one will listen\", attributing the quotation to his 1994 book Global Warming, The Complete Briefing.
