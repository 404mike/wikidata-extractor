Herself a highly educated woman, Makin was referred to as England's most learned lady, skilled in Greek, Latin, Hebrew, German, Spanish, French and Italian. Makin argued primarily for the equal right of women and girls to obtain an education in an environment or culture that viewed woman as the weaker vessel, subordinated to man and uneducable. She is most famously known for her polemical treatise entitled An Essay to Revive the Ancient Education of Gentlewomen, in Religion, Manners, Arts & Tongues, with an Answer to the Objections against this Way of Education (1673).\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle-upon-Tyne", "response": ["On her scientific pursuits, she was belittled by the Royal Society, which excluded women from its ranks; Margaret Cavendish was the first female to be invited, and not until 1667 was she inducted as its first female member. One member, John Evelyn, saw in Cavendish \"a mighty pretender to learning, poetry, and philosophy\". Another, Robert Boyle, took many of the experiments shown by Cavendish to be trifles, disparaging her tendency to measure things by \"strangeness\" and \"prettiness\", as opposed to \"use\". Yet her knowledge was recognised by some, such as the protofeminist Bathsua Makin: \"The present Dutchess of New-Castle, by her own Genius, rather than any timely Instruction, over-tops many grave Gown-Men.\" She saw her exemplifying what women could become through education. New manuscript evidence also suggests she was read and taken seriously by at least some early Royal Society members, such as its Secretary, Nehemiah Grew."]}, {"page": "1673 in literature", "response": ["*Bathsua Makin \u2013 An Essay to Revive the Ancient Education of Gentlewomen"]}, {"page": "John Pell", "response": ["He was born at Southwick in Sussex.

By the time he was six, they were orphans, their father dying in 1616 and their mother the following year. John Pell the elder had a fine library, which proved valuable to the young Pell as he grew up. He was educated at Steyning Grammar School and entered Trinity College, Cambridge, at the age of 13. During his university career he became an accomplished linguist; even before taking a B.A. degree in 1629, he corresponded with Henry Briggs and other mathematicians. He was promoted by seniority to M.A. in 1630 and taught in the short-lived Chichester Academy set up by Samuel Hartlib.Malcolm and Stedall, p. 29. On 3 July 1632 he married Ithamaria Reginald (also rendered as Ithamara or Ithumaria, with the surname Reginolles), sister of the writer and polymath Bathsua Makin.Malcolm and Stedall, p. 69.

After his mother's death his father remarried the widowed Elizabeth Isham, Lady Denton, who was only a few years older than her stepson: Simonds approved of the marriage and may have played a part in arranging it.

At Bury St Edmunds, he wrote 2,850 verses of poetry in Greek and Latin.Simmons, Tracy Lee. Climbing Parnassus:pg. 122. ISI Books, 2002.

Spender, ed., Feminist Theories, p. 29. Astell and Aphra Behn together laid the groundwork for feminist theory in the 17th century. No woman would speak out as strongly again for another century.
