His face is always covered by the hood, but he also wears really tight costume that emphasizes the size of his muscles and crotch. He has poor intelligence, as shown when Lord Farquaad is deciding between three princesses and Thelonious says \"Three! Pick number three, my lord\" while holding up two fingers. He's later seen at Fiona and Farquaad's wedding and it is possible that he isn't really a villain, because when they kiss, he wrote \"Aawww\" on one of the signs that are telling people how should they react to different situations. He's also seen in the ending, at Shrek and Fiona's wedding, when he helps to play the music organ.
