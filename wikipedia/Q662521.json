After fighting an energetic campaign in Hemel Hempstead in the 1950 general election, he was elected as the first Member of Parliament for Meriden in 1955. As a backbencher he had a low profile but managed some achievements in House of Commons committees. Moss lost the highly marginal constituency after a single term and was forced to return to his previous career. He died many years later in obscurity.", "link_mentions": {}}}
