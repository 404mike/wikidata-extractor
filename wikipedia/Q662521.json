After fighting an energetic campaign in Hemel Hempstead in the 1950 general election, he was elected as the first Member of Parliament for Meriden in 1955. As a backbencher he had a low profile but managed some achievements in House of Commons committees. Moss lost the highly marginal constituency after a single term and was forced to return to his previous career. He died many years later in obscurity.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Meriden (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Reg Moss"]}, {"page": "Reginald Moss", "response": ["* Reg Moss (1913\u20131995), Labour Member of Parliament for Meriden 1955-1959"]}, {"page": "Reginald Moss (UK politician)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Reg Moss"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom MPs who died in the 1990s", "response": ["|Reg Moss"]}]}}
