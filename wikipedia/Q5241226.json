The book explains why the football players of the Netherlands play beautifully but lose their most important matches. Winner connects football to other elements of Dutch life and culture, such as their flat flooding-prone land, unusual taste in art, and their experiences in World War 2.\nAround the World in 90 Minutes (plus extra time and penalties) (2007) was based on his journey to 13 countries during the four weeks of the 2006 World Cup.\nHis quirky travel book Al Dente: Madness, Beauty & the Food of Rome (2012) was described by Pen Vogler in The Observer, [Sunday 11 March 2012] as being \"like a fusion of Coleridge's Table Talk and Marinetti's The Futurist Cookbook, peopled with eccentric film-makers, anorexic saints and wafer-making nuns\".He recently wrote a biography of footballer Dennis Bergkamp, co-written with Jaap Visser, and based on interviews with Bergkamp. The English edition, \"Dennis Bergkamp, Stillness and Speed\", was long-listed for the William Hill Sports Book of the Year 2013.  The Dutch edition, published by Uitgeverij Carrera, is entitled \"Dennis Bergkamp: de biografie\". \nHe most recently was the ghostwriter of Rio Ferdinand's 2014 autobiography #2Sides.Winner also co-wrote The Coming of The Greens (1988) (with Jonathon Porritt), a study of environmentalism in the United Kingdom and biographies for children of Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Raoul Wallenberg, Peter Benenson (founder of Amnesty International) and Eleanor Roosevelt.\nTogether with Lex van Dam he translated a book about Johan Cruyff, The Netherlands best-ever footballer titled Ajax, Barcelona, Cruyff, The ABC of an Obstinate Maestro by Frits Barend and Henk van Dorp.\nWinner supports Arsenal football club.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Kilburn, London", "response": ["*David Winner, author"]}, {"page": "Gerd M\u00fcller", "response": ["In his book, Brilliant Orange: The Neurotic Genius of Dutch Football, author David Winner writes, \"M\u00fcller was short, squat, awkward-looking and not notably fast; he never fitted the conventional idea of a great footballer, but he had lethal acceleration over short distances, a remarkable aerial game, and uncanny goalscoring instincts. His short legs gave him a low center of gravity, so he could turn quickly and with perfect balance in spaces and at speeds that would cause other players to fall over.

Both clubs settled on a transfer fee of \u01922.5\u00a0million, after Ajax's initial bid of \u01921.5\u00a0million was rejected. Manager Louis van Gaal was very fond of Overmars beforehand and described him as a \"multi-functional player\". Overmars' debut came in a 3\u20130 win against Dordrecht on 16 August 1992. His first goal for Ajax was away to RKC Waalwijk in October and he scored a further seven goals in the 1992\u201393 season. Several teams chose to combat Overmars' threat with heavy tackles; he detested this, adding, \"I do not fall on purpose, but if they keep kicking, I would sometimes give something back in return.\" Ajax finished the campaign third in the league; their form in the final few months was described as \"maddening\" by football writer David Winner, as they defeated eventual champions Feyenoord by five goals, but dropped points to \"minnows like MVV Maastricht\".

Writer David Winner claimed in the New York Times that he was \"a wonderfully agile 'line keeper,' a shot stopper of the old school\".

The British network, Channel Four, transmitted the film during the Channel's third night on air in November 1982. It generated front-page news in Britain at the time because Channel 4 broadcast a two-hour version of the film shorn of seven minutes of its concluding sequence. The original 136 minute film released in cinemas had been approved with a 'AA' certificate and no cuts by the BBFC, but the Independent Broadcasting Authority instructed Channel 4 that certain scenes in the film could 'incite crime or lead to civil disorder.'British Film Institute, The Animals Film booklet, 2008, p. 8-9 Jonathon Porritt and David Winner write that, with over one million viewers, the screening is regarded as \"an important moment in the growth of public awareness of animal exploitation.\"Porritt and Winner 1988, cited in Garner, Robert.

The national team never lost a match in which Cruyff scored. On 7 September 1966, he made his official debut for the Netherlands in the UEFA Euro 1968 qualifier against Hungary, scoring in the 2\u20132 draw. In his second match, a friendly against Czechoslovakia, Cruyff was the first Dutch international to receive a red card. The Royal Dutch Football Association (KNVB) banned him from Internationals games but not Eredivise or KNVB Cup games.David Winner (2012). \"Brilliant Orange: The Neurotic Genius of Dutch Football\". A&C Black", "Cruyff always considered aesthetic and moral aspects of the game; it is not just about winning, but about winning with \"right\" style/way. He also always spoke highly of entertaining value of the game. The beautiful game, for him, is about as much the entertainment and joy as the results. In thinking of Cruyff, the victory is truly meaningful when it can fully capture the minds and hearts of competitors and spectators. As he once noted, \"Quality without results is pointless. Results without quality is boring,\". For Cruyff and the Cruyffistas (Cruyff's devout followers), to choose a \"right\" style of play to win is even more important than winning itself.In Cruyff's words, quoted in David Winner's book Brilliant Orange: \"There is no medal better than being acclaimed for your style. As a coach, my teams might have won more games if we'd played in a less adventurous way. Maybe I'd have earned a little more and the bonuses would have been bigger, but if people say that Barcelona were playing the nicest football in the world with me as coach, what more can I ask for? If you're appearing in the World Cup final it may be the biggest occasion of your life, so why be sad and fearful? Be happy, express yourself and play. Make it special for you and for everyone watching. For the good of football, we need a team of invention, attacking ideas and style to emerge. Even if it doesn't win, it will inspire footballers of all ages everywhere. That is the greatest reward.\" Cruyff always believed in simplicity. He sees simplicity and beauty as inseparable. \"Simple football is the most beautiful. But playing simple football is the hardest thing\", as Cruyff once summed up his fundamental philosophy. \"How often do you see a pass of forty meters when twenty meters is enough?... To play well, you need good players, but a good player almost always has the problem of a lack of efficiency. He always wants to do things prettier than strictly necessary.\" Cruyff also perfected a feint now known as the \"Cruyff Turn\".\"World Cup: 25 stunning moments \u2026 No25: the Cruyff Turn is born in 1974\". The Guardian. Retrieved 11 June 2014. The feint is an example of the simplicity in Cruyff's football philosophy. It was neither carried out to embarrass the opponent nor to excite the watching crowd, but because Cruyff estimated that it was the simplest method (in terms of effort and risk versus expected result) to beat his opponent. Cruyff looked to pass or cross the ball, then, instead of kicking it, he dragged the ball behind his planted foot with the inside of his other foot, turned through 180 degrees, and accelerated away.Top World Cup moments No8 \u2013 The Cruyff turn makes its debut (1974), tntmagazine.com; accessed 24 October 2015. As Swedish defender Jan Olsson (a \"victim\" of the Cruyff Turn at the 1974 World Cup) recalled, \"I played 18 years in top football and seventeen times for Sweden but that moment against Cruyff was the proudest moment of my career. I thought I'd win the ball for sure, but he tricked me. I was not humiliated. I had no chance. Cruyff was a genius.\"\"All-time Top 20: No. 3 Johan Cruyff\", espnfc.com; retrieved 17 November 2013. With its high effectiveness and unpredictability, the Cruyff Turn remains one of the most commonly used dribbling moves in modern football.", "Cruyff is widely seen as an iconic and revolutionary figure in history of Ajax, Bar\u00e7a, and the Oranje. David Winner, the author of Brilliant Orange, wrote about Cruyff's influential career in the football world, \"There have been lots of brilliant football figures down the years, but none has been as significant as Johan Cruyff. As a player with Ajax, Barcelona and the Netherlands, he put himself in the pantheon along with greats such as Pel\u00e9, Diego Maradona, Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s, Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo and Zinedine Zidane. As coach at Ajax and Barcelona, he built thrilling sides, nurtured a remarkable number of genius players and influenced many of the most important teams in the world. The all-conquering Spain and Barcelona of Xavi and Andr\u00e9s Iniesta, brilliant Bayern Munich and Germany of today, AC Milan of the late 1980s and many other memorable champions would have been unthinkable without Cruyff. Once radical and revolutionary, Cruyffian principles have become standard throughout the modern game. His blueprint for developing young players has been copied all over the world.\"", "Cruyff is sometimes described as a typical kind of 'artist-footballer'\"Johan Cruyff was the first player who understood he was an artist, and the first who was able and willing to collectivise the art of sport\", says journalist Hubert Smeets in David Winner's Brilliant Orange: The Neurotic Genius of Dutch Football. or 'footballer-thinker' who considers football, the so-called 'beautiful game', not a purely athletic/physical competition but an artistic-oriented mind-body game. Because of his distinctive footballing views, Cruyff was called 'the Spinoza of football' by some. He believed in a certain style of play, which has the power to put a smile on the people's faces as he described it. When Cruyff, both as a player and as a manager, spoke about football he often mentioned the entertainment value of the game, that there is more to it than winning.One of Cruyff's devoted disciples, Pep Guardiola, in January 2016 when still manager of Bayern Munich, said that he cares more about style of play than silverware, \"I would rather be remembered for the football my teams play than for the trophies I won\", adding that \"in the end, titles are nothing but numbers and numbers are boring.\" In a 2009 interview with Sportmail's Martin Samuel, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, as a devout follower of Cruyff's footballing ideology, once shared his opinion about football's artistic value,", "Regarded by many as Europe's first true football superstar, Cruyff is often mentioned alongside the pair widely considered the finest to have played the game, Pele and Maradona. As a player, he greatly helped turn the previously backward and obscure Dutch football (at both club and international level) into a world-class powerhouse in the 1970s.In the article The Church of Cruyff: Forever Spreading the Football Gospel (8 March 2016), David Winner writes about the state of Dutch football until the mid-1960s, \"the Netherlands was a third-rate footballing nation, its tactics and facilities stuck in the 1930s. Yet within a decade, the club and country had become the most important and admired in the world. Cruyff was the man who made it happen.\" In Simon Kuper's words, \"without Cruyff, Holland [Netherlands] wouldn't have had a footballing tradition.\" Cruyff is always considered to be an indisputable icon in Ajax's history, especially in the club's golden era (1966\u20131973). He was instrumental in Ajax's transformation from a semi-professional club into a dominant force in European club football. Cruyff inspired Ajax to win the European Cup three times in succession at the beginning of the 1970s before moving to Barcelona in 1973 and helping the club win their first La Liga title in 14 years. In 1974, he led the Netherlands to their first FIFA World Cup final and received the Golden Ball as player of the tournament.", "The Germany national team that won the 2014 World Cup had deep Cruyffian (via Pep Guardiola) influences. After leaving Barcelona, Guardiola implanted the Cruyffian vision at Bayern Munich. Germany and Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, who completed more passes at the 2014 World Cup than Argentina's Lionel Messi did, incarnates the goalkeeper whom Cruyff dreamt up in the 1960s and 1970s: A footballer in gloves.In the article The Church of Cruyff: Forever Spreading the Football Gospel (8 March 2016), David Winner writes, \"Cruyff invented the sweeper-keeper. In old football, a goalkeeper's job was to stay on his line and stop shots. But in the run-up to the 1974 World Cup, Cruyff persuaded Michels to pick Jan Jongbloed, a goalkeeper who liked to roam far from his line and was unusually good with his feet. His style, now routinely copied by goalkeepers around the world, allowed the Netherlands to press even higher up the field.\" It had always bothered Cruyff that goalkeepers just stopped shots. He thought it was a waste of a player. As Cruyff once said, \"In my teams, the goalie (goalkeeper) is the first attacker and the striker the first defender.\" He wanted a goalkeeper who could also get involved in the passing. Thus, the goalkeeper effectively becomes the 11th player, like Edwin van der Sar at Ajax or V\u00edctor Vald\u00e9s at Barcelona.", "In 2018, Cruyff was added as an icon to the Ultimate Team in EA Sports' FIFA video game FIFA 19, receiving a 94 rating. British sportswriter David Winner's 2000 book on Dutch football, Brilliant Orange, mentions Cruyff frequently. In the book, Dutch football's ideas (in particular Cruyff's) effectively related to the use of space in Dutch painting and Dutch architecture.", "Cruyff remained a controversial figure throughout his life. His relationships with Ajax, Bar\u00e7a, and KNVB (Royal Dutch Football Association) were turbulent for some time, especially in his later years. In his native Netherlands, there was always a love\u2013hate relationship between Cruyff and his fellow countrymen. There was a long-standing feud between Cruyff and Louis van Gaal, though never confirmed publicly by both sides. He also often criticised Jos\u00e9 Mourinho for his defensive-based coaching philosophy, stated, \"Jos\u00e9 Mourinho is a negative coach. He only cares about the result and doesn't care much for good football.\" As David Winner notes, \"Cruyff has had many enemies and critics over the years.\" He has been accused of being arrogant, greedy, intolerant, despotic, \"too idealistic, too stubborn, insufficiently interested in defending and simply too difficult a personality. He loves an argument, and his conflict-model method of working can be bruising.\" And Winner concludes that, \"With his belief in the \"conflict model\" \u2013 the idea that you got the best out of people by provoking fights and thereby raising levels of excitement and adrenaline \u2013 Cruyff made enemies almost as easily as he generated delight. Battles with club presidents and teammates led to ruptures, especially at Ajax and Barcelona, the two clubs that defined his career.\"", "* Barend, Frits; Van Dorp, Henk: Ajax, Barcelona, Cruyff: The ABC of an Obstinate Maestro.
