This work enabled the development of the field of cryobiology.Hall was educated at Willaston School.He published on the reproductive effects of X-rays on mice, hormonal control of secondary sexual characteristics in birds, and aided Hilda Bruce in research that established the Bruce effect.In 1962, Parkes was awarded the Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Audrey Smith", "response": ["From 1946 to 1970, she was a researcher at the National Institute for Medical Research.

However, a subsequent freak accident\u2014Smith dropped a bottle which broke and splattered a hot plate, and the resulting odour caused her to realize that the bottle had been mislabeled\u2014led Smith to successfully experiment with glycerol in cryopreservation, and she discovered the first practical cryoprotectant molecule."]}]}}
