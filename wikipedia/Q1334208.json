However, despite this, the choice within the Council remains largely behind closed doors. During the appointment of Santer, discussions were kept in camera (private), with the media relying on insider leaks. MEPs were angry with the process, against the spirit of consultation that the new EU treaty brought in. Pauline Green MEP, leader of the Socialist group, stated that her group thought \"Parliament should refuse to condone a practice which so sullies the democratic process\". There were similar deals in 1999 and 2004 saw a repeat of Santer's appointment when Barroso was appointed through a series of secret meetings between leaders with no press releases on the negotiations being released. This was sharply criticised by MEPs such as the ALDE group leader Graham Watson who described the procedure as a \"Justus Lipsius carpet market\" producing only the \"lowest common denominator\"; while Green-EFA co-leader Daniel Cohn-Bendit asked Barroso after his first speech \"If you are the best candidate, why were you not the first?\""]}, {"page": "Somerset", "response": ["From 1994 to 1999, Somerset was represented by Liberal Democrat Graham Watson as part of the Somerset and North Devon constituency for elections to the European Parliament."]}, {"page": "Liberal International", "response": ["The Liberal International Medal of Liberalism is awarded to individuals who have worked to advance liberal values on a local, national and international level.
