Gradually, with the almost total demise of wingers, Paine took his passing proficiencies into midfield and his dextrous distribution was partially instrumental in the launching of Mick Channon's rise to prominence. Steering clear of serious injury in a remarkable way, Paine was often guilty of committing petty fouls and any games missed were usually the result of suspensions arising from such indiscretions."]}, {"page": "Martin Chivers", "response": ["In the 1965\u201366 season, he played an integral role as the club finally gained promotion to the top flight (as runners-up), scoring 30 goals from 39 games, generally from crosses provided by Terry Paine and John Sydenham. All his goals were scored from the first 29 games, and he failed to find the net after the end of February."]}, {"page": "Paul Bennett (footballer, born 1952)", "response": ["In 1998, he helped organise the celebrations for Ted Bates first 60 seasons at The Dell, with a testimonial including several former Saints players such as Terry Paine, Ron Davies, John Sydenham and Tony Knapp."]}, {"page": "Tommy Jenkins", "response": ["He made his debut for Southampton at home to Nottingham Forest on 13 December 1969, where he took the place of long-time club servant, John Sydenham, on the left-wing. At his best, Jenkins was a high-class winger with great speed, dazzling trickery and the ability to beat several defenders in one run, but would exasperate his fans by dribbling himself into trouble rather than release the ball to a teammate. He was never a prolific goal-scorer, but one memorable moment came on 31 August 1970 at Upton Park, where his run took him past four West Ham players before shooting past Hammers' goalkeeper Peter Grotier. He never realised his full potential at Southampton and was sold to Swindon Town in November 1972, having made a total of 96 appearances for Southampton, scoring six goals."]}, {"page": "Norman Dean", "response": ["He was a valuable member of the team, alongside Terry Paine, John Sydenham and Martin Chivers that gained Southampton promotion from League Division 2 in 1965\u201366, scoring 11 goals in 18 appearances, including a hat-trick against local rivals, Portsmouth on 5 February 1966.

He turned professional in October 1960 and made his first-team debut on 4 November 1961, at home to Bristol Rovers in place of the injured Terry Paine. His six years at the Dell were spent in the shadow of Paine and John Sydenham and as a result he only made 25 league appearances for The Saints, in which he scored once.* In July 1966 he moved to Middlesbrough, costing the Ayresome Park side \u00a310,000, and slotted straight into the side, making his Boro debut on 20 August against Colchester United."]}, {"page": "David Burnside (footballer)", "response": ["In September 1962, Ted Bates signed him for Second Division Southampton for a fee of \u00a318,000, making him Bates's third signing in 10 days (along with George Kirby and Stuart Williams). Burnside immediately became a fixture in the Saints side, alongside Terry Paine and John Sydenham on the wings and Kirby and George O'Brien in attack.

Paine's fitness was such, however, that he never missed a match in the one season that Harrison spent at The Dell. Harrison's three appearances for the \"Saints\" came in October, when Paine switched first to the left to replace the injured John Sydenham, and then to inside right in place of George O'Brien. Harrison's first and last matches were both against Barnsley. The second match was at home to Swindon Town when Derek Reeves scored four, with one from Paine, in a 5\u20131 victory on 10 October 1959.
