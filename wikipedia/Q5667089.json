He played for the Derbyshire Colt's team in 1880. His first-class career with Derbyshire began in the 1887 season when, as a 28-year-old, he played against Marylebone Cricket Club. Derbyshire lost first-class status in the 1888 season, but Bagshaw continued to  take part in matches between future first-class sides and Derbyshire and was top scorer for the club in the 1892 and 1893 seasons. Derbyshire's matches were accorded first-class status again in the 1894 season Bagshaw took part in his first County Championship match when Derbyshire joined the Championship in the 1895 season.  He played consistently during the season, and had a top-score of 127 not out against Yorkshire, the highest of his career. During his time at Derbyshire he was an opening or number 3 batsman. In the 1896 season he scored 115 against Yorkshire and 121 against Leicestershire. He scored three centuries in 1897 - 124 against Leicestershire, 114 not out against Surrey and 105 against Hampshire. In the 1898 season he scored 100 not out against Yorkshire. \n\nIn the 1899 season, Bagshaw's bowling came to the fore when he took 5 for 18 against Nottinghamshire. In the 1900 season he took 34 wickets and against Hampshire bowled 5 for 27.\nBagshaw was a left-handed batsman and played 218 innings in 125 first-class matches with an average of 26.10 and a top score of 127 not out. He scored 7 centuries in making over 5000 runs. He was a right-arm medium-pace bowler and took 73 first-class wickets at an average of 29.02 and a best performance of 5 for 18.Between 1907 and 1923 he was a first-class umpire in England, taking charge of over 200 matches.\nBagshaw died at Crowden, near Glossop, and was buried at St Lawrence's Church, Eyam. His tall headstone has at the apex a hand with a finger pointing upwards. Underneath the lettering is a set of stumps, with the bails flying off and a bat which has just hit the wicket.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Eyam", "response": ["Catherine Mompesson's tabletop grave is in the churchyard and has a wreath laid on it every Plague Sunday. This is in remembrance of her constancy in staying by her husband, rather than moving away with the rest of her family, and dying in the very last days of the plague. The church's burial register also records \"Anna the traveller, who according to her own account, was 136 years of age\" and was interred on 30 December 1663. A more recent arrival there is the cricketer Harry Bagshaw, who played for Derbyshire and then acted as a respected umpire after retiring.

They were John Hulme who took over 550 wickets for Derbyshre and Bill Storer who was one of the club's long-serving wicket-keepers.  Harry Bagshaw who also made his debut gave the club many years service. Other players who made their debut were George Ratcliffe, Joseph Marshall,  Henry Street and William Walton. None of these had the chance to play first class cricket for Derbyshire again although some appeared occasionally for the club in the intervening years."]}, {"page": "Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1892", "response": ["Derbyshire played thirteen games, and all except for Cheshire were against sides that they had played in first class matches before 1888 or that joined the County Championship four years later.

Derbyshire played an interesting turn-around match against Leicestershire. Derbyshire had to follow on at 100 behind and made 423 in the second innings with centuries by Evershed and Davidson. Leicestershire were all out for 98 with Hulme taking five wickets for three runs."]}, {"page": "Bagshaw (surname)", "response": ["*Harry Bagshaw (1859\u20131927), English cricketer"]}]}}
