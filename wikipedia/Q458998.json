He made a scoring first-team debut in March 2008 when he netted the winner against Blackburn Rovers after coming on as a second-half substitute. Sears made over 50 first-team appearances for West Ham, but never held down a regular starting position.\nSears had loan spells with Crystal Palace, Coventry City and Scunthorpe United, before joining Colchester United for the latter half of the 2011\u201312 season. He scored two goals in 11 appearances for the U's, prompting the club to sign him on a permanent basis from the Hammers in July 2012. After joining the Essex club, Sears rediscovered his scoring form, scoring 34 goals in 99 games in his two-and-a-half year stay before departing for Ipswich. Sears has also represented England at under-19, under-20 and under-21 levels.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "November 27", "response": ["*  1989   \u2013 Freddie Sears, English footballer"]}, {"page": "Clinton Morrison", "response": ["Morrison went on to make his debut for the U's in a 3\u20130 League Cup defeat away at Yeovil Town, before leading the line to begin the new Football League season four days later in a 0\u20130 draw at Deepdale against Preston North End. His first goal for Colchester arrived towards the end of August in the third game of the season, as his late equaliser salvaged a 1\u20131 draw for the U's; their third successive draw to start the season. He celebrated the goal by running the length of the pitch with his hands cupped behind his ears to taunt the Sheffield United fans who, throughout the game, had been doing likewise to the striker for his connections with their city rivals, Wednesday. Joe Dunne took over as the U's boss at the end of September and immediately brought in Jabo Ibehre on loan from Milton Keynes Dons, with the loanee displacing Morrison from the starting eleven and consigning him to the bench.  Dunne's fourth game in charge was a Football League Trophy defeat to Northampton Town where Morrison was handed a start, but he was dismissed for violent conduct in the closing stages of the game which would suspend the striker for three matches after the club decided against appealing his ban. The impressive form of Ibehre ensured that Morrison only started four more games for the U's until March, when injury to Freddie Sears created a hole in attack. This was coupled with Ibehre receiving a three-match suspension and Morrison went on to spearhead the U's attack once more, providing crucial experience in Colchester's bid for League One survival. In his fourth successive start, he notched his second U's goal in a 2\u20131 win away at Bury; a vital match-winning goal in a crunch relegation fixture. The club went on secure safety on the final day of the season with a 2\u20130 win at Carlisle United finishing in 20th place. At the end of the 2012\u201313 season, Morrison went on to make thirty\u2013five appearances and scoring two times in all competitions."]}, {"page": "Tal Ben Haim", "response": ["On 24 August 2010, Ben Haim played his first game for West Ham, against Oxford United in the League Cup, in a 1\u20130 victory and made his league debut for the club in a 3\u20131 loss against his former club Chelsea on 11 September 2010. On 1 January 2011 assisted Freddie Sears to score in a 2\u20130 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers. Four days later on 5 January 2011 he played for West Ham as they lost 5\u20130 to Newcastle United. This turned out his last appearance for West Ham. Despite his loan spell at West Ham having ended, the club continued talks with Portsmouth regarding a deal to bring Ben Haim back; the two clubs could not come to an agreement, while financial issues prevented him from linking up with Pompey."]}, {"page": "Penn FC", "response": ["In 2009, the City Islanders played Crystal Palace F.C. of the Football League Championship, England's second division, at Lancaster's Clipper Magazine Stadium.

He found his shooting boots on his second debut for the Essex club when he opened the scoring in a 2\u20130 win against his former employers Walsall on 26 January, a result that handed Colchester their first points for nine games. He scored both goals in a 2\u20130 win on the road at Stevenage on 2 March which helped move the club out of the relegation zone. Manager Joe Dunne heaped praise on Ibehre following the result, describing him as \"a handful for everybody\" and said that \"when Jabo plays well, we generally play well\". He was sent off for serious foul play in a 0\u20130 draw with Hartlepool on 5 March, ruling him out for three games through suspension. Ibehre, upset with the decision, claimed that he got the ball and hoped to have the red card rescinded. The club decided not to appeal, and Ibehre returned to action in late March. He scored his final goal of the season on 13 April, Colchester's only goal in a 3\u20131 defeat to Notts County. He made 16 appearances in addition to the 15 he had made for the club earlier in the season, as well as four goals to bring his tally to eight for the season.

By 15 December, West Ham's league position saw no improvement and Grant was handed an unusual ultimatum: win one of the next three games or face the sack. These fixtures included an away game at Blackburn (drawn), another away game at Fulham (won) and a home game against Everton (drawn). Christmas saw West Ham at the bottom of the table, hoping to reverse the \"curse of Christmas,\" where the team in that position is relegated at the end of the season. On 26 December, West Ham finally earned an away win in their 28th game since its last away victory; a 3\u20131 win at Craven Cottage against Fulham saw two goals by Carlton Cole and one from Piquionne. It marked the first time Cole scored two goals in a Premier League game. 1 January saw West Ham lift themselves out of the relegation zone and into 15th place with a 2\u20130 New Year's Day win over Wolves, with Freddie Sears scoring his first goal since March 2008. Still believing the problems lie with the defence, on 12 January Wayne Bridge signed on loan from Manchester City until the end of the season.
