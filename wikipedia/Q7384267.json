Lynch was released by Coventry at the end of the 2006\u201307 season.\nHe then had a trial with Crewe Alexandra, after which Lynch signed a 1-year contract in July 2007. Despite this, Lynch only managed to make two league appearances for Crewe Alexandra. He was loaned out to Stafford Rangers and Altrincham during the second half of the 2007\u201308 season. After finishing his loan at Altrincham, Lynch was released by Crewe in May 2008.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2006\u201307 Coventry City F.C. season", "response": ["| Ryan Lynch || Tamworth || 22 March 2007 || 28 April 2007"]}, {"page": "2007\u201308 Coventry City F.C. season", "response": ["| Ryan Lynch || Crewe Alexandra || 17 August 2007 || Free"]}, {"page": "Ryan Lynch", "response": ["Ryan Lynch may refer to:", "*Ryan Lynch (footballer) (born 1987), English football player", "*Ryan Lynch (politician), American politician", "*Ryan Lynch (racing driver) (born 1986), American race car driver"]}]}}
