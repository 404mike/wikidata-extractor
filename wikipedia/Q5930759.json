Although not a regular first team player, he was selected for a Texaco Cup match at Ibrox against Rangers on 18 September 1974, and scored the third goal, a tap in from inside the box. It was not until November 1974 that he again had a long spell in the Southampton first team (now in the Second Division) with a run of fifteen games, this time replacing Paul Gilchrist. He scored his second league goal with a header against Cardiff City on 22 April 1975. He retained his place for the start of the following season, but then lost his place to his good friend and fellow Glaswegian, Hugh Fisher. His only involvement for the rest of the season was as a substitute, including appearances in the FA Cup fourth and fifth round matches against Blackpool and West Bromwich Albion."]}, {"page": "Hugh Fisher (Footballer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Hugh Fisher (footballer) "]}]}}
