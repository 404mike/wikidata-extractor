He won 27 caps for Wales, 18 as captain, and critics consider him the first superstar of Welsh rugby. A talented all-round player and champion sprinter, Gould could side-step and kick expertly with either foot. He never ceased practising to develop his fitness and skills, and on his death was described as \"the most accomplished player of his generation\".Following the withdrawal of their regular fullback, Newport RFC first selected Gould in 1882, when he was 18. He was never dropped from the side thereafter and played regularly until he retired in 1898. Gould played for Newport during their \"invincible\" season of 1891\u201392, when they did not lose a match, and scored a record 37 tries in Newport's 24-game 1893\u201394 season, a club record that still stands. Gould frequently travelled due to his job as a public contractor, and consequently turned out for a number of other sides during his career, including the clubs Richmond and London Welsh, and the county side Middlesex.\nGould was first selected for Wales in 1885 when he played at fullback against England. He was awarded the captaincy in 1889, by which time he was playing at centre, and led Wales to their first Home Nations Championship and Triple Crown titles in 1893; that tournament's match against England established Gould as a great player and captain. By the time Gould retired he was the most capped Welsh centre, a record he held until 1980, with 25 caps in the position. He ended his international career against England on 9 January 1897. The game, played in front of 17,000 supporters at Rodney Parade, was Gould's 18th as Wales captain \u2013 a record eventually broken by Ieuan Evans in 1994.\nTowards the end of his career, Gould was at the centre of a controversy known as the \"Gould affair\" that saw Wales withdraw from international rugby for a year. The controversy centred on the support of the Welsh Football Union (WFU) for a testimonial for Gould on his retirement. The English Rugby Football Union and International Rugby Football Board (IRFB) argued that the testimonial constituted professionalism \u2013 which they claimed breached the sport's by-laws. The WFU withdrew from the IRFB in protest, rejoining a year later under the IRFB-imposed condition that Gould would not represent Wales again. He worked as a brewery representative after retiring from rugby, and died of an internal haemorrhage in 1919 at the age of 54.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Arthur 'Monkey' Gould", "response": ["#REDIRECT Arthur Gould (rugby union)"]}, {"page": "Wales national rugby union team", "response": ["* 2007 \u2013 Arthur Gould, Phil Bennett"]}, {"page": "World Rugby Hall of Fame", "response": ["| Arthur Gould"]}, {"page": "1888\u201389 New Zealand Native football team", "response": ["The Natives next defeated both Northamptonshire and Kent, before defeats by Moseley and Burton-on-Trent. Both defeats were unexpected, and in the Moseley match, injuries played a part\u00a0\u2013 the tourists played most of the match at least two men down, as replacements were then not allowed. The team recovered to win their next game, against Midlands Counties in Birmingham. Their next fixture was against Middlesex in a match not open to the public, and hosted by the Earl of Sheffield at Sheffield Park, Uckfield. The Middlesex side contained a number of international players, including Arthur Gould. Middlesex won easily, with the Natives play characterised by poor tackling. The final score was 9\u20130, with three tries conceded by the New Zealanders. Prior to the match both sides had enjoyed lunch with wine\u00a0\u2013 an indulgence the Natives were not used to. A report in the Auckland Star had this to say of the game:", "The match was also of historical importance because of the Welsh tactics employed. In the 1886 Home Nations Championship Wales had trialled the four three-quarter system, wherein the team would play with eight forwards rather than nine, and instead employ an extra centre three-quarter. The system was deemed a failure and was particularly unpopular with star Welsh player Arthur Gould, whose formidable ability as a back allowed his club team Newport to retain the additional forward. With Gould working in the West Indies, Wales again tried the four three-quarter system against the Natives, and its success saw the team permanently adopt the system. Within six years the other three Home Countries had adopted four three-quarter style of play."]}, {"page": "Arthur Gould", "response": ["Arthur Gould may refer to:", "*Arthur Gould (rugby union) (1864\u20131919), Welsh rugby union player", "*Arthur Gould (wrestler) (1892\u20131948), British Olympic wrestler", "*Arthur Gould-Porter (1905\u20131987), British actor"]}, {"page": "Monkey gould", "response": ["#REDIRECT Arthur Gould (rugby union)"]}, {"page": "List of Wales national rugby union team records", "response": ["| Arthur Gould "]}, {"page": "Middlesex Rugby Football Union", "response": ["* Arthur Gould (London Welsh RFC Richmond F.C. and  )"]}, {"page": "St Woolos Cemetery", "response": ["* Arthur Gould - Welsh rugby's first superstar"]}, {"page": "Arthur Gould (rugby player)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Arthur Gould (rugby union)"]}, {"page": "January 1919", "response": ["* Died: Arthur Gould, Welsh rugby player, fullback for Newport from 1882 to 1898, and the Wales national rugby union team from 1885 to 1897 (b. 1864)"]}, {"page": "Frederick Lohden", "response": ["Lohden showed promise as a sportsman while a youth, making the Durham School rugby XV while still a 15-year-old, the biggest forward in his team. On his return from education in mainland Europe he joined Hartlepool Rovers, and by the age of 19 he was selected to play at county level for Durham. By the 1892/93 season he was playing for one of England's premier clubs, Blackheath. While representing Blackheath he came to the attention of the English selectors and was chosen for the South of England team in the trials of the England squad. He was given his first and only cap in the opening game of the 1893 Home Nations Championship against Wales at the Cardiff Arms Park. The game started well for the English side, opening a 7\u20130 lead in the first half, one of the two tries scored by Lohden. A further England try at the start of the second half appeared to give England an overwhelming lead only to see an historic Welsh comeback, led by their talismanic captain Arthur Gould, which snatched victory from England in the final minutes. Although Lohden never played for England again, a series of minor injuries ending his career by 1896, he was selected for invitational tourists the Barbarians in 1893, and also represented Surrey county. After retiring from playing he kept up his connection with the sport of rugby by being elected onto the Durham County Rugby Union committee, serving them from 1896 to 1902."]}]}}
