Also leaving was outside-left Joe Clark, who was sold to Third Division North side Rochdale after losing his place in the first team to Len Andrews late the previous season. Two players were brought in to take Clark's place \u2013 Elias MacDonald from Burton All Saints in May, and Jimmy Carr from Reading in June.
