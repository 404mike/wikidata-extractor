In 1895, she and her husband Walter Skrine lived on a 16,500 acre ranch in Alberta. But they returned to Ireland and were, in 1921, burned out of their mansion Ballyrankin House near Bunclody.She also used the name Nesta. She published Songs of the Glens of Antrim (1900) and More Songs of the Glens of Antrim (1921). From the first of these collections, composer Charles Villiers Stanford selected the six poems of his song-cycle 'An Irish Idyll' (publ. 1901), dedicated to baritone Harry Plunket Greene, which includes one of Stanford's best-known songs, 'The Fairy Lough'. Her poem Sea Wrack was also set to music for voice and piano by the composer Hamilton Harty and this remains a popular work today.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Poems of Today", "response": ["A.

She was educated by her mother, governesses, and at a boarding school in Bray, County Wicklow.Picnic in a Foreign Land by Ann Morrow, Grafton Books 1990 Relationships between her and her parents were cold and she states that she had no fun in her life as a child. Her own passion for hunting and horses was born out of her need for fun and enjoyment. Reading did not feature much in her family, and, although her mother wrote poetry, it was of a sentimental nature, \"suitable to a woman of her class\". Keane claimed she had never set out to be a writer, but at seventeen she was bed bound due to suspected tuberculosis, and turned to writing out of sheer boredom. It was then she wrote her first book, The Knight of Cheerful Countenance, which was published by Mills & Boon. She wrote under the pseudonym \"M. J. Farrell\", a name over a pub that she had seen on her return from hunting. She explained writing anonymously because \"for a woman to read a book, let alone write one was viewed with alarm: I would have been banned from every respectable house in Co.

In 1907, L\u00e9onie traveled to Japan at the behest of Yone Noguchi, the father of Ailes' older half-brother, Isamu, who had been born in 1904. However, by the time L\u00e9onie arrived in Tokyo, Yone was involved with a Japanese woman who had already borne the first of their nine children. L\u00e9onie's circumstances in Japan were always precarious. Nevertheless, she chose to stay there, teaching to support herself and Isamu, while continuing to edit Yone's writing. When Ailes was born, L\u00e9onie chose the name Ailes for her daughter from a poem Beauty's a Flower by Moira O'Neill, the pseudonym of Agnes Shakespeare Higginson. It is a striking coincidence that the words in that poem seemed to predict Ailes' career as a dancer. O'Neill wrote, \"Ailes was a girl that stepped on two bare feet...\" L\u00e9onie, Isamu and Ailes lived together in Japan until 1918, when L\u00e9onie sent Isamu back to the United States to attend a progressive school in Indiana."]}, {"page": "1955 in Northern Ireland", "response": ["*22 January \u2013 Moira O'Neill, poet (born 1864)."]}, {"page": "1864 in Ireland", "response": ["*:*Moira O'Neill (Nesta Shakespear Higginson), poet (died 1955)."]}, {"page": "Moira (given name)", "response": ["* Moira O'Neill, Irish-Canadian poet"]}, {"page": "A.
