The first part, The Yugoslav Goals of the Ravna Gora Movement stated that Yugoslavia would be a democratic federation with three units, one each for the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, and national minorities would be expelled. The second part, The Serbian Goals of the Ravna Gora Movement reinforced the existing Chetnik idea that all Serbian provinces would be united in the Serbian unit within the federal arrangement, based on the solidarity between all Serb regions of Yugoslavia, under a unicameral parliament. The congress also resolved that Yugoslavia should be a constitutional monarchy headed by a Serb sovereign. According to some historians, the new program of the Chetniks was social-democratic Yugoslavism, with a change to a federal Yugoslav structure with a dominant Serb unit, but in asserting the need to gather all Serbs into a single entity, The Serbian Goals of the Ravna Gora Movement was reminiscent of Homogeneous Serbia. The congress also did not recognise Macedonia and Montenegro as separate nations, and also implied that Croatia and Slovenia would effectively be appendages to the Serbian entity. The net effect of this, according to the historian Jozo Tomasevich, was that the country would not only return to the same Serb-dominated state it had been in during the interwar period, but would be worse than that, particularly for the Croats. He concludes that this outcome was to be expected given the overwhelmingly Serb makeup of the congress, which included only two or three Croats, one Slovene and one Bosnian Muslim among its more than 300 attendees. The historian Marko Attila Hoare agrees that despite its superficial Yugoslavism, the congress had clear Greater Serbia inclinations. The congress expressed an interest in reforming the economic, social, and cultural position of the country, particularly regarding democratic ideals. This was a significant departure from previous Chetnik goals expressed earlier in the war, especially in terms of promoting democratic principles with some socialist features. Tomasevich observes that these new goals were probably more related to achieving propaganda objectives than reflecting actual intentions, given that there was no real interest in considering the needs of the non-Serb peoples of Yugoslavia. The practical outcome of the congress was the establishment of a single political party for the movement, the Yugoslav Democratic National Union (, JDNZ), and an expansion of the CNK, however the congress did nothing to improve the position of the Chetnik movement."]}, {"page": "Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107", "response": ["According to historian Marko Attila Hoare, \"On other occasions, however, Mihailovi\u0107's Chetniks rescued German airmen and handed them over safely to the German armed forces\u00a0...

They were consequently less than enthusiastic about British abandonment of the anti-communist Mihailovi\u0107, and more reserved toward the Partisans.\" Several Yugoslavs were also evacuated in Operation Halyard, along with Topalovi\u0107; they tried to raise more support abroad for Mihailovi\u0107's movement, but this came too late to reverse Allied policy.

According to the historian Marko Attila Hoare, this caused the Muslim landowning class to further resent the Bosnian Serb peasantry and was one of the contributing factors behind the genocide of hundreds of thousands of Serbs by the Croatian nationalist Usta\u0161e movement during World War II. The appeal of Ko\u010di\u0107's political pronouncements among Bosnian Serbs extended across the political spectrum. During World War II, the Serbian nationalist Chetniks and the communist Partisans, both of whose members were predominantly Serbs, upheld Ko\u010di\u0107 as a hero. This manifested itself in the creation of the \"Petar Ko\u010di\u0107\" Chetnik Detachment, under the command of Uro\u0161 Drenovi\u0107. In Partisan propaganda, Ko\u010di\u0107 was lauded as an anti-German revolutionary who fought to liberate Bosnia and Herzegovina from foreign domination. During the socialist period, which lasted between 1945 and 1991, Ko\u010di\u0107's Serb heritage was deliberately understated in schoolbooks, and schoolchildren were taught to regard him as an exclusively Bosnian historical and literary figure."]}, {"page": "Gojko \u0160u\u0161ak", "response": ["In early 1992 the war spread to neighboring Bosnia and Herzegovina, where the Croatian government helped arm the Croatian Defence Council (HVO), the main Croat army, and the Bosniak Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH). The Defence Ministry established logistics centers for sending men, weapons and ammunition to the ARBiH. HV units were deployed in Bosnian Posavina and participated in Operation Jackal against the VRS. On 18 November 1991 the Croatian Community of Herzeg-Bosnia was established as an autonomous Croat territorial unit. \u0160u\u0161ak was one of the chief supporters of Herzeg-Bosnia in the government and according to historian Marko Attila Hoare acted as a \"conduit\" of Croatian support for Bosnian Croat separatism. Relations between Croats and Bosniaks worsened by the end of 1992, resulting in the Croat\u2013Bosniak War. During the war, HV units were deployed on the frontlines against the VRS in eastern Herzegovina. Volunteers with origins from Herzeg-Bosnia were sent by the Defence Ministry to the HVO, the official military formation of Herzeg-Bosnia. At its peak the amount of money from Croatia that funded the HVO surpassed $500,000 per day. \u0160u\u0161ak supported the Vance-Owen plan that would establish 10 ethnically based provinces in Bosnia and Herzegovina. He worked closely with EC representative David Owen, who adopted some of his proposals.

In June 1941, Serbs in eastern Herzegovina staged an armed rebellion against the NDH authorities following massacres of Serbs, which was suppressed after two weeks. Persecution of Serbs resulted in the prevalence of resistance movements in Serb populated areas including parts of Bosnia. Another rebellion, led by the Partisans, began in July 27, 1941. Some of these insurgents in turn committed atrocities against the Muslim and Croat population. In the early stages of the war, Serbs formed around 90% of Partisan units that were active in the NDH. Most of the anti-fascist combat and battles were fought in mainly Serb-inhabited areas of Bosnia & Herzegovina, such as the Battle of Neretva, Battle of Sutjeska, Drvar Operation and Kozara Battle. During the entire course of the WWII in Yugoslavia, according to the records of recipients of Partisan pensions, 64.1% of all Bosnian Partisans were Serbs.Lenard J Cohen, Paul V Warwick (1983) Political Cohesion In A Fragile Mosaic: The Yugoslav Experience p. 64; Avalon Publishing, the University of Michigan; Marko Attila Hoare (2002). \"Whose is the partisan movement?
