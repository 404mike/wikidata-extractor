Carlton Morris' early cross found no-one before, on 54 minutes, the midfielder Bryn Morris went down with a hamstring injury after an aerial challenge with Josh Emmanuel.  Unable to continue, Bryn Morris was replaced by the striker Payne, and four  minutes later Shrewsbury equalised.  A free kick from Whalley to Mat Sadler was passed back to Rodman who turned it past the Rotherham goalkeeper, Marek Rod\u00e1k, to make it 1\u20131.  Despite seeming to recover from an injury after a clash with Wood, Carlton Morris was replaced on 64 minutes by Lenell John-Lewis.  In the 69th minute, Vaulks' shot was saved by Henderson, before Rotherham made their first substitution of the afternoon with Caolan Lavery coming on to replace Ball.  Newell's shot was straight at the goalkeeper, and Joe Riley was then brought on for Bolton.  Lavery then took the ball in space but his shot curled wide of the Shrewsbury post.  With fifteen minutes of regular time remaining, Ryan Williams was brought on for Taylor.  Two chances were missed by Lavery before John-Lewis' shot went wide of Rodak's post.  Michael Smith then saw his shot saved, and with chances at either end missed, the match went into five minutes of additional time.  In the final moments, a Williams shot was saved by Henderson and the second half ended 1\u20131, sending the match into extra time.", "|2 ||Josh Emmanuel"]}, {"page": "2018\u201319 Ipswich Town F.C. season", "response": ["| 31 August 2018 || RB ||  || Josh Emmanuel ||  Shrewsbury Town || 31 May 2019 || "]}, {"page": "2018\u201319 Shrewsbury Town F.C. season", "response": ["| 31 August 2018 || RB ||  || Josh Emmanuel || Ipswich Town || 18 January 2019 || "]}, {"page": "Ipswich Town F.C.
