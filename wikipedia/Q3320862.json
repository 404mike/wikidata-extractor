She qualified for the main draw of the Australian Open when Maria Sharapova withdrew because of injury. Because Anne Keothavong had already qualified for the main draw, it was the first time since Jo Durie and Clare Wood in the 1993 US Open, that two British women had gained direct entry into a Grand Slam championship. South made it to the second round at Brisbane after Bartoli retired due to a left calf strain at 1\u20131 in the first set. She was defeated in the second round by No. 2 seed, Caroline Wozniacki, in straight sets. In the first round of the Australian Open, South fell to Bartoli in straight sets. South broke into the top 100 for the first time on 2 February 2009, achieving a career-high ranking of 99.
