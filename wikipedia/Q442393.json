Morris's Republican faction, along with Federalist groups in other states, sought the ratification of the new federal Constitution. The Constitutionalists, who saw the new federal constitution as a threat to state sovereignty, joined with Anti-Federalists in other states in seeking to prevent the ratification of the Constitution. In elections held in October and November 1787, Morris's Federalist allies retained control of the state legislature and won a majority of the elections held to select delegates for the convention held to debate ratification of the Constitution.Rappleye (2010), pp. 438\u2013440 Due to a dispute with a business partner, Morris did not attend the ratification convention, which voted to ratify the Constitution in December 1787.Rappleye (2010), pp. 440, 446 By the end of 1788, the Constitution had been ratified by enough states to take effect. In September 1788, the Pennsylvania legislature elected Robert Morris and William Maclay, both of whom were aligned with the Federalists, as the state's first representatives in the United States Senate.Rappleye (2010), pp. 449\u2013450"]}, {"page": "List of United States senators from Pennsylvania", "response": ["| align=left | 100pxWilliam Maclay"]}, {"page": "Founding Fathers of the United States", "response": ["* William Maclay, Pennsylvania politician and U.S. senator"]}, {"page": "United States congressional delegations from Pennsylvania", "response": ["|  | William Maclay (AA)"]}, {"page": "Samuel Maclay", "response": ["Maclay was born the younger brother of future Pennsylvania senator William Maclay.
