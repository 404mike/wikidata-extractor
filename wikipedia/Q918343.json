He is the director of the university's Autism Research Centre and a Fellow of Trinity College. In 1985, Baron-Cohen formulated the mind-blindness theory of autism, the evidence for which he collated and published in 1995. In 1997, he formulated the fetal sex steroid theory of autism, the key test of which was published in 2015.\nHe has also made major contributions to the fields of typical cognitive sex differences, autism prevalence and screening, autism genetics, autism neuroimaging, autism and technical ability, and synaesthesia. Baron-Cohen was knighted in the 2021 New Year Honours for services to autistic people.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 15", "response": ["*1958 \u2013 Simon Baron-Cohen, English-Canadian psychiatrist and author"]}, {"page": "Asperger syndrome", "response": ["Some researchers have argued that AS can be viewed as a different cognitive style, not a disorder, and that it should be removed from the standard Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, much as homosexuality was removed. In a 2002 paper, Simon Baron-Cohen wrote of those with AS: \"In the social world, there is no great benefit to a precise eye for detail, but in the worlds of maths, computing, cataloging, music, linguistics, engineering, and science, such an eye for detail can lead to success rather than failure.\" Baron-Cohen cited two reasons why it might still be useful to consider AS to be a disability: to ensure provision for legally required special support, and to recognize emotional difficulties from reduced empathy. Baron-Cohen argues that the genes for Asperger's combination of abilities have operated throughout recent human evolution and have made remarkable contributions to human history."]}, {"page": "Sacha Baron Cohen", "response": ["Sacha Noam Baron Cohen was born in the Hammersmith area of London on 13 October 1971, the son of Jewish parents. His mother, photographer Daniella Naomi (n\u00e9e Weiser), was born in Israel to a family of German Jews who had immigrated there. His father, editor-turned-clothing store owner Gerald Baron Cohen (1932\u20132016), was born in London to a family of Ashkenazi Belarusian Jews who had moved there and to Pontypridd in Wales, and was raised in Wales. Baron Cohen was raised Jewish in London and is fluent in Hebrew. His paternal grandfather, Morris Cohen, added \"Baron\" to his surname. His maternal grandmother, Liesel, lived in Haifa and trained as a ballet dancer in Germany before fleeing the Nazis in 1936. Baron Cohen has two older brothers: Erran, a composer with whom he has collaborated, and Amnon.

This book investigates the phenomenon of late-talking children, frequently misdiagnosed with autism or pervasive developmental disorder. He includes the research of Stephen Camarata and Steven Pinker, among others, in this overview of a poorly understood developmental trait. It is a trait which he says affected many historical figures who developed prominent careers, such as physicists Albert Einstein,Wolff, Barbara, and Hananya Goodman. \"The Legend of the Dull-Witted Child Who Grew Up to Be a Genius.\" The Albert Einstein Archives. IS: Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Edward Teller, and Richard Feynman; mathematician Julia Robinson; and musicians Arthur Rubinstein and Clara Schumann. He makes the case for the theory that some children develop unevenly (asynchronous development) for a period in childhood due to rapid and extraordinary development in the analytical functions of the brain. This may temporarily \"rob resources\" from neighboring functions such as language development. Sowell disagrees with Simon Baron-Cohen's speculation that Einstein may have had Asperger syndrome."]}, {"page": "List of psychologists", "response": ["* Simon Baron-Cohen"]}, {"page": "Richard Borcherds", "response": ["An interview with Simon Singh for The Guardian, in which Borcherds suggested he might have some traits associated with Asperger syndrome,Simon Singh, \"Interview with Richard Borcherds\", The Guardian (28 August 1998) subsequently led to a chapter about him in a book on autism by Simon Baron-Cohen. (see external links) records conversations with Richard Borcherds and his family.High flying obsessives, The Guardian, December 2000 Baron-Cohen concluded that while Borcherds had many autistic traits, he did not merit a formal diagnosis of Asperger syndrome."]}, {"page": "Empathy", "response": ["Studies have found that individuals on the autistic spectrum self-report lower levels of empathic concern, show less or absent comforting responses toward someone who is suffering, and report equal or higher levels of personal distress compared to controls. The combination in those on the autism spectrum of reduced empathic concern and increased personal distress may lead to the overall reduction of empathy. Professor Simon Baron-Cohen suggests that those with classic autism often lack both cognitive and affective empathy. However, other research has found no evidence of impairment in autistic individuals' ability to understand other people's basic intentions or goals; instead, data suggests that impairments are found in understanding more complex social emotions or in considering others' viewpoints. Research also suggests that people with Asperger syndrome may have problems understanding others' perspectives in terms of theory of mind, but the average person with the condition demonstrates equal empathic concern as, and higher personal distress, than controls. The existence of individuals with heightened personal distress on the autism spectrum has been offered as an explanation as to why at least some people with autism would appear to have heightened emotional empathy,Phoebe Caldwell, \"Letters\", London Times, Dec 30 2005 although increased personal distress may be an effect of heightened egocentrism, emotional empathy depends on mirror neuron activity (which, as described previously, has been found to be reduced in those with autism), and empathy in people on the autism spectrum is generally reduced. The empathy deficits present in autism spectrum disorders may be more indicative of impairments in the ability to take the perspective of others, while the empathy deficits in psychopathy may be more indicative of impairments in responsiveness to others\u2019 emotions. These \"disorders of empathy\" further highlight the importance of the ability to empathize by illustrating some of the consequences to disrupted empathy development.McDonald, Nicole M., and Daniel S. Messinger. \"The development of empathy: How, when, and why.\" Moral Behavior and Free Will: A Neurobiological and Philosophical Aprroach (2011): 341-368.", "Despite studies suggesting deficits in emotion perception and imagining others in pain, professor Simon Baron-Cohen claims psychopathy is associated with intact cognitive empathy, which would imply an intact ability to read and respond to behaviors, social cues and what others are feeling. Psychopathy is, however, associated with impairment in the other major component of empathy\u2014affective (emotional) empathy\u2014which includes the ability to feel the suffering and emotions of others (what scientists would term as emotional contagion), and those with the condition are therefore not distressed by the suffering of their victims. Such a dissociation of affective and cognitive empathy has indeed been demonstrated for aggressive offenders. Those with autism, on the other hand, are claimed to be often impaired in both affective and cognitive empathy."]}, {"page": "Theory of mind", "response": ["Simon Baron-Cohen proposed that infants' understanding of attention in others acts as a \"critical precursor\" to the development of theory of mind. Understanding attention involves understanding that seeing can be directed selectively as attention, that the looker assesses the seen object as \"of interest\", and that seeing can induce beliefs. A possible illustration of theory of mind in infants is joint attention. Joint attention refers to when two people look at and attend to the same thing; parents often use the act of pointing to prompt infants to engage in joint attention. Understanding this prompt requires that infants take into account another person's mental state, understanding that the person notices an object or finds it of interest.  Baron-Cohen speculates that the inclination to spontaneously reference an object in the world as of interest, via pointing, (\"protodeclarative pointing\") and to likewise appreciate the directed attention of another, may be the underlying motive behind all human communication.", "In 1985 Simon Baron-Cohen, Alan M. Leslie and Uta Frith suggested that children with autism do not employ theory of mind and suggested that autistic children have particular difficulties with tasks requiring the child to understand another person's beliefs. These difficulties persist when children are matched for verbal skills and have been taken as a key feature of autism."]}, {"page": "Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus", "response": ["In 2002, author Julia T. Wood published a critical response to the portrayal of the genders in Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus. In the first chapter of 2003 book The Essential Difference, Simon Baron-Cohen compares with Gray's bestseller and states: \"the view that men are from Mars and women Venus paints the differences between the two sexes as too extreme. The two sexes are different, but are not so different that we cannot understand each other.\" In 2004 Erina MacGeorge, a Purdue University communication professor, said that based on research she conducted using questionnaires and interviews, men and women are not so different and \"books like John Gray's Men are From Mars and Women are From Venus and Deborah Tannen's You Just Don't Understand tell men that being masculine means dismissing feelings and downplaying problems (which many men themselves that read the book disagree with). That isn't what most men do, and it isn't good for either men or women.\""]}]}}
