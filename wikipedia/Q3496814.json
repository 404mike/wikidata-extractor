He gained a BA (Admin) in 1934 from Manchester University, studying at night school.  He joined the Department of Customs and Excise in Manchester the same year and transferred to London in 1938.  Apart from his war-time military service in the Royal Air Force from 1944 to 1946, he worked in London for the same Department until taking early retirement in 1970 to focus on BWP.Cramp took up birdwatching as a boy, and serious ornithology dominated much of his life.  He was active in British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) and Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), as well as the British Ornithologists Union (BOU), serving in various administrative positions in all three, as well as in many other bodies.  He joined the editorial board of the journal British Birds in 1960 and became Senior Editor in 1963, a position he kept for the rest of his life.He was Vice Chairman of the Council for Environmental Conservation, known as CoEnCo, under Lord Craigton, and based in London.  He appointed Edward Dawson as its Chief Officer in 1977.  At that time he was also senior advisor to the European Commission on the Birds Directive.  His unique insight led him to develop ideas of habitat protection, to complement the original purpose of stopping song birds being gunned down as they migrated south for the winter.\nFor the last 17 years of his life Cramp devoted himself to producing BWP, a monumental task which ultimately affected his health.  After seeing the first four volumes published, and initiating the fifth, his health deteriorated, though he continued to struggle on with the task.  He died following a stroke and subsequent pneumonia.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mallard", "response": ["The drakes that end up being left out after the others have paired off with mating partners sometimes target an isolated female duck, even one of a different species, and proceed to chase and peck at her until she weakens, at which point the males take turns copulating with the female. Lebret (1961) calls this behaviour \"Attempted Rape Flight\", and Stanley Cramp and K.E.L. Simmons (1977) speak of \"rape-intent flights\". Male mallards also occasionally chase other male ducks of a different species, and even each other, in the same way. In one documented case of \"homosexual necrophilia\", a male mallard copulated with another male he was chasing after the chased male died upon flying into a glass window. This paper was awarded an Ig Nobel Prize in 2003."]}, {"page": "British Ornithologists' Union", "response": ["* 1979-1983 : Stanley Cramp (1913\u20131987)"]}, {"page": "The Birds of the Western Palearctic", "response": ["The Birds of the Western Palearctic is a comprehensive regional avifauna for the Western Palearctic. It consists of 9 volumes, the first published in 1977 and the ninth in 1994. The main editor for the first five volumes was Stanley Cramp. Cramp died in 1987 and the subsequent volumes were edited by Duncan Brooks and Christopher Perrins. BWP's format and breadth influenced the development of regional avifaunas for other parts of the world, notably The Birds of Africa."]}]}}
