It was then repeated on BBC Two in April 1997. Originally intended to be a low-key behind-the-scenes documentary, the emergence of several memorable recurring characters gave the show a docusoap feel. Special fame was gained by Jeremy Spake, an Aeroflot employee, whose flamboyance earned him a series of short 'bumpers' on UKTV People explaining how to best use airports. Other airlines featured throughout the series are Aer Lingus, Air Jamaica, Avianca, BMI, Canadian Airlines, Cyprus Airways (1947\u20132015), Czech Airlines, El Al, Emirates, Gulf Air, Icelandair, Iran Air, Jat Airways, Kuwait Airways, Pakistan International Airlines, Qantas, Qatar Airways and Virgin Atlantic.", "John Cull, Qantas Airport Manager, appears in 17 episodes of the series.

I innocently created a main site article for her a few days ago, only to discover that it's been bounced out because there was a draft article for her all along. In my opinion, Lee Chae-yeon is so obviously notable. She is well known in South Korea and in much of the world, not just by being a part of a successful pop group, but also being one four separate TV shows. There are YouTube videos featuring just herself that have millions of views. She has an Instagram account with over 1 million subscribers. She is far more notable that say Jeremy Spake and my favourite Wikipedia biography page of all time: Anthony Killick. There is a story to tell about her which is definitely encylcopedic (e.g. background,, personal details, performances, songwriting credits etc). To be serious for a second, how can we expect more casual users of Wikipedia to help improve articles if they are stuck in Draft like this? Not everyone editing Wikipedia is an intense user. I would support the idea of a template in the article requring more references, especially in English. I'm a long-standing Wikipedia editor, so I can perhaps put up with these setbacks, but I do really worry about these processes putting off much more casual editors. This whole draft thing for someone like Lee Chae-yeon is surely the wrong approach. I'm just crossing my fingers that this article can be moved into the main site, so it can be edited by a wider pool of editors. Seaweed (talk) 16:25, 19 December 2021 (UTC)"]}]}}
