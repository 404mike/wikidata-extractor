In addition to the T-shirt, and leather jackets they wore ripped jeans and boots, typically Doc Martens. The punk look was inspired to shock people. Richard Hell's more androgynous, ragamuffin look\u2014and reputed invention of the safety-pin aesthetic\u2014was a major influence on Sex Pistols impresario Malcolm McLaren and, in turn, British punk style.Strongman (2008), pp. 58, 63, 64; Colegrave and Sullivan (2005), p. 78.

Among the other facets of the punk rock scene, a punk's hair is an important way of showing their freedom of expression. The typical male punk haircut was originally short and choppy; the mohawk later emerged as a characteristic style.Wojcik (1995), pp. 16\u201319; Laing (1985), p. 109.
