He was an amateur, self-taught apart from evening classes at Edinburgh College of Art, but during the period 1939-1952 he produced Surrealist works that are said to be unprecedented in Scottish art of the period.His work attracted little attention from the art world at the time, but it started receiving recognition following its \"discovery\" in 2013 by curators of the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Stockbridge, Edinburgh", "response": ["*Edwin G Lucas (1911\u20131990), artist"]}, {"page": "Juniper Green", "response": ["*Edwin G Lucas (1911-1990) - surrealist artist "]}, {"page": "List of Scottish artists", "response": ["*Edwin G Lucas (1911\u20131990), painter"]}, {"page": "Edward George Handel Lucas", "response": ["==His nephew, Edwin G Lucas==", "E G Handel Lucas had a nephew Edwin G Lucas who also became a notable artist. Edwin was inspired by Surrealism and developed his own \"highly innovative take on Surrealism\". Handel would probably not have approved, given his strong negative views on modernist art. Handel died very early in Edwin's career and his biggest influence was contributing to family pressure on Edwin not to rely on art as his sole means of making a living."]}]}}
