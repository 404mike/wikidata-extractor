His failing health and a weakness in his lungs led to his emigration to Melbourne in 1851 where he was employed by Thomas Ham to produce engraved illustrations \u2013 The Water Seeker, The Gold Seeker and Gold Digger of Victoria \u2013 for the Illustrated Australian Magazine. Later he worked for De Gruchy & Leigh, for whom he produced the engraving Melbourne 1856 Taken from the South Side of the Yarra. Samuel Calvert also employed him in the late 1850s, particularly for drawing on wood. At least twelve of his drawings were reproduced as wood-engravings in the Newsletter of Australasia between 1859 and 1861 and the surrounds of the cover illustration used on some issues was also to his design.", "Strafford\u2019s wife died on 21 August 1857, leaving him with no kin in the colony of Australia. By August 1861 his mental instability, accentuated by her death, had increased to such an extent that John J. Mouritz, the Baptist minister of Fitzroy, petitioned for his entry into the Yarra Bend Lunatic Asylum; he was admitted on 27 September. He was discharged into Mouritz\u2019s care in December 1864 but after Mouritz\u2019s death was readmitted on 1 June 1869 on the petition of Samuel Calvert, listed in the asylum records as the patient\u2019s friend. Strafford was transferred to Carlton Asylum in May 1871, to Kew in June 1873 and to Beechworth on 9 February 1876. He died in the Beechworth Asylum on 13 February 1896, completely forgotten by the Victorian art community. His age at death was given as sixty-six, but he must have been about ten years older since he was exhibiting in the 1840s."]}, {"page": "Castlemaine Art Museum", "response": ["A cultural precedent was the 1855 Castlemaine Mechanics Institute which included a library; and numbers of artists, including S.
