Sellers was not interested in the role until he learned that Sophia Loren would be his co-star. When asked about Loren, he explained to reporters, \"I don't normally act with romantic, glamorous women\u00a0... She's a lot different from Harry Secombe.\" Sellers and Loren developed a close relationship during filming, culminating in Sellers declaring his love for her in front of his wife. Sellers also woke his son at night to ask: \"Do you think I should divorce your mummy?\" There is uncertainty if the relationship was anything more than platonic: a number of people, including Spike Milligan, consider it an affair, while others, including Graham Stark, think it remained only a strong friendship. Sellers's wife at the time, Anne, afterwards commented, \"I don't know to this day whether he had an affair with her. Nobody does.\" Roger Lewis observed that Sellers immersed himself completely in the characters he enacted during productions, that \"He'd play a role as an Indian doctor, and for the next six months, he'd be an Indian in his real [daily] life.\" The film inspired the George Martin-produced novelty hit single \"Goodness Gracious Me\", with Sellers and Loren, which reached number four in the UK Singles Chart in November 1960. A follow-up single by the duo, \"Bangers and Mash\", reached number 22 in the UK chart. The songs were included on an album released by the couple, Peter & Sophia, which reached number five in the UK Albums Chart.

That same year, although known chiefly as a film star, Bergman appeared in London's West End, working with stage star Michael Redgrave in A Month in the Country.

In the meantime, film producers were eager to profit from the scandal surrounding Taylor and Burton, and they next starred together in Anthony Asquith's The V.I.P.s (1963), which mirrored the headlines about them. Taylor played a famous model attempting to leave her husband for a lover, and Burton her estranged millionaire husband. Released soon after Cleopatra, it became a box-office success.

Burton played her tycoon husband Paul Andros in Anthony Asquith's The V.I.P.s (1963), an ensemble cast film described by Alpert as a \"kind of Grand Hotel story\" that was set in the VIP lounge of London Heathrow Airport; it proved to be a box-office hit despite mixed reviews. It was after The V.I.P.s that Burton became considerably more selective about his roles; he credited Taylor for this as he simply acted in films \"to get rich\" and she \"made me see what kind of rubbish I was doing\". Burton divorced Sybil in April 1963 after completing The V.I.P.s while Taylor was granted divorce from Fisher on 6 March 1964. Taylor then took a two-year hiatus from films until her next venture with Burton, The Sandpiper (1965). The supercouple, dubbed \"Liz and Dick\" by the press, continued starring together in films in the mid-1960s, earning a combined $88\u00a0million over the next decade and spending $65\u00a0million. Regarding their earnings, in a 1976 interview with Lester David and Jhan Robbins of The Ledger, Burton stated that \"they say we generate more business activity than one of the smaller African nations\" and that the couple \"often outspent\" the Greek business tycoon Aristotle Onassis."]}, {"page": "Margaret Rutherford", "response": ["Although she made her film debut in 1936, it was Rutherford's turn as Madame Arcati in David Lean's film of Blithe Spirit (1945) that established her screen success.

She was Nurse Carey in Miranda (1948) and the sprightly Medieval expert Professor Hatton-Jones in Passport to Pimlico (1949), one of the Ealing Comedies.

In 1952 this comment was applicable to the then Liberal party's precarious political position, whose few remaining MPs were largely in constituencies where the Conservative party refused to stand for fear of splitting an established Liberal vote and letting in the Labour Party. Since then, many adaptations of the play have kept this brief mention of the obscure political party. However, in the 2002 film version which starred Judi Dench, Colin Firth, Rupert Everett and Reese Witherspoon \u2013 the lines were dropped yet episodes and characters in an earlier version of the play that Wilde had been encouraged to drop before the play's first performance were re-incorporated."]}, {"page": "John Mills", "response": ["At the Old Vic he was in A Midsummer Night's Dream (1939), She Stoops to Conquer (1939) and Of Mice and Men (1939\u201340).
