Croxdale Pit was opened in 1845. This venture was carried out by the Salvin family of Croxdale Hall but lasted only a few decades, closing by 1870. At this time St Bartholomew's church was built by Salvin for the miners who were attracted to work in the colliery. In exchange for the ancient chapel situated on the nearby Croxdale Estate, Gerard Salvin, Esq., gave the site of this church, the old chapel now being used as a mortuary chapel for the Salvin family. St Bartholomew's churchyard is the final resting place of James Finlay Weir Johnston the founder of Durham Johnston School in nearby Durham City. 1875 saw a return of coal mining as the Weardale Iron and Coal Company opened Croxdale Colliery just to the south of Sunderland Bridge. This mine producing coal, fireclay and coke and employing, at its peak, over 900 workers. Housing was built to accommodate mine workers and their families, a Methodist Chapel completed in 1877 and a school built in 1878-79 (now the Community Centre) as well as St Bartholemew's being extended in 1878. The main streets in the new mining village were named after the people who provided the finance to build the housing, Salvin Street and Rogerson, Johnson and Foster Terraces. So successful was the colliery that John Rogerson (one of the four directors of the Weardale Iron and Coal Company) rented Croxdale Hall from the Salvin family for a time.
