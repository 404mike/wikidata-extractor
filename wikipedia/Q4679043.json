Tracker music, for example, originated in the Amiga games industry but was soon heavily dominated by demoscene musicians; producer Adam Fielding claims to have tracker/demoscene roots. Currently, there is a major tracking scene separate from the actual demoscene. A form of static computer graphics where demosceners have traditionally excelled is pixel art; see artscene for more information on the related subculture. Origins of creative coding tools like Shadertoy and Three.js can be directly traced back to the scene."]}, {"page": "Distinctive Records", "response": ["* Adam Fielding"]}, {"page": "Lovespirals", "response": ["In 2009, UK dance label Loverush Digital released another set of \"This Truth\" remixes, branded as Damien.S VS Lovespirals.
