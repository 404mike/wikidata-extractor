Malek was the first CMS mission in southern Sudan.  Angus Cameron, the Governor of Mongalla, had discouraged the missionaries from settling Mongalla and suggested a site downriver, 18 kilometers south of  Bor.  Llewellyn Gwynne oversaw the group that established the Malek Mission in early 1906.  It consisted of  Rev. Archibald Shaw, Rev. Arthur Thom, Rev. F.B. Hadow, Dr. Lloyd, Mr. Comely, and Mr. Wilmott.  The mission closed (temporarily) fewer than two years later, in May 1908, when only Archibald Shaw remained there; the others had all left, owing to a combination of ill-health and frustration.  A Church Mission Society school was subsequently established at the mission, providing one of the few opportunities for access to education in the region."]}, {"page": "Angus Cameron (Governor of Mongalla)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Angus Cameron (colonial administrator)"]}, {"page": "Angus Cameron (Egyptian administrator)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Angus Cameron (colonial administrator)"]}, {"page": "Governor Cameron", "response": ["*Angus Cameron (colonial administrator) (1871\u20131961), Governor of Mongalla Province from 1906 to 1908"]}]}}
