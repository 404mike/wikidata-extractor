Robinson (born 1880 \u2013 year of death unknown) was an English first-class cricketer who played seven games with little success, he also played rugby league for Hull Kingston Rovers as a centre.\nRobinson's debut was in South Africa in January 1906, when he appeared for Natal against Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Pietermaritzburg, scoring 4 and 0. He did not appear in first-class cricket again until after the First World War, playing for Worcestershire against Hampshire in May 1920. He fared little better than he had 14 years earlier, making 2* and 4.\nAnother sizeable gap followed before Robinson, by now in his mid-forties, played five more times for Worcestershire in 1925 and 1926. Once again, however, he failed to make the most of his opportunity and his highest score was 37 against Yorkshire in the first of these games in July 1925.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Arthur Robinson", "response": ["*Arthur W.

Simply writing \"unknown\" in the Dateofbirth and Monthofbirth fields doesn't work because of the automatic date formatting. Help?
