The match was postponed six times before it eventually took place on 1 March. A 0\u20130 draw meant a replay at Anfield. Andy Lochhead gave the Foxes the lead on 34 minutes. Five minutes later McArthurs's handball gave Liverpool a penalty, but Peter Shilton saved Tommy Smith's spot-kick. Liverpool attacked for much of the second half, but Leicester held out to win 1\u20130.  The quarter final saw a trip to Mansfield Town, who had knocked out clubs from five different divisions. On a pitch described by The Times' Geoffrey Green as \"resembling a glutinous swamp\", Leicester won 1\u20130. The goal was a header by Rodney Fern from a Len Glover cross. The semi-final, played at Hillsborough Stadium, was against cup-holders West Bromwich Albion. In a game of few chances, Allan Clarke scored from an Andy Lochhead knockdown with four minutes remaining. Leicester City gained their fourth 1\u20130 win of the competition and reached the final.", "|MF ||7 ||  Rodney Fern"]}, {"page": "List of Leicester City F.C. seasons", "response": ["|align=left| Rodney Fern || 18"]}, {"page": "1969\u201370 Football League", "response": ["|16||align=left|  Rodney Fern ||align=left| Leicester City ||16||0||1||\u2014||17"]}, {"page": "1974\u201375 Luton Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Rodney Fern"]}, {"page": "Charlie Adam (footballer, born 1919)", "response": ["After retiring from football, he managed Leicester's youth team for 16 years between 1960\u20131976, winning the national FA youth trophy in 1966, with players such as David Nish and Rodney Fern."]}, {"page": "2018 in association football", "response": ["** Rodney Fern, 69, English footballer"]}, {"page": "2017\u201318 in English football", "response": ["* 16 January 2018: Rodney Fern, 69, Leicester City, Luton Town, Chesterfield and Rotherham United striker."]}, {"page": "2018 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Rodney Fern, 69, English football player (Leicester City, Chesterfield), dementia."]}, {"page": "Deaths in January 2018", "response": ["*Rodney Fern, 69, English footballer (Leicester City, Chesterfield), dementia.Obituary: Former Leicester City striker Rodney Fern, 1948-2018"]}, {"page": "2018 in England", "response": ["**Rodney Fern, 69, English football player (Leicester City, Chesterfield), dementia.
