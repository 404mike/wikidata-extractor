In 1940 he was invited to join the Society of Dublin Painters and held regular annual  exhibitions of his work there during the forties and early fifties. These exhibitions were supplemented by an eclectic mix of commissions, mostly portraits which he undertook during this period. In 1941 Hennessy had three of his paintings accepted by the Royal Hibernian Academy, RHA, for their annual exhibition. This was the beginning of a long relationship with the RHA. He exhibited there virtually every year from 1941 until 1979 the year before his death. During the late 1940s, Hennessy undertook a portrait of Francis Bacon, which remains unfinished, but which also serves to link Hennessy to the artistic social network connected with Bacon, including Lucian Freud, John Craxton, Peter Watson, Edward James, Salvador Dal\u00ed, and Cyril Connolly. From the early 1940s onwards, Hennessy's work sometimes incorporated a homosexual visual subtext.IMMA Modern Irish Masters: Patrick Hennessy  He re-united with Harry Robertson Craig in 1946 and soon after they moved to Crosshaven Co.Cork and later to Cobh Co.

In 1950 his painting De Profundis was selected for the Contemporary Irish Painting exhibition that toured North America. As a result of this tour, the American public and critics began to take notice of his work. In 1951 the Dublin Painters Society held a Retrospective Exhibition of his work covering the period 1941 to 1951.
