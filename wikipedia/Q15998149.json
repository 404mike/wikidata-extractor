Their first play, \"To What Red Hell\", by Percy Robinson, was presented in November 1930 in the Church Hall of St. John's. The company occupied this stage for twenty-seven years, until in 1945 a new theatre was proposed using money from the Building Fund. Complications meant that, as well as the cost rising to three times the original estimate, the Middlesbrough Theatre did not open until 1957."]}, {"page": "Kevin Doherty (musician)", "response": ["After The Pyrotechnicos, Doherty was soon back up and running again with a new band, The Gooseberries. Laurence again was the drummer, along with Percy Robinson on pedal-steel, dobro and guitars, Sean McCarron on saxophone and Michael O'Boyce on bass. This became the stable line-up, but early appearances also had Ciaran Tourish or Martin McGinley on fiddle. A big difference from The Pyros was that this time the main material played consisted of Doherty's original songs. These were complemented by the inclusion of songs by the likes of Hank Williams and Dwight Yoakam. The band was a big hit live and ventured further afield in Ireland compared to The Pyros. Radio and television appearances also became part of the picture. The band were exceptional musicians and, somewhat similar to The Pyros, were well known for really getting a crowd going, as well as for the sensitive playing on Doherty's more downbeat numbers."]}, {"page": "No Deeper Blue", "response": ["#* Philip Donnelly (guitar), Percy Robinson (steel guitar), Sven Buick (bass), Robbie Brennan (drums), Brendan Hayes (piano), Declan Masterson (whistle)", "#* Philip Donnelly (guitar), Percy Robinson (steel guitar), Paul Kelly (fiddle), Sven Buick (bass), Fran Breen (drums), Brendan Hayes (organ)", "#* Pete Cummins (guitar), Percy Robinson (steel guitar), Sven Buick (bass), Paul Kelly (fiddle), Philip Donnelly (percussion), Fran Breen (drums), Brendan Hayes (keyboards), Declan Masterson (Uileann pipes)", "#* Philip Donnelly (acoustic & electric guitars), Percy Robinson (steel guitar), Sven Buick (bass), Fran Breen (drums), Brendan Hayes (organ)", "#* Philip Donnelly (acoustic & electric guitars), Percy Robinson (steel guitar), Sven Buick (bass), Fran Breen (drums), Brendan Hayes (organ)"]}, {"page": "List of Gloucestershire County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Percy Robinson (1904\u20131921) : P.
