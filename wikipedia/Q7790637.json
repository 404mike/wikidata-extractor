Attempts to excavate the stupas had been done in the past by Sir Thomas Herbert Maddock, who breached the outside of the stupas but was unable to reach the center. Cunningham and Maisey instead excavated the sites by going in perpendicular through the middle of the stupas, allowing them to successfully open and explore several stupas in Sanchi.
