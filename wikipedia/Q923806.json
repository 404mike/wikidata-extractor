He was the founding leader of the  Reform Party, New Zealand's second organised political party, from 1909 until his death.\nMassey was born in County Londonderry in Ireland (now Northern Ireland). After migrating to New Zealand in 1870, Massey farmed near Auckland (earning his later nickname, Farmer Bill) and assumed leadership in farmers' organisations. He entered parliament in 1894 as a conservative, and from 1894 to 1912 was a leader of the conservative opposition to the Liberal ministries of Richard Seddon and Joseph Ward. Massey became the first Reform Party Prime Minister after he led a successful motion of no confidence against the Liberal government. Throughout his political career Massey was known for the particular support he showed for agrarian interests, as well as his opposition to organised labour. He pledged New Zealand's support for Britain during the First World War.\nMassey led his Reform Party through four elections, although only the 1919 election was a decisive victory over all other parties. Following increasingly poor health in his fourth term, Massey died in office. After Richard Seddon, he is the second-longest-serving Prime Minister of New Zealand.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "March 26", "response": ["*1856 \u2013 William Massey, Irish-New Zealand farmer and politician, 19th Prime Minister of New Zealand (d. 1925)"]}, {"page": "1925", "response": ["** William Massey, 19th Prime Minister of New Zealand (b. 1856)"]}, {"page": "1856", "response": ["* March 26 \u2013 William Massey, Irish-born 19th Prime Minister of New Zealand (d. 1925)"]}, {"page": "British Israelism", "response": ["In 1919 the British-Israel-World Federation (BIWF) was founded in London, and Covenant Publishing was founded in 1922.

Due to the expansive nature of the British Empire, believers in British Israelism spread worldwide and the BIWF expanded its organization to the commonwealth.

The Reform Party government of William Massey dominated the political scene, having secured the conservative vote, while the growing Labour Party had started to undermine Liberal's progressive voter-base. Many members of the Liberal Party believed an alliance with the Reform Party inevitable, seeing such co-operation as necessary to counteract the \"radicalism\" of the Labour Party. When Massey died in 1925, Liberal leader Thomas Wilford decided to approach Massey's successor with a merger-proposal, suggesting that the new party could use the name \"the National Party\". The Liberal Party chose Forbes to represent them at a joint conference. The new Reform Party leader, Gordon Coates, rejected the proposal, although Wilford declared that Liberal would adopt the name \"National\" regardless."]}, {"page": "Mausoleum", "response": ["*Massey Memorial in Wellington, New Zealand where New Zealand Prime Minister William Massey and his wife are interred."]}, {"page": "List of places named after people", "response": ["* Massey \u2013 William Massey, Prime Minister"]}, {"page": "White nationalism", "response": ["The Immigration Restriction Act of 1899 prohibited the entry of immigrants who were not of British or Irish parentage and who were unable to fill out an application form in \"any European language.\" The Immigration Restriction Amendment Act of 1920 aimed to further limit Asian immigration into New Zealand by requiring all potential immigrants not of British or Irish parentage to apply in writing for a permit to enter the country.

Consequently, the brigade's personnel were redistributed amongst the remaining formations to bring them up to strength. The surplus troops formed the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Entrenching Battalions, one for each brigade, and this provided a pool of trained reinforcements for the division. In other organisational changes, a divisional machine gun battalion was formed from the companies belonging to each brigade while the New Zealand Pioneer Battalion divested itself of its squadron of Otago Mounted Rifles to leave a unit with solely M\u0101ori personnel, apart from its senior officers.
