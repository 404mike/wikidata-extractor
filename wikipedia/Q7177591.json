He was a player, manager, assistant manager and coach at Stockport County.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jim Gannon", "response": ["During the final weeks of the season, County were placed into Administration and docked 10 points, leaving them placed dangerously close to the relegation places. On 6 May 2009, soon after the final game of the season, Gannon was made redundant as manager of Stockport along with assistant boss Peter Ward. This was done by the administrators in order to slash the wage bill.", "As speculation of a move to Hibernian came to nothing (despite his being installed as the bookmaker's favourite), Gannon instead was confirmed as manager of Scottish Premier League side Motherwell at the end of June 2009, two days before the club's Europa League first round qualifying tie against Llanelli of Wales. To do this he fended off competition from Aidy Boothroyd, Lawrie Sanchez, and Steve Staunton. At the start of his reign he had a limited squad, and had to draft in youth players for the Llanelli game. The club had sold off some of their best players, whilst loan deals had ended for others. He also brought in Peter Ward as assistant manager."]}, {"page": "Ray Mathias", "response": ["On 18 December 2008, Mathias was relieved of his duties along with Archie Knox following the sacking of Paul Ince and the subsequent arrival of Sam Allardyce as the new Rovers manager. On 4 February 2011 he joined Stockport County as Technical Advisor to Peter Ward and Alan Lord.", "Mathias was appointed manager of Stockport County on 9 March 2011 until the end of the season, with Peter Ward and Alan Lord stepping back to coaching roles. Mathias then became the first manager in Stockport County history to relegate the club from the Football League."]}, {"page": "Paul Simpson (footballer)", "response": ["Simpson was charged with the task of staying in the division and rebuilding a squad which has been ravaged by administration, and ensuring the survival of the club in League Two in the coming season. He was instructed to work with Peter Ward as his assistant manager, and former youth team manager Alan Lord was put in charge of Youth Development. Both Ward and Lord were returning to County having previously worked there under former manager Jim Gannon between 2005 and 2009. Ward was also a former Stockport captain, playing for the club in the 1990s. Simpson also employed former coach Stuart Delaney as Youth Team Manager."]}, {"page": "Peter Ward", "response": ["Peter Ward may refer to:", "*Peter Ward (footballer, born 1955), retired English footballer, played for Brighton & Hove Albion and Nottingham Forest", "*Peter Ward (footballer, born 1964), retired English footballer, played for Huddersfield Town, Rochdale, Stockport County, Wrexham and Morecambe", "*Peter Ward (paleontologist) (born 1949), paleontologist and professor at the University of Washington, Seattle", "*Peter Ward (swimmer) (born 1963), Canadian swimmer", "*Peter Ward (rugby union) (1876\u2013?), Australian rugby player", "*Panaiotis, aka Peter Ward, vocalist and composer", "*Peter Ward (athlete) (1913\u20132009), English athlete who competed for Great Britain in the 1936 Summer Olympics"]}, {"page": "1988\u201389 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["|Peter Ward||||FW||1 (3)||0||0||0||0 (1)||0||0||0||1 (4)||0"]}, {"page": "1987\u201388 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["|Peter Ward||||FW||19 (7)||2||2||0||1||0||1||0||23 (7)||2"]}, {"page": "1986\u201387 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["|Peter Ward||||FW||4 (3)||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||4 (3)||0"]}, {"page": "List of Huddersfield Town A.F.C. players", "response": ["|Peter Ward||||1986\u20131989||24 (13)||2||2||0||1 (1)||0||1||0||0||0||28 (14)||2"]}, {"page": "1993 Football League Trophy Final", "response": ["Vale nearly had the game wrapped up before Stockport got back into the game; four minutes after the restart Kerr set Andy Porter free, Porter beat Edwards but Mick Wallace saved the day at the expense of a corner. Substitute Andy Preece was effective right from his introduction, allowing  Kevin Francis more room up front. Francis forced the ball from Vale keeper Musselwhite's hands and forced him into a double save. The mounting pressure from County paid dividends in the 66th minute; on-loan player Peter Duffield guided a ball into the box, which Francis directed it over Musselwhite's head and into the net. Sensing a chance of an equaliser, Stockport stepped up the pace, frustrating their opposition. Kerr was booked for a trip on Peter Ward and in the six minutes of injury-time Swan and Francis went into the book for pushing, after Francis fouled Musselwhite.", "|MF || || Peter Ward"]}]}}
