The local party selected her as its candidate because, though not a dynamic public speaker, Roberts was well-prepared and fearless in her answers; prospective candidate Bill Deedes recalled: \"Once she opened her mouth, the rest of us began to look rather second-rate.\" She attracted media attention as the youngest and the only female candidate. She lost on both occasions to Norman Dodds, but reduced the Labour majority by 6,000, and then a further 1,000. During the campaigns, she was supported by her parents and by future husband Denis Thatcher, whom she married in December 1951. Denis funded his wife's studies for the bar; she qualified as a barrister in 1953 and specialised in taxation. Later that same year their twins Carol and Mark were born, delivered prematurely by Caesarean section."]}, {"page": "Edward Heath", "response": ["Lord Armstrong of Ilminster, who was Heath's friend and former private secretary, stated his belief that Heath was asexual, saying that he \"never detected a whiff of sexuality in relation to men, women or children.\" Another friend and confidant, Sara Morrison, former Vice-Chairman of the Conservative Party, said Heath had \"effectively\" told her \"that he was sexless\". Charles Moore, in his authorised biography of Margaret Thatcher, said that Bill Deedes believed that Thatcher \"seem[ed] convinced\" Heath was gay, whilst Moore believed it is \"possible\" that Thatcher's reference, in interview in 1974, to Heath not having a family, was a deliberate hint that he was gay, in order to discredit him. Thatcher certainly seems to have disliked Heath. \"When I look at him and he looks at me,\" she once remarked, according to Ziegler (Chapter 4), \"it doesn't feel like a man looking at a woman, more like a woman looking at another woman.\""]}, {"page": "Barbara Castle", "response": ["She was admired by Bill Deedes, Conservative politician and editor of The Daily Telegraph, for \"her astonishing tenacity, her capacity for getting her own way in Cabinet and nearly everywhere else,\" though he derided her politics. To her allies, Castle was loyal and would fiercely defend them. Colleague Roy Hattersley credited her with saving his career by insisting he remain her junior Minister when Harold Wilson attempted to sack him. Nevertheless, she remained unforgiving of her enemies; when questioned on James Callaghan in a 2000 interview in the New Statesman, Castle said: \"I think it is safest all round if I don't comment on him.\""]}, {"page": "Michael Morris, 3rd Baron Killanin", "response": ["In November 1938, the young Lord Killanin was commissioned into the Queen's Westminsters, a territorial regiment of the British Army, where he was responsible for recruiting fellow journalists, including future Daily Telegraph editor Bill Deedes, and friends who were musicians and actors. He reached the rank of major and took part in the planning of D-Day and the Battle of Normandy in 1944, acting as Brigade Major for 30th Armoured Brigade, part of the 79th Armoured Division. He was appointed, due to the course of operations, a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE). After being demobilised, he went to Ireland. He resigned his TA commission in 1951."]}, {"page": "Mary Whitehouse", "response": ["The National Viewers' and Listeners' Association (now known as Mediawatch-UK) was launched to succeed CUTV in November 1965, with Whitehouse's then home in Claverley, Shropshire hosting its first office, replacing what they themselves perceived as CUTV's negativity with an active campaign for legislative change.Michael Tracey and David Morrison Whitehouse, p.47 The former cabinet minister Bill Deedes, later editor of The Daily Telegraph, supported the group in this period and was the leading speaker at NVALA's founding conference in Birmingham on 30 April 1966,Thompson Ban This Filth, p.36-37 and acted as a contact between his parliamentary colleagues and Whitehouse.Stephen Robinson The Remarkable Lives Of Bill Deedes , London: Little, Brown (Hatchette Digital) 2008, p.111-12 Quintin Hogg, better known as Lord Hailsham, was another high-profile politician who gave his support to NVALA and Whitehouse at this time."]}, {"page": "Malcolm Muggeridge", "response": ["Muggeridge wrote for the Evening Standard and also for The Daily Telegraph where he was appointed deputy editor in 1950. He kept detailed diaries, which provide a vivid picture of the journalistic and political London of the day, including regular contact with George Orwell, Anthony Powell, Graham Greene and Bill Deedes; and he comments perceptively on Ian Fleming, Guy Burgess and Kim Philby. Muggeridge also acted as Washington correspondent for The Daily Telegraph. He was editor of Punch magazine from 1953 to 1957, a challenging appointment for one who claimed that \"there is no occupation more wretched than trying to make the English laugh\". One of his first acts was to sack the illustrator E.H. Shepard.\"E.H. Shepard\" , Just-Pooh.com. In 1957, he received public and professional opprobrium for criticism of the British monarchy in a US magazine, The Saturday Evening Post. The article was given the title \"Does England Really Need a Queen?\", and its publication was delayed by five months to coincide with the Royal State Visit to Washington, DC taking place later that year. It was little more than a rehash of views expressed in a 1955 article, Royal Soap Opera, but its timing caused outrage in the UK, and a contract with Beaverbrook newspapers was cancelled. His notoriety then propelled him into becoming better known as a broadcaster, with regular appearances on the BBC's Panorama, and a reputation as a tough interviewer. Encounters with Brendan Behan and Salvador Dal\u00ed cemented his reputation as a fearless critic of modern life."]}, {"page": "Ryszard Kapu\u015bci\u0144ski", "response": ["One reviewer saw in Kapu\u015bci\u0144ski's mixing of subtle psychological reflection with vivid description an invitation to a comparison with Joseph Conrad;  Binyavanga Wainaina and Aleksandar Hemon made the same comparison, if for other, less laudatory reasons. Kapu\u015bci\u0144ski confirmed to Bill Deedes the fact that Conrad was one of his literary inspirations.  Neal Ascherson likened him to Egon Erwin Kisch (1885\u20131948) considered the father of literary reportage. Kapu\u015bci\u0144ski himself cites Kisch with approval as the \"classic of reportage\" who dealt a death blow to traditional forms of reporting by putting the person of the reporter at centre stage.  Certainly, neither Kisch nor Kapu\u015bci\u0144ski believed in what might be called \"journalistic objectivity\": whereas Kisch thought it necessary for a (Communist) reporter to \"engage politically\" with his subject, Kapu\u015bci\u0144ski would put objectivity as a concept out of court altogether, stating explicitly, \"There is no such thing as objectivity. Objectivity is the question of the conscience of the one who writes. And he himself should answer the question is this what he writes close to the truth or not\".See: Europa jest na szcz\u0119\u015bie ma\u0142a, z Ryszardem Kapu\u015bci\u0144skim rozmawia Jacek Antczak, \"S\u0142owo Polskie\" 1999, no. 12. Later published in Kapu\u015bci\u0144ski's book Autoportret reportera, Znak, 2003, p. 40. Quote in Polish: \"Nie ma czego\u015b takiego jak obiektywizm. Obiektywizm to jest kwestia sumienia tego, kt\u00f3ry pisze. I sam powinien sobie udzieli\u0107 odpowiedzi na pytanie, czy to co pisze, jest bliskie prawdy, czy nie.\"", "In an obituary published in Der Spiegel, Kapu\u015bci\u0144ski was described by German journalist Claus Christian Malzahn as \"one of the most credible journalists the world has ever seen\". Daniel Alarc\u00f3n, a Peruvian-American novelist, cited Kapu\u015bci\u0144ski as a formative influence together with Dostoyevsky. The American journalist and reportage-writer Richard Bernstein, saw value in the \"penetrating intelligence\" of Kapu\u015bci\u0144ski's vision and in his \"crystallised descriptive\" style of writing.  The British journalist Bill Deedes, who had witnessed the  Rwandan genocide first-hand, said of Kapu\u015bci\u0144ski that what he \"writes about Africa is authoritative as well as captivating. His account of how the Hutus and the Tutsis were drawn into that dark night of genocide in Rwanda is the most enlightening I have read anywhere\" and that he had \"transformed journalism into literature in his writings about Africa\".  Professor Philip Melling of Swansea University has concurred with this opinion, citing Kapu\u015bci\u0144ski as an authority on the Rwandan conflict.Cf.

Wells developed the feature into a stage farce, Anyone for Denis?, first performed in 1981, in which he played Denis Thatcher. Co-starring Angela Thorne as Mrs. Thatcher, the play was a major West End hit, toured the UK and was adapted for television.

Viewing the case for a republic as fairly self-evident and broadly supported by the Australian populace, their advertising concentrated mainly on the positive symbolism of the republican case. The 'Yes' campaign was also viewed as having the support of the popular Australian media; British politician and journalist Bill Deedes said in The Daily Telegraph in 1999: \"I have rarely attended elections in any country, certainly not a democratic one, in which the newspapers have displayed more shameless bias.
