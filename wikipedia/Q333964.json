As a result of the negative publicity, Hogg did not seek re-election at the 2010 general election.\nAside from his hereditary peerage, he was made a life peer in the 2015 Dissolution Honours allowing him a seat in the House of Lords. As a member of the House of Lords he is styled Viscount Hailsham by parliamentary custom, the family title to which he succeeded in 2001.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "February 5", "response": ["*1945 \u2013 Douglas Hogg, English lawyer and politician, Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food"]}, {"page": "Michael Heseltine", "response": ["The matter of a referendum on joining the euro, after much press speculation, was raised again at Cabinet by Douglas Hogg in the spring of 1996, very likely (in Clarke's view) with Major's approval; Clarke records that Heseltine spoke \"with passionate intensity\" at Cabinet against a referendum, believing both that referendums were pernicious and that no concession would be enough to please the Eurosceptics.

In 2001, The 3rd Viscount Thurso became the first British hereditary peer to be elected to the Commons and take his seat.
