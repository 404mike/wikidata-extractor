The conservation ethic that began to evolve included three core principles: that human activity damaged the environment, that there was a civic duty to maintain the environment for future generations, and that scientific, empirically based methods should be applied to ensure this duty was carried out. Sir James Ranald Martin was prominent in promoting this ideology, publishing many medico-topographical reports that demonstrated the scale of damage wrought through large-scale deforestation and desiccation, and lobbying extensively for the institutionalization of forest conservation activities in British India through the establishment of Forest Departments.Stebbing, E.P (1922)The forests of India vol. 1, pp. 72-81 Edward Percy Stebbing warned of desertification of India.

The value of forests was realised very early and forest management was introduced early on the sub-continent. The links between water, climate and forest cover were noted particularly early and warnings on deforestation were sounded as early as 1840 by surgeons in the East India Company like Edward Balfour.Grove, Richard. 1995 Green Imperialism: Colonial Expansion, Tropical Island Edens and the Origins of Environmentalism, 1600\u20131860. Cambridge University Press.  This was to lead to forest conservation measures although the later policies of forest management were aimed at the production of commercial products such as teak timber. The post of a conservationist was created and this term was related to the patches of forests that they managed, called conservancies, and was not related to biodiversity conservation. Even today, vast tracts of Indian forests are covered with teak plantations, low in biodiversity and seasonally ravaged by forest fires. The first foresters in India were highly influenced by forest management in Germany and many forest officers in India were trained in the German school of thought brought into India by Dietrich Brandis (1824\u20131907)-the father of tropical forestry.Barton, Gregory Allen (2002) Empire Forestry and the Origins of Environmentalism. Cambridge University Press  Numerous officers including James Sykes Gamble (1847\u20131925), Alexander Gibson and Hugh Francis Cleghorn in the Indian Forest service added information on the flora of India. Several amateurs also worked alongside from other civil services and they were assisted by professional botanists such as Joseph Dalton Hooker (1817\u20131911), John Gerard Koenig (1728\u20131785), Robert Wight (1796\u20131872), Nathaniel Wallich (1786\u20131854) and William Roxburgh (1751\u20131815), the Father of Indian Botany.Bole, P.

The Quarterly Review of Biology. 51(3):442\u2013443 Another area of interest was the introduction of plants of economic importance to India. Many of these introductions were tried in botanical gardens at Sibpur, Poona, Madras and Saharanpur.Sharma, Jayeeta (2006) British science, Chinese skill and Assam tea: Making empire's garden. Indian Economic and Social History Review 43; 429 The Chinese monopoly on tea was ended when tea was introduced in Darjeeling and Sri Lanka through the work of Robert Fortune (1812\u20131880). The botanical garden at Sibpur in Calcutta was started in 1787 by Col. Robert Kyd (1746\u20131793). Sir George King (1840\u20131904) who was in charge of the garden from 1871 was instrumental in the creation of a herbarium at the garden and founded the Botanical Survey of India in 1890.

In his 1851 British Association report Cleghorn had summarised existing literature and cited anecdotal information from other East India Company surgeons including Alexander Gibson and Edward Balfour. The importance placed by Gibson and Cleghorn on climate-modification (rather than purely economic concerns) as the motivation for their system of forest \u2018conservancy\u2019 is one that has been much discussed by historians of forestry and ecology. Claims by authors, notably Richard Grove in his Green Imperialism, that it was the major motivation of the East India Company surgeon-Conservators have recently been disputed.
