In 1966, he patented personal identification number (PIN) technology and an automated teller machine (ATM). He is generally considered the inventor of the modern ATM.Goodfellow was born in Paisley, Renfrewshire, where he later attended St Mirin's Academy. As a 28-year-old development engineer at Kelvin Hughes, he was given the project of developing an automatic cash dispenser in 1965. His system accepted a machine readable encrypted card, with a numerical PIN keypad. The invention received UK Patent No. 1,197,183 with a priority date of 2 May 1966. In 1967, the world's first ATM was in Enfield in North London, which used a rival design by John Shepherd-Barron of De La Rue that accepted cheques impregnated with a radioactive chemical. De La Rue did not patent the design.In 2005, Shepherd-Barron was widely reported as the inventor of the cash dispenser after he received an OBE. This compelled Goodfellow to publicize his patent. \"[Shepherd-Barron] invented a radioactive device to withdraw money. I invented an automated system with an encrypted card and a pin number, and that's the one that is used around the world today,\" he said. Despite being appointed an OBE in the 2006 Queen's Birthday Honours for his invention of the personal identification number, Goodfellow regrets the lack of recognition and compensation for his inventiveness, since PIN codes are ubiquitous today.Goodfellow was inducted into the Scottish Engineering Hall of Fame in 2016.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Automated teller machine", "response": ["The idea of a PIN stored on the card was developed by a group of engineers working at Smiths Group on the Chubb MD2 in 1965 and which has been credited to James Goodfellow (patent GB1197183 filed on 2 May 1966 with Anthony Davies). The essence of this system was that it enabled the verification of the customer with the debited account without human intervention. This patent is also the earliest instance of a complete \"currency dispenser system\" in the patent record. This patent was filed on 5 March 1968 in the US (US 3543904) and granted on 1 December 1970. It had a profound influence on the industry as a whole. Not only did future entrants into the cash dispenser market such as NCR Corporation and IBM licence Goodfellow's PIN system, but a number of later patents reference this patent as \"Prior Art Device\"."]}, {"page": "Culture of the United Kingdom", "response": ["In 1952, OXO (or Noughts and Crosses), created by computer scientist Alexander S. Douglas, is regarded as a contender for the first video game. In OXO, the computer player could play perfect games of tic-tac-toe against a human opponent. In the 1960s, John Shepherd-Barron invented the cash machine (ATM) and James Goodfellow invented Personal identification number (PIN) technology, and on 27 June 1967, the first cash machine was established outside a branch of Barclays Bank in Enfield, north London.
