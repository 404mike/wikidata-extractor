They also visited \"the old Dr. Duncan\", who spoke with the warmest affection about his student and friend Charles Darwin (Darwin's uncle) who had died in 1778.Woodall, Edward (1884) \"Charles Darwin. A paper contributed to the Transactions of the Shropshire Arch\u00e6ological Society. London: Trubner. p. 18. Darwin wrote \"What an extraordinary old man he is, now being past 80, & continuing to lecture\", though Dr. Hawley thought Duncan was now failing. Darwin added that \"I am going to learn to stuff birds, from a blackamoor... he only charges one guinea, for an hour every day for two months\". These lessons in taxidermy were with the freed black slave John Edmonstone, who also lived in Lothian Street. Darwin often sat with him to hear tales of the South American rain-forest of Guyana, and later remembered him as \"a very pleasant and intelligent man.\"", "With Coldstream, Darwin walked along the shore looking for animals in tidal pools, and became friends with oyster fishermen from nearby Newhaven who took them along to pick specimens from the catches. He went long walks with Grant and others, frequently with William Ainsworth, one of the Presidents who became a Wernerian geologist. As well as the shores of the Forth, he and Ainsworth took boat trips to Fife and the islands. On the Isle of May with the botanist Robert Kaye Greville, this \"eminent cryptogamist\" laughed so much at screeching seabirds that he had to \"lie down on the greensward to enjoy his prolonged cachinnation.\" On another trip, Darwin and Ainsworth got stuck overnight on Inchkeith and had to stay in the lighthouse.Bettany, G.
