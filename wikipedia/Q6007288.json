The injury would keep him out of action for almost a year, with Platt describing the recovery as a mental process as well as a physical one. He returned to action as a late substitute for Nicky Nicolau is Lincoln City's 4-2 Football Conference defeat at Southport on 8 January 2013 but this would prove to be his last action for the club as he left the club by mutual consent on 7 March 2013 with the club's new manager Gary Simpson reasoning that the club's relegation battle meant that Platt was unable to be given the games needed to regain full fitness. Platt immediately joined Gainsborough Trinity on a free transfer, making nine Football Conference North appearances for the club without scoring, before leaving the club at the end of the season having returned to the North-West to live."]}, {"page": "List of British people of Cypriot descent", "response": ["*Nicky Nicolau, football player"]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Barnet F.C. season", "response": ["| 6 May 2009 || ST ||  || Nicky Nicolau || Woking || Released || "]}, {"page": "2005 Football League Two play-off Final", "response": ["The match was refereed by Martin Atkinson in front of 19,653 spectators.  The first 90 minutes finished goalless, and was described by Jamie Jackson in The Observer as \"tepid, uninventive fare\", so the game went into extra time.  The first goal was scored just before half-time in the first period of extra time, when Spencer Prior flicked on Nicky Nicolau's corner and Freddy Eastwood struck Matt Bloomer's clearance into the Lincoln goal.  With ten minutes of extra time remaining, Eastwood ran at the Lincoln defence and passed the ball square to Duncan Jupp who scored his first league goal in a decade to give Southend a 2\u20130 lead.  No further goals were scored, securing Southend a 2\u20130 win and promotion to League One.", "Southend United faced Northampton Town in the second semi-final with the first leg hosted at Sixfields Stadium in Northampton on 15 May 2005.  Both sides had chances to score and although the visitors were more dominant, the match ended 0\u20130.  The second leg took place six days later at Roots Hall in Southend-on-Sea.  The first half ended 0\u20130 but four minutes into the second, Nicky Nicolau was fouled in the Northampton penalty area and Freddy Eastwood converted the resulting penalty.
