Sir William Molesworth, the owner of a young specimen at Pencarrow garden near Bodmin in Cornwall, was showing it to a group of friends, when one of them \u2013 the noted barrister and Benthamist Charles Austin \u2013  remarked, \"It would puzzle a monkey to climb that\". As the species had no existing popular name, first \"monkey puzzler\", then \"monkey puzzle\" stuck."]}, {"page": "Winthrop Mackworth Praed", "response": ["Before Praed left school he had established, over a shop at Eton, a \"boys' library,\" the books of which were later amalgamated in the School Library. His career at Trinity College, Cambridge was a brilliant one. He gained the Browne medal for Greek verse four times, and the Chancellor's Gold Medal for English verse twice in 1823 and 1824. He was bracketed third in the classical tripos in 1825, won a fellowship at his college in 1827, and three years later carried off the Seatonian prize. At the Union his speeches were rivalled only by those of Macaulay and of Charles Austin, who subsequently made a great reputation at the parliamentary bar. The character of Praed during his university life is described by Bulwer-Lytton in the first volume of his Life."]}, {"page": "John Moultrie (poet)", "response": ["In October 1819 Moultrie entered, as a commoner, Trinity College, Cambridge, where he became intimate with Thomas Babington Macaulay, Charles Austin, and others of their set. He played first-class cricket for Cambridge: he is recorded in one match in 1820, totalling 6 runs with a highest score of 6 not out and taking 1 wicket. Proceeding his M.A. in 1822, he spent time at the Middle Temple, but after acting for some time as tutor to the three sons of Lord Craven, he gave up the law and decided to take holy orders; he had an offer of the living of Rugby, Warwickshire, by Lord Craven in 1825. In 1825 he was also ordained, and on 28 July in that year he married Harriet Margaret Fergusson, sister of James Fergusson.", "In 1837 Moultrie issued a collection of his poems, which were favourably reviewed both in the Quarterly Review and the Edinburgh Review In 1843 he published 'The Dream of Life; Lays of the English Church and other Poems.' It is an autobiographical meditation in verse, which contains comments on contemporaries, including Thomas Babington Macaulay, Henry Nelson Coleridge, Charles Austin, Chauncey Hare Townshend, and Charles Taylor. In 1850 appeared 'The Black Fence, a Lay of Modern Rome,' an anti-papal work, and 'St. Mary, the Virgin and Wife,' both of which had several editions. In 1852 he edited the Poetical Remains of William Sidney Walker."]}, {"page": "Henry Taylor (dramatist)", "response": ["Taylor's work also brought him literary friends: the circle of Thomas Hyde Villiers, and his colleague James Stephen. Through Villiers he became acquainted with Charles Austin, John Stuart Mill, and some of the Benthamites. He made speeches in opposition to their views, in the debating society documented by Mill. He also invited them to personal meetings with Wordsworth and Southey. Mill introduced Taylor to Thomas Carlyle in November 1831, initiating a long friendship. Carlyle's opinion of the \"marked veracity\" of Taylor was printed wrongly by the editor James Anthony Froude as \"morbid vivacity\". He also knew John Sterling, and made the acquaintance of Fanny Trollope whilst attending the court of Louis Philippe of France."]}, {"page": "Ipswich Museum", "response": ["* Charles Austin of Brandeston Hall, 1861\u20131874 (High Steward of Ipswich 1849\u20131874)"]}, {"page": "The Club (dining club)", "response": ["* Charles Austin (7 March 1843)"]}, {"page": "Brandeston", "response": ["Brandeston Hall, the largest building in the village, is now the preparatory department of nearby Framlingham College.

The data has no huge anomalies except for one but yet no clear relationship. For example, the one large anomaly in the data is the period from 1831 to 1851. In 1831 there were 64 occupied households yet in 1841 there were 108 before declining again to 66 households occupied in 1851."]}, {"page": "Thomas Hyde Villiers", "response": ["Thomas Villiers was educated at home; he was then sent with his eldest brother to St. John's College, Cambridge. There he mixed with Charles Austin, Edward Strutt, John Romilly, Thomas Babington Macaulay, and others, most of them followers of Jeremy Bentham. In 1822 he graduated B.A., and in 1825 he proceeded M.A. On taking his degree in 1822 he entered the colonial office, where Sir Henry Taylor became early in 1824 his subordinate and then a close friend.
