According to lead designer Colin Gordon, \"The physics are very accurate, and the shocks, brakes, and handling are specific to each car. No car [drives] like another\". The tracks were designed in such a way as to ensure that the game's distance fog and scenery rendering were not apparent. A level editor, which would let players create their own tracks, and a Battle Mode similar to the combat-based races of Super Mario Kart, were originally planned to be included in the game. The developers opted to limit the multiplayer mode to two players because simultaneous four-player racing would have forced them to compromise on either the draw distance or their target frame rate of 30 frames per second. Although Boss did not have licenses to use automobile manufacturing brands, the cars featured in the game were modeled after real vehicles such as the Ford Escort, the Toyota Celica, the Toyota Supra, and the Porsche 959.

The sample is played very quietly during the first few bars, and can be easily accessed in any MOD tracker program.
