He was the Bartlett Professor of Planning and Regeneration at The Bartlett, University College London and president of both the Town and Country Planning Association and the Regional Studies Association. Hall was one of the most prolific and influential urbanists of the twentieth century.He was known internationally for his studies and writings on the economic, demographic, cultural and management issues that face cities around the globe. Hall was for many years a planning and regeneration adviser to successive UK governments. He was Special Adviser on Strategic Planning to the British government (1991\u201394) and a member of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's Urban Task Force (1998\u20131999). Hall is considered by many to be the father of the industrial enterprise zone concept, adopted by countries worldwide to develop industry in disadvantaged areas.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "July 30", "response": ["*  2014   \u2013 Peter Hall, English geographer, author, and academic (b. 1932)"]}, {"page": "March 19", "response": ["*  1932   \u2013 Peter Hall, English geographer, author, and academic (d. 2014)"]}, {"page": "James Rouse", "response": ["Rouse shifted focus from suburban retail to urban malls, which he called \"festival marketplaces,\" of which the Faneuil Hall Marketplace was the first and most successful example. Completed in 1976, and partly funded with assistance from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Faneuil Hall Marketplace (comprising Quincy Market and other spaces adjacent to Boston's Faneuil Hall) was designed by architect Benjamin C. Thompson and was a financial success, an act of historic preservation, and an anchor for urban revitalization. Later the Boston Museum of Fine Arts established an annex at the Quincy Market, and the mall generated more foot traffic than the museum. Initially, there were critics who predicted the project would fail, while other dismissed its early success as a fad. Calvin Trillin and Peter Hall each invoked Disneyland in their claims that Faneuil Hall Marketplace was an example of fake urbanism. Robert Campbell, an architecture critic, rejected this kind of criticism as snobbery, and claimed that the festival marketplace was effective at getting people out of their cars and getting them to experience the city. In his planning for the project, Rouse imagined that people would not just shop, that they would also be entertained. However, he later claimed that he had not anticipated its popularity as a tour bus destination."]}, {"page": "Personal rapid transit", "response": ["Peter Calthorpe and Sir Peter Hall have supportedPersonal Rapid Transit for Heathrow Airport, Dubai Financial Center from planetizen.comSir Peter Hall: \"The Sustainable City: A Mythical Beast?\" Transcript from planning.org the concept, but James Howard Kunstler disagrees.KunstlerCast #13: Personal Transit & Green Buildings  from kunstlercast.com"]}, {"page": "Colin Ward", "response": ["* Sociable Cities: The Legacy of Ebenezer Howard (with Peter Hall) (1999)"]}, {"page": "Laguna West-Lakeside, Elk Grove, California", "response": ["Urbanist Sir Peter Hall, who hailed Calthorpe's plans in a 1994 paper,Abstract only.
