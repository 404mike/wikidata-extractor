A left-arm medium pace bowler, capable of producing swing at a brisk pace, Tomlinson first appeared in senior cricket for the Hampshire Cricket Board in List A cricket in the 2000 NatWest Trophy.  He first appeared for Hampshire in first-class cricket in 2002, at this stage of career he had to work his cricket career around his studies at Cardiff University.  In 2003 he was Hampshire's recipient of the NBC Denis Compton Award.  His early career with Hampshire was beset by injury, which limited his appearances.  By 2008, Tomlinson had established himself in the Hampshire team, mostly as a specialist first-class player.  It was in this season that he became the first Hampshire bowler since Malcolm Marshall to end the season as the leading wicket taker in the County Championship, finishing with 67 wickets.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "June 12", "response": ["*  1982   \u2013 James Tomlinson, English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Cardiff University", "response": ["*James Tomlinson, English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Hampshire County Cricket Club in 2005", "response": ["*  James Tomlinson"]}, {"page": "Hampshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["In the winter of 2015 Hampshire completed the signing of England seamer Reece Topley from Essex. The club also announced that Fidel Edwards had signed a new deal and South African all rounder Ryan McLaren had signed as an overseas player. On 14 January 2016, Hampshire Cricket was announced as one of six new teams in the inaugural Women's Cricket Super League. Hampshire, in partnership with Berkshire, Dorset, Isle of Wight, Oxfordshire, Sussex and Wiltshire cricket boards along with Southampton Solent University, will compete in a women's Twenty20 competition against the other team. On 28 January 2016 Hampshire appointed former Wiltshire coach Nick Denning as their inaugural coach for their Women's team. Following the appointment of Denning, Hampshire announced the naming of their Women's Cricket Super League team as the Southern Vipers. The Vipers then won the inaugural Kia Super League on 21 August, defeating Western Force in the final by 7 wickets. Overseas star Suzie Bates was named as player of the tournament. For the male team though it was a season of disappointment. A large number of injuries at the start of the season, including to fast bowlers Reece Topley, Fidel Edwards, Chris Wood and Ryan Stevenson, coupled with poor form and tough circumstances, after the death of trialist fast bowler Hamza Ali in a drowning accident, and long serving opening batsman Michael Carberry being diagnosed with a cancerous lung tumour, saw Hampshire suffer a poor season, being knocked out in the group stages of both the Natwest t20 Blast, where they missed out on Finals Day for the first time since 2009, and the Royal London One-Day Cup. Their championship season was much the same as in 2015, again making a slow start, but they gave themselves too much to do and were relegated back to Division Two after defeat against Durham on 23 September 2016. However, on 3 October 2016 Hampshire were given a reprieve as Durham were relegated to Division Two after taking up a financial package from the ECB to help with their finances, with their relegation and a points deduction being the fine for taking this agreement. Coach Dale Benkenstein departed as coach for 'Personal Reasons' in mid-July and was replaced by Craig White originally in a caretaker role, before taking over as full-time first team coach in November. At the end of the season, long serving seamer James Tomlinson retired having been with Hampshire since 2002 and making over 150 appearances in all formats for Hampshire. The Winter of 2017 saw Hampshire draw criticism over the signings of Kyle Abbott and Rilee Rossouw on Kolpak deals, with these players giving up international cricket to represent Hampshire. On the field Hampshire again had a mixed season in first class cricket, avoiding relegation for the 3rd season in a row by drawing against already relegated Warwickshire meaning relegation for Middlesex, with Kolpak Abbott taking 60 wickets across the First-class season. In List A cricket Hampshire again missed out on the knockout stages. However Hampshire performed better in Twenty20 cricket, qualifying for their 7th Finals Day in 8 years, although they lost in the Semi-final to eventual winners Nottinghamshire. They also recorded their highest Twenty20 score in their Quarter final victory over Derbyshire scoring 249\u20138, with Pakistan overseas player Shahid Afridi scoring a century.", "| Player Development Manager ||  James Tomlinson"]}, {"page": "Wiltshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["* James Tomlinson \u2013 Hampshire (from 2002)"]}, {"page": "NBC Denis Compton Award", "response": ["*Hampshire \u2013 James Tomlinson"]}, {"page": "Tomlinson", "response": ["*James Tomlinson, English cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of people from Winchester", "response": ["* James Tomlinson, (1982-), Hampshire cricketer."]}, {"page": "2008 County Championship", "response": ["|style=\"text-align:center;\"| 67 ||style=\"text-align:center;\"| 24.76 || James Tomlinson || Hampshire"]}, {"page": "Andover College (Hampshire)", "response": ["* James Tomlinson, cricketer"]}, {"page": "Danny Briggs", "response": ["Briggs was able to force his way into Hampshire's first team virtually from the start of the 2010 season, due in part to Imran Tahir joining Warwickshire, while his replacement, Ajantha Mendis was unable to fulfill his commitment to playing for Hampshire, though the county did draft in the services of Rangana Herath. Briggs' breakthrough season was one in which he achieved great success. In first-class cricket, Hampshire struggled near the foot of the County Championship for most of the season, with Briggs playing in twelve of Hampshire's sixteen County Championship matches. He took 34 wickets in that season, ending the season as Hampshire's third highest wicket taker in the County Championship, behind Dominic Cork (45) and James Tomlinson (46). His performance against Kent in the penultimate match of season was particularly vital, with his figures of 4/93 in Kent's second-innings helping Hampshire secure a win late in the match, which secured their status in Division One of the County Championship for 2011. Though Briggs had a quiet season in List A matches, taking just three wickets in seven one-day matches. It was particularly in Twenty20 matches that Briggs stood out. His debut in that format came during the 2010 Friends Provident t20 against Kent. In what would ultimately be a tournament winning campaign for Hampshire, Briggs took 31 wickets at an average of 14.35. In the semi-final against Essex, he was named man of the match for his economical bowling performance, which saw him take 3/29. Overall, Briggs was the second leading wicket taker during the competition, ending just two wickets behind Alfonso Thomas. His wickets during the tournament were also the most by a Hampshire player in any domestic Twenty20 tournament. In recognition of his performances in that season, he was Hampshire's recipient of the NBC Denis Compton Award."]}, {"page": "Nick Pishos", "response": ["Pishos played a number of trial matches for the Western Australia cricket team in 1999, playing in a South West team alongside future Australia internationals Marcus North, Chris Rogers and Adam Voges.
