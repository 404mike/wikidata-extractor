The group originally consisted of Steve Marriott, Ronnie Lane, Kenney Jones and Jimmy Winston, with Ian McLagan replacing Winston as the band's keyboardist in 1966. The band was one of the most acclaimed and influential mod groups of the 1960s, recording hit songs such as \"Itchycoo Park\", \"Lazy Sunday\", \"All or Nothing\", and \"Tin Soldier\", as well as their concept album Ogdens' Nut Gone Flake. They evolved into one of the UK's most successful psychedelic bands until 1969.", "Lane and Marriott met in 1965 while Marriott was working at the J60 Music Bar in Manor Park, London. Lane came in with his father Stan to buy a bass guitar, struck up a conversation with Marriott, bought the bass and went back to Marriott's house after work to listen to records. They recruited friends Kenney Jones and Jimmy Winston who switched from guitar to the organ. They rapidly progressed from rehearsals at The Ruskin Arms public house (which was owned by Winston's parents) in Manor Park, London, to ramshackle pub gigs, to semi-professional club dates. The group chose the name, Small Faces, because of the members' small physical stature and a \"Face\" was somebody special, more than just a snappy dresser, he was someone in Mod circles as a leader, someone to look up to. A Face had the sharpest clothes, the best records and always was seen with the prettiest girl on his arm.\"", "Shortly thereafter, Jimmy Winston left the band for an acting and music solo career. He went on to succeed as an actor in TV, film and became a successful business man. In a 2000 interview, Kenney Jones said the reason Winston was fired from the band was because \"He (Winston) got above his station and tried to compete with Steve Marriott.\" Winston subsequently said he left the group over conflicts between Arden and Winston's brother.", "Three weeks before, their old label, Decca, released the album From The Beginning, combining old hits with a number of previously unreleased recordings. It included earlier versions of songs they re-recorded for Immediate, including \"My Way of Giving\", which they had demoed for Chris Farlowe, and \"(Tell Me) Have You Ever Seen Me?\", which they had given to Apostolic Intervention.

Lane bought his bass, and went to Marriott's house after work, where Marriott introduced him to his Motown and Stax record collection.

Marriott's friend Annabel, an ex-student from the Italia Conti, came up with the band's distinctive name after commenting that they all had \"small faces\"; the name stuck in part because they were all (apart from Winston) small (none being over 5\u00a0ft 6 in tall), and the term \"face\" in English mod culture was the name given to a well-known and respected mod."]}, {"page": "Tony Kaye (musician)", "response": ["Anthony John Selvidge (born 11 January 1945), known professionally as Tony Kaye, is an English keyboardist, songwriter, producer and manager, best known as a founding member of the progressive rock band Yes.

Marriott had first heard the phrase in 1965 when he, original keyboardist Jimmy Winston and Winston's girlfriend spent time together at her apartment. According to McLagan, Marriott had an extremely Catholic taste of music, deriving inspiration from several artists and sources, and he also says that Buckley \"rapped\" it. He further states that \"Nazz\" was slang for Jesus. The song features a line which alludes to drug use; \"He makes me feel like no-one else could, He knows what I want, He's got what I need, He's always there if I need some speed.\" The phrase \"speed\" is a synonym for the central nervous system stimulant drug Amphetamine. However, in a 2014 interview with Uncut, McLagan stated that it refers to Methadrine, an alternate form of Methamphetamine, which McLagan said was one of \"all kinds of chemicals\" they were using, with him wanting to express about what drugs were being used by him at the time.Here Comes The Nice: Immediate Years box set 1967\u201369 (liner notes pg. 34).
