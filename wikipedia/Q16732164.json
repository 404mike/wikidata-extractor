Maudling's primary instruments are Roland synthesizers when playing live. He comes from a musical family and was classically trained on piano from an early age. He has contributed to three My Dying Bride studio albums, provided session orchestration on material by Sermon of Hypocrisy, and played guest keyboards on a full-length release by the Ukrainian metal band Semargl. He composed music for the video game Adellion. Currently Maudling is a producer and engineer, operating his own recording studio called Waylands Forge Studios in Yorkshire, England.\nAlthough he composes music mostly in the symphonic metal/black metal genres, Maudling's main influences include mostly non-metal bands such as The Police, Tangerine Dream, Queen, Pat Metheny, as well as classical composers such as Wagner, Stravinsky, Tchaikovsky, Messiaen and Holst.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bal-Sagoth", "response": ["Bal-Sagoth was conceived in 1989 by Byron Roberts, in an attempt to form what he called \"a sublimely symphonic black/death metal band swathed in a concept of dark fantasy and science fiction, inspired by the celebrated style of the grand pulp horror and fantasy literature of the 1930s\". Inspired by such writers and artists as Robert E. Howard, H. P. Lovecraft, Clark Ashton Smith, Edgar Rice Burroughs, J.R.R Tolkien and Jack Kirby, Byron set out to create his own dark fantasy universe, with tales told through epic lyrics and music. After several unsuccessful attempts to launch the project, Byron was introduced to the brothers Chris and Jonny Maudling in 1993, who were also looking to form a serious band. This formed what would become the writing core of the outfit. After several months of rehearsing, and following a line up reshuffle which saw the departure of lead guitarist Alistair MacLatchy, the band recorded their first demo in late 1993. The band roster at this point consisted of Byron Roberts on vocals, Chris Maudling on guitar, Jonny Maudling on drums, Jason Porter on bass and Vincent Crabtree on keyboards. The demo attracted the attention of Cacophonous Records, who signed the band to a three-album deal.", "In 1996, Bal-Sagoth released Starfire Burning Upon the Ice-Veiled Throne of Ultima Thule, again recorded at Academy Music Studio in England. The album marked a key shift in the band's sound, now focusing more on the composition and arrangement skills of drummer (and studio keyboard player) Jonny Maudling, as well as the \"storytelling\" aspect of Byron Roberts's spoken-word vocals. Through keyboards, the band incorporated a virtual symphony orchestra as an equal fifth instrument, along with guitar, bass, drums and vocals. This new sound would be expanded and explored on all four of the band's later efforts.", "Rather than tour in support of Battle Magic, the band opted to immediately focus on the writing and recording of their Nuclear Blast debut.  Frustrated with fill-in tour keyboard players, Jonny Maudling decided to focus full-time on composition and live keyboards in 1999, handing drum duties over to Dave Mackintosh (later of DragonForce).", "In March 2006, Bal-Sagoth released their long-awaited sixth album, The Chthonic Chronicles on Nuclear Blast records.  The music was recorded entirely at Jonny Maudling's Waylands Forge Studio, while the vocals of Byron Roberts were recorded once again at the famed Academy Music Studio. Shortly after its release the band recruited a new drummer, Paul Jackson. The album was the band's first in five years, and is rumoured to be their last, although the band have stated that they have no concrete intentions of either recording another album or splitting up, and that various members of the band may soon be announcing side projects.", "In February 2013 it was announced that Bal-Sagoth guitarist Chris Maudling and keyboardist Jonny Maudling had formed a new band called \"Kull\", composed of various members of Bal-Sagoth and unsigned death metal band Dyscaphia.", "* Jonny Maudling \u2013 drums (1993\u20131998), keyboards (1998\u2013present)"]}, {"page": "List of people from Sheffield", "response": ["*Jonny Maudling, composer"]}, {"page": "The Dreadful Hours", "response": ["* Jonny Maudling - keyboards"]}, {"page": "The Light at the End of the World (My Dying Bride album)", "response": ["The Light at the End of the World is the sixth album by My Dying Bride, released in 1999.

Following Robertshaw's departure, only Craighan and Stainthorpe remained as founding members of the band. Hamish Glencross was soon after recruited as permanent guitarist.

For years, he had been seeking suitable musicians with whom he could collaborate to realise his grand vision of forming \"a sublimely symphonic black/death metal band swathed in a concept of dark fantasy/science-fiction and ancient myths & legends.\" However, none of those he approached were willing to commit to the endeavour. In 1993, after several aborted attempts to launch the project, he was introduced to the musician Jonny Maudling and his brother Chris Maudling, who were at that time jamming cover versions with their friends, and who were also looking to form a serious band. Rehearsals followed, and some months later, after a minor line-up reshuffle, the formal inception of Bal-Sagoth took place.
