He is also noted for describing Bell's palsy.\nHis three older brothers included Robert Bell (1757\u20131816) a Writer to the Signet, John Bell (1763\u20131820), also a noted surgeon and writer; and the advocate George Joseph Bell (1770\u20131843) who became a professor of law at the University of Edinburgh and a principal clerk at the Court of Session.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Muscular dystrophy", "response": ["Muscular dystrophy was first described in the 1830s by Charles Bell.

Eleven years later, a French physiologist Francois Magendie published the same findings without being aware of Bell's research. Due to Bell not publishing his research, this discovery was called the Bell-Magendie law.

Magendie studied and produced the first evidence of the cerebellum's role in equilibration to complete the Bell-Magendie law. In 1838, Theodor Schwann began studying white and grey matter in the brain, and discovered the myelin sheath. These cells, which cover the axons of the neurons in the brain, are named Schwann cells after him. In 1848, Phineas Gage, the classical neurophysiology patient, had his brain pierced by an iron tamping rod in a blasting accident.
