However, Stride's murder occurred less than one hour before the murder of the Ripper's fourth canonical victim, Catherine Eddowes, within walking distance, and her act of murder is suspected to have been disturbed by an individual entering the crime scene upon a two-wheeled cart. In addition, both women had been murdered by slash wounds to the throat, leading most authors and researchers to consider Stride to be the third of the Ripper's canonical five victims.Stride was nicknamed \"Long Liz\".

It was later alleged, among others by Stephen Knight in Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution, that Albert Victor fathered a child with a woman in the Whitechapel district of London, and either he or several high-ranking men committed the murders in an effort to cover up his indiscretion. Though such claims have been repeated frequently, scholars have dismissed them as fantasies, and refer to indisputable proof of the Prince's innocence.Aronson, p. 110; Cook, p. 9; Cornwell, pp. 133\u2013135; Harrison, pp. 142\u2013143; Hyde, The Cleveland Street Scandal, p. 58; Meikle, pp. 146\u2013147; Rumbelow, pp. 209\u2013244.

According to the official Court Circular, family journals and letters, newspaper reports and other sources, he could not have been near any of the murders.Marriott, pp. 267\u2013269.
