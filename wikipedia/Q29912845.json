The estate lands included Traitor's Hill, reputedly where members of the gunpowder plot had met to watch the Palace of Westminster blow up, although the rumour is now known to be false. This villa was later to be known as The Holly Lodge and in 1809 a young actress, Harriot Mellon, took over the lease on the property. She married the banker Thomas Coutts in 1815 and enlarged the house and grounds by buying adjacent properties. The grounds were landscaped by John Buonarotti Papworth in 1825. When Harriot Mellon died in 1837 she left the house and her fortune to Mr Coutts' granddaughter, Angela Burdett."]}, {"page": "Yorkshire (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["* 1654\u20131655: East Riding: Hugh Bethell, Richard Robinson, Walter Strickland, Sir William Strickland; North Riding:  Lord Eure, Francis Lascelles, Thomas Harrison, George Smithson; West Riding: Lord Fairfax, John Lambert, Henry Tempest, John Bright, Edward Gill, Martin Lister", "* 1656\u20131658: East Riding: Hugh Bethell, Richard Darley, Henry Darley, Sir William Strickland; North Riding:  Lord Eure, Francis Lascelles, Major General Robert Lilburne, Luke Robinson; West Riding: John Lambert, Colonel Henry Tempest, Edward Gill, Francis Thorpe, Henry Arthington, John Stanhope"]}, {"page": "West Riding of Yorkshire (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|1654 First Protectorate Parliament||Lord Fairfax||rowspan=2|John Lambert||rowspan=2|Henry Tempest||John Bright||rowspan=2|Edward Gill||Martin Lister"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected to the English parliament in 1654", "response": ["| Sir Thomas Fairfax  John LambertHenry Tempest  John Bright  Edward Gill  Martin Lister"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected to the English parliament in 1656", "response": ["|  Henry Tempest  John Lambert  Edward Gill  Henry Arthington  Francis Thorpe John Stanhope"]}, {"page": "2017 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Henry Tempest, 93, landowner (Broughton Hall)."]}, {"page": "Deaths in May 2017", "response": ["*Henry Tempest, 93, English landowner (Broughton Hall), kidney failure.Henry Tempest"]}]}}
