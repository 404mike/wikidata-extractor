Form amarum, published from Slovenia by Zlata Stropnik, Bogdan Tratnik and Garbrijel Seljak in 1988, is illegitimate as per article 36.1 of the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants, as it was not given a sufficiently comprehensive description.

Not all subsequent authors accepted the Hygrophoraceae; Carleton Rea (1922), for example, continued to place these genera within a widely defined Agaricaceae."]}, {"page": "British Mycological Society", "response": ["The British Mycological Society (BMS) was formed by the combined efforts of two local societies: the Woolhope Naturalists' Field Club of Hereford and the Yorkshire Naturalists\u2019 Union. The Curator of the Hereford Club, Dr. H. G. Bull, convinced the members in 1867 to undertake the particular study of mushrooms. While the mycological efforts of the Club diminished somewhat after Dr. Bull's death, the Union of Yorkshire founded its  Mycological Committee in 1892. This Committee attracted the involvement of many eminent mycologists including Mordecai Cubitt Cooke (1825\u20131914), Carleton Rea (1861\u20131946), George Edward Massee (1850\u20131917), Charles Bagge Plowright (1849\u20131910), and others.

Many subsequent authors, however, separated out the rusts and smuts and amalgamated the remaining Auriculariales with the Tremellales. J\u00fclich (1981) also separated out the rusts and smuts, but recognized the remaining Auriculariales as an independent order, placing within them the families Auriculariaceae, Cystobasidiaceae, Paraphelariaceae, Saccoblastiaceae, Ecchynaceae, Hoehnelomycetaceae, and Patouillardinaceae."]}, {"page": "Auriculariaceae", "response": ["The family was established in 1897 by German mycologist Gustav Lindau to accommodate species of fungi having \"gymnocarpous\" basidiocarps (with the hymenium exposed) and \"auricularioid\" basidia (more or less cylindrical basidia with lateral septa).

In 1900, the French mycologist Narcisse Patouillard included the Tulasnellaceae within the heterobasidiomycetes or \"jelly fungi\" and in 1922 British mycologist Carleton Rea placed the family in its own order, the Tulasnellales, within the heterobasidiomycetes."]}]}}
