He is said to have grown up in poverty, and he is described as \"self-taught\". Some critics have discerned an influence of Samuel Scott's works, and also of Charles Brooking. Any such influence is hardly evident.\nAccording to an account by Harry Parker, in \"The Mariner's Mirror\", March 1912, p 85, while Paton was begging  \"on Tower Hill, he attracted the attention of Admiral Sir Charles Knowles (died 1777), who happened to be passing that way, and who, taking a fancy to the boy, offered to take him to sea\".  He was assistant to the ship\u2019s painter on Knowles' ship, gaining knowledge in both painting and seamanship. In 1742, he started working at the Excise Office.\nHis first exhibition was in 1758 on the premises of the London-based Society of Artists, where he continued to exhibit up to 1770. The Royal Academy hosted his works between 1762 and 1780.\nPaton's specialities were marine and naval paintings. He painted naval actions of wars ongoing at the time of painting such as the Seven Years' War of 1756\u20131763 and later The American Revolutionary War, as well as earlier events such as the battles of the War of the Quadruple Alliance which took place when he was a baby. \nThe paintings include many dramatic effects such as battles at night, the shooting of cannons and the effect of bombardments. Paton also painting civilian themes, such as merchant ships becalmed. His \"sublime depiction of the sky\" was considered especially noteworthy. Prints of his works, made among others by French artist Pierre-Charles Canot, made them widely known.\n\nAmong his most well-known works is the Action Between the Serapis and Bonhomme Richard, depicting the confrontation of the British captain Richard Pearson and the American captain John Paul Jones, occurring on 23 September 1779, off Flamborough Head. It ended with an American victory; nevertheless, the painting achieved success when included among the prints published within a year of the battle, while the war was still going on, by James Fittler and Daniel Lerpini\u00e8re. The painting is at present in the museum of the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1780)", "response": ["File:The Moonlight Battle off Cape St Vincent, 16 January 1780.jpg|The Moonlight Battle off Cape St. Vincent, 16 January 1780, by Richard Paton."]}, {"page": "Paton (surname)", "response": ["*Richard Paton (1717\u20131791), British marine painter"]}, {"page": "1767 in art", "response": ["* Richard Paton \u2013 The Battle of Cape Passaro, 11 August 1718"]}, {"page": "Pierre-Charles Canot", "response": ["Canot was born in France in about 1710. In 1740  he moved to England, where he lived there the rest of his  life. He was elected an Associate Engraver of the Royal Academy in 1770, and died at Kentish Town, then just outside London, in 1777.  He engraved a large number of landscapes, sea-pieces, and other subjects after artists including Jan van Goyen, Lorrain and Jean Pillement. Joseph Strutt believed that his best prints were some large plates of maritime subjects after the works of Richard Paton."]}, {"page": "Paton, Richard", "response": ["#redirectRichard Paton"]}]}}
