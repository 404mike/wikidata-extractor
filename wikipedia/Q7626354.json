He took 100 wickets in a season three times, his best year being 111 at 26.75 in 1933. He twice took a hattrick, one of them when he took his career best figures of 9 for 57 against Somerset at Yeovil in 1938. With the bat he took 413 matches before making his maiden century, only three players in history have waited longer. He was an excellent close fielder and took 498 catches in first-class matches, many of them at short-leg.His major overseas tour was with the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) to India and Ceylon in 1926/7. He took 56 wickets at 18.69 including 7-52 against a Europeans in the East XI at Eden Gardens, Calcutta.His brother Ken was a professional footballer with Southampton and Bristol Rovers, as well as a member of Hampshire's ground staff.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hampshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["From 1927, Hampshire declined severely as their stalwart professionals declined and the level of amateur support fell off alarmingly. Only in 1932 and 1948 did they finish above tenth until 1955. With Stuart Boyes and Lofty Herman not fully adequate replacements as bowling mainstays for Kennedy and Newman, the bowling was never strong, and the batting generally uncertain especially when Mead declined from 1929 onwards. In 1937 Dick Moore set the individual scoring record for Hampshire against Warwickshire at Dean Park Cricket Ground in Bournemouth. His 316 took just 380 minutes and contained 43 fours and three sixes. After World War II, Derek Shackleton became an outstanding bowling mainstay well backed up by Victor Cannings, but not until 1955 did these two have enough support to rise the fortunes of the club. In 1955 Hampshire finished as high as third with Shackleton taking 160 wickets and Cannings and Peter Sainsbury around 100, with Roy Marshall was one of the few exciting batsmen of the time."]}, {"page": "Percy Wakefield", "response": ["In a game most notable for Phil Mead's exploits for Hampshire \u2014 he scored 235 and shared in a last-wicket stand of 127 with Stuart Boyes \u2014 Wakefield's own contribution was minimal: he scored 0 and 8, sent down three wicketless overs, and held a catch to dismiss Hampshire captain Lord Tennyson."]}, {"page": "Walter Livsey", "response": ["In 1922, Livsey played 31 matches, with 348 runs at 14.50, 35 catches and 22 stumpings. During this season Livsey forged a partnership of 177 with George Brown against Warwickshire, who had scored 223 in their first innings and bowled Hampshire out for 15. In the follow-on, Hampshire had a lead of 66 when Livsey came in at number ten, however his maiden century, 110* with Brown and later Stuart Boyes, gave Hampshire a 155 run victory. He failed to pass 50 on any other occasions during that season, however."]}, {"page": "Ken Boyes (footballer, born 1895)", "response": ["His younger brother, Stuart was a cricketer who played over 500 matches for Hampshire County Cricket Club and the MCC between 1921 and 1939.Stuart Boyes career profile on Cricket Archive"]}, {"page": "United Services Recreation Ground", "response": ["After the war, Hampshire played Sussex there in 1919, a season which also saw the South play the Australian Imperial Forces, before the resumption of first three matches, then four matches per season being played there.  1920 saw Hampshire's first even double century opening wicket partnership between Alex Bowell and George Brown, with the two compiling a partnership of 204. The emergence of Alec Kennedy and Jack Newman during this period under the captaincy of Lord Tennyson led to stronger Hampshire performances, with Hampshire winning all three matches played at the ground in the 1921 season.  The Combined Services played only their second ever first-class match in that same season against the Australians.  Later in the 1920s, the Royal Navy played first-class cricket at the ground for the first time, against the 1927 touring New Zealanders. The first hat trick at the ground was taken by Stuart Boyes in 1925. Hampshire continued to play at the ground throughout the thirties, at a time when following the retirements of George Brown, Phil Mead, Jack Newman and Lord Tennyson Hampshire were a less successful team.  Hampshire played four matches per season there during the thirties, with the exception of 1938 when they played five matches, before returning to four in 1939. Hampshire record partnership for the fifth wicket was made there in 1937, when Gerry Hill and Donald Walker put on 235, a record which stands to this day. World War II ended county cricket until 1946, and during the war Portsmouth was heavily bombed by the German Luftwaffe during The Blitz."]}, {"page": "Victoria Recreation Ground", "response": ["Though cricket had undoubtedly been played at the recreation ground prior to 1938, it was in this year that Hampshire came across from the mainland to play a first-class match against Northamptonshire in the County Championship, which Hampshire won by 7 wickets, thanks in large part to a century and six wickets from Stuart Boyes.  Hampshire returned the following season to play a second first-class match against Middlesex, which Middlesex won by an innings and 25 runs, following scores of 97 by Jack Robertson and 118 by Bill Edrich.  First-class cricket didn't return to the ground following World War II.  Newport Cricket Club play on the ground today."]}, {"page": "West Hendford Cricket Ground", "response": ["During its limited use as a first-class cricket ground, only one century was scored on the ground, by Jim Parks. During the 1937 match, he scored 140 runs for Sussex. The most wickets taken by a bowler in a match at West Hendford was achieved in 1938, when Hampshire's Stuart Boyes took twelve wickets, including nine in the first innings. Somerset's only success on the ground was in 1936 against Worcestershire, who they dismissed for 60 runs in the first innings, and 77 in the second."]}, {"page": "Boyes", "response": ["* Stuart Boyes (1899\u20131973), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of Hampshire County Cricket Club first-class cricket records", "response": ["|Stuart Boyes|||| 1,415"]}, {"page": "List of people from Hampshire", "response": ["*Stuart Boyes, cricketer, was born in Southampton"]}, {"page": "Maurice Pugh", "response": ["He was a middle-order batsman and made his first-class debut for Northern Punjab against Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) during their inaugural tour to the sub-Continent in 1926/27.
