She is Professor of Developmental Biology at Oxford and a Wellcome Trust Principal Research Fellow. She is best known for her pioneering work in developmental genetics, showing that genetic mutations could be introduced into the mouse germ line by using genetically altered embryonic stem cells.  This discovery opened up a major field of experimentation for biologists and clinicians.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Pearl Meister Greengard Prize", "response": ["* Gail R.
