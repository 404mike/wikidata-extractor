(1838\u20131907) was a prolific English still life and landscape painter who exhibited widely throughout the British Isles. He was active from 1854 to 1904.He was listed as two separate persons in the Royal Academy records, which has caused subsequent confusion. This was added to by the fact that he initially mainly painted still lifes. After 1871 this ceased completely and he painted mainly landscapes thereafter. The abrupt change is seen in a number of exhibition records of his work. These, along with the associated Gravesend work address, show clearly that only one artist was involved.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of British painters", "response": ["*Charles Stuart (1838\u20131907)"]}, {"page": "Charles Stuart", "response": ["Charles Stuart may refer to:", "* Charles Stuart, 1st Earl of Lennox (1555\u20131576)", "* Charles Stuart, 6th Earl of Moray (died 1735)", "* Charles Stuart, Duke of Kendal (1666\u20131667)", "* Charles Stuart, Duke of Cambridge (1660\u20131661)", "* Charles Stuart, Duke of Cambridge (1677)", "* Charles Stuart, 12th Lord Blantyre (1818\u20131900), Scottish representative peer", "* Charles Stuart (1810\u20131892), British Army general and Member of Parliament for Buteshire 1832\u201333", "* Charles Stuart (Canadian politician) (1864\u20131926), Canadian politician and judge", "* Charles Stuart, 1st Baron Stuart de Rothesay (1779\u20131845), British diplomat, Ambassador to France and to Russia", "* Charles Stuart (East India Company officer) ( \u2013 1828), Irish-born British Army General", "* Charles Stuart (1753\u20131801), British general during the French Revolutionary Wars", "* Charles Stuart (1810\u20131892), British Army general and Member of Parliament for Buteshire 1832\u201333", "* Charles Stuart (painter), British painter", "* Charles Stuart (abolitionist) (1783\u20131865), Anglo-Canadian soldier, writer and abolitionist", "* Charles Stuart (rugby union), Scottish rugby union player", "* Charles Stuart (murderer) (1959\u20131990), American murderer", "* Charles Stuart (runner) (1907-1970), Australian Olympic sprinter"]}, {"page": "Charles Stuart (landscape painter)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Charles Stuart (painter)"]}, {"page": "Charles Stuart (still life and landscape painter)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Charles Stuart (painter)"]}, {"page": "Jane Maria Bowkett", "response": ["thumb|Photograph of Jane Maria Bowkett with her husband Charles Stuart, late 1880s", "Born in London, Jane Maria Bowkett was the eldest of thirteen siblings. Many of her sisters became artists as well. Her father, Thomas Bowkett, was a medical practitioner and was active in the Chartist Movement. In 1862 J. M. Bowkett married the artist Charles Stuart, but continued to sign her work using her maiden name. She gave birth to six children, only three of which survived childbirth. The family, however, subsequently prospered, and in the mid 1880s Bowkett and her husband finally purchased an impressive newly built property in Hampstead with a huge galleried studio connected to the spacious house by a barrel-vaulted conservatory. She lived in this home until her death in 1891."]}]}}
