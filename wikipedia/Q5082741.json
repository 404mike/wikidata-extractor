(1838\u20131907) was a prolific English still life and landscape painter who exhibited widely throughout the British Isles. He was active from 1854 to 1904.He was listed as two separate persons in the Royal Academy records, which has caused subsequent confusion. This was added to by the fact that he initially mainly painted still lifes. After 1871 this ceased completely and he painted mainly landscapes thereafter. The abrupt change is seen in a number of exhibition records of his work. These, along with the associated Gravesend work address, show clearly that only one artist was involved.", "link_mentions": {}}}
