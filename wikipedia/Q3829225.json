Jebb founded the Save the Children Fund in 1919 to raise money for German and Austrian children. In 1923 Clara served on the birth control subcommittee of the Standing Joint Committee of Industrial Women's Organizations (SJCIWO) and by 1930 had become chairman of the organisation.Diana Palmer, \"Women, Health and Politics, 1919\u2013 1939: Professional and lay involvement in the Women's Health Campaign\" (PDF), at p. 125 Clara chaired the National Conference of Labour Women at the Kingsway Hall in London where SJCIWO put forward two reports for discussion; on abolition of the marriage bar, and on equal pay for equal work. In Cambridge she worked closely with her good friend, the Homerton College-trained Leah Manning (President of the National Union of Teachers in 1930, elected as the Labour MP for Islington East in 1928 and then for Epping in 1945). Both women were associated with the ragged school set up in a building in Young Street which is now the site of Anglia Ruskin University Music Therapy Department. In the 1930s Clara supported Manning's initiatives in parliament to welcome Basque children to Britain who were seeking refuge during the Spanish Civil War and some of these children were given homes in Cambridge.", "At the end of the First World War Clara joined the Labour Party though she stood as an Independent representing the National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship (NUSEC) in the Cambridge town council election of March 1919.

A bust was commissioned and manufactured but its whereabouts today are unknown.
