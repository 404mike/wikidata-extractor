Like his predecessors, his reign is disputed due to insufficient material available for further verification and study. Sujin's possible lifespan has been suggested to be as early as the 1st century AD, to as late as the fourth century AD, this is well past his conventionally assigned reign of 97 BC\u00a0\u2013 30 BC. Like Emperor K\u014dsh\u014d, Emperor K\u014drei, and Emperor Kaika, historian Louis Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric notes an idea in his book Japan Encyclopedia that Sujin could have lived in the 1st century (AD). This remains  disputed though among other researchers who have been critical of his book. Other researchers have stated that his lifespan was in the third or fourth century. If this emperor did exist, then he may have been the founder of the Yamato dynasty. Historian Richard Ponsonby-Fane suggests that Sujin may have been the first emperor to perform a census and establish and regularize a system of taxation."]}]}}
