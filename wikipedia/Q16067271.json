It is particularly associated with the artist S J \"Lamorna\" Birch who lived there from 1908. The colony included Birch, Alfred Munnings, Laura Knight and Harold Knight. This period is dramatised in the 1998 novel Summer in February by Jonathan Smith, which was adapted for the 2013 movie directed by Christopher Menaul. Lamorna was also the home of the jeweller Ella Naper and her husband, the painter Charles, who built Trewoofe House. The Lamorna Arts Festival was launched in 2009 to celebrate the original Lamorna Colony and today's Lamorna art community."]}, {"page": "Camberwell College of Arts", "response": ["* Ella Naper (artist)"]}, {"page": "Benjamin Williams Leader", "response": ["Leader's paintings are currently exhibited publicly at the Victoria and Albert Museum and Tate Gallery in London, Huddersfield Art Gallery, Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery, and in Worcester (the largest collection of his works in Britain by far), Manchester and other regions in Britain.

The painting is a complex, formal composition in a studio setting. Using mirrors, Knight painted herself and Naper as seen by someone entering the studio behind them both. As an art student Knight had not been permitted to directly paint nude models but, like all female art students in England at the time, was restricted to working from casts and copying existing drawings. Knight deeply resented this, and Self Portrait with Nude is a clear challenge, and reaction, to those rules. The painting was first shown in 1913 at the Passmore Edwards Art Gallery in Newlyn, and was well received by both the local press and other artists. Although the Royal Academy rejected the painting for exhibition, it was shown at the International Society of Sculptors, Painters and Gravers in London, as The Model. The Daily Telegraphs critic called the painting \"vulgar\", and suggested that it \"might quite appropriately have stayed in the artist's studio\". Despite this reaction, Knight continued to exhibit the painting throughout her career, and it continued to receive press criticism. After Knight's death the picture, now known simply as Self Portrait (1913), was purchased by the National Portrait Gallery, and is now considered both a key work in the story of female self-portraiture and as symbolic of wider female emancipation.", "Knight worked with Ella Naper, who was experienced in enameling techniques, to produce a set of small enamel pieces featuring several ballet dancers, which were shown at the Fine Art Society in London in 1915. Censorship during the First World War included restrictions on sketching and painting around the British coastline, which caused problems for Knight, particularly when painting Spring, but special painting and sketching permits available after 1915 allowed her to continue her paintings of cliff-top landscapes. Spring was shown at the Royal Academy in 1916 but later reworked. Several others were completed from studies in the Knights' first London studio after they moved to the capital in 1919. Also in 1916 Knight received a \u00a3300 commission to paint a canvas for the Canadian Government War Records office on the theme of Physical Training in a Camp, and produced a series of paintings of boxing matches at Witley in Surrey. During the war, in 1916, Harold Knight had registered as a conscientious objector and was eventually required to work as a farm labourer.", "* 1915: Fine Art Society, with Ella Naper and Lamorna Birch,"]}, {"page": "List of 20th-century women artists", "response": ["*Ella Naper (1886\u20131972), jeweller & potter"]}, {"page": "List of jewellery designers", "response": ["* Ella Naper"]}, {"page": "Self Portrait with Nude", "response": ["The painting shows a view of the artist in her studio, working on a painting of a nude female model, part of the painting, and the model herself posing for the painting.

She developed a distinct style of portraiture, working with colour in a modern style and often using bright coloured backgrounds. She had three works in group shows hosted by the Society of Women Artists. She painted several portraits of women artists who were based in Cornwall, including Ella Naper and Gertrude Harvey. Her three-quarter length Portrait of an Officer is in the collection of the Imperial War Museum while her portrait of Frank Ver Beck is held by the Royal Cornwall Museum.

No record of a formal art education for Westrup has been identified but it is known that around 1911 she moved, with her artist sister Emily (1870-1960), to Lamorna in Cornwall. Kate Westrup produced oil paintings and drawings, often of animal subjects, and had works shown at the Royal Academy in London, with the New English Art Club and in 1912 exhibited chalk drawings of dogs at the Alpine Club. She contributed illustrations to the 1914 Punch Book of Hunting. Westrup was elected an associate member of the Society of Women Artists in 1923. In the early 1920s, with Ella Naper, Westrup founded the Lamorna Pottery which produced a variety of ceramics and domestic items which were sold through gallery outlets locally and also in Manchester, Liverpool and elsewhere. The Pottery closed after Westrup's death in 1928."]}]}}
