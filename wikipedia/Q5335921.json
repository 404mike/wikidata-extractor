In 1937, his last season as a schoolboy, he scored 102 goals for his school team Loxford, and 128 in total, including a game that saw him score 12 goals, three games where he scored 9 goals, and 8 in another.\nHe first joined West Ham on 3 August 1937 as an office junior, earning 25 shillings a week plus 2/6d expenses. He trained with the team two or three afternoons a week, and went on to join Romford on loan to gain more experience. In an interview with Colin Benson, Chapman recalls one of his first experiences in the West Ham first team, in a war-time game against London rivals Arsenal. \"I played outside right against Arsenal and it was truly a marvellous thing to be on the same field as the likes of George Swindin, Eddie Hapgood, the Compton brothers and the rest. I was 16 and scored in a convincing 6\u20130 win. What a day that was for me\".\nChapman appeared in the second round second leg of the Football League War Cup in 1940, a 3\u20130 win over Leicester, and earned a 30/- (\u00a31.50) match fee for the game. He was also in the squad for the final against Blackburn Rovers, but did not play.\nHe won a winners medal with the junior side in the London Junior Combination at the age of 19.\nHe was given a professional contract in September 1942 but, due to the war and his involvement with the Royal Engineers, he was not available to play for West Ham on a full-time basis until January 1947, although he competed in the Kent League for Gillingham while he was stationed at Chatham. While at Gillingham, he scored 9 goals in one week against Chelsea, and then 7 the next against the RAF. He made a total of 26 war-time appearances for West Ham, scoring 8 goals. He also played for the Royal Engineers All-England XI.\nAfter the war, his opportunities in the West Ham first team were limited by the presence of players such as Eric Parsons, Terry Woodgate, Kenny Bainbridge and Harry Hooper, and were not helped by a persistent back injury. He scored his first league goal during his debut, a home game against Coventry City during the 1948\u201349 season. He made 1 FA Cup appearance against Luton on 8 January 1949. He played his last of 7 senior league games for West Ham the same season, having scored 3 goals for the club.\nAfter leaving the playing staff, Chapman continued his involvement with the club's administrative affairs, and became West Ham's club secretary in 1956, following Frank Cearns' retirement. He was promoted to Chief Executive in 1980. In 1974 he was a recipient of the Football League Secretaries and Managers Association Long Service Award, and also the Canon League Loyalty Award in August 1984. He retired in the summer of 1986 after 49 years of service for the east London club. He returned to Gillingham in an advisory capacity less than a month after retiring, and made a dozen trips to the Priestfield Stadium to help advance the club's administrative systems and matchday organisation. His testimonial match between West Ham and Terry Venables' International IX took place on 9 August 1987. He died in 2002.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Eddie Chapman", "response": ["On 16 December 1942, Chapman was flown to Britain in a Focke-Wulf bomber, converted for parachuting, from Le Bourget airfield.Max Arthur, Obituary: Eddie Chapman , The Independent, 6 January 1998 He was equipped with wireless, pistol, cyanide capsule and \u00a31,000 and, amongst other things, was given the task of sabotaging the de Havilland aircraft factory at Hatfield. After an uncomfortable flight, during which he suffered a nosebleed due to a poorly tightened oxygen mask, Chapman became stuck in the hatch as he tried to leave the aircraft. Finally detaching himself, he landed some distance from the target location of Mundford, Norfolk, near the village of Littleport, Cambridgeshire.", "Chapman was sent to occupied Norway to teach at a German spy school in Oslo. After a debriefing by von Gr\u00f6ning, Chapman was awarded the Iron Cross for his work in apparently damaging the de Havilland works and the City of Lancaster, making him the first Englishman to receive such an award since the Franco-Prussian War of 1870\u201371. However, Nicholas BoothNicholas Booth, Zigzag \u2013 The Incredible Wartime Exploits of Double Agent Eddie Chapman, 2007, Portrait, London () page 224 suggests that as the Iron Cross was only ever given to military personnel, Chapman's \"Iron Cross\" may instead have been a War Merit Cross 2nd Class, or Kriegsverdienstkreuz. Chapman was inducted into the German Army as an oberleutnant or first lieutenant.See Macintyre, 2007, pp 231 with photo and 286. Chapman was also rewarded with 110,000 Reichsmarks and his own yacht.How double agents duped the Nazis BBC 5 July 2001 An MI5 officer wrote in an assessment \"the Germans came to love Chapman\u00a0... but although he went cynically through all the forms, he did not reciprocate. Chapman loved himself, loved adventure, and loved his country, probably in that order\".Smith, Michael.ZigZag, a womaniser and thief who double-crossed the Nazis, The Daily Telegraph, 5 July 2001. While in Oslo he also secretly photographed the German agents who stayed at his safe house.", "After Operation Overlord he was sent back to Britain to report on the accuracy of the V-1 weapon and the Hedgehog antisubmarine weapon. He parachuted into Cambridgeshire on 29 June 1944 and went to London. Here he consistently reported to the Germans that the bombs were hitting their central London target, when in fact they were undershooting. Perhaps as a result of this disinformation, the Germans never corrected their aim, with the end result that most bombs landed in the south London suburbs or the Kent countryside, doing far less damage than they otherwise might have done.Nicholas Booth, Zigzag \u2013 The Incredible Wartime Exploits of Double Agent Eddie Chapman, 2007, Portrait, London (), pp. 280\u201381.", "On his retirement, MI5 expressed some apprehension that Chapman might take up crime again when his money ran out and if caught would plead for leniency because of his highly secret wartime service. As predicted, he mixed with blackmailers and thieves and got into trouble with the police for various crimes, including smuggling gold across the Mediterranean in 1950.Bletchley Park Trust Museum display on Eddie Chapman More than once he had a character reference from former intelligence officers who confirmed his great contribution to the war effort.", "Chapman had his wartime memoirs serialised in France to earn money, but he was charged under the Official Secrets Act and fined \u00a350.

Von Gr\u00f6ning later attended the wedding of Chapman's daughter. Eddie Chapman died of heart failure on 11 December 1997. He was survived by his wife Betty, and a daughter.", "The 1966 film Triple Cross was based on the biography The Real Eddie Chapman StoryMacintyre (2007 revised 2010) p318 co-written by Chapman and Frank Owen. The film was directed by Terence Young, who had known Chapman before the war. Chapman's character was played by Christopher Plummer. The film was only loosely based on reality, and Chapman was disappointed with it. In his autobiography, Plummer said that Chapman was to have been a technical adviser on the film, but the French authorities would not allow him in the country because he was still wanted over an alleged plot to kidnap the Sultan of Morocco.Plummer, Christopher In Spite of Myself: A Memoir 2008 Knopf", "In 1967 French TV (ORTF) produced a short film featuring a brief Chapman interview (in fluent French).
