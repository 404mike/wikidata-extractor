United. Kei Kamara opened his account slamming home a sloppy rebound from a Smith shot on Troy Perkins' goal, Davy Arnaud doubled the lead in the first half with Smith earning the assist. Despite being an official \"sell-out\", the weather kept a large number of fans from seeing new goalkeeper Jimmy Nielsen make his uneventful debut. Nielsen was tested only the one time by the all-time league-leading goal scorer Jaime Moreno but the Danish keeper nicknamed \"White Puma\" responded properly and kept his sheet clean. The second half opened just like the first and Smith got his first goal of the season, easily passing another sloppy rebound into an open net, this time in front of The Cauldron. 15 minutes later Smith's corner intended for Kamara found instead the hand of a defender and referee Kevin Stott pointed to the spot; Jack Jewsbury (late entry to starting eleven) made the best of the situation and gave the home squad a 4-goal lead.", "Colorado became the second visitors to CommunityAmerica Ballpark in 2010 as well staying to open the 2010 U.S. Open Cup later in the week at Stanley H. Durwood Soccer Stadium on the downtown campus of UMKC. The league match-up was hindered by harsh fouls and questionable officiating yet Kei Kamara scored the lone goal and winner off the boot of Ryan Smith from a long distance free kick. Colorado defender Julien Baudet was sent off in the 72nd minute and despite having one of the deadliest strike duos in the league the Rapids didn't trouble Jimmy Nielsen. The Open Cup match started with Teal Bunbury scoring his first professional goal but it would prove to not be enough as Rapids midfielder Wells Thompson would net a Brace ending the Open Cup run before it had even started.", "Traveling to Seattle has proven tough for most clubs in the league, but Kansas City handed the Sounders their first ever home loss in 2009 and appeared ready to duplicate that result. In their first away match of the season the Wizards invited pressure early and it nearly cost them as the Sounders had a handful of half chances in the opening minutes. Young Colombian standout Freddy Montero was denied on the doorstep by the strong right hand of Jimmy Nielsen which marked the end of the Seattle pressure and ushered in Kansas City's possession for the remainder of the first half. Frustrated and maligned James Riley first and Steve Zakuani later picked up careless yellow cards and Swedish International Freddie Ljungberg was held without incident for much of the match. Jimmy Conrad was forced out of the match with injury which left the KC backline lacking age and experience; Harrington (24), Besler (23), Escobar (23), and Espinoza (23). Enjoying much of the ball the Wizards could only muster two shots on goal out of nine, despite having 19 in their first two matches. Ryan Smith and the Wizards created nine corners and nine shots to Seattle's two corners and five shots however the Sounders second shot on goal came in the 92nd minute and found the netting despite an apparent illegal throw-in. Making only his second professional appearance Michael Fucito came on in the 85th minute and got on the end of a throw in from fellow substitute Brad Evans winning the game 1-0. Chance Myers had an immediate counterattack but failed to beat goalkeeper Kasey Keller one-on-one.", "May was shaping up to be a decidedly bad month for the club when undefeated Columbus (5-0-2) made their lone appearance to the CAB. The Crew left home earlier in the week trailing only the surprising Red Bulls in the East but after dispatching New York 3-1 at Red Bull Arena the yellow clad warriors looked unstoppable. Eddie Gaven put himself in a position to break the scoreless draw in the 10th minute as he went 1v1 with Kansas City keeper Jimmy Nielsen but the Dane was up to the task first getting a foot to the shot and then falling directly on top of the rebound (Nielsen won Save of the Week for this save). The first half frustration came to a head just before half time when captain Arnuad hit the left upright after an inspiring built up from Graham Zusi and the lay off from Kei Kamara. The opening 20 minutes of the second half saw the Wizards outshoot the Crew 7-1 of those seven shots, two easily handled Ryan Smith muffs, a Zusi screamer that went just wide, a Jewsbury rocket that had Will Hesmer beaten if on frame, Bunbury shot off target, and a Kamara turn from the top of the circle plus his header from within six yards that found its way over the cross bar- The Columbus shot in those 20 minutes, Emilio Renter\u00eda's game winning header off of a corner kick taken by 2008 MLS MVP winner Guillermo Barros Schelotto. The home loss meant the club had not registered a win in seven straight matches dating back to the April 10 1-nil win over Colorado.", "Expansion side Philadelphia Union brought the worse statistical defense in the league and cured the Kansas City streak of eight matches without a win. Kei Kamara scored his team leading sixth goal (which won MLS Goal of the Week) early in the first half thanks in large part to Ryan Smith's picture perfect pass, Smith then feed Graham Zusi another slick ball to put him behind the backline and the second year backup slotted home his first professional goal. Philadelphia center back Michael Orozco Fiscal received a red card late in the first half which caused the Union to pack men behind the ball and created an incredibly boring second half. This was the final game for the league before the international break structured into the season for the 2010 FIFA World Cup.", "In front of a Kansas City record 52,424 fans the Wizards beat English Superclub Manchester United. Peter Vermes kept the same starting eleven who had sparked the recent good form and it paid dividends immediately as the Wizards pressured high and got stuck in versus the Red Devils. In just the eleventh minute the home side would push ahead as Davy Arnaud was kept onsides by a lazy and slow moving Rafael and he easily tallied past backup Ben Amos. Like they had in the opening moments the club would keep creating serious chances throughout the first half with Teal Bunbury, Kei Kamara, and Englishman Ryan Smith all having good goes of it. While the Wizards were creating chances United was countering with only half chances until Jimmy Nielsen stopped a point blank attempt with his belly and the Wizards were forced onto their back foot, which is where they found themselves in the 39th minute when Ryan Giggs slipped Dimitar Berbatov between the KC centerbacks. Jimmy Conrad found himself a full step behind and on the wrong side of the Bulgarian striker but still made a play for the ball, he got man instead and the penalty was given by American Referee Terry Vaughn- who also gave Conrad an ejection. Berbatov's hesitation step sent Nielsen diving the wrong direction and he easily equalized the exhibition match. Just one minute later Kansas City's leading assist maker Smith crossed a corner into and off of leading scorer Kamara's head that gave the now ten man home side the lead once again. Manchester United fought for the equalizer playing all their starters until the 68th minute and Alex Ferguson decided to even keep playing Giggs and fellow Red Devil legend Paul Scholes the full 90 minutes but the Major League Soccer outfit held their lines and won the match 2-1.", "Returning to league play on the final day of July meant welcoming the third place (in the east) Toronto FC to the ballpark. The visitors came in a little off form and bogged down from fixture congestion in addition to a mistake make in customs that left the side without their match gear. Both sides looked affected by the extreme heat and played rather sloppy for most of the match. Recently acquired Spanish forward Mista had the best chance in the first half when he got through to Jimmy Nielsen alone but was spoiled by the right hand of the white puma. Neither club looked very dangerous as combined they totaled 20 shots; only 5 on goal yet rookie Teal Bunbury took advantage of a mistake in the back and headed a bouncing ball over Stefan Frei for the only goal of the match. Ryan Smith was taken off hurt in the first half, but before, he missed a good scoring chance and Birahim Diop also missed for the home side late in the second half with a chance to send the Canadians home before the whistle, however he mishit the ball and the result was a roller to the keeper. The seven points earned in July were the most of any month to date.", "|align=\"left\"|11||align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Ryan Smith"]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 Southampton F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"| Ryan Smith", "| Ryan Smith", "| Ryan Smith"]}, {"page": "South London derby", "response": ["* Ryan Smith"]}, {"page": "2010 MLS Expansion Draft", "response": ["|Jonathan Leathers||Ryan Smith||"]}, {"page": "Derby County F.C.\u2013Leicester City F.C. rivalry", "response": ["* Ryan Smith"]}]}}
