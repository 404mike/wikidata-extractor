The council believed that the journal could replace the old Bulletin in providing a link between members in intervals between international meetings by publishing association news, and serve a valuable purpose by publishing original articles in the field of epidemiology. Walter W. Holland was appointed the first editor in 1972.  The IJE continues to go from strength to strength.  Between 2001 - 2016 under the editorship of George Davey Smith and Shah Ebrahim, the journal expanded.International Journal of Epidemiology 2012 [cited 2012 09/14]; Available from: http://www.oxfordjournals.org/our_journals/ije/about.html.

The prize is awarded to an epidemiologist of the highest scientific standard. The recipient is honored for his/her scientific achievements that have advanced our understanding of the determinants of a disease of importance for health in populations through a body of research that may involve a series of studies, rather than a single publication. The prize winner is selected by a committee which includes current IEA president, president-elect, past-president in addition to two members appointed by the IEA Council. The prize is presented at the triennial WCE as $30,000 and a special plaque. The first prize has been conferred in 2008 to Prof Nubia Mu\u00f1oz, while the second was awarded to Prof David Barker in 2011. Subsequent winners included Sir Richard Peto in 2014 George Davey Smith in 2017 and Cesar Victora in 2021."]}, {"page": "Lymm High School", "response": ["*George Davey Smith, epidemiologist"]}, {"page": "Doug Altman", "response": ["* Systematic Reviews in Healthcare: Meta-Analysis in Context (2001).
