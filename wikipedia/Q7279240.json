You asked earlier who owned the infobox. By your behaviour, including the non-neutral messages you left at two WikiProjects, and your vocal opposition to numerous similar proposals in the past, you are holding yourself out as a prime candidate. The fact is that musicians' biographies routinely include family information, not just information on their musical careers, and that hundreds of musicians have notable spouses who have their own articles in Wikipedia. Their infoboxes mention their musician spouses as a matter of course (unless they're musicians themselves!), and it is counterintuitive why we should mention the musician spouses of fashion designers, writers, playwrights, artists, models etc., in their infoboxes without being able to \"return the compliment\". Amanda Palmer's music has, if anything, had less obvious influence on Neil Gaiman's writing career than vice versa (he has actually appeared at some of her concerts), yet she is mentioned in his infobox, and he isn't in hers. It just doesn't make sense. Musicians are celebrities. Their spouses are frequently notable. That includes members of Green Day, the Red Hot Chilli Peppers, U2 and The Who, the counterexamples you gave above (apart from those I mentioned above, singer-songwriter Rachel Fuller is the wife of Pete Townshend, and they have collaborated). I'll give you the Foo Fighters, as far as notable spouses are concerned, but even among the Foo Fighters, Chris Shiflett has a notable musician brother, Scott_Shiflett.
