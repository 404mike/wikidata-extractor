He turned professional in 1978 at a relatively late age, and was the European Tour's Sir Henry Cotton Rookie of the Year in 1979. That year he lost a playoff to Mark James at the Welsh Golf Classic. He never came closer than that to winning a European Tour event, though he finished second in the 1983 Kronenbourg Open. His best ranking on the European Tour Order of Merit was forty-seventh in 1981. However he has won several professional tournaments, including one each on the Challenge Tour and the European Seniors Tour, which he joined in 2001.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Vijay Singh", "response": ["| Mike Miller"]}, {"page": "PGA European Tour", "response": ["|align=center|1979 ||  ||  Mike Miller ||"]}, {"page": "Nigerian Open", "response": ["| 1988 || SAF ||  Vijay Singh || align=center|281 || align=center|\u22123 || Playoff ||  Mike Miller || "]}, {"page": "Scottish PGA Championship", "response": ["| 1992 || Paul Lawrie ||  || Cardross || 273 || 2 strokes ||  Mike Miller || align=center|6,000 || ", "| 1989 || Ross Drummond (3) ||  || Musselburgh || 274 || 1 stroke ||  Mike Miller Sandy Stephen || align=center|4,200 || "]}, {"page": "Sam Torrance", "response": ["| Mike Miller"]}, {"page": "Mark James (golfer)", "response": ["| Mike Miller,  Eddie Polland", "| Mike Miller,  Eddie Polland"]}, {"page": "Michael Miller", "response": ["Michael or Mike Miller may refer to:", "*Mike Miller (guitarist) (born 1953), American guitarist", "*Mickey Miller, fictional character on the United Kingdom television series EastEnders, commonly known as Mike Miller", "*Mike Miller, character in the film Air Mail", "*Mike Miller, fictional character in the TV series The Last Man on Earth", "*Mike Miller (singer), member of the band LMNT", "*Mike Miller (athlete) (born 1959), American football player and track and field sprinter", "*Mike Miller (baseball) (born 1989), American baseball player", "*Mike Miller (basketball, born 1980) (born 1980), American basketball coach and former NBA player", "*Mike Miller (basketball, born 1964) (born 1964), American basketball coach", "*Mike Miller (American football coach) (born 1970), American football coach", "*Mike Miller (golfer) (born 1951), Scottish golfer", "*Mike Miller (wrestler) (born 1951), American wrestler", "*Mike Miller (Canadian football) (born 1989), Canadian football defensive back", "*M.
