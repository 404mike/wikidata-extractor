Butcher bought Ray Woods from Wigan Athletic, but was forced to sell the promising young players Steve Livingstone and Tony Dobson, who both left for Blackburn Rovers. Speedie was also sold, moving to Liverpool for \u00a3675,000, following a series of sub-par performances and a poor relationship with Butcher. Butcher then signed Kenny Sansom and Stewart Robson, and the club began to record some better results, recording home wins against Aston Villa, Manchester City and Chelsea, amongst others. By mid-April, with three games remaining, Coventry had moved up to ninth place in the table, but two defeats from their last three games, including a 6\u20131 defeat at champions Arsenal in the final game, saw them finish in sixteenth.", "| Ray Woods"]}]}}
