He played for Bolton Wanderers from 1947 to 1961, and six matches for the England national team in 1958, including all four matches in the 1958 FIFA World Cup. He got his opportunity in the England team because of the death of incumbent left-back Roger Byrne in the Munich Air Disaster in February 1958. Despite strong performances in the World Cup, he made only a single appearance for England after the tournament, as he was hampered by a persistent hamstring injury which ultimately curtailed his career. As recounted in Declan Hill's book The Fix, Banks also had a small but influential role in the fight to acquire better pay and conditions for football players in the 1961 labour dispute with the Football League. He also played non-League football for Altrincham.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bangor City F.C.", "response": ["*  Tommy Banks (1963\u201367) 6 England caps"]}, {"page": "England national football team records and statistics", "response": [": Tommy Banks, 6, 18 May 1958 \u2013 4 October 1958"]}, {"page": "Tom Banks", "response": ["Thomas, Tom, or Tommy Banks may refer to:", "*Tommy Banks (1936\u20132018), Canadian composer/conductor", "*Tommy Banks (American football) (born  1979), former American football fullback", "*Tommy Banks (footballer) (born 1929), English footballer", "*Tommy Banks (chef) (born 1989), British chef"]}, {"page": "1958 FA Cup Final", "response": ["|LB ||3 || Tommy Banks"]}, {"page": "Banks (surname)", "response": ["*Tommy Banks (born 1929), English footballer (Bolton Wanderers) ", "*Tommy Banks (1936\u20132018), Canadian musician and politician"]}, {"page": "List of people from Bolton", "response": ["*Tommy Banks (born 1929) \u2013 Bolton Wanderers and England footballer, born in FarnworthFamous Boltonians beginning with B  including Tommy Banks.
