Bradley joined the London, Midland and Scottish Railway as a junior clerk in the Goods Depot at Kettering in 1941. He became a railway clerk at Oundle and was national treasurer of the clerks' union, the Transport Salaried Staffs' Association from 1961, its president from 1964 to 1977, and was its acting General Secretary for four months in 1977 after the retirement of the previous General Secretary (David MacKenzie) on health grounds. He served as a councillor on Northamptonshire County Council from 1952 and as an alderman from 1961.\nBradley contested Rutland and Stamford as a Labour candidate in 1950, 1951 and 1955, and Preston South in 1959. He was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Leicester North East at a 1962 by-election, representing Leicester East from 1974. He served as parliamentary private secretary to the Home Secretary from 1966.\nOn 20 February 1981 Bradley announced he would not seek to contest his seat again as a Labour Candidate. He claimed that the Party's National Executive Committee and the Party Conference were \"knocking the living daylights out of decent, well established party practices\" and said he would be morally compelled to join any new party formed by the Council for Social Democracy which had been created by the Gang of Four the previous month. The same day three other supporters of the Council for Social Democracy resigned the Labour whip. Unsurprisingly Bradley was among the Labour MPs who defected to the new Social Democratic Party which emerged from the Council for Social Democracy in March 1981.\nIn 1983, he stood for re-election in Leicester East but came third with 21% of the vote.  This however may have had the effect of helping the Conservative candidate Peter Bruinvels beat the future Labour minister Patricia Hewitt by 933 votes. He died in Kettering aged 76.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1983 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Tom BradleyElected as a Labour MP"]}, {"page": "Transport Salaried Staffs' Association", "response": [":1977: Tom Bradley (acting)", ":1964: Tom Bradley"]}, {"page": "Tom Bradley", "response": ["Thomas or Tom Bradley may refer to:", "*Tom Bradley (American politician) (1917\u20131998), mayor of Los Angeles, California, 1973\u20131993", "*Tom Bradley (British politician) (1926\u20132002), British Member of Parliament and trade union leader", "*Tom Bradley (author) (born 1954), American novelist and essayist", "*Tom Bradley (baseball) (born 1947), former American Major League baseball player", "*Tom Bradley (American football) (born 1956), American football coach and former player", "*Tom Bradley International Terminal, an airport terminal at Los Angeles International Airport named after the above Los Angeles mayor"]}, {"page": "Leicester East (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| rowspan=\"2\"| Tom Bradley"]}, {"page": "1982 Social Democratic Party leadership election", "response": ["* Tom Bradley"]}, {"page": "List of Social Democratic Party (UK) MPs", "response": ["| Tom Bradley"]}, {"page": "Tom Bradley (British politician and trade unionist)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Tom Bradley (British politician)"]}, {"page": "Tom G.
