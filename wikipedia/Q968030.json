They had previously employed Gaspar Lawal, Bill Bruford, and Preston Heyman for the position, but each operated in an unofficial capacity. Moroccan Roll was released in April 1977 and peaked at No. 37 in the UK and No. 125 in the US. With Collins leaving the group for other commitments, Kenwood Dennard of Pat Martino's group was recruited in New York City in time for their 32-date US tour in May and June 1977.

It was put down on 8-track Ampex tape. The first parts put down were the drum machine and percussion tracks with assistance from Phillips's friend Richard Scott, who is credited in the liner notes for helping with production and engineering. Scott also listened to rough mixes of the tracks that Phillips had completed for feedback. The keyboards were recorded after, and the basic tracks had been put to tape by January 1981. Phillips then decided that music needed further parts and overdubs, but there was insufficient space on the 8-track recording. The recorded parts were then transferred onto 24-track tape at Atmosphere Studios in London where recording engineer Chris David painstakingly reassembled the various sections of the piece by hand, cutting pieces of tape off when required. David then made a master tape, making more edits for 1984 than any other studio project he had worked on as Phillips had recorded the album in sections between 20 and 60 seconds in length, \"more or less in order which helped with the assembly\", but he recalled mistakes made and a restart in the process. To track what parts were recorded onto which track, David recalled a \"film-style cue sheet approach\" to avoid losing place. David's efforts for 1984 required him to cut short his honeymoon in Kenya. Phillips used a Roland CR-78 drum machine, and borrowed percussion instruments from Phil Collins. He arranged a session with Morris Pert to record the percussive sections, all of which were put down in one day. It was then mixed at Atmosphere Studios in February and March 1981.", "*Morris Pert \u2013 percussion (tympani, tambourine, gong, congas, bell tree, vibraslap, marimba, vibes)"]}, {"page": "Smallcreep's Day (album)", "response": ["Among the new experiences Rutherford faced in making Smallcreep's Day was picking a group of musicians to perform the music and explaining the different parts to them which he said was \"an unbelievable amount of work\". He did not know many potential candidates, and invited drummer Simon Phillips to play based on his reputation and his capability of handling the \"very fast and furious\" parts, yet unsure of his approach for simple beats. In a rehearsal session, Rutherford recalled that the drummer demonstrated he could handle all the material after the first few bars had been played. Despite planning a rehearsal period of three weeks, Rutherford said it was cut short to three days as Phillips had learnt the parts quickly. Rutherford also enlisted his longtime friend and original Genesis guitarist Anthony Phillips on keyboards, who had taken further music and piano lessons since his departure from the band in 1970. Rutherford felt he was an obvious choice as his style complemented his songwriting. With the addition of Morris Pert on percussion, the backing tracks were put down prior to the lead vocals. Rutherford deemed his voice unsuitable for singing, and sought a vocalist. The original plan was to have Chris Thompson from Manfred Mann's Earth Band do the vocals, but Rutherford thought his voice was too well known and the singer was unavailable due to other commitments. Rutherford then acquired Noel McCalla of Sniff 'n' the Tears who was once considered as the replacement for Genesis singer and frontman Peter Gabriel after he left the group in 1975. Rutherford played all lead and bass guitars on the album which included an acoustic 6-string Ovation, an electric 12-string Alvarez, his custom made Shergold double neck bass, a Fender Stratocaster for lead parts, an Ibanez, and a Roland guitar synthesiser, from which he acquired a string sound that reminded him of a Polymoog synthesiser.
