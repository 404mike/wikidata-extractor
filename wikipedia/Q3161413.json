In 1949, she described \"a rare form of Ascophyllum nodosum\" she found at Larne Lough. She was publishing her research as late as 1960, when she updated a coastal survey of Larne Lough, and reported on the appearance of Datura stramonium in Ireland."]}, {"page": "Margaret Williamson Rea", "response": ["Margaret Williamson Rea was born in Belfast in 1875, the eldest daughter of Robert and Eleanor Rea.

She published a number of papers in the New Phytologist and Protoplasma, two co-authored with Prof. James Small; another was based on her masters thesis, Stomata and Hydathodes in Campanula rotundifolia L., and their Relations to Environment, and in it she acknowledges Professor R. H. Yapp, \"at whose suggestion the work was commenced\". She also co-authored at least one paper with Margarita D. Stelfox.
