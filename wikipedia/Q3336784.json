He reluctantly accepted, insisting that he be allowed to quit the post if an opportunity for active duty should arise. His fame extended beyond the Admiralty; he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society and awarded the Copley Gold Medal for completing his second voyage without losing a man to scurvy. Nathaniel Dance-Holland painted his portrait; he dined with James Boswell; he was described in the House of Lords as \"the first navigator in Europe\". But he could not be kept away from the sea. A third voyage was planned, and Cook volunteered to find the Northwest Passage. He travelled to the Pacific and hoped to travel east to the Atlantic, while a simultaneous voyage travelled the opposite route."]}, {"page": "Joshua Reynolds", "response": ["In the Battle of Ushant against the French in 1778, Lord Keppel commanded the Channel Fleet and the outcome resulted in no clear winner; Keppel ordered the attack be renewed and was obeyed except by Sir Hugh Palliser, who commanded the rear, and the French escaped bombardment. A dispute between Keppel and Palliser arose and Palliser brought charges of misconduct and neglect of duty against Keppel and the Admiralty decided to court-martial him. On 11 February 1779 Keppel was acquitted of all charges and became a national hero. One of Keppel's lawyers commissioned Sir Nathaniel Dance-Holland to paint a portrait of Keppel but Keppel redirected it to Reynolds. Reynolds alluded to Keppel's trial in the painting by painting his hand on his sword, reflecting the presiding officer's words at the court-martial: \"In delivering to you your sword, I am to congratulate you on its being restored to you with so much honour\".McIntyre, pp. 350\u2013353."]}, {"page": "May 8", "response": ["*1735 \u2013 Nathaniel Dance-Holland, English painter and politician (d. 1811)"]}, {"page": "October 15", "response": ["*1811 \u2013 Nathaniel Dance-Holland, English painter and politician (b. 1735)"]}, {"page": "List of artworks on stamps of the United States", "response": ["|| 1732 || 1978 || || || James Cook portrait || Nathaniel Dance-Holland ||"]}, {"page": "1811 in art", "response": ["*October 15 \u2013 Sir Nathaniel Dance-Holland, English portrait painter and politician (born 1735)"]}, {"page": "Charles Seymour, 6th Duke of Somerset", "response": ["Charles was educated at Harrow School and Trinity College, Cambridge, where his portrait by Nathaniel Dance-Holland survives in the college's collection."]}, {"page": "George Dance the Younger", "response": ["* 143 Piccadilly for his brother Nathaniel Dance-Holland (his brother changed his name) (1807)"]}, {"page": "Francis Hayman", "response": ["He was an able teacher.
