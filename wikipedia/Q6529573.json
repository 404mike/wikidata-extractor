He has published 4 books and over 100 refereed journal publications and his theoretical and experimental work on software systems failure can be found in IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, IEEE Computer, IEEE Software, Nature, and IEEE Computational Science and Engineering. His book Safer C pioneered the use of safer language subsets in commercial embedded control systems.  He was also cited amongst the leading scholars of systems and software engineering by the Journal of Systems and Software for the period 1997\u20132001.\nPrimarily a computer scientist nowadays, he retains wide interests and has published recently on artificial complexity in mobile phone charging, the aerodynamics of javelins and novel bibliographic search algorithms for unstructured text to extract patterns from defect databases.After spending most of his career in industry working for Oakwood Computing Associates, he is currently a professor of Forensic Software Engineering at Kingston University, London.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of computer scientists", "response": ["* Les Hatton \u2013 software failure and vulnerabilities"]}, {"page": "Schlumberger brothers", "response": ["In 1955, in recognition of Conrad Schlumberger's outstanding contribution to exploration geophysics, The European Association of Exploration Geophysicists (now European Association of Geoscientists and Engineers) established a Conrad Schlumberger Award.
