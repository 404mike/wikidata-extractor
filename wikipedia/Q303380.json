He was the first artist in the New World to create an extensive series of insect drawings and to show insects in all stages of development. In addition to more than 3,000 insect illustrations, he also produced drawings of birds and plants. To facilitate his work he collected a great number of insects and reared thousands more. He was considered one of the best insect illustrators of his era and his art and insect collections were sold to an eager market in London.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Abbott (disambiguation)", "response": ["John Abbott (1821\u20131893) was Prime Minister of Canada, 1891\u20131892.", "John Abbott or Abbot may also refer to:", "*John Abbott (actor) (1905\u20131996), stage name of John Kefford, British character actor", "*John Abbott (Newfoundland politician) (1874\u20131947), Newfoundland politician", "*John Abbott (St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador politician), Newfoundland and Labrador provincial politician ", "*John Abbott (rugby league) (born 1953), Australian New South Wales rugby league footballer who played in the 1970s", "*John Abbott, a pen-name of author Evan Hunter (1926\u20132005)", "*John Abbot (poet) (1587/8\u2013c. 1650), English Roman Catholic clergyman and poet", "*John Abbot (entomologist) (1751\u20131840/1), American entomologist and ornithologist", "*John Abbott (The Young and the Restless), a character on the soap opera The Young and the Restless", "*John Abbott (1937-2011), art dealer, of Abbott and Holder", "*John Abbott College, Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, Quebec, named after the Prime Minister", "*John Abbott House, located at Abbottstown, in Adams County, Pennsylvania"]}, {"page": "Screven County, Georgia", "response": ["* John Abbot, naturalist, entomologist, wrote The Natural History of the Rarer Lepidopterous Insects of Georgia"]}, {"page": "List of ornithologists", "response": ["*John Abbot \u2013 US"]}, {"page": "James Edward Smith", "response": ["In 1797 Smith published The Natural History of the Rarer Lepidopterous Insects of Georgia, the earliest book on North American insects.
