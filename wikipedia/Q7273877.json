Whybray read French and Theology at Oxford and was ordained as priest in the Church of England.After a number of minor teaching posts, he held the position of Professor of Old Testament and Hebrew at Central Theological College, Tokyo, 1952\u20131965. He returned to Oxford in 1960\u201361 to prepare for a DPhil under G. R. Driver, his thesis subsequently being published as Wisdom in Proverbs: The Concept of Wisdom in Proverbs 19. In 1965 he became lecturer in Theology in the University of Hull, becoming Professor of Hebrew and Old Testament Studies in 1978.

Whereas Isaiah 1\u201339 (referred to as Proto-Isaiah) saw the destruction of Israel as imminent, and the restoration in the future, Deutero-Isaiah speaks of the destruction in the past (), and the restoration as imminent (). Notice, for example, the change in temporal perspective from (), where the Babylonian captivity is cast far in the future, to (), where the Israelites are spoken of as already in Babylon. According to scholar R. N. Whybray, the author of Deutero-Isaiah (chapters 40\u201355) was mistaken for he thought that Cyrus would destroy Babylon but he did not. Cyrus made it more splendid than ever. But he did allow the Jewish exiles to return home, though not in the triumphant manner which Deutero-Isaiah expected."]}, {"page": "Instruction of Amenemope", "response": ["R. N. Whybray, who at one point supported the majority position, changed sides during the 1990s and cast doubt on the relationship between Amenemope and Proverbs, while still acknowledging certain affinities. He argued, in part, that only some of the topics in the Egyptian text can be found in Proverbs 22:17\u201324:22 and that their sequence differs.Whybray Proverbs 1995, 78\u201384; Whybray Composition 1994, 132\u2013145; Whybray \"Structure\" 1994.  J. A. EmertonEmerton 2001. and Nili ShupakShupak 2005. have subsequently argued strongly against Whybray's conclusions. John Ruffle takes a more conservative approach: \"The connection so casually assumed is often very superficial, rarely more than similarity of subject matter, often quite differently treated and does not survive detailed examination. I believe it can merit no more definite verdict than 'not proven' and that it certainly does not exist to the extent that is often assumed\", and \"The parallels that I have drawn between [the huehuetlatolli of the Aztecs], (recorded by Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan in the 1500s) and ancient Near Eastern wisdom are in no way exhaustive, but the fact that they can be produced so easily underlines what should be obvious anyway, that such precepts and images are universally acceptable and hence that similar passages may occur in Proverbs and Amenemope simply by coincidence.\"John Ruffle, \"The Teaching of Amenemope and its Connection with the Book of Proverbs ,\" Tyndale Bulletin 28 (1977): 29\u201368.

Friedman's book is thus in one sense an answer to these critics, and perhaps especially to R. N. Whybray, whose 1987 The Making of the Pentateuch had concluded that the tools by which the documentary model distinguished its supposed documents were fundamentally faulty: how could they suppose, he asked, that the authors of each of the four so-called source documents had not tolerated inconsistency, but that the two redactors had had no problems with it?"]}, {"page": "The Making of the Pentateuch", "response": ["The Making of the Pentateuch (\"The Making of the Pentateuch: A Methodological Study\", JSOT Press, Sheffield, 1987) by R.
