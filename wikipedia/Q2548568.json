Having an interest in mechanics he transferred to the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) in 1913 at which time he first came into regular contact with aircraft. At the outbreak of war in 1914 he flew as an observer before training as a fighter pilot in 1916.\nMcCudden claimed his first victory in September 1916. He claimed his fifth victory\u2014making him an ace\u2014on 15 February 1917. For the next six months he served as an instructor and flew defensive patrols over London. He returned to the frontline in summer 1917. That same year he dispatched a further 31 enemy aircraft while claiming multiple victories in one day on 11 occasions.\nWith his six British medals and one French, McCudden received more awards for gallantry than any other airman of British nationality serving in the First World War. He was also one of the longest serving. By 1918, in part due to a campaign by the Daily Mail newspaper, McCudden became one of the most famous airmen in the British Isles.\nAt the time of his death, he had achieved 57 aerial victories, placing him seventh on the list of the war's most successful aces. Just under two-thirds of his victims can be identified by name. This is possible since, unlike other Allied aces, a substantial proportion of McCudden's claims were made over Allied-held territory. The majority of his successes were achieved with 56 Squadron RFC and all but five were shot down while McCudden was flying the S.E.5a.\nOn 9 July 1918, McCudden was killed in a flying accident when his aircraft crashed following possible engine failure. His rank at the time of his death was major, a significant achievement for a man who had begun his career in the RFC as an air mechanic.

James McCudden, an ace pilot and former RFC mechanic, was famous for his prolific fine-tuning of his aircraft in order to produce improved performance from it; McCudden was able to increase the top speed by 9\u00a0mph and to raise the service ceiling from the standard 17,000\u00a0ft to 20,000\u00a0ft.

According to fellow ace and Victoria Cross recipient James McCudden, \"it was quite a work of art to pull this gun down and shoot upwards, and at the same time manage one's machine accurately\". Ball was as much a loner on the ground as in the air, preferring to stay in his hut on the flight line away from other squadron members. His off-duty hours were spent tending his small garden and practising the violin. Though not unsociable per se, he was extremely sensitive and shy. Ball acted as his own mechanic on his aircraft and, as a consequence, was often untidy and dishevelled. His singularity in dress extended to his habit of flying without a helmet and goggles, and he wore his thick black hair longer than regulations generally permitted.", "On 19 February 1917, in a tribute from his native city, Ball became an Honorary Freeman of Nottingham.
