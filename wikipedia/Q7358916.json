He was one of the founders of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament.The elder son of Ernest, first Lord Simon and Shena, Lady Simon, he inherited the title on his father's death in 1960. Although he never renounced the title, he did not use it.\nAfter Gresham's School, Holt, Norfolk, where he was a contemporary of James Klugmann, Benjamin Britten and Donald Maclean, Simon read economics at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. While there he was invited to join the Political Economy Club run by John Maynard Keynes. At one of the club's meetings, Piero Sraffa, a friend of Antonio Gramsci, advised him to read Karl Marx, and Simon later joined the Communist Party, as his brother Brian Simon had done earlier.  Simon was influenced in this decision by meeting Emile Burns on the boat to the Soviet Union in 1936 - a trip with his parents.\nIn 1935, he qualified as a solicitor, and from 1942 to 1945 he served in the Royal Signals. He went for officer training at Catterick, where he met the Marxist Arnold Kettle, later a close friend.\nFrom 1945 to 1946, he taught law at Welbeck Abbey, where soldiers with three years' service could have a month's free education. At Welbeck he met Edmund Penning-Rowsell, another communist who became a lifelong friend and fellow wine enthusiast.\nFrom 1946 to 1958, he worked for Ealing Borough Council as a solicitor. He married Daphne May in 1951 and they had two children.  He had a love of walking and often visited the Lake District.\nIn 1958 he joined the Labour Research Department, becoming secretary from 1965 to 1977 but continued doing work for the organisation until just before his death. He published many pamphlets and articles on economic issues. Within the Communist Party, where he sat on the Economic Committee, he strongly supported the \"Eurocommunist\" philosophy.  He was also on the board of Lawrence and Wishart and encouraged the publication of \"Selections from the Prison Notebooks of Antonio Gramsci\" in 1971.\nHis last ten years were devoted to red-green politics.\nHe was a member of the William Morris Society.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Baron Simon of Wythenshawe", "response": ["*Roger Simon, 2nd Baron Simon of Wythenshawe (1913\u20132002)"]}, {"page": "Roger Simon", "response": ["* Roger Simon, 2nd Baron Simon of Wythenshawe (1913-2002), solicitor and left wing journalist and political activist"]}, {"page": "Communist Party of Great Britain", "response": ["* Roger Simon, 2nd Baron Simon of Wythenshawe"]}]}}
