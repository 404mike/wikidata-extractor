Thomas was born at Croydon, Surrey, England, daughter of Thomas Cook, shipowner. Her date of birth is often cited incorrectly as 1843 and she was herself inconsistent about both her age and date of birth. It has also been discovered that she was originally named Margaret Cook and only later changed her surname to her father's first name.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "New English Art Club", "response": ["*Margaret Thomas"]}, {"page": "List of Australian artists", "response": ["* Margaret Thomas (1842\u20131929): English-born Australian travel writer, poet and artist"]}, {"page": "Douglas Sladen", "response": ["Educated at Temple Grove School, East Sheen,Current Opinion, vol. 6 (1891), p. 23 Cheltenham College, and Trinity College, Oxford, in 1879 Sladen migrated to Australia, where he became the first professor of history in the new University of Sydney.

He was a competent sculptor in a dull and uninspiring period of English art, and comparatively little of his work has lasting qualities. His 'Burke and Wills group' at Melbourne is a sound and dignified piece of work, his frieze of putti on the old Bank of New South Wales building, now in the University of Melbourne grounds, is charming, and the recumbent figure of Lady Macleay at Godstone, Surrey, is also meritorious. Personally Summers was modest, and his willingness to see ability in the work of other artists was a good influence in the early time of art in Victoria. Several examples of his work together with his portrait of Margaret Thomas are in the historical collection at the National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne. Summers is also represented in the Adelaide gallery and at the Mitchell Library, Sydney. Summers married when a young man; his son, Charles Francis Summers, who survived him, was also a sculptor.", "* NGV: Portrait of the artist as hero: Margaret Thomas\u2019s portraits of Charles Summers"]}, {"page": "Thomas (surname)", "response": ["*Margaret Thomas (disambiguation), multiple people", "**Margaret Thomas (1842\u20131929), British-born Australian travel writer, poet and artist", "**Margaret Thomas (hymnwriter) (born 1779), Welsh hymnwriter", "**Margaret Thomas (painter) (1916\u20132016), British artist", "**Margaret Thomas (sport shooter) (born 1953), British sport shooter"]}, {"page": "Ingram Collection of Modern British Art", "response": ["*Margaret Thomas"]}, {"page": "English Female Artists", "response": ["Maria Burt, Grace Cruickshank, Annie Dixon, Charlotte Grace Dixon, Ellen Hill, Ellen Montalba, Margaret Tekusch, Margaret Thomas"]}, {"page": "List of Australian women artists", "response": ["*Margaret Thomas (1842\u20131929), painter, writer"]}, {"page": "List of Australian women writers", "response": ["*Margaret Thomas (1843\u20131929), travel writer, poet and artist"]}, {"page": "Margaret Thomas (painter)", "response": ["Margaret Thomas (26 September 1916 \u2013 27 March 2016) was a British painter.
