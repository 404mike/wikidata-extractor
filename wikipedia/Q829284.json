Finniston also recommended the implementation schemes to increase the number of engineering and science students and attract more women and young people into the profession.  This included the Women into Science and Engineering Campaign (WISE), established in 1984 under the leadership of Beryl Platt, Baroness Platt of Writtle, as a recommendation of the Finniston Report.
