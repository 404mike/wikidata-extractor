S. Good (1 July 1875 \u2013 after 1904), sometimes known as Micky Good, was a Scottish professional footballer who made 71 appearances in the Football League playing for Small Heath, Preston North End and Bristol City.Good was born in Airdrie, which was then in Lanarkshire. He played for Airdrie Hill and for Airdrieonians before joining Small Heath in 1896. A short, stockily-built forward, able to cover the half-back positions as well, he made his debut in the Second Division on 19 December 1896, playing at right half in a 2\u20130 defeat away at Loughborough. He had a run of games at inside right at the end of the 1897\u201398 season and the beginning of the next, but failed to score enough goals. He moved to Southern League club Watford in 1898, in 1901 returned to the Football League with Preston North End, and spent 1902 with Bristol City, where he made 35 appearances in all competitions. He then returned to the Southern League with successively Reading, Brighton & Hove Albion and Southern United.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Michael Good", "response": ["Michael Good may refer to:", "*Michael Good (footballer) (1875\u2013after 1904), Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "Micky Good", "response": ["#REDIRECT Michael Good (footballer)"]}, {"page": "Southern United F.C.", "response": ["Professional players at the club included Frederick Mearns, Michael Good and former England international Fred Spiksley."]}, {"page": "1897\u201398 Small Heath F.C. season", "response": ["On a fine April day, Ike Webb made his debut in goal away to Luton Town, where Jimmy Inglis scored the decisive goal for Small Heath in the second half.\"Luton v.

They soon opened the scoring, James Higgins reacting to a shot parried by the goalkeeper, but by half time the home team had regained the lead. On change of ends, Newton Heath had much of the play, and eventually increased their lead through a Matthew Gillespie tap-in. The Manchester club's goalkeeper had no shot to save in the second half.\"Newton Heath v. Small Heath\". Manchester Guardian: p.3. 11 April 1898. On a wet pitch at Manchester City's Hyde Road ground, the scoring alternated. Clutterbuck, back in goal after two games out, got a hand to Billy Meredith's shot but failed to stop it, Abbott equalised, then Stockport Smith converted a penalty awarded for handball. Leake scored from distance, then Clutterbuck parried a Meredith shot to Smith's feet. In the second half, the surface became increasingly slippery, the play correspondingly scrappy, and Michael Good tied the scores from a free kick.\"Manchester City v. Small Heath\".
