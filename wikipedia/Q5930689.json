He was noticed by Birmingham City while he was serving in the Army, and signed for the club in December 1947. An inside forward, Evans made his debut in the First Division on 22 January 1949, deputising for Jackie Stewart in a goalless draw at Preston North End. His hard work did not make up for insufficient ability to play at the top level, and he joined Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic of the Third Division South in 1950. He scored 8 goals in 22 league games for Bournemouth, and a year later moved to Walsall, where his 12 goals in 36 league games made him their joint leading scorer in the 1951\u201352 season. For the following season he signed for his third Division Three South club, Watford, then finished off his career playing non-league football for Bedford Town and Hitchin Town. After retiring from the game he became a grocer in Luton.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of people with surname Evans", "response": ["*Hugh Evans (footballer) (born 1919), Welsh footballer active in the 1940s and 1950s", "*Hugh Evans (basketball), American basketball referee active from 1972 to 2001", "*Hugh Evans (humanitarian) (born 1983), Australian humanitarian"]}, {"page": "List of Walsall F.C. seasons", "response": ["|Hugh Evans"]}, {"page": "Hugh Evans", "response": ["Hugh Evans may refer to:", "*Hugh Evans (writer) (1854\u20131934), Welsh publisher, founder of Gwasg y Brython, author of Cwm Eithin", "*Hugh Evans (footballer) (1919\u20132010), Welsh footballer active in the 1940s and 1950s", "*Hugh Evans (basketball), American basketball referee active from 1972 to 2001", "*Hugh Evans (humanitarian) (born 1983), Australian humanitarian, founder of Global Citizen, Global Poverty Project and Oaktree", "*Hugh Evans (politician), Welsh county councillor and county council leader", "*Hugh Evans (priest) (died 1587), Dean of St Asaph", "*Sir Hugh Evans, a character in The Merry Wives of Windsor"]}]}}
