Emily, his first wife had preceded him when she died of heart disease on 11 May 1889. Emily was only forty-nine years old and had been sick for twelve months prior to her death.Reg. Gen.Qld, death certificate, 1889/003973, 11 May 1889. The Judge married Isabella Smellie Grahame on 23 December 1889.Reg. Gen Qld, marriage certificate, 1889/013734, 23 December 1889. Her sister, Barbara Jane, was married to Edward Robert Drury, a banker and soldier who became the Manager of the Queensland National Bank Limited and made advances without consulting the directors and concealing accounts from the board.Drury, ADB. Vol 4. p 104-105, Newspapers at the time suggested he faked his death in 1896. He would have been the person who lent George Harding his money for his property speculation. Isabella had been a forty-five-year-old spinster when she married. She was left with six of Harding's children who were still living at home; the youngest being William at thirteen years and the eldest being Josephine at twenty-five years."]}, {"page": "Residence, Abbott Street", "response": ["With the closure of the Moreton Bay penal settlement in 1842 Brisbane was opened up for free settlement; however, surveyors had begun subdivision plans for the New Farm area as early as 1839 and large acreage blocks were auctioned through the 1840s and 1850s. Throughout the 1850s the adjacent Fortitude Valley had begun to develop into a residential area, as more suburban allotments were offered for sale. The push towards New Farm was slow and did not take hold until the mid-1860s. Barrister and later Queensland Premier, Samuel Griffith purchased part of New Farm in 1870. Queensland National Bank manager, Edward Robert Drury joined the gathering social elite in 1875, purchasing acreage and constructing his residence on Bowen Terrace. Suburban residential development had extended solidly onto the New Farm peninsula by 1883-1884. This growth was accompanied by the introduction of a public transport system which was to have a major impact on Brisbane's suburban development. In 1884 the privately owned Metropolitan Tramway and Investment Company laid Brisbane's first tram tracks. Electrification of the tramway system in Brisbane commenced in 1895. By this time, although industries were established in the New Farm area, significant residential development had continued. Private buses also provided residents with transport in the late 19th and early 20th centuries."]}, {"page": "Saltwood, Shorncliffe", "response": ["Although Edward Robert Drury, general manager of the Queensland National Bank, did not acquire Saltwood until 1895, he and his family appear to have shared the house with the Hart family, as a holiday home. As early as 1882, Drury had acquired the fifth subdivision of the original site, fronting Swan Street, and this became part of the Saltwood grounds. A photograph dated , shows a separate timber building on the fifth subdivision, which may have been erected soon after Drury's purchase of the site. This building is no longer extant."]}, {"page": "National Australia Bank (308 Queen Street)", "response": ["Queensland sandstone, mainly from the Murphy Creek quarries, (specifically selected by Alexander Innes, stonemason and late foreman of the quarries) was used in the construction of the building. New Zealand Oamaru limestone was imported for the Corinthian columns of the Queen and Creek Streets frontages. The mantle pieces and the marble for the entrance hall were purchased by Lt-Colonel Edward Robert Drury, the bank's general manager, while he was in the United Kingdom during 1883-84. The upper floors provided a lavish suite for the manager, while the lower floors accommodated banking chambers and offices. Drury also selected much of the furniture still extant on the bank's upper floors. A passenger lift was installed in the 1890s and electricity replaced gas for the building lighting around the same time."]}, {"page": "Whepstead, Wellington Point", "response": ["Fernbourne was built during the wave of boom-time investment and speculation which characterised the late 1880s, but in 1891, as the boom burst and the credit squeeze tightened, Burnett was declared insolvent. His fine new house, together with its grounds of just over 4.5 acres, was put up for auction in October 1891. Title was transferred a month later to Edward Robert Drury, general manager of the Queensland National Bank Ltd. When the Burnett family left Fernbourne , they erected a smaller house on the eastern side of the railway line at Wellington Point, still on part of their original Trafalgar Vale estate and near the sawmill. This, their third home in the Wellington Point area, they also named Fernbourne, and it is likely that the first Fernbourne was renamed Whepstead at this time - certainly it had acquired this name by 1909, when the house was up for sale."]}, {"page": "1885 Birthday Honours", "response": ["* Lieutenant-Colonel Edward Robert Drury, late Acting-Commandant of the Volunteer Forces of the Colony of Queensland."]}]}}
