He later played minor counties cricket, as well as making two List A appearances, for Herefordshire.\nIn 2018, he returned to Worcestershire as chief executive., but resigned in late 2019.\nRawnsley spent his Worcestershire playing career on the fringes of the first team, only rarely getting a lengthy run in the side. Comfortably his most significant season was 2001, when he played 15 first-class and 21 List A games.\nIn that season, he took 27 first-class wickets \u2013 albeit at an expensive average of 44.85 \u2013 and 21 List A wickets at 34.19; in both cases, these were the highest season's aggregates of his career.However, Rawnsley's best individual bowling performances came in other years. His first-class career best of 6\u201344 was achieved in the second innings against Oxford University at The University Parks in 1998; he also claimed 5\u201372 in the first innings to pick up his only ten-wicket match haul.\nHis best one-day performance of 5\u201326 came in a National League game against Kent at Tunbridge Wells.In general, Rawnsley was not a particularly accomplished batsman in first-class cricket, never reaching the milestone of a half-century, although he was an outstanding fielder. Rawnsley did score a century for Worcestershire's Second XI in 1997. and many more in the Birmingham League for West Bromwich Dartmouth. However, he did contribute with the bat on one of his two List A appearances for Herefordshire: playing against Oxfordshire in the C&G Trophy at Bodicote. In an easy win for Herefordshire, Rawnsley scored 61 as well as taking 3\u20138.\nHe is currently playing for Ombersley Cricket Club in the Birmingham League.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "NBC Denis Compton Award", "response": ["*Worcestershire \u2013 Matthew Rawnsley"]}, {"page": "Worcestershire County Cricket League", "response": ["*Matthew Rawnsley Ombersley"]}, {"page": "Rawnsley", "response": ["* Matthew Rawnsley (born 1976), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Rawnsley, Matthew", "response": ["#redirectMatthew Rawnsley"]}]}}
