On his arrival in London, he had discovered that low church clergy in his diocese were taking exception to the ritual practices of some high churchmen, practices which indicated Roman Catholic influence.  The controversy had begun in the wake of the Oxford Movement, which had created a Catholic revival within the Anglican church, prominent among which were the Anglo-Catholics.  One of the radical low churchmen, the evangelical cleric John Kensit, had protested that Creighton himself had on occasion worn a cope and carried a mitre.  Kensit requested that Creighton take a more definite public stance against high church rituals, such as the use of candles and incense.  Creighton, who preferred to work behind the scenes, did engage many high church clergy.  Although he seemed to subscribe to a broad branch theory, that the real Catholic Church was a collection of national churches which included the Church of England, the Church of Rome, and the Eastern Orthodox Church, he was firm about asserting Anglican doctrine\u2014that liturgical practice, beyond that involving what he termed \"permissible liberty,\" conform to that in the Book of Common Prayer.  In a circular letter to his clergy, he wrote:It is absolutely necessary that nothing should be done which affects the due performance of the Church as laid down in the Book of Common Prayer, and that any additional services which are used should conform entirely to the spirit and intention of the Prayer Book. However, this still did not seem to satisfy Kensit and his more vocal evangelical supporters, who threatened to create more public disruption.  Eventually, the Church of England's two archbishops, of Canterbury and York, held a hearing in Lambeth Palace, and, in August 1899, ruled against the use of candles and incense, a seeming victory for the low church forces.  The wider doctrinal conflict, though, was to continue beyond both the Victorian and Edwardian eras."]}, {"page": "F. E. Smith, 1st Earl of Birkenhead", "response": ["Smith rapidly acquired a reputation as a formidable advocate, first in Liverpool and then, after his election to Parliament in 1906, in London.

The Liverpool Protestant Party fiercely opposed the construction of a cathedral for the Catholic community of Liverpool. The first attempt to secure independent Protestant representation was made by John Kensit leader of the Protestant Truth Society, who stood for Parliament in Brighton in 1898. In Ireland this unease manifested itself in the creation of the Independent Orange Order in Belfast in 1902."]}, {"page": "Percy Dearmer", "response": ["Active in the burgeoning Alcuin Club, Dearmer became the spokesman for a movement with the publication of his most influential work, The Parson's Handbook. In this work his intention was to establish sound liturgical practices in the native English tradition which were also in full accord with the rites and rubrics of the Book of Common Prayer and the canons that governed its use, and therefore safe from attack by evangelicals who opposed such practices. Such adherence to the letter was considered necessary in an environment in which conservatives such as John Kensit had been leading demonstrations, interruptions of services and legal battles against practices of Ritualism and sacerdotalism, both of which they saw as \"popery\"."]}, {"page": "Hampstead Cemetery", "response": ["*John Kensit (1853 \u2013 8 October 1902), English religious leader and polemicist", "The cemetery contains more than one grave with humorous or bizarre inscriptions.
