He arranged many of Mantovani's most famous pieces before composing his own music, which included Elizabethan Serenade and Sailing By.Ades, David. 'Binge, Ronald', in Grove Music Online (2001)", "Binge was born in a working-class neighbourhood in Derby, Derbyshire, in the English Midlands. In his childhood he was a chorister at Saint Andrews Church (Church of England), London Road, Derby \u2013 'the railwaymen's church' (demolished 1970). Binge was educated at the Derby School of Music, where he studied the organ. Early in his career he was a cinema organist, and later worked in summer orchestras in British seaside resorts (including Blackpool and Great Yarmouth), for which he learned to play the piano accordion. Binge's skill as a cinema organist was put to good use, and he played the organ in Mantovani's first band, the Tipica Orchestra. During the Second World War, he served in the Royal Air Force, during which time he was much in demand organising in-camp entertainment.Carey, Mike. Sailing By, the Ronald Binge Story (2000)", "After the war, Mantovani offered Binge the job of arranging and composing for his new orchestra. With Mantovani, Binge also orchestrated No\u00ebl Coward\u2019s musicals Pacific 1860 (1946) and Ace of Clubs (1950). In 1951, his arrangement of \"Charmaine\" gave him and Mantovani worldwide success and recognition. However, he tired of writing arrangements, and turned to composing original works and film scores. Mantovani's orchestra began playing his light orchestral pieces for radio broadcast, and in 1952 Binge devised and conducted his own BBC radio programme called String Song, playing many of his own compositions. He regularly composed for production and library music publishers, and a number of his works were used for radio and television signature tunes. ", "Binge was interested in the technicalities of composition and was most famous as the inventor of the \"cascading strings\" effect that is the signature sound of the Mantovani orchestra, much used in their arrangements of popular music. It was originally created to capture the essence of the echo properties of a building such as a cathedral, although it later became particularly associated with easy-listening music.Tomlinson, Ernest.
