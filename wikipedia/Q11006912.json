In pre-war cricket he was, though, inclined to be expensive and his figures suggest that he was under-bowled by the standards of the day. Only in 1936, when he took 87 wickets at an average of just over 21 runs apiece, did he suggest more than ordinary talent. \nReturning after the Second World War, however, Hazell developed into a highly accurate bowler who achieved success by pinning the batsmen down rather than through any great spin. For Somerset against Gloucestershire in 1949, he bowled 105 balls without conceding a run, including 17 consecutive maiden overs. He took 105 wickets in 1948 and 106 in 1949, in both seasons averaging less than 20 runs per wicket, and was still an effective bowler into his early 40s. At the end of Somerset's disastrous 1952 season, however, when he had again come top of the county's bowling averages, he was not re-engaged.\nIn his full career, Hazell took 957 wickets at 23.97. He was a reliable slip fielder and a popular, jovial, rotund figure.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Stanning junior", "response": ["His next match, and indeed all the remaining games of his brief first-class career, was for Worcestershire, playing in the County Championship against Somerset. He made only 4 and 0 as Worcestershire suffered two collapses, from 112/2 to 130 all out in the first innings, and from 116/4 to 142 all out in the second, but Howorth's 4-27 off 9.4 eight-ball overs (this was the only season in which the eight-ball over was used in England) saved the day, and when he bowled Horace Hazell the match finished in a thrilling tie."]}, {"page": "1947 English cricket season", "response": ["Somerset were captained for the only time by educator Jack Meyer but the team did not learn anything and dropped seven places from fourth in 1946 to equal eleventh. Even so, they pulled off some surprises by defeating champions Middlesex twice and inflicting on third-placed Lancashire their only loss of the season. Somerset were let down by their batting with only Harold Gimblett reliable through the season. Michael Walford played very well in the closing weeks when he became available and Playfair called him \"the best amateur batsman in England on a firm wicket\". The main bowler was veteran Arthur Wellard who was supported by all-rounders Bertie Buse and Johnny Lawrence, slow left armer Horace Hazell, captain Meyer and new pace bowler Maurice Tremlett. The veteran Wally Luckes kept wicket and claimed 55 championship victims.

Gimblett was well on his way to his famous century when Andrews joined him batting at number 10. Andrews was a sufficiently competent batsmen by this stage to keep Gimblett company, knowing that only Horace Hazell was left to bat. On Gimblett's departure Andrews took advantage of the dispirited Essex attack to score a rapid 71, his maiden half-century. He took 108 wickets in 1935, the most by a Somerset bowler, although his 95 Championship wickets was just pipped by Arthur Wellard's 97.", "1947 was his last season for Somerset, a season mostly spent as twelfth man. Against Worcestershire at Worcester the home side need just 126 to win but Andrews took 7-44 and Worcestershire were left on 93-9 off 42 overs in a drawn match. He scored his last half-century with 52* against Hampshire at Bournemouth when he and Horace Hazell put on 74 for the last wicket. Appropriately his final match for Somerset was at Clarence Park, Weston-super-Mare. He was released at the end of the season."]}, {"page": "John Stenton", "response": ["Stenton was a right-handed batsman and a slow left-arm bowler. Somerset, searching for a slow left-armer to replace Horace Hazell, who had left the staff at the end of the 1952 season, played him in the match against Surrey at the County Ground, Taunton at the end of May 1953. But his two overs in Surrey's first innings cost 26 runs, and though he took the wicket of David Fletcher in the second innings, it was not enough to keep his place in the side."]}, {"page": "Stuart Rogers", "response": ["Rogers' second season as Somerset captain, 1951, was more difficult than the first. The side was dependent for wickets on a trio of spin bowlers, Johnny Lawrence, Ellis Robinson and Horace Hazell, with the last two both past 40. In 1950, runs had come from several team members: in 1951, Maurice Tremlett made more than 2,000 and Harold Gimblett 1,400, but no one else apart from a couple of irregular amateurs averaged more than 20. Rogers made only 784 runs in Championship games with a top score of 58, although his season average and total was improved by an unbeaten 107 in 160 minutes against the South African touring team. This was to prove his highest score in first-class cricket. With both batting and bowling inadequacies, Somerset fell back to 14th in the Championship, with only five victories and 15 defeats.", "Rogers was captain in 89 of the 119 first-class matches he appeared in. His instincts appear to have been largely attacking, and he had a limited and ageing side at his disposal. David Foot, the historian of Somerset cricket, wrote: \"The crowd quite liked him, though he wasn't wholly one of the boys.\" Foot records the senior professional, Horace Hazell, being taken out for drinks at restaurants by Rogers and returning \"as drunk as a handcart\". But Eric Hill, one of the young players of the time and later the doyen of the Taunton press box, \"feels that Rogers probably lacked rapport with the younger professionals\". Hill records, in Foot's book, Rogers ordering a curfew of 10 o'clock in a match against Hampshire: \"The skipper plotted his evening accordingly and staggered up to bed at half-past nine... more drunk than anyone I've ever seen in my life.\""]}, {"page": "Reggie Ingle", "response": ["Ingle was famously the captain when Harold Gimblett arrived at Frome as an unknown for his legendary first-class debut. Players such as Arthur Wellard, Horace Hazell, Wally Luckes and Bill Andrews played as professionals for Somerset for many seasons and developed under Ingle. Ingle, wrote Foot, \"had a gift for what today is rather glibly known as motivation\". But he could also be a disciplinarian, suspending two of the professionals for a couple of matches for misbehaviour and warning an amateur off for providing the professionals with duff horse-racing tips."]}, {"page": "Bert Hunt", "response": ["The brother of George Hunt who played 233 matches for Somerset as a professional between 1921 and 1931, Bert Hunt was a lower-order right-handed batsman and a right-arm off-spin bowler. He played fairly regularly for two months from the end of May to the end of July 1936 as the second spin bowler (after Horace Hazell) in the Somerset side, but in that period he bowled fewer than 100 first-class overs. But he had his moments. Against Derbyshire at Ilkeston, he took seven for 49 in the first innings and was then not called upon to bowl at all in the second innings as Somerset beat the 1936 County Champions by an innings. A week later, he was among the Somerset batsmen who hit Hedley Verity of Yorkshire and England for 89 runs from nine overs, contributing two sixes in an innings of 22 that was surpassed by Hazell, who hit Verity for four sixes in a single over. But at the end of the season, he left the Somerset staff and he never played first-class cricket again."]}, {"page": "List of tied first-class cricket matches", "response": ["Horace Hazell 5/6"]}, {"page": "Tom Young (cricketer)", "response": ["Illness is cited in Somerset's history as a potential reason why Young was seen as a \"moody and intimidating\" cricketer by his fellow players. Younger left-arm spinner Horace Hazell is quoted as saying: \"I admired him\u00a0\u2013 he was good for us. Tom was very strict and didn't approve of us signing autographs outside the Oval. He didn't want us getting big ideas too quickly.\" All-rounder Bill Andrews is reported as having asked Young why, after making 32 opening the innings against Larwood and Voce in a match against Nottinghamshire, he had kept his pads on.

We'll be soon bloody well in again.\""]}, {"page": "Bill Johnston with the Australian cricket team in England in 1948", "response": ["Seven matches remained on Bradman's quest to go through a tour of England without defeat. Australia batted first against Kent and made 361. Johnston then took three wickets with the new ball to help reduce the hosts to 5/16, before ending with 3/10 from six overs. Forced to follow on after being bowled out for 51 in 23 overs, Kent were reduced to 4/37 by three early Lindwall wickets. Johnston ended with 1/28 as the home team capitulated for 124 and lost by an innings. The victory over Kent was followed by a match against the Gentlemen of England. Johnston was rested as Australia completed another innings victory. He returned for the match against Somerset, which resulted in a third consecutive innings win. After Australia had declared at 5/560, Johnston took the opening wicket of Harold Gimblett before returning to take the last two scalps of the first innings from consecutive balls, bowling his finger spin. He ended with 3/34 as Somerset fell for 115 and were forced to follow on. Johnston bowled the second over of the second innings. As Johnston had taken wickets with his last two balls in the first innings, his first delivery was the hat-trick ball. Gimblett negotiated the first ball safely, before being trapped lbw for a duck on the next. Johnston had thus taken three wickets in four balls. He bowled unchanged throughout the innings to end with 5/34 from 17.4 overs as Somerset were bowled out for 71.

McMahon filled a vacancy for a left-arm orthodox spinner that had been there since the retirement of Horace Hazell at the end of the 1952 season; Hazell's apparent successor, Roy Smith, had failed to realise his promise as a bowler in 1953, though his batting had advanced significantly."]}, {"page": "Box Case", "response": ["Case was injured halfway through the 1935 season, and played in only 13 matches, scoring just 361 runs. His last first-class match was another derby match against Gloucestershire, this time at Bath, and again his intervention was decisive: set 101 to win, Somerset had slumped to 85 for 9 when the injured Case came in at No 11 to join Horace Hazell, the left-arm spinner who was Somerset's normal No 11 for more than 20 years. Together, they hit off the runs to win the match by one wicket. Case was unable to take part in any further matches and he retired from first-class cricket at the end of the season. Wisden, which had not always been complimentary, wrote that he was missed in the second half of the 1935 season: \"If never a stylist, Case could often be relied upon to stay a collapse, and for practically half the season his stubborn tactics were much missed,\" it wrote."]}, {"page": "Jim Redman (cricketer)", "response": ["In 1951, he played in all but the first of Somerset's County Championship matches \u2013 he appeared in 27 games \u2013 and was awarded his county cap. He took 50 wickets in all at the relatively high average of 33.76. After the third Championship match, Maurice Tremlett, who had taken eight wickets to that point, did not bowl again during the season, and Redman opened the bowling in every other game with Bertie Buse, also barely above medium pace; they were backed by the three spin bowlers, Ellis Robinson, Johnny Lawrence and Horace Hazell, and these five bowlers then took all of Somerset's wickets for Championship matches across the whole summer. Redman had limited numbers of successful days: against Nottinghamshire at Yeovil he took five wickets for 151 runs after Tremlett had withdrawn from the attack. But his best performance was a month later at Frome: in the Derbyshire first innings, bowling unchanged with Buse, Redman took seven wickets for 23 runs as Derbyshire were dismissed for just 52 in an hour and 45 minutes. This return, from what Wisden termed \"deadly swing bowling by Redman\", was the best of his first-class career. In addition to his bowling, Redman also batted usefully in the lower order in 1951, making 472 runs at an average of 13.88. His highest score of the season, and the highest of his career, was 45 against Essex at Brentwood."]}, {"page": "Roy Smith (cricketer, born 1930)", "response": ["In the 1952 season, Smith again played in about half of Somerset's first-class matches. In the game against Essex at Taunton, batting at No 8, he made 58, his first score of more than 50. And towards the end of the season, when regular left-arm spinner Horace Hazell was dropped, he took four Leicestershire wickets for 91 runs in the match at Leicester, and those proved to be the best innings bowling figures of his career. Somerset finished at the bottom of the County Championship in 1952 and at the end of the season several players, including Hazell, were not re-engaged."]}, {"page": "Trevor Jones (cricketer)", "response": ["In the match against Leicestershire at Leicester, Jones batted at No 9 as Somerset made 190 in the first innings, to which Leicestershire replied with 358 to lead by 168 on first innings.

A further wicket fell early on the last morning of the match with the score at 140, still needing 28 to make Leicestershire bat again. But Jones and the wicketkeeper Wally Luckes then put on a partnership of 146 for the ninth wicket, and when Jones was out for 106, Luckes then went on to add a further 70 runs for the last wicket with Horace Hazell, enabling Somerset to save the game. The ninth wicket partnership of 146 was a record for Somerset in first-class cricket at the time, though it has been overtaken since. At 18 years and 104 days, Jones was the youngest century-maker in Somerset's history, and though there were few other runs for Jones in the 1938 season, Wisden noted in its 1939 edition that \"if able to spare the time he should, with greater experience, develop into a first-class batsman\"."]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club seasons", "response": ["|align=left|Horace Hazell", "|align=left|Horace Hazell"]}, {"page": "List of Somerset first-class cricket records", "response": ["| 350 || Horace Hazell || 1929-1952"]}, {"page": "Arthur Ricketts", "response": ["Ricketts had one of the briefest of all first-class cricket careers.
