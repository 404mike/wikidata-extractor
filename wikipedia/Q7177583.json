He was also first voted the Jockey of the Year in 1974 by the Horserace Writers' Association. He finished his retainer with Peter Walwyn in 1980 after two seasons of aquine virus acutely affecting the Walwyn stables.  He then joined forces with the greatest racing conglomerate of that time \u2013 the Ballydoyle stables under Irish compatriot Vincent O'Brien. When in the mid-1980s the Arab owners began to dominate the British racing scene, Eddery was retained globally  by the owner of Juddmonte stables, Arab prince Khalid Abdullah, a position he held until 1994, after which he rode as freelance jockey until his retirement from the saddle at the end of 2003.", "Eddery rode for the Newmarket trainer Geoffrey Barling in 1972 before taking over as the stable jockey for Peter Walwyn later that year. For Walwyn he won his first two classic races on Polygamy and Grundy and was Champion Jockey in four consecutive seasons from 1974 to 1977. While under retainer with Walwyn, he clinched his first title at the record young age of 22. In 1975 he rode Grundy to victory over Bustino for the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Diamond Stakes at Ascot Racecourse in what became known as Britain's \"Race of the Century\". Well known for riding champion horses like Sadler's Wells, Danehill (the grand sires on the sire and dam side of Frankel), etc., Eddery was also famed for riding for big owners as well as champion trainers. Apart from the later illustrious associations with Robert Sangster, Arab giant owners Prince Khalid bin Abdullah, Wafic Sa\u00efd and Maktoum al-Maktoum, he rode to winners in the then Colony of Hong Kong on the first ever race horse to be owned by tycoon Li Ka Shing, called 'Golden Victory' and trained by English trainer John Brown to whom Eddery rode for many seasons in winter in Hong Kong since 10 November 1973. ", "For the most part of his ultra-successful riding career, and spanning a quarter of a century, Pat Eddery's booking agent was his brother-in-law Terry Ellis, from the time Eddery was under retainer with Peter Walwyn until 1999 when he was riding as freelance. They parted ways after Eddery underwent a slipped-disc operation in 1999, with Ellis helping out the other riding members of the Eddery family."]}, {"page": "Sun Chariot Stakes", "response": ["| Peter Walwyn"]}, {"page": "Prix du Cadran", "response": ["| Peter Walwyn", "| Peter Walwyn"]}, {"page": "List of Old Carthusians", "response": ["*Peter Walwyn (1933\u20132017), racehorse trainer"]}, {"page": "Queen Mary Stakes", "response": ["| Peter Walwyn"]}, {"page": "Champagne Stakes (Great Britain)", "response": ["| Peter Walwyn"]}, {"page": "Hungerford Stakes", "response": ["| Peter Walwyn"]}, {"page": "Cartier Racing Award", "response": ["* 1999: Peter Walwyn"]}, {"page": "Prix Jean de Chaudenay", "response": ["| width=151px | Peter Walwyn"]}, {"page": "Lingfield Derby Trial", "response": ["| Peter Walwyn"]}, {"page": "Sandown Classic Trial", "response": ["| Peter Walwyn"]}, {"page": "Cocked Hat Stakes", "response": ["| Peter Walwyn", "| Peter Walwyn"]}, {"page": "Blue Riband Trial Stakes", "response": ["| Peter Walwyn"]}, {"page": "Nell Gwyn Stakes", "response": ["| Peter Walwyn"]}, {"page": "Craven Stakes", "response": ["| Peter Walwyn", "| Peter Walwyn"]}]}}
