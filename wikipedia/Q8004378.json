Later he attacked a gun position accompanied by two men, both of whom were immediately shot down. He went on alone to the gun, killing the team and capturing the gun. On a third occasion when the advance was again held up this officer collected a small party and rushed the position, inflicting heavy losses on the garrison. Subsequently, he consolidated the position by the skilful use of captured enemy and his own machine-guns.  The full citation was published in a supplement to the London Gazette of 12 November 1918 (dated 15 November 1918):\nWar Office, 15th November, 1918.\nHis Majesty the KING has been graciously pleased to approve of the award of the Victoria Cross to the undermentioned Officers, Noncommissioned Officers and Men: \u2014\n[...]\nT. /2nd Lt. William Allison White, M.G. Corps.\nFor most conspicuous bravery and initiative in attack.\nWhen the advance of the infantry was being delayed by an enemy machine gun, he rushed the gun position single-handed, shot the three gunners, and captured the gun. Later, in similar circumstances, he attacked a gun accompanied by two men, but both of the latter were immediately shot down. He went on alone to the gun position and bayoneted or shot the team of five men and captured the gun. On a third occasion, when the advance was held up by hostile fire from an enemy position, he collected a small party and rushed the position, inflicting heavy losses on the garrison.\n\nSubsequently, in consolidating the position by the skilful use of captured enemy and his own machine guns, he inflicted severe casualties on the enemy. His example of fearless and unhesitating devotion to duty under circumstances of great personal danger greatly inspired the neighbouring troops, and his action had a marked effect on the operations.\nIn 1939, White was commissioned as a captain in the Royal Artillery, Territorial Army.White married Violet Victoria Price, who died in 1956 after 35 years marriage.  He died in 1974, aged 79 at Wellington, Shropshire, and was cremated at Emstrey Crematorium, Shrewsbury.

The Fourth Army was tasked with clearing these positions. On 18 September, the Battle of \u00c9pehy was fought. The division attacked at 05:40 with the 113th and 114th Brigades. For his role during the assault, William Allison White earned the VC. Alone, he assaulted a machine gun post that was hindering the advance, killing the defenders and capturing the gun. He then launched a second attack, accompanied by two others who were killed, to seize another German machine gun position killing a further five and again capturing the gun. In a third action, White led a small group to overwhelm a German defensive position that was also holding up the advance. He proceeded to organise the defence of the position, and fought off a German counterattack with heavy losses using captured machine guns. Both brigades were able to reach their objectives despite flanking fire, and fought off numerous counter-attacks. Despite this, the Germans were able to cling on to Gouzeaucourt. The battle cleared the German outposts in front of the Hindenburg Line, preparing the way for future operations. On 20 September, the division was pulled off the line for a period of rest."]}, {"page": "Allan Ker", "response": ["In 1926 he was one of four VC holders who laid a wreath after the dedication of the Machine Gun Corps Memorial at Hyde Park Corner.

There were letters in The Times and discussion in the House of Commons.  Despite these interpretations, Derwent Wood wanted to depict the true nature of war, and in particular the solitary conflict of the machine gunner.  Although already in his 40s, he had enlisted in 1915 to serve as an orderly in the Royal Army Medical Corps; he designed masks to be worn by soldiers with facial disfigurements caused by their wounds, and was fully aware of the horrors of modern mechanical warfare."]}, {"page": "List of people from the London Borough of Merton", "response": ["*William Allison White \u2013 recipient of the Victoria Cross"]}]}}
