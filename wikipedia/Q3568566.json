The Kangaroos embarked upon a massive six months tour of Britain taking in 45 matches. Their timing was not good as the north of England was hit by strikes in the cotton mills, which badly affected attendances as fans could not afford to watch the pioneering Aussies. On Saturday 14 November 1908 Warrington played the Kangaroos. Warrington won the match 10\u20133, with Jackie Fish the hero scoring one try and Ike Taylor the other, Fish and George Dickenson kicked a goal each. A crowd of 5,000 watched the match at Wilderspool. The Warrington team that day was Jimmy Tilley, Jack Fish, George Dickenson, Ike Taylor, Lewis Treharne, Ernest Brooks, John Jenkins, William Dowell, Alfred Boardman, Billy O'Neill, George Thomas, Peter Boardman, and John Willie Chester. The Australians came back to Wilderspool for \"revenge\" later in the tour but tries from Jack Fish, and John Jenkins earned the 'Wirepullers' an 8\u20138 draw. Two members of the Kangaroo squad, Dan Frawley and Larry O'Malley later signed for Warrington and played the next season at Wilderspool. Warrington have the best record of any club side against the touring Kangaroos with eight wins, one draw, and seven defeats from sixteen matches.http://www.warringtonwolves.org/100-years-since-wire-took-on-the-aussies-for-the-first-time-2372"]}, {"page": "Pontypool RFC", "response": ["*  William Dowell"]}, {"page": "1949 in Wales", "response": ["*9 November - William Dowell, Wales dual code rugby international, 64"]}, {"page": "1885 in Wales", "response": ["*21 May \u2013 William Dowell, Welsh dual-code rugby player (died 1949)"]}, {"page": "1907 Home Nations Championship", "response": ["Wales: Bailey Davies (Llanelli), Johnnie Williams (Cardiff), John Hart Evans (Pontypool), Rhys Gabe (Cardiff), Hopkin Maddock (London Welsh), Reggie Gibbs (Cardiff), Billy Trew (Swansea), Dicky Owen (Swansea) capt., James Watts (Llanelli), George Travers (Pill Harriers), Charlie Pritchard (Newport), John Alf Brown (Cardiff), Billy O'Neill (Cardiff), Tom Evans (Llanelli), William Dowell (Newport)", "Wales: Bert Winfield (Cardiff), Johnnie Williams (Cardiff), John Hart Evans (Pontypool), Rhys Gabe (Cardiff), Hopkin Maddock (London Welsh), Reggie Gibbs (Cardiff), Dicky Owen (Swansea), Billy Trew (Swansea) capt., James Watts (Llanelli), George Travers (Pill Harriers), Charlie Pritchard (Newport), John Alf Brown (Cardiff), Jim Webb (Abertillery), Tom Evans (Llanelli), William Dowell (Newport)", "Wales: Bert Winfield (Cardiff), Johnnie Williams (Cardiff), John Hart Evans (Pontypool), Rhys Gabe (Cardiff) capt., David Phillips Jones (Pontypool), Percy Bush (Cardiff), Dickie David (Cardiff), James Watts (Llanelli), George Travers (Pill Harriers), Charlie Pritchard (Newport), John Alf Brown (Cardiff), Billy O'Neill (Cardiff), Tom Evans (Llanelli), William Dowell (Newport), Arthur Harding (Swansea)"]}, {"page": "1908 Home Nations Championship", "response": ["Wales: Bert Winfield (Cardiff), Johnnie Williams (Cardiff), Billy Trew (Swansea), Rhys Gabe (Cardiff), Reggie Gibbs (Cardiff), Percy Bush (Cardiff), Tommy Vile (Newport), James Watts (Llanelli), George Travers (Pill Harriers), Charlie Pritchard (Newport), John Alf Brown (Cardiff), Billy O'Neill (Cardiff), Jim Webb (Abertillery), William Dowell (Newport), Arthur Harding (Swansea) capt.", "Wales: Bert Winfield (Cardiff), Johnnie Williams (Cardiff), Billy Trew (Swansea), Rhys Gabe (Cardiff), Reggie Gibbs (Cardiff), Percy Bush (Cardiff), Tommy Vile (Newport), James Watts (Llanelli), George Travers (Pill Harriers) capt., George Hayward (Swansea), John Alf Brown (Cardiff), Billy O'Neill (Cardiff), Jim Webb (Abertillery), William Dowell (Newport), Arthur Harding (Swansea)", "Wales: Bert Winfield (Cardiff) capt., Johnnie Williams (Cardiff), Billy Trew (Swansea), Rhys Gabe (Cardiff), Reggie Gibbs (Cardiff), Dick Jones (Swansea), Dicky Owen (Swansea), James Watts (Llanelli), George Travers (Pill Harriers), George Hayward (Swansea), Tom Evans (Llanelli), Billy O'Neill (Cardiff), Jim Webb (Abertillery), William Dowell (Newport), Dick Thomas (Mountain Ash)", "Wales: Bert Winfield (Cardiff), Teddy Morgan (London Welsh) capt., Billy Trew (Swansea), Rhys Gabe (Cardiff), Reggie Gibbs (Cardiff), Dick Jones (Swansea), Dicky Owen (Swansea), James Watts (Llanelli), George Travers (Pill Harriers), George Hayward (Swansea), John Alf Brown (Cardiff), Billy O'Neill (Cardiff), Jim Webb (Abertillery), William Dowell (Newport), Dick Thomas (Mountain Ash)"]}, {"page": "1906\u201307 South Africa rugby union tour of Europe", "response": ["Newport: Dai Boots, Reg Plummer, WH Gunstone, S Adams, WR Thomas, Walter Martin, Tommy Vile, Charlie Pritchard capt., Edwin Thomas Maynard, Jehoida Hodges, William Dowell, Ernie Jenkins, H Davies, Harry Wetter, George Boots"]}, {"page": "List of dual-code rugby internationals", "response": ["| 4. || William Dowell || RU Test v England || 1907 || Swansea || RL Test v England || 28 Dec 1908 || Broughton || Forward", "Image:William Dowell.jpg|William Dowell"]}, {"page": "S.
