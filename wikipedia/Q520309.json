In a favourable opposition, Eros can approach the Earth to within 22\u00a0million kilometres.. During the opposition of 1900\u20131901, a worldwide program was launched to make parallax measurements of Eros to determine the solar parallax (or distance to the Sun), with the results published in 1910 by Arthur Hinks of Cambridge and Charles D. Perrine of the Lick Observatory, University of California. Perrine published progress reports in 1906 and 1908. He took 965 photographs with the Crossley Reflector and selected 525 for measurement. A similar program was then carried out, during a closer approach, in 1930\u20131931 by Harold Spencer Jones. The value of the Astronomical Unit (roughly the Earth-Sun distance) obtained by this program was considered definitive until 1968, when radar and dynamical parallax methods started producing more precise measurements."]}, {"page": "1960", "response": ["** Sir Harold Spencer Jones, English astronomer (b. 1890)"]}, {"page": "Royal Observatory, Greenwich", "response": ["After the Second World War, in 1947, the decision was made to move the Royal Observatory to Herstmonceux Castle and 320 adjacent acres (1.3\u00a0km2), 70\u00a0km south-southeast of Greenwich near Hailsham in East Sussex, due to light pollution in London.
