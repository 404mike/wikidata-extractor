Since childhood, she has produced work in a variety of different art forms. In 1974, she became one of Chicago\u2019s pioneering video and new media artists and, later to include, independent video producer, exhibition curator and teacher. Sykes is a Chicago based experimental video artist who explores themes of spirituality, ritual and indigeneity from a feminist perspective. Sykes is known for her pioneering experimentation with computer graphics in her video work, utilizing the Electronic Visualization Laboratory at the University of Illinois, Chicago, at a time when this technology was just emerging. Her early works broke new grounds in Chicago\u2019s emerging New Media Art scene, and continue to inspire women to explore experimental realms. With a passion for community, she fostered significant collaborations with many institutions that include but are not limited to University of Illinois, School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Columbia College, Center for New Television, and (art)n laboratory. These collaborations became exemplary for the showcasing of new media work. The wave of video, new media and computer art that she pioneered alongside many other seminal early Chicago New Media artists persists as a major influence for artists and educators today Her work has been exhibited internationally, at institutions such as Moderna Museet (Stockholm), Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek (Copenhagen), Mus\u00e9e d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego, Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York),  Museum of the Art Institute (Chicago) and The Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York). Sykes\u2019s tapes have been broadcast in Sweden, Italy, Puerto Rico and extensively throughout in the USA, including \u201cThe Independents,\u201d PBS national broadcast, 1985, and national cablecast,1984. Media Burn has a selection of her tapes online and over 200 of her raw footage, master edits, dubs and compilation tapes in their archives. Select grants include a National Endowment for the Arts and American Film Institute Regional Fellowship, Evanston Arts Council Cultural Arts Fund and several Illinois Arts Council Grants.\nIn 2019, the Evanston Arts Center Exhibition chose to showcase Sykes\u2019s first solo watercolor exhibition, \u201cEthereal Abstractions,\u201d premiering in 2020. The paintings are lyrical, colorful abstractions reminiscent of organic shapes, ethereal forms and underwater landscapes - evocative impressions of spiritual and elemental worlds. They evoke the spontaneity and themes that have evolved from her previous body of time-based and digital artwork. She paints under the name of Barbara L. Sykes.", "link_mentions": []}}
