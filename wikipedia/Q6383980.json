He often played policemen or officials. Appearances include  The Adventures of Robin Hood (1957-1960), The Avengers (1961), Doctor Who (1964), Crossroads (1964), Gideon's Way (1965), The Man in the Mirror (1966), Z-Cars (1967-1971), Thriller (1975) and Dixon of Dock Green (1975).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Theatre 625", "response": ["|Maurice Denham,Priscilla Morgan,Avis Bunnage,Denise Coffey,Marcus Hammond,Margaret Heald,Winifred Dennis,Norman Scace,Keith Anderson,Richard Hampton,Malcolm Taylor,Don McKillop", "|Diana Coupland,John Stratton,David Collings,Keith Bell,Angela Crow,Edmond Bennett,Mike Pratt,Catherine Howe,Miriam Raymond,Kenneth Ives,Eric Francis,Keith Anderson"]}, {"page": "The Reign of Terror (Doctor Who)", "response": ["The Doctor reaches Paris and exchanges his clothes for those of a Regional Officer of the Provinces. He heads for the Conciergerie, but finds his companions gone; Ian has successfully stolen the key to his cell and escaped. Lemaitre arrives and takes the Doctor to visit Maximilien Robespierre (Keith Anderson) to report on his province. Ian follows Webster's words and finds Jules Renan, who turns out to be the man sheltering Barbara and Susan; the latter is ill in bed. When Barbara takes Susan to a physician (Ronald Pickup), they are recaptured by revolutionary police. Ian meets Colbert only to find he is the mole in the escape chain and there are armed troops waiting for him. Jules rescues Ian, killing Colbert in the process. They return to Jules' house and are stunned to meet Barbara. The Doctor has returned to the Conciergerie, where Lemaitre reports that Robespierre wishes to see him again the following day. Lemaitre ensures that the Doctor spends the night in the Conciergerie in order that he remain in Paris for his second audience with Robespierre. He is still there when Barbara and Susan are brought in as prisoners. With Susan too weak to be moved, he engineers Barbara's release on the pretext that she can be trailed to lead the security forces to the core of the escape chain.", "Actor and lyricist James Cairncross portrayed Citizen Lemaitre, having been recommended to Hirsch by production assistant Timothy Combe, recalling his stage performances. The Conciergerie jailer was played by Jack Cunningham, who was also suggested by Combe. Spooner created the jailer character to add humour to the serial's heavy plot. Combe also recommended Neville Smith as D'Argenson and John Barrard as the shopkeeper, after working with both on Z-Cars, as well as Roy Herrick as Jean, having attended drama school together, and Tony Wall as Napoleon after seeing his theatre work. Donald Morley, cast as Jules Renan, previously performed alongside Jacqueline Hill in The Shrike, while Peter Walker, cast as the young child, featured in Hirsch's television play Bloomsday. Ronald Pickup, who played the physician, heard about the role from his friend Frank Cox, director of previous serial The Sensorites. Keith Anderson, cast as Maximilien Robespierre, had written to Hirsch prior to his casting, mentioning his appearance in an episode of Sergeant Cork."]}, {"page": "Anderson (surname)", "response": ["*Keith Anderson (born 1968), American country musician ", "*Keith Anderson (disambiguation), several people", ":*Keith Anderson (actor) (died 2007), British television actor", ":*Keith Anderson (saxophonist) (born 1970), American jazz saxophonist", ":* Keith Anderson or Bob Andy (1944\u20132020), Jamaican reggae artist", ":*Keith Anderson (politician) (1916\u20131965), Australian politician", ":*Keith Anderson (runner) (born 1957), British runner", ":* Keith Anderson (Good Times), character in the 1970s sitcom"]}, {"page": "List of The Avengers (TV series) episodes", "response": ["| John Stratton, Allan Cuthbertson, Ann Bell, Geoffrey Bayldon, Michael Hawkins, Keith Anderson"]}, {"page": "List of The Avengers and The New Avengers cast members", "response": ["* Keith Anderson"]}, {"page": "Ghost Squad (TV series)", "response": ["* 24.
