He is also series co- editor of Apocalypticism: Cross-disciplinary Explorations at Peter Lang.Segovia y Corral is the author of numerous scholarly books and articles, including the monographs Immanence and the Sacred, The Quranic Noah and the Making of the Islamic Prophet: A Study of Intertextuality and Religious Identity Formation in Late Antiquity, and The Quranic Jesus: A New Interpretation; the edited volume Remapping Emergent Islam: Texts, Social Settings, and Ideological Trajectories; and articles such as \"Spinoza as Savage Thought,\"  \"Post-Heideggerian Drifts: From Object-Oriented-Ontology Worldlessness to Post-Nihilist Worldings,\"  \u201cEarth and World(s): From Heidegger\u2019s Fourfold to Contemporary Anthropology,\u201d  \u201cPaul and the Plea for Contingency in Contemporary Philosophy: A Philosophical and Anthropological Critique,\"  \u201cTupi or Not Tupi \u2013 That is the Question: On Semiocannibalism, Its Variants, and their Logics,\u201d  \"Impromptu: The Alien \u2013 Heraclitus's Cut,\"  \"Four Cosmopolitical Ideas for an Unworlded World,\"  and \"The New Animism: Experimental, Isomeric, Liminal, and Chaosmic\";   he also writes regularly about philosophy at polymorph.blog.Carlos Andr\u00e9s Segovia y Corral is the youngest child of the celebrated classical guitarist Andr\u00e9s Segovia, the first Marquis of Salobre\u00f1a.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Andr\u00e9s Segovia", "response": ["Segovia's first wife was Adelaida Portillo (marriage in 1918).Family image: Segovia with wife Adelaida Portillo and baby  ; Nuevo Mundo (Madrid), 5 May 1922 Segovia's second wife (marriage in 1935) was the pianist Paquita Madriguera, who also made some piano roll recordings.
