His notable works include Kano's \"Brown Eyes\" and \"P's and Q's\", Mez Featuring Stormzy \"Lex Luther\", Giggs and Shola Ama \"Blow Em' Away\", Bashy featuring Wretch 32's \"Male Pride\", Tinie Tempah's \"Tears\", Tinchy Stryder's \"Something About Your Smile\", and a funky house hit collaboration with long time friends DJ Perempay and Katie Pearl \"Something in the Air\".He is also responsible for many grime instrumentals including \"Eyes on You\", which was used in the Boy Better Know Cypher for SBTV's 100m Views Milestone celebration featuring JME, Jammer and Skepta.Hailed as a \"grime veteran\" DaVinChe's stamp on the genre was indelible from the start, and he is commonly known as one of first to introduce tracks with singers to the genre, which until that point, had only heard a male dominated rap-esque sound. This style was later to be known as R'n\u2019G (Rhythm and Grime). Also hailed as the 'R&G King' by Complex Mag, DaVinChe worked with Katie Pearl, and Sadie Ama, and Shola Ama to create the R&G sound.DaVinChe spent his teens listening to mainstream pop-rock like the Beautiful South and Babybird, the R&B pop of TLC and R Kelly and the sounds of the urban underground. In 2009, he told The Guardian that he felt that grime is being threatened by \"the whole hoodie perception\" and that he wants to \"make music without limits\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Grime (music genre)", "response": ["Rhythm & grime, also known as R&G or R'n'G, is a subgenre pioneered in 2004-5 by producers Terror Danjah, DaVinChe and Scratcha DVA, along with the support of BBC 1Xtra's DJ Cameo. The subgenre mixed grime with R&B, showcasing a softer side of grime, often with accompanying R&B vocals, while keeping the 140bpm rugged sound of grime. Many UK R&B singers, such as Sadie Ama, Lady Ny, Katie Pearl and Gemma Fox would perform over R&G instrumentals, usually without an MC rapping alongside them. Many grime artists also made various R&G tracks, such as Ruff Sqwad, Wiley, Kano, Skepta and Dizzee Rascal. Producers such as Blackjack, Iron Soul, Low Deep and Kid D also incorporated R&G elements into their instrumentals. Lady Ny has stated she was the first woman to sing on grime, and the first woman to bring out a grime mixtape."]}, {"page": "Kano (British musician)", "response": ["140 Grime Street was released on 29 September 2008 through BPM (Bigger Picture Music).

And you know what, it just might. Yes, fans that have known Tinch from the beginning will hear him tone down his fiery musical 'tantrums' on some of the tracks, in order to obtain mass appeal. Looking no further than the DaVinChe produced single 'Something About Your Smile', its catchy hook and upbeat tempo has all the signs of a successful pop song. Really, there isn't anything wrong with that, Tinch hasn't totally deserted those who have made him a 'household name' in fact much of the lyrical content is still grimy, notably on 'Not Like Me' where he declares his originality as an artist, as with the title track 'Star In The Hood' claiming, well, the same thing. However the effort in 'keeping it real' on 'Catch 'Em' doesn't help dispel the current issues of how inner city youths get caught up in unnecessary life threatening altercations. Lucky, the inclusion of female vocals creates diversity on the album; 'Hands Of Time' with its reggae undertones and sentimental message show a softer side to Tinch, while 'Stereotypes' featuring and produced by Goldielocks, commands you not to assume 'we're some wasted kids, who aint got a clue about the music biz'. A Grime album wouldn't be a Grime album without a boisterous MC talking about his takeover of the world.
