Speaking about notable influences on the album, Raper wrote that \u201cJim Noir casually allows the history of pop music to inform his arrangements; luckily, he never allows them to overwhelm his natural sense of melody. Somehow, these sweet songs still sound fresh.\u201d He further praised the album for retaining \u201ca sunny optimism that\u2019s difficult to resist. For that reason alone Tower of Love is worth a listen.\u201d In his review, Allmusic\u2019s Tim Sendra especially noted the album\u2019s \u201ccatchy and richly constructed tunes\u201d, predicting that listeners \u201cwill be hard-pressed to keep from walking around all day grinning like a fish once you give the album an airing. In fact, doctors should prescribe a spin of Tower of Love to chase the blues away. The only problem with the record is that it paints Noir into a corner, as it will be hard to top.\u201d In his review, Drowned In Sound\u2019s Dom Gourlay concluded that \u201c[a]lthough not strictly an album in that it wasn't created for the purpose of such [...], it still wipes the floor with most other albums of a similar genre released this, or indeed any other year in the last ten.

Following tour commitments, the band parted ways with Jim Noir and began working on their own material with Cooper and Smith co-fronting. Commenting on the formation of the band, Cooper stated that they \"all gelled immediately as a band. Me and Ian bonded straight away over obscure psychedelic records, and stuff like that first EP by The Aliens. I was thinking of packing in my solo stuff, anyway, and Ian was looking for a new band after Alfie finished\". Through 2007, the band released 2 singles in the form of Tell Your Friends and Stars.
