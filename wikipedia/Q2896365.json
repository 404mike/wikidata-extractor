He spent only 3 months with the Gable Endies before returning north to sign for Aberdeen F.C.. Yorston stayed with the Dons for five seasons and remains the club's record goal-scorer for a single season, having notched 38 goals in 1929\u201330. He won his only cap for Scotland against Ireland in 1931.\nYorston was one of five Aberdeen players dropped after a 1\u20131 draw with Kilmarnock later that year. At the time, the reasons were not clear, but the club's official history claims that several players had been involved in a betting scandal.  No players were ever charged with any offence, but none of them ever played for Aberdeen again.Yorston joined Sunderland for \u00a32,000 in January 1932 then moved to their North-East rivals Middlesbrough for \u00a31,250 in 1934. He stayed with Middlesbrough until the outbreak of the Second World War, during which he \"guested\" for Hibernian, Aldershot, Reading, West Ham United and Lincoln City, featuring once for Dundee United shortly after the war ended. He retired before the cessation of global hostilities.\nYorston's nephew Harry was also a professional footballer who, like his uncle, played for Aberdeen and the Scottish national side.", "link_mentions": {}}}
