Nightmares on Wax were originally a group consisting of Evelyn and John Halnon, and then later with Kevin Harper.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Warp (record label)", "response": ["In the early 1990s, the label initially became associated with the UK's northern techno scene, including \"bleep techno\" acts such as LFO, Sweet Exorcist, Forgemasters and Nightmares on Wax. The 1992 label compilation Artificial Intelligence helped establish the electronic subgenre known as intelligent dance music (IDM). Subsequently, Warp became the home of acts such as Aphex Twin, Autechre, Squarepusher, and Boards of Canada. Current artists signed to the label also include Flying Lotus, Rustie, Oneohtrix Point Never, Danny Brown, Brian Eno, TNGHT, Kelela and Yves Tumor.", "The first release (WAP1) was by Forgemasters (produced by Robert Gordon), whose 500 copy pressing of \"Track with no Name\" was financed by an Enterprise Allowance grant and distributed in a borrowed car. It set a trend for the early releases both in terms of sound, and the use of purple sleeves (designed by The Designers Republic). The follow-up was Nightmares on Wax's \"Dextrous\", which sold around 30,000 copies. This led to greater commercial success; by its fifth release the label had its first Top 20 chart entry with LFO and their eponymous single, \"LFO\", which sold 130,000 copies and peaked at No. 12 in the UK Singles Chart in July 1990; by coincidence, that same month another Warp act, Tricky Disco, reached No. 14 in the UK chart with another eponymous single, \"Tricky Disco\"."]}, {"page": "1999 in music", "response": ["| Carboot Soul || Nightmares on Wax ||-"]}, {"page": "2000 in music", "response": ["| DJ-Kicks: Nightmares on Wax || Nightmares on Wax || Compilation"]}, {"page": "2002 in music", "response": ["| Mind Elevation || Nightmares on Wax ||-"]}, {"page": "2003 in music", "response": ["| Late Night Tales: Nightmares on Wax || Nightmares on Wax || Compilation"]}, {"page": "Jarvis Cocker", "response": ["Cocker has also directed music videos for, among others, Warp Records, including On by Aphex Twin, Sudden Rush by Erlend \u00d8ye and Aftermath by Nightmares on Wax (all three were co-directed with Martin Wallace).

Your son is dead. He died of an overdose.\") taken from the Bobby Susser, anti-drug hit \"Once You Understand\" by Think. 4hero were among the first proponents of what would become known as \"drum and bass\", which began to grow in profile via a series of releases on Reinforced. Another drum and bass figurehead, Goldie, met 4hero at a performance in London's Astoria.
