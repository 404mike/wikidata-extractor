Born in Glasgow, Scotland, she married Francis Sinclair, a ship's captain.  With six children in tow, the family moved to New Zealand. Her husband and eldest son (and much of the family's property) were later lost at sea.\nAfter years of farming, mainly at Pigeon Bay on the Banks Peninsula in the Canterbury region of the South Island, she decided to relocate to Canada.  Unhappy with the conditions she found on Vancouver Island, she considered California but instead went to Hawaii where she bought the Hawaiian island of Ni\u02bbihau for US$10,000 (equivalent to about $165,000 in 2020).  She later bought additional lands at Hanapepe and Makaweli on the island of Kaua\u02bbi. Her descendants, the Robinson family, continue to own and maintain the island of Ni'ihau.", "link_mentions": {}}}
