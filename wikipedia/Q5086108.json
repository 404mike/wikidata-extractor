She studied English at the University of Manchester. As a Labour Club activist there in the late 1980s and early 1990s, she was part of a successful campaign to oust then student union communications officer Derek Draper. She was University of Manchester Students' Union Women's Officer in 1990-91 and presided over an election in which Liam Byrne MP failed to be elected as the Union's Welfare Officer. She later studied at the University of Sussex.\nRaven was a contributor to the Modern Review, and the editor of the relaunched version in 1997. There she met Julie Burchill, with whom she had an affair in 1995: the two are pictured in the National Portrait Gallery. Her columns have appeared frequently in The Guardian and New Statesman.\nIn 2001 Raven was accused of regional 'racism' after launching an attack on Denise Fergus, the mother of child murder victim James Bulger, and the people of Liverpool in general, in a Guardian article on the James Bulger case. The article generated a high level of complaints. In response, Guardian readers' editor Ian Mayes concluded that the article should not have been published.In April 2013, it was announced that the feminist magazine Spare Rib would relaunch with Raven as the editor.
