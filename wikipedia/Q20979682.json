He scored his first goal for the \"Cobblers\" in a 6\u20130 victory over Harrow Borough in an FA Cup First Round match at Sixfields on 5 November. He made eight starts and five substitute appearances for the \"Cobblers\", before being ruled out with a thigh injury in November and returning to Vale Park in January when Michael Brown replaced Ribeiro as manager. He was named in the EFL Team of the Week after he played a crucial role in Vale's 3\u20132 home victory over Swindon Town in a \"relegation six-pointer\" on 12 March, scoring two goals from left-midfield \u2013 including a perfectly placed free kick \u2013 and forcing a red card from defender Bradley Barry.
