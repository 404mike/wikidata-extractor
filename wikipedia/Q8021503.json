Findlay became recognized as one of the finest players ever to appear for the Cliftonhill side, forming a strong partnership on the right wing with Johnny McIlhatton.Findlay's showings for Rovers earned him a \u00a37,500 move to Rangers in April 1947. His spell at the Gers included scoring in the 1950 Scottish Cup Final in a 3\u20130 win over East Fife after only 26 seconds, which remains a record for the event. Findlay also scored in the 1951 Scottish League Cup Final, a 3\u20132 defeat by Dundee. During his time at Ibrox he netted 65 goals in 114 appearances in the three major competitions and won medals for both the League championship (1948\u201349 and 1949\u201350) and the Scottish Cup (1947\u201348 and 1949\u201350) \u2013 he contributed to two other cup wins but did not take part in the finals. \nHe returned to Albion Rovers in the 1954\u201355 season for a few months.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Albion Rovers F.C.", "response": ["It would be 1946\u201347 before the League returned full-time and Rovers, whose 16th-place finish in 1939 would not normally have led to relegation, were assigned to the 'B' Division due to a restructuring of the League set-up.M.
