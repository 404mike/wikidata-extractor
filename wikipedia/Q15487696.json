He was elected a Scholar in his first year at Trinity, having become an undergraduate in October 1928. He also served as auditor of the College Classical Society. He was editor of TCD: A College Miscellany in Hilary term of 1931. He became a Fellow in 1934 and was one of the last Fellows to be elected by examination. Stanford was one of seven candidates nominated for the Provostship of the University on 11 March 1952 but was eliminated along with two other candidates in the first round of the election. He was considered, at the age of 42, to be too junior. The successful candidate on that occasion was the mathematician, Albert Joseph McConnell, who remained in office for 22 years.\nHis grandfather's cousin was the composer Charles Villiers Stanford.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1984 in Ireland", "response": ["*30 December \u2013 William Bedell Stanford, classical scholar and senator (born 1911)."]}, {"page": "1910 in Ireland", "response": ["* 16 January \u2013 William Bedell Stanford, classical scholar and senator (died 1984)."]}, {"page": "List of Trinity College Dublin people", "response": ["*William Bedell Stanford, senator and Regius Professor of Greek at Trinity College, Dublin"]}, {"page": "University of Dublin (constituency)", "response": ["Since 1922, most of the representatives of the University have been Independent, though Mary Robinson and Ivana Bacik took the Labour Party whip for periods of their time in the Seanad. A number of the senators have a reputation of being quite socially liberal, including Owen Sheehy-Skeffington, No\u00ebl Browne, and Catherine McGuinness. Three Senators were later appointed to the Supreme Court: T. C. Kingsmill Moore, Gardner Budd and Catherine McGuinness. Mary Robinson, first elected in 1969, was later elected as President of Ireland in 1990. In 1987, David Norris became the first openly gay member of either house of the Oireachtas. The senators have often included current or recent academics within Trinity College, such as professor of Latin and provost Ernest Alton, professor of Greek William Bedell Stanford, professor of mathematics Trevor West, and professor of medicine Mary Henry. Two of the three most recent senators teach or have taught in Trinity: Ivana Bacik in law, and David Norris in English."]}]}}
