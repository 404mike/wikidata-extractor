Frederic Bonney sold the station and went back to the United Kingdom in 1881 due to his brother's poor health. Bonney however recorded some important anthropology through his writing and his enthusiasm for photography. Some of his original images were lost, but his work has been published in two books and they include photographs of the Paakantyi. These were the Aboriginal people who lived near the Paroo river who became labourers on the station.The People of the Paroo River: Frederick Bonney's Photographs by Jeanette Hope and Robert Lindsay, anu.edu.au, retrieved 19 June 2014"]}, {"page": "Nhaawuparlku", "response": ["It has been suggested that the Naualko might be classified as a northern branch of the Paakantyi. Norman Tindale, taking into consideration the distinctive word for 'yes' in their ethnonym, argues that the probabilities lie with their being an independent tribe. In addition, early settlers like Frederic Bonney, familiar with the area's tribes, treated them as a discrete group."]}]}}
