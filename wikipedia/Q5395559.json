The exceptions to this were programmes on regional ITV, which used a variety of names, with \"Fight Night\" and \"Seconds Out\" being among the names used in some regions, while some overnight highlights programmes featuring less well-known or non-British fighters still used the \"World Championship Boxing\" title. During the 1980s, \"Fight Night\" promoted the careers of boxers like Errol Christie, whose fights featured on ITV and not the rival BBC. However, \"The Big Fight Live\" or \"The Big Fight\" (for highlights programmes), featuring its bright yellow and black branding and its dramatic theme tune became the consistent brand used for all of ITV's main network boxing coverage. This was a particularly fruitful period for ITV's boxing coverage, as they featured fights involving boxers such as Nigel Benn, Chris Eubank and Naseem Hamed. These were produced by LWT for the ITV Network, and drew large audiences."]}, {"page": "British Jamaicans", "response": ["Besides athletics and gymnastics, British Jamaicans have also become heavily associated with the sport of boxing.

Chris Eubank also held world boxing titles including Middleweight and Super Middleweight champion (his son, Chris Eubank, Jr. is also a well established boxer). Lennox Lewis of dual British/Canadian citizenship is one of the most successful boxers in the sports history, he is one of only five boxers who have won the Heavyweight championship three times. Errol Christie is also a former boxer, he is the Guinness World Record holder for achieving the most amateur title wins. In more recent times David Haye has become the new face of British Jamaican boxing, Haye has won numerous titles and in 2009 beat Nikolai Valuev to become the WBA Heavyweight Champion (the fifth Briton to do so, and the third British Jamaican \u2013 the other two being Britons of Nigerian origin).

Kaylor represented Great Britain in the 1980 Moscow Olympics, losing on a split decision in the quarter-finals. Perhaps his most famous fight came in 1985, when he defeated Errol Christie in the eighth round of a hard-fought match, marred with controversy due to a pre-fight punch-up between the pair, and by death threats from racist fans against Christie. Despite the controversy, Kaylor and Christie in fact showed great respect for each other after the match. Kaylor later commented, \"Back then, I had a quick temper that I\u2019d rather not have had.
