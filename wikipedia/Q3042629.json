Bohrer attributes this divergence of Herodotus\u2019 translation to Long's own artistic freedom or reimagining of the fable, purposely abstracting the content of Herodotus to be more resonant with his 1875 audience. Hart attributes this divergence with Herodotus to Long\u2019s reading and favour for George Swayne\u2019s translation and commentary on Herodotus,George C Swayne. Herodotus (Edinburgh: W. Blackwood and Sons, 1870), 37 which contains this linear arrangement and equal arrangement of the brides as depicted by Long. The Graphic notes Long\u2019s fondness for Swayne\u2019s commentary on Herodotus. It is argued that Long chose this method of composition as it more closely aligns the women (brides) to decimal currency,Hart, The Politics of Possession: Edwin Long\u2019s Babylonian Marriage Market,\u201d 90 Hart arguing that the linear arrangement more closely resembles a numeric scale which converts the brides into numerals. She posits that a core feature of the painting is Long\u2019s purposeful obscuring of the faces of the ugliest and most beautiful brides.  By doing this Long is argued to address the philosophical problem of the difficulty or impossibility of assigning an objective worth to beauty.Bahrani, Zainab. Women of Babylon: Gender and Representation in Mesopotamia. London: Routledge, 2001, 70 Long was understood to put forward that the most beautiful and ugly things are deeply subjective and personal. The additional choice to have the women seated at an equal level has been observed to establish an impactful linear equality, not hierarchy, Hart argues that this feature of the women\u2019s seating is key to understanding Long\u2019s critique of the Babylonian Ritual. The first bride is facing away from the viewer in the detail, and in doing so the viewer is not able to see her face, but can see the linear equality of the bride's seating positions.", "* Queen Esther (Work by Edwin Long)", "*\"Edwin Longsden Long\". 2021.
