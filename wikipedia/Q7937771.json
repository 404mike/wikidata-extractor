In 1947, he was elected to Carrickfergus District Council.  In the 1953 general election he switched to contest Carrick, but was again unsuccessful.  He was finally elected to Stormont in Belfast Oldpark in 1958.  He then stood down from his council seat, and retained his Parliamentary seat at each subsequent election.In March 1969, Simpson became the Deputy Chairman of Ways and Means and Deputy Speaker of the Northern Ireland House of Commons, holding this post until the prorogation of the Parliament in 1972.  After his party colleague Paddy Devlin defected to the Social Democratic and Labour Party, he became the sole remaining NILP MP, and the only non-Unionist MP attending Parliament.  He became regarded as the party leader; for example, the NILP's manifesto for the Belfast City Council elections of 1973 carried a foreword written by him.At the 1973 Northern Ireland Assembly election, Simpson stood in Belfast North, but fell well short of taking a seat.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Northern Ireland Labour Party", "response": ["Later in the 1950s, the party began to gain ground amongst unionist voters, and after the breakup of the Irish Labour Party's new attempts to organise in Northern Ireland among some nationalists, it saw its greatest period of success between 1958 and 1965. Four NILP MPs were elected to Stormont in 1958 for Belfast constituencies: Tom Boyd (Pottinger), Billy Boyd (Woodvale), Vivian Simpson (Oldpark), and David Bleakley (Victoria).
