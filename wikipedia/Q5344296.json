He became a member of the Montreal Stock Exchange. In 1907 he went to Britain on business and stayed, joining Sperling & Co Ltd, merchant bankers, of Moorgate Street, London, in 1908 and later becoming a senior partner. In 1917, he became chairman of British Controlled Oilfields Ltd, remaining in the post until 1925. He was created a baronet in the 1920 New Year Honours, largely due to his services to British-Canadian trade.His financial affairs ran into trouble in 1925 and he went into receivership, although this was rescinded the following year. He left Sperlings at this time and organised his own company, E. Mackay Edgar Ltd, with offices in London, Montreal and New York City. This ended when he retired due to ill-health, but in 1928 he returned with a new company, Beeston's Trust Ltd, which folded during the Depression and in 1931 he again went into receivership.\nMackay Edgar was also a notable figure in powerboat racing, owning a number of winning boats. He won the Harmsworth Trophy for two consecutive years (1912 and 1913) with his boat Maple Leaf IV.\nMackay Edgar's only son, John, was killed in a car accident in July 1925 and the baronetcy therefore became extinct upon his death.\nMackay Edgar and his wife, Ethel Beatrice (n\u00e9e Pinder), a fellow native of Montreal whom he married in 1902, are buried in the cemetery in Chalfont St Peter, Buckinghamshire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Water speed record", "response": ["||  || The Maple Leaf III ||  Sir Edward Mackay Edgar || The Solent || March 1911"]}, {"page": "Edward Edgar", "response": ["#Redirect Edward Mackay Edgar"]}, {"page": "Mackay Edgard", "response": ["#Redirect Edward Mackay Edgar"]}, {"page": "E.

Thomas died childless in 1819 and Chalfont Park was inherited by his brother Robert who bequeathed the estate to his son John Nembhard Hibbert on his death in 1835. In 1836, Anthony Salvin was employed to lay out a cricket pitch, and remodel the house by adding heraldic emblems and gargoyles and filling in the front arcades.
