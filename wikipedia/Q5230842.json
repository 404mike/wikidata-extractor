A. Hank Bell (Burt Lancaster) to gather evidence to secure a conviction. Bell, who grew up in the tenement district, has escaped from his impoverished origins to achieve social and economic success. He initially adopts a cynical hostility towards the youths he investigates, which serves his own career aims. The narrative explores the human and legal complexities of the case and Bell's struggle to confront his personal and social prejudices and commitments.Stafford, 2005 TCM: \"Bell uncovers the true murderer while making an important decision involving his own career.\"Barson, 2021: \"The Young Savages...an overheated but often potent courtroom drama that starred Burt Lancaster\u2014in the first of five movies he made with the director...\" The film's arresting opening sequence depicting a killing, which is key to the plot, reveals Frankenheimer's origins in television.
