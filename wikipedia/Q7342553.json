He was born in Pontypridd.\nHe was 27 years old, and a Sergeant in the 1st Bn., Welsh Guards, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place on 31 July 1917 at the Yser Canal, Belgium during the Third Battle of Ypres for which he was awarded the VC. \nWhen the 1/Welsh Guards attacked Pilckem Ridge the leading units, following a creeping barrage, achieved their first objective of the Black Line, but were then were halted by two pill boxes.  Bye rushed one, put it out of action and then rejoined his unit.\nAfter suffering heavy casualties the Guards moved on to attack the Green Line.  Held up by a series of blockhouses, Bye volunteered to take charge of a party, which captured the blockhouses along with many prisoners.  Still more prisoners were taken when he advanced to the Green Line.His citation read:\n\nNo. 939 Sgt. Robert Bye, Welsh Guards (Penrhiwceiber, Glamorgan).\nFor most conspicuous bravery. Sgt.Bye displayed the utmost courage and devotion to duty during an attack on the enemy's position. Seeing that the leading waves were being troubled by two enemy blockhouses, he, on his own initiative, rushed at one of them and put the garrison out of action. He then rejoined his company and went forward to the assault of the second objective.\n\nWhen the troops had gone forward to the attack on the third objective, a party was detailed to clear up a line of blockhouses which had been passed. Sgt. Bye volunteered to take charge of this party, accomplished his object, and took many prisoners. He subsequently advanced to the third objective, capturing a number of prisoners, thus rendering invaluable assistance to the assaulting companies. He displayed throughout the most remarkable initiative.\nBye, who moved to Nottinghamshire to work as a coal miner, also served in World War II as a sergeant major in the Sherwood Foresters guarding prisoners of war until ill health (arising from his pit work) forced him to leave the army. He then served in the Home Guard and as a temporary police constable.His Victoria Cross is displayed at The Guards Regimental Headquarters (Welsh Guards RHQ) in London, England.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Pontypridd", "response": ["*Robert Bye (1889\u20131962), recipient of the Victoria Cross in World War I"]}, {"page": "1962 in Wales", "response": ["*23 August - Robert Bye, VC recipient, 72"]}, {"page": "List of people from Nottingham", "response": ["*(1889\u20131962) Robert Bye, awarded the Victoria Cross for valour in the Third Battle of Ypres, died in Nottingham in 1962."]}, {"page": "Robert James Bye", "response": ["#REDIRECT Robert Bye"]}, {"page": "List of ethnobotanists", "response": ["* Robert Bye"]}, {"page": "Bye (surname)", "response": ["*Robert Bye (1889\u20131962), Welsh army sergeant"]}, {"page": "Bye, Robert", "response": ["#redirectRobert Bye"]}]}}
