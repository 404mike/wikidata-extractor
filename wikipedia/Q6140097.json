As the Brigade began to advance, Nolan said \"Now, Morris, for a bit of fun!\" As Nolan spurred his horse forward, Morris called out \"That won't do, Nolan. We've a long way to go and must be steady.\" Nolan was then hit by a Russian shell and his horse veered away across the Brigade to the rear.Adkin, pp. 155-156 It has been suggested that Nolan, realising that the Brigade was going in the wrong direction, was trying to tell Lord Cardigan the correct objective, but Morris always believed the charge went in the direction Nolan had intended.Adkin, p. 134 As the Brigade came under increasing fire, the horses moved from a trot to a canter, and to avoid being overtaken Lord Cardigan, at the front, had to order Morris and the 17th, who were setting the pace, to keep steady.Adkin, p. 159 Morris led his regiment down the valley without being injured, and reaching the eastern end, charged past the guns and into the Russian cavalry stationed behind.Adkin, p. 182 He killed a Russian officer with his sabre, but the point became stuck in the corpse, leaving Morris vulnerable to attack. He received two sabre cuts to the head, which knocked him from his horse, and then was wounded again by a lance from the Cossacks that surrounded him, after which he surrendered his sword.Adkin, pp. 183\u2013184 In the confusion he managed to escape back down the valley, having a captured horse shot under him before continuing on foot, but lost consciousness not far from Nolan's body. He was discovered by Lord Raglan's aide-de-camp Captain Ewart, who called for help removing him. Sergeant Charles Wooden of the 17th and Surgeon James Mouat of the 6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons saved Morris's life by attending to his wounds under Russian fire.Adkin, pp. 205\u2013206 For this action the Victoria Cross was later awarded to Mouat and Wooden. Morris was among those listed as \"severely wounded\" in General Bucknall Estcourt's return and he was mentioned in despatches by Lord Lucan. After recovering from his injuries he was invalided home to England. For his \"distinguished service\" he was promoted to the brevet rank of major on 12 December 1854."]}, {"page": "List of burials at Kensal Green Cemetery", "response": ["* Sir James Mouat (1815\u20131899)"]}, {"page": "1894 Birthday Honours", "response": ["*Surgeon-General James Mouat  late Army Medical Department, Honorary Surgeon to the Queen."]}, {"page": "Mouat, James", "response": ["#redirectJames Mouat"]}]}}
