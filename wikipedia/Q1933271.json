He quickly recorded a second album, David McWilliams Volume 2, which reached number 23 in the same album chart and featured the single \"Days of Pearly Spencer\". This was a song about a homeless man McWilliams had encountered in Ballymena, and featured a sweeping orchestral arrangement by Leander and a chorus sung as if through a megaphone. This low-tech effect was actually achieved by recording the vocals from a phone box near the studio. Exposure on Radio Caroline and through advertisements in the UK music press in the summer of 1967 helped generate interest and sales in continental Europe, and the record was a Top 10 hit in numerous countries including France, Belgium and the Netherlands, selling a million copies worldwide. However, although it became well known in the UK, \"Days of Pearly Spencer\" failed to make the UK Singles Chart, perhaps because the BBC refused to play it owing to Solomon's links with pirate radio, and through mismanagement McWilliams never profited from the song's success. In Italy, the song was covered in 1968 by Caterina Caselli as \"Il Volto Della Vita\".  A Spanish version called \"Vuelo blanco de gaviota\" was recorded in 1979 by Ana Bel\u00e9n. Successful later versions of the song included a disco version which reached number 1 in Belgium in the 1980s, and a cover version in 1988 by the French psychedelic band The Vietnam Veterans and their album The Days of Pearly Spencer.

Martin, though hurt by this, produced the song and conducted the string section in a session on 17 March 1967 that generated six takes.
