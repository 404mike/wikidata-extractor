He served as Inspector of Land and Roads and subsequently Registrar of Deeds in the Hong Kong colonial administration from 1842 to 1847, but was removed from office and barred from public service owing to allegations he had raised against Colonial Secretary William Caine, which an internal government inquiry held to be fabricated. Tarrant then began a new career in journalism, purchasing the Friend of China newspaper in 1850. He became prominently involved in a scandal involving multiple senior government officers, the Caldwell affair, in 1857, and was ultimately found guilty of libel and imprisoned in 1859. He left the colony after his release in 1860, and made two attempts over the course of the 1860s to restart the Friend of China in Guangzhou and Shanghai, each proving abortive. Finally, he sold the paper in 1869 and retired to England, where he died in 1872.", "Tarrant lost his position in the colonial administration in 1847 as a result of an allegation he made that a comprador of William Caine, the Colonial Secretary, was abusing his position to extort money from stall-holders in the Central Market... An inquiry by the Chief Magistrate and the Acting Attorney and Solicitor General found Tarrant's charge baseless\u2014Tarrant himself claimed that he had delayed reporting the crime by eight or nine months\u2014and accused Tarrant of conspiring to injure Caine's reputation. He was suspended from his position as Registrar of Deeds. Criminal charges were never brought against Tarrant, however, and the Acting Attorney General's report was not released. Tarrant asked the government for his reinstatement and payment of his salary in arrears, but the office of Registrar of Deeds was abolished in September 1847 and Governor John Francis Davis refused to re-employ him..", "The end of Tarrant's career in Hong Kong came when he was sued once again for libel in September 1859, this time by his old enemy William Caine, now Lieutenant-Governor, against whom Tarrant had waged what was by then a twelve-year public vendetta.. He was found guilty, and was fined \u00a350 () and sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment. The Friend of China suspended publication, and without this source of income Tarrant himself faced financial ruin. He spent his time in prison writing letters to other newspapers about abuses in the gaol and, his case having received coverage in the colonial, Indian and United Kingdom press, the concern of the Secretary of State was aroused when Tarrant became the subject of debate in Parliament.  Urged by the former, Governor Sir Hercules Robinson remitted half the sentence and, the fine having been raised by a sympathetic public, he was released having served six months, on 20 March 1860. His release was short-lived, however: Bridges obtained an order for costs incurred at trial (at which the entire bar appeared for the prosecution, leaving Tarrant without a barrister) in the enormous sum of HK$2,353.  Tarrant was confined in debtors' prison for another four months while members of the public once again raised the necessary sum.."]}]}}
