It is more surreal than Blackadder, however, and drops even more (deliberate) anachronisms. Many of the show's cast such as Howard Lew Lewis, Forbes Collins, Ramsay Gilderdale and Patsy Byrne had previously appeared in various episodes of Blackadder alongside Robinson. Like many British children's programmes, there is a lot of social commentary sneakily inserted, as well as witty asides about the Royal family, buses running on time, etc. Many of the plots spoofed or referenced film and television shows including other incarnations of Robin Hood in those media.", "Many of the plots featured, included or revolved around spoofing particular things, including films such as Jurassic Park and It Came From Outer Space, and television programmes, including The Crystal Maze and the long-running televised fundraisers Children in Need and Comic Relief. There were also frequent references to other Robin Hood incarnations, most notably ITV's Robin of Sherwood (and in particular that series' theme song by Clannad, \"Robin (The Hooded Man)\" is lampooned in the episode \"The Whitish Knight\") and the contemporary film adaptation Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. The latter actually features Howard Lew Lewis (Rabies) among its cast - hence his doubly witty line in the episode \"They Came from Outer Space,\" which episode also passingly satirises the film for casting the lead with an American accent (Kevin Costner).", "* Rabies (Howard Lew Lewis): another Merry Man, very strong, and very stupid, although with his heart in the right place."]}, {"page": "1985 in film", "response": ["| Brazil || 20th Century Fox (International) / Universal Pictures (United States) || Terry Gilliam (director/screenplay); Tom Stoppard, Charles McKeown (screenplay); Jonathan Pryce, Robert De Niro, Katherine Helmond, Ian Holm, Bob Hoskins, Michael Palin, Ian Richardson, Peter Vaughan, Kim Greist, Jim Broadbent, Brian Miller, Sheila Reid, Simon Nash, Barbara Hicks, Kathryn Pogson, Bryan Pringle, Derrick O'Connor, Elizabeth Spender, Derek Deadman, Nigel Planer, Charles McKeown, Ray Cooper, Gorden Kaye, John Pierce Jones, Ann Way, Myrtle Devenish, Simon Jones, Bill Wallis, Don Henderson, Howard Lew Lewis, Oscar Quitak, Harold Innocent, John Grillo, Patrick Connor, Roger Ashton-Griffiths, Jack Purvis, Andre Gregory, Terry Gilliam, Sue Hodge || Sci-Fi || Live action"]}, {"page": "Chelmsford 123", "response": ["* Howard Lew Lewis as Blag"]}, {"page": "Phil Cool", "response": ["In 1989 he appeared in the mini-film Night of the Comic Dead alongside Frank Carson, Karl Howman and Howard Lew Lewis as part of A Night of Comic Relief 2.
