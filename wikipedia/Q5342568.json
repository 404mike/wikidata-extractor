According to the Harvard University Library, however, there were over 400 settlement houses in the U.S. by 1890. In her master's thesis, Heather Capitanio specifies that Denison House was \"the third college settlement of its kind in the United States\". The CSA had been founded in 1887 by a small group of Wellesley College faculty and alumnae including noted pacifist Emily Greene Balch, labor organizer Vida Scudder, and the writer and college professor Katharine Lee Bates.Barbuto (1999), p. 53. It was named for Edward Denison, an English social reformer who advocated living among the poor.Williams (2015), p. 258. Balch was an admirer of Jane Addams, whom she had met at an Ethical Culture Society gathering; Denison House was modeled after Addams's Hull House in Chicago. Its mission was to provide Boston's poor with social services and education, not only for philanthropic purposes but to break down class barriers. The women hoped that bringing people of different backgrounds together under one roof would further the purpose of democracy, which they defined as \"a free flowing life between group and group\"."]}, {"page": "Vagrancy Act 1898", "response": ["From the 1860s onwards the tramping artisan began to disappear, as those in search of work intensified the experience to gain finality to it; whereas tramps came at last to accept, however reluctantly their lot in life as \"down and outs\". Only 20% of \"discharged souldiers\" could in 1897, justify their claim to be migrant workers to the Royal Commission; while only 3% could in the workhouse population.  Thus the Report of Minority Opinion was condemned in a scathing critique by Fabian socialists Beatrice and Sidney Webb, in their work The Break-Up of the Poor Law (1909), in which they described how only 3% could actually be categorised as \"professional tramps\".Being Part 1 of the Minority Report (London 1909, p.85) The Fabian emphasis fell on assessing at least between 1/3 and 2/3 of all vagrants as \"deserving\" of classification as \"genuine workmen\" and therefore respectability. This was determined by the economic climate: if prosperity rose and then the numbers in work increased, the number of assessed casuals would shrink. But more Liberal gentlemen earlier in the period could hardly discern any deserving case in the East End. Hugh Owen, Secretary to the Local Government Board (1871), and Edward Denison (1867) were both strongly opposed to casualism. Both men were quite disparaging of the casual poor."]}]}}
