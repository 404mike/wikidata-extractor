Janaki Ammal, moved to Bombay. In 1931, she returned to Madras and settled in Triplicane, where she supported herself on a pension from Madras University and income from tailoring. In 1950, she adopted a son, W. Narayanan, who eventually became an officer of the State Bank of India and raised a family. In her later years, she was granted a lifetime pension from Ramanujan's former employer, the Madras Port Trust, and pensions from, among others, the Indian National Science Academy and the state governments of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal. She continued to cherish Ramanujan's memory, and was active in efforts to increase his public recognition; prominent mathematicians, including George Andrews, Bruce C. Berndt and B\u00e9la Bollob\u00e1s made it a point to visit her while in India.

Analytic solutions for this mechanism (also similar to the solution of Price) were presented in 2000 by Dorogovtsev, Mendes and Samukhin  and independently by Krapivsky, Redner, and Leyvraz, and later rigorously proved by mathematician B\u00e9la Bollob\u00e1s.

Different random graph models produce different probability distributions on graphs. Most commonly studied is the one proposed by Edgar Gilbert, denoted G(n,p), in which every possible edge occurs independently with probability 0 < p < 1. The probability of obtaining any one particular random graph with m edges is p^m (1-p)^{N-m} with the notation N = \\tbinom{n}{2}.B\u00e9la Bollob\u00e1s, Probabilistic Combinatorics and Its Applications, 1991, Providence, RI: American Mathematical Society."]}, {"page": "Timothy Gowers", "response": ["Gowers attended King's College School, Cambridge, as a choirboy in the King's College choir, and then Eton College as a King's Scholar, where he was taught mathematics by Norman Routledge.
