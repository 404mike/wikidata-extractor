He had trained as a painter, but become a professional art critic and amateur etcher.  His Etching and Etchers (1868) was more an art history than a technical text but it did much to popularize the art and some of its modern practitioners. His ideas had much in common with those of Haden, favouring a spare style where what was omitted was as important as what was included, an important theme of Haden.  The book went through many editions till the 20th century. By the 1870s Hamerton was also publishing an influential periodical, titled The Portfolio, that published etchings in editions of 1000 copies.  The French A Treatise on Etching by Lalanne was translated by S.R. Koehler and published in the United States in 1880.
