A year later, he joined Football League Third Division North side Stalybridge Celtic on amateur terms, making one first-team appearance in the 1921\u201322 season. He was awarded a professional contract in March 1922 and played a further nine league matches in the following campaign. In August 1923, O'Beirne was signed on a free transfer by Football League First Division outfit Burnley. He made his debut for the club on 15 September 1923, replacing Albert Freeman, who had played in the previous two matches, in the goalless draw away at Nottingham Forest. He appeared in the next three league games, and scored his first competitive goal in the Lancashire Senior Cup tie against Manchester City on 15 October 1922. He then spent over four months out of the team, unable to oust regular inside-left Benny Cross. O'Beirne was reinstated to the starting line-up for the 2\u20132 draw with Manchester City on 16 February 1923, but subsequently returned to the reserves for the remainder of the season.Simpson, p. 165"]}, {"page": "Albert Freeman", "response": ["Albert Freeman can refer to:", "* Albert Freeman (cricketer, born 1844) (1844-1920), English cricketer", "* Albert Freeman (cricketer, born 1887) (1887-1945), English cricketer", "* Albert Freeman (footballer), an English footballer"]}]}}
