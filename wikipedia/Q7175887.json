The review praises the novel's \"arresting start\" and frequently alludes to Guillermo del Toro's career as a film director by comparing the novel to a Hollywood movie. The implication may be that del Toro intends to direct the film version of the novel. The review closes by calling The Strain a \"rattling piece of escapism\" with a \"predictable\" blockbuster ending. Xan Brooks of The Guardian calls the novel \"a pulpy, apocalyptic fable\" and a \"fast-paced, high-concept outing that seems tailor-made for either a big-screen adaptation or - as Hogan has enthused - 'a long-form, cable-type TV series'. And yet at the same time this opening salvo also looks to the past; doffing its cap to an illustrious ancestor.\" He calls the vampires \"mindless, undead leeches.\""]}, {"page": "List of alumni of Magdalen College, Oxford", "response": ["* Peter Millar, journalist"]}, {"page": "Howard Linskey", "response": ["Linskey\u2019s debut novel, The Drop, was published by No Exit Press in 2011.
