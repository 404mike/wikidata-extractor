He was a founder member of Sinn F\u00e9in and of the Gaelic League in Galway. He was a member of the Irish Volunteers from 1917 to 1921.\nHe was born in Kilmilkin, in Maam Valley in County Galway and was a farmer. He was elected as a Sinn F\u00e9in MP for Galway Connemara at the 1918 general election.In January 1919, Sinn F\u00e9in MPs who had been elected in the Westminster elections of 1918 refused to recognise the Parliament of the United Kingdom and instead assembled at the Mansion House in Dublin as a revolutionary parliament called D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann. He was re-elected as a Sinn F\u00e9in Teachta D\u00e1la (TD) for the Galway constituency at the 1921 elections.He supported the Anglo-Irish Treaty and voted in favour of it. He was re-elected as a pro-Treaty Sinn F\u00e9in TD for Galway at the 1922 general election, and was elected as a Cumann na nGaedheal TD for Galway at the 1923 general election. In the subsequent Irish Civil War, he was targeted for assassination by anti-Treaty forces and was shot and badly wounded in Dublin in December 1922.He was critical of the proposed Irish Boundary Commission and resigned from Cumann na nGaedheal and founded a new political party called Clann \u00c9ireann in 1926.\nHe lost his seat at the June 1927 general election and was unsuccessful at the September 1927 general election. He later joined Fianna F\u00e1il (the party which had emerged from the anti-Treaty side in the civil war) and contested the 1932 general election for that party in the Dublin County constituency but was not elected.On each of these occasions he was subjected to a smear campaign by his former party colleagues who used his pro-Treaty stance during the civil war against him. It was alleged that he had personally selected his fellow county man Liam Mellows for execution. These smears persisted despite denials from the Mellows family and from \u00d3 M\u00e1ille himself. In fact, Mellows was executed in reprisal for the attack on \u00d3 M\u00e1ille and Sean Hales in 1922. Mellows was shot the following day while \u00d3 M\u00e1ille himself was gravely wounded and in hospital.He served as a Fianna F\u00e1il Senator in Seanad \u00c9ireann from 1934 to 1936. He was re-elected to the new Seanad in 1938 on the Agricultural Panel. From 1939 until his death in 1946 he was re-appointed to the Seanad as a nominee of the Taoiseach \u00c9amon de Valera. He was Leas-Chathaoirleach (Deputy chairman) of the Seanad from May to November 1938.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cathaoirleach", "response": ["|P\u00e1draic \u00d3 M\u00e1ille"]}, {"page": "Ceann Comhairle", "response": ["|rowspan=2|P\u00e1draic \u00d3 M\u00e1ille"]}, {"page": "Constitution of the Irish Free State", "response": ["Shortly after the British evacuated their troops from Dublin Castle in January 1922, Michael Collins set about establishing a committee to draft a new constitution for the nascent Irish Free State which would come into being in December 1922.Address to the Constitutional Convention, Dublin Castle, 1 December 2012 by Gerard Hogan, judge of the High Court of Ireland  Mr Collins chaired the first meeting of that committee and at that point (he died before the constitution was finalised) was its chairman. Darrell Figgis, the vice-chairman became acting Chair. The committee produced three draft texts, designated A, B and C. A was signed by Figgis, James McNeill and John O'Byrne. B was signed by James G. Douglas, C.J. France and Hugh Kennedy and it differed substantially from A only in proposals regarding the Executive.Douglas p81 This difference was intended by Douglas to permit the anti-treaty faction a say in the final proposed constitution before its submission to the British Government. As such it was, according to Douglas, an attempt to ameliorate the pro- and anti-treaty split. Draft C was the most novel of the three. It was signed by Alfred O'Rahilly and James Murnaghan, and provided for the possibility of representation for the people of the northern counties in the D\u00e1il in the event of that area opting out of the proposed free state.Douglas p85 The Irish text was then drafted as a translation of the English text. The Irish language version was drafted by a committee which included the Minister for Education, Eoin MacNeill; the Leas-Cheann Comhairle (deputy speaker), P\u00e1draic \u00d3 M\u00e1ille; the Clerk of the D\u00e1il, Colm \u00d3 Murchadha; Piaras B\u00e9asla\u00ed; Liam \u00d3 Rinn and Professors Osborn Bergin and T.

Hales was killed and O'M\u00e1ille was badly wounded. After an emergency cabinet meeting, the Free State government decided on the retaliatory executions of four prominent Republicans (one from each province). Accordingly, on 8 December 1922, the day after Hales' killing, four members of the IRA Army Executive, who had been in jail since the first week of the war - Rory O'Connor, Liam Mellows, Richard Barrett and Joe McKelvey - were executed in revenge. O'Connor and Mellows particularly were revered heroes of the War of Independence. This was arguably an unlawful act, as the four Republicans had been captured before the D\u00e1il passed the legislation authorising executions. Later on the same day the D\u00e1il debated the executions and retrospectively approved them by a vote of 39-14.See  One of the poignant aspects of the incident was that O'Connor and Kevin O'Higgins were formerly close friends, and O'Connor had been best man at O'Higgins' wedding just a few months previously. Historian Michael Hopkinson reports that Richard Mulcahy had pressed for the executions and that Kevin O'Higgins was the last member of cabinet to give his consent."]}]}}
