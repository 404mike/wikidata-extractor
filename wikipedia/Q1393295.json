He played on top board for Warwickshire in the English Counties Final of 1961 when his team beat Yorkshire. He played in every British Chess Championship between 1957 and 1971, beating Peter Clarke, Sir Stuart Milner-Barry and Gerald Abrahams on his debut. His best placing was in 1964 when he finished second equal with three other players behind Michael Haygarth.

Following this, the Scottish Chess Association selected Combe as their nominee for the British championship in Nottingham. The nomination of Combe was controversial, but the British Chess Federation eventually relented and allowed him to play. In one of the most unexpected results in the history of the championship, Combe won the tournament ahead of several strong masters, including Gerald Abrahams, William Winter, Harry Golombek and Stuart Milner-Barry. He was the last Scottish player to win the championship until Jonathan Rowson won in 2004. "]}]}}
