He helped Villa to finish second in the First Division in 1902\u201303, and helped Stoke to reach the FA Cup semi-finals in 1899.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tom Holford", "response": ["Holford was born in Hanley, and started his career with Cobridge before moving on to one of the two local league clubs; Stoke in May 1898. He \"did not put a foot wrong\" in his first seasons at the club, before establishing himself as the centre of Stoke's half-back line between James Bradley and George Baddeley following Alf Wood's departure in March 1901. For the next ten seasons Holford was a near ever-present in the Stoke team, racking up 105 consecutive appearances from March 1903 to March 1906. His good performances won him an England cap in 1903 and he is considered the smallest centre-back ever to play for England at just 5\u00a0ft 5. During Holford's time at the club he played the game in a fiery style, although he was never sent off. He succeeded George Baddeley as captain in 1905. Holford's manager Horace Austerberry described him as \"an excellent passer of the ball and one who played every match as if it was his last\". In 1908 Stoke went bust and dropped out of the English Football League and played in the Birmingham League. Holford was too good to be lost to non-league football and so he had to leave his home-town club, who he played nearly 270 games for.Matthews, Tony: \"The Encyclopedia of Stoke City \" (Lion Press, 1994, )"]}, {"page": "Potteries derby", "response": ["| Alf Wood"]}, {"page": "Alfred Wood", "response": ["Alfred or Alf Wood may refer to:", "*Alf Wood (footballer, born 1876) (1876\u20131919), English footballer", "*Alf Wood (footballer, born 1915) (1915\u20132001), English goalkeeper and football manager", "*Alf Wood (footballer, born 1945) (1945\u20132020), English footballer", "*Alf Wood (rugby) (1883\u20131963), rugby union and rugby league footballer of the 1900s and 1910s for England (RU), Gloucester, Great Britain (RL), England, and Oldham", "*Alf Wood (Australian footballer) (1875\u20131945), Australian rules footballer "]}, {"page": "1895\u201396 Stoke F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|HB||align=\"left\"| Alf Wood"]}, {"page": "1896\u201397 Stoke F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|HB||align=\"left\"| Alf Wood"]}, {"page": "1897\u201398 Stoke F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|HB||align=\"left\"| Alf Wood"]}, {"page": "1898\u201399 Stoke F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|HB||align=\"left\"| Alf Wood"]}, {"page": "1899\u20131900 Stoke F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|HB||align=\"left\"| Alf Wood"]}, {"page": "1900\u201301 Stoke F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|HB||align=\"left\"| Alf Wood"]}, {"page": "1892\u201393 Burslem Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Alf Wood", "|\u2013||MF||||Alf Wood||2||0||0||2", "| December 1892 || MF ||  || Alf Wood || Smallthorne Albion || Free transfer ||  "]}, {"page": "1893\u201394 Burslem Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["They finished the season with a respectable 2\u20131 defeat to champions Liverpool at Anfield.
