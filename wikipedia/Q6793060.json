Soon after Friday left Cardiff, Reading manager Maurice Evans was presented with a petition, signed by 3,000 supporters, requesting that he attempt to re-sign Friday. Evans contacted Friday and told him: \"If you would just settle down for three or four years, you could play for England\". Friday replied with the question \"How old are you?\", and after Evans answered, continued: \"I'm half your age and I've lived twice your life\". Evans reflected, \"You may well be right\".
