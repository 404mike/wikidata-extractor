Amongst lighter stories, such as one about Colin accidentally attending a funeral dressed as a pink rabbit, the show tackled many serious issues. Jeff Evans, writing in the Guinness Television Encyclopedia, writes that the series adopts a \"far more adult approach\" than \"previous efforts in the same vein\" such as A Bunch of Fives. Some critics also compared it with Hill Street Blues, Lou Grant \"and other thoughtful US dramas, thanks to its realism and its level-headed treatment of touchy subjects.\" The first series approached solvent abuse in \"How To Make A Killing\", and the NSPCC assisted in the production of the \"Something Terrible\" episodes about child abuse. The team were held hostage by a gun enthusiast in series three's \"The Last Word\", while the final episode approaches drug abuse. The issue-led episodes served to develop the main characters, so that \"Something Terrible\" is more \"about Colin's redemption [from selfish capitalist], rather than Cindy's abuse.\"", "Jeff Evans also comments that the series was filmed cinematically, dabbling in \"dream sequences, flashbacks, fantasies and, on one occasion, a Moonlighting-esque parody of the film It's a Wonderful Life.\" The show had a strong awareness of continuity, with some stories, incidents and minor characters referred to throughout the series. Actors who played short-term characters in the first two series were invited back to reprise their roles in future episodes. David Jefford (Alex Crockett) was resurrected from 1989's \"Monday \u2013 Tuesday\" to appear in the final episode \"There Are Crocodiles\", while the same actress (Aisling Flitton) who played a wrong number in \"Love and the Junior Gazette\" was invited to reprise her character for the third series episode \"Chance is a Fine Thing.\" \"Attention to detail\" such as this is, according to Paul Cornell, \"one of the numerous ways that the series respects the intelligence of its viewers.\""]}, {"page": "British sitcom", "response": ["The commercial station ITV had popular successes with Rising Damp (1974\u201378, sometimes called the best of all ITV sitcoms),Phil Wickham \"Rising Damp (1974\u201378)\", BFI screenonline Man About the House (1973\u201376) and George and Mildred (1976\u201379).

Sources describe Supermarionation as a style of puppetry,Sangster and Condon, pp.\u00a0726-727. a production technique or process,O'Neill, p.\u00a04. or a promotional term. Emma Thom of the National Science and Media Museum defines it as APF's use of electronics to synchronise puppets' lip movements with pre-recorded dialogue. According to Jeff Evans, it \"express[es] the elaborate style of puppetry\" used in APF's productions. Anderson denied that the term referred to a process, stating that he coined it as a promotional tool to separate APF's output from other children's puppet series like Muffin the Mule and Flower Pot Men. This was motivated by his embarrassment in working with puppets as opposed to live actors, and his wish to dispel the notion that APF's marionettes were \"the sort of puppets that were used in pre-school programmes\".Hearn, p.\u00a032. He also likened Supermarionation to a \"trademark\".

Applauding the transfer of the electronics from the heads to the bodies, Evans describes the puppets as \"perfect in proportion\", while Peel argues that the increased realism would not have put off audiences familiar with the earlier design. A contrary view is held by Daniel O'Brien, who writes that the loss of the puppets' \"idiosyncratic character\" reduced them to the level of \"de luxe Action Men\". On the costume design, Mark Bould writes positively of the series' \"commitment to fashion\" and singles out the design of the Angel uniforms for particular praise.", "The series has been criticised for its camerawork, which some view as too static due to the crew's inability to move the puppets convincingly. Criticism has also been directed at the characterisation and writing. Sangster and Condon consider the plots uncomplicated and the characters perhaps \"even more simplistic\" than those of Stingray. Some have blamed the return to 25-minute episodes, coming after Thunderbirds 50-minute format, for a lack of subplots and perceived drop in the quality of the storytelling. In a 1986 interview, script editor Tony Barwick described Captain Scarlet as \"hard-nosed stuff\" that lacked humour, adding: \"It was all for the American market and to that extent there was no deep characterisation. [The characters] all balanced one against the other.\" Sylvia Anderson likened the presentation to that of a \"comic strip\", arguing that the action format came at the expense of the character development.Sellers, pp.\u00a0104\u2013105. In contrast, Jeff Evans believes the characters to be \"more detailed\" than before, arguing that Captain Scarlet was the first Anderson production to give them \"private lives and real identities\".
