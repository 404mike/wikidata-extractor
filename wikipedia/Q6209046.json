He was a centre forward.\nBorn in Kirkintilloch, Caven also played for Airdrie, Brighton & Hove Albion, Raith Rovers, Greenock Morton, and Stirling Albion, with a short time in South Africa playing for Addington and Germiston Callies.Having been given a free transfer by Raith Rovers at the end of the 1962\u201363 season, in July 1963, Caven signed for Inverness Caledonian, a Highland Football League club at that time, on the basis that if a Scottish League club came along for him he would be released from his contract by Inverness Caledonian. Within weeks after signing for Inverness Caledonian, Greenock Morton signed Joe and therefore he never appeared for Inverness Caledonian in the Highland Football League. Caven now lives in Nairn, near Inverness, in the North of Scotland.", "link_mentions": []}}
