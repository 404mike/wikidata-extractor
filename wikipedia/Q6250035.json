He then went to London where he visited the Glasshouse church, an early Particular Baptist (Reformed Baptist) congregation. Myles then returned to Ilston in Wales, where he served as a minister from 1649 to 1662 and he served as a \"tryer\" for ministers under Oliver Cromwell's government. After the restoration of the monarchy and requirement for all ministers to adhere to the Book of Common Prayer, Myles left England for the Plymouth Colony in the 1660s. Myles took the historic Ilston Book to North America with him, and it is now located at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. In America Myles worked with the Congregationalist state church in Rehoboth before his group was told to leave the town for its Baptist views, and Myles and his congregation (largely from Ilston, Wales) then founded the town of Swansea and First Baptist Church in Swansea. \"Swansea\" was named after a town in their homeland in Wales. Myles served as pastor for twenty years. During King Philip's War, Myles pastored the First Baptist Church in Boston while fleeing from the Indians.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Baptist Union of Wales", "response": ["The General Baptist minister Hugh Evans was one of the first Baptists to preach in Wales around 1646, in the parishes of Llan-hir, Cefnllys, Nantmel, and Llanddewi Ystradenny, as well as in districts across the upper Wye Valley in Breconshire. In 1649 John Myles (1621\u20131683) and Thomas Proud led in the formation of a congregation at Ilston, before Myles emigrated to Swansea, Massachusetts, in 1663. Myles and Proud were connected to the Particular Baptists in London. In 1650 three Baptist congregations held the first general meeting of Baptists in Wales. The national union was organized in 1866.
