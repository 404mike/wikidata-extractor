He currently teaches and undertakes research at St John's College, Oxford. Along with regular contributions to scientific journals, Grafen is known publicly for his work as co-editor (with Mark Ridley) of the 2006 festschrift Richard Dawkins: How a Scientist Changed the Way We Think, honouring the achievements of his colleague and former academic advisor. He has worked extensively in the field of biological game theory, and, in 1990, devised a model showing that Zahavi's well-known handicap principle could theoretically exist in natural populations.He also published a seminal paper in the field of phylogenetic comparative methods, in which he demonstrated how the tools of generalized least squares could be applied to perform phylogenetically informed statistical analyses.Grafen was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 2011.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Selfish Gene", "response": ["According to the ethologist Alan Grafen, acceptance of adaptionist theories is hampered by a lack of a mathematical unifying theory and a belief that anything in words alone must be suspect. According to Grafen, these difficulties along with an initial conflict with population genetics models at the time of its introduction \"explains why within biology the considerable scientific contributions it [The Selfish Gene] makes are seriously underestimated, and why it is viewed mainly as a work of exposition.\" According to comparative psychologist Nicky Hayes, \"Dawkins presented a version of sociobiology that rested heavily on metaphors drawn from animal behavior, and extrapolated these...One of the weaknesses of the sociological approach is that it tends only to seek confirmatory examples from among the huge diversity of animal behavior. Dawkins did not deviate from this tradition.\" More generally, critics argue that The Selfish Gene oversimplifies the relationship between genes and the organism. (As an example, see Thompson.)"]}, {"page": "W. D.

This is essentially a rediscovery of Michael Spence's job market signalling model, where the job applicant signals their quality by declaring a costly education.  In Grafen's model, the courting male's quality is signalled by investment in an extravagant trait\u2014such as the peacock's tail.  In both cases, the signal is reliable if the cost to the signaller of producing it is proportionately lower for higher-quality signallers than it is for lower-quality signallers (Fig. 2). Having read Grafen's mathematical modeling, Smith accepted the validity of the Handicap Principle."]}, {"page": "Evolutionary game theory", "response": ["On analysis, problems of biological life are not at all unlike the problems that define economics \u2013 eating (akin to resource acquisition and management), survival (competitive strategy) and reproduction (investment, risk and return). Game theory was originally conceived as a mathematical analysis of economic processes and indeed this is why it has proven so useful in explaining so many biological behaviours.  One important further refinement of the evolutionary game theory model that has economic overtones rests on the analysis of costs.  A simple model of cost assumes that all competitors suffer the same penalty imposed by the game costs, but this is not the case. More successful players will be endowed with or will have accumulated a higher \"wealth reserve\" or \"affordability\" than less-successful players.  This wealth effect in evolutionary game theory is represented mathematically by \"resource holding potential (RHP)\" and shows that the effective cost to a competitor with a higher RHP are not as great as for a competitor with a lower RHP.   As a higher RHP individual is a more desirable mate in producing potentially successful offspring, it is only logical that with sexual selection RHP should have evolved to be signalled in some way by the competing rivals, and for this to work this signalling must be done honestly. Amotz Zahavi has developed this thinking in what is known as the \"handicap principle\", where superior competitors signal their superiority by a costly display.  As higher RHP individuals can properly afford such a costly display this signalling is inherently honest, and can be taken as such by the signal receiver.  In nature this is illustrated than in the costly plumage of the peacock.  The mathematical proof of the handicap principle was developed by Alan Grafen using evolutionary game-theoretic modelling."]}, {"page": "Signaling game", "response": ["Valuable advances have been made by applying signaling games to a number of biological questions.  Most notably, Alan Grafen's (1990) handicap model of mate attraction displays.  The antlers of stags, the elaborate plumage of peacocks and bird-of-paradise, and the song of the nightingale are all such signals.  Grafen's analysis of biological signaling is formally similar to the classic monograph on economic market signaling by Michael Spence.  More recently, a series of papers by Getty shows that Grafen's analysis, like that of Spence, is based on the critical simplifying assumption that signalers trade off costs for benefits in an additive fashion, the way humans invest money to increase income in the same currency.  This assumption that costs and benefits trade off in an additive fashion might be valid for some biological signaling systems, but is not valid for multiplicative tradeoffs, such as the survival cost \u2013 reproduction benefit tradeoff that is assumed to mediate the evolution of sexually selected signals."]}, {"page": "Mark Ridley (zoologist)", "response": ["* Richard Dawkins: How a Scientist Changed the Way We Think (editor, with Alan Grafen) 2007 "]}, {"page": "Dollar, Clackmannanshire", "response": ["* The biologist Alan Grafen"]}, {"page": "Marian Dawkins", "response": ["* Living with the Selfish Gene.
