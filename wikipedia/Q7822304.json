He played as a forward for clubs including Cardiff City, for whom he made well over 100 appearances, and Birmingham City, for whom he was leading scorer in the 1981\u201382 season.Evans scored a hat-trick for Birmingham City against Manchester City in September 1981. This was the last top-flight hat-trick for Birmingham City until Mikael Forssell scored three against Tottenham Hotspur in 2008.\nHe then spent 21 games of the 1983-84 season with Crystal Palace, scoring seven goals - all of them away from home - to ensure their safety in the Second Division.He joined Swindon Town on a free transfer from Wolverhampton Wanderers in August 1985, staying for the whole season but only racking up 14 appearances - mostly in August and September, and none after January - before he went to Stafford Rangers in May 1986. He stayed there for one season.On retiring from football, he became a social worker, setting up the \"Midnight League\" to give young people an opportunity to play organised football at night as a diversion from possibly less constructive activities.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of people with surname Evans", "response": ["*Tony Evans (disambiguation), multiple people", "**Tony Evans (footballer, born 1954), English footballer for Cardiff City and Birmingham City", "**Tony Evans (footballer, born 1960), English footballer for Colchester United", "**Tony Evans (Australian footballer born 1966), Australian rules footballer with St Kilda and Footscray", "**Tony Evans (Australian footballer born 1969), Australian rules footballer with the West Coast Eagles", "**Tony Evans (New Zealand footballer), New Zealand international football (soccer) player", "**Tony Evans (radio), Christian pastor and a radio broadcaster"]}, {"page": "List of Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. seasons", "response": ["|align=left|Alan AinscowTony Evans "]}, {"page": "Tony Evans", "response": ["Tony Evans may refer to:", "*Tony Evans (Australian footballer born 1966), former Australian rules footballer with St Kilda and Footscray", "*Tony Evans (Australian footballer born 1969), former Australian rules footballer with the West Coast Eagles", "*Tony Evans (footballer, born 1954), English footballer for Cardiff City and Birmingham City", "*Tony Evans (footballer, born 1960), English footballer for Colchester United", "*Tony Evans (New Zealand footballer), New Zealand international football (soccer) player", "*Tony Evans (pastor), Christian pastor and a radio broadcaster", "*Tony Evans (EastEnders), a fictional character in soap opera, EastEnders"]}, {"page": "Tony Evans (footballer born 1954)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Tony Evans (footballer, born 1954)"]}]}}
