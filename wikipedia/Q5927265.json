He was an opponent of appeasement and broke the whip on several important occasions, voting to bring down Neville Chamberlain in 1940.\nA witty and handsome man who very much enjoyed the company of women, Duggan was married only briefly before becoming the plaintiff in a scandalous divorce case. He suffered from ill health; brought up in the Catholic faith, he lapsed in adolescence but returned when on his deathbed. Episodes in his life inspired writers Evelyn Waugh and Anthony Powell to fictionalise him.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "A Dance to the Music of Time", "response": ["|Drawn from Hubert Duggan, whose glamorous mother married Lord Curzon, Viceroy of India.
