Miniatures and optical effects were created by L.A. Effects Group. Cameron avoided using bigger special effects studios because he lacked contacts with them and believed his hands-on approach would not be welcomed. He avoided hiring too many Alien crew members because he did not want to be restricted by loyalties to the first film. Some crew did return, often with a higher status (such as Crispian Sallis, Alien focus puller and Aliens set decorator). Cameron had enjoyed returning artist Ron Cobb's work on Alien. Conceptual artist Syd Mead was recruited, since the director was a fan of his work on films such as 2010: The Year We Make Contact (1984).", "Aliens received two awards at the 1987 Academy Awards: Best Sound Effects Editing (Don Sharpe) and Best Visual Effects (Robert Skotak, Stan Winston, John Richardson, Suzanne Benson). Weaver was nominated for Best Actress, losing to Marlee Matlin for the romantic drama Children of a Lesser God. Weaver's was the first Best Actress nomination for a science-fiction film, when the genre was given little respect. The film received four other nominations: Best Original Score for Horner (losing to Herbie Hancock for the musical drama Round Midnight); Best Art Director for Peter Lamont and Crispian Sallis (losing to Gianni Quaranta, Brian Ackland-Snow, Brian Savegar and Elio Altamura for the romance, A Room with a View); Best Editing for Ray Lovejoy (losing to Claire Simpson for Platoon), and Best Sound for Graham V. Hartstone, Nicolas Le Messurier, Michael A. Carter, and Roy Charman (losing to John K. Wilkinson, Richard Rogers, Charles Grenzbach and Simon Kaye for Platoon). Weaver's nomination remains a rarity in the action or science-fiction genres. At the 44th Golden Globe Awards, she was nominated for Best Actress in a Drama (again losing to Matlin for Children of a Lesser God)."]}, {"page": "73rd Academy Awards", "response": ["** Gladiator\u00a0\u2013 Art Direction: Arthur Max; Set Decoration: Crispian Sallis"]}, {"page": "62nd Academy Awards", "response": ["** Driving Miss Daisy\u00a0\u2013 Art Direction: Bruno Rubeo; Set Decoration: Crispian Sallis"]}, {"page": "59th Academy Awards", "response": ["** Aliens\u00a0\u2013 Art Direction: Peter Lamont; Set Decoration: Crispian Sallis"]}, {"page": "Sallis", "response": ["* Crispian Sallis (born 1959), British art director, son of Peter"]}, {"page": "List of British Academy Award nominees and winners", "response": ["| Peter LamontCrispian Sallis", "|Crispian Sallis", "|Crispian Sallis"]}, {"page": "List of accolades received by Gladiator", "response": ["|Best Art Direction|| Arthur Max and Crispian Sallis || "]}, {"page": "List of accolades received by the Alien film series", "response": ["| Peter Lamont and Crispian Sallis"]}, {"page": "Timothy Crispian Sallis", "response": ["#REDIRECTCrispian Sallis"]}, {"page": "Elaine Usher", "response": ["Usher married actor Peter Sallis at St. John's Wood Church in London on 9 February 1957.
