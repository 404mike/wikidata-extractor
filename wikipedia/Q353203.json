Their work generally placed more emphasis on linear and melodic writing within a spectral context as compared to that of their French contemporaries, though with significant variations. Another important group of early spectral composers was centered in Romania, where a unique form of spectralism arose, in part inspired by Romanian folk music. This folk tradition, as collected by B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k (1904\u20131918), with its acoustic scales derived directly from resonance and natural wind instruments of the alphorn family, like the buciume and tulnice, as well as the cimpoi bagpipe, inspired several spectral composers, including Anatol Vieru, Aurel Stroe, \u0218tefan Niculescu, Hora\u021biu R\u0103dulescu, Iancu Dumitrescu, and Octavian Nemescu.", "Other spectral music composers include those from the German Feedback group, principally Johannes Fritsch, Mes\u00edas Maiguashca, P\u00e9ter E\u00f6tv\u00f6s, Claude Vivier, and Clarence Barlow.

Most of these composers tend to use quite sparse, pared-down musical material (sometimes showing the influence of the early 'naive' period of work from John Cage, and that of Morton Feldman, especially in the case of Zimmermann) to which are applied more intricate musical processes; in the latter respect, the influence of Stockhausen and Mauricio Kagel is clear, though some of the figures concerned believed their aesthetic to constitute a break with the avant-garde as represented in particular at Darmstadt. In the United States and the Americas composers like Samuel Barber, Miguel del Aguila and Astor Piazzolla challenged the concept of music as an experiment with works that became instantly popular and remained in the classical music repertoire to this day."]}, {"page": "Gabriel Pareyon", "response": ["He has a Ph.D. in musicology from the University of Helsinki, where he studied with Eero Tarasti (2006\u20132011).
