His father, also called George Harriman, was employed as a \"Motor Machinist\".He began his career in 1923 as an apprentice at the Hotchkiss works of Morris Motors Limited.  He was promoted repeatedly, becoming assistant works superintendent with Morris in 1938.  Two years later he switched to Austin in 1940, and by 1945 had become a director of that company. There followed a succession of promotions through the management of BMC, a car manufacturing conglomerate created from the merger in 1952 of the Morris and Austin businesses.\nIn the meantime, he had married Vera G Reynolds in 1936 who predeceased him dying in 1954 aged just 42 .   Three years later his sister married his late wife's brother.He was appointed Chairman and Managing Director of the British Motor Corporation in 1961, having in principal taken over many of the responsibilities involved some years earlier from Leonard Lord.In addition to his business career, he was a noted rugby football player, captaining the Coventry and Warwickshire teams in the 1930s, and playing briefly for the England team in 1933.Harriman was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1943 and Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1951, and was knighted in 1965.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "May 29", "response": ["*1973 \u2013 George Harriman, English businessman (b. 1908)"]}, {"page": "British Motor Corporation", "response": ["BMC was the largest British car company of its day, with (in 1952) 39% of British output, producing a wide range of cars under brand names including Austin, Morris, MG, Austin-Healey, Riley, and Wolseley, as well as commercial vehicles and agricultural tractors. The first chairman was Lord Nuffield (William Morris), but he was replaced at the end of 1952 by Austin's Leonard Lord, who continued in that role until his 65th birthday in 1961, but handing over, in theory at least, the managing director responsibilities to his deputy George Harriman in 1956.", "In mid-1965 BMC offered to buy its major supplier Pressed Steel and took control in September with 27,000 employees.B.M.C.-Pressed Steel's Defensive Merger  The Times, 23 July 1965; pg. 17; Issue 56381B.M.C.

Searjeant credits some of the failures at Longbridge to Lord's \"lack of vision\" and the \"inadequacy\" of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9-successor, George Harriman. Lord's biographer, Martyn Nutland, thinks this is unfair, and that Lord dealt imaginatively with the inescapable circumstances of the day. It was Lord who persuaded Alec Issigonis to rejoin BMC to create what became the Mini and the 1100, Austin/BMC's two most successful products. That Issigonis had the freedom to create such revolutionary cars is thanks to the mandate given to him by Lord. Gillian Bardsley, Archivist of the British Motor Heritage Trust, in her biography of Alec Issigonis, credits Lord with the vision that BMC needed an entirely new range of cars if it was to remain competitive into the 1960s."]}, {"page": "Harriman, Sir George William", "response": ["#redirectGeorge Harriman"]}, {"page": "George William Harriman", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Harriman"]}, {"page": "Harriman, George", "response": ["#redirectGeorge Harriman"]}]}}
