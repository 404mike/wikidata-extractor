He also briefly played in the top flight for both Queens Park Rangers and Chelsea, as well having as spells in the Football League with Fulham, Derby County and Sheffield United. He later played non-league football with Heybridge Swifts and Farnborough Town until retiring in 1997.

With a strong squad during his 1980\u20131984 period in charge (with players such as Ray Houghton, Tony Gale, Paul Parker, Gerry Peyton and Ray Lewington), they won promotion again in 1981\u201382 back to the Second Division, although the promotion was overshadowed by the suicide of former defender Dave Clement a few weeks before promotion was sealed."]}, {"page": "Gary Lineker", "response": ["In the 1990 World Cup, he scored four goals to help England reach the semi-finals. He was unwell during the tournament, and accidentally defecated during the opening group game against the Republic of Ireland. After Andreas Brehme sent England 1\u20130 down in the semi-final, Lineker received a pass from Paul Parker and escaped two West German defenders on his way to scoring the equaliser, but the West Germans triumphed in the penalty shoot-out and went on to win the trophy. Later he said: \"Football is a simple game; 22 men chase a ball for 90 minutes and at the end, the Germans win.\" Lineker's equaliser appears in the popular England national team anthem, \"Three Lions\", with the lyric \"When Lineker scored\"."]}, {"page": "Roberto Baggio", "response": ["In the bronze medal match against England, Baggio returned to the starting line-up, playing behind Schillaci. He scored Italy's first goal of the match after stealing the ball from Peter Shilton. David Platt momentarily equalised, but with five minutes left on the clock, Baggio set up Schillaci, who was fouled inside the area by Paul Parker. Although Baggio was the regularly designated penalty taker for his national team, he stepped aside to allow Schillaci to score and capture the Golden Shoe, a gesture which was praised by the Italian media. Baggio assisted a goal by Nicola Berti in the dying minutes of the match, but it was incorrectly ruled offside. Italy won the match 2\u20131, capturing the third place medal."]}, {"page": "Alex Ferguson", "response": ["During the 1991 close season, Ferguson's assistant Archie Knox departed to Rangers to become assistant to Walter Smith, and Ferguson promoted youth team coach Brian Kidd to the role of assistant manager in Knox's place. He also made two major signings \u2013 goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel and defender Paul Parker \u2013 to bolster his side. There was much anticipation about the breakthrough of the young Ryan Giggs, who had played twice and scored once in the 1990\u201391 campaign, and the earlier emergence of another impressive young winger in the shape of Lee Sharpe, who despite their youth had made Ferguson feel able to resist plunging into the transfer market and buying a new player to take over from the disappointing Danny Wallace on the left wing. He had also added Soviet midfielder Andrei Kanchelskis to the right wing, giving him a more attacking alternative to older midfielders Mike Phelan and Bryan Robson."]}, {"page": "Queens Park Rangers F.C.", "response": ["* Paul Parker (1987\u201391)"]}, {"page": "1990 FIFA World Cup", "response": ["The semi-final between West Germany and England at Juventus's home stadium in Turin was goalless at half-time.

On 81 minutes, Tony Dorigo crossed for Platt to place a powerful header into the corner of the Italian net, past Walter Zenga. Italy won the game when Paul Parker fouled Salvatore Schillaci.

After the World Cup, Butcher retired from international football with 77 caps and three goals to his name over a period of 10 years."]}, {"page": "Andreas Brehme", "response": ["As a member of the (West) Germany national team, Brehme took part at UEFA Euro 1984, the 1984 Summer Olympics, the 1986 FIFA World Cup, UEFA Euro 1988, the 1990 FIFA World Cup, UEFA Euro 1992, and the 1994 World Cup; he was named to the team of tournament at Euro 84, and helped Germany to the semi-finals of Euro 88, on home soil, scoring a goal in the nation's 1\u20131 opening draw against Italy. At Euro 1992, he won a runners-up medal, as Germany lost out 2\u20130 to Denmark in the final; he was once again named to the team of the tournament. Brehme won a runners-up medal at the 1986 FIFA World Cup, as Germany lost the final to Argentina, yet he won the World Cup in 1990 against the same opponents, later being named to the competition's All-star team. In the 1986 World Cup semi-final he scored a deflected free-kick against France, and in the 1990 semi-final he also scored a free-kick goal against England, which also took a deflection off of English defender Paul Parker, however. In the 1990 edition of the tournament, en route to the final, he also previously set up Klinsmann's headed goal in Germany's opening 4\u20131 against Yugoslavia, and scored the second goal against the Netherlands with a right-footed curler in the second round. In the 1990 World Cup final, a 1\u20130 victory over Argentina, he scored the goal, a penalty kick with his right foot. The only other penalty kick, taken in open play for Germany, was against England in a 1986 World Cup warm-up match in Mexico. Brehme missed his spot-kick, however, with Peter Shilton saving his shot. Brehme scored in the victorious penalty-shootout against Mexico in the 1986 World Cup quarter-finals with his left foot, while he scored his nation's first spot-kick in the penalty shoot-out victory against England in the 1990 World Cup semi-finals with his right foot. Brehme's last of his 86 caps for the national team came during the 1994 FIFA World Cup, which ended with a disappointing quarter-final exit for his team after a loss against Bulgaria."]}, {"page": "Ray Houghton", "response": ["Malcolm Macdonald had Tony Gale (later a Premier League title winner with Blackburn Rovers), Paul Parker (who went on to win several major trophies with Manchester United), Gerry Peyton (Republic of Ireland international goalkeeper) and Ray Lewington (ex-Chelsea) to form a mixture of youth and experience which ultimately won Fulham promotion to the Second Division at the end of the 1981\u201382 season. He then added Houghton to the side that would try to keep the Cottagers in the second division. They did, and comfortably so; in fact for much of the 1982\u201383 season it looked as though Fulham would achieve back-to-back promotions, however, their form after the turn of the year dipped. One of the most memorable sequences of matches that happened whilst Houghton was at Fulham was the League Cup third round tie against Liverpool in 1983. The first game finished 1\u20131 at Craven Cottage as did the replay at Anfield, Fulham then won the toss to take the second replay back to the Cottage. Many observers believe Fulham had done enough to have beaten the reigning cup holders but had let the Reds off the hook with their failure to put away the chances they created. Liverpool won the game 1\u20130 with a 25-yard thunderbolt from Graeme Souness."]}, {"page": "Garry Hill", "response": ["Hill began his non-league managerial career with Heybridge Swifts, following a spell managing Chelmsford Sunday League side Priory Sports, where he managed former professional players Alan Brazil, Micky Droy and Paul Parker.

However, he was in the side which faced the Republic of Ireland in the opening game. It ended 1\u20131 \u2013 not a disaster, but there were clear problems with the England personnel and tactics and Robson made changes for the next game. Stevens was replaced by Paul Parker, who played so well (despite being more usually a central defender for Queens Park Rangers) that he kept his place up to and including England's dramatic semi-final exit on penalties against West Germany, the eventual winners. Stevens was recalled to play the host nation in the third place play-off, which England lost 2\u20131."]}, {"page": "Lee Dixon", "response": ["Dixon made his England d\u00e9but in April 1990 in a World Cup warm-up game against Czechoslovakia. He played well, but there was little hope of him being in the squad for the tournament as he was at least third in the pecking order behind Gary Stevens and Paul Parker. Only injury to one of these two would have opened a door for Dixon to go to Italy and that didn't happen as the pair stayed fully fit for the length of the tournament. After the World Cup, new manager Graham Taylor instantly replaced Stevens and Parker with Dixon, who scored a goal at Wembley in his sixth international in an important Euro 92 qualifier against the Republic of Ireland.

He made 15 league appearances, scoring twice, and was given a free transfer at the end of the season, with his back problems becoming more evident. Joining Queens Park Rangers, he made a total of four appearances, scoring once (the winner against Blackburn in the FA Cup), and went on to play for Bury Town, Chelmsford City and Stambridge United.   Brazil left British football in 1988 to join Wollongong City (now the South Coast Wolves), a New South Wales-based club in Australia's National Soccer League. He returned to Europe to spend his final season (1988\u201389) with FC Baden of the Swiss Challenge League, the country's second division, before his playing career ended due to the serious back injury that had plagued him for seasons.
