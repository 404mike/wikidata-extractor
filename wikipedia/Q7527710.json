He was educated at the Middle Temple and Christ Church, Oxford.\nOn 29 August 1789, he married Mary Anne Broadhead (d. 19 January 1844), the great-granddaughter of Theodore, Baron Brinckman; they had seven children:\n\nSir George Dashwood, 5th Baronet\nFrancis Dashwood (d.

He was elected in 1796, holding the seat until 1831, playing an active role in local politics as well. An independent Tory, he was mobbed in Wycombe for his opposition to the Reform Bill in 1831, and left Parliament in 1831, preferring not to contest the election of 1832.\nMuch given to country life, he established the Bourton Hunt, a pack of harriers, at his Bourton estate in Gloucestershire and was also considered an excellent judge of horses. He disliked his country seat at West Wycombe as unsuitable for hunting and too expensive to maintain and attempted to sell it to the Duke of Somerset, but was unable to do so. He preferred to live in Halton House, near Aylesbury.\nDue to heavy investment in land in Buckinghamshire, he died burdened by poverty and crushing debt and was succeeded in the baronetcy by George Henry, who was Liberal Member for Buckinghamshire and for Wycombe until his death in 1862, when it passed briefly to George Henry's brother John Richard and then to the son of his other brother Edwin.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dashwood baronets", "response": ["*Sir John Dashwood-King, 4th Baronet (1765 \u2013 22 October 1849) was an English landowner, who succeeded his father in the baronetcy and inherited West Wycombe in 1793.
