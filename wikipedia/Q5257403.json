The resulting work featured two Irish limestone figures entitled, \"Contrapuntal Forms\" (1950), which was displayed on London's South Bank; it was later donated to the New Town of Harlow and displayed in Glebelands, where it remains.

He had his first solo exhibition at the Newlyn Gallery near Penzance in 1959, and his first solo exhibition in London at the St Martin's Gallery in 1962.  Retrospectives were held at various venues from 1966 to 2004, particularly at Penwith Gallery in 1966, the Museum of Modern Art in Oxford in 1975, the Royal Cornwall Museum in Truro in 2000, and the Victoria Art Gallery in Bath in 2004.  Examples of his work are held by many public galleries.  His business affairs were dealt with first by his family and ultimately by trustees, enabling him to concentrate on his art. In the second half of his career a good deal of his work was produced and sold in the form of prints in relatively small signed, numbered editions. Some of these were small hand-made etchings, with which the artist had a 'hands on' creative involvement; others were full size screenprints made by printer-craftsmen 'after' works in other media. The latter certainly render just over twenty of Pearce's original images, with their pure, expansive areas of specific colours, extremely convincingly. Two of the earliest screenprints, 'St Ives All Round' and 'Newlyn All Round' (both 1976) were printed in black line only. A number of one-colour lithographs also exist."]}, {"page": "Breon O'Casey", "response": ["Breon was educated at Dartington Hall School in Devon, and following his national service duty, O'Casey attended the Anglo-French Art School, a small school in St John's Wood, London, based on the French model.

In St Ives too, he began making jewelry as a side line, although his main occupation was always painting.

His mother was Cornish and from 1936 to 1945, he worked as a General Practitioner for the Isles of Scilly. After the Second World War he decided to pursue a full-time career as an artist.

They divorced in 1952 and Dean left Africa with her mother to return to England where they struggled financially.

Serebrin, Kylie, \"Revealing Life's Mysteries,\" Arabella Magazine (Spring/Summer 2014) Dean was accepted to grammar school and studied science before turning to art. Dedicating herself to sculpture, she hitchhiked to St Ives, Cornwall and studied informally with Denis Mitchell before formal training under John Hoskin at the Bath School of Art and Design between 1961-64. It was through these mentors that she had occasion to meet Barbara Hepworth in the 1960s.

In the following year he attended the Acad\u00e9mie de la Grande Chaumi\u00e8re, in Paris. For two years he was then a pupil of the sculptor Barbara Hepworth and her assistant, along with amongst others, the sculptor Denis Mitchell. Although some of Hepworth\u2019s assistants later moved away from her style, Milne\u2019s work continued to bear some relation to it. In 1956, he purchased Trewyn House, a large property in St Ives, next to Hepworth's studio (her studio had once been an outbuilding of his house), which provided him with studio space and a view to the sea below. Milne from the early 1960s visited Greece regularly, an influence which showed itself in works such as Gnathos, owned by the Tate Gallery. The artist wrote: \u2018I often cast works with more than one type of finish in order to be absolutely sure that the final result is the most perfect that I can obtain. I consider the polished bronze of Gnathos as the ultimate fulfilment of my original idea. The Greek word \u201cGnathos\u201d means \u201cjaw\u201d or \u201cjawbone\u201d which describes my feeling of \u201cbiting\u201d or \u201cgetting ones teeth into\u201d something, be that something my life or my work\u2014this was the emotion of the sculpture. Gnathos was a complete change of direction in my work at that point (1960). I have since carried out many other sculptures and reliefs which continue this pincer-like feeling amongst which are Totemic II and the relief Icarus'.", "One-man exhibitions included several at Marjorie Parr Gallery (1969 & 1972), Lad Lane Gallery, Dublin, and a retrospective at the Plymouth City Museum and Art Gallery in 1971. His reputation grew and his work was collected and exhibited extensively in the UK and abroad; exhibitions were held in Vancouver in 1974 and, jointly with Denis Mitchell and Enzo Plazzotta, in Saudi Arabia in 1976; several Milne exhibitions were also mounted in the USA. He continued to live and work in St Ives until his death in 1978 at the age of 47. The Belgrave Gallery exhibition in 2000 marked the publication of Peter Davies\u2019s The Sculpture of John Milne."]}]}}
