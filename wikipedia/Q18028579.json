He served as a professor of industrial chemistry at the University of Liverpool.\nHilditch was born in North Islington to Thomas and Priscilla n\u00e9e Hall. He was educated at Owen's School where he was influenced in science by his teachers F.R. Guglielmo and A.E. Dunstan. He joined University College, London to study chemistry under William Ramsay and J. Norman Collie graduating in 1907. He then worked at the University of Jena in 1908\u20131909 with Ludwig Knorr and University of Geneva 1910\u20131911 with P.A. Guye before returning to London to complete studies. He received a D.Sc. in 1911. Hilditch was involved in industrial research with Joseph Crosfield and Sons to produce acetone during World War I. In 1925 he joined the University of Liverpool as a professor of Industrial Chemistry. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1942 and made OBE 1952. He received the Lampitt Medal of The Society of Chemical Industry for 1962.Some of his major books were:\n\nA Concise History of Chemistry (1911, 1922)\nA First Year Physical Chemistry (1912)\nA Third Year Course in Organic Chemistry (1914)\nThe Industrial Chemistry of the Fats and Waxes (1927)\nThe Chemical Composition of Natural Fats (1940)", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society G, H, I", "response": ["| Thomas Percy Hilditch||19/03/1942||22 April 1886 \u2013 9 August 1965"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1942", "response": ["*Thomas Percy Hilditch"]}, {"page": "Brian Shorland", "response": ["After a BSc and a MSc in organic chemistry he worked for the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, before earning a scholarship to go to the University of Liverpool for a PhD under Thomas Percy Hilditch, studying fish liver oils and fats from farm animals."]}, {"page": "Hilditch", "response": ["*Thomas Percy Hilditch (1886\u20131965), English chemist"]}, {"page": "James Campbell Brown", "response": ["Brown was born in Aberdeen where his father George Brown lived while also working as a chemical manufacturer in London at Bow Common Alum Works. Brown was educated at the Old Aberdeen Gymnasium under Dr Alexander Anderson (1808-1884) and then at the Marischal College. In 1863 he joined the Royal College of Chemistry, London, studying under John Tyndall, August Wilhelm von Hofmann and others. He graduated with a BSc in 1867 and received a university scholarship leading to a doctorate in 1870. He taught chemistry at Aberdeen and then went to lecture at the Liverpool Royal Infirmary School of Medicine. He married Ellen Fullarton, daughter of John Henderson of Aberdeenshire in 1872. He also taught at the School of Medicine in Liverpool. Campbell was involved in the creation of the University of Liverpool. In 1881 he was made chair of chemistry endowed by a Mr Grant of Rock Ferry. He was also involved in water quality studies for the City of Liverpool Water Works. As a specialist also on forensic chemistry he was often called as an expert in court cases. A member of the Society of Chemical Industry, he also undertook soil and plant nutrient studies and suggested a fertilizer for the tea industry in India. He died from a heart attack following influenza. His wife Ellen died in 1923 and she had been told to set aside from the value of his estate, money for the establishment of a chair in chemistry at the University of Liverpool after her death. In 1925, a chair of industrial chemistry was accordingly created and Thomas Percy Hilditch appointed."]}, {"page": "T. P. Hilditch", "response": ["#redirect Thomas Percy Hilditch"]}, {"page": "T.P.
