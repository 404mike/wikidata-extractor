In an innings of 67 not out against Yorkshire at Bramall Lane, Sheffield he scored 22 runs in one four-ball over from Saul Wade, which is still the record for the most runs scored of a four-ball over in first-class cricket history.", "The cricket writer Ray Robinson suggests that Scott's batting \"was noted for grit rather than gaiety\" but he did sometimes reveal an adventurous streak as shown when he landed a ball from A. G. Steel onto the pavilion roof at The Oval and by his assault on Saul Wade's bowling at Bramall Lane. In 1884, England found that Scott was the hardest man to bowl out in the Australian team."]}, {"page": "William Morgan (cricketer, born 1864)", "response": ["A club cricketer who played for both Sefton and Stanley, Morgan was selected to play for Liverpool and District in a first-class match against Yorkshire in 1889.
