It was joined by Herbert Chermside, who was in charge of logkeeping, and naturalist Alfred Edwin Eaton. The objective was to venture beyond the northeast edge of Svalbard and also to search for Nordenski\u00f6ld's expedition which had not yet returned. On 13 June, Diana learned from a Norwegian fishing vessel at Danes Island that Nordenski\u00f6ld's expedition had been frozen in at Mosselbukta and  was starving. Leigh Smith reached the 3 beset ships on the same day and aided them with his provisions. For this act of salvation he later received the Swedish Royal Order of the Polar Star. The expedition undertook some exploring, but did not succeed in reaching much further than previously."]}, {"page": "Rhithrogena germanica", "response": ["R. germanica was first described by Alfred Edwin Eaton based on a single male imago collected from the River Rhine at Laufenburg, Switzerland.
