After being apprenticed as a gardener at Brathay Hall in the  English Lake district, he travelled to London to work at the Hugh Low, Enfield Nursery, then onto the Veitch establishment at Coombe Wood. In 1902, Purdom took up a position as a gardener at Kew Botanic Garden soon becoming promoted to a sub-foreman (leading-hand) position. Purdom became heavily involved with early Union activities particularly promoting the rights of junior workers which eventually led to his unjustified dismissal. Despite being a bane to the, then, Kew Director, David Prain, the latter recognized the talents of William Purdom and recommended his employee as being very suitable as a plant collector for a joint venture by Veitch and the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University to the northern provinces of China in 1909.Purdom collected and photographed plants for the Arboretum, as well as the great British Nursery firm for three years 1909- 1911. Over many months in the field, he travelled and collected from as far north as Duolun Nor and Jehol, to Wutaishan, out to Yulin and Yan'an on the fringes of the Ordos desert, to the peaks of Tabaishan, as well as in the Minshan Mountains and Lamashan near Jone. He failed in an attempt to reach the monastery of Labrang and the Amnye Machen range due to the hostility of the local lamas. In this period of severe turmoil in China, Purdom's life was at risk on several occasions\nIn 1914, Purdom and the well-known English horticulturalist, Reginald Farrer, set out on an ambitious expedition to Qinghai then Tibetan Amdo and the Province of Kansu province of North-west China. Extensive plant collections were made by the pair through the Minshan Ranges and 'Stony Mountains' in their first season, followed by explorations in the Datong Mountains just to the north-west of Xining. Purdom himself travelled as far west as Lake Qinghai (KokoNor)in search of new plants. Their base camps included Zhugqu (Siku), Jone, as well as the Buddhist monasteries of Quezang (Chebson Abbey) and Tiantang. After completing the work in Gansu, Purdom and Farrer returned overland, travelling by horseback and river-boat southwards through the Dabashan Range and into the Szechuan basin before returning to the coast by way of the Yangtze River steamboat service. The expedition was a great success despite the very definite threats to their lives both from superstitious Tibetan locals and the 'White Wolves' rebels.\nThese two years of exploring and plant collecting are described in Farrer's On the Eaves of the World (2 vols) (1917), and Farrer's posthumous The Rainbow Bridge (1921). In those volumes, Farrer very much indicates that the expedition could not have succeeded without the drive, the organisational talents and experience of his co-worker William Purdom.\nFollowing the expedition, Purdom chose to remain in China and in 1916 was appointed  an Inspector of Forests to the Chinese Government in Beijing, particularly concerning himself with re-afforestation projects. When that department was dissolved in 1918, he  transferred to the section of  government planning the development of the rapidly expanding railway system. In the later capacity he was based in the city of Xinyang on the Beijing to Hankou rail-line working under the eminent Chinese forester, Han An.  Here, a hundred years later, Purdom has been afforded a unique Chinese honour, with the Purdom Forest Park, containing some of his original plantings, named in his recognition. At this point he came into professional contact with the Belgian railway engineer and  botanical collector, Joseph Hers, who was himself working on the new railway heading towards Xi'an. Hers acknowledged their friendship and collaboration in an article that he wrote in 1923.\nThe pair with similar interests and a love for China, planned to edit Flora of China, but the plan was abandoned probably owing to the premature death of Purdom in Beijing 1921 from complications following a minor operation on an infected gland in his neck. Hers went on to acknowledge Purdom, both as a friend and botanical collaborator in his later writings in the Bulletin de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Dendrologique de France..Purdom collected very many plants new to science and horticulture. Although many of the epithets originally given in his honour have been superseded, quite a number across a wide spectrum of genera still remain in use. These names were given by botanists at both the Arnold Arboretum using the specimens that he had sent there, and those at Kew (whence he had been earlier dismissed) when studying flowering specimens of new plants sent there by the Veitch Nursery.\nPurdom's eponymous species include:\nRhododendron purdomii,\nPopulus purdomii,\nLigularia purdomii,\nDryopteris purdomii,\nGentiana purdomii,\nPrimula purdomii,\nCaragana purdomii,\nBerberis purdomii,\nLeptodermis purdomii,\nAstralagus purdomii,\nDracocephalum purdomii.\nBotanical records now reveal that it was Purdom who first discovered the peony species, P. fruticosa and P. rockii; the latter find made more than a decade before the collections made by the explorer Joseph Rock.\nPublished articles by William Purdom\nPurdom, W.

Gardeners\u2019 Chronicle. pp .346-347.\nPurdom's Legacy.\nPurdom collected several hundred herbarium specimens under his own name, most of which are represented at the Arnold Arboretum and Kew Garden's herbariums. He became an accomplished photographer and a large collection of his images are held at the Arnold Arboretum and can be viewed on line. Farrer himself indicated that many of the photographs which he used in his lectures and in his 'China' books were in fact taken by Purdom. Many of the latter, and also extremely interesting photographs that Purdom took whilst in China in 1916-1920 are held at the RBG Edinburgh on behalf of the Lakeland Horticultural Society.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of botanists", "response": ["*William Purdom"]}, {"page": "Arnold Arboretum", "response": ["At present, the living collections include 14,980 individual plants (including nursery holdings) belonging to 10,117 accessions representing 3,924 taxa; with particular emphasis on the ligneous species of North America and eastern Asia.

One was planted in RBGE; the two not planted in the Garden may survive in Edinburgh, as it was the practice of the Garden to distribute trees about the city. Kew Gardens obtained specimens of U. pumila from the Arnold Arboretum in 1908 and, as U. pekinensis, via the Veitch Nurseries in 1910 from William Purdom in northern China.Elwes and Henry (1913), p.1927 A specimen obtained from Sp\u00e4th and planted in 1914 stood in the Ryston Hall arboretum, Norfolk,rystonhall.co.uk/ in the early 20th century.

More recently, the popularity of U. pumila in the Great Britain has been almost exclusively as a bonsai subject, and mature trees are largely restricted to arboreta."]}, {"page": "David Prain", "response": ["Perhaps Prain's most difficult time as Director of the Kew gardens was in the years 1904-1908 when he was one of the lead players in an industrial dispute which pitted him against his garden staff and the Kew Garden trade union. Surprisingly his chief adversary was his sub-foreman, William Purdom, representing a band of young gardener trainees. The dispute arose because a cohort of these trainees were not fully informed that their positions were only temporary. In addition to that the gardens industrial conditions were onerous, with a salary for someone such as Purdom well below the usual rates. William Purdom was ferocious as the union representative, bringing the newspapers of the time, the Kew Guild and leading politicians into the fray. Strikes and go-slows became a heated occurrence with Prain perhaps unfortunately blamed for an error made by his predecessor. Prain, who came from a humble background himself, was aware that his workers' grievances were well justified and went out of his way to find alternative positions in private employ for all those affected. Purdom appears to have continued the fight on principle and on a personal basis for another year until Prain finally made it a case that his combative gardener Purdom had to go, or he himself would. The establishment had no option but to back the Kew Director. The bizarre and unexpected twist however came in the final days just before Christmas 1908. Despite being a bane to the Kew Director, the latter clearly recognized the talents of William Purdom and recommended his employee as a plant collector for a joint venture by Harry Veitch and the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University to the northern provinces of China in 1909. No sooner had Purdom's dismissal been finalized, than that same establishment arranged for the British administration, including the Legation in Beijing, to give him all assistance. David Prain was evidently a very fair and honourable man.Watt, Alistair (2019). Purdom and Farrer Plant Hunters on the Eaves of China. ' Published by author in an edition limited to 250 copies.

He cultivated some of the novelties collected in Yunnan and Gansu in his garden at Highdown. Other plant hunters sent new plants to Stern, and he acquired an extensive collection of plants from Veitch & Son in 1912. Over the years, Stern introduced many new plants to the garden and created new hybrids of Berberis, Eremurus, hellebore, lily, Magnolia, rose and snowdrop, among which Magnolia 'Highdownensis' (probable cultivar of M. wilsonii), rambler roses 'Coral' (a triploid R. sinowilsonii hybrid), 'Weddingday' (1950, R. sinowilsonii hybrid), and Rosa \u00d7highdownensis (1928, R. moyesii hybrid).
