There was much speculation amongst many established England players as to what changes the new coach would bring to the England setup, particularly one with such close ties to a successful Bath Rugby Club. Rowell claimed he would rid England of the cautious, forward-dominated 10-man game which had done so well for them earlier in the decade, and play running rugby more similar to Bath's. Leonard kept his place in the England team, which now included several new players such as Mike Catt, Ben Clarke, Victor Ubogu, Steve Ojomoh (all Bath players) and Tim Rodber. In the 1995 Five Nations, Leonard won a record (for a prop) 38th cap for England, playing against Scotland, and the victory meant his third Grand Slam."]}, {"page": "West Buckland School", "response": ["*Steve Ojomoh (born 1970), former Bath and England rugby player"]}, {"page": "Birmingham Moseley Rugby Club", "response": ["*  Steve Ojomoh"]}, {"page": "Nigeria national rugby union team", "response": ["*Steve Ojomoh - England"]}, {"page": "1994 England rugby union tour of South Africa", "response": ["| Steve Ojomoh", "|FL ||16||Steve Ojomoh || || ", "|OF ||7 ||Steve Ojomoh"]}, {"page": "1998 England rugby union tour of Australasia and South Africa", "response": ["Tony Diprose (Saracens), Steve Ojomoh (Bath), Richard Pool-Jones (Stade Francais Paris), Ben Sturnham (Saracens), Ben Clarke (Richmond), Pat Sanderson (Sale Sharks), Lewis Moody (Leicester Tigers)."]}, {"page": "List of England national rugby union players", "response": ["|1153||Steve Ojomoh||no. 8 ||1994-02-19||v Ireland at Twickenham"]}, {"page": "Rugby union in Nigeria", "response": ["* Steve Ojomoh"]}, {"page": "Clash of the Codes (rugby)", "response": ["|SR ||7|| Steve Ojomoh", "|No8 ||8|| Steve Ojomoh", "Although Bath were evidently outmatched in the first game, they were able to take some positives; Phil de Glanville made the most tackles of any back on either side, while de Glanville, Steve Ojomoh, Jon Callard and Adedayo Adebayo all impressed watching league experts. Similarly, in the second game, as Bath tired, Wigan were able to exploit both their superior fitness and their superior running game to gain a foothold during the second half. However, one of Bath's star players at the time, England centre Jeremy Guscott, refused to play in the series, as he felt that there was a lack of balance between the two games - the only alteration that took place in the league fixture came at half-time when Bath requested unlimited substitutions (rather than the fixed number of ten interchanges normally permitted); apart from this, the match was played as a standard, full intensity game of rugby league. In the union fixture however, although there was a greater intensity to the scrummaging than league players would normally experience, the scrums were not fully contested, as scrummaging in rugby union is highly technical, particularly in the front row. Had the scrums been fully contested, Guscott stated that it was likely a number of the Wigan forwards could have been seriously injured. But, this meant that Wigan were able to gain more of a foothold in the union fixture than Bath had been able to do in the league fixture."]}, {"page": "1996 Five Nations Championship squads", "response": ["# Steve Ojomoh"]}, {"page": "1995 Five Nations Championship squads", "response": ["# Steve Ojomoh"]}, {"page": "1994 Five Nations Championship squads", "response": ["# Steve Ojomoh"]}]}}
