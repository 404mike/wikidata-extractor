However, Home Office papers show that she was force fed on 23 February 1913.Home Office Papers, The National Archives A letter to The Times in 1913, from Victor Horsley, a leading surgeon, claimed \"...the Home Secretary's attempted denial that Miss Lenton was nearly killed by the forcible feeding is worthless...she was tied into a chair and her head dragged backward across the back of the chair by her hair.

This was the first time she went on a hunger strike, but with the others was released early as the fines had been paid, anonymously.
