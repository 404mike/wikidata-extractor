She also was the first holder of the title Princess Royal.\nThe eldest daughter of King Charles I of England and Queen Henrietta Maria, Mary was married to the future stadtholder of the Netherlands, William II of Orange, at 9 years old in 1641. Initially, she remained in England with her parents because of the heated political situation in England until early 1642, when she and her mother left for the Netherlands. Five years later in 1647, Mary's husband inherited the titles of Prince of Orange and Stadtholder of Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht, Guelders, Overijssel and Groningen in the United Provinces of the Netherlands.\nEight days after her husband's death in 1650, Mary gave birth to a son, William III of Orange, who later became King of England, Scotland and Ireland. Mary, who became the only guardian of her son, was not popular in the Netherlands because of her support of her brothers and her difficult relationship with her mother-in-law Amalia of Solms-Braunfels, who considered the princess young and inexperienced. After the restoration of the monarchy in England in 1660, Mary departed for celebrations in London, where she fell ill with smallpox and died.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "December 24", "response": ["*1660 \u2013 Mary, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange (born 1631)"]}, {"page": "November 4", "response": ["*1631 \u2013 Mary, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange (d. 1660)"]}, {"page": "1631", "response": ["* November 4 \u2013 Mary, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange (d. 1660)"]}, {"page": "1660", "response": ["* December 24 \u2013 Mary, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange (b. 1631)"]}, {"page": "William III of England", "response": ["William was the only child of William II, Prince of Orange, and Mary, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange, the daughter of Charles I of England, Scotland, and Ireland.

In 1677, he married Mary, the eldest daughter of his maternal uncle James, Duke of York, the younger brother of Charles II of England, Scotland, and Ireland. The Protestant William participated in several wars against the powerful Catholic French ruler Louis XIV in coalition with both Protestant and Catholic powers in Europe. Many Protestants heralded William as a champion of their faith. In 1685, his Catholic uncle and father-in-law, James, became king of England, Scotland, and Ireland. James's reign was unpopular with the Protestant majority in Britain, who feared a revival of Catholicism. Supported by a group of influential British political and religious leaders, William invaded England in what became known as the Glorious Revolution. In 1688, he landed at the south-western English port of Brixham. Shortly afterwards, James was deposed."]}, {"page": "House of Orange-Nassau", "response": ["Frederick Henry and Amalia were the parents of a son and several daughters.
