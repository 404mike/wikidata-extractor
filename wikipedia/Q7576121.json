Supporters of London's independence argued that London's demographic, culture and values are different from the rest of England, and that it should become a city state similar to Singapore, while remaining an EU member state. Spencer Livermore, Baron Livermore, said that London's independence \"should be a goal,\" arguing that a London city-state would have twice the GDP of Singapore.
