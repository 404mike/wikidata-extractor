However, the Stones, who had returned to their original guise of Maidstone United in 1997, took four years and six managers before finally winning promotion to the Kent County League Premier Division with former Stones player turned manager Jason Lillis leading the club to the Division One title.

The next season saw the club, which was now managed by another former Maidstonian in Matt Toms, successfully apply to become a senior club and finish second in the league.

However, Tucker and Whiteley could not get Maidstone promoted to the County League Premier Division, and Maidstone went through a succession of managers before finally winning promotion in 1999. Graham Martin was appointed in the wake of Tucker and Whiteley in 1996, but lasted less than a year before being replaced by Mickey Chatwin and Chad Andrews, with Maidstone again opting to employ joint managers. However Chatwin and Andrews did not last the season and were replaced by Nicky Chappell, before Mark Irvine took over for the 1997\u201398 season. Irvine was not the man to bring success to the Stones either, and he was succeeded by Jason Lillis.
