The role won him favourable reviews and caught the attention of the dramatist, Emlyn Williams, who offered Burton a small role of the lead character's elder brother, Glan, in his play The Druid's Rest. The play debuted at the Royal Court Theatre, Liverpool on 22 November 1943, and later premiered in St Martin's Theatre, London in January 1944. Burton thought the role was \"a nothing part\" and that he \"hardly spoke at all\". He was paid ten pounds a week for playing the role (), which was \"three times what the miners got\". Alpert states that the play garnered mixed critical reviews,  but James Redfern of the New Statesman took notice of Burton's performance and wrote: \"In a wretched part, Richard Burton showed exceptional ability.\" Burton noted that single sentence from Redfern changed his life.", "While touring with the cast and crew members of Wynyard Browne's Dark Summer, Burton was called by Emlyn Williams for a screen test for his film, The Last Days of Dolwyn (1949). Burton performed the screen test for the role of Gareth, which Williams wrote especially for him, and was subsequently selected when Williams sent him a telegram that quoted a line from The Corn Is Green  \"You have won the scholarship.\" This led to Burton making his mainstream film debut. Filming took place during the summer and early autumn months of 1948. It was on the sets of this film that Burton was introduced by Williams to Sybil Williams, whom he married on 5 February 1949 at a register office in Kensington. The Last Days of Dolwyn opened to generally positive critical reviews. Burton was praised for his \"acting fire, manly bearing and good looks\" and film critic Philip French of The Guardian called it an \"impressive movie debut\". After marrying Sybil, Burton moved to his new address at 6 Lyndhurst Road, Hampstead NW3, where he lived from 1949 to 1956.", "Burton admired and was inspired by the actor and dramatist Emlyn Williams.
