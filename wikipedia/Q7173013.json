His contribution to the region's infrastructure and development extended far beyond the railways, however, and included the renovation of the Colchester water supply (1851-1880) and the Ipswich sewerage system (completed 1881), the development of the town of Harwich and the Essex resorts of Walton-on-the-Naze and Clacton on Sea (which he built up from an empty piece of farmland into a flourishing seaside town), and (not least) the late Victorian revival of the Coalport porcelain factory in Shropshire, which he purchased in 1880.", "link_mentions": {}}}
