He joined the Communist Party of Great Britain there in 1960 before being recruited with other shop stewards to Gerry Healy's then Socialist Labour League in 1966. However, in 1974 he and most of the Cowley group were expelled - from what had become the Workers Revolutionary Party the previous year - with around 200 other members. Around a hundred of them went on to form the Workers Socialist League (WSL) of which Thornett was a leader. It established an international tendency, the Trotskyist International Liaison Committee, and fused with the International-Communist League in 1981.  Political differences emerged in the new organisation with parts of the ex-WSL splitting off before those remaining were expelled in 1984.Thornett and his comrades regrouped as the Socialist Group and then fused with the International Group to form the International Socialist Group (ISG) in 1987; the ISG dissolved into Socialist Resistance in 2009. Thornett is now a leader of the Fourth International. \nThornett successfully argued for the ISG to exit the Labour Party and join the Socialist Alliance. Later, he supported the Alliance's dissolution in favour of the Respect Coalition. In the 2007 split in Respect, the ISG sided with the Respect Renewal faction around George Galloway against the SWP. Thornett sat on Respect's National Council until Socialist Resistance left Respect in 2010. \nThornett is the author of three volumes of autobiography: From Militancy to Marxism, Inside Cowley and Militant Years, and of Facing the Apocalypse - Arguments for Ecosocialism", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Workers' Socialist League", "response": ["The Workers Socialist League (WSL) was a Trotskyist group in Britain.  The group was formed by Alan Thornett and other members of the Workers Revolutionary Party (WRP) after their expulsion from that group in 1974.", "In March 1983 the IT declared that it was now a faction, thus becoming the Internationalist Faction (IF), and it adopted a number of documents in which their criticisms of the leadership was stepped up. But there were by now tensions in the IF as some members became sympathetic to Workers Power and left to join that group.  Others sympathised with the international tendency around the Workers' Party (Argentina), the Latin American Tendencia Cuarta Internacional (TCI). The next stage in the developing split was the April 1983 TILC meeting at which the WSL delegates voted to prevent Chilean sympathisers from affiliating to the TILC. The WSL then walked out after a resolution calling on Alan Thornett to fight Sean Matgamna's \"revisionism\". The IF, who sympathised with the TILC, were then expelled from the WSL, and formed the Workers Internationalist League.", "The WSL was a little smaller after the expulsion of the IF and still split between the supporters of Sean Matgamna and Alan Thornett. Thornett's supporters stopped paying subscriptions to the group and called several special conferences.

As a result, they became known as the Bulletin Group, aligned with Lambert's Organising Committee for the Reconstruction of the Fourth International to which the Hamilton-Vince-Stratford group were already linked.  A heterogeneous tendency, they attempted to act as an 'external' faction of the SLL, with the aim of winning over more SLL members. The Marxist Bulletin, which commented on SLL-WRP (the Socialist Labour League had become the Workers Revolutionary Party) politics and activities and gave a voice to the ideas of the OCRFI, was successfully infiltrated into the SLL, angering Healy who accused the group of writing substantial sections of documents circulated internally by SLL trade union leader Alan Thornett, who had formed an opposition grouping within the SLL and was soon to leave and form the Workers Socialist League.  Healy supporters physically threatened Bulletin Group members and a leading SLL member boasted publicly that houses had been burgled and infiltrators sent in. Thornett did have meetings with Blick and Jenkins from the Bulletin Group, who reached him via Kate Blakeney (a leading member of the WRP) in Reading and Ray Howells in Swindon.
