They received their first mention in a national newspaper in April, with a Daily Star reporter describing them as \"the most exciting band to emerge this year\". They self-released an EP, featuring the single \"Fake Tales of San Francisco\", in May and commenced their first nationwide tour soon afterwards. In June, in the midst of a bidding war, Arctic Monkeys signed to the independent label Domino Recording Company. After initial sessions with James Ford and Mike Crossey, they recorded an album in rural Lincolnshire with producer Jim Abbiss. Turner began dating London-based student Johanna Bennett around this time. In October, the single \"I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor\" debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart. Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not, Arctic Monkeys' debut album, was released in January 2006, and debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart. Turner's lyrics, chronicling teenage nightlife in Sheffield, were widely praised. Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times remarked: \"Mr. Turner's lyrics are worth waiting for and often worth memorizing, too ... He has an uncanny way of evoking Northern English youth culture while neither romanticizing it nor sneering at it.\" Musically, Alexis Petridis of The Guardian noted that the album was influenced by guitar bands \"from the past five years ... Thrillingly, their music doesn't sound apologetic for not knowing the intricacies of rock history.\"", "Arctic Monkeys' second album, Favourite Worst Nightmare, was released in April 2007, just over a year after their debut. It was produced in London by Mike Crossey and James Ford. As of 2020, Ford has produced every subsequent Turner project. Lyrically, the album touches on fame, love, and heartache. Turner and Bennett had ended their relationship in January; she was credited as a co-writer on \"Fluorescent Adolescent\". While uninterested in the songs concerning fame, Marc Hogan of Pitchfork said the album displayed Turner's \"usual gift for vivid imagery\" and explored \"new emotional depth\". Petridis of The Guardian noted that the band were \"pushing gently but confidently at the boundaries of their sound\", with hints of \"woozy psychedelia\" and \"piledriving metal\". The album was a commercial success, debuting at number one in the UK, while Arctic Monkeys headlined Glastonbury Festival in the summer of 2007. Also that year, Turner began to collaborate with other artists. He worked with rapper Dizzee Rascal on the Arctic Monkeys B-side \"Temptation\", a version of which also featured on Rascal's album Maths and English. He co-wrote three songs on Reverend and The Makers' debut album The State Of Things, after briefly sharing a Sheffield flat with the frontman Jon McClure. Another Sheffield singer, Richard Hawley, featured on the Arctic Monkeys' B-side \"Bad Woman\" and performed with the band at the Manchester Apollo, as part of a concert film directed by Richard Ayoade. Turner also announced plans to form a side-project band, The Last Shadow Puppets, with Ford and Miles Kane, whom he had befriended during a tour in mid-2005."]}, {"page": "Ninet Tayeb", "response": ["Ninet has released four successful albums in Israel (one of them in English), and has twice won Israel's Favorite Act at the MTV Europe Music Awards.
