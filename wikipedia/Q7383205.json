His personal contentment (at the top of his profession, and, as John Banville finds, \"an unashamed beneficiary of the fruits of late capitalism\") provides a hopeful side to the book, instead of the unhappiness in contemporary fiction. McEwan's previous novels highlighted the fragility of modern fulfilled life, seemingly minor incidents dramatically upsetting existence. Critic Michiko Kakutani notes that Saturday returns to a theme explored in Atonement, which plotted the disruption of a lie to a middle-class family, and in The Child in Time, where a small child is kidnapped during a day's shopping.Kakutani, Michiko. \"Books of the Times; A Hero With 9/11 Peripheral Vision\". The New York Times. (18 March 2005.) Retrieved on 4 February 2010. This theme is continued in Saturday, a \"tautly wound tour-de-force\" set in a world where terrorism, war and politics make the news headlines, but the protagonist has to live out this life until he \"collides with another fate\". Ruth Scurr notes that in Saturday the perspective on the delicate state of humanity that Perowne derives from his medical knowledge is presented in contrast to, and from Perowne's perspective superior to, that of novelists.  ", "Ruth Scurr reviewed the book in The Times, calling McEwan \"[maybe] the best novelist in Britain and is certainly operating at the height of his formidable powers\". She praised his examination of happiness in the 21st century, particularly from the point of view of a surgeon: \"doctors see real lives fall to pieces in their consulting rooms or on their operating tables, day in, day out. Often they mend what is broken, and open the door to happiness again.\" Christopher Hitchens said the \"sober yet scintillating pages of Saturday\" confirmed the maturation of McEwan and displayed both his soft, humane, side and his hard, intellectual, scientific, side."]}, {"page": "2006 in literature", "response": ["*Ruth Scurr \u2013 Fatal Purity: Robespierre and the French Revolution"]}, {"page": "The Mays", "response": ["* Ruth Scurr and Chris Taylor (1995)"]}, {"page": "John Casey (academic)", "response": ["John Casey was educated by the Irish Christian Brothers at St. Brendan's College, Bristol and subsequently at King's College, Cambridge, where he received a First in both parts of the English Tripos.'Cambridge University Tripos Results: English', Times, 21 June 1958; 'Cambridge Tripos Results', Times, 23 June 1960.
