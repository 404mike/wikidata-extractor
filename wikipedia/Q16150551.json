Female bonobos often engage in the practice of genital-genital (GG) rubbing, which is the non-human form of tribadism that human females engage in. Ethologist Jonathan Balcombe stated that female bonobos rub their clitorises together rapidly for ten to twenty seconds, and this behavior, \"which may be repeated in rapid succession, is usually accompanied by grinding, shrieking, and clitoral engorgement\"; he added that, on average, they engage in this practice \"about once every two hours\", and as bonobos sometimes mate face-to-face, \"evolutionary biologist Marlene Zuk has suggested that the position of the clitoris in bonobos and some other primates has evolved to maximize stimulation during sexual intercourse\"."]}, {"page": "Bonobo", "response": ["Bonobo clitorises are larger and more externalized than in most mammals; while the weight of a young adolescent female bonobo \"is maybe half\" that of a human teenager, she has a clitoris that is \"three times bigger than the human equivalent, and visible enough to waggle unmistakably as she walks\". In scientific literature, the female\u2013female behavior of bonobos pressing genitals together is often referred to as genito-genital (GG) rubbing, which is the non-human analogue of tribadism, engaged in by some human females. This sexual activity happens within the immediate female bonobo community and sometimes outside of it. Ethologist Jonathan Balcombe stated that female bonobos rub their clitorises together rapidly for ten to twenty seconds, and this behavior, \"which may be repeated in rapid succession, is usually accompanied by grinding, shrieking, and clitoral engorgement\"; he added that it is estimated that they engage in this practice \"about once every two hours\" on average. As bonobos occasionally copulate face-to-face, \"evolutionary biologist Marlene Zuk has suggested that the position of the clitoris in bonobos and some other primates has evolved to maximize stimulation during sexual intercourse\". The position of the clitoris may alternatively permit GG-rubbings, which has been hypothesized to function as a means for female bonobos to evaluate their intrasocial relationships."]}, {"page": "Tribadism", "response": ["In bonobos, the clitoris is larger and more externalized than in most mammals.

This is sometimes stated as \"animals mate only for reproduction\". This view is considered a misconception by some scholars. Jonathan Balcombe argues that the prevalence of non-reproductive sexual behaviour in certain species suggests that sexual stimulation is pleasurable. He also points to the presence of the clitoris in some female mammals, and evidence for female orgasm in primates. On the other hand, it is impossible to know the subjective feelings of animals, and the notion that non-human animals experience emotions similar to humans is a contentious subject."]}, {"page": "The Nautilus (magazine)", "response": ["* Jonathan Balcombe"]}]}}
