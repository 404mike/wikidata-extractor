Notable works of his include English translations of the The Tale of the Heike (\u5e73\u5bb6\u7269\u8a9e, Heike Monogatari) which won the 2012 Lois Roth Award, as well as The Tale of Genji (\u6e90\u6c0f\u7269\u8a9e, Genji Monogatari) which was awarded the Japan-US Friendship Commission Translation Prize in 2001. Tyler's first book of poetry was published in 2014, entitled A Great Valley Under the Stars, and his published collection of poetry, Under Currockbilly which recounts his life during the year 2014, suggests he has spent periods of his life in France, Japan, the United States, Australia, and elsewhere.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Tale of Genji", "response": ["The debate over how much of Genji was actually written by Murasaki Shikibu has gone on for centuries and is unlikely to ever be settled unless some major archival discovery is made. It is generally accepted that the tale was finished in its present form by 1021, when the author of the Sarashina Nikki wrote a diary entry about her joy at acquiring a complete copy of the tale. She writes that there are over 50 chapters and mentions a character introduced at the end of the work, so if other authors besides Murasaki Shikibu did work on the tale, the work was finished very near to the time of her writing. Murasaki Shikibu's own diary includes a reference to the tale, and indeed the application to herself of the name 'Murasaki' in an allusion to the main female character. That entry confirms that some if not all of the diary was available in 1008 when internal evidence suggests convincingly that the entry was written.The Diary of Lady Murasaki, ed. Richard Bowring, Penguin Classics 2005, p. 31, note 41. In his introduction to the text, Bowring discusses its dating which, in any case, is generally accepted by most authorities. Royall Tyler, in his edition of the Tale of Genji cited below, also draws attention to the entry in Murasaki Shikibu's diary: see the Penguin Books edition, 2003, Introduction, p. xvii", "Yosano Akiko, the first author to make a modern Japanese translation of Genji, believed that Murasaki Shikibu had only written chapters 1 to 33, and that chapters 35 to 54 were written by her daughter Daini no Sanmi. Other scholars have also doubted the authorship of chapters 42 to 54 (particularly 44, which contains rare examples of continuity mistakes). According to Royall Tyler's introduction to his English translation of the work, recent computer analysis has turned up \"statistically significant\" discrepancies of style between chapters 45\u201354 and the rest, and also among the early chapters.", "The English translations here are taken from the Arthur Waley, the Edward Seidensticker, the Royall Tyler,  and the Dennis Washburn translations.  It is not known for certain when the chapters acquired their titles.  Early mentions of the Tale refer to chapter numbers, or contain alternate titles for some of the chapters.  This may suggest that the titles were added later. The titles are largely derived from poetry that is quoted within the text, or allusions to various characters.", "The first partial translation of Genji Monogatari into English was by Suematsu Kench\u014d, published in 1882. Arthur Waley published a six-volume translation of all but one chapter, with the first volume published in 1925 and the last in 1933.  In 1976, Edward Seidensticker published the first complete translation into English, made using a self-consciously \"stricter\" approach with regards to content if not form. The English translation published in 2001 by Royall Tyler aims at fidelity in content and form to the original text. The most recently written (\"Genji and the Luck of the Sea\") dates from 2007. Its initial version has been extensively revised, retitled, and updated for this publication.Tyler, Royall (2009). The Disaster of the Third Princess: Essays on the tale of Genji.

Atsumori is also, like many of his Taira brethren, portrayed as a courtier and poet, not truly prepared for battle. He is said to have carried a flute into battle, evidence of his peaceful, courtly nature as well as his youth and na\u00efvet\u00e9. Kumagai also notes that none of his fellow Genji (Minamoto) warriors were cultivated to a point where they would ride into battle with a flute.
