He was a dynamic teacher and administrator, transforming the status of the institutions in which he worked. He was equally passionate about anatomy, enthusiastically seeking out and dissecting the largest and finest specimens, including whales, and troubling his colleagues with his single-minded quest for money and space for his collection. His collection was donated to Surgeon's Hall in Edinburgh.Among scientists, he is perhaps best known for his work on the ligament which bears his name. His work on the rare and vestigial ligament of Struthers came to the attention of Charles Darwin, who used it in his Descent of Man to help argue the case that man and other mammals shared a common ancestor ; or \"community of descent,\" as Darwin expressed it.\nAmong the public, Struthers was famous for his dissection of the \"Tay Whale\", a humpback whale that appeared in the Firth of Tay, was hunted and then dragged ashore to be exhibited across Britain. Struthers took every opportunity he could to dissect it and recover its bones, and eventually wrote a monograph on it.\nIn the medical profession, he was known for transforming the teaching of anatomy, for the papers and books that he wrote, as well as for his efficient work in his medical school, for which he was successively awarded medicine's highest honours, including membership of the General Medical Council, fellowship of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, the presidency of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, and finally a knighthood.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Anatomy", "response": ["The teaching of anatomy in Britain was transformed by Sir John Struthers, Regius Professor of Anatomy at the University of Aberdeen from 1863 to 1889. He was responsible for setting up the system of three years of \"pre-clinical\" academic teaching in the sciences underlying medicine, including especially anatomy. This system lasted until the reform of medical training in 1993 and 2003. As well as teaching, he collected many vertebrate skeletons for his museum of comparative anatomy, published over 70 research papers, and became famous for his public dissection of the Tay Whale. From 1822 the Royal College of Surgeons regulated the teaching of anatomy in medical schools. Medical museums provided examples in comparative anatomy, and were often used in teaching. Ignaz Semmelweis investigated puerperal fever and he discovered how it was caused. He noticed that the frequently fatal fever occurred more often in mothers examined by medical students than by midwives. The students went from the dissecting room to the hospital ward and examined women in childbirth. Semmelweis showed that when the trainees washed their hands in chlorinated lime before each clinical examination, the incidence of puerperal fever among the mothers could be reduced dramatically."]}, {"page": "List of biologists", "response": ["*John Struthers (1823\u20131899), Scottish anatomist known for the ligament of Struthers, a rare character in humans"]}, {"page": "Fife", "response": ["* Sir John Struthers, first Regius Professor of Anatomy at the University of Aberdeen"]}, {"page": "Dunfermline", "response": ["Sir John Struthers who dissected and drew the Tay Whale, was an anatomist and professor of medicine.

King's parents both died from phthisis (tuberculosis), the father in November 1845 aged thirty six and the mother in 1850 at the age of forty.

Although a good student, his health was poor and he was forced to leave in 1854. The family was associated with the Free church but King later favoured the Anglican church. For a while he worked in his uncle's press business but he continued to take a greater interest in natural history, an interest that had developed in his youth. He started putting together a collection in his work place, something the printer uncle despised.

As was common he the time he did not graduate. Moving to Edinburgh he attended the anatomy lectures of John Struthers at the Edinburgh Extramural School of Medicine which convinced him to study medicine.  As a medical student at the University of Edinburgh his teachers included what he later described as 'a galaxy of genius and talent\u2019. These included James Syme (surgery), John Hughes Bennett (physiology), James Young Simpson (Midwifery) and John Goodsir (Anatomy). Pettigrew flourished under the tutelage of John Goodsir with whom he developed a programme of research into the morphology of the human heart. During this project he prepared 112 dissections of cardiac muscle recording these by meticulous drawings and photographs. For this work he was awarded the anatomy gold medal.  The London physiologist William Sharpey and  Allen Thomson were so impressed with this work that they invited Pettigrew to deliver the Croonian Lectures of the Royal Society and the Royal College of Physicians of London in 1860.This was a rare distinction for an undergraduate. In these lectures, Pettigrew advanced a remarkable discussion of the anatomical arrangement of the musculature of the heart. In 1861 he graduated MD from Edinburgh with the Gold Medal for his year and became House Surgeon to James Syme at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. From an early age, Pettigrew demonstrated a remarkable flair for morphological analysis and an analytical grasp of natural history."]}, {"page": "The Famous Tay Whale", "response": ["The Tay Whale came to public prominence when it was subject to a public dissection by the anatomist Sir John Struthers and taken on a tour of Scotland and England by a showman, John Woods.

It courses from the supracondylar process of the humerus (also known as avian spur) to the medial humeral epicondyle. It is not a constant ligament, and can be acquired or congenital.  The structure was highlighted by John Struthers, who discussed the feature's evolutionary significance with Charles Darwin. Struthers originally reported that the ligament usually arose at a position 3.2 to 6.4\u00a0cm from the medial condyle, being 1.2 to 1.9\u00a0cm in length, and nearer to the anterior than the medial border of the humerus.", "The structure was originally depicted by Tiedemann,\u2018\u2018Tabulae Arteriarum\u2019\u2019, Plate 15, Fig 3, 1822 and later by Knox in the early 19th century,Knox. Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal, 1841, p.125 but  John Struthers was the first to draw attention to this structure in 1848 as a \"peculiar process\" that bore curious resemblance to anatomy that he had seen in cats.  This observation was one of many that Struthers made in subsequent investigations of vestigial and rudimentary structures, and in sharing these observations with his contemporary, Charles Darwin, provided significant evidence for the theories of evolution. Charles Darwin took the ligament to mean that humans and other mammals had a common ancestor, and used Struthers' work as evidence in Chapter 1 of his Descent of Man (1871).  Struthers went on to create a museum of Comparative Anatomy filled with zoological specimens to illustrate Darwin's theory of common descent."]}, {"page": "Irvine Masson", "response": ["He was the paternal grandson of David Masson and Emily Rosaline Orme and maternal grandson of John Struthers.
