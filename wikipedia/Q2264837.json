Professors in Ageing, Popular Culture and Contemporary Feminism (2014) commented that \"her status as a cultural icon is acknowledged in all press accounts\". Frenchman scholar Georges Claude Guilbert proposed her as a postmodern myth while an author from El Cultural wrote in 2015 that she \"surpasses the laws of physics, time, popular culture, and even metaphysics\". A subject of diverse listicles during her career, scholars such as Frances Negr\u00f3n-Muntaner, Robert M. Grant or George Claude Guilbert have seen and commented how Madonna was labeled during her career as the \"most famous female (artist)/woman\" on the planet, while writer Matt Cain expressed she is \"one of the most famous women ever to have lived\". Both Madonna's references and impact are found \u2014but not limited to\u2014 in the arts, literature, cinema, the music and even science.", "Critical theorist, Stuart Sim found that she \"attained the status of cultural icon, she is however, an extremely problematic one\" concluding that \"makes her exceedingly difficult to categorize; depending on one's point of view\". Similarly, Australian magazine The Music commented that \"Madonna is many things\", noting that as \"she is the Queen of Pop\", a \"revolutionary\", \"feminist boss\" or \"serial reinventor\", for some Madonna is a \"problematic fave\", \"culture vulture\", \"a controversialist\" and \"has been successively cancelled\". Audra Gaugler from Lehigh University also explained that \"there exists a large band of critics that at first praised her, but then became disillusioned with her as she became more and more controversial\". Glenn Ward wrote in his book Discover Postmodernism: Flash (2011) that \"for some critics the Madonna phenomenon represents the worst excesses of commercial exploitation\". Also, associate professor Diane Pecknold wrote in American Icons (2006) that Madonna \"was not only an omnipresent figure but a polarizing one\"."]}]}}
