Toti reacted to this article by writing a rebuttal which was published in The Washington Times entitled What Does Brookings Know About Defense? The article advanced the idea that because of the need of American armed forces to cross two vast oceans surrounding the United States to bring the fight to the enemy, any comparison of what the United States spends relative to spending by other nations that do not have to cross those oceans, is specious. Toti's article was countered by a strong rebuttal on March 19, 1996, also in The Washington Times, written Michael O'Hanlon and Korb, then both senior fellows at Brookings."]}]}}
