He was born at Frome, Somerset and died at Rye, East Sussex.\nCompton was the 11th child (of 17) of the Rev Thomas Hoyle Compton and his wife, the former Eliza Sarah Winzar, and was educated at Lancing College and Keble College, Oxford. As a cricketer, Compton was a lower-order batsman and a wicketkeeper. He played for Somerset in one match in 1894 and two more in 1895, making little impression. At Oxford University, he won a blue for soccer in 1895-96, but had only two first-class cricket matches for the university team, in one of which he scored an unbeaten 22, his highest first-class score. From 1897 to 1902 he played Minor Counties cricket for Oxfordshire, and from 1903 to 1908 he played minor matches for MCC. He returned, 11 years after his previous first-class game, for a single final match for Somerset in 1907, against Sussex at Hastings.Compton married Annie Maude May in 1900. She died in 1952.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Edward Compton (1894\u20131907) 4 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Edward Compton", "response": ["Edward Compton may refer to:", "*Edward Compton (actor) (1854\u20131918), English actor and theatre manager", "*Edward Compton (cricketer) (1872\u20131940), English cricketer"]}]}}
