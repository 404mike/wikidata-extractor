By 1821 Archibald Constable, who published Sir Walter Scott, took advantage of his popularity to increase the price of a single volume to ten shillings and sixpence (half a guinea), or a guinea and a half (31 shillings and sixpence) for all three volumes.  This price was equivalent to half the weekly income of a modest, middle-class household. This cost was enough to deter even comparatively well-off members of the public from buying them. Instead, they were borrowed from commercial circulating libraries, the most well known being owned by Charles Edward Mudie. Mudie was able to buy novels for stock for less than half the retail price \u2013 five shillings per volume. He charged his subscribers one guinea (21 shillings) a year for the right to borrow one volume at a time, or two guineas a year (\u00a32 2s.) to borrow four volumes at a time. A subscriber who wanted to be sure of reading the whole book without waiting for another subscriber to return the next volume had to take out the higher subscription."]}, {"page": "Charles Mudie", "response": ["#REDIRECT Charles Edward Mudie"]}, {"page": "Mudie's", "response": ["#REDIRECT Charles Edward Mudie"]}, {"page": "Mudie's Select Library", "response": ["#REDIRECT Charles Edward Mudie"]}, {"page": "Mudie", "response": ["* Charles Edward Mudie (1818\u20131890), English publisher"]}, {"page": "Henry Stacy Marks", "response": ["Marks' father emigrated to Australia leaving Henry to support his mother, three brothers and from October 1856, his wife, Helen Drysdale (1829-1892).
