The show was originally 30 minutes longer than the Wogan incarnation and began at 07:00\u00a0am, but following the departure of Sarah Kennedy from early breakfast, the show was extended by another 30 minutes and began at 06:30\u00a0am. The show always ended with a handover to Ken Bruce at 09:30\u00a0am. While Evans replaced Wogan owing to his long-planned retirement, supporters of Kennedy alleged there was a deliberate intention to force her out so that Evans' show could be lengthened. His first three songs were The Beatles' \"All You Need Is Love\" and \"Got to Get You into My Life\"; and Frank Sinatra's \"Come Fly with Me\". His co-presenters included ex-BBC TV newsreader Moira Stuart, sports presenter Jonny Saunders (who was replaced in June 2011 by Vassos Alexander), and travel reporter Lynn Bowles. Features included The Gobsmackers (two songs selected by a listener that sound good played back-to-back)."]}, {"page": "List of Durham University people", "response": ["* Jonny Saunders (Collingwood) \u2013 BBC Radio 2 Sports Presenter"]}, {"page": "Saunders", "response": ["* Jonny Saunders, an English radio presenter and schoolteacher"]}, {"page": "Johnny Saunders", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jonny Saunders"]}, {"page": "Chris Evans Drivetime", "response": ["Chris was joined throughout the programme by three colleagues.
