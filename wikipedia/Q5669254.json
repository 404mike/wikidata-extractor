Left-back Harry Greenhalgh was the only change from the 1923 line-up. Each team played the formation typical of the era: two full-backs, three half-backs and five forwards.  Bolton had the better of the opening exchanges; the Times correspondent wrote: \"In the first five minutes Bolton Wanderers were so superior to their opponents that they might have been giving an exhibition for the cinema against schoolboys\". Manchester City then gradually asserted themselves and had the first clear chance. Frank Roberts took a right-footed shot, but hit the ball straight at Bolton goalkeeper Dick Pym. Overall, the defences enjoyed the better of the play in the first half. Bolton's Joe Smith was instrumental in much of his team's attacking play, both he and left-winger Ted Vizard receiving praise for their play.", "| ||Full-back || Harry Greenhalgh"]}, {"page": "Greenhalgh", "response": ["*Harry Greenhalgh (1900\u20131982), English footballer"]}]}}
