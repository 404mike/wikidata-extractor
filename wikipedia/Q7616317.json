It is not known what she did there, as she never spoke about it. In the 1989 conversation referred to above she merely confirmed that she had worked at the High Commission and that it was the British High Commissioner who handed her the award in 1920. She must have declined an invitation to travel to Buckingham Palace for the ceremony. That urge to keep a low public profile would prove a blessing to her two decades later."]}]}}
