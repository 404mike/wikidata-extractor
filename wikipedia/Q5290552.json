He soon became a one-day cricket specialist, after some expert bowling coaching and practice. The arrival of Craig Spearman in the side did nothing to hoist Hewson's confidence or, more importantly, appearances for Gloucestershire.\nHewson joined Derbyshire in 2002. In his debut performance for Derbyshire, he scored a duck in his first innings, followed by a century in his second, where he finished not out with 102. His first-class career, however, was very much undermined by a heart condition from which he regularly suffered, which landed him in hospital after a National League match in July 2003. Having played only two matches during calendar year 2004, he was released by his team. He was a right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium-pace bowler", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hewson", "response": ["* Dominic Hewson (born 1974), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Jason Lewry", "response": ["Lewry returned to cricket in 1998, and in a match against Gloucestershire, he took a hat-trick with deliveries in two innings. He took the wicket of Mike Smith to end Gloucestershire's first innings, and then with the first two balls of their second innings, he took the wickets of Nick Trainor and Dominic Hewson, to complete his hat-trick. He took 60 Championship wickets in the season, and in 1998/99 was selected for an England A tour of South Africa and Zimbabwe. Lewry played two matches, against Zimbabwe Cricket Union President's XI, and Zimbabwe A, but was forced to return to England early, due to a troublesome shoulder that required surgery. On the tour, Lewry had also suffered knee problems and food poisoning. He never played for England teams again, and when fellow left-armer Ryan Sidebottom was chosen ahead of him for the England team in 2001, this signalled the end of his international career."]}, {"page": "Mark George (Australian cricketer)", "response": ["George represented the Kent Cricket Board in a single List A match against Derbyshire in the 2003 Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy.List A Matches played by Mark George  In his only List A match, he scored 7 runsList A Batting and Fielding For Each Team by Mark George and took a single wicket at a cost of 61 runs.List A Bowling For Each Team by Mark George  His only wicket was that of Dominic Hewson."]}, {"page": "List of Gloucestershire County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Dominic Hewson (1996\u20132001) : D.
