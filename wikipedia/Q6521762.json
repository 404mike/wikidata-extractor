FAW secretary Ted Robbins' side, playing on a Saturday when the English leagues had a full programme, had no choice but to play 10 players from either the lower divisions, Welsh League sides, or from the non-leagues. The Welsh featured just seven players from Football League sides, with only Keenor and Cardiff teammates Len Evans and Walter Robbins playing in the top two divisions. The rest of the side contained three players from Welsh league sides Cardiff Corinthians, Llanelli and Colwyn Bay and one player from non-league side Oswestry Town. The side featured nine debutants in the line-up, with Keenor and Cardiff teammate Len Evans being the only two with previous experience at international level. Wales had been forced into a similar situation eight months earlier, in February 1930, when Keenor had played in a severely weakened side that lost 7\u20130 to Ireland.

Their troubles continued as they were relegated to the Third Division South for the first time in their history soon after. In 1932, he nearly left the financially stricken club to join Hull City after a transfer offer was accepted. Cardiff planned to replace him with backup goalkeeper Len Evans, only for Evans to leave himself before the deal was completed. A board meeting was hastily arranged during which Farquharson agreed to remain with Cardiff, where he played for a further three years before retiring in 1935. In his book, The Who's Who of Cardiff City, Dean Hayes describes Farquharson as \"without doubt [...] the greatest goalkeeper in the history of the club.\" He played in 445 matches in the Football League, a club record which stood until 1985 when it was surpassed by Phil Dwyer.
