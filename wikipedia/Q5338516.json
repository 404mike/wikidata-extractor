A highly gifted actress with a striking stage presence, Coates initially found success in larger dramatic roles before transitioning into portraying mainly character parts in the 1950s. She began her career with Lilian Baylis's opera company at the Old Vic in 1924. She stayed with the company when it moved to the Sadler's Wells Theatre and remained with them up to 1946. Coates career was put on hold while the London stages were closed during World War II. There is no doubt that the war limited her career as it occurred during her prime singing years; though she was also said not to have been excessively ambitious. In 1947 Coates joined the Royal Opera, London where she remained until her retirement from the stage in 1967.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1983 in music", "response": ["*January 7 \u2013 Edith Coates, operatic mezzo-soprano, 74"]}, {"page": "English National Opera", "response": ["Lawrance Collingwood joined the company as resident conductor alongside Corri.
