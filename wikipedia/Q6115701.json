He played for Portsmouth as a centre forward during the interwar and post war period. He is best remembered for Portsmouth's Cup run in the 1933/34 season, scoring a hat-trick against Birmingham in front of a 66,000-strong crowd to take Portsmouth to the Final. He signed with Blackburn Rovers in 1938 where they lost the War Cup against West Ham with a 1\u20130 defeat.He later became the coach at Blackburn Rovers, where he remained for many years. He was the coach during the legendary FA cup final in 1960, when Dave Whelan broke his left shin, it was rumoured that Jack Weddle helped Whelan to receive his compensation money, which he then went on to build up his JJB empire with. Jack Weddle is remembered with fond memories, such as his legendary words to Whelan before that 1960 match, when Whelan was so nervous he inquired as to where his shin pads were, to which Jack Weddle replied, \"You've got 'em on, you daft bugger\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Whitburn, Tyne and Wear", "response": ["* Jack Weddle \u2013 footballer, striker for Portsmouth and Blackburn Rovers."]}, {"page": "1934 FA Cup Final", "response": ["Portsmouth started away to Manchester United, who at the time of the match were in the relegation zone of the Second Division.

After defeating Grimsby Town and Swansea Town 2\u20130 and 1\u20130 respectively, they faced Bolton Wanderers in the quarter-finals. Bolton had scored 12 goals in three FA Cup games thus far, however they could not get a goal against Portsmouth, who won emphatically, 3\u20130.

Portsmouth took an early lead, when a Jack Smith free kick was received by Rutherford, who set up the scoring chance for Jack Weddle. 15 minutes later Weddle scored again, from a Fred Worrall cross. After a flurry of chances Leicester got a goal back before half-time, but Portsmouth had the better of the second-half.
