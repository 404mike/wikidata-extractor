She wrote from a sociological, holistic, religious and feminine angle, translated works by Auguste Comte, and rarely for a woman writer at the time, earned enough to support herself. The young Princess Victoria enjoyed her work and invited her to her 1838 coronation. Martineau advised \"a focus on all [society's] aspects, including key political, religious, and social institutions\". She applied thorough analysis to women's status under men. The novelist Margaret Oliphant called her \"a born lecturer and politician... less distinctively affected by her sex than perhaps any other, male or female, of her generation.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Amos Bronson Alcott", "response": ["Alcott's ideas as an educator were controversial. Writer Harriet Martineau, for example, wrote dubiously that, \"the master presupposes his little pupils possessed of all truth; and that his business is to bring it out into expression\". Even so, his ideas helped to found one of the first adult education centers in America, and provided the foundation for future generations of liberal education. Many of Alcott's educational principles are still used in classrooms today, including \"teach by encouragement\", art education, music education, acting exercises, learning through experience, risk-taking in the classroom, tolerance in schools, physical education/recess, and early childhood education. The teachings of William Ellery Channing a few years earlier had also laid the groundwork for the work of most of the Concord Transcendentalists."]}, {"page": "Charlotte Bront\u00eb", "response": ["In view of the success of her novels, particularly Jane Eyre, Bront\u00eb was persuaded by her publisher to make occasional visits to London, where she revealed her true identity and began to move in more exalted social circles, becoming friends with Harriet Martineau and Elizabeth Gaskell, and acquainted with William Makepeace Thackeray and G.H. Lewes. She never left Haworth for more than a few weeks at a time, as she did not want to leave her ageing father.  Thackeray's daughter, writer Anne Isabella Thackeray Ritchie, recalled a visit to her father by Bront\u00eb:"]}, {"page": "Classical liberalism", "response": ["Despite the pragmatism of classical economists, their views were expressed in dogmatic terms by such popular writers as Jane Marcet and Harriet Martineau. The strongest defender of laissez-faire was The Economist founded by James Wilson in 1843. The Economist criticised Ricardo for his lack of support for free trade and expressed hostility to welfare, believing that the lower orders were responsible for their economic circumstances. The Economist took the position that regulation of factory hours was harmful to workers and also strongly opposed state support for education, health, the provision of water and granting of patents and copyrights."]}, {"page": "George Eliot", "response": ["In 1836 her mother died and Evans (then 16) returned home to act as housekeeper, but she continued correspondence with her tutor Maria Lewis. When she was 21, her brother Isaac married and took over the family home, so Evans and her father moved to Foleshill near Coventry. The closeness to Coventry society brought new influences, most notably those of Charles and Cara Bray. Charles Bray had become rich as a ribbon manufacturer and had used his wealth in the building of schools and in other philanthropic causes. Evans, who had been struggling with religious doubts for some time, became intimate friends with the radical, free-thinking Brays, whose \"Rosehill\" home was a haven for people who held and debated radical views. The people whom the young woman met at the Brays' house included Robert Owen, Herbert Spencer, Harriet Martineau, and Ralph Waldo Emerson. Through this society Evans was introduced to more liberal and agnostic theologies and to writers such as David Strauss and Ludwig Feuerbach, who cast doubt on the literal truth of Biblical texts. In fact, her first major literary work was an English translation of Strauss's Das Leben Jesu kritisch bearbeitet  as The Life of Jesus, Critically Examined (1846), which she completed after it had been left incomplete by Elizabeth \"Rufa\" Brabant, another member of the \"Rosehill Circle\"."]}, {"page": "June 12", "response": ["*1802 \u2013 Harriet Martineau, English sociologist and author (d. 1876)"]}, {"page": "Paul Dirac", "response": ["Heisenberg's view was tolerant. Pauli, raised as a Catholic, had kept silent after some initial remarks, but when finally he was asked for his opinion, said: \"Well, our friend Dirac has got a religion and its guiding principle is 'There is no God, and Paul Dirac is His prophet.  Everybody, including Dirac, burst into laughter., who says this was an old joke, pointing out a Punch footnote in the 1850s that \"There is no God, and Harriet Martineau is her prophet.\""]}, {"page": "Sexism", "response": ["Sociology has examined sexism as manifesting at both the individual and the institutional level. According to Richard Schaefer, sexism is perpetuated by all major social institutions. Sociologists describe parallels among other ideological systems of oppression such as racism, which also operates at both the individual and institutional level. Early female sociologists Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Ida B. Wells, and Harriet Martineau described systems of gender inequality, but did not use the term sexism, which was coined later. Sociologists who adopted the functionalist paradigm, e.g. Talcott Parsons, understood gender inequality as the natural outcome of a dimorphic model of gender."]}, {"page": "1876", "response": ["* June 27 \u2013 Harriet Martineau, British social theorist, writer (b. 1802)"]}, {"page": "1802", "response": ["* June 12 \u2013 Harriet Martineau, British social theorist, writer (d. 1876)"]}, {"page": "Abolitionism", "response": ["* Harriet Martineau"]}]}}
