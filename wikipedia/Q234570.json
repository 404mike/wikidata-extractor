She wrote from a sociological, holistic, religious and feminine angle, translated works by Auguste Comte, and rarely for a woman writer at the time, earned enough to support herself. The young Princess Victoria enjoyed reading her and invited her to her 1838 coronation. Martineau advised, \"One must focus on all [society's] aspects, including key political, religious, and social institutions.\" She believed in thorough analysis to understand women's status under men. The novelist Margaret Oliphant called her \"a born lecturer and politician... less distinctively affected by her sex than perhaps any other, male or female, of her generation.\"", "link_mentions": {}}}
