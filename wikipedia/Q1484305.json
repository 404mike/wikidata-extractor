Scott was a professor at the University of Liverpool and later at the University of Michigan.\nHis research deals with low-dimensional geometric topology, differential geometry, and geometric group theory. He has done research on the geometric topology of 3-dimensional manifolds, 3-dimensional hyperbolic geometry, minimal surface theory, hyperbolic groups, and Kleinian groups with their associated geometry, topology, and group theory.\nIn 1973 he proved what is now known as the Scott core theorem or the Scott compact core theorem. This states that every 3-manifold \n  \n    \n      \n        M\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle M}\n   with finitely generated fundamental group has a compact core \n  \n    \n      \n        N\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N}\n  , i.e., \n  \n    \n      \n        N\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N}\n   is a compact submanifold such that inclusion induces a homotopy equivalence between \n  \n    \n      \n        N\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N}\n   and \n  \n    \n      \n        M\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle M}\n  ; the submanifold \n  \n    \n      \n        N\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N}\n   is called a Scott compact core of the manifold \n  \n    \n      \n        M\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle M}\n  . He had previously proved that, given a fundamental group \n  \n    \n      \n        G\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle G}\n   of a 3-manifold, if \n  \n    \n      \n        G\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle G}\n   is finitely generated then \n  \n    \n      \n        G\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle G}\n   must be finitely presented.\nIn 1986 he was awarded the Senior Berwick Prize. in 2012 he was elected a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "3-manifold", "response": ["The Scott core theorem is a theorem about the finite presentability of fundamental groups of 3-manifolds due to G.
