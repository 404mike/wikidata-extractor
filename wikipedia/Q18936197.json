The Journal of American Folklore, Vol. 59, No. 234, December 1946, pp. 404\u2013412 The poem took two years to complete and was one of the few works from this period that he did not disown in his maturity. Oisin introduces what was to become one of his most important themes: the appeal of the life of contemplation over the appeal of the life of action. Following the work, Yeats never again attempted another long poem. His other early poems, which are meditations on the themes of love or mystical and esoteric subjects, include Poems (1895), The Secret Rose (1897), and The Wind Among the Reeds (1899). The covers of these volumes were illustrated by Yeats's friend Althea Gyles."]}, {"page": "The Dome (periodical)", "response": ["*Althea Gyles \u2013 illustrations, including \"Aided Cloinne Uisnigh\" (The Violent Death of the Children of Uisnigh), 1897"]}, {"page": "Giles (surname)", "response": ["* Althea Gyles (1867\u20131949), Irish poet"]}, {"page": "List of Irish women writers", "response": ["*Althea Gyles (1868\u20131949), poet, artist"]}, {"page": "List of Irish women artists", "response": ["*Althea Gyles (1868\u20131949), poet, painter, illustrator"]}, {"page": "Faith Compton Mackenzie", "response": ["Between 1901 and 1905 she was an actress, under the stage name \"Faith Reynolds\", in Sir Charles Hawtrey's company, appearing in London and New York, initially in his production of A Message from Mars.
