Stephen Roskill, the official historian of the Royal Navy's role in World War II, wrote in 1960 that although the Allies believed during the war that \"many of the ships in harbour had been sunk or damaged and\u00a0...\u00a0severe destruction had been done to the oil refinery and naval base\", Japanese records \"do not confirm that either their shipping or the shore facilities suffered at all heavily\". These records indicated that only a single small ship was sunk. Roskill judged that \"fires started on shore\" led the Allied aircrew to \"report too optimistically on the results of the raid\". The Australian naval official historian G. Hermon Gill reached an identical conclusion in 1968. He also noted that Admiral Guy Royle, the head of the Royal Australian Navy, told the Australian Advisory War Council on 23 May that Operation Transom had been of dubious value on military grounds as similar results could have been achieved by land-based aircraft without risking warships. More recently, a 1990 work by Edwyn Gray and a 2009 work by David Brown concurred with Roskill and judged that the raid had not been successful."]}, {"page": "Edwyn", "response": ["*Edwyn Gray, British author who specialises in naval writing"]}, {"page": "Ottomar Gern", "response": ["In 1872, Gern presented a 6-ton torpedo, powered by a compressed-air engine, but tests showed only modest results.
