Prior was one of the leading illustrators of late Victorian Britain, noted for his ability to quickly sketch scenes.  His pencil sketches were sent back to London where they were re-drawn by studio artists and engraved on wood-blocks for printing in the Saturday issues of the Illustrated London News. In addition to covering conflicts around the world, he also traveled on a number of Royal tours including accompanying the Prince of Wales to Canada in 1901.\nPrior was one of two major artists employed by the Illustrated London News, with the other being William Simpson (1823\u20131899).", "link_mentions": {}}}
