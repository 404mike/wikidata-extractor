This impression was heightened when Lethbridge joined Labor members and rebel United Australia Party members in August 1939 to pass a motion of no confidence in the Premier Bertram Stevens which brought down Stevens' government. Lethbridge's vote gave Stevens' opponents their 1-vote victory. However, Lethbridge generally voted with the conservative parties and after 1939 he was considered to be a conservative independent. He retained the seat with this designation until he joined the nascent Liberal Party in July 1946. The next month he resigned from parliament to contest the seat of Division of Riverina at the 1946 federal election as the Liberal candidate. He came third behind the Australian Labor Party's incumbent Joe Langtry and the Country Party's Hugh Roberton.
