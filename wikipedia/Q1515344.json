A nephew later claimed that his uncle developed a rear-wheel drive design using mid-mounted treadles connected by rods to a rear crank, similar to the transmission of a steam locomotive. Proponents associate him with the first recorded instance of a bicycling traffic offence, when a Glasgow newspaper reported in 1842 an accident in which an anonymous \"gentleman from Dumfries-shire... bestride a velocipede... of ingenious design\"  knocked over a pedestrian in the Gorbals and was fined five shillings. However, the evidence connecting this with Macmillan is weak, since it is unlikely that the artisan Macmillan would have been termed a gentleman, nor is the report clear on how many wheels the vehicle had.  The evidence is unclear, and may have been faked by his son."]}, {"page": "Kirkpatrick MacMillan", "response": ["#REDIRECT Kirkpatrick Macmillan "]}, {"page": "Keir, Dumfries and Galloway", "response": ["The village was the birthplace of Kirkpatrick Macmillan, the inventor of the bicycle.
