The Papuans, south-east Halmaherans and east Ceramese sided with the rebellious Prince Nuku. The British sponsored Nuku as part of their campaign against the Dutch in the Moluccas.

Each datu considered himself as the most outstanding and powerful chieftain of the place and yet he had no more loyal subjects than his relatives and slaves. According to Thomas Forrest in 1780 Tukuran is a place where Iranuns lived in, built and repaired prahus. There were several services conducted by Spaniards in the isthmus of Tukuran because of it being the strategic place for a Spanish stronghold and to shorten communication in the north of Pangil Bay to south of Illana Bay, as well. On March 12, 1890, a fortified station named after the member of the royal family fort Alfonso XII locally known as fort Militar was built to stop the Moro from their slave-raiding activities against the Subanu people to Christians, and to facilitate their pacification on Mindanao campaign of colonization in general.

Dutch observers found the Bacan elite to be stout and self-assured in spite of the shrunken state of the sultanate, as they tried to uphold obsolete claims to parts of Ceram and Papua. The low population density, aggravated by epidemics, and the abundance of sago and fish made the population self-sufficient in terms of foodstuff, and the Dutch complained about the perceived inertia of the locals.Fran\u00e7ois Valentijn (1724), p. 116. Piracy was a big problem for the vulnerable population far into the 19th century. In 1774 the ruler Muhammad Sahadin (1741-1779) entertained friendly contacts with the British sea captain Thomas Forrest and also with the independent Sultan of Maguindanao. The suspicious Dutch therefore deposed him in 1779. The next two sultans were likewise exiled.W.P. Coolhaas (1923), p. 487. However, by now a rebel movement gained momentum in Maluku and Papua in the form of the Tidorese prince Nuku who persistently fought the Dutch with varying success.Muridan Widjojo (2009) The revolt of Prince Nuku: Cross-cultural alliance-making in Maluku, c. 1780-1810.

His father encountered internal opposition towards the end of his reign and died in August 1760. Tuanku Raja was proclaimed sultan under the name Alauddin Mahmud Syah. However, not all the regions heeded his claim. People from the XXII Mukims (one of the three regions or sagis of Aceh) held the prestigious Baiturrahman Grand Mosque in the capital and opposed the new sultan. They were eventually driven out by force. It was only in December 1760 that all the three sagis agreed to acknowledge Alauddin Mahmud Syah. The most influential person at the court was Mantri Makota Raja, a scion of the sultan's family of Siak Sri Indrapura who handled affairs on behalf of the young ruler.Djajadiningrat (1911), pp. 204-5. According to the account of the British navigator Thomas Forrest the sultan's relationship with the orang kayas (grandees) was poor during his first years. The sultan tried to control trade and circumcise the powers of the orang kaya.Lee (1995), p. 24. This had worked during the heyday of the sultanate in the seventeenth century, but at this time it created internal instability. On the other hand he had ambitions to expand the influence of Aceh along the west coast which had once belonged to the sultanate. Events in the mid-eighteenth century also gave an upswing to Aceh's economic role: The British were established in the Sumatran ports Natal and Tapanuli in 1751 and 1756 in order to support the pepper trade of Bengkulu. The French also sought good relations with Aceh. The period therefore saw an increasing number of European ships and traders visiting the coast of Aceh. The ships often purchased pepper and other local products in local ports rather than via the capital Kutaraja.Lee (1995), p. 26.", "Alauddin Mahmud Syah remained undisturbed in his governance for some years. The British negotiated about trading conditions in 1767, 1771 and 1772-73, and found the sultan to be a weak and capricious type. Meanwhile the Acehnese panglima laut (sea commander) continued to expand the influence of the sultanate on the northern west coast. Some port towns were blockaded and the Dutch garrison in Barus was attacked in 1771.Lee (1995), pp. 37-8. However, the inner cohesion of the state was once again declining. When Thomas Forrest returned to Aceh in 1772 he found an agitated situation. As he reported, discontent groups of people sometimes appeared threateningly outside the palace compound in the night. At this time the palace was guarded by a corps of sepoys under an Indian from Cuddalore, which had been provided by the British in Madras. In April 1773 the XXII Mukims and XXV Mukims rose against him.Zainuddin (1961), p. 414. In his stead an official called Raja Udahna Lela was placed on the throne under the name Sultan Sulaiman Syah. However, he only lasted for two months before Alauddin Mahmud Syah returned with his adherents and expelled the usurper. After this he remained in power until his death in June 1781. There were suspicions that he may have been poisoned.Lee (1995), p. 90. The sultan left two sons, Tuanku Muhammad and Tuanku Cut, of which the former succeeded him as Alauddin Muhammad Syah.Djajadiningrat (1911), pp. 205-6."]}, {"page": "Penjajap", "response": ["The original name for the ships among the natives of the Maluku Islands, eastern Sabah, western Mindanao, and the Sulu Archipelago is pangayaw or mangayaw (literally meaning \"raider\").
