Between 1863 and 1872 Viollet-le-Duc published his Entretiens sur l'architecture, a set of daring designs for buildings that combined iron and masonry. Though these projects were never realised, they influenced several generations of designers and architects, notably Antoni Gaud\u00ed in Spain and, in England, Benjamin Bucknall, Viollet's foremost English follower and translator, whose masterpiece was Woodchester Mansion. The flexibility and strength of cast-iron freed neo-Gothic designers to create new structural Gothic forms impossible in stone, as in Calvert Vaux's cast-iron Gothic bridge in Central Park, New York dating from the 1860. Vaux enlisted openwork forms derived from Gothic blind-arcading and window tracery to express the spring and support of the arching bridge, in flexing forms that presage Art Nouveau."]}, {"page": "1858 in architecture", "response": ["* Construction of Woodchester Mansion (Spring Park) in Gloucestershire, England, designed by Benjamin Bucknall, is begun; work is abandoned in the 1870s."]}, {"page": "Fairford", "response": ["Fairford has a 19th-century Catholic church of St Thomas of Canterbury.
