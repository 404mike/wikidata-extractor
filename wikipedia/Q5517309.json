He was educated at Glasgow University, and in 1859 was called to the bar at Middle Temple. In 1883 he was appointed a Queen's Counsel.\nBruce first stood for the Conservative Party at Gateshead in 1880 but was defeated; he failed again in 1883 at Newcastle, 1885 at Tyneside and 1886 at Barrow. He was finally returned to Parliament for Finsbury (Holborn Division) in 1888. In the 1892 election he was again returned for the Holborn division, but before Parliament sat he was appointed a Judge and had to resign his seat. He sat as a Judge until he retired in 1904. He was knighted in 1892 and in 1904 was appointed a Privy Councillor.\nHe specialised in shipping law. He was co-author with R G Williams of the textbook Admiralty Practice. Bruce died at his home near Bromley, Kent, aged 77.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury", "response": ["Salisbury caused controversy in 1888 after Gainsford Bruce had won the Holborn by-election for the Unionists, beating the Liberal Lord Compton. Bruce had won the seat with a smaller majority than Francis Duncan had for the Unionists in 1885. Salisbury explained this by saying in a speech in Edinburgh on 30 November: \"But then Colonel Duncan was opposed to a black man, and, however great the progress of mankind has been, and however far we have advanced in overcoming prejudices, I doubt if we have yet got to the point where a British constituency will elect a black man to represent them....
