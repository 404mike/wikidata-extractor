He made his debut when starting a 1\u20131 away draw with Lincoln City on 8 August 2015, Cheltenham's first match of 2015\u201316, and established himself at centre-back, forming a partnership with Aaron Downes. Parslow scored his first goal for Cheltenham on 31 August 2015, with a volley in the 59th minute of a 2\u20131 home victory over Wrexham. He stood in as Cheltenham's vice-captain after a season-ending injury to the captain Downes in January 2016,. after which he was partnered at centre-back with a number of players, including Cameron Burgess and Asa Hall. According to Oli Fell of the Gloucestershire Echo, it was after Downes' injury that Parslow \"really came into his own and stepped up\", and surmised that Parslow was \"perhaps the most crucial component of the side all season\". He finished 2015\u201316 with 50 appearances and two goals, and appeared in nearly every minute of Cheltenham's 46 league matches. Cheltenham won promotion back into League Two at the first attempt, winning the National League title with 101 points. Parslow was named the Cheltenham Players' Player of the Year, and was included in the National League Team of the Year. He signed a new contract with the club in May 2016."]}, {"page": "List of sportspeople who competed for more than one nation", "response": ["|Cameron Burgess"]}, {"page": "Cameron (given name)", "response": ["*Cameron Burgess (born 1995), Australian footballer"]}, {"page": "List of foreign EFL Championship players", "response": ["*Cameron Burgess \u2013 Fulham 2014\u201315"]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 Fulham F.C. season", "response": ["Magath pleaded before the match against Wolverhampton Wanderers for the fans to be patient with his young team \u2013 he made five changes to the side beaten by Millwall and started with six players aged 21 or younger. Wolves tore into Fulham from the off, with Dave Edwards flashing an early shot across goal and wide and Jesse Joronen having to charge out of his goal to save at the feet of Rajiv van la Parra. But on 15 minutes, Scott Golbourne's low corner was dummied by Edwards and allowed to run all the way to Bakary Sako, who drilled it into the bottom corner, with Mark Fotheringham wandering off the post which he was marking. Fulham tried to respond and Kostas Stafylidis fired narrowly over and then put in a dangerous cross which Tim Hoogland could not get a clean header on. But they almost found themselves two down before the interval when Wolves skipper Danny Batth got his head to Sako's free-kick only to nod the ball inches wide. Magath's response was to throw on another youngster, Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, and the 18-year-old almost made an instant impact with a low shot which Carl Ikeme tipped around his post. But with Ross McCormack again isolated up front - the \u00a311,000,000 striker resorted to coming back and collecting the ball from his centre-halves during the second half - Fulham rarely threatened an equaliser. The Scot's one sight of goal arrived just before the hour mark and his drive from the edge of the area was always rising as it cleared Ikeme's crossbar. Instead it was Wolves who always looked like adding to their tally, with Matt Doherty and Batth both missing the target with close-range headers before Sako blew their best chance in stoppage time, hitting the post with a penalty after Cameron Burgess tripped Nouha Dicko. Throughout the second half and after the full-time whistle, \"Felix out\" could be heard amongst the Fulham fans, and Magath did not acknowledge the fans when walking off, as Fulham slipped into the bottom three.", "|  Cameron Burgess"]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 Ross County F.C. season", "response": ["| Cameron Burgess"]}, {"page": "2015\u201316 Fulham F.C. season", "response": ["|  Cameron Burgess"]}, {"page": "2016\u201317 Fulham F.C. season", "response": ["|  Cameron Burgess ", "|  Cameron Burgess"]}]}}
