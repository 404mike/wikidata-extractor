Many Puritans believed the Church of England should follow the example of Reformed churches in other parts of Europe and adopt presbyterian polity, under which government by bishops would be replaced with government by elders. However, all attempts to enact further reforms through Parliament were blocked by the Queen. Despite such setbacks, Puritan leaders such as John Field and Thomas Cartwright continued to promote presbyterianism through the formation of unofficial clerical conferences that allowed Puritan clergymen to organise and network. This covert Puritan network was discovered and dismantled during the Marprelate controversy of the 1580s. For the remainder of Elizabeth's reign, Puritans ceased to agitate for further reform."]}, {"page": "1603", "response": ["* December 27 \u2013 Thomas Cartwright, English Puritan churchman (b. 1535)"]}, {"page": "John Whitgift", "response": ["Whitgift's theological views were controversial.

In a pulpit controversy with Thomas Cartwright regarding the constitutions and customs of the Church of England, his oratorical effectiveness proved inferior, but was able to exercise arbitrary authority: together with other heads of the university, he deprived Cartwright of his professorship, and in September 1571 Whitgift exercised his prerogative as master of Trinity to deprive him of his fellowship. In June of the same year Whitgift was nominated Dean of Lincoln. In the following year he published An Answere to a Certain Libel entitled an Admonition to the Parliament, which led to further controversy between the two churchmen. On 24 March 1577, Whitgift was appointed Bishop of Worcester, and during the absence of Sir Henry Sidney in Ireland in 1577 he acted as vice-president of Wales.", "He drew up articles aimed at nonconforming ministers, and obtained increased powers for the Court of High Commission. In 1586, he became a privy councillor. His actions gave rise to the Martin Marprelate tracts, in which the bishops and clergy were strongly opposed. By his vigilance the printers of the tracts were discovered and punished, though the main writer Job Throkmorton evaded him. Whitgift had nine leading presbyterians including Thomas Cartwright arrested in 1589\u201390, and though their trial in the Star Chamber for sedition did not result in convictions they did agree to abandon their movement in return for freedom."]}, {"page": "John Stubbs", "response": ["Stubbs was brother-in-law of the noted Puritan divine Thomas Cartwright, who married his sister Alice.

Throughout her reign, the Queen successfully blocked attempts by Parliament and the bishops to introduce further change. The bishops were placed in the difficult position of enforcing conformity while supporting reform. This was particularly evident between 1565 and 1567 during the Vestments controversy over the refusal of some clergy to wear the clerical dress required by the Royal Injunctions. For many Protestants, clerical vestments symbolised a continued belief in a priestly order separate from the congregation, and could be interpreted by Catholics as affirmation of traditional doctrines. Bishop Jewel called the surplice a \"vestige of error\". In general, the bishops considered clerical dress adiaphora and tried to find compromise, but the Queen believed that the church\u2014and herself as Supreme Governor\u2014had authority to determine rites and ceremonies. In the end, Archbishop Parker issued a code of discipline for the clergy called the Advertisements, and the most popular and effective Protestant preachers were suspended for non-compliance.", "By 1572, the debate between Puritans and conformists had entered a new phase\u2014church government had replaced vestments as the major issue. While Parliament still met, Thomas Wilcox and John Field published An Admonition to the Parliament that condemned \"Popish abuses yet remaining in the English Church\" and episcopal polity. It called for the church to be organised according to presbyterian polity. In November, A Second Admonition to Parliament was published\u2014most likely authored by Thomas Cartwright or Christopher Goodman\u2014which presented a more detailed proposal for church reform along presbyterian lines. John Whitgift of Cambridge University, a leading advocate for conformity, published a reply in October 1572, and he and Cartwright subsequently entered into a pamphlet war. The Admonition Controversy was not a disagreement over soteriology\u2014both Cartwright and Whitgift believed in predestination and that human works played no role in salvation. Rather, the Admonition's authors believed that presbyterianism was the only biblical form of church government, whereas Whitgift argued that no single form of church government was commanded in the Bible. Under Field's leadership, the Classical Movement was active among Puritans within the Church of England throughout the 1570s and 1580s. Puritan clergy in this movement organised local presbyteries or classes, from which the movement took its name. Through the 1580s, Puritans were organised enough to conduct what were essentially covert national synods."]}, {"page": "William Laxton (Lord Mayor of London)", "response": ["*Nicholas Luddington, who married Avice Rowe, sister of Sir Thomas Rowe (Lord Mayor of London 1568\u201369, died 1570),See 'Machell of Hackney' and 'Rowe of Shacklewell', in J.G.

Dating in England as a movement from 1588, it is distinct from Continental and Scottish forms of Presbyterianism.

This was the practice in Gordon's day, however, most of the sixteenth and seventeenth century English theoreticians of Presbyterianism, such as Thomas Cartwright, John Paget, the Westminster Assembly of Divines and the London Provincial Assembly, envisaged a Presbyterian system composed of congregations, classes and synods.   Historically Presbyterians in England were subsumed into the United Reformed Church in 1972.

John Foxe and Thomas Norton presented a reform proposal initially drawn up under Edward VI to Parliament.  Elizabeth quickly dismissed this proposal, however, insisting on adherence to the 1559 religious settlement.  Meanwhile, at Cambridge, professor Thomas Cartwright, a long-time opponent of vestments, offered a series of lectures in 1570 on the Book of Acts in which he called for the abolition of episcopacy and the creation of a presbyterian system of church governance in England.", "Meanwhile, at Cambridge, Vice-Chancellor John Whitgift moved against Thomas Cartwright, depriving Cartwright of his professorship and his fellowship in 1571.", "The Admonition to Parliament set off a major controversy in England.  John Whitgift wrote an Answer denouncing the Admonition, which in turn led to Thomas Cartwright's Replye to An Answere Made of M. Doctor Whitgift Agaynste the Admonition to the Parliament (1573), a second Puritan classic.  Cartwright argued that a properly reformed church must contain the four orders of ministers identified by Calvin: teaching elders, ruling elders, deacons and theological professors.  Cartwright went on to denounce the subjection of any minister in the church to any other minister in the strongest possible terms.  In a Second Replye, Cartwright was even more forceful, arguing that any pre-eminence accorded to any minister in the church violated divine law.  Furthermore, he went on to assert that a presbyterian hierarchy of presbyteries and synods was required by divine law.", "The government moved against all three of these Puritan leaders: John Field and Thomas Wilcox were imprisoned for a year, while Thomas Cartwright fled to exile on the continent to avoid such a fate.  In the end, however, the number of clergymen who refused to subscribe to the bishops' requirements proved to be too large, and a number of qualified subscriptions were allowed.", "The reign of Edmund Grindal as Archbishop of Canterbury (1575\u20131583) was relatively tranquil compared with that of his predecessor. The major issue came in 1581, when Robert Browne and his congregation at Bury St Edmunds withdrew from communion in the Church of England, citing the Church of England's dumb (i.e. non-preaching) ministry, and the lack of proper church discipline.  Browne and his followers, known as the Brownists, were forced into exile in the Low Countries.  There, they were encouraged by Thomas Cartwright, who was now serving as minister to the Merchant Adventurers at Middelburg.  Cartwright, however, opposed separatism).  Like most Puritans, he advocated further reforms to the Church of England from within.", "John Whitgift had been a vocal opponent of Thomas Cartwright.  He believed that the matter of church governance was adiaphora, a \"matter indifferent\", and that the church should accommodate with the state in which the church was located.  The Church of England was located in a monarchy, so the church should adopt an episcopal style of government.", "At this point, John Field, Walter Travers, and Thomas Cartwright were all free and back in England and determined to draft a new order for the Church of England.  They drafted a Book of Discipline, which circulated in 1586, and which they hoped would be accepted by the 1586 Parliament.  Again, the Puritan effort failed in Parliament.", "One of the most important aspects of the Puritan movement was its insistence on having a preaching ministry throughout the country.  At the time of the Elizabethan Religious Settlement, less than 10 per cent of the 40,000 English parish clergy was licensed to preach.  (Since the time of the repression of the Lollards in the 14th century, it had been illegal for an ordained parish priest to preach to his congregation without first obtaining a licence from his bishop.)  Elizabeth herself had been no fan of preaching and preferred a church service focused on the Prayer Book liturgy.  However, many of Elizabeth's bishops did support the development of a preaching ministry and, aided by wealthy laymen, were able to dramatically expand the number of qualified preachers in the country.  For example, Sir Walter Mildmay founded Emmanuel College, Cambridge in 1584 to promote the training of preaching ministers.  The great Puritan preacher and scholar Laurence Chaderton was the principal of the college. He was close friends and associates of Thomas Cartwright, Richard Rogers, Richard Greenham, John Dod, and William Perkins, each of which had a major influence on the rise of English Puritanism.
