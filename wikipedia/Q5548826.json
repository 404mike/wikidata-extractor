The item, presented by journalist Geraint Vincent, claimed police had made little progress with their investigation, and questioned whether they were following correct procedural methods. A former murder squad detective told the report that \"certain routine inquiries\" such as looking for fresh evidence at the crime scene were not being carried out. ITN accused the police of attempting \"to censor what information we can broadcast\" while the constabulary filed a complaint with the Office of Communications, calling the broadcast \"unfair, na\u00efve and irresponsible reporting\". The police subsequently lifted the sanctions against ITN, but said that they would \"not hesitate to adopt similar tactics in the future.\" Legal action was also considered over a tweet revealing that Tabak had viewed internet pornography showing erotic asphyxiation and bondage. The contempt of court charges were dropped after the tweet was removed."]}, {"page": "On Assignment", "response": ["*Geraint Vincent \u2013 Land and Demolitions", "Moran hugs her children close as she gazes at the pile of rubble that used to be their home in the Middle East. Her husband Muhammad has his head bowed in humiliation. The soldiers came with their bulldozer during this morning and it took them one hour to destroy the house. Muhammad says his family have lived on this land in East Jerusalem for generations, and that the house was built by his grandfather. The Israeli authorities say the house did not have planning permission, and was therefore an \"illegal structure\". It is a familiar story in this part of the region, but there is something unique about Middle East Correspondent Geraint Vincent's report. Moran is an Israeli Jew who converted to Islam to marry her Arab husband. Now that their house has been demolished what does the future hold for the couple and their children? And as US Secretary of State John Kerry's timetable for peace talks comes to an end, how much has Israel's policy of construction and destruction done for what little faith in the process there was?", "Geraint Vincent reports on Bucharest's stray dog crisis and Robert Moore is in North Dakota finding out about unmanned drones.", "Geraint Vincent travels to the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.
