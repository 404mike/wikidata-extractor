He had the distinction of being the only person ever to beat Thomas Sayers while defending the English middleweight championship.   Langham first took the championship by defeating George Gutteridge on 23 November 1846.  Langham was considered a scientific boxer, and known for using sharp, well-timed blows, particularly with his left, though he was right handed.  He was a 1992 inductee into the International Boxing Hall of Fame and a mentor to the British boxers Tom King and Jem Mace.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Brompton Cemetery", "response": ["* Nat Langham \u2013 middleweight bare-knuckle boxing champion from 1843 to 1853"]}, {"page": "Jem Mace", "response": ["In the early 1850s, during his days as an exhibition boxer at Nat Langham's Rum Pum-pas boxing club at Cambrian Stores near what is now London's Charing Cross Road, Mace once boxed Archibald William Douglas (1818-1856), the 8th Marquess of Queensbury, known as Viscount Drumlanrig.  Douglas had served as a former member of the House of Commons and was the father of John Douglas, credited with helping to establish boxing's modern Marquess of Queensberry Rules.  During the same period and earlier, Mace completed what might be considered an apprenticeship in the boxing booth of former English middleweight champion Nat Langham, where he fought many talented amateurs, and a few men with the skills of professionals, touring and often performing at county fairs.  He would continue to supplement his income by performing exhibitions and giving sparring and training sessions for Langham's boxing club in London's Westminster through the early 1860s.  During his early work at county fairs, he was even known to play his violin to perform for the audience when he wasn't boxing amateurs and volunteers.", "Mace met the Black boxer Bob Travers on 21 February 1860.  Travers, like Mace, was a friend of Nat Langham, and had boxed, and entertained, at his club at Westminster's Cambrian Stores. Mace would later compete against Travers in foot races.  Their boxing match was for \u00a350 a side, and they first fought six rounds off the Thames at the North Kent Marshes, and then, after the police intervened, they moved to a second location which was closer to, but still to the Southeast of London.    By the 33rd and 34th rounds, it was evident, that though Travers tried to lead, Mace had the better defence, and continued to get in more and harder punches.  Having had the better of the match, Mace finally won on a foul that occurred in the 57th round, when Travers appeared to intentionally throw himself on the ground to avoid his blow  after one hour, thirty-one minutes of fighting.", "On 24 February 1863, Mace was presented the Windham Gold Cup, a boxing trophy, by Sir William Frederick Windham at Criterion Hall, the precursor to the modern Criterion Theatre, in recognition of his winning the heavyweight boxing championship of England.  The trophy, said to contain 100 ounces of gold, was presented at Westminster's Leicester Square not far from Nat Langham's Cambrian Stores tavern and was considered to be worth \u00a380,000 in modern currency.Date of presentation in Illustrated Sporting News, London, England pg. 476, 7 March 1863, pg. 476"]}, {"page": "Langham", "response": ["*Nat Langham (1820\u20131871), English boxer"]}, {"page": "Tom Sayers", "response": ["===Loss to Nat Langham===", "thumb|right|Nat Langham, the only boxer to defeat Sayers", "In 1853, Sayers challenged Nat Langham, who, despite the absence of formal weight divisions, was widely accepted as England's middleweight champion. The fight took place on 18 October 1853 at Lakenheath, Suffolk. This was Sayers's toughest fight so far, and a combination of illness and inexperience contributed to his first and only defeat. The wily Langham gained the upper hand by temporarily blinding his opponent with frequent blows to the eyes. The end came in the 61st round with Sayers unable to see his opponent, who could therefore strike him at will. Sayers was still reluctant to quit, however, and one of his seconds, Alec Keene was forced to \"throw up the sponge\" to signify the end of the contest. Once his eyes were healed, Sayers requested a re-match but Langham announced his retirement from the prize-ring.", "| Nat Langham"]}, {"page": "Thomas King (boxer)", "response": ["These victories led to his first attempt to attain the English heavyweight crown from Jem Mace on 28 January 1862 before a crowd of around 400.

In the 40th, Mace downed King with two uppercuts to the jaw, and fell upon him.  In the 43rd Mace landed another uppercut to the jaw prior to several close in blows, and then threw King who collapsed and was unable to rise.
