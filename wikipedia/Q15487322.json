The soloists were Heddle Nash, Gladys Ripley, Dennis Noble and Norman Walker. This is the only recording to date that employs different singers for the Priest and the Angel of the Agony. The first stereophonic recording was made by EMI in 1964, conducted by Sir John Barbirolli. It has remained in the catalogues continuously since its first release, and is notable for Janet Baker's singing as the Angel. Benjamin Britten's 1971 recording for Decca was noted for its fidelity to Elgar's score, showing, as the Gramophone reviewer said, that \"following the composer's instructions strengthens the music's dramatic impact\".

But it was increasingly as a lieder singer that he was most highly esteemed. His lieder recitals were noted for their strong and intelligent construction and choice of material, and his singing for their roundness and firmness of tone, the flexibility and nuance of expression, and sureness of touch in mood-depiction.  He was capable of bringing to life the wide emotional range of Schubert's lieder. Gerald Moore, who sometimes accompanied him on the piano, referred to him as \"that immaculate artist\", describing him as \"a large, tall man\", and stated that Boyce \"is recognised in Germany today as  with his superb enunciation and his knowledge of the literature.\"Moore, Am I too loud? (Harmondsworth 1966, 107.) In addition to the above-cited Hugo Wolf lieder album, he did two others for Oiseau-Lyre, one of Schubert and one of Brahms.
