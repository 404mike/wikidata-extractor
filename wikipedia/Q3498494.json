The suspect's profession meant he frequently travelled around the UK and the dates and locations of his performances coincide with when and where the letters to the police were sent from. The suspect's presence in Bradford around Christmas 1888 also coincides with the murder of a seven-year-old boy, Johnnie Gill, a murder which the Ripper had foretold to police in a letter."]}, {"page": "John Liptrot Hatton", "response": ["Hatton was born in Liverpool to a musical family, for both his father John and grandfather were violinists. Although largely self-taught as a musician, he became a pupil of Michael Maybrick (uncle of the singer and composer Stephen Adams), who was also the teacher of Charles Santley's father, and also studied in the academy of a Mr. Molyneux. By the age of 16 he had become organist in the churches of Woolton and Childwall and at the Roman Catholic church in Liverpool. (Auditioning for Woolton, he played a voluntary upon the street-song \"All round my Hat\", hinting at his own name.William Smart, Musical Memories (Sonnenschein, London 1888) (& Reprint by Cambridge University Press 2013), XVIII: John Liphot Hatton, pp. 309\u2013323. This book is the origin of the mis-spelling of the name 'Liptrot'.) A man of many-sided talents and a broad humour attending them, he appeared as an actor on the Liverpool stage.C. Santley, Student and Singer: The Reminiscences of Charles Santley (Edward Arnold, London 1892), p. 6. Subsequently, he found his way to London as a member of Macready's company at Drury Lane, appearing in a cast led by Macready and Kean in Shakespeare's Othello in December 1832.J.A. Fuller Maitland, 'Hatton, John Liptrot', in L. Stephen and S. Lee (Eds), Dictionary of National Biography Vol. 25 (Elder Smith & Co., London 1891), p. 166. Santley tells that Hatton took the part of Joe Blueskin (who has the song \"Jolly Nose\") in the play of Jack Sheppard when it was mounted independently at the Liver Theatre (the 'Little Liver') in Liverpool, simultaneously with the London production (of 1839) in which Paul Bedford took the same role: Hatton scored so great a success that the London production fell flat when it came to Liverpool.Santley, Student and Singer, pp. 6\u20137. Meanwhile, he was making his mark as a musician: in 1835 Thomas Attwood wrote to Mendelssohn, \"We have recently had a new establishment here which is called 'The Society of British Musicians', in the hope of bringing forward native talent... I, however, wish you would look at your cloak, or great-coat, lest you should have had a bit cut out of it: for there is a young man of the name of Hatton, who seems to have got a little bit of it, indeed he seems to assimilate to your style without plagiary more than anyone I have met with.\"Letter of 9 February 1835, quoted in Musical Times, cited in Harold Simpson, A Century of Ballads, 1810\u20131910, Their Composers and Singers, (Mills and Boon, London c.1911), pp. 127\u201328."]}, {"page": "United Grand Lodge of England", "response": [" Another thesis, promoted by Bruce Robinson in his They All Love Jack (2015), attempts to link the case to freemasonry through Michael Maybrick."]}, {"page": "Florence Maybrick", "response": ["James Maybrick was taken ill on 27 April 1889 after self-administering a double dose of strychnine.

Yapp intercepted all letters sent by Florence and passed them onto Maybrick's brother, Edwin, who was staying at Battlecrease. Edwin, himself by many accounts one of Florence's lovers, shared the contents of the letter with his brother Michael Maybrick, who was effectively the head of the family and who also hated Florence. By Michael's orders Florence was immediately deposed as mistress of her house and held under house arrest. On 9 May, a nurse reported that Florence had surreptitiously tampered with a Valentine's Meat Juice bottle that was afterwards found to contain a half-grain of arsenic. Florence later testified that her husband had begged her to administer it as a pick-me-up.
