It was not suspected that he had murdered her and, even less, that he was Jack the Ripper, until recently, when he was proposed on the basis of speculation and circumstantial evidence.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jack the Ripper suspects", "response": ["===Joseph Barnett===", "left|60px|Joseph BarnettJoseph Barnett (c. 1858\u20131927) was a former fish porter, and victim Mary Kelly's lover from 8 April 1887 to 30 October 1888, when they quarrelled and separated after he lost his job and she returned to prostitution to make a living. Inspector Abberline questioned him for four hours after Kelly's murder, and his clothes were examined for bloodstains, but he was then released without charge. A century after the murders, author Bruce Paley proposed him as a suspect as Kelly's scorned or jealous lover, and suggested that he'd committed the other murders to scare Kelly off the streets and out of prostitution.Rumbelow, p. 262; Whitehead and Rivett, pp. 122\u2013123 Other authors suggest he killed Kelly only, and mutilated the body to make it look like a Ripper murder, but Abberline's investigation appears to have exonerated him.Rumbelow, p. 262 Other acquaintances of Kelly put forward as her murderer include her landlord John McCarthy and her former boyfriend Joseph Fleming.Whitehead and Rivett, p. 123"]}, {"page": "Mary Jane Kelly", "response": ["Compared with the other four canonical Ripper victims, Mary Kelly's origins are obscure and undocumented, and much of this information is possibly embellished. Kelly may have fabricated many details of her early life as there is no corroborating documentary evidence, but there is no evidence to the contrary either.Fido, p. 87 According to Joseph Barnett, the man she had most recently lived with prior to her murder, Kelly had told him she was born in Limerick, Ireland, in around 1863\u2014although whether she referred to the city or the county is not known\u2014and that her family moved to Wales when she was a child.Evans and Rumbelow, p. 177; Fido, p. 84 ", "==Acquaintance with Joseph Barnett==", "By 1886, Kelly resided at Cooley's Lodging House in Thrawl Street, Spitalfields.Eddleston, Jack the Ripper: An Encyclopedia p. 98Eddleston, Jack the Ripper: An Encyclopedia, p. 63 On 8 April 1887, she became acquainted with 28-year-old Joseph Barnett, whom she first encountered on Commercial Street. Barnett\u2014who worked as a fish porter at Billingsgate Market\u2014took Kelly for a drink before arranging to meet her the following day.", "After two official crime scene photographs had been taken, Kelly's body was taken from Miller's Court to the mortuary in Shoreditch, where her body was formally identified by Joseph Barnett, who was only able to recognise Kelly's body by \"the ear and the eyes\".Evans and Rumbelow, p. 177; Marriott, p. 172 John McCarthy also viewed the body at the mortuary and was also certain the decedent was Kelly.", "The first witness to testify was Joseph Barnett, who testified he had lived with Kelly for \"one year and eight months\" before the two had separated following a quarrel on 30 October over her allowing \"a woman of bad character\" to stay in her room, whom Kelly had \"took in out of compassion\". Barnett explained that, despite this argument, he had remained on good terms with Kelly in the week following their separation, and that he had last seen her alive at approximately 7:45\u00a0p.m. on 8 November. On the final occasion he had seen Kelly, she had been \"quite sober\".", "===Joseph Barnett===", "The detective in charge of the investigation, Frederick Abberline, questioned Kelly's former partner and roommate, Joseph Barnett, for four hours after her murder. His clothes were also examined for bloodstains, but he was released without charge. Abberline's investigation appears to have completely exonerated Barnett.Marriott, p. 259; Rumbelow, p. 262", "In 2005, author Tony Williams claimed that Mary Kelly had been found on the 1881 census return for Brymbo, near Wrexham, Wales. This claim was made on the basis that living next door to the Kelly family was a bachelor named Jonathan Davies, who could have been the \"Davies\" or \"Davis\" whom Joseph Barnett claimed had married Kelly when she was approximately 16. This claim is almost certainly wrong because if Kelly's husband was indeed killed two or three years later, this Jonathan Davies could not have been him, as the 1891 census return indicates this individual was still alive and residing in Brymbo. In any case, hardly any of the details given by Barnett matched those of the family residing in Brymbo in 1881. Brymbo is in Denbighshire, not Carmarthen or Caernarfon, and the father's name was Hubert Kelly, not John. Allegations that the diaries of Sir John Williams, on which Tony Williams based his research and whom he claims was the Ripper, were altered casts further doubt upon this author's theories.Pegg, Jennifer (October 2005). \"Uncle Jack Under the Microscope\".

The eight individuals within the two mourning coaches following Kelly's polished elm and oak coffin from Shoreditch Church to the cemetery where she was buried were Joseph Barnett, an individual representing John McCarthy, and six women who had known Kelly and who had testified at the inquest into her murder: Mary Ann Cox; Elizabeth Prater; Caroline Maxwell; Sarah Lewis; Julia Venturney; and Maria Harvey. Several thousand people gathered outside Shoreditch Church to observe the funeral procession.Begg, Jack the Ripper: The Facts, pp. 310-311 Kelly's obituary ran as follows:"]}]}}
