The Farinas originally consisted of John \"Charlie\" Whitney, Tim Kirchin (born around 1944, Birstall, Leicestershire died circa 2000), Harry Ovenall (born Richard Harry Ovenall, 12 September 1943, Peterborough, Cambridgeshire), and Jim King, forming at Leicester Art College in 1962. Ric Grech replaced Kirchin on bass in 1965 and Roger Chapman joined the following year on vocals. The American record producer Kim Fowley suggested they call themselves \"The Family\" as they regularly wore double-breasted suits in performances, giving themselves a mafia appearance, a look they soon abandoned in favour of a more casual dress code.", "Family gave their final concert at the Hawthorn Building of Leicester Polytechnic on 13 October 1973. Many of its members went on to different musical projects; Roger Chapman and John \"Charlie\" Whitney formed the band Streetwalkers; John Wetton played with King Crimson and eventually became the lead singer of the band Asia. Rob Townsend was a member of Medicine Head between 1973 and 1975. He has been a member of The Blues Band since 1979 and of The Manfreds since 1991. Ric Grech died of kidney and liver failure in 1990 at the age of 43, as a result of alcoholism. Tony Ashton died in 2001 at the age of 55 of cancer. Jim King died on 6 February 2012 in Middlewich, Cheshire, at the age of 69. Wetton died on 31 January 2017, at the age of 67.", "Family's sound was distinguished by several factors. The vocals of Roger Chapman, described as a \"bleating vibrato\" and an \"electric goat\", were considered unique, although Chapman was trying to emulate the voices of R&B and soul singers Little Richard and Ray Charles, with some reviewers noting however that Chapman's voice could be grating and irritating occasionally. John \"Charlie\" Whitney was an accomplished and innovative guitarist, and Family's often complex song arrangements were made possible through having multi-instrumentalists like Ric Grech, Jim King and Poli Palmer in the band and access to keyboards such as the Hammond organ, the new Mellotron, violin, flute and vibraphone. The band's sound has been variously described as progressive rock, psychedelic rock, acid rock, folk rock, jazz fusion, not to mention \"British art rock,\" and hard rock.", "*John \"Charlie\" Whitney \u2013 guitars, sitar, keyboards (1966\u20131973)", "*John \"Charlie\" Whitney - guitars, keyboards", "*John \"Charlie\" Whitney - guitars, keyboards", "*John \"Charlie\" Whitney - guitars, keyboards", "*John \"Charlie\" Whitney - guitars, keyboards", "*John \"Charlie\" Whitney - guitars, keyboards", "*John \"Charlie\" Whitney - guitars, keyboards", "*John \"Charlie\" Whitney - guitars"]}, {"page": "Multi-neck guitar", "response": ["* John \"Charlie\" Whitney of Family/Streetwalkers"]}, {"page": "The Weaver's Answer", "response": ["Category:Songs written by John \"Charlie\" Whitney"]}, {"page": "Charlie Whitney", "response": ["#REDIRECT John \"Charlie\" Whitney"]}, {"page": "Streetwalkers", "response": ["Streetwalkers were an English rock band formed in late 1973 by two former members of rock band Family, vocalist Roger Chapman and guitarist John \"Charlie\" Whitney.

The boy lies on the grass, daydreaming and concentrating on the only audible sound in proximity - the buzzing of a honeybee.  With the temperature at 95 degrees (35 \u00b0C), the boy and his mule prefer to enjoy the warmth of the day by relaxing. Aware that people think the boy and the mule - both of which are expected to be more industrious - are lazy, the boy admits as much, but adds, \"But one day they're going to see / We're only doing what makes us happy.\" No Mule's Fool is a quirky, fascinating, perfect little summer song, unlike any other. The grass is a drugs reference and in my mind the immoveable mule is the creature the partaker becomes when stoned (\"I take the grass, he hits the hay \u2026\"). We ask nothing more than to be left alone to \"spend our lazy days and ways just turning on\". A country and western influence appears in the coda when the music conjures up a Quixotian image of man and mule plodding off into the sunset.
