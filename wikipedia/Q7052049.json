Described as \"a brawny centre-half\", Carnaby was used as cover for David Affleck. Carnaby made his first-team debut when he replaced Affleck for the match at Tottenham Hotspur on Christmas Eve, 1938 (the day before his 25th birthday). Carnaby retained his place at centre-half for the next five matches, including a 4\u20131 defeat at non-league Chelmsford City in the FA Cup. After Affleck's return, Carnaby was switched to right-half for four matches, replacing Ray Parkin. His final run of matches came when he replaced Norman Chalk at centre-half for the last four matches of the season."]}, {"page": "List of people from Hampshire", "response": ["*Norman Chalk, footballer, was born in Bitterne"]}]}}
