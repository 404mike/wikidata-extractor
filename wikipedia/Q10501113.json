The visitors scored early on, but Small Heath's shoot-on-sight policy produced goals for Hands, after a clash with Mobley left Preston goalkeeper James Trainer on the floor, and for Wheldon, before Edward Brueton, deputising in goal for the injured Partridge, let in a soft goal just before half-time. The second half brought \"more finesse and less vigour\" from the home side, but Preston grew stronger, took the lead, and Small Heath \"appeared to be done with\". Then Trainer could only turn Mobley's lob in off the post, the same player gave his side the lead, but \"before the Small Heath contingent had finished congratulating one another\", \"North End charging down the field finely from the centre kick scored again before the whistle sounded\" to make the final score 4\u20134.

The forwards, with Frank Mobley the honourable exception, were \"lamentably deficient in shooting ability\", missing two early chances which \"had their shooting been only of a medium character\" would have opened the scoring. With only a month of the season gone, the Post suggested it was high time results began to change or there was a real prospect of relegation via the test matches. A visit to Preston North End produced a much improved performance but still no points. After Preston opened the scoring against the run of play, Small Heath took the lead through a \"couple of stinging shots\" from Mobley, who appeared to score a third soon after half-time, but it was disallowed because goalkeeper James Trainer was impeded. Small Heath were playing the better football, and the home fans began to jeer their team.

The feat was achieved despite local amateur Alf Pugh starting in goal for Wales after the original selection, James Trainer, failed to arrive at the match. Pugh played the first 30 minutes before Wrexham's Sam Gillam arrived and took his place, thus becoming the first substitute ever used in international football. The following year, Wales played a home fixture outside the nation for the first time when a meeting with Ireland was held in Shrewsbury in an attempt to draw a large crowd. Wales won the match 5\u20132. By the early 1890s, with the domestic game thriving in England, Wales were struggling to get players released for international fixtures, particularly for away matches against Ireland which required a three-day absence from a player's club due to ferry travel. As a result, Wales finished bottom of the British Home Championship five times during the decade, including three consecutive seasons between 1891 and 1893. Wales did record their highest placed finish to date in 1895 by coming second to England after drawing all three of their fixtures, inspired by the likes of James Trainer, Billy Lewis and a debuting Billy Meredith."]}, {"page": "1890 National League of Baseball of Great Britain", "response": ["*James Trainer"]}, {"page": "1889 World Championship (football)", "response": ["|GK |||| James Trainer"]}]}}
