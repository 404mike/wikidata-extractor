Dowie's continuing good form at club level meant it was something of a surprise when she was left out of England's 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup squad.

The move was made by the FA in response to age-level changes FIFA had made to its oldest women's youth competition, now named FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup. The age limit was raised from being a U-19 tournament to a U-20 tournament. This adjustment, coupled with a newly introduced U-23 age limit to the Nordic Cup, prompted the FA to rethink and eventually change the youth development team. The team continues to serve as a stepping-stone for players to the England women's national team. Brent Hills explained that it had become more of a challenge to break into the senior team: \"When I started, if you were an extremely talented 18-year-old you may have been able to get into the senior team. I'll give you an example, Fara Williams. You would have to be the next Kelly Smith now to be able to do that.\"", "*  Brent Hills (2004\u20132013)"]}, {"page": "Gemma Bonner", "response": ["Bonner made her first senior appearance in September 2013, under interim coach Brent Hills, in an 8\u20130 World Cup qualifying win over Turkey at Fratton Park.
