Yeo was part of the side managed by Keith Alexander that were defeated in the League Two play-off final several times. Before his spells at Sincil Bank Yeo had played in Northern Ireland for Ards and Coleraine at non-league level for Curzon Ashton, Hyde United and Atherton Collieries. In 2005, he left Lincoln for the first time after he was scouted by newly formed A-League side New Zealand Knights and became one of the clubs marquee signings. His stay was only brief and he had returned to Lincoln only months later. In 2006, he followed Keith Alexander firstly to Peterborough United and later Chester City, Bury and Macclesfield Town. In 2009, he returned to non-league football by joining Conference North side Droylsden before later joining Harrogate Town and New Mills. In 2011, he retired from competitive football but following the sudden death of Alexander who was then manager of Macclesfield, he re-signed for the club.

Lincoln lost yet again in the play-offs at the end of the 2005\u201306 season, this time to local rivals Grimsby Town, giving Alexander the unenviable record of being the only manager to lead a team to four consecutive play-off defeats.
