Clive Finlayson, evolutionary biologist at the Gibraltar Museum said \"this natural richness of wildlife and plants in the nearby sandy plains, woodlands, shrublands, wetlands, cliffs and coastline probably helped the Neanderthals to persist.\" Evidence at the cave shows the Neanderthals of Gibraltar likely used it as a shelter \"for 100,000 years.\" Cro-Magnon man took over Gibraltar around 24,000 BCE."]}, {"page": "Gorham's Cave", "response": ["Those who claim it has symbolic meaning cannot explain what it would have meant.

I'm speculating, but it does make you wonder whether it has something to do with mapping, or saying: 'This is where you are'.\" Francesco d'Errico, the director of research at CRNS, comments: \"It's in a fixed location so, for example, it could be something to indicate to other Neanderthals visiting the cave that somebody was already using it, or that there was a group that owned that cave.\" Harrold Dibble comments that \"It takes more than a few scratches\u2014deliberate or not\u2014to identify symbolic behaviour on the part of Neanderthals.\"", "In November 2010, the Gorham's Cave complex was put forward to compete for a nomination as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Researchers have been able to establish that the people there selected, collected and transported mussels to the cave. The cave contains a hearth, and H. neanderthalensis left evidence of burning which could be used to open the shells. The shellfish also included limpets and these are widely found at other H. neanderthalensis sites, however experts remain divided as to whether these were a significant part of the diet or just a useful snack. Clive Finlayson has argued that the diet was very varied and that evidence found within the caves indicates that six types of vegetation were within easy reach of the caves. H. neanderthalensis lived there for a short time but evidence shows that they were knapping stones as they ate the molluscs. Carcasses of seals were brought to the cave and comparison with H. neanderthalensis sites at Capellades in Catalonia indicate that after being hunted they were butchered in the cave. The stains on monk seal, ibex, and red deer bones support this theory. The list of animals eaten in Vanguard include bream, dolphins, sea urchins, and bluefin tuna."]}, {"page": "Geraldine Finlayson", "response": ["In 2008, Finlayson, along with Prof. Clive Finlayson and Dr Darren Fa, visited Malta at the invitation of that nation's Superintendence of Cultural Heritage.
