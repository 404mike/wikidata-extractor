A poor start to the 1976\u201377 season led Docherty to resign and he was replaced by Bill Dodgin Jr. After a period of consolidation, Dodgin's signings Pat Kruse, Paul Shrubb, Barry Lloyd, Len Bond, Willie Graham, Barry Tucker and Doug Allder strengthened a developing team which was spearheaded by forwards Steve Phillips, Andrew McCulloch and Gordon Sweetzer.

A 4\u20130 win over Rochdale at Griffin Park on 6 March put the Bees back on the cusp of the promotion places for the first time since mid-December, but the shock transfer of forward Gordon Sweetzer to Cambridge United two days later for a \u00a330,000 fee was seen as a massive risk. Sweetzer had scored 40 goals from his 72 appearances for the club over 18 months, but manager Dodgin felt that with Steve Phillips having scored 16 goals from midfield so far in the season, Phillips could move up to the forward line to partner Andrew McCulloch. The decision proved to be a masterstroke, with Phillips scoring 16 goals in the final 15 matches of the season and promotion to the Third Division was secured with two matches still to play, after a 2\u20130 victory over Darlington at Griffin Park on 22 April. Phillips' 36 goals meant that he finished the season as the top scorer in English league football, while Andrew McCulloch and the departed Gordon Sweetzer supported ably with 22 and 14 goals respectively.", "|Barry Tucker", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Barry Tucker", "| Barry Tucker"]}, {"page": "1978\u201379 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["|Barry Tucker", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Barry Tucker"]}, {"page": "1979\u201380 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["|Barry Tucker", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Barry Tucker"]}, {"page": "1980\u201381 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["After narrowly saving Brentford from relegation to the Fourth Division at the end of the previous season, interim manager Fred Callaghan was given the job on a full-time basis, with Ron Harris appointed as his assistant.White, p. 314-315.
