To finance his record collection, he performed at illegal warehouse raves in the Blackburn and Blackpool areas. With the assistance of another local DJ, Jon DaSilva, Sasha secured work at The Ha\u00e7ienda, where he learned key mixing (matching melodic keys) from DaSilva and refined his ability to beatmatch (to synchronize the beats of two simultaneously playing records). Though he enjoyed playing at The Ha\u00e7ienda, in 1990 Sasha left for a club called Shelley's Laserdrome in Stoke-on-Trent. There, he established part of his signature sound by mixing euphoric acid house music with Italian piano house and emotional a cappellas. Because of his increased popularity and visibility at Shelley's, Mixmag featured Sasha on its first cover, under the headline \"SASHA MANIA \u2013 THE FIRST DJ PINUP?\". While continuing to DJ, Sasha began to produce several of his own dance tracks. This, he later noted, was contrary to the career paths of many successful DJs, for whom it was more common to start out as producers. Upon signing a recording contract, he also set up an entire recording studio at the same time, which led to a \"painful learning curve\" at the outset. He released his first single, \"Appolonia\", under the name BM:Ex (the name is short for The Barry Manilow Experience, a joke in reference to Sasha's love of the piano), with producer Tom Frederikse on Union City Recordings. After DJing at Shelley's for several years, Sasha left his position because of increasing gang violence in and around the club. As a result of his growing reputation, Sasha was offered work in several London and Australian clubs. He accepted, instead, a spot in the DJ rotation at Renaissance, a club night started by Geoff Oakes at Venue 44 in Mansfield, England."]}, {"page": "24 Hour Party People", "response": ["* Jon DaSilva as himself, reprising his time as resident DJ at The Ha\u00e7ienda"]}, {"page": "Mighty Force Records", "response": ["The store soon became a regular stop-off point for many internationally known DJs including, Sasha, Andrew Weatherall, Lee Burridge, Jon DaSilva and Felix Buxton later of Basement Jaxx and was the catalyst for the fledgling West Country techno movement."]}, {"page": "John D'Silva (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Jon DaSilva (born 1963), British DJ and producer"]}, {"page": "Jon dasilva", "response": ["#REDIRECT Jon DaSilva "]}, {"page": "David Dunne (DJ)", "response": ["David Dunne's DJ career spans more than thirty years on radio and as a club DJ.
