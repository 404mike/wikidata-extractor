The specific epithet combines the Latin castaneus meaning \"chestnut-coloured\" and coronatus meaning \"crowned\".

Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Lialis burtonis, p. 43). Burton's legless lizard (Lialis burtonis) is a member of the genus Lialis within the family Pygopodidae. There are approximately 40 species in the family Pygopodidae, however, Burton's legless lizard and another species (L. jicari) are the only species that fall within genus Lialis. Members in genus Lialis are considered analogous to macrostomatan snakes as these taxonomic groups have functionally similar adaptations such as the ability to swallow relatively large prey whole. However, their resemblance to snakes is merely superficial example of convergent evolution, and they are not closely related.Wall M, Shine R (2007). \"Dangerous food: Lacking venom and constriction, how do snake-like lizards (Lialis burtonis, Pygopodidae) subdue their lizard prey?\" Biological Journal of the Linnean Society 91 (4): 719-727.
