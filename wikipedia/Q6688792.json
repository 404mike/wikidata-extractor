She was the daughter of the musician Louise Henriette Elizabeth Sueur and the commission merchant Carl Hermann Ernst Matthaei, she had a brother and three younger sisters, including Louise Howard. Matthaei attended North London Collegiate School for Girls and Newnham College, Cambridge, and later worked as assistant to Frederick Blackman, producing significant work on cellular respiration. Between 1902 and 1905, Blackman and Matthaei set out to discover the role of temperature in photosynthesis and performed the first such experiments, finding that carbon fixation is based on biochemical reactions which depend on temperature. Although the experiment is inaccurately known as the Blackman Reaction, a significant part of the work was carried out by Matthaei and the 1904 paper communicated to the Royal Society by Francis Darwin bears only her name."]}, {"page": "Louise Ernestine Matthaei", "response": ["#REDIRECT Louise Howard"]}, {"page": "Louise Ernestine, Lady Howard", "response": ["#redirect Louise Howard"]}, {"page": "Ruth (television play)", "response": ["|Louise Howard"]}]}}
