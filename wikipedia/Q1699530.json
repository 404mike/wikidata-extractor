He is well known for his many film, TV and stage credits, and for his contributions to \"pop\" recordings, notably those by Donovan, Cilla Black and the group Hot Chocolate.

Carr's conga style and McNair's flute playing are a feature of many recordings. Cameron, McNair and Carr also accompanied Donovan on several concert tours and can be heard on his 1968 live album Donovan in Concert.", "By 1966, Donovan had shed the Dylan/Guthrie influences and become one of the first British pop musicians to adopt flower power. He immersed himself in jazz, blues, Eastern music, and the new generation of counterculture-era US West Coast bands such as Jefferson Airplane and the Grateful Dead. He was entering his most creative phase as a songwriter and recording artist, working with Mickie Most and with arranger, musician, and jazz fan John Cameron. Their first collaboration was \"Sunshine Superman\", one of the first psychedelic pop records."]}, {"page": "Zorro", "response": ["*A musical titled Zorro opened in the West End of London in 2008.
