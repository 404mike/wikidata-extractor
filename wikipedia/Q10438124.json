He was signed for Clyde, by his father John, and spent two years with the club before transferring to Nottingham Forest. His move to Nottingham was unsuccessful, and after two loan spells, he joined Mansfield Town. He returned to Scotland in 1992, joining Clyde's arch-rivals Partick Thistle. He stayed there for a season, before rejoining Clyde. He went on to have spells with Macclesfield Town and Albion Rovers, before retiring in 1997 after a short spell in the juniors with Armadale Thistle.\nClark has also worked as a coach for Jim McInally at Greenock Morton, youth teams at Celtic and East Stirlingshire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Brogan (footballer, born 1954)", "response": ["Brogan had a spell in charge of Arbroath between 1995 and 1996. Following his spell at Gayfield, he moved into Junior football, forming a managerial partnership with former Clyde player Martin Clark. The pair took charge of East Region outfit Armadale Thistle in 1996 then moved to Blantyre Victoria a year later, winning promotion for the Vics in 1998."]}, {"page": "Paddy Connolly", "response": ["During his time at Dundee United, Connolly was involved in one of Scottish football's more bizarre moments when he was denied a hat-trick in a February 1993 match against Partick Thistle at Firhill after referee Les Mottram failed to notice his shot had entered the goal and come back from the supporting stanchion. Despite Partick defender Martin Clark catching the ball and handing it to goalkeeper Andy Murdoch to restart, Mottram missed both the goal and handball to wave play on. Connolly scored twice in the match in a 4\u20130 win. Mottram went on to officiate in the 1994 World Cup the following year. The incident resulted in the stanchions from which the ball had rebounded, previously widely used, being removed in a re-design of football goalposts. In 2018, at the same end of the stadium, a similar incident occurred, with Partick Thistle this time being denied a legitimate goal."]}, {"page": "Andy Murdoch (footballer, born 1968)", "response": ["Murdoch was involved in one of Scottish football's more bizarre moments when Paddy Connolly scored past him in a February 1993 match against Dundee United at Firhill, but referee Les Mottram failed to notice the ball had entered the goal and come back from the supporting stanchion after the close-range shot.
