He was again elected at the 1857 general election, although the vote unusually resulted in a triple return with his fellow incumbent Conservative MP Edward Fellowes securing the same number of votes as the Whig cricketer John Heathcote. After scrutiny, Heathcote was declared unduly elected a few months later. Rust held the seat until the 1859 general election when he did not stand.", "link_mentions": {}}}
