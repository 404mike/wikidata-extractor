However, one contemporary commentator stated that the new boys, including Thomas Cooke, did well. County goalkeeper Tom Widdowson could do nothing to stop the shot from Albert Brown that put Villa ahead. Widdowson had parried a powerful shot from Villa forward, Archie Hunter, but he couldn\u2019t hold the ball which fell to Brown who scored. County played well after going behind and Thomas Cooke powered two shots goal-bound but both struck the goalpost. County got back into the game and scored a deserved equalizer by Bob Jardine. 1-1 at Half-Time."]}]}}
