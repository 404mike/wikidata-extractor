Morley was a staunch monarchist and royal servant.\nJohn Parker was born at Saltram House on 29 May 1923, the son of Hon John Holford Parker (1886\u20131955) by his wife Hon Marjory Katherine Elizabeth St. Aubyn (b.1893), a daughter of the 2nd Baron St Levan. His grandfather was Albert Parker, 3rd Earl of Morley (1843\u20131905), and the 4th and 5th Earls, his uncles, had died without issue. The 5th Earl, known to the family as uncle Monty, was a soldier, and one of the original 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' on the Parker Expedition of 1911. The intrepid earl became an imperial hero, known for his derring-do. A trained archaeologist, he joined other civil servants in an excavation in Jerusalem on a very holy day in the city celebrated by all three great world religions. His courage did not prevent the street violence that erupted, forcing him to leave in a hurry, abandoning the tools of the trade in situ.", "link_mentions": {}}}
