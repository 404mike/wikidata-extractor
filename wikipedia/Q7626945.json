Knightley described the script as unique, one that made the reader think. Co-starring Andrew Garfield and Carey Mulligan, Knightley played Ruth, one of three graduates of an autocratic boarding school that discovers their fates in a dystopia.-  She appeared in a video installation by artist Stuart Pearson Wright titled Maze."]}, {"page": "List of British painters", "response": ["*Stuart Pearson Wright (born 1975)"]}, {"page": "Wright", "response": ["*Stuart Pearson Wright (born 1975), English artist"]}, {"page": "Geoffrey Palmer (actor)", "response": ["In the New Year's Honours List published 31 December 2004 he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to drama.
