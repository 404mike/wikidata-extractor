", "The Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada, John Graves Simcoe (in office 1791\u20131796), named the township of Markham, north of the town of York (now Toronto), after his friend William Markham, then Archbishop of York. William Berczy first surveyed Markham as a township in 1793, and in 1794 led 75 German families (including the Ramers, Reesors, Wheters, Burkholders, Bunkers, Wicks and Lewis) from Upstate New York to an area of Markham now known as German Mills.For a complete history, cf. Isabel Champion, ed., Markham: 1793\u20131900 (Markham, ON: Markham Historical Society, 1979). Each family was granted  of land; however the lack of roads in the region led many to settle in York (present-day Toronto) and Niagara. German Mills later became a ghost town. Between 1803 and 1812 another attempt at settling the region was made. The largest group of settlers were Pennsylvania Dutch, most of them Mennonites. These highly skilled craftsmen and knowledgeable farmers settled the region and founded Reesorville, named after the Mennonite settler Joseph Reesor.See I. Champion, Markham: 1793\u20131900 (Markham, ON: Markham Historical Society, 1979), p. 248; also Markham Village \u2013 A Brief History 1800\u20131919 , Markham Public Library (website). In 1825 Reesorville was renamed to Markham, having taken the name of the unincorporated village (see Markham Village, Ontario)."]}, {"page": "Richard Price", "response": ["The support Price gave to the colonies of British North America in the American War of Independence made him famous. In early 1776 he published Observations on the Nature of Civil Liberty, the Principles of Government, and the Justice and Policy of the War with America. Sixty thousand copies of this pamphlet were sold within days; and a cheap edition was issued which sold twice as many copies.J. H. Plumb, England in the Eighteenth Century, (Middlesex: Penguin Books Ltd, 1950) It commended Shelburne's proposals for the colonies, and attacked the Declaratory Act. Amongst its critics were Adam Ferguson, William Markham, John Wesley, and Edmund Burke; and Price rapidly became one of the best known men in England. He was presented with the freedom of the city of London, and it is said that his pamphlet had a part in determining the Americans to declare their independence. A second pamphlet on the war with America and the debts of Great Britain, followed in the spring of 1777. Price was a consistent critic of war in general and the corrupting effects of growing government debt."]}, {"page": "Edward Venables-Vernon-Harcourt", "response": ["After the death of Archbishop William Markham.
