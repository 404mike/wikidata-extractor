He is currently works at the academy of Rosenborg Kvinner.\nShroot started his career at Wimbledon as an eight-year-old, progressing through the club's youth system before being released at 16. He then spent time at Staines Town's academy, laying a peripheral first-team role during the 2005\u201306 campaign. In September 2006, Shroot joined AFC Wimbledon, again making a sporadic number of appearances throughout the 2006\u201307 season. In November 2007, he was loaned out to Harrow Borough on an initial one-month loan deal, later extended to three months. He returned to his parent club in January 2008, playing a part in the side that earned promotion to the Conference South. Shroot signed for Harrow on non-contract terms in September 2008 after failing to agree a contract at AFC Wimbledon.\nAfter impressing during the first half of the 2008\u201309 campaign, Shroot attracted interest from Birmingham City, and signed a 2+1\u20442-year contract with the club in January 2009. He made his first-team debut for Birmingham City in the FA Cup third round match against Wolverhampton Wanderers shortly after signing for the club. It was to be Shroot's only first-team appearance for the club. He was loaned out on three separate occasions during his time at Birmingham; to Walsall, Burton Albion and Cheltenham Town respectively.

Substitute Ben May was sent-off for the home side after \"squaring up\" to Tranmere goalkeeper Paul Rachubka with twenty minutes remaining. Despite the visitors having a one-man advantage, it was Stevenage who doubled the lead, Mark Roberts heading in Robin Shroot's cross to score his fifth goal of the campaign.

In the week prior to Stevenage's trip to Rochdale, speculation mounted as to whether Stevenage manager Graham Westley would remain at the club amidst interest from fellow League One side, Preston North End. Westley eventually joined Preston on 13 January, leaving the club after three-and-a-half years in charge. Westley took his back-room staff with him to Preston, meaning captain Mark Roberts was named as player-manager for the club's trip to Spotland on 14 January. The game ended 5\u20131 to Stevenage. Luke Freeman, playing his first game since signing for the club on a permanent basis, scored the opening goal when his shot squirmed under Rochdale goalkeeper P\u00e9ter Kurucz.

On the hour mark, MK Dons defender Mathias Doumb\u00e9 was sent-off for a second bookable offence after bringing down Chris Beardsley on the edge of the area. Stevenage took the lead from the resulting free-kick, with Scott Laird heading in Freeman's cross. The hosts had doubled their advantage three minutes later, Freeman again supplying the cross that was met by the head of Darius Charles, who firmly headed past MK Dons goalkeeper David Martin. With five minutes remaining, MK Dons scored their second goal of the game, with O'Shea crossing the ball for substitute Tom Flanagan to head into the net from six yards.

Stevenage won the game 1\u20130, courtesy of an injury-time header from Lawrie Wilson. Wilson connected with a low Darius Charles cross in the last minute of the match to give the home side their first league win in five outings.", "Similarly to the 2010\u201311 campaign, Stevenage faced Bury at home for the final game of the regular season. The team knew that a win against Bury would secure a place in the play-offs, irrespective of what both play-off rivals, Notts County and Carlisle United, did in their respective games. Stevenage won the match 3\u20130, opening the scoring midway through the first-half when Craig Reid quickly controlled Luke Freeman's left wing cross before striking the ball high into the roof of the net. News at half-time filtered around the stadium that Notts County were comfortably beating their opponents, Colchester United, and therefore nothing more than a win would suffice if Stevenage were to secure sixth place. Nerves were settled with ten minutes remaining when Robin Shroot was fouled in the area, and Joel Byrom stepped up to convert the spot-kick and double Stevenage's advantage. A third goal was added in injury-time when Shroot broke through the centre of midfield, before laying the ball out to substitute Chris Beardsley, who lashed in a shot at the near post that Bury goalkeeper Jonathan Bond could only get a hand to.", " The game was played on 12 November, with Stevenage securing a 1\u20130 away win.

Stevenage progressed to the Third Round for the second consecutive season after they beat Stourbridge 3\u20130 courtesy of three second-half goals. After a cagey first-half, Stevenage opened the scoring mid-way into the second period, with Chris Beardsley scoring from six yards out after Michael Bostwick's shot had been parried out by goalkeeper Lewis Solly.
