This aim allowed for flexibility in the structure and plot lines of the episodes; each individual episode usually dealt with an individual case for Marker, but story arcs spanning several episodes, or in one case an entire series, were produced during the life of the programme. Marker's work ranged broadly, from routine matters such as gathering evidence for divorces (at a time when British law required evidence of infidelity or other compelling reason for annulling a marriage) or creditworthiness enquiries, to more exotic investigations such as tracing missing people (or in one case, a prize-winning whippet).

Each episode had its own story, within an overarching plot of Lomax searching for his missing son and hunting down those who framed him.", "Travelling Man has often been compared to the mid-1960s American series The Fugitive, on which it draws both structurally and thematically. While protagonist Alan Lomax is not actually 'on the run', having served his time, it is clear from the start that the authorities still believe him guilty. While The Fugitive leaned heavily on the open landscapes of America, Travelling Man is set in the drug-infested world of the mid-1980s and in a location which adds a uniquely English slant to the fugitive subgenre: the canals and inland waterways of Britain. Although providing Lomax with both a home and a means of transport, the canals also exude a sense of quiet menace. There is an advantage, as he wryly observes in the opening episode: \"One thing about quiet waterways, you can hear footsteps.\" For many viewers, the canal network offered an unfamiliar environment, a sense of \u2018otherness\u2019, cut-off from the modern world, reinforcing the impression of Lomax as both an outsider and an alternative hero. In addition, the slower pace allows Lomax time to explore other people\u2019s narratives and provides his pursuers ample opportunity to spy on him and follow him at their leisure. Following the Western idea, Lomax\u2019s boat Harmony represents his faithful horse and his wagon.Based on DVD notes by Roger Marshall's son"]}, {"page": "Roger Marshall", "response": ["Roger Marshall may refer to:", "*Roger Marshall (cricketer) (born 1952), English cricketer", "*Roger Marshall (politician) (born 1960), U.S. Senator from Kansas", "*Roger Marshall (screenwriter) (1934\u20132020), English screenwriter"]}, {"page": "Floodtide (TV series)", "response": ["Floodtide is a British television crime drama was produced by Granada Television, first broadcast on ITV from 14 June 1987 to 12 February 1988.
