Born in Coatbridge, his earliest known club was Wolverhampton Wanderers. He made only five appearances for the club in the Football League Second Division before moving to Gillingham of the Third Division South in November 1926. He was a regular in the Gills' first team for the remainder of the 1926\u201327 season, playing 24 games and scoring three goals, including two in a 4\u20134 draw with Swindon Town.The following season, however, he lost his place to new signing Enos Bromage and, despite, returning for a run of nine consecutive first team games in October and November, he never made another Football League appearance for Gillingham and moved on to non-league club Walsall Wood. He later played for another minor club in the same area, Brownhills Albion.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Patrick Bradley", "response": ["Patrick Bradley may refer to:", "* Patrick Bradley (footballer) (born 1902), Scottish footballer", "* Patrick Bradley (rower), English rower"]}]}}
