Malouda scored against Schalke 04 in his first Champions League match for Chelsea, squeezing the ball through keeper Manuel Neuer's legs after turning his marker Rafinha. On 23 January, Malouda set up Joe Cole with a long pass to score against Everton in the League Cup; Chelsea won the tie 3\u20131 on aggregate.

They immediately tried to play him in down the left wing, but the pass was over-hit and went beyond Giggs. Arsenal finally got their first shot on target in the seventh minute of extra time, when a Van Persie free kick \u2013 awarded for a foul by Silvestre \u2013 forced a diving save from Carroll.Lawrenson, Motson (2005). Event occurs in the 97th minute; live coverage between 17:04pm and 17:06pm. Four minutes later, Manchester United appealed for a penalty kick when a cross from Giggs struck Cole, but replays showed that the ball hit the Arsenal full-back in the midriff. United sustained their attack, and the ball came to Scholes in the penalty area, but his shot on the turn was well saved by Lehmann. The resultant corner was taken short by Scholes, before it was played back to him; his cross found Van Nistelrooy unmarked in the area, but the Dutchman headed over the bar from the edge of the goal area. United then had another penalty shout when Giggs volleyed a long ball from Scholes into Tour\u00e9's body and up onto the Ivorian's hand, but referee Rob Styles turned their claims down. Arsenal then brought on Edu to replace Pires for the remaining 15 minutes."]}, {"page": "Stiles", "response": ["* Rob Styles (born 1964), English football referee"]}, {"page": "The Cowplain School", "response": ["* Rob Styles (Premier League Referee)"]}, {"page": "2007\u201308 Bristol Rovers F.C. season", "response": ["*24 November: Both Steve Elliott and Richard Walker received 3 match bans after being handed straight red cards by referee Rob Styles in a bad tempered derby with Swindon Town.
