Tasked with marking Middlesbrough's Charlie Ferguson on his debut, Tutin left him unmarked twice as Stoke crashed to a 6\u20131 defeat. However, he soon got to grips with top flight football and his lack of height was his main asset as his job in the side was to win the ball back and play in the wingers Frank Soo and Stanley Matthews and it was a task he excelled at. He became an ever-present in the Stoke side in the mid 30s playing every match during the 1935\u201336 season as Stoke finished in 4th position their highest up to that point.
