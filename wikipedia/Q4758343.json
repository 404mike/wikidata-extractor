What is particularly noticeable is the way the Genesis flood story follows the Gilgamesh flood tale \"point by point and in the same order\", even when the story permits other alternatives.Rendsburg, Gary (2007). \"The Biblical flood story in the light of the Gilgamesh flood account,\" in Gilgamesh and the world of Assyria, eds Azize, J & Weeks, N. Peters,  p.\u00a0117. In a 2001 Torah commentary released on behalf of the Conservative Movement of Judaism, rabbinic scholar Robert Wexler stated: \"The most likely assumption we can make is that both Genesis and Gilgamesh drew their material from a common tradition about the flood that existed in Mesopotamia. These stories then diverged in the retelling.\" Ziusudra, Utnapishtim and Noah are the respective heroes of the Sumerian, Akkadian and biblical flood legends of the ancient Near East."]}, {"page": "Andrew George", "response": ["Andrew George may refer to:", "* Andrew George (diplomat) (born 1952), Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Anguilla", "* Andrew George (politician) (born 1958), British Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament", "* Andrew George (immunologist) (born 1963), professor of immunology", "* Andrew George Jr. (born 1963), Canadian First Nation chef and writer", "* Andrew George Blair (1844\u20131907), Canadian politician", "* Andrew George Burry (1873\u20131975), American businessman", "* Andrew George Lehmann (1922\u20132006), English academic"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the British Academy elected in the 2000s", "response": ["* Professor Andrew George (School of Oriental and African Studies) Assyriology"]}, {"page": "Gilgamesh and Aga", "response": ["Aga is captured in the midst of his army.
