He is probably best remembered, however, for his appearance as \"Private Owen\" in the 1964 film Zulu, in which his character rallies outnumbered British soldiers by leading them in the stirring Welsh battle hymn \"Men of Harlech\" to counter the Zulu war chants.\nAfter losing his parents at an early age, Emmanuel began working as a coal miner. He developed a keen interest in music and singing, however, and was drawn to the stage. At the age of 20, he had his first professional theatre job in the musical Oklahoma!. He served as a chorister for the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in 1950\u20131951 but soon went on to play small roles in the West End productions of South Pacific, The King and I and Plain and Fancy.  His first leading role was Joe Hardy in Damn Yankees (1957), followed by a tour as Woody Mahoney in Finian's Rainbow.  In 1966, he appeared on Broadway in A Time for Singing and then in the West End in 110 in the Shade. He continued to play in summer seasons of theatre and in cabaret and variety into the 1980s.\nDuring the late 1950s, he participated in the Welsh language singing television programme Dewch i Mewn, and from 1958 to 1964 was lead singer on the TWW show, Gwlad y Gan (Land of Song), among other TV shows.  In 1960, he performed in the first televised edition of the Royal Variety Performance. He continued to perform on TV through the 1970s.  He also performed in concerts and is heard on cast recordings of Show Boat, Kiss Me, Kate, The King and I and A Time for Singing. He is also featured on the box set, The Greatest Musicals of the 20th Century, on the 1966 RCA Victrola recording of The Pirates of Penzance, and in a solo album, The Best of Ivor Emmanuel.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Port Talbot", "response": ["*Ivor Emmanuel, musical theatre and television singer and actor from Pontrhydyfen, Port Talbot."]}, {"page": "South Pacific (musical)", "response": ["Martin left the Broadway production in 1951 to appear in the original London West End production; Martha Wright replaced her.

A more homely programme Gwlad y Gan was produced by rival channel TWW which set classic Welsh songs in idyllic settings and starred baritone Ivor Emmanuel. The Anglo-American cultural influence was a strong draw on young musicians, with Tom Jones and Shirley Bassey becoming world-famous singers; and the growth of The Beatles' Apple Records label saw Welsh acts Mary Hopkin and Badfinger join the roster. Not to be outdone, the short lived Y Blew, born out of Aberystwyth University, became the first Welsh language pop band in 1967.

With a solid foundation of musical excellence and a respect for a Welsh musical tradition that held significance for an entire generation, the show caught a mood and struck a chord as it aimed to celebrate Wales within Wales and beyond. Broadcast in Welsh (but with bilingual captions on screen and bilingual voiced-over links), Land of Song was made in Cardiff by Television Wales and the West (TWW) and then distributed or \u2018networked\u2019 to ITV stations serving many parts of the country, thus reaching a nationwide audience which, in the early 1960s, peaked at around ten million viewers.  The Television Act 1954, which created the UK's second television channel, Independent Television (ITV), prohibited broadcasting on Sundays between 18:15 and 19:15 - unless the programmes were religious or in the Welsh language.  The BBC carried religious programmes at this time, so the choice for viewers was dire.  The ITV used the Television Act's loophole to transmit throughout the UK a programme in Welsh.  Since it was mostly singing, it did not matter that most viewers (including in Wales) did not understand it.  Having no competition, it drew very large audiences.  The downside was that advertising was not permitted: so the various companies of the ITV network were paying TWW in Cardiff for a programme which generated no income.  The upside was that it pulled viewers away from the BBC and, in an era before TV-remote-controls, delivered a large audience to the first entertainment programme, with commercials, at 19:15.", "Welsh baritone Ivor Emmanuel (1927\u20132007) was \"one of Britain's most popular singing stars of the 1950s and 1960s\" and is widely remembered for his role leading the \u2018Men of Harlech\u2019 battle hymn on the barricades in the 1964 film Zulu. Born in Margam but raised in Pontrhydyfen near Port Talbot, he began his singing career in the theatres of South Wales in the late 40s. In 1950 he won a part in the musical Oklahoma! in London's West End, and also joined the D\u2019Oyly Carte Opera Company chorus, appearing in a number of Savoy productions. Through the 1950s he added to his success on the West End stage with appearances in South Pacific (1951\u201353) at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, The King and I and Plain and Fancy (1956), also at Drury Lane, and Damn Yankees (1957) at the Coliseum. He came to the attention of ITV producer Chris Mercer and musical director Norman Whitehead and, after a successful appearance in the Welsh language musical TV programme Dewch i Mewn, he was cast as the singing lead of Gwlad Y Gan / Land of Song.", "Producer Chris Mercer and Music Director Norman Whitehead (who had worked in London with bandleader Jack Hylton and was known as an excellent arranger of music) settled on the idea of using a local children's choir to accompany Ivor Emmanuel in a variety of musical settings. They turned for help to Clifford Bunford, a talented tenor in his own right and a founder member of the BBC Octet (also known as the BBC Welsh Singers). Then Music Master at Cathays High School in Cardiff, Bunford was well known for his energetic work with youth and adult choirs.Clifford Bunford is the founder and President of the Cardiff Bach Choir; see http://www.cardiffbachoir.org.uk/cliffordbunford.htm  Through him, a dozen boys were selected from the Cathays school choir and the group was supplemented by schoolgirls chosen from elsewhere in Cardiff, including a handful of the best from the choir at Canton High School and a few from the Llandaff Cathedral Parish Choir. The young chorus became known as the \u2018Pontcanna Children\u2019s Choir\u2019, named after the TWW studios at Pontcanna in Cardiff where Land of Song was staged for broadcast.", "For many of the set-piece scenes, Ivor Emmanuel was accompanied by a quartet of male singers drawn from the adult chorus. Most often these were tenor Denis Griffiths, baritone Bryn Williams, and basses John Williams and Harry Price. This line-up grew into a favourite grouping that producer Chris Mercer was happy to repeat over and over again.", "Land of Song was broadcast monthly, initially for forty minutes, at 6.15pm on a Sunday evenings. Later it was extended to an hour. It opened with its signature tune, the traditional Welsh folk-melody Llwyn Onn (\u2018The Ash Grove\u2019).The surviving HTV archive footage, a single ten-minute opening sequence, preserves this. Each show had a loose theme: for example, the countryside or the seaside. A sequence of musical scenes then unfolded, requiring a whole range of costume changes. There were farmyard scenes, hunting scenes, seaside scenes, barber shop scenes, tavern scenes, scenes on board a ship and so on. The singers dressed up as fishermen, clowns, sailors, farm labourers or whatever was required. Many of the farming scenes featured live animals \u2013 horses, sheep, cows, ducks, chickens, etc. Ivor Emmanuel led the big set-pieces, and in between were scenes for other soloists, duets or quintets. The music performed encompassed the full range of the rich musical tradition of Wales, from roistering choral numbers to gentle folk ballads, from humorous songs to stirring anthems. Each programme normally ended with a Welsh hymn tune.", "The measure of the popularity of Land of Song and that of its lead singer, was underlined in 1960 by Ivor Emmanuel's appearance, along with members of the children's chorus, on the 31st Royal Variety Performance at London's Victoria Palace Theatre, the first to be televised (by ATV), being broadcast live, nationally, at 8pm on Sunday 22 May 1960. The star-studded cast which entertained HM Queen Elizabeth II and HRH Prince Philip and television viewers around the UK and abroad included Max Bygraves, Alma Cogan, Nat King Cole, Russ Conway, Billy Cotton and his Band, Sammy Davis Jr., Lonnie Donegan, Diana Dors, Charlie Drake, Jimmy Edwards, Adam Faith, Bruce Forsyth, Benny Hill, Frankie Howerd, Hattie Jacques, Teddy Johnson & Pearl Carr, Liberace, Vera Lynn, Millicent Martin, Bob Monkhouse, Cliff Richard, Anne Shelton, the Tiller Girls, Norman Wisdom, Harry Worth, and band-leader Jack Hylton. In the midst of that galaxy \u2013 something of a Who's Who of TV entertainment at the time \u2013 Ivor Emmanuel sang with a \"Welsh Children\u2019s Choir\".", "In her memoir, Recording My Life (2001), she writes of having become aware of the success of Land of Song and the show's star Ivor Emmanuel whom she recalls as \"one of the most popular singers of the day\". Wallich was particularly keen on the dimension provided by the children's choir, and she duly brought the Land of Song cast to London where recording sessions took place at the Conway Hall in Red Lion Square in Bloomsbury, a venue that Wallich and her recording engineer Allen Stagg had favoured for several earlier recordings.", "All the local Welsh singers were required to re-audition for their places in the show. Some were successful, others were not.  The show's original star, Ivor Emmanuel, who had initially walked out in sympathy with his fellow Welsh singers, returned once the MU settlement had been reached. Emmanuel was no longer featured in every subsequent edition, however. He led the Welsh language editions, as before, but in between, for shows where there was now to be less emphasis on traditional Welsh material, other entertainers (e.g. Johnny Stewart, Johnny Tudor) were brought in to lead in his place.", "Its impact was not forgotten however. On 3 March 1968, as the Wales and the West of England independent television franchise was about to pass, controversially, to Harlech Television (HTV), the final show broadcast by the outgoing TWW (All Good Things\u2026 i.e. come to an end) featured Bernard Braden, Morecambe and Wise, Clifford Evans, Anita Harris, Manfred Mann, Gwyn Thomas, Stan Stennett, Wyn Calvin, Stanley Unwin, the Pendyrus Male Voice Choir and \u2013 in homage to the nationwide success that Land of Song had brought to the company between 1958 and 1964 \u2013 Ivor Emmanuel.BFI Film & TV database: http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/20810.
