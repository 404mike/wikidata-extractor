He also founded and published Boy's Own Magazine (1855\u201390), the first and most influential boys' magazine.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Isabella Beeton", "response": ["Isabella Mary Beeton ( Mayson; 14 March 1836\u00a0\u2013 6 February 1865), known as Mrs Beeton, was an English journalist, editor and writer. Her name is particularly associated with her first book, the 1861 work Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management. She was born in London and, after schooling in Islington, north London, and Heidelberg, Germany, she married Samuel Orchart Beeton, an ambitious publisher and magazine editor.", "Around 1854 Isabella Mayson began a relationship with Samuel Orchart Beeton. His family had lived in Milk Street at the same time as the Maysons\u2014Samuel's father still ran the Dolphin Tavern there\u2014and Samuel's sisters had also attended the same Heidelberg school as Isabella. Samuel was the first British publisher of Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin in 1852 and had also released two innovative and pioneering journals: The Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine in 1852 and the Boys' Own magazine in 1855. The couple entered into extensive correspondence in 1855\u2014in which Isabella signed her letters as \"Fatty\"\u2014and they announced their engagement in June 1855. The marriage took place at St Martin's Church, Epsom, in July the following year, and was announced in The Times. Samuel was \"a discreet but firm believer in the equality of women\" and their relationship, both personal and professional, was an equal partnership. The couple went to Paris for a three-week honeymoon, after which Samuel's mother joined them in a visit to Heidelberg. They returned to Britain in August, when the newlyweds moved into 2\u00a0Chandos Villas, a large Italianate house in Pinner.", "During the particularly bitter winter of 1858\u201359 Beeton prepared her own soup that she served to the poor of Pinner, \"Soup for benevolent purposes\"; her sister later recalled that Beeton \"was busy making [the] soup for the poor, and the children used to call with their cans regularly to be refilled\". The recipe would become the only entry in her Book of Household Management that was her own. After two years of miscarriages, the couple's second son was born in June 1859; he was also named Samuel Orchart Beeton. Hughes sees the miscarriages as further evidence of Samuel's syphilis."]}, {"page": "1866 in literature", "response": ["*September 8 \u2013 London publisher Samuel Orchart Beeton is obliged by the financial panic of 1866 to settle all his debts by selling his property.

At the end of the 19th century, trapping even depleted the number of birds in London parks. In 1882, the English publisher Samuel Orchart Beeton issued a guide on the care of caged birds and included the recommendation: \"To parents and guardians plagued with a morose and sulky boy, my advice is, buy him a chaffinch.\" Competitions were held where bets were placed on which caged common chaffinch would repeat its song the greatest number of times. The birds were sometimes blinded with a hot needle in the belief that this encouraged them to sing. This practice is the subject of the poem The Blinded Bird by the English author Thomas Hardy, which contrasts the cruelty involved in blinding the birds with their zestful song. In Great Britain, the practice of keeping common chaffinches as pets declined after the trapping of wild birds was outlawed by the Wild Birds Protection Acts of 1880 to 1896."]}, {"page": "Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management", "response": ["The author, Isabella Beeton, was 21 years old when she started working on the book.
