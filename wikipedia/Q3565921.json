He also endowed the Cobbett Medal for services to chamber music. \nWalter Cobbett was born in 1847 in Blackheath, England. He became an active supporter of music, and commissioned numerous works of chamber music from emerging and leading British composers of his time, including chamber works by Benjamin Britten, Frank Bridge, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Arnold Bax, and Eugene Goossens.\nHis two-volume encyclopedia of chamber music, published in 1929, is still considered the most comprehensive work on the subject today.  His insightful, wry and occasionally caustic style makes for enlightening and delightful reading. \nAn innovative industrialist and astute businessman, Cobbett was cofounder of Scandinavia Belting Ltd (today BBA Aviation Ltd.), which manufactured a new type of woven belting for machinery.  \nBut Cobbett's heart was in music. \"It has been humorously remarked that he has given to commerce what time he could spare from music,\" said an article in a contemporary edition of Groves Dictionary of Music and Musicians. Cobbett played weekly in an amateur string quartet, was concertmaster of a number of amateur orchestras, and was a prolific writer and publicist for chamber music.\nIn 1905, Cobbett endowed a competition, under the auspices of the Worshipful Company of Musicians, for chamber music composers.  The Cobbett Competition was instrumental in advancing the careers of leading composers of the time. In this first competition Frank Bridge won a Special Prize of \u00a310 for his Phantasie String Quartet; to clarify past inaccuracies published widely about the names of the other winners of this competition, the following information is taken from the Court Minute Books of the Worshipful Company. First: William Hurlstone (\u00a350 prize). Second: Haydn Wood (\u00a310). Special Prize: Frank Bridge (\u00a310). Three Extra Prizes: James Friskin, Harry Waldo Warner and Josef Holbrooke (\u00a35.5.00) each. Other winners in later years included Benjamin Britten and Ralph Vaughan Williams. In addition to granting prizes, Cobbett commissioned works from these and other composers.\nCobbett established other prizes as well.  In 1920 he started granting annual prizes for chamber music performance for students of the Royal Academy of Music.  The Cobbett Medal for services to chamber music was established in 1924 - the first recipient was Thomas Dunhill - and continues to be awarded annually by the Worshipful Company of Musicians. He also encouraged British luthiers by granting prizes for outstanding instruments.\nCobbett started a periodical on Chamber music, called the Chamber Music Supplement.  He established a free library of chamber music and started chamber music concert series in working-class neighborhoods of British cities.\n\nCobbett's Cyclopedic Survey of Chamber Music was the result of four years of labor.  In addition to Cobbett's own extensive contributions, the two-volume survey includes articles by leading musicians and musicologists of the time, including Vincent d'Indy, Donald Tovey, Ralph Vaughan Williams and others.\nCobbett wrote of his own devotion to chamber music that \"there opened out before me an enchanted world... I became a humble devotee of this infinitely beautiful art, and so began for me the chamber music life.\"Cobbett died in London, England in 1937. His legacy is continued by the Cobbett Association, an organization devoted to rediscovering forgotten works of chamber music.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Chamber music", "response": ["Players of chamber music, both amateur and professional, attest to a unique enchantment with playing in ensemble. \"It is not an exaggeration to say that there opened out before me an enchanted world\", writes Walter Willson Cobbett, devoted amateur musician and editor of Cobbett's Cyclopedic Survey of Chamber Music.Cobbett, \"Chamber Music Life\", in ."]}, {"page": "Fantasia (music)", "response": ["Walter Willson Cobbett, in the opening decades of the 20th century, attempted to revive the fantasia style via a competition, to which works like the Phantasie trios and quartets by William Hurlstone, Armstrong Gibbs, John Ireland, Herbert Howells and Frank Bridge owe their existence, as does Benjamin Britten's Phantasy in F minor for string quintet written in 1932, the year in which he also composed a Phantasy Quartet for oboe and strings."]}, {"page": "String Quartet No. 14 (Schubert)", "response": ["But beyond these technical improvements, Schubert in these later works made the quartet medium his own. \"He had now ceased to write quartets to order, for experimental study, or for the home circle\", writes Walter Willson Cobbett. \"To the independent artist... the string quartet had now also become a vehicle for conveying to the world his inner struggles.\" For Schubert, who lived a life suspended between the lyrical, romantic, charming and the dramatic, chaotic, and depressive, the string quartet offered a medium \"to reconcile his essentially lyric themes with his feeling for dramatic utterance within a form that provided the possibility of extreme color contrasts\", writes music historian Homer Ulrich."]}, {"page": "National Gramophonic Society", "response": ["The NGS was established for the publication by subscription of classical music, recorded complete and uncut.

Cobbett had founded the Cobbett Competition in 1905 for a short form of String Quartet composition or 'Phantasy', and for other short chamber works.
