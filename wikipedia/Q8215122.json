The ODAs then advanced down to the Debecka crossroads themselves, at the edge of Debecka, ODA 392 pursued several Iraqi light mortar teams until it was engaged at long range by ZSU-57-2, whilst ODA 391 destroyed several trucks and armed technicals from Debecka with its Javelin anti-tank missiles and .50\u00a0caliber heavy machine guns.
