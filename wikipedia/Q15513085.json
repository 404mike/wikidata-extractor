Unattributed obituary in The Montrose Standard. Pinnington began his working life as a journalist in the United States and was for a number of years the editor of Scotch American. However, there is as yet no corroborating record of this part of his life, though his style of writing suggests a training in journalism. In 1881, he was living in Edinburgh and by 1891 he had settled in Montrose, living with his spinster sister, Mary Ann, while his wife and family lived with her parents in Glasgow.Census information for 1881 and 1891, It seems that his interest in art history began when he researched and published the life and work of the Montrose artist, George Paul Chalmers. Only a hundred copies of this massive tome were printed in 1896, and it is likely that Pinnington was commissioned to write and edit it. Between 1896 and 1912, he produced a formidable stream of books and articles and was an art critic for several Scottish newspapers. It appears that around 1912, the family moved to Argentina. At any rate, his wife and two elder sons are recorded as incoming passengers from Buenos Aires arriving at Liverpool on 22 October 1914.UK Incoming Passenger Lists, 1878\u20131960, available at www.ancestry.com. Pinnington himself presumably returned separately. According to his obituary, the family settled in Auchtermuchty at the family home, around 1914. Pinnington seems to have published nothing thereafter, though extracts from his unpublished biography of Sam Bough were published in The Carlisle Journal in 1922, after his death (for details see below).", "Twenty one letters and a postcard written by Pinnington to George B.

Thomas Faed established his career with the interior cottage scene of The Mitherless Bairn (1855). The attention to the detail of everyday life and sentimentality of the characters has meant that these painters have been linked with the Kailyard School of Scottish writing, criticised for producing an over-simplified version of Scottish culture and history. His The Last of the Clan (1865), which depicts highlanders left behind by emigration, is one of the few contemporary artistic depictions of the impact of the Highland Clearances. Faed was probably the starting point for the treatment of the Scottish Cottage genre by later artists Hugh Cameron (1835\u20131918), George Paul Chalmers (1833\u201378) and William McTaggart (1835\u20131910).D.

For Chalmers this can be seen in works such as the interior scene of The Legend (1864\u201367) and for Cameron in the old lady entering a cottage in A Lonely Life. For McTaggart attempts to balance figures and landscape can be seen his depiction of children on a hillside in Spring (1864).M.
