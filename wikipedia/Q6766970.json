He is now manager of non-league side Barnton.\nCame began his playing career with Middlewich Athletic and joined Nantwich Town in October 1982. He soon moved on to Winsford United, who he played for until Bolton Wanderers gave him his first Football League chance when they signed him in April 1984. Came became a regular for Wanderers over the next four years, winning promotion from Division Four in 1987\u201388. But a broken leg early in the 1988\u201389 season after a tackle by Chester City's striker Ian Benjamin ruled him out for more than a year thus ending interest in him by Arsenal, Ipswich Town and Everton. After this Came struggled to re-establish himself in the Bolton side and in December 1992 he ironically moved across the north-west to Chester.\nAlthough Came was unable to save Chester from relegation to Division Three in his first season with the club, he helped them win promotion straight back the following season. The campaign memorably saw him deputise in goal for almost the entire 90 minutes away at Scarborough when regular goalkeeper Billy Stewart suffered an injury in the warm-up. Came kept a clean sheet as Chester won 1\u20130 and he struck up a solid central defensive pairing with Colin Greenall as City sealed the runners-up spot.\nBut in July 1994 Came opted to remain in Division Three by joining Exeter City, where he won player of the season in his two years with the Grecians. This marked the end of his professional career, as he made a surprise return to Winsford. He played for Winsford until retiring through injury in December 1998, but he remained involved at the club and was appointed manager for the 1999\u20132000 season.Came was appointed manager of Cheshire side Barnton in January 2006. He remained in charge until resigning in January 2008.His son Shaun Came has played professionally for Macclesfield Town.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Spencer Whelan", "response": ["In his early years at Chester, Whelan predominantly played in the right back slot, having spells in and out of the side. It was not until regular central defenders Colin Greenall and Mark Came left in the summer of 1994 that Whelan became a regular in the centre of defence as well as captain. But he was to be ruled out between September 1994 and February 1995 with a broken leg. The season also saw Whelan finally score his first goal for the club in a League Cup tie with Lincoln City, with his first league goal arriving at Wycombe Wanderers in April 1995."]}, {"page": "1987\u201388 Bolton Wanderers F.C. season", "response": ["|Mark Came"]}, {"page": "1986 Associate Members' Cup Final", "response": ["| || ||Mark Came"]}, {"page": "Came, Mark", "response": ["#redirectMark Came"]}, {"page": "Shaun Came", "response": ["Shaun Raymond Came (born 15 June 1983) is an English former professional footballer who played as a defender in the Football League for Macclesfield Town.
