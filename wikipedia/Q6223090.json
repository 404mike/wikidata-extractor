Having been exempted from service in World War I he gained his DIC in 1917, and followed this up with an MSc in 1920 and the DSc in 1921. By this point he had joined the Research Institute in Plant Physiology at the university, and began investigating the physiology of greenhouse crops at the Cheshunt Experimental Station. While there he noticed differences in how a plant grew at different times in the year but under a constant temperature, and attempted to express this in mathematical terms using very speculative evidence; the resulting arguments made him prominent within the field."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society D, E, F", "response": ["| John Bretland Farmer||14/06/1900||5 April 1865 \u2013 26 January 1944"]}, {"page": "Bretland", "response": ["*John Bretland Farmer, British botanist"]}, {"page": "List of alumni of Magdalen College, Oxford", "response": ["* Sir John Bretland Farmer, botanist; Professor of Botany at Imperial College London"]}, {"page": "John Edmund Sharrock Moore", "response": ["In 1892 he created the biological term \u2018synapsis\u2019.
