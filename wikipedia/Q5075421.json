Working as a King's Messenger in France, he returned to England in 1812, bringing news of Napoleon\u2019s retreat from Moscow.  Instead of delivering it directly to the King, Charles delivered the news to Nathan Mayer Rothschild, who used the advance knowledge to make a killing on the Stock Exchange.\nIn return, Rothschild set Charles up in business, brokering space in The Times \u2013 the fledgling steps of one of the world's first advertising agencies. The agency continues to this day as the oldest advertising agency in the City of London. His sons followed him into the business and they covered a wide spectrum of interests. He died in 1859 and is buried in Highgate Cemetery.\nThe agency was floated in 1986 and changed its name initially to BNB Resources in 1989 and subsequently to BNB Recruitment Solutions in 2004.
