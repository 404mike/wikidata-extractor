He signed for Grimsby Town in 2001 on youth scholarship deal. He was part of the youth setup managed by former Grimsby and Middlesbrough forward Paul Wilkinson that featured the likes of Cameron Jerome. Hegarty progressed at youth level until towards the end of the 2003\u20132004 season when he was added to the first team squad soon after the sacking of manager Paul Groves. However, he would have to wait until over a year later until he would make his first team debut, coming on as a late substitute for Andy Parkinson in a 4\u20131 away victory against Kidderminster Harriers on the final away game of the 2004\u201305 season.

Hegarty was to play a number of games in the 2006\u201307 season and became more involved in the first team under the tenure of Alan Buckley and his performances would eventually see him awarded a new two-year deal in the summer of 2007. Despite featuring more often in the first team Buckley placed Hegarty on the loan list and he went on to briefly join York City on a month's loan in September 2007, however he was to suffer a muscle strain which limited him to making two appearances during this spell. In the 2008\u20132009 season, Hegarty went on to feature heavily under Mike Newell and was Newell's preferred left winger, except for a two-month period when the club succeeded in loaning Stuart Elliott from Doncaster Rovers. His performances by the end of the 08\u201309 season had generally improved and his good form drew praise from several opposition managers which coincided with the Mariners' late surge to safety. In 09\u201310 season under Neil Woods Hegarty struggled to break into the first team, and suffered from several injuries. On 12 May 2010, Hegarty was one of seven players placed on the transfer list by Woods after their relegation from the Football League."]}]}}
