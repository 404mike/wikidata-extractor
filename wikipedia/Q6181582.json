Financial circumstances worsened as the debt spiralled to \u00a330\u00a0million plus and an unpopular refinancing scheme was put in place which saw the stadium sold to the \"mysterious\" Panama-based ABC Corporation and the club paying rent of \u00a31\u00a0million a year to play there, which local journalist Gerald Mortimer described as \"an affront ... to those who put everything into building [the ground]\". The ownership trio of Sleightholme, Keith and Harding were dubbed \"The Three Amigos\" and, after came under increasing criticism from the Derby's support, in the form of two separate supporters groups, the RamsTrust and the Rams Protest Group (RPG), they eventually sold out to a group of local businessmen, dubbed \"The League of Gentlemen\" by the local press, led by former board member Peter Gadsby, in April 2006. The Gadsby-led consortium returned Pride Park to club ownership.
