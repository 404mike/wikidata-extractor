In 1851, he became the youngest ever Master Cutler, but after a dispute with his younger brother, he left the firm, which later became part of Mappin and Webb.\nMappin then bought a steelworks and implemented machine working, despite a strike by employees. In 1854, he was elected to Sheffield Town Council as a Liberal, stepping down in 1857. In the 1860s, Mappin became a director of the Sheffield Gas and Light Company, and of the Midland Railway. In 1865 Mappin moved into Thornbury, a new country house he had built in Ranmoor, now a Sheffield suburb.\nIn 1876, Mappin was re-elected to the Town Council, and served as the Mayor of Sheffield in 1877\u201378.  In 1878, he was a juror at the Paris Universal Exhibition, and was awarded the L\u00e9gion d'honneur.  At the 1880 general election, he was elected as Member of Parliament for East Retford, while remaining on Sheffield Town Council until 1883. Mappin was a major supporter of the creation of the Sheffield Central Technical School.\nUnder the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885, Mappin's Parliamentary seat was abolished, and he moved instead to represent Hallamshire, a post he held until 1905.  That year, he supported the formation of the University of Sheffield, and was created its first Pro-Chancellor.  The University's Sir Frederick Mappin Building is named after him.\nHe was appointed an honorary Freeman of the City of Sheffield in 1900.", "link_mentions": {}}}
