They also, risking injury, had five-a-side training sessions on the Old Showground concrete car park. Still though, at Scunthorpe Keegan would take his training very seriously. Twice a week, after training, Keegan would train with a teammate named Derek Hemstead and they would train by doing weighted farmers walks up and down the cantilever stand at the Old Showground. A trait Keegan had was his running ability. In running drills at Scunthorpe Keegan liked trying to finish first and Keegan was told by Jack Brownsword that one thing he has going for him is that he is a one hundred percenter and he should never lose that. Though this will to be first in his running drills would later irritate senior pros such as Liverpool's Tommy Smith and Shankly would later advise Keegan that he did not have to win all his runs.", "Scunthorpe, a club with little money, did not have a full-time driver to drive them to away games and Keegan, with other the other younger players, such as Nigel Jackson, would take turns in driving the minibus to and from away games. Young Keegan, fellow driver Nigel Jackson and fellow young professionals Jimmy Coyne, Alan Olbison and Steve Hibbotson, once borrowed coach Jack Brownsword's stop watch and had timed rallies around the Old Showground with the club's vintage tractor. On Keegan's turn the tractor crashed and the tractor's axle went through the engine. The crash was very expensive to fix and the five were given a rollicking by manager Ron Ashman. This experience gave Keegan awareness of his responsibility as a representative of Scunthorpe United. Keegan made his debut against Peterborough United at the age of 17, making 29 league starts in his first season. He became a regular in the first team by the 1969\u201370 season, playing all 46 league games for the club. This season saw the team reach the fifth-round of the FA Cup, beating Football League First Division side Sheffield Wednesday along the way. Keegan then missed only one game in his last season. Earning a pittance, meant Keegan each summer had to find summer jobs; and each summer he would do jobs such as plate-laying at the Appleby Frodingham Steelworks."]}, {"page": "Scunthorpe United F.C.", "response": ["The year 1962 proved to be a turning point in the fortunes of the club, as only two years later it finished the season at the very bottom of the Second Division, being relegated back to the now un-regionalised Football League Division Three.
