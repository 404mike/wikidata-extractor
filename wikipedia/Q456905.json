The first game with the opening is considered to be Evans\u2013McDonnell, London 1827, although in that game a slightly different move order was tried (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5 4.0-0 d6 and only now 5.b4). In 1832, the first analysis of the gambit was published in the Second Series of Progressive Lessons (1832) by William Lewis.The British chess magazine, vol. 26 (1906) page 51. The gambit became very popular shortly after that, being employed a number of times in the series of games between McDonnell and Louis de la Bourdonnais in 1834. Players such as Adolf Anderssen, Paul Morphy and Mikhail Chigorin subsequently took it up. The Evergreen game won by Adolf Anderssen against Jean Dufresne opened with the Evans Gambit. Eventually however, the second World Chess Champion Emanuel Lasker dealt a heavy blow to the opening with a modern defensive idea: returning the pawn under favourable circumstances. The opening was out of favour for much of the 20th century, although John Nunn and Jan Timman played some games with it in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and in the 1990s Garry Kasparov used it in a few of his games (notably a famous 25-move win against Viswanathan Anand in Riga, 1995), which prompted a brief revival of interest in it."]}, {"page": "Milford Haven", "response": ["Tailor and fashion designer Timothy Everest began his professional career working as a sales assistant at a branch of Hepworths in the town.Bespoke Tailor Fan Of PM's Style BBC News.
