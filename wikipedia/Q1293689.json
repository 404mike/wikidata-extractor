In 1821 Solly sold his collection of about 3000 works to the Prussian king; 677 of them formed a core of the Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, Berlin. Solly acquired a second collection during his years in London after 1821.

At this point the collection contained nearly 1200 paintings, with a core of 160 from the 17th century collection of Marchese Vincenzo Giustiniani, bought in Paris in 1815.
