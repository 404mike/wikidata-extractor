In 1821 Solly sold his collection of about 3000 works to the Prussian king; 677 of them formed a core of the Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, Berlin. Solly acquired a second collection during his years in London after 1821.  Solly is also credited for having undertaken a \nperilous journey to deliver the first news of Napoleon's defeat at the Battle of Leipzig to the English.", "link_mentions": {}}}
