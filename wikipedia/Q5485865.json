This commission arose at the suggestion of the show's star, Tate's step daughter Jose Collins, after initial previews indicated that the original score needed strengthening.  Lyrics to these songs where supplied by his regular lyricists Frank Clifford Harris and \"Valentine\" (Archibald Thomas Pechey), who were to write the lyrics of many of Tate's songs throughout his career.  \"A bachelor gay\" became one of the most popular baritone songs in the British concert repertoire. Tate subsequently wrote the score for more revues and pantomimes, including the revusical The Lads of the Village (1917), and another revue-musical, The Beauty Spot (1917), created for Regine Flory and produced by Parisian revue specialist P-L Flers at the Gaiety Theatre, London.\"James W.
