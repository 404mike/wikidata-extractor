Writing at the time of Popish Plot, Crowne, who was a devout royalist, used his adaptation to warn about the danger of allowing England to descend into another civil war, which would be the case should the Whig party rise to power. As such, the scenes of Jack Cade's rebellion, as depicted in Misery, were much more violent than in Shakespeare, with painted backdrops of people on fire and children impaled on pikes. Crowne also rewrote the roles of Gloucester and Winchester to make Gloucester more saint-like and taintless, and Winchester even more villainous. He also linked the murder of Gloucester to the recent assassination of Edmund Berry Godfrey, an incident which had led to an outbreak of anti-Catholic hysteria in London in 1678.Knowles (1999: 3) By creating this link, Crowne was aiming to enhance anti-Catholic sentiment even more and ensure the passing of the Exclusion Bill, which would prevent the Catholic James Stuart, Duke of York succeeding his brother, the Protestant Charles II. To this end, Crowne rewrote the murder scene to give more characterisation to the three murderers, who were depicted as devout, but cold-blooded Catholics.Cox (2001: 14)"]}, {"page": "Catherine of Braganza", "response": ["Owing to her devotion to the Roman Catholic faith in which she had been raised, Catherine was unpopular in England. She was a special object of attack by the inventors of the Popish Plot. In 1678 the murder of Edmund Berry Godfrey was ascribed to her servants, and Titus Oates accused her of an intention to poison the king. These charges, the absurdity of which was soon shown by cross-examination, nevertheless placed the queen for some time in great danger. On 28 November Oates accused her of high treason, and the English House of Commons passed an order for the removal of her and of all Roman Catholics from the Palace of Whitehall. Several further depositions were made against her, and in June 1679 it was decided that she should stand trial, which threat however was lifted by the king's intervention, for which she later showed him much gratitude."]}, {"page": "Titus Oates", "response": ["On 6 September 1678, Oates and Tonge approached an Anglican magistrate, Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey, and swore an affidavit before him detailing their accusations.

For a few years after the hanging, Primrose Hill was known as Greenberry Hill.

Oates claimed he had been at a Jesuit meeting held at the White Horse Tavern in the Strand, London, on April 24, 1678. According to Oates, the purpose of that meeting was to discuss the assassination of Charles II. The meeting discussed a variety of methods which included: stabbing by Irish ruffians, shooting by two Jesuit soldiers, or poisoning by the Queen's physician, Sir George Wakeman.", "The allegations gained little credence until the murder of Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey, a member of Parliament and strong supporter of Protestantism, to whom Oates had made his first depositions. His disappearance on 12 October 1678, the finding of his mutilated body on 17 October, and the subsequent failure to solve his murder sent the Protestant population into an uproar. He had been strangled and run through with his own sword. Many of his supporters blamed the murder on Catholics. As Kenyon commented, \"Next day, the 18th, James wrote to William of Orange that Godfrey's death was already 'laid against the Catholics', and even he, never the most realistic of men, feared that 'all these things happening together will cause a great flame in the Parliament.'\" The Lords asked King Charles to banish all Catholics from a radius of 20 miles (32\u00a0km) around London, which Charles granted on 30 October 1678, but it was too late because London was already in a panic, which was long remembered as \"Godfrey's autumn\".", "Image:Popish Plot Playcard3.jpg|Magistrate Edmund Berry Godfrey with Oates"]}, {"page": "Rack (torture)", "response": ["In 1679 Miles Prance, a silversmith who was being questioned about the murder of the respected magistrate Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey, was  threatened with the rack."]}, {"page": "William Bedloe", "response": ["Then in 1678, following the lead of Titus Oates, he gave an account of a supposed Popish Plot to the English government, and his version of the details of the murder of Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey was rewarded with \u00a3500.

While some government officials, like Henry Coventry, were wary of relying on the testimony of such a notorious criminal, the general view was that he was too valuable as a corroborative witness to Oates to be disregarded.Kenyon p.106 However, his testimony was usually of little value, apart from during the trial of Berry, Green and Hill for Godfrey's murder, of which he may have had some personal knowledge: as a witness he was rambling and incoherent, and had a habit of dragging in irrelevant grievances and private feuds.

Belasyse was said to have been designated Commander-in-Chief of a supposed \"Popish army\"  by the Jesuit Superior-General, Giovanni Paolo Oliva, but Charles II, according to Von Ranke, burst out laughing at the idea that this infirm old man, who could hardly stand on his feet due to gout, would be able even to hold a pistol. The informer William Bedloe, who had once worked for Belasyse (such first hand knowledge was invaluable to informers in making their lies sound more plausible), now accused him of ordering the murder of the respected magistrate  Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey, which remains unsolved to this day. It was never made clear why Belasyse, or indeed any other Catholic,  should wish to kill Godfrey, who was notably tolerant in religious matters. Belasyse in his defence referred to his age and ill-health, and reasonably pointed out that under the tolerant rule of Charles II he was living out his last years in comfort:  what possible reason had he  to wish for a change of regime?

Godfrey's death brought the hysteria to boiling point: the next  few weeks were long remembered as \"Godfrey's Autumn\".

Oates however  had evidently learnt enough about Colman  to realise  that he was vulnerable to attack, due to his intrigues with the French Court, futile though they were.
