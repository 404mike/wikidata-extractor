Born in the United States to South African parents, she was raised in Hackney, London. Her religious parents supported her singing talents by allowing her to join the church choir, which resulted in her becoming one of the lead singers for the London Community Gospel Choir.\nThis brought her to the notice of Basement Jaxx, with whom she sang lead on their single \"Oh My Gosh\". The collaboration continues to this day, and led to her supporting fellow Basement Jaxx singer Sam Sparro on his tour.\nIn 2007, she sang lead locals on BBC South's re-recording of the hymn \"Amazing Grace\", created to help mark the 200 years since the passing of the Abolition of the Slave Trade Act. In 2008, Malinga began developing her own music under her own record label, DivaGeek Records, releasing her first single \"Wondering Why\" in October.\nIn 2009, she sang support vocals for Dizzee Rascal on his 2009 album Tongue N' Cheek, and has supported him on live appearances, including Live Lounge, Later... with Jools Holland and the 2009 BBC Electric Proms.\n\"Better Days\", the title song of Incognito's 2016 album In Search of Better Days, features Malinga as lead singer.\nIn 2019, she collaborated as featured artist with English DJ Riton and Dutch producer Oliver Heldens on the song \"Turn Me On\", which interpolates \"Doctor Love\" by First Choice and \"Don't Go\" by Yazoo.Vula performed live at Trevor Nelson's Soul Christmas at the Royal Albert Hall in 2019.She is currently performing with The Horne Section on BBC's Crouchy's Year Late Euros.Vula was a backing singer for Paul Weller when he performed with the BBC Symphony Orchestra at The Barbican on 15 May 2021", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tomoyasu Hotei", "response": ["During a brief trip back to Japan, Hotei played four sold-out shows at the Blue Note Tokyo in late August, and also performed at a private party for the launch of the new Lamborghini Hurac\u00e1n automobile. Hotei wrote and performed the theme song, \"Trick Attack (Theme of Lupin The Third)\", to the 2014 live-action film adaptation of the Lupin III manga. After spending much of the year writing and recording with a variety of collaborators, the album New Beginnings was released in Japan on October 1, 2014, the title a reflection of the new chapter in Hotei's career, after relocating to London. Iggy Pop contributed lyrics and vocals to two tracks on the album and Vula Malinga vocals to one."]}, {"page": "The Singles (Basement Jaxx album)", "response": ["While performing onstage, Scottish musician Bobby Gillespie called the band \"Cocksuckers \u2013 no offence to cocksuckers,\" before slating everyone from Minogue to the crowd itself and eventually getting booed off stage. Basement Jaxx's vocalist Vula Malinga recalls: \"I remember us girls were like 'WHAT? Shut Up! Come on let's take him! Warrrgh', but the guys were just like 'Everyone's entitled to their opinion.' In the end I think the crowd spoke for itself.\""]}, {"page": "Crazy Itch Radio", "response": ["Compared with traditional songwriting, the band approach to creating music might appear to work backward. For example, on \"Hush Boy\", they created the song's melody with vocalist Vula Malinga over a basic track. Once it was recorded, they kept only Vula's vocal and rebuilt all the music under her voice from scratch. The band says this approach allows for a tremendous amount of freedom to explore different sounds.", "Resident Advisor More successful was Basement Jaxx's 'Crazy Itch Radio'. Unlike 'Kish Kash' from 2003, a rather ho-hum effort handicapped by letting N\u2019Sync's JC Chasez near the mic, this year's 'Crazy Itch Radio' was easily the duo's best, mostly due to an inspired roster of vocalists: R&B songstress Vula Malinga, Swedish superstar Robyn, and second lady of grime Lady Marga. The production was also as diverse as ever, expertly layering influences plucked from all over the world. In 2006 the Jaxx are superstar DJs, touring with Robbie Williams for Christ's sake, but they've certainly earned their stripes. Ten years on, they're sharp as tacks. Freestylers and Greatest Hits merchants take note: if you don't keep reinventing your sound, your window of relevance gets slimmer and slimmer with every passing year. \u2013 Dave Rinehart"]}, {"page": "Oh My Gosh (Basement Jaxx song)", "response": ["\"Oh My Gosh\" is a song by British electronic music duo Basement Jaxx.
