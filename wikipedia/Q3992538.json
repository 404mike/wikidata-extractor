Tom Turner has suggested that the latter resulted from a favourable account of his talent in Marie-Luise Gothein's History of Garden Art which predated Christopher Hussey's positive account of Brown in The Picturesque (1927).

He was inspired by the pattern language technique of architect Christopher Alexander. A pattern language is an organized and coherent set of \"patterns\", each of which describes a problem and the core of a solution that can be used in many ways within a specific field of expertise. Turner concluded there are seven types, or 'patterns', of greenway which he named: ", "*paveway: an upgraded pavement or sidewalk: \"Well-designed paveways, with appropriate planting and street furniture, should be formed along main pedestrian desire lines\".Tom Turner, \"Greenways, blueways, skyways and other ways to a better London\".

Here, he suggested that 'a language of \"landscape urbanism\" barely exists and needs articulating', and that 'existing urbanisms ... are limited in the exploration of the landscape'. He also used the term 'landscape as urbanism' in his 1994 essay, '101 Ideas About Big Parks'.Kerb: Journal of Landscape Architecture, no 1, Melbourne: RMIT University Press, 1995. In 1996 Tom Turner wrote that The city of the future will be an infinite series of landscapes: psychological and physical, urban and rural, flowing apart and together. They will be mapped and planned for special purposes, with the results recorded in geographical information systems (GIS), which have the power to construct and retrieve innumerable plans, images and other records. Christopher Alexander was right: a city is not a tree. It is a landscape.Turner, Tom, City as landscape, London E&FN Spon, 1996 p.vIn the late 1990s, concepts of 'landscape urbanism' were often used by landscape architects in the United States in the reorganization of declining post-industrial cities, such as Detroit. From the 2000s, it was used in Europe by architects to mean a highly flexible way of integrating large-scale infrastructure, housing and open space. By the late 2000s, the phrase became associated with highly commercialized, multi-phase urban parks, such as Olympic park design. Landscape urbanism strategies in the U.S. are now widely used in waterfront redevelopment, recapturing urban vacancy, urban agriculture, and green infrastructure.
