After a shaky start to his West Ham career he was dropped, later regaining his place at the beginning of December. On 14 January 1914, Lonsdale was reported missing. After he turned up, the board of directors fined him a week's wages and he was demoted to the reserve side. Lonsdale did not regain his first-team place until the end of February 1914, and that summer he was sold to Southend United, having kept goal for the \"Hammers\" in 21 Southern League games in 1913\u201314. During World War I he also served in the Football Battalion. From Southend he moved to Stalybridge Celtic and then joined Port Vale in June 1923.
