RAI, F.R.A.S (1854\u20131938) was a Scottish explorer, Professor of Tibetan, Professor of Chemistry and Pathology, Indian Army surgeon, collector in Tibet, and amateur archaeologist. Waddell also studied Sumerian and Sanskrit; he made various translations of seals and other inscriptions. His reputation as an Assyriologist gained little to no academic recognition and his books on the history of civilization have caused controversy. Some of his book publications however were popular with the public, and he is regarded by some today to have been a real-life precursor of the fictional character Indiana Jones.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Kangchenjunga", "response": ["* Laurence Waddell 1899.

Kollmann, of Basel, in his Pygmden in Europa (1894), argues for the existence of a European pygmy race in Neolithic times A notable proponent of the theory who had read MacRitchie's earlier works published in the Celtic Review was Grant Allen, who became convinced that fairies were modelled on an indigenous population of Britain, specifically the Neolithic long barrow makers.Macculloch, 1932, p. 362.\"Who were the Fairies\", Cornhill Magazine, 1881, xliii. 338f. The archaeologist William Boyd Dawkins found MacRitchie's views also appealing, since in his Early Man in Britain and His Place in the Tertiary Period (1880) he considered Upper Paleolithic culture across Europe (including Britain) to have been founded by a proto-Eskimo or Lapp race, a view at the time which was popularised after the discovery of \"Chancelade Man\", in southwestern France by Leo Testut in 1889.\"The Arrival of Man in Britain in the Pleistocene Age\", W. Boyd Dawkins, The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, Vol. 40, Jul. \u2013 Dec. 1910, pp. 233\u2013263.Recherches anthropologiques sur le Squelette quaternaire de Chancelade, Bull. Soc. d'Anthrop. de Lyon, 1889. Scientific consensus after the 1930s, however, agreed that the remains of \"Chancelade Man\" were Cro-Magnon. Within folklore, MacRitchie's euhemeristic view of fairies developed a racialist school which considered that the fairies and other beings such as elves and goblins of British myth represented primitive pre-Aryans, a view proposed most notably by John S. Stuart Glennie, Laurence Waddell and Alfred Cort Haddon.Phoenician Origin of the Britons, Scots, and Anglo-Saxons (1924, 2nd ed. 1925), in this work Waddell cites MacRitchie.Silver, 1986, p. 150.Folk Memory Or the Continuity of British Archaeology by Walter Johnson (1908) is another work in this vein. According to Haddon: \"fairy tales were stories told by men of the Iron Age of events which happened to men of the Bronze Age in their conflicts with men of the Neolithic Age\".Quoted in \"Fairies in nineteenth-century art and literature\", Nicola Bown, Cambridge University Press, 2001, p. 166.

VIII makes mention of this well, which was also known as \"fiery well\" or \"hell on earth\".
