He created goals for others, scored a couple himself, and became increasingly influential as manager Neil Warnock set up the team to play in a style that suited his strengths. Crystal Palace entered administration during the January 2010 transfer window, and the consequent ten-point deduction left the team in danger of relegation. The administrators accepted a bid from Southampton for Danns, but the player rejected the move. Warnock challenged him to \"step up and take on the goalscoring duties\" from the departed Victor Moses, and he complied, with both goals in a 2\u20130 win over Peterborough United, a late winner against Scunthorpe United, and two more goals later in the season that took his league tally to eight. However, in the penultimate match of the season, a 1\u20131 draw with West Bromwich Albion, Danns was sent off for headbutting Graham Dorrans, so was suspended for the visit to Sheffield Wednesday from which Palace needed a point to survive at their hosts' expense. The match was drawn, so Wednesday were relegated. Danns was nominated for Palace's Player of the Year awardaccording to the citation, \"his work rate and skill were major reasons Palace stayed up\"but lost out to goalkeeper Juli\u00e1n Speroni."]}, {"page": "Robert Snodgrass", "response": ["Born in Glasgow, Snodgrass grew up in the city's Gallowgate area; he played boys' club football for a team affiliated with Rangers alongside future international teammate James McArthur who is a month younger and lived a few blocks away.
