After arriving at Kidderminster, he made \"a mammoth impact\". He made his debut in a 2\u20131 defeat to Stevenage Borough, and manager Mark Yates praised him, saying \"I thought James was excellent, bar taking the couple of chances that fell his way he can be well pleased with himself.\" He scored his first goal in the following match, a 3\u20131 victory over Gravesend & Northfleet, with a \"clinical finish\" from a Michael Blackwood cross. He scored two goals against Stafford Rangers after he \"coolly slotted home\" and scored with \"ease into the bottom-right corner\", which gave Kidderminster a 2\u20131 victory on 26 December 2006. His hat-trick in a 4\u20130 victory against Vauxhall Motors in the first round of the FA Trophy in January 2007 was the first for a Kidderminster player since Bo Henriksen in 2003. After impressing during the loan, he moved to the club permanently on 31 January 2007 on a two-and-a-half-year contract for an undisclosed fee. He scored Kidderminster's equaliser in a 1\u20131 draw against St Albans City on 24 March 2007, before being sent off for a \"wild\" challenge on Ahmed Deen. In the 2007 FA Trophy Final, Constable scored the first and second goals for an English club at the new Wembley Stadium, although his efforts were in vain as Kidderminster lost 3\u20132 to Stevenage Borough. He finished the season as Kidderminster's top scorer with 16 goals in 32 appearances."]}, {"page": "1999\u20132000 Aston Villa F.C. season", "response": ["|N/A|| MF|| Michael Blackwood || Wrexham || Free || 29 June 2000"]}, {"page": "2007 FA Trophy Final", "response": ["Kidderminster Harriers entered the 2006\u201307 FA Trophy at the First round stage, being drawn against Conference North side Vauxhall Motors. The game was played on 16 December 2006, finishing in a 4\u20134 draw at Aggborough. Kidderminster had raced into a three-goal lead, all three goals coming in the opening thirty minutes of the match, from James Constable, Alex Russell, and Iyseden Christie respectively. However, Vauxhall were level ten minutes into the second-half, scoring three quick-fire goals of their own. The home side then took the advantage once again through substitute Luke Reynolds. With Kidderminster defending their one-goal lead, Vauxhall's Lee Furlong scored an injury-time goal with a \"thunderous drive\" to ensure the game went to a replay. The replay, scheduled for 19 December, was postponed due to a frozen pitch. It was eventually played on 6 January 2007, with Kidderminster winning the game 4\u20130, with James Constable getting a hat-trick in the game. A 1\u20130 victory away at fellow Conference National side Exeter City followed in the Second Round a week later, with a first-half Iyseden Christie strike settling the match. The win meant that Kidderminster faced a home tie against Conference South side Braintree Town in the Third Round, drawing the game 0\u20130. Kidderminster won the replay 3\u20131. Despite having trailed to a first-half strike from Russ Edwards, Kidderminster hit back with three goals in four minutes to win the tie and progress to the Fourth Round. They secured a place in the semi-finals thanks to a 3\u20131 victory over Halifax Town on 24 February. Similarly to the victory at Braintree, Kidderminster had trailed at half-time courtesy of a late first-half goal \u2013 this time Halifax's Neal Trotman heading past the outstretched Scott Bevan. Kidderminster bounced back immediately in the second-half, with James Constable scoring his sixth goal of the tournament when he tapped in from close range after Michael Blackwood's initial shot had been saved. Goals from Gavin Hurren, and an injury-time strike from Russell Penn ensured a two-goal victory.", "|LM ||11 || Michael Blackwood"]}, {"page": "Cross-border derby", "response": ["|Michael Blackwood||1999||9||2||2000\u201302||46||2"]}, {"page": "2001\u201302 Wrexham F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|20||align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Michael Blackwood"]}, {"page": "Michael Blackwood", "response": ["Michael Blackwood may refer to:", "* Michael Blackwood (filmmaker) (born 1934), American filmmaker", "* Michael Blackwood (footballer) (born 1979), English footballer ", "* Michael Blackwood (sprinter) (born 1976), Jamaican track and field athlete"]}, {"page": "1999\u20132000 Chester City F.C. season", "response": ["||| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Michael Blackwood"]}]}}
