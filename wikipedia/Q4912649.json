He had a spell playing non-league football at Colne before signing for Bradford City in 1913, remaining with the side up until the outbreak of the First World War. At the end of the war in 1919 he joined Cardiff City and played in their first ever season in the Football League during the 1920\u201321 season.He scored one of Cardiff's goals on the day of their first ever Football League victory, a 3\u20130 win over Stockport County on 4 September 1920. Following the arrival of Jimmy Gill in 1920 he was moved to outside right and was a virtual ever present for the next three years before losing his place to Denis Lawson.He was sold to Sunderland, making 70 appearances for the club before retiring and becoming a licensee in Bradford.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Grimshaw", "response": ["* Billy Grimshaw (1892-1968), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Sidney Evans (footballer)", "response": ["After being spotted playing amateur football, Evans was brought to Cardiff City by then manager Fred Stewart in the club's first season in The Football League, making his debut in a 1\u20130 defeat to Leeds United.

Having helped the club to win promotion to the First Division in 1921, he struggled to make an impact on the side in his second year due to the performances of Billy Grimshaw and left the club in May 1923, signing for Second Division side Manchester United. There he played as back-up to Joe Spence, but he did not make his debut until April 1924, playing in the last six matches of the 1923\u201324 season, as the forward line was shuffled to cover the absent James Miller. His only two goals came in the 2\u20132 draw at home to Clapton Orient on 21 April 1924.

Back-to-back fixtures against Manchester City yielded consecutive 1\u20131 draws. In the first tie, Cardiff were deemed lucky to have gained a point with The Times stating, \"the balance of play was all against them\". Billy Grimshaw had given Cardiff the lead with a \"speculative\" long shot with Manchester City equalising in the final 15 minutes. In the second tie, Scottish forward Denis Lawson made his debut having signed from St Mirren although he was described as not playing \"a very distinguished game\". The arrival of Lawson ultimately led to the departure of Grimshaw after the club received an offer of \u00a34,000 from fellow First Division side Sunderland.

The first home victory at the ground came in the team's following match, when they recorded a 3\u20130 win over Stockport in the reverse fixture, a week after their first meeting. At the time, the Football League used Charles Sutcliffe's fixture system that paired club's home and away matches against the same side on consecutive weekends or in close proximity wherever possible.
