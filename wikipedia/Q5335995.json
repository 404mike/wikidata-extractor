In June 1920, he signed as an amateur for Nelson, who at the time played in the Central League. Eastwood became a regular fixture in the club's reserve team, helping them to the North East Lancashire Combination title in 1921. He made his Football League Third Division North debut for Nelson on 1 October 1921 in the 1\u20131 draw with Darlington at Seedhill. Eastwood played every reserve team match in the 1921\u201322 season and was rewarded with a professional contract in May 1922. His second League appearance for Nelson came on 2 April 1923 in the 1\u20132 loss away at Wrexham. Eastwood played his final competitive match for the club in the 3\u20130 win at home to Walsall on 28 April 1923, after the team's Third Division North championship had already been confirmed.\nEastwood transferred to Morecambe in July 1923 and enjoyed a regular first-team berth at Christie Park over the following five seasons. In the 1926\u201327 season Eastwood, along with fellow former Nelson defender Harry Clayton, was part of the Morecambe side that finished third in the Lancashire Combination, won the Combination Cup for the first time, and also won the Lancashire Junior Cup. Eastwood missed a large portion of the 1928\u201329 campaign through injury, and left the club in the summer of 1929 to join Clitheroe. After one season with Clitheroe, he had spells with Rossendale United, Darwen and Heywood St James before retiring in the mid-1930s. Eastwood continued to live in Lancashire until his death in Burnley on 15 July 1981, aged 79.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1921\u201322 Nelson F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Eddie Eastwood"]}, {"page": "1922\u201323 Nelson F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Eddie Eastwood"]}, {"page": "Harry Clayton (footballer)", "response": ["In the summer of 1926, Clayton returned to the Lancashire Combination with Morecambe, where he played alongside fellow former Nelson defender Eddie Eastwood. He played 45 league and cup matches in his first season with Morecambe, as the team finished third in the division and won the Combination Cup and the Lancashire Junior Cup. Two more seasons with Morecambe followed, before a transfer to Manchester Central in June 1929. In early 1931, Clayton had a short spell with Central FC (Belle Vue), and later played for Bacup Borough. He subsequently returned to his hometown and represented several factory teams, including James Clark Ltd. and Lustrafil, during the remainder of the 1930s."]}]}}
