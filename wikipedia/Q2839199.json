However, German forces refused to relinquish their control of the city, which had been converted into a fortress. To seize the now strategically insignificant town would consume too many Allied resources which were needed elsewhere. The town was by-passed masking the German garrison with Allied troops, notably 1st Czechoslovak Armoured Brigade. During the German occupation, Dunkirk was largely destroyed by Allied bombing. The artillery siege of Dunkirk was directed on the final day of the war by pilots from No. 652 Squadron RAF, and No. 665 Squadron RCAF. The fortress, under the command of German Admiral Friedrich Frisius, eventually unconditionally surrendered to the commander of the Czechoslovak forces, Brigade General Alois Li\u0161ka, on 9 May 1945.

The siege lasted until after the official end of the war in Europe. German units within the fortress withstood probing attacks and as the opening of the port of Antwerp was more important, the 21st Army Group commander, Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, decided to contain but not capture Dunkirk with the 1st Czechoslovak Armoured Brigade.

The Czechs executed frequent raids into the eastern suburbs for nuisance effect and to take prisoners; an attack on 28 October (Czechoslovak independence day) lifted 300 prisoners. There was a flurry of attacks and retaliatory counter-attacks, mostly on the eastern perimeter in November 1944. Conditions on both sides were difficult in the winter. The low-lying ground outside the city had been flooded to form part of the defences and adjacent land easily became water-logged, hampering movement and making life unpleasant. Canadian gunners reported that gun-pits needed to be bailed out, the sides of dugouts collapsed and transport became mired. Czechoslovak morale was maintained by leave in nearby towns and in Lille. The defenders were stuck with poor food, deficient health care and harsh discipline."]}, {"page": "Mal\u00e1 Sk\u00e1la", "response": ["*Alois Li\u0161ka (1895\u20131977), army officer"]}, {"page": "Alois Liska", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alois Li\u0161ka"]}, {"page": "Li\u0161ka", "response": ["* Alois Li\u0161ka (1895\u20131977), Czech army officer who served in both World Wars"]}, {"page": "Milan Rastislav Stefanik Order", "response": ["* Army General Alois Li\u0161ka - Third Class, 1991"]}, {"page": "Karel Janou\u0161ek", "response": ["In February 1948 the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia seized power.
