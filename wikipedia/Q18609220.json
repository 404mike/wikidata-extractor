In it she told the story of a night she and her brother Brian Phillpotts (\"Broo\") had spent at the home of \u00deorvaldur Bjarnason, Dean of Melsta\u00f0ir, in 1904. The story, later retold from memory by Marion Delf-Smith, one of Bertha's colleagues at Westfield College in London, concerned a stay in a remote house with the Dean, who provided them with a spartan meal of hard dried fish, sour milk, and ship's biscuits too hard to eat; the bed was infested with vermin; and she was visited in her bedroom by a pony which gave her a kick on the leg. Since the same meal was provided the following day, they escaped and made the lengthy journey to the nearest farmhouse in the hope of getting some food and sleep."]}, {"page": "Marion Delf", "response": ["#REDIRECT Marion Delf-Smith"]}, {"page": "Ellen Marion Delf", "response": ["#REDIRECT Marion Delf-Smith"]}, {"page": "Ellen Marion Delf-Smith", "response": ["#REDIRECT Marion Delf-Smith"]}, {"page": "Delf", "response": ["*Marion Delf-Smith (1883-1980), British botanist whose author abbreviation is \"Delf\""]}, {"page": "List of women botanists", "response": ["| Marion Delf-Smith"]}, {"page": "Ellen Delf Smith", "response": ["#REDIRECT Marion Delf-Smith"]}]}}
