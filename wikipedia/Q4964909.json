In 1932, a Mayo IRA officer reported that Maguire, now firmly aligned with Sinn F\u00e9in, refused to call on men to join the IRA when speaking at republican commemorations.

The IRA, Cumann na mBan and the Fianna were once again outlawed in June of that year. In 1938 an advisory body of prominent republicans was set up to help re-organize the fledgling organization; included were George Plunkett, Brian O'Higgins, Mary MacSwiney and Madge Daly. The following year, Joe Atkinson of Belfast was appointed as a national organiser and travelled about the country on a bicycle, contacting failed Fianna sluaithe and creating new ones. Later that year he was appointed Adjutant General and Liam Nolan of Kerry became National Organiser. George Plunkett resigned as Chief Scout for health reasons. In 1940, 150 Fianna marched in Dublin on the eve of the executions of two republicans responsible for a fatal bombing in Coventry, Barnes and McCormack in Britain. Fianna in Dublin were under the control of Jack Rowan, Kevin Hudson and Mattie O'Neill. Four sluaithe were reported active in Dublin and although the use of Hardwicke Hall was lost, newly released internees helped in the re-organization, including Wattie Bell, Noel and Des Goulding, Paddy Dillon and Mattie Carey."]}, {"page": "Ceann Comhairle", "response": ["|Brian O'Higgins"]}, {"page": "Second D\u00e1il", "response": ["In 1925 an [anti-Treaty] IRA convention withdrew its allegiance from the republican government to its own Army Council. Second D\u00e1il TDs had taken an oath of fidelity to the Irish Republic, and Sinn F\u00e9in regarded those who implicitly or explicitly endorsed the Treaty or Free State constitution as having violated this oath and thereby vacated their seats. In 1926 de Valera founded Fianna F\u00e1il to take a more pragmatic opposition than Sinn F\u00e9in to the Free State, and the following year the party abandoned abstentionism by entering the Free State D\u00e1il. Fianna F\u00e1il TD Se\u00e1n Lemass famously described it in March 1928 as \"a slightly constitutional party\". De Valera came to power in 1932 and in 1937 proposed a new Constitution which was adopted by plebiscite, removing to his own satisfaction any remaining reservations about the state's legitimacy. In December 1938, seven of those elected in 1921 who continued to regard the Second D\u00e1il as the last legitimate D\u00e1il assembly, and that all other surviving members had disqualified themselves by taking the oath of allegiance, gathered at a meeting with the IRA Army Council under Se\u00e1n Russell, and signed over what they believed was the authority of the Government of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann to the Army Council until such a time as a new D\u00e1il could once again be democratically elected by all the people of Ireland in all 32 counties.The seven were John J. O'Kelly, George Noble Plunkett, William Stockley, Mary MacSwiney, Brian O'Higgins, Tom Maguire and Cathal \u00d3 Murchadha. Henceforth, the IRA Army Council perceived itself to be the legitimate government of the Irish Republic. Official Sinn F\u00e9in in 1969\u201370 and Provisional Sinn F\u00e9in in 1986 abandoned abstentionism and began a gradual  recognition of the legitimacy of the modern Irish state; the smaller Republican Sinn F\u00e9in retains the view that the Second D\u00e1il was the last legitimate Irish legislature."]}, {"page": "List of Irish ballads", "response": ["*\"Who Is Ireland's Enemy?\" - written by Brian O'Higgins in response to the First World War, this poem was one of the more visceral of the anti-recruitment literary response.", "*\"Soldiers of '22\" - written by Brian O'Higgins commemorating the Republican soldiers during the Irish Civil War", "*\"England's Gallows Tree\" - written by Brian O'Higgins about Peter Barnes and James McCormack who were hanged in 1940 during the IRA S-Plan"]}, {"page": "1963 in Ireland", "response": ["* 3 March \u2013 Brian O'Higgins, Sinn F\u00e9in party Member of Parliament and party president (born 1882)."]}, {"page": "Cyprian Brady", "response": ["At the 2007 general election, held under Ireland's single transferable vote system, Brady polled just 939 first preference votes (2.7%) in the first count.
