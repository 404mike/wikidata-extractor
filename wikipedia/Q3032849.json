Cottam's decision to awaken Captain Arthur Henry Rostron and relay Titanic's message in spite of the scepticism of the officer on watch allowed Carpathia to arrive at the scene hours before any other ship and is \"credited with saving hundreds of lives.\" He was a personal friend of the Titanic's junior wireless operator and survivor Harold Bride.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Harold Bride", "response": ["After the Titanic struck an iceberg at 11:40 pm 14 April 1912, Bride and his senior colleague Jack Phillips were responsible for relaying CQD messages (later SOS at Captain Edward Smith's urging) to ships in the vicinity, which led to the survivors being picked up by the RMS Carpathia. The men remained at their posts until the ship's power was almost completely out. Bride was washed off the ship as the boat deck flooded, but managed to scramble onto the upturned lifeboat Collapsible 'B', and was rescued by the Carpathia later in the morning. Despite being injured, he helped Harold Cottam, the Carpathia's wireless operator and a personal friend of his, transmit survivor lists and personal messages from the ship.", "On the Carpathia, the seriously injured Bride rested, and later helped the Carpathia's wireless operator, Harold Cottam, send out the large number of personal messages from the survivors.  According to Encyclopedia Titanica: \"Incidentally, Bride and Cottam had met before the disaster and were good friends. After the tragedy they stayed in contact for many years.\"\"Mr. Harold Sydney McBride.\" Encyclopedia Titanica.  Retrieved 2010, 10 July.", "In the American Inquiry, Bride was also questioned about ignoring requests for information, while on the Carpathia, from the press and the U.S. Navy, which wanted to know the fate of President Taft's personal friend and aide, Archibald Butt. Bride stated that priority was given to personal messages and survivor lists over answering questions from the press and claimed that the Navy did not understand British Morse signals, which the Navy denied. The Marconi Company was accused of secretly setting up the New York Times interview with Bride and telling him and Harold Cottam to keep quiet until they arrived in New York, but Marconi denied the accusations. This matter was not pursued, and Bride was considered one of the heroes of the disaster."]}, {"page": "S.O.S.

He thought he would be helpful, and at 12:11\u00a0a.m. on the night of the 15th of April, sent a message to the Titanic, stating that Cape Cod had traffic for them. In reply he received the Titanics distress signal, stating that they had struck an iceberg and were in need of immediate and urgent assistance.", "Cottam took the message and coordinates to the bridge, where the officers on watch were initially sceptical about the seriousness of the Titanics distress call. Agitated, Cottam rushed down the ladder to the Captain's cabin and awakened Captain Arthur Henry Rostron, who immediately sprang into action and gave the order to turn the ship around, and then asked Harold Cottam if he was absolutely certain it was a distress signal from the Titanic. Cottam said that he had indeed received a distress signal from the Titanic, which required immediate assistance, and Cottam gave the Titanic position, saying that he was absolutely certain of the seriousness of the message.  Whilst dressing, Rostron set a course for the Titanic, and sent for the chief engineer and told him to  \"call another watch of stokers and make all possible speed to the Titanic, as she was in trouble.\"  Rostron later testified that the distance to the Titanic was , and it took the Carpathia  three and a half hours to arrive at the Titanic location, by which time she had already sunk."]}, {"page": "United States Senate inquiry into the sinking of the Titanic", "response": ["Surviving officials, crew and passengers who were questioned or provided evidence included J.

He signed his employment contract on 19 March 1912. His first voyage on board the ship was the Rijeka-New York-Rijeka line. Carpathia sailed into New York on 29 March and returned to Rijeka twelve days later with 725 people on board. Passengers included both Hungarians returning to their homeland or visiting, and wealthy Americans, mainly in first class, on European excursions. Carpathia's voyage to Rijeka was uneventful until the early hours of 15 April 1912. At 0.25 a.m., however, Carpathia radio operator Harold Cottam picked up a distress call from the RMS Titanic, which had struck an iceberg and was then 58 nautical miles (93;km) from Carpathia. Captain Arthur Rostron immediately gave the order for the ship to change course and set sail to rescue the Titanic's passengers. Captain Rostron decided that the survivors should be hoisted aboard the ship through the between-deck entrance nearest the waterline. The captain put \u00c1rp\u00e1d Lengyel in charge of the rescue, as he was the only one of the three doctors with experience as a paramedic. All the survivors were in a state of shock, unable to grip the rope ladders lowered from the hatchway with their frozen, numb hands. One by one, the survivors were pulled up to the hold with the help of pulleys. Lengyel met the survivors at the entrance to the hold and performed a quick initial diagnosis, on the basis of which the men were escorted to the prepared first aid stations, so he met all the 710 survivors. In his memoirs, \u00c1rp\u00e1d Lengyel wrote: \"We could hardly cope with all the work and consolation. It was horrible to see all these people, women screaming for their husbands and children who were lost before their eyes, and here and there lonely children who had lost their parents. We comforted the poor with sobbing hearts... It was a very sad journey back (to New York), with only weeping and wailing everywhere...\""]}]}}
