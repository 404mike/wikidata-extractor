Cottam's decision to awaken Captain Arthur Henry Rostron and relay Titanic's message in spite of the scepticism of the officer on watch allowed Carpathia to arrive at the scene hours before any other ship and is \"credited with saving hundreds of lives.\" He was a personal friend of the Titanic's junior wireless operator and survivor Harold Bride.", "link_mentions": {}}}
