After a successful international solo career, Dennis later achieved great success as a writer of pop songs, scoring eight UK number ones and winning six Ivor Novello Awards. Notably, she co-wrote \"Can't Get You Out of My Head\" (recorded by Kylie Minogue), the Britney Spears song \"Toxic\", and Katy Perry's hit \"I Kissed a Girl\". \nIn 2004, Dennis was listed 66th in the Q Magazine list of the top 100 most influential people in music and in 2006, she won the UK music industry's Woman of the Year Award.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Kylie Minogue", "response": ["In November 2007, Minogue released her tenth and much-discussed \"comeback\" album, X. The electro-styled album included contributions from Guy Chambers, Cathy Dennis, Bloodshy & Avant and Calvin Harris. The album received some criticism for the triviality of its subject matter in light of Minogue's experiences with breast cancer. X and its lead single, \"2 Hearts\", entered at number one on the Australian albums and singles charts, respectively. In the United Kingdom, X initially attracted lukewarm sales, although its commercial performance eventually improved. Follow-up singles from the album, \"In My Arms\" and \"Wow\", both peaked inside the top ten of the UK Singles Chart. In the US, the album was nominated at the 2009 Grammy Awards for Best Electronic/Dance Album.", "Minogue explained that she first became interested in pop music during her adolescence: \"I first got into pop music in 1981, I'd say. It was all about Prince, Adam + the Ants, that whole New Romantic period. Prior to that, it was the Jackson 5, Donna Summer, and my dad's records \u2013 the Stones and Beatles.\" She would also listen to the records of Olivia Newton-John and ABBA. Minogue said that she \"wanted to be\" Newton-John while growing up. Her producer, Pete Waterman, recalled Minogue during the early years of her music career with the observation: \"She was setting her sights on becoming the new Prince or Madonna\u00a0... What I found amazing was that she was outselling Madonna four to one, but still wanted to be her.\" Minogue came to prominence in the music scene as a bubblegum pop singer and was deemed a \"product of the Stock, Aitken & Waterman Hit Factory\". Musician Nick Cave, who worked with Minogue in some occasions, was a major influence on her artistic development. She told The Guardian: \"He's definitely infiltrated my life in beautiful and profound ways.\" Throughout her career, Minogue's work was also influenced by Cathy Dennis, D Mob, Scritti Politti, Bj\u00f6rk, Tricky, U2 and Pizzicato Five, among others."]}, {"page": "March 25", "response": ["*  1969   \u2013 Cathy Dennis, English singer-songwriter, record producer and actress"]}, {"page": "1969", "response": ["** Cathy Dennis, British musician"]}, {"page": "1968", "response": ["* March 25 \u2013 Cathy Dennis, British singer-songwriter, record producer and actress"]}, {"page": "Norfolk", "response": ["* Cathy Dennis, singer and songwriter, from Norwich"]}, {"page": "Ray Davies", "response": ["|Cathy Dennis"]}, {"page": "Band Aid (band)", "response": ["*Cathy Dennis"]}, {"page": "S Club 7", "response": ["Over the course of the year, the group enjoyed more success in the charts after their second single, \"S Club Party\", entered the UK charts at number-two and went straight to number-one in New Zealand.

Following the success of their television show and released singles, the group released their debut album S Club in October 1999.

It introduced the song \"Reach\", another retro-styled uptempo track, which was co-written by Cathy Dennis and aired as the main theme tune to the second series. \"Reach\" was released as a single in May 2000 and reached number-two in the UK charts. It arguably became one of the group's most successful singles, paving the way for the group's second album, 7 which was released on 12 June 2000. This album was a departure from the overtly pop stylings of S Club, with tracks styled more towards R&B than the traditional nineties pop sound of their debut album. It reached number-one in the UK charts becoming certified Triple Platinum, and a certified Gold record in the US. The second single from the album, \"Natural\", featured Stevens as lead vocalist.

As a result, S Club 7 were invited back and asked to record a second consecutive Children in Need single, in November 2001. It was decided that \"Have You Ever\", a song co-written by Chris Braide and Cathy Dennis, was to be released for the charity campaign. After the success of the previous year's single, the performance on the night featured many primary school children who had pre-recorded their own versions of the chorus, including the S Club Juniors who they made their first television appearance. The band felt \"overjoyed\" that they could, once again, contribute to the Children in Need campaign, feeling that it meant a lot to them to be involved and feeling privileged to be able to help; they also commented that it was nice for British school children to be involved in raising money for charity.
