However, despite his height, Dodgin was a rather cumbersome defender, and could not live up to the performances of his predecessor. He was dropped at the start of 1954\u201355 in favour of Jim Fotheringham. He returned in 1956\u201357 and was a regular in the side for the next four seasons. All through this time, Arsenal were going through a barren patch, and apart from a third-place finish in 1958\u201359, they were never close to winning a trophy. In total he played 208 matches for Arsenal, scoring only one goal."]}, {"page": "Bernard Moore (footballer)", "response": ["Moore was a regular in the Bedford side that reached the third round of the 1955\u201356 FA Cup, in which they faced Arsenal at Highbury. Bedford came back from two goals down to draw the match: with six minutes to go, \"Adey's centre from the left was flicked by Yates over the groping hands of Sullivan and Moore drove the ball home.\" He played in the replay which Bedford for most of the second half before the First Division side equalised and then secured the win in extra time. The Daily Herald wrote that Arsenal's centre half, Jim Fotheringham, \"looked crude and clumsy\" against Moore. By the end of the season he had lost his place. He made two appearances in the early part of the next before moving on to Cambridge United, where he again played alongside a former England player, this time Wilf Mannion. He spent time as player-manager of Potton United, and also played for Dunstable Town."]}]}}
