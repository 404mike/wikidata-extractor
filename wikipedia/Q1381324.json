At the cost of some of the crown's influence in Poitou, Blanche managed to keep the English Queen mother Isabelle, Countess of Angoul\u00eame and her second husband, Hugh X of Lusignan, from supporting the English side. However Mauclerc did support the English and Brittany rebelled against the crown in 1230. Originally the English landed in Brittany with 275 knights, men at arms, and barons to meet his ally Peter I, Duke of Brittany. The campaign began well for Henry III who probably recruited foot soldiers on the continent as he brought 7,800 marks with him. On the other hand Blanche's troops were insubordinate to her and refused to serve beyond the 40 day feudal contract- most disbanded after 40 days. Philip I, Count of Boulogne left the royal forces and proceeded to raid Champagne. Blanche had to chase Philip to try and stop him from raiding the important county leaving Henry III to proceed without serious resistance. Meanwhile the Norman nobles were also in open rebellion against Blanche. However, instead of marching to help the Norman rebels, he followed his vassal, advisor, and former regent  Hubert de Burgh, 1st Earl of Kent's advice and marched into Poitou. However it appears that Henry's excursion to Aquitaine was not necessary despite the calls for help by Geoffrey Beauchamp who probably panicked due to a slight rise in unrest in Aquitaine. Henry besieged Mirabeau and proceeded to Bordeaux, apparently \"securing\" the south while also losing massive amounts of money and being forced to take loans. What made it worse was that Aquitaine was not in any serious danger of being taken by the French because what remained of the French royal army was trying to quash a rebellion in Champagne, nowhere near Aquitaine. However it was not a complete loss. Henry was able to get money, military engines, and bolts for crossbows along with the militia of La R\u00e9ole. Henry marched north into Poitou but the gifts which Blanche had sent to the count of La Marche and the viscount of Thouars kept them loyal to the french. Although the local lords could not see Henry off, he was either unable or unwilling to commit to a large offensive investment and decided to return to Brittany where he spent the remainder of his money on feasts. He proceeded to England having accomplished little.  He lost money and prestige even if he had not taken significant casualties. Thus the rebellion died out, which helped establish Blanche and Louis as more stable rulers. Henry's failure to make any significant impact with his invasions ultimately discouraged Mauclerc's rebellion, and by 1234 he was firm in his support of Louis."]}, {"page": "List of chief governors of Ireland", "response": ["* Hubert de Burgh, 1st Earl of Kent 1232 (held the office formally, but never came to Ireland)A New History of Ireland, vol IX, pp 471, 481"]}, {"page": "Justiciar", "response": ["The chief justiciar was invariably a great noble or churchman, and the office became very powerful and important; enough to be a threat to the king.

Robert Grelley was one of the barons who made King John sign Magna Carta. Grelley was excommunicated for his role in the rebellion and when King John later ignored the terms of Magna Carta, Grelley forfeited his lands.

In 1234 he pronounced reversal judgment of Hubert de Burgh, 1st Earl of Kent's outlawry. Though he was not a justicier, he was regarded as the chief among judges. In 1237 he was appointed treasurer of Exeter Cathedral. He was elected to the See of Winchester in 1238 and passed from legal history. His election to this position was violently opposed by the King who favoured William of Valence. In 1239 Raleigh was elected to the See of Norwich. In 1244 he was elected to the See of Winchester for a second time. He died in 1250. He had much to do with the passage of the Statute of Merton. Raleigh defended the refusal of the barons to change the law of bastardy and legitimation. He invented the writ Quare ejecit infra terminum and was influential in the writing of several other novel writs. It is from Bracton that we get the majority of the history of the law at this time.
