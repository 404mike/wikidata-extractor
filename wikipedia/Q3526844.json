This was aimed principally at England's outstanding bowler James Southerton who had been playing for both Surrey and Sussex, having been born in one county and living in the other. Southerton chose to play for his county of residence, Surrey, from then on but remained the country's top bowler. The counties agreed on residence but not on a means of deciding a County Championship and so the title, known as \"Champion County\", remained an unofficial award until 1889. Grace's Gloucestershire had a very strong claim to this unofficial title in 1873 but consensus was that they shared it with Nottinghamshire. These two did not play each other and both were unbeaten in six matches, but Nottinghamshire won five and Gloucestershire won four.Webber, County Championship, pp. 12\u201318."]}, {"page": "1868 in sports", "response": ["* Most wickets \u2013 James Southerton 150 @ 13.86 (BB 8\u201334)"]}, {"page": "1869 in sports", "response": ["* Most wickets \u2013 James Southerton 136 @ 15.36 (BB 8\u201368)"]}, {"page": "1870 in sports", "response": ["* Most wickets \u2013 James Southerton 210 @ 14.62 (BB 8\u201367)"]}, {"page": "1871 in sports", "response": ["* Most wickets \u2013 James Southerton 151 @ 15.72 (BB 8\u201363)"]}, {"page": "1872 in sports", "response": ["* Most wickets \u2013 James Southerton 169 @ 13.07 (BB 8\u201320)"]}, {"page": "1873 in sports", "response": ["* Most wickets \u2013 James Southerton 148 @ 13.96 (BB 8\u2013113)"]}, {"page": "Underarm bowling", "response": ["Roundarm did not mean the end of underarm, which continued well into the overarm era that began in 1864.

Southerton, except in 1872 when fast bowler James Street helped him to win seven of twelve games, had no adequate support in bowling after underarm left-arm spinner George Griffith declined, and except when Richard Humphrey achieved prominence in 1872 the batting depended almost entirely on Jupp. The fielding was also generally below the standard expected of first-class cricket."]}, {"page": "Frank Sugg", "response": ["With Derbyshire's fortunes declining, in 1887 he went to Lancashire, and it was during his term at Old Trafford that he appeared for England in two Test matches. In 1890 he was one of the \"Nine Great Professional Batsmen\" profiled in Wisden. Sugg scored 1000 runs in a season five times, all during his time with Lancashire. He was one of the first players (after James Southerton) to represent three teams in county cricket. His benefit match in 1897 raised 1000 pounds."]}, {"page": "George Ulyett", "response": ["Ulyett also played in the first-ever Test match, staged at the MCG, during that tour. His first real action in Test cricket came when he held onto a catch off the bowling of James Southerton to dismiss Billy Midwinter for five. With the bat, however, Ulyett failed in the first innings, lasting just a quarter of an hour before Nat Thomson had him trapped in front; in the second innings, however, with England in dire straits, he fought hard with John Selby for about 45 minutes\u2014but then the rampant Tom Kendall got one through his defences and effectively brought an end to England's resistance, the match being lost by 45 runs. In bowling, Ulyett took three for 39 in the second innings, his first wicket being that of Charles Bannerman, who famously managed an incredible 165 out of Australia's first innings total of 245 (or 67.3 per cent of it, still a Test-Match record). This amazing effort finally came to an end when the toiling Ulyett let loose a sharp, rising bouncer that found its way through Bannerman's primitive gloving and struck him a blow on the index finger, splitting it open rather badly. A short delay revealed the fact that Bannerman could no longer grip his bat properly and that, therefore, he would have to retire. The Australian opener walked off, wincing from the pain in his bloodied right hand. George Ulyett, although never regarded as a truly-quick bowler, could nevertheless do real damage on occasion. Bannerman was unable to field, and, in the second innings, when Ulyett dismissed him again (this time in orthodox fashion\u2014bowled), he faced just nine deliveries."]}, {"page": "Tom Emmett", "response": ["In the first ever Test England lost the toss and were made to field in the 1st Innings.

Thomson has the distinction of being the first batsman dismissed in a Test match, when he was clean bowled by England's Allen Hill for 1 when the score was 2.
