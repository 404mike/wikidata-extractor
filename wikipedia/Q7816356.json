He guested for Bourne Town and Northampton Town during the Second World War and signed for Nottingham Forest upon its conclusion. He crossed the Trent to join Notts County in 1947 and played alongside Tommy Lawton.\nOriginally an inside forward, Johnston latterly developed into a goal-scoring outside left. Following his playing retirement he earned FA coaching qualifications and, in 1956, a coaching position with Birmingham City. His first managerial role was with non-league Heanor Town before a twenty-year career in charge of Rotherham, Grimsby, Huddersfield and York.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Huddersfield Town A.F.C.", "response": ["Former Town manager Tom Johnston returned to the club as general manager in 1975. The club later returned to all-blue shirts that he had introduced in the mid-1960s. Johnston replaced Bobby Collins as manager in December 1975. During the 1976\u201377 season, John Haselden became the manager with Johnston returning to his previous role. This, however, did not last, as Johnston demoted Haselden in September 1977 and gave himself the job. He managed Town to their lowest ever league position of 11th at the end of the 1977\u201378 season.", "Town stuck with the same principal design (blue and white stripes) until 1966, when Scottish manager Tom Johnston introduced all-blue shirts. A new badge was also adopted that year, when the vertical monogram \"HTFC\" adorned the all-blue shirts. When the club adopted the nickname \"The Terriers\" for the 1969\u201370 season, the blue and white stripes returned and with it a red terrier with the words \"The Terriers\".", "After relegation to the Fourth Division, Huddersfield returned to all-blue shirts and the vertical monogram crest with the return of Tom Johnston in 1975. Stripes returned in the 1977\u201378 season and have been the club's home kit ever since. In 1980, Town adopted what remains their badge today. It combined elements of the old town coat of arms with modern motifs, such as blue and white stripes and a terrier with a football."]}, {"page": "Tom Johnston", "response": ["*Tom Johnston (footballer) (1918\u20131994), Scottish midfielder; playing career 1938\u20131956; coaching and managerial career 1956\u20131978", "*Tom Johnston (musician) (born 1948), American musician, co-founder of The Doobie Brothers", "*Tom Johnston (Saskatchewan politician) (1881\u20131969), British-born Canadian political figure", "*Tom Johnston (British politician) (1881\u20131965), Scottish political figure", "*Tom Johnston (greyhound trainer) (1933\u20132001), British greyhound trainer"]}, {"page": "Rotherham United F.C.", "response": ["|Tom Johnston"]}, {"page": "Notts County F.C.", "response": ["|align=\"left\"| Tom Johnston"]}, {"page": "Grimsby Town F.C.", "response": ["|  Tom Johnston"]}, {"page": "Stapleford, Nottinghamshire", "response": ["*Tom Johnston, football manager and player."]}, {"page": "John Rudge", "response": ["Born and raised in Wolverhampton, Rudge became a lifelong fan of Wolverhampton Wanderers.
