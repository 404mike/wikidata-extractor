He guested for Bourne Town and Northampton Town during the Second World War and signed for Nottingham Forest upon its conclusion. He crossed the Trent to join Notts County in 1947 and played alongside Tommy Lawton.\nOriginally an inside forward, Johnston latterly developed into a goal-scoring outside left. Following his playing retirement he earned FA coaching qualifications and, in 1956, a coaching position with Birmingham City. His first managerial role was with non-league Heanor Town before a twenty-year career in charge of Rotherham, Grimsby, Huddersfield and York.", "link_mentions": {}}}
