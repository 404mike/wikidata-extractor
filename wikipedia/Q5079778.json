Coming from a very working-class background, the generosity of a family friend made it possible for him to get a start in life and train as a teacher; he entered politics through Poplar Borough Council, and was elected to Parliament to replace George Lansbury. Serving in junior posts during the Attlee government, he remained in Parliament until the age of 81.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1948 Summer Olympics", "response": ["At the time of the Games, food, petrol and building were still subject to the rationing imposed during the war in Britain; because of this the 1948 Olympics came to be known as the \"Austerity Games\". Athletes were given the same increased rations as dockers and miners, 5,467 calories a day instead of the normal 2,600. Building an Olympic Village was deemed too expensive, and athletes were housed in existing accommodation. Male competitors stayed at RAF camps in Uxbridge and West Drayton, and an Army camp in Richmond Park; female competitors in London colleges. Lord Burghley unfurled the Olympic Flag at the Richmond Park camp at an opening ceremony in July as Minister of Works, Charles Key, declared the camp open."]}, {"page": "Richmond Park", "response": ["John Boyd-Carpenter, MP for Kingston-upon-Thames, proposed using the Kingston Gate Camp to help alleviate the local post-war housing shortage but Minister of Works, Charles Key, was opposed, preferring that the site be eventually returned to its former parkland use. Key's department refurbished and repurposed the camp as an Olympic Village for the 1948 Summer Olympics.Cloake, p. 201 The Olympic Village was opened by Lord Burghley with Key making the announcement, in July 1948. After the Olympics, the camp was used by units of the Royal Corps of Signals then by the Women's Royal Army Corps following their formation in 1949 as successor to the wartime ATS. Although it had been hoped to clear the camp during the 1950s, it remained in military use and was used to house service families repatriated following the Suez Crisis in 1956. It was not until 1965 that the camp was eventually demolished and reintegrated into the park during the following year."]}, {"page": "First Commissioner of Works", "response": ["| Charles KeyMP for Bow and Bromley(1883\u20131964)"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1945 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Charles Key"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1950 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Charles Key"]}, {"page": "List of Privy Counsellors (1936\u20131952)", "response": ["*Charles Key (1883\u20131964)"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1951 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Charles Key"]}, {"page": "Churchill War Rooms", "response": ["After the end of the war, the Cabinet War Rooms became redundant and were abandoned.

The foundation stone for the new building was laid by the former mayor, Alderman Charles Key, on 8 May 1937. It was designed by Culpin and Son in the Moderist style in a shape that took the form of a trapezoid. The design involved a rounded frontage at the junction of Bow Road and Fairfield Road; there were layers of continuous stone facing panels above and below a continuous band of glazing on the first, second and third floors. The Builders, a frieze by sculptor David Evans on the face of the building, was unveiled by Lansbury at the official opening of the building on 10 December 1938. The Portland Stone panels commemorated the trades constructing the town hall and symbolised the borough's relationship with the River Thames and the youth of Poplar.Public Monument & Sculpture Association  date accessed 1 April 2007 The principal rooms were the council chamber, the mayor's parlour and an assembly hall which benefited from a sprung Canadian maple dance floor."]}]}}
