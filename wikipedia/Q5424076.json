Thomas was a captain in the Royal Navy, a hydrographer working for the Admiralty (a successor to his father George Thomas), charting the waters around the Northern and Western isles of Scotland. He sailed with Captain Otter, on HMS Porcupine, on the voyage to St Kilda. There Thomas took the earliest photographs ever taken of St Kilda. Thomas was a member of the Photographic Society of Scotland and the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. Commencing in 1851 he authored several papers discussing the history of the Northern and Western Isles. He died in Edinburgh in 1885. In 2004, a television documentary employing Thomas's 1860 photography was broadcast on Grampian Television.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Clan Morrison", "response": ["The 19th-century historian F.

It is said that he was challenged to a duel by \"the Great McBane\", a champion of an opposing army. D\u00f2mhnall Cam's victory in the duel is said to have been commemorated in a song called Ceann na Drochaid, however no such song by that name now exists. According to Matheson, the song may actually be a pibroch. There are two known pibrochs with similar titles, Ceann na Drochaide M\u00f2ire, and Ceann na Drochaide Bige, however both of these relate to the Macdonalds and not the Macaulays. According to F. W. L. Thomas, the tradition of D\u00f2mhnall Cam's exploits in Ireland was based upon the confusion of an Irish battle fought at a place called Beul na Drochaid, in 1495. One of the leaders in the battle was a Sligo chief named D\u00f2mhnall C\u00e0m Mac Donnachadha. Even so, Matheson thought that it was possible that D\u00f2mhnall Cam could have taken part in an expedition to Ireland because in 1545 the Macleods of Lewis were one of the Hebridean clans who entered into the service of Shane O'Neill, who was then in rebellion against Elizabeth I of England. This Lewis Macleod adventure was however an inglorious one, and they soon returned home to Scotland. Matheson also conceded that there is no connection between the Lewis Macleod's expedition and Derry where the Lewis tradition ties D\u00f2mhnall Cam to."]}, {"page": "Lj\u00f3t\u00f3lfr", "response": ["Captain F.

In one of Cromartie's version of events, Macaulay, the constable of Eilean Donan Castle, was the father-in-law of Black Murdoch, the Mackenzie chief. This Macaulay was slain by Leod, and in consequence the lands of Loch Broom and Coigeach passed to Black Murdoch in right of his Macaulay wife. Later in his life, the Earl of Cromartie dictated a more detailed version of these events; he related how the Macaulay constable of Eilean Donan Castle, brought back Black Murdoch from Macdougall of Lorn, who had fostered the young chief and protected him from his bastard brothers. In this version of events, Black Murdoch's brother-in-law was Macaulay of Loch Broom, and the 19th century antiquarian F. W. L. Thomas noted that within this version, this Macaulay appears to be a different individual than the constable of Eilean Donan Castle. According to Cromartie, Macaulay of Loch Broom was at the time oppressed by Leslie, Earl of Ross, and Leod, as one of the earl's followers, invaded Loch Broom and killed him. Because Macaulay of Loch Broom had no children other than his daughter, Black Murdoch claimed the slain man's lands as his own by right of his wife; however, the Earl of Ross granted these lands in liferent to Leod. Cromartie also notes that Leod also owned lands in Strathcarron, and some in Strathokell.Thomas 1886: pp. 373\u2013375."]}]}}
