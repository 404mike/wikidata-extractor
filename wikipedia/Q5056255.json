He was a right-handed batsman who bowled occasional right-arm off spin. In addition Paris was also a prominent cricket administrator.\nParis played for Hampshire from 1933-1948. He captained the county in the 1938 County Championship, his only season as captain. Paris also played for the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1939. No first-class cricket was played due to the Second World War, so it was six years until Paris could resume his first-class career with Hampshire in 1946. Paris retired from first-class cricket at the end of the 1948 County Championship.\nOutside of playing for Hampshire Paris also held every office of note at the club: cricket chairman; club chairman; and president from 1984 to 1989. Paris was the first chairman of the Test and County Cricket Board, formed in 1968, then being nominated by Prince Philip to succeed him in 1975 as president of Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and chairman of the International Cricket Conference.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Arlott", "response": ["He played cricket at club level but would spend most of his free summer time following the Hampshire team both home and away. As a result of his regular support he became known to the team and this led to his one and only brief playing exposure to the first-class game. He was watching Hampshire play Kent at Canterbury in August 1938 when they discovered they would be short of a twelfth man for the following game. Being willing and available, young Arlott was co-opted and he travelled with the team to Worcester. Hampshire had had to use three substitute fielders when two of their XI were injured and skipper  Cecil Paris suffered a puncture on his way to the ground."]}, {"page": "Test and County Cricket Board", "response": ["* Cecil Paris 1968-1969", "* Cecil Paris 1971-1972", "* Cecil Paris 1973-1975"]}, {"page": "List of Hampshire cricket captains", "response": ["*  Cecil Paris 1938"]}, {"page": "Sports in Pune", "response": ["* Cecil Paris"]}, {"page": "List of Gentlemen cricketers (1841\u20131962)", "response": ["* Cecil Paris (1935)"]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1919\u20131939)", "response": ["* Cecil Paris (1939) : C.
