He was Emeritus Professor of English at the University of Warwick and an expert on T. S. Eliot.\nHe was born in London and studied at Wadham College, Oxford. He had an academic position in Manchester before moving to Warwick, and held visiting professorships at American universities.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sylvia Plath", "response": ["The Colossus received largely positive UK reviews, highlighting Plath's voice as new and strong, individual and American in tone. Peter Dickinson at Punch called the collection \"a real find\" and \"exhilarating to read\", full of \"clean, easy verse\". Bernard Bergonzi at the Manchester Guardian said the book was an \"outstanding technical accomplishment\" with a \"virtuoso quality\". From the point of publication she became a presence on the poetry scene. The book went on to be published in America in 1962 to less-glowing reviews. Whilst her craft was generally praised, her writing was viewed as more derivative of other poets."]}, {"page": "Philip Larkin", "response": ["Chatterjee's view of Larkin is grounded in a detailed analysis of his poetic style. He observes a development from Larkin's early works to his later ones, which sees his style change from \"verbal opulence through a recognition of the self-ironising and self-negating potentiality of language to a linguistic domain where the conventionally held conceptual incompatibles \u2013 which are traditional binary oppositions between absolutes and relatives, between abstracts and concretes, between fallings and risings and between singleness and multiplicity \u2013 are found to be the last stumbling-block for an artist aspiring to rise above the impasse of worldliness\".Chatterjee 2007, p. 331. This contrasts with an older view that Larkin's style barely changed over the course of his poetic career. Chatterjee identifies this view as being typified by Bernard Bergonzi's comment that \"Larkin's poetry did not ... develop between 1955 and 1974\".Chatterjee 2007, p. 14. For Chatterjee, Larkin's poetry responds strongly to changing \"economic, socio-political, literary and cultural factors\".Chatterjee 2007, p. 18."]}, {"page": "Dr. No (novel)", "response": ["Prior to the release of Dr. No\u2014and unconnected with the book itself\u2014Bernard Bergonzi, in the March 1958 issue of Twentieth Century, attacked Fleming's work, saying it contained \"a strongly marked streak of voyeurism and sado-masochism\" and that the books showed \"the total lack of any ethical frame of reference\". The article also compared Fleming unfavourably to John Buchan and Raymond Chandler in both moral and literary measures. The writer Simon Raven, while appreciating Bergonzi had produced a \"quiet and well-argued article\", thought the critic's conclusion was na\u00efve, and asked \"Since when has it been remarkable in a work of entertainment that it should lack a specific 'ethical frame of reference'?\" Raven continued, saying Fleming \"by reason of his cool and analytical intelligence, his informed use of technical facts, his plausibility, sense of pace, brilliant descriptive powers and superb imagination, provides sheer entertainment such as I, who must read many novels, am seldom lucky enough to find\"."]}, {"page": "Ian Fleming", "response": ["For the first five books (Casino Royale, Live and Let Die, Moonraker, Diamonds Are Forever and From Russia, with Love) Fleming received broadly positive reviews. That began to change in March 1958 when Bernard Bergonzi, in the journal Twentieth Century, attacked Fleming's work as containing \"a strongly marked streak of voyeurism and sado-masochism\" and wrote that the books showed \"the total lack of any ethical frame of reference\". The article compared Fleming unfavourably with John Buchan and Raymond Chandler on both moral and literary criteria. A month later, Dr. No was published, and Fleming received harsh criticism from reviewers who, in the words of Ben Macintyre, \"rounded on Fleming, almost as a pack\". The most strongly worded of the critiques came from Paul Johnson of the New Statesman, who, in his review \"Sex, Snobbery and Sadism\", called the novel \"without doubt, the nastiest book I have ever read\". Johnson went on to say that \"by the time I was a third of the way through, I had to suppress a strong impulse to throw the thing away\". Johnson recognised that in Bond there \"was a social phenomenon of some importance\", but this was seen as a negative element, as the phenomenon concerned \"three basic ingredients in Dr No, all unhealthy, all thoroughly English: the sadism of a schoolboy bully, the mechanical, two-dimensional sex-longings of a frustrated adolescent, and the crude, snob-cravings of a suburban adult.\" Johnson saw no positives in Dr. No, and said, \"Mr Fleming has no literary skill, the construction of the book is chaotic, and entire incidents and situations are inserted, and then forgotten, in a haphazard manner.\""]}, {"page": "George Sutherland Fraser", "response": ["A.

G. Farrell", "response": ["Farrell published his first novel, A Man From Elsewhere, in 1963. Set in France, it shows the clear influence of French Existentialism. The story follows Sayer, a journalist for a communist paper, as he tries to find skeletons in Regan's closet. Regan is a dying novelist who is about to be awarded an important Catholic literary prize. The book mimics the fight between the two leaders of French existentialism: Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus, Sayer representing Sartre and Regan Camus. The two argue about existentialism: the position that murder can be vindicated as an expedient in overthrowing tyranny (Sartre) versus the stance that there are no ends that justify unjust means (Camus). Bernard Bergonzi reviewed it in the New Statesman's 20 September 1963 issue, writing, \"Many first novels are excessively autobiographical, but A Man from Elsewhere suffers from the opposite fault of being a cerebral construct, dreamed up out of literature and the contemporary French cinema.\" Simon Raven wrote in The Observer on 15 September 1963, \"Mr. Farrell's style is spare, his plotting lucid and well timed; his expositions of moral or political problems are pungent if occasionally didactic.\" It entirely lacks the ironic humour and tender appreciation of human frailty that characterise his later work.
