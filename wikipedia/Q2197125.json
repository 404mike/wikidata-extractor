He was a native of Dornoch and learned his golf in his home country, but like many British professional golfers of his era he spent many years working as a club professional in the United States. While employed by the Brae Burn Country Club, near Boston, he won the 1907 U.S. Open at the St. Martin's course at Philadelphia Cricket Club. He competed in the U.S. Open seventeen times in total, and finished in the top-10 five times. His other tournament wins include the North and South Open six times (1902, 1904, 1907, 1908, 1910, 1915), the Massachusetts Open six times (1906, 1907, 1908, 1909, 1910, 1912) and the Swiss Open three times (1923, 1925, 1926).\nRoss's older brother Donald also moved to the U.S. and was one of the most celebrated of all golf course designers. Alec was the professional at the Detroit Golf Club in Detroit, Michigan for 31 years. He died in Miami, Florida.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Kingston, Ontario", "response": ["The Kingston WritersFest occurs annually.
