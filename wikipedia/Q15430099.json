He insisted that all of his students received not only lectures in engineering principles but also a firm grounding in mathematics, physics, chemistry, geology and the other sciences upon which engineering is based. He also asked that an engineering laboratory be built so that the students could have first hand experience of the applications of their theoretical studies.  This proposal met widespread support from the engineering profession and the presidents of the Institution of Civil Engineers and the Institution of Mechanical Engineers were among the leading figures who supported it. In 1878 the laboratory was built and put to use, it was the first of its kind in the world and proved so useful that over the next nine years ten other educational institutions followed Professor Kennedy's example and built their own."]}, {"page": "Telford Medal", "response": ["| Thomas Hudson Beare || || \"The Building-Stones of Great Britain: their Crushing Strength and other Properties\"."]}, {"page": "Regent Terrace", "response": ["The painter Sir George Harvey lived at 21 Regent Terrace from 1854 to 1876.
