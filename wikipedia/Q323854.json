As this painting depicts a church building with a tower and spire, it has been argued that Herbert's portrait does not represent Mount St Bernard, as the abbey was without a tower until the twentieth century and has never had a spire. However, the catalogue entry at the Tate Gallery explains that Herbert used Pugin's original designs to depict the church in line with the architect's vision. Herbert was a close friend of Pugin and had painted him in 1845.Nancy Langham Cooper: \"A Brief Biography of J R Herbert\", 2013 The abbey guest book confirms that \"Mr. Herbert, an artist from London\" visited the abbey on 22 July 1861.
