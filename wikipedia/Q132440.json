If she had outlived both her grandfather King George III and her father, she would have become Queen of the United Kingdom; but she died at the age of 21, predeceasing them both.\nCharlotte's parents disliked each other from before their arranged marriage and soon separated. The Prince of Wales left most of Charlotte's care to governesses and servants, but only allowed her limited contact with Caroline, who eventually left the country. As Charlotte grew to adulthood, her father pressured her to marry William, Hereditary Prince of Orange (later King of the Netherlands). After initially accepting him, Charlotte soon broke off the intended match. This resulted in an extended contest of wills between her and her father, who finally permitted her to marry Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld (later King of the Belgians). After a year and a half of happy marriage, Charlotte died after delivering a stillborn son.\nCharlotte's death set off tremendous mourning among the British, who had seen her as a sign of hope and a contrast both to her unpopular father and to her grandfather, whom they deemed mad. She had been King George III's only legitimate grandchild, meaning there was a chance the throne would pass to a distant relative. The King's unmarried sons thus looked for wives and his fourth son, Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn, fathered the eventual queen, Victoria.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1817", "response": ["* November 6 \u2013 Princess Charlotte of Wales, Heir-presumptive to the British throne (b. 1796)"]}, {"page": "History of Belgium", "response": ["Belgian independence was not allowed by the 1815 Congress of Vienna; nevertheless the revolutionaries were regarded sympathetically by the major powers of Europe, especially the British.

At the end of November Britain and France came up with a proposal \u2014 no military intervention and the establishment of an independent kingdom of Belgium \u2014 which was accepted by the other three more conservative participants, who had favored a military intervention to restore the absolutist regime of William I.Els Witte, \"La Construction de la Belgique 1828\u20131847\", in E.

A protocol signed on 20 January 1831 stated that Belgium would be formed of the regions that did not belong to the North in 1790. The new kingdom would be obliged to remain neutral in foreign affairs. The British foreign secretary Lord Palmerston strongly backed the Prince of Orange as the new king, a choice which would have maintained a dynastic link between the Netherlands and the new kingdom. The Prince proved to be unacceptable to William I, his father, as well as to the French, who wanted a clear break with the Netherlands. Finally, Palmerston came up with his second choice, Leopold I of Saxe-Coburg \u2014 Princess Charlotte of Wales' widower, and an admirer of the British constitutional model \u2014 who was accepted by all.Els Witte, pp. 74\u201376 On July 21, 1831, the first \"King of the Belgians\" was inaugurated.

William's initial choices of potential wives either met with the disapproval of his eldest brother, the Prince of Wales, or turned him down. His younger brother Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge, was sent to Germany to scout out the available Protestant princesses; he came up with Princess Augusta of Hesse-Kassel, but her father Frederick declined the match.Letter from Hesse to the Duke of Cambridge, 1 March 1818, quoted in Ziegler, p. 121.

The dignitaries who led the investigation concluded that there was \"no foundation\" to the rumours, but Caroline's access to her daughter was nonetheless restricted.
