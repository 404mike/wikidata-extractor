At first he was a teacher, becoming head of the History department, but he later became an insurance executive in Coventry.\nYoung joined the Labour Party in 1955, and he was Chair of Coventry East Constituency Labour Party from 1964 to 1968. The Labour MP for the constituency at this time was Richard Crossman, a senior figure on the left of the party. In 1973 he was elected to Nuneaton Borough Council, serving for three years.\nAfter a succession of candidacies in unwinnable seats (South Worcestershire in 1959, Banbury in 1966, and Bath in 1970), Young was elected to the House of Commons on his fourth attempt for Bolton East in February 1974. He served as Parliamentary Secretary to Fred Mulley from 1977 to 1979.\nFollowing boundary changes, he became MP for Bolton South East in 1983. Although willing to continue, he was replaced as Labour candidate for the seat by Brian Iddon before the 1997 general election. Young accepted his deselection with good grace.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "David Young", "response": ["* David Young (Canadian playwright) (born 1946), Canadian playwright and novelist", "* David Young (novelist) (born 1958), British novelist", "* David Young (judge), daytime court television show judge in Miami", "* Judge David Young, daytime court television show", "* David Young (TV producer), British game show producer", "* David Young (Neighbours), fictional character on Australian soap opera Neighbours", "* David Young, founding editor of the Farmers' Almanac, 1818", "* David Young, writer and actor for CollegeHumor web site", "* David Young (saxophonist, 1912-1992), American jazz tenor saxophonist", "* David Young (musician) (active from 1990), American recorder musician", "* David Young (composer), American video game music composer", "* David Young (Labour politician) (1930\u20132003), British Labour Party MP, 1974\u20131997", "* David Young, Baron Young of Graffham (born 1932), British politician and Cabinet minister from the 1980s", "* David Young (Ontario politician) (born 1957), Canadian politician in Ontario", "* David Young (Watergate) (born 1936), member of a covert ops team under U.S. President Richard Nixon", "* David Young (Iowa politician) (born 1968), former member of the U.S. House of Representatives", "* David Young (North Carolina politician) (born 1959), businessman and Chairman of the North Carolina Democratic Party", "* David Young III (1905\u20131977), American politician in New Jersey", "*David Young (Louisiana politician), state senator (African American officeholders during and following the Reconstruction era)", "* David Young (footballer, born 1945), English footballer for Newcastle, Sunderland, Charlton, and Southend in the 1970s", "* David Young (Australian footballer) (born 1954), Australian rules footballer for South Melbourne and Collingwood", "* David Young (footballer, born 1965), English footballer for Darlington in the 1980s", "* David Young (gridiron football) (born 1979), defensive back selected in the 2003 NFL Draft", "* David Young (swimmer) (1907\u20131988), American Olympic swimmer", "* David Young (wrestler) (born 1972), American professional wrestler", "* David Young (cricketer) (born 1977),  English cricketer", "* David Young (basketball) (born 1981), drafted by the Seattle SuperSonics", "* David Young (hurler) (born 1985), Irish sportsperson", "* David Young (rower), English rower", "* David Young (bishop) (1931\u20132008), British Anglican bishop; Bishop of Ripon", "* David Young (cleric) (1844\u20131913), Wesleyan minister and historian", "* David Young (British Army officer) (1926\u20132000), General Officer Commanding Scotland", "* David Young (bomber), former policeman who took hostages at an elementary school in Cokeville, Wyoming, 1986"]}, {"page": "Bolton South East (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| David Young"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom MPs: Y", "response": ["|David Young"]}, {"page": "Bolton East (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| David Young"]}, {"page": "David Wright Young", "response": ["#REDIRECT David Young (Labour politician)"]}, {"page": "Deaths in January 2003", "response": ["*David Young, 72, British politician (Member of Parliament for Bolton East, Bolton South East)."]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom MPs who died in the 2000s", "response": ["|David Young"]}, {"page": "Deselection of Labour MPs", "response": ["|David Young"]}]}}
