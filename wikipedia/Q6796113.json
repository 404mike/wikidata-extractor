The surviving artefacts, costume and regalia were lent to the National Trust Museum of Childhood  at Sudbury Hall in Derbyshire, but in 1982 they were deposited with the Museum of London. The documentary archive went first to the University of Cardiff and then the British Library of Political and Economic Science.
