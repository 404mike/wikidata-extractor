His illustrations often present highly detailed spacecraft against vividly colored backgrounds and high-tech constructions as demonstrated by his pioneering work on The Dome: Ground Zero for DC Comics imprint Helix in 1998. Like Peter Elson, Tony Roberts, Chris Foss and some other artists of the period, he influenced an entire generation of science fiction illustrators and concept artists. This influence may be seen in the look of for the Homeworld video game.In 1993 he wrote and drew the first 2 parts of a science fiction comic published by Dark Horse entitled \"The Blue Lily\", based on Dave Weir's short story. As of 2011, McKie was reportedly working on the last 2 parts of the work in his spare time. He also wrote and illustrated a story entitled \"So Beautiful and So Dangerous\" for Heavy Metal magazine, which later became a segment in the film Heavy Metal.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of science fiction and fantasy artists", "response": ["*Angus McKie (born 1951)"]}, {"page": "Heavy Metal (film)", "response": ["Based on the comic of the same name by Angus McKie.", "* Angus McKie \u2013 writer"]}, {"page": "Bryan Talbot", "response": ["*Neil Gaiman\u2019s Mr. Hero the Newmatic Man (Issue #1,  6 pages pencils and inks, written by Rick Veitch, coloured by Angus McKie, 1995)", "*Neil Gaiman\u2019s Mr. Hero the Newmatic Man (Issue #2,  5 pages, inked by Angus McKie (1995, Tekno Comix Written by Rick Veitch, coloured by Angus McKie, 1995)", "*Neil Gaiman\u2019s Wheel of Worlds One shot, 11 pages (1995, Tekno Comix Written by Rick Veitch, coloured by Angus McKie,)"]}, {"page": "Val\u00e9rian and Laureline", "response": [" The influence of Val\u00e9rian has been noticed in such strips as  (by V\u00edctor Mora and Carlos Gim\u00e9nez) and Gigantik (by Mora and Jos\u00e9 Maria Cardona).

Thomson resulted, but Bolland would refer to this period as his \"lowest time.\" Bardon did however produce a client called Pikin which was \"planning a bi-weekly comic about an African superhero,\" Powerman, which was to be sold in Nigeria. Gibbons and Bolland were to draw alternate issues (Bolland's first issue was Powerman No. 2.), and Bolland recalls that \"soon Dave had drawn his entire story and I had produced just a few pages.\" This knowledge \u2013 \"that Dave could produce a page a day... and that I was going to have to do the same\" \u2013 was a shock, but proved to be \"the very best kind of training ground.\" With comics purportedly being new to Nigeria, Bolland recalls this work being created specifically to be \"really simple; six panels on a page and [all] the panels had to be numbered.\" Not only was this work \"[t]he best way to learn the simple rules of comic book storytelling,\" but \"better still, it was going someplace where nobody I knew could see it.\" He \"drew around 300 pages of that very straightforward, simple-to-follow work, and I guess the storytelling flowed naturally from that.\"Salisbury, p. 12 Even so, he \"was always struggling to get the last eight or ten pages finished,\" and was occasionally helped by friends, both from his \"Norwich School of Art days,\" Gibbons and future-2000 AD and League of Extraordinary Gentlemen artist Kevin O'Neill.Bolland, \"The 1970s \u2013 Help from Friends\" in The Art of Brian Bolland, p. 42"]}, {"page": "Dave Gibbons", "response": ["*The Dome: Ground Zero (w, with Angus McKie, graphic novel, tpb, 64 pages, Helix, 1998, )"]}, {"page": "Helix (comics)", "response": ["| Angus McKie"]}, {"page": "Jean-Claude M\u00e9zi\u00e8res", "response": ["M\u00e9zi\u00e8res' arrival on the French comics scene with Val\u00e9rian was contemporaneous with the debuts of other notable French science-fiction strips including Luc Orient by Greg and Eddy Paape and Lone Sloane by Philippe Druillet.

After Gibbons finished the script he produced page layouts using Photoshop which he then provided to McKie who combined them with the letters and panel borders using Freehand. Painted 3D images were rendered and then opened using Photoshop for reworking and finally pasted onto the letters and panel borders.
