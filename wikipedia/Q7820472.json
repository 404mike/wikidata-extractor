Harris had an important collection of Spanish prints, especially those of Goya, which was mostly acquired by the British Museum after his death. In fact, Harris, while still alive, had placed his collection on indefinite loan in the British Museum. The British Museum has 708 objects formerly in his collection, including 22 prints he made himself, and in 1981 published Juliet Wilson Bareau's, Goya's Prints, The Tom\u00e1s Harris Collection in the British Museum.He had five siblings: William, Morris, Violeta, Conchita, and Enriqueta Harris (1910\u20142006), an art historian specializing in Spanish art.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "British Museum", "response": ["Since its foundation in 1808, the prints and drawings collection has grown to international renown as one of the richest and most representative collections in the world.

The collection of prints covers the tradition of fine printmaking from its beginnings in the 15th century up to the present, with near complete holdings of most of the great names before the 19th century.

He began inventing fictitious sub-agents who could be blamed for false information and mistakes. The Allies finally accepted Pujol when the Germans spent considerable resources attempting to hunt down a fictitious convoy. Following interviews by Desmond Bristow of Section V MI6 Iberian Section, Juan Pujol was taken on. The family were moved to Britain and Pujol was given the code name \"Garbo\". Pujol and his handler Tom\u00e1s Harris spent the rest of the war expanding the fictitious network, communicating to the German handlers at first by letters, and later by radio.

He was moved to Britain on 24 April 1942 and given the code name \"Bovril\", after the drink concentrate. However, after he passed the security check conducted by MI6 Officer Desmond Bristow, Bristow suggested that he be accompanied by MI5 officer Tom\u00e1s Harris (a fluent Spanish speaker) to brief Pujol on how he and Harris should work together. Pujol's wife and child were later moved to Britain.", "In 1971, the British politician Rupert Allason, writing under the pen name Nigel West, became interested in Garbo. For several years, he interviewed various former intelligence officers, but none knew Garbo's real name. Eventually, Tom\u00e1s Harris' friend Anthony Blunt, the Soviet spy who had penetrated MI5, said that he had met Garbo, and knew him as \"either Juan or Jos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda\". Allason's investigation was stalled from that point until March 1984, when a former MI5 officer who had served in Spain supplied Pujol's full name. Allason hired a research assistant to call every J.
