He made his debut for Blackpool, who were then managed by Joe Smith, on 6 September 1948, in a 1\u20131 draw with Derby County at Bloomfield Road. He went on to make a further five appearances during the 1948\u201349 league campaign, deputising for Ron Suart.\nWright made fourteen league appearances in 1949\u201350, during which season Suart left for Blackburn Rovers.\nIn 1950\u201351, Wright made twelve league appearances, but sat out Blackpool's entire run to their second FA Cup Final.\nThe following season, 1951\u201352, he made fifteen appearances, before missing the whole 1952\u201353 term.\nIn 1953\u201354, Wright returned to the line-up; however, he was still unable to nudge out Tommy Garrett from the left-back berth, and therefore made only eight league appearances. Once again, he did not appear in the club's run to another, this time successful, FA Cup Final.\nWright was absent again for the entirety of the 1954\u201355 campaign, but it was in 1955\u201356, his eighth season with the Tangerines, that he was given an extended run in the team. He made thirty-eight starts in the club's 42 league games as they finished as runners-up in Division One.\nHe scored his first and only goal for the club in 1956\u201357, in a 4\u20130 victory over Luton Town at Bloomfield Road on 8 September, during one of his sixteen league appearances.\nWright had another sustained run in the Blackpool team during 1957\u201358, making 31 appearances.\n1958\u201359 was Wright's eleventh and final season on the Fylde. Ron Suart, with whom he had competed for the number-3 shirt earlier in his Seasiders career, succeeded Joe Smith as manager. Suart gave seventeen starts to Wright, the final one occurring on 3 January in a 3\u20131 defeat at Manchester United at Old Trafford.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wright", "response": ["*Jackie Wright (1905\u20131989), British comedian", "*Jackie Wright (footballer) (1926\u20132005), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Jackie Wright", "response": ["John Wright (24 September 1904 in Belfast, Ireland \u2013 January 1989 in Belfast, Northern Ireland), credited professionally as Jackie Wright, also nicknamed Little Jackie and Uncle Jackie, was a Northern Irish comedian.

Considered a shrewd businessman, Russell made some revolutionary changes. He developed a successful youth policy which included England international Roy McFarland among its graduates. More visibly, he introduced an all-white kit to set the team apart from local rivals, Division One club Everton; these have been Tranmere's usual colours since. He also took advantage of the floodlights, regularly arranging home fixtures on Friday evenings rather than the usual Saturday afternoon. This allowed supporters to watch Tranmere on Fridays and Everton or Liverpool on Saturdays; Friday night games continued until the 1990s. Russell guided Rovers back to Division Three in 1967, a year before a new 4,000-seater main stand was opened. He became general manager in 1969, allowing Jackie Wright to take over."]}]}}
