Dawkins stated that he preferred the wording \"There is almost certainly no God\". Ariane Sherine claims it is necessary to be factually accurate, and that as it is impossible to disprove the existence of God it is only possible to say one 'probably' does not exist. Critic D. J. Taylor felt that this qualification let the campaign down, but admired it for introducing some tentativeness into an often polarised debate, while atheists including A. C. Grayling think that they can be certain there is no God and therefore the word 'probably' should not be used. It was also suggested that inserting the word would avoid a breach of the Advertising Standards Authority's rules."]}, {"page": "Sherine (name)", "response": ["*Ariane Sherine (born 1980), British musical stand-up comedian, comedy writer and journalist"]}, {"page": "Little Atoms", "response": ["* Ariane Sherine \u2013 British comedy writer and journalist.
