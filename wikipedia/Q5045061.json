Her father George Augustus Williams (1814\u20131901) was a popular landscape artist and a member of the Williams family of painters. She learned to paint from her father, and her works are somewhat similar to his in subject and treatment, but with much brighter colors. Her technical ability was the equal or better to that of many of her male counterparts of the time, but despite the support of her father, she lived in an age where society did not encourage women in the arts.She exhibited at the Royal Academy (12 works), the British Institution (19 works), the Suffolk Street Gallery of the Society of British Artists (64 works), and exhibited in many lesser-known Victorian art venues as well, especially the Society of Lady Artists where she was a regular contributor. She never married, and died under her maiden name on 30 December 1921 at Forest Hill, London. Three examples of her work are on display at the Reading Museum & Town Hall in Berkshire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Augustus Williams", "response": ["#Caroline Fanny Williams (1836\u20131921), born 5 December 1836 in St Marylebone, London; and died 30 December 1921 in Forest Hill, London."]}, {"page": "Society of Women Artists", "response": ["* Caroline Fanny Williams "]}, {"page": "Williams family of painters", "response": ["*Caroline Fanny Williams (1836\u20131921) \u2013 daughter of George Augustus Williams", "Charles Leslie, Caroline Fanny Williams, and Herbert Sidney Percy are probably the best known of the grandchildren of Edward Williams, and their paintings show up regularly at auctions and in galleries.

His first wife Jane Williams exhibited some of her works also. He continued to paint after Jane's death, but after the death of his third wife, who is said to have been close to thirty years his junior, he fell into decline and ruin. He finally left his home in poverty in 1902 to enter a work house, and soon lost contact with family and friends. He died at the age of 71 on 14 April 1906 in a poorhouse in Richmond, Surrey and was buried in a pauper's grave. It is said that his sister Caroline Fanny Williams lived just a short distance away, yet was unaware of her brother's passing.Reynolds (1975), p. 37-38.

Her husband died five years into their marriage, after which she lived first with her father, and then after her father's death with her uncle the artist George Augustus Williams. Many of her works date from the late 1880s and the 1890s when she lived with these mentors, no doubt receiving encouragement from them both. She would have also shared the latter household with her cousin Caroline Fanny Williams, the daughter of her uncle, and an accomplished painter as well. When Kate's uncle died, she and Caroline parted company, and she ran a boarding house for a time, before retiring to Sutton, Surrey, where she died on 15 April 1916 at an address on Collingwood Road.Reynolds (1975), p. 30-31; and "]}, {"page": "List of English women artists", "response": ["*Caroline Fanny Williams (1836\u20131921), landscape painter"]}, {"page": "Caroline Williams (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Caroline Fanny Williams (1839\u20131886), English landscape painter"]}]}}
