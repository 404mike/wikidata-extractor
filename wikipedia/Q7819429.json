Maginnis won and held the seat for the UUP for the next eighteen years until he retired. By this point boundary changes had resulted in a broad 50:50 balance between unionists and nationalists and it was expected that a single unionist candidate would hold the seat in the 2001 general election. James Cooper was nominated by the UUP. On this occasion, however, both the nationalist and unionist votes were to be split. Initially, Maurice Morrow of the DUP was nominated to stand, with the DUP fiercely opposing the UUP's support for the Good Friday Agreement. Morrow then withdrew in favour of Jim Dixon, a survivor of the Enniskillen bombing who stood as an Independent Unionist opposed to the Agreement. Tommy Gallagher of the SDLP ran, but his intervention did not do enough damage to Sinn F\u00e9in. Sinn F\u00e9in's Michelle Gildernew won by 53 votes over Cooper. Subsequently, the result was challenged amid allegations that a polling station had been kept open by force for longer than the deadline, allowing more people to vote, but the courts\u2014while conceding that this happened\u2014did not uphold the challenge, because it held that the votes cast after the legal closing time would not have affected the outcome.Court told of UUP claim of polling irregularities The Free Library, 18 September 2001"]}, {"page": "List of Donegal people", "response": ["*Tommy Gallagher, SDLP politician who was formerly an MLA for Fermanagh and South Tyrone"]}, {"page": "List of members of the 1st Northern Ireland Assembly", "response": ["|Tommy Gallagher", "|Tommy Gallagher"]}, {"page": "Members of the Northern Ireland Forum", "response": ["|Tommy Gallagher", "|Tommy Gallagher"]}, {"page": "List of members of the 3rd Northern Ireland Assembly", "response": ["|Tommy Gallagher", "|Tommy Gallagher"]}, {"page": "Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Assembly constituency)", "response": ["| rowspan=4|Tommy Gallagher(SDLP)", "| align=\"right\" |Tommy GallagherAnthony McGonnellAnne McQuillanVincent CurrieMary Flanagan"]}, {"page": "1997 Northern Ireland local elections", "response": ["| align=\"right\" |Tommy Gallagher"]}, {"page": "1993 Northern Ireland local elections", "response": ["| align=\"right\" |Tommy Gallagher"]}, {"page": "1989 Northern Ireland local elections", "response": ["| align=\"right\" |Tommy Gallagher"]}, {"page": "1985 Northern Ireland local elections", "response": ["| align=\"right\" |Tommy Gallagher"]}, {"page": "Committee for the Environment", "response": ["|  || Tommy Gallagher"]}, {"page": "Thomas Gallagher", "response": ["* Tommy Gallagher (politician) (born 1942), Irish nationalist", "* Tommy Gallagher (rugby league) (born 1983), rugby league player for Leigh Centurions", "* Tommy Gallagher (trainer), boxing trainer seen on TV show The Contender"]}, {"page": "Raymond Gallagher (Gaelic footballer)", "response": ["His father Raymond Snr, a farmer, died in 2007.
