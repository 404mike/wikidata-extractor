His first race commentary was in 1986 at Tweseldown Racecourse in Fleet, Hampshire.  In 1995, he called his first Classic, the St. Leger Stakes at Doncaster Racecourse in South Yorkshire, and as of May 2009, had announced eleven St. Legers, and five Epsom Derbies.  He has also announced multiple Cheltenham Gold Cup and Grand National steeplechase races.\nFollowing the unexpected death of announcer, Luke Kruytbosch, Johnson became the track announcer at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky in January 2009, calling his first Kentucky Derby later that year after being selected amongst five announcers who called different weeks in the 2008 Fall Meet. This made him the first announcer to have called The Epsom Derby and The Kentucky Derby. He also did paddock commentary with Jill Byrne at Churchill Downs. His tenure ended in the Fall Meet of 2013 in what Churchill described as an \"amicable parting\".\nJohnson has covered fences 1/17 - 4/20 and fences 10/26 - Anchor Bridge crossing in the Grand National for ITV on terrestrial television from 2017. He's also covered the race for Racing UK (now Racing TV).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Elephant and Castle", "response": ["* Horse racing announcer Mark Johnson attended the then London College of Printing, receiving a bachelor's degree in television, film, and theatre studies, and a postgraduate diploma in radio journalism."]}, {"page": "Churchill Downs", "response": ["*Mark Johnson (November 26\u201329, 2008, 2009\u20132013)"]}, {"page": "Mark Johnson", "response": ["Mark Johnson may refer to:", "*Mark Johnson (producer) (born 1945), American film producer", "*Mark Johnson, played officer Luke Everett in In the Heat of the Night", "*Mark Johnson, creator of the multimedia music project Playing For Change", "*Mark Johnson (North Carolina politician) (active from 2016), American attorney, educator, and politician", "*Mark Johnson (Oregon politician) (born 1957), American politician", "*Mark Johnson (Minnesota politician), American lawyer, businessman and member of the Minnesota Senate", "*Mark Johnson (Ohio politician), Ohio state representative", "*Mark Johnson (baseball coach), Texas A&M Aggies, Sam Houston State Bearkats ", "*Mark Johnson (catcher) (born 1975), former professional baseball catcher", "*Mark Johnson (first baseman) (born 1967), former professional baseball first baseman", "*Mark Johnson (pitcher) (born 1975), former Major League Baseball pitcher", "*Mark Johnson (umpire) (1950\u20132016), professional baseball umpire", "*Mark Johnson (announcer) (born 1966), British horse racing announcer", "*Mark Johnson (basketball), American basketball coach", "*Mark Johnson (boxer) (born 1971), American boxer", "*Mark Johnson (cricketer, born 1963), American cricketer", "*Mark Johnson (Yorkshire cricketer) (born 1958), former English first-class cricketer", "*Mark Johnson (curler) (born 1958), American-Canadian curler from Edmonton, Alberta", "*Mark Johnson (footballer) (born 1978), Australian rules footballer", "*Mark Johnson (golfer) (born 1954), American professional golfer", "*Mark Johnson (ice hockey) (born 1957), American gold medal winner at 1980 Winter Olympics", "*Mark Johnson (rugby league) (born 1969), South African wing", "*Mark Johnson (wrestler), American former Greco-Roman wrestler and coach", "*Mark Johnson (philosopher) (born 1949), philosophy professor", "*Mark Johnson, chief meteorologist for WEWS-TV"]}, {"page": "ITV Racing", "response": ["| 2017\u2013present || Mark Johnson || Secondary commentator"]}, {"page": "University of Winchester", "response": ["* Mark Johnson \u2013 horse racing commentator"]}, {"page": "ITV Sport", "response": ["* Mark Johnson"]}]}}
