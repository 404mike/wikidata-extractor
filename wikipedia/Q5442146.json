His teaching career began in the Kansas City public school system, followed by a tenure with the Tuskegee Institute from 1931\u20131956. During this period, he appointed a large number of faculty members who later became well known for their work in the field.

Her harmonies are intricate, rooted in the understanding of how dissonance and resolution affect word painting in her songs and instrumental works.  Under the guidance of German born Alexander von Fielitz, Branscombe studied song writing.
