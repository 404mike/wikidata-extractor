A month later Crane made the move to Boston a permanent one. Tony slotted in at centre back for the club, and his never say die attitude, that made him popular at Grimsby, saw him become increasingly popular with United fans. His aerial presence had seen him score several headed goals, and Boston boss Tommy Taylor was able to mould his first team defence around Crane. Despite his performances he became increasingly over weight, even more so than when the problem occurred at Grimsby, and once again he became under fire again by his own club manager. Taylor stated that Tony would find it a huge possibility to return to the professional game. but only if he was able to knuckle down and lose the required weight he had gained. Taylor, also commented that his weight was the reason that Crane received at least a yellow card in nearly every game he played in, mentioning that he was slow on challenging and his big frame would often be used against him when in a tussle with an opponent. Crane continued to play week in week out for The Pilgrims, but continued to struggle to budge any weight, and carried on to put on more bulk as the season ran along.HighBeam Following the close of the 2007\u20132008 season, Crane and Boston parted company. He would remain without a club for the entire 2008\u20132009 season and had turned down an offer to join up with Ilkeston Town to concentrate on his new-found fatherhood. In December following the sacking of Tommy Taylor, Boston's new manager Steve Welsh confirmed the club would like to resign Crane, if he was in a fit enough state to play.http://www.sportsecho.co.uk/football/boston_united/news/displayarticle.php?ID=5871 Crane was present in the club's league game at Frickley Athletic and commented a return to United could be on the cards.http://www.bostonstandard.co.uk/boston-united-news/United-reach-for-Crane-lift.4827927.jp However a deal was never struck and Crane would play no part in the entire season."]}]}}
