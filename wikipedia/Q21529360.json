He stood in the 1906 general election in Wigan, Lancashire. He lost to the Conservative candidate, but polled more votes than the Liberal.\nHe replaced Hubert Sweeney, who had been the Women's Suffrage candidate-elect from 1904 to 1905. Sweeney, a Headmaster for London's Hackney School Board, a trainee barrister and a member of the London Ethical Society, had been chosen by a committee of the North of England Society for Women's Suffrage. The Lancashire and Cheshire Women Textile and Other Workers Representation Committee were a group of suffragists, not suffragettes associated with the Pankhurts' Women's Social and Political Union.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Eva Gore-Booth", "response": ["1902 saw Eva Gore-Booth campaigning at the Clitheroe by-election on behalf of David Shackleton, a Labour candidate that promised Eva he would show support for the women's enfranchisement.  Shackleton was elected yet he did not act upon his promise made to Eva.  This led to the founding of the Lancashire and Cheshire Women Textile and Other Worker's Representation Committee by Eva Gore-Booth, Esther Roper and Sarah Reddish.  The setting up of this committee led to Eva Gore-Booth meeting Christabel Pankhurst who also felt strongly about women's rights.  However, in 1904, Christabel caused some controversy in the Women's Trade Union Council as she attempted to force the council to make women's suffrage one of its aims to which they refused.  This led to the resignation of Eva Gore-Booth from the council. Resigning from that particular council, Eva Gore-Booth alongside Sarah Dickenson who had also resigned, set up the Manchester and Salford Women's Trade and Labour Council.  As part of this council, Eva and other suffragists used constitutional methods of campaigning.  In the general election of 1906, they put forward their own candidate, Thorley Smith yet he was defeated.  In May 1906 Eva was present in the suffrage deputation to Campbell Bannerman.  Her true feeling of helplessness after the failure of this deputation was captured in two poems, which she wrote.  These poems were titled 'Women's Trades on the Embankment' and 'A Lost Opportunity'."]}, {"page": "Standish, Greater Manchester", "response": ["* Thorley Smith, (1873\u2013?), politician"]}, {"page": "Helen Silcock", "response": ["== Involvement in Thorley Smith's Parliamentary Campaign ==", "Led by Helen Silcock, the Wigan Weavers, Winders, Reelers and Beamers Association, organised and promoted Thorley Smith\u2019s campaign to stand for Parliament in the 1906 General Election in Wigan, Lancashire.
