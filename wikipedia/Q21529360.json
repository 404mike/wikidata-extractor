He stood in the 1906 general election in Wigan, Lancashire. He lost to the Conservative candidate, but polled more votes than the Liberal.\nHe replaced Hubert Sweeney, who had been the Women's Suffrage candidate-elect from 1904 to 1905. Sweeney, a Headmaster for London's Hackney School Board, a trainee barrister and a member of the London Ethical Society, had been chosen by a committee of the North of England Society for Women's Suffrage. The Lancashire and Cheshire Women Textile and Other Workers Representation Committee were a group of suffragists, not suffragettes associated with the Pankhurts' Women's Social and Political Union.", "link_mentions": {}}}
