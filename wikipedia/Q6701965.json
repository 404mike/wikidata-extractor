The picture produced by Fildes showed a line of homeless people applying for tickets to stay overnight in the workhouse.

Her known family connections were Welsh rather than Irish, so her  parents may simply have been visiting Ireland. She married William Fildes, a reed maker, on 18 March 1808 in Stockport, England. They had eight children, James Fildes, father of Luke Fildes (1808); Samuel Fildes (1809), George FIldes (1810), Robert Fildes (1815), Sarah (1816), Thomas Paine Fildes (1818), Henry Hunt Fildes (1819), and John Cartwright Fildes (1821).", "==Later years, and Luke Fildes==", "Mary Fildes' later years were relatively comfortable. By 1846 she was a widow living in Glasgow, possibly with relatives of her husband. In 1849 she inherited from her mother four houses in Chester, a county town on the Welsh borders, where she moved. There is no evidence that she became a pub landlady, but her house was at one time listed as a spirit vault, most likely indicating that the cellar was rented out to a distiller. In 1854 she travelled to Liverpool, home of her indigent son James and his Irish wife, and brought her eleven-year-old grandson Luke Fildes to live with her in Chester. She was able to pay for him to attend classes at Warrington School of Art, setting him up to be one of Victorian England's most famous painters. She died of bronchitis in Manchester on 3 April 1876, aged 87, a pioneer of women's politics."]}, {"page": "Fildes (surname)", "response": ["* Luke Fildes (1843\u20131927), British painter", "* Luke Fildes (fencer) (1879\u20131970), British fencer"]}, {"page": "Gustavus Murray", "response": ["Gustavus Charles Philip Murray (1831 \u2013 7 August 1887) was a British obstetrician who may have been the inspiration for Luke Fildes' 1891 painting The Doctor.
