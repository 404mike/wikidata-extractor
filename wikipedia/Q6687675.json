He commanded the 3rd Canadian Division during some of the bitterest battles of the war, taking over in 1916 after his predecessor, Malcolm Mercer, was killed. He himself was killed in action less than a month before the end of the war during a reconnaissance mission observing German positions along the River Selle.\nA highly experienced officer, Lipsett had previously seen action in the Tirah Campaign and the Second Boer War with the British Army, serving as an officer with the Royal Irish Regiment. He was later instrumental in developing military training and education throughout Canada and expanding the shore defences of British Columbia in response to the threat of the German East Asian Cruiser Squadron under von Spee. An experienced and capable officer, Lipsett was popular with both his men and his superiors and his death was considered \"a deplorable loss to the Division\".", "link_mentions": {}}}
