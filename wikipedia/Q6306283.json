One of them is Donald Radlet (John Duttine), who stars in both The Mallen Streak and The Mallen Girls. Thomas Mallen, penniless, mortgages his farming estate to make ends meet; he attempts to get his only legitimate son, Richard Mallen (David Rintoul) married to Fanny Armstrong, an unattractive girl with a rich father. Richard struggles to get Fanny to marry him, since they dislike each other, but her dowry would save Richard and Thomas from losing their big house and property. However, the plan fails due to a servant unintentionally revealing that Richard was only marrying Fanny for her money and that he didn't like her, and Richard losing his temper. He shoots and kills a visiting bailiff in the process, causing Thomas Mallen to be declared bankrupt and to lose everything. This forces Thomas to move into a small cottage, with his late wife's nieces Barbara (Pippa Guard) and Constance (Julia Chambers) and their Governess Anna Brigmore (Caroline Blakiston), who starts an affair with the now bankrupt Squire. Some time after this, Donald and his half brother Matthew Radlet (Ian Saynor) come to the cottage to visit Donald's father (their mother, whom Thomas raped in order to conceive Donald, is now married to Matthew's father, a stern farmer). Donald and Matthew then take a romantic interest in Barbara and Constance. While Donald is courting Barbara, he is also secretly trying to take Constance away from Matthew, who is in love with her (though his parents do not wish either brother to marry, since Matthew is consumptive and the family farm is not prosperous enough to support extra family members). Donald eventually achieves this aim, winning Constance and leaving both Matthew and Barbara in the lurch."]}, {"page": "Fanny by Gaslight (TV series)", "response": ["* Julia Chambers - Lucy Beckett"]}, {"page": "Warblington School", "response": ["* Julia Chambers, actress"]}]}}
