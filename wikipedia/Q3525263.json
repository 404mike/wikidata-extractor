As she became older, Knowles' hearing began to fail such that she had to rely on an ear trumpet. Despite her deafness she would still attend meetings but she would signal when she thought that had been sufficient talk by putting down her hearing device. Knowles cared for and added to the National Museum Herbarium collection although never got the credit she deserved. In 1923 she planned to retire but pneumonia ended her life before she ended her career. Knowles died in Dublin on 27 April 1933."]}]}}
