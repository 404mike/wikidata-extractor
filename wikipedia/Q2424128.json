Piggott suggested that it was Aubrey's manuscript that first brought Avebury to Stukeley's attention. Circa 1718, Stukeley first visited the site, accompanied by the Gale brothers. In 1719, he visited again, also taking in Stonehenge before traveling to Oxford to meet Thomas Hearne, an antiquarian who was highly critical of Stukeley.

Prior to this is it is likely that the book was in the possession of Thomas Gale, the headmaster of St Paul's School, London.

It was also investigated and detailed by fellow antiquarian William Stukeley, who noted that it was once a chambered tomb in his posthumously published Itinerarium Curiosum of 1776. Stukeley had been informed that many of the stones in the monument had been pulled down in the late 17th century. By the early 19th century, the site was being erroneously associated with the ancient druids, and by the middle of the century was associated with the folkloric tale of the countless stones, thus gaining the actual moniker of \"the Countless Stones\". In 1887, it became a scheduled ancient monument."]}, {"page": "Kit's Coty House", "response": ["The antiquarian John Aubrey made mention of the monument in his unpublished manuscript on British archaeological sites, the Monumenta Britannica.

Smith undertook his edition under the influence of Thomas Gale, encouraged by Ralph Thoresby, and with assistance of Humfrey Wanley on Old English.
