This collecting fashion led to the formation of natural history societies, exhibitions of private collections, and journals for recording communications and the documentation of new species. Many of the collectors tended to be from the aristocracy and it spawned off a trade involving collectors around the world and traders. This has been called the \"era of heroic entomology.\" William Kirby is widely considered as the father of entomology in England. In collaboration with William Spence, he published a definitive entomological encyclopedia, Introduction to Entomology, regarded as the subject's foundational text. He also helped to found the Royal Entomological Society in London in 1833, one of the earliest such societies in the world; earlier antecedents, such as the Aurelian society date back to the 1740s. In the late 19th century, the growth of agriculture, and colonial trade, spawned off the \"era of economic entomology\" which created the professional entomologist associated with the rise of the university and training in the field of biology."]}, {"page": "Kew", "response": ["*Joshua Kirby (1716\u20131774) was a landscape painter, engraver, and writer, whose main artistic focus was \"linear perspective\", based on the ideas of English mathematician Brook Taylor.See a short literary biography of Joshua Kirby in Gentleman's Magazine (ed.

In 1805, Kirby dedicated the Omphalapion hookerorum, a species of weevil, to him and his brother Joseph: \"I am indebted to an excellent naturalist, Mr. W. J. Hooker, of Norwich, who first discovered it, for this species. Many other nondescripts have been taken by him and his brother, Mr. J.
