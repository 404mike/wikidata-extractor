J. Abrams and Damon Lindelof got along with a team of four writers\u2014Javier Grillo-Marxuach, Paul Dini, Jennifer M. Johnson and Christian Taylor\u2014to elaborate ideas on how the show could continue. The resulting \"Writer's Guide\" plus a positive reaction to the pilot made ABC pick up the show. The season one writing begun on May 2004, with the first episode being centered on Kate and following the guidelines of a self-contained script grounded in reality. The script, credited to Lindelof, was finished by June. It was the first episode directed by Jack Bender, who came to the show following an invitation by Abrams. The episode is named \"Tabula Rasa\" after the Latin term meaning \"blank slate\", a concept attributed to the philosopher John Locke regarding how he believed humans are born without built-in mental content, then filled through their life experiences. Said concept is echoed by the final line of the episode, where Jack suggests the crash made the survivors into blank slates that could restart."]}, {"page": "White Rabbit (Lost)", "response": ["\"White Rabbit\" is the fifth episode of the first season of Lost. The episode was directed by Kevin Hooks and written by Christian Taylor. It first aired on October 20, 2004, on ABC.", "\"White Rabbit\" aired on October 20, 2004. The episode was directed by Kevin Hooks and written by Christian Taylor. Taylor declared the underlying message was of \"a man's journey to find out who he really is\", in how solving Jack's conflicted relationship with his father gave him an excuse to reinvent himself and was \"integrated into what Jack becomes in the context of the series\". Showrunner Damon Lindelof was enthused about working with the episode, even if \"it did not end with a big shocking twist or surprise\" like predecessor \"Walkabout\". Lindelof was particularly positive about \"this great scene between Jack and Locke in the woods,\" which still influenced the characters' later discussions about faith, such as in the fourth-season finale \"There's No Place Like Home\"."]}, {"page": "Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series", "response": ["| Alan Ball, Robert Greenblatt, David Janollari and Alan Poul, executive producers; Bruce Eric Kaplan and Christian Williams, co-executive producers; Laurence Andries, Scott Buck and Rick Cleveland, supervising producers; Joey Soloway (as Jill Soloway) and Christian Taylor, producers"]}, {"page": "Showboy", "response": ["Showboy is a 2002 mockumentary film that was produced by star Jason Buchtel, directed by stars Christian Taylor and Lindy Heymann, written by and starring the three.
