Founding members also included Basil Henriques, Sir Brunel Cohen, Joseph Leftwich, Louis Gluckstein, and Rabbi Israel Mattuck.

They held that the solution to problems faced by the Jewish community would be found in the revival of religious principles rather than political ones. By 1947, Leftwich felt that Hyamson was trying to turn the Fellowship into an organisation similar to Judah Magnes' Ihud (which sought Jewish-Arab co-operation for a bi-national unitary state).Miller, 2013 pp. 82 & 182"]}, {"page": "List of members of London County Council 1949\u20131965", "response": ["Louis Gluckstein(elected unopposed 21 July 1955)", "|Louis Gluckstein", "|Louis Gluckstein*"]}, {"page": "St Marylebone (London County Council constituency)", "response": ["|rowspan=3| Louis Gluckstein", ":Louis Gluckstein elected unopposed 1955"]}, {"page": "Edward Halliday", "response": ["During World War II, Halliday served in the Royal Air Force in Bomber Command.
