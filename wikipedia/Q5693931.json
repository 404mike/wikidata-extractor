The team is administrated by England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB); they played their first Tests in 1934\u201335, when they beat Australia 2\u20130 in a three-Test series. Their current captain is Heather Knight. There is also an England Women's Academy team, consisting of players just below the full England squad.", "Following on from the disappointment of not winning the world Twenty20, England headed to India for the 2013 Women's Cricket World Cup, defending their 2009 title. England added Georgia Elwiss to their squad from the World Twenty20, and were in Group A with Sri Lanka, West Indies and hosts India. England's tournament got off to a disastrous start, losing a thrilling match to the unfancied Sri Lanka. Sarah Taylor, Laura Marsh and Anya Shrubsole all missed the game injured, and Sri Lanka won the toss and inserted England to bat. The toss would prove crucial many times in this tournament, as the early start times meant that batting during the first hour was extremely difficult, and so it proved in this match, with Charlotte Edwards, Danielle Wyatt and Lydia Greenway all out within the first eight overs. Arran Brindle (31) and Heather Knight (38) lead the recovery, but as soon as England had gained the ascendancy they were both dismissed. It was left to vice-captain Jenny Gunn and debutant Amy Jones to get England to a defendable score, and they did, with Gunn making 52 and Jones 41. Some late hitting from Katherine Brunt and Danielle Hazell lifted England to 238\u20138, and it seemed as though the disaster the early wickets had promised had been averted. Sri Lanka however pulled off a stunning victory, Chamari Athapaththu scoring 62, and supported by Mendis and Siriwardene, put Sri Lanka in an extremely strong position. Brunt and Elwiss struck back for England, before a brutal 56 from Eshani Lokusuriyage took Sri Lanka to within a run of victory. She was run out in the final over, but Dilani Manodara hit the final ball of the match from Elwiss for six as Sri Lanka won by just one wicket, their first every victory over England.", "The Ashes began with the four-day Test match at Wormsley, with Australia making strong progress on the first day, reaching 243\u20133 at the close on a slow pitch. This was extended to 331-6 declared before lunch on the second day, Sarah Elliott completing her maiden Test century. Arran Brindle departed early, but a flowing fifty partnership from Heather Knight and Sarah Taylor put England in the ascendancy. Taylor was dismissed by Holly Ferling as England dramatically slumped to 113-6 and were in sudden danger of being forced to follow on. That they did not was due to a partnership of 156 between Knight and Laura Marsh, which ultimately saw England cede only a lead of 17 to Australia. Knight, in only her second Test, scored 157 in nearly seven hours of chanceless batting, winning her the player of the match award. Marsh's innings, 55 off 304 balls and 343 minutes, was one of the slowest international fifties recorded but helped England escape from the trouble they were in. From the close of England's 1st innings the match petered out into a draw, the slow pitch preventing either side from forcing victory.", "| Heather Knight ||  || Right-handed bat || Right-arm off spin || Western Storm || 8 || 107 || 81 || 5 || Central", "| 10 || Heather Knight || 2011\u20132022 || 9 || 16 || 697 || 49.78 || 168* || 3 || 2", "| 4 || Heather Knight || 168* || 294 || 17 || 1 || Australia || 27 January 2022", "| 8 || Heather Knight || 157 || 338 || 20 || 0 || Australia || 11 August 2013", "| 7 || Heather Knight || 2010\u2013 || 112", "| 4 || Heather Knight || 2010\u2013 || 112 || 107 || 3,223 || 38.36 || 106 || 22 || 2", "| 8 || Heather Knight || 2010\u2013 || 87", "| 6 || Heather Knight || 2010\u2013 || 87 || 76 || 1,389 || 23.15 || 108* || 118.11 || 4 || 1 || 143 || 23", "| 3 || Heather Knight || 108* || 66 || 13 || 4 || 163.63 || Thailand || 26 February 2020"]}, {"page": "Plymstock School", "response": ["* Heather Knight \u2013 cricketer"]}, {"page": "The Women's Ashes", "response": ["|align=left|Heather Knight ||  || 32 ||977|| 30.53 || 157 || 1 || 7"]}, {"page": "Lord's Taverners", "response": ["* Girls' Cricket - the Lady Taverners U13 and U15 indoor (schools) and outdoor (clubs) girls' cricket competitions have given over 110,000 girls the opportunity to enjoy competitive cricket providing a framework to play at an informal and more competitive level.
