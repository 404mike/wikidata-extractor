Worcestershire declared their first innings at 388/1 (Turner 202*) and eventually won by an innings, so Senghera did not get to bat, but he claimed five wickets in the match, his maiden scalp being that of Peter Hayes. A couple of weeks later he played against Oxford University and did even better, taking 8\u2013108 in the match; his first-innings 5-81 remained his only five-wicket haul. He made no further county appearances that year, but did turn out (albeit rather ineffectually) for DH Robins' XI against the Pakistanis at Eastbourne."]}, {"page": "Peter Hayes", "response": ["Peter Hayes may refer to:", "* Peter Hayes (actor) (born 1957), Australian actor and director", "* Peter Hayes (cricketer) (born 1954), former English cricketer", "* Peter Hayes (died 2001), Australian horse trainer, son of Colin Hayes", "* Peter Hayes (diplomat) (born 1963), British diplomat", "* Peter Hayes (footballer) (born 1938), Australian footballer for Collingwood", "* Peter Hayes (historian), Holocaust historian", "* Peter Hayes (lawyer) (1953\u20132007), Australian barrister", "* Peter Hayes (musician) (born 1976), American indie rock guitarist and singer", "* Peter Hayes (sculptor) (born 1946)"]}]}}
