Although himself born in England, Mansergh's forefathers were part of the Anglo-Irish Protestant Ascendancy and arrived in Ireland with Oliver Cromwell. He was raised in England and lived in the Cambridgeshire town of Little Shelford. He was educated at The King's School, Canterbury and Christ Church, Oxford, studying Politics, Philosophy and Economics and obtaining a Doctorate in philosophy for a study of pre-revolutionary French history. An Anglican, Mansergh is a member of the Church of Ireland. He sat on the board of Bolton Library for several years."]}, {"page": "Extern minister", "response": ["James G. Douglas, chair of the constitution drafting committee, proposed extern ministers on the model of the Swiss Federal Council.Mansergh 1934, pp.158\u2013160; Cahillane 2016 p.128 Leo Kohn suggested a precursor was the \"Directors\" created outside the 1919 D\u00e1il Cabinet by the First D\u00e1il, but Nicholas Mansergh disagreed and Brian Farrell felt the 1919 model was UK junior ministers (parliamentary secretaries). The idea of extern ministers was first mooted as a way of placating republicans opposed to the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty on which the Free State was founded. It would have allowed republicans to hold ministries in a national unity government without their having to take the Oath of Allegiance which the Treaty required of members the Oireachtas (parliament). The draft constitution provided for an Executive Council of twelve, of whom four, including the President and Vice President, must be members of the D\u00e1il; of the other eight, at most three might be members of the D\u00e1il or Seanad (upper house).Malone 1929, p.369  However, British government objections meant the proposal was altered, and extern ministers were required to take the Oath and, though nominated by the D\u00e1il, were appointed by the Governor General. These monarchist changes were unacceptable to republicans."]}, {"page": "Round Table movement", "response": ["*Sir Nicholas Mansergh"]}, {"page": "61st Infantry Division (United Kingdom)", "response": ["McMahon commented that the SIS had a history of \"furnish[ing] unreliable information on the IRA's foreign intrigues\", but these past failures were ignored as the reports reinforced the fears of invasion. McMahon suggested that \"It is even possible that the plans discovered in Holland were planted. Whether deliberate deception or not, British intelligence was well and truly deceived.\" Historian Eunan O'Halpin argued that while the Dutch document could be seen as a British fabrication, \"it is now known\u00a0... that German deception operations prepared in anticipation of Operation 'Sealion' included the manufacturing of rumours and stories of plans to attack Ireland as a feint during the build up to an invasion of Southern England\". Nicholas Mansergh commented that \"Ireland had no place\" in the initial Sealion plans, and it was not until 3 December 1940 that German planners even looked at the possibility before concluding that such an operation was not possible or if launched would result in failure. In his memoirs, Carton de Wiart commented \"I can never believe the Germans had any intention of invading Ireland but I am very grateful for any reason which sent us there, for it was an ideal training ground for troops and the division improved enormously from the moment of our arrival.\""]}, {"page": "The Abbey School (Tipperary)", "response": ["*Nicholas Mansergh (1910\u201391)"]}, {"page": "Philip Nicholas Seton Mansergh", "response": ["#REDIRECT Nicholas Mansergh"]}, {"page": "Mansergh, Nicholas", "response": ["#REDIRECT Nicholas Mansergh"]}, {"page": "History of Ireland", "response": ["*Nicholas Mansergh, Ireland in the Age of Reform and Revolution 1940"]}]}}
