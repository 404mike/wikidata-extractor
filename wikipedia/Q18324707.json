In the number for 2 June 1727 appeared the first part of the familiar dialect-dialogue of The Exmoor Scolding, and the second part was printed in the issue for 25 August 1727. This piece has often been printed with the addition of An Exmoor Courtship. These works are generally attributed to a \"Peter Lock\" of North-Moulton, but Brice finished the Courtship and edited the first and several other editions. James Davidson in his Bibliotheca Devoniensis assigns to Brice the authorship of the ironical A Short Essay on the Scheme lately set on foot for lighting and keeping clean the Streets of the City of Exeter, demonstrating its pernicious and fatal effects (1755). In 1738 he wrote the Mobiad, or Battle of the Voice, an heroi-comic poem, being a description of an Exeter election but it was not printed until 1770, when he styled himself on the title-page \"Democritus Juvenal, Moral Professor of Ridicule, and Plaguy Pleasant Professor of Stingtickle College, vulgarly Andrew Brice, Exon.\" "]}, {"page": "James Davidson (antiquary)", "response": ["#REDIRECT James Davidson (antiquarian)"]}]}}
