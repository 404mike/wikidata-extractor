In 1839 he published a two-volume memoir; this, alongside those published by O'Brien's shipmate Ashworth and by Edward Boys, served as the basis for Frederick Marryat's novel Peter Simple, whose title character was a Royal Navy midshipman. O'Brien would see no further active service but was promoted to rear-admiral on the reserve list on 8 March 1852. He died at Yew House, Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, on 13 May 1857 and was commemorated in a memorial window in St Augustine's Church, Broxbourne."]}]}}
