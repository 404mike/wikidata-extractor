This was an ideal site for the factory because all the raw materials could be transported there by the waterways and railway, and the finished products could similarly be transported anywhere else in the country or overseas. Further chemical factories were soon built nearby by entrepreneurs including John McClellan, William Gossage, Frederic Muspratt, Holbrook Gaskell and Henry Deacon.  The town grew rapidly as housing and social provision was made for the factory workers. Soon the villages of Farnworth, Appleton, Ditton and Upton were subsumed within the developing town of Widnes. Woodend became known as West Bank. The substances produced included soap, borax, soda ash, salt cake and bleaching powder. Other industries developed including iron and copper works.  The town became heavily polluted with smoke and the by-products of the chemical processes.  In 1888 the town was described as \"the dirtiest, ugliest and most depressing town in England\"Daily News quoted by  and in 1905 as a \"poisonous hell-town\".Daily Mail quoted in ", "William Gossage (1799\u20131877) was a chemical manufacturer who established a soap making business in Widnes.

One of his interests was to attempt to recover sulfur from alkali waste. At the same time William Gossage was working at the same project at his factory in Widnes. In 1859, at the age of 25, Hargreaves moved to Widnes and worked for Gossage.  Here he made his first two important discoveries; the recovery of chromates which were used in the bleaching of fats and oils, and a method of bleaching brown soap.  He was also involved with developing the process for making the commercially successful blue mottled soap.
