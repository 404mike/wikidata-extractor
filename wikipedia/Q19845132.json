Davies then became player-manager of Southern League side Yeovil Town, before in 1965 he was appointed Swansea Town manager,  with Yeovil receiving a fee in the region of \u00a31,250 as compensation.After his spell as manager for Swansea City, he was player-coach at Pembroke Borough.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Yeovil Town F.C.", "response": ["|1964\u201365|| Glyn Davies"]}, {"page": "Swansea City A.F.C.", "response": ["Following relegation, Trevor Morris, who had been manager since 1958, was sacked and Glyn Davies, a former Swansea player, was appointed in his place. Davies re-signed the 36-year-old Ivor Allchurch from Cardiff City, but despite winning the Welsh Cup, the season saw some of the club's heaviest defeats, and the manager only lasted the season. Relegation to Division Four followed in 1967 and Ivor Allchurch retired. The 1967\u201368 season saw the record attendance of 32,796 at the Vetch Field for an FA Cup Fourth Round match against Arsenal."]}, {"page": "Ivor Allchurch", "response": ["At the age of 35, Allchurch returned to his hometown club Swansea Town in 1965, after they agreed a fee of \u00a38000 with Cardiff to complete the transfer. His return to Vetch Field saw a significant increase in the sale of season tickets and Allchurch was greeted by a large \"welcome home Ivor\" banner in his first game on his return. However, early season form was poor as the side struggled to adapt to a new \"modern\" gameplan adopted by manager Glyn Davies, losing 3 of their first 4 matches. Allchurch handed the club their first win of the season, scoring the only goal of the game during a 1\u20130 victory over Grimsby Town but, by October, the club were struggling at the foot of the table. In December 1965, First Division side Northampton Town offered \u00a311,000 to sign Allchurch but he himself rejected the offer saying it was \"flattering\" but that he was \"happy to be back with Swansea\". The following month, in the New Years honours list in 1966, Allchurch was awarded an MBE for his services to sport. The club finished the season in the bottom half of the table but did win the Welsh Cup, defeating Chester City in the final with Allchurch scoring the winning goal.", "Swansea's troubles continued the following season, amassing just six points during the first third of the season and suffering a 5\u20131 aggregate defeat against Bulgarian side Slavia Sofia in the opening round of the European Cup Winners' Cup, with the club board accusing some players of a \"lack of effort\". Glyn Davies' contract as manager was cancelled by mutual consent and long serving club trainer Joe Sykes was temporarily appointed manager with Allchurch part of his selection committee. Sykes also handed the club captaincy to Allchurch, replacing Brian Purcell, but the club eventually suffered relegation to the Fourth Division at the end of the 1966\u201367 season. He remained with the club, entering the final year of his contract, but was switched to playing as a striker by manager Billy Lucas in order to lessen the amount of running required of Allchurch who had turned 38 during the opening months of the season. The change of position benefited him, scoring seventeen times in the league in forty matches. Approaching the end of the season, he was offered a one-year extension to his contract with the club, with a \u00a35 per week pay cut, but eventually decided to retire from professional football, making his final appearance on 6 May 1968 against Hartlepools United. He retired from professional football as Swansea's all-time record goalscorer. He later spent time playing non-league football with Worcester City and had a spell as player-manager of Haverfordwest County before ending his career at Pontardawe Athletic at the age of 50."]}, {"page": "1932 in Wales", "response": ["*31 May \u2013 Glyn Davies, footballer (died 2013)"]}]}}
