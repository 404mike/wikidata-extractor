On the casting of Armitage, Jackson was quoted as saying, \"Richard is one of the most exciting and dynamic actors working on screen today and we know he is going to make an amazing Thorin Oakenshield. We cannot wait to start this adventure with him and feel very lucky that one of the most beloved characters in Middle Earth is in such good hands.\" McTavish was quoted on his casting, \"I think that I would be very lucky indeed if ever again in my career, I was offered an opportunity that was going to be so iconic in its influence and scale with regards to The Hobbit. I can't think of anything comparable.\" On the casting of Turner, Jackson stated, \"Aidan is a wonderfully gifted young actor who hails from Ireland. I'm sure he will bring enormous heart and humor to the role of K\u00edli.\" On the casting of Hadlow, Jackson said, \"I have worked with Mark Hadlow on many projects [Meet the Feebles and King Kong]; he is a fantastic actor. I am thrilled to be working with [him] on these movies.\" Hadlow also plays Bert the Stone-troll. Callen stated, \"I did wonder about my casting and how they had made the choice\u2014maybe the long hair and the beard sold it, I thought. But now that has all gone. Given that \u00d3in is almost 200\u00a0years old I can presume only that it was the age.\" Hunter said, \"Being cast in The Hobbit is really exciting and really an honour. I auditioned for the original Lord of the Rings way back when I signed with my agent in New Zealand.
