She is now a qualified solicitor.\nBorn in Cardiff but brought up in Dinas Powys by solicitor father John (Grandy) and tennis coach mother Pam (Nanny), Loosemore played on the WTA from the late 1980s until 1992. She was the youngest female British competitor at Wimbledon at age 17 in 1988. And before that played in junior Wimbledon for a number of years prior. In 1990, she played the 3rd round the International Australia (beaten by Helena Sukov\u00e1), her best performance in a Grand Slam event.\nAfter tennis, Loosemore studied at the University of Oxford for a psychology degree. There she met Chad Lion-Cachet, a Dutch-national former Oxford University rugby union captain and a South African under 21 international.\nLoosemore also presented an HTV programme in 1991 and 1992 called 'Get Going', the show involved numerous sports activities to inspire the Welsh public to get active in their spare time. The couple married and moved to Surrey, and after the birth of their first child Samuel (Sammy)in 2000 Loosemore became a full-time mother. The couple now have three children, the youngest of whom was born in 2006, and live in Oxford, while Loosemore still plays amateur tennis for South Wales.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bishop of Llandaff Church in Wales High School", "response": ["* Sarah Loosemore Tennis player"]}, {"page": "Naoko Sawamatsu", "response": ["|  Sarah Loosemore"]}, {"page": "Dinas Powys", "response": ["*Sarah Loosemore (born 1971) - tennis player, at 17 the youngest British woman to play at the Wimbledon championships, raised in the village"]}, {"page": "1990 Wimbledon Championships", "response": ["#  Barbara Paulus (First round, lost to Sarah Loosemore)"]}, {"page": "Monique Javer", "response": ["Javer began her 1988 season strongly by reaching the second round of the Australian Open. This was the first time she had won a match in the main draw of a Grand Slam. She then went on to reach the second round of the newly categorised Tier V WTA event in Auckland, New Zealand. In April she won three matches to qualify for the Suntory Japan Open, the third of which was against compatriot, Sarah Loosemore. In the main draw she beat Barbara Gerken in the first round to set up a clash with top seed and world No.13, Natasha Zvereva. Javer caused a huge upset by beating Zvereva in straight sets, 7\u20136(3), 6\u20132, to reach the quarterfinals where she was beaten by world No.28, Stephanie Rehe, 5\u20137, 1\u20136. Immediately following this result, Monique caused another shock by winning the title at the tier V WTA tournament in Singapore. Despite being unseeded Javer beat the world No.30 and No.3 seed, Dianne Balestrat, in the semifinals, 6\u20130, 6\u20131. She went on to beat the No.4 seed, Leila Meskhi, in the final, 7\u20136(3), 6\u20133.
