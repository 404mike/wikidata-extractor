He played for Coleraine and Glentoran, winning the Irish Cup with Glentoran in 1933, before winning a move to English club Blackpool later in the year. He was sold to Manchester City in February 1936 for a fee of \u00a310,000 and helped the club to win the First Division title for the first time in the 1936\u201337 season. The outbreak of World War II cost him the chance to play competitive football during his peak years and he was transferred to Derby County as the war drew to a close. He won the FA Cup with Derby, scoring in the 1946 FA Cup final victory over Charlton Athletic. He moved on to Huddersfield Town later in the year.\nIn April 1949, he was appointed player-manager of Doncaster Rovers and was also top-scorer as the club won the Third Division North title during the 1949\u201350 season. The club then spent the next seven seasons in the Second Division, before he resigned in January 1958. He also worked as Northern Ireland's first national team manager from October 1951 to May 1962. He used his position to help Doncaster to sign talented Irish players, whilst helping his nation to qualify for the 1958 FIFA World Cup, where they reached the quarter-finals. He spent 1958 to 1960 as manager of Bristol City. He later scouted for Liverpool and was in the first group of 22 players to be inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bristol City F.C.", "response": ["| Peter Doherty"]}, {"page": "Manchester City F.C.", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:left;\"|  Peter Doherty           || FW (inside left)", "| style=\"text-align:left;\"|  Peter Doherty || inside left || player || "]}, {"page": "Huddersfield Town A.F.C.", "response": ["*/ Peter Doherty", "*  Peter Doherty", "*  Peter Doherty"]}, {"page": "Blackpool F.C.", "response": ["| Peter Doherty || 1934\u20131936 || 4 || 0"]}, {"page": "Bill Shankly", "response": ["In his autobiography, Shankly wrote that Preston had more than held their own in the 1934\u201335 season and the club was not relegated again until the end of the 1948\u201349 season in which he left them.
