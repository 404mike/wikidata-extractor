He won two league championship medals and a runners-up medal in the 1928 FA Cup Final with Huddersfield before becoming manager Leslie Knighton's first signing for Birmingham, where he made nearly 300 appearances and won another FA Cup runners-up medal, in 1931. On leaving Birmingham Barkas followed Knighton to Chelsea, returning to the Midlands on the outbreak of the Second World War.He came from a footballing family: his brother Sam played for and captained England, a cousin, Billy Felton, also played for England, and three other brothers Tommy, James and Harry were professional footballers.

To the disappointment of Third Division North clubs Chesterfield and Hartlepools United, who had made \"good offers\" for his services, the trial proved successful. Lilley made his Football League debut on Christmas Day 1922, standing in for right-back Ned Barkas for a First Division match against Birmingham that finished goalless.
