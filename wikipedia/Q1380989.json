He held the IBU world flyweight title in 1916, the EBU European flyweight title twice; firstly in 1914 and again from 1916 to 1917, the BBBofC British flyweight title in 1916 and the National Sporting Club's British flyweight title from 1916 to 1918. Often regarded as the greatest British fighter of all time, he was the first official world flyweight champion and was rated by American boxing writer Nat Fleischer, as well as many other professionals and fans including former boxer, trainer, manager and promoter, Charley 'Broadway' Rose, as \"the Greatest Flyweight Boxer Ever\". Wilde earned various nicknames such as, \"The Mighty Atom,\" \"Ghost with the Hammer in His Hand\" and \"The Tylorstown Terror\" due to his bludgeoning punching power. While reigning as the world's greatest flyweight, Wilde would take on bantamweights and even featherweights, and knock them out. As well as his professional career, Wilde participated in 151 bouts judged as 'newspaper decisions', of these the results were: Won 7 and lost 1, with 143 being declared as 'no decisions'. Wilde has the third longest recorded unbeaten streak in boxing history, having gone 92\u20130\u20131. Behind Packey McFarland who went 106\u20131\u20136 losing only his 9th fight and going another 104 unbeaten and behind Young Griffo who was 7\u20131\u20133 early on and bringing his record up to 79\u20131\u201338 going 107 fights unbeaten.", "link_mentions": {}}}
