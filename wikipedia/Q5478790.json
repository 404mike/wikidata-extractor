A History of Spain and Portugal, Vol. 2, Ch. 25, p. 632 (Print Edition: University of Wisconsin Press, 1973) (LIBRARY OF IBERIAN RESOURCES ONLINE Accessed May 30, 2007) The historian Mary Vincent has argued that the Catholic Church was an active element in the polarising politics of the years preceding the Spanish Civil War.  Similarly, Frances Lannon asserts that, \"Catholic identity has usually been virtually synonymous with conservative politics in some form or other, ranged from extreme authoritarianism through gentler oligarchic tendencies to democratic reformism.\" ", "Spain entered the 20th century a predominantly agrarian nation \u2013 a nation which, moreover, had lost its colonies. It was marked by uneven social and cultural development between town and country, between regions, within classes.  'Spain was not one country but a number of countries and regions marked by their uneven historical development.'Ronald Fraser, quoted in Blood of Spain, p.38 From the turn of the 20th century, however, there had been a significant advance in industrial development. Between 1910 and 1930 the industrial working class more than doubled to over 2,500,000. Those engaged in agriculture fell from 66 per cent to 45 per cent in the same period.  The coalition hoped to concentrate its major reforms on three sectors : the 'latifundist aristocracy', the church and the army \u2013 though the attempt would come at a moment of world economic crisis.  In the south less than 2 per cent of all landowners had over two-thirds of the land, while 750,000 labourers eked out a living on near starvation wages.  The country was 'prone to centrifugal tendencies', for example there was a tension between Catalan and Basque nationalist sentiment away from an agrarian and centralist ruling class in Madrid.The Blood of Spain Ronald Fraser p.35, 37 Moreover, whilst all Spain was Catholic by formal definition, in practice Catholic identity varied, affected by factors that ranged from region, to social strata, to the ownership of property, to age, and sex. General patterns were ones of higher levels of Catholic practice throughout much of the north and low levels in the south - (\"the very regions of the final expulsion of the Moors and Catholic reconquest in the 15th century seems never to have been truly conquered for the Church.\"),Frances Lannon, Privilege, Persecution and prophecy, p.14 and higher levels of Catholic practice amongst peasant smallholders than landless peasant labourers. Further, \"the urban proletariat of Madrid, or Barcelona, or Bilbao, or Valencia, or Seville or the mining centres of the Asturias rarely entered a church ..the Church and its affairs were simply alien to urban working-class culture. As Canon Arboleya put it in his famous analysis in 1933, the dimensions of the problem were those of mass apostasy, especially among the urban working classes.\"M.Arboleya Martinez, La apostasia de las masas, Barcelona 1934", "Gil-Robles was one of the prime beneficiaries of Maura's discomfiture and one of the first to capitalise on it. Following the passage of the 1931 Constitution with its anticlerical clauses Maura (on 14 October 1931) and Alcal\u00e1-Zamora resigned - though their resignations did nothing to reconcile them to the agrarian Catholic right. The position of the Catholic republicans was an isolated one.Frances Lannon, Privilege, Persecution, and Prophecy, 195-197", "The conservative Catholic Republicans Alcal\u00e1-Zamora and Miguel Maura resigned from the governmentFrances Lannon, p.20 The Spanish Civil War, 2002 when the controversial articles 26 and 27 of the constitution, which committed the Spanish government to phasing out state funding of clergy stipends,Lannon, p.14 Privilege, Persecution and Prophecy and strictly controlled Church property and prohibited religious institutes from engaging in education were passed.Smith, Angel, Historical Dictionary of Spain, p. 195, Rowman & Littlefield 2008 Not only advocates of a confessional state but also certain advocates of church/state separation saw the constitution as hostile; one such advocate of separation, Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset, stated \"the article in which the Constitution legislates the actions of the Church seems highly improper to me.\"Paz, Jose Antonio Souto \"Perspectives on religious freedom in Spain\" Brigham Young University Law Review January 1, 2001 Article 26 - \" one of the most divisive articles in the constitution..debarred religious from teaching though not from welfare work.Lannon, p.78 (This attempt to close the religious schools altogether and to keep religious out of the state system was unsuccessful - \"the necessary legislation was only completed in June 1933 to take effect for 1 October 1933. The victory of the Right in elections at the end of 1933 immediately rendered it dead.\")", "In October 1931 Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gil-Robles the leading spokesman of the parliamentary right declared that the constitution was 'stillborn' - a 'dictatorial Constitution in the name of democracy.' Robles wanted to use mass meetings \"to give supporters of the right a sense of their own strength and, ominously, to accustom them 'to fight, when necessary, for the possession of the street.'\"Gil-Robles, No fue posible la paz, quoted in Mary Vincent Catholicism in the Second Spanish Republic, p.182  Frances Lannon characterizes the constitution as creating a secular democratic system based on equal rights for all, with provision for regional autonomy, but also calls the constitution \"divisive\" in that the articles on property and religion had a \"disregard for civil rights\" and ruined the prospect of conservative Catholics Republicans.Frances Lannon, p.20 The Spanish Civil War, 1936-1939  Likewise, Stanley Payne agrees that the constitution generally accorded a wide range of civil liberties and representation with the notable exception of the rights of Catholics, a circumstance which prevented the formation of an expansive democratic majority.", "Frances Lannon, addressing the fears of the Left that Church influence in the schools was a danger to the republic has observed that, \"it was demonstrably the case the ideological ambience and spirit of the congregations was anti-socialist, illiberal, and pervaded with the values of the political Right.\" She gives as one example, \"to convey the wider reality\", a journal kept by a women's community with a prestigious convent school in Seville. It laments, in April 1931, the departure of the King, its wariness of the Republic antedating any moves against the Church, in November 1933 they go to vote, 'a sacred duty', 'in grave circumstances', the Right's victory greeted as 'better than we could have hoped'. The Asturian rising brings forth the declaration that 'the conduct of the army was magnificent and the rebellion crushed step by step.' In February 1936 there is despair until, 'Relation of the heroic patriotic days of Seville, July 1936', the account of the rising against the Republic is euphoric. In 1937 the convent school hears from Queipo de Llano himself, and there are delirious accounts of military parades and speeches by Quiepo, and Franco in August, until 18 April 1939 official recognition of the school and a letter from Franco's secretary in Burgos thanking the community for its good wishes. \"The journal is not exceptional\" Lannon concludes, \"The politically reactionary sympathies of the teaching religious were formed and sustained by the sociological context and limitations of the schools.\"Lannon, p.84", "Disease, poverty, and illiteracy were urgent problems, but in a country with a fiscal system that left most real wealth untaxed, and a large army budget, little public money was directed towards meeting them. Education and welfare needs were met only patchily and religious communities filled the spaces between the patches. Frances Lannon (writing in Privilege, Persecution and Prophecy) observes that even institutions funded by the state or provincial or municipal authorities, were dependent upon religious personnel. The Brothers of St John of God for example specialised in children's hospitals and mental homes. Where welfare was concerned central and local government relied absolutely on the religious congregations to staff as well as supplement their institutions. This was made explicit in the debates on the religious congregations in the constituent Cortes on 8\u201314 October 1931, and was a major reason then, why the congregations were not entirely disbanded. Yet the religious sometimes found themselves excoriated. Sometimes this was because of the different cultural worlds inhabited on the one hand by religious, almost always from devout and traditional milieux, and on the other by the urban poor. To the former it seemed axiomatic that religious practice should order the daily lives of their various charges, be they children, workmen or reformed prostitutes. There is overwhelming evidence however to show that this typical imposition of religious observance as a condition of eligibility for aid was widely resented.  Working class areas of the large cities were notorious for the virtual absence of formal religious practice. w:fr:Margarita Nelken, in the 1920s, said that the poor residents of the most rundown areas of Madrid had terrible things to say about the charity given by women lay associations  and 'not a single word of thanks'. Frances Lannon has further speculated that perhaps the resentment, generated by making charity dependent upon religious tests, and by the sale of goods and services from religious houses, (undercutting those struggling to make a living on the margins of urban society ) goes some way to explain why so many brothers, and even some nuns, whose laudable work might have been expected to save them from popular hatred, were nevertheless massacred in 1936 in the first months of the civil war.Lannon, p.77", "According to Mary Vincent, \"The Church was to become the most important source of legitimation for the rebellious generals, justifying the rising as a crusade against godlessness, anarchy and communism. Although such a close identification with the Nationalist cause was not to be fully elaborated until the Spanish hierarchy's joint pastoral letter of July 1937, there was no doubt that the Church would line up with the rebels against the Republic. Nor, at local level, was there any hesitancy. The only sizeable group of Catholics to remain loyal to the republic were the Basques. \"Vincent, Catholicism in the Second Spanish Republic, p.248, Frances Lannon, Privilege, Persecution, and Prophecy, ch 8  Similarly, Victor M Perez-Diaz wrote, \"The church reacted to all this by mobilizing  the mass of peasants and the middle classes and channeling them into professional and political right wing organisations prepared for by decades of careful organisation. The extreme right took upon itself the task of conspiring to overthrow the regime. The moderate right refused to state its unambiguous loyalty to the new institutions and openly flirted with authoritarianism.\"The return of civil society: the emergence of Democratic Spain, Victor M Perez-Diaz, Harvard University Press, p.128 1993", "Frances Lannon has propounded a view which suggests the existence of an 'exiguous Catholic minority which saw in the Church's crusade against the Republic not a defensive holy war that began in 1936 and deserved their support, but a long series of class commitments on political and socio-economic policies which themselves powerfully helped to create the ruthless and desperate anti-clericalism unleashed by the war. \"Republican Catholics like Jos\u00e9 Manuel Gallegos Rocafull, \u00c1ngel Ossorio y Gallardo, and Jos\u00e9 Bergam\u00edn, all wrote scathing criticisms of the Church's role in covering with a religious cloak the political, military and class aims of the anti-Republicans. The ex-Jesuit Joan Vilar i Costa refuted the 1937 collective pastoral letter, the Catalan democratic Catholic politician Manuel Carrasco Formiguera was executed on Franco's orders in April 1938 because he also failed to agree with official Catholic views. These men emphasised that the Church's anti-Republican alignment did not originate in, although it was certainly strengthened by the massacres of priests, monks and Catholic faithful by groups of Republicans, and Lannon  concludes: \"The crusade had been waged for a long time by the Church for its own institutional interests, for survival. The cost of its survival was the destruction of the Republic.\"Frances Lannon, 'The Church's crusade against the Republic' essay in Revolution and War in Spain "]}, {"page": "2016 Birthday Honours", "response": ["*Dr Frances Lannon \u2013 Lately Principal, Lady Margaret Hall, University of Oxford.
