Walker was known for his emotive baritone voice and his unorthodox stylistic path which took him from being a sophisticated teen pop icon in the 1960s to becoming an avant-garde musician in the 21st century. Walker's success was largely in the United Kingdom, where his first four solo albums reached the top ten. He lived in the UK from 1965 onward and became a UK citizen in 1970.Rising to fame in the mid-1960s as frontman of the pop music trio the Walker Brothers, he began a solo career with 1967's Scott, moving toward an increasingly challenging style on late-1960s baroque pop albums such as Scott 3 and Scott 4 (both 1969). After sales of his solo work started to decrease, he reunited with the Walker Brothers in the mid-1970s. From the mid-1980s onward, Walker revived his solo career while moving in an increasingly avant-garde direction; of this period in his career, The Guardian said \"imagine Andy Williams reinventing himself as Stockhausen\". Walker's 1960s recordings were highly regarded by the 1980s UK underground music scene, and gained a cult following.\nWalker continued to record until 2018. He was described by the BBC upon his death as \"one of the most enigmatic and influential figures in rock history\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "January 9", "response": ["*  1943   \u2013 Scott Walker, American singer-songwriter, bass player, and producer (d. 2019)"]}, {"page": "March 25", "response": ["*2019 \u2013 Scott Walker, American-born British singer-songwriter (b. 1943)"]}, {"page": "1943", "response": ["* January 9 \u2013 Scott Walker, American-born singer, composer and record producer (d. 2019)"]}, {"page": "2019", "response": ["** Scott Walker, American-born British singer-songwriter (b. 1943)"]}, {"page": "Bauhaus (band)", "response": ["According to David J, the bands Bauhaus related to in the post-punk scene were Joy Division, Pere Ubu, Devo, Gang of Four, Cabaret Voltaire, and the Pop Group.

Specific recordings that were influential on the band include the compilation album Nuggets, the Bits and Pieces single by The Dave Clark Five and the Double Barrel single by Dave and Ansell Collins.

Steve Mackey, a regular at their Sheffield and London gigs, was also studying in London and was asked to join the band as a bass player.Sturdy, p. 172. The line-up now consisted of Cocker, Mackey, Senior, Candida Doyle, Nick Banks (drums). In mid-1989, they began recording another album for Fire, this time with a bigger budget and production from Alan Smyth, called Separations. This was a progression of the style of Freaks, with Leonard Cohen-esque ballads on side one and an acid house infused track-listing on side two. The disparate styles can be attributed to Cocker and Mackey's different and changing tastes; Mackey introduced Cocker to house music which led to them both going to raves, while Cocker introduced Mackey to \"Scott Walker and Serge Gainsbourg\".Sturdy, p. 175. Like Freaks, the release of Separations was delayed, to an extent lessening the potential impact.

Subsequent interviews also suggested interpersonal and artistic differences, including managing the fallout of the Britpop/Different Class era. Singer/songwriter Scott Walker agreed to produce the record and this symbolised a new phase in Pulp's development.

He is considered a master of the modern chanson. Although he recorded most of his songs in French and occasionally in Dutch, he became an influence on English-speaking songwriters and performers, such as Scott Walker, David Bowie, Alex Harvey, Marc Almond, Neil Hannon, and Rod McKuen.

There was only one single from the album, \"Lazer Beam\", released on 15 August (chart No.\u00a028). The laid-back ambience recalls early-1970s Beach Boys albums such as Surf's Up (which SFA have referred to as one of their favourite albums), whilst the heavy use of strings suggested the likes of Scott Walker and Curtis Mayfield.
