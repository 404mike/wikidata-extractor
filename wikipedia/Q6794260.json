It began after the IBA allowed non-schools broadcasting in this period of the day, when the government relaxed the regulations around daytime television and featured interview editions undertaken by such broadcasters as Mavis Nicholson, and a weekly consumer programme, which eventually became a programme in its own right; Money-Go-Round."]}, {"page": "Swansea University", "response": ["* Mavis Nicholson, writer and television broadcaster"]}, {"page": "Briton Ferry", "response": ["*Mavis Nicholson (n\u00e9e Mainwaring)  Journalist and Broadcaster"]}, {"page": "1930 in British television", "response": ["*19 October \u2013 Mavis Nicholson, Welsh presenter"]}, {"page": "Mavis", "response": ["* Mavis Nicholson (b. 1930), Welsh broadcaster"]}, {"page": "1930 in Wales", "response": ["*19 October - Mavis Nicholson, television presenter"]}, {"page": "Midweek (BBC Radio 4)", "response": ["The original presenter was television documentary maker Desmond Wilcox.

Broadcast during the daytime, it was initially targeted towards housewives, but, with unemployment growing, its editor Catherine Freeman turned it into a serious interview format. As The Guardian commented, Grand \"brought the art of intelligent interviewing to a wide and growing audience ... [she] was one of a handful of broadcasters who changed the face of daytime television in Britain\" through her interviews of politicians, thinkers, writers and other notable figures. She died on 30 April 2001."]}]}}
