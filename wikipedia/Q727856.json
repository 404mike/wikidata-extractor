The Booker was awarded to Gordimer for her 1974 novel, The Conservationist, and was a co-winner with Stanley Middleton's novel Holiday. The Conservationist explores Zulu culture and the world of a wealthy white industrialist through the eyes of Mehring, the antihero. Per W\u00e4stberg described The Conservationist as Gordimer's \"densest and most poetical novel\". Thematically covering the same ground as Olive Schreiner's The Story of an African Farm (1883) and J. M. Coetzee's In the Heart of the Country (1977), the \"conservationist\" seeks to conserve nature to preserve the apartheid system, keeping change at bay. When an unidentified corpse is found on his farm, Mehring does the \"right thing\" by providing it a proper burial; but the dead person haunts the work, a reminder of the bodies on which Mehring's vision would be built."]}, {"page": "1919 in literature", "response": ["*August 1 \u2013 Stanley Middleton, English novelist (died 2009)"]}, {"page": "1974 in literature", "response": ["*Booker Prize: Nadine Gordimer, The Conservationist and Stanley Middleton, Holiday."]}, {"page": "Peter Bowles", "response": ["Bowles was born in London, England, the son of Herbert Reginald Bowles,Peter Bowles Biography (1936\u2013).
