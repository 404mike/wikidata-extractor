Tosh  is a British historian and Professor Emeritus of History at Roehampton University. He gained his BA at the University of Oxford and his MA at the University of Cambridge. He was awarded his PhD by the University of London in 1973; his thesis topic being \"Political Authority among the Langi of Northern Uganda, circa 1800\u20131939\". He is a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society. In 1987\u201388 he held a visiting appointment at the University of California, Davis. At Roehampton University he teaches History, specifically \"Reading and Writing History\". He served as Vice-President of the Royal Historical Society from 1999 to 2002. He has also published several works on the history of masculinity in nineteenth-century Britain. He is currently preparing a critical analysis of the social applications of historical perspective in contemporary Britain.\nTosh's claim to originality and notability rests largely on his work as a historian and historiographer. Since the turn of the millennium, he has taken a leading role as a public historian in developing the history of masculinity and ensuring it has become an important dimension of social and cultural history. He has shown how domesticity, previously regarded as an aspect of women's history, also conditioned and influenced the lives of men and society. As a historiographer he has updated the way we look at the study of history and how we construct our knowledge of the past, as well as providing insight into the works of other historians and their impact on the study of the subject.He is the father of philosopher Nick Tosh.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Christian von Ehrenfels", "response": ["In the late 19th century, what the British historian John Tosh called the \"flight from domesticity\" novels became very popular, which were a major influence on Ehrenfels.Dickinson, p. 266. The \"flight from domesticity\" novels typically dealt with a ruggedly tough male who lived life on his own terms, usually alone and always in some remote frontier place, and who almost never had a relationship with a woman or children. The heroes in the \"flight from domesticity\" novels were usually a frontiersman, a hunter, a cowboy, a scout or some other suitably adventuresome, manly occupation. Because the heroes in the \"flight from domesticity\" novels lived in the wild in harmony with nature, they were always portrayed as being more morally pure and authentic than the people who lived in modern civilization. The hero in the \"flight from domesticity\" novels was always the strong silent type, the taciturn tough guy who lived uncompromisingly by his own code of honor and who embodied typical male values like courage and self-reliance far better than did the men who lived in civilization. Typical of the \"flight from domesticity\" novels were the Allan Quatermain novels by the British novelist H. Rider Haggard dealing with the adventures of a British frontiersman in 19th century South Africa; the Western novels by the German novelist Karl May dealing with the adventures of the German immigrant cowboy Old Shatterhand and his Apache best friend Winnetou in the American Old West; the Scott Allen Cameron novels by the Canadian novelist Ralph Connor about a Mountie singly-handedly upholding the law in the Rocky Mountains; and Western adventure novels by the Irish-American novelist Thomas Mayne Reid. The typical hero in Reid's novels which were extremely popular in the United States and Europe was described as being: \"gallant, skillful at arms, far more at ease around men than around women, has lots of time for trappers and soldiers but little for the upper classes and intellectuals, and is much happier hunting and killing than thinking.\"Palmer, pp. 254-255. "]}, {"page": "Tracy Philipps", "response": ["Following his experience in Sudan he pursued a full-time career in the Colonial Service in East Africa, where as a 'self-appointed scourge of the wicked' according to John Tosh, he exposed abuses and advocated for reform. He spent much of this period back in the Kigezi District of Uganda, where he was known for his energy as an administrator \u2013 attempting to develop native industries in iron smelting and using the sisal plant to make rope \u2013 and paying for many supplies out of his own pocket."]}, {"page": "Recorded history", "response": [" According to John Tosh, \"From the High Middle Ages (c.1000\u20131300) onwards, the written word survives in greater abundance than any other source for Western history.\"Tosh, The Pursuit of History, 90. Western historians developed methods comparable to modern historiographic research in the 17th and 18th centuries, especially in France and Germany, where they began investigating these source materials to write histories of their past. Many of these histories had strong ideological and political ties to their historical narratives. In the 20th century, academic historians began focusing less on epic nationalistic narratives, which often tended to glorify the nation or great men, to attempt more objective and complex analyses of social and intellectual forces. A major trend of historical methodology in the 20th century was a tendency to treat history more as a social science rather than as an art, which traditionally had been the case. French historians associated with the Annales School introduced quantitative history, using raw data to track the lives of typical individuals, and were prominent in the establishment of cultural history."]}, {"page": "Tosh (surname)", "response": ["* John Tosh, British historian and Professor of History at Roehampton University"]}, {"page": "Karen Hagemann", "response": ["* with Stefan Dudink and John Tosh, Masculinities in Politics and War: Gendering Modern History.
