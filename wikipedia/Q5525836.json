He also helped the team to the 1985 Football League Trophy Final and the match proved to be his final Brentford appearance.

Callaghan added Stan Bowles and Chris Kamara to the midfield during the 1981\u201382 season and forwards Francis Joseph and Tony Mahoney in 1982\u201383, but the team's form went into decline during the 1983\u201384 season and he was sacked in February 1984.
