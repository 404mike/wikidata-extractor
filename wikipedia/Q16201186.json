Prior to Space, he has played in various Liverpool bands, such as the Substitutes (with Jamie Murphy), Hello Sunset and the Australians (with Franny Griffiths, who later became Space's keyboardist).

Nonetheless, in mid-1997, during their tour of the United States, where the band began to find minor success, numerous personal problems hit the band. The band were constantly under stress, which reached such an extent that keyboardist Franny Griffiths developed an ulcer, lyricist and vocalist Tommy Scott lost his voice and the band's guitarist and other lyricist and vocalist, Jamie Murphy, \"still only 21, simply lost it completely and had a spell in psychiatric care being fed anti-depressants and milk.\"", "Upon its release, Tin Planet was met with critical and commercial acclaim, receiving a rare five-star rating from Q Magazine, although some critics were still eager to peg them as a novelty act.

Allmusic's Jason Damas noted how, \"before the release of Tin Planet, lead vocalist Tommy Scott made reference to the album as being one of the finest pop records ever made.\" Later reflections on the album have been mixed, with bandmembers voicing their disappointment with the slicker sound compared to Spiders, and feeling that their label Gut Records were trying to manipulate them into becoming, in their words, \"the next Beautiful South\".", "*Lead vocals on tracks 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11 and 12: Tommy Scott"]}, {"page": "Spiders (album)", "response": ["Spiders is the debut album by English band Space, released on 16 September 1996. After signing to independent label Gut Records, the band recorded Spiders between 1995 and 1996 in Liverpool. The album combines a great wealth of styles and genres, including rock, hip hop, techno and funk. It was the result of the various musical tastes of the band members, with several songs containing several different styles within themselves. Many of the lyrics of the album, mostly written by vocalist Tommy Scott and inspired by films, are darkly humorous and largely story-driven, featuring numerous sadistic characters.", "Space were formed in Liverpool in 1993 by vocalist and bass guitarist Tommy Scott, guitarist and co-vocalist Jamie Murphy and drummer Andy Parle and were initially inspired by The Kinks, Jimi Hendrix and The Who. Scott had been a familiar face on the Liverpool music circuit since the early 1980s; his first band, Hello Sunset, had been supported by an early line-up of The La's. Although most of the band were in their mid-20s, Murphy was only 17, and turned up to the band's first rehearsal session dressed in his school uniform. Space recorded their debut single, \"If It's Real\", to fulfill a publishing deal they had signed with BMG. It was released on 5 July 1993 as a 12\" single through Hug Records, set up by the band's long-time manager and supporter Mark Cowley, with artwork designed by Carl Hunter of The Farm. However, the trio were unhappy with the results, feeling it sounded 'generic' and too similar to other Liverpool bands at the time, and set out to find a new direction.", "In the United States, some pipped Spiders as a potential success in the advance of electronica, and especially rock bands that mixed electronica with rock instrumentation; in February 1997, the Daily Trojan commented that \"the electronic onslaught is underway, and if U2's Pop successfully brings techno to mainstream rock audiences, Space deserves more than a cut of the crowd.\" The band were not expecting any American success, concerned that Spiders \"might sound too European\" due to \"its dance beats, fuzzy guitar, and singer Tommy Scott's jaunty vocals\". The album nonetheless found a small audience in the United States because of the band's college radio following, with the band receiving heavy rotation on small American radio stations in early 1997, and \"Female of the Species\" being popular on MTV and college radio. The first 15,000 American copies came with a bonus disc featuring songs only released in the UK.", "* Tommy Scott - Bass guitar, vocals"]}, {"page": "Suburban Rock 'n' Roll", "response": ["For this album Space sought to diverge from the lush, elaborate pop sound of their two previous albums, Tin Planet and Love You More than Football, by embracing a more stripped back, sample-driven style. Tommy Scott's lyrical themes also shifted in direction, moving away from the character-driven lyrics of old to more personal reflections, with songs dealing with death, living in suburbia, crime and surveillance. The band also reunited with producer Stephen Lironi, who produced their debut album Spiders, and is credited as songwriter of a few tracks. Suburban Rock 'N' Roll is the first Space album with no techno/electronic instrumentals from Franny Griffiths, as the band wanted the album to be more song-oriented.", "Eventually, the album were scrapped in July 2001. By that time, the band had terminated their contract with Gut, which according to frontman Tommy Scott, was due to creative differences rather than financial issues: \"It took us a year to get out of it. One of the problems we had in the past was that we felt we were being pushed in the wrong direction - like they were trying to turn us into The Beautiful South or something, when in fact we never wanted that at all, we just wanted to be a cult band\". Meanwhile, Jamie Murphy, who was growing estranged from the others, was dismissed from the line-up. According to Murphy, because tensions were running high at the time, the exchange was never made face-to-face between his bandmates, and was informed only by the management that he was out of the group. The recordings for Love You More than Football primarily existed as a bootleg, courtesy of a promotional CD-R which circulated around May 2000, before an official remixed version was released in 2019.", "The recording sessions for Suburban Rock 'n' Roll took place between June and July 2002 at Highfield Street Studios in Liverpool. Stephen Lironi, who had previously worked with the band on their debut album Spiders, was brought on as producer, as well as contributing additional guitar and keyboard parts, with Gerald \"Ged\" Lynch providing percussion. In comparison to the fraught Love You More than Football sessions, the band found the experience \"cleansing\" and recording with Lironi productive. As the band were still unsigned at the time of recording, they were excited to just be writing songs without any constraints or outside pressure from record labels. According to Tommy Scott, up to 40 song ideas were brought to the studio, before the group eventually settled on a concise, eleven song track listing. As is tradition, out-takes from the sessions would later end up as B-sides or Music for Aliens tracks. Doug Trantow engineered and mixed the album, and the final mix was mastered by Alan Yoshida at Ocean Way Studios in Hollywood.", "In a webcast interview in 2003, Bassist David \"Yorkie\" Palmer elaborated on the concept of Suburban Rock 'n' Roll: \"The album basically deals with the subject of surveillance and a certain loss of freedom in modern society. On different levels from like the tiny sort of restrictive signs you see everywhere like you know: no ball games, no trespassing, no dogs, no cycling, clean it up to more oppressive things on a larger scale such as cameras in the back of police vans, helicopters with cameras in. Generally the whole idea that even though you may think you live in the most idyllic place every place comes with its own restrictions that prohibit you doing certain things and we just found it interesting because it seems to be an unnameable group of people who put these restrictions into place, it doesn't seem to be by general consensus.\" Some of the lyrics deal with Tommy Scott's feelings of raising a family in suburbia, and how it parallels with having grown up on a council estate plagued by high levels of crime and unemployment (as previously discussed in the song \"Neighbourhood\"), as well as his opinions and experiences in the music industry.", "The band also ran into problems having the album artwork approved. The original sleeve was intended to depict a suburban household from the point of view of a sniper's target, but the band had lost the rights to use the original photograph. Instead, a series of collages designed by Tommy Scott was used as the artwork for the album and its accompanying singles.
