Later that year Peter and Patricia relocated to a studio in Cornwall where he began to experiment with acrylic paint, exhibiting regularly with both The Newlyn Society of Artists and the Penwith Society of Arts. Two of his closest peers while in Cornwall were the painters Margo Maeckelberghe and Jack Pender. During this five-year period Liddle's style changed completely. He credits the challenge of the incredible Portholland light in his transition from heavy, textured, oils to whiter, more transparent, acrylics."]}, {"page": "Deaths in January 2014", "response": ["*Margo Maeckelberghe, 81, British artist.Margo Maeckelberghe obituary"]}, {"page": "2014 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Margo Maeckelberghe, 81, artist."]}, {"page": "Jack Pender", "response": ["He was remembered alongside artists Patrick Heron, Terry Frost and Tony O\u2019Malley in Margo Maeckelberghe's obituary."]}, {"page": "List of women in Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly", "response": ["*Margo Maeckelberghe, artist"]}, {"page": "Margo (given name)", "response": ["*Margo Maeckelberghe (1932\u20132014), Cornish bard and artist"]}]}}
