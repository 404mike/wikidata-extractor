In 2021 Eve was listed by the Shaw Trust as one of the 100 most influential people with disabilities in the United Kingdom.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cloud Atlas (novel)", "response": ["Academic Martin Paul Eve noticed significant differences in the American and British editions of the book while writing a paper on the book. He noted \"an astonishing degree\" of variance and that \"one of the chapters was almost entirely rewritten\". According to Mitchell, who authorized both editions, the differences emerged because the editor assigned to the book at its US publisher left their job, leaving the US version un-edited for a considerable period. Meanwhile Mitchell and his editor and copy editor in the UK continued to make changes to the manuscript. However, those changes were not passed on to the US publisher, and similarly, when a new editor was assigned to the book at the US publisher and made his own changes, Mitchell did not ask for those to be applied to the British edition, which was very close to being sent to press. Mitchell said: \"Due to my inexperience at that stage in my three-book 'career', it hadn't occurred to me that having two versions of the same novel appearing on either side of the Atlantic raises thorny questions over which is definitive, so I didn't go to the trouble of making sure that the American changes were applied to the British version (which was entering production by that point probably) and vice versa.\""]}, {"page": "Jennifer Egan", "response": ["Academic literary critics have examined Egan's work in a variety of contexts. David Cowart has read Egan's project in A Visit from the Goon Squad as indebted to modernist writing but as possessing a closer affinity to postmodernism, in which \"she meets the parental postmoderns on their own ground; by the same token, she venerates the grandparental moderns even as she places their mythography under erasure and dismantles their supreme fictions\",  an aspect also touched upon by Adam Kelly. Baoyu Nie has focused, alternatively, on the ways in which \"Egan draws the reader into the addressee role\" through the use of second-person narrative technique in her Twitter fiction. Finally, Martin Paul Eve has argued that the university itself is given \"quantifiably more space within Egan's work than would be merited under strict societal mimesis\", leading him to classify Egan's novels within the history of metafiction. In 2013, the first academic conference event dedicated to Egan's work was held at Birkbeck, University of London, entitled \"Invisible Circus: An International Conference on the work of Jennifer Egan\"."]}, {"page": "Philip Leverhulme Prize", "response": ["* Languages & Literature: Marc Alexander, Emma Bond, Merve Emre, Martin Paul Eve, Joseph Moshenska"]}, {"page": "Open Library of Humanities", "response": ["The Open Library of Humanities is a nonprofit, open-access publisher for the humanities and social sciences led by Martin Paul Eve and Caroline Edwards.Adeline Koh, 'Mellon Funding for the Open Library of the Humanities', The Chronicle of Higher Education, April 18, 2014, http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/mellon-funding-for-the-open-library-of-the-humanities/56649 .
