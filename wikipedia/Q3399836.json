At the age of fourteen he went into his father's printing office, Gwasg Gee, but continued to attend the grammar school in the afternoons.In 1837 he went to London to improve his knowledge of printing, and on his return to Wales in the following year, he threw himself into literary, educational and religious work. Among his publications were the well-known quarterly magazine Y Traethodydd (\"The Essayist\"), Y Gwyddoniadur Cymreig (\"Encyclopaedia Cambrensis\"), and Dr. Silvan Evans; English-Welsh Dictionary (1868), but his greatest achievement in this field was the newspaper Baner Cymru (\"The Banner of Wales\"), founded in 1857 and amalgamated with Yr Amserau (\"The Times\") two years later as Baner ac Amserau Cymru.\n\nThis paper soon became regarded as an oracle in Wales, and played a great part in promoting the nationalist and home rule movement in the country. In educational matters he waged a long and successful struggle on behalf of undenominational schools and for the establishment of the intermediate school system. He was an enthusiastic advocate of church disestablishment, and had a historic newspaper duel with John Owen (afterwards Bishop of St David's) on this question. The Eisteddfod found in him a thorough friend and a wise counsellor. His commanding presence, mastery of diction, and resonant voice made him an effective platform speaker. He was ordained to the Calvinistic Methodist ministry, at Bala in 1847, and gave his time and talents ungrudgingly to Sunday school and temperance work. Throughout his life he believed in the itinerant unpaid ministry rather than in the settled pastorate.In 1886 he founded the Welsh Land League to campaign for the rights of tenants.:\u200a78\u200aGee attended the founding meeting of the Welsh National Liberal Council in August 1898, and was elected as the organisation's president.  He died in September, and his funeral was at the time the most imposing ever seen in northern Wales.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ieuan Wyn Jones", "response": ["Jones has published two books, Europe: the Challenge for Wales in 1996 and in 1998 Y Llinyn Arian, a biography of the Welsh nineteenth century publisher, Thomas Gee."]}, {"page": "Denbigh", "response": ["*Thomas Gee, preacher and journalist"]}, {"page": "Lewis Edwards", "response": ["Edwards was closely involved with several magazines and periodicals.

Llewelyn Williams", "response": ["Williams became involved in the Cymru Fydd movement, which emerged in the late 1880s, largely inspired by Tom Ellis. Cymru Fydd was largely a cultural and educational movement, but it differed from the sectarian tradition represented by Thomas Gee and was similar in many ways to the cultural nationalism which emerged at the time in central and eastern Europe. Williams, as late as 1894, warned against emulating the Irish Nationalist Party. The movement was largely based on support in North Wales and there were branches in London and Liverpool before Williams set up the first branch of Cymru Fydd in South Wales, at Barry, in 1891. He was later appointed the movement's South Wales Organiser by David Lloyd George."]}, {"page": "Sir Thomas Lloyd, 1st Baronet", "response": ["In 1859 it was again suggested that Lloyd would contest the county seat. Although scarcely a radical, Lloyd received strong support from the Welsh language radical press. The Aberdare-based Gwladgarwr, for example, deprecated the fact that two Conservatives, namely Colonel Powell of Nanteos and Arthur Saunders-Davies, were contesting Cardiganshire. In Baner Cymru, Thomas Gee was more strident, and strongly supported Lloyd. However, Lloyd again refused the invitation, citing a reluctance to take advantage of a division in the Conservative party in the county. Reluctance to oppose a fellow member of the landed gentry would be a charge levied against Lloyd at the subsequent election. Powell was returned by a fairly narrow margin."]}, {"page": "Gwasg Gee", "response": ["Gwasg Gee was a publishing firm founded by a printer, Thomas Gee, in 1808 and taken over by his son, a more famous Thomas Gee, during the 1830s and based in Denbigh, Wales.
