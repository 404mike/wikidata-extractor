Since 2020 he has been chief political commentator at Times Radio, and co-presented the station's Sunday morning politics programme \"G&T\" with Gloria de Piero until de Piero left in May 2021.  He was the political editor of The Sun from 2009 to 2020, having previously worked for ten years as a defence journalist and foreign reporter.\nBefore joining Times Radio, Newton Dunn regularly appeared on the BBC and Sky News, and was one of the hosts of BBC Radio 4's Week in Westminster.  He also appeared on the now-defunct What the Papers Say.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000", "response": ["The UK newspaper The Sun made an official written complaint to the Investigatory Powers Tribunal to seek a public review of the London Metropolitan Police's use of anti-terror laws to obtain the phone records of Tom Newton Dunn, its political editor, in relation to its inquiry into the \"Plebgate\" affair. The Sun\u2019s complaint coincided with confirmation that the phone records of the news editor of the Mail on Sunday and one of its freelance journalists had also been obtained by Kent police force when they investigated Chris Huhne's speeding fraud. Journalists' sources are usually agreed to be privileged and protected from disclosure under European laws with which the UK complies. However, by using RIPA an investigating office just needs approval from a senior officer rather than the formal approval of a court hearing. Media lawyers and press freedom groups are concerned by the use of RIPA because it happens in secret and the press have no way of knowing whether their sources have been compromised. Responding to The Sun's complaint Sir Paul Kennedy, the interception of communications commissioner, launched a full inquiry and urged Home Office ministers to accelerate the introduction of promised protections for journalists, lawyers and others who handle privileged information, including confidential helplines, from such police surveillance operations. He said: \"I fully understand and share the concerns raised by the protection of journalistic sources so as to enable a free press. Today I have written to all chief constables and directed them under section 58 (1) of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa) to provide me with full details of all investigations that have used Ripa powers to acquire communications data to identify journalistic sources. My office will undertake a full inquiry into these matters and report our findings to the prime minister\".Travis, Alan (October 2014). \"Police told to reveal use of surveillance powers to identify journalists\u2019 sources\u201d, The Guardian, 6 October 2014.
