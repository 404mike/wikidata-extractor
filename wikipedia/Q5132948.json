Labour regained the Penistone seat at the 1935 general election.\nGlossop was returned to the House of Commons at the 1945 general election as MP for the Howdenshire constituency in East Yorkshire, and held the seat until his resignation in 1947.\nHe retired to live in Natal, South Africa, and died there.
