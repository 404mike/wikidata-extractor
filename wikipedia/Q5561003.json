The vicar at the time was the Revd\u00a0R.\u00a0K.\u00a0Judson, MA. The report of the antiquarians' visit, led by Lieutenant-Colonel Gilbert J.\u00a0French, son of local antiquarian Gilbert James French, notes that the church is the only one in England dedicated to Saint\u00a0Maxentius. Colonel French speculated that the church's dedication to a Norman saint could be traced to the area's post-conquest history, with Roger de Poictou being appointed the first Earl of Lancaster and first lord of the manor of Bolton by his cousin William the Conqueror. French believed this suggested that a church had existed in Bradshaw at an early date. Maxentius lived much of his life in Poitou."]}]}}
