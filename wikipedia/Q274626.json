Ferdinand's manager Sir Alex Ferguson agreed with Hodgson, saying that at the Euros, \"you play something like a game every four days. Rio Ferdinand couldn't do that\". Speculation was rife that Ferdinand was not selected due to Hodgson not wanting both Ferdinand and John Terry in the same dressing room when Terry was due to undergo trial in July for allegedly racially abusing Ferdinand's brother, Anton.

Hodgson said about the decision that \"When it came to bringing another player in, I wasn't going to bring in a player of Rio's age, class, background and experience to be a cover player.
