Published in the years from 1972\u20131977, it brought Buechner to a much wider audience, and gained him very positive reviews (Lion Country, the first book in the series, was a finalist for the National Book Award in 1971). Of writing the series, Buechner says: \"I had never known a man like Leo Bebb and was in most ways quite unlike him myself, but despite that, there was very little I had to do by way of consciously, purposefully inventing him. He came, unexpected and unbidden, from a part of myself no less mysterious and inaccessible than the part where dreams come from; and little by little there came with him a whole world of people and places that was as heretofore unknown to me as Bebb was himself.\"Buechner, Frederick (1982). Now and Then: A Memoir of Vocation. HarperSanFrancisco. p. 97.  In this series, Buechner experimented for the first time with first-person narrative, and discovered that this, too, opened new doors. His next work, Godric, published in 1980, was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize. The novel, a historical fiction, is written in the first person from the perspective of Saint Godric of Finchale, a 12th-century English hermit."]}, {"page": "Godric", "response": ["*Godric of Finchale (c. 1060\u20131170), Anglo-Saxon saint", "* Godric (novel), a 1981 Pulitzer-nominated book by Frederick Buechner about Godric of Finchale"]}, {"page": "Godric (novel)", "response": ["Godric is the tenth novel by the American author and theologian, Frederick Buechner.
