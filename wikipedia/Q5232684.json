David Crouch comments that the King \"had chosen his time well\": the city's and castle's previous castellan, Robert d'Oilly had died a fortnight earlier and his successor had yet to be appointed. Thus the only military presence in Oxford was the Empress' armed householdmen, a relatively small force of soldiers. They \"bravely or foolishly turned out to dispute his crossing of the river\", and, thinking themselves secure, taunted Stephen's army from the safety of the city's ramparts, raining them with arrow fire across the river. While the Queen's army offered battle outside the city, Stephen was intent on besieging the castle without a battle, but this meant taking the city first. Stephen's men had to navigate a series of watercourses, what the Gesta describes as an \"old, extremely deep, ford\". They successfully crossed\u2014at least one chronicler believed them to have swum at one point\u2014and entered Oxford the same day by a postern gate. The Empress' garrison, both surprised and outnumbered, and probably panicking, beat a hasty retreat up to the castle. Those that were caught were either killed or kept for ransom; the city itself was looted and burned. Matilda was thus stranded in Oxford Castle with an even smaller force than that she had entered the city with;", "For the second time in the war, Stephen almost succeeded in capturing Matilda, but for the second time also, failed in the attempt. After three months' siege, supplies and provisions within Oxford Castle had become dangerously low, and, suggests Castor, \"trapped inside a burned and blackened city, Matilda and her small garrison were cold, starving and almost bereft of hope.\" Matilda\u2014thanks to the \"ingenuity\" of her garrison, says David Crouch and accompanied by four knights\u2014escaped from St George's Tower one night in early December. She managed this, says J. O Prestwich, because, due to the duration of the siege, elements within Stephen's army had \"deserted and others grew slack\". Matilda took advantage of the weakened siege; she may have been assisted by treason within Stephen's army. If not treachery, says Davis, then certainly carelessness. In any case, he goes on, it prevented Stephen from achieving his primary aim: to win the war in one fell swoop. Matilda's escape to Wallingford contributed to her reputation for luck, which was seen as verging on the miraculous. The contemporary chronicler of the Gesta Stephani\u2014who was highly partisan to Stephen\u2014wrote how: Matilda's escape was, true to her reputation, embroidered by contemporaries, who asked many questions as to how she had managed it. The chroniclers tried to answer them, embellishing as they did. It was the last, and probably most dramatic event of Matilda's career, a career punctuated with dramatic events. It is also the final chapter in William of Malmsbury's Historiae Novellae; he was the first to suppose that she escaped by way of a postern gate and walked to Abingdon. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\u2014itself relying heavily on Malmsbury\u2014adds the possibility that she had descended from the walls by rope. The Gesta Stephani adds that not only was there thick snow but the river had frozen. Henry of Huntingdon then garnishes the whole with the escapees' white cloaks. Edmund King has suggested that many of these explanations can be traced to other, often mythological or biblical events that would have been a point of reference for ecclesiastical chroniclers. They suggested that she had climbed down a rope out of her window (but, says King, \"this was the manner of St Paul's escape from his enemies at Damascus\"), that she had walked on water to cross Castle Mill Stream (\"but this sounds more like the Israelites crossing the Red Sea than the traversing of an established thoroughfare\", and the Thames may well have been frozen), according to Henry of Huntingdon, wrapped in a white shawl as camouflage against the snow. This was not achieved without alerting the Stephen's guards: they were not asleep, and as she slipped out, there was the sound of trumpets and men's shouting, their voices carrying through the frosty air\" as Matilda and her knights slipped through Stephen's ranks. There had been a recent snowfall, which shielded her from her enemies but also hindered her passage. However precisely the escape was achieved, says Edmund King, it had clearly been thoroughly planned. The castle surrendered the day after Matilda's escape, and Stephen installed his own garrison. The siege had lasted over two and a half months.", "Oxford has been described as Stephen's \"key target\" of 1142, and David Crouch suggests that the loss of Oxford was tactically such a disaster as to be Matilda's Stalingrad: \"A final redoubt from which retreat would signal the beginning of the end for her cause.\" Stephen, says the Gesta Stephani, now controlled most of the region and commanded the Thames Valley. He already controlled the capital and the south-east; now, says Poole, \"all hopes of Angevin success eastward of the upper Thames valley\" were dashed. Matilda's escape was, in itself, not a victory\u2014if anything, says King, it highlighted the fragility of her position\u2014and by the end of the year, the Angevin cause was, in Crouch's words, \"on the ropes\" and what remained of its army demoralised. This, he says, is evidenced by the fact that even though the Earl of Gloucester had returned from Normandy in late October, it took him until December to re-establish himself in his Dorsetshire heartlands, as he wanted to reassert his control over the whole Dorset coast. Wallingford was now the sole Angevin possession outside of the West Country; Stephen, however\u2014although waging what Barlow has described as a \"brilliant tactical campaign, distinguished by personal bravery\"\u2014had also lost the momentum he had built up since his release from captivity, and had missed his last chance to end the war decisively, as he had planned, with Matilda's capture. On her arrival in the west, her party set to work consolidating what it still held, being by now unable to regain lost lands. Popular rumour held that Matilda made a vow, following her escape, to found a new Cistercian Abbey. David Crouch, though, suggests that she made this up years later in order to justify policy, and Geoffrey White notes that she did not endow an abbey until 1150, when she committed, \"at the suggestion of the Archbishop of Rouen, to co-operate in the founding of Le Valasse\".Stephen's exact movements after the siege are hard to establish; Oxford Castle dominated the surrounding countryside, and he probably took advantage of his new-found lordship to spend considerable time and resources subduing the countryside around Oxford. After all, says Emilie Amt, in the county generally, \"far more important than the Angevins' one-time foothold here were the Angevin loyalties of many Oxfordshire barons\". Stephen knew Matilda had fled to Wallingford after her escape, but made no effort to stop her. Stephen had attempted to besiege the castle in 1139, Fitz Count had \"strengthened the already impregnable castle\" over the years, as well as having sufficient provisions to hold out for several years, which Stephen had discovered to his cost: his siege had broken up within weeks. Stephen clearly did not wish to attempt a second assault. The King is known to have attended a legatine council meeting in London in spring the following year, and around the same time returned to Oxford to consolidate his authority in the region. Stephen attempted a counter attack, but was roundly beaten at the Battle of Wilton the following year. Oxford, though, remained in the king's possession with William de Chesney as constable; in 1155, the sheriff, Henry de Oxford, was granted \u00a37 to assist with the rebuilding of Oxford, following its \"wasting by Stephen's army\" 13 years earlier."]}, {"page": "Template talk:Ahnentafel", "response": [":::::::::::You are either getting yourself confused or else trying very hard to confuse others.
