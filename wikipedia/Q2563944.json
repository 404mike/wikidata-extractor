Andrew Shinnie put the Highlanders ahead shortly after half time, but debutant Michael Ngoo struck the equaliser before Scott Robinson was sent off for a two footed tackle on Inverness player Owain Tudor Jones. The teams could not be separated and the match went to penalties with Hearts going through for the second round in a row, with Philip Roberts missing the last penalty. The result meant Hearts would return to Hampden nine months after lifting the Scottish Cup, and would face either St Mirren or Celtic in the final. The following day St Mirren beat Celtic 3\u20132 setting up a non Old Firm final. Following completion of the round Inverness asked the Scottish Football Association (SFA) for clarity over whether Hearts player Danny Wilson should have been suspended for the tie, due to speculation over whether he had served a ban from his time at Rangers. The SFA later confirmed that he was eligible and had served the ban when he joined Liverpool in 2010.", "| 8|||| MF|| Scott Robinson", "| Scott Robinson"]}, {"page": "2012 Scottish Cup Final", "response": ["|MF ||27 ||  Scott Robinson || || "]}]}}
