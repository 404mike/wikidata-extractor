He scored nearly 13,000 runs for Derbyshire and achieved over 430 dismissals from behind the stumps.\nStorer was born at Ripley, Derbyshire, the son of John Storer, an engine smith, and his wife Elizabeth. In 1881 the family were living at Butterley Hill and he was a turner's apprentice.Storer was a specialist wicket keeper who was reputed to stand up to the wicket against fast bowlers. He was also a highly skilled batsman at a time when wicket-keeper batsmen were rare and twice averaged over fifty in a season. His first-class record of 216 not out came against Leicestershire in the 1899 season and he was the first professional to score two hundreds, against a strong Yorkshire side, in a match. He was also a competent leg spinner, taking 232 first-class wickets at 33.89. Storer also appeared for London County.Storer toured Australia for England, making his debut in the 1897 Test at Sydney and played against the tourists at home, his last Test coming at Trent Bridge in 1899 when he was also named a Wisden cricketer of the year. His Test appearances were limited by the selectors preference for Dick Lilley.\nStorer was 'severely reprimanded' for 'objectionable language' during the 1898 test where he was overheard to say \"You are a cheat, and you know it\", during the luncheon on the final day of the 5th test match at the Sydney Cricket Ground.Storer died in Derby at the age of 45. His brother Harry Storer also played cricket for Derbyshire and football for Derby County.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1912", "response": ["** Bill Storer, English footballer and cricketer (b. 1867)"]}, {"page": "1898 in sports", "response": ["* Wisden Five Cricketers of the Year \u2013 Wilfred Rhodes, Bill Storer, Charlie Townsend, Albert Trott, William Lockwood"]}, {"page": "History of Test cricket from 1890 to 1900", "response": ["The first Test was delayed, at the instigation of the SCG to allow time for Ranjitsinhji to recover from tonsillitis and because Andrew Stoddart's mother had died.
