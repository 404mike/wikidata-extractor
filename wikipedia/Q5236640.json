The library music he composed is usually uncredited in films and TV programmes, although a younger audience is likely to have heard it in recent years; Midnight Serenade is featured in two Electronic Arts PlayStation 2 video games (The Godfather and The Sims 2: Castaway). That song was also included in the 2018 film The Catcher Was a Spy. The animated series SpongeBob SquarePants is another beneficiary of Lindup's work. He orchestrated the scores for musical films such as Goodbye, Mr. Chips (1969) and Scrooge (1970). The trailer of the film The Full Monty (1997) credits use of Lindup's composition Zodiac, which is played over the opening credits along with a promotional film from the early 1970s - Sheffield - City On The Move.\nHis recording of the Dankworth-David Dearlove song \"Let's Slip Away\", accompanying Susan Grey, features as source music in the films Saturday Night and Sunday Morning (1960) and A Taste of Honey (1961).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Full Monty", "response": ["# \"The Zodiac\" \u2013 David Lindup (3:06)"]}, {"page": "Cleo Laine", "response": ["Laine did not take up singing professionally until her mid-twenties. Her early influences as a singer were Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan, Judy Garland and Lena Horne. She auditioned successfully, at the age of 24, for John Dankworth's small group, the Dankworth Seven, and later his orchestra, with which she performed until 1958. Dankworth and Laine married that year in secret at Hampstead Register Office. The only witnesses were the couple's friend, pianist Ken Moule, and Dankworth's arranger, David Lindup. The couple had two children, who are both successful musicians in their own right: Alec who lives in the US, and Jacqui, a British singer who has released a number of albums."]}, {"page": "Spider-Man (1967 TV series)", "response": ["The show's incidental music uses jangling surf guitar, brass lines and jazzy scoring. The first season's score was original by Ray Ellis, with season two and three utilizing other music from the KPM, Capitol, Conroy and Josef Weinberger libraries by Syd Dale, Alan Hawkshaw, Johnny Hawksworth and David Lindup.  In 2002, the Winnipeg jazz rock band Volume released a CD, 'The Amazing Spider-Band' adapting the background music.  MIDI musician Vaughn Smith (Moxxi) has also released some adaptations to YouTube and elsewhere.  In 2007, the radio station WFMU did a radio show featuring songs from the cartoon alongside the original masters from KPM, later released as a podcast."]}, {"page": "John Dankworth", "response": ["Dankworth formed his big band in 1953. The band was soon earning plaudits from the critics and was invited to the 1959 Newport Jazz Festival, the first British group to receive an invite.Dankworth Plans Trip to Newport, The Tatler, May 6, 1959 The New York Times critic said of this appearance \"Mr. Dankworth's group ... showed the underlying merit that made big bands successful many years ago \u2013 the swinging drive, the harmonic colour and the support in depth for soloists that is possible when a disciplined, imaginatively directed band has worked together for a long time. This English group has a flowing, unforced, rhythmic drive that has virtually disappeared from American bands\". More succinctly, Gerard Lascelles of The Tatler, noted that 'The Dankworth orchestra blew magnificently'.Jazz at Two Festivals, The Tatler, September 2, 1959 The band performed at the Birdland jazz club in New York City, and shortly afterwards shared the stage with the Duke Ellington Orchestra for a number of concerts. Dankworth's band also performed at a jazz event at New York's Lewisohn stadium where Louis Armstrong joined them for a set. By now, Cleo Laine's singing was a regular feature of Dankworth's recordings and public appearances. After her divorce from George Langridge became final, in 1957, Dankworth married Cleo Laine in secret at Hampstead Registry Office in 1958.

He is probably best known, however, for his short compositions for television. These include Salute to Thames (the famous identity tune for Thames Television) and also the theme tunes for the 1960s pop music show Thank Your Lucky Stars and the 1970s series Roobarb, Man About the House and George and Mildred. He also contributed some of the incidental music used in the 1967 Spider-Man cartoon (although originating from the United States, produced in Canada, Spider-Man had most of its incidental music supplied by Irish composers, such as Phil Coulter, who was from Derry in Northern Ireland, and British including Syd Dale, Alan Hawkshaw, David Lindup, Bill Martin and Johnny Pearson.)Jon E.
