He made his Moors debut on the opening day of the 2018\u201319 season, in a 2\u20131 win at Eastleigh on 4 August, and his performance earned him a place in the National League Team of the Weekend. He signed a contract extension in February 2019 after Flowers felt that Boot had proven himself a more than worthy successor to Max O'Leary. He helped the Moors to a second-place finish in the league, before they were beaten by AFC Fylde in the play-offs. He made 44 appearances in the 2019\u201320 season, which was permanently suspended on 26 March due to the COVID-19 pandemic in England, with Solihull in eighth-place. He kept 15 clean sheets in the 2020\u201321 campaign, playing every minute of the club's games, and was voted as Supporters' Player of the Season. Despite this, he was released by the club upon the expiry of his contract. However the club reversed their decision and re-signed Boot in July. After keeping five clean sheets in six matches, Boot was awarded the National League Player of the Month award for October 2021 with manager Neal Ardley getting the league's Manager of the Month award.
