He made 543 appearances for Coventry between 1956 and 1969, the club's record for an outfield player, winning the 1963\u201364 Third Division and the 1966\u201367 Second Division titles and also playing in the First Division from 1967 until 1969. With Aston Villa, he was part of the side which won the 1971\u201372 Third Division.\nAfter retiring from playing, Curtis returned to Coventry to work on the managerial staff, remaining there until his retirement in 1994. Between April 1986 and May 1987, he was the joint manager of the team alongside John Sillett, during which time the club won its only major honour, beating Tottenham Hotspur 3\u20132 in the 1987 FA Cup Final.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Coventry City F.C.", "response": ["|  George Curtis", "|  George Curtis", "|  George Curtis", "|  George Curtis 51", "|  George Curtis", "|  George Curtis 49", "|  George Curtis", "|  George Curtis 56", "|  George Curtis", "|  George Curtis 50 Ronnie Rees 50", "|  George Curtis", "|  George Curtis 46 Ronnie Rees 46", "|  George Curtis", "|  George Curtis 50", "|  George Curtis", "|  George Curtis 46", "|  George Curtis", "|  George Curtis", "|  George Curtis || 538 || 13"]}, {"page": "George Curtis", "response": ["George Curtis may refer to:", "*George Curtis (cricketer) (1837\u20131885), Australian cricketer", "*George Curtis (greyhound trainer) (1923\u20132020), British greyhound trainer", "*George Curtis (footballer, born 1919) (1919\u20132004), footballer with Arsenal F.C. and Southampton F.C., and Norway national football team manager", "*George Curtis (footballer, born 1939) (1939\u20132021), footballer and manager, most notably with Coventry City F.C.", "*George Curtis (Australian politician) (1845\u20131922), Australian politician", "*George Curtis (Union spy) during the American Civil War", "*George Curtis Moore (1925\u20131973), American diplomat"]}, {"page": "John Sillett", "response": ["Jimmy Hill invited Sillett to join the Coventry coaching staff in 1979.

The management team of George Curtis and John Sillett offered Houchen \u00a3350 a week, \u00a350 an appearance, a \u00a310,000 signing-on fee, as well the chance to play First Division football. He struggled with injuries at the start of the 1986\u201387 campaign, but recovered to ensure his name went down in the club's history for his exploits in the FA Cup. He bagged five goals in their 1986\u201387 cup-winning run, the first being the winning goal away at Old Trafford against Alex Ferguson's Manchester United. He then scored two against Sheffield Wednesday in the quarter-finals, and one against Leeds United in the semi-finals, both games being held at Hillsborough. The final and most famous goal of the run came in the 1987 FA Cup Final in front of 98,000 spectators at Wembley Stadium in a 3\u20132 win over Tottenham Hotspur. However Houchen almost missed the match after catching food poisoning from a trout caught by reserve goalkeeper Jake Findlay. The goal came from a Dave Bennett cross and was an instinctive full-stretch diving header that was impossible for Ray Clemence to save. It levelled the score at 2\u20132 on 63 minutes, and an own goal from Gary Mabbutt in extra time won the game for Coventry. As well as his FA Cup winning medal, Houchen's header also earned him the BBC Match of the Day's Goal of the Season award for the 1986\u201387 season. This was due to the acrobatic effort involved and partly due to the incredible run he had made from deep midfield to meet the crossed ball. It is generally considered as one of the most famous goals scored at Wembley, and certainly the best headed goal."]}]}}
