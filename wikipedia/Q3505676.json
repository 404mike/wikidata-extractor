This was spearheaded by one man, Josiah Wedgwood, who cut the first sod for the canal in 1766 and erected his Etruria Works that year. Wedgwood built upon the successes of earlier local potters such as his mentor Thomas Whieldon and along with scientists and engineers, raised the pottery business to a new level. Josiah Spode introduced bone china at Trent in 1796, and Thomas Minton opened his manufactory.

In 1929 she was recognised as a designer, and by the mid-to-late 1930s was numbered among Wedgwood's main designers. With Clarice Cliff, she was one of two working-class women to achieve success as a designer in the interwar period. Many of the other women designers at this time were middle class in origin, and they often had close relatives who were designers or artists; lower-class women in the industry were usually restricted to non-creative roles such as dipping. Taplin originated patterns for bone china, Queen's ware, earthenware and other types of pottery. Her designs in the 1920s were for ornamental ware; those of the 1930s were for tableware. Her earlier designs were for hand-painting, but after the Second World War, she also worked on lithographic printed designs. Like most women designers, Taplin only originated decorative patterns and did not create complete pottery designs, although some women such as Cliff and Susie Cooper did design both. Like other Wedgwood designers of the 1920s and 1930s, the designs were sold under her name, but only some of her work was individually identified, which was done via a painted monogram rather than a signature. She worked under the direct supervision of Victor Skellern, Wedgwood's art director from 1934, with whom she collaborated."]}]}}
