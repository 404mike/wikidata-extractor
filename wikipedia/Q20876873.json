Later in his career, he was a member of Tottenham Hotspur's 1899\u201300 Southern League First Division title-winning team and played in the first round of the club's victorious 1900\u201301 FA Cup campaign. After leaving Southern League football in 1902, Stormont became a referee.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Stormont", "response": ["* Bob Stormont (1872\u20131943), Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "History of Brentford F.C. (1889\u20131954)", "response": ["Changes were afoot both on and off the pitch at York Road during the 1901 off-season, with 'The Brentford Football And Sports Club' being registered as a limited liability company and virtually an entirely new team being assembled. Deprived of new captain Bob Stormont for a time due to injury and a suspension for fighting during a match, the Bs finished 1901\u201302 15th in the 16-team division and were spared relegation after drawing 1\u20131 with Grays United in a promotion/relegation test match, which Grays forfeited after refusing to play extra time. Throughout the remainder of the 1900s, a lack of financial clout meant that successive managers William Lewis, Dick Molyneux and William Brown were unable to produce better than mid-table finishes in the First Division. Manager Molyneux changed Brentford's colours in 1903 to dark blue and gold stripes, the racing colours of Walter Rothschild, a patron of the club."]}, {"page": "1901\u201302 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["Despite having won election to the Southern League First Division in July 1901, the Brentford committee did not rest on its laurels and quickly realised that the team which finished top of the Second Division during the previous season needed drastic improvement if the club was to retain its First Division status.White, p. 76-78. Almost a whole new XI was signed, which included goalkeeper Tommy Spicer, full back David Robson, half backs Bill Regan, Bob Stormont, Charlie McEleny and three new forwards. Half back Ralph McElhaney and forwards E. Andrews, Roddy McLeod and Peter Turnbull, all lynchpins of the promotion team, would play a part in the upcoming season. In late August, the club was registered as a limited liability company.", "Brentford began the season in poor form and it took the signings of forwards Tommy Shanks, Paddy Logan and Tom Grieve to inspire the team to its first league victory of the campaign on 9 November 1901. The result inspired three wins and three draws from a seven-match spell through to January 1902, but the team soon regained the habit of losing. Despite the loss of captain Bob Stormont due to an FA suspension and injury problems in February, Brentford struggled on until mid-April and with two matches to go, were level on points with fellow promotion-relegation test match contenders Watford, New Brompton and Wellingborough near the bottom of the First Division. The Bees closed out the season with 7\u20131 and 3\u20130 defeats to Portsmouth and Tottenham Hotspur respectively, the top two sides in the First Division. Brentford's 15th-place finish led to a promotion-relegation test match with Grays United, in which the Second Division side forfeited promotion by refusing to play extra time while the score was at 1\u20131, which preserved the Bees' First Division status.", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Bob Stormont"]}]}}
