The clergyman affixed a simple disk, now known as the Henshall Button, between the worm and the shank. The disk prevents the worm from going too deep into the cork, forces the cork to turn with the turning of the crosspiece, and thus breaks the adhesion between the cork and the neck of the bottle. The disk is designed and manufactured slightly concave on the underside, which compresses the top of the cork and helps keep it from breaking apart."]}, {"page": "List of English inventions and discoveries", "response": ["* 1795: First corkscrew patent granted to the Reverend Samuel Henshall (1764/5\u20131807)."]}, {"page": "Anti-Jacobin Review", "response": ["Contributors included Robert Bisset (1758/9\u20131805), John Bowles (1751\u20131819), Arthur Cayley (1776\u20131848), George Gleig, Samuel Henshall (1764/5\u20131807), James Hurdis, John Oxlee (1779\u20131854), Richard Penn (1733/4\u20131811), Richard Polwhele, John Skinner (1744\u20131816), William Stevens (1732\u20131807), and John Whitaker (1735\u20131808), though as items were frequently published anonymously attributions are often unclear."]}, {"page": "Henshall", "response": ["*Samuel Henshall (1764/5\u20131807), English clergyman, writer and inventor of type of corkscrew"]}, {"page": "English county histories", "response": ["*Samuel Henshall, Specimens and parts; containing a history of the county of Kent and a dissertation on the laws (1798, partial)"]}]}}
