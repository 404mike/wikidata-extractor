She has been a member of such groups as Grace and The Space Brothers, among others. Her hit singles include \"Not Over Yet\", \"Skin On Skin\", \"If I Could Fly\", \"Down To Earth\", and \"I Want To Live\".  She co-wrote and sang on Tilt's 1999 hit single \"Invisible\".

The project was dissolved in 1997 as Oakenfold was touring as a performance DJ more frequently and could not commit to recording, though a remixed version of \"Not Over Yet\" was issued under the Planet Perfecto featuring Grace name in 1999."]}, {"page": "Grace (band)", "response": ["Grace was a 1990s dance music act, consisting of the DJs Paul Oakenfold and Steve Osborne and the jazz singer Dominique Atkins. The group's first single, \"Not Over Yet\" (originally released in 1993 and then again in 1995), had lead and backing vocals by the original frontwoman Patti Low. Atkins recorded her own lead vocals for \"Not Over Yet\" when it was included as the first track on the group's only album If I Could Fly.", "The group was initially named State of Grace, shortened to Grace following the discovery of another group of the same name.Grace In existence from 1993 to 1997, the group served mainly to showcase Oakenfold and Osborne's production talents. They had seven Top 40 hits, most notably the dance anthem \"Not Over Yet\", which peaked at #6 in the UK Singles Chart, and topped the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart in the US. The original front-woman, Patti Low, also recorded one other track while involved with Grace called \"Helpless\", which was only released as the B-side on the tape cassette release of \"Not Over Yet\" in 1995. Low appeared in the 1995 promotional video for \"Not Over Yet\" and also performed live lead-vocals in Grace's appearance on Top of the Pops in early 1995. For some reason, she was then replaced as the lead singer with Dominique Atkins, of whom Oakenfold had become aware through her vocals on the previous Perfecto release \"Passion\" by Jon of The Pleased Wimmin. Subsequent recordings and personal appearances always featured Atkins as lead singer. The September 1995 track \"I Want To Live\" (UK #30)/(UK Dance #6) which was a cover of the song by Gavin Friday (also covered by Naomi Campbell) had the \"Not Over Yet\" lead singer Low on backing vocals. Further singles by Grace were \"Skin on Skin\" (UK #21), \"Down to Earth\" (UK #20), \"If I Could Fly\" (UK #29), \"Hand in Hand\" (UK #38) and double A-side of \"You're Not Mine\" (renamed \"Don't Call Me (You're Not Mine)\") along with a re-release of \"Down to Earth\" (UK #29). The group released an album entitled If I Could Fly though this did not enter the chart.", "In 2007, \"Not Over Yet\" was reworked by the Klaxons and renamed \"It's Not Over Yet\", for their album Myths of the Near Future. In July 2011, new remixes of \"Not Over Yet\" were released by Perfecto. In December 2011, a new track for Grace (Dominique Atkins) was announced on Tilt's official Facebook page as being currently written.", "A reviewer from Music Week rated the song three out of five, adding, \"The hook doesn't really hammer home but superb production ensures this track still has impact. Likely to be a moderate success.\" James Hamilton from the magazine's RM Dance Update described it as a \"Dominique Atkins cooed scurrying sweet soundscaper\"."]}, {"page": "Not Over Yet", "response": ["\"Not Over Yet\" is a song by British dance act Grace.
