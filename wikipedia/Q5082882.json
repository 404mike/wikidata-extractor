He was educated at home and at the Ochiltree parish school, then was apprenticed by his father to a master handloom weaver at Kilbarchan in Renfrewshire.

By the year 1832, St. Rollox was consuming thirty thousand tons of coal a year. The system had not been designed to handle this volume. It just could not do so efficiently. He plunged into a study of possible solutions to the problem. His imagination and interest were fired by a new way of transporting people and freight. This involved using wagons, pulled by a steam engine, on iron rails laid on a level roadbed. He had heard of this from his good friend George Stephenson, the great railway engineer. He quickly realised this was the answer to his problem at St. Rollox. From 1825 until his death he was one of the prime movers in railway expansion. He was mainly responsible for getting a railway into Glasgow, over the fierce opposition of the canal proprietors.", "Charles lived to see his empire grow to be the largest and most important in the world. He was, beyond question, an entrepreneur of amazing ability. His dedication to his work, his family and his sense of what was right and fair lasted until the day he died. He was quick to champion those less fortunate, and the reforms he initiated and supported made the lives of his countrymen better. On his death on 1 October 1838, his eldest son John Tennant became managing director of Charles Tennant & Co for the next 40 years.

The year before his death, he had commissioned Benjamin Haydon to paint a six- by nine-foot canvas commemorating the distinguished service of his forebear, Lord James Audley, at the Battle of Poitiers (this being rewarded by an annuity that continued through the generations), agreeing a price of 500 guineas with an initial payment of 50 pounds. He visited the Haydons, complimenting their twelve-year-old daughter Mary and suggesting his younger son, William, was desirous of marrying her, in which event he would give the Haydons \u00a350,000. Haydon, wary of his benefactor's eccentricity but impressed by his claims of generosity, indulged him. Audley, a heavy drinker, was made 'excessively tipsy' by the sharing of two bottles of wine and sherry with dinner, and took a cab to Covent Garden where he would stay the night. Some days later, he visited, paying Haydon \u00a385, but no further mention was made of his previous ambitions regarding his son's marriage to Mary Haydon. In response to that young lady's observation of the difference in Lord Audley's conduct, Haydon attributed it to the fact that on the latter visit Audley was sober. Despite paying Haydon a few further advances, the artist was placed in dire financial straits, observing 'Lord Audley has completely deceived me about his resources... after telling me he was the richest peer, it turns out he is the poorest!' At the time of Audley's death ('...with little more to his name than the pension given to his ancestor by the Black Prince nearly five centuries before'), only half of Haydon's work had been accounted for; the artist applied to the 21st Lord Audley for recompense, or he would sell it. Receiving no answer, the painting, 'The Black Prince Thanking Lord James Audley for his Gallantry in the Battle of Poitiers' thus came to be owned by Haydon's landlord William Newton, who already possessed a number of his works.A Genius for Failure: The Life of Benjamin Robert Haydon, Paul O'Keeffe, The Bodley Head, 2009, p. 361-2, 437"]}, {"page": "Eveleen Myers", "response": ["Tennant was the third daughter of Charles Tennant (1796\u20131873) and Gertrude Barbara Rich Collier (1819\u20131918).
