He started his senior career with Preston North End and scored 10 goals in 22 league matches during the 1912\u201313 season as the team won the Football League Second Division.

He remained at Oakwell for 14 years and played 312 league games for the club, scoring 83 goals.In June 1927, Halliwell joined Third Division North side Nelson on a free transfer. During his time at Nelson he played predominantly as a right-half. He made his debut for the club on 27 August 1927 in the 1\u20134 home defeat to Accrington Stanley and went on to play every first-team match in that season.
