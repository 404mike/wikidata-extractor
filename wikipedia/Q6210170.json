He started his senior career with Preston North End and scored 10 goals in 22 league matches during the 1912\u201313 season as the team won the Football League Second Division. After making four further appearances for Preston at the start of the following campaign, Halliwell transferred to Barnsley in December 1913. He remained at Oakwell for 14 years and played 312 league games for the club, scoring 83 goals.In June 1927, Halliwell joined Third Division North side Nelson on a free transfer. During his time at Nelson he played predominantly as a right-half. He made his debut for the club on 27 August 1927 in the 1\u20134 home defeat to Accrington Stanley and went on to play every first-team match in that season. Halliwell scored his first Nelson goal on 1 December 1928, netting the winner in the 2\u20131 victory away at Halifax Town. He played several matches as a forward during the 1928\u201329 campaign and ended the season with nine league goals.Halliwell was not retained by Nelson in the summer of 1929 and subsequently moved into non-League football with Barnoldswick Town of the Lancashire Combination. He spent almost four years with Barnoldswick before joining Preston-based club St Paul's as an amateur in January 1933. Following his retirement from football he became the landlord of a public house in Barrowford. Halliwell died in Lostock Hall, Lancashire, in the summer of 1964 at the age of 72.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Halliwell", "response": ["* Joe Halliwell (1892\u20131964), English footballer"]}, {"page": "1927\u201328 Nelson F.C. season", "response": ["Outside of league competition, Nelson entered the FA Cup but were knocked out in the First Round following a 0\u20133 defeat to Bradford Park Avenue at Seedhill.

Many of these were new arrivals at the club; a number of the professional staff from the previous campaign had been released due to the club's increasing debts. Forward Jimmy Hampson, the top goalscorer in 1926\u201327, was sold to Blackpool in October 1927 for a transfer fee of \u00a31,250 and went on to become an England international. His replacement, Bernard Radford, was Nelson's highest scorer in the 1927\u201328 campaign with 17 league goals. Scottish striker Buchanan Sharp was the only other player to reach double figures with his tally of 11. Only one player, Joe Halliwell appeared in all 43 competitive matches; former England international George Wilson appeared in 40 of the games.
