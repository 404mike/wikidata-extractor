She is especially remembered as the custodian of her father's literary legacy, and for short fiction that places traditional fairy tale narratives in a Victorian milieu. Her 1885 novel Mrs. Dymond contains the earliest use in English of the proverb, \"Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for life.\"", "link_mentions": {}}}
