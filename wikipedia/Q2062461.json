His exact route over the Alps has been the source of scholarly dispute ever since (Polybius, the surviving ancient account closest in time to Hannibal's campaign, reports that the route was already debated). The most influential modern theories favour either a march up the valley of the Dr\u00f4me and a crossing of the main range to the south of the modern highway over the Col de Montgen\u00e8vre or a march farther north up the valleys of the Is\u00e8re and Arc crossing the main range near the present Col de Mont Cenis or the Little St Bernard Pass.Montgen\u00e8vre: Peter Connolly, Hannibal and the Enemies of Rome (1978); (extensive summary); Col de la Traversette: Gavin de Beer, Alps and Elephants and Napoleon III; Mahaney 2008, \"Hannibal's Odyssey; Environmental Background to the Alpine Invasion of Italia\"; Mont Cenis: Denis Proctor, Hannibal's March in History. Other theories include the Col de Clapier (Serge Lancel, Hannibal (1995) and the Col du Petit Saint Bernard (Barthold Niebuhr). Recent numismatic evidence suggests that Hannibal's army may have passed within sight of the Matterhorn. Stanford geoarchaeologist Patrick Hunt argues that Hannibal took the Col de Clapier mountain pass, claiming the Clapier most accurately met ancient depictions of the route: wide view of Italy, pockets of year-round snow, and a large campground. Other scholars have doubts, proposing that Hannibal took the easier route across Petit Mount Cenis. Hunt responds to this by proposing that Hannibal's Celtic guides purposefully misguided the Carthaginian general."]}, {"page": "Roman legion", "response": ["* The Roman Army and Greece and Rome at War, Peter Connolly"]}, {"page": "Ballista", "response": ["The most influential archaeologists in this area have been Peter Connolly and Eric Marsden,Marsden, E.W.

Duncan Head has argued in favor of short stabbing spears.Duncan Head, Armies of the Macedonian and Punic Wars (Wargames Research Group, 1983) p. 144. Polybius states that the Libyans fought with equipment taken from previously defeated Romans. It is unclear whether he meant only shields and armor or offensive weapons as well, though a general reading suggests he meant the whole panoply of arms and armor, and even tactical organization. Apart from his description of the battle itself, when later discussing the subject of the Roman legion versus the Greek phalanx, Polybius says that \"...against Hannibal, the defeats they suffered had nothing to do with weapons or formations\" because \"Hannibal himself... discarded the equipment with which he had started out [and] armed his troops with Roman weapons\". Gregory Daly is inclined to the view that Libyan infantry would have copied the Iberian use of the sword during their fighting there and so were armed similarly to the Romans. Peter Connolly has argued that they were armed as a pike phalanx.Connolly (1998), p. 148. This has been disputed by Head, because Plutarch states they carried spears shorter than the Roman triarii and by Daly because they could not have carried an unwieldy pike at the same time as a heavy Roman-style shield."]}, {"page": "Corinthian helmet", "response": ["The Corinthian helmet was depicted on more sculpture than any other helmet; it seems the Greeks romantically associated it with glory and the past. The Romans also revered it, from copies of Greek originals to sculpture of their own. Based on the sparse pictorial evidence of the republican Roman army, in Italy the Corinthian helmet evolved into a jockey-cap style helmet called the Italo-Corinthian, Etrusco-Corinthian or Apulo-Corinthian helmet, with the characteristic nose guard and eye slits becoming mere decorations on its face.Peter Connolly: The Roman Army, pp. 19 and 35. Macdonald & Company, Ltd., London, 1975. . Given many Roman appropriations of ancient Greek ideas, this change was probably inspired by the \"over the forehead\" position common in Greek art.

The adsidui were the members of the first five census classes, which were, according to the Roman historian Livy, created under the reign of Servius Tullius, the sixth legendary king of ancient Rome.Livy, History of Rome, Book I, chapter 42   and Book I, chapter 43   Under Tullius' original organisation, the first class was made of the richest, and thus best-equipped citizens, with helmet, shield, greaves, cuirass, spear and sword. As one went down through the classes and the corresponding levels of wealth, equipment went lighter and lighter.Connolly, Peter, Greece and Rome at War, pp95-96. According to Peter Connolly, the goal of Tullius' reform was to base military service on wealth, and not race, thus better integrating the Etruscans, who at that time ruled Rome and the Romans themselves; he points out, however, that in the beginning most members of the richest first class must have been Etruscans.Connolly, Peter, Greece and Rome at War, p95."]}, {"page": "2012 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["** Peter Connolly, historian (born 1935)"]}, {"page": "Deaths in May 2012", "response": ["*Peter Connolly, 77, British historian."]}, {"page": "Hadrianic Society", "response": ["The purpose of the society is to promote the study of Hadrian's Wall, the Roman Army, and Roman frontiers.
