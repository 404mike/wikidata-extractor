He was also a politician, and a member of the Parliament of Great Britain and Ireland.", "Born in London, England, Ricardo was the third surviving of the 17 children of Abigail Delvalle (1753\u20131801) and her husband Abraham Israel Ricardo (1733?\u20131812). His family were Sephardic Jews of Portuguese origin who had recently relocated from the Dutch Republic. His father was a successful stockbroker and Ricardo began working with him at the age of 14. At the age of 21 Ricardo eloped with a Quaker, Priscilla Anne Wilkinson, and, against his father's wishes, converted to Unitarianism.Francisco Solano Constancio, Paul Henri Alcide Fonteyraud. 1847. \u0152uvres compl\u00e8tes de David Ricardo, Guillaumin, (pp. v\u2013xlviii): A part sa conversion au Christianisme et son mariage avec une femme qu'il eut l'audace grande d'aimer malgr\u00e9 les ordres de son p\u00e8re This religious difference resulted in estrangement from his family, and he was led to adopt a position of independence.Ricardo, David. 1919.

Ricardo was said to have \"possessed an extraordinary quickness in perceiving in the turns of the market any accidental difference which might arise between the relative price of different stocks\" and Ricardo was able to grow his wealth dealing in securities during the Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars.", "As the Napoleonic Wars waged on, David Ricardo developed a disdain for the Corn Laws imposed by the British to encourage exports. Government intervention on the grain trade can be witnessed as far back as the 1400s, and trade has been controlled, regulated, and taxed. England was a capitalist economy involving workers and landlords consuming entire incomes and capital accumulation that depended entirely on capitalists\u2019 profits that were under perpetual pressure during the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.", "Political reform was necessary as agriculture output was struggling to keep the pace of the population growth. The Corn Laws created barriers to imports that increased the subsistence costs that created higher wages. The higher wages reduced the profits and a further effect of a reduction of capital investment and a stationary economy state. Rising rents, attributed to the Corn Laws by Ricardo came at the expense of the nations' economic profits. Free trade was the answer to the stationarity from David Ricardo, and he anticipated Britain would import agriculture products in exchange for manufactured goods. After Ricardo's death, the laws were eventually repealed, and his free-trade plan became public policy in Britain.", "He and his wife Priscilla had eight children together including Osman Ricardo (1795\u20131881; MP for Worcester 1847\u20131865), David Ricardo (1803\u20131864, MP for Stroud 1832\u20131833) and Mortimer Ricardo, who served as an officer in the Life Guards and was a deputy lieutenant for Oxfordshire.", "David Ricardo, The Principles of Political Economy and Taxation", "David Ricardo worked to fix the issues he felt were most concerning with Adam Smith\u2019s Labour Theory of Value. Both men worked with the assumption that land, labour, and capital were the three basic factors of production. However, Smith narrowed in on labour as the determinant of value. Ricardo believes that with production having 3 main factors it is impossible for only one of them to determine value on its own. Ricardo illustrates his point by adapting Smith's deer beaver analogy to show that even when labour is the only factor of production the hardship and tools of the labour will drive a wedge in the relative value of the good. Due to his criticisms of the Labour Theory of Value George Stigler called his theory a \"93% labor theory of value\".", "Ricardo's most famous work is his Principles of Political Economy and Taxation (1817).

He defined rent as \"the difference between the produce obtained by the employment of two equal quantities of capital and labour.\" Ricardo believed that the process of economic development, which increased land use and eventually led to the cultivation of poorer land, principally benefited landowners.

Cambridge: Cambridge MIT Press. p. 378. \"In spite of the fact that the Portuguese could produce both cloth and wine with less amount of labour, Ricardo suggested that both countries would benefit from trade with each other\".", "Ricardo's four magic numbers have long been interpreted as comparison of two ratios of labour (or other input in fixed supply) coefficients. This interpretation is now considered as overly simplistic by modern economists. The point was rediscovered by Roy J. RuffinRuffin, R.J. (2002) David Ricardo's discovery of comparative advantage.

Ricardo and International Trade, London and New York; Routledge, Chapter 4, pp.48\u201359.

He believed that the British \"Corn Laws\" \u2013 imposing tariffs on agricultural products \u2013 ensured that less-productive domestic land would be cultivated and rents would be driven up . Thus, profits would be directed toward landlords and away from the emerging industrial capitalists. Ricardo believed landlords tended to squander their wealth on luxuries, rather than invest. He believed the Corn Laws were leading to the stagnation of the British economy.Letter of Mill cited in The works and correspondence of David Ricardo. : Volume 9, Letters July 1821\u20131823 (Cambridge, UK, 1952) In 1846, his nephew John Lewis Ricardo, MP for Stoke-upon-Trent, advocated free trade and the repeal of the Corn Laws.", "David Ricardo's ideas had a tremendous influence on later developments in economics. US economists rank Ricardo as the second most influential economic thinker, behind Adam Smith, prior to the twentieth century.Davis, William L., Bob Figgins, David Hedengren, and Daniel B.

In each year from 1837 to 1845, he launched parliamentary debates in attempts to repeal the Corn Laws.

The bluebook produced by the Committee on Import Duties was published in pamphlet form and distributed across the country by the Anti-Corn Law League, it was reprinted in America and quoted by all leading newspapers of the day, the Spectator published it in abridged form. In February 1842, Villiers was called by Monckton Milnes MP, the \"solitary Robinson Crusoe standing on the barren rock of Corn Law repeal.\" In 1842, the majority in favour of retaining the Corn Laws had been 303, at the vote on Villiers motion in June 1845 it was down to 132. After the repeal in 1846, the press said of Villiers that he was \"the most persevering and undaunted supporter of those principles within the house.\"  David Ricardo, Chairman of the Free Traders in London, wished to raise money to give to Villiers in recognition of his work, Villiers declined this."]}, {"page": "George Julius Poulett Scrope", "response": ["Scrope perhaps felt that his efficacy was limited if he remained only a local politician.
