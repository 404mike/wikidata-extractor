He himself was the teacher of a number of important British basses, including Robert Lloyd, Willard White, John Tomlinson, Gwynne Howell and Colin Iveson. He taught the British Baritone John Rawnsley and he was also a teacher of New Zealand baritone Barry Mora.He made his operatic debut as Amonasro in Aida in Brno in 1935.  From 1936 to 1939 he sang as principal baritone at the Slovak National Theatre in Bratislava.  In 1940, he moved to England, appearing at the Savoy Theatre in Mussorgsky's The Fair at Sorochyntsi, and from 1943 to 1946 he appeared with the Carl Rosa Opera Company, singing Scarpia, Germont, the three roles in Hoffmann and other parts.  After seasons with the English Opera Group and the Netherlands Opera, he joined the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden in 1951, and sang there until 1973.Kraus specialised in villainous characters.  His roles at Covent Garden and worldwide included Don Pizarro in Fidelio, Iago in Otello and Scarpia in Tosca, as well as Alberich in the Ring cycle at the Bayreuth Festival from 1960 to 1962.  He created the roles of Nick Shadow in Stravinsky's The Rake's Progress, Tarquinius in Britten's The Rape of Lucretia, King Fisher in Michael Tippett's The Midsummer Marriage, Diomede in Walton's Troilus and Cressida, and the Sheriff in Gian Carlo Menotti's Martin's Lie.He died in London.\nThe Otakar Kraus Music Trust, a charity which provides music therapy to children and adults with special needs,\nwas founded by Dr. Margaret Lobo, a former pupil, in memory of him.\nIt was founded in 1988 in Twickenham, London and now operates in that local area and also in India.\nHis name is mentioned in the Czech film \"Cosy Dens\" (1999) by Jir\u00ed Kodet (as Kraus).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tito Gobbi", "response": ["There was, however, one incident in his relationship with Covent Garden which caused a stir. In 1955 he had been engaged as Iago in a major new production of Verdi's Otello but was delayed in reaching the theatre for rehearsal. The new music director, Rafael Kubel\u00edk, determined to impose discipline on singers, sacked him. The company baritone Otakar Kraus, already scheduled to sing some performances, took on all of them. However, a few weeks later Gobbi and Kubelik met at a party and Kubelik made an unqualified apology. The general feeling was that Kubelik was right in principle as some star singers were often reluctant to rehearse, but chose the wrong singer and circumstances, as few were more professional than Gobbi. He was back at Covent Garden as Rigoletto the following summer."]}, {"page": "The Rake's Progress", "response": ["|Otakar Kraus"]}, {"page": "Albert Herring", "response": ["|Peter Pears*,Joan Cross*,Denis Dowling,Nancy Evans*,Catherine Lawson,Gladys Parr*,Margaret Ritchie*,Otakar Kraus,Roy Ashton*,Norman Lumsden*"]}, {"page": "Kraus", "response": ["* Otakar Kraus (1909\u20131980), Czech (later British) baritone"]}, {"page": "The Rape of Lucretia", "response": ["|Otakar Kraus"]}, {"page": "Carl Rosa Opera Company", "response": ["In 1924, after another financial crisis, H.
