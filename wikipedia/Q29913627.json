The win set them up with a tie away to St Mirren in the quarter finals with a Saturday evening kick off of 7:20pm.  They continued their 2020 win-less league home run against Ross County, partly due to Dean Campbell being sent off after half-an-hour due to two bookable offences when leading the match 1\u20130.  They ended the month by defeating St Mirren in the Scottish Cup with goals from Lewis Ferguson and a late penalty from Sam Cosgrove to face Celtic in the Semi-finals on 12 April.  Unfortunately however, defender Scott McKenna was likely to be ruled out until the end of the season with a torn hamstring.
