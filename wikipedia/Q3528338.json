Sivaramakrishnan but, as is typical with expanding initialled south Indian names, turning the L to Laxmanan caused Sivaramakrishnan to appear to be his surname. Sivaramakrishnan is his given name and his father's given name was Laxmanan and hence he started out as L.

He made his debut in first-class cricket for Demerara against Barbados at Bay Pasture, Barbados in the 1891\u201392 Inter-Colonial Tournament.

His next appearances in first-class cricket came for British Guiana, playing twice against Trinidad and Barbados in the 1895\u201396 Inter-Colonial Tournament. In September 1896, he played twice for British Guiana against Jamaica at Georgetown. In February 1897, he played for the West Indies against A. A. Priestley's XI, while in March of the same year he played for British Guiana against a Lord Hawke's XI; the following month, he played for Lord Hawke's XI against British Guiana, likely due to a broken finger suffered by Hugh Bromley-Davenport, which limited his appearances on the tour. He played his final first-class match for Demerara in the final of the 1897\u201398 Inter-Colonial Tournament. A gap of four years followed before his next first-class appearance for British Guiana in September 1901. Between 1902\u201307, he made six further first-class appearances for British Guiana. In eighteen first-class appearances, he scored 255 runs at an average of 11.09 and a highest score of 55. With his left-arm fast-medium bowling, he took 25 wickets at a bowling average of 11.47, with best figures of 8 for 17. He took five wickets in an innings on two occasions and took the same number of ten wicket hauls in a match. His best figures came for Demerara on debut against Barbados. "]}]}}
