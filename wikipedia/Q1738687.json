As an academic author, his focus is on the philosophy of biology, and contemporary theories of multiculturalism, pluralism and race. These topics are core concerns in The Meaning of Race (1996), Man, Beast and Zombie (2000) and Strange Fruit: Why Both Sides Are Wrong in the Race Debate (2008).\nMalik's work contains a forthright defence of the values of the 18th-century Enlightenment, which he sees as having been distorted and misunderstood in more recent political and scientific thought. He was shortlisted for the Orwell Prize in 2010.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Islamophobia", "response": ["In 2005 Ziauddin Sardar, an Islamic scholar, wrote in the  New Statesman that Islamophobia is a widespread European phenomenon.\"The next holocaust\", New Statesman, 5 December 2005. He noted that each country has anti-Muslim political figures, citing Jean-Marie Le Pen in France; Pim Fortuyn in the Netherlands; and Philippe van der Sande of Vlaams Blok, a Flemish nationalist party in Belgium. Sardar argued that Europe is \"post-colonial, but ambivalent.\" Minorities are regarded as acceptable as an underclass of menial workers, but if they want to be upwardly mobile anti-Muslim prejudice rises to the surface. Wolfram Richter, professor of economics at Dortmund University of Technology, told Sardar: \"I am afraid we have not learned from our history. My main fear is that what we did to Jews we may now do to Muslims. The next holocaust would be against Muslims.\" Similar fears, as noted by Kenan Malik in his book From Fatwa to Jihad, had been previously expressed in the UK by Muslim philosopher Shabbir Akhtar in 1989, and Massoud Shadjareh, chair of the Islamic Human Rights Commission in 2000. In 2006 Salma Yaqoob, a Respect Party Councillor, claimed that Muslims in Britain were \"subject to attacks reminiscent of the gathering storm of anti-Semitism in the first decades of the last century.\".Malik, Kenan. From Fatwa to Jihad. Atlantic Books, London (2009): pp. 131\u201332. Malik, a senior visiting fellow in the Department of Political, International and Policy Studies at the University of Surrey, has described these claims of a brewing holocaust as \"hysterical to the point of delusion\"; whereas Jews in Hitler's Germany were given the official designation of Untermenschen, and were subject to escalating legislation which diminished and ultimately removed their rights as citizens, Malik noted that in cases where \"Muslims are singled out in Britain, it is often for privileged treatment\"  such as the 2005 legislation banning \"incitement to religious hatred\", the special funding Muslim organizations and bodies receive from local and national government, the special provisions made by workplaces, school and leisure centres for Muslims, and even suggestions by the Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams and the former Lord Chief Justice, Lord Phillips, that sharia law should be introduced into Britain.Malik (2009): p. 132 The fact is, wrote Malik, that such well-respected public figures as Akhtar, Shadjareh and Yaqoob need \"a history lesson about the real Holocaust reveals how warped the Muslim grievance culture has become.\"", "The classification of \"closed\" and \"open\" views set out in the Runnymede report has been criticized as an oversimplification of a complex issue by scholars like Chris Allen, Fred Halliday, and Kenan Malik. Paul Jackson, in a critical study of the anti-Islamic English Defence League, argues that the criteria put forward by the Runnymede report for Islamophobia \"can allow for any criticism of Muslim societies to be dismissed...\". He argues that both jihadi Islamists and far-right activists use the term \"to deflect attention away from more nuanced discussions on the make-up of Muslim communities\", feeding \"a language of polarised polemics\". On one hand, it can be used \"to close down discussion on genuine areas of criticism\" regarding jihadi ideologies, which in turn has resulted in all accusations of Islamophobia to be dismissed as \"spurious\" by far-right activists. Consequently, the term is \"losing much [of its] analytical value\"."]}, {"page": "Index of philosophy articles (I\u2013Q)", "response": ["* Kenan Malik"]}, {"page": "Language revitalization", "response": ["Kenan Malik has also argued that it is \"irrational\" to try to preserve all the world's languages, as language death is natural and in many cases inevitable, even with intervention.

Activist Peter Tatchell adopted this view after supporting the lawsuit previously. In October 2018, the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom ruled unanimously the bakers did not refuse to fulfill the customer's order because of his sexual orientation and would have refused to make a cake with this message for any customer, irrespective of their sexual orientation.

How seriously would we, and should we, take his argument?\" Philosopher Daniel Dennett argued that Harris's book Free Will successfully refuted the common understanding of free will, but that he failed to respond adequately to the compatibilist understanding of free will. Dennett said the book was valuable because it expressed the views of many eminent scientists, but that it nonetheless contained a \"veritable museum of mistakes\" and that \"Harris and others need to do their homework if they want to engage with the best thought on the topic.\" On the other hand, The Moral Landscape received a largely positive review from psychologists James Diller and Andrew Nuzzolilli. Additionally, Free Will received a mixed academic review from philosopher Paul Pardi, who acknowledged that while it suffers from some conceptual confusions and that the core argument is a bit too 'breezy', it serves as a \"good primer on key ideas in physicalist theories of freedom and the will\"."]}, {"page": "Steve Fuller (sociologist)", "response": ["**an annotated bibliography of nonsense by Kenan Malik, takes a contrary view to Fuller's (but does not refer to him), criticizing what he considers to be the unrealistically excessive relativism of science studies."]}, {"page": "Orwell Prize", "response": ["**Kenan Malik\u00a0\u2013 From Fatwa to Jihad: The Rushdie Affair and Its Legacy"]}, {"page": "Londonistan: How Britain Is Creating a Terror State Within", "response": ["According to Kenan Malik in The Independent, Phillips's arguments share some striking similarities with Islamists.
