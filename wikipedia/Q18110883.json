The British historian Antony Beevor noted the \"sinister\" message from the Stalingrad Front's Political Department on 8 October 1942 that: \"The defeatist mood is almost eliminated and the number of treasonous incidents is getting lower\" as an example of the sort of coercion Red Army soldiers experienced under the Special Detachments (later to be renamed SMERSH). On the other hand, Beevor noted the often extraordinary bravery of the Soviet soldiers in a battle that was only comparable to Verdun, and argued that terror alone cannot explain such self-sacrifice. Richard Overy addresses the question of just how important the Red Army's coercive methods were to the Soviet war effort compared with other motivational factors such as hatred for the enemy. He argues that, though it is \"easy to argue that from the summer of 1942 the Soviet army fought because it was forced to fight,\" to concentrate solely on coercion is nonetheless to \"distort our view of the Soviet war effort.\"Overy, Richard. Russia's War (New York: 1997), 201. After conducting hundreds of interviews with Soviet veterans on the subject of terror on the Eastern Front \u2013 and specifically about Order No. 227 (\"Not a step back!\") at Stalingrad \u2013 Catherine Merridale notes that, seemingly paradoxically, \"their response was frequently relief.\" Infantryman Lev Lvovich's explanation, for example, is typical for these interviews; as he recalls, \"[i]t was a necessary and important step. We all knew where we stood after we had heard it. And we all \u2013 it's true \u2013 felt better. Yes, we felt better.\""]}, {"page": "Soviet Union", "response": ["Excess deaths throughout World War I and the Russian Civil War (including the postwar famine) amounted to a combined total of 18\u00a0million, some 10\u00a0million in the 1930s, and more than 26\u00a0million in 1941\u20135. The postwar Soviet population was 45 to 50\u00a0million smaller than it would have been if pre-war demographic growth had continued.
