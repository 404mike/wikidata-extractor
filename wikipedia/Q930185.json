Buckland provided a description of the family and two species, but failed to give a description of the genus, which has led to Buckland's description of the family being considered invalid by modern taxonomic standards. In publications in 1870, Scottish botanist William Carruthers and English paleobotanist William Crawford Williamson described the first known reproductive organs of the Bennettitales from Jurassic strata of Yorkshire and Jurassic-Cretaceous strata of the Isle of Wight and the Isle of Portland. Caruthers was the first to recognise that Bennettitales had distinct differences from cycads, and established the tribes \"Williamsonieae\" and \"Bennettiteae\", with the latter being named after the genus Bennettites named by Caruthers in the same publication, the name being in honour of British botanist John Joseph Bennett. The order Bennettitales was erected German botanist Adolf Engler in 1892, who recognised the group as separate from the Cycadales.Engler, H.G.A. 1892. Syllabus der Vorlesungen \u00fcber specielle und medicinisch-pharmaceutische Botanik. xxiii + 184 pp. Gebr. Borntraeger, Berlin The Anthophyte hypothesis erected by Arber and Parking in 1907 posited that angiosperms arose from Bennettitales, as suggested by the wood-like structures and rudimentary flowers. Based on morphological data, however, Bennettitales were classified as a monophyletic group when paired with Gnetales. a study in 2006 suggested that Bennettitales, Angiosperms, and Gigantopteridales form a clade based on the presence of oleanane. A 2007 study examining phase-contrast X-ray images of gymnosperm seeds suggested that the supported the Anthophyte hypothesis. Evidence from seed coats suggest that Bennettitales form a clade with the gymnosperm orders of Gnetales and Erdtmanithecales. Molecular evidence has consistently contradicted the Anthophyte hypothesis, finding that Angiosperms are the sister group to all living gymnosperms, including Gnetales. A 2017 phylogeny based on molecular signatures of fossilised cuticles found that Bennettitales were more closely related to the Ginkgo+Cycads clade than conifers, and were closely related to Nilssonia and Ptilozamites."]}, {"page": "Royal Society Bakerian Medal", "response": ["*1877 William Crawford Williamson, On the Organization of the Fossil Plants of the Coal Measures."]}, {"page": "William Williamson", "response": ["* William Crawford Williamson (1816\u20131895), English naturalist"]}, {"page": "Williamsonia (plant)", "response": ["Williamsonia was originally described as Zamia gigas by William Crawford Williamson.
