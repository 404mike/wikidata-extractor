Proponents claim that one benefit of a graduate tax is that it would prevent a market in higher education developing whereby students chose where and what to study based upon the ability to pay rather than academic ability. A graduate tax might raise more money for universities over the long term than capped tuition fees, depending on the level of the cap. David Greenaway, a critic of a graduate tax admits that an \"obvious attraction\" of such a tax is that it is levied only on graduates, the immediate beneficiaries of higher education.Greenaway, David, Haynes, Michelle, Funding Higher Education in the  UK: The Role of Fees and Loans, The Economic Journal, 113 (February), F150 - F166"]}, {"page": "2014 Birthday Honours", "response": ["* Professor David Greenaway,  \u2013 Vice-Chancellor, University of Nottingham "]}, {"page": "Shape of Training review", "response": ["The Shape of Training was a review of postgraduate medical education and training in the United Kingdom, which reported in 2013.

In particular, G\u00f6rg argues that a firm entering a foreign market via FDI is generally best off by acquiring an existing indigenous high-technology firm in order to form a duopoly with an indigenous low-technology firm instead of setting up an entirely new plant (greenfield investment).G\u00f6rg, H. (2000). Analysing foreign market entry - The choice between greenfield investment and acquisitions. Journal of Economic Studies, 27(3), pp. 165-181. Together with Strobl and Frank Barry, he moreover finds that both \"efficiency agglomerations\", i.e. increases in firms' efficiency due to reductions in the distance between them, and \"demonstration effects\", i.e. firms' signals to new investors that the host country is reliable and attractive, were important determinants of U.S. firm entry into Ireland.Barry, F., G\u00f6rg, H., Strobl, E. (2003). Foreign direct investment, agglomerations, and demonstration effects: An empirical investigation. Review of World Economics, 139(4), pp. 583-600. Reviewing the literature on FDI and intra-industry spillovers with David Greenaway, G\u00f6rg and Greenaway conclude that empirical evidence for a positive impact of foreign direct investment through productivity, wage and export spillovers from the pre-2000s is at best mixed and warrants further research.G\u00f6rg, H., Greenaway, D. (2001). Foreign direct investment and intra-industry spillovers: A review of the literature. Nottingham: Leverhulme Centre for Research on Globalisation and Economic Policy.G\u00f6rg, H., Greenaway, D. (2004). Much ado about nothing? Do domestic firms really benefit from foreign direct investment? World Bank Research Observer, 19(2), pp. 171-197. In another study with Strobl and Barrios, G\u00f6rg finds that while inward FDI in Ireland may have initially deterred the entry of local firms by signalling an increase in competition, this initial effect has been exceeded by positive externalities fostering the development of local firms, resulting in an overall strongly positive impact of FDI on the local economy.Barrios, S., G\u00f6rg, H., Strobl, E. (2005). Foreign direct investment, competition and industrial development in the host country. European Economic Review, 49(7), pp. 1761-1784. With Girma, he also finds that British establishments' ability to benefit from productivity spillovers from FDI depends on their absorptive capacity.Girma, S., G\u00f6rg, H. (2005). Foreign direct investment, spillovers and absorptive capacity: Evidence from quantile regressions. Bundesbank Discussion Paper Series 1: Economic Studies, No. 13. Finally, G\u00f6rg and Paolo Figini argue that the impact of FDI on wage inequality depends on countries' economic development: In developing countries, inward FDI degressively increases wage inequality, whereas inward FDI in developed countries decreases wage inequality.Figini, P., G\u00f6rg, H. (2011). Does foreign direct investment affect wage inequality? An empirical investigation. World Economy, 34(9), pp. 1455-1475."]}, {"page": "Denise R.
