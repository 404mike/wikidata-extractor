Bunker is best known as the original drummer of the rock band  Jethro Tull, playing in the band from 1967 until 1971. Never a self-professed technical drummer, Bunker engaged with the essence of blues and rock and roll, influenced by Ginger Baker and Mitch Mitchell.

They signed a management deal with Terry Ellis and Chris Wright and replaced Smith with guitarist Mick Abrahams, but quickly realised that supporting a 6-piece band was financially impractical, and the group split up. Anderson, Abrahams and Cornick decided to stay together, recruiting Abrahams' friend Clive Bunker on drums and becoming a British blues band. Cornick recalled that although Evan left, the band said he was welcome to rejoin at a later date. Anderson shared a ground-floor flat with Cornick in a large house at the top of Studley Road in Luton,Zigzag, July 1976 and worked as a cleaner for the Luton Ritz Cinema to pay the rent.BBC Radio interview, March 1979 According to Cornick, \"we were so poor that we would share one can of stew or soup between us each evening.\"", "* Clive Bunker\u00a0\u2013 drums, percussion (1967\u20131971)"]}, {"page": "1946 in music", "response": ["*December 12 \u2013 Clive Bunker (Jethro Tull)"]}, {"page": "Thick as a Brick", "response": ["The album was recorded in late 1971, featuring music composed by Anderson and arranged with the contribution of all band members.

The live show promoting the album included the playing of the full suite, with various comic interludes. Thick as a Brick is considered by critics to be the first Jethro Tull release to entirely consist of progressive rock music. It received mixed reviews upon its release, but was a commercial success and topped various charts in 1972. Today it is regarded as a classic of progressive rock, and has received several accolades.

After an American tour, bass player Glenn Cornick was fired from the band, and was replaced with Jeffrey Hammond, an old friend of Ian Anderson. Aqualung would be Hammond's first album with the band. It would also mark the first time John Evan had recorded a full album with the band, as his only prior involvement was to provide several keyboard parts on the previous 1970 album, Benefit. In December, the album became one of the first to be recorded at the newly opened studios of Island Records in Basing Street, London. Led Zeppelin were recording their untitled fourth album at the same time. In an interview on the 25th anniversary edition of the album, Tull's bandleader Ian Anderson said that trying to record in that studio was very difficult, because of its \"horrible, cold, echoey\" feel. There were two recording studios at the location; Led Zeppelin worked in the smaller studio while Tull got the larger, which was the main body of a converted church. The orchestral segments were arranged by Dee Palmer, who had worked with the band since 1968's This Was, and would later join as a keyboard player. The master reels were assembled at Apple Studios on 2 March 1971.

During the recording of This Was, frontman Ian Anderson began writing new material which differed from the straight blues/jazz fusion style which the band were known for at the time. Anderson estimated that he wrote \"50 percent\" of Stand Up during the summer of 1968. Anderson wrote the album's songs on an acoustic guitar in his bedsit in Kentish Town, London, and cited Roy Harper, Ornette Coleman, Charlie Parker, Bert Jansch, Pentangle, Blind Faith and Jimi Hendrix as inspirations. The new material's departure from the band's blues-based style caused conflict with guitarist Mick Abrahams, who was a blues purist: Anderson recalled \"running some of [the new songs] by Mick Abrahams, and coming to the conclusion that they weren't going up to be up his street at all\" while drummer Clive Bunker stated that \"when Ian started to write new and different stuff, that's when we realised we were going to have serious problems, because Mick just didn't want to do it.\" The stylistic clash resulted in Abrahams' departure from the band in December 1968. The band initially began rehearsals for Stand Up with Black Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi, however Iommi left the band after only a few weeks as he felt he did not fit in well with the group. The job eventually went to Martin Barre, who immediately joined rehearsals for Stand Up before making his live debut with the band on 30 December 1968.", "The album still shows a great blues influence, as in the first track \"A New Day Yesterday\". Some songs on the album exhibit unusual instrumentation, such as \"Fat Man\" played on a mandolin and \"Jeffery Goes to Leicester Square\" played on a balalaika. The acoustic pieces, like \"Reasons for Waiting\", already show Anderson under the influence of Roy Harper. The instrumental \"Bour\u00e9e\" (one of Jethro Tull's popular concert pieces) is a jazzy re-working of \"Bourr\u00e9e in E minor\" by Johann Sebastian Bach.
