The club's most successful season came in 1987, as Rice and Hadlee marked their departure with the double of County Championship and NatWest Trophy. Chris Broad and Tim Robinson continued the club's long tradition of batting excellence into the England team but for some years the club struggled to repeat those achievements, although they did claim a Benson & Hedges Cup in 1989 and a Sunday League title in 1991 under Robinson's captaincy. Former Warwickshire off spinner Eddie Hemmings made a significant contribution while local seam bowler Kevin Cooper was a consistent wicket taker."]}, {"page": "Herefordshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["* Kevin Cooper"]}, {"page": "Kevin Cooper", "response": ["Kevin Cooper may refer to:", "* Kevin Cooper (prisoner) (born 1958), inmate on death row in California", "* Kevin Cooper (footballer) (born 1975), English footballer", "* Kevin Cooper (cricketer) (born 1957), English first class cricketer", "* Kevin Cooper (lacrosse) (born 1991), American lacrosse player"]}, {"page": "Henry Twizell", "response": ["Joining Gloucestershire, he made his first-class debut for the county against the touring Zimbabweans.
