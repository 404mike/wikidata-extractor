In reply to Worcestershire's total of 299, the Services batsmen piled on the runs, with three batsmen making hundreds and successive partnerships of 100, 160, 109, 100 and 79* before declaring with their score on 548/4. Rudge did not take a wicket, but he was the most economical of all Worcestershire's bowlers, with figures of 12-2-36-0.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Rudge", "response": ["*Lloyd Rudge (1934\u20131990), English cricketer"]}]}}
