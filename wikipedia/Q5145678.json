The result is surprisingly persuasive.  [Its analyses] are thought-provoking and, in places, offer fresh ways of understanding what happened.\"Colin White, The Mariner\u2019s Mirror: The Journal of the Society for Nautical Research, November 2003 Similarly, in the International Journal of Maritime History, Paul Webb wrote: \"This effort by Hayward merits serious attention. ... [It] provides many fresh insights into the workings of Nelson's mind. ... There is no question Hayward has done his work and supports it by solid research. He poses important questions and proffers plausible answers. He clearly admires Nelson, but is quick to recognise his faults and his contradictory character traits. Any serious Nelson student will benefit from this book.\"Paul Webb, International Journal of Maritime History, Vol. XV No. 2 (December 2003), pp. 486-487."]}]}}
