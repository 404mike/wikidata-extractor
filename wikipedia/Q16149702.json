He is rude towards Keanu and when he returns later, Keanu explains that the parts need to be ordered. Sharon Mitchell (Letitia Dean) tells Henry to go elsewhere, so he asks for his money back, but Sharon says he should behave in a more civilised manner. Henry then drives his car away after telling Sharon to keep the cash and he will look her up when he comes back. Sharon and Keanu realise they still have his spare keys and know where he lives, so they steal his car and plan to put it into storage and wrack up speeding fines. The next day, Henry returns and meets Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden), accusing him, Keanu or Sharon of stealing his car. Phil tells him he must have lost his keys. Phil then finds out what happened from Sharon, and Keanu brings back Henry's car, then they leave it at Max Branning's (Jake Wood) car lot so they can falsely accuse Max of the theft. However, Max and his wife, Rainie Branning (Tanya Franks) realise they are being set up and have the car removed and sold."]}, {"page": "List of British films of 2017", "response": ["|| Director: John Jencks  Cast: Roger Allam, Rod Glenn, Andrew Alexander, Russell Tovey, Paul Bown, Emily Berrington"]}, {"page": "Ladhood", "response": ["Ladhood is a British coming of age comedy series that premiered on BBC iPlayer on 24 November 2019.
