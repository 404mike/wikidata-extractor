He also produced such classic films as The Lady Vanishes (1938). Black has been called \"one of the unsung heroes of the British film industry.\" In 1946 Mason called Black \"the one good production executive\" that J. Arthur Rank had. Frank Launder called Black \"a great showman and yet he had a great feeling for scripts and spent more time on them than anyone I have ever known. His experimental films used to come off as successful as his others.\"Black specialized in making comedies, thrillers and low-budget musicals. He had a lot of success making comedy vehicles for stars such as Will Hay and Arthur Askey. He also produced early films from Carol Reed and Alfred Hitchcock and was an early supporter of writer directors Sidney Gilliat and Frank Launder.", "link_mentions": {}}}
