She goes to stay with Pauline's son Mark Fowler (Todd Carty) for a while, and at somepoint encounters Ashley (now Frankie Fitzgerald) after he runs away from home. Eventually, Nick himself returns to the square and reunites with Dot \u2013 who is shocked to see her son once more. Initially skeptical over Nick's previous criminality, Dot is pleased to have her family around and moves out of the Fowler household to live with them. Mark, however, is unimpressed due to his longstanding feud with Nick and the two end up clashing with each other on multiple occasions. At one point in New Year's Day 2001, Mark spikes Nick's drink and causes him to fall off a railway bridge in revenge for the trouble he has caused to his family. Nick vows revenge and calls the police on Mark, before telling Dot about the incident. At first she accuses Mark, but later believes his story and the pair work together to deal with Nick's temporarily paralysis. Months later, Nick's feud with Mark leads him to cut the breaks on Mark's motorbike in an attempt to kill his rival. However, Ashley unknowingly takes the bait instead and ends up crashing the motorbike at the launderette in front of his family and the Fowlers. Ashley is confirmed to have died and Dot is devastated. On the night before Ashley's funeral, Dot is horrified to learn that her son is responsible for Ashley's death upon overhearing Nick telling Mark about this during another confrontation between them. The following day, Ashley's funeral takes place and Dot later confronts Nick over the fact that he caused Ashley's death. She then disowns Nick, telling him that he is no longer her son, and he leaves Albert Square in disgrace.", "Other storylines have concentrated on Dot's various attempts to reform Nick, such as in 1991, when Nick returned with a heroin addiction. As the plot unfolded, Dot tried to curtail Nick's addiction by locking him in his room and forcing him to go cold turkey. His resulting paranoia and cravings led him to escape and murder the first person he encountered, The Queen Victoria landlord Eddie Royle (Michael Melia). The episode where Eddie was murdered was the big autumn launch episode for 1991. Nick stood trial in January 1993; however, \"he got away with murder\" for a second time in the serial. Other scams have included Nick's attempt to con Dot by claiming he had AIDS in 1998 after escaping from prison, which ultimately led to Dot having him re-imprisoned. Then followed a plot that saw him largely responsible for the death of his son Ashley (Frankie Fitzgerald) in June 2001, ultimately leading Dot to disown Nick and prompting to leave the Square again. He is not seen for more than seven years after this, although he was mentioned in 2006 when recovering from cancer off-screen."]}, {"page": "Mark Fowler", "response": ["In 2000, Mark's past troubles resurface when Nick returns to the square and the two embark on a longstanding feud. This soon gets Mark's younger brother, Martin (James Alexandrou), involved when Nick attempts to ensnare him with drugs \u2013 as he once did with Mark. Towards the end of the year, Nick gets one over Mark after giving Martin ecstasy. When Mark discovers this, he decides to settle the score with his tormentor once and for all. Mark spikes Nick's drink, leads him up to the Walford viaduct, and watches delightedly as the intoxicated Nick falls \u2013 just as midnight strikes and 2001 commences. Nick survives the fall, but is left severely crippled and vows revenge against Mark. He enlists his son Ashley (Frankie Fitzgerald), who had recently befriended Martin, to take revenge on Mark. However, when Ashley is hesitant to kill Mark himself, Nick takes matters into his own hands and drains the brake fluid on his motorbike. The next day, Ashley \u2013 not knowing that his father had done \u2013 steals Mark's motorbike and attempts to run him over in a last-ditch attempt to impress his father, but is killed after he ends up crashing into the launderette. On the eve of Ashley's funeral, Mark and Nick have their final showdown when Nick attempts to kill Mark with a knife. Mark overpowers Nick, who then blurts out that he should've been the one on the motorbike instead of Ashley \u2013 thus exposing his involvement in his son's death. Mark berates Nick for causing his own son's death, then leaves him to be disowned by his mother Dot (June Brown) \u2013 who had just overheard Nick confess to his role in Ashley's death.

He reappeared and left several times during the first few years of the show, causing maximum havoc every time, and it wasn't long before the tabloids had begun to brand the character \"Nasty Nick\". Altman has commented: \"I think they keep bringing Nick back because he's one of the characters on British TV that people just love to hate\". This dislike of the character by the public was shared by the fictional residents of Walford, with Altman explaining: \"Every time he comes back he gets shunned by one and all. It's like being the bad cowboy come riding into town - everybody puts down the shutters and locks up the bar.\" The character's appearance was tailored to suit this unlikable, \"nasty\" image, with EastEnders series consultant Simon Ashdown commenting; \"When he comes on, you know this guy is bad. He's got the black hair and the scowl and the leather jacket. He is like that, he is a Dickensian baddy.\" Frankie Fitzgerald, who played Nick's son Ashley Cotton from 2000 to 2001, agreed: \"The look of Nasty Nick, you know, he was a bad guy.

This leads to Jamie confronting Martin at his house on Christmas Day, after which Jamie is ordered to leave by Martin's mother Pauline (Wendy Richard), with the help from Dot's infamous son Nick (John Altman) and his wayward offspring, Ashley (Frankie Fitzgerald). Afterwards, Jamie helps Sonia raise her daughter Chloe after Martin refuses to be part of her life at first. But, this changes again when Chloe is put up for adoption and Sonia resorts to kidnapping her child, whom she later renames Rebecca. In the end, Sonia keeps the child and attempts to rebuild her romance with Jamie. This appears to not be the case when Jamie begins dating her neighbour Zoe Slater (Michelle Ryan) in light of the situation, which later prompts Sonia to become close with Martin's colleague Gus Smith (Mohammed George).

Nick contacts Ashley a few months later and they reconcile.
