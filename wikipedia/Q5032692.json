HIT's advertisement in the English-language press said union demands for a 20 percent raise would \"create an impact across other industries and cause irreparable damage to Hong Kong.\" Canning Fok, managing director of the Hutchsion Whampoa group, publicly alleged that Lee Cheuk-yan was not genuinely interested in helping the workers and harboured ulterior motives. He criticised Lee for \"resort[ing] to every means ... hoping that as the strike drags on, he can negotiate with Mr Li so as to boost his own publicity.\" Fok likened the style of the dispute to the Cultural Revolution, \"where people are vilified on banners and posters\". The SCMP estimated the series of adverts would have cost around HK$1 million.
