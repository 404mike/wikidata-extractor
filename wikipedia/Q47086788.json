Despite this revival and the interest that it received in late Victorian England, the practice died out soon after the death of Hutton in 1910. Interest in the physical application of historical fencing techniques remained largely dormant during the first half of the 20th century due to a number of factors."]}, {"page": "Bartitsu", "response": ["Via correspondence with Professor Jigoro Kano, the founder of Kodokan Judo, and other contacts in Japan, Barton-Wright arranged for Japanese jujutsu practitioners Kaneo Tani, Seizo Yamamoto and the nineteen-year-old Yukio Tani to travel to London and serve as instructors at the Bartitsu Club. Kaneo Tani and Yamamoto soon returned to Japan, but Yukio Tani stayed and was shortly joined by another young jujutsuka, Sadakazu Uyenishi. Swiss master-at-arms Pierre Vigny and wrestler Armand Cherpillod were also employed as teachers at the Club. As well as teaching well-to-do Londoners, their duties included performing demonstrations and competing in challenge matches against fighters representing other combat styles. In addition, the Club became the headquarters for a group of fencing antiquarians led by Captain Alfred Hutton and it served as their base for experimenting with historical fencing techniques, which they taught to members of London's acting elite for use in stage combat. It is likely that the actors Esme Beringer and Charles Sefton, as well as fencer Archibald Corble, were among Hutton's historical fencing students at the Bartitsu Club."]}, {"page": "The October Man", "response": ["*Esme Beringer as Miss Heap"]}, {"page": "Castle in the Air (film)", "response": ["* Esme Beringer as Mrs. Thompson, a tenant"]}, {"page": "Something in the City", "response": ["* Esme Beringer as Miss Prouncey"]}, {"page": "Dark Secret (film)", "response": ["* Esme Beringer as Elderly Lady  "]}, {"page": "Esm\u00e9 Beringer", "response": ["#REDIRECT Esme Beringer"]}, {"page": "Aim\u00e9e Daniell Beringer", "response": ["Aim\u00e9e Daniell married composer Oscar Beringer in 1873.
