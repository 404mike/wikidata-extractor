In 1935, Peter Creswell directed a broadcast of the relatively complete text (only the Bianca subplot was trimmed) on National Programme, starring Mary Hinton and Godfrey Tearle. This was the first non-theatrical version of the play to feature Sly, who was played by Stuart Robertson. In 1941, Creswell directed another adaptation for BBC Home Service, again starring Tearle, with Fay Compton as Katherina.

A mixture of crime drama and political thriller, it revolves around the efforts of widowed policeman Ronald Craven (played by Bob Peck) to unravel the truth behind the murder of his daughter Emma (played by Joanne Whalley). Craven's investigations soon lead him into a murky world of government and corporate cover-ups and nuclear espionage, pitting him against dark forces that threaten the future of life on Earth.", "* Ronald Craven was played by Bob Peck, an actor who was well known in theatre but, at the time he was cast as Craven, had appeared in only minor roles on television. In creating the role of Craven, Peck drew upon his experience gained from the two years he played the title role in Macbeth for the Royal Shakespeare Company. Notable roles after Edge of Darkness included On the Black Hill (1987), Slipstream (1989), Natural Lies (1992) and Jurassic Park (1993). He died in 1999.", "By 1983, Jonathan Powell was keen to put the serial into production and offered the scripts to producer Michael Wearing who was immediately impressed by the scenes in the first episode, \"Compassionate Leave\", depicting Craven's reaction to Emma's death, describing them as \"the most sustained evocation of individual grief in bereavement that I can remember\".Pixley, Get It While It's Hot, p. 54. The budget was set at \u00a32 million, of which \u00a3400,000 came from an American co-producer, Lionheart Television International. Director Martin Campbell came on board shortly afterwards and soon clashed with Troy Kennedy Martin, demanding rewrites, in particular to the notion that Craven had known about Emma's involvement with GAIA right from the start; this was removed at Campbell's behest.Pixley, Get It While It's Hot, p. 54 - 55. Further clashes over the script occurred between Kennedy Martin and star Bob Peck over the conclusion in which his character would turn into a tree; Peck recalled that \"it didn't seem to be working in script terms, it seemed as though we wouldn't be able to make it work for the audience\", a view echoed by Michael Wearing who felt that it was \"likely not to come off as an effect\". Kennedy Martin capitulated, introducing instead the concept of the black flowers seen in the finished production. However, some elements of Kennedy Martin's original vision persist in the final script: for example, in episode three, \"Burden of Proof\", the ghost of Emma urges Craven, as he undergoes a breakdown, to be strong, like a tree.Lavender, Edge of Darkness (Troy Kennedy Martin), p. 113.", "Shooting on Edge of Darkness began on 9 July 1984 and ran for five months until 5 December 1984.Pixley, Into The Shadows, p. 50. Location filming took place in London (including the Barbican Arts Centre, BBC Television Centre and the Hilton International Kensington), Yorkshire (including the headquarters of the West Yorkshire Police in Bradford, the Middleton Railway, the headquarters of Systime Computers (now the Arlington Business Centre) in Leeds where Craven hacks into the MI5 computer and at Westwood Cottage, Ilkley (for Craven's home), Scotland (including the Gleneagles Hotel, where Jedburgh addresses the NATO conference and also where President Reagan's Reykjav\u00edk policy was formulatedInglis, Citizenship and the Media, p. 55.) and Wales (including Clogau Gold Mine and Manod, Blaenau Ffestiniog doubling as Northmoor with the hot cell a set constructed at a factory in Penygroes).Pixley, Into The Shadows, passim Throughout the entire shoot, the production continued to be known as Magnox; the title Dark Forces was briefly considered before the serial was renamed Edge of Darkness in April 1985. As the shoot progressed it became apparent to the cast and crew that they had a potential hit on their hands; Bob Peck recalled, \"I think we knew when we were making it that it was a good piece of work\" while Kennedy Martin told reporters \"I haven't had this feeling about something for 20 years. It's wonderful, after all this time, to get something that actually works\".", "Edge of Darkness was promoted on the cover of the listings magazine Radio Times and was broadcast on Monday nights on BBC2 at 9:30pm, beginning 4 November 1985.Pixley, Into The Shadows, p. 51. The serial averaged an audience of 4 million viewers over its run.Cooke, British Television Drama: A History, p. 147. The critical response was generally positive with most commentators concentrating their praise on Peck's performance as Craven and the scale of the programme's political themes. \"A good television thriller is very hard to find but Edge of Darkness promises to be one of the best\", wrote Celia Brayfield in The Times, \"The central character is played by Bob Peck, who has the gift of looking tragic and intelligent simultaneously. [...] There was humour to lift the gloom and superb characterisation to flesh out the stock situation\". Ruth Baumgarten, in The Listener, praised the serial as \"a grandiosely ambitious and compelling piece of fiction\". Speaking on the BBC's review programme Did You See...?, the writer Sarah Dunant said, \"this is a very classy piece of television drama, on all levels, I think on the plot level, I think on the level of emotion and I think stylistically [...] it looks absolutely wonderful, it's shot like a feature film\". Not so impressed was Byron Rogers, television critic of The Sunday Times, who initially hailed the series as one that \"stayed in the mind and will stay there long [...] because of its portrayal of human grief\" but later felt he was \"beginning to find Edge of Darkness slightly irritating\" and decried the final episode as \"an insult to its considerable following\".", "* Won: Best Actor (Bob Peck).", "* Won: Best Actor (Bob Peck) (joint winner with Ben Kingsley for Silas Marner).", "The serial was re-issued on VHS in 1998 by Revelation Films who also issued the serial on DVD in 1999.
