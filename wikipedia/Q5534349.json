His musical career began as the falsettist lead singer and rhythm guitarist of The Rockin' Berries in 1961, which had a number of hits in the UK and Europe.  The group was best known for its covers, and Turton did much of the searching and decision work as to what was to be sung.When the group broke up in 1968 Turton started a solo career, releasing a single \"Don't You Believe It\" on Piccadilly Records. It flopped, and Piccadilly head John Schroeder suggested that Turton change his name to Jefferson. At that time, Turton recorded the original version of \"Love Grows (Where My Rosemary Goes)\" (unreleased). The single \"Montage\" failed to chart, but its follow-up \"Colour of My Love\" was a hit in the UK (peaking at No. 22 in the UK Singles Chart) and the United States (reaching No. 68 on the Billboard Hot 100), and an LP was issued following its success. A third single, \"Baby Take Me in Your Arms\", was not a hit in the UK but cracked the Top 30 in the U.S. (No. 23) and Canada (No. 15), justifying the release of a North American album. At the time of this single's success, Turton was hurt in a car crash, and so he did not make any live appearances. After a six-month hospital stay, Turton recorded a second which was never released by his label Pye Records, and his career stalled in the UK. He began touring the U.S., where he was still able to get gigs based on the success of \"Baby Take Me in Your Arms\". He then secured a recording contract with Polygram Records, released another album and the single \"I Love You This Much\" (later covered by Mouth & MacNeal on the album Pocket Full of Hits).\nHe resumed under his given name when The Rockin' Berries reunited in the late 1970s, and toured with them (as well as doing solo shows in the UK) into the 1990s. In 2001, Castle Records released The Colour of My Love -- The Pye Anthology, a CD composed of his 1969 album The Colour of My Love plus much of his previously unreleased Pye material.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Move", "response": ["In 2014, the band toured as the Move with a lineup consisting of Bevan, Burton, Tree, keyboardist/vocalist Abby Brant, and guitarist/vocalist Tony Kelsey.

In December 2014 the Bev Bevan Band completed their \"Stand Up And Rock\" tour, which lasted for almost 50 dates, in conjunction with Bevan's childhood friend Jasper Carrott.

An early keyboard player with the group was Christine Perfect, later Christine McVie of Fleetwood Mac. When another band was formed locally, by singer Paul Hewitt, guitarist Doug Thompson and drummer Terry Bond, Botfield agreed to join on condition that it used the \"Rockin' Berries\" name. By mid 1961, the group comprised Botfield (lead guitar), Doug Thompson (rhythm guitar), Tim Munns (bass), Dennis Ryland (saxophone), Terry Bond (drums), and singers Paul Hewitt and Jimmy Powell. Later that year, the group went to Germany to play a series of club engagements, with Hewitt being replaced by singer and Elvis Presley impressionist Clive Lea. On their return, the group auditioned for promoter Jack Good, who wanted to sign Powell but not the rest of the group. After a few months, Powell left for a solo career, later leading the Five Dimensions who for a while included Rod Stewart. Thompson, Ryland and shortly afterwards Munns also left, and were replaced by singer and guitarist Geoff Turton \u2014 an old friend of Botfield's \u2014 and bassist Roy Austin.", "The commercial fortunes of the group declined thereafter, although \"You're My Girl\" (1965) and \"The Water Is Over My Head\" (1966) were minor chart hits. They regularly featured Clive Lea's impersonations and group comedy routines, remained a popular live act on the cabaret circuit, and appeared at the 1967 Royal Variety Performance. Geoff Turton left the group in 1968, and had a briefly successful solo career as Jefferson, with two Billboard Hot 100 hits in the US in 1969\u201370. Clive Lea left in 1970, and was replaced by Terry Webster. The Rockin' Berries continued to perform as a music and comedy act in cabaret, with numerous later personnel changes.
