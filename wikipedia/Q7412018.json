In 1798, Barber was appointed to teach drawing at the Free Grammar School on New Street holding classes in his studio on the corner of Edmund Street and Newhall Street. By the mid-1780s he was well established as the town's first drawing master, with an academy training artists on Great Charles Street. His pupils there included David Cox, William Radclyffe and Samuel Lines, who was to form his own academy in Newhall Street in 1807.", "Charles and Vincent Barber, with the elder Barber's former pupil Samuel Lines, set up a separate academy of life drawing in 1809, that would eventually evolve into the Royal Birmingham Society of Artists and Birmingham School of Art.", "Joseph Barber's own work consists largely of drawings and watercolours of rustic landscape scenes - including pictures of North Wales, which he was the first of many Birmingham artists to paint. His works feature in the collections of the British Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum and Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery. Samuel Lines wrote of him, 'He was a very talented artist of the old school. He drew the figure and painted landscape well. Most of his time was employed in teaching drawing, chiefly in Indian ink and tinted with colours - such was at that time the manner of making watercolour drawings'."]}, {"page": "Samuel Rostill Lines", "response": ["Born in Birmingham, he was the third son of Samuel Lines, one of the founders of the academy for the training of artists that would eventually evolve into the Royal Birmingham Society of Artists and Birmingham School of Art.

Three years later he began his artistic training by attending the drawing classes of John Vincent Barber and Samuel Lines."]}, {"page": "Art of Birmingham", "response": ["Particularly significant was Daniel Bond, whose career started as a painter and japanner in Boulton's Soho Manufactory, but who is recorded as exhibiting landscapes at the Society of Artists of Great Britain in London by 1761. He was to exhibit over forty works in London over following decades and it is with him that emerges the distinctive Birmingham School of landscape painting, whose influence was to last into the mid 19th century. Bond taught drawing and had a wide influence within the town \u2013 a pupil of his exhibited A Drawing of Landscape after Mr Bond of Birmingham at the Free Society of Artists in London as early as 1763. Among Bond's other pupils was Edward Barber, who also established himself as a drawing master within Birmingham, and whose elder brother Joseph Barber had established his own academy of drawing in Great Charles Street by 1780, which was continued after his death in 1811 by his son Vincent Barber. Among Joseph Barber's pupils was Samuel Lines, who established another academy in nearby Newhall Street in 1807. It is through these networks of teaching that the Birmingham tradition of landscape was developed and sustained, with notable later figures including Thomas Baker and Thomas Creswick \u2013 a pupil of both Lines and Barber, who was to become a notable Royal Academician in the 1850s and 1860s.", "Artistic activity in late Georgian Birmingham was not restricted to landscape painting. A century later the London-based Magazine of Art could describe Birmingham as \"perhaps the most artistic town in England\", and the changes that would result in this transformation had already started by the 1780s. A local trade directory of 1785 lists twenty four professional artists, including the portraitist James Millar, the still life painter Moses Haughton and the portrait miniature painter James Bisset. Of widest influence was the Birmingham School of engravers \u2013 a separate group to the landscape artists but emerging similarly from the drawing academies of Joseph Barber, Vincent Barber and Samuel Lines. Formed around the younger Barber's pupils William Radclyffe, James Tibbitts Willmore and John Pye, and Lines' pupil William Wyon, this group were to dominate high-quality European printmaking in the 1850s and 1860s and revolutionise the art of book illustration, bringing contemporary art to a much wider public than ever before.; ; ", "The first decades of the 19th century saw the gradual development of the institutions that would come to dominate the artistic life of Victorian Birmingham. In 1809 a group of eight artists including Samuel Lines, Charles Barber and Vincent Barber opened an academy of life drawing in Peck Lane, now the site of New Street railway station. This held its first exhibition of members' work in 1814 as the Birmingham Academy of Arts, and was refounded as the Birmingham Society of Arts under the patronage of wealthy local businessmen in 1821."]}, {"page": "Thomas Garner (engraver)", "response": ["Garner, born at Birmingham in 1789, received instruction in the art of engraving from Samuel Lines.

In particular the Birmingham School is notable for its emphasis on character as well as precision in its portrayal of nature; for example often depicting trees in a manner that has more in common with portraiture, and showing \"a quest for the essential, the quiddity of what is observed\". Many of the artists were also related by training: Bond taught in the 1760s and pupils of his exhibited at the Free Society of Artists in London in 1763; Joseph Barber opened a drawing academy in 1801 where pupils included Cox and Baker; and Samuel Lines opened another academy in 1806 where pupils included Creswick.", "*Samuel Lines (1778\u20131863)"]}, {"page": "Henry Harris Lines", "response": ["Henry Harris Lines (born 1800 or 1801, died 1889) was a landscape artist and archaeologist, and the eldest son of Birmingham artist and drawing master Samuel Lines (1778\u20131863).
