He was President of the Royal Society (UK), the most important association of naturalists in the world in the nineteenth century. He built several giant telescopes.\nHis 72-inch telescope, built in 1845 and colloquially known as the \"Leviathan of Parsonstown\", was the world's largest telescope, in terms of aperture size, until the early 20th century. From April 1807 until February 1841, he was styled as Baron Oxmantown.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "June 17", "response": ["*1800 \u2013 William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse, English-Irish astronomer and politician (d. 1867)"]}, {"page": "1867", "response": ["* October 31 \u2013 William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse, Irish astronomer (b. 1800)"]}, {"page": "1800", "response": ["* June 17 \u2013 William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse, Irish astronomer (d. 1867)"]}, {"page": "Andromeda Galaxy", "response": ["Star charts of that period labeled it as the Little Cloud. In 1612, the German astronomer Simon Marius gave an early description of the Andromeda Galaxy based on telescopic observations. Pierre Louis Maupertuis conjectured in 1745 that the blurry spot was an island universe. In 1764, Charles Messier cataloged Andromeda as object M31 and incorrectly credited Marius as the discoverer despite it being visible to the naked eye. In 1785, the astronomer William Herschel noted a faint reddish hue in the core region of Andromeda. He believed Andromeda to be the nearest of all the \"great nebulae\", and based on the color and magnitude of the nebula, he incorrectly guessed that it was no more than 2,000 times the distance of Sirius, or roughly . In 1850, William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse  made the first drawing of Andromeda's spiral structure."]}, {"page": "Crab Nebula", "response": ["The Crab Nebula (catalogue designations M1, NGC 1952, Taurus A) is a supernova remnant and pulsar wind nebula in the constellation of Taurus. The common name comes from William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse, who observed the object in 1842 using a  telescope and produced a drawing that looked somewhat like a crab. The nebula was discovered by English astronomer John Bevis in 1731, and it corresponds with a bright supernova recorded by Chinese astronomers in 1054. The nebula was the first astronomical object identified that corresponds with a historical supernova explosion.", "William Herschel observed the Crab Nebula numerous times between 1783 and 1809, but it is not known whether he was aware of its existence in 1783, or if he discovered it independently of Messier and Bevis. After several observations, he concluded that it was composed of a group of stars. William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse observed the nebula at Birr Castle in 1844 using a  telescope, and referred to the object as the \"Crab Nebula\" because a drawing he made of it looked like a crab. He observed it again later, in 1848, using a  telescope but could not confirm the supposed resemblance, but the name stuck nevertheless."]}, {"page": "Crab", "response": ["Both the constellation Cancer and the astrological sign Cancer are named after the crab, and depicted as a crab. William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse drew the Crab Nebula in 1848 and noticed its similarity to the animal; the Crab Pulsar lies at the centre of the nebula. The Moche people of ancient Peru worshipped nature, especially the sea, and often depicted crabs in their art. In Greek mythology, Karkinos was a crab that came to the aid of the Lernaean Hydra as it battled Heracles. One of Rudyard Kipling's Just So Stories, The Crab that Played with the Sea, tells the story of a gigantic crab who made the waters of the sea go up and down, like the tides.
