Vardy has also played for the England national team.\nAfter being released by Sheffield Wednesday at the age of 16, Vardy began his senior career with Stocksbridge Park Steels, breaking into the first team in 2007 and spending three seasons there before joining Northern Premier League club FC Halifax Town in 2010. Scoring 25 goals in his debut season, he won the club's \"Players' Player of the Year\" award and then moved to Conference Premier club Fleetwood Town in August 2011 for an undisclosed fee. He scored 31 league goals in his first season at his new team, winning the team's \"Player of the Year\" award as they won the division.\nVardy signed for Leicester City in the Championship in May 2012 for a non-League record transfer fee of \u00a31 million and helped the team win the Championship in 2014. In the 2015\u201316 Premier League season, he scored in eleven consecutive Premier League matches, breaking Ruud van Nistelrooy's record, and was voted the Premier League Player of the Season and FWA Footballer of the Year as outsiders Leicester won the title. He won the Premier League Golden Boot for the 2019\u201320 season, becoming the oldest player to win the award. By playing in the 2021 FA Cup Final, he became the first ever player to play in every round of the competition, from the preliminary stages to the final. Vardy made his international debut in June 2015 and was selected for UEFA Euro 2016 and the 2018 FIFA World Cup.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "January 11", "response": ["*  1987   \u2013 Jamie Vardy, English footballer"]}, {"page": "1987", "response": ["** Jamie Vardy, English footballer"]}, {"page": "Leicester City F.C.", "response": ["On 30 June 2015, Pearson was sacked, with the club stating, \"The working relationship between Nigel and the Board is no longer viable.\" The sacking was linked to a number of public relations issues involving Pearson throughout the season, with the final straw involving his son James' role in a \"racist sex tape\" made by three Leicester reserve players in Thailand during a post-season goodwill tour. Leicester reacted by appointing former Chelsea manager Claudio Ranieri as their new manager for the new 2015\u201316 Premier League season. Despite an initially sceptical reaction to Ranieri's appointment, the club made an exceptional start to the season.

After missing a last-minute penalty that would have won the game for United, Van Nistelrooy was attacked by Martin Keown, prompting a melee involving several players from both sides; five Arsenal players including Keown received various bans and fines, while the club itself received a record fine of \u00a3175,000. Earlier in the game, he had been fouled by Patrick Vieira, who was sent off for a second bookable offence. Vieira and his manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger both accused Van Nistelrooy of cheating and stamping on Vieira, prompting a vociferous defence by Alex Ferguson."]}]}}
