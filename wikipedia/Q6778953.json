Subsequently, Daniel helped to edit portions of T. H. Lacy's Acting Edition of Plays and Davison's Actable Drama, in continuation of Cumberland's Plays. He was working at the latter series as late as 1862. He saw the talent of Marie Wilton in 1862, in her performance of Thomas Morton's Great Russian Bear. In 1838 he had commented in similar terms on Mary Anne Stirling, when editing Mrs. Cornwell's Venus in Arms for Cumberland. His remarks on Mary Russell Mitford's Rienzi in Cumberland's series were republished separately in 1828."]}, {"page": "Mary Ann Stirling", "response": ["#REDIRECT Mary Anne Stirling"]}, {"page": "Fanny Stirling", "response": ["#REDIRECT Mary Anne Stirling"]}]}}
