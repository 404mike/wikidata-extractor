A member of the Gordon family, he ran Gordon's Gin from the 1850s.\nThe grandson of the Alexander Gordon, the founder of Gordon's Gin, he was born at Finsbury in December 1814. He made his debut in first-class cricket for the Gentlemen of England against the Gentlemen of Kent at Lord's in 1844, with Gordon playing in the return fixture at Canterbury. He played in the same fixture in 1845. By 1850, Gordon was in charge of Gordon's Gin and oversaw its exportation around the British Empire following the lifting of excise tax on exported gin by Parliament. He resumed playing first-class cricket in 1851, when he played for a Marylebone Cricket Club and Metropolitan Clubs team and Middlesex. Gordon played first-class cricket frequently until 1862, having made 27 appearances, sixteen of which came for the Marylebone Cricket Club. He scored a total of 493 runs in his 27 matches at an average of 12.02, with a high score of 33 not out.Although Gordon's Gin became an extremely successful brand, Gordon was prone to removing money from the company to invest in other ventures and inventions, which were always unsuccessful and led to the business, leaving his sons and daughters to find other means of income. Upon his death at Bedford in July 1897, the family association with the business ended. His grandson was Sir Douglas Gordon, a senior police officer in Bengal Province in British India.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Finsbury", "response": ["* Charles Gordon, cricketer and grandson of the founder of Gordon's Gin"]}, {"page": "Charles Gordon", "response": ["Charles Gordon may refer to:", "* Charles Gordon, 1st Earl of Aboyne (1638\u20131681)", "* Charles Gordon, 2nd Earl of Aboyne (1670\u20131702)", "* Charles Gordon, 4th Earl of Aboyne (1726\u20131794)", "* Charles Gordon (Royal Navy officer) (c. 1780\u20131860)", "* Charles Gordon, 10th Marquess of Huntly (1792\u20131863), Scottish peer and politician", "* Charles Gordon, 11th Marquess of Huntly (1847\u20131937), Scottish Liberal politician", "* Charles Gordon (parliamentary clerk) (1918\u20132009), English parliamentary clerk", "* Charles Gordon (cricketer, born 1849) (1849\u20131930), English cricketer", "* Charles Gordon (cricketer, born 1814) (1814\u20131899), English cricketer and gin distiller", "* Charles Gordon (Canadian football) (born 1968), Canadian football player", "* Charles Gordon (American football) (born 1984), American cornerback", "* Charles Gordon (trade unionist) (died 1929), British trade union leader", "* Charles Gordon (lawyer) (1905\u20131999), American immigration attorney", "* Charles Gordon (artist) (1909\u20131978), watercolor artist", "* Charles Gordon (journalist) (born 1940), Canadian writer and journalist", "* Charles Gordon (producer) (1947\u20132020), film producer of October Sky"]}, {"page": "Gordon's Gin", "response": ["In 1898 Gordon & Co. amalgamated with Charles Tanqueray & Co. to form Tanqueray Gordon & Co.
