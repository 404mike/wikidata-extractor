Beaver was born in Clapham, London, and died, aged 63, in Battersea, London. He studied at the Metropolitan Academy of Music, Forest Gate and then at the Royal Academy of Music. After graduating he worked for the BBC. In the early 1930s he played with the Michael Dor\u00e9 Trio and wrote some concert pieces, including the three movement Sonatina for piano. He also contributed music and arrangements for various BBC radio drama and music features throughout the 1930s and 1940s.\nAs (like Charles Williams) a member of the Gaumont\u2013British Pictures composing team from the 1930s he was a prolific composer of film scores - around 40 scores between 1932 and 1947 - though many of his contributions were not credited. He wrote music for Alfred Hitchcock's The 39 Steps, and composed the pseudo piano concerto Portrait of Isla from the score for the 1940 Edgar Wallace film The Case of the Frightened Lady. This is perhaps the first example of a Romantic style \"Denham Concerto\" composed especially for a film, a year before Richard Addinsell's much more famous Warsaw Concerto appeared in the film Dangerous Moonlight (1941).\nLater in life Beaver was a regular contributor to the recorded music libraries, through which his march Cavalcade of Youth (1950) became widely known when it was used as signature tune for the BBC radio series The Barlowes of Beddington. Another example of his library music is Holiday Funfair (1954), performed by Dolf van der Linden And His Orchestra. He composed Sovereign Heritage for the National Brass Band Championships of 1954.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
