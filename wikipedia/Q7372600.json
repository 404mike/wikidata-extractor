He was born at Marsden, West Riding of Yorkshire.A product of Golcar Cricket Club, where he lived most of his early life, he was professional with Lightcliffe from 1948\u201353 and 1955. A specialist wicket-keeper, he took 948 catches and completed 178 stumpings in a first-class career of 468 games between 1951 and 1970. He took another 28 catches and made two stumpings in his List A one-day matches.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Fred Trueman", "response": ["Back in England after the 1953\u201354 tour, Trueman in 1954 was able to play a full season for the first time since 1951. Jim Kilburn wrote that, at the age of 23, Trueman \"had acquired a man's physique for fast bowling that questioned the courage as well as the technique of opposing batsmen\".Kilburn, p. 141. He played in 33 matches and, for the first time, exceeded 100 wickets in a season. His tally was 134 at 15.55 with a best return of eight for 28. Yorkshire probably should have won the County Championship in 1954 having won six of their first seven matches but were badly hit by wet weather in August and finished runners-up behind Surrey.Webber, p. 88. Trueman and the medium-paced Appleyard formed an effective combination, backed up by Wardle's spin, and Yorkshire had a strong bowling side. The rest of the team mostly comprised Hutton, Lowson, Yardley, Lester, Watson, Vic Wilson, Close, Illingworth and wicket-keeper Roy Booth."]}, {"page": "Worcestershire County Cricket Club", "response": [":1956: Roy Booth"]}, {"page": "List of first-class cricket records", "response": ["| 1,126 (948 c, 178 st) || Roy Booth (Yorkshire and Worcestershire) ||468|| from 1951 to 1970"]}, {"page": "Bob Carter (cricketer, born 1937)", "response": ["Robert George Mallaby Carter (born 11 July 1937), known as Bob, is a former English cricketer who played first-class and List A cricket for Worcestershire. He was capped by the county in 1965, and was awarded a benefit season in 1973, which raised about \u00a37,000. All but two of his 523 first-class wickets came for Worcestershire; the others were obtained for Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in the very last game of his career. Carter\u2019s batting was generally extremely poor, as evidenced by his career batting average of under five in both forms of the game, although he did play one significant \u2013 if ultimately fruitless \u2013 innings. In the 1963 Gillette Cup final against Sussex at Lord's, he came to the wicket with Worcestershire 133/9, needing 35 runs to win. In fading light, he and wicket-keeper Roy Booth added 21 before Carter was run out to end the match. Carter also played in a critical close finish the following season against Nottinghamshire, where he and Flavell managed to get home by a single wicket and virtually seal the county\u2019s first Championship title.Preston, Norman (editor); Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, One Hundred and Second Edition (1965); p. 535"]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1946\u20131977)", "response": ["* Roy Booth (1959) : R.
