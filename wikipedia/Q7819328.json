Crawshaw was a centre-half whose career lasted from 1894 to 1909 during which time he played a total of 492 games in all competitions, scoring 27 goals. Crawshaw has gone down in the annals of Sheffield Wednesday as one of the key figures in the early history of the club. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries he appeared in The Wednesday side which lifted the FA Cup on two occasions and won the Football League First Division title twice. He is the only Sheffield Wednesday player to win two FA Cup winners medals with the club. He appeared for the England national football team on ten occasions.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Arthur Wharton", "response": ["In 1888 the Sheffield Football Association agreed to give a testimonial to Sheffield Wednesday's Billy Mosforth, versus Preston North End. The meeting of both clubs in the FA Cup meant that the match was postponed until February, by which point the Olive Grove was snow covered and the match was switched to Bramall Lane. Arthur volunteered for the 'Sheffield Wednesday and District' team but despite both clubs being locked into a draw in the first half Preston ran away with the match, winning 8\u20131. It was reported that Wednesday's heavy loss was \"in great measure owing to the wretched performance of Wharton, who utterly failed to uphold his high reputation as a goalkeeper\" and that he \"could not have stopped the ball had it been half as big as a balloon\". It was reported that at times the Wednesday fans applauded every kick Arthur took and one fan angrily asked the Preston team where they had \"brought him from\" as it was well known that Arthur was a former Preston player. There were even fears that Arthur would be the victim of violence as he left the field. Arthur did have a connection to Sheffield Wednesday, through his trainer in Sheffield 'Billy' South, who amongst other noted Sheffield sporting icons of the day also trained Wednesday's Tommy Crawshaw."]}, {"page": "List of people from Sheffield", "response": ["*Tommy Crawshaw, footballer for England and Sheffield Wednesday"]}, {"page": "1872 in association football", "response": ["* 27 December \u2013 Tommy Crawshaw (d. 1960), England international centre-half in ten matches (1895\u20131904)."]}, {"page": "List of Sheffield Wednesday F.C. records and statistics", "response": ["| Tommy Crawshaw"]}, {"page": "1896 FA Cup Final", "response": ["|MF || || Tommy Crawshaw"]}, {"page": "1907 FA Cup Final", "response": ["| ||  || Tommy Crawshaw"]}, {"page": "1903\u201304 British Home Championship", "response": ["|align=left|Tommy Crawshaw"]}, {"page": "1900\u201301 British Home Championship", "response": ["|align=left|Tommy Crawshaw"]}, {"page": "1894\u201395 British Home Championship", "response": ["|align=left|Tommy Crawshaw"]}, {"page": "Harry Ruddlesdin", "response": ["Back in the First Division, Ruddlesdin formed a settled half-back line alongside Tommy Crawshaw and Bob Ferrier, who between them hardly missed a match over the next four seasons, as Wednesday took the Football League championship in 1903 and again the following season.

In the second half, the visitors had more of the play: their \"defence was excellent, and they fully held their own\", but they could not score, Wednesday's Tommy Crawshaw regularly \"checking determined rushes by the visitors' front rank\" to disrupt their attacking play.
