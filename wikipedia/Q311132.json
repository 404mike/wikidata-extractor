He suggests,  by making comparisons with the other primates, that evolution has brought about in the human female a modification of the shape of the breasts to make them evoke the buttocks. According to this hypothesis, the similarity between the shape of the breasts and the buttocks could be explained by the special needs, in early human species, generated by their adoption of bipedalism  and face-to-face coitus. This led to the transposition of  specific posterior excitatory signals, in the buttocks, to be transferred into a similar signal, the breasts. The breasts would thus be \u201cbuttocks in front\u201d, an excitatory adaptive signal specific to the upright bipedal human species.

Morris suggested that the relative difficulty in achieving female orgasm, in comparison to the male's, might be favorable in Darwinian evolution by leading the female to select mates who bear qualities like patience, care, imagination, and intelligence, as opposed to qualities like size and aggression, which pertain to mate selection in other primates. Such advantageous qualities thereby become accentuated within the species, driven by the differences between male and female orgasm. If males were motivated by, and taken to the point of, orgasm in the same way as females, those advantageous qualities would not be needed, since self-interest would be enough.", "Desmond Morris proposed that orgasm might facilitate conception by exhausting the female and keeping her horizontal, thus preventing the sperm from leaking out. This possibility, sometimes called the \"Poleaxe Hypothesis\" or the \"Knockout Hypothesis\",  is now considered unlikely. A 1994 Learning Channel documentary on sex had fiber optic cameras inside the vagina of a woman while she had sexual intercourse. During her orgasm, her pelvic muscles contracted and her cervix repeatedly dipped into a pool of semen in the vaginal fornix, which might ensure that sperm would proceed by the external orifice of the uterus, making conception more likely."]}, {"page": "Biological anthropology", "response": ["* Desmond Morris"]}, {"page": "Red Dwarf", "response": ["Alan Rickman and Alfred Molina auditioned for roles in the series, with Molina being cast as Rimmer.

Craig Charles, a Liverpudlian \"punk poet\", was given the role of Dave Lister. He was approached by the production team for his opinion about the \"Cat\" character, as they were concerned it may be considered by people as racist.Howarth & Lyons (1993) p. 5. Charles described \"Cat\" as 'pretty cool' and after reading the script he decided he wanted to audition for the part of Dave Lister.Howarth & Lyons (1993) p. 6.

A professional dancer and singer, Danny John-Jules, arriving half an hour late for his appointment, stood out as the Cat immediately. This was partly due to his \"cool\" exterior, dedicated research (reading Desmond Morris's book Catwatching), and his showing up in character, wearing his father's 1950s-style zoot suit."]}, {"page": "Secondary sex characteristic", "response": ["* Upper arms approximately 2\u00a0cm longer, on average, for a given height.Manwatching: A Field Guide to Human Behaviour, 1977, Desmond Morris"]}, {"page": "Zebra", "response": ["* The thermoregulatory hypothesis suggests that stripes help to control a zebra's body temperature. In 1971, biologist H. A. Baldwin noted that black stripes absorbed heat while the white ones reflected it. In 1990, zoologist Desmond Morris proposed that the stripes set up convection currents to cool the animal. A study from 2015 determined that environmental temperature is a strong predictor for zebra striping patterns. Another study from 2019 also concluded that the stripes played a role in regulating heat. Air currents move faster over the heat-absorbing black hairs than the white ones. At the junction of the stripes, the air swirls and cools down the animal. In addition, zebras appear to be able to raise the hair of the black stripes while keeping white hair flat. During the hottest times of the day, the raised hair may help transfer heat from the skin to the hair surface, while during the cooler early morning, the raised black hair can trap air to prevent heat loss. Others have found no evidence that zebras have cooler bodies than other ungulates whose habitat they share, or that striping correlates with temperature. A 2018 experimental study which dressed water-filled metal barrels in horse, zebra and cattle hides found that zebra stripes have no effect on thermoregulation."]}, {"page": "1928", "response": ["** Desmond Morris, English anthropologist and writer"]}, {"page": "1967", "response": ["** The Naked Ape, by Desmond Morris, is published."]}, {"page": "Nature versus nurture", "response": ["In African Genesis (1961) and The Territorial Imperative (1966), Robert Ardrey argues for innate attributes of human nature, especially concerning territoriality.

In 1967, the hypothesis was mentioned in The Naked Ape, a popular book by the zoologist Desmond Morris, who reduced Hardy's phrase \"more aquatic ape-like ancestors\" to the bare \"aquatic ape\", commenting that \"despite its most appealing indirect evidence, the aquatic theory lacks solid support\".", "Alister Hardy was astonished and mortified in 1960 when the national Sunday papers carried banner headlines \"Oxford professor says man a sea ape\", causing problems with his Oxford colleagues.
