He played a different role, Prof, Aldus Crick, in the show's 2013 revival.He appeared as Franz Hoss in Kessler (1981).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Tomorrow People", "response": ["Price saw the lead casting as very important, as he wanted talented and attractive actors who would appeal to the young audience, but also be personable and easy to work with during the long hours envisaged in studio or out on location. Nicholas Young was cast as the group's leader, John, while Peter Vaughan Clarke was offered the role of Stephen after Price saw him in a Manchester rendition of Peter Pan with Lulu. Ruth Boswell wanted Lynne Frederick (later the last wife of Peter Sellers) for Carol, the female lead, but following a meeting with her, Paul Bernard felt she was a bit too upper-class and precious for what he had in mind, as he saw the character as being similar to Doctor Who's Jo Grant. They finally settled on Sammie Winmill who was relatively well-known for playing Nurse Crumpton on the popular Doctor at Large situation comedy (also a Thames production). The role of Kenny, the youngest TP, was given to Stephen Salmon after he had been discovered in a drama workshop while theatre actor Philip Gilbert was selected to provide the paternal tones of biotronic computer TIM. Making up the team were two Sap friends, a couple of bikers called Ginge (Michael Standing) and Lefty (Derek Crewe) who encounter the Tomorrow People when acting as henchmen for the villainous shape-shifter Jedikiah in the opening adventure. Stephen would be very much the show's hero and focus for the audience while John was something of an authoritarian figure who took his responsibilities for the species' future and welfare very seriously. Young was the only TP to be in every single episode and the actor was able to have some say in the production of later seasons as he was considered as an unofficial producer. Kenny was given very little to do and was often left behind in the Lab (due to being the youngest) while the others went off to have the actual adventures. Filming commenced in March 1973 with location work in Muswell Hill. Production of this first story, \"The Slaves of Jedikiah\" was much troubled, as the crew found they were unfamiliar with the technical demands of a science fiction drama. The first day in studio was disastrous, with virtually no usable material getting made and there was some tension between the cast and Paul Bernard, who was very authoritarian with them. Also, Nicholas Young banged himself hard into a wall while working on the darkened entrance to the Lab, which was being filmed inside the real disused tube station at Wood Lane (closed in the 1940s). Fortunately, he was not badly injured and able to carry on later that day after a recovery break.", "1978 saw changes being made, starting with Elizabeth's absence through most of Series 6 due to Elizabeth Adare's pregnancy (on screen Elizabeth is working on diplomatic missions for the Galactic Federation and appears only briefly on a screen so as to hide the actress's condition). In her place came Hsui Tai, played by Japanese actress Misako Koba, whose poor grasp of English made her hard to understand, and Nicholas Young later recalled that he and other actors found this difficult during production. Koba had no previous acting experience and had been suggested for the role by her actor husband. A new Lab set was introduced with a smaller but now mobile TIM and the jaunting belts were replaced by the rather cheap looking jaunting bands (worn on the wrists). These changes were forced on the production team following a fire at the Thames storerooms. The new Lab acted as both base and home for the Tomorrow People as they were now seen to be sleeping in their own cabins there. It was noticeably smaller than the previous set, which freed up more space in the studio for the designers to utilise on other sets. The 6 episodes were produced sporadically through 1977 (a combination of Price writing scripts as and when it fitted with his other production commitments and a number of strikes at ITV over the year) and finally launched in the Spring of 78. Such was Holoway's popularity that he was featured on the cover of TV Times to promote the start of the season.", "* John (Nicholas Young) \u2013 Aged 17, John is the leader of the Tomorrow People. He is an inventor and scientist. He built The Lab and the biological computer, TIM, with some help from the Galactic Council. John was the first Tomorrow Person to \"break out\" and had no guidance through the process.", "In 2001, Big Finish Productions launched a series of new audio plays based on the original series, produced by Nigel Fairs. Nicholas Young and Philip Gilbert reprised their roles as John and TIM, with Helen Goldwyn and James Daniel Wilson appearing as Elena and Paul, the new Tomorrow People. Some releases also feature other original cast members, such as Peter Vaughan-Clarke, Elizabeth Adare and Mike Holoway (notably Trigonometry). Trevor Littledale took over the role of TIM in the audio series from The Warlock's Dance onwards after Philip Gilbert's death in 2004.", "In October 2005, Fantom Films and First Time Films released the 1997 documentary about the series entitled Beyond Tomorrow.
