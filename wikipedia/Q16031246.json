As a result, she often experienced resistance from strict theatre censorship which dogged the rest of her career.Pope, p. 138 The writer and feminist Laura Ormiston Chant, who was a member of the Social Purity Alliance, disliked the bawdiness of music hall performances, and thought that the venues were attractive to prostitutes. Her campaign persuaded the London County Council to erect large screens around the promenade at the Empire Theatre in Leicester Square, as part of the licensing conditions.Farson, p. 64\"Sources for the history of London Theatres and Music Halls at London Metropolitan Archives\" , London Metropolitan Archives, Information Leaflet Number 47, pp. 6\u20137, accessed 23 December 2017 The screens were unpopular and protesters, among them the young Winston Churchill, later pulled them down.Gillies, p. 315Gillies, p. 89 That November at the Tivoli theatre, Lloyd performed \"Johnny Jones\", a ditty about a girl who is taught the facts of life by her best male friend.Gillies, p. 101 The song, although not lyrically obscene, was considered to be offensive largely because of the manner in which Lloyd sang it, adding winks and gestures, and creating a conspiratorial relationship with her audience. Social reformers cited \"Johnny Jones\" as being offensive, but less so compared to other songs of the day.Gillies, p. 102 Upon the expiry of a music hall's entertainments licence, the Licensing Committee tried to use the lyrical content of music hall songs as evidence against a renewal. As a result, Lloyd was summoned to perform some of her songs in front of a council committee.Pope, p. 140 She sang \"Oh! Mr Porter\" (composed for her by George Le Brunn); \"A Little of What You Fancy\"; and, according to some writers, \"She Sits Among the Cabbages and Peas\",Nuttall, Carmichael, p. 34 which she retitled \"I Sits Amongst the Cabbages and Leeks\" after some protest.\"The BBC should see the funny side of risqu\u00e9 humour\", The Telegraph (online edition), accessed 8 April 2013 The numbers were sung in such a way that the committee had no reason to find anything amiss. Feeling disgruntled at the council's interference, she then rendered Alfred Tennyson's drawing-room ballad \"Come into the Garden, Maud\" with leers and nudges to illustrate each innuendo. The committee were left stunned at the performance,Pope, p. 141 but Lloyd argued afterwards that the rudeness was \"all in the mind\"."]}, {"page": "Gus Elen", "response": ["The lyrics to \"If It Wasn't for the 'Ouses In Between\" were written by Edgar Bateman, who later wrote two more of Elen's songs: \"She's Too Good to Live Is Mrs. Carter\" and \"The Postman's 'Oliday.\" The music to the songs was written by George Le Brunn, who wrote a vast number of music-hall songs and accompaniments for Marie Lloyd and Dan Leno, and also for Gus Elen's \"It's a Great Big Shame\".
