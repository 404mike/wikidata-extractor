Reprinted in  Myoglobin was demonstrated in the urine of victims by spectroscopy, and it was noted that the kidneys of victims resembled those of patients who had hemoglobinuria (hemoglobin rather than myoglobin being the cause of the kidney damage). In 1944 Bywaters demonstrated experimentally that the kidney failure was mainly caused by myoglobin. Already during the war, teams of doctors traveled to bombed areas to provide medical support, chiefly with intravenous fluids, as dialysis was not yet available. The prognosis of acute kidney failure improved markedly when dialysis was added to supportive treatment, which first happened during the 1950\u20131953 Korean War."]}, {"page": "List of eponymous diseases", "response": ["* Bywaters syndrome \u2013 Eric Bywaters"]}, {"page": "Crush syndrome", "response": ["The syndrome was later described by British physician Eric Bywaters in patients during the 1941 London Blitz.

Kolff briefly worked at Hammersmith to set up an artificial kidney machine with the rheumatologist Eric Bywaters and the nephrologist A. Mark 'Jo' Joekes.
