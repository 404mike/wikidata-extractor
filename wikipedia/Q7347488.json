Gow later rose to Minister of State for Housing in Thatcher's cabinet before he was murdered by the IRA in 1990, following his opposition to the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  Thatcher recognised that Garel-Jones did not support her politics but appointed him a whip in 1982; he held the position for eight years and became highly respected by both sides of the House.  Despite their dissent some of the Gang were later appointed to government positions by Thatcher.  Dorrell became an assistant whip in 1987, a full whip the following year and a junior health minister in 1990.  Needham was appointed a junior Northern Ireland minister in 1985, holding the position beyond the end of Thatcher's premiership.  Patten was appointed a junior Northern Ireland minister in 1983 and held a string of ministerial positions, reaching the cabinet in 1989 with appointment as Secretary of State for the Environment.  In 1990, Thatcher arranged for Robert McCrindle to receive a knighthood for his service to the Conservative Party, even though he continued to be outspoken against some of her economic and social policies."]}]}}
