He was an Anglo-Irish aristocrat, the eldest son of George Bingham, 6th Earl of Lucan by his wife Kaitlin Dawson. Lucan was an evacuee during the Second World War but returned to attend Eton College, and served with the Coldstream Guards in West Germany from 1953 to 1955. Having developed a taste for gambling, he became skilled at backgammon and bridge, and was an early member of the Clermont Club. Lucan's losses often exceeded his winnings, yet he left his job at a London-based merchant bank and became a professional gambler. He was known as Lord Bingham from April 1949 until January 1964, during his father's lifetime.\nLucan was considered for the role of James Bond in the cinematic adaptations of Ian Fleming's novels. He was known for his expensive tastes; he raced power boats and drove an Aston Martin. In 1963, Lucan married Veronica Duncan, with whom he had three children. The couple moved home to 46 Lower Belgrave Street in Belgravia in 1967, paying \u00a317,500 for the house. After the marriage collapsed in late 1972, he moved out to a nearby property. A bitter custody battle ensued, which Lucan eventually lost.   Apparently obsessed with regaining custody of the children, Lucan began to spy on his wife and record their telephone conversations. This fixation, combined with mounting legal and gambling losses, had a dramatic effect on Lucan's life and personal finances.\nOn the evening of 7 November 1974 the nanny of Lucan's children was bludgeoned to death in the kitchen of the Lucan family home. Lady Lucan was also attacked after going to investigate Rivett's whereabouts.  She identified Lord Lucan as her assailant. Lucan had, by then, driven to visit a friend in Uckfield, East Sussex. Lucan then telephoned his mother,   asking her to collect his children, saying there had been an incident at the family home; he also penned a letter.  His car was later found abandoned in Newhaven, its interior stained with blood and its boot containing a piece of bandaged lead pipe similar to one found at the crime scene. By the time the police issued a warrant for his arrest a few days later, Lucan had vanished. At the inquest into Ms Rivett's death, held in June 1975, the jury returned a verdict naming Lucan as her killer.There has been continuing interest in Lucan's fate, with hundreds of alleged sightings being reported in various countries around the world, none of which has been substantiated. Despite a police investigation and widespread press coverage, Lucan has never been found. He was presumed dead in chambers on 11 December 1992, and was declared legally dead in October 1999. Finally, in 2016, a death certificate was issued, allowing the Barony of Bingham to be inherited by his son George.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Earl", "response": ["Notable later Irish earls include Jacobite leader Patrick Sarsfield, 1st Earl of Lucan; Postmaster General Richard Trench, 2nd Earl of Clancarty; Prime Minister William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne (later made a marquess) and the (alleged) murderer John Bingham, 7th Earl of Lucan."]}, {"page": "Richard John Bingham", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Bingham, 7th Earl of Lucan"]}, {"page": "Earl of Lucan", "response": ["*Richard John Bingham, 7th Earl of Lucan (born 1934, missing since 1974, presumed dead; death certificate issued 2016)"]}, {"page": "Lord Lucan", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Bingham, 7th Earl of Lucan"]}, {"page": "Belgravia", "response": ["Walter Bagehot, a writer, banker and economist, lived at No. 12 during the 1860s.
