Snowdon suggests that Wilkinson excludes certain countries from his data without justification, such as South Korea and the Czech Republic.  The book includes homicide, but excludes suicide.  Prison population is included, but not the crime rate or crime survey data.  Government foreign aid is included, but (private) charitable giving is not. Datasets are selected or rejected to support the thesis of the authors.  Likely cultural confounding factors are not taken into account.  Regression lines are drawn which are dependent on a very small number of outlying countries, but this is not explained in the text.  Correlation is confused with causation throughout.  It also argues that Wilkinson and Pickett falsely claim the existence of a scientific consensus when much of the literature disagrees with their findings.   Snowdon's book also asserts that some of Wilkinson's previous publications have been criticized on the basis that \"the strength of the association...seems quite sensitive to which countries are included\".  Finally, in a reductio ad absurdum, the methods of TSL are used to show that the suicide rate is linked to the recycling rate.", "* A debate of The Spirit Level - Videotaped debate featuring Christopher Snowdon and Peter Saunders as well as the authors of the book."]}, {"page": "Velvet Glove, Iron Fist: A History of Anti-Smoking", "response": ["#REDIRECT Christopher Snowdon"]}, {"page": "Christopher John Snowdon", "response": ["#Redirect Christopher Snowdon"]}, {"page": "Snowdon, Christopher", "response": ["#redirectChristopher Snowdon"]}]}}
