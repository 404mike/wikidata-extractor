In hymns of Book\u00a010 of Rigveda, she is already declared to be the \"possessor of knowledge\". Her importance grows in Vedas composed after Rigveda and in Brahmanas, and the word evolves in its meaning from \"waters that purify\", to \"that which purifies\", to \"vach (speech) that purifies\", to \"knowledge that purifies\", and ultimately into a spiritual concept of a goddess that embodies knowledge, arts, music, melody, muse, language, rhetoric, eloquence, creative work and anything whose flow purifies the essence and self of a person. In Upanishads and Dharma Sastras, Saraswati is invoked to remind the reader to meditate on virtue, virtuous emoluments, the meaning and the very essence of one's activity, one's action."]}, {"page": "Sayana", "response": ["According to Dalal, \"his work influenced all later scholars, including many European commentators and translators.\" Sayana's commentary preserved traditional Indian understandings and explanations of the Rigveda, though it also contains mistakes and contradictions. While some 19th century Indologists were quite dismissive of Sayana's commentary, others were more appreciative. His commentary was used as a reference-guide by Ralph T. H. Griffith (1826-1906), John Muir (1810-1882), Horace Hayman Wilson (1786-1860) and other 19th century European Indologists. According to Wilson, Sayana's interpretation was sometimes questionable, but had \"a knowledge of his text far beyond the pretension of any European scholar,\" reflecting the possession \"of all the interpretations which had been perpetuated by traditional teaching from the earliest times.\" Macdonnell (1854-1930) was critical of Sayana's commentary, noting that many difficult words weren't properly understood by Yasana. While Rudolf Roth (1821-1895) aimed at reading the Vedas as \"lyrics\" without the \"theological\" background of the interpretations of Yaska and Sayana, Max M\u00fcller (1823-1900) published a translation of the Rigvedic Samhitas together with Sayana's commentary.

According to Subodh Kapoor, unlike many Vedic deities who personify natural phenomena, Indrani does not have a myth of nature that explains her existence and may have originated as Indra's wife. Indologist John Muir states that in the Rigveda, she is invoked multiple times and is mentioned with other goddesses in the first three of these passages. Another hymn considers her to be the most fortunate female, as her husband Indra cannot die from old age. David Kinsley states that many of the goddesses in the early texts are named after their husbands and have no independent character of their own.
