As a holder of a royal warrant, he used the title \"Cartographer to the King\"; for this reason he was sometimes known by the epithet \"the Prince of Cartography\".Bartholomew's longest lasting legacy is arguably naming the continent of Antarctica, which until his use of the term in 1890 had been largely ignored due to its lack of resources and harsh climate.", "link_mentions": {}}}
