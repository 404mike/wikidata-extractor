'The Choice' is the poem for which Pomfret is now probably most remembered, especially as it was chosen by Roger Lonsdale as the first poem in The New Oxford Book of Eighteenth Century Verse.*  It is a poem which celebrates an ideal life of genteel moderation in the country. Although Pomfret was married, 'The Choice' suggests the ideal life to be that of a bachelor, who can spend his days among the classics in his library and drinking (moderately) with two 'brave, gen'rous and witty' friends. However, he would also like there to be a 'witty nymph' living nearby whose 'conversation' would give his life a keen edge. Unfortunately for Pomfret this last sentiment led indirectly to his death at the young age of 35. He had travelled to London to seek preferment from Dr.Henry Compton, Bishop of London, but the bishop had been informed that in 'The Choice' Pomfret had advocated the keeping of a mistress. He therefore kept Pomfret waiting in London. It was here that Pomfret caught the smallpox which killed him. It was once believed by some critics that he was a follower of Albaudism  but this appears to have been the result of a misinterpretation of his poetry."]}, {"page": "Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard", "response": ["There are two possible ways the poem was composed. The first, Mason's concept, argues that the Eton copy was the original for the Elegy poem and was complete in itself. Later critics claimed that the original was more complete than the later version; Roger Lonsdale argued that the early version had a balance that set up the debate, and was clearer than the later version. Lonsdale also argued that the early poem fits classical models, including Virgil's Georgics and Horace's Epodes. According to Mason the early version of the poem was finished in August 1742, but there is little evidence to give such a definite date. He argued that the poem was in response to West's death, but there is little to indicate that Mason would have such information."]}, {"page": "Oxford Poetry", "response": ["* 1958:.
