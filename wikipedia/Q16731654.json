She released her first album, Beyond (and Below), in 2012 under the record label Discovery Records, which received critical acclaim in Gramophone  Awards  and is now being distributed worldwide. The record comprises the artist's own piano works, an unusual artistic gesture in the contemporary classical world where most virtuoso performers tend to perform other composers' music. She released an album with violinist Giovanni Guzzo in 2013 on the label Champs Hill Records.\nIn October 2018, The Eleventh Hour was released on the label 1631 Recordings and published by Faber in London. She was joined on the album by the London Contemporary Orchestra as well as Oliver Coates on cello. The Guardian described the album as \"a soulful elegy for a Britain which has lost its bearings.\" \"Nocturne with Oliver Coates\" was featured in a Burberry campaign and For Now on The Fix for ABC Studios in the U.S.\nIn 2020, Lovett was commissioned to write Infinity, a new work for British vocal ensemble Voces8. It was released on Decca Classics in August 2021.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of classical pianists", "response": ["* Anne Lovett"]}, {"page": "List of women classical pianists", "response": ["*Anne Lovett (fl. 2000s), pianist and recording artist based in London"]}]}}
