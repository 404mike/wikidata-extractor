Abbadie visited Holland to see his La V\u00e9rit\u00e9 through the press, and stayed more than three years in Amsterdam, 1720\u201323, during the preparation of Le Triomphe and other works. He returned to Ireland in 1723. Abbadie's income as dean of Killaloe was so small that he could not afford a literary amanuensis; and Hugh Boulter, archbishop of Armagh, having appealed in vain to Lord Carteret, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, on Abbadie's behalf, gave him a letter of introduction to Dr. Edmund Gibson, bishop of London, and Abbadie left Ireland.

He was induced to start a private academy in Dublin, where, assisted by Thomas Drennan, he taught for 10 years. In Dublin his literary attainments gained him the friendship of many prominent inhabitants. Among these was The Rt. Hon. and Most Rev. Dr William King, the Church of Ireland Lord Archbishop of Dublin, who refused to prosecute Hutcheson in the Archbishop's Court for keeping a school without the episcopal licence. Hutcheson's relations with the clergy of the established church, especially with Archbishop King and with The Rt. Hon. and Most Rev. Dr Hugh Boulter, Lord Archbishop of Armagh, seem to have been cordial, and his biographer, speaking of \"the inclination of his friends to serve him, the schemes proposed to him for obtaining promotion\", etc., probably refers to some offers of preferment, on condition of his accepting episcopal ordination."]}, {"page": "1718 in literature", "response": ["*The Freethinker (newspaper) is founded by Ambrose Philips and Hugh Boulter."]}, {"page": "Ambrose Philips", "response": ["In 1718, Philips started a Whig paper, The Free-Thinker, in conjunction with Hugh Boulter, then vicar of St Olave's, Southwark.

Between 1727 and 1749, he sat in the Irish House of Commons for Armagh Borough, was secretary to the lord chancellor in 1726, and in 1733 became a judge of the prerogative court.

He was generally regarded as a man of sense and good judgment, and his political influence was considerable: he was always consulted on judicial appointments and at times seems to have had an effective veto over candidates he considered unsuitable. His influence declined after the appointment of Hugh Boulter as Archbishop of Armagh in 1724, as Boulter was also consulted on judicial appointments, and the two could rarely agree on a suitable candidate."]}, {"page": "In commendam", "response": ["In the Church of England the stipends of bishops and other senior ecclesiastics were sometimes augmented by the stipends of sinecure benefices held in commendam.
