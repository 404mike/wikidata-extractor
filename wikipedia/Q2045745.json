He studied physics at King's College, Durham and obtained his PhD in Edinburgh, where he worked at the Royal Observatory on stellar spectra. He was an astronomer, who fully embraced the opportunities provided by the space age and he was one of the pioneers who laid the groundwork for the development of the Great Space Observatories, such as the Hubble Space Telescope.In 1959 Wilson joined the Plasma Spectroscopy Group at Harwell where he was responsible for measuring the temperature in the Zeta experiment, confirming that it had not been hot enough to have produced thermonuclear fusion. As head of the Plasma Spectroscopy Group at Culham, he led a programme of rocket observations of ultraviolet spectra of the sun and stars. By placing telescopes on rockets and satellites it was possible to avoid the absorption of the ultraviolet light by the Earth's atmosphere and gain a great deal of information about the hot plasmas especially in the Sun's chromosphere and corona.\nWilson then became involved in the European Space Research Organization's first astronomy satellite, the TD-1A mission, and led the British collaboration with Belgium in the S2/68 experiment which in 1972 conducted the first all sky survey in the ultraviolet.\nWilson was best known for his role as \"father\" of the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) satellite. This had started life in 1964 as a proposal to ESRO for a Large Astronomical Satellite, which proved too expensive and studies were abandoned in 1967. Wilson, however, convinced the UK authorities to continue the study, and achieved a radical redesign which at the same time had greater capability and was simpler and therefore cheaper. This concept was called the Ultraviolet Astronomical Satellite (UVAS). It was again submitted to ESRO in November 1968 but despite a favourable assessment report was not accepted. Convinced of the soundness of the concept, Wilson offered the design work to NASA and this ultimately led to IUE, an international project between NASA, ESA and the UK.\nIn 1972 he relinquished his post as Director, Science Research Council's Astrophysics Research Unit, Culham to become Perren Professor of Astronomy at University College London. He was the George Darwin Lecturer of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1985. He was knighted in 1989.He was President of Commission 44 of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) (for astronomical observations outside the terrestrial atmosphere) from 1967 to 1970, a Vice-President of the IAU from 1979 to 1985 and a member of the bureau of the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) from 1986 to 1990.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ultraviolet astronomy", "response": ["Pioneers in ultraviolet astronomy include George Robert Carruthers, Robert Wilson, and Charles Stuart Bowyer."]}, {"page": "Robert Wilson", "response": ["Robert Wilson may refer to:", "* Robert Wilson (crime novelist) (born 1957), British crime novelist", "* Robert Wilson (dramatist) (died 1600), English Elizabethan dramatist", "* Robert Wilson (editor) (born 1951), American magazine editor and author", "* Robert Wilson (tenor) (1907\u20131964), Scottish tenor", "* Robert Wilson (American singer) (1957\u20132010), American R&B and funk musician in The Gap Band", "* Robert Wilson (music entrepreneur) (born 1951), British musician and charity founder", "* Juice Wilson (Robert Wilson, 1904\u20131993), American jazz violinist", "* Robert Wilson (born 1980), Bobby V, American R&B singer formerly known as Bobby Valentino", "* Robert Wilson (director) (born 1941), American avant-garde stage director and playwright", "* Sir Robert Wilson (British Army officer, born 1777) (1777\u20131849), British Army general", "* Robert Wilson (British Army officer, born 1911) (1911\u20132002), British Army special operations officer", "* Robert Wilson (Missouri politician) (1803\u20131870), U.S. Senator from Missouri", "* Robert Wilson (Australian politician) (1896\u20131973), New South Wales politician", "* Robert Wilson (Manitoba politician) (born 1934), Manitoba politician", "* Robert Wilson (Texas politician) (1793\u20131856), land speculator and politician in Texas", "* Robert Wilson (physician) (1829\u20131881), wrote about the British mining industry", "* Robert Wilson (astronomer) (1927\u20132002), British astronomer", "* Robert Wilson (running back) (born 1969), American football player", "* Robert Wilson (wide receiver) (1974\u20132020), American football player", "* Robert Wilson (rugby league) (1879\u20131916), rugby league footballer for England and Broughton Ranchers", "* Robert Wilson (rugby union, born 1854) (1854\u20131911), Scottish rugby union player", "* Robert Wilson (rugby union) (1861\u20131944), rugby union player for New Zealand in 1884", "* Robert Wilson (bobsleigh) (born 1954), Canadian Olympic bobsledder", "* Robert Wilson (cricketer, born 1922) (1922\u20131980), first-class cricketer", "*Robert Wilson (cricketer, born 1934)", "* Robert Wilson (Canadian rower) (born 1935), Canadian Olympic rower", "* Robert Wilson (tennis) (born 1935), tennis player in the 1960s", "* Robert Wilson (American rower) (born 1939), American Olympic rower", "* Robert Wilson (cricketer, born 1948), New Zealand cricketer", "* Robert Wilson (footballer, born 1961), English football player for Fulham", "* Robert Wilson (Scottish footballer), Scottish footballer (Partick Thistle}", "* Robert Wilson (architect) (1834\u20131901), Scottish architect", "* Robert Wilson (businessman) (born 1942/1943), British businessman", "* Robert Wilson (engineer) (1803\u20131882), Scottish engineer and inventor", "* Robert Wilson (philosopher) (born 1964), philosophy professor", "* Robert Wilson (priest) (1840\u20131897), Warden of Keble College, Oxford", "* Robert Wilson (ship captain) (1806\u20131888), Great Lakes captain who helped slaves escape", "* Robert Wilson (merchant) (1832\u20131899), New Zealand merchant and company director"]}, {"page": "Epsilon Aurigae", "response": ["Astronomer Su-Shu Huang published a paper in 1965 that outlined the defects of the Kuiper-Struve-Str\u00f6mgren model, and proposed that the companion is a large disk system, edge-on from the perspective of Earth.

In 2005, the system was observed in the ultraviolet by the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE); as the star system was not emitting energy at rates characteristic of objects such as the neutron star binary system Circinus X-1 or black hole binary system Cygnus X-1, the object occupying the center of the disk is not expected to be anything of the sort; in contrast, a new hypothesis has suggested that the central object is actually a B5-type star."]}, {"page": "International Ultraviolet Explorer", "response": ["The orbiting ultraviolet satellite which ultimately became the IUE mission was first proposed in 1964 by British astronomer Robert Wilson.

Wilson's team scaled down their plans and submitted a more modest proposal to ESRO, but this was not selected as the Cosmic Ray satellite was given precedence. Rather than give up on the idea of an orbiting UV telescope, they instead sent their plans to NASA astronomer Leo Goldberg, and in 1973 the plans were approved. The proposed telescope was renamed the International Ultraviolet Explorer.Sir Robert Wilson 1927\u20132002  Blackwell Synergy Obituaries"]}, {"page": "2002 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["*2 September \u2013 Robert Wilson, astrophysicist (born 1927)"]}, {"page": "1927 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["** Robert Wilson, astrophysicist (died 2002)"]}, {"page": "Herschel Medal", "response": ["| || 1986 || Albert BoggessRobert Wilson || Ultraviolet astronomy || "]}, {"page": "List of people with surname Wilson", "response": ["**Charles Robert Wilson (1863\u20131904), English academic and historian of British India", "**James Robert Wilson (1866\u20131941), mayor of Saskatoon and member of the Parliament of Canada", "*** Kenneth Robert Wilson (born 1965), American drummer for band Marilyn Manson, aka Kenny, better known as Ginger Fish", "*Rob and Robert Wilson (disambiguation), multiple people", "***Robert Wilson (dramatist) (died 1600), English Elizabethan dramatist", "***Robert Wilson (Missouri politician) (1803\u20131870), American politician and U.S. Senator from Missouri", "***Robert Wilson (engineer) (1803\u20131882), Scottish engineer; inventor of the first practical screw propeller", "***Robert Wilson (ship captain) (1806\u20131888), helped escaped slaves to freedom", "***Robert Wilson (physician) (1829\u20131881), wrote on the conditions and practices in the British mining industry", "***Robert Wilson (merchant) (1832\u20131899), New Zealand merchant and company director", "***Robert Wilson (architect) (1834\u20131901), Scottish architect", "***Robert Wilson (priest) (1840\u20131897), Warden of Keble College, Oxford", "***Robert Wilson (rugby union) (1861\u20131944), rugby union player who represented New Zealand", "***Robert Wilson (rugby league) (1879\u20131916), rugby league footballer who played in the 1930s", "***Robert Wilson (tenor) (1907\u20131964), Scottish tenor", "***Robert Wilson (astronomer) (1927\u20132002), British astronomer", "***Robert Wilson (Manitoba politician) (born 1934), Canadian politician", "***Robert Wilson (Canadian rower) (born 1935), Canadian Olympic rower", "***Robert Wilson (tennis) (born 1935), tennis player from the 1960s", "***Robert Wilson (director) (born 1941), American avant-garde stage director and playwright", "***Robert Wilson (crime novelist) (born 1957), British crime novelist", "***Robert Wilson (footballer, born 1961), English football player for Fulham", "***Robert Wilson (running back) (born 1969), American football player", "***Robert Wilson (wide receiver) (1974\u20132020), American football player", "*** William Robert Wilson, known as W.
