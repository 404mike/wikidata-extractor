He was Depute Leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP) from 1971 to 1973 and from 1979 to 1981. He served as a Scottish National Party Member of Parliament (MP) for East Aberdeenshire from 1974 to 1979, and held virtually every national office in the SNP, short of party leader.  His political style has been described as \"no-nonsense\" and \"very blunt and forthright\". He was also known for his forceful public speaking, which former SNP leader Alex Salmond described as \"messianic\".\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Scottish National Party", "response": ["|Douglas Henderson (1935\u20132006) (1st Term)", "|Douglas Henderson (1935\u20132006) (2nd Term)"]}, {"page": "1979 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Douglas Henderson"]}, {"page": "Annabelle Ewing", "response": ["She was later selected to contest the Falkirk East seat in the 2007 election on behalf of the SNP as a replacement for the previously selected candidate, the late Douglas Henderson.

A period of internal strife followed, culminating in the proscription of two internal groups, Siol nan Gaidheal and the left-wing 79 Group. However, several 79 Group members would later return to prominence in the party, including Alex Salmond, who would later lead the party. It proved too much for Margo MacDonald though, who was defeated by Douglas Henderson for the position of party deputy leader at the 1979 party conference, and left the SNP, angry at the treatment of the left wing of the party, although she would later return to the party and be elected as an MSP."]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom MPs: H", "response": ["*Douglas Henderson"]}, {"page": "East Aberdeenshire (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Douglas Henderson"]}, {"page": "Patrick Wolrige-Gordon", "response": ["He married Anne Howard, daughter of Peter Howard, in 1962 and became involved through Howard in Frank Buchman's Moral Re-Armament (MRA) movement, which attracted much negative comment.
