Later influences included Larry Graham, Stanley Clarke and Jaco Pastorius.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Only Fools and Horses", "response": ["Only Fools and Horses has separate theme songs for the opening and closing credits, \"Only Fools and Horses\" and \"Hooky Street\", respectively. The original theme tune was produced by Ronnie Hazlehurst and recorded on 6 August 1981 at Lime Grove Studios. Alf Bigden, Paul Westwood, Don Hunt, John Dean, Judd Proctor, Eddie Mordue, and Rex Morris were hired to play the music. The tune was changed after the first series, and the new one was written by John Sullivan (he disliked the tune for the first series, and his new one explained the show's title), and Hazlehurst conducted it. It was recorded at Lime Grove on 11 May 1982, with musicians John Horler, Dave Richmond, Bigden, and Proctor. Sullivan had intended Chas & Dave to sing it because they had enjoyed success with the \"Rockney\" style, a mixture of rock n' roll and traditional Cockney music. Sullivan was persuaded to do it himself by Ray Butt. Despite the creation of a new theme tune, the original one remained in occasional use. Chas & Dave did later contribute to the show, performing the closing credits song for the 1989 episode \"The Jolly Boys' Outing\". Both songs are performed by Sullivan himself, and not \u2013 as is sometimes thought \u2013 by Nicholas Lyndhurst."]}, {"page": "Elton John's Greatest Hits Vol. 3", "response": ["Also from Ice on Fire, the song again features George Michael and was originally released as a single and is famous for its name dropping of multiple famous women.
