The work is sold over the internet to students in the UK, the US and Western Europe. Despite criticism about the fact that students represent the work as their own, the company maintains copyright in all their work and they claim that the essays they sell are to be used as a study guide.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Littlewood", "response": ["* Barclay Littlewood, British entrepreneur"]}, {"page": "Template talk:Advert/Archive 1", "response": ["The template refers to \"this article or section\" and suggests using  for blatant advertising.  For those not in the know, such as the new user who was trying to get rid of some text at Barclay Littlewood earlier today, this gives the impression that a section within an article can be marked with db-spam in order to get rid of it, which is not the case.  Is there a way in which this can be re-phrased? -- Roleplayer (talk) 18:43, 18 January 2008 (UTC)"]}]}}
