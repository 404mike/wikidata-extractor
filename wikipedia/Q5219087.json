He first stood for Parliament in 1812 as Radical candidate for Colchester, and was defeated, but secured election for the same borough in 1818. At the 1820 election he was deprived of victory when his qualification proved defective, but he was re-elected in 1826 and for several elections thereafter; he subsequently also represented Southwark. He was a gifted orator and consistently took a moderate radical line, advocating limited reform both of Parliament and of the Church, and was at times bitterly at odds with the Whig government. In 1839 he was one of the MPs who took part in the conference with William Lovett's London Working Men's Association from which the Chartists emerged.\nIn 1821, Harvey founded a Sunday newspaper, The New Observer, which the following year adopted its present title, The Sunday Times. On one occasion he was imprisoned when the paper libelled the King, George IV.\nIn 1839, he was appointed Registrar of the Metropolitan Public Carriages,  becoming the chief regulator of the taxi trade in London. Later the same year, the City of London Police was re-organised, and Harvey relinquished his seat in Parliament to become its first Commissioner; he retained the post until 1863.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "City of London Police", "response": ["*Daniel Whittle Harvey (1839\u20131863)"]}, {"page": "Colchester (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Daniel Whittle HarveyHarvey was re-elected in 1820 but on petition his election was declared void on the grounds of defective qualification and a by-election was held", "|rowspan=\"6\"| Daniel Whittle Harvey"]}, {"page": "The Sunday Times", "response": ["The paper began publication on 18 February 1821 as The New Observer, but from 21 April its title was changed to the Independent Observer.
