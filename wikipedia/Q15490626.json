He is a founding member of the British EBM group Nitzer Ebb, programming Nitzer Ebb's signature sound.

Produced by the band's lead singer with Dave Sardy, the album also features programming and pre-production editing by Bon Harris of Nitzer Ebb. The band wrote over 100 songs for the album, which was a return to the darker, more abrasive sound of Antichrist Superstar. Much of its content was written in response to the Columbine massacre, with the album's third single, \"The Nobodies\", directly referring to the shootings. Described by the band's frontman as the third part of a trilogy which began with Antichrist Superstar and continued in Mechanical Animals, its overarching theme is an exploration of the relationship between death and fame in American culture, and its lyrics and artwork contain many references to John F. Kennedy and Lee Harvey Oswald, John Lennon and Mark David Chapman, and Abraham Lincoln and John Wilkes Booth. The \"Guns, God and Government Tour\" elaborated on Holy Wood's central theme, and with its logo \u2013 a rifle and handguns arranged to resemble the Christian cross \u2013 Manson made no attempt to conceal what he saw as the source of that fascination."]}, {"page": "Chelmsford", "response": ["* Bon Harris (born 1965)  of electronic music group Nitzer Ebb."]}, {"page": "Billy Corgan", "response": ["Also in 2004, he began a solo music career, landing on an electronic/shoegaze/alternative rock sound for his first solo album, TheFutureEmbrace, co-produced and arranged by Bon Harris of Nitzer Ebb.

Corgan toured behind his solo album with a touring band that included Linda Strawberry, Brian Liesegang and Matt Walker in 2005. This tour was not as extensive as previous Smashing Pumpkins or Zwan tours. Prior to recording TheFutureEmbrace, Corgan had recorded some 72 songs inspired by Chicago history for the largely acoustic ChicagoSongs project, which have yet to be released."]}, {"page": "Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death)", "response": ["Band members maintained a low profile during the album's recording. Manson indicated that their website would be their \"only contact with humanity\" during this period. The album was recorded at several locations, including Death Valley, Manson's home in the Hollywood Hills, and Rick Rubin's Mansion Studio in Laurel Canyon. Locations were chosen for the atmosphere they were intended to impart to the music, and the band visited Death Valley a number of times to \"imprint the feeling of the desert into [their] minds\", and to avoid composing artificial-sounding songs. Manson co-produced the album alongside mixing engineer Dave Sardy, while Bon Harris of electronic body music group Nitzer Ebb is credited with programming and pre-production editing. Experimental sound effects and acoustic songs were recorded using live instrumentation. Harris' programming skills would prove invaluable during the recording process, as he would take the natural sounds the band had been recording and reconstruct them into processed background effects. Manson also explained that the acoustic songs were \"acoustic\" in the sense that they were not recorded with electronic instruments, but he said the album's sonic landscape would be \"intrinsically electronic\".", "Ramirez and John 5 collaborated on the guitar compositions for \"Coma Black\"; the song alternates between Ramirez's \"warped guitar\" and the phaze guitar employed by John 5, with Manson providing additional rhythm guitar support. The album ends with an interlocking group of songs: \"Valentine's Day\", \"The Fall of Adam\", \"King Kill 33\u00b0\" and \"Count to Six and Die (The Vacuum of Infinite Space Encompassing)\" each end abruptly before being instantaneously followed by the introduction of the proceeding track. \"Valentine's Day\" was composed by Ramirez and Manson and feature Gacy playing the mellotron\u2014the second time the eccentric instrument appears on the record. John 5 recorded guitar parts for \"The Fall of Adam\" in the pouring rain in an effort to extract a unique sound and deliberately mistuned his Gibson for the song's intro to \"produce a sweeter sound.\" Bon Harris contributed the piano work for the final song \"Count to Six and Die (The Vacuum of Infinite Space Encompassing)\" while Gacy exchanged his mellotron for this track in favor of a string synthesizer. It concludes on a cliffhanger; it ends with the sound of a solitary bullet being loaded into a revolver against a background of distant fireworks followed by the chamber being spun repeatedly. Its hammer is cocked six times, although its trigger is pulled only five times.
