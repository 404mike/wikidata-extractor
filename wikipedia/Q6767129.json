The Ypres League sought to transform the horrors of trench warfare into a spiritual quest in which British and imperial troops were purified by their sacrifice. In 1920 Lieutenant-Colonel Beckles Willson's guide book, The Holy Ground of British Arms captured the mood of the Ypres League:", "There is not a single half-acre in Ypres that is not sacred. There is not a single stone which has not sheltered scores of loyal young hearts, whose one impulse and desire was to fight and, if need be, to die for England. Their blood has drenched its cloisters and its cellars, but if never a drop had been spilt, if never a life had been lost in defence of Ypres still would Ypres have been hallowed, if only for the hopes and the courage it has inspired and the scenes of valour and sacrifice it has witnessed.Mark Connelly, \"The Ypres League and the Commemoration of the Ypres Salient, 1914\u20131940\", War in History (2009) 16#1 pp. 51\u201376, quote p. 55"]}, {"page": "Dr. Mark Connelly", "response": ["#REDIRECT Mark Connelly"]}, {"page": "Charles Sarol\u00e9a", "response": ["*Samantha T.

The historian Mark Connelly argues that The Rommel Papers was one of the two foundational works that lead to a \"Rommel renaissance\", the other being Desmond Young's biography Rommel: The Desert Fox. The book contributed to the perception of Rommel as a brilliant commander; in an introduction, Liddell Hart drew comparisons between Rommel and Lawrence of Arabia, \"two masters of desert warfare\", according to Liddell Hart. Liddell Hart's work on the book was also self-serving: he had coaxed Rommel's widow into adding material that suggested that Rommel was influenced by Liddell Hart's theories on mechanised warfare, making Rommel his \"pupil\" and giving Liddell Hart credit for Rommel's dramatic successes in 1940. (The controversy was described by the political scientist John Mearsheimer in his work The Weight of History. A review of Mearsheimer's work, published by the Strategic Studies Institute, points out that Mearsheimer \"correctly takes 'The Captain' [Liddell Hart] to task for ... manipulating history\".)"]}, {"page": "Political geography of Nineteen Eighty-Four", "response": ["These states all, in effect, use the same totalitarianism, and are similar monolithic regimes. Historian Mark Connelly notes that \"the beliefs may differ, but their purpose is the same, to justify and maintain the unquestioned leadership of a totalitarian elite\". Each uses artificially-induced hatred of its then-enemy by its citizenry to control them. Due to the sheer size of the protagonists, there are, says Connelly, no \"massive invasions claiming hundreds of thousands of lives\", but instead small-scale, local encounters and conflicts which are then exaggerated for the purposes of domestic propaganda. Connely describes the fighting between the states as \"highly technical, involving small units of highly trained individuals waging battles in remote contested regions\". All sides once possessed nuclear weapons, but, following a short-lived resort to them in the 1950s (in which Colchester was hit) they were recognised as too dangerous for any of them to use. As a result, says Connelly, although London could have been destroyed by a nuclear weapon in 1984, it was never hit by anything worse\u2013albeit \"20 or 30 times a week\"\u2013than \"rocketbombs\", themselves no more powerful than the V-1s or V-2s of World War Two."]}, {"page": "Jo Fox", "response": ["*'\"The mediator\": images of radio in wartime feature film in Britain and Germany', in Mark Connelly & David Welch (eds.), War and the Media.

Fraser's biography remains a work of high reputation, with Pier Paolo Battistelli praising it for the outstanding handling of the issue of Rommel's myth as well as his life and career in general. However, the work has been criticised by historian Mark Connelly as \"encapsulat[ing] the post-1945 hagiographic approach\".
