It was released in 1977.", "William Mann reviewed the album on LP in Gramophone in August 1977, comparing it with rival versions conducted by Herbert von KarajanStrauss, Richard: Der Rosenkavalier, cond. Herbert von Karajan, EMI LP SLS 810 and Georg Solti.Strauss, Richard: Der Rosenkavalier, cond. Georg Solti, Decca LP SET 418\u201321 Collectors might be lured to the new recording, he thought, by Frederica von Stade's Octavian, \"a lovely reading by a favourite young mezzo\". Musically, she sang with a tone that was ample, even and focused, and was as meticulous in her ensemble work as a violist in a great string quartet. Dramatically, she was equally effective in every chapter of Octavian's story \u2013 her outburst of anger with the Marschallin was \"explosive\", her banter with Sophie \"perfectly delightful\", her feigned inebriation as Mariandel \"lovely to hear as well as comic\". As Octavian's mistress, Evelyn Lear had \"a timbre like old gold, a tenderness and teasing humour, many individual inflexions that recall no other Marschallin\". Her singing fell short of technical perfection, but her acting was \"attractive and skilful\" and all her most important passages were executed \"beautifully\". Ruth Welting was guilty of a few vocal lapses too, perpetrating the occasional \"flutter\" above the stave, but her Sophie managed to be self-assertive while remaining \"sweetly girlish\". Jules Bastin endowed Ochs with a voice that was generous and equal to all Strauss's onerous demands. He deserved praise for his \"attack and savory resonance, his smooth cantabile and his ripe enunciation of the text\", though Solti's Manfred Jungwirth was both more accurate and funnier in his handling of Ochs's peasant idiolect. Derek Hammond-Stroud was a good Faninal overall, even if he sounded too young to be Welting's father and botched one note at his first appearance. Jos\u00e9 Carreras's Italian Singer was \"too noisy\". The many minor roles were all performed competently by a legion of Netherlanders. De Waart's Dutch orchestra, likewise, was unequivocally good. Its woodwinds were \"crisp and savory\", its brass \"unusually firm and together and plump\", its strings \"active\" and \"stylish\". De Waart sometimes set a pace that was too slow \u2013 in Ochs's climactic routing or in the duet \"Mit Ihren Augen voll von Tr\u00e4nen\", for instance \u2013 but his preludes were incandescent and his tempi in general \"suitable and spirited\". \"The swagger of Ochs's entry in the second act [and] the elegance of the strings in the Letter Scene\" were particularly worthy of note. Philips's production team had chosen to balance singers and instrumentalists without favouring either over the other, and had resisted the temptation to deploy \"sound-effects or 'rhubarb' noises\". In sum, whether the new album was preferable to its competitors was a matter of personal taste. Karajan's slightly abridged version was \"enchanting\" and \"sparkling\"; Solti's, complete, offered \"unceasing brilliance\" and R\u00e9gine Crespin's Marschallin; de Waart's, also complete, was \"less vivacious\" than its predecessors but had von Stade's Octavian and the \"confidence and style and operatic personality\" that came from its theatrical origins.Mann, William, Gramophone, August 1977, pp. 339\u2013340", "George Jellinek reviewed the album on LP in Stereo Review in October 1977. Pre-eminent among its singers was Frederica von Stade, he wrote, \"an Octavian credible in all the guises of her mercurial role, who sings bewitchingly and whose warm, creamy tone soars above the staff with radiant ease\". Evelyn Lear's resigned-sounding Marschallin was not as compellingly acted as would have been ideal, but was sung \"exquisitely\" with \"many lovely phrases\". Ruth Welting's Sophie was technically impeccable and vividly characterized though somewhat cool and thin of tone. As Ochs, Jules Bastin made up for his \"limitations in range and resonance\" by singing with a legato stylishness and by entirely submerging his Belgian identity into that of the Viennese baron. Jos\u00e9 Carreras was \"refulgent\" as the Italian tenor, if manifestly challenged by Strauss's climactic high C-flat. Derek Hammond-Stroud and the secondary cast were all at least satisfactory. Conducting, Edo de Waart brought \"great affection to this music, along with a light touch, a great deal of tenderness, and, on the whole, just tempos\". He elicited orchestral playing that was beautiful, consistently aristocratic and had the transparency of chamber music. The price of his restraint was that his recording seemed \"somewhat lacking in passion\". Philips's excellent engineering was wholly honest and innocent of any irritating trickery. The album as a whole was a fluent, conscientious, theatrically informed reading that deserved to be applauded, but it did not quite come up to the extraordinary standard set by Georg Solti's version on DeccaJellinek, George, Stereo Review, October 1977, pp. 146\u2013147", "Alan Blyth reviewed the album on CD in Gramophone in December 1994. Its greatest asset, he thought, was Frederica von Stade's \"beautifully sung, engaging, fully characterized Octavian\", \"perhaps her best performance on disc\". She was as successful in portraying Octavian's comic dimension as his romantic and erotic ardour. The set's other three principals were less attractive. Evelyn Lear's reading of the Marschallin, although evidently the product of much reflection, was spoiled by a lack of emotional profundity and a voice that was unappealingly \"worn and unfocused\". Ruth Welting's Sophie was \"keenly sung but slightly brittle and monochrome\". Jules Bastin's enjoyably animated Baron Ochs was compromised by unconvincing Viennese diction and a timbre that was not deep enough for the role's requirements. The best performances in the minor roles came from Jos\u00e9 Carreras, in the high summer of his career, delivering an Italian Tenor of \"outgoing \u00e9lan\", and Derek Hammond-Stroud as a convincing fusspot of a Faninal. The other minor parts were sung unexceptionably but without great distinction either. Edo de Waart's \"lithe\" conducting resisted the temptation to wallow at climaxes and elicited orchestral playing of Mozartian elegance. The album's audio quality was \"clear and warm\" but placed the soloists further back on the soundstage than was usual.Blyth, Alan, Gramophone, December 1994, pp. 160\u2013162", "* Derek Hammond-Stroud (baritone), Herr von Faninal, a rich merchant, recently ennobled"]}]}}
