Born to a minor diplomatic official and his wife, Nolan was educated at the Austrian Inhaber Pioneer School at Tulln, where he was noted as an enthusiastic horseman and military theorist. After early graduation he was commissioned as a subaltern in the 10th Austrian Hussar regiment, serving in Austria, Hungary and on the Polish frontier, where he again became known for his horsemanship and was promoted to senior lieutenant. Due to the nepotism inherent in the Austro-Hungarian armed forces, Nolan succeeded in transferring to the British Army as a Cornet in the 15th Light Dragoons.\nDeployed in India, Nolan was eventually made the regimental riding master and an aide-de-camp to General George Berkeley, commander-in-chief in Madras, accompanying him on horse trials to evaluate the use of geldings as cavalry mounts rather than stallions, and was made a Captain in 1850. Returning to Great Britain in 1851, he toured continental Europe and wrote two books on horsemanship and cavalry theory, the second of which, Cavalry: Its History and Tactics, was universally acclaimed and led to the adoption of a Nolan-designed saddle by the British Army. A trusted voice on cavalry matters, Nolan was dispatched to the Middle East in the early days of the Crimean War to hunt for appropriate mounts. After returning he was attached to the staff of General Richard Airey, and in this role delivered the order that led to the Charge of the Light Brigade.\nForty percent of the Light Brigade's soldiers were killed, wounded, captured or rendered unfit for service, including Nolan, who was the first casualty of the charge. Contemporary accounts blamed Nolan for failing to properly communicate the order, either accidentally or deliberately, while some modern historians apportion the blame not only to Nolan but also Lord Raglan, commander of the British forces in the Crimea, and the cavalry commander, Lord Lucan.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "James Brudenell, 7th Earl of Cardigan", "response": ["His most notorious exploit took place during the Crimean War on 25 October 1854 when, as a Major-General, in command of the Light Cavalry Brigade at the Battle of Balaclava, he led the Charge of the Light Brigade reaching the Russian guns before returning unscathed, in a manoeuvre that cost the lives of about 107 out of the 674 men under his command who took part in the charge (although others may have died of wounds later on).The Nominal Returns of the regiments for the day, quoted in David. The extent to which Lord Cardigan was to blame is unproven, since he attacked only after expressing his doubts and receiving a direct order in front of the troops from his immediate superior Lord Lucan, commander of the Cavalry Division. The two men were barely on speaking terms as Lucan was married to one of Cardigan's sisters and, as Cardigan believed, did not treat her well.Woodham-Smith (1953), p. 132. The order had been conveyed by Captain Louis Nolan, who died in the charge, and both Lucan and Cardigan blamed him for passing on the order incorrectly. Cardigan's first action on his return from the charge was to report the undisciplined behaviour of Captain Nolan (whom he did not know to be dead) in riding ahead of him at the start of the attack.", "The Charge of the Light Brigade, a 1968 film based on Woodham-Smith's research, made Cardigan (played by Trevor Howard) its primary antagonist. The movie depicts Cardigan as a harsh disciplinarian, womaniser and military incompetent. It shows the \"black bottle\" affair, though it incorrectly makes Louis Nolan Cardigan's antagonist, and heavily features his rivalry with Lord Lucan. It also fictitiously shows Cardigan pursuing an affair with Fanny Duberly."]}, {"page": "Battle of Balaclava", "response": ["Having read the order scribbled down by Airey, Raglan summoned Captain Louis Nolan of the 15th The King's Hussars, Airey's hot-tempered aide-de-camp, to deliver it to Lucan.

Responsibility for the miscommunication has remained controversial, as the order was vague and Captain Louis Nolan delivered the written orders with some verbal interpretation, then died in the first minute of the assault.", "The order was drafted by Brigadier Richard Airey and carried by Captain Louis Nolan. Nolan carried the further oral instruction that the cavalry was to attack immediately. Although unnamed, the correspondent was William Howard Russell When Lucan asked what guns were referred to, Nolan is said to have indicated with a wide sweep of his arm\u2014not the causeway redoubts\u2014but the mass of Russian guns in a redoubt at the end of the valley, around a mile away.Woodham Smith, p. 239.

It said that Lord Raglan had sent an order for the Light Brigade to \"follow the enemy and try to prevent the enemy from carrying away the guns\", referring to some British artillery which were at risk. Raglan sent the order with Captain Louis Nolan, who passed it on to Lucan orally instead of handing over the written orders. He said, \"There, my lord, is your enemy! There are your guns!\", adding the word \"attack\", whereas Raglan had intended merely a show of force. Nolan's version of the order and accompanying gesture were misunderstood, causing the disaster described above. Nolan rode with the charge and was one of the first to fall in it. Maxse's letter said that Nolan was annoyed at how little the Light Brigade had done previously in the campaign, and that he was bitter against Lucan. Nigel Kingscote, another of Raglan's staff officers, agreed that the fault was Nolan's and said that Nolan would have been \"broke by court martial\" if he had survived.Sunday Telegraph Sunday 11 December 2016, p. 12"]}, {"page": "The Charge of the Light Brigade (1912 film)", "response": ["The film opens with two young British cavalry officers, Captain William Morris and Captain Louis Nolan, leaving home and bidding farewell to their wives in the parlor of the Nolans' residence.

Scenes then depict cavalry units preparing for action the next day. Lord Raglan, the one-armed commander-in-chief of Britain\u2019s Crimean forces, is portrayed on horseback issuing orders of engagement as he surveys the terrain and Russian troop positions. The film then depicts Captain Nolan taking Raglan's orders and riding to relay them to George Bingham, the Earl of Lucan, who commands the army\u2019s cavalry division. Lucan, also on horseback, is forward in the field and is scanning the enemy as well.

The company was interested in starting a copper mine in the Upper Peninsula; it secured a lease for that purpose and sent a prospecting party, led by Everett, to the Upper Peninsula.  Arriving in Sault Ste Marie, they met French Canadian Louis Nolan, who knew of Burt's discovery the year before. While not secret, the find was not generally known.  Everett expressed interest in the iron, and Nolan guided the party to the mouth of the Carp River (the location of present-day Marquette) and on to Teal Lake, but was unable to find the correct location.  The party continued onward to Copper Harbor, where they fell in with Chippewa chief Marji-Gesick, who was familiar with the Teal Lake area.  Marji-Gesick guided the party to the right area and showed Everett iron ore in the roots of a fallen tree.  The Jackson Mine was developed here. The stump of this tree was preserved for its historical importance until it burned in 1900, even so the tree was symbolically included in the seal of the city of Negaunee. Everett registered a claim to the site and had samples of the ore assayed; the ore proved to be of high quality, specifically hematite with a small percentage of manganese and chromium.
