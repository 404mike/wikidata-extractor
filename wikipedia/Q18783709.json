She published two collections: Poetical Effusions (1814) and A Lament upon the Death of Her Royal Highness the Princess Charlotte; and Alfred, a Vision (1818). Her work covers a wide variety of subjects, but scholars have noted in particular her topographical poetry and political poetry about the Napoleonic Wars.  \n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of English-language poets", "response": ["*Isabella Lickbarrow (1784\u20131847, E)"]}, {"page": "Kendal", "response": ["*Isabella Lickbarrow (1784\u20131847), poet"]}, {"page": "1814 in poetry", "response": ["* Isabella Lickbarrow, Poetical Effusions"]}, {"page": "Newspaper poetry", "response": ["Blair argues that, despite their sometimes 'derivative' character, newspaper poems 'operate as sophisticated and often politically charged reflections upon current events, as well as upon the practice and purpose of poetry'. One example of the latter is 'On the Fate of Newspapers', an early 19th-century composition by Isabella Lickbarrow. Dryly observing that newspaper poems by learned writers end up 'in scatter'd fragments torn', Lickbarrow laments:To think that what such wits have penn'd,Should come to this disgraceful end.Although present-day criticism has tended to privilege the novel, that genre was not the primary means by which 19th-century readers encountered the written word. Rather, Mussell notes, that title likely goes to the newspaper. Books were expensive; newspapers were relatively cheap. The average reader encountered literature through a journalistic middleman: as they do in the present day, 19th-century newspapers functioned as intermediaries between the elite world of letters and the popular audience.
