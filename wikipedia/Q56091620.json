Before the match both goalkeeper Stuart Nelson and winger Rhys Browne suffered injuries which caused them to miss the start of the 2018\u201319 season. The Glovers were reduced to nine men, following the dismissals of Tom James for a second bookable offence and Jordan Green for serious foul play, and suffered a 1\u20130 defeat. On 11 August, Yeovil faced Mansfield Town in their first home match of the season. Yeovil took the lead twice through Diallang Jaiyesimi and Yoann Arquin's first goals for the club but the Glovers were twice pegged back to draw 2\u20132 with all four goals scored in the first 26 minutes. Yeovil then faced Championship side Aston Villa in the EFL Cup first round, Yeovil thought they had taken the lead just before half-time when Jaiyesimi poked in at the back post but it was disallowed for a \"foul\" in the build-up and saw striker Alex Fisher have his penalty saved by Villa goalkeeper Andr\u00e9 Moreira. Villa's Conor Hourihane knocked Yeovil out with a late winner. The match also saw the Glovers give a debut to youth player Gabriel Rogers who became the first player born in the 2000s to play for the Yeovil senior team. On 17 August, Yeovil secured their first win of the season with a 4\u20130 victory away at Notts County, courtesy of a hat-trick from Alex Fisher and a fourth from former Notts County player Yoann Arquin. Yeovil extended their unbeaten run to three league matches with a goalless draw against Oldham Athletic, on 21 August. After only featuring in two matches for the club Brentford loanee Reece Cole's loan was terminated by mutual consent. On 25 August, Yeovil won their first home match since February with a 2\u20130 victory over previously unbeaten Stevenage, with first-half goals from Alex Fisher and Sessi D'Almeida securing the victory. In the days prior to the closing of the loan transfer window, Yeovil secured the signing of forward Omari Patrick on loan from Bradford City on loan until January, Luxembourg international defender Enes Mahmutovic on a season-long loan deal from Middlesbrough. Finally, forward Olufela Olomola returned to the club on loan until January from Scunthorpe United."]}]}}
