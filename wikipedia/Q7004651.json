He followed his brother to Stoke City in September 1982 for a \u00a340,000 fee. He was loaned out to Newport County and Plymouth Argyle, before moving to Newport permanently in 1984. The next year he switched to Mansfield Town, and helped the club to win promotion out of the Fourth Division in 1985\u201386. He spent the 1987\u201388 season with Doncaster Rovers, before entering the non-league scene with Stafford Rangers, Worksop Town, Shepshed Charterhouse, Matlock Town, Leek Town and Rocester.
