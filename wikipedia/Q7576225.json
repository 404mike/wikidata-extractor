David Theobald cleared off the line to deny David Lee a goal in the first half. Dobson then fired Brentford ahead on the 56th-minute, only for a header from Spencer Whelan to bring the game level just a minute later. Dobson struck the net with a shot deflected off the post on 64 minutes and the game ended with Brentford ahead two goals to one. The return fixture took place at Griffin Park a week later. \u00cdvar Ingimarsson gave Brentford an early lead on 13 minutes, but Searle equalised when his free-kick went in off Theobald. Brentford goalkeeper \u00d3lafur Gottsk\u00e1lksson left the game injured early in the second half, though young goalkeeper Paul Smith performed excellently in Gottsk\u00e1lksson's absence, denying Scott Forbes and blocking another strike with his legs. Owusu secured the win with a goal on the 78th-minute, assisted by Paul Gibbs. Darren Powell was sent off after receiving two yellow cards late on, but Brentford managed to hold on to their 2\u20131 lead on the night to win the tie 4\u20132 on aggregate."]}, {"page": "1990\u201391 Chester City F.C. season", "response": ["||| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Spencer Whelan"]}, {"page": "1991\u201392 Chester City F.C. season", "response": ["||| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Spencer Whelan"]}, {"page": "1992\u201393 Chester City F.C. season", "response": ["||| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Spencer Whelan"]}, {"page": "2021 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["*19 June \u2013 Spencer Whelan, English footballer (b. 1971)."]}, {"page": "Deaths in June 2021", "response": ["*Spencer Whelan, 49, English footballer (Chester City, Shrewsbury Town).Former Shrewsbury Town and Chester City defender Spencer Whelan dies aged 49"]}, {"page": "2021\u201322 in English football", "response": ["* 19 June 2021: Spencer Whelan, 49, Chester City and Shrewsbury Town defenderFormer Shrewsbury Town and Chester City defender Spencer Whelan dies aged 49 | Shropshire Star"]}, {"page": "1993\u201394 Chester City F.C. season", "response": ["||| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Spencer Whelan"]}, {"page": "1994\u201395 Chester City F.C. season", "response": ["||| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Spencer Whelan"]}, {"page": "1995\u201396 Chester City F.C. season", "response": ["||| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Spencer Whelan"]}, {"page": "1996\u201397 Chester City F.C. season", "response": ["||| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Spencer Whelan"]}, {"page": "1997\u201398 Chester City F.C. season", "response": ["||| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Spencer Whelan"]}]}}
