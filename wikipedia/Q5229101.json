Combined with the money made from selling No. 9, Jack and Vera have the cash ahead of the McDonalds and are allowed to buy The Rovers Return. As Jack has a criminal record, Vera is made the licensee. Vera, who always had elevated ideas of her own status, feels she has finally made something of her life.
