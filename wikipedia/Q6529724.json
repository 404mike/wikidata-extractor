His footballing skills flourished under new manager Arthur Rowe who was developing his push and run side which at the time was challenging for promotion to the First Division.

In 1951\u201352 the situation reversed, as \"Spurs\" finished runners-up, four points behind United. On 2 April 1952, in a match against Huddersfield Town at White Hart Lane, Baily caused controversy after he took a corner kick by hitting the ball against the referee, before crossing it into the box for Len Duquemin to score the winning goal. After a tenth-place finish in 1952\u201353, Tottenham continued to slide down the table, and battled just above the relegation zone in 1954\u201355 and 1955\u201356.

Nevertheless, matches continued to be arranged and played during the Second World War. The London clubs first played in the Wartime League and Football League War Cup, and Spurs won the Regional League South 'C' in 1940. After a reorganisation in 1941, they also competed in the Football League South. Owing to the difficult wartime conditions, Spurs along with other London clubs refused to travel long distances for the matches drawn up by the Football League and decided to run their own competitions: London War League and London War Cup. They (eleven London clubs and five other clubs from the south) were temporarily expelled from the Football League; after paying a \u00a310 fine they were readmitted, but they played in the Football League South in the way the London clubs had suggested. McWilliam went back to the North during the war and the team was managed by Arthur Turner; under him Spurs won the regional league twice. Charles Robert who had been chairman since 1898 died in 1943, and he was replaced by Fred Bearman. As it was difficult to field a full squad in the war years, many young players, among them Sonny Walters, Les Medley, Les Bennett and Arthur Willis, gained their first playing experience for the club in this period.
