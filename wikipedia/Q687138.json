He left behind a widow, Deborah.\nThe song \"Not For Keith\" on the album pH7 by Peter Hammill, (1979) was a tribute to Ellis.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Iron Butterfly", "response": ["In the late fall of 1978, a German promoter made an offer for the band to tour.

It included appearances by Clapton and Gordon, on \"Hello L.A., Bye Bye Birmingham\", although the majority of the album, including another remake of \"Tell the Truth\", featured new associates such as guitarist Rick Vito and ex-Van der Graaf Generator bassist Keith Ellis.Whitlock, p. 238. The album was co-produced by Jimmy Miller, whose connection with the Rolling Stones led to Whitlock making an uncredited contribution to the band's Exile on Main St. double album (1972). By this point, Laylas title track had become a hit song, following its release as a single to promote the History of Eric Clapton compilation (1972), leading to a critical reappraisal of Derek and the Dominos and belated commercial success. A 1970-recorded live album, In Concert, was similarly well-received when issued in January 1973. Raw Velvet peaked at number 190 on the Billboard 200, however, and it was Whitlock's last album to place on the chart. Whitlock tried in vain to get Clapton to come out and play; realizing it was not going to happen, after two years of waiting, he went back to the United States."]}, {"page": "Juicy Lucy (band)", "response": ["Juicy Lucy was a British blues rock band officially formed on 1 October 1969.

Through him, the band acquired a bass guitar player, Keith Ellis, with drummer Guy Evans joining not too long afterwards. This line-up recorded a series of demos for Mercury, before recording a single (\"People You Were Going To\" b/w \"Firebrand\") on Polydor Records, which was released in January 1969. Melody Maker said the single was \"one of the best records of the week\". But the single was quickly withdrawn under pressure from Mercury, since it violated the contract band members Hammill and Smith signed the previous year. Smith, feeling superfluous to requirements, left the band, amicably, shortly after the recording of the single. He later released demos featuring his time in Van der Graaf Generator on a CD, Democrazy.
