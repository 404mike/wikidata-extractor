It was also shortlisted for the 2010 Booktrust Teenage Prize and the 2011 Carnegie Medal.", "Out of Shadows took one year and six months to complete. Wallace himself attended a boarding school in Zimbabwe shortly after the end of the Rhodesian Bush War/Zimbabwean War of Liberation.Jason Wallace Website Retrieved 28 October 2011. While a student there, he wanted to write a story of what he had seen and experienced. The political atmosphere in Zimbabwe was declining and unstable, and inspired Wallace to begin writing fictional stories of his encounters. Though the characters in Out of Shadows are not real, they served to demonstrate the attitudes or personalities \"a very few people\" were portraying. Wallace notes that he \"came up with the idea of \"What if...?\" and took it from there\" when he was writing the novel. There may be many similar aspects of the novel's story may share with Wallace's real life but they are general details and are not very specific."]}]}}
