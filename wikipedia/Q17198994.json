Initially drawn to surgery, she chose to pursue a career in cardiology at the National Heart Hospital, Hospital for Sick Children in Great Ormond Street and later at the Brompton Hospital.\nHer work led to the opening of the world's first dedicated ward for children and adolescents with congenital heart disease, the first World Congress of Paediatric Cardiology in London, and a GUCH charity which was later renamed \"The Somerville Foundation\" in her honour. The medical professionals who she trained and who have come to celebrate and follow her are known as \"Unicorns\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "GUCH", "response": ["GUCH is an acronym for Grown Up Congenital Heart, a group of adolescents and adults who, due to the advent of open heart surgery in the 1960s, are surviving the heart conditions they were born with.
