He opened the batting, but in his only innings managed just 11.\nHowever, he had several good innings later in the season, including the only first-class century of his career: 103 against Glamorgan at Worcester.\nHe immediately followed this up with knocks of 88 and 42 not out against Warwickshire at Edgbaston.Stimpson had ended 1971 with 787 first-class runs at 27.13, but he suffered a run drought in early 1972, repeatedly being dismissed for very small scores. He did make 52 against Surrey in mid-May,\nbut it was not enough to prevent his return to the Second XI, and it was July before he re-established himself in the first team. Again he had a run of failures, but 88 in the County Championship against Kent brought him out of it,\nand 52 against Essex in the John Player League (his only List A half-century) gave cause for further hope.\nHowever, despite one more half-century (66 versus Nottinghamshire) by the end of the year he was struggling for runs once more, and 1972 was to be his second and last season of first-team county cricket.\nAlthough Stimpson's career in senior cricket had ended, in the mid-1970s he appeared on several occasions for Zambia in East African tournaments, and in August 1976 produced an eye-catching performance, hitting 89 and 128* as an opener as Zambia beat Tanzania.", "link_mentions": {}}}
