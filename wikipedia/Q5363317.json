She also provided the music for the episode \"Gambit\".She also provided special sound for the 1978 Doctor Who story The Stones of Blood, and incidental score for the 1985 story Timelash under the name Liz Parker. Parts of this score are featured on the Doctor Who: 30 Years at the BBC Radiophonic Workshop compilation. An LP of her score for the television series The Living Planet was released in 1984.\nElizabeth Parker was the last composer to leave the Radiophonic Workshop before its closure in 1998.Outside of this she has also contributed music for the series Fred Dibnah's Building of Britain, The Human Body, Animal Games, Weird Nature, and many other television series, as well the radio adaptation of Tom's Midnight Garden.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "BBC Radiophonic Workshop", "response": ["In 1995, despite being asked to continue, organiser Brian Hodgson left the Workshop, and his role was carried out remotely from Broadcasting House by people with other priorities and little enthusiasm. Malcolm Clarke and Roger Limb left. By the end, only one composer, Elizabeth Parker, remained.  The Workshop officially closed in March 1998, but Elizabeth stayed on for a couple of months to complete her last job.  John Hunt, (who took over much of the specialist editing side of the workshop previously done by Dick Mills) continued working in Studio E, now called \"Radiophonics\" until well into 2000, occasionally managing to fit in a bit of traditional Radiophonics work.

Elizabeth Parker provided the music and sound effects for \"Gambit\". Blake's 7 made considerable use of audio effects that are described in the credits as \"special sound\". Many electronically generated sound effects were used, ranging from foley-style effects for props including handguns, teleport sounds, spacecraft engines, flight console buttons and background atmospheres. The special sounds for Blake's 7 were provided by the BBC Radiophonic Workshop composers Richard Yeoman-Clark and Elizabeth Parker."]}, {"page": "List of film score composers", "response": ["* Elizabeth Parker"]}, {"page": "The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)", "response": ["* Radiophonic sound: Elizabeth Parker"]}, {"page": "Mindwarp", "response": ["Initially it was intended that the BBC Radiophonic Workshop would provide music scores for both this and the following segment of The Trial of a Time Lord; both were assigned to Malcolm Clarke to begin with, although Terror of the Vervoids was reassigned to Elizabeth Parker shortly afterwards. However, fellow Radiophonic Workshop composer Jonathan Gibbs left early in 1986 and was not replaced until the following year, leaving the other composers backlogged and with no one free to do the incidental music for Mindwarp. It was suggested that Dick Mills could provide both the music and sound effects, but John Nathan-Turner rejected this idea and instead hired film composer Richard Hartley to create the incidental music for this segment. It would be the only time that Hartley worked on the series. The original recordings of Hartley's score no longer exist in the BBC archives with the result that there was no isolated score included on the DVD release of this story. For the Blu-Ray release of Season 23, Richard Hartley, along with Mark Ayres re-recorded the entire score in order to present the serial in a new 5.1 mix."]}, {"page": "Terror of the Vervoids", "response": ["This serial marked the last time the BBC Radiophonic Workshop provided a music score for the series.
