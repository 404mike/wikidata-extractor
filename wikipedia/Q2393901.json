Driscoll never forgave Welsh for taking such liberties.", "Welsh and Fanny headed East to New York, and on 7 May he made his New York debut against Johnny Frayne.

Two uninspiring fights were arranged before the Driscoll encounter in December, a sixth round win over middleweight Joe Heathcote and then a ninth round stoppage over Dick Bailey.Gallimore (2006), p. 130 A long build up to the game caused the relationship between Welsh and Driscoll to sour, and when they met to sign the contracts, an argument broke out between the two men over the choice of referee.Harris (2004), p. 134 Driscoll lost his temper with Welsh, became verbally abusive and stormed out of the meeting.", "During his career Welsh was often reported in the British press as having learned his boxing trade in America, and therefore he had an ungentlemanly style of boxing, especially when compared to the darling of the National Sporting Club, 'peerless' Jim Driscoll.
