I am sad to be leaving but at this time I feel it is for the greater good of the band\".Steels also recorded drums with the Norwegian metal band Vestige of Virtue alongside Kjetil Ottersen and Frode Forsmo.Steels returned to My Dying Bride as a studio drummer for their 2012 album A Map of All Our Failures.
