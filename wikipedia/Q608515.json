The Black Knight (1892) and King Olaf (1896), both inspired by Longfellow, The Light of Life (1896) and Caractacus (1898) were all modestly successful, and he obtained a long-standing publisher in Novello and Co.The Musical Times, obituary of Elgar, April 1934, pp. 314\u201318 Other works of this decade included the Serenade for Strings (1892) and Three Bavarian Dances (1897). Elgar was of enough consequence locally to recommend the young composer Samuel Coleridge-Taylor to the Three Choirs Festival for a concert piece, which helped establish the younger man's career. Elgar was catching the attention of prominent critics, but their reviews were polite rather than enthusiastic. Although he was in demand as a festival composer, he was only just getting by financially and felt unappreciated. In 1898, he said he was \"very sick at heart over music\" and hoped to find a way to succeed with a larger work. His friend August Jaeger tried to lift his spirits: \"A day's attack of the blues\u00a0... will not drive away your desire, your necessity, which is to exercise those creative faculties which a kind providence has given you. Your time of universal recognition will come.\"Kennedy (1987a), p. 50"]}, {"page": "1909 in music", "response": ["**August Jaeger, music publisher (b. 1860)"]}, {"page": "Nimrod", "response": ["* In Edward Elgar's Enigma Variations, the ninth movement is nicknamed \"Nimrod\" as a reference both to the biblical hunter figure, as well as to Elgar's friend August Jaeger, whose last name translates to \"hunter\" from the original German."]}, {"page": "Samuel Coleridge-Taylor", "response": ["By 1896, Coleridge-Taylor was already earning a reputation as a composer. He was later helped by Edward Elgar, who recommended him to the Three Choirs Festival. His \"Ballade in A minor\" was premiered there.

Elgar and August Jaeger, his editor at the publisher Novello, exchanged frequent, sometimes daily, letters,Moore, pp. 302\u2013316 which show how Jaeger helped in shaping the work, and in particular the climactic depiction of the moment of judgment.Moore, p. 322 By the time Elgar had completed the work and Novello had printed it, there were only three months to the premiere. The Birmingham chorus, all amateurs, struggled to master Elgar's complex, demanding and somewhat revolutionary work. Matters were made worse by the sudden death of the chorus master Charles Swinnerton Heap and his replacement by William Stockley, an elderly musician who found the music beyond him.Moore, p. 325 The conductor of the premiere, Hans Richter, received a copy of the full score only on the eve of the first orchestral rehearsal. The soloists at the Birmingham Festival on 3 October 1900 were Marie Brema, Edward Lloyd and Harry Plunket Greene.Moore, p. 331 The first performance was, famously, a near disaster. The choir could not sing the music adequately, and two of the three soloists were in poor voice.Reed, p. 60 Elgar was deeply upset at the debacle, telling Jaeger, \"I have allowed my heart to open once \u2013 it is now shut against every religious feeling & every soft, gentle impulse for ever.\" However, many of the critics could see past the imperfect realisation and the work became established in BritainMoore, p. 357 once it had had its first London performance in 1903, at the Roman Catholic Westminster Cathedral.Kennedy, Michael, \"Elgar, Sir Edward William, baronet (1857\u20131934)\".

As he passed his 50th birthday he turned to his boyhood compositions which he reshaped into The Wand of Youth suites during the summer of 1907. He began work on a symphony and when he went to Rome for the winter\"Court Circular\", The Times, 6 November 1907, p. 12 he continued work on it, finishing the first movement.

Ernest Newman, commented that the words and music were not a good match, with the rhythms of the verse \"pushed and pulled\" to fit the music: \"you finally declare that by similar treatment anything \u2013 an Act of Parliament or a patent medicine advertisement \u2013 could be made to 'go with' the melody equally well\".Newman, pp. 123\u2013124 Elgar made an arrangement of the \"canto popolare\" for violin and piano, in collaboration with the violinist Isabella Jaeger, wife of his close friend August Jaeger.Kennedy (1987), p. 347 At the same time, he made an arrangement for solo piano, and his publisher, Novello, also issued an arrangement of the whole concert overture for piano duet, made by Adolf Schmid.Review, The Musical Times, January 1905, p. 32 "]}, {"page": "Harry Plunket Greene", "response": ["Plunket Greene was a friend of Edward Elgar's, and appeared in his Malvern Concert Club events.Young 1956, 126\u2013127.
