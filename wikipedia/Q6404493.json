Production for the album came primarily from Dave Okumu of alternative rock band The Invisible, alongside house Record producer Julio Bashmore and Kid Harpoon with contribution from Wilma Archer, fellow UK musician and collaborator Sampha and Hassan Hamandi, while Ware co-wrote most of the album tracks' lyrics. ", "Except for the fifth track \"No to Love\", which was written and produced solely by Okumu, Ware co-wrote most of the album tracks' lyrics.

Fellow British house record producer Julio Bashmore and singer Kid Harpoon also co-produced along with Okumu, with Bashmore handling solely the production of \"110%\" and Wilma Archer co-producing the eleventh track \"Something Inside\". Fellow UK musician and collaborator Sampha and Hassan Hamandi also contributed to two songs from the deluxe edition of the album, namely \"Strangest Feeling\" and \"What You Won't Do for Love\", with the former being released digitally on 14 October 2011 and the latter being premiered on 22 May 2012. Sampha was also credited as a collaborator on \"Valentine\", a song released previously on 14 February 2011 with Ware. The song was partly inspired by James Blake's song \"The Wilhelm Scream\" and based on both Ware and Sampha's own personal experiences in love.", "Devotion opens with the eponymous album track, a \"dark and dense\" song that hints at \"passion's underbelly\" with deep bass hit that portraits sonic signature by Okumu. The second track \"Wildest Moments\" is a \"boomy, earthy beats\" epic ballad that sings about the strength of friendship, with lyrics such as \"From the outside/Everyone's always wondering why we fight/Why do we fight?\" and Ware's vocal being a \"balancing act\" between \"gorgeous, bell-like\" synths and chiming piano chords. The song was among the \"most festival-ready songs-- big hooks, bigger drums\" produced by Kid Harpoon for the album. It was followed by the first single \"Running\", which saw Ware \"slinks and sighs\" over a yacht-rock groove, \"explodes at a key moment, then backs off again for an affecting conclusion\", gaining comparisons to that of Sade for her \"poised and pure\" voice over \"drums echo\" and \"repeated guitar lick\" which gave the song a \"lovely, sultry\" sound. The eight track of the album \"Sweet Talk\" is hailed as the record's most classically \"pop\" song, which finds Ware pleading \"Don't keep me with the kisses, there's never any there when I need,\" and hints at a \"Whitney Houston-like belt, but keeps it constrained\" within the song's \"chilly\" synths line, \"stuttering\" drum machine shuffle and \"gentle, neon-lit\" Rhodes piano riff. Meanwhile, the album's fourth track \"Still Love Me\" contains \"growing loop\" of effects and instruments that recalled the work of her previous collaborator SBKTRT, while \"No to Love\" is a song that contains \"grungy guitar loops, ADD beats, and rap verse from a Flight of the Conchords sound-alike\" ", "*Kid Harpoon \u2013 guitar, percussion, keyboards", "*Kid Harpoon \u2013 composer, programming, producer, engineer"]}, {"page": "Sweet Nothing", "response": ["\"Sweet Nothing\" was written by Calvin Harris, Florence Welch and Kid Harpoon, while production was handled by Harris.
