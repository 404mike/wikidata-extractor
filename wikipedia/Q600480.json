On 22 January 2011, Dalglish led Liverpool to their first win since his return, against Wolves at Molineux. After signing Andy Carroll from Newcastle for a British record transfer fee of \u00a335\u00a0million and Luis Su\u00e1rez from Ajax for \u00a322.8\u00a0million at the end of January (in the wake of Fernando Torres's sale to Chelsea for \u00a350\u00a0million), some journalists noted that Dalglish had begun to assert his authority at the club. Following a 1\u20130 victory against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in February 2011, described by Alan Smith as \"a quite brilliant display in terms of discipline and spirit\" and a \"defensive masterplan\" by David Pleat, Henry Winter wrote, \"it can only be a matter of time before he [Dalglish] is confirmed as long-term manager\"."]}, {"page": "Roy Keane", "response": ["The Daily Telegraphs Steve Wilson once described Triggs as \"the most famous dog in football since Pickles, a mongrel who dug up the stolen Jules Rimet Trophy in 1966, or that dog that relieved itself on Jimmy Greaves at the 1962 World Cup\". Henry Winter, writing in the same paper and noting Keane's tendency to go for long walks with his dog in the wake of controversial incidents, called Triggs \"the fittest dog in Cheshire\" and opined that \"if Cruft's (sic) held an endurance event, Keane and Triggs would scoop gold\"."]}, {"page": "Steven Gerrard", "response": ["In September 2006, Gerrard published his first autobiography, Gerrard: My Autobiography, ghost-written by journalist Henry Winter, which went on to win the Sports Book of the Year honour at the British Book Awards.

The autobiography ends with \"I play for Jon-Paul.\" Gerrard's cousin, Jon-Paul Gilhooley, was killed in the 1989 Hillsborough disaster, when Gerrard was eight. Jon-Paul, who was 10 when he died, was the youngest of the 97 victims of the tragedy. \"It was difficult knowing one of your cousins had lost his life\", Gerrard said. \"Seeing his family's reaction drove me on to become the player I am today."]}, {"page": "Shay Given", "response": ["With Joe Hart leaving the club on loan, Given was given the squad number 1 for the 2009\u201310 season. He made his 400th league appearance on 5 October 2009 against Aston Villa. On 1 November 2009, he saved a James McFadden penalty to help his side draw 0\u20130 at Birmingham City. On 5 December 2009, he made an outstanding penalty save from Frank Lampard to deny Chelsea an equalising goal. City went on to win 2\u20131. The same month, Daily Telegraph football correspondent Henry Winter named Given as Premier League Goalkeeper of the Noughties. While team captain Kolo Tour\u00e9 was on international duty, Given was given the captain's armband by manager Roberto Mancini, who described the Donegal-born player as \"one of the five best goalkeepers in the world\".

The Glazer's takeover of the club resulted in disaffected fans setting up F.C. United of Manchester, which, as of 2016, has become the largest supporter-owned football club in the United Kingdom. On the pitch, Manchester United began the 2005\u201306 season poorly; they were eliminated in the group stages of the Champions League and the manager was booed at home after United lost to Blackburn Rovers. Journalist Henry Winter in December 2005 opined that Ferguson needed to resign, writing in his column: \"Under Ferguson, United became football's answer to the Magic Circle. But the magic now drains away and so, next summer, must Ferguson.\" He stayed, however, and having already called time on Keane's career at United, he began reinvigorating his squad, by signing defenders Nemanja Vidi\u0107 and Patrice Evra. United returned to the Millennium Stadium eight months after the FA Cup loss, and beat Wigan Athletic to win the 2006 Football League Cup Final. Ferguson guided his team to their first League title in four years the following season, after stern competition from Chelsea, and won a further 13 competitive honours until his retirement in 2013."]}, {"page": "2002 FA Cup Final", "response": ["Journalists and pundits reviewing the final unanimously agreed with the outcome of the match. Matt Dickinson wrote in The Times of 6 May 2002: \"The force is with Arsenal, but it is not some ethereal presence, rather a brutish will to win derived from both triumphs and disappointments.\" The Daily Telegraph football correspondent Henry Winter was strongly critical of Ranieri's selection-making and suggested Chelsea's failure was partly down to Hasselbaink's lack of fitness, as there was no attacking threat. In contrast he commended Wenger's tactics \u2013 \"The decision by Arsenal's intelligent manager to deploy Parlour through the middle was a spectacular success\", and praised their players' mental strength and resilience. The Guardian's David Lacey also lauded Parlour's show in midfield, ranking his goal as one of the best in Cup final history. Although he agreed with the media consensus that the final was a drab affair and Arsenal's performance was not to their standard, he picked out several high-quality moments that the losing finalists failed to match, one in particular a timed-ball from Vieira. Glenn Moore of The Independent observed how Wenger turned his team of also-rans into winners, noting the manager's decision to play Adams  \"bore fruit\" as the defence dealt with Chelsea's increasing second-half pressure. Football pundit Alan Hansen called Arsenal his team of the season and believed their win was built on the experience of Adams and Seaman; of the former he wrote: \"Adams was also able to operate with the confidence that his goalkeeper was never going to make any mistakes.\""]}, {"page": "2007 Football League Cup Final", "response": ["Journalists reviewing the match praised Arsenal's young team; some however went as far to criticise their conduct in the brawl. Henry Winter wrote in The Daily Telegraph of 26 February 2007 \"\u2026all feline grace and youthful ambition, [Arsenal] were the better team, moving the ball around exquisitely at times,\" while Glenn Moore of The Independent reflected \"the Arsenal manager can take great consolation from the quality of his young footballers.\"  The Guardian correspondent Kevin McCarra opened his match report with the line \"To Chelsea the trophy, to Arsenal the future,\" and felt the latter club deserved plaudits for the role they played in the final, and competition as a whole. He commended Chelsea's adversity and singled out Carvalho as an example; at fault for Arsenal's goal, the defender's performance thereafter was faultless. Matt Dickinson of The Times agreed that Arsenal had played the better football, but said their temperament was \"brittle\" \u2013 \"[They] had lost the trophy before they lost their heads.\" Football pundit Alan Hansen was scathing of Arsenal's behaviour and suggested their inexperience had a part to play: \"When they reflect upon it, Arsenal will admit that they were largely in the wrong.\" He was critical of Wenger's team selection and felt the big clubs saw the competition, much like the FA Cup as an irrelevance. The violence and sendings off on the pitch led to some media outlets dubbing the match as the \"Snarling Cup Final\", or in the case of Winter's match report the \"Carnage Cup final\"."]}, {"page": "Battle of the Buffet", "response": ["Henry Winter writing for The Daily Telegraph gave a brief explanation as to why Arsenal did not perform \u2013 their striker Henry was \"not at the races.\" He was full of praise of United's determination and summarised: \"Yet though Arsenal had dominated possession, United had offered the more impressive individuals.\" Matt Dickinson of The Times described the victory as huge for \"Ferguson and his faltering squad,\" regardless of the scoreline or indeed if Arsenal had played the better football in patches. The Guardian correspondent Kevin McCarra felt aggrieved in the manner Arsenal had ended their unbeaten run, but pointed out they were fortunate no action was taken when Cole fouled Ronaldo. He closed his piece with an illustration of how impressive Arsenal's run was: \"In those prior 49 games they had never even been behind in the closing 20 minutes.\""]}, {"page": "Ched Evans", "response": ["Evans stated that he withdrew from the deal due to \"mob rule\", and that he was concerned the building of Oldham's new stand would be adversely affected by his signing. He also apologised for any grievances he had caused due to his rape case, but maintained his innocence. Journalist Henry Winter, writing for The Daily Telegraph, rebutted Evans' claims, instead saying that \"it was people's disgust that a convicted rapist felt he could swan back into a high-profile job after revealing no remorse for a crime that would preclude re-employment for many\", while criticising Evans for making \"his statement of contrition ... on the offensive, legally questionable website that continues to make life miserable for his victim\"."]}, {"page": "2004 FA Community Shield", "response": ["Manchester United made a slight change before the second half commenced, with Neville and O'Shea switching positions, while Arsenal brought Robin van Persie on in place of Henry. Arsenal began the half more strongly \u2013 Reyes sprinted past the Manchester United defence and went past Howard in the 48th minute, but his shot hit the side-netting. A minute later Arsenal scored. Bergkamp's pass put Reyes clear to run down the right-hand side of the pitch. He squared the ball to Gilberto, who side-footed it into the empty goal net. Manchester United responded by making three substitutions \u2013 Fortune, Giggs and Roy Keane off for Phil Neville, Diego Forl\u00e1n and Darren Fletcher. Five minutes after going behind, Alan Smith equalised for Manchester United. A mistake in the Arsenal defence presented him with the chance to hit a half-volley; the ball dipped over Lehmann in goal. Arsenal retook the lead in the 59th minute \u2013 a disjointed move that ended with Reyes shooting the ball low in the bottom left hand corner. Phil Neville was shown the game's first yellow card in the 62nd minute, after fouling Reyes. Van Persie's free kick a minute later was deflected for a corner, which came to nothing. J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Aliadi\u00e8re who came on for Bergkamp sustained a knee injury and had to come off after only a few minutes on the field. He was replaced by Ga\u00ebl Clichy, whose arrival according to journalist Henry Winter \"\u2026accelerated Arsenal's drive further, particularly down the left where he kept combining well with Ashley Cole.\" In the 72nd minute, Eric Djemba-Djemba and Cole were each shown a yellow card for clashing with one another. Arsenal scored their third goal of the match 11 minutes before the end. Cole carried the ball into United's penalty box and his attempted cross hit defender Mika\u00ebl Silvestre, who was helpless to prevent the ball going into his own net."]}, {"page": "2003 FA Community Shield", "response": ["Henry Winter of The Daily Telegraph opined that, injuries to players aside, \"The Community Shield itself experienced most damage\".

Martin Keown felt the manager harmed their chances by boasting they could go the season unbeaten. \"Look, I said that because I think you can do it. But you must really want it,\" was Wenger's reply, as he believed the squad had the right mixture of technique, intelligence and physique. Arsenal did little transfer business given the financial demands that came with their new stadium project; their only major signing was Jens Lehmann, who replaced David Seaman as goalkeeper. Wenger retained his best players, despite interest shown by Chelsea's new owner Roman Abramovich. Six games into the league season, Arsenal were involved in a brawl against Manchester United; the ill-feeling stemmed from Vieira's dismissal late on. Several players were charged and fined accordingly by the FA and Wenger apologised for his team's over-reaction. The team restored their image with an entertaining performance against Newcastle; Henry Winter in his match report wrote: \"Henry's opening goal encapsulated all that is good about Arsenal, the slick passing and intelligent movement.\" Wenger led his side to league triumph without a single defeat \u2013 an accomplishment last achieved by Preston North End 115 years before, in the Football League. \"Somebody threw me a T-shirt after the trophy was presented which read 'Comical Wenger says we can go the whole season unbeaten.' I was just a season too early!,\" he remarked during the club's victory parade.", "Though Wenger established Arsenal as UEFA Champions League regulars, he never won a continental competition \u2013 he was a Champions League and UEFA Cup runner-up with Arsenal and a Cup Winners' Cup runner-up with Monaco \u2013 often considered a blemish on his managerial career. Writer Michael Calvin argues despite the European failings, Wenger should still be considered one of the greats in football: \"[He] has been the best, most influential manager of the modern era. His job has involved managing change, and all the hypocrisy which comes with that. In a world where incoherence is routinely hailed as innovation, he has been a true visionary\".  Wenger's stubbornness to follow his idealistic vision of football was heavily criticised during his second decade at Arsenal. In 2016, Henry Winter reasoned the Frenchman's methods no longer gave him an advantage over others, and he needed to adapt or resign.  Winter also suggested the club was content with lucrative top-four finishes, and the manager needed tough individuals to challenge him. Ferguson however expressed admiration in Wenger's consistency and obstinate nature: \"He stays with what he believes in. And I think people who do that are outstanding coaches\"."]}, {"page": "2009 Republic of Ireland v France football matches", "response": ["Henry Winter of The Telegraph wrote that FIFA had \"gained some credibility\" by deciding to investigate Henry after the EGM, whose presence at the World Cup would otherwise overshadow the Fair Play campaign, and that the Henry controversy made the case for having a panel of experts examine every major game after the event for infractions missed by the referee. Winter contrasted any possible punishment of Henry with the two-month ban issued to Diego Maradona for simply 'insulting reporters'. Diana Worman on Aljazeera.net criticised FIFA's decision to investigate Henry for an act that happens all the time, and would have only warranted a yellow card, writing \"Henry should never have been expected to make a 'sportsmanlike' decision after the goal and it's unfair for Fifa to make an example of him\". The Canadian Press criticised FIFA's \"cowardly\" decision to investigate Henry and do nothing to change the situation for the 2010 World Cup.
