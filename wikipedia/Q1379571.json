Even Roger Lewis, who was blunt about his disdain for Frederick, admitted that \"of all of Sellers's wives, Lynne Frederick was the most poorly treated\". One of the first people to advocate for Lynne was American author, Ed Sikov, in the 2002 book, Mr. Strangelove: A Biography of Peter Sellers: \"Lynne Frederick deserves a bit of compassion herself in retrospect. It was the helpless Peter she nursed, the dependent and infantile creature of impulse and consequent contradiction. Patiently she ministered him\".

With noticeably less railway activity then previous episodes, the plotline revolves around the visit of a film crew to make a historical re-enactment of the Indian Mutiny. If the rolling hills of Somerset are a far-fetched 'India', the Great Western Railway pannier tank bears little resemblance to any Indian Railways locomotive, although a number of cosmetic touches were employed, including the fitting of an Indian-style cow-catcher to the front buffer beam, a star emblem to the front of the smoke-box door, and temporary nameplates, renaming the Flockton Flyer as the Star of India. In the two main strands of action, Jan Carter falls in love with dashing young actor Christopher Bell, playing Captain Ponsonby (and in reality played by actor John Moulder-Brown), whilst Bill Jelly (who has a small part as an Indian prince) saves the day when funding runs out, by securing \u00a3200,000 from an Arab Sheikh who owes him a favour \u2013 a story that nobody will believe until first the money, and then the Sheikh himself, arrive on set. Bob Carter reveals in the dialogue that the railway's facility fee will help open a further 10 miles of the old line, which would take the total length to 24 miles; in reality the West Somerset Railway was hoping to achieve just such an end through the facility fee from allowing filming of the Flockton Flyer, and their total railway length is now 23 miles, with some trains operating the extra mile or so over Network Rail tracks to Taunton. In a comical sub-plot Commander Frost returns from a holiday in Folkestone unaware of the filming contract and repeatedly stumbles into shot, accidentally spoiling shooting; his hints that he might make a good further extra (as a senior British officer) are ignored.
