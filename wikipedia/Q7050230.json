He fell in love with Trekkie, and they began an unconventional relationship that lasted until his death in 1969. She often spent the week with Leonard and the weekend with her husband. She had holidays and acted as hostess for them both separately. She was Leonard's companion on trips to France, Greece, Israel, and Ceylon. She wrote many letters to Leonard when they were apart, published in 1974 as Love Letters: Leonard Woolf and Trekkie Ritchie Parsons. Despite their declared love and companionship, Trekkie insisted that the two had not been lovers. During Trekkie and Leonard's relationship, Trekkie's husband Ian established a long liaison with his Chatto & Windus colleague Norah Smallwood, whom Trekkie despised."]}, {"page": "Norah Evelyn Smallwood", "response": ["#Redirect Norah Smallwood"]}, {"page": "List of honorary graduates of the University of Leeds", "response": ["* Norah Smallwood (DLitt)"]}]}}
