He decided to work on tahr because at that time everyone claimed to be an expert on red deer and he thought that he would make a greater contribution working on the lesser known tahr. Caughley wanted to see if Thane Riney's eruption and stabilisation patterns in deer also applied to tahr. He used his studies at the Forest Service for his PhD thesis at the University of Canterbury (1962\u20131967) advised primarily by Bernard Stonehouse (Antarctic and penguin ecologist). Using three study populations of Himalayan tahr (judged to be in the initial increase, initial stabilisation, and decline stage) Caughley found that tahr follow the pattern that Riney had found in deer."]}, {"page": "Stonehouse Bay", "response": ["Stonehouse Bay () is a bay in Antarctica on the west side of Laubeuf Fjord, indenting the east coast of Adelaide Island between Hunt Peak and Sighing Peak.
