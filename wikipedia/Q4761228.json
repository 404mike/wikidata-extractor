He performed as part of The Cryptic Clues, a spin-off band containing the three founder members of Twelfth Night in 2012, and at a one-off reunion of Twelfth Night in 2014.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Twelfth Night (band)", "response": ["The seeds of Twelfth Night were sown when guitarist Andy Revell and drummer Brian Devoil joined forces on 23 February 1978 to win a talent competition at Reading University. The road crew included Geoff Mann as backdrop painter, and Rick Battersby as dry ice engineer.  Devoil's previous musical experience was of various local bands in Reading, including Trash with whom he recorded a single \"Priorities\" released by Polydor in October the previous year. Revell's previous bands (in Bournemouth) included Joe Soap and The Bubbles and Abraxas. Later in 1978, Clive Mitten wandered into a rehearsal and asked for a job. Devoil described Mitten as being very good in creating opportunities, convincing them when he said \"you need a bass player\". Mitten had previously played with local bands in Brighton, including Luna Hare.", "Following a couple of gigs as the \"Andy Revell Band\", the band changed their name to Twelfth Night. In March 1979, the band completed its first recording which resulted in the 'legendary' Skan demo (Line-up: Devoil, Mitten, Revell). Later, during the Summer, they played one notable gig: a Midsummer Rock Concert at Reading University where friend Mann guested on vocals. After a couple of open-air concerts in the summer, the band retired to Mann's parents' home in Manchester for rehearsals taking Battersby with them. While there they played a gig in Salford to an audience of 10 year olds.", "Quite unexpectedly in June 2007, Clive Mitten and Andy Sears announced a one-off gig performing Twelfth Night material to take place in November 2007. By July, it had been confirmed that they would be billed as Twelfth Night, and in September, a 2nd gig was added and both Andy Revell and Brian Devoil were revealed as part of the line-up, with Mark Spencer (formerly the vocalist in 80s prog band LaHost, Andy Sears' one time flatmate, and an old friend of the band) replacing Rick Battersby. The band were invited to headline the 10th Tiana Festival in Barcelona in May 2008 - their second only concert outside of the UK, the previous being a concert in Germany in 1984. Additional gigs were added in the UK, and at one of these,  Geoff Mann's son James was invited by Andy Sears to accompany him on Love Song.", "Play On, the official history of the band, was published in December 2009, just as the band announced their next gig: as headliners of the Progeny Festival in May 2010. Five other dates were subsequently announced, along with a revised line-up that included Roy Keyworth (guitar) and Dean Baker (keyboards) from the UK band Galahad in place of the unavailable Andy Revell.", "* Andy Revell - guitar (1978-1987, 1988, 2007-2008, 2012, 2014, 2018)", "* Andy Revell - guitar", "* Andy Revell - guitar", "* Andy Revell - guitar", "* Andy Revell - guitar", "* Andy Revell - guitar", "* Andy Revell - guitar", "* Andy Revell - guitar", "* Andy Revell - guitar", "* Andy Revell - guitar", "* Andy Revell - guitar", "* Andy Revell - guitar", "* Andy Revell - guitar", "* Andy Revell - guitar", "* Andy Revell - guitar", "* Andy Revell - guitar", "* Andy Revell - guitar", "* Andy Revell - guitar", "  bar:Revell  text:Andy Revell", "! bgcolor=\"#E7EBEE\" | February 1978-September 1978 (as Andy Revell / Andy Revell Band)", "! bgcolor=\"#E7EBEE\" | September 1978-August 1979 (as Andy Revell Band until December 1978)"]}, {"page": "Fact and Fiction", "response": ["*Andy Revell - electric and acoustic guitar"]}, {"page": "Live and Let Live (Twelfth Night album)", "response": ["*Andy Revell electric and acoustic guitar "]}, {"page": "Voices in the Night (Twelfth Night album)", "response": ["*Andy Revell \u2013 electric guitars"]}, {"page": "Skan (album)", "response": ["*Andy Revell electric and acoustic guitar"]}, {"page": "The First Tape Album", "response": ["*Andy Revell electric and acoustic guitar"]}, {"page": "Live at the Target", "response": ["*Andy Revell electric and acoustic guitar"]}, {"page": "Smiling at Grief", "response": ["* Andy Revell lead guitar"]}, {"page": "Twelfth Night XII", "response": ["This album was not released on CD for almost twenty years due to an apparent contractual dispute, although one track from the album appeared on the original version of the Collector's Item CD, and another was added on the reissue.
