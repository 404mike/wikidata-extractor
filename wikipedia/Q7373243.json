Galley featured prominently in a close finish in his first match, against Yorkshire at Headingley, when he and Roy Palmer played out 15 overs from Test bowlers Don Wilson and Geoff Cope without scoring to save the match. But overall, he had little success, making just 27 runs in six innings, with a top score of 17 in his final first-class match against Kent."]}]}}
