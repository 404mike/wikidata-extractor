He typically worked in oils and water colours. He was a student of the Slade School of Fine Art where he mastered the arts of painting, etching, engraving and the then popular mezzotint. He had several works shown at exhibitions at the Royal Academy between 1889 and 1891. He is perhaps most known for his  Impressions of London (1898) and for his illustations of the first illustrated edition of Housman's A Shropshire Lad and Hilaire Belloc's (1904) The Old Road.
