Rogers won an unfair dismissal case, costing the club a 'five-figure' sum.

In July 2010 Neale Fenn, who had been signed from Bohemians at the start of the season, approached the club and requested that his contract be cancelled as he wished to retire from the game \"for the good of his family\". He also requested that his registration be returned to allow him play a \"little bit of football\". Dundalk manager Ian Foster agreed to Fenn's request, only for Fenn to sign for Shamrock Rovers four days later.
