He was born in Whitburn, County Durham.\nBilly Henderson, a right-back, began his career with his local side Whitburn from whom he joined Brighton & Hove Albion. He moved to Aberdare Athletic and played 19 league games in Aberdare's first ever season in the Football League (1921\u201322).\nHe left Aberdare mid-way during the season, in January 1922, to join West Ham United in a \u00a3650 transfer and was part of the West Ham team that won promotion to the First Division. He also appeared in the famous White Horse Final, the first FA Cup final to be held at the brand new Wembley Stadium, during the 1922-23 season. He was an ever-present for the Hammers during the 1923-24 season. He retired because of ill health after the 1928\u201329 season, having played 183 times and scored one goal, the goal being scored in the FA Cup against his old club Aberdare in 1924.\nHenderson was only 34 years old when he died from tuberculosis.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Whitburn, Tyne and Wear", "response": ["* Jack Young and Billy Henderson (footballers), both full-backs played for West Ham United in the 1923 FA Cup Final.1923 Cup Final programme"]}, {"page": "1922\u201323 West Ham United F.C. season", "response": ["|Billy Henderson"]}, {"page": "List of West Ham United F.C. players", "response": ["| Billy Henderson"]}, {"page": "William Henderson", "response": ["William, Willie, Bill or Billy Henderson may refer to:", "*Billy Henderson (American singer) (1939\u20132007), vocalist with The Spinners", "*Billy Henderson (footballer) (1900\u20131934), English right back", "*Billy Henderson (coach) (1928\u20132018), American football player and coach"]}, {"page": "1923 FA Cup Final", "response": ["Soon after play restarted, West Ham's Dick Richards eluded two Bolton defenders and shot for goal. Bolton goalkeeper Dick Pym fumbled the ball but managed to kick it clear before it crossed the goal-line. Bolton continued to dominate the match, and were only prevented from scoring again by a strong performance from West Ham full-back Billy Henderson. When West Ham attacked, however, Bolton were able to quickly switch to a strongly defensive formation, as players changed positions to form a line of five half-backs. This stifled West Ham's attacking style of play and ensured that the Bolton goal was not seriously threatened, and the score remained 1\u20130 to Bolton until half-time.  Due to the crowds that surrounded the pitch, the players were unable to reach the dressing-rooms and instead remained on the pitch for five minutes before starting the second half.", "|FB || || Billy Henderson"]}]}}
