Although the home side created numerous chances in the opening minutes and looked likeliest to score, Arsenal took the lead in the 22nd minute through Sylvain Wiltord. Poor finishing from both teams thereafter meant Arsenal progressed by a slender scoreline. In the fourth round, Arsenal faced Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road. The visitors' first goal came around the half-hour mark; defender Ashley Cole cleared Peter Crouch's goal-bound header and from that Arsenal launched a counterattack. Lee Dixon's cross inadvertently met Chris Plummer who scored an own goal. Wiltord extended Arsenal's lead a minute later, and QPR conceded another own goal early in the second half which sealed the tie in the visitors' favour. Arsenal finished as comfortable 6\u20130 winners, representing the club's best away win in the FA Cup for 64 years."]}, {"page": "Corby Town F.C.", "response": ["*Chris Plummer (2012\u20132013)"]}, {"page": "Plummer (surname)", "response": ["*Chris Plummer (born 1976), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Isleworth and Syon School", "response": ["* Chris Plummer - former professional footballer for Queens Park Rangers"]}, {"page": "Mark Peters (footballer, born 1972)", "response": ["In 2009 Peters joined St Albans City as player/assistant manager and youth team coach.
