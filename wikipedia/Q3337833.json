With competent performances from usually stalwart Canadians August Schellenberg, Chapelle Jaffe and Neil Munro, it's not the acting that's at fault. And with the focus on sleazy strip joints, cars with fins and private detectives with crooked grins, it does succeed in evoking the clich\u00e9d atmosphere of a '40s detective flick. There is a far more serious problem: writer/director Bruce Pittman's equal dramatic treatment of rambling discussions about bed linen and boarding fees and the unrelated incestual bloodbath. There's mystery here all right, but no logic.\""]}]}}
