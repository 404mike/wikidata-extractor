As a converted centre, at 5\u00a0ft 11 in. (1.8 m) he was much taller than was usual for the position, and his unusually long arms helped to make him a master of the \u2018dummy\u2019 pass. He was known for the unflappable way he distributed the ball, and his unrivalled ability to read a game. His natural ability is rendered all the more extraordinary when one considers that for almost all of his international career he was not playing club football due to his work commitments. A measure of his stature is that in 1987 he and his half-back partner Eugene Davy were the inaugural members of the Irish Rugby Writers Hall of Fame. In 1926 he was a key part of a back line that many regard as the finest ever to play for Ireland, with himself and Davy at half-back, Denis Cussen and Tom Hewitt on the wings, George Stephenson (qv) and Tom Hewitt's brother Frank in the centre, and Ernie Crawford at full-back."]}, {"page": "1924\u201325 New Zealand rugby union tour of Britain, Ireland and France", "response": ["Ireland: 15.William Crawford, 14.Henry Stephenson, 13.George Stephenson, 12.James Gardiner, 11.Tom Hewitt, 10.Frank Hewitt, 9.John McDowell, 8.James Clinch, 7.Robert Crichton, 6.Norman Brand, 5.William Collis, 4.Alex Spain, 3.Dick Collopy, 2.Thomas McClelland, 1.Jim McVicker"]}, {"page": "List of Ireland national rugby union players", "response": ["|George Stephenson"]}, {"page": "George Stephenson (disambiguation)", "response": ["George Stephenson (1781\u20131848) was an English engineer, known as the \"Father of Railways\".", "George Stephenson may also refer to:", "*George Stephenson (footballer, born 1900) (1900\u20131971), England international footballer, later manager at Huddersfield Town", "*George Stephenson (footballer, born 1865) (1865\u2013?), English footballer for Everton", "*George Stephenson (impresario) (1874\u20131918), New Zealand impresario, auctioneer, rugby footballer (1890s)", "*George Stephenson (rugby union) (1901\u20131970), Ireland international rugby union player, see 1924\u201325 New Zealand rugby union tour of Britain, Ireland and France", "*George Stephenson High School, Killingworth, England, named after George Stephenson the inventor"]}]}}
