It's like the notion of repertoire in the theatre, you have these tools, these methods of doing things, whereas in the game development business we always seem to be re-inventing the wheel.\"\nPenn is the author of the book Sensible Software 1986\u20131999.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Zzap!64", "response": ["The first issue of Zzap!64, dated May 1985, was released on 11 April 1985.

The editorial headquarters was in Yeovil, more than 120 miles from Newsfield's headquarters in Ludlow; the team was relocated to Ludlow after three months to cut costs, and Anderson and Wade left the staff after declining to make the move.

Reviewers of the Amiga version, however, expressed disappointment with the port for failing to exploit the computer's greater graphics capability and implement more detailed character sprites.

Tony Takoushi of Computer and Video Games described the game as a \"quality arcade-adventure\" and called the graphics stunning.

Three of Zzap!64s reviewers\u2014Julian Rignall, Bob Wade, and Gary Penn\u2014echoed similar statements about the graphics. The group complimented the gameplay, specifically the adventure aspects, and considered the large game world a positive component. A Computer Gamer reviewer praised the flying portions of the game, calling the gameplay enjoyable. While he praised the platforming portions, the reviewer commented that design flaws made the game more difficult than it should have been. Clare Edgeley of Sinclair User praised the graphical quality of the ZX Spectrum version, but commented that the colors occasionally overlap and the screen flickers. ZX Computings reviewer praised the ZX Spectrum conversion, calling it superior to the Commodore 64 release.

Three of Zzap!64s reviewers\u2014Julian Rignall, Gary Liddon, and Gary Penn\u2014called the graphics \"amazing\", well-executed, and \"varied\"; but they described the audio as sparse. Rignall and Penn complimented the challenging gameplay and commented that its addictiveness outweighed any frustration experienced while playing. The three summarized by urging readers to purchase the game. Computer Gamer reviewer Mike Roberts praised Spindizzys gameplay, but mentioned that the screen's orientation can require a period of adjustment, particularly when using a joystick. Crashs reviewer called Spindizzy \"one of the most addictive\" ZX Spectrum games, noting its innovative use of shape changing, multiple view angles, and speed control. The audio was seen as lacking compared to the rest of the game, but was still described as good. Phil South of Your Sinclair gave the game high marks for graphics, playability, value for money, and addictiveness. He praised the ability to change viewpoints and the realistic movements of the character sprite. He also lauded the speed and quality of the graphics. Info assessed the Commodore 64 version four stars out of five, recommending it as \"a hot little number with much of the appeal of Marble Madness\" but better.

That combination definitely led to the more open plan structure there is now. The game as it stands now is basically Elite in a city, but without quite the same sense of taking on the jobs. You take on the jobs in a slightly different way, but incredibly similar structurally. It's just a much more acceptable real world setting.

Funded through the crowdfunding website Kickstarter and written by games journalist Gary Penn of Zzap!64, Sensible Software 1986\u20131999 is a 340-page anthology of the company's full catalogue, from its popular 16-bit games (e.g. Sensible Soccer, Cannon Fodder, Wizball) to its lesser-known products and features. It also explains the personalities behind the company, mainly its founders Jon Hare and Chris Yates, through long-form interviews. Hare was elated when Wall originally contacted him about the project, but Yates, who has been estranged from Hare since 2003, did not participate. Hare explained the company's issues with scaling and hiring, and how the company was slow to transition to 3D graphics. Other commentators featured in the book include developer and entrepreneur David Darling, television personality Dominik Diamond, musician Martin Galway, and games journalist Gary Whitta.", "Read-Only Memory published Britsoft: An Oral History in 2015 and The Bitmap Brothers: Universe in 2016, both about a golden age of British game development. Britsoft: An Oral History was designed as a companion to the 2014 film From Bedrooms to Billions, which covers the \"Britsoft\" era of British game development from the late '70s bedroom developer cottage industry to the present-day billion-pound industry. The book uses developer interviews to tell the era's story so as to supplement rather than reproduce the film's narrative. Interviewed developers include coders and designers David Braben, Geoff Crammond, Mel Croucher, Dino Dini, Jon Hare, Archer MacLean, Jeff Minter, Peter Molyneux and David Perry, businessman David Darling, and writers Chris Anderson, Gary Penn, and Julian Rignall. The book's editor and former Edge editor, Alex Wiltshire, divides the title into eight sections: the developers' initial exposure to video games, the first wave as it attempts to sell its software in the early 1980s, the industry that begins to form, the wealth that comes to the industry, the relationship between these developers and a burgeoning games journalism, the transition from home computers to 16-bit hardware, the coalescing of industry and closure of small businesses, and the late 1990s dispersion as these developers left the industry or moved to less prominent roles in the United States. The book is designed to be read linearly and out of order, based on its presentation as anecdotal snippets rather than long text blocks. It also features linked page numbering such that readers can skip directly to the developer's next page. Reviewers described the 422-page volume by its heft, comprehensiveness, and academicism. Eurogamer and The Verge recommended the book for readers interested in the era as well as readers interested in artistic production. Nintendo Life described the book as lavish, lush, and pleasurable. Reviewers lightly criticised the book's lack of signposted introductions to the many characters, and complained of needing to flip to the appendix for explanatory footnotes and captions for the book's personalities and illustrations. Eurogamer considered the book to come as close to a definitive history of British gaming as is feasible, and praised the book's intimate and fun tone on otherwise dry subject matter."]}, {"page": "Doriath (video game)", "response": ["Doriath received mostly positive reviews  at the time of its release. Commodore Horizons gave the game 5/8 for graphics, 5/8 for sonics, and 7/8 for gameplay, calling it an \"excellent little cheapie\", and comparing it to \"Sorcery, Staff of Karnath, and any number of similar arcade adventures.\" It also praised the game for its \"true combination of arcade skills \u2013 avoiding guards and hazards \u2013 and adventure strategies and mapping.\" However,  the magazine considered the game's graphics to be merely adequate, and, judging it among budget titles, felt it inferior overall to Blackwyche. Laurie Sampson of Commodore User gave it 3/6 for graphics, 3/6 for sound, 4/6 toughness, 4/6 for staying power, and 4/6 for value, saying it was \"[s]plit fairly and squarely between adventure and arcade\", and noting that the game's audiovisual qualities were above average for a budget title; he also compared it to Sorcery in its focus on acquiring spells and items to overcome enemies and obstacles. He concluded that the Doriath was \"[a] good helping of entertainment for those itching to get lost in a labyrinth.\"   Zzap!\u2019s two reviewers were somewhat split; Gary Penn called it \"[a] fairly competent release and certainly a lot better than the other Rabbit/Virgin game, Zyto\", but found the wizard\u2019s jumping controls awkward and the game as a whole \"overpriced for what it offers\". Julian Rignall, on the other hand, called it \"a pretty gruesome game\", saying that the graphics were \"very poor\" and \"badly animated\", and also found the music \"grating\". He also said \"[t]he instructions are very poor, with practically no indication of what you\u2019re supposed to do\", concluding that publisher Rabbit Software would have to \"get their act together\" in the future. The magazine gave the game a mediocre overall score of 47%, concluding that it was \"[n]ot one of the better arcade adventures available but even so there\u2019s a lot worse.\""]}, {"page": "Penn, Gary", "response": ["#redirectGary Penn"]}]}}
