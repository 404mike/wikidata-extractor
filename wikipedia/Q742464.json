The condition of the observatory at the time of his appointment was such that Lord Auckland, the first Lord of the Admiralty, considered that \"it ought to be cleared out,\" while Airy admitted that \"it was in a queer state.\" With his usual energy he set to work at once to reorganise the whole management. He remodelled the volumes of observations, put the library on a proper footing, mounted the new (Sheepshanks) equatorial and organised a new magnetic observatory. In 1847 an altazimuth was erected, designed by Airy to enable observations of the moon to be made not only on the meridian, but whenever it might be visible. In 1848 Airy invented the reflex zenith tube to replace the zenith sector previously employed. At the end of 1850 the great transit circle of 203\u00a0mm (8\u00a0inch) aperture and 3.5\u00a0m (11\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in) focal length was erected, and is still the principal instrument of its class at the observatory. The mounting in 1859 of an equatorial of 330\u00a0mm (13\u00a0inch) aperture evoked the comment in his journal for that year, \"There is not now a single person employed or instrument used in the observatory which was there in Mr Pond's time\"; and the transformation was completed by the inauguration of spectroscopic work in 1868 and of the photographic registration of sunspots in 1873.", "The formidable undertaking of reducing the accumulated planetary observations made at Greenwich from 1750 to 1830 was already in progress under Airy's supervision when he became Astronomer Royal. Shortly afterwards he undertook the further laborious task of reducing the enormous mass of observations of the moon made at Greenwich during the same period under the direction, successively, of James Bradley, Nathaniel Bliss, Nevil Maskelyne and John Pond, to defray the expense of which a large sum of money was allotted by the Treasury. As a result, no fewer than 8,000 lunar observations were rescued from oblivion, and were, in 1846, placed at the disposal of astronomers in such a form that they could be used directly for comparison with the theory and for the improvement of the tables of the moon's motion."]}, {"page": "Pond Inlet", "response": ["To the Inuit, the place \"is and always has been Mittimatalik.\" The hamlet shares its name with an arm of the sea that separates Bylot Island from Baffin Island.

The hamlet shares that English name, Pond Inlet, used by the early Scottish whalers and traders, the Sikaatsi.

He named Pond Inlet after John Pond, a leading English astronomer who was Astronomer Royal from 1811 to 1835. During this first expedition to find the Passage, Ross became confused by a mirage of apparent mountains, at what he thought was the end of Lancaster Sound\u2014a range he called \"Croker Mountains\"\u2014and decided to turn back, much to the discouragement of Lieutenant William Edward Parry, who was the captain of the second ship in the 1818 expedition, the .
