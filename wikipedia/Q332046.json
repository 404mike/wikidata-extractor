Likewise, the mono version of the album uses a folded-down stereo mix of \"Help!\" instead of the true mono version used on the single, which features a different vocal track. Help! is available on CD as part of The Capitol Albums, Volume 2 box set. This CD contains both the stereo and mono fold-down versions as heard on the American LP release. A second CD release of this album, which contains the seven songs in true mono mixes, was issued in 2014 individually and as part of the Beatles' The U.S. Albums box set."]}, {"page": "Academy Award for Best Original Score", "response": ["| Ken Thorne"]}, {"page": "List of film score composers", "response": ["* Ken Thorne"]}, {"page": "List of musicals: A to L", "response": ["| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center\" | The Beatles, George Martin and Ken Thorne"]}, {"page": "Saturn Award for Best Music", "response": ["| Ken Thorne", "| Ken Thorne", "| Ken Thorne", "*Ken Thorne"]}]}}
