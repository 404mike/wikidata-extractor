After the subsequent work, which involved the erection of a new structure behind the old fa\u00e7ade as well as the creation of an entirely new modern structure to the east of the old building, was completed at a cost of \u00a34 million, the new building was officially re-opened by the broadcaster, Mark Carruthers, as the Roe Valley Arts & Cultural Centre in March 2011. Despite a proposal by Democratic Unionist Party councillors in January 2016 that the name of the complex revert to the old name i.e. the Alexander Memorial Hall, the building continues to be known as the Roe Valley Arts & Cultural Centre."]}]}}
