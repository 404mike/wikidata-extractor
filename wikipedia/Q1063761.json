On 11 June 1940, the day after Italy declared war on Britain and France, aircraft of the Italian Royal Air Force (Regia Aeronautica) attacked Malta.  Mercieca was compelled to resign the Chief Justiceship to avoid removal and was among those for whom the Governor issued detention orders  under the terms of the Malta Defence Regulations.
