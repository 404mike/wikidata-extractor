The majority of the team's goals were scored by forwards Gerry McAloon, Fred Durrant and George Wilkins, but when the goals dried up in September 1946, Brentford's form took a turn for the worse. Matters were made worse when McAloon and Durrant were quickly sold to Celtic and Queens Park Rangers respectively. A supporter, writing to The Brentford & Chiswick Times, commented \"it would seem that Brentford were unaware when they allowed them to go that Thomas, Durrant and McAloon had scored very nearly all the side\u2019s goals in the previous season\". Manager Curtis received half back George Paterson from Celtic in part exchange for McAloon and also strengthened the team with full back Malky Macdonald and forward Archie Macaulay. By December, Brentford had dropped into the relegation places and a run of 11 losses in 15 matches culminated in the heaviest defeat of the season \u2013 6\u20131 away to Sheffield United on Christmas Day.", "|Fred Durrant", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Fred Durrant", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Fred Durrant", "| Fred Durrant"]}, {"page": "1943\u201344 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["Brentford returned for the 1943\u201344 Football League South season again with a shortage of first team players, with just 10 available who made a senior appearance for the club prior to the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939.

The forward line was further weakened by the departures of Fred Durrant, Gerry McAloon (who had only re-signed for the club in December 1945) and George Wilkins during the season. Three new Scottish mid-season signings strengthened the back lines (Archie Macaulay, George Paterson and Malky MacDonald), but the slump failed to be arrested and the Bees crashed out of the First Division."]}]}}
