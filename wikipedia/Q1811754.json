Leeds would pay \u00a3100,000 to N\u00eemes to take him on loan until 15 April, after which they would have to pay another \u00a3900,000 to sign him permanently.Auclair (2009), p. 184. Cantona made his debut for Leeds in a 2\u20130 loss at Oldham Athletic on 8 February 1992. At Leeds, he was part of the team that won the final Football League First Division title before it was replaced by the Premier League as the top division in English football. He made 15 appearances, and despite only scoring three goals, he was instrumental in their title success, primarily with assists for leading goalscorer Lee Chapman. Cantona scored his first goal for Leeds in a 2\u20130 win at home to Luton Town on 29 February, and set up the other goal for Chapman.Auclair (2009), p. 193. Having played little football in the six weeks before signing for Leeds, Cantona struggled to find a place in an established line-up, with manager Howard Wilkinson preferring to put him on against tiring defences. Against Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane on 7 March, Cantona came off the bench to set up a goal for Gary McAllister, securing a win that moved Leeds two points ahead of Manchester United, who had a game in hand, in the title race.Auclair (2009), pp. 193\u20135. Cantona was deployed as a part of a front three, along with Chapman and Rod Wallace, in a 5\u20131 thrashing of Wimbledon at Elland Road on 14 March, scoring Leeds' fourth goal of the game.Auclair (2009), p. 196."]}, {"page": "Leslie Ash", "response": ["Ash is married to former footballer Lee Chapman, and they have two sons.
