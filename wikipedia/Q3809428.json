He played for the club as a youth, then as a first-team player before injury cut short his career. He then joined the coaching staff, before becoming the manager of the senior team in 1974. He stayed in that role until 1989. He subsequently went on to manage Ipswich Town from 1990\u20131994.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "West Ham United F.C.", "response": ["After a difficult start to the 1974\u201375 season, Greenwood moved himself \"upstairs\" to become general manager and, without informing the board, appointed his assistant John Lyall as team manager.

Lyall then guided West Ham to another European Cup Winners' Cup final in 1976, though the team lost the match 4\u20132 to Belgian side Anderlecht. Greenwood's tenure as general manager lasted less than three years, as he was appointed to manage England in the wake of Don Revie's resignation in 1977.", "Redknapp's time at West Ham was notable for the turnover of players during his tenure and for the level of attractive football and success which had not been seen since the managership of John Lyall. Over 134 players passed through the club while he was manager, producing a net transfer fee deficit of \u00a316\u00a0million, despite the \u00a318\u00a0million sale of Rio Ferdinand to Leeds United. Some were notably successful, such as the signings of Stuart Pearce, Trevor Sinclair, Paolo Di Canio, John Hartson, Eyal Berkovic and Ian Wright. Meanwhile, some were expensive, international players who failed at West Ham, such as Florin Raducioiu; Davor \u0160uker, who earned as much in wages as the revenue gained from one entire stand and yet made only eight appearances; Christian Bassila, who cost \u00a3720,000 and played only 86 minutes of football; Titi Camara; Gary Charles, whose wages amounted to \u00a34.4\u00a0million but made only three starts for the club; Rigobert Song; Paulo Futre; and Marco Boogers, a player often quoted as one of the biggest failures in the Premier League. His first season in charge saw West Ham fighting the threat of relegation until the last few weeks, while his third season would also see another relegation battle. Always willing to enter the transfer market, Redknapp bought in the winter transfer window John Hartson and Paul Kitson who added the impetus needed at the season's end.", "| style=\"text-align:left;\"|  John Lyall || style=\"text-align:center;\" | ||1974\u201389|| 708|| 277|| 176||255|| 39.12 ||  FA Cup winners 1975, 1980.
