Villeneuve frequently went past the edge of the available track to increase his momentum as much as possible. He provided his engineers with suggestions that Maurice Hamilton wrote were \"so far from the norm to the point of diametrically opposed to standard practice, sometimes giving the impression of being pursued just for the hell of it.\" Villeneuve prefers driving on slick tyres and with no electronic driver aids. He found driver aids difficult and thus ran with less traction control than his teammates since he could not deal with either the anti-lock system on the rear brakes or heavy traction control. This required Villeneuve to modify his driving style and take fewer risks until his exit from F1 in 2006. He switched from wearing spectacles in his helmet to contact lenses in 1994 after his spectacles vibrated slightly on minor bumps in Indianapolis."]}, {"page": "Mark Webber (racing driver)", "response": ["In describing Webber's driving style, journalist Mark Hughes stated: \"The thing he does arguably better than anyone else, is extract every ounce of potential from the car through fast, aerodynamically-loaded corners\" since extra lap time could be located in slower turns because the car remains in them for longer. He was able to feel the braking grip of his tyres and could correctly modulate throttle power as grip levels reduced under braking to slow the vehicle down. Entering a braking zone, Webber achieved more retardation rate in a downforce-reliant car than other drivers and as the downforce decreased he was able to modulate pressure and sensitivity well to remain within the tyre's grip limit. His braking pressure force enabled him to translate lap time where the entry speed is high enough to make this possible without brake locking. His driving style, which was refined in downforce-heavy sports cars in the late 1990s, was not suited to a more gentle approach required for driving V8 F1 Pirelli-shod cars because of how he managed those brand of tyres that wore out faster than the Bridgestone compounds he was accustomed to."]}, {"page": "Mark Hughes (disambiguation)", "response": ["Mark Hughes (born 1963) is a Welsh international football player and manager.", "Mark Hughes may also refer to:", "*Mark Hughes (basketball) (born 1966), American basketball player and coach", "*Mark Hughes (Emmerdale), fictional character on the ITV soap opera Emmerdale", "*Mark Hughes (footballer, born 1962), Welsh football player for Tranmere", "*Mark Hughes (footballer, born 1983), Northern Ireland international football player", "*Mark Hughes (footballer, born 1986), English football player for Accrington Stanley", "*Mark Hughes (footballer, born 1993), Irish footballer", "*Mark Hughes (fighter) (born 1973), American former mixed martial arts fighter", "*Mark Hughes (journalist), English Formula One journalist", "*Mark Hughes (politician) (1932\u20131993), MP for the city of Durham, 1970\u20131983", "*Mark Hughes (rugby league, born 1976), Australian rugby league footballer who played in the 1990s and 2000s", "*Mark Hughes (rugby league, born 1954), English-born Australian rugby league footballer who played in the 1970s and 1980s", "*Mark Hughes (motorsport), British motorsport manager"]}, {"page": "Mark Hughes - Motorsport", "response": ["#REDIRECT Mark Hughes (motorsport)"]}]}}
