The poor weather conditions resulted in the match being shortened to 60 minutes and the relatively unknown status of the Welsh side led to a low turnout of spectators; newspaper reports estimate the crowd was in the low hundreds with some even writing there were fewer than 100 in attendance. In the match, William Davies scored Wales' first international goal but his side were defeated 2\u20131 following goals from Herbert Whitfeld and Thomas Sorby. The standard of the Welsh side was slowly improving and the side nearly held the visiting English side in March 1880. Having trailed 3\u20130, the Welsh side scored twice in the final ten minutes through William Roberts and John Roberts but were unable to equalise. William Roberts also scored Wales' goal against Scotland two weeks later in a 5\u20131 defeat. Wales travelled to Alexandra Meadows in Blackburn the following year to play England; John Vaughan scored the only goal of the game as Wales won their first international football match."]}]}}
