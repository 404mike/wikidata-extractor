He left the Glasgow side to join Manchester City in September 1901. His City debut came on 5 October 1901 in a 2\u20130 defeat against Notts County at Trent Bridge. In five seasons he played 171 matches for City, scoring nine goals and helping them to the 1902-03 Second Division and the 1903-04 FA Cup; such was his value to the club he was reportedly paid more than their star player, Billy Meredith.\nHowever, Hynds was engulfed in an illegal payments scandal in 1904 and was banned from football for four months and fined \u00a375. While still under suspension, he was transferred to Woolwich Arsenal in December 1906. He made his Arsenal debut on 1 January 1907, against Sheffield Wednesday, but spent just five months at the club, displacing Percy Sands from the centre half position for thirteen League matches and four FA Cup ties, as Arsenal reached the semi-finals of the 1906-07 competition. He scored one goal for the club.\nHynds left Arsenal in May 1907, playing a single season for Leeds City (where he was also captain), before returning to Scotland to play for Heart of Midlothian in 1908, where he played thirty five matches. He later coached abroad, in British Columbia and Italy. Hynds' brother John also attempted a football career, but did not progress beyond the Manchester City reserve team.Hynds represented the Scottish League once, in 1901.", "link_mentions": {}}}
