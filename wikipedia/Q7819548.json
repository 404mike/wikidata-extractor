It is known that he was presented with a Scottish Cup winner's medal from 1899, although he only played in one match during the run.\nHe left the Glasgow side to join Manchester City in September 1901. His City debut came on 5 October 1901 in a 2\u20130 defeat against Notts County at Trent Bridge. In five seasons he played 171 matches for City, scoring nine goals and helping them to the Second Division in 1902\u201303 and the FA Cup in 1903\u201304; such was his value to the club he was reportedly paid more than their star player, Billy Meredith.\nHowever, the club was engulfed in an illegal payments scandal and Hynds was banned from football for four months and fined \u00a375. While still under suspension, he was transferred to Woolwich Arsenal in December 1906. He made his debut on 1 January 1907 against Sheffield Wednesday but spent just five months at the club, displacing Percy Sands from the centre half position for 13 League matches and four FA Cup ties, as Arsenal reached the semi-finals of the 1906\u201307 competition. He scored one goal for the club.\nHynds left Arsenal in May 1907, playing a single season for Leeds City (where he was also captain), before returning to Scotland to play for Heart of Midlothian in 1908, where he played 39 league and Scottish Cup matches. He later coached abroad, in British Columbia and Italy. Hynds's brother John also attempted a football career, but did not progress beyond the Manchester City reserve team.Hynds represented the Scottish League once in February 1901, although at club level he had not featured for the Celtic first team for several weeks prior. While with Manchester City he played in the Home Scots v Anglo-Scots annual trial match in 1905, and during his time at Arsenal was invited to take part again (along with four team-mates) in the 1907 edition; neither appearance led on to a full international cap for Scotland.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Archie Gray", "response": ["In the summer of 1904 Gray moved south to London to join Woolwich Arsenal, who had just been promoted to the First Division for the first time.
