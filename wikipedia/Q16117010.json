He is best known for designing album covers for numerous bands in the 1970s and his collaborations with long-term friend, singer-songwriter David Bowie.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "David Bowie", "response": ["Bowie studied art, music, and design, including layout and typesetting. After Burns introduced him to modern jazz, his enthusiasm for players like Charles Mingus and John Coltrane led his mother to give him a Grafton saxophone in 1961. He was soon receiving lessons from baritone saxophonist Ronnie Ross. He received a serious injury at school in 1962 when his friend George Underwood punched him in the left eye during a fight over a girl. After a series of operations during a four-month hospitalisation, his doctors determined that the damage could not be fully repaired and Bowie was left with faulty depth perception and anisocoria (a permanently dilated pupil), which gave a false impression of a change in the iris' colour, erroneously suggesting he had heterochromia iridum (one iris a different colour to the other); his eye later became one of Bowie's most recognisable features. Despite their altercation, Bowie remained on good terms with Underwood, who went on to create the artwork for Bowie's early albums."]}, {"page": "The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars", "response": ["The album cover photograph was taken by photographer Brian Ward in monochrome, and recoloured by illustrator Terry Pastor, a partner at the Main Artery design studio in Covent Garden with Bowie's longtime friend George Underwood; both had previously done the artwork and sleeve for Hunky Dory. The typography, initially pressed onto the original image using Letraset, was airbrushed by Pastor red and yellow and inset with white stars. Pegg notes that unlike many of Bowie's album sleeves, which feature close-ups of Bowie in a studio, the Ziggy image has Bowie almost in the foreground. Pegg describes the shot as: \"Bowie (or Ziggy) [stands] as a diminutive figure dwarfed by the shabby urban landscape, picked out in the light of a street lamp, framed by cardboard boxes and parked cars\". Bowie is also holding a Gibson Les Paul guitar, which was owned by Arnold Corns guitarist Mark Pritchett and was the same guitar Pritchett used on the Corns' recordings of \"Moonage Daydream\" and \"Hang On to Yourself\". Similar to Hunky Dorys cover, Bowie's jumpsuit and hair, which was still his natural brown at the time, were artificially retinted, which Pegg believes gives the impression that the \"guitar-clutching visitor\" is from another dimension or world."]}, {"page": "David Bowie (1969 album)", "response": ["\"Letter to Hermione\" was a farewell ballad to Bowie's former girlfriend Hermione Farthingale, who is also the subject of \"An Occasional Dream\", a gentle folk tune reminiscent of the singer's 1967 debut album. \"God Knows I'm Good\", Bowie's observational tale of a shoplifter's plight, also recalls his earlier style. \"Cygnet Committee\" has been called Bowie's \"first true masterpiece\". Commonly regarded as the track on David Bowie most indicative of the composer's future direction, its lead character is a messianic figure \"who breaks down barriers for his younger followers, but finds that he has only provided them with the means to reject and destroy him\". Bowie himself described the song at the time as a put down of hippies who seemed ready to follow any charismatic leader. \"Janine\" was written about a girlfriend of Bowie's childhood friend George Underwood. It has been cited as another track that foreshadowed themes to which Bowie would return in the 1970s, in this case the fracturing of personality, featuring the words \"But if you took an axe to me, you'd kill another man not me at all\"."]}, {"page": "Electric Warrior", "response": ["The cover artwork was designed by British art design group Hipgnosis, based on a photo taken by Kieron \"Spud\" Murphy at a T.

Similar to the artwork for Station to Station, it features an altered still frame from The Man Who Fell to Earth. Bowie is seen in profile as his character from the film, Thomas Jerome Newton, wearing a duffel coat set against an orange background. His hair is the same colour as the background, which Wilcken says \"underlines the solipsistic notion of place reflecting person, object and subject melding into one\". Wilcken notes that as The Man Who Fell to Earth was out of theatres by the time of Lows release, the design choice was not to promote the film, but to show the connection between it and the album. Buckley writes that the cover was a visual pun, meaning 'low profile'; many did not understand the joke until Bowie pointed it out in a later interview."]}, {"page": "All the Young Dudes (album)", "response": ["* George Underwood \u2013 cover art, colour retouching"]}, {"page": "Shine On Brightly", "response": ["* George Underwood \u2013 front cover art design"]}, {"page": "Gentle Giant (album)", "response": ["* George Underwood \u2013 cover artist"]}, {"page": "Futuristic Dragon", "response": ["The sleeve illustration was conceived by artist George Underwood, who had first worked with Bolan on the 1968 Tyrannosaurus Rex album My People Were Fair and Had Sky in Their Hair....", "* George Underwood \u2013 cover artwork"]}, {"page": "Liza Jane (David Bowie song)", "response": ["* George Underwood \u2013 rhythm guitar, Harmonica, vocals"]}, {"page": "George Underwood", "response": ["George Underwood may refer to:", "* George Underwood (artist) (born 1947), English artist and musician", "* George Underwood (athlete) (1884\u20131943), American athlete", "* George Underwood, recorded by Domino Records"]}, {"page": "My People Were Fair and Had Sky in Their Hair...
