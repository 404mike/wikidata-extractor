A young woman called Hur (Alethea Charlton) warns him that if he fails to do so, the stranger called Kal (Jeremy Young) will be made leader. After exiting the TARDIS, the unnamed old man, whom Ian and Barbara refer to as the Doctor, is kidnapped by Kal, when he witnesses him light a match. Kal takes the Doctor back to the tribe and threatens to kill him if he does not make fire; Ian, Barbara and Susan intervene, but the group is imprisoned in a large cave. With the help of Old Mother (Eileen Way), who believes that fire will bring death to the tribe, they escape from the settlement but are intercepted and recaptured before reaching the TARDIS. Kal says they will be sacrificed if they do not make fire. While Ian tries to start a fire, Kal enters the cave and attacks Za, but is killed. Ian gives a burning torch to Za, who shows it to the tribe and is declared leader. Susan notices that placing a skull over a burning torch makes it appear alive; when the tribe enters the cave, they are faced with several burning skulls, and are terrified, allowing the group to flee to the TARDIS and escape through time and space to a silent and unknown forest.

Elizabeth takes a potion to bring on labour early so Warleggan will be led to think that she habitually delivers her children a few weeks prematurely; Elizabeth had delivered Valentine, born eight months after her wedding to George, after she took a supposed accidental fall on the stairs, which, it is implied only, was intentional on her part because she felt the labour coming on. Valentine is Ross's son, conceived a month before Elizabeth and George's wedding, but George is long deceived as to Valentine's parentage. Agatha Poldark (Eileen Way) and Prudie Paynter (Mary Wimbush), Ross and Demelza's housekeeper, both realize that Valentine is Ross's son, and Agatha tells George of her conclusion just before her death, which occurs under George's abuse of her in his anger over her revelation. Elizabeth dies of gangrene due to the potion. When the doctor asks her if she has taken anything to bring on the labour, she denies it because Warleggan is sitting beside her. George later reveals his knowledge of what Elizabeth has done when he says to Ross, \"See what you and I have brought her to.\""]}, {"page": "They Who Dare", "response": ["*Eileen Way as Greek woman"]}, {"page": "Sphinx (film)", "response": ["*Eileen Way as Aida "]}, {"page": "The Bargee", "response": ["* Eileen Way as Onlooker"]}, {"page": "Queen of Hearts (1989 film)", "response": ["* Eileen Way as Mama Sibilla"]}, {"page": "The Singer Not the Song", "response": ["*Eileen Way as cigar-smoking woman"]}, {"page": "Blood Orange (1953 film)", "response": ["* Eileen Way as Mme Fernande"]}, {"page": "The Comedy Man", "response": ["* Eileen Way - Landlady"]}, {"page": "Crane (TV series)", "response": ["5.
