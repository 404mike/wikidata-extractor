Edo and I met him in Bondi on a night out when [Gomez] were on their second tour in Australia and we connected on one very drunken night.

Having Ian Ball from Gomez co-producing certainly helps but the compositions, the arrangements and the sentiment communicated throughout Gelbison\u2019s debut LP is virtually faultless and much more than clever guidance from an established artist/producer.\" Tim Cashmere of Undercover opined that \"imagine if the out there factor could be multiplied by a thousand or so.
