Instead, an eight-part serial was commissioned, with filming beginning in April 2017. It was written by Charlie Covell, and episodes were directed by Entwistle and Lucy Tcherniak. In August 2018, the programme was renewed for a second series, which premiered on Channel 4 on 4 November 2019, after which all eight episodes were released on All 4, and internationally on Netflix the next day. Covell stated before the second series' release that she does not intend to produce a third series for the programme.", "The first series covered the entirety of the storyline in Forsman's original comics. On 25 January 2018, Jonathan Entwistle spoke of the potential for a second series. He confirmed that \"We're exploring and we're seeing what we can do to expand the world and see where we get to.\" Entwistle then went on to say that Netflix was enthusiastic about a second series of the show if one could be conceived. Writer Charlie Covell said \"I think there are a number of stories we could tell\" and that she would \"love to write more\". Actor Alex Lawther stated in an interview that he would be \"very excited\" about a second series, as it would give Covell \"a chance to explore something from her imagination\".
