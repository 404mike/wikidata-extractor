Later historians have characterised the movement in a variety of ways, including as a revolutionary extension of anti-Court, ideology; an aristocratic reaction against a growth in executive power; feudalism in conflict with developing capitalism; or as a product of nationalist feeling in Scotland and Ireland. Establishing the ideology of active participants is complicated by the fact that \"by and large, those who wrote most did not act, and those who acted wrote little, if anything.\" "]}, {"page": "John, King of England", "response": ["John's lack of religious conviction has been noted by contemporary chroniclers and later historians, with some suspecting that he was at best impious, or even atheistic, a very serious issue at the time.McLynn, p. 290. Contemporary chroniclers catalogued his various anti-religious habits at length, including his failure to take communion, his blasphemous remarks, and his witty but scandalous jokes about church doctrine, including jokes about the implausibility of the Resurrection of Jesus. They commented on the paucity of John's charitable donations to the Church.McLynn, pp. 78, 290. Historian Frank McLynn argues that John's early years at Fontevrault, combined with his relatively advanced education, may have turned him against the church. Other historians have been more cautious in interpreting this material, noting that chroniclers also reported his personal interest in the life of St Wulfstan and his friendships with several senior clerics, most especially with Hugh of Lincoln, who was later declared a saint.Turner, p. 120. Financial records show a normal royal household engaged in the usual feasts and pious observances\u2014albeit with many records showing John's offerings to the poor to atone for routinely breaking church rules and guidance.Turner, p. 120; Carpenter (2004), p. 276. The historian Lewis Warren has argued that the chronicler accounts were subject to considerable bias and the King was \"at least conventionally devout\", citing his pilgrimages and interest in religious scripture and commentaries.Warren, pp.\u00a0171\u2013172.", "Most historians today, including John's recent biographers Ralph Turner and Lewis Warren, argue that John was an unsuccessful monarch, but note that his failings were exaggerated by 12th- and 13th-century chroniclers. Jim Bradbury notes the current consensus that John was a \"hard-working administrator, an able man, an able general\", albeit, as Turner suggests, with \"distasteful, even dangerous personality traits\", including pettiness, spitefulness and cruelty.Bradbury (2007), p. 353; Turner, p. 23. John Gillingham, author of a major biography of Richard I, follows this line too, although he considers John a less effective general than do Turner or Warren, and describes him \"one of the worst kings ever to rule England\".Gillingham (2001), p. 125. Bradbury takes a moderate line, but suggests that in recent years modern historians have been overly lenient towards John's numerous faults.Bradbury (2007), p. 361. Popular historian Frank McLynn maintains a counter-revisionist perspective on John, arguing that the King's modern reputation amongst historians is \"bizarre\", and that as a monarch John \"fails almost all those [tests] that can be legitimately set\".McLynn, pp. 472\u2013473. According to C. Warren Hollister, \"The dramatic ambivalence of his personality, the passions that he stirred among his own contemporaries, the very magnitude of his failures, have made him an object of endless fascination to historians and biographers.\"Hollister, p. 1."]}, {"page": "Western Europe", "response": ["* 1066: The Year of the Three Battles, , by Frank McLynn"]}, {"page": "Richard Francis Burton", "response": ["Brief selections from a variety of Burton's writings are available in Frank McLynn's Of No Country: An Anthology of Richard Burton (1990; New York: Charles Scribner's Sons)."]}, {"page": "Napoleon", "response": ["The Allied disaster at Austerlitz significantly shook the faith of Emperor Francis in the British-led war effort. France and Austria agreed to an armistice immediately and the Treaty of Pressburg followed shortly after on 26 December. Pressburg took Austria out of both the war and the Coalition while reinforcing the earlier treaties of Campo Formio and of Lun\u00e9ville between the two powers. The treaty confirmed the Austrian loss of lands to France in Italy and Bavaria, and lands in Germany to Napoleon's German allies. It also imposed an indemnity of 40\u00a0million francs on the defeated Habsburgs and allowed the fleeing Russian troops free passage through hostile territories and back to their home soil. Napoleon went on to say, \"The battle of Austerlitz is the finest of all I have fought\".Schom 1997, p. 414 Frank McLynn suggests that Napoleon was so successful at Austerlitz that he lost touch with reality, and what used to be French foreign policy became a \"personal Napoleonic one\". Vincent Cronin disagrees, stating that Napoleon was not overly ambitious for himself, \"he embodied the ambitions of thirty million Frenchmen\".Cronin 1994, p. 344"]}, {"page": "Treaty of Amiens", "response": ["Britain ended the uneasy truce created by the Treaty of Amiens when it declared war on France in May 1803.  The British were increasingly angered by Napoleon's re-ordering of the international system in Western Europe, especially in Switzerland, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands. Frederick Kagan argues that Britain was irritated in particular by Napoleon's assertion of control over Switzerland. Furthermore, Britons felt insulted when Napoleon stated that their country deserved no voice in European affairs, even though King George III was an elector of the Holy Roman Empire. For its part, Russia decided that the intervention in Switzerland indicated that Napoleon was not looking toward a peaceful resolution of his differences with the other European powers.Frederick Kagan, The End of the Old Order: Napoleon and Europe, 1801-1805 (2007) pp 42-43  Britain was labouring under a sense of loss of control, as well as loss of markets, and was worried by Napoleon's possible threat to its overseas colonies. Frank McLynn argues that Britain went to war in 1803 out of a \"mixture of economic motives and national neuroses \u2013 an irrational anxiety about Napoleon's motives and intentions.\"  However, it proved to be the right choice for Britain, because in the long run Napoleon\u2019s intentions were hostile to British national interests. Furthermore, Napoleon was not ready for war, and it was the best time for Britain to try to stop him.McLynn, Frank Napoleon: A Biography (1997) p.  69  Britain therefore seized upon the Malta issue by refusing to follow the terms of the Treaty of Amiens that required its evacuation of the island."]}, {"page": "St Antony's College, Oxford", "response": ["* Frank McLynn, historian and biographer"]}, {"page": "Scottish clan", "response": ["Highland involvement in the Jacobite risings was the result of their remoteness, and the feudal clan system which required tenants to provide military service.

Meanwhile, Emperor Frederick II, a well-educated ruler, wanted to annex Italy to unite his separated kingdoms of the Holy Roman Empire and Sicily. In addition to calling a council to depose the Holy Roman Emperor, Pope Gregory IX and his successor Innocent IV excommunicated Frederick four times and labeled him the Antichrist.Frank McLynn, Genghis Khan (2015); Chris Peers, the Mongol War Machine (2015); Timothy May, the Mongol Art of War (2016). pp. 448-51", "In the 1240s the efforts of Christendom were already divided between five Crusades, only one of which was aimed against the Mongols. Initially, when Bela sent messengers to the Pope to request a Crusade against the Mongols, the Pope tried to convince them to instead join his Crusade against the Holy Roman Emperor. Eventually Pope Gregory IX did promise a Crusade and the Church finally helped sanction a small Crusade against the Mongols in mid-1241, but it was diverted when he died in August 1241. Instead of fighting the Mongols, the resources gathered by the Crusade was used to fight a Crusade against the Hohenstaufen Dynasty after the German barons revolted against the Holy Roman Emperor's son Conrad in September 1241.Frank McLynn, Genghis Khan (2015); Chris Peers, the Mongol War Machine (2015); Timothy May, the Mongol Art of War (2016). pp. 450-1."]}, {"page": "Battle of Ramree Island", "response": ["Some British soldiers, including the naturalist Bruce Wright, who participated in the battle, claimed that the large population of saltwater crocodiles native to the mangrove swamps on Ramree Island preyed on the trapped Japanese force at night and ate many soldiers.

Several authors, like Marcus Aurelius' biographer Frank McLynn, accepting the date of defeat near Carnuntum as 170, place the great Germanic invasion itself three years earlier. They maintain it happened in 167 because by the year 170 the Germans would have been checked by the Praetentura Italiae et Alpium\u2014the fortifications which were erected in 168\u2013169 to block a breakthrough of the Alps to Northern Italy \u2013 whereas all sources confirm it to be a military walkover. A further argument is that the panic which gripped Rome in 167\u2013168 would make no sense if the Germanic tribes were still on the opposite side of the Danube. Also, no source mentions the emperor being near the front when the disaster occurred, whereas by 170 Marcus Aurelius had settled there. McLynn maintains that Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus went to Aquileia in 168 to restore morale after the disaster as Aquileia makes no geographical, logistical or military sense as a base of operations for launching a campaign on the Danube in Pannonia. The reason McLynn maintains that 170 is proposed by other authors is that too much weight is given to Lucian's testimony regarding the influence of Alexander of Abonoteichos as a scapegoat for the disaster whereas it is uncertain whether Alexander was still alive by 170 and Lucian's chronology is at certain points suspect."]}, {"page": "First Battle of Rellano", "response": ["*Frank McLynn, \"Villa and Zapata.
