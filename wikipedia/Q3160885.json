However, as L. N. Williams puts it, \"the term has never been satisfactorily defined\". Definitions have included stamps issued before 1900, although not all stamps issued before 1900 are considered \"classic\", while some stamps issued in the first few years after 1900 are considered \"classic.\"  Williams suggests that the classic period extends from 1840 to 1875, and James A. Mackay, in his World of Classic Stamps, New York (1972) applied the term to stamps produced from 1840 to 1870. Other collectors consider the classics cover regular issues to 1869, but include the re-issues of 1875.A Sharp Eye on collecting US Classics (Sharp Photography Publications, 2021) ASIN B091MBTGJ7 (read online) The U.S. Philatelic Classics Society (USPCS) is a society dedicated to the study of United States postal issues and postal history from the Stampless era up to 1893."]}, {"page": "James Mackay", "response": ["*James A.

The Custom House was burnt down in 1921 by the IRA during the War of Independence and parts of it were rebuilt using a darker shade of native limestone.Michael Collins: A Life by James A. Mackay (), page 199 The Four Courts was shelled by government forces during the Civil War in 1922 and partly destroyed by a huge explosion. Even though it was later rebuilt, much of Gandon's original work is gone and the interior can today only be appreciated from his original drawings. The wings to the Four Courts were shortened by one bay, in order to widen the roadway, and to permit more lanes of traffic. This alteration seriously damages the original composition.
