He is a former world, European and Commonwealth champion in the men's 50-metre breaststroke event, and now serves as the head swimming coach at the Energy Standard Swim Club.\n\nBorn in Chelmsford, Essex, and raised in Witham. He first started swimming at Witham Dolphins swimming club in Essex and is now the clubs lifelong president, Gibson's primary swimming stroke is the breaststroke and he competed in the 50-, 100- and 200-metre events. In 2003 he became world champion at 50 metres (long-course). He was 6th in the 100 metre event at the Athens Olympics in 2004. A year earlier, at the 2003 Summer Universiade, he won titles in both the 50- and 100-metre breaststroke.\nIn choosing three words to describe himself, Gibson has said, \"confidence, positive and pecs\", referring to his prodigious pectoral muscles. On a 2003 edition of the sports-comedy quiz show They Think It's All Over he admitted to rippling his chest muscles before races in order to \"freak out\" the opposition.\nHe was appointed MBE in the 2004 New Year's Honours. Gibson's club was Loughborough University where he was coached by Ben Titley. He is now a coach himself at the Energy Standard Swim Club primarily training in Turkey.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Witham", "response": ["*James Gibson, the 2003 World Breaststroke 50m (Long-course) Champion, was born in Chelmsford and lived in Witham."]}, {"page": "Chelmsford", "response": ["*James Gibson (born 1980), swimmer."]}, {"page": "Loughborough University", "response": ["As of 2007 there were 21 academic, 9 teaching and 6 support staff all working within the department of PHIR.
