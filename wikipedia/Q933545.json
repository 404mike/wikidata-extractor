He is most widely known as an early experimenter in the field of photography.\nHe is the first person known to have thought of creating permanent pictures by capturing camera images on material coated with a light-sensitive chemical. His practical experiments yielded only shadow image photograms that were not light-fast, but his conceptual breakthrough and partial success have led some historians to call him \"the first photographer\".", "link_mentions": {}}}
