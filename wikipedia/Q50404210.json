After careful inspection, she published an article declaring these \"Palmers\" to be fake. Norman was sent tips as to who forged these paintings, but it was not until Jane Kelly's brother met up with Norman and told her all about Keating, that she found out the truth. Soon after, she drove out to the house that Kelly's brother had told her about, and met Keating. Keating welcomed her inside and told her all about his life as a restorer and artist, not discussing his life as a forger. He also spent much of the time ranting about his fight against the art establishment as a working-class socialist. A little over a week after their meeting, The Times published an article written by Norman, writing about his life and the many allegations of forgery against him. In response, Keating wrote: \"I do not deny these allegations. In fact, I openly confess to having done them.\" He also declared that money was not his incentive. Though Norman was the one to expose him, Keating did not feel resentment towards her. Instead he said that she was sympathetic, respectful of his radical politics, and appreciative of him as an artist.", "* Tom Keating, Geraldine Norman and Frank Norman, The Fake's Progress: The Tom Keating Story, London: Hutchinson and Co., 1977."]}, {"page": "Frank Norman", "response": ["Norman's London reprinted a selection of Norman's early journalism, while Lock'em up and Count'em provides an appraisal of and a plan of reform for the British prison system.

It has been claimed that the work is not by van der Weyden or other artists working under his name in Early Netherlandish painting, but is instead a forgery by Eric Hebborn. According to an article published in The Independent by Geraldine Norman, in 1996 Hebborn claimed to have painted the National Gallery's Saint Ivo."]}]}}
