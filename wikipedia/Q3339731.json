This marked the end of their association with Hugh Padgham which had begun with Abacab (1981). Rutherford said the group decided to switch producers before work on the album had begun, and insisted they were pleased with Padgham's contributions, but felt it was the right time for a change after having done three albums with him (Hugh had also produced Collins's four solo albums throughout the 80's). Davis was keen to feature Rutherford's guitar more prominently as an instrument than previous Genesis albums, and felt his approach was successful on some of the tracks on We Can't Dance.

Banks had liked Wilson's vocals from listening to Stiltskin's first album, The Mind's Eye (1994). For his first audition, Wilson sang Genesis songs with Collins's vocals removed. At his second, he was asked to contribute vocal ideas to the new music that Banks and Rutherford had written, singing and humming ideas on the spot. Takes from this session were used by Banks to shape the verses to \"There Must Be Some Other Way\". In November 1996, Banks and Rutherford chose Wilson as the new lead singer.
