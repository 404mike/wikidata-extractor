Jackson (1870 \u2013 after 1893) was an English professional footballer who played in the Football League for Small Heath.Born in the Northfield district of Birmingham, Jackson played local football before joining Small Heath in September 1893. He made his debut in the Second Division on 9 December 1893, deputising at outside right for the injured Jack Hallam in a home game against Burton Swifts which Small Heath won 2\u20130. Once Hallam regained fitness, Jackson's first-team chances were limited, and he joined Worcester club Berwick Rangers at the end of the 1893\u201394 season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Walter Jackson", "response": ["Walter Jackson may refer to:", "* Walter Jackson (ice hockey)", "* Walter Jackson (footballer), English footballer", "* Walter Jackson (singer) (1938-1983), American soul music singer"]}, {"page": "1893\u201394 Small Heath F.C. season", "response": ["Of the regular first-team members from the previous season, goalkeeper Chris Charsley, a serving police officer, was unavailable and full back Tom Bayley had been released.Matthews, Complete Record, p. 71.

Fringe players Harry Edwards and Fred Jones had left the club,Matthews, Complete Record, pp. 85, 102. and Harry Morris had retired to concentrate on his plumbing business.

The half-backs were again the backbone of the team, and Wheldon, who produced \"a brilliant exposition of dodging and shooting\", scored the winning goal five minutes from time in what the Standard's reporter described as a \"rattling good game\". Fred Speller was reported to have \"not been seen in such form since his leg was broken last year\" in a Boxing Day friendly with top amateur club Marlow, the club from which he signed for Small Heath. Their last League match of 1893, a comfortable 6\u20130 victory against Lincoln City, took them into the new year in second place in the division, three points ahead of Notts County but two points behind Liverpool, who had played two fewer matches. Pumfrey strengthened the defence, George Hollis was as usual secure in goal, and the forwards, with the returning Mobley and the introduction of reserve-team player Walter Jackson, \"showed better combination and greater dash than they have recently done\".", "Fred Speller attempted a comeback, appearing twice for the first team early in the season, but the injury received against Darwen proved the end of his professional football career.Matthews, Complete Record, p. 126.
