It was presumed to have been one of the four awarded to the 8th Hussars, as they were based at the Curragh between 1869 and 1875 and until 1881 soldiers were required to wear all their medals while on duty. At the time, it was thought likely to have belonged to either George Hollis or John Pearson as the other two medals were accounted for; Pearson's collection of medals, including his VC, were subsequently sold at auction in 2004.Niall Fallon, 'A rare medal is unearthed on Curragh' in The Irish Times, 21 May 1994, p.22"]}, {"page": "Hollis (name)", "response": ["* George Hollis (1833\u20131879), British soldier and recipient of the Victoria Cross"]}, {"page": "Hollis, George", "response": ["#redirectGeorge Hollis"]}]}}
