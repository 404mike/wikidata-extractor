No matter what branch of the sport he turned to, road time trials, paced races on the track, road records or track records, he dominated his contemporaries. In addition to his speed, he had the personality that attracts the crowd, and any track meeting billing 'F.W.S.' versus, say, Harry Wyld (his great rival at the paced game) was certain of a packed house. Although he raced on almost every road course in this country, and competed in many events abroad... world's championships and Olympic Games... he was always at his best on his 'home ground', the Brighton Road, and his RRA record for the London to Brighton and back which he set up in 1935 (he covered the 104 hilly miles in 4h 38m 27s) still stands.The Bicycle, UK, 23 April 1941, p17"]}, {"page": "Lew Wyld", "response": ["On 5 August 1928 in Amsterdam, Lew Wyld, along with Frank Southall, Percy Wyld and Harry Wyld, broke the Team Pursuit Olympic Record in a time of 5:01.6, beating the previous record by 9.2 seconds.
