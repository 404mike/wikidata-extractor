It was situated in an area near to several other villas, and was close to Watling Street, a Roman road by which travellers could move to and from Londinium to Durobrivae, Durovernum Cantiacorum, and the major Roman port of Rutupi\u00e6 (i.e., London, Rochester, Canterbury, and Richborough, respectively).Lullingstone Roman Villa, Michael Fulford, page 18", "Rooms 12 and 13, previously known as Rooms 9 and 10 include the dining room, or triclinium, which was situated in the centre of the main building. As the largest room in the villa on the western side, it connected all other rooms to the north and south together via a large verandah.  The dining room was highly decorated with a pair of large mosaics on the floor dating to the mid-4th century.Lullingstone Roman Villa, Michael Fulford, page 14 One depicts the abduction of the princess Europa by the god Jupiter or Zeus who is disguised as a bull,Lullingstone Roman Villa, Michael Fulford, page 28 whilst the other depicts Bellerophon slaying the Chimera, whilst surrounded by four sea creatures, including dolphins. In each of the four corners of the Bellerophon mosaic there is a bust of the seasons personified including winter, spring, summer, and autumn.Surrounding these mosaics were smaller images depicting hearts, crosses and swastikas. Even though these artworks are usually only seen as depictions of myth, it is also thought by some scholars that these works were meant to ward off the Evil Eye. Based on the artwork and the shape of the apse, it is thought that this room was also meant for entertaining. With the measurements of the apse being 6.25 meters by 4.88 meters at its largest points, the dining room was spacious with room to potentially contain a couch. The couch, usually able to seat three people, would have been 1.50 meters to 2 meters in width, and directly facing the mosaic artwork so that it could be viewed in the correct orientation by all visitors.", "The original pagan shrine room was dedicated to local water deities, and a wall painting depicting three water nymphs dating from this period can still be seen in a niche in the room.Lullingstone Roman Villa, Michael Fulford, p. 8"]}, {"page": "Calleva Atrebatum", "response": ["Molly Cotton carried out excavations on the defences in 1938\u201339.Cotton, M.

Further clearing work took place under the supervision of the Ministry of Works in 1926 following the acquisition of the castle by the state. In 1936 Frank Cottrill carried out an eight-month excavation in the area of the outer bailey. B. W. Pearce excavated outside the Roman west gate in 1938 and cleared the moat of debris the following year. The Second World War ended any further work, and it was not until 1964 that limited exploration by Stuart Rigold took place outside the south-east postern of the inner bailey. In 1993\u201395, a team from the University of Reading led by Professor Michael Fulford carried out a series of excavations in the area of the keep and on the Roman fortress's east side.

He decided to pursue this interest and undertook a PhD entitled \"The Schlumberger array in archaeological prospection\", under one of Britain's pioneers of archaeological geophysical survey, Arnold Aspinall.
