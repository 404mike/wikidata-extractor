He described her as \"pretty enough, but the most excellent, mad-humoured thing, and sings the noblest that I ever heard in my life.\" He called her husband \"an ill, melancholy, jealous-looking fellow\"Pepys's Diary entry of 8 December 1665. and suspected him of abusing his wife. Knep provided Pepys with backstage access and was a conduit for theatrical and social gossip.
