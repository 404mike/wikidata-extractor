(27 April 1890 \u2013 21 March 1966) was a British army officer, School Head Master, and briefly a Conservative politician. First employed as a trainee accountant, he was given a commission when he enlisted in the first month of the First World War. He was wounded in action at Gallipoli and then served in senior staff officer roles. In civilian life he established a public school for the sons of Army Officers, and was elected to Parliament but lived well beyond his means and was made bankrupt \u2013 disclosing his highly dubious financial practices. He rebuilt his life again in the world of private education.\nVolunteering for service again in the Second World War, he was given an appointment organising Prisoner of War camps at the War Office where he ruffled feathers with other departments but played his role in ensuring the safety and survival of Rudolf Hess. He was dismissed as part of a major clear-out of his Directorate and subsequently convicted of a criminal offence; his disgrace meant that he disappeared from public life.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
