It was like everything I had said, everything I had been told by al-Qaeda. I was in no doubt. Same plan. Perhaps someone from the training camp was on board one of those planes. Perhaps, if I had not run away, I would have been there.\nKhan was interviewed by NBC News in 2004, on national TV.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa cricket team", "response": ["|Niaz Khan ||  || Right-handed || Right-arm medium ||"]}]}}
