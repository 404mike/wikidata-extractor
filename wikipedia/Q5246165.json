Almost a dozen other musicians were enlisted, including members of Tom Petty's Heartbreakers, guest harmonica from Stevie Wonder, bass guitar from Dean Garcia, string arrangements by Michael Kamen, and Lennox singing duets with Aretha Franklin and Elvis Costello. It continued the duo's transatlantic chart domination in 1985, and contained four hit singles: \"Would I Lie to You?\" was a US Billboard top five hit and Australian No. one, while \"There Must Be an Angel (Playing with My Heart)\" (featuring Wonder's harmonica contribution) became their first and only UK No. one single. The feminist anthem \"Sisters Are Doin' It for Themselves\" (a duet with Aretha Franklin, though originally intended for Tina Turner), and \"It's Alright (Baby's Coming Back)\" also rode high in the charts.
