With Horatio Davies, later owner of Pimm's and Lord Mayor of London he formed Messrs. Gordon and Company. Their first success came with the conversion in 1868 of the fifteenth-century Crosby Hall, Bishopsgate in the City of London into a fashionable eating place with an open layout in the vast Great Hall instead of the traditional boxes. Waitresses were employed, and there were facilities for women visitors. The King's Head in Fenchurch Street followed, also richly decorated. Gordon's wider fame began with his creation in 1874 of the Holborn Restaurant further west. The Holborn was expanded in 1879 and again in 1883\u20134. Illustrated brochures depicted a series of richly decorated saloons embellished with marble, fresco work and stained glass. A favourite venue for institutional dinners and parties, the Holborn survived until it was bombed in the Second World War.Robert Thorne, 'Nineteenth-Century Places of Refreshment', in Anthony D.
