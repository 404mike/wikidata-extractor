During extra time, Giggs picked up possession after Patrick Vieira gave the ball away, then ran from his own half, dribbled past the whole Arsenal back line, including Tony Adams, Lee Dixon and Martin Keown before launching his left-footed strike just under David Seaman's bar and beyond his reach. He famously whipped off his shirt during his goal celebration as he ran over to his teammates.

According to his teammate Martin Keown \"They couldn't work out why Rocastle was running around dribbling with his head down.

Arsenal won the \"double\" of Premiership and FA Cup in 1998. During the league campaign, in September 1997, as against Wimbledon in 1989, Winterburn again scored a vital goal from over 25 yards out driven diagonally into the far, top corner, this time with his favoured left foot.

During the season, Campbell was partnered at the back by either Tony Adams (who would retire at the end of the season) or Martin Keown. He made a return to White Hart Lane during a 1\u20131 draw on 17 November, and though he played well, he was shocked to see his older brother Tony in the crowd supporting Spurs as the fans shouted insults out to Campbell on the pitch. Campbell enjoyed immediate success with Arsenal, as he won both Premier League and FA Cup winners' medals as Arsenal won the Double in his first season at Highbury. In the FA Cup final at the Millennium Stadium on 4 May, he played alongside Adams as the team kept a clean sheet in a 2\u20130 victory over Chelsea.
