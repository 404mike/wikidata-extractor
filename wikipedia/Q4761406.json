In November 2013, Steve Burr walked out on Harriers to speak to Forest Green Rovers. The talks broke down and Burr returned to Harriers where the league form dipped rapidly. Harriers enjoyed a fine cup run beating League Two side Newport County in the second round and holding League One side Peterborough United 0\u20130 at aggborough in the third round. However, Burr did not get chance to see the replay as a heavy 6\u20130 defeat away to Luton Town saw him sacked as Harriers manager on 7 January 2014.

The summer of 1988 brought McFaul's biggest challenge as manager of Newcastle United, as key players Paul Gascoigne, Neil McDonald and Paul Goddard were sold for a combined fee of \u00a33.7M, to the dismay of the Toon Army.

At Palace he continued his consistently reliable form, and the club had already signed Thorn in 1989 which meant the resumption of their defensive partnership that had proved so successful at Wimbledon. Young was a mainstay in the team that finished third in the old first division (now the Premiership) and kept his place in the side until a  falling out with manager Alan Smith at the beginning of the 1994\u201395 season saw him dropped until the final five matches of that campaign."]}]}}
