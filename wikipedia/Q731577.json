It was invented in 1874 by Herbert McLeod (1841\u20131923). McLeod gauges were once commonly found attached to equipment that operates under vacuum, such as a lyophilizer. Today, however, these gauges have largely been replaced by electronic vacuum gauges."]}, {"page": "The Royal Panopticon of Science and Art", "response": ["Visitors of the Royal Panopticon of Science and Art could view changing exhibits, including vacuum flasks, a pin making machine and a cook stove. Visitors engaged in intellectual improvement as a leisure activity, while at the same time a competitive entertainment industry emerged in London. According to The Athenaeum the Royal Panopticon of Science and Art was the most \"delightful lounge in London\" which exhibited music, large fountains, interesting experiments and provided opportunities for shopping. Scientists that practiced at the Royal Panopticon of Science and Art also taught interested students. For example, George Frederick Ansell taught chemistry at the Royal Panopticon and his student Herbert McLeod went on to study at the Royal College of Chemistry."]}, {"page": "Royal Indian Engineering College", "response": ["*Herbert McLeod, Professor of Chemistry"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society M, N, O", "response": ["| Herbert McLeod||02/06/1881||20 February 1841 \u2013 1 October 1923 Chemist, Royal Indian Eng.Coll."]}, {"page": "Alexander Pedler", "response": ["Pedler was the son of George Standbury, a pharmacist on Fleet Street, and Hannah Rideal. He was privately schooled  and  educated at the City of London School. With a Bell scholarship he studied at the laboratory of the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain from 1866. He worked as a chemical assistant at the Royal Institution, working with Herbert McLeod, Edward Frankland, and Norman Lockyer. He worked with Lockyer examining the spectra from solar prominences in Sicily when the latter discovered helium on the earth in 1868. He also was involved in studies on chiral isomers of valeric acid with Frankland. In 1869 he visited America and on return he was a chemical examiner at the Department of Science and Art at the Royal College of Chemistry. He became a Fellow of the Chemical Society in 1870. After Herbert McLeod moved to the newly established Royal Indian Engineering College, Coopers Hill, Pedler succeeded him. On the recommendation of Edward Frankland he was offered a chair of chemistry at the Presidency College in Calcutta."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1881", "response": ["# Herbert McLeod (1841\u20131923)"]}, {"page": "Edmund James Mills", "response": ["He was born in London on 8 December 1840.
