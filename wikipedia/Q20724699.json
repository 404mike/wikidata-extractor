He was abandoned by his father when he was a child and had to steal to survive. In Season 1, he is initially at odds with Jon Snow, especially after Jon breaks his nose during a training session. Grenn, Pypar and Rast ambush Jon in a shed and threaten to harm him until Tyrion appears and tells them to back off, while advising Jon to sympathise with the other brothers. Jon makes amends by helping to train the others and becomes friends with Grenn. In Season 2, Grenn is part of Lord Commander Joer Mormont's ranging mission. Once they reach the Fist of the First Men, he is ordered to find firewood with Eddison Tollet and Samwell Tarly. In the process, they find a hidden stash of dragonglass (obsidian) daggers. When the White Walkers and wights approach, Grenn and Edd make a run for it, accidentally leaving Sam behind. In Season 3, he is one of the few remaining survivors of the battle at the Fist of the First men. On the way back to the Wall, Grenn makes amends with Sam by helping him walk along with Edd and Rast, and they manage to retreat to Craster's Keep. He fights against the mutineers after the death of Lord Commander Mormont, tackling Karl Tanner in the process, but he is subdued and chained up. In season 4, he and Edd manage to escape from the keep and make it back to Castle Black, but they later join Jon Snow on his mission to kill the mutineers. He survives the ensuing battle and expresses shock at the sight of Locke's badly snapped neck, wondering aloud what killed him. In the wildling attack on Castle Black, Grenn is ordered by Jon to take five men and hold the castle gates. A giant breaks his way in, and Grenn and the others manage to kill it at the cost of their own lives.

For the unsuspecting Ines, it is the moment of truth: Emilie reveals to her that she has cancer, has been undergoing unsuccessful treatment for three years, and has therefore chosen assisted suicide; the place to which she has taken her is actually an exclusive clinic where patients can spend their last six days in complete peace before taking their own lives by poisoning themselves after a simple ritual. Ines is distraught and cannot accept that Emilie has kept everything from her, but her sister bitterly claims that she did it because it was the only way she could accompany her on her final journey. In fact, during their stay, the two will repeatedly confront each other harshly about their conflicting life choices: Emilie has remained close to her mother, who fell into depression because of her separation from her husband, until her suicide; Ines soon distanced herself from her, accused her of weakness and victimhood, and did not even go to the funeral, building a nice career as an excuse for her constant absence and creating a kind of armour of rationality and self-preservation. At the clinic, the two women not only meet but also the charming Mr Daren (Charles Dance), also terminally ill, a wealthy playboy who is now an old man and organises a party on his last night, and Brian (Mark Stanley), a former footballer who has been paralysed and rendered impotent by a car accident and who, attracted to Emilie, spends a night with her, arousing her anger that he has decided to leave life behind despite his health. Marina also reveals a little about herself, saying that she stayed at the clinic after accompanying her dying husband there two years earlier because she \"couldn't find a reason to leave\". Ines feels a mixture of disgust and attraction for the place and takes some photos with Daren's complicity for personal inspiration, even though she knows it is forbidden by the rules. At the height of another argument with her sister, she decides to leave early, but Marina stops her with a ruse and listens to her outburst, which turns from a blind rage against her mother and sister to a desolate lament for her growing sense of abandonment. Finally ready to face her pain, Ines makes peace with Emilie, who is now dying, shares fond childhood memories with her and prepares her for suicide.", "* Mark Stanley as Brian", "On 6 May 2016 it was announced that Alicia Vikander and her London-based agent Charles Collier had launched Vikarious Productions.
