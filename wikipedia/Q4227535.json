This suggests that the enormously long Marxist debate about the relationship between product-values and product-prices was, in a sense, unwarranted; overall, the differences between average product-prices and the underlying product-values are, as far as can be established, just not very great.\"The crosssectional variations in the calculated prices of production are entirely dominated by the corresponding variations in relative values, with between 87% and 92% of the former being explained by the latter.\" - Anwar Shaikh, \"The Transformation from Marx to Sraffa\", in: Ernest Mandel & Alan Freeman, Ricardo, Marx, Sraffa.

And if the price/value differences are not very great, then Marx was quite justified in mostly disregarding them in Capital, Volume I and Capital, Volume II. Had Marxists been able to  measure price-value relationships of products empirically, earlier on in the controversy, they might not have given the issue so much weight; but the econometric techniques to do it were perfected only from the 1980s onward.
