The sport of cricket had acquired most of its modern features by this time and the period saw the establishment of roundarm bowling as an accepted practise.\nCounty cricket clubs began to become more formally established during this period and Sussex County Cricket Club, the oldest professional sporting organisation in the world, was formerly established in 1839. This would soon be followed by formal organisations in other counties, although the County Championship was not formally established until 1890.\nThe players included are those known to have played in matches which were given retrospective first-class status between 1726 and 1840 inclusive.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wood (disambiguation)", "response": ["Wood is a natural material produced by the growth of plants, mainly trees and shrubs.", "Wood may also refer to:", "* Wood, Iowa, an unincorporated community", "* Wood, Missouri, an unincorporated community", "* Wood, North Carolina, an unincorporated community", "* Wood, Pennsylvania, an unincorporated community", "* Wood, South Dakota, a town", "* Wood County, Texas", "* Wood, West Virginia, an unincorporated community", "* Wood, Wisconsin, a town ", "* Wood County, Ohio", "* Wood County, West Virginia", "* Wood County, Wisconsin", "* Wood Creek (Mohawk River), in West Schuyler, New York, U.S.", "* The Wood, New Zealand, a suburb of Nelson, South Island, New Zealand", "* The Wood, Surbiton, a public park in Kingston upon Thames, London, England", "* List of people with surname Wood", "* Wood (surname)", "* Wood (Kent cricketer, 1789), an English cricketer", "* Wood (Kent cricketer, 1828), an English cricketer", "* Wood Boulden (1811\u20131876)", "* Wood B.
