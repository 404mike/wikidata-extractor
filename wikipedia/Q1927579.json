Having until then recorded mostly acoustic music, Dylan used rock musicians as his backing band on every track of the album, except for the closing track, the 11-minute ballad \"Desolation Row\". Critics have focused on the innovative way Dylan combined driving, blues-based music with the subtlety of poetry to create songs that captured the political and cultural chaos of contemporary America. Author Michael Gray has argued that, in an important sense, the 1960s \"started\" with this album.", "Dylan has stated that he had to overcome considerable resistance at Columbia Records to give the album its title. He told biographer Robert Shelton: \"I wanted to call that album Highway 61 Revisited. Nobody understood it. I had to go up the fucking ladder until finally the word came down and said: 'Let him call it what he wants to call it'.\" Michael Gray has suggested that the very title of the album represents Dylan's insistence that his songs are rooted in the traditions of the blues: \"Indeed the album title Highway 61 Revisited announces that we are in for a long revisit, since it is such a long, blues-travelled highway. Many bluesmen had been there before [Dylan], all recording versions of a blues called 'Highway 61'.\"", "Highway 61 Revisited opens with \"Like a Rolling Stone\", which has been described as revolutionary in its combination of electric guitar licks, organ chords, and Dylan's voice, \"at once so young and so snarling\u00a0... and so cynical\". Michael Gray characterized \"Like a Rolling Stone\" as \"a chaotic amalgam of blues, impressionism, allegory, and an intense directness: 'How does it feel?'\" Polizzotti writes that the composition is notable for eschewing traditional themes of popular music, such as romance, and instead expresses resentment and a yearning for revenge. It has been suggested that Miss Lonely, the song's central character, is based on Edie Sedgwick, a socialite and actress in the Factory scene of pop artist Andy Warhol. Critic Mike Marqusee has written that this composition is \"surely a Dylan cameo\", and that its full poignancy becomes apparent upon the realization that \"it is sung, at least in part, to the singer himself: he's the one 'with no direction home'.\" \"Like A Rolling Stone\" reached number\u00a0two in the Billboard Hot 100 in the summer of 1965, and was a top-10 hit in Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.", "Highway 61 Revisited has remained among the most highly acclaimed of Dylan's works. Biographer Anthony Scaduto praises its rich imagery, and describes it as \"one of the most brilliant pop records ever made. As rock, it cuts through to the core of the music\u2014a hard driving beat without frills, without self-consciousness.\" Michael Gray calls Highway 61 \"revolutionary and stunning, not just for its energy and panache but in its vision: fusing radical, electrical music\u00a0... with lyrics that were light years ahead of anyone else's; Dylan here unites the force of blues-based rock'n'roll with the power of poetry. The whole rock culture, the whole post-Beatle pop-rock world, and so in an important sense the 1960s started here.\" In the opinion of PopMatters critic Hank Kalet, the album was the most \"electrifying\" rock and roll record ever and \"one of a handful of albums (including the Beatles' Rubber Soul and Revolver) that gave literate rockers the green light to create a kind of intelligent, probing rock music that had not existed before\". \"This seminal folk-rock classic\" showcased \"Dylan's seething, not-quite-out-of-control vocal delivery and a rough-and-tumble instrumental attack\", as well as his \"transformation from a folk singer to a rock and roller\", Sam Sutherland wrote in High Fidelity. Music journalist Gary Graff points to Highway 61 Revisited, along with Dylan's next album Blonde on Blonde (1966) and the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds (1966), as possible starting points to the album era, as they each constituted \"a cohesive and conceptual body of work rather than just some hit singles ... with filler tracks.\""]}, {"page": "Blonde on Blonde", "response": ["Most accounts of recording Blonde on Blonde, including those by Dylan scholars Clinton Heylin and Michael Gray, agree that there were two blocks of recording sessions: February 14\u201317 and March 8\u201310, 1966. This chronology is based on the logs and files kept by Columbia Records.The booklet accompanying The Original Mono Recordings re-issue of Blonde on Blonde gives recording dates for each track of the double album, confirming the Nashville recording sessions were in two blocks ().", "Al Kooper, who played keyboards on every track of Blonde on Blonde, has contested the conventional account that there were two blocks of recording sessions in Nashville. In comments on Michael Gray's website, Kooper wrote: \"There was only ONE trip to Nashville for Robbie and I, and ALL THE TRACKS were cut in that one visit\", stating that Dylan merely broke for an outstanding concert. Charlie McCoy agreed with Kooper's version. Wilentz analyzed the recording of Blonde on Blonde in his book Bob Dylan in America, concluding that the \"official\" documented version fits Dylan's known touring schedule, and notes that five of the eight songs first recorded after \"Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again\", but none of those recorded earlier, include a middle-eight section\u2014Dylan's first extensive foray as a writer into that conventional structure\".", "Following the good-time fun of \"Rainy Day Women No. 12 & 35\", the Chicago blues-influenced \"Pledging My Time\" sets the album's somber tone. It draws on several traditional blues songs, including Elmore James's recording of \"It Hurts Me Too\". For critic Michael Gray, the lines \"Somebody got lucky but it was an accident\" echo the lines \"Some joker got lucky, stole her back again\" from Robert Johnson's \"Come On in My Kitchen\", which is itself an echo of Skip James's 1931 recording \"Devil Got My Woman\". Gray suggests that \"the gulping movements of the melodic phrases\" derive from the melody of \"Sitting on Top of the World\", recorded by the Mississippi Sheiks in 1930. The couplet at the end of each verse expresses the theme: a pledge made to a prospective lover in hopes she \"will come through, too\". Besides Dylan's vocals and improvised harmonica breaks, the song's sound is defined by Robbie Robertson's guitar, Hargus \"Pig\" Robbins' blues piano and Ken Buttrey's snare drum rolls. The song was released in edited form as the B-side of \"Rainy Day Women No. 12 & 35\" in March.", "May 16, 1966 was commonly noted as the album's official release date. Michael Gray, author of The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia, contended that the release date was actually around late June or early July. This coincides with the album's promotion in Billboard, which carried a full-page Columbia advertisement on June 25, selected the album as a \"New Action LP\" on July 9, and ran a review and article on July 16. In 2017, after viewing a Sony database of album releases, Heylin found that the release date was in fact June 20, 1966. This is supported by the fact that an overdub on \"Fourth Time Around\" was recorded in June.", "Dylan scholar Michael Gray wrote: \"To have followed up one masterpiece with another was Dylan's history making achievement here\u00a0... Where Highway 61 Revisited has Dylan exposing and confronting like a laser beam in surgery, descending from outside the sickness, Blonde on Blonde offers a persona awash inside the chaos\u00a0... We're tossed from song to song\u00a0... The feel and the music are on a grand scale, and the language and delivery are a unique mixture of the visionary and the colloquial.\" Critic Tim Riley wrote: \"A sprawling abstraction of eccentric blues revisionism, Blonde on Blonde confirms Dylan's stature as the greatest American rock presence since Elvis Presley.\" Biographer Robert Shelton saw the album as \"a hallmark collection that completes his first major rock cycle, which began with Bringing It All Back Home\". Summing up the album's achievement, Shelton wrote that Blonde on Blonde \"begins with a joke and ends with a hymn; in between wit alternates with a dominant theme of entrapment by circumstances, love, society, and unrealized hope\u00a0... There's a remarkable marriage of funky, bluesy rock expressionism, and Rimbaud-like visions of discontinuity, chaos, emptiness, loss, being 'stuck'.\""]}, {"page": "All Along the Watchtower", "response": ["A live recording of \"All Along the Watchtower\" from the album Before the Flood appeared as the B side of \"Most Likely You Go Your Way (And I'll Go Mine)\" in 1974.

It has been suggested that Sedgwick is the basis of the Miss Lonely character. Sedgwick was briefly involved with Dylan in late 1965 and early 1966, around which time there was some discussion of the two making a movie together.

The track \"Most of the Time\", a lost love composition, was later prominently featured in the film High Fidelity, while \"What Was It You Wanted?\" has been interpreted both as a catechism and a wry comment on the expectations of critics and fans.Ricks, pp. 413\u2013420. The religious imagery of \"Ring Them Bells\" struck some critics as a re-affirmation of faith.Scott Marshall wrote: \"When Dylan sings that 'The sun is going down upon the sacred cow', it's safe to assume that the sacred cow here is the biblical metaphor for all false gods. For Dylan, the world will eventually know that there is only one God.\" Marshall, Restless Pilgrim, p. 103.", "The Bootleg Series Vol. 8\u00a0\u2013 Tell Tale Signs was released in October 2008, as both a two-CD set and a three-CD version with a 150-page hardcover book.

The pricing of the album\u2014the two-CD set went on sale for $18.99 and the three-CD version for $129.99\u2014led to complaints about \"rip-off packaging\" from some fans and commentators.Michael Gray expressed his opinion in his Bob Dylan Encyclopedia blog  The release was widely acclaimed by critics. The abundance of alternative takes and unreleased material suggested to one reviewer that this volume of old outtakes \"feels like a new Bob Dylan record, not only for the astonishing freshness of the material, but also for the incredible sound quality and organic feeling of everything here\".", "On April 12, 2011, Legacy Recordings released Bob Dylan in Concert\u00a0\u2013 Brandeis University 1963, taped at Brandeis University on May 10, 1963, two weeks before the release of The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan. The tape was discovered in the archive of music writer Ralph J. Gleason, and the recording carries liner notes by Michael Gray, who says it captures Dylan \"from way back when Kennedy was President and the Beatles hadn't yet reached America. It reveals him not at any Big Moment but giving a performance like his folk club sets of the period ... This is the last live performance we have of Bob Dylan before he becomes a star\".", "Dylan's voice also received critical attention. Robert Shelton described his early vocal style as \"a rusty voice suggesting Guthrie's old performances, etched in gravel like Dave Van Ronk's\".Shelton, pp. 108\u2013111. David Bowie, in his tribute, \"Song for Bob Dylan\", described Dylan's singing as \"a voice like sand and glue\". His voice continued to develop as he began to work with rock'n'roll backing bands; critic Michael Gray described the sound of Dylan's vocal work on \"Like a Rolling Stone\" as \"at once young and jeeringly cynical\".Gray (2006), p. 413. As Dylan's voice aged during the 1980s, for some critics, it became more expressive. Christophe Lebold writes in the journal Oral Tradition: \"Dylan's more recent broken voice enables him to present a world view at the sonic surface of the songs\u2014this voice carries us across the landscape of a broken, fallen world. The anatomy of a broken world in 'Everything is Broken' (on the album Oh Mercy) is but an example of how the thematic concern with all things broken is grounded in a concrete sonic reality.\""]}, {"page": "The Times They Are a-Changin' (song)", "response": ["Critic Michael Gray called it \"the archetypal protest song.\" Gray commented, \"Dylan's aim was to ride upon the unvoiced sentiment of a mass public\u2014to give that inchoate sentiment an anthem and give its clamour an outlet. He succeeded, but the language of the song is nevertheless imprecisely and very generally directed.\" Gray suggested that the song has been made obsolete by the very changes that it predicted and hence was politically out of date almost as soon as it was written."]}, {"page": "Kate McTell", "response": ["Ruthy (later changed to Ruth) Kate Williams  was born in Savannah, Georgia. She was singing for a high-school ceremony in Augusta, Georgia, in 1933 when she was noticed by McTell, who regularly performed in the area. In an interview conducted by the musicologist David Evans and his family, she stated that she and Willie met at a Christmas concert at her school in 1931.Gray (2007). p. 230. She went on to explain that Willie invited her to record with him, that they did so in Atlanta over the course of a week, and that she then returned to Augusta to continue her schooling at Paine College. According to Michael Gray, that week of recording would have been in February 1932. The McTells were married on January 11, 1934. For the next six years she often accompanied Willie on stage, singing or dancing, in performances in Chicago, Atlanta and elsewhere, and in the company of artists such as Louis Armstrong and Bessie Smith. The two were invited to record for Decca Records by executive Mayo Williams in 1935, but the recordings from these sessions had extremely limited releases.

Author Michael Gray has commented that although the vitriol Dylan unleashes towards his targets is similar to his earlier political protest songs, \"It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)\" is a transitional song in that it does not express optimism in the possibility of political solutions. Instead, Dylan sings in a new prophetic voice that would become his trademark. However, with the political pessimism comes a more poetic vision than in his earlier protest songs, along with a more complex figurative language. Howard Sounes notes that the song features some of Dylan's most memorable images.

The cover photograph for the 1975 album was taken by designer and photographer Reid Miles in the basement of a Los Angeles YMCA. It poses Dylan and the Band alongside characters suggested by the songs: a woman in a Mrs. Henry T-shirt, an Eskimo, a circus strongman and a dwarf  who has been identified as Angelo Rossitto. Robertson wears a blue Mao-style suit, and Manuel wears an RAF flight lieutenant uniform. Michael Gray has identified musicians David Blue and Neil Young in the photograph.  The identification of Young has been disputed by Bill Scheele who has written that Young was not present. Bill Scheele and his brother John Scheele worked with the Band from 1969 until 1976 and were present in the cover photo.

In his book about the basement sessions, Greil Marcus describes the album's contents as \"sixteen basement recordings plus eight Band demos\". Critic Michael Gray writes of the album, \"The interspersed tracks by the Band alone merely disrupt the unity of Dylan material, much more of which should have been included. Key songs missing here include 'I Shall Be Released' and 'The Mighty Quinn. Heylin similarly argues that compiler Robbie Robertson did Dylan fans \"a major disservice\" by omitting those two songs as well as \"I'm Not There\" and \"Sign On The Cross\". He writes, \"The album as released hardly gave a real idea of what they had been doing in Woodstock. Not even the two traditional songs pulled to the master reels\u2014'Young But Daily Growin' and 'The Banks Of The Royal Canal'\u2014made the final twenty-four cuts.\" Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker, on the other hand, said of the 1975 release that, in comparison to the complete recordings released in 2011, \"Robertson, with some exceptions, knew which the good songs were\" and was right to clean up the recordings.", "Although The Basement Tapes reached the public in an unorthodox manner, officially released eight years after the songs were recorded, critics have assigned them an important place in Dylan's development. Michael Gray writes, \"The core Dylan songs from these sessions actually do form a clear link between... two utterly different albums. They evince the same highly serious, precarious quest for a personal and universal salvation which marked out the John Wesley Harding collection\u2014yet they are soaked in the same blocked confusion and turmoil as Blonde on Blonde.

Gray sees Dylan's line \"I'm looking up into the sapphire-tinted skies\" as an allusion to Shelley's phrase \"sapphire-tinted skies\" in line 71 of \"Written among the Euganean Hills, North Italy\". \"Forty Miles of Bad Road\" was a 1959 instrumental hit for Duane Eddy.
