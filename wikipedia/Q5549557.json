Lambert had moved on, to be replaced as producer by John Wiles, who did not have a good working relationship with Hartnell. The lead actor himself was finding it increasingly difficult to remember his lines as he was suffering from the early stages of the arteriosclerosis that would later cause his death. Wiles and Tosh came up with a way of writing Hartnell out in the story The Celestial Toymaker, by having the Doctor made invisible for part of the story, intending that when he re-appeared he would be played by a new actor. However, Wiles was forbidden to replace Hartnell by the new Head of Serials, Gerald Savory. Wiles had also hoped to make other bold changes, such as introducing a companion with a cockney accent (which was vetoed, as he was told all characters must speak \"BBC English\"), and resigned shortly afterwards (allegedly after learning that he would be sacked at the end of the season), with Tosh also resigning on principle."]}, {"page": "Mapp and Lucia (series)", "response": ["The recipe was never revealed, but, in the manner of Mrs Beeton, began with the words \"Take two hen lobsters ...\" It took its name from the village of Riseholme, where Lucia lived before moving to Tilling, although the dish did not appear in either of the two novels set while Lucia was at Riseholme. thumb|290px|right|Tilling (Rye), where Lucia served Lobster \u00e0 la Riseholme Lucia first serves Lobster \u00e0 la Riseholme in Tilling to her friend George (\"Georgie\") Pillson in Mapp and Lucia (1931) to cheer him up after he discovers that his housemaid Foljambe intends to marry.

Lucia discovers her in the act, but before excuses can be given, the sea wall breaks and Lucia and Elizabeth are swept away on the flood, clinging to the kitchen table. They languish for some weeks on an Italian fishing vessel on the Gallagher Bank, eventually returning to Tilling, where Elizabeth discovers that the recipe has survived the ordeal.

Simon McCallum of the BFI said \"it just wasn't known that this film existed other than to a few specialist researchers\", and the production \"is a milestone\" in gay cultural history. The curators were stunned to find it, because the 1961 film Victim, with Dirk Bogarde was generally considered the milestone for gay representation on film and TV, but with this discovery, South now becomes the earliest known British gay TV play. Peter Wyngarde who played the lead character was a closeted gay at the time, but it was well-known in the acting world that he was gay.  McCallum said \"you have to give Wyngarde a massive pat on the back in terms of the bravery in taking this role. There were quite bad reactions from some of the press.\" Julien Green who wrote the original play the film is based on, was also gay.
