He spent much of his early senior career on loan to Ross County and St Mirren. While on loan to St Mirren during the 2005\u201306 season, Adam was part of the team that won both the Scottish Challenge Cup and First Division, playing in over thirty matches for the Saints. Upon returning to Rangers at the end of the 2006 season, he became a regular under managers Paul Le Guen and Walter Smith. Adam was also part of the Rangers team that reached the 2008 UEFA Cup Final.\nAfter falling out of favour at Rangers during 2008\u201309, Adam was loaned out to English Championship side Blackpool. The loan was made permanent at the start of the 2009\u201310 season, and Adam became an integral part of the Blackpool side, captaining the team to a play-off victory over Cardiff City which resulted in their promotion to the Premier League. Adam shone in his first season in the Premier League, his performances being recognised with a nomination for the PFA Players' Player of the Year in April 2011; however, Blackpool were relegated the following month, and he transferred to Liverpool in July.\nAfter one season at Anfield, Adam joined Stoke City in August 2012 for a fee of \u00a34 million.
