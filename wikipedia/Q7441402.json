The two men are London DJ Sean Rowley and album sleeve designer Brian Cannon (back to the camera).  The album's producer Owen Morris can be seen in the background, on the left footpath, holding the album's master tape in front of his face.

Sue James of Record Mirror listed it among her favourite albums of 1973. Among retrospective reviews, Sharon Mawer of AllMusic also criticised \"Ooh Baby,\" which she felt lacked \"any sort of melody and lyrical ingenuity,\" and also felt the Stevie Wonder-influenced tracks were poor because \"O'Sullivan did not have Wonder's voice, and this type of song really didn't suit him.\" She did however praise the record's ballads, and wrote that \"Get Down\" was the best track on the album, before noting \"O'Sullivan would never again hit these heights.\" Tom Ewing of Freaky Trigger called \"Get Down\" a \"rumbustious thing,\" praising the \"chiming piano hits on the chorus\" though deriding the \"dog/girl metaphor which Sullivan doesn\u2019t take anywhere.\" The song has featured on Sean Rowley's Guilty Pleasures compilation series, which aims to play music that has been considered guilty pleasures over time but which he believes should be guilt-free."]}, {"page": "Pinball (song)", "response": ["The song has received critical acclaim. Upon release, Reading Evening Posts Pete Butterfield called \"Pinball\" \"one of the most interesting singles of the year\" while Max Bell of New Musical Express praised the song's production and its \"instant, stylised commercialism\".

The song provided the inspiration for the track \"Riverman\" from Noel Gallagher's 2015 album Chasing Yesterday. Gallagher had been introduced to the song by Morrissey in a Los Angeles bar.

Fans of Oasis would regularly hang out outside the residence and the house became notorious locally for raucous parties. Gallagher described the house at this time as like a \"bad advert for drugs if you went inside it\". Gallagher's wife at this time, Meg Matthews, remembered one of the members of the band The Charlatans falling down the house's limestone staircase and breaking his leg. The supermodel Kate Moss lived at the house for several weeks. Sean Rowley interviewed Gallagher at the house for his BBC Radio programme, \"All Back to Mine\", that was broadcast on Christmas Day in 1997. Gallagher had soundproofing put in the house which led his neighbour Bob Hoskins to describe him as the \"quietest neighbour in Europe\"."]}]}}
