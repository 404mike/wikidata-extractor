The family was mostly from Italy, of Sephardic Jewish, mercantile background with some Italian-Jewish, and Ashkenazi origins.Wolf, Lucien. 1905. The Disraeli Family, \"Transactions of the Jewish Historical Society of England\", vol. 5, pp. 202\u2013218. Of these surnames, Shiprut de Gabay, Cardoso, Aboab, and, most likely, Israeli are Sephardic, Basevi is of Ashkenazic origin, while Rieti was originally taken by a family whose ancestors lived in Italy for centuries; see Beider, Alexander.  Pseudo-Sephardic Surnames from Italy. \"Avotaynu: The International Review of Jewish Genealogy,\" vol. XXXIII, Number 3, Fall 2017, pp. 3\u20138 (see pp. 5\u20136). Disraeli later romanticised his origins, claiming his father's family was of grand Iberian and Venetian descent; in fact Isaac's family was of no great distinction,Blake (1967), p. 6 but on Disraeli's mother's side, in which he took no interest, there were some distinguished forebears, including the Rothschilds and Isaac Cardoso.Wolf, Lucien. \"The Disraeli Family\", The Times, 21 December 1904, p. 12 Historians differ on Disraeli's motives for rewriting his family history: Bernard Glassman argues that it was intended to give him status comparable to that of England's ruling elite;Glassman, p. 32 Sarah Bradford believes \"his dislike of the commonplace would not allow him to accept the facts of his birth as being as middle-class and undramatic as they really were\".Bradford, p. 1", "Isaac D'Israeli had never taken religion very seriously, but had remained a conforming member of the Bevis Marks Synagogue. His father, the elder Benjamin, was a prominent and devout member; it was probably from respect for him that Isaac did not leave when he fell out with the synagogue authorities in 1813. After Benjamin senior died in 1816 Isaac felt free to leave the congregation following a second dispute.Blake (1967), p. 11 Isaac's friend Sharon Turner, a solicitor, convinced him that although he could comfortably remain unattached to any formal religion it would be disadvantageous to the children if they did so. Turner stood as godfather when Benjamin was baptised, aged twelve, on 31 July 1817.", "Conversion to Christianity enabled Disraeli to contemplate a career in politics. Britain in the early-nineteenth century was not a greatly anti-Semitic society, and there had been Members of Parliament (MPs) from Jewish families since Samson Gideon in 1770. But until Jews Relief Act 1858, MPs were required to take the oath of allegiance \"on the true faith of a Christian\", necessitating at least nominal conversion.Blake (1967), p. 10 It is not known whether Disraeli formed any ambition for a parliamentary career at the time of his baptism, but there is no doubt that he bitterly regretted his parents' decision not to send him to Winchester College.Bradford, p. 8 As one of the great public schools of England, Winchester consistently provided recruits to the political elite.Richmond and Smith, p. 23 His two younger brothers were sent there, and it is not clear why Isaac D'Israeli chose to send his eldest son to a much less prestigious school.Glassman, p. 38 The boy evidently held his mother responsible for the decision; Bradford speculates that \"Benjamin's delicate health and his obviously Jewish appearance may have had something to do with it.\" The school chosen for him was run by Eliezer Cogan at Higham Hill in Walthamstow. He began there in the autumn term of 1817; he later recalled his education:", "As he had in government posts, Disraeli rewarded old friends with clerical positions, making Sydney Turner, son of a good friend of Isaac D'Israeli, Dean of Ripon.Blake (1967), pp. 686\u2013687 He favoured Low church clergymen in promotion, disliking other movements in Anglicanism for political reasons. In this, he came into disagreement with the Queen, who out of loyalty to her late husband, Albert, Prince Consort, preferred Broad church teachings. One controversial appointment had occurred shortly before the 1868 election. When the position of Archbishop of Canterbury fell vacant, Disraeli reluctantly agreed to the Queen's preferred candidate, Archibald Tait, the Bishop of London. To fill Tait's vacant see, Disraeli was urged by many people to appoint Samuel Wilberforce, the former Bishop of Winchester and leading figure in London society. Disraeli disliked Wilberforce and instead appointed John Jackson, the Bishop of Lincoln. Blake suggested that, on balance, these appointments cost Disraeli more votes than they gained him.Blake (1967), pp. 509\u2013511"]}, {"page": "Edward Bulwer-Lytton", "response": ["Bulwer-Lytton admired Disraeli's father Isaac D'Israeli, himself a noted author.

Taylor was widely known as the \"English Platonist\", and rumors existed that he had produced anonymous pamphlets advocating a return to a sort of pagan religion (these rumors have been debunked by modern scholarsAddey, Tim. Why Thomas Taylor is not the author of A New System of Religion. Prometheus Trust.). Though the extent of his actual devotion to Ancient Greek spirituality remains unknown, brief descriptions written by others about him tend to portray him as a sincerely devout polytheist. One such sketch, written by Isaac D'Israeli, describes Taylor delaying answering his door until he has finished his mid-day hymn to Apollo, and reports that his study contained a hanging globe of clear glass, representing Zeus, that scattered sunbeams he would use to read and write, shifting his position in the room to follow them throughout the day."]}, {"page": "Benjamin D'Israeli (merchant)", "response": ["D'Israeli married twice.  Firstly, on 2 April 1756, he married Rebecca Mendez Furtado, a woman of Portuguese origin. They had a daughter called Rachel.

Fuller also notes that The Praier and Complaynte of the Ploweman unto Christe was \"first set forth by Tindal, since, exemplified by Mr. Fox.\" Since the language of this text is similar to that of Piers Plowman, Fuller attributes it to Langland as well. Thomas Dudley, father of Anne Dudley Bradstreet (1612\u201372), brought a copy of Crowley's Piers Plowman to America. Alexander Pope (1688\u20131744) owned a copy of Rogers' reprint of Crowley's edition of Piers Plowman with the Crede appended, and Isaac D'Israeli (1766\u20131848) wrote in his Amenities of Literature that Pope had \"very carefully analyzed the whole\" of the latter text.

They are said to have been inspired by Newton's seeing an apple fall from a tree on his mother's farm, a version for which there is reasonable historical evidence. In one version of the story, the apple is supposed to have fallen on Newton's head; this version appears to have been invented by Isaac D'Israeli. Voltaire is the authority for the former version of the story. He had his information from Newton's favourite niece Catherine Barton, who married John Conduitt, a fellow of the Royal Society, and one of Newton's intimate friends. How much truth there is in what is a plausible and a favourite story can never be known, but it is certain that tradition marked a tree as that from which the apple fell, until 1866, when, owing to decay, the tree was cut down and its wood carefully preserved."]}, {"page": "Hughenden Manor", "response": ["After passing through his extended family following a series of deaths and resultant will bequests, by 1816 the manor and lands were owned by John Norris, a distinguished antiquary and scholar. Isaac D'Israeli, the father of Benjamin Disraeli, British Prime Minister (1868 and 1874\u20131880, and Earl of Beaconsfield 1876), had for some time rented the nearby Bradenham Manor and, following Norris's death in 1845, bought the manor and lands from his executors in 1847. The purchase was supported with the help of a loan of \u00a325,000 (equivalent to almost \u00a31,500,000 today) from Lord Henry Bentinck and Lord Titchfield. This was because at the time, as Disraeli was leader of the Conservative Party, \"it was essential to represent a county,\" and county members had to be landowners. Taking ownership of the manor on the death of his father in 1848, Disraeli and his wife Mary Anne, alternated between Hughenden and several homes in London.", "In 1947, the Abbey family and the Disraelian Society made Hughenden over to the National Trust. In 1955, it was designated a Grade I listed building. The gardens are also listed Grade II on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.

In the 19th century it was the home of Isaac D'Israeli who died there in 1848 and is buried in the church. His son Benjamin Disraeli, who became the prime minister, lived there for part of his early life. In the later Victorian era, the house was turned into a boarding school for local young gentlemen.

The inspiration of the poem was Sarah Lloyd, teacher of the village school where Shenstone received his first education.

The James of the novel is deliberately treated in a more balanced manner than had been the case in the laudatory An Inquiry into the Literary and Political Character of James I by Isaac D'Israeli (1816). The richness of Scott's treatment of the age is also a result in part of another, more extensive editorial project, his collection known as Somers' Tracts, which had appeared in 13 volumes between 1809 and 1815.
