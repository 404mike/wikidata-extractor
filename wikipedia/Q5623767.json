(However, there is no evidence that the Doeg proper were part of the Tuscarora.) According to Jones, the chief spared his life when he heard Jones speak Welsh, a tongue he understood.

Williams, author of Madoc: The Making of a Myth, suggests that Cherokee tradition concerning that ruin may have been influenced by contemporary European-American legends of the \"Welsh Indians.\" A newspaper writer in Georgia, Walter Putnam, mentioned the Madoc legend in 2008. The story of Welsh explorers is one of several legends surrounding that site."]}, {"page": "Welsh people", "response": ["The process whereby the indigenous population of Wales came to think of themselves as \"Welsh\" (a name applied to them by Anglo-Saxon settlers) is not clear. There is plenty of evidence of the use of the term Brythoniaid (Britons); meanwhile, the earliest use of the word Kymry (referring not to the people but to the land\u2014and possibly to northern Britain in addition to Wales) is found in a poem . The name of the region in northern England now known as Cumbria is derived from the same root.Williams, Ifor. 1972. The beginnings of Welsh poetry University of Wales Press. p. 71 Only gradually did Cymru (the land) and Cymry (the people) come to supplant Brython. Although the Welsh language was certainly used at the time, Gwyn A. Williams argues that even at the time of the erection of Offa's Dyke, the people to its west saw themselves as Roman, citing the number of Latin inscriptions still being made into the 8th century.Williams, Gwyn A., The Welsh in their History, published 1982 by Croom Helm,  However, it is unclear whether such inscriptions reveal a general or normative use of Latin as a marker of identity or its selective use by the early Christian Church."]}, {"page": "Big Pit National Coal Museum", "response": ["Historian Gwyn A.
