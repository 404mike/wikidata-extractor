The isolationism of the 1930s and the biculturalism of the 1960s (Bourassa, while a champion of Francophone rights, always opposed separatism) occasioned favourable treatment among Anglophones, while Lionel Groulx, his onetime foe, described him as \"l'incomparable \u00c9veilleur\". Bourassa's position on social issues (Catholic, moderately reformist, emphasizing the family and agricultural values) likewise has called forth praise and blame.Levitt, Joseph. \"Images of Bourassa\", Journal of Canadian Studies, 1978, 13(1): 100\u2013113.

In noting the sense of passivity in the poem, critics highlight Tennyson's tendency toward the melancholic. \"Ulysses\" is found lacking in narrative action; the hero's goal is vague, and by the poem's famous last line, it is not clear for what he is \"striving\", or to what he refuses to yield. Goldwin Smith wrote in 1855 that Ulysses \"intends to roam, but stands for ever a listless and melancholy figure on the shore\".Quoted in  T. S. Eliot, who praised the poem, still opined that \"Tennyson could not tell a story at all\"; he found Dante's treatment of Ulysses exciting compared to Tennyson's \"elegiac mood\". Victorian scholar Herbert Tucker suggests that the goal of Tennyson's characters is to be moved inwardly by moving through time and space.
