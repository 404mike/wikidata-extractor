He was educated at King Edward VII School and Magdalen College, Oxford, and taught classics at the University of Aberdeen from 1936 to 1948, although from 1941 to 1945 he served in the Naval Intelligence Division at Bletchley Park. In 1948 he became first Reader in Papyrology at University College, London, and was promoted to professor in 1950.

The most striking lines, however, state that in this play Oedipus was blinded by Laius' attendants and that this happened before his identity as Laius' son had been discovered, therefore marking important differences with the Sophoclean treatment of the myth, which is now regarded as the 'standard' version. Many attempts have been made to reconstruct the plot of the play, but none of them is more than hypothetical, because of the scanty remains that survive from its text and of the total absence of ancient descriptions or r\u00e9sum\u00e9s \u2013 though it has been suggested that a part of Hyginus' narration of the Oedipus myth might in fact derive from Euripides' play. Some echoes of the Euripidean Oedipus have been traced also in a scene of Seneca's Oedipus (see below), in which Oedipus himself describes to Jocasta his adventure with the Sphinx.Joachim Dingel, in \"Museum Helveticum\" 27 (1970), 90\u201396"]}, {"page": "List of Old Edwardians (Sheffield)", "response": ["* Sir Eric Gardner Turner CBE (1911\u20131983), papyrologist and classicist"]}, {"page": "History of University College London", "response": ["Further pioneering professorships established in the 20th century included phonetics (1921, Daniel Jones), Ramsay professor of chemical engineering (1923, E.
