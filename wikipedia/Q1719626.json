He is often referred to as \"the father of modern astrology\".His work stimulated a revival of astrology in the Western world after its decline at the end of the 17th century. Leo was a devout theosophist and he worked many of its religious concepts such as karma and reincarnation into his astrology. He used the Theosophical Society's vast international connections to publish, translate and disseminate his work across Europe and America.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 7", "response": ["*1860 \u2013 Alan Leo, English astrologer and author (d. 1917)"]}, {"page": "Reincarnation", "response": ["Inspired by Helena Blavatsky's major works, including Isis Unveiled and The Secret Doctrine, astrologers in the early twentieth-century integrated the concepts of karma and reincarnation into the practice of Western astrology.

A new synthesis of East and West resulted as Hindu and Buddhist concepts of reincarnation were fused with Western astrology's deep roots in Hermeticism and Neoplatonism. In the case of Rudhyar, this synthesis was enhanced with the addition of Jungian depth psychology.Jutta Woods. \"The Theosophical Heritage in Modern Astrology.\" The Mountain Astrologer.
