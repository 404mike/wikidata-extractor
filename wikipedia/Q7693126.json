He made his debut in Colchester's first-ever match on 28 August 1937, when they were defeated 3\u20130 by Yeovil & Petters United at The Huish. However, he became the first player to be dropped by manager Ted Davis. His next appearance proved to be coincidental, as he travelled to Bath to cheer his teammates on, only to be called upon when Syd Fieldus missed his train. He made his third and final appearance on 23 April 1938, in a lineup that had nine changes made to it in Colchester's sixth game in only nine days. The match ended in a 3\u20130 defeat to Tunbridge Wells Rangers, and he was released by the club at the end of the 1937\u201338 season."]}]}}
