He mastered orthopaedic, abdominal, and ear, nose and throat surgery, while designing new surgical instruments toward maximal asepsis. He thus introduced the \"no-touch technique\", and some of his designed instruments remain in use.\nLane pioneered internal fixation of displaced fractures, procedures on cleft palate, and colon resection and colectomy to treat \"Lane's disease\"\u2014now otherwise termed colonic inertia, which he identified in 1908\u2014which surgeries were controversial but advanced abdominal surgery. During World War I, as an officer with the Royal Army Medical Corps, he organised and opened Queen Mary's Hospital in Sidcup, which pioneered reconstructive surgery. The late-Victorian and Edwardian periods' preeminent surgeon, Lane operated on socialites, politicians, and royalty.  Lane thus attained baronetcy in 1913.\nIn the early 1920s, as an early advocate of dietary prevention of cancer, Lane met medical opposition, resigned from British Medical Association, and founded the New Health Society, the first organisation practising social medicine. Through newspapers and lectures, sometimes drawing large crowds, Lane promoted whole foods, fruits and vegetables, sunshine and exercise: his plan to foster health and longevity via three bowel movements daily. Tracing diverse diseases to modern civilization, he urged the people to return to farmland.\nFor his New Health, Lane eventually became viewed as a crank. Lane's explanation of the association between constipation and illness as due to autointoxication is generally regarded by gastroenterologists as wholly fictitious. And Lane's earlier surgeries for chronic constipation have been depicted as baseless. Yet constipation remains a major health problem associating with diverse signs and symptoms, including psychological\u2014sometimes still explained as Lane's disease\u2014and total colectomy has been revived since the 1980s as a mainstream treatment, although dietary intervention is now the first line of action.", "link_mentions": {}}}
