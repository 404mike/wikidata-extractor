Stoke supporters enjoying the clubs title challenge in 1946\u201347 soon dubbed their 'keeper as Dennis 'Herod the king' although Herod was more circumspect about his value in the side. \" I was probably the weakest link in the team. I had not the physique to be a really top class goalkeeper like Frank Swift or Ted Ditchburn. I did however have fast reflexes and I could move quicker than most\".

Heord admits to smoking heavily and gambling, vices which led him to be good friends with Neil Franklin where he was a groomsman at his wedding and received an offer to accompany him to Colombia. Herod declined not wanting to move away from the Potteries where his wife ran a successful grocery business. In the summer of 1950 McGrory signed Don Clegg from Bury to replace Herod. Stoke lost their first two games of the 1950\u201351 season and Clegg was unceremoniously dropped. Herord saw off numerous more challengers, including Arthur Jepson, Emmanuel Foster and Frank Elliott in his 14 years at the Victoria Ground, although his shortcomings meant that McGrory was constantly seeking a replacement."]}, {"page": "1952\u201353 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Frank Elliott"]}, {"page": "1953\u201354 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Frank Elliott"]}]}}
