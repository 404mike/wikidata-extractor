His father was a blacksmith-turned-farmer of Scottish descent, his mother a horticulturist of English descent who wrote articles under the title Garden News. Jack was educated at his local protestant school as well as at home with his horticulturalist mother teaching him. His father was also an early botanical influence teaching him about pruning and grafting. His mother was also active in finding him mentors, corresponding with John William Dawson for assistance with this. Dawson would go on to befriend Jack. Jack was later sent to the Franklin Academy as well as another private academy to obtain further education. He spent two winters studying entomology with Dr H. A. Hagen at Harvard, and a summer working in the grounds of Mr E. S. Carmen, publisher of the Rural New Yorker and his future father-in-law, at River Edge, New Jersey.Pearson, L. (2014).
