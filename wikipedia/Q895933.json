On 16 June 1996 in Brandenburg, Germany, he was attacked because of his dark skin by neo-Nazis. A block of concrete was thrown through the windshield of his car and his car veered off the road and struck a tree.Martin became a quadriplegic as a result of the attack, and required 24-hour care. Having outlived his wife, he announced his intention to seek assisted suicide, to take place in Berlin, as a result. His first announcement, in 2006, set 23 June 2007 as the date of his suicide. As of December 2007 he had made arrangements with a doctor through the Swiss organization Dignitas.A documentary film about Martin, The Finishing Line, directed and produced by Estephan Wagner, was due to be shown on Channel 4 in August 2009. However, Martin objected to the inclusion of two scenes (referred to in court as the \"hoisting\" and \"song\" scenes), and sought an injunction against Channel 4 preventing them from broadcasting it. In November 2009, Mr Justice Eady rejected Martin's application.Martin died on 14 July 2020, at the age of 60.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Noel (given name)", "response": ["*No\u00ebl Martin (1959\u20132020), British activist and neo-Nazi attack victim"]}, {"page": "Martin (name)", "response": ["*No\u00ebl Martin (1959\u20132020), Jamaican-English paraplegic, victim of Neo-Nazi attack"]}, {"page": "Racism in Germany", "response": ["More than 130 people were killed in racist street violence in Germany, in the years between 1990 and 2010, according to the German newspaper Die Zeit.
