The lowest point of the season for the team was undoubtedly a shock 1\u20130 loss against second-tier side Ballyclare Comrades in the second round of the 2014\u201315 League Cup, while their 2014\u201315 Irish Cup campaign ended when they were eliminated in the quarter-finals after losing 3\u20132 to eventual runners-up Portadown."]}, {"page": "Warren Feeney", "response": ["His cousin, Lee Feeney, played for the club in two different spells between 1997\u20131999 and 2002\u20132003.", "In February 2019 Feeney returned to Northern Ireland as manager of NIFL Premiership side Ards.
