The Knossos tablets had been found at various locations in the palace. Evans had not kept exact records. Recourse was had to the day books of Evans' assistant, Duncan Mackenzie, who had conducted the day-to-day excavations. There were discrepancies between the notes in the day books and Evans' excavation reports. Moreover, the two men had disagreed over the location and strata of the tablets. The results of the reinvestigation were eventually published by Palmer and Boardman, On the Knossos Tablets. It contains two works, Leonard Robert Palmer's The Find-Places of the Knossos Tablets and John Boardman's The Date of the Knossos Tablets, representing Blegen's and Evans' views respectively. Consequently, the dispute was known for a time as \"the Palmer\u2013Boardman dispute\". There has been no generally accepted resolution to it yet."]}, {"page": "Mycenae", "response": ["The land possessed by the king is usually called , te-me-no (, \"t\u00e9menos\"), a word that survived in classical Greece (the temenos placed by Hephaestus on the shield of Achilles is called \"royal\"). In classical times the word has a religious connotation . Other important landowners were the , ra-wa-ke-ta (\"l\u0101w\u0101getas\"), literally translated as \u201cthe leader of the people\u201d, and sometimes interpreted as a given Kingdom's military leader, though this is not confirmed by the inscriptions. Alternatively, he may have been the crown prince or, if one follows the argument of a single Mycenaean state, a local king who was a vassal to the overarching wanax / Great King. Below these two elevated persons, Linear B texts situate the , te-re-ta (\"telestai\"), the officials. Leonard Robert Palmer suggests that the \"telestai were the men of telos- the fief holders\". The , e-qe-ta (ekwetai, \"companions\" or \"followers\") were a group of nobles (aristocrats), who followed the king in peace and war. It seems that they were representatives of the king among military groups and religious personnel. There is also at least one instance of a person, Enkhelyawon at Pylos, who appears titleless in the written record but whom modern scholars regard as being probably a king., pp. 71\u201372."]}, {"page": "Mycenaean Greek", "response": ["Such theories are also connected with the idea that the Mycenaean language constituted a type of a special koine representing the official language of the palace records and the ruling aristocracy.
