In 1918 she wrote the classic guide Kamakura: Fact and Legend.\n\nShe was born in Oxford. Her father was the landlord of Count Hirokichi Mutsu, son of the then Japanese foreign minister Munemitsu Mutsu, who was studying at Cambridge, and they fell in love. His father strongly opposed his wedding a foreigner and a commoner. Her family was contrary to the union too. The two didn't give up and, after his father died, when Hirokichi was appointed Consul in San Francisco, he managed to convince her to join him there. This in spite of the fact they hadn't met in over five years.Because he was a diplomat, marriage still had to wait, and to stay with him she finally had to pretend to be a child's governess. It was with that role that she first arrived in Japan in 1901. Four years later, the imperial authorization to wed arrived and, after 17 years of courtship and subterfuges, the couple finally married in London in 1905. For reasons of protocol, she took Japanese citizenship and a Japanese name. Her husband suggested Iso (\u78ef), meaning seaside, because she loved the beach so much and because it sounded a little like Ethel. After the wedding she followed him around the world, finally returning to Japan with him, never to leave again. She liked the country and successfully adapted to it, even giving English lessons to members of the Imperial Family, among them Prince Chichibu, brother of Emperor Hirohito.She died in 1930 in Kamakura and her funeral was held in a Christian Methodist church. After the Christian ceremony, the Vice Abbot from the great Engaku-ji Zen temple took the pulpit, pronounced a eulogy and recited a s\u016btra for her soul. \nShe is buried in the Mutsu family's yagura in the Jufuku-ji temple's graveyard in Kamakura, not far from the cenotaphs of great historical figures H\u014dj\u014d Masako and Minamoto no Sanetomo. Her son Ian Mutsu became a famous newsman and documentary director.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1930 in literature", "response": ["*May 12 \u2013 Iso Mutsu (\u7766\u78ef, Gertrude Ethel Passingham), English-born Japanese travel writer (born 1867)"]}, {"page": "Japan\u2013United Kingdom relations", "response": ["*Iso Mutsu - Author of Kamakura: Fact and Legend"]}, {"page": "Mutsu", "response": ["* Iso Mutsu (1867\u20131930), author of the first guide to Kamakura ever written"]}, {"page": "ISO (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Iso Mutsu (\u7766\u78ef, Mutsu Iso; 1867\u20131930), British writer"]}, {"page": "Jufuku-ji", "response": ["Among the other graves can be found not only those of Japanese celebrities including haiku poet Takahama Kiyoshi and novelist Osaragi Jir\u014d, but also those of some foreigners, among them Countess Iso Mutsu (1867\u20131930)."]}, {"page": "J\u014dchi-ji", "response": ["In her 1918 Kamakura: Fact and Legend, Iso Mutsu had little to say about J\u014dchi-ji, other than it was in complete decay.
