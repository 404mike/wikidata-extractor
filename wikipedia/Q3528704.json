The team manager was His Grace Bernard Fitzalan-Howard, 16th Duke of Norfolk, KG, GCVO, PC, Earl Marshal and Chief Butler of England, and it was joked that \"Lord Ted\" could only be controlled by a duke. In fact, the Duke was the President of Sussex County Cricket Club, had been instrumental in Dexter's appointment as county captain, shared his interests in horse racing and golf and was very popular with the Australian public. In the tour match between the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and an Australian XI Dexter hit 102 in 110 minutes, including 2 sixes and 13 fours. John Woodcock  of The Times wrote \"I doubt if it is possible to hit a cricket ball any harder than Dexter did today. Melbourne is a huge ground and no one who hits a six here is likely to forget it. Against Veivers, an off-spinner, Dexter twice cleared the sight screen, once by a good 20 yards.\"Woodcock, John (10 November 1962) The Times. At the Adelaide Oval Dexter included \"a six from a gigantic hit onto the roof of the stand \u2013 one of the biggest hits ever seen at the ground.\"Moyes and Goodman, p. 75 He was the main draw in the England team and over a million spectators came to see the tourists, the most since 1936\u201337. The tour returned a record profit for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) of \u00a324,000, beating the \u00a317,000 of 1946\u201347.Swanton, pp. 129\u2013130 Dexter continued his good run of form to equal Patsy Hendren's England record of six consecutive Test 50s (85 and 172 against Pakistan and 70, 99, 93 and 52 against Australia), which he soon shared with Ken Barrington and more recently Alastair Cook. His powerful innings enlivened the First and Second Tests and gave England a 1\u20130 lead in the series. Australia came back to win the Third Test at Sydney, where Dexter had preferred to keep his fast bowling attack from the Second Test even when Fred Trueman volunteered to stand down in favour of a second spinner to Fred Titmus. In the end the unsupported Titmus took 7/79 in the first innings and Australia won by 8 wickets, E. W. Swanton and others thought that if either David Allen or Ray Illingworth had been in the team England would have won the Ashes. Even so, the match might have been saved if Dexter had not conceded 27 runs off 26 balls so that the teams would not have to return the next day to finish the game. The last few overs were played in the rain and it rained for most of the fifth day, so England might have won the Ashes. Dexter's negative field placings and lack of urgency failed to regain the Ashes and the painful draws in the Fourth and Fifth Tests particularly spoilt the atmosphere, as Richie Benaud was determined to hold onto the Ashes and Dexter was content to draw a series in Australia. In mitigation the Adelaide pitch was flat as a pancake. The Sydney ground was so saturated in the days before the match that mowing was impossible before the start. The \"square\" was like one large bunker and the outfield like a meadow. Barely a ball reached the boundary. Benaud was an advocate of \"go ahead\" captaincy and Dexter for \"brighting up\" cricket and their reputations were unfairly tarnished.Trueman, pp. 281\u2013282Moyes and Goodman, pp. 101\u2013102Swanton, pp. 124\u2013125Titmus, pp. 102\u2013103", "As captain against Frank Worrell's West Indian cricket team in England in 1963 Dexter was able to loosen up after the Ashes and they played an exciting Test series. After losing the First Test, in the Second Test at Lord's England's first innings rested heavily on Dexter's hard-hitting 70 off 75 balls when he took on the West Indian fast bowlers Charlie Griffith and Wes Hall in an innings that was remembered by all who saw it. In the second innings Colin Cowdrey came out to bat with a broken arm with victory, defeat or a tie still possible in the last two balls, but David Allen blocked them for a draw. England levelled the series in the Third Test thanks to Dexter (4/38 and 1/7) and Fred Trueman (5/75 and 7/44), but lost the last two Tests and the series. In 1964 Dexter was again in charge in the rain-soaked 1964 Ashes series. Famously in the decisive Third Test at Headingley he removed the off-spinner Fred Titmus after he had taken three wickets to reduce Australia to 187/7, still 81 runs behind England. Dexter took the new ball and gave it to Fred Trueman who bowled a series of bouncers which Peter Burge hooked and pulled to 160, hoisting Australia to 389 and a 7 wicket win. Although the change made sense as the new batsman Neil Hawke was fragile against fast bowling and Trueman, the greatest wicket-taker in the world at the time, was playing on his home ground Dexter was heavily criticised for a decision which obviously lost the series. In the Fourth Test Australia made 656/8, but thanks to a stand of 246 between Ken Barrington (256) and Dexter (174) England reached 611 and avoided defeat. It was the first time that two teams had made 600 runs in an innings in a Test, and their fortunes gripped the cricketing nation, but the inevitable draw meant that Australia retained the Ashes. As some consolation Dexter led Sussex to the finals of the Gillette Cup in 1963 and 1964, and won both, the first trophies in the county's history."]}, {"page": "History of the West Indian cricket team", "response": ["West Indies beat India 5\u20130 at home next year, and in 1963, they beat a fine English team by three matches to one.

The following two seasons were moderate, but with the newly found spinning riches of John Mortimore and David Allen, Gloucestershire acquired the most formidable bowling attack in the country during the brilliant summer of 1959, with Cook \"making full use of his wealth of experience\". In this period Gloucestershire, as in the days of Parker, Goddard and Sinfield, often played three spinners, right up to the time when Cook retired in 1964. However, despite heading the first-class bowling averages for the only time in 1962, Cook's extreme weakness with the bat and in the field saw him left out of many matches even in that season and on grassier pitches the switch in emphasis to seam bowling made things even tougher for Cook as he grew older."]}, {"page": "Prime Minister's XI", "response": ["In the MCC tour of Australia in 1962\u201363 there was intense anticipation for the match against the Prime Minister's XI as the 54-year-old Sir Donald Bradman agreed to captain the team after 14 years without playing cricket.

Later in his career, his batting developed significantly, and he passed 1,000 runs in the 1964 season. He was also an excellent close fielder, and in 1966, playing for Gloucestershire against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge, he held seven catches in an innings, equalling the world record for a fielder set in 1957 by Micky Stewart. In his first-class cricket career, he scored more than 12,000 runs and took more than 1,200 wickets, holding 493 catches.", "As an administrator, he succeeded Grahame Parker as Secretary of Gloucestershire on his retirement from first-class cricket in 1976. In 1982 he became Secretary of Somerset, a post that he held for six years, during one of the more turbulent periods in the county\u2019s history, with the decision not to retain Garner and Richards, and the subsequent departure of Ian Botham upsetting many of the club\u2019s supporters.  In 1984 he was appointed Manager of the England Team that toured India and Australia in 1984/85 when the Test Series v India was won 2\u20131, by the team captained by David Gower and the ODI Series by 4\u20131; India were World ODI Cup Champions at that time.  He was also Manager of the England Tour which toured West Indies in 1986.  In 1988 he succeeded Brian Langley as Administration Secretary of the then TCCB (Test and County Cricket Board), now ECB (England and Wales Cricket Board) until his retirement in 1997. He was Chairman of Cricket at Gloucestershire County Cricket Club from 1999 until 2007 and President of Gloucestershire County Cricket Club from 2008 to 2011, when he was succeeded by his former team-mate, David Allen. He was nominated by the club\u2019s supporters to be featured in the Gloucestershire Legends Walkway at the County ground which is due to be installed before the start of the 2021 season."]}, {"page": "Ken Graveney", "response": ["In 1962, he reappeared in a few second eleven matches and, on the resignation as county captain of Tom Pugh at the end of that season Graveney was appointed to lead the county side in 1963 and 1964. With a talented side of bowling all-rounders, including the England players David Smith, John Mortimore and David Allen, Graveney bowled very little and at a very gentle medium pace and batted low down the order. The side finished eighth in 1963, but he retired as captain after a notably unsuccessful season in 1964 when Gloucestershire finished at the bottom of the County Championship."]}, {"page": "Pakistani cricket team in England in 1962", "response": ["! scope=\"row\" | David Allen", "Dexter won the toss, for only the second time in nine Tests as captain, and chose to bat first.Playfair 1963, p. 60. England promptly established a pattern for the whole series by accumulating a large score. Cowdrey and Peter Parfitt made centuries, Tom Graveney 97, David Allen 79 not out and Dexter 72. Parfitt's century was his second in successive innings against Pakistan, following 111 at Karachi in February. All four Pakistan bowlers conceded 100-plus runs. Wisden commented on the \"tremendous amount of work\" that fell on Mahmood and D'Souza, given that the two slower bowlers were \"terribly expensive\". England declared during lunch on the second day (Friday) at 544 for 5. Playfair noted that Imtiaz Ahmed, Pakistan's wicket-keeper, did not concede a single bye in this large total. Playfair also recorded that there was a short delay before lunch on the first day, caused by the arrival of a mouse in the centre of the field."]}, {"page": "Bomber Wells", "response": ["Wells was unable to retain a place in his native County side through the emergence of David Allen who was a far superior batsman. Wells had taken 122 and 123 wickets in 1955 and 1956 respectively but had a moderate season in 1957 and was not able to displace Allen or John Mortimore thereafter. Joining Nottinghamshire, the weakest county team at that time, Wells claimed 120 wickets in his first season, bowling over 1200 overs. He retired after the 1965 season. A poor bat, Wells scored 25% of his runs in sixes. His career batting average was 7.47."]}, {"page": "West Indian cricket team in England in 1963", "response": ["This match had a very exciting climax. When time ran out, England were six runs short of the 234 that they needed to win. The ninth wicket fell when Derek Shackleton was run out from the fourth ball of the final over. Colin Cowdrey had had his left arm broken earlier in the innings, and had retired hurt. Now he reappeared, with his arm in plaster. Luckily for him, and for England, he was not required to face a ball, David Allen playing out the remaining two deliveries."]}, {"page": "History of the England cricket team from 1945", "response": ["Frank Worrell's West Indies hammered England 3\u20131  in 1963.  An innings defeat at Old Trafford was followed by the dramatic match at Lord's when Colin Cowdrey, his arm broken by Wes Hall, returned to the non strikers end as David Allen faced the last two balls of the game with 6 needed to win.  Brian Close, with a charging 70 had taken England to the brink of victory after Dexter's dashing 70 in the first innings against the fearsome pace of Hall and Charlie Griffith with Fred Trueman taking 11 for 152.  Trueman took 12 for 119 at Edgbaston to give England their only win of the series but Sober's 102 at Headingley and the bowling of Gibbs and Griffith was too much for England, who also failed to defend 253 at the Oval."]}, {"page": "West Indian cricket team in England in 1966", "response": ["England's first three-day defeat since 1938 came about through dominant batting by the West Indies' captain and vice-captain, followed up by high quality spin on a receptive pitch. Hunte hit 135 out of 283 in five hours on the first day, and then Sobers took over with 161 in 248 minutes. England dropped several catches, including both century-makers, and of the bowlers only Fred Titmus, with five for 83, emerged with credit. England started badly, with Colin Milburn run out for a duck in his first Test innings, and only a late stand between Jim Parks and David Allen lasted long against the spin of Gibbs (5-37) and Holford (3-34 on his debut). In the follow-on, Milburn made a quick 94 with sixes off Hall and Gibbs, but of the other batsmen only Colin Cowdrey (69) coped with the spin of Gibbs and Sobers. Gibbs finished with five for 69, taking his match figures to 10 for 106."]}, {"page": "History of cricket in New Zealand from 1945\u201346 to 1970", "response": ["The MCC team was captained by Dennis Silk and included Willie Watson, Eric Russell, Roger Prideaux, Bob Barber, Jim Parks, John Murray, David Allen and David Larter."]}, {"page": "John Griffiths (cricketer, born 1931)", "response": ["Competing for a place in a Gloucestershire side that already boasted a Test slow left-armer in Sam Cook and future Test offbreak bowlers in John Mortimore and David Allen, plus the irrepressible Bryan Wells, Griffiths' opportunities got fewer rather than greater across the mid 1950s. His best bowling figures were four-wicket hauls in matches against university sides in 1955 and 1956, with four for 74 the best."]}]}}
