In 1934 he joined  the London, Midland and Scottish Railway where he was responsible for the introduction of new classes of diesel-electric shunting locomotives - he became Chief Mechanical Engineer of the company in the 1940s, but died in 1945 aged 58.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "London, Midland and Scottish Railway", "response": ["* 1944\u20131945: Charles Fairburn"]}, {"page": "LMS Coronation Class", "response": ["The final two locomotives were constructed to the modified design of George Ivatt who succeeded both Stanier, following his retirement, and Stanier's immediate successor Charles Fairburn, who unexpectedly died in office.

The unveiling of the nameplate was performed by Stanier himself. In 1948, the privately owned railways were nationalised and incorporated into British Railways. It was within this new regime that No. 46257 was completed \u2013 in common with other LMS locomotives, 40000 had been added to the original numbers.
