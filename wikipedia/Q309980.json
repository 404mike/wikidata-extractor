Hopkins described his role as Sir as \"the highlight of my life. It was a chance to work with the actors I had run away from. To play another actor is fun because you know the ins and outs of their thinking \u2013 especially with someone like Sir, who is a diabolically insecure, egotistical man.\" He spoke again on the impact the role had on him in 2018, \"When I was at the Royal National Theatre all those years ago, I knew I had something in me, but I didn\u2019t have the discipline. I had a Welsh temperament and didn\u2019t have that 'fitting in' mechanism. I would fight, I would rebel. I thought, 'Well, I don\u2019t belong here.' And for almost 50 years afterwards, I felt that edge of, 'I don\u2019t belong anywhere, I\u2019m a loner.' But in The Dresser, when Ian [McKellen] responded, it was wonderful.
