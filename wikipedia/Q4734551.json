Starting out with Doncaster Rovers it would be at his next club, Sheffield United where he enjoyed most success, playing in the top-flight of English football. After leaving the Blades he had spells at Birmingham, Queens Park Rangers, Huddersfield Town and Rotherham Town before retiring at the outset of World War I.\nDrake also played 157 matches for Yorkshire between 1909 and 1914. Despite making his first-class debut at the relatively late age of 25, Drake was a vital part of the Yorkshire team in the seasons before World War I.", "link_mentions": {}}}
