The band was formed in 1989 by guitarist-vocalist Andy Cairns from Ballyclare and drummer-vocalist Fyfe Ewing. Therapy? recorded their first demo with Cairns filling in on bass guitar. To complete the lineup, the band recruited Larne bassist Michael McKeegan. The band signed with major label A&M Records in 1992, for which they released four albums, most notably Troublegum in 1994 and Infernal Love in 1995. Ewing's departure in early 1996 preceded the arrivals of his replacement Graham Hopkins, and Martin McCarrick on cello and guitar. Neil Cooper replaced Hopkins on drums in 2002. Following the departure of McCarrick in 2004, the band have remained a stable three-piece since.", "While attending a charity gig at the Jordanstown Polytechnic in early 1989, Andy Cairns noticed Fyfe Ewing playing drums in a punk covers band. The two spoke afterwards and agreed to meet for rehearsal in Fyfe's house in Larne with Andy playing a small practice amp and Fyfe playing his kit with brushes. In April they recorded a four track demo tape (Thirty Seconds of Silence) with Andy playing a bass guitar borrowed from Fyfe's classmate Michael McKeegan. Deciding to play live, they recruited McKeegan and played their debut gig at the Belfast Art College supporting Decadence Within on 20 August 1989. They followed this up with another four track demo tape (Meat Abstract). Their sound was becoming highly influenced by artists of the indie rock movement such as The Jesus Lizard, Big Black, and The Membranes as well as new beat disco acts such as Belgian outfit Erotic Dissidents.", "* Michael McKeegan \u2013 bass, backing vocals (1989\u2013present)", " bar:Michael text:\"Michael McKeegan\"", "* Interview with Michael McKeegan and Neil Cooper from Hard Rock Hell Festival 2011"]}, {"page": "Babyteeth (Therapy? album)", "response": ["* Michael McKeegan \u2013 bass", "* The breathing at the beginning of \"Innocent X\" belongs to Michael McKeegan."]}, {"page": "Nurse (album)", "response": ["*Michael McKeegan \u2013 bass guitar"]}, {"page": "Troublegum", "response": ["*Michael McKeegan \u2013 bass, backing vocals"]}, {"page": "Pleasure Death", "response": ["* Michael McKeegan \u2013 bass"]}, {"page": "Infernal Love", "response": ["*Michael McKeegan \u2013 bass, backing vocals, guitar on \"Bowels of Love\""]}, {"page": "Semi-Detached (album)", "response": ["* Michael McKeegan \u2013 bass, backing vocals"]}, {"page": "Caucasian Psychosis", "response": ["*Michael McKeegan \u2013 bass", "* The breathing at the beginning of \"Innocent X\" belongs to Michael McKeegan."]}, {"page": "Shameless (album)", "response": ["* Michael McKeegan \u2013 bass, vocals"]}, {"page": "High Anxiety (Therapy? album)", "response": ["*Michael McKeegan \u2013 bass"]}, {"page": "Larne", "response": ["*Michael McKeegan, musician (Therapy?)"]}, {"page": "Never Apologise Never Explain", "response": ["* Michael McKeegan \u2013 bass"]}, {"page": "Hats Off to the Insane", "response": ["*Michael McKeegan \u2013 bass"]}, {"page": "Fyfe Ewing", "response": ["In 1989, while playing drums in a punk covers band at a charity gig in Jordanstown, Ewing met Andy Cairns and subsequently formed Therapy? with Cairns on guitar and Michael McKeegan on bass.
