In turn, it has also been conjectured by Miles Reid that the number of topological types of Calabi\u2013Yau 3-folds is infinite, and that they can all be transformed continuously (through certain mild singularizations such as conifolds) one into another\u2014much as Riemann surfaces can.  One example of a three-dimensional Calabi\u2013Yau manifold is a non-singular quintic threefold in CP4, which is the algebraic variety consisting of all of the zeros of a homogeneous quintic polynomial in the homogeneous coordinates of the CP4.  Another example is a smooth model of the Barth\u2013Nieto quintic. Some discrete quotients of the quintic by various Z5 actions are also Calabi\u2013Yau and have received a lot of attention in the literature.  One of these is related to the original quintic by mirror symmetry."]}, {"page": "Transformation geometry", "response": [":I have gone to some trouble to develop from first principles all the group theory that I need, with the intention that my book can serve as a first introduction to transformation groups, and the notions of abstract group theory if you have never seen these.Miles Reid & Bal\u00e1zs Szendr\u00f6i (2005) Geometry and Topology, pg. xvii, Cambridge University Press, , "]}, {"page": "Kurt Hirsch", "response": ["* Algebraic Geometry (by Shafarevich).
