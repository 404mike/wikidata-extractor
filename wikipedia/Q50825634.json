The umbrella-like alien spaceship was modelled after an artichoke, while the model London destroyed in the film was actually the remains of Tucktonia, a model village near Christchurch, United Kingdom, that had closed not long before the shooting of the film.

The production spent three weeks filming in Chislehurst Caves in Kent, which served as the tunnels of the underground complex. This was followed by one week's studio filming at Lee International Studios in Wembley Park, London. A fifth week was devoted to effects and linking shots, completed by the second unit at Film House on London's Wardour Street. The crew then travelled to the island of Gozo in Malta for a supplemental location shoot lasting two days, during which they filmed the long shots set on the planet's surface. The strong Mediterranean sun ensured good lighting."]}, {"page": "Krull (film)", "response": ["* Trevor Martin as the voice of the Beast. Nick Maley, one of the team of special-effects makeup designers, designed the Beast as a \"self contained animatronic suit[,] providing not only facial movement but also lung, heart and body-fluid movement all without a single external cable.\" Lawrence Watt-Evans of Starlog noted that the Beast is not clearly visible and can be seen \"only through various distortions, as if he isn't quite a part of normal three-dimensional space at all\".", "* Bernard Bresslaw as Rell the Cyclops (credited as Cyclops). He uses a large trident. The character was designed by Nick Maley. For Cyclops, prosthetic makeup covered the actor's eyes while a radio controlled the character's \"solo\" eyeball that was placed on his forehead. Bresslaw was only able to look through one eye hole while in costume, which made it difficult for him to move around and know where he was really going. Yates explained that he was mostly \"acting blind\", so during the swamp scene, he and the actors had to help protect him from walking into the swamp. Yates explained, \"he came very close on a few occasions\".", "Meddings, who was previously known for his work on Superman (1978) and Superman II (1980), led the special effects department of Krull. British artist Christopher Tucker was also originally in the project but left due to creative differences. Nick Maley and his crew produced several effects six weeks before filming began. The effects department of Krull went for challenges in making visual effects and designs that were unusual to achieve in the early 1980s.

Her contribution included sculpting the prototype puppet for Yoda. Nick Maley, who worked on Yoda with Froud under Stuart Freeborn, recalled that \"Wendy\u2019s contribution creating the character was second only to Stuart who was overseeing ALL the creatures. She single handedly formed the body out of 1 inch sheet foam. She constructed the puppet armature from wooden dowel which gave structure to Yoda\u2019s arms and legs. If I remember correctly, she modeled Yoda\u2019s hands and feet and single handedly fabricated the \u201cstand-in Yoda\u201d, made entirely from cut foam, which was used to line up shots during camera setup. I do remember her spending some time working on the clay model of Yoda's head too.\" Froud later became referred to as \"the mother of Yoda\".
