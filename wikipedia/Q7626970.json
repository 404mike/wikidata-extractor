It also stated that, within the BBC, \"the agenda of debate is probably too driven by the views of politicians\" but that \"overall the breadth of opinion reflected by the BBC on this subject is broad and impressive, and no persuasive evidence was found that significant areas of opinion are not given due weight today\".
