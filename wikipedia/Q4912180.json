(1875\u20131965)", "response": ["This had been Richards' last season as secretary-manager. He was succeeded by Billy Beer, who had played 250 matches for the club in the 1900s. He led the team to three mid-table finishes before, in early 1927, a boardroom dispute over transfer policy came to a head. Writing in the Sports Argus, the pseudonymous \"Argus Junior\" described one faction as \"anxious to secure talent at almost any price\" and the other \"desirous with 'going slow' as its motto\", and believed that \"the former are now in the ascendancy and that they mean business\". Three directors resigned, followed a few days later by Beer, who had reportedly found it impossible to work with some members of the board. Over the next few months, further departures included secretary Sam Richards, former player Billy Harvey, who had acted as team manager, and the long-serving Womack, who made his Birmingham debut in 1908 and set club appearance records of 491 league games, a record which  still stands, and 515 games in senior competition, since overtaken by Gil Merrick. The Argus suggested a better course of action and \"the clear duty of the present board [would be] to resign and test the feelings of the shareholders\"."]}, {"page": "List of Birmingham City F.C. managers", "response": ["Frank Richards succeeded Watson as club secretary in 1911, and when the First World War broke out he took over the managerial reins as well. Under Richards Birmingham won the Second Division title in 1921 and signed players such as Joe Bradford, Johnny Crosbie and Dan Tremelling who did much to keep the club in the top flight through the 1920s. He also forgot to enter them in the 1922 FA Cup. Billy Beer and Bill Harvey kept them in the First Division, albeit in the lower half of the table, before former Arsenal manager Leslie Knighton took charge in 1928. He led them to their first FA Cup final in 1931 and a top-half league finish the following year, but left when Chelsea made him an offer Birmingham were unable to match. Former Birmingham defender George Liddell kept them in the top tier until they were relegated in the last season completed before the Second World War, resigning in September 1939 when league football was suspended. His tenure of just over six years made him the club's longest-serving team manager."]}]}}
