Cushing turned it down, in part because he did not like the script by Jimmy Sangster, and the lead role was taken instead by Anton Diffring. Cushing next appeared for Hammer when he played the Sheriff of Nottingham in the adventure film Sword of Sherwood Forest (1960), which starred Richard Greene as the outlaw Robin Hood. It was filmed on location in County Wicklow in the Republic of Ireland.Cushing, p. 120 The next year, Cushing starred as an Ebenezer Scrooge-like manager of a bank being robbed in the Hammer thriller film Cash on Demand (1961). Cushing considered this among the favourites of his films, and some critics believed it to be among his best performances, although it was one of the least seen films from his career. He appeared in the Hammer film Captain Clegg (1962), known in the United States as Night Creatures. Cushing starred as Parson Blyss, the local reverend of an 18th-century English coastal town believed to be hiding his smuggling activities with reports of ghosts. The film was roughly based on the Doctor Syn novels by Russell Thorndike. Cushing read Thorndike to prepare for the role, and made suggestions to make-up artist Roy Ashton about Blyss' costume and hairstyle.Meikle, p. 126 Cushing and director Peter Graham Scott did not get along well during filming and at one point, when the two were having a disagreement on set, Cushing turned to cameraman Len Harris and said, \"Take no notice Len. We've done enough of these now to know what we're doing.\"", "For Tales from the Crypt, an anthology film made up of several horror segments, Cushing was offered the part of a ruthless businessman but did not like the part and turned down the role. Instead, Cushing asked to play Arthur Grymsdyke,Cushing, p. 153 a kind, working-class widower who gets along well with the local children, but falls subject to a smear campaign by his snobbish neighbours. Eventually, the character is driven to commit suicide, but returns from the grave to seek revenge against his tormentors.Kay, Glenn (2008). Zombie Movies: The Ultimate Guide. Chicago, Illinois: Chicago Review Press. pp. 69\u201470. . After Cushing was cast in the role, several changes were made to the script at his suggestion. Originally, all of the character's lines were spoken aloud to himself, but Cushing suggested he speak to a framed photo of his deceased wife instead, and director Freddie Francis agreed. Cushing used the emotions from the recent loss of his wife to add authenticity to the widower character's grieving. Make-up artist Roy Ashton designed the costume and make-up Cushing wore when he rose from the dead, but the actor helped Ashton develop the costume, and donned a pair of false teeth that he previously used in a disguise during the Sherlock Holmes television series.Cushing, p. 190 His performance in Tales from the Crypt won him the Best Male Actor award at the 1971 French Convention of Fantasy Cinema in France."]}, {"page": "1995 in film", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 10 || Roy Ashton || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 85 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| UK || style=\"text-align:center;\"| Makeup artist || "]}, {"page": "Albert Herring", "response": ["|Roy Ashton", "|Peter Pears*,Joan Cross*,Denis Dowling,Nancy Evans*,Catherine Lawson,Gladys Parr*,Margaret Ritchie*,Otakar Kraus,Roy Ashton*,Norman Lumsden*"]}, {"page": "Starburst (magazine)", "response": ["On 18\u201319 October 1980, Starburst (at that point owned by Marvel UK) produced the  inaugural Marvel Comics Film & Fantasy Convention at Lawrence Hall, London.
