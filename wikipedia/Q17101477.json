Malone became a fierce critic of the bank bailouts arguing that they would lead to massive cuts in public spending. In November 2010 his book about the crisis, The Debt Generation, was published in the UK by Level Press. It had been edited by Mark Tanner from the different writings he had done in The Guardian's comments section, which had totaled 600 pages of material. In 2013 he was also interviewed over his book by Ross Ashcroft on his 'Renegade Economist' talk show."]}, {"page": "Michael Hudson (economist)", "response": ["* Four Horsemen (2012), directed by Ross Ashcroft.\"Cast & Crew\".

The film criticises the system of fractional reserve banking, debt-based economy and political lobbying by banks, which it regards as a serious threat to Western civilisation. It criticises the War on Terror, which it maintains is not fought to eliminate al-Qaeda and other militant organizations, but to create larger debt to the banks. As an alternative, the film promotes a return to classical economics and the gold standard. Among those interviewed are Joseph Stiglitz, former chief economist at the World Bank; Noam Chomsky, linguistics professor; John Perkins, author of Confessions of an Economic Hit Man; ecological economist and steady-state theorist Herman Daly, formerly at the World Bank; and Max Keiser, TV host and former trader. The film was released in the United Kingdom on 14 March 2012.  A book based on the film has been published.Ross Ashcroft, Mark Braund, Four Horsemen: A Survival Manuel, Motherlode, 2012, ."]}]}}
