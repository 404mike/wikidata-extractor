For Cartesian philosophy, life existed on the side of the matter, not mind; and for the physical sciences, the method that had been so productive for revealing the secrets of inert nature should be equally productive in examining vital nature. The initial attempt to seek the cause and principle of life in the matter was challenged by John Hunter, who held that the principle of life was not to be found nor confined within matter, but existed independently of matter itself, and informed or animated it, that is, he implied, it was the unifying or antecedent cause of the things or what Aristotelean philosophy termed natura naturata ."]}, {"page": "Thomas Bendyshe", "response": ["Bendyshe's major work, from 1865, was The Anthropological Treatises of Johann Friedrich Blumenbach for the Anthropological Society.
