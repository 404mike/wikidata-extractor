Voysey's early work was as a designer of wallpapers, fabrics and furnishings in a Arts and Crafts style and he made important contribution to the Modern Style (British Art Nouveau style), and was recognized by the seminal The Studio magazine. He is renowned as the architect of several country houses.\nHe was one of the first people to understand and appreciate the significance of industrial design. He has been considered one of the pioneers of Modern Architecture, a notion which he rejected. His English domestic architecture draws heavily on vernacular rather than academic tradition, influenced by the ideas of Herbert Tudor Buckland (1869\u20131951) and Augustus Pugin (1812\u20131852).\nThe Sanderson wallpaper factory (1901) in Chiswick, which he designed, is named Voysey House in his memory.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Robert Donat", "response": ["In 1929, Donat married Ella Annesley Voysey (1903 West Bromwich, Staffordshire \u2013 1994), daughter of Rev.

He often used tiles and timbers on external walls, in a way evocative or earlier periods, but always in a slightly differing way to the original. This style he adapted and personalised until it had his own distinctive stamp. Devey's style was later developed by other architects such as R. N.

Seen most heavily in his wallpaper designs which reduced ornamental and decorative elements, Voysey declared he wished in his design to start by 'getting rid of useless ornament and burning the modish finery which disfigures our furniture and our household utensils ... [and] to cut down the number of patterns and [colours] in one room.'

The tradition of Kentish oak mullioned and leaded windows, tile hanging and elaborate roofs was assimilated into the \u2018Arts & Crafts style producing a series of country houses admired by discerning patrons.
