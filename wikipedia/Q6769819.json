In April 1988, Crockett decided he wanted the feuding tag teams to have a series of scaffold matches, which neither team wanted because they felt that they were too large to safely participate. This was especially so for the Powers of Pain, who were scheduled to lose the matches by falling off the scaffolding. Barbarian and Warlord decided to leave the company.

The following week Wild Side defeated Jackson and Travis in the rematch and won the CWA Tag Team Championship. Their title reign lasted until the Rock 'n' Roll Express defeated them for the belts on September 11, 1989.
