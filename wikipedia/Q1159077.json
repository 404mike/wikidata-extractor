His first league match in charge was against Millwall on 8 August 2009, which ended in a 1\u20131 draw. He brought many new signings to the club, including League One strikers Rickie Lambert and Lee Barnard, the first of whom cost \u00a31\u00a0million.

Payne and Reid were appointed joint managers until the end of the season on 22 December but with the Hawks in the bottom three at the end of January, the club advertised for a new permanent manager and on 1 February appointed former Crystal Palace goalkeeping coach Andy Woodman.

The visitors went one goal up within 19 minutes thanks to a \"one man mission\" by Icelandic midfielder Gylfi Sigur\u00f0sson, before Lee Barnard levelled for The Saints ten minutes before half-time. The score remained 1\u20131 at the halfway point, and Southampton restarted strongly with a goal from captain Dean Hammond in the 49th minute. With just over 20 minutes until the end, full back Dan Harding gave away a penalty to Reading, which was converted by striker Simon Church. The game was over for the hosts under ten minutes later, as Church doubled his tally and former Saints loan player Michail Antonio sealed the win for Reading in the 85th minute. In the last pre-season game of the year, just five days before the beginning of the league campaign, The Saints played a young side made up mainly of Academy players against local non-league side Eastleigh, with defender Aaron Martin captaining the team against his former club. Southampton broke the initial deadlock, with young striker Sam Hoskins scoring from a low shot in the 20th minute. Many more chances were seen in the remainder of the first half and the second period, but ultimately none were made to count and Southampton finished as 1\u20130 winners to go into the new league season on a high note.", "The following week the Saints travelled to League One newcomers Notts County, with a team that included the return of defender Frazer Richardson after a long injury and captain Dean Hammond following suspension. The home side opened the scoring within ten minutes, with Mike Edwards heading in a Ben Davies free kick to give new manager Paul Ince a dream start to his managerial spell with the club. County held onto their lead until just before the 70-minute mark, when captain John Tompson was shown a straight red card for bringing down Lee Barnard in the box, subsequently resulting in a penalty for the visiting side. Rickie Lambert converted the spot kick to equalise for Southampton, before setting up Barnard himself for a goal just a few minutes later to take the lead. Winger Adam Lallana scored in injury time to seal the win against the ten-man Notts County, sending the South Coast club up to 9th place in the league, their highest since the beginning of the campaign. On 2 November the Saints faced 23rd-placed Dagenham & Redbridge at home, another recently promoted side, and picked up an extremely comfortable 4\u20130 win. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain picked up two more goals to add to his impressive recent tally and put the home side 2\u20130 up going into half time, before Lee Barnard and Jos\u00e9 Fonte scored in the 56th and 69th minutes respectively to convert the dominant performance into another win for Southampton. As a result, the club moved into 6th place, the first time they had been in a playoff position all season. On 13 November the club's winning streak ended at the hands of Carlisle United who picked up a 3\u20132 win over the Saints. The first half saw Southampton display one of their worst performances of the season, with a Dan Harding own goal putting Carlisle into half-time two goals up. Another goal from teenage winger Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain gave the Saints a lifeline, although Carlisle picked up one more to make Dean Hammond's 81st-minute long range strike a mere consolation.", "The draw for the Fourth Round took place the day after the Blackpool match, pitting Southampton against Premier League high-flyers Manchester United, again at St Mary's. The match took place on 29 January 2011, and saw Southampton slip to a 2\u20131 defeat at the hands of the Premier League leaders. The home side were arguably the dominant force in the first half, with a Dan Harding goal disallowed for offside and a Guly do Prado chance wasted, and their strength was confirmed just before the break when Richard Chaplow scored an impressive goal from inside the penalty area. The second half was a disappointment for the hosts however, as United improved their form and fought back with goals from Michael Owen and Javier Hern\u00e1ndez to squeeze the Premier League contenders through to the Fifth Round of the FA Cup and send Saints out of the competition.", "|Dan Harding", "|Dan Harding", "|Dan Harding"]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Brighton & Hove Albion F.C. season", "response": ["| DF || Dan Harding || Southampton"]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Ipswich Town F.C. season", "response": ["| Dan Harding"]}, {"page": "Jack Stephens (footballer)", "response": ["He joined Southampton on 5 April 2011 for a fee of \u00a3150,000, signing an initial three-year contract, and was placed in the club's development squad.
