He spied for the Soviet Union between 1929 and his death in 1933, in return for money. His job gave him access to highly sensitive communications between Britain and her foreign embassies, and the material he passed to his handler Dmitri Bystrolyotov was highly regarded in Moscow. He had no apparent ideological interest in helping the Soviet Union (unlike the more famous Cambridge spies), but was driven by the large amounts of money paid to him to betray his country. By 1933, the pressures of his activities had led to his sacking from the Foreign Office, alcoholism, domestic violence and ultimately suicide.\nDespite hints to there being a spy within the Foreign Office by Soviet defectors Grigory Besedovsky (in October 1929) and Georges Agabekov (in June 1930), Oldham's espionage was only partly suspected by his employers during the last months of Oldham's life, when MI5 began their investigation and surveillance. His activities were uncovered in 1940 when Oldham was identified by the Soviet defector Walter Krivitsky during his interrogations with MI5.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Boris Bazarov", "response": ["Since 1927 Bazarov returned to Moscow where he supervised the Balkan sector of OGPU intelligence. A year later he ran the OGPU \"illegal resident\" operations from Berlin which included France and Balkan line. His covert station controlled eleven agents in Paris, six in Bucharest, four in Sofia and Zagreb, and one for Belgrad and Istanbul. Since 1930 his network supervised the penetration of the Foreign Office (a code clerk, Ernest Holloway Oldham)."]}, {"page": "Theodore Maly", "response": ["The Soviets recognized that his passionate pride, intellect and charm were assets, and in 1932, he assumed the identity of Paul Hardt, a Central European intellectual, and travelled to England to control two British Foreign Office spies: John Herbert King and Ernest Holloway Oldham."]}, {"page": "Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact negotiations", "response": ["Despite the political rhetoric, in 1936, the Soviets attempted to seek closer political ties to Germany along with an additional credit agreement, while Hitler rebuffed the advances, not wanting to seek closer political ties,  even though a 1936 raw material crisis prompted Hitler to decree a Four Year Plan for rearmament \"without regard to costs.\" In the 1930s, thanks to two Foreign Office ciper clerks, namely Ernest Holloway Oldham and John Herbert King, who sold the British diplomatic codes to the NKVD, the Soviets were able to read British diplomatic traffic. At the same time, the Soviet code-breakers were completely unable to break the German codes encrypted by the Enigma machine. The fact that Soviet intelligence-gathering activities in Germany were performed through the underground German Communist Party, which was full of Gestapo informers, rendered most Soviet espionage in Germany ineffective. Stalin's decision to execute or imprison most of the German Communist emigres living in the Soviet Union during the Great Terror finished off almost all Soviet espionage in the Reich."]}, {"page": "September 1933", "response": ["*Died: Ernest Holloway Oldham, 39, cipher clerk in British Foreign Office and spy for the Soviet Union (suicide)"]}]}}
