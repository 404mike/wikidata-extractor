George was one of two debut forwards in the Welsh team, with Tom Pook from Newport. The game was a close affair, with Wales losing 4\u20135, which set up the final Welsh game of the tournament as a wooden spoon decider between Wales and Ireland. George was reselected for the encounter with Ireland, which was played at the Cardiff Arms Park. The game was another tight match, with Wales winning by the fact that they converted their only try, while Ireland missed theirs. George played just one more international game, the opening game of the 1896 Championship away to England. Wales were humiliated, with England scoring seven tries without reply; and the Welsh selectors reacted by changing six of the eight man pack for the next game; George was one of those players whose Wales rugby career ended after the game."]}, {"page": "Holbeck Rugby Club", "response": ["* Tom Pook (b 1869 d 21 February 1948) was a \"small\" (only 5\u20196\" tall) forward who played rugby union for Newport and Wales before turning semi-professional with Holbeck, making his Holbeck debut on 3 September 1898.", "*Tom Pook"]}]}}
