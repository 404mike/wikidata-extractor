He made his first team debut in the 1980\u201381 season, and impressed enough so as to permanently succeeded Joe Corrigan in the City goal. Following mid-table finishes in the 1980\u201381 and 1981\u201382 seasons under manager John Bond, City were relegated out of the First Division in 1982\u201383 under new boss John Benson.

Despite this, Williams was voted onto the PFA Team of the Year, along with teammate Mick McCarthy. Promotion was instead achieved in 1984\u201385, after they secured the third and final promotion place by beating fourth placed Portsmouth's goal difference tally.
