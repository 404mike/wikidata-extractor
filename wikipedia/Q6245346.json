He opposed the dogmas of the Gothic Revival and advocated careful preservation of all medieval buildings without alterative restoration, a generation in advance of the Society for the Preservation of Ancient Buildings (SPAB). Petit also advocated originality in new work, building on all earlier styles from the UK and abroad. His position was supported by many but incurred severe criticism from the supporters of Gothic \u2013 the Ecclesiologists, and leading architects such as Gilbert Scott, who ultimately were more influential in writing the history of the period. Petit's unique artistic style, capturing the emotional impact of churches and cathedrals individually and in their settings, contributed to his popularity as a speaker, where he exhibited up to 100 watercolours to illustrate his talks.\nHowever, he has largely been forgotten since he died. He never sold his art; it was closely held by family until the 1980s when it was dumped in regional auctions in large lots mixed with poorer work of his sisters. As an architectural commentator the mid-19th Century came to be known as the age of the Gothic revival of Pugin, Gilbert Scott and Ruskin, and the strivings of the opposition party, especially Petit, have been downplayed, although they were highly influential in reducing the worst impact of the Gothicists and in preparing the ground for what came later.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Moultrie (poet)", "response": ["After preliminary education at Ramsbury, Wiltshire, Moultrie was sent to Eton College in 1811.

He also ordered to report on the works at Fort William, Dumbarton and other fortifications in western Scotland. He went by land but the train under his command could not get out of the Thames Estuary due to an adverse wind. Petit was thus ordered to improvise a train from the gunners and cannon already in Stirling Castle, Edinburgh Castle and Berwick-upon-Tweed. The rebellion was soon suppressed and Petit marched to Fort William, where he surveyed the land at the head of Loch Ness for a fort. His final appointment was as chief engineer and commander in chief of the ordnance office at Port Mahon from 1716 to 1720, with his son captain Robert Petit des Etans a captain and engineer under him. He briefly returned to Britain in 1717, where he designed four barrack blocks in Scotland and finally went to Italy for his health in 1720 \u2013 he died and was buried in Naples. He was an ancestor of John Louis Petit."]}]}}
