One of the groups which contributed to the Britpop music scene of the 1990s, they continue to write, record and release music over thirty years later. They originally comprised singer Rick Witter, guitarist/keyboardist Joe Johnson, bassist Tom Gladwin and drummer Alan Leach. Johnson was later replaced by Paul Banks, although a later lineup of the band included both Johnson and Banks.", "Shed Seven formed in 1990 from the ashes of Brockley Haven, a band featuring frontman Rick Witter, guitarist and songwriter Paul Banks, bassist Tom Gladwin, Magnus Thompson and John Leach, brother of Alan Leach.  Both Witter and Banks had also previously played together in a band named ENAM, performing to German exchange students in Banks's front room.  Prior to signing a six-album dealRecord Mart & Buyer, Issue 12, July 1999, p37 with Polydor Records in October 1993,Record Mart & Buyer, Issue 12, July 1999, p38 guitarist Joe Johnson left the line-up and was replaced by Paul Banks.  The band twice entered the local Fibbers/Evening Press Battle of the Bands competition, twice failing to win, whilst in September 1993, still unsigned, they were voted the third best live act at London's Inner City Festival. The initial press attention enjoyed by the band came as a result of the positive reviews of their live shows, coupled with complimentary comparisons to The Smiths.  In March 1994, an article by Dave Simpson of Melody Maker, charting the aspirations of \"the UK's brightest hopes\", stated that;'The Newest Wave', Melody Maker, 26 March 1994, p34 \"...Shed Seven's beautifully posed, epic music is different. Not so much New Wave of New Wave as post-Smiths, they're taking the insular bedsit angst of Morrissey's early music and subverting it with a brash and insensitive sexual narcissism.\"", "In 1998, keyboardist Fraser Smith had been recruited as a session player to join the band on tour. As a session player, Smith also played keyboards on the new tracks recorded especially for the Greatest Hits album in 1999. In December 1999, guitarist Paul Banks left the band by mutual consent with Rick Witter citing \"musical differences\" for the split. During an NME interview about his post-Shed Seven band, The Rising, Banks commented on his departure from the group,'Indie Old Guard Rise Again', NME Online, May 2000 explaining that he felt more respected and accepted in his new band.  Banks was replaced by original guitarist Joe Johnson in early 2000 while Fraser Smith became a permanent member of the band around the same time.  Now officially a five piece and with a new song writing team consisting of Witter, Johnson and Smith, the band signed a new contract with Artful Records and in May 2001 went on to release their fourth studio album, Truth Be Told, which was preceded by the lead single \"Cry For Help\".  That summer the band performed at the festivals T in the Park and V2001.\"LIVE: V2001 FESTIVAL\". Chart Attack, August 24, 2001. Review By Frank Walshe", "Lead singer Rick Witter began a solo career with Rick Witter & The Dukes in 2005. The band played several low-key gigs in Scotland as well as two sold-out shows in York shortly before Christmas of the same year, before embarking on a month-long tour in April and May 2006. Their debut album, The Year of the Rat, was released on 16 April 2007.  Alan Leach opened a commercial recording studio in York, taught drums and began hosting pub quizzes, during this time he co-founded SpeedQuizzing LTD with his brother who now produce and sell smartphone pub quiz software globally. Tom Gladwin went on to join the Leeds-based pop/dance outfit The Clients with former members of The Dandys.  In 2007, Tom formed a new band, People in Airports, with singer-songwriter and guitarist Paul Downes.  After leaving Shed Seven, Paul Banks went on to form The Rising, a York-based band composed of Banks, David McKellar (formerly of The 88's), Rob \"Maxi\" Maxfield (formerly of Audioweb) and Stuart Fletcher (formerly of The Seahorses and who later joined Rick Witter & The Dukes).  Banks became a filmmaker, starting his own production company in 2002 he has produced & directed films for the likes of Richard Ashcroft, Faithless and The Script.  Joe Johnson taught guitar in his hometown, and joined a Canadian band named the Black Sours.  Fraser Smith is now a London-based record producer and songwriter, currently signed to Notting Hill Music, and has produced and mixed records for acts such as Ian Brown, Hayley Hutchinson and The Yards."]}, {"page": "Change Giver", "response": ["Although they were seen to be musically relevant, Shed Seven were not beyond reproach as they were also met with a certain amount of discord in the British music press.  Alongside the praise heaped on their live performances, came a wave of non-musical criticism aimed at the \"foolish\" things they said, their haircuts and unfashionable dress sense, through to their band and singer's names. In a piece titled \"Pretenders to the throne\", charting British rock music's challengers to the crown then-held by Blur, The Guardian posed the question: \"do they really expect to make it big with a singer called Rick Witter?\". By the time the record was finally issued in the UK in early September, both critical and public opinion on the band was somewhat divisive.  As noted in Change Giver's Melody Maker review; \"Everybody has an opinion on Shed Seven (...) It's love 'em or hate 'em time!\".", "Change Giver received mixed to positive reviews upon release, with some critics finding it to be a respectable debut album for a young, upcoming band, but that it mainly served as an indication that the group were capable of bettering it in future releases. Angela Lewis, writing for The Independent in October 1994, described the group as \"roguishly disarming youth popsters\" who, despite having \"a bravado whiff of ridiculous self assurance that's straight out of Blur's 1992 patent\", had something worthwhile to offer with the release of their debut album. She went on to note the band's Britishness, and found similarities with The Smiths in their music: \"At the heart of Shed Seven's appeal is their memorable way with a glucose-centred pop tune (many sweat at it but few can actually pull it off) in songs like 'Mark' and 'Dolphin'. Plus, there's the ghost of The Smiths in the Sheddoes chiming chords, putting in a friendly, but not too overwhelming, appearance.\" Ian Gittins of Melody Maker also noted a similarity with The Smiths, via a \"tenuous link\" found in the lyrics written by Shed Seven's frontman, Rick Witter, who he thought had \"an ear for Morrissey-esque homely homilies\". He described the album as \"spasmodically exciting and uplifting\", but found it to be too orthodox a record overall to be able to \"term it a 'classic'\".  He also drew comparisons with both Radiohead and Oasis, and highlighted \"Dirty Soul\" and \"Long Time Dead\" as the album's standout tracks:  \"Viewed as a chipper, cocky collection of brassy northern pop songs, Change Giver scores a resounding... seven out of 10. 'Dirty Soul', the opener, is the kind of choppy, fuzzy rollercoaster ride Shed Seven are good at and 'Long Time Dead' is a supremely catchy angst fest \u00e0 la 'Creep'\".", "All tracks written by Rick Witter (words)/Shed Seven (music), unless otherwise noted.", "All tracks below written by Rick Witter/Tom Gladwin/Joe Johnson/Alan Leach unless otherwise stated", "*Rick Witter \u2013 vocals"]}, {"page": "A Maximum High", "response": ["A Maximum High is the second studio album by the British rock band Shed Seven, released in April 1996 via Polydor Records.
