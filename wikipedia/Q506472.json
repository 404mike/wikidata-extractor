The earliest reference is perhaps the so-called 'Vienna Anonymous' manuscript of the late 15th century, Imperial Library of Vienna (Codex theolog. Gr., 252, fol. 29-32). See Lesk p.427 Moreover, the building north of the Parthenon was not identified with Pausanias' description of the Temple of Athena Polias until Spon and Wheler's account of the topography of the acropolis published in 1682.G. Wheler, A Journey into Greece, London, 1682. Their use of ancient sources in the identification of ancient buildings rather than local folklore, as had been the case before, was innovative and presaged the beginning of scholarship with regard to the Erechtheion. In this same spirit came the work of Richard Pococke who published the first reconstruction of the temple in 1745,Pococke, The Temple of Erectheus at Athens, restored, 1745 and who was the first to conjecture the existence of a larger, symmetrical building. Later, Stuart and Revett published the first accurate measured drawings of the Erechtheion in the second volume of their Antiquities of Athens in 1787. This book, perhaps more than any other, was influential in disseminating the Ionic style and the form of the Erechtheion amongst architects and an appreciative public in the 18th and 19th centuries. For a record of the temple's condition prior to its destruction during the Greek War of Independence, there are the detailed drawings of William Gell.His notebooks are preserved in the British Museum and British School at Athens. Made in 1800-1801 Gell's period of study coincided with the activity of Lord Elgin,  whose despoilation of the Maiden Porch was, at the time, more controversial than his removal of the Parthenon sculptures.Lesk p.603"]}, {"page": "Olympia, Greece", "response": ["Over time the site was buried under alluvial deposits, up to 8 metres deep, long thought to be the result of river flooding.
