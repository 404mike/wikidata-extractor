Some art historians such as Daphne Haldin have attempted to redress the balance of male-focused histories by compiling lists of women artists, though many of these efforts remain unpublished. Figures like Artemisia Gentileschi and Frida Kahlo emerged from relative obscurity to become feminist icons. The Guerilla Girls, an anonymous group of females formed in 1985, were \"the conscience of the art world.\" They spoke out about indifference and inequalities for gender and race, particularly in the art world. The Guerilla Girls have made many posters as a way of bringing attention, typically in a humorous way, to the community to raise awareness and create change.

The paintings were based on isometric projections of a cube and played on the viewer's visual perception through tonal flicker, figure-ground reversals and other optical ambiguities which Bevan described as 'a conflict between the certainty of the geometry and the uncertainty of the perceptual mechanism in dealing with it', adding that the paintings are 'clues to what might be possible'.Stanislaw Frenkiel and Oliver Bevan. Grabowski Gallery, London, 1965. The exhibition attracted favourable reviews from critics such as John Dunbar, Norbert Lynton and Guy Brett,John Dunbar, 'Stimulus of Opposites'.

Grabowski Gallery, London, 1967. This concept of viewer participation \u2013 whereby each person brings their own perceptual interpretation to the paintings and thus contributes to the creative process \u2013 was made tangible in a third exhibition at the Grabowski Gallery in 1969.Oliver Bevan, Jules de Goede and Graham Gilchrist. Grabowski Gallery, London, 1969. This featured seventeen new works, including a tabletop piece consisting of sixteen square tiles which were each divided diagonally into two of four colours and could be rearranged by the viewer to create different combinations of figure and ground. Bevan then developed the idea further, using six magnetic tiles on a square steel sheet that was covered with black canvas and could be hung on the wall like a painting. This new work, Connections, was shown at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in 1969\u201370 as part of Play Orbit, an exhibition of artworks that visitors could interact or 'play' with in the manner of toys and games.Jasia Reichardt (Ed), Play Orbit. London: Studio International, 1969.Connections, Institute of Contemporary Arts, 1969\u201370 Meanwhile, a chance visit to the Grabowski exhibition by John Constable, the Art Director at Fontana Books, led to a commission for Bevan to create the cover paintings for the first twenty titles in a series on vanguard thinkers and theorists called the Fontana Modern Masters. For this Bevan drew directly on his Connections piece, creating two sets of geometric cover designs that the reader could arrange as 'tiles' in a larger artwork.James Pardey, 'The Shape of the Century'.  Eye Magazine, Winter 2009, pp.6\u20138. The books were published in 1970\u201373, by which time Bevan had also collaborated with the composers Brian Dennis and Grahame Dudley on a production at the Cockpit Theatre of Dennis's Z'Noc, a thirty-minute experimental piece in which the musicians take their cues from a constantly changing display of abstract colours, shapes and shadows that Bevan created by projecting light onto three mobiles.Brian Dennis, 'Experimental School Music'. The Musical Times, August 1972. This led Bevan to experiment with Polaroid as a medium for other types of kinetic art, and in 1973 he produced the first of his lightboxes using polarising filters and fluorescent tubes, with more complex versions employing electric motors and sets of slowly rotating discs. These lightboxes became the canvases for 'chromatropic paintings' which, as Bevan explained, enable 'colours to be selected in time as well as space',Oliver Bevan.
