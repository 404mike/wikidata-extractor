He became a great authority on kidney diseases and published a comprehensive paper on urinary deposits in 1844.  He was also notable for his work in related sciences, especially the medical uses of electricity and electrochemistry.  From 1836, he lectured at Guy's Hospital, a well-known teaching hospital in London and now part of King's College London, and published a popular textbook on science for medical students called Elements of Natural Philosophy.\nHaving developed an interest in chemistry while still a child, largely through self-study, Bird was far enough advanced to deliver lectures to his fellow pupils at school.  He later applied this knowledge to medicine and did much research on the chemistry of urine and of kidney stones.  In 1842, he was the first to describe oxaluria, a condition which leads to the formation of a particular kind of stone.\nBird, who was a member of the London Electrical Society, was innovative in the field of the medical use of electricity, designing much of his own equipment.  In his time, electrical treatment had acquired a bad name in the medical profession through its widespread use by quack practitioners.  Bird made efforts to oppose this quackery, and was instrumental in bringing medical electrotherapy into the mainstream.  He was quick to adopt new instruments of all kinds; he invented a new variant of the Daniell cell in 1837 and made important discoveries in electrometallurgy with it.  He was not only innovative in the electrical field, but he also designed a flexible stethoscope, and in 1840 published the first description of such an instrument.\nA devout Christian, Bird believed Bible study and prayer were just as important to medical students as their academic studies.  He endeavoured to promote Christianity among medical students and encouraged other professionals to do likewise.  To this end, Bird was responsible for the founding of the Christian Medical Association, although it did not become active until after his death.  Bird had lifelong poor health and died at the age of 39.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Stethoscope", "response": ["The stethoscope was invented in France in 1816 by Ren\u00e9 Laennec at the Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital in Paris.'Laennec, R. T. H.;  Forbes, John, Sir, A Treatise on the Diseases of the Chest and on Mediate Auscultation (1835). New York : Samuel Wood & Sons; Philadelphia : Desilver, Thomas & Co. . It consisted of a wooden tube and was monaural. Laennec invented the stethoscope because he was not comfortable placing his ear directly onto a woman's chest to listen to her heart. He observed that a rolled piece of paper, placed between the patient's chest and his ear, could amplify heart sounds without requiring physical contact. Laennec's device was similar to the common ear trumpet, a historical form of hearing aid; indeed, his invention was almost indistinguishable in structure and function from the trumpet, which was commonly called a \"microphone\". Laennec called his device the \"stethoscope\" (stetho- + -scope, \"chest scope\"), and he called its use \"mediate auscultation\", because it was auscultation with a tool intermediate between the patient's body and the physician's ear. (Today the word auscultation denotes all such listening, mediate or not.) The first flexible stethoscope of any sort may have been a binaural instrument with articulated joints not very clearly described in 1829.Wilks, p. 490, cites Comins, \"A flexible stethoscope\", Lancet 29 August 1829. In 1840, Golding Bird described a stethoscope he had been using with a flexible tube. Bird was the first to publish a description of such a stethoscope, but he noted in his paper the prior existence of an earlier design (which he thought was of little utility) which he described as the snake ear trumpet. Bird's stethoscope had a single earpiece.Samuel Wilks, \"Evolution of the stethoscope\", Popular Science, vol. 22, no. 28, pp. 488\u201391, Feb 1883 .Golding Bird, \"Advantages presented by the employment of a stethoscope with a flexible tube\", London Medical Gazette, vol. 1, pp. 440\u201312, 11 December 1840.", "thumb|left|Early flexible tube stethoscopes.

The same was purchased for St. Bartholomew's Hospital only ten years later. The record of uses other than being therapeutic is not clear, however Guy's Hospital has a published list of cases from the earlier 1800s. Golding Bird at Guy's brought electrotherapy into the mainstream in the mid-19th century.

Bird's experiments with this cell were of some importance to the new discipline of electrometallurgy, but Bird himself did not pursue this field; his interest was in electrotherapy.  A surprising result from Bird's experiments was the deposition of copper on the porous plaster and in veins running through it without any contact with the metal electrodes.  So surprising, in fact, that it was at first disbelieved by electrochemical investigators, including Michael Faraday.  Bird himself had to carefully examine his apparatus for inadvertent contact, perhaps through the growth of copper \"whiskers\", before he was convinced of the result.  Deposition of copper, and other metals, had been previously noted, but always previously it had been metal on metal electrode.

The function of an interrupter circuit is to continually make and break the supply to the induction coil, which causes the coil to generate a large back emf at its output each time it is switched.  Early interrupters were operated by hand, but Golding Bird introduced an automatic interrupter which worked electromagnetically in 1838.  The problem with Bird's interrupter, and the problem that Letheby wished to solve, was that the direction of flow of the electric current was in opposite directions during the make and the break operations.  Medical applications of electricity often required a unidirectional current, particularly when treating nervous disorders.  Letheby's design caused only either the make or the break current to flow to the patient by a mechanical arrangement of two spoked wheels.  Letherby proposed that a further advantage of his machine was that the pulses from the make contact provided a rather lesser shock to the patient than the pulses from the break contact.  This gave the physician some control in situation where large shocks were not needed.Iwan Rhys Morus, Frankenstein's Children: Electricity, Exhibition, and Experiment in Early-nineteenth-century London,  pp. 250\u2013251, Princeton University Press, 1998 .Henry Letheby, \"A description of a new electro-magnetic machine adapted so as to give a succession of shocks in one direction\", Medical Gazette, p. 858, 13 November 1846.Summarised in The Retrospect of Practical Medicine and Surgery, no.15, pp. 81\u201382, January\u2013July 1847."]}, {"page": "Interrupter", "response": ["The physician Golding Bird designed his own interrupter circuit for delivering shocks to patients from a voltaic cell through an induction coil.
