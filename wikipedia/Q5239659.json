He later became a senior civil servant.\nShackleton was born in Cloughfold near Rawtenstall, Lancashire. He became a cotton worker at the age of nine. He rose through the ranks of the cotton weavers' union and became general secretary of the Textile Factory Workers Association. He was a member of the Darwen Town Council, and member of the Blackburn Chamber of Commerce.\nAlthough the textile workers had not yet joined the LRC, Shackleton was appointed its candidate for the Clitheroe by-election in 1902. Philip Snowden, who had been considered by the Independent Labour Party, withdrew from the race. The Liberals and Conservatives also withdrew, sensing Shackleton's strong lead. He was thus elected unopposed on 1 August 1902. The textile workers' unions affiliated to the LRC shortly afterwards. Shackleton served as Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party for a period.\nShackleton became chairman of the Trades Union Congress in 1906, maintaining his powerful position in the trade union movement. In 1910, Winston Churchill invited him to join the civil service and Shackleton left Parliament. He quickly rose to the rank of permanent secretary in the new Ministry of Labour and is considered the first man from a working-class background to rise to such a senior position.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Clitheroe", "response": ["Clitheroe was one of earliest seats to elect a Labour MP, when David Shackleton won the 1902 Clitheroe by-election for the Labour Representation Committee. He was the first Labour MP to win a by-election, and the third ever elected. He was returned unopposed, but easily won the subsequent 1906 general election, at which he was challenged by an Independent Conservative. Shackleton was General Secretary of the Textile Factory Workers Association, and at the time, there were a large number of mill workers living locally. Labour lost the seat at the 1922 election, and did not regain it until their 1945 landslide victory. The Conservatives won the seat back at the next general election, in 1950, and held it from then until 1983, when the constituency was abolished due to boundary changes. From 1885 to 1983, when the seat existed, the boundaries covered areas outside Clitheroe itself, including parts of Burnley and Colne."]}, {"page": "Will Crooks", "response": ["In 1900 Crooks became the first Labour mayor of Poplar, and two years later was elected to Parliament as MP for Woolwich wresting the seat away from the Conservative Party in a massive electoral victory exceeding expectations.Nick Raynsford in Haworth, Alan, and Hayter, Dianne (eds), Men Who Made Labour, Routledge (2006), p. 50. This success was the result of a pact between the Labour Representation Committee and the Liberal Party; his selection as prospective parliamentary candidate had been criticised by the Independent Labour Party.Howell, David, British Workers and the Independent Labour Party, 1888-1906, Manchester University Press (1983), p. 264.

Shackleton was elected yet he did not act upon his promise made to Eva.  This led to the founding of the Lancashire and Cheshire Women Textile and Other Worker's Representation Committee by Eva Gore-Booth, Esther Roper and Sarah Reddish.  The setting up of this committee led to Eva Gore-Booth meeting Christabel Pankhurst who also felt strongly about women's rights.  However, in 1904, Christabel caused some controversy in the Women's Trade Union Council as she attempted to force the council to make women's suffrage one of its aims to which they refused.  This led to the resignation of Eva Gore-Booth from the council. Resigning from that particular council, Eva Gore-Booth alongside Sarah Dickenson who had also resigned, set up the Manchester and Salford Women's Trade and Labour Council.  As part of this council, Eva and other suffragists used constitutional methods of campaigning.  In the general election of 1906, they put forward their own candidate, Thorley Smith yet he was defeated.  In May 1906 Eva was present in the suffrage deputation to Campbell Bannerman.  Her true feeling of helplessness after the failure of this deputation was captured in two poems, which she wrote.  These poems were titled 'Women's Trades on the Embankment' and 'A Lost Opportunity'."]}, {"page": "Horace Wilson (civil servant)", "response": ["Joining the old Second Division of the British Civil Service in 1900 his abilities came to the notice of senior officials. During the First World War, 1915 saw Wilson made secretary to the Committee on Production and the Special Arbitration Tribunal.  At the end of hostilities in 1918 Wilson moved to the new Ministry of Labour as part of the Conciliation Department. There he worked alongside David Shackleton. He was appointed Permanent Secretary to the ministry in 1921. It was at this time he developed a reputation for resolving industrial disputes, a high point in this regard was his handling of the cotton crisis on 1929. One great asset brought to bear in the arbitration of the disputes was reportedly his adherence to impartiality which was trusted by both employers and employees alike. Success with the ministry caused Wilson to be appointed Chief Industrial Advisor to the Government in 1930 by Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald. Wilson's reorganisation of the cotton industry in Britain was the highlight of this part of his career."]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom MPs: S", "response": ["*David Shackleton (1902\u20131910)"]}, {"page": "List of UK minor party and independent MPs elected", "response": ["| David Shackleton", "| David Shackleton"]}, {"page": "List of Labour Party (UK) MPs", "response": ["*David Shackleton, Clitheroe, 1902\u201310"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the January 1910 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| David Shackleton"]}, {"page": "Gladstone\u2013MacDonald pact", "response": ["There was increasing tension between the Liberal Party and the LRC since the latter's formation in 1900.

Keir Hardie visited Leeds with other top Labour and Trade union officials in early July 1902 to discuss the by-election. However, lack of resources eventually forced Labour not to bring forward a candidate. They had another by-election to fight in Clitheroe in Lancashire which was a better prospect and at a meeting of the ILP in Leeds on 4 July, Hardie told members that the fight in North Leeds would have to wait for a future election.
