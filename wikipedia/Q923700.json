Watson continued his England career, earning his 50th cap against Argentina in a warm-up game prior to the European Championships in Italy. Watson duly played in all three of England's group games \u2013 against Belgium, Italy and Spain \u2013 but a draw, defeat and victory respectively was not enough for England to progress. His final appearance for England came against Iceland in June 1982 having gained 65 caps. He was excluded from the squad for the 1982 FIFA World Cup, with manager Ron Greenwood selecting only three specialist central defenders, Phil Thompson, Terry Butcher and Steve Foster. He did however, appear in the video for This Time We\u2019ll Get It Right, England\u2019s 1982 World Cup song. Watson remains the most-capped England player never to play in a World Cup finals match."]}, {"page": "Brian Horton", "response": ["Horton's next move was to become assistant to former Brighton teammate Mark Lawrenson, now rookie manager at Second Division Oxford United in May 1988. Lawrenson left the Manor Ground in October 1988 after star player Dean Saunders was sold to Derby County without his consent, and the board elected Horton as his replacement; at the time both Derby and Oxford were owned by members of Robert Maxwell's family. The million pound fee for Saunders allowed Horton to build a squad of his own: former Brighton teammate Steve Foster (Luton Town), Wales international Andy Melville (\u00a3270,000 from Swansea City), New Zealand international Ceri Evans (free agent), defensive midfielder Mickey Lewis (part-exchange to Derby for Trevor Hebberd), Jim Magilton (\u00a3100,000 from Liverpool), John Durnin (\u00a3250,000 from Liverpool), and England under-21 international winger Paul Simpson (\u00a3200,000 from Manchester City). He also gave d\u00e9buts to Joey Beauchamp and Paul Kee. Under his leadership Oxford finished the 1988\u201389 Second Division campaign in 17th-place. In preparation for the 1989\u201390 campaign, he exploited the relationship between Derby and Oxford to sign Dave Penney for \u00a3175,000. On the pitch it was a case of deja-vu, as Oxford finished the season in 17th-place, again with 54 points. Hoping to build a promotion winning squad for the 1990\u201391 campaign, he bought Doncaster Rovers defender Les Robinson for \u00a3150,000. The \"Yellows\" finished in tenth-place, eight points off the play-off places."]}]}}
