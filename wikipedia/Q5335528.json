This phenomenon led British journalist Ed Vulliamy to describe Trnopolje as \"a perverse haven\" for the Bosniaks and Croats of Prijedor. Author Hariz Halilovich writes:  Many inmates were starved and physically or verbally abused during their imprisonment. By August 1992, Trnopolje held about 3,500 people. On 7 August 1992, reporters from Independent Television News (ITN), a British television station, took footage of the prisoners at Omarska and Trnopolje, and recorded their living conditions. The images were shown around the world and caused public outrage. This prompted the Bosnian Serb authorities to allow journalists and the International Red Cross (IRC) access to some of the Prijedor camps, but not before the most emaciated of the prisoners were killed or shipped off to camps far from the public eye. Some 200 former male inmates were separated and killed in the Kori\u0107ani Cliffs massacre on 21 August 1992. The publicity generated by the discovery of the Prijedor camps led to their closure by the end of August. In mid-August, Trnopolje was placed into the hands of the IRC.
