More disappointed with an 87 was Andrew Kirkaldy who had reached the turn in 39 and still reached the 17th tee in a strong position. However he took six at the 17th and then missed a \"longish putt\" at the last which would have tied his brother. He eventually three-putted for another six. Fernie reached the turn in 42 but had an excellent 42 coming home to tie with Andrew Kirkaldy.
