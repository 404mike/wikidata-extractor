Roache has been honoured with a lifetime achievement award at the British Soap Awards for his portrayal of Ken.

Ken and Lawrence bond, which temporarily threatens Ken's relationship with his other son Peter. When Ken discovers that Lawrence is intolerant of the homosexuality of his own son, James (James Roache), Ken severs contact.
