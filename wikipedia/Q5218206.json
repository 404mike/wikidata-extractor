Born in Milltown, Ireland, he was educated at Irish Catholic schools and migrated to Australia as a youth. He became a publican in Sydney and served on both Waterloo Council, including several terms as mayor, and Sydney City Council. In 1934, he was elected to the Australian House of Representatives as the member for Lang, representing the Langite Australian Labor Party (NSW). Mulcahy joined the federal Labor Party when the two parties merged in 1936, but left the ALP for the Australian Labor Party (Non-Communist), another Lang party, in 1940. When this second split was resolved, Mulcahy again joined the federal ALP. He held his seat until his death in Vaucluse in 1953.", "link_mentions": {}}}
