Born in Milltown, Ireland, he was educated at Irish Catholic schools and migrated to Australia as a youth. He became a publican in Sydney and served on both Waterloo Council, including several terms as mayor, and Sydney City Council. In 1934, he was elected to the Australian House of Representatives as the member for Lang, representing the Langite Australian Labor Party (NSW). Mulcahy joined the federal Labor Party when the two parties merged in 1936, but left the ALP for the Australian Labor Party (Non-Communist), another Lang party, in 1940. When this second split was resolved, Mulcahy again joined the federal ALP. He held his seat until his death in Vaucluse in 1953.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Eric Willis", "response": ["Willis joined the newly formed Liberal Party of Australia in 1945, after hearing a speech by Sir Robert Menzies.

Mulcahy noted that this would contribute towards achieving a \"Greater Sydney\" council. The conference, convened in August 1925, however split this proposal along party lines, gaining the strong support of Labor councillors and the approbation of the conservative Civic Reform Association councillors, who took particular issue with the large costs involved. Given the strong support of the Labor-controlled city council, and given that Waterloo and Sydney only shared a small boundary along Moore Park, it was difficult for many to avoid the conclusion that the proposal was simply an attempt to secure Labor's hold over the City of Sydney. The Sunday Times editorial of 23 August 1925 expressed this sentiment in the strongest terms, going so far as to describe the proposal as a \"put-up job\": ", "| 29 December 1925 \u2013 10 December 1928 || Dan Mulcahy (ALP) ||", "| December 1929 \u2013 December 1931 || Dan Mulcahy (ALP) ||"]}]}}
