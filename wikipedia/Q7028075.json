This followed an accident on The Smiler ride at Alton Towers, which led to injuries for 11 of the 16 passengers. Responses to her behaviour dubbed it \"disrespectful to everyone involved\" and an \"outright attack\". In response, Burley tweeted \"For those concerned I was hard on Alton Towers boss, he'll get over it. Not sure those on his ride will be so quick to recover\". Her interview with Varney began a negative reaction over social media, prompting 1,816 complaints to Ofcom and also led to over 55,000 signatures on a petition to have Burley sacked. Ofcom declined to launch a formal investigation into the interview."]}, {"page": "Merlin Entertainments", "response": ["In December 1998, Nick Varney, Andrew Carter and the senior management team of Vardon Attractions (Vardon plc) completed a management buyout of the company to form Merlin Entertainments Group Ltd. with the backing of the private equity firm Apax Partners.

In May 2005, the company was acquired from Hermes by a division of The Blackstone Group which later started a major expansion.
