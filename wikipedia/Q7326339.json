He was a volunteer and fought in the Easter Rising in 1916 and was involved in the Garristown and Ashbourne fighting. He was elected as a Sinn F\u00e9in MP for Limerick East at the 1918 general election. In January 1919, Sinn F\u00e9in MPs who had been elected in the Westminster elections of 1918 refused to attend the British House of Commons and instead assembled in the Mansion House, Dublin as a revolutionary parliament called D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann. Hayes could not attend as he was imprisoned by the British authorities at the time.During the War of Independence he was interned in the Curragh Camp. He was elected at the 1921 elections as a Sinn F\u00e9in Teachta D\u00e1la (TD) for Limerick City\u2013Limerick East and was released after the truce.  He supported the Anglo-Irish Treaty and voted in favour of it. He was re-elected at the 1922 general election as a pro-Treaty Sinn F\u00e9in TD and subsequently as a Cumann na nGaedheal TD at the 1923 general election.He resigned from the D\u00e1il in January 1924 and retired from politics. He later became Irish Film Censor (1941\u201354) and Director of the Abbey Theatre. As a historian, he was a leading authority on Irish connections with France from the seventeenth to nineteenth centuries. He authored several major historical studies, including The Last Invasion of Ireland: When Connacht Rose (1st ed. 1937), which has been reappraised by Guy Beiner as a groundbreaking book for its use of oral traditions alongside more conventional archival sources. Other titles include Ireland and Irishmen in the French Revolution (1932), Irish Swordsmen of France (1934), Old Irish Links with France (1940), and Biographical Dictionary of Irishmen in France (1949), alongside numerous articles. For his work on the Irish military in France he received the L\u00e9gion d'honneur.\nHe was a hard-working and much-loved doctor, and apparently a very good one.  Frank O'Connor records that he deduced, correctly, that their mutual friend George William Russell had terminal cancer  simply because Russell (who had moved to England)   in a letter to O'Connor complained of what he believed to be colitis. When O'Connor  showed Hayes  the letter he read it quickly and  said  \"I am sorry but that is cancer, not colitis.\"\nFor several years he was the closest friend of Frank O'Connor, who acknowledged the extraordinary help Hayes gave him in researching  The Big Fellow, his biography of Michael Collins. After some years, however, the friendship cooled, and the portrait of Hayes in O'Connor's memoir My Father's Son, is surprisingly unflattering, given their earlier closeness.\nHe is buried in Deansgrange Cemetery.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1958 in Ireland", "response": ["*1 January \u2013 Richard Hayes, doctor and Sinn F\u00e9in MP (born 1878)"]}, {"page": "East Limerick (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Richard Hayes"]}, {"page": "List of Sinn F\u00e9in MPs", "response": ["| Richard Hayes"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1918 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Richard Hayes"]}, {"page": "Hayes (surname)", "response": ["| Richard Hayes (politician) || before 1918 || 1958 || IrishNational politician", "*Richard Hayes (professor) (born 1945), academic in the areas of Buddhist philosophy and Sanskrit", "*Richard Hayes (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "Limerick (D\u00e1il constituency)", "response": ["Following the resignation of Cumann na nGaedheal TD Richard Hayes, a by-election was held on 28 May 1924.
