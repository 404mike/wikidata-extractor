As editor of The English Review from 1931 to 1935, he was a vocal supporter of fascism in Italy and of Francoist Spain. He was personally involved in the events of July 1936 when two British intelligence agents piloted an aircraft from the Canary Islands to Spanish Morocco, taking General Francisco Franco with them and thereby helped to spark the military coup that ignited the Spanish Civil War.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sir Charles Petrie, 3rd Baronet", "response": ["Among Petrie's journalistic posts was that of literary editor for the generally-conservative New English Review. He supported, with reservations, Spanish dictator General Francisco Franco and was a friend of a leading pro-Franco diplomat, the 17th Duke of Alba. Along with NER editor Douglas Francis Jerrold, Petrie formed in 1937 a group concerned to put the Nationalist case on the fighting in the Spanish Civil War.Stove, R. J. \"In Search of Sir Charles Petrie,\" National Observer, No. 83, June/August 2010.

Certainly his companion Pollard had previously been an intelligence agent.Alpert, Michael, p.18, A New International History of the Spanish Civil War Retrieved January 2012 The flight itself was planned over lunch at Simpson's in the Strand, where Douglas Francis Jerrold, the conservative Roman Catholic editor of the English Review, met with the journalist Luis Bol\u00edn, London correspondent of the ABC Newspaper and later Franco's senior press advisor. Jerrold then persuaded Pollard to join the enterprise, who flew with Bebb as pilot, and daughter Diana Pollard and her friend as passengers to pose as tourists."]}, {"page": "Hugh Pollard (intelligence officer)", "response": ["During lunch at Simpson's-in-the-Strand, Douglas Francis Jerrold, the conservative Roman Catholic editor of the English Review (and also a British intelligence officer), met with the journalist Luis Bol\u00edn, London correspondent of the monarchist and right wing newspaper ABC  and later Franco's senior press advisor. They conceived a plan to move General Franco from the Canary Islands to Spanish Morocco, where the Army of Africa was stationed. The Madrid government recognised that Franco was a danger to the Spanish Republic, and had sent him to the Canaries to keep him away from political intrigue. If a Spanish plane flew to the islands, the authorities would most likely be alerted, but a British aircraft would attract little or no attention. Bolin asked Jerrold to find \"two blondes and a trustworthy fellow\" to carry out the mission, to make the group look like tourists.  Jerrold rang Pollard from the restaurant (Pollard was fluent in Spanish) and asked him if he could be ready to fly to Africa the following day, with two women as \"cover\"; Pollard, an anti-Communist who regarded it as \"the duty of a good Catholic to help fellow Catholics in trouble\", replied: \"depends on the girls\". Pollard was persuaded by Jerrold and Bolin to join the enterprise and he recruited his daughter Diana and her friend Dorothy Watson to accompany him.Alpert, Michael. A New International History of the Spanish Civil War, p.18 Retrieved January 2012 The group charted a de Havilland Dragon Rapide aircraft, piloted by Cecil Bebb, which flew out of Croydon airport, London, at 07.15 on the morning of July 11, 1936, bound for the Canaries.  Pollard and Bebb delivered Franco to Tetuan on July 19, and the General quickly set about organising Spanish Moroccan troops to participate in the coming coup."]}, {"page": "Luis Bol\u00edn", "response": ["In July 1936, Bol\u00edn played an important role in the events leading up to the Spanish Civil War, when he organised the flight of a de Havilland Dragon Rapide aircraft from Croydon to the Canary Islands, in order to transport General Franco from the Canaries to Spanish Morocco. Franco arrived on July 19 in Tetuan to lead the insurrection and prepare the transport of the troops to the mainland. This was some days before the murder of Calvo Sotelo, that triggered the generals to start their rebellion earlier than foreseen, on July 18. Otherwise the rebellion would have come probably a few weeks later. The flight itself was planned over lunch at Simpson's-in-the-Strand, where Bol\u00edn met with Douglas Francis Jerrold, the conservative Roman Catholic editor of The English Review, and Major Hugh Pollard.Packard, Eleanor, and Packard, Reynolds, Balcony Empire: Fascist Italy at War Retrieved 10 July 2012 Pollard contracted Captain Cecil Bebb as pilot, also taking his daughter Diana Pollard and one of her friends, to pose as tourists.Alpert, Michael, A New international history of the Spanish Civil War Retrieved March 6, 2010Robert H.

He was initially enthusiastic about Nazism and in 1933 his article \"Herr Hitler and His Policy: March 1933\" was published in Douglas Francis Jerrold's The English Review, a journal that was otherwise sceptical about the Nazis despite largely admiring Italian fascism.Richard Griffiths, Fellow Travellers of the Right: British Enthusiasts For Nazi Germany 1933-39, Oxford University Press, 1983, p. 41 He wrote again for the journal in January 1935, claiming in his article \"Herr Hitler's Constructive Policy\" that many of the stories of Nazi excesses that appeared in the British press were exaggerations and part of \"a smoke-screen of anti-Hitler propaganda\".Griffiths, Fellow Travellers of the Right, pp. 77-78 In order to encourage links, he led a trade delegation to Germany on 9 May 1934. On 20 September 1934, he met Adolf Hitler as part of a further delegation to Germany, along with Robert Vansittart and other industrialists. He also accompanied Paul Rykens and Montagu Norman on trips to Germany and was, along with Lord Rothermere, Esmond Harmsworth and George Ward Price (foreign correspondent of The Daily Mail), one of four guests of honour at a banquet thrown by Hitler on 19 December 1934.Griffiths, Fellow Travellers of the Right, p. 123"]}]}}
