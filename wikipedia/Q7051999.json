He was a right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium-fast bowler who played for Leicestershire. He was born in Highfields, Leicester.\nBriers' career with the Second XI began in 1965, but he had to wait a further two years until he made his only appearance in a first-class match, against Cambridge University. The game, most notable for opener Michael Norman carrying his bat for a first-class best 221 not out, saw Briers score just one run in the only innings in which he batted.\nBriers continued playing for the Second XI until the end of the 1967 season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Briers", "response": ["*Norman Briers (born 1947), former English cricketer"]}]}}
