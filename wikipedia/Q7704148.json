Patton", "response": ["Patton's colorful personality, hard-driving leadership style, and success as a commander, combined with his frequent political missteps, produced a mixed and often contradictory image. Patton's great oratory skill is seen as integral to his ability to inspire troops under his command. Historian Terry Brighton concluded that Patton was \"arrogant, publicity-seeking and personally flawed, but\u00a0... among the greatest generals of the war\". Patton's impact on armored warfare and leadership were substantial, with the U.S. Army adopting many of Patton's aggressive strategies for its training programs following his death. Many military officers claim inspiration from his legacy. The first American tank designed after the war became the M46 Patton."]}, {"page": "James Brudenell, 7th Earl of Cardigan", "response": ["In her sweeping condemnation of the Victorian class system, The Reason Why (1953), Cecil Woodham-Smith used the Earl as a prism on the ills of British society of the time (but conceded that in the Charge itself Cardigan conducted himself with unwavering courage and discipline). Donald Thomas's 1974 biography Cardigan: The Hero of Balaclava provided a more sympathetic portrayal. Saul David's 1997 hostile assessment, on the other hand, was entitled simply The Homicidal Earl. Terry Brighton's 2005 book Hell Riders: The Truth about the Charge of the Light Brigade provides a more recent critical account of Cardigan as a brigade commander but finds him in no way to blame for the charge."]}, {"page": "Royal Scots Greys", "response": ["As the Russians attacked, the Scots Greys watched as the redoubts protecting the supply lines and Balaclava were overrun by the Russians.Terry Brighton, Hell Riders: The Truth about the Charge of the Light Brigade, (London: Viking, 2004.

Most argue that he misunderstood the order, and when asked by Lord Lucan what Raglan intended by it pointed towards the wrong enemy guns and sent the Light Brigade to its destruction. In recent years it has even been suggested that he deliberately misled Lucan about which guns were to be attacked\". Brighton himself distributes the blame more widely, holding that Raglan, Lucan and Nolan were at fault, but that the vast majority of the blame lies with Lucan. David Buttery, in Messenger of Death, agrees that the blame was at least partially Lucan's for failing to conduct adequate reconnaissance."]}, {"page": "Heavy Brigade", "response": ["At the Battle of Balaclava the brigade was composed of 2 squadrons each of the 1st Dragoons (The Royals), the 2nd Dragoons (Scots Greys), the 4th Dragoon Guards (Royal Irish), the 5th Dragoon Guards (Princess Charlotte of Wales's), and the 6th Dragoons (Inniskilling).Terry Brighton: The Truth about the Charge of the Light Brigade.

Patton's speech to the Third Army", "response": ["Patton's words were later written down by a number of troops who witnessed his remarks, and so a number of iterations exist with differences in wording. Historian Terry Brighton constructed a full speech from a number of soldiers who recounted the speech in their memoirs, including Gilbert R. Cook, Hobart R. Gay, and a number of other junior soldiers. Patton only wrote briefly of his orations in his diary, noting, \"as in all of my talks, I stressed fighting and killing.\" The speech later became so popular that it was called simply \"Patton's speech\" or \"The speech\" when referencing the general.", "Historians acclaim the speech as one of Patton's best works. Author Terry Brighton called it \"the greatest motivational speech of the war and perhaps of all time, exceeding (in its morale boosting effect if not as literature) the words Shakespeare gave King Henry V at Agincourt.\" Alan Axelrod contended it was the most famous of his many memorable quotes."]}, {"page": "Charge of the Light Brigade", "response": ["* Hell Riders: The True Story of the Charge of the Light Brigade, Terry Brighton, Henry Holt and Co, , 2004."]}]}}
