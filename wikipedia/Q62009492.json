The station now had seven through platforms, although two of these were converted to terminal bay platforms in 1974.  One of these at the west end is usually used for the Tamar Valley Line service but the longer east end bays were used for parcels and for Royal Mail trains until the withdrawal of this traffic from the area in 2003.  Outside the station a car park was provided, which was rebuilt in its current multistorey form in the 1970s.
