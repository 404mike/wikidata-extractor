In civilian life Forshaw was a teacher and was teaching at the North Manchester School, a prep school for The Manchester Grammar School, immediately before the outbreak of the First World War.\nForshaw was born 20 April 1890 in Barrow-in-Furness. When he was 25 years old, and a Lieutenant (temporary Captain) in the 1/9th Battalion, Manchester Regiment, Territorial Force during the First World War, he was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions between 7 and 9 August 1915 in Gallipoli, Turkey at the Battle of Krithia Vineyard. The London Gazette of 9 September 1915 reported \"..when holding the north-west corner of \"The Vineyard\" against heavy attacks by the Turks, Lieutenant Forshaw not only directed his men but personally threw bombs continuously for over 40 hours. When his detachment was relieved, he volunteered to continue directing the defence. Later, when the Turks captured a portion of the trench, he shot three of them and recaptured it. It was due to his fine example and magnificent courage that this very important position was held.\"He later achieved the rank of Major. He died on 26 May 1943 and was buried at Touchen End, Berkshire in an unmarked grave. For many years the grave was unmarked but a new stone was erected in 1994 though not on the exact site.\nHis Victoria Cross and other campaign medals are displayed at the Museum of the Manchester Regiment, Ashton-under-Lyne, England in the Forshaw Room.", "link_mentions": {}}}
