Shakman and cinematographer Jess Hall began working with that group before filming to determine the look of each sitcom period that the series was trying to replicate. Shakman and Hall put together a collection of images from existing shows that influenced the framing, composition, and color of each sitcom setting, and Hall created a specific color palette of 20 to 30 colors for each episode based on those reference images so he could control the \"visual integrity in color of each episode\", a process that he had previously used for the film Ghost in the Shell (2017). Hall worked with Josh Pines of Technicolor SA to create 23 different lookup tables for translating colors into the final look during the DI process, and worked with production designer Mark Worthington and costume designer Mayes C. Rubeo to ensure that the sets and costumes for each episode matched with his color palettes. Shakman said there was a progression of color between each episode of the series, and certain colors were carefully used such as red, which is important to both Maximoff and Vision."]}, {"page": "Filmed Before a Live Studio Audience", "response": ["Shakman and cinematographer Jess Hall put together a collection of images from existing series that influenced the framing, composition, and color of the episode's sitcom setting, and Hall created a specific color palette of 20 to 30 colors for the episode based on those reference images so he could control the \"visual integrity in color\" of the episode. Hall worked with production designer Mark Worthington and costume designer Mayes C. Rubeo to ensure that the sets and costumes for the episode matched with his color palette. Hall attempted to create an authentic black-and-white, 1950s look for the episode, but had to balance this with the series' 4K HDR platform. He used digital intermediate (DI) techniques to do this, with a black-and-white Lookup Table (for translating colors into the final look during the DI process) that controlled the HDR factor and the expanded dynamic range. Worthington's team had to learn how different colors work when filmed in black-and-white, and did three days-worth of color tests."]}, {"page": "Don't Touch That Dial", "response": ["Shakman and cinematographer Jess Hall put together a collection of images from existing series that influenced the framing, composition, and color of the episode's sitcom setting, and Hall created a specific color palette of 20 to 30 colors for the episode based on those reference images so he could control the \"visual integrity in color\" of the episode.

Hall worked with production designer Mark Worthington and costume designer Mayes C. Rubeo to ensure that the sets and costumes for the episode matched with his color palette. The episode shifts to Technicolor after the first two episodes were in black-and-white, and is inspired by the early color film look of 1970s television. Hall found this difficult to replicate digitally, with the Lookup Table that he created for the episode (for translating colors into the final look during the digital intermediate process) separating the different colors more than other episodes and moving them towards a pastel color range."]}, {"page": "We Interrupt This Program", "response": ["Soundstage filming occurred at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Atlanta, Georgia, with Shakman directing, and Jess Hall serving as cinematographer. Filming also took place in the Atlanta metropolitan area, with backlot and outdoor filming occurring in Los Angeles when the series resumed production after being on hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The episode's opening sequence features a choreographed one-er that follows Rambeau through the hospital as people return from the Blip, using a handheld camera and natural lighting from the hospital environment. Hall noted that they had been unable to use any of those elements in the previous episodes due to the \"vocabulary\" of their sitcom settings. Dennings found it difficult to act against the monitors seen throughout the episode since she only knew loosely what would be shown on them, with the actual footage added in post-production. She said trying to imagine the footage helped the feeling of solving a mystery. A practical stunt was filmed for when Maximoff throws Rambeau out of her house, with multiple breakaway walls built on set that Parris and her stunt double could be thrown through. An area past the fake walls was lit to match an outside environment, but the production did not have a long enough run to film the stunt that far so the change in lighting from inside to outside had to be created with visual effects."]}, {"page": "On a Very Special Episode...", "response": ["Shakman and cinematographer Jess Hall put together a collection of images from existing series that influenced the framing, composition, and color of the episode's sitcom setting, and Hall created a specific color palette of 20 to 30 colors for the episode based on those reference images so he could control the \"visual integrity in color\" of the episode. Hall worked with production designer Mark Worthington and costume designer Mayes C. Rubeo to ensure that the sets and costumes for the episode matched with his color palette. The way film was transferred to video in the 1980s caused a red channel bloom in the picture, so this effect was added to the episode during the digital intermediate process. Hahn suggested her own makeup, inspired by aerobics videos from the 1980s, and worked with makeup department co-head Vasilios Tanis to develop the look which includes \"vibrant pink lipstick and heavy purple eyeliner\". Hair stylist Karen Bartek used wigs for the hair styles in the episode to allow it to be filmed at the same time as other episodes without the actors' hair having to be re-styled to change between eras. Olsen's \"unrestrained '80s curls\" in the episode were the actress's favorite wig for the series."]}, {"page": "All-New Halloween Spooktacular!", "response": ["Shakman and cinematographer Jess Hall put together a collection of images from existing series that influenced the framing, composition, and color of the episode's sitcom setting, and Hall created a specific color palette of 20 to 30 colors for the episode based on those reference images so he could control the \"visual integrity in color\" of the episode.

Because the Agatha All Along sequence begins in color and then transitions to black-and-white, makeup head Tricia Sawyer coordinated with Hall to make sure the colors of Hahn's makeup looked natural in both formats. Sawyer gave her more vibrant, pink lips that Hall had to make additional adjustments to with the digital intermediate so the transition would work."]}, {"page": "Previously On", "response": ["Soundstage filming occurred at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Atlanta, Georgia, with Shakman directing, and Jess Hall serving as cinematographer. Filming also took place in the Atlanta metropolitan area, with backlot and outdoor filming occurring in Los Angeles when the series resumed production after being on hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic. While filming the scene where Maximoff and Vision discuss grief, Bettany felt that Vision needed a line similar to one he says in Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) about humanity. Schaeffer gave a suggestion that was adjusted by her assistant, Laura Monti, to get the final line: \"What is grief, if not love persevering?\" This line received widespread praise from audiences and critics when the episode was released. Editor Nona Khodai collected all of the available footage of Maximoff and Vision from the MCU films to reference when editing the series, which was especially useful for making sure that she was matching those films with scenes in this episode that weaved between them."]}, {"page": "The Series Finale", "response": ["Soundstage filming occurred at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Atlanta, Georgia, with Shakman directing, and Jess Hall serving as cinematographer.
