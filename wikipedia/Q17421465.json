He was born in Oundle, Northamptonshire and died at Willington, Bedfordshire.\nFred Kingston was the eldest of seven brothers who played first-class cricket or other cricket just below first-class level \u2013 several of them, including Fred, played for Northamptonshire in years before and, in Hubert's case, just after the side's accession to first-class status in 1905. A right-handed batsman and wicket-keeper, Fred Kingston's first match while he was a student at Pembroke College, Cambridge, came for an England XI against the university side, and a few weeks later he played for a team calling itself \"The Gentlemen of England\" in a 12-a-side first-class match against Oxford University at Oxford in which he scored 61 in the middle order. He then appeared in three matches for the Cambridge University side, the final one of which was the 1878 University Match against Oxford, though he did not keep wicket in this game and batted low in the Cambridge line-up. That was the end of his first-class cricket apart from a single appearance for a \"Cambridge Past and Present\" side which played the Australians in 1886, when he batted at No 10 and kept wicket. He continued, however, to play lower grade cricket, mainly for Northamptonshire but also for Devon. In 1882, he captained the Northamptonshire side in their non-first-class match against the Australians.", "link_mentions": {}}}
