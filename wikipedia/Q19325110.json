The aim of this society was to get women elected to local government. An early victory was the election of two women, Jane Cobden and Lady Margaret Sandhurst, to the London County Council. This was possible because of the wording of the Local Government Act 1888 which did not disqualify women candidates. A later court case determined that this was a mistake. Campaigns were unsuccessfully started to reverse the court's interpretation. However, in 1894 new legislation did allow women to stand for more minor roles."]}, {"page": "Mary Stewart Kilgour", "response": ["In 1882, Kilgour collaborated with Annie Leigh Browne, Browne's sister Mary (later Lady Lockyer) and Henrietta M\u00fcller to found College Hall, London."]}, {"page": "Elizabeth Lidgett", "response": ["In November 1888 she and her sister Mary attended the first meeting of what would become the Women's Local Government Society at Sarah Amos's house.
