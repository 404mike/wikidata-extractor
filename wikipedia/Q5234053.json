Similarly, architectural theorist Lars Spuybroek has argued that Ruskin's understanding of the Gothic as a combination of two types of variation, rough savageness and smooth changefulness, opens up a new way of thinking leading to digital and so-called parametric design.Lars Spuybroek, The Sympathy of Things: Ruskin and the Ecology of Design (V2_NAI Publishers, 2011), pp. 65\u201368."]}, {"page": "Anthony Giddens", "response": ["In New Rules of Sociological Method (1976), the title of which alludes to Durkheim's Rules of the Sociological Method of 1895, Giddens attempted to explain how sociology should be done and addressed a long-standing divide between those theorists who prioritise macro-level studies of social life\u2014looking at the big picture of society\u2014and those who emphasise the micro level\u2014what everyday life means to individuals. In New Rules, he noted that the functionalist approach invented by Durkheim treated society as a reality unto itself not reducible to individuals. He rejected Durkheim's sociological positivism paradigm which attempted to predict how societies operate, ignoring the meanings as understood by individuals.Resources at Theory.org.uk, site by David Gauntlett, last accessed on 19 February 2006 Giddens noted: \"Society only has form, and that form only has effects on people, insofar as structure is produced and reproduced in what people do.\"", "All of this is increasingly tied in with mass media, one of our main providers of information. The media do not merely reflect the social world yet also actively shape it, being central to modern reflexivity. In Media, Gender and Identity, David Gauntlett writes:", "Consider also the transformation of intimacy. Giddens asserts that intimate social relationships have become democratised so that the bond between partners\u2014even within a marriage\u2014has little to do with external laws, regulations or social expectations, but instead it is based on the internal understanding between two people\u2014a trusting bond based on emotional communication. Where such a bond ceases to exist, modern society is generally happy for the relationship to be dissolved.

Elucidated largely by David Gauntlett,David Gauntlett (2005), Moving Experiences, second edition: Media Effects and Beyond, London: John Libbey this theory postulates that concerns about new media are historical and cyclical.

Gauntlett furthers notes that \"Madonna was the first person to remix her own populist version of feminism and make it part of a pop music success story\". Scholars Berrin Yan\u0131kkaya and Angelique Nairn wrote that Madonna \"set the trend for promoting a highly sexualized form of feminity, that was challenging, and transformed popular culture\". ", "Madonna has been referred to as a sexual icon, and sex symbol. Some references such as American Masters suggested that Madonna's continued to be a sexual icon as \"she's gotten older\". While Courtney E. Smith in the book Record Collecting for Girls (2011) documented that most people associate Madonna with sex, British sociologist David Gauntlett reminds that Madonna's sexual assertiveness and connotation \"has been one of the most distinctive elements of her life and work.\" American essayist Chuck Klosterman wrote in his book Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs (2003) that \"whenever I hear intellectuals talk about sexual icons of the present day, the name mentioned most is Madonna\". Physicist Stephen Hawking once joked: \"I have sold more books on physics than Madonna has on sex\".", "Madonna has been also noted for her constantly image and style changes (often called reinvention), with writer Matt Cain saying that \"she popularized reinvention\". Served as a paragon of reinvention in both academic and popular press, Ludovic Hunter-Tilney from Financial Times commented that \"her image changes have launched countless fads and fuelled a boom in jargon-filled academic studies about her as a post-feminist chameleon\". Also, thanks to her changes British sociologist David Gauntlett said that Madonna \"is credited with popularizing the view that identity is not fixed and can be continuously rearranged and revamped\". Australian scholar McKenzie Wark assured that alongside David Bowie both \"raised this to a fine art\".", "While reasons given varies when discussing Madonna's status and position both in women's music history and pop, those related commentaries in the point of view of international media include Deutsche Welle, when their staff documented her as \"the first woman to dominate the male world of pop\". British sociologist David Gauntlett found that a writer commented: \"Madonna, whether you like her or not, started a revolution amongst women in music\". Similarly Joe Levy, Blender editor-in-chief said that she \"opened the door for what women could achieve and were permitted to do\". Further comments came from academics and authors of Ageing, Popular Culture and Contemporary Feminism (2014) as they said \"is widely considered to have defined the discursive space for examining female popular music\" and described her as the \"archetypal postfeminist pop icon\". For music journalists like Jon Pareles, she has been a pop archetype. Also, Marissa Muller from W felt that she \"normalized the idea that pop stars could and should write their own songs\".", "Music critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine said that she had a \"huge role in popularizing dance music\". In another illustrative example, she has credit for the introduction of electronic music to the stage of popular music. British sociologist David Gauntlett said that she introduced European electronic music into the mainstream of American pop culture. Various authors, including Lucy O'Brien give credit to Madonna in innovating rave culture (mainly in the 1990s). According to the company The Vinyl Factory, her single \"Vogue\" popularized the usage of Korg M1. According to scholars Berrin Yan\u0131kkaya and Angelique Nairn, Madonna is credited with creating the modern concert tour extravaganza as a theatrical spectacle in which the female music artist is placed centre stage. In another consideration, Jacob Bernstein of The New York Times cited previous examples like Donna Summer or Michael Jackson, but Madonna's 1990 Blond Ambition World Tour \"was bigger, bolder and more imaginative\" for which she set the tone and the bar of moder megatours.", "Stan Hawkins from University of Leeds said that Madonna was the first female solo artist to gain superstar status in the 1980s. Historian Gil Troy confirmed Madonna as \"the 1980's dominant female star\". However, in a point of contrast some American outlets felt that her popularity declined in the next decade, during the 1990s, according to academic Lynn Spigel while Andrew Ferguson argued that her \"real crime\" had been longevity. Overseas, British author Mark Watts writing for academic journal New Theatre Quarterly in 1996, felt that the rise and (perceived) decline of Madonna has gone, so to say, hand-in-hand with that of postmodern theory \u2014 \"but none the less pervasively influential for that\". Before having a career of 10-years, some of those outlet defined Madonna's career as \"veteran\" or as the \"equivalent to five lifetimes in rock-star years\". Many years after, David Gauntlett said that Madonna has provided a recipe for \"longevity\", which many artists, female and male, may try to emulate.", "A large number of international authors and music journalists have noted and commented Madonna's influence on others, mainly amongst female artists. MTV contributor Jocelyn Vena said that \"she's influenced others\" and \"even herself\". Reviewing her then 20-year career in 2003, Ian Youngs from BBC wrote that \"her influence on others has come as much from her image as her music\". Both Youngs and Paul Rees from Q noted that Madonna \"is aware of the influence she has\" on others. British sociologist David Gauntlett studied the influence of Madonna on other performers and presented four key themes that she established as central, and that have since been used and emphasized by her successors (and imitators). Gillian Branstetter writing for The Daily Dot felt that the singer \"is scattered through every major act\" and her influence is \"almost smothering in its totality\"."]}, {"page": "Gauntlett, David", "response": ["#redirectDavid Gauntlett"]}]}}
