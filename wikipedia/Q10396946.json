The area semi-final had Colchester drawn at home for the first time in the competition. Held on 18 February, Colchester's loanee goalkeeper was sent off after just 22 minutes of play against Northampton Town, meaning midfielder Richard Wilkins had to take over goalkeeping duties. With the score goalless at half-time, defender Peter Cawley was sent on as a substitute and took over in goal. Colchester went 1\u20130 ahead in the 66th minute from a David Greene goal, but Northampton struck back one minute later through Dave Martin. Paul Buckle reinstated the U's advantage 15 minutes from the full-time whistle to put his side into the area final.", "In the shoot-out, Colchester captain Richard Wilkins stepped up to convert the first spot-kick, before Carlisle's Paul Conway equalised. Tony Adcock squeezed the ball in past Carlisle goalkeeper Tony Caig who had dived the right way. Carl Emberson saved Owen Archdeacon's penalty kick, before David Greene gave his side a 3\u20131 advantage. Dean Walling then scored for Carlisle as Colchester substitute Karl Duguid stepped up to take his penalty. His effort was tipped onto the post by Caig and saved, a moment which saw a young Duguid break down into tears. Warren Aspinall levelled the score at 3\u20133 with the next kick for Carlisle. Peter Cawley took Colchester's next penalty, which was again saved by Caig. With a chance to win the game with a conversion, Carlisle captain Steve Hayward scored to seal a 4\u20133 penalty shoot-out win for the club.", "|DF ||6|| Peter Cawley || "]}, {"page": "History of Colchester United F.C.", "response": ["Paul Buckle scored Colchester's first ever Golden Goal against Millwall in the Auto Windscreen Shield and wins over Brentford and Northampton set up a Southern Final with Peterborough.
