Both singles received significant airplay on national radio stations such as BBC Radio One (BBC Introducing with Rory McConnell) and also on popular local stations in their native Northern Ireland (Cool FM, CityBeat, U105), a trend which would continue through all of the band's subsequent releases. The band's third single, \"Electric\", released in conjunction with the debut EP, achieved greater success with national radio. The Runaway GO EP was launched in conjunction with Gifted Live at a sold-out show in Belfast's Empire Music Hall on 29 March 2012. The gig was streamed online in HD, the first of its kind in Ireland to have done so since the U2 360\u00b0 Tour."]}]}}
