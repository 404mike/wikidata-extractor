Hall claimed to have interviewed workers for the report, some of whom were undocumented migrants and reported poor working conditions, unlawfully low wages, confiscation of official documents, use of child labour and excessive overtime. Altogether Natural Fruit has brought four cases against Hall, for alleged defamation and computer crimes. Many international human rights organisations and trade unions, as well as UN agencies and the European Parliament and European Trade Commissioner, have condemned Natural Fruit's actions as judicial harassment and an attempt to silence a human rights defender, and called for the cases to be dropped.At Hall's July 2016 trial, Finnwatch testified that the report alleging human rights abuses by Natural Fruit Co was analysed, written, and published by NGO Finnwatch, not by Hall, who was hired merely as a local investigator. However, Hall is identified in the report as the leader of the Finnwatch investigation in Thailand.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Human rights in Finland", "response": ["British migrant rights expert Andy Hall (activist) who worked for the Finnish NGO Finnwatch in Thailand was handed a four-year suspended prison sentence for his report on human rights abuses in the country's fruit-processing industry which products were exported in Finland.Finnwatch rights investigator sentenced in Thailand yle 20.9.2016 The charges related to publication of a report Cheap Has a High Price in 2013 by Finnwatch, a Finnish civil society organisation.

Hall had been commissioned by Finnish NGO Finnwatch to investigate migrant labour rights abuses in Thai factories supplying Finnish retailers. He submitted his findings to Finnwatch, which published a report based on them on its website. Hall was listed as a co-author, although he had no hand in writing the report, which is entirely in the Finnish language, but with an executive summary in English. The summary enumerated human and labour rights violations (such as the use of underage labour, migrant worker passport confiscation, and unpaid overtime) by Natfruit. In 2013, Natfruit filed suit against Hall for defamation and violation of the Thai Act on Computer Crime for allegedly making false statements to public media. Conviction on this charge could lead to seven years in prison and a fine of up to \u00a36.6 million. One of the Andy Hall prison sentences was cancelled by the Supreme Court in Thailand in November 2016.
