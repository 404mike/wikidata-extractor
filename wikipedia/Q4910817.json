In early 1977, the BBC tasked him with the creation of a television series from Herriot's first two novels, If Only They Could Talk (1970) and It Shouldn't Happen to a Vet (1972), using the title of the 1975 film adaptation. It is part of a series of movies and television series based on Herriot's novels. The Herriot novels were written in an episodic style, with each chapter generally containing a short story within the ongoing narrative of Herriot's life.

Bill Sellars had wanted to give the role to Timothy from the outset, but the powers that be wanted to cast the role.All Memories Great & Small, Oliver Crocker (2016; MIWK)  Sellars, instead, asked Timothy if he would accept the role of Tristan Farnon. \"I had a wife, I had children, I had a mortgage to pay, and I wasn't working. So I said, 'No. It's Herriot or nothing.'\" Timothy put everything on the line. \"I got home one night, at about 9 o'clock. My wife was washing up in the kitchen. I walked into the kitchen and she said, without turning round, 'You've got the Herriot part.'\" Timothy also stated that, after all of the roles had been cast except that of Herriot, one of the directors said, \"Why don't we give [the Herriot part] to Christopher Timothy and make him a name?\" In 2003, Timothy said that Alf Wight wrote him a letter after the series started, saying \"You are the Herriot I wrote about\".", "The cast met for the first time in June 1977. \"We all had a meeting together in London,\" recalled Hardy, \"and Bill Sellars said, 'Now, these characters are all based on real people. None of you are to meet these people until we have made at least three episodes.' So I immediately got into my car and fled up to Yorkshire to meet my man, Donald Sinclair. I was intrigued beyond measure by him. He was a true eccentric and, like all true eccentrics, he had no idea himself how odd he was! He absolutely hated what I did, because he had no idea he was at all like that, but when we'd really got into it and were producing them at high speed, his friends used to come to me and say, 'You've got him, that's him.'\"", "\"One of the plans was to make me James Herriot,\" said Peter Davison, \"and then re-cast Tristan.\" Bill Sellars refused this option: \"I said, 'I'm not doing that. It's an awful waste. We'll find another way around it.' We took the rest of the series apart, scene by scene, and all the scenes that [Peter Davison] was involved in, I extracted and took them down to the hospital, threw them on the hospital bed, and said, 'Learn those.'\" This accounts for the three-week break in transmission dates between episodes 11 (\"Bulldog Breed\") and 12 (\"Practice Makes Perfect\") of the first series.", "Aside from the human characters, Siegfried's four dogs make regular appearances at Skeldale House.

I'd say, 'Where are we going to get all this from, Ted?'\" \"They commissioned a second series,\" explained Peter Davison. \"This time they wanted the show to go out in the autumn slot, which meant we would barely finish the first series before starting the next. Chris's leg was improving all the time, but we had lost six or seven weeks, and so had a three-week break in transmission in March to allow post-production to catch up.\"", "Regarding Carol Drinkwater's decision not to return to the series: \"Bill Sellars was very, very cross with me for leaving. I think he thought I had been ungrateful. I'd given everything I could and I couldn't think where else I could take the role, because there was no more material. I wasn't leaving in any kind of spiteful thing; it had nothing to do with Chris and I, which is, of course, what everyone thought. Our split was all very amicable. Chris and I, and his wife Annie, are still good friends\u2014there is no problem there. The BBC was so angry with me, they put a ban on using me. So they re-cast and another actress got the role. I was terribly upset because it was a wonderful role and would have been very good for me. I must say now, looking back on my career, it's one of the few things in my life I would do differently, and I wouldn't have left.\"", "The script editor for 42 of the 90 episodes was Ted Rhodes. Rhodes was killed during a confrontation with a cyclist in Wimbledon in 2003. He was 69. \"I couldn't have done any of it without Ted Rhodes.
