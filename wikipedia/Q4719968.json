Rolls's residence was Croft-y-bwla northwest of Monmouth, a house designed by the architect George Vaughan Maddox, where Rolls had lived with his first wife.Newman, John.

He also undertook a limited early re-building of The Hendre, and carried out work in Commercial Street, Pontypool. Cadw suggests that Maddox was also the architect of the main block of Piercefield House, near Chepstow, working to designs by Sir John Soane. Given the date of Maddox's birth, and the construction period for Piercefield, this seems unlikely. The architectural historian John Newman follows the more conventional attribution to Soane himself."]}, {"page": "Mayor of Monmouth", "response": ["* 1870 \u2013 Alexander Rolls", "* 1871 \u2013 Alexander Rolls", "* 1872 \u2013 Alexander Rolls", "* 1873 \u2013 Alexander Rolls"]}, {"page": "Croft-Y-Bwla", "response": ["The actress Helen Barry once lived at the house with her husband Major Alexander Rolls (1818\u20131882), who was Mayor of Monmouth between 1870 and 1874 and the brother of John Etherington Welch Rolls.Keith Kissack, Victorian Monmouth, The Monmouth Historical and Educational trust, , page 45 Col J.H.

The Griffin public house, at 1 Whitecross Street (pictured), continues to be located at the southeast corner of the intersection of Church Street (pedestrianised), St Mary's Street, and Whitecross Street. Church Street was referred to as Butchers' Row in the seventeenth century. Whitecross Street took its name from the stone cross that once stood in the area now referred to as St James Square (pictured). It was later replaced by a weighing machine which was present at the turn of the nineteenth century. Later, it was the location of a pump donated in 1873 by Major Alexander Rolls, Mayor of Monmouth. The site of the original cross is marked on Speed's map of the town (pictured in map above).
