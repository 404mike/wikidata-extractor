He is best known for the \"Harris matrix\", developed in February 1973 and considered by some to be the \"industry standard\" for stratigraphic archaeology. This was followed by a five-year investigation into archaeological practices.  He determined that the methods did not properly account for stratigraphy, and published his findings in 1979 as the Principles of Archaeological Stratigraphy.\nWhile attending Columbia University School of General Studies in the United States, Harris spent the summers assisting on archaeological digs in Winchester, England. After graduating, he continued his archaeological work, including in Bergen, Norway and along the Persian Gulf. In 1997 he worked towards a PhD through the University of London, while working on excavations in New Guinea.In 1982, Harris became a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London, and in 1991 he became a Fellow at the John Carter Brown Library at Brown University. Outside of academia, Harris has been awarded the Palmetto Award by the Bermuda National Trust, for his efforts in the historical preservation of several buildings in 1994.\nIn Bermuda, Harris served as the executive director of the National Museum of Bermuda, and writes a history column, entitled \"Heritage Matters\", for the local newspaper.  He is a frequent contributor to the annual Bermuda Journal of Archaeology and Maritime History, and has served as its editor.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Edward Harris", "response": ["Edward Harris may refer to:", "* Edward Harris (North Carolina judge) (1763\u20131813), lawyer, politician, and judge", "* Edward Harris (ornithologist) (1799\u20131863), introduced the Percheron horse to America; associate of John James Audubon; amateur naturalist ", "* Edward Harris (Royal Navy officer) (1808\u20131888), British naval commander, diplomat and politician", "* Edward Harris, 4th Earl of Malmesbury (1842\u20131899), son of the above", "* Edward Harris (archaeologist), archaeologist and director of the Bermuda Maritime Museum", "* Edward Harris (Rhode Island politician) (1801\u20131872), wool manufacturer, abolitionist, temperance supporter, and philanthropist", "* Edward Harris (Irish judge) (1575\u20131636), English born judge and politician", "* James Edward Harris, 2nd Earl of Malmesbury (1778\u20131841), British peer"]}, {"page": "Sandgate Castle", "response": ["In 1975, Peter and Barbara McGregor began to restore the ruins of the castle, with the support of the Department of the Environment, Kent County Council and the British Army.

The hotel was rebilled as The Princess Hotel and The Cottage Colony. Its location simply did not allow it to compete directly with the new beach resorts. Although tourism visitors have remained an important part of its clientele, with Bermuda's post-war development as a financial centre (it has long been the global centre of the Reinsurance industry, and international business, not tourism, has been its primary source of revenue for decades), the hotel has taken full advantage of its proximity to the City of Hamilton, and its modern, business-friendly features (from internet connectivity in guest rooms to facilities suitable for business conferences), to cater to the numerous business travellers who have little time for sunbathing or golf (its only competitors for this business would have been the Hamilton Hotel),Dr Edward Harris (20 August 2011). \"HERITAGE MATTERS: Incinerating Bermuda's tourism assets\".

The first, 201 officers and men, under the command of Major Thomas Melville Dill, left for France on 31 May 1916. A second contingent, of two officers and sixty other ranks, left Bermuda on 6 May 1917, and was merged with the first contingent in France. The contingent, titled the Bermuda Contingent, Royal Garrison Artillery, served primarily in ammunition supply, at dumps, and in delivering ammunition to batteries in the field. The Contingent served at the Somme from June to December 1916. They were then moved away from the Front, serving on docks until April, 1917, when they were attached to the Canadian Corps, serving in the Battle of Vimy Ridge. They took part in the Battle of Passchendaele (or the Third Battle of Ypres), from 24 June until 22 October, where three men were killed, and several wounded.

After the war, the British Government increasingly curtailed its defence spending in Bermuda, withdrawing regular army units and transferring ever more of their duties to the part-time units, which were re-organised along Territorial Army lines in the 1920s. In 1928, the Royal Artillery and Royal Engineers companies were withdrawn. The BMA took over complete responsibility for manning the coastal artillery batteries, of which only St. David's Battery was still active by 1939. The Bermuda Volunteer Engineers (BVE) was raised in 1931 to take on the role of operating electric search lights at the batteries (in 1940, they also took on responsibility for signals within the garrison).The Bermuda Militia Artillery and the Great War in France, by Dr. Edward Harris.
