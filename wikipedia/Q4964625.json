He initially proposed a modest series called Skiffle Session, featuring two or three singers with a skiffle group. At first, BBC management was unsure that there should be a radio show specifically for teenagers, but auditions were held for musicians including Chas McDevitt, and a weekly programme was agreed. As Saturday Skiffle Club, it was first broadcast on 1 June 1957. It had a budget of \u00a355 per week, and newsreader Brian Matthew as an announcer. Cliff Richard failed an audition for the programme and was not used, but early regular performers included McDevitt, the Vipers Skiffle Group, Johnny Duncan and his Bluegrass Boys, and George Melly and his Bubbling Over Four. The budget was increased on occasions when Lonnie Donegan, the top skiffle star of the time, performed. Although the experimental programme was successful, management was concerned about the high proportion of American songs performed, and also about the use of songs with religious themes.", "In October 1958, the programme was extended to two hours, from 10 am to 12 noon on Saturday mornings.

Brian Matthew relaxed his style, and often started the show saying \"Hello my ole mateys.\"  The show consisted mainly of pre-recorded \"live\" performances, because of \"needle time\" restrictions on the number of records that could be played by the BBC.
