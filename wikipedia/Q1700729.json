After extensive river engineering projects to dredge and deepen the River Clyde as far as Glasgow, shipbuilding became a major industry on the upper stretches of the river, pioneered by industrialists such as Robert Napier, John Elder, George Thomson, Sir William Pearce and Sir Alfred Yarrow. The River Clyde also became an important source of inspiration for artists, such as John Atkinson Grimshaw, John Knox, James Kay, Sir Muirhead Bone, Robert Eadie and L.S. Lowry, willing to depict the new industrial era and the modern world, as did Stanley Spencer downriver at Port Glasgow.", "The Glasgow Necropolis Garden Cemetery was created by the Merchants House on a hill above the cathedral in 1831. Routes curve through the landscape uphill to the  high statue of John Knox at the summit. There are two late 18th century tenements in Gallowgate. Dating from 1771 and 1780, both have been well restored. The construction of Charlotte Street was financed by David Dale, whose former scale can be gauged by the one remaining house, now run by the National Trust for Scotland. Further along Charlotte Street there stands a modern Gillespie, Kidd & Coia building of some note. Once a school, it has been converted into offices. Surrounding these buildings are a series of innovative housing developments conceived as \"Homes for the Future\", part of a project during the city's year as UK City of Architecture and Design in 1999."]}, {"page": "John Knox (disambiguation)", "response": ["John Knox (c. 1510\u20131572) was a Scottish minister, theologian, and writer.", "John Knox may also refer to:", "*John Knox (British Army officer) (died 1778), served in North America between 1757 and 1760 and notable for the journals he kept during this period", "*John Knox (1728\u20131775), member of the Parliament of Ireland for Donegal 1761\u201368 and Castlebar 1768\u201374", "*John Knox (1740\u20131791), member of the Parliament of Ireland for Dungannon 1769\u201376", "*John Knox (1758\u20131800), member of the Parliament of Ireland for Killybegs 1777\u201383 and Dungannon 1790\u201394", "*John Knox (rugby union) (1880\u20131964), Scotland rugby union player", "*John Knox (cricketer) (1904\u20131966), Argentine cricketer", "*John Knox (footballer) (born 1941), Australian rules footballer", "*John Knox (baseball) (born 1948), American baseball infielder", "*John Knox (philanthropist) (1720\u20131790), Scottish bookseller and philanthropist", "*John Knox (artist) (1778\u20131845), Scottish landscape painter who painted a depiction of the Nelson Monument, Glasgow", "*John Knox (chemist) (1928\u20132018), professor of physical chemistry", "*John Knox (meteorologist) (fl. 1980s\u20132010s), American meteorologist and mathematician, found new method of calculating the mathematical constant ", "*John Knox, a character from Lantana"]}, {"page": "John Knox (painter)", "response": ["#REDIRECTJohn Knox (artist)"]}]}}
