In 1999, it was reported that INFORM was facing closure, due to lack of funds. By 2000, Home Office funding was restored, prompting Sackville to warn that INFORM might provide government with bad advice, adding, \"I cancelled INFORM's grant and I think it's absurd that it's been brought back\". Criticism of INFORM has focused on Barker's reluctance to condemn all new religions as \"cults\". Barker responded to the criticism by saying, \"We are not cult apologists. People make a lot of noise without doing serious research \u2013 so much so that they can end up sounding as closed to reason as the cults they're attacking. Besides, I imagine FAIR was disappointed not to get our funding\"."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1992 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Hon.
