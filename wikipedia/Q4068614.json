It was run by MacColl and his new wife, Peggy Seeger. Cameron became a resident at this folk club and continued to have a high profile as a singer, while at the same time, her film career was also taking off. With fellow Tyneside artist Louis Killen, Cameron released a 1961 album entitled The Waters of Tyne: Northumbrian Songs and Ballads, and in 1962, an album with Tony Britton entitled Songs of Love, Lust and Loose Living. Also in 1962, Cameron contributed 6 songs to a Folkways (U.S.) release entitled The Jupiter Book of Ballads, performing \"Lord Randall\", \"The Dowie Dens of Yarrow\", \"Mary Hamilton\" (with John Laurie), \"Blackwaterside\", \"High Barbaree\", and \"The House of the Rising Sun\". That same year, her own full length album was released in the U.S. on Prestige International, entitled The Best of Isla Cameron, with guitar, banjo and autoharp accompaniment provided by Peggy Seeger. The following year Peter Kennedy recorded her singing with accompaniment by Jack Armstrong on Northumbrian pipes, for an album Northumbrian Minstrelsy (shared with Bob Davenport and the Rakes) on which she performed 6 songs. In 1963-1964, she was regularly featured in Rory McEwen's Blues and Folk music programme on ABC regional television entitled \"Hullabaloo\". In 1965, Cameron was one of several performers who took part in \"Hallelujah!\", a Sunday evening TV series devised by Sydney Carter and featuring Carter himself, Cameron, Nadia Cattouse, the Johnny Scott Trio and Martin Carthy; an album featuring selections from the series was issued on Fontana in 1966, featuring Cameron on lead vocal on six selections and joining with the remaining cast on two more."]}, {"page": "Rory McEwen (politician)", "response": [":Allan Scott, millionaire trucking magnate and publisher of the Border Watch newspaper, stood down editor Frank Morello in the final week of the campaign after the Border Watch ran a number of articles seen to be critical of the Liberal Party and its candidate. The move also prompted the sudden resignation of Lechelle Earl, the writer of the articles and the paper\u2019s chief-of-staff. Craig Bildstien of The Advertiser that \"everyone The Advertiser spoke to suspects millionaire businessman Allan Scott is the chief financier\" of a local Liberal campaign that has been \"flush with funds\", with \"widespread reports that the Liberals spent $50,000 on TV advertising between October and January\". The paper later reported that it had \"learned that Labor candidate Brad Coates last week threatened to withdraw $6000 worth of advertising from the Border Watch because of concerns that the paper was \u2018too pro-Liberal\u2019\". Earlier in the campaign, the Border Watch conducted a \"straw poll\" of 100 local voters \u2013 presumably conducted at the Mount Gambier Arms just before closing time \u2013 which failed to get an answer out of 51 of them. Of the remainder, 23 backed Rory McEwen against 11 for Labor and 10 for Liberal. The accompanying article drew attention to this intriguing insight from Antony Green: \"There are reports the CFMEU is putting considerable effort into Labor's campaign in this seat. This would be unlikely to elect a Labor MP, but it might be enough to defeat McEwen by squeezing his primary vote, as suggested by the Advertiser's opinion poll. Given Mike Rann has promised that McEwen can stay in Cabinet if Labor is re-elected, there will be a few Labor factional leaders who realise that one way of creating a cabinet vacancy is to defeat McEwen. If there is a vigorous Labor campaign in Mount Gambier, it is more about internal Labor politics in the formation of the next cabinet than realistic hopes of Labor winning Mount Gambier\".
