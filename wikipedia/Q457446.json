William Jackson, Robin Welsh,  Thomas Murray and Laurence Jackson are listed as the medallists by the British Olympic Association and International Society of Olympic Historians. The Herald reports that those four are the only British curlers that played, and they received gold medals and certificates. However, the IOC database omits Laurence Jackson and includes T. Aikman, D. G. Astley, W. Brown, R. Cousin and J. McLeod. According to The Herald, the IOC believes that those five also received medals. The World Curling Federation's list agrees with the BOA, but also lists John T. Robertson Aikman [incorrectly] as an alternate."]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 1924 Winter Olympics", "response": ["|  || William Jackson  Thomas Murray     || Curling ||Men's event", "|Thomas Murray"]}]}}
