But he regained his first team place in the left\u2013back position when Harte began playing in the central defence position. His first appearance of the season came on 10 October 2009, where he started and played 82 minutes before being substituted, in a 1\u20130 loss against Norwich City. After suffering a bruised foot in February 2010, Horwood regained his first team place for the rest of the season since he recovered from a foot injury. He then played a vital role during a 2\u20132 draw against Southend United when he set up two goals on 20 March 2010. A week later, Horwood started in the left\u2013back position for the Football League Trophy Final, in a 4\u20131 loss against Southampton. Despite the loss, Horwood then set up a goal for Jason Price, in a 3\u20131 win over Bristol Rovers on 2 April 2010.

They beat champions The New Saints for the first time and it was also the first time they had ever been top of the Welsh Premier League. They won the NWCFA Challenge Cup and beat local rivals Bangor City 3-1 after extra-time to win the Welsh Cup Final at the Racecourse, Wrexham. They then went on to make Welsh football history by being the first Welsh club to reach the second qualifying round of the UEFA Europa League at the first attempt.

Paul Heffernan was sent off for headbutting Southend's Peter Clarke after they tangled in a tackle with three minutes to go and the match finished goalless.  The second leg was held a week later at the Keepmoat Stadium in Doncaster.
