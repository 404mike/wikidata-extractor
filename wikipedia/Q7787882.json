Noted for his pace and his accuracy, Brett was a leading wicket-taker in the 1770s and was lauded by John Nyren in The Cricketers of my Time. Writing half a century later, Nyren described Brett as \"beyond all comparison, the fastest as well as straitest bowler that ever was known\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Underarm bowling", "response": ["Other great bowlers of the late 18th century were Thomas Brett and David Harris, both of the Hambledon club.

In a match between Chertsey and Hambledon at Laleham Burway, the Chertsey all-rounder Thomas White used a bat that was the width of the wicket. There was no rule in place to prevent this action and so all the Hambledon players could do was register a formal protest which was signed by Thomas Brett, Richard Nyren and John Small, the three leading Hambledon players. As a result, it was decided by the game's lawmakers that the maximum width of the bat must be four and one quarter inches; this was included in the next revision of the Laws and it remains the maximum width."]}, {"page": "History of cricket", "response": ["But far and away the most famous of the early clubs was Hambledon in Hampshire. It started as a parish organisation that first achieved prominence in 1756. The club itself was founded in the 1760s and was well patronised to the extent that it was the focal point of the game for about thirty years until the formation of MCC and the opening of Lord's Cricket Ground in 1787. Hambledon produced several outstanding players including the master batsman John Small and the first great fast bowler Thomas Brett. Their most notable opponent was the Chertsey and Surrey bowler Edward \"Lumpy\" Stevens, who is believed to have been the main proponent of the flighted delivery."]}, {"page": "Hampshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["The origin of the legendary Hambledon Club is lost.  There remains no definite knowledge of Hambledon cricket before 1756, when its team had gained sufficient repute to be capable of attempting three matches against Dartford, itself a famous club since the 1720s if not earlier. Hambledon had presumably earned recognition as the best parish team in Hampshire, but no reports of their local matches have been found. We do not know when the Hambledon Club was founded and it seems likely that some kind of parish organisation was operating in 1756, although there may well have been a patron involved.  The Sussex v Hampshire match in June 1766 is the earliest reference to Hampshire as an individual county team.  Whether the Hambledon Club was involved is unrecorded but presumably it was. Some historians believe it was at about this time that the club, as distinct from a parish organisation, was founded.  The Hambledon Club was in many respects a Hampshire county club for it organised Hampshire matches, although it was a multi-functional club and not dedicated to cricket alone. Its membership attracted large numbers of sporting gentry and it dominated the sport, both on and off the field, for about thirty years until the formation of Marylebone Cricket Club in 1787. Hambledon produced some legendary Hampshire players including master batsman John Small and the two great fast bowlers Thomas Brett and David Harris.  Following the demise of the Hambledon Club towards the end of the 18th century, Hampshire continued to be recognised as a first-class team into the nineteenth century but, after the 1828 season, they had long spells without any first-class matches until the county club was founded in 1864. The county played some first-class fixtures during 1842 to 1845 and one match versus MCC in 1861 but was otherwise outside cricket's mainstream through 1829 to 1863."]}, {"page": "Hambledon Club", "response": ["From the mid-1760s, Hambledon's stature grew till by the late 1770s it was the foremost cricket club in England.According to In the Mists of Time  (3rd ed., 2005), the Artillery Ground, home of \"the original London Club\" from 1730 or earlier, \"became the featured venue of all London cricket until about 1765, after which the focus shifted to Hambledon and the London Club disbanded\".  In spite of its relative remoteness, it had developed into a private club of noblemen and country gentry, for whom one of cricket's attractions was the opportunity it offered for betting. Although some of these occasionally played in matches, professional players were mainly employed.In 1782 it was decided that those who played for the County XI should receive \"on the practice days, four shillings if winners and three shillings if losers, provided they attended by twelve of the clock\". Barclays World of Cricket, Collins, 1980, , p. 5.  The club produced several famous players including John Small, Thomas Brett, Richard Nyren, David Harris, Tom Taylor, Billy Beldham and Tom Walker.

Hambledon won the match by 1 wicket.Buckley, p. 56.Waghorn, Cricket Scores, p. 76. It was in this game that Chertsey's Thomas White used a bat that was as wide as the wicket, possibly in an attempt to force an issue about the width of the new straight bats that had recently replaced the old curved sticks.Nyren, p. 156. Whether that was White's intention is unclear but his action ensured that a new rule was passed which limited the width to 4.25\u00a0inches. This rule supported a written motion presented by Hambledon bowler Thomas Brett that was counter-signed by club captain Richard Nyren and senior batsman Small. The original of Brett's memorandum, bearing Small's signature, is maintained by Marylebone Cricket Club in its museum at Lord's."]}, {"page": "Richard Nyren", "response": ["Richard \"Dick\" Nyren (c.\u00a01734\u20131797) was an English professional cricketer who played first-class cricket during the 1760s and 1770s in the heyday of the Hambledon Club. A genuine all-rounder and the earliest known left-hander of note, Nyren was the captain of Hampshire (aka Hambledon) when its team included players like John Small, Thomas Brett and Tom Sueter. Although the records of many matches in which he almost certainly played have been lost, he made 51 known appearances between 1764 and 1784. He was known as the team's \"general\" on the field and, for a time, acted as the club secretary as well as taking care of matchday catering for many years.", "On 23 and 24 September 1771, Nyren captained Hambledon against Chertsey at Laleham Burway in what has become known as the \"big bat match\". When Thomas Brett objected to the wide bat used by Chertsey's Thomas White, Nyren supported him and the Hambledon players effected a change in the Laws of Cricket, formally recognised in the 1774 code, to limit the width of the bat to four and one quarter inches.Buckley, p. 56.Nyren, p. 156.Underdown, p. 117.", "An unusual feature of Nyren's career is that, in an age when \"given men\" were the norm rather than the exception in cricket teams, he was never recorded as playing for anyone other than Hambledon/Hampshire. The same applied to his bowling partner Thomas Brett. Scorecards began to be kept habitually from the 1772 season and Nyren was recorded in 48 first-class matches, plus some single wicket matches, from then until he retired in 1784.Haygarth, pp. 3\u201361.Ashley-Cooper, p. 177-180. The strength of the Hambledon/Hampshire team during Nyren's captaincy can be seen in its being rated the (unofficial) Champion County in 10 seasons: 1766\u20131771 inclusive, 1776\u20131777 inclusive, 1779 and 1783.", "Nyren was a bowling all-rounder who was, with Thomas Brett, one of \"the two principal bowlers\" in the early Hambledon team.Nyren, p. 55.

In September 1771, when Chertsey played Hambledon at Laleham Burway, Chertsey's Thomas White introduced a bat that was fully as wide as the wicket. He was not actually cheating because there was no limit on bat size at the time, rather he was probably making a point in order to force an issue because straight bats were still new, having been introduced in the 1760s, and it is believed that there was no standard. The Hambledon professionals objected and their senior bowler Thomas Brett wrote out a formal protest that was signed by himself, his captain Richard Nyren and senior batsman John Small, all three being professional players. Brett's action brought about a change in the Laws, as confirmed in 1774, whereby the maximum width of the bat was set at four and one quarter inches. This ruling remains intact. In May 1775, master batsman Small was involved in the incident which resulted in the introduction of the third (middle) stump in the wicket. The wicket in 1775 still consisted of two uprights and a crosspiece, as it had from time immemorial. In a single wicket match played at the Artillery Ground, the great Chertsey bowler Lumpy Stevens (another professional) beat Small at least three times only for the ball to pass through the wicket without disturbing it, and Small won the match for Hambledon. Like Brett before him, Stevens protested and his petition was granted soon afterwards, although research has discovered that the introduction of the third stump in practice was gradual and the two-stump wicket did continue in places for a number of years yet."]}, {"page": "The Cricketers of My Time", "response": ["| rowspan=\"3\" | Thomas Brett || align=\"center\" | 23 September 1832 || align=\"right\" | 55\u201358 "]}, {"page": "Thomas Brett", "response": ["Thomas Brett may refer to:", "* Thomas Brett (cricketer) (1747\u20131809), English cricketer", "* Thomas Brett (nonjuror) (1667\u20131743), English nonjuring clergyman", "* Thomas Brett (MP for Hastings) (died 1568), MP for Hastings (UK Parliament constituency)", "* Thomas Brett (MP for New Romney) (died 1638) for New Romney (UK Parliament constituency)"]}, {"page": "1771 to 1775 in sports", "response": ["* 1771 \u2014 the Chertsey v Hambledon match at Laleham Burway was enlivened by a furious dispute when Thomas \"Daddy\" White used an extra wide bat to completely obscure his wicket.

This match is retrospectively considered to be of first-cricket standard, and is considered to be the first century scored in first-class cricket. Two years later, in a match in which both previous record holders were also playing, James Aylward scored 167 runs for Hambledon (again playing as Hampshire) against an \"All England\" side. Minshull made the next highest individual score in the match, remaining 60 not out in All England's first innings, but Aylward's score, along with six scores of between 20 and 50 from his teammates, helped Hambledon to victory by an innings and 168 runs."]}]}}
