Noted for his pace and his accuracy, Brett was a leading wicket-taker in the 1770s and was lauded by John Nyren in The Cricketers of my Time. Writing half a century later, Nyren described Brett as \"beyond all comparison, the fastest as well as straitest bowler that ever was known\".", "link_mentions": {}}}
