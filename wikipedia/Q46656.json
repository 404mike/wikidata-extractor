She finished writing the book in 1983 and was persuaded to publish it by her editor James Hale. Parts of the book were based on Mary Wesley's early life; the house in Cornwall was based on Boskenna, the seat of the Paynter family, where Wesley spent much time as a young woman. After a coast guard fell to his death near Boskenna, Wesley suspected foul play and created a fictional version for her novel. Like Polly, Wesley worked for military intelligence during the war. The character of Oliver was based on her former boyfriend Lewis Clive while Max was based on Paul Ziegler (brother of Heinz Otto Ziegler), one of her friends whose parents were murdered in the Holocaust. Mary Wesley's sister quarrelled with her over the depiction of Helena and Richard Cuthbertson in the book, as she believed that they were based on their parents."]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 1932 Summer Olympics", "response": ["*Coxless pair - Lewis Clive,  Hugh Edwards  - Gold"]}, {"page": "British Battalion", "response": ["* Lewis Clive \u2013 Olympic gold medallist for rowing."]}]}}
