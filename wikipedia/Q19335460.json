During the 1910s, in the socially deprived area of Somers Town, north west London, Petty ran cookery demonstrations to working-class women to get them in the habit of cooking inexpensive and nutritious foods. Much of the instruction was done in the women's homes, allowing her to use their own limited equipment and utensils.\nPetty wrote on cookery, with works aimed at fellow social workers, and with a cookery book\u2014The Pudding Lady's Recipe Book, with Practical Hints (1917)\u2014and pamphlet aimed at the public. Both the pamphlet and book contain practical information on how to make and use a haybox. She was a broadcaster on food and budgeting in the late 1920s and early 1930s, on the 2LO radio station for the BBC, as part of the \"Household Talk\" series of programmes. From 1914 until the mid-1940s she toured Britain giving lecture-demonstrations on economical ingredients and cooking methods.", "link_mentions": []}}
