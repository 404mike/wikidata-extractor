Tullius Cicero, in 63 BC, the same year Octavian was born.Dio 54.28.3 places Agrippa's death in late March 12 BC, while Pliny the Elder 7.46 states that he died \"in his fifty-first year\". Depending on whether Pliny meant that Agrippa was aged 50 or 51 at his death, this gives a date of birth between March 64 and March 62. His family cognomen was the Latin form of Greek Agrippas, meaning \"wild horse\". A calendar from Cyprus or Syria includes a month named after Agrippa beginning on November 1, which may reflect the month of his birth. See Reinhold, pp. 2\u20134; Roddaz, pp. 23\u201326. in an uncertain location. His father was called Lucius Vipsanius.cf Pantheon inscription \"M\u00b7AGRIPPA\u00b7L\u00b7F\u00b7COS\u00b7TERTIVM\u00b7FECIT\" .

They had not been prominent in Roman public life.Velleius Paterculus 2.96, 127. According to some scholars, including Victor Gardthausen, R. E. A.
