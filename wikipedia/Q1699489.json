R\u00f6hl (born 31 May 1938) is a British historian notable for his work on Imperial Germany and European history.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wilhelm II, German Emperor", "response": ["On 8 June 1913, a year before the Great War began, The New York Times published a special supplement devoted to the 25th anniversary of the Kaiser's accession. The banner headline read: \"Kaiser, 25 Years a Ruler, Hailed as Chief Peacemaker\". The accompanying story called him \"the greatest factor for peace that our time can show\", and credited Wilhelm with frequently rescuing Europe from the brink of war. Until the late 1950s, the Kaiser was depicted by most historians as a man of considerable influence. Partly that was a deception by German officials. For example, President Theodore Roosevelt believed the Kaiser was in control of German foreign policy because Hermann Speck von Sternburg, the German ambassador in Washington and a personal friend of Roosevelt, presented to the president messages from Chancellor von B\u00fclow as messages from the Kaiser. Later historians downplayed his role, arguing that senior officials learned to work around him. More recently historian John C. G. R\u00f6hl has portrayed Wilhelm as the key figure in understanding the recklessness and downfall of Imperial Germany. Thus, the argument is made that the Kaiser played a major role in promoting the policies of naval and colonial expansion that caused the sharp deterioration in Germany's relations with Britain before 1914."]}, {"page": "Frederick III, German Emperor", "response": ["During an effort led, between 1879 and 1881, by the v\u00f6lkisch historian Heinrich von Treitschke and the court chaplain, Adolf Stoecker, to dis-emancipate German Jews,R\u00f6hl 1994, pp. 198\u2013199. the Crown Prince and Crown Princess were in opposition, Victoria writing that she saw \"Treitschke and his supporters as lunatics of the most dangerous sort\", and opining that Pastor Stoecker properly belonged in an insane asylum.R\u00f6hl 1994, p. 198. She went on to write that she felt ashamed of her adopted country because people like Treitschke and Stoecker \"behave so hatefully towards people of a different faith and another race who become an integral part (and by no means the worst) of our nation!\". Clad in the uniform of a Prussian field marshal Frederick, together with Victoria, attended a synagogue service in Berlin in 1880 to show support for tolerance in contrast to what Victoria called Treitschke's \"disgraceful attacks\". Shortly afterward, Frederick gave a speech denouncing the anti-Semitic movement in Germany as \"a shameful blot on our time\", adding that \"We are ashamed of the Judenhetze [agitation against Jews] which has broken all bounds of decency in Berlin, but which seems to flourish under the protection of the Court clerics.\" In 1881, Frederick and Victoria again attended a synagogue service, this time in Wiesbaden \"to demonstrate as clearly as we can what our convictions are\". Frederick followed this up by giving a speech in which he spoke out for \"poor, ill-treated Jews\" of Europe. Frederick's mother-in-law, Queen Victoria, wrote to thank him for his speech, saying she was proud that her daughter had married someone like him, but within Junker circles, Frederick was widely criticised for his actions in support of the Jews. Prominent among the Crown Prince's critics was his eldest son, Wilhelm, who called his father a weak, cowardly man controlled by his British wife and the Jews. Beyond Wilhelm, many of the \"reactionary and 'chauvinistic' circles in Germany\" had, in the words of the British historian John C. G. R\u00f6hl come to the \"...conviction that the Crown Prince and his liberal English wife were an alien, un-German force that must not be allowed to accede to the throne\"."]}, {"page": "Victoria, Princess Royal", "response": ["If her sons were sources of great concern, Vicky's daughters didn't usually cause problems. The only exception was Charlotte, the eldest of the princesses. A girl with slow growth and a difficult education, she was regularly prone to fits of rage during her childhood. Growing up, her health became delicate and, in addition to her capricious personality, she also revealed an irritable character. Today, several historians (like John C. G. R\u00f6hl, Martin Warren and David Hunt) defend the thesis that Charlotte suffered from porphyria as did her maternal ancestor King George III. This could explain the gastrointestinal problems, migraines and nervous crises that tormented the princess. The same historians believe that the headaches and skin rashes that Victoria treated with doses of morphine were also a consequence of porphyria, albeit in a weaker form than that suffered by Charlotte.John C. G. R\u00f6hl, Martin Warren and David Hunt: Purple Secret, London, Bantam Press 1999.", "* John C. G. R\u00f6hl: Kaiser, Hof und Staat \u2013 Wilhelm II. und die deutsche Politik, Munich, 1988."]}, {"page": "Houston Stewart Chamberlain", "response": ["In 1908, the Harden\u2013Eulenburg affair badly damaged Wilhelm's reputation when Wilhelm's and Chamberlain's mutual friend Eulenburg was exposed in the press as a homosexual. Since Eulenburg had been the Emperor's best friend since 1886, the scandal led to much gossip all over the Reich about whether Wilhelm and Eulenburg had been more than just best friends. Eulenburg was quite open about being gay when he was in the company of his closest friends, and he and Wilhelm had been the very best of friends for 22 years, leading the British historian John C. G. R\u00f6hl to conclude it was very unlikely that Wilhelm was ignorant of Eulenburg's sexual orientation as he claimed after Eulenburg was outed.R\u00f6hl (2004), pp. 61\u201362 After Eulenburg was exposed, the Kaiser wrote him a very cold letter saying that he could not stand the company of homosexuals, as such their friendship was now over and he never wanted to see or hear from Eulenburg again. Chamberlain was never as close to Eulenburg as Wilhelm was, and seemed genuinely shocked to learn of the allegations that Eulenburg was gay.Field (1981), p. 260 The Eulenburg affair played a role in Germany very similar to the Dreyfus affair in France, except that the victim in this case was the prominent anti-Semite Eulenburg. During the scandal, practically the entire v\u00f6lkisch movement came out in support of Eulenburg whom they portrayed as an Aryan heterosexual framed by false allegations of homosexuality by the Jews Max Bernstein and Magnus Hirschfeld.Domeier (2015), p. 169 The German journalist Theodor Wolff wrote in 1906 about Eulenburg's role as one of Germany's chief anti-Semites:", "In August 1914, he started suffering from a progressive paralysis of the limbs. At the end of the war, Chamberlain's paralysis had already befallen much of his body; his chronically bad health had reached its final stage. By the time World War I started in 1914, Chamberlain remained British only by virtue of his name and nationality. When the war started, Chamberlain tried to enlist in the German Army, but was turned down on the account of his age (then 58) and bad health.Field (1981), p.363 In August 1914, Chamberlain wrote a letter to his brother, the Japanologist Basil Hall Chamberlain, explaining why he had sided with his adopted country that read: \"No war has ever been simpler than this; England has not for a moment reduced her efforts to do everything humanly possible to bring it about and to destroy every peaceful impulse. ... Germany's victory will not be England's ruin; quite the contrary, it is the only hope for England's rescue from the total ruin in which she now stands. England's victory will be terrible for the whole world, a catastrophe.\"Field (1981), p. 352 The same month, Chamberlain published an essay celebrating Wilhelm II as an \"Aryan soldier-king\" and as a \"Siegfried\" who had embraced the \"struggle against the corroding poison of Jewry\".R\u00f6hl (2004), p. 207 Chamberlain went on to call the war \"a life-or-death struggle ... between two human ideals: the German and the un-German\". Accordingly, the Reich must \"for the next hundred years or more\" strengthen all things German and carry out \"the determined extermination of the un-German\". Chamberlain happily welcomed the war, writing in September 1914 to his friend Prince Max of Baden: \"I thank God that I have been allowed to experience these two exaltations\u20141870 and 1914\u2014and that I was both times in Germany and saw the truth with my own eyes.\"Field (1981), p. 381 In his 1914 essay, \"Whose Fault Is the War?\", Chamberlain blamed the war on France, Russia and especially Britain.Field (1981), p. 365 Chamberlain argued though St. Petersburg and Paris were both seeking war, it was London who had masterminded the war, and the French and Russians were just British puppets.Field (1981), pp. 365\u201366  Initially Chamberlain expected the war to be over by the end of 1914, and was very disappointed when that did not occur. In 1916 he also acquired German citizenship. He had already begun propagandising on behalf of the German government and continued to do so throughout the war. His vociferous denunciations of his land of birth, it has been posited,Adorno, Theodor W. (1985) \"On the Question: \"What is German?\", Levin, Thomas Y. (trans.) in New German Critique, No. 36. 1985. p.123 were the culmination of his rejection of his native England's capitalism, in favour of a form of German Romanticism akin to that which he had cultivated in himself during his years at Cheltenham. The British historian John C. G. R\u00f6hl wrote the war made the \"brutality in general and anti-Semitism in particular\" of people like the Kaiser and Chamberlain \"more intense\"."]}, {"page": "Alfred von Waldersee", "response": ["In 1882, Waldersee was chosen by Field Marshal Helmuth von Moltke the Elder as his principal assistant on the General Staff at Berlin with the rank of Generalquartiermeister. With this appointment, Waldersee was already seen as the likely successor of the octogenarian field marshal. On several occasions Waldersee accompanied Prince Wilhelm, the future Kaiser Wilhelm II, on trips abroad to represent the prince's grandfather, Kaiser Wilhelm I. Out of these trips grew a tenuous teacher-student relationship, but Waldersee was seen by Wilhelm's liberal parents Crown Prince Friedrich Wilhelm and Victoria, Princess Royal as \"anti-Semitic, narrowly zealous in religion, and reactionary... the quartermaster general was the personification of everything Wilhelm's parents most detested.\"Clarke, Christopher. Kaiser Wilhelm II. New York: Longman. 2000, p. 12   The British historian John C. G. R\u00f6hl wrote that Waldersee \"...seems to have suffered from some form of paranoid megalomania\" as Waldersee believed in a vast Jewish world conspiracy in which the \"entirety\" of Jews around the world were working for the destruction of the Reich."]}, {"page": "Wilhelm Maurenbrecher", "response": ["* John C.

Wilhelm II dismissed \"Iron\" Chancellor Otto von Bismarck and his Realpolitik system of treaties and agreements in 1890, replacing Bismarck's clear rule with a muddle and his foreign policies with a confrontational, expansionist Weltpolitik. The anti-imperialist Eulenburg became the most prominent member of Wilhelm II's entourage, having been promoted from a member of the diplomatic corps to an ambassador.Steakley, James D.

(New York: Meridian, New American Library).Tamagne, Florence A History of Homosexuality in Europe, 2003 page 17.  Like many others, Bismarck noticed that the nature of the relationship between Wilhelm II and Eulenburg could \"not be confided to paper\" and felt, alongside those others, that even these activities in the private sphere were not to be exposed to the public. Beyond that, the Ausw\u00e4rtiges Amt suffered what the British historian John C. G. R\u00f6hl called a \"culture of intrigue\" with German diplomats forever forming factions to plot against one another.R\u00f6hl, John. The Kaiser and his Court (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994) page 159 The two dominant factions in the early 20th century were the B\u00fclow-Eulenburg clique, headed by Bernhard von B\u00fclow and his close friend Eulenburg, who were rapidly eclipsing the faction headed by Friedrich von Holstein, the powerful director of the Political Department at the Ausw\u00e4rtiges Amt.R\u00f6hl, The Kaiser and his Court, pages 159-160 Holstein had known Eulenburg since June 1886 and had once been his ally when the two had plotted against Bismarck in 1889-1890, but starting around 1894, Eulenburg and Holstein had begun to come into conflict with each other. The close friendship between Eulenburg and the Kaiser meant that Holstein tended to lose his arguments with Eulenburg. As a trump card to destroy his rival Eulenburg, Holstein had contacted Maximilian Harden to inform him that Eulenburg was a homosexual.R\u00f6hl, The Kaiser and His Court, page 69.

France moved its main North Sea fleet to the Mediterranean. Britain moved one fleet from the Mediterranean, where it confronted Austria and Italy, to the North Sea where it confronted Germany and protected France from the German navy.  Berlin did not know what secret alliances London and Paris had reached, but feared for the worse.

The Tirpitz Plan was taking half the defence budget, and even so Britain maintained a dominance in naval power. The Germany army was the basis of its wartime strength, and pro-army advocates finally began to mobilize and demand a bigger budget.Jeremy Stocker, Architects of Continental Seapower: Comparing Tirpitz and Gorshkov (Routledge, 2020) ch 8. However, Germany had a smaller financial potential than Britain, in terms of tax base and borrowing ability. Furthermore the anti-war Social Democratic Party was now the largest party, and a major increase in defence spending was politically impossible.Niall Ferguson, The pity of war: Explaining world war I (Hachette UK, 2008) p 141.
