An \"uncompromising\" defender, he scored 24 goals in 491 league and cup appearances in a 16-year career in English football.\nHe began his career at Barnsley, making his debut for the club in the Premier League in January 1998. Barnsley were relegated at the end of the season, and he would stay on at the club to make a total of 212 league and cup appearances across six seasons, scoring eight goals. He signed with Sheffield United in July 2003 and was soon appointed club captain. He was named as the club's Player of the Year in 2004 and helped the club to secure promotion out of the Championship in 2005\u201306, though United's stay in the Premier League lasted only one season. He went on to score 16 goals in 279 league and cup appearances in nine seasons at Bramall Lane. He was sent off six times each for Barnsley and Sheffield United, holding the club record for red cards at both clubs.\nHe retired due to injury in July 2012, and went on to coach at Sheffield United, and served the club as caretaker-manager over two separate spells in 2013. He went on to join Chesterfield as first team coach in December 2015, and then joined Port Vale as a coach in March 2017.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "November 9", "response": ["*1977 \u2013 Chris Morgan, English footballer and manager"]}, {"page": "Sheffield United F.C.", "response": ["|2013|| Chris Morgan (acting)", "With United in the third tier once more, Danny Wilson was appointed as manager in June 2011, despite protests from United fans over his previous association with cross-town rivals Sheffield Wednesday. Wilson guided the club to the League One play-off final in his first full season in charge, only to lose to Huddersfield Town after a famous penalty shootout in which Huddersfield missed their first three penalties. Despite the club challenging for promotion the following season, a poor run of results led to Wilson's departure in April 2013, being replaced by Chris Morgan until the end of the season.", "After a long search for a new boss, former Scotland defender David Weir was appointed as Wilson's long-term replacement. Weir's tenure was short-lived however, as he was sacked in October of the same year, having won only one of 13 games in charge. After Chris Morgan had overseen the team for a brief time, Nigel Clough was appointed as Weir's permanent successor in October 2013. Clough guided the Blades to finish seventh in the table narrowly missing the play-offs after having been bottom of the table at the start of February and also led United to an FA Cup semi-final against Hull City which the Blades lost 5\u20133 after twice taking the lead in the first half. The following season saw Clough guide the Blades to fifth place in the league, thus qualifying for the play-offs and also led them to a first League Cup semi-final in 12 years, with the Blades ultimately losing to Tottenham Hotspur 3\u20132 on aggregate. United failed to gain promotion through the play-offs after losing to Swindon Town 2\u20131 in the first leg and drawing 5\u20135 in the second leg (7\u20136 on aggregate)."]}, {"page": "Barnsley F.C.", "response": ["|2000|| Chris Morgan"]}, {"page": "Penistone", "response": ["* Chris Morgan, footballer, defender.

He played regularly for the rest of the season and deputised as captain when Chris Morgan was unavailable. Having seen his penalty parried, Speed netted the rebound to score his first goal for United in a victory over Coventry City in March of that year. He went on to finish the season on three goals for United, scoring both goals in a 2\u20131 home victory over Bristol City in the penultimate game of the 2007\u201308 season.

Former teammates and colleagues were invited to the match; there was a minute's applause before the match; players warmed up in specially designed shirts; players and coaches wore black armbands; the match day programme was dedicated to Speed; Sheffield United captain Chris Morgan and former Sheffield United and Welsh international Rob Page laid wreaths on pitch side just before kick-off. Sheffield United striker Ched Evans, the only player to be managed by Speed at both club and international level, paid tribute to Speed during the match; Evans revealed a message under his shirt after scoring his first goal which read: \"Rest in peace Speedo.\" Evans stated after the match \"I was a man on a mission.

The appointment was greeted with some dissatisfaction amongst the fans, as approximately 400 gathered outside Bramall Lane to voice their anger at the appointment, particularly considering his links as a former player and manager of bitter rivals Sheffield Wednesday. Disapproving chants against his appointment could be heard throughout the announcing press conference. Wilson's subsequent statements suggested that he already felt the pressure resultant from having crossed the divide. As part of the restructure of the Blades managerial setup, captain Chris Morgan was promoted to a player-coach position. Morgan had played under Wilson during his earlier years at Barnsley. A couple of weeks later, Wilson appointed former Sheffield United player Frank Barlow as his assistant."]}, {"page": "Kevin Blackwell", "response": ["After the Blades 2\u20130 defeat at home to Charlton Athletic on 1 March 2008, Blackwell was critical of his team's performance, describing it as \"insipid\" and \"embarrassing\" in an interview on BBC Radio Sheffield. Since then, the team went on a five-game unbeaten run drawing at Ipswich Town and winning four in a row against Plymouth Argyle, Coventry City, Norwich City and Barnsley to improve his chances of landing the job permanently. The 4-match winning streak ended to a 3\u20131 defeat against Preston North End. The team responded with a 3\u20130 victory against Leicester City, James Beattie scored his first hat-trick of the club in that game. In his first Sheffield derby as manager, the Blades showed much improved passion levels as they came from 2\u20130 down against Sheffield Wednesday to draw 2\u20132 with Beattie scoring a stunning free kick very late in the game to rescue a point. This was followed by a 2\u20131 victory at Burnley, with another superb Beattie free kick, and a 2\u20130 victory over Hull when United went down to ten men after skipper Chris Morgan was sent off. In the penultimate game of the season, the Blades won 2\u20131 against Bristol City with Speed scoring a brace. With one game remaining in the season, United remained in with a chance of making the play offs, a considerable achievement after the Robson era. Sheffield United lost 3\u20132 on the last day of the season against Southampton and finished ninth, four points off the final playoff place."]}, {"page": "Chris Morgan", "response": ["Chris Morgan may refer to:", "*Chris Morgan, alias of wrestler Chris Kanyon", "*Chris Morgan (ecologist) British-born ecologist, conservationist, and TV host", "*Chris Morgan (footballer) (born 1977), English football player", "*Chris Morgan (journalist) (1952\u20132008), journalist working for The Sunday Times (UK)", "*Chris Morgan (politician), British politician", "*Chris Morgan (powerlifter) (born 1973), powerlifting champion", "*Chris Morgan (writer), film screenwriter and comic writer", "*Chris Morgan, former guitarist for the blues rock band, Canned Heat", "*Chris Morgan (rower) (born 1982), Australian Olympic rower in the Beijing 2008 Olympics"]}, {"page": "Mick Wadsworth", "response": ["In October 2013 Wadsworth was appointed as temporary first team coach at Sheffield United to support caretaker manager Chris Morgan."]}]}}
