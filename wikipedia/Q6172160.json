Howerd is the slave Lurcio (pronounced Lurk-io); his bumbling old master Ludicrus Sextus (Max Adrian, then Wallas Eaton), the promiscuous wife is Ammonia (Elizabeth Larner), their daughter Erotica (Georgina Moon) and their virginal son Nausius (Kerry Gardner). Other regulars are Senna the Soothsayer (Jeanne Mockford) who constantly warns of impending death and destruction and, in series one, Plautus (Willie Rushton) a semi-godlike figure, making pithy comments from a location somewhere between the clouds and Mount Olympus. Guest stars included several actresses from the Carry On film series, including Barbara Windsor, Wendy Richard and Valerie Leon."]}, {"page": "Dixon of Dock Green", "response": ["| Jeanne Mockford || Miss Lucas || 1964\u20131965 || 11 || 19"]}, {"page": "The Longest Night (Only Fools and Horses)", "response": ["| Jeanne Mockford"]}, {"page": "List of Are You Being Served? characters", "response": ["* Jeanne Mockford (\"The Father Christmas Affair\", as the Umbrella Customer)"]}, {"page": "Denville Hall", "response": ["*Jeanne MockfordCatholic Association of Performing Arts (CaAPA): Newsletter \u2013 December 2018"]}, {"page": "Up Pompeii!
