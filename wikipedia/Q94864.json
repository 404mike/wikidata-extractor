Paul Simpson's shot struck the post and as the Millwall goalkeeper Kasey Keller failed to gather the rebound, Cowans struck low to score his first goal in 19 months.  Derby dominated the second half and doubled their lead when Seth Johnson scored on 60 minutes having been sent clear by Marco Gabbiadini; the match ended 2\u20130.  The second leg was played three days later at the New Den in London and was marred by two pitch invasions by Millwall supporters.  Gabbiadini put Derby ahead on 16 minutes after converting a cross from Mark Pembridge.  Johnson scored the second goal for Derby six minutes later.  Soon after fans ran onto the pitch and were confronted by mounted police officers; the players left the pitch while numerous arrests were made.

Greg Berry reduced the deficit with a header on the hour mark, making it 3\u20131.
