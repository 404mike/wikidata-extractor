So I have turned to the past. The great advantage of this, for a writer of my temperament at least, is that one is freed from a great deal of surface clutter. One is enabled to take a remote period and use it as a distant mirror (to borrow Barbara Tuchman\u2019s phrase), and so try to say things about our human condition \u2013 then and now \u2013 which transcend the particular period and become timeless.\" A film version directed by James Dearden, starring Charles Dance, Helen Mirren and Ben Kingsley, as the title character, was released in 1988."]}, {"page": "Roger Deakins", "response": ["|James Dearden"]}, {"page": "Cherie Lunghi", "response": ["Educated at London's Arts Educational School, Lunghi played Hedvig in The Wild Duck and Alice in Alice in Wonderland on BBC radio while still at school.

Schiff was hired to write it as his first movie script, after the film's producers had rejected commissioned screenplays from the more experienced screenwriters and directors James Dearden (Fatal Attraction), Harold Pinter, and David Mamet.According to Gale, in Sharp Cut, Pinter was paid for his work but he asked to have his name removed from the credits, as permitted by his contract.: \"In November 1994 Pinter wrote that 'I've just heard that they are bringing another writer into the Lolita film. It doesn't surprise me.' Pinter's contract contained a clause to the effect that the film company could bring in another writer, but that in such a case he could withdraw his name (this was also the case with [the film] The Remains of the Day\u2014he had insisted on this clause since the experience with revisions made to his Handmaid's Tale script\" (352).Hudgins observes: \"During our 1994 interview, Pinter told [Steven H.] Gale and me that he had learned his lesson after the revisions imposed on his script for The Handmaid's Tale, which he has decided not to publish. When his script for Remains of the Day was radically revised by the James Ivory\u2013Ismail Merchant partnership, he refused to allow his name to be listed in the credits\"; Hudgins adds: \"We did not see Pinter's name up in lights when Lyne's Lolita finally made its appearance in 1998. Pinter goes on in the March 13 [1995] letter [to Hudgins] to state that 'I have never been given any reason at all as to why the film company brought in another writer,' again quite similar to the equally ungracious treatment that he received in the Remains of the Day situation. He concludes that though he never met Nabokov, 'indeed I knew \"Lolita\" very well and loved it.'\u00a0\" (125). Hudgins also observes that Schiff was brought in after the efforts by Dearden (October 21, 1991), Pinter (September 26, 1994), and Mamet (March 10, 1995) and that Schiff \"has no previous scripts to his credit\" (124).In his 2008 essay published in The Pinter Review, Hudgins discusses further details about why \"Pinter elected not to publish three of his completed filmscripts, The Handmaid's Tale, The Remains of the Day, and Lolita,\" all of which Hudgins considers \"masterful filmscripts\" of \"demonstrable superiority to the shooting scripts that were eventually used to make the films\"; fortunately (\"We can thank our various lucky stars\"), he says, \"these Pinter filmscripts are now available not only in private collections but also in The Pinter Archive at the British Library\"; in this essay, which he first presented as a paper at the 10th Europe Theatre Prize symposium, Pinter: Passion, Poetry, Politics, held in Turin, Italy, in March 2006, Hudgins \"examin[es] all three unpublished filmscripts in conjunction with one another\" and \"provides several interesting insights about Pinter's adaptation process\" (132).
