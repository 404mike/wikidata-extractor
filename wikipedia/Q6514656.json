Last time, they went to enjoy the occasion as nobody expected them to win, but this time they went to get promoted. The play-off final would also mark the fifth time that Bradford faced Northampton Town during the season after playing them twice in the league and twice in the FA Cup. The writing was on the wall early doors as the Bantams dominated everything in the early stages of the game and Bradford scored first in the 15th minute after James Meredith's cross found Garry Thompson on the right hand side, Thompson then chipped the ball back across the face of the goal and James Hanson delicately headed the ball over Northampton keeper Lee Nicholls to give Bradford a 1\u20130 lead. The Bantams continued to press forward and their dominance was once again rewarded as Kyel Reid found Nathan Doyle from a cross who in turn put his own cross into the box for Rory McArdle to power a header into the back of the net to give the Bantams a 2\u20130 lead in the 19th minute. Once again Reid crossed the ball to find the in form Thompson who headed it back across the face of the goal, this time it was Nahki Wells who got on the end of it and blasted the ball into the goal to put the Bantams 3\u20130 up after only 28 minutes. Northampton brought on top scorer Adebayo Akinfenwa just after half-time but even he couldn't provide Northampton with a goal. The 3\u20130 win gave Bradford City their first promotion in 14 years and also lifted them out of League Two after seven consecutive years in the Football League's bottom divisions."]}, {"page": "2013 FA Community Shield", "response": ["|GK ||13|| Lee Nicholls"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Wigan Athletic F.C. season", "response": ["| Lee Nicholls"]}, {"page": "Lee Nichols", "response": ["* Lee Nicholls, footballer"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Northampton Town F.C. season", "response": ["| 21 || GK || style=\"text-align:left;\" |  Lee Nicholls", "| 6 August 2012 || GK ||  || Lee Nicholls || Wigan Athletic || 30 June 2013 || "]}, {"page": "2013 Football League Two play-off Final", "response": ["The match was refereed by Keith Stroud in front of a crowd of 47,127.
