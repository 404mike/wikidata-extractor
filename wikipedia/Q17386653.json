The VicRail orange and silver \"teacup' livery used on passenger rolling stock was replaced in August 1983 by an orange and grey livery. The white and green V/Line logo was launched on Sunday 21 August 1983 by the transport minister, Steve Crabb, at Spencer Street station, with special trains running to Essendon to mark the occasion. This was altered when on 1 July 1989 the Transport (Amendment) Act took effect, merging the State Transport Authority with the Metropolitan Transit Authority to form the Public Transport Corporation (PTC). The relationship between the country V/Line and suburban \"The Met\" brands was blurred, with the Sprinter trains delivered in the 1993-1995 period appearing in PTC colours but with both PTC and V/Line logos."]}, {"page": "1988 Victorian state election", "response": ["| align=\"left\" bgcolor=\"FF8D8D\" |Steve Crabb"]}, {"page": "Members of the Victorian Legislative Assembly, 1988\u20131992", "response": ["|| Hon Steve Crabb || Labor || Knox || 1976\u20131992"]}, {"page": "Members of the Victorian Legislative Assembly, 1985\u20131988", "response": ["|| Hon Steve Crabb || Labor || Knox || 1976\u20131992"]}, {"page": "Members of the Victorian Legislative Assembly, 1982\u20131985", "response": ["|| Hon Steve Crabb || Labor || Knox || 1976\u20131992"]}, {"page": "Members of the Victorian Legislative Assembly, 1979\u20131982", "response": ["|| Steve Crabb || Labor || Knox || 1976\u20131992"]}, {"page": "Electoral district of Knox", "response": ["| Steve Crabb"]}, {"page": "Members of the Victorian Legislative Assembly, 1976\u20131979", "response": ["|| Steve Crabb || Labor || Knox || 1976\u20131992"]}, {"page": "New Deal (railway)", "response": ["VicRail pushed hard for the new timetables to be introduced by October 1981 so they would operate throughout the summer before the 1982 Victorian election.
