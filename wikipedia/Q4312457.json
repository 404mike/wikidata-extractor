Johnson's motivation for talking about academic freedom at this time of anti-war student unrest was largely to prevent any interference with MIT's various military-funded research laboratories.

Knight concludes that Chomsky's subsequent position on Faurisson 'did not imply any sympathy towards Holocaust denial.
