She became his pupil immediately. Chopin does not mention her until 1844.  That she was a talented pianist was evident from Chopin's remark to her, \"One day you\u2019ll play very, very well.\"  Towards the end of his life he even entrusted one of his own pupils, Vera Rubio, to her tutoring.  In 1844 he dedicated his two Nocturnes, Op. 55 to her.  She also expressed a desire to learn the cello, and so Chopin referred her to his collaborator, Auguste Franchomme."]}, {"page": "Edward Hugh Lindsay Sloper", "response": ["#redirect Lindsay Sloper"]}, {"page": "Joseph Dando", "response": ["A concert in Willis's Rooms in which he played Beethoven's Violin Sonata Op. 96 in G major, accompanied by the pianist Lindsay Sloper, was reviewed: \"Beethoven's grand sonata was finely played....

He is a thoroughly classic performer, surpassed by few in his interpretation of such music as that of Mozart, Beethoven, Mendelssohn and Spohr.\""]}]}}
