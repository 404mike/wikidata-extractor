She was entirely self-educated in botany, and corresponded with numerous professional and amateur colleagues, who contributed to her scientific development. She published on bryology, lichenology and vascular plants. The University of Dundee awarded her an honorary doctorate in 1969 for her work as a plant taxonomist and soon after, she was chosen to receive the Linnaean Society's H. H. Bloomer Award for 1973. As well as pursuing her botanical interests, she took charge of the Duncan family's Scottish estate.", "link_mentions": {}}}
