On the first pickup night, Major Geoffrey Appleyard and Andr\u00e9 Desgrange set off from the submarine towards the shore. Desgrange's canoe was holed and damaged on the rocks and had to be abandoned. They searched in vain for the Savanna team, but in fact they were on the wrong beach. By prior agreement, another pickup was attempted four nights later. As the two remaining canoes were being prepared a large wave washed over the submarine and one of the canoes was lost; only Appleyard's canoe remained. Appleyard pulled away from the submarine in the heavy swell only to be capsized into the freezing water several times before he made it away from the submarine. Appleyard paddled three miles to the shore and, in a desperate bid to make contact quickly, he ran up and down the shoreline shouting and waving his torch until, at last, he saw an answering flashlight. With time running out \u2013 Tigris would dive at 0300 hours regardless \u2013 the Savanna team faced a stark choice: there was only room in the canoe for two passengers and there was no time for a second trip. Le Tac chose to stay ashore. Appleyard took Berg\u00e9 and Forman, they struggled through the heavy sea just reaching the submarine in time.
