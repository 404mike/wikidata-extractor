Gostick was involved in the Canadian social credit movement and later published far-right and antisemitic material over the course of 50 years, including the Canadian Intelligence Service and On Target! and numerous books and pamphlets.Gostick influenced several figures on the Canadian far right. Jim Keegstra got most of his reading material through his membership in Gostick's League. He also collaborated with John Ross Taylor and was a mentor to Paul Fromm and an associate of Patrick Walsh, a fellow traveller who worked as research director at the CLR. He was also associated with former Member of Parliament John A. Gamble, who worked with Gostick as Canadian leader of the World Anti-Communist League in the 1980s.David Lethbridge, an anti-fascist activist and Communist Party member, described the CLR and Gostick as a \"danger\" because they soft-pedaled an essentially \"fascist\" message.
