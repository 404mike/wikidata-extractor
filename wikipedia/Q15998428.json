In 1919 he was appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Liberal Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Health for Scotland, John Pratt. During his first stint in parliament he shared a house in Westminster with Liberal MP Colin Coote, who was later to write a biography of Elliot. In the same period Elliot met Blanche \"Baffy\" Dugdale niece and biographer of Arthur Balfour, whose Zionism Elliot came to support. Elliot also undertook scientific research during parliamentary recesses; his friend John Boyd Orr invited him to work at the Rowett Research Institute. In the Commons, Elliot supported the Government of Ireland Act 1920, which established the Partition of Ireland into Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland as an attempt at Home Rule. At the pivotal Carlton Club meeting on 19 October 1922, he supported the Conservative Party's ongoing coalition government of the Lloyd George ministry, but the Party favoured ending its involvement."]}, {"page": "Pratt", "response": ["* John Pratt (disambiguation), several people", "** John Pratt (footballer) (born 1948), English footballer", "** John Pratt (judge) (1657\u20131725), Lord Chief Justice of England and interim Chancellor of the Exchequer", "** John Pratt (soldier) (1753\u20131824), United States Army officer", "** John Pratt, 1st Marquess Camden (1759\u20131840), British politician", "** John Pratt (1931\u20132001), birth name of author John Winton", "** John Pratt (Canadian politician) (1894\u20131973), Manitoban politician", "** John Pratt (Liberal politician) (1873\u20131952), Scottish Liberal politician", "** John Pratt (cricketer) (1834\u20131886), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Lloyd George ministry", "response": ["| John Pratt", "| John Pratt"]}, {"page": "Glasgow Cathcart (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| John Pratt"]}, {"page": "Linlithgowshire (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|  John Pratt", "*Liberal: John Pratt"]}, {"page": "Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland", "response": ["|John Pratt"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1918 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|John Pratt "]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1900\u20131918)", "response": ["|John Pratt"]}, {"page": "John Pratt", "response": ["John Pratt may refer to:", "*John Pratt (judge) (1657\u20131725), Lord Chief Justice of England and interim Chancellor of the Exchequer", "*John Pratt (soldier) (1753\u20131824), United States Army officer", "*John Pratt, 1st Marquess Camden (1759\u20131840), British politician", "*John Pratt, 3rd Marquess Camden (1840\u20131872), British politician", "*John Pratt, 4th Marquess Camden (1872\u20131943), British peer", "*John Pratt (died 1835), hanged for sodomy", "*John Pratt (Archdeacon of Calcutta) (1809\u20131871), British clergyman and mathematician, developer of the theory of isostasy", "*John Pratt (cricketer) (1834\u20131886), English cricketer", "*John Pratt (Liberal politician) (1873\u20131952), Scottish Liberal politician", "*John Pratt (Canadian politician) (1894\u20131973), Manitoban politician", "*John Pratt (Provost of Southwell) (1913\u20131992), Anglican archdeacon and provost", "*John Winton or John Pratt (1931\u20132001), English naval officer, author and obituarist", "*John Pratt (footballer) (born 1948), English footballer", "*John Pratt (Archdeacons of St David's), Welsh Anglican priest", "*John Pratt-Johnson (1929\u20132015), Canadian ophthalmologist", "*Robert John Pratt (1907\u20132003), Canadian architect, comedian, and politician"]}, {"page": "John William Pratt", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Pratt (Liberal politician)"]}, {"page": "List of Lords Commissioners of the Treasury", "response": ["**John Pratt", "**John Pratt", "**John Pratt", "**John Pratt", "**John Pratt", "**John Pratt", "**John Pratt"]}, {"page": "1913 Linlithgowshire by-election", "response": ["thumb|260px|Victorious Liberal candidate John Pratt", "*Forty-year-old former Fabian, John Pratt was selected to defend the seat in the Liberal interest. He was Warden of Glasgow University Settlement, 1902\u201312 and was a Member of Glasgow Town Council, 1906. However, initially, the West Lothian Liberal Association had sought Robert Brown, the Provost of Dalkeith as their candidate. He was Secretary of the Midlothian miners and one of the few miners leaders in Scotland who were sympathetic to the Liberals. The Liberal Party had previously sought after Brown as their candidate for the 1912 Midlothian by-election where he eventually stood as a Labour Party candidate, finishing bottom of the poll. Brown once more turned down the Liberal offer and the Liberals chose Pratt.John MacLean's Scottish Notes, Justice 18 October 1913, page 6 ", "*Scottish Liberal Party: John Pratt"]}, {"page": "Frances Gordon", "response": ["The socialist Tom Anderson wrote to the Glasgow Evening Times about the case which quoted from the medical assessment Dr. Mabel Jones conducted on Gordon on her release:\"I saw her (Miss. Gordon) at midnight on July 3. Her appearance was appalling, like a famine victim: the skin brown, her face bones standing out, her eyes half shut, her voice a whisper, her hands quite cold, her pulse a thread, her wrist joints slightly swollen, stiff, and painful, the breath most offensive, and the contents of the bowel beyond control.\" Reduced to the nearest point of death possible. Such treatment is barbarous and it is performed by civilised men because of a political offence, on women. Is it possible for the race to fall any lower? I don't think so. On 16 July 1914, Lord Hugh Cecil, John Pratt and Maurice Healy all raised the question of Frances Gordon's treatment in the House of Commons. The then Secretary for Scotland (Mr. Mckinnon Wood) replied that:\"On admission she was at once put to bed and treated as a sick prisoner. Her condition required the administration of enemata, and I have no reason to doubt that in the circumstances the doctor treated her case properly and humanely. The doctor states that there was very little difference in her appearance when she was discharged...that she made no complaint of pain; that she was able to converse, and did converse freely with the doctor's assistant who accompanied her on the journey to Glasgow; that it is true that the breath was offensive, but that it had been offensive from the date of admission; and that generally the statement as to her condition is exaggerated.\"Lord Hugh Cecil challenged Mr. McKinnon Wood on whether in his answer he was guided wholly by the opinion of the medical officer whose action is called in question, or whether he has any independent opinion. To which Mr. McKinnon Wood responded:\"I must be guided by the report of the medical officer who was responsible for this matter....the reason [that these women prisoners have in all recent cases been sent to Perth prison] is that we have there doctors who are accustomed to deal with those cases and are thoroughly skilled.... I think the only thing I can add to what I have said already in the reply which dealt with most of the details of the woman's condition, is to say that she was able to walk to the cab and from the cab to the railway station, and in the railway train she was able to sit up and, as the doctor puts it, admire the scenery.\"Gordon had been given a Hunger Strike Medal 'for Valour' by WSPU."]}]}}
