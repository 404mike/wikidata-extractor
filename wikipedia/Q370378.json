He joined West Ham United in 1962, and spent the next five years with the \"Hammers\". He returned to Crystal Palace in 1967, before joining Fulham the following year. He emigrated to South Africa in 1969 and spent four years with Durban City. He went on to coach in South Africa for many years, and turned out as a player for Hellenic in 1980.\nHe won seven caps for the England under-23 team, before scoring eight goals in eleven full England internationals between 1961 and 1965.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Geoff Hurst", "response": ["Hurst missed the start of 1961\u201362 pre-season training due to his cricketing commitments, but went on to make 24 appearances at left-half, and scored his first goal for the club in a 4\u20132 victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers in December 1961. However, he again missed pre-season training the following summer and was dropped after proving to be unfit during the opening game of the 1962\u201363 season. In September of that season Greenwood tried playing Hurst as a striker after deciding that the defensive side of his game was a weakness for the young midfielder. He formed a successful partnership with Johnny Byrne and went on to score 13 goals in 27 First Division games whilst Byrne scored nine in 30 games in the 1962\u201363 season. In the summer of 1963 he joined the club on their pre-season tour of New York, and greatly benefited from playing against top quality players from clubs across the world in the International Soccer League, a friendly tournament.", "The club's success won them a place in the European Cup Winners Cup for the 1964\u201365 season.

Czechoslovakian side AC Sparta Prague awaited in the second round, and West Ham progressed with a 3\u20132 aggregate victory despite the absence of Moore. Despite beating Swiss team FC Lausanne-Sport 6\u20134 on aggregate in the quarter-finals, Hurst had still not registered a goal in the competition as he was played in a withdrawn role behind Johnny Byrne so as to strengthen the midfield. In the semi-finals, West Ham defended a 2\u20131 home win over Spanish club Real Zaragoza with a 1\u20131 draw at La Romareda to claim a place in the 1965 European Cup Winners' Cup Final against TSV 1860 M\u00fcnchen at Wembley.
