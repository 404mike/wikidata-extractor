By 1660 the tithes belonged to Roger Palmer (1634\u20131705), who became earl of Castlemaine by virtue of his wife Barbara (n\u00e9e Villiers) being the mistress of Charles II. Since Castlemaine did not acknowledge Barbara's five children by Charles (and perhaps other lovers) the tithes of Llanbadarn passed to his nephew James. His daughter Catherine married Giles Chichester of Arlington Court, Devon. They were both Catholics, which forced them to pay heavy taxes.This section owes much to Gerald Morgan; Gerald Morgan, Ceredigion: A wealth of History (Gower, Llandysul, 2005). See Sir Alexander Bruce Palmer Chichester, Bart., History of the Family of Chichester from AD 1086 to 1870 (printed for the author, J.C. Hotten, 1871). Not all subsequent members of the Chichester family were absentees, however; Sir John Chichester, 1st Baronet, of Arlington Court, was High Sheriff of Cardiganshire in 1831, when he was living in Llanbadarn Fawr. But the income was lost to the church.In the time of King James I, in \"Sir Richard Price, Knt. v. The Freeholders and tenants of the Lordship of Llanbadarn Fawr\", National Archives, Dispositions taken by Commission, Records of the King's Remembrancer, E 134/Jas1/Misc4, we read of the custom of suit and grist and the ancient mills of the Lordship, as well as to the rectory of Llanfihangel Gwalter and the chapel of Llangynfelyn. On 21 June 1603 the manor of Llanbadarn was granted to Sir Thomas Jones and his sons Henry and Thomas. Afterwards it changed hands many times; Frank Lewis, \"The history of Llanbadarn Fawr, Cardiganshire in the later middle ages\" (1938) 13 Transaction and archaeological record: Cardiganshire Antiquarian Society 15\u201340, at p. 34; Calendar of State Papers, Domestic, 1603\u20131610 (HMSO, London, 1857), p. 15. The tithes were not especially valuable; in the eighteenth century the vicarage was worth only \u00a327 annually;Frank Lewis, \"The history of Llanbadarn Fawr, Cardiganshire in the later middle ages\" (1938) 13 Transaction and archaeological record: Cardiganshire Antiquarian Society 15\u201340, at p. 34. in the fourteenth century they were comparatively small compared with the income from the lands then owned by the church \u2013 which passed with the manor or lordship,See, for instance, the indenture of 4 December 1635, which assigned the residue of a 99 year lease in the \"manor or lordship\", late in tenure of Sir Thomas Jones, Sir Henry Jones and Thomas Jones, and \"late parcel of the monastery of Vale Royal\", with reservation of all forests and royal mines, to Lewis Evans and David Evans; Francis Green (ed), Calendar of Deeds and Documents: vol 1 The Coleman Papers (National Library of Wales, Aberystwyth, 1921), D.D.110, p. 26. On the lands of the manor and of the chapels and rectories formerly belonging to Vale Royal, see the edited transcript of an inquisition of 1598; W.J. Lewis, \"The manor of Llanbadarn Fawr\" (1964) 5(1) Ceredigion: the Journal of the Cardiganshire Antiquities Society 47\u201353. on the Dissolution of the Monasteries, to the lay owners.In later years both the Pryses of Gogerddan and the Powells of Nanteos were lords of the manor. In 1657 Sir Richard Pryse leased out the manor; Francis Green (ed), Calendar of Deeds and Documents: vol 1 The Coleman Papers (National Library of Wales, Aberystwyth, 1921), D.D.117, pp. 28\u20139. The Pryses appear to have acquired an interest in the manor by 1640, as in that year Richard Pryse and Lewis Evans (the same to whom was assigned the manor in 1635), by deed poll, released the equity of redemption in a mortgage on the manor; Calendar of Deeds and Documents, D.D.111, p. 26. By 1810 the manor belonged to the Duke of Leeds, and by 1895 the Powells of Nantoes; Sir Samuel Rush Meyrick, The History and Antiquities of the county of Cardigan. Collected from the few remaining documents which have escaped the ravages of time, as well as from actual observation (Longmans, London, 1810); Kelly's Directory of Monmouthshire & South Wales, 1895 (1895). By the nineteenth century the lands of the manor were held by socage; Mrs Margaret Powell, the last of the Powells of Nanteos, who died in 1952, had continued to hold courts leet at Nanteos until her death."]}, {"page": "John Chichester", "response": ["*Sir John Chichester, 1st Baronet, of Arlington Court (c. 1794\u20131851), English Whig and Liberal politician"]}]}}
