He first set sail from Britain in 1972 at the age of 25.\nActon was born and raised in Coleridge, Cambridge, England. Without any sailing experience, he departed in a used 18' 4\" bilge-keel sailing boat for which he paid the modest sum of \u00a3400. The boat was a Caprice, a Robert Tucker design originally named Super Shrimp but referred to by Shane simply as Shrimpy.  Later Shane was accompanied for much of the voyage by his girlfriend, Iris Derungs, a photographer from Switzerland. He sailed westabout through the Panama Canal, circling the globe and returning to England as a local celebrity eight years later.  The voyage is chronicled in his book Shrimpy: A Record Round-the-World Voyage in an Eighteen Foot Yacht.In 1984, he set off on a second voyage from England to Central America via the French canals, the Mediterranean and the Canary Islands and wrote a book of this voyage Shrimpy sails again.He lived his later years near Golfito, Costa Rica, and died of lung cancer on February 25, 2002 in Cambridge, aged 55.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Acton (surname)", "response": ["* Shane Acton, English sailor known for circumnavigating the globe"]}]}}
