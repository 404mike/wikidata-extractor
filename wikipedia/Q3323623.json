Around this time, two prominent modern rock groups each covered a Damned song: Guns N' Roses recorded \"New Rose\" for their \"The Spaghetti Incident?\" (1993), while The Offspring covered \"Smash It Up\" for the Batman Forever soundtrack (1995). Both cover versions enjoyed major label distribution and created more exposure to the Damned sound, sometimes to a younger audience unfamiliar with the group."]}, {"page": "Pewsey", "response": ["* Moose Harris (born 1967 in Devizes), bass guitarist"]}, {"page": "New Model Army (band)", "response": ["  bar:Moose     text:Moose Harris"]}, {"page": "Moose (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Moose Harris (born 1967), British bass player"]}]}}
