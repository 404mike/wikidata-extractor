The couple had two children, a son, Archibald in 1874  and a daughter, Ellen in 1876. Only a month after the birth of Ellen in 1876, his wife, Ellen, died suddenly of sepsis and Mahomed and his family moved in with his uncle, Horatio, also a widower, in Seymour Street near Portman Square, London. In 1879 Mahomed married Ada Chalk, the younger sister of his first wife. As such a marriage was not legal under English law, the couple married in Switzerland. They lived at 12 St Thomas' Street, close to Guy's Hospital. The couple had two daughters, Dorothy in 1880, and Janet in 1881, and a son, Humphry in 1883. In 1884 the family moved from St Thomas' Street into a six-story Georgian house at 24 Manchester Square. Sadly, later that year, Mahomed contracted typhoid fever, presumably from a patient at the London Fever Hospital, where he was working. He died on 22 November 1884 from an intestinal hemorrhage and a perforated intestine. He was buried at Highgate Cemetery. On his death a  subscription was set up to assist his family and several notable physicians including Sir William Gull, Sir Samuel Wilks, Sir James Paget and Elizabeth Garrett Anderson contributed. His oldest son, Archibald, later became a doctor, and in 1914 Archibald and the rest of the family changed their name to Deane (possibly acknowledging Frederick's grandfather's name, Deen) to lessen the impact of the xenophobia and racial prejudice associated with the outbreak of the World War I. Frederick's second wife, Ada Deane, died in New York in 1940. Of Frederick's children, Archibald Deane died in 1948, Ellen died in 1954, Janet in died 1955, Humphry died in 1955  and Dorothy died in 1962."]}, {"page": "Harveian Oration", "response": ["*1879 Samuel Wilks"]}, {"page": "Hodgkin lymphoma", "response": ["In 1856, Samuel Wilks independently reported on a series of patients with the same disease that Hodgkin had previously described.
