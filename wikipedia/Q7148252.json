Communicative planning draws heavily on Habermas's idea of communicative rationality, and proposes an approach to planning in which diverse stakeholders in the planning process participate in deliberative conversations, work to resolve conflicts in their values and priorities, and collectively create a consensus plan. In this process, planners serve to facilitate this deliberation and offer technical expertise when called for."]}, {"page": "List of Newcastle University people", "response": ["* Patsy Healey - professor"]}, {"page": "Healey (surname)", "response": ["* Patsy Healey (born 1940), professor at Newcastle University, England"]}, {"page": "1999 Birthday Honours", "response": ["* Professor Patsy Healey.
