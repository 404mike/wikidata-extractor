Saurin accused Starr and Kennedy of lying to the Bishop of Beverley, assault and imprisonment. and the court heard of the Bishops enquiry which was held to be a \"parody of justice\".

Saurin was awarded fifty pounds in damages. The Daily Telegraph made a  special publication on the \"Inner Life of the Hull Nunnery Exposed\" to cover the trial."]}]}}
