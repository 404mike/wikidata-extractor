In publishing it with John Hatchard of Piccadilly, she assured it and the ten other books published with him a \"social distinction\" not attached to her other publications.Cutt, p. 60. The Fairchild Family tells the story of a family striving towards godliness and consists of a series of lessons taught by the Fairchild parents to their three children (Emily, Lucy and Henry) regarding not only the proper orientation of their souls towards Heaven but also the right earthly morality (envy, greed, lying, disobedience, and fighting are immoral). The overarching narrative of the tale includes a series of tract-like stories which illustrate these moral lessons. For example, stories of the deaths of two neighbourhood children, Charles Trueman and Miss Augusta Noble, help the Fairchild children to understand how and why they need to look to the state of their own hearts.Vallone, p. 84. The faithful and \"true\" Charles has a transcendent deathbed experience, suggesting he is saved; by contrast, the heedless, disobedient Augusta burns up while playing with candles and is presumably damned.Vallone, p. 86. Unlike previous allegorical literature with these themes, such as Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, Sherwood domesticated her story\u2014actions in the children's day-to-day lives, such as stealing fruit. These are supremely important because they relate directly to their salvation.Cutt, p. 66. Each chapter includes thematically linked prayers and hymns, by Philip Doddridge, Isaac Watts, Charles Wesley, William Cowper, Ann and Jane Taylor, and others.Cutt, 77."]}, {"page": "Hatchards", "response": ["Hatchards is a branch of Waterstones, and claims to be the oldest bookshop in the United Kingdom, founded on Piccadilly in 1797 by John Hatchard.

David Thompson was admitted in 1777 and apprenticed to the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company for seven years in 1784, and had a river in the Rocky Mountains named after him in recognition of his contribution to the mapping of Western Canada. More recently he was commemorated on a Canadian postage stamp. One of David Thompson\u2019s contemporaries and pupils of the school was John Hatchard, founder in 1797 of the oldest bookshop in England, still operating in Piccadilly. Another interesting association of the school was Ho Chi Minh, the founder of modern Vietnam, who was a labourer at the hospital in 1913, whilst a student in London.

With nearby Devonport and Saltash, Plymouth at this time has been called a notable centre of \"ultra-Evangelicalism\". The conflict was largely fostered by John Hatchard. He was an evangelical, vicar of St Andrew's Church, Plymouth, and son of John Hatchard (1769\u20131849) the publisher. From 1848 he sought to undermine Henry Phillpotts, the bishop of Exeter, attacking William Maskell, domestic chaplain to Phillpotts and involved in the Gorham case. The effect was to suggest Phillpotts was a supporter of the Tractarians. That was a misconstruction of the bishop's wish to stay within a strict interpretation of the rubrics in liturgical matters."]}]}}
