The first was Trevelyan's most experimental work, weaving the narratives of three very different Londoners, none of whom ever encounter the other and all of whom come to tragic ends. In her review for The Times Literary Supplement, Leonora Eyles wrote, \"There is pity in this book and something of horror: it is as though the author had looked on human nature and turned away with a mixture of disgust and compassion from what she has seen. But, as always, Miss Trevelyan's genius and her sincerity make her book one that the reader cannot lay aside.\" William's Wife followed a housemaid, Jane Atkins, from the day of her wedding to William Chirp, a greengrocer whose miserly control distorts her attitude and behavior and eventually lead her to live as a recluse gleaning her food from the waste of London markets. Writing in The Times Literary Supplement, Eyles proclaimed that, \"Miss Trevelyan's scope of human experience makes her own of the most important novelists of our day, and there are signs in this last book that she is choosing from among more human and usual types for her characters than she has done before.\""]}, {"page": "List of women writers (A\u2013L)", "response": ["*Leonora Eyles (1889\u20131960, England), feminist wr. & nv."]}, {"page": "Madeline Linford", "response": ["In the aftermath of the First World War, the Manchester Guardian helped raise money for a Quaker mission to help war victims, with whom Linford travelled to see how the money was being spent.
