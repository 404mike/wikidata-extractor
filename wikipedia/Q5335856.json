From the resulting corner he headed past Eddie Blackburn to make him an instant hero (fastest debut goal). He ended the 1977\u201378 season with six goals and was top-scorer in 1978\u201379 with 16 as Stoke won promotion to the First Division. With Stoke making a slow start in 1980\u201381 Durban moved O'Callaghan, who had lost his place to the younger Lee Chapman, to centre back filling in for the injured Denis Smith. He adapted well and his partnership with Mike Doyle saw Stoke in to a final mid-table position of 11th. He began the 1981\u201382 season in defence before reverting to forward in January 1982 where he scored five goals and he again scored five in 1982\u201383. He struggled under Richie Barker's long ball tactics in 1983\u201384 and he handed in a transfer request but Barker was sacked and replaced by Bill Asprey and so O'Callaghan stayed at Stoke. Under Asprey Stoke staged a relegation survival but in 1984\u201385 Stoke were awful and well on their way to an embarrassing relegation so O'Callaghan moved on to Oldham Athletic for \u00a330,000 after making 294 appearances for Stoke scoring 47 goals. In the first match of the 1985\u201386 he suffered an adductor muscle strain which caused him to retire on the advice of doctors."]}, {"page": "List of foreign Allsvenskan players", "response": ["*Eddie Blackburn \u2013 Halmstad \u2013 1987"]}]}}
