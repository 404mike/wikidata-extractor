He was one of the heirs of the bank Hope & Co. without having been a banker himself but rather a famous collector of the arts and more particularly precious gems.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Thomas Hope (banker, born 1769)", "response": ["In 1784, when young Thomas was fifteen, his father died unexpectedly in the Hague just after purchasing Bosbeek on the grounds of Groenendaal Park, the house that was to house his large art collection. He shared his art collection as part of the Hope & Co. partnership with his cousin Henry Hope. This cousin was just completing work on his Villa Welgelegen further up the road. Missing his father and grandfather, and preferring the company of his mother and brothers to his uncles in Amsterdam, Thomas did not enter the family business. Instead, at the age of eighteen, he began to devote more and more of his time to the study of all the arts, especially the architecture of classical civilisation, during a series of tours to other countries. During his grand tour through Europe, Asia and Africa, Hope interested himself especially in architecture and sculpture, making a large collection of artefacts which attracted his attention (e.g. the Hope Dionysus).", "Thomas Hope returned to the Hague when his mother died in 1794. That same year, the three Hope brothers, along with their elder cousin Henry Hope, who was the executor of their mother's will, fled to London before the oncoming French revolutionary forces marching on Amsterdam. In their haste to remove their art collections to the safety of London, the Hopes left their houses, summer homes and parks full of wall decorations, furniture, and heavy statuary. Later, after the French occupation, Thomas's younger brother Adrian Elias would return to live at Groenendaal Park full-time and expand the gardens. Cousin Henry always hoped to return to his home, Villa Welgelegen, but he died in 1811 before King Willem restored Dutch sovereignty in 1814.", "The Hopes established a residence in London in Duchess Street, off Portland Place. Experienced from his extensive travel, Thomas Hope enjoyed the cosmopolitan atmosphere of London, while his younger brothers missed their home in the Netherlands. He decorated the house in a very elaborate style, from drawings made himself with each room taking on a different style influenced by the countries he had visited. In essence, the combined art collections of Hope & Co., his parents and Henry Hope gave him the opportunity to further research the various art he had studied during his travels and he began to write books on decoration and furniture, the first of its kind. In the same way he had done with Villa Welgelegen, Henry Hope opened the house as a semi-public museum. The house museum included three vase galleries filled with Ancient Greek and South Italian vases the Hopes purchased from Sir William Hamilton's second vase collection."]}, {"page": "Hope & Co.", "response": ["In 1762 when the nephews Jan (John) and Henry Hope (1736\u20131811) joined Hopes, the name was changed to Hope & Co. At that time the Englishmen John Williams and Pierre Cesar Labouchere were also partners in the firm totalling 26 people. In that year they expanded the offices in Amsterdam to house Henry and Jan in Keizersgracht 448. Thomas lived in the buildings next door, 444\u2013446.  Zachary's son Archibald (1747\u20131821) became a member of Dutch Parliament, regent of the West Indian Company (WIC), and owned the former palace 'Lange Voorhout' in the Hague.", "Pierre Labouchere played an important role in negotiations with France, handling most of the financing for Holland with that country. Adrian was a member of Dutch Parliament and the Amsterdam City Council. Unlike banks today, the partners of Hope & Co. mixed up their private business with public business and the bank's business. Letters in the archive touch on many subjects at once. The earliest letters go back to the 1720s and are addressed to Thomas and Adrian Hope. A particularly rich portion of the archive is the correspondence in the period 1795\u20131815, when Henry Hope was forced to leave the Netherlands and set up offices in London. The regular correspondence between the Amsterdam and London branches give important insights into trade negotiations of the period and how they were done.", "The day-to-day running of Hope & Co. in those days was in the hands of Thomas' American nephew Henry Hope (1736\u20131811), who did business with different countries, including Sweden, Poland, Russia, Portugal, Spain, France and the United States. In 1804 Hope & Co. issued shares to finance the Louisiana Purchase, thanks to the negotiations of Henry Hope and Francis Baring.", "Though primarily interested in trade deals from the start of their activities, the Hope brothers expanded their interests to longer-term investments in land and the arts. During the 18th century Hope & Co. set up a profit sharing agreement for the partners to reduce the risk of bankruptcy of the entire firm due to the indiscretions of one member, as happened in the case of rival banking house Clifford in 1772. In order to become partner in the profit sharing scheme, the member had to learn the special Hope & Co. bookkeeping method developed by Adrian Hope, who had assisted filing the Clifford bankruptcy. According to personal investments, ownership of the art (and the rest of the investment portfolio) was spread evenly. Thus one art collection was jointly owned by several men. John Hope's son Thomas Hope (1769\u20131831) helped to build this joint collection and later inherited a large portion of it due to the ownership rights built up by his father and grandfather. When it became clear that his own sons would not continue the banking business, after Henry Hope's death he divided his portion finally from the rest. Henry Hope's portion was divided among his sister's family and his American cousins. He died childless in 1811.", "Adriaan van der Hoop (1778\u20131854), who had been active with the firm throughout the French occupation and who became full partner in Hope & Co. in 1814, on the death of Henry Hope inherited the Amsterdam portion of the investments, together with fellow partner in Amsterdam Alexander Baring, who then chose land over art and moved to America. When Adriaan van der Hoop died, he was worth 5 million guilders. His art collection went to the city of Amsterdam that created a museum to house the collection after his death. Among the 250 17th and 18th century works in this collection were  'The Jewish Bride' by Rembrandt, 'Woman in Blue Reading a Letter' by Vermeer, 'Moederzorg' by Pieter de Hooch and 'De molen bij Wijk bij Duurstede' by Jacob van Ruisdael."]}, {"page": "Jan Hope", "response": ["John Hope (14 February 1737 \u2013 20 April 1784), also known as Jan Hope, was a Dutch banker, the son of Thomas Hope and Margaretha Marcelis. A first cousin of Henry Hope, he was father of Thomas Hope, and a follower of the Scottish Enlightenment. He is best known today for his Groenendaal Park in Heemstede, Netherlands, where he summered from 1767 to his death in 1784.", "The Hope cousins were responsible for building up the parks Groenendaal in Heemstede and the Hout in Haarlem, the two largest city parks in the area. After Jan Hope died in the Hague, the boys were brought up by their mother, who kept the Heemstede property Bosbeek and received visitors there to view the gardens with the many follies and her large art collection. After she died, her sons became the wards of Henry Hope, and when he fled the country in 1794, he took the boys and as much art they could carry to London. The Heemstede and Haarlem estates were left in the hands of Henry Hope's ward John Williams Hope, as was the Amsterdam banking office. Later only Adrian Elias returned to the Netherlands, spending the rest of his life working on the gardens of Groenendaal and Bosbeek."]}, {"page": "Henry Hope (disambiguation)", "response": ["Henry Hope was a merchant banker.", "Henry Hope may also refer to:", "*Henry Hope (Isle of Man lieutenant governor), lieutenant governor of the Isle of Man from 1773 to 1775", "*Henry Hope (Quebec lieutenant governor) (c. 1746\u20131789), British Army officer and uncle of the Royal Navy officer", "*Henry Hope (Royal Navy officer) (1787\u20131863), nephew of the British Army officer and lieutenant governor", "*Henry Hope (politician) (1912\u20131965), Australian politician"]}]}}
