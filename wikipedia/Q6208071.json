In 1996, his first full year as a Senior, Dooher helped Tyrone win the Ulster Senior Football Championship. Tyrone then advanced to play Meath in the All-Ireland semi-final, but were defeated. Dooher was one of several Tyrone players, along with Ciaran McBride, Jody Gormley, Chris Lawn and Peter Canavan who suffered injuries at the hands of what many Tyrone fans perceived as heavy-handed tactics by Meath. Meath defender, Martin O'Connell stood on Dooher's head while he had been felled. During the half-time interval, Dooher had to receive staples in his head, and played the rest of the game heavily bandaged. Despite this, he won the Ulster GAA Writers Player of the Year Award, at the age of just 20."]}, {"page": "History of the Tyrone county football team", "response": ["The Tyrone Seniors went through a relatively dry patch in the early nineties (although the standard of Ulster Football had developed immeasurably \u2013 by 1994, three different Ulster teams had won the All-Ireland four times in a row), however the Under 21 team was making waves.
