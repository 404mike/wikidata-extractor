It is divided into six chapters by different authors, covering the period 400 to 1500 AD, each of which has either a northern or southern Europe focus. Reviewers welcomed the editor's decision to have only six tightly-focussed chapters rather than the many divisions of other works, and felt that the structure of the book worked well, sufficient in itself as a history of the European medieval period and giving the reader enough background to explore the subject in more depth in other works. Despite the non-traditional structure, however, the book was criticised as perhaps too conservative in its perspective and neglecting a number of areas of growing importance in historical enquiry such as the role of women.", "The book was first published, in hardback, by Oxford University Press in 1988 under the editorship of George Holmes,The Oxford illustrated history of Medieval Europe / edited by George Holmes.
