This suited his \"marksman-type\" shooting style; it also freed up a hand that could be used to hang onto the aircraft, adding stability for more accurate fire, as well as greater safety for the observer.Woodman 1989  p. 51 In any case there was no need to \"design\" or \"fabricate\" a standard Lewis gun spare part!"]}, {"page": "Hans Imelmann", "response": ["His first known military service was as a Fokker Eindekker pilot for one of the early ad hoc fighter units, Kampfeinsitzerkommando (Combat Single-Seater Command) Metz, in 1916.
