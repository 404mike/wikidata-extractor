His rounds of 68-70-72 (-6) at the April 2012 final qualifier placed him on the Europro tour for the fourth consecutive year.  In 2021 Gallagher is scheduled to play on the TartanPro Tour and EuroPro Tour.  He opened the 2021 seasons with a 13th-place finish at the Montrose Links Masters.\nGallagher's most prolific amateur victory came at the 2007 Scottish Amateur Championship which was played at Prestwick Golf Club in Ayrshire.

He also finished 2nd in the 2005 Amateur Championship, defeating 19-year-old sensation Lloyd Saltman in the semi-final.\nGallagher reached as high as 14th in the World Amateur Golf Ranking.
