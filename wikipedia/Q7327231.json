Many of them proceeded to have distinguished careers elsewhere in journalism and British public life, and became the mainstay of the paper's own editorial strengths until the 1990s. The first such 'direct recruit' was (the future leading British economist) Andrew Shonfield; the second was (later Sir) William Rees-Mogg who went on, via The Sunday Times, to edit The Times in 1967 following its acquisition by Roy Thomson. Other FT Oxbridge recruits included the future Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson. The FT's distinctive recruitment policy for Fleet Street journalists was never popular with the National Union of Journalists and ceased in 1966 following the recruitment of Richard Lambert from Oxford, himself a future Editor of the FT. Meanwhile, Pearson had bought the paper in 1957. Over the years the paper grew in size, readership and breadth of coverage. It established correspondents in cities around the world, reflecting a renewed impetus in the world economy towards globalisation. As cross-border trade and capital flows increased during the 1970s, the FT began international expansion, facilitated by developments in technology and the growing acceptance of English as the international language of business. On 1 January 1979 the first FT (Continental Europe edition) was printed outside the UK, in Frankfurt; printing in the U.S. began in July 1985. Since then, with increased international coverage, the FT has become a global newspaper, printed in 22 locations with five international editions to serve the UK, continental Europe, the U.S., Asia and the Middle East.", "Lex boasts some distinguished alumni who have gone on to make careers in business and government\u2014including Nigel Lawson (former Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer), Richard Lambert (CBI director and former member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee), Martin Taylor (former chief executive of Barclays), John Makinson (chairman and chief executive of Penguin), John Gardiner (former chairman of Tesco), David Freud (former UBS banker and Labour adviser, now a Conservative peer), John Kingman (former head of UKFI and a banker at Rothschild's), George Graham (RBS banker), Andrew Balls (head of European portfolio management at PIMCO) and Jo Johnson (former Conservative Member of Parliament for Orpington).", ":1991: Richard Lambert"]}, {"page": "Catherine Ashton", "response": ["In January 2017, Ashton became Chancellor of the University of Warwick, succeeding Sir Richard Lambert and becoming Warwick's first female chancellor."]}, {"page": "List of Balliol College, Oxford people", "response": ["* Richard Lambert"]}, {"page": "Confederation of British Industry", "response": ["* Sir Richard Lambert (1 July 2006 \u2013 30 January 2011)"]}, {"page": "Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)", "response": ["* Richard Lambert (June 2003 \u2013 March 2006)"]}, {"page": "Cambridge Computer Lab Ring", "response": ["The association was mentioned by Richard Lambert in the Lambert Review of Business-University Collaboration as an example of how \"universities, departments and faculties should develop their alumni networks in order to build closer relationships with their graduates working in the business community.\""]}, {"page": "Lambert Review", "response": ["The Lambert Review of Business-University Collaboration was a report by Richard Lambert published by Her Majesty's Treasury in the United Kingdom in 2003, which made \"a series of recommendations aimed at smoothing out the path between Britain\u2019s strong science base and the business community\" [HM Treasury 2003a].
