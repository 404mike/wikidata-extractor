During the First World War he served on the Western Front, commanding a machine gun unit. He gained promotion quickly, advancing to the rank of major by the end of the war. He also received a number of notable decorations. Later, Harcourt served during the Russian Civil War before emigrating to Australia in 1929. Following this, he worked as a public servant in Tasmania before the outbreak of the Second World War when he joined the Australian Army and subsequently went on to serve in the Australian commandos, taking part in the fighting in New Guinea and Borneo.\nFollowing the end of the war, Harcourt retired from the military and returned to working for the Tasmanian government. He died in 1970 at the age of 75.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2/6th Commando Squadron (Australia)", "response": ["On 6 June 1942, Major Harry Harcourt assumed command of the company. An Englishman by birth, but a naturalised Australian, he had had considerable experience serving with the British Army in the First World War, in the Russian Civil War and in India before he had settled in Tasmania. Although 47 years old, he was also an accomplished boxer, having been a champion in the Services competition while serving in the British Army, and was, according to author Syd Trigellis-Smith, renowned for his \"...physical fitness, boundless energy and love of front-line service\".Trigellis-Smith 1992, p. 5. Harcourt set upon the task of preparing the company, although initially he too was frustrated in his efforts by the problem with insufficient training supplies and equipment. Nevertheless, through the rest of June and into July, the training was intensified and all ranks received basic infantry training (as some were not yet infantry trained), and they became proficient in fieldcraft, signalling and demolitions and a number of field exercises were carried out to test their skills.Trigellis-Smith 1992, pp. 5\u201310.", "* Major Harry Harcourt, DSO & Bar, MC (June 1942\u00a0\u2013 August 1943)Harcourt was later appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1955 for services to the Australian community as a civilian. He also later received the US Silver Star for his actions during the Buna campaign when the squadron worked closely with the Americans. Among the British awards that he received during his time in the British Army, he received a number of foreign awards including the Order of St Valdimir, the Order of St Stanislaus, the French Croix de Guerre and Legion d'Honneur and was Mentioned in Despatches three times. He had achieved his majority by age 23 and had served in the Royal Dublin Fusiliers and been attached to the Machine Gun Corps.

Indeed, some 400 to 500 men of the Australian Imperial Force (AIF)\u2014who were in England awaiting repatriation to Australia following the end of the war\u2014initially indicated a willingness to join, but nowhere near as many actually enlisted. All Australians who volunteered were discharged from the AIF and re-enlisted in the British army as private soldiers for a period of one year. This was necessary because the dominions had already indicated that they were not interested in providing forces for the intervention. Ultimately about 150 Australians enlisted to serve in the NRRF, most of them recruited by Major Harry Harcourt. The Australians mainly served in the 45th Battalion and the 201st Machine Gun Battalion under Sadlier-Jackson, although some may also have served in the 46th Battalion. Despite being enlisted in the British Army the Australians wore uniforms of the AIF and were formed into two mainly Australian companies in the 45th Battalion."]}, {"page": "Harry Gladwyn Harcourt", "response": ["#REDIRECT Harry Harcourt"]}, {"page": "Land Warfare Centre (Australia)", "response": ["The training centre draws its lineage from the Jungle Training Centre that was formed in November 1942 in response to the requirement to train troops for jungle combat in the South West Pacific Area during World War II.. Under the command of Colonel Alex MacDonald, who had previously commanded the Darwin Mobile Force, the centre grew out of the Guerilla Warfare School that had been established earlier at Foster, Victoria.. Located in the Gold Coast hinterland below the Beechmont plateau that stretches towards Tamborine Mountain, the establishment was located amidst thick rainforest and steep, razor-back country.. Staffed by instructors that had experienced combat\u00a0\u2013 mostly in the Middle East, initially, but then in New Guinea as the war progressed.\u00a0\u2013 upon creation the centre consisted of a number of detachments including the Reinforcement Training Centre, the Independent Company Training Centre and the Tactical School. As the demand for specialised jungle warfare training grew with Australia's increased involvement in the Pacific, the centre was expanded until it consisted of about 2,000 trainees organised into eight training companies; each week a total of 500 personnel marched out to join the infantry battalions fighting in the New Guinea campaign having completed a four-week course. In addition, the Commando Training Battalion was formed to provide reinforcements for the Australian commando units, while an officer training wing focused upon delivering specialised platoon-level training for officers over the course of a six-week program. After May 1943, the centre began to contract as its need declined, although it continued to train large numbers of soldiers under experienced senior instructors such as Major Harry Harcourt.. It was finally disbanded in 1946 following the conclusion of hostilities."]}]}}
