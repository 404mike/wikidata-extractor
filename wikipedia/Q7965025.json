Beginning in the 1860s with much promise in comic plays, classics, Victorian burlesque, and as a versatile singer in opera and operetta, Fisher seemed headed for lasting stardom alongside his wife Lottie Venne. His career was limited, however, by his struggle with alcoholism, ending in the 1880s, and he died at age 44. Gustave Slapoffski described Fisher as \"probably the finest comic opera tenor the English stage has ever known\".\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tita in Thibet", "response": ["Tita in Thibet was written as a vehicle for the music hall star Kate Santley.
