In June they signed to Mercury Records, where Dexys remained until their 1987 breakup.  Dexys' first single for Mercury, \"Show Me\", produced by Tony Visconti. was released in July 1981 and reached No.\u00a016 in the UK.  The label switch was followed by a session for Richard Skinner's BBC Radio 1 show in which the band previewed tracks that would be reworked later on Too-Rye-Ay. Wynne was sacked by the group at this point, to be replaced by Mick Gallick (whom Rowland gave the stage name \"Giorgio Kilkenny\") on bass.  Music journalist Paolo Hewitt commented about this version of Dexys: \"Dexys wouldn't make a record unless they thought it was great. And they wouldn't play a gig unless they thought they were gonna be great.\""]}, {"page": "Closer (Joy Division album)", "response": ["At the time of release, Sounds critic Dave McCullough wrote that there were \"dark strokes of gothic rock\" on Closer. He described the album as \"breathtaking rock music, a peak of current peaks, a sharing of something that's in [...] others at this time, but at the same time defining those black notions and leaving them unmatched.\" Writing for Smash Hits, Alastair Macaulay described the album as an \"exercise in dark controlled passion\" and wrote that its music \"stands up on its own as the band's epitaph\". Writing for Melody Maker, Paolo Hewitt described the album as \"probably some of the most irresistible dance music we'll hear this year [and] a far cry for sure from the almost suffocating claustrophobic world of the debut album,\" adding that \"the best (and most subversive?) rock music has always dealt head-on with emotions and thought rather than clich\u00e9d, standardised stances; that's what makes Closer and Joy Division so important.\""]}, {"page": "Steve Marriott", "response": [" In a 1984 interview with NME reporter Paolo Hewitt on the subject of leaving the band, Marriott said \"You grow apart for Christsakes. You're talking about people living together from the ages of seventeen to twenty-two and that's a growing up part of your life and we got to hate each other, no doubt about it. We didn't speak to each other for fucking years. Maybe ten years.", "*Paolo Hewitt, John Hellier (2004). Steve Marriott - All Too Beautiful....

It's a walk down all the streets, all the places, all the people and all the souls that rock has ever visited, excited, cried for and loved.\" Rolling Stone critic Paul Nelson deemed it \"a rock & roll milestone\" and said it possesses \"weighty conclusions, words to live by\" regarding \"the second acts of American lives\", conclusions \"filled with an uncommon common sense and intelligence that could only have come from an exceptionally warmhearted but wary graduate of the street of hard knocks\". The River was voted the second best album of 1980 in the Pazz & Jop, an annual poll of American critics nationwide, published by The Village Voice. Robert Christgau, supervisor and rock critic, wrote of Springsteen, \"All the standard objections apply\u2014his beat is still clunky, his singing overwrought...but his writing is at a peak, and he's grown into a bitter empathy. These are the wages of young romantic...\" In The New Rolling Stone Record Guide (1983), Dave Marsh called The River \"by far Springsteen's most mature work, and arguably his most consistent\". According to Jon Pareles of The New York Times, The River was the beginning of 1980s heartland rock. In 2003, Rolling Stone ranked it at number 250 on their list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, then was re-ranked at number 253 in the 2012 revised list."]}, {"page": "Robin Friday", "response": ["After retiring, Friday moved back to London and returned to work as an asphalter and decorator. Soon after Friday left Cardiff, Reading manager Maurice Evans was presented with a petition, signed by 3,000 supporters, requesting that he attempt to re-sign Friday. Evans contacted Friday and told him: \"If you would just settle down for three or four years, you could play for England\". Friday replied with the question \"How old are you?\", and after Evans answered, continued: \"I'm half your age and I've lived twice your life\". Evans reflected, \"You may well be right\". Friday trained with Brentford during the 1978\u201379 pre-season, but after regaining his fitness suddenly changed his mind and stopped coming to training. He married for a third time in 1980, but was divorced again within three years. After a short time living back with his parents in Acton, Friday's family secured him a housing association flat in the area. He served a prison sentence during the 1980s for impersonating a police officer and confiscating people's drugs, and was found dead in his Acton flat on 22 December 1990 at the age of 38, having suffered a fatal heart attack.

James Masterton wrote it was the band's most diverse album, presenting an \"at times random blend\" of progressive rock, avant-garde and synthpop music. Describing the album's sound overall, journalist Michael Booth called the album a \"cool pop/jazz/classical mix, lightened by flutes, harps and orchestral arrangements,\" while Dave Goodwin felt the album had a jazz feel overall, particularly on \"The Gardener of Eden.\" Paul Lester, meanwhile, felt the usage of piano, synths and strings presented a \"European melancholy.\" Smash Hits magazine described the album as combining \"dious, mannered 'soul' style music\" with tongue-in-cheek indulgent parts and \"the odd classic song.\"Smash Hits June 1988", "Several writers have placed Confessions of a Pop Group within different contexts, both socially and within Weller's career. Writer Paolo Hewitt wrote that the album was Weller's attempt to obtain complete musical freedom, \"not answering to anyone,\" describing it as \"the strangest record Weller ever involved himself in.\" Liberal politics magazine the New Statesman found the album to provide proof that left-leaning bands in Britain have \"at last grasped the nettle\" and begun using a subversive \"counter-language.\" Reflecting on the album, John Reed felt the album coincided with the passing of political idealism within pop music, and captured the period perfectly, writing: \"As the country entered a major recession, and a year on from the failed Red Wedge initiative, Weller painted a vivid picture of a bleak, hopeless world, his previous idealism replaced by pessimism and personal regrets of hollow one-night stands, of fraught relationships and feelings of guilt and shame. Coinciding with the death of political idealism in pop, this was arguably Weller at his most honest and, yes, soulful."]}, {"page": "Philip John", "response": ["In 2009, Philip, with longtime collaborators actor/producer Jonathan Owen and screenwriter Dean Cavanagh, co-produced SVENGALI, a satire on the music industry, released as a series of nine web virals on YouTube and also available as free downloads from iTunes.

Paolo Hewitt, a music critic and journalist, has written or been involved with several other publications about the Small Faces and other high-profile music groups including The Jam. John Hellier runs a fanzine and website dedicated to Marriott and the Small Faces.  Although much of the book could be said to be written in a fan type way, it is not biased in the subject's favour.  The authors stick to the facts and confidently and sensitively approach the sometimes less than complimentary aspects of Marriott's personality and do not pull punches, as to have done any less would be doing Marriott and his fans a disservice. For example, Marriott, after many years of substance abuse, became quite schizophrenic. At his very worst often after alcohol and drug binges and several days with no sleep, he was said to become a violent alter-ego, Melvin the bald-headed wrestler. Also documented is Marriott's lifelong naturally hyper and generally good-natured, cheeky, mischievous nature that sometimes gradually manifested into mania and spitefulness.", "Music journalist Paolo Hewitt has written several notable rock biographies, including those on Small Faces, Oasis, The Jam and Paul Weller.

In another NME article, Paolo Hewitt hailed Ji as \"a varied collection of great songs\" and \"probably the best testament yet to the so-called British funk movement.\" Billboard editor Leo Sacks named Ji his third favourite album of 1982, while Enrique Fernandez named it his fifth favourite."]}]}}
