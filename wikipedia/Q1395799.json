Fanthorpe have all shown an interest in Old English poetry. In 1987 Denise Levertov published a translation of C\u00e6dmon's Hymn under her title \"Caedmon\" in the collection Breathing the Water. This was then followed by Seamus Heaney's version of the poem \"Whitby-sur-Moyola\" in his The Spirit Level (1996) Paul Muldoon's \"Caedmona's Hymn\" in his Moy Sand and Gravel (2002) and U. A. Fanthorpe's \"Caedmon's Song\" in her Queuing for the Sun (2003). These translations differ greatly from one another, just as Seamus Heaney's Beowulf (1999) deviates from earlier, similar projects. Heaney uses Irish diction across Beowulf to bring what he calls a \"special body and force\" to the poem, foregrounding his own Ulster heritage, \"in order to render (the poem) ever more 'willable forward/again and again and again.'\""]}, {"page": "List of poets", "response": ["*U.

The New Generation movement flowered in the 1990s and early 2000s, producing poets such as Don Paterson, Julia Copus, John Stammers, Jacob Polley, David Morley and Alice Oswald.  A new generation of innovative poets has also sprung up in the wake of the Revival grouping, notably Caroline Bergvall, Tony Lopez, Allen Fisher and Denise Riley.Don Paterson, \"The Dark Art of Poetry\": T.S.
