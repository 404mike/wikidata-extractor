He was born at Little Parndon, Essex and died at Rayne, also in Essex.\nHemming played three matches subsequently judged to be first-class for Cambridge University in May 1848, appearing as a tail-end batsman to little effect but enjoying great success as a bowler: he took 21 wickets in his three games, including two returns of six wickets in an innings. Full statistics are not available for these games and neither his batting nor his bowling style is known. There is no record of any other cricket appearances, either in first-class or minor cricket.", "link_mentions": {}}}
