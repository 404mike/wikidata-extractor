Born to a Mancunian business family, Schuster was educated at St. George's School, Ascot and Winchester College before matriculating at New College, Oxford in 1888 to read history. After graduation, he joined the Inner Temple with the aim of becoming a barrister, and was called to the Bar in 1895. Practising in Liverpool, Schuster was not noted as a particularly successful barrister, and he joined Her Majesty's Civil Service in 1899 as secretary to the Chief Commissioner of the Local Government Act Commission.\nAfter serving as secretary to several more commissions, he was made Permanent Secretary to the Lord Chancellor's Office in 1915. Schuster served in this position for 29 years under ten different Lord Chancellors, and with the contacts obtained thanks to his long tenure and his work outside the Office he became \"one of the most influential Permanent Secretaries of the 20th century\". His influence over decisions within the Lord Chancellor's Office and greater Civil Service led to criticism and suspicions that he was a \"power behind the throne\", which culminated in a verbal attack by the Lord Chief Justice Lord Hewart in 1934 during a session of the House of Lords. Schuster retired in 1944 and was elevated to the peerage. Despite being officially retired he continued to work in government circles, such as with the Allied Commission for Austria and by using his seat in the House of Lords as a way to directly criticise legislation.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1956", "response": ["* June 28 \u2013 Claud Schuster, 1st Baron Schuster, British civil servant (b. 1869)"]}, {"page": "Baron Schuster", "response": ["#REDIRECT Claud Schuster, 1st Baron Schuster "]}, {"page": "Claud Schuster", "response": ["#REDIRECT Claud Schuster, 1st Baron Schuster"]}, {"page": "St George's School, Ascot", "response": ["*Claud Schuster, 1st Baron Schuster"]}, {"page": "1956 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 28 June \u2013 Claud Schuster, 1st Baron Schuster, civil servant (born 1869)"]}, {"page": "List of Old Wykehamists", "response": ["*  Claud Schuster, 1st Baron Schuster, Permanent Secretary to the Lord Chancellor 1915\u20131944Wainewright, 1907. p. 424"]}, {"page": "Lord Schuster", "response": ["#REDIRECT Claud Schuster, 1st Baron Schuster"]}, {"page": "Claud", "response": ["*Claud Schuster, 1st Baron Schuster (1869\u20131956), British barrister, Permanent Secretary to the Lord Chancellor's Office"]}]}}
