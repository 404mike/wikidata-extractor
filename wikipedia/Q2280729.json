He again did not stay long though, and was appointed as manager at Allsvenskan club Djurg\u00e5rden in June 1954, succeeding Welshman Dai Astley. He was also linked with the Swedish national team job, but the SvFF opted not to appoint a full-time manager following failure to qualify for the 1954 FIFA World Cup. He instead accepted a post as part-time coach of Sweden, still to be officially managed by a committee, but left the post following heavy defeats to the Soviet Union and Hungary. Back at Djurg\u00e5rden, his physical style of play proved to be highly effective and he led the \"Bl\u00e5r\u00e4nderna\" to the league title at the end of the 1954\u201355 season, after which he tendered his resignation."]}, {"page": "1989 in Wales", "response": ["*7 November \u2013 Dai Astley, footballer, 80"]}]}}
