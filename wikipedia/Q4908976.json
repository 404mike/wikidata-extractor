In his first season, he was ever present for the club, appearing in all 49 competitive matches Cardiff played. However, the following season, he was displaced by Bill Fielding and left the club at the end of the season to rejoin Southport. He returned to Southport in 1939 after being persuaded by a club official to keep playing; Jones was planning on buying a pub to manage. However, the outbreak of World War II brought an end to his professional playing career and, after representing the club in wartime fixtures, he was appointed as a trainer in 1947."]}]}}
