In addition, his \"ample girth\" had developed for he weighed 15\u00a0stone (95\u00a0kg) in his early twenties.Midwinter, p.31. Grace was a non-smoker but he enjoyed good food and wine; many years later, when discussing the overheads incurred during Lord Sheffield's profitless tour of Australia in 1891\u201392, Arthur Shrewsbury commented: \"I told you what wine would be drunk by the amateurs; Grace himself would drink enough to swim a ship.\"Birley, p.148.", "Derek Birley, who devoted whole passages of his book to criticism of Grace's gamesmanship and moneymaking, wrote that the \"bleakness (of the war) was exemplified in November (sic) 1915 by the death of Grace, which seemed depressingly emblematic of the end of an era\".Birley, p.208. Rowland Bowen wrote that \"many of Grace's achievements would be rated extremely good by our standards\" but \"by the standards of his day they were phenomenal: nothing like them had ever been done before\".Bowen, p.108. David Frith summed up Grace's legacy to cricket by writing that \"his influence lasted long after his final appearance in first-class cricket in 1908 and his death in 1915\". \"For decades\", wrote Frith, \"Grace had been arguably the most famous man in England\", easily recognisable because of \"his beard and his bulk\", and revered because of \"his batsmanship\". Frith added a view that even though Grace's records had been overtaken, \"his pre-eminence\" had not, and so Grace \"remains the most famous cricketer of them all, the one who elevated the game in public esteem\"."]}, {"page": "Charles Lennox, 4th Duke of Richmond", "response": ["* Derek Birley, A Social History of English Cricket, Aurum, 1999."]}, {"page": "Fred Trueman", "response": ["Writing in 1999, Derek Birley said of Trueman at this pivotal moment in his career that he was \"still learning his craft and, rather more slowly, how to behave\".

Owing to Hawke's \"tact, judgment and integrity\", he moulded the Eleven into \"the best, and probably the most united county cricket team in England\".

The odd man out was Louis Hall, a Nonconformist lay preacher who had joined Yorkshire in 1873 as an opening batsman and was reputedly the first teetotaller ever to play for them. Their best players included Emmett, Ephraim Lockwood, George Ulyett, Ted Peate, Billy Bates and Allen Hill, while Bobby Peel made his first-class debut for Yorkshire in July 1882.

The authorities include writers Harry Altham, John Arlott, Derek Birley, Arthur Haygarth, David Underdown, Roy Webber and Peter Wynne-Thomas. Their consensus view is that the only thing that can definitely be said about the origin of cricket is that its earliest record is in a late 16th-century court case in Surrey which proves it was played by children in southeast England in the middle of that century.Birley, p. 5.Major, p. 17.Underdown, p. 3. There have been alternative theories of origin but these have been dismissed or ignored by authorities. For example, the writer Andrew Lang claimed in 1912 that cricket evolved from a bat-and-ball game which may have been played in D\u00e1l Riata as early as the 6th century and this claim has been dismissed, by Anthony Bateman among others, in terms of \"Lang's idiosyncratic belief in the Celtic origin of cricket\". It is true that cricket is one of many bat-and-ball sports existing worldwide which have no known origin. Others are the definitely Celtic sports of hurling and shinty. Golf and hockey are other British ball games involving a club or stick while croquet was apparently imported from France and globally there are games such as Sweden's br\u00e4nnboll, Italy's lippa, India's gilli-danda, Finland's pes\u00e4pallo and Samoa's kilikiti. However, it is generally believed that cricket essentially belongs to the same family of bat-and-ball games as stoolball, rounders and baseball but whether it evolved from any of these, or vice versa, cannot be determined.Altham, p. 20. There is a 1523 reference to stoolball at a designated field in Oxfordshire; this may then have been a generic term for any game in which a ball is somehow hit with a bat or stick. 18th century references to stoolball in conjunction with cricket clearly indicate that it was a separate activity.McCann, pp. 37, 121 & 126.", "There are few 17th century references to cricket being played at or in the vicinity of schools but, in 1647, a Latin poem contains a probable reference to cricket being played at Winchester College; if so, it is the earliest known mention of cricket in Hampshire.Birley, p. 10. There is a reference to the game at St Paul's School, London c.1665 concerning John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, who studied there. In his Social History of English Cricket, Derek Birley comments that school cricket was \"alive and well during the interregnum\" (1649\u20131660). He speculates that the game \"must have been known to every schoolboy in the south-east\" of England. He doubts, however, that the sport at this time was part of any school's curriculum. Apart from Eton College and Westminster School, all schools in the 17th century had local intakes and no class segregation. Therefore, the sons of rich and poor families played together.Birley, pp. 9\u201310. As evidenced by the legal cases of 1646 and 1652, described above, cricket was played jointly by gentry and workers.", "There was a significant development at Maidstone on Saturday, 28 March 1668 when the quarter sessions made a ruling that customs and excise could not claim excise duty on alcoholic drinks sold at a \"kricketing\"; it was further ruled that a match promoter had the right to sell ale to spectators, presumably after obtaining the necessary licence. As John Major suggested, this dealt a massive blow to \"Puritan morality\", and it could have been the beginning of the long-term relationship between sport and alcohol.Major, p. 36. Derek Birley's comment on the excise ruling was that cricket's \"connection with public houses is historic in every sense of the word\". In his view, the sport had \"arrived\" because the brewery trade was the earliest and strongest sponsor of popular sport.Birley, p. 12."]}, {"page": "London Cricket Club", "response": ["* Derek Birley, A Social History of English Cricket, Aurum, 1999."]}, {"page": "Lumpy Stevens", "response": ["* Derek Birley, A Social History of English Cricket, Aurum, 1999."]}, {"page": "Bibliography of cricket", "response": [";Derek Birley"]}]}}
