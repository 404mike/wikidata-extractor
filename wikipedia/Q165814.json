Clark was originally slated to drive in the BOAC 1000\u00a0km sportscar race at Brands Hatch, but instead chose to drive in the Deutschland Troph\u00e4e, a Formula Two race, for Lotus at the Hockenheimring, primarily due to contractual obligations with Firestone.

He suffered a broken neck and skull fracture, and died before reaching the hospital. The cause of the crash was never definitively identified, but investigators concluded it was most likely due to a deflating rear tyre. Clark's death affected the racing community terribly, with fellow Formula One drivers and close friends Graham Hill, Jackie Stewart, Dan Gurney, John Surtees, Chris Amon and Jack Brabham all being personally affected by the tragedy. People came from all over the world to Clark's funeral. Colin Chapman was devastated and publicly stated that he had lost his best friend.
