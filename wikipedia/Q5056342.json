When Jefferis' call came, Macrae promptly undertook to perform experiments and to produce prototypes. He contacted Cecil Vandepeer Clarke, managing director of the Low Loading Trailer Company. Macrae had met Clarke a couple of years previously when he was the editor of The Caravan & Trailer magazine. He had been impressed by Clarke's work, and now he wanted his expertise and the use of his workshops in Bedford.National Archive. T 166\u00a0\u2014 Hearing 16 November 1953\u00a0\u2014 Macrae.

The inventor was Cecil Vandepeer Clarke, who had recently worked on the limpet mine. Clarke had prepared a paper \"A Consideration of New Offensive Means\" and followed this with \"Notes on Design of Trench Forming Machines\" for the Royal Engineers. His ideas filtered through the wartime bureaucracy and eventually reached the Cultivator project team. Clarke was interviewed by Churchill's scientific advisor, Professor Lindemann. In strict confidence, Lindemann told Clarke about work already in progress and he was sufficiently impressed to pass Clarke's suggestions up to Churchill himself. Clarke accepted a job as a temporary civil servant; he was hired as an assistant director of NLE with a salary of \u00a31,000 per annum."]}, {"page": "Stuart Macrae (inventor)", "response": ["One of Macrae's first weapons inventions was a limpet mine.

Aston House was the first to experiment with plastic explosive for sabotage. The Commanding Officer at the House was Col. Leslie J. Cardew Wood a strong contender for the title of the original'Q' - 'Q' character in the James Bond films. for he developed bespoke weapons, tools and gadgets which were used in raids including Lofoten Islands, Dieppe, Norsk Heavy Water Plant, St-Nazaire and Prague. Aston House supplied special weapons to the Special Air Service (SAS), Special Boat Service (SBS), Long Range Patrol Unit (LRP), the Resistance Groups and the Commandos. The station was important in aiding the design and production of the Fairbairn\u2013Sykes fighting knife. Production also included over 12 million No. 10 Time Delay pencil detonator and 38,500 Type 6 Limpet Mines, both made to original Aston House designs. Quality Control, Packaging and Dispatch was continuous and included supplying all the Home Guard Auxiliary Units and the Resistance Groups in Europe, reaching a peak around D-Day. Aston House took on responsibility for the total design, development and testing programme for the 'Sleeping Beauty' Motorised Submersible Canoe (MSC). One of the more exotic devices was the \"explosive rat\". The skinned rats were, filled with plastic explosive, and sewn up. The idea being to place the rats in coal near a boiler, so that they would be thrown in with the coal and cause an explosion. Aston House weapons were also used in the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich.
