He went to Rugby School, was an undergraduate at Cambridge University, and received his D.Phil. in 1985 from the University of Oxford under the supervision of Michael Atiyah. As a post-doctoral student, he was at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI) in Berkeley, and then a tutor at Jesus College, Oxford. From 1998 until shortly before his death he was a professor at the Pennsylvania State University.\nHis research interests center around index theorems, coarse geometry, operator algebras, noncommutative geometry, and the Novikov conjecture in differential topology.  He was an editor of the Journal of Noncommutative Geometry and the Journal of Topology.\nIn 1996 he was awarded the Whitehead Prize. In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Michael Atiyah", "response": ["John Roe 1985,"]}, {"page": "Whitehead Prize", "response": ["* 1996 John Roe, Y.
