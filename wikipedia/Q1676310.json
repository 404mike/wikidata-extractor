He is the author of a number of works on law and the history of systems of law, India, religion (particularly Christianity) and comparative religion, latterly particularly of comparisons of Christianity with Buddhism.  Derrett has also translated works by others into English.\nDerrett appeared briefly in Dr Robert Beckford's television documentary The Hidden Story of Jesus (premiered on Channel 4 on 25 December 2007) discussing similarities between some Christian and Buddhist teachings and possible historical reasons for those similarities.\nWith his \"A Blemmya in India\" (Numen Vol. 49, No. 4 (2002), pp. 460\u2013474) Dr. Derrett argued that \"Blemmiya\" were Africans, and Buddhists, in India.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Manusmriti", "response": ["Bh\u0101ruci is the oldest known commentator on the .

The book draws heavily on the work of P. V. Kane and Max M\u00fcller, but is at the same time very innovative in its approach. He also used Professor Ram Sharan Sharma's works to have an idea on ancient India. It was originally published in French in 1967 and translated to English by J. Duncan M. Derrett in 1973. It has since become the standard textbook for those who wish to learn about the history of the Indian legal system. His work  condenses the enormous volume of Indian literature into one fairly short book \u2014 unlike P.V Kane who published his findings in an incredibly dense and long series of books. Wigmore (1940) notes that authors of elaborate treatises represented \"...mainly their own elaborations of detail as to what the law ought to be; but they did not necessarily represent what the law really was in practice.\" He then illustrates Lingat's approach with a quote translated from his L'Influence Indoue dans 'ancien Droit Siamois (Paris 1937) p.\u00a018: The dharmasastras [books of law] are not ordinary legal treatises expounding the actual law of the country. The science of law was connected with the study of Veda [religious texts]. The latter leads to the study of the rules which necessarily control human societies and are independent of human wills. It reveals to men the principles which should inspire their conduct if they wish to live the meritorious life. They are thus analogous to the European \"natural law.\" But while the European theorists of the \"natural law\" seldom went beyond the vague region of generalities and the exposition of fundamental principles, the Hindus proceeded to deduce from these principles a mass of detailed and precise rules. Thus the dharmasastras, while theoretically expounding only natural (not positive) law, in fact regulated the entire legal life of man. Hence they were liable to be mistaken for genuine legal treatises."]}, {"page": "Classical Hindu law in practice", "response": ["*Lingat, Robert. 1973. The Classical Law of India. Trans. J. Duncan M.
