Born and raised in England, he represents the Jamaica national team.\nGrant began his career at Chelsea, progressing through the youth ranks before making his first-team debut in 2005. Grant was loaned out four times during his time at Chelsea; briefly playing for Oldham Athletic in 2006, before spending the 2006\u201307 season at Wycombe Wanderers. He then joined Luton Town on loan in November 2007, spending a month with the club. Grant later joined Southend United in January 2008, on loan until the end of the 2007\u201308 campaign. He signed for Southend on a permanent basis ahead of the 2008\u201309 season, and spent four seasons with the club. In June 2012, Grant signed for Stevenage on a free transfer.

He joined Scunthorpe United on a free transfer in January 2022.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Paul Sturrock", "response": ["Sturrock faced the tough task of rebuilding the Southend side with only five first team players available for selection at one stage of pre-season, with only Anthony Grant, Matt Paterson and Scott Spencer surviving. He soon appointed new signing Craig Easton, who he had previously managed at Swindon Town, as captain while another player from one of Sturrock's old clubs, Chris Barker, was later appointed as vice-captain, having initially been signed on loan, and then permanently on deadline day. It was not an easy task for Sturrock as his assistant, Tommy Widdrington left for \"footballing reasons\" on Wednesday 15 December 2010. After a mid table finish in his first season, he enjoyed more success during the 2011\u201312 season where Southend led League Two for most of the campaign. Sturrock was named Manager of the Month for September 2011 by the Football League."]}]}}
