He served as the president of the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) from 1967 to 1987. During his tenure at the ITTF, he successfully campaigned for the addition of table tennis in the Olympic Games. In 1984, the Olympics added table tennis as an event, and the first competition was held during 1988 The Summer Olympics in Seoul. Juan Antonio Samaranch, the former IOC president, awarded him the Olympic Order for his role as an advocate for the sport. Additionally, Evans was named the \"Honorary Life President\" of the organization in 1987 and was appointed OBE in the 1972 Queen's Birthday Honors list.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ping-pong diplomacy", "response": ["According to History of U.S. Table Tennis by Tim Boggan, who went to China along with the U.S. Table Tennis Team, three incidents may have triggered their invitation from China. Welshman H. Roy Evans, then President of the International Table Tennis Federation, claimed that he visited China prior to the 31st World Table Tennis Championship and suggested to non-Chinese sports authorities and Premier Zhou Enlai that China should take steps to get in contact with the world through international sport events after the Cultural Revolution. Furthermore, the American player Leah \"Miss Ping\" Neuberger, the 1956 World Mixed Doubles Champion and nine-time U.S. Open Women's Singles Champion, was traveling at the time with the Canadian Table Tennis Team that had been invited by China to visit the country. China diplomatically extended its approval of Leah Neuberger's application for a visa to the entire American team. The third incident, perhaps the most likely trigger, was the unexpected but dramatic meeting between the flamboyant American player Glenn Cowan and the Chinese player Zhuang Zedong, a three-time world champion and winner of many other table tennis events. Zhuang Zedong described the incident in a 2007 talk at the USC U.S.-China Institute."]}, {"page": "Welsh Sports Hall of Fame", "response": ["* Roy Evans (Table Tennis) * "]}, {"page": "Roy Evans (disambiguation)", "response": ["Roy Evans (born 1948) is an English football player and manager (Liverpool FC).", "Roy Evans may also refer to:", "*Roy Evans (actor), British actor", "*Roy Evans (Australian footballer) (born 1913), Australian rules footballer for Footscray", "*Roy Evans (baseball) (1874\u20131915), baseball pitcher from 1897\u20131903", "*Roy Evans (EastEnders), fictional character on the BBC's EastEnders", "*Roy Evans (engineer), Welsh civil engineer and academic", "*Roy Evans (footballer, born 1943) (1943\u20131969), Welsh international soccer player who died in a car crash in 1969", "*Roy Evans (Neighbours), fictional character on the Australian soap opera Neighbours", "*Roy Evans (rugby league), rugby league footballer of the 1950s and 1960s for Great Britain, and Wigan", "*Roy Evans (table tennis), table tennis player and official; in Welsh Sports Hall of Fame", "*Roy Evans (trade unionist) (1931\u20132015), Welsh trade union leader"]}]}}
