However, at the same time Friday's disciplinary record was becoming so bad that even the Evening Post, usually favourable to him, criticised him on 30 September 1974, just after he had scored his first hat-trick for Reading in a 4\u20131 victory over Southport. He was the Football League's joint top scorer by this time with nine goals, but he had also already been booked three times that season and the Post argued that by constantly risking suspension he was letting the team down. Under the system then used, the three bookings gave him an automatic two-match suspension. The article argued that missing games because of \"completely unnecessary\" and \"stupid\" infractions amounted to selling the club short."]}, {"page": "Maltby Main F.C.", "response": ["*1979\u2013????: Dick Habbin"]}, {"page": "1970\u201371 Football League", "response": ["|=||align=left|  Dick Habbin ||align=left| Reading ||12||1||0||13"]}, {"page": "Habbin", "response": ["*Dick Habbin (born 1949), English footballer and manager"]}]}}
