Arthur Kinnaird and Lieut. Robert Hedley. The cup-holders immediately dominated the game and Kinnaird quickly had an unsuccessful shot on goal. After only five minutes Henry Wace crossed the ball from a wide position and Jarvis Kenrick kicked the ball past the Engineers' goalkeeper Lieut. Lovick Friend to give the Wanderers the lead.Warsop, p.\u00a035 Approximately ten minutes later, Wanderers goalkeeper James Kirkpatrick suffered a broken arm during a tussle on the goal-line, but managed to keep the ball out of the goal, and went on to play the remainder of the match despite his injury. In the 20th minute of the game, the Engineers scored an equalising goal. Some modern sources state that Lieut. William Morris scored the goal, however contemporary newspaper reports in The Field, The Sporting Life and Bell's Life in London all state that Morris took a throw-in which led to a \"scrimmage\" or \"bully\" in front of the Wanderers' goal, out of which the ball was forced over the goal-line.Warsop, p.\u00a036", "|FW || ||  Henry Wace"]}, {"page": "John Wylie (footballer, born 1854)", "response": ["Three weeks before the Cup Final, Wylie (together with fellow Wanderers forwards Henry Wace and Hubert Heron) was again selected for the annual international fixture against Scotland.
