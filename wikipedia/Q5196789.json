He was one of the pioneers of abstract art in Britain.Cuthbert Hamilton went to the Slade School of Art and was a contemporary of Wyndham Lewis. In 1912 he helped with decorations for the Cave of the Golden Calf with Wyndham Lewis, and the next year he became part of the Omega Workshops.In 1913 Wyndham Lewis argued with Roger Fry about a commission at the Omega Workshops. Hamilton left the workshops with other artists William Roberts, Frederick Etchells, Edward Wadsworth, and Henri Gaudier-Brzeska. They all supported Wyndham Lewis and united with him in March 1914, when he started the Rebel Art Centre. The artists were later on associated with the Vorticist art movement. Hamilton was one of the names signing the Vorticist manifesto and he also contributed material to the first issue of the Vorticist magazine Blast, (illus xviii Group).He opened the Yeoman Pottery in Kensington in 1915/16. During World War I Hamilton was a Special Constable. After the war ended, he exhibited work with a new group Group X, which had been started by Lewis and Edward McKnight Kauffer also to be an avant-garde group.Hamilton married the daughter of a powerful insurance businessman, and in 1920 he closed the Yeoman Pottery, gave up all his artistic work and did not take part in any art exhibitions during the remainder of his life.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Vorticism", "response": ["In the summer of 1913 Roger Fry, with Duncan Grant and Vanessa Bell, set up the Omega Workshops in Fitzrovia \u2013 in the heart of bohemian London. Fry was an advocate of an increasingly abstract art and design practice, and the studio/gallery/retail outlet allowed him to employ and support artists in sympathy with this approach, such as Wyndham Lewis, Frederick Etchells, Cuthbert Hamilton and Edward Wadsworth. Lewis had made an impact at the Allied Artists' Salon the previous year with a huge virtually abstract work, Kermesse (now lost),Clive Bell in The Athenaeum of 27 July 1912 explained that, in order to appreciate this work, visitors 'having shed all irrelevant prejudices in favour of representation will be able to contemplate it as a piece of pure design'. and in the same year he had worked with the American sculptor Jacob Epstein on the decoration of Madame Strindberg's notorious cabaret theatre club The Cave of the Golden Calf."]}, {"page": "Omega Workshops", "response": ["Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant produced designs for Omega, and Wyndham Lewis was initially part of the operation. Lewis, however, split off at an early stage, taking with him several other participants to start the rival decorative workshop Rebel Art Centre after accusing Fry of misappropriating a commission to decorate a room at the Ideal Home Exhibition in the autumn of 1913. In October 1913, Wyndham Lewis, Frederick Etchells, Edward Wadsworth and Cuthbert Hamilton announced their resignation from Omega in a letter, known as the 'Round Robin', to its shareholders and patrons. This letter contained accusations particularly against Fry, criticising the workshop's products and ideology.  This split led to the formation not only of the Rebel Art Centre, but also of the Vorticist movement."]}, {"page": "Art of the United Kingdom", "response": ["Vorticism was a brief coming together of a number of Modernist artists in the years immediately before 1914; members included Wyndham Lewis, the sculptor Sir Jacob Epstein, David Bomberg, Malcolm Arbuthnot, Lawrence Atkinson, the American photographer Alvin Langdon Coburn, Frederick Etchells, the French sculptor Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, Cuthbert Hamilton, Christopher Nevinson, William Roberts, Edward Wadsworth, Jessica Dismorr, Helen Saunders, and Dorothy Shakespear. The early 20th century also includes The Sitwells artistic circle and the Bloomsbury Group, a group of mostly English writers, intellectuals, philosophers and artists, including painter Dora Carrington, painter and art critic Roger Fry, art critic Clive Bell, painter Vanessa Bell, painter Duncan Grant among others. Although very fashionable at the time, their work in the visual arts looks less impressive today.Wilson, 127\u2013129; Mellon, 182\u2013186 British modernism was to remain somewhat tentative until after World War II, though figures such as Ben Nicholson kept in touch with European developments."]}, {"page": "Group X", "response": ["In 1920 the former members of the pre-War Vorticist movement abruptly left the London Group, of which they had been part. Six of these artists \u2013 Jessica Dismorr, Frederick Etchells, Cuthbert Hamilton, Wyndham Lewis, William Roberts and Edward Wadsworth \u2013 were joined by the sculptor Frank Dobson, Charles Ginner, the American Edward McKnight Kauffer and John Turnbull to found Group X."]}, {"page": "William Staite Murray", "response": ["He was born in Deptford, London and attended pottery classes at Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts from 1909 - 1912. He worked with Cuthbert Hamilton, a member of the Vorticist group, at the Yeoman Pottery in Kensington before joining the army in 1915. In 1919, after his military service, he set up his own pottery in Rotherhithe, London in the premises of his brother's engineering and foundry works. Although initially influenced by the  avant-garde art of the time he became increasingly interested in  early Chinese ceramics, under the influence of which he began making high-fired stoneware in an oil-fired kiln. From  Rotherhithe he moved his studio first to  Brockley in Kent and then to  in 1929 to Bray, Berkshire."]}, {"page": "Hamilton (name)", "response": ["*Cuthbert Hamilton (1885\u20131959), British artist"]}, {"page": "The Vorticists at the Restaurant de la Tour Eiffel, Spring 1915", "response": ["The painting shows a crowded table inside the restaurant of the H\u00f4tel de la Tour Eiffel at 1 Percy Street, London.
