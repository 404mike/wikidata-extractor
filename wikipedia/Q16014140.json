He was one of the three leading men in the \"Shankill Butchers\", an Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) murder gang.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Shankill Butchers", "response": ["In May 1975, Murphy was released from prison, where he had married Margaret Gillespie. During his imprisonment a daughter had been born to the couple. He spent much of his time frequenting pubs on the Shankill Road and assembling a paramilitary team that would enable him to act with some freedom at a remove from the UVF leadership (Brigade Staff). Murphy's inner circle consisted of two people whom Dillon was unable to name for legal reasons but whom he called Murphy's \"personal friends\". These were a \"Mr A\" and John Murphy, one of Lenny's brothers (referred to as \"Mr B\"). Further down the chain of command were Lenny Murphy's \"sergeants\" William Moore and Bobby \"Basher\" Bates, a UVF man and former prisoner. \"A legacy of hatred\", Sunday Life, 24 May 2009", "A few days later, on 30 November 1975, an internal feud led to the deaths of two members of a rival UVF company on the Shankill and to that of Archibald Waller, who had been involved in the Crossen murder. On 14 October of that year, Waller had killed Stewart Robinson in a punishment shooting gone wrong.\"Cain: Sutton Index of Deaths\". Retrieved 4 September 2009 With the sanction of the UVF Brigade Staff, he in turn was gunned down by one of Robinson's comrades in the UVF team based in the Windsor Bar, a quarter of a mile from the Brown Bear pub. Enraged, Murphy had the gunman, former loyalist prisoner Noel \"Nogi\" Shaw, brought before a kangaroo court in the Lawnbrook Club, one of his Shankill drinking dens. After pistol whipping Shaw, Murphy shot him in front of his whole unit of about twenty men and returned to finish his drink at the bar. John Murphy and William Moore put Shaw's body in a laundry basket, and Moore dumped it half a mile away.Jordan, Milestones in Murder (centre pages with image of Shaw's body in basket)", "Taking advantage of the aftermath of a loyalist paramilitary strike and local elections, Nesbitt had the recovered McLaverty disguised and driven by police around the Shankill area on Wednesday 18 May to see if he could spot the men who had abducted or attacked him. Within a short time he identified McAllister and Edwards, and Nesbitt had a breakthrough that enabled him to widen his net. The next morning he initiated a large arrest operation and many of McAllister's associates, including Moore, were taken into custody. At first under intense interrogation, the suspects admitted only to their involvement in the McLaverty abduction but Nesbitt, seizing on McAllister's references to the size of a knife used on McLaverty, had his team of detectives press the case, and eventually most of the gang admitted their part in the activities of the Butchers. Further arrests followed and the overall picture became clearer. The salient point emerging was that Murphy, the commander of the unit, was the driving force behind the cut-throat murders and other criminal activities. A number of the Butchers implicated him and his close associates \"Mr A\" and \"Mr B\" (John Murphy) in numerous paramilitary activities but later retracted these claims for fear of retribution from the UVF Brigade Staff. Lenny Murphy, in prison, and Messrs \"A\" and \"B\" were interviewed several times in connection with the Butchers' inquiry but revealed nothing during interviews. Without corroborative or forensic evidence, the state prosecution service decided that they would not face charges.", "Murphy's family denied he had had a violent nature or was involved with the Butchers: \"My Lenny could not have killed a fly\", said his mother Joyce.News Letter, 18 November 1982 She accused the police of continual harassment of her son since his recent release from prison and said that he was planning to leave the country as soon as his divorce came through. The UVF gave Murphy a paramilitary funeral attended by thousands of loyalists and several unionist politicians, at which Mr A and John Murphy played prominent roles.Jordan, p. 194 On his gravestone in Carnmoney cemetery were inscribed the words: \"Here Lies a Soldier\".Dillon, p. 262 May Blood, Baroness Blood, a Shankill Road community representative, said: \"My father was a soldier. My father fought in two World Wars. They were real heroes. Lenny Murphy wasn't a hero; he was a murdering thug.\" Murphy's headstone was smashed in 1989 and had to be replaced.", "Members of the gang also carried out a bombing mission on the Falls Road that killed a 10-year-old Catholic boy on 10 April 1977.McKittrick p. 715 Murphy's brother John was heavily involved in the latter incident, along with \"Mr A\". The gang used the services of the UVF's leading bomb expert James \"Tonto\" Watt to plant the device, although Watt was not a member of the Brown Bear platoon.Dillon, p.184 Several of the Butchers, including John Murphy, were questioned about a serious assault in April 1977 in Union Street, near Belfast city centre, on a man they believed wrongly was a Catholic. John Murphy received three years' imprisonment for his part in this incident.", "All members of the Butchers gang were released a number of years ago. The first to be freed was John Townsley, who had been only 14 when he became involved with the gang and 16 when arrested. In October 1996, Bates was released;\"Shankill Butcher is Freed\", The Belfast Telegraph, 26 October 1996. he had reportedly \"found religion\" behind bars. Bates was shot and killed in the upper Shankill area on 11 June 1997 by the son of the UDA man he had killed in the Windsor Bar.\"Conflict related deaths 1997\", birw.org.
