He later drummed for Hanoi Rocks in 1985, before the band broke up that same year. He briefly toured with Black Sabbath from July 1987 through December 1987, and in a one-off gig in May 1988.

The band drew criticism from activists and artists involved with Artists United Against Apartheid, who had been boycotting South Africa since 1985.

Jones and his bandmates became friendly with Sex Pistols Glen Matlock and Steve Jones, who would assist them as they tried out potential new members.

In Westway to the World, Jones confirms the 48-hour deadline, while Strummer says it was he who made the call after just 24 (11:34\u201311:40). Jones elsewhere gave a different account, according to which Strummer was originally given 24 hours to decide, and Rhodes called after just eight (Robb 2006, p. 194). Simonon later remarked, \"Once we had Joe on board it all started to come together.\" Strummer introduced the band to his old school friend Pablo LaBritain, who sat in on drums during Strummer's first few rehearsals with the group.

The line-up with Razzle is considered the definitive version of Hanoi Rocks.

He also got some help with the lyrics from legendary Ian Hunter (of Mott The Hoople).
