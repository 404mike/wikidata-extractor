He was educated at Eton and Balliol College, Oxford.\nLord Stanley oversaw the loss of the family's ancestral estate at Alderley Park. With a fondness for gambling, wine and marriage, he had to pay for four divorce settlements, and death duties, even at pre-war levels, for both the 4th and 5th Barons. When the mansion at Alderley Park was destroyed by fire in 1931 he moved into the former farmhouse. When he sold the estate in 1938 to the property developers Hambling Crundall and Co Ltd., many of his older tenants were forced to leave the village.He had four wives:\nLady Victoria Audrey Beatrice Chetwynd-Talbot (married 3 March 1932 \u2013 divorced 1936)\nEdith Louisa Sylvia Ashley (married 18 January 1944 \u2013 divorced 1948)\nTherese Husson (married 6 April 1951 \u2013 divorced 1957)\nKathleen Margaret Crane (n\u00e9e Wright) (married 15 September 1961 \u2013 his death 1971).He and Victoria had one daughter, The Hon. Edwina Maureen Stanley (born 19 January 1933).

Since the 15th century, most of them have belonged to the De Trafford baronets. The principal manors were based on the 14th century Chorley Old Hall, which is south-west of Alderley Edge, and the Old Hall, at Nether Alderley, a 16th-century building burnt down in 1779. The economies of Chorley and Nether Alderley were dominated by agriculture with a market charter granted at Nether Alderley in c.1253. Nether Alderley Mill dates back to 1391, although the present timber structure is 16th century. The millpond was adapted to form the moat, which surrounded the Old Hall, the home of the Stanley family. The corn mill continued to be worked until 1939 when Edward Stanley, 6th Baron Stanley of Alderley, was compelled to sell it, along with the rest of the Alderley Park estate, to meet the cost of death duties. In the 1950s the National Trust bought the site and has since restored the building and opened it to the public."]}, {"page": "Edward Stanley", "response": ["*Edward Stanley, 6th Baron Stanley of Alderley (1907\u20131971), English nobleman"]}, {"page": "Edward John Stanley, 6th Baron Sheffield", "response": ["#REDIRECT Edward Stanley, 6th Baron Stanley of Alderley"]}, {"page": "Edward John Stanley, 6th Baron Sheffield (1907-1971)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Edward Stanley, 6th Baron Stanley of Alderley"]}, {"page": "Edward John Stanley, 6th Baron Sheffield and Stanley of Alderley", "response": ["#REDIRECT Edward Stanley, 6th Baron Stanley of Alderley"]}, {"page": "Edward Stanley, 6th Baron Sheffield and Stanley of Alderley", "response": ["#REDIRECT Edward Stanley, 6th Baron Stanley of Alderley"]}]}}
