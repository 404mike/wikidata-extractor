He was educated at Eton and Balliol College, Oxford.\nLord Stanley oversaw the loss of the family's ancestral estate at Alderley Park. With a fondness for gambling, wine and marriage, he had to pay for four divorce settlements, and death duties, even at pre-war levels, for both the 4th and 5th Barons. When the mansion at Alderley Park was destroyed by fire in 1931 he moved into the former farmhouse. When he sold the estate in 1938 to the property developers Hambling Crundall and Co Ltd., many of his older tenants were forced to leave the village.He had four wives:\nLady Victoria Audrey Beatrice Chetwynd-Talbot (married 3 March 1932 \u2013 divorced 1936)\nEdith Louisa Sylvia Ashley (married 18 January 1944 \u2013 divorced 1948)\nTherese Husson (married 6 April 1951 \u2013 divorced 1957)\nKathleen Margaret Crane (n\u00e9e Wright) (married 15 September 1961 \u2013 his death 1971).He and Victoria had one daughter, The Hon.
