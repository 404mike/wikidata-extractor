He suspected it was a fantasy shared by most children: a world without adults and the restrictions they place on children. He thought it would be fun if it was just him and a few friends left to do as they pleased, with everything at their disposal.

Well written, and more believable than one would think just by reading a summary, it is a page turner. John Christopher offers a chilly story, which offers more, and is by and large more convincing the trope, put in play by many television series of happy survivors seeking a place to establish a cleaner and more romantic version of the old world. Empty World gives the youthful reader far more to think about by exploring darker and more realistic themes of greed, mistrust, despair, and insanities.
