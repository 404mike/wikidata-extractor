He had a run of 16 matches between mid-October and mid-January, but lost his place to Albert Milton and appeared just once more. Reed spent the 1908\u201309 season with North-Eastern League club Darlington, and then returned to the Football League with Clapton Orient. He played twice in their 1909\u201310 Second Division campaign, but would not re-sign for 1910\u201311 because Orient would not pay him over the summer. He returned to Sunderland where he resumed his North-Eastern League career in October 1910 with Sunderland Rovers."]}]}}
