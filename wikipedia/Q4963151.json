He was born in Billinge End, Blackburn, Lancashire.Booth was a right-handed batsman sometimes used as an opener and a right-arm legbreak and googly bowler. He passed 1000 runs in eight seasons during his career, and scored more than 800 first-class runs in three other seasons. In his early career with Lancashire between 1956 and 1963, he bowled regularly, taking up to 30 wickets in a season, but after he joined Leicestershire in 1964 he was no more than an occasional bowler, and did not take more than nine wickets in any one season.Booth's highest first-class score was 183 not out for Lancashire against Oxford University in 1961. His best bowling figures were 7 for 143 for Lancashire against Worcestershire in 1959.Booth died aged 85 on the 14 December 2020.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Darwen", "response": ["* Brian Booth, Lancashire and Leicestershire county cricketer (1935-2020)"]}, {"page": "Brian Booth", "response": ["Booth scored 127 not out against Somerset, and in the next match against Lancashire, he was caught behind for 99 from the bowling of another Brian Booth.Robinson, p. 276. He played consistently, with two more half-centuries to earn his debut in the Fourth Test at Old Trafford in place of Colin McDonald. The series was evenly poised at 1\u20131, and Australia batted first on a pitch that initially assisted fast bowling. The surface was tinged with green and England fielded a pace line-up that included Brian Statham and Fred Trueman. Booth was struck in the torso by his first ball, a bouncer that did not rise as high as he expected. He managed to repel a spearing yorker on the second ball and compiled a battling 46, the second highest score on the difficult pitch, featuring in a partnership of 46\u2014the highest in Australia's innings\u2014with Bill Lawry. Australia managed only 190 on the bowler-friendly pitch. Booth only managed nine in the second innings before Australia retained the Ashes after an English collapse on the final day resulted in a 54-run win. In the drawn Fifth and final Test at The Oval, Booth came in with the score at 4/211 after the dismissal of Norm O'Neill for 117. He featured in a 185-run partnership with Peter Burge. Booth was dismissed for 71 while attempting to loft the spin of Tony Lock over the infield, as captain Richie Benaud needed quick runs; observers felt the need to attack cost Booth his maiden Test century. Booth added three more 70s in the closing tour matches before the team returned to Australia.", "Brian Booth, that model of a man and of a batsman who tends to be under-rated and forgotten because both he and his cricket were so blamelessly self-effacing. Tall, upright, correct in method, ever-patient, he repeated the hundred he had got at Brisbane, and so gave England a target to go for while all around him were failing. ", "Booth had a reputation for walking when he knew that he was out, without waiting for the umpire's decision, and he was regarded as a player and leader of the highest principles. He was known for his record of instilling high standards of conduct into his players and prevented them from showing dissent towards unfavourable umpiring decisions.Robinson, p. 277. Robinson said that \"if a prize were offered for fairplaymanship among Australia's post-war cricketers Brian Booth ought to win it hands down\".Robinson, p. 279. Lawry regarded Booth as one of the most gentlemanly cricketers that he knew.Coleman, p. 592.", "A committed Christian, Booth is an Anglican lay-preacher, and often invokes religious and ethical arguments while talking about issues such as sportsmanship. Booth became intensely religious in the 1950s after befriending Pastor Roy Gray, a colleague in district cricket and a classmate at Sydney Teachers College. Gray challenged his friend's faith, and Booth reflected that \"Until that point, sport had really been my God\". During Booth's career, the media made much of his religious convictions. After scoring his maiden Test century, Booth was asked whether he felt that God was with him.Haigh, p. 258. He replied in the affirmative, and the next day, a newspaper printed the headline \"England can't win. God is on Brian Booth's side.\""]}, {"page": "Booth (surname)", "response": ["* Brian Booth (born 1933), Australian former cricketer", "* Brian Booth (cricketer, born 1935), English former cricketer"]}, {"page": "Brian Booth (Lancashire and Leicestershire cricketer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Brian Booth (cricketer, born 1935)"]}, {"page": "Brian Booth (English cricketer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Brian Booth (cricketer, born 1935)"]}]}}
