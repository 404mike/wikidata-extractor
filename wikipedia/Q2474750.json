He then moved into newspapers, becoming as wealthy and important in Canada as the press barons in the United Kingdom. He aspired to such a peerage but was denied it unless he moved residence to the UK. He invited British newspaper owners to sell to him, the first doing so being The Scotsman and he soon formed a commercial television company which gained the first ITV franchise in Scotland, the Scottish Television, today known as STV, which is also nowadays the last ITV franchise not to be owned by ITV plc. From the substantial profits of commercial television he bought many titles such as The Times and Kemsley's Newspapers which published The Sunday Times; both of these examples are nowadays owned by News UK, a division of News Corp.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 4", "response": ["*  1976   \u2013 Roy Thomson, 1st Baron Thomson of Fleet, Canadian-English publisher (b. 1894)"]}, {"page": "June 5", "response": ["*1894 \u2013 Roy Thomson, 1st Baron Thomson of Fleet, Canadian-English publisher and academic (d. 1976)"]}, {"page": "Oscar Peterson", "response": ["* Roy Thomson Award, 1987"]}, {"page": "Television", "response": ["The TV regulator oversees TV advertising in the United Kingdom. Its restrictions have applied since the early days of commercially funded TV. Despite this, an early TV mogul, Roy Thomson, likened the broadcasting licence as being a \"licence to print money\". Restrictions mean that the big three national commercial TV channels: ITV, Channel 4, and Channel 5 can show an average of only seven minutes of advertising per hour (eight minutes in the peak period). Other broadcasters must average no more than nine minutes (twelve in the peak). This means that many imported TV shows from the U.S. have unnatural pauses where the British company does not utilize the narrative breaks intended for more frequent U.S. advertising. Advertisements must not be inserted in the course of certain specific proscribed types of programs which last less than half an hour in scheduled duration; this list includes any news or current affairs programs, documentaries, and programs for children; additionally, advertisements may not be carried in a program designed and broadcast for reception in schools or in any religious broadcasting service or other devotional program or during a formal Royal ceremony or occasion. There also must be clear demarcations in time between the programs and the advertisements. The BBC, being strictly non-commercial, is not allowed to show advertisements on television in the U.K., although it has many advertising-funded channels abroad. The majority of its budget comes from television license fees (see below) and broadcast syndication, the sale of content to other broadcasters."]}, {"page": "1894", "response": ["** Roy Thomson, Canadian publisher (d. 1976)"]}, {"page": "The Times", "response": ["On 3 May 1966, it resumed printing news on the front page \u2013 previously the front page had been given over to small advertisements, usually of interest to the moneyed classes in British society.
