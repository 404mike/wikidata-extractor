The afterlife, or the \"spirit world\", is seen by spiritualists, not as a static place, but as one in which spirits continue to evolve. These two beliefs\u2014that contact with spirits is possible, and that spirits are more advanced than humans\u2014lead spiritualists to a third belief: that spirits are capable of providing useful knowledge about moral and ethical issues, as well as about the nature of God. Some spiritualists will speak of a concept which they refer to as \"spirit guides\"\u2014specific spirits, often contacted, who are relied upon for spiritual guidance.

As Poe had been pursuing relationships with Sarah Helen Whitman and Nancy Richmond (whether romantic or platonic is uncertain), members of literary circles in New York City spread gossip and incited scandal about alleged improprieties. At the center of this gossip was a woman named Elizabeth F. Ellet, whose affections Poe had previously scorned. Ellet may be represented by the king himself, with his seven councilors representing Margaret Fuller, Hiram Fuller (no relation), Thomas Dunn English, Anne Lynch Botta, Anna Blackwell, Ermina Jane Locke, and Locke's husband."]}, {"page": "Sarah Ellen Blackwell", "response": ["Sarah Ellen Blackwell was the youngest daughter of Hannah (Lane) Blackwell and Samuel Blackwell, a sugar refiner and lay preacher.
