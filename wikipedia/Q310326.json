He was elected to the Royal Society at the age of 24. Sloane travelled to the Caribbean in 1687 and documented his travels and findings with extensive publications years later. Sloane was a renowned medical doctor among the aristocracy, and was elected to the Royal College of Physicians at age 27. He is credited with creating drinking chocolate. Streets and places were later named after him, including Hans Place, Hans Crescent, and Sloane Square in and around Chelsea, London \u2013 the area of his final residence \u2013 and also Sir Hans Sloane Square in his birthplace in Northern Ireland, Killyleagh.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 16", "response": ["*1660 \u2013 Hans Sloane, Irish-English physician and academic (d. 1753)"]}, {"page": "British Museum", "response": ["The Museum was established in 1753, largely based on the collections of the Anglo-Irish physician and scientist Sir Hans Sloane. It first opened to the public in 1759, in Montagu House, on the site of the current building. The museum's expansion over the following 250 years was largely a result of British colonisation and has resulted in the creation of several branch institutions, or independent spin-offs, the first being the Natural History Museum in 1881.", "=== Sir Hans Sloane ===", "Although today principally a museum of cultural art objects and antiquities, the British Museum was founded as a \"universal museum\". Its foundations lie in the will of the Anglo-Irish physician and naturalist Sir Hans Sloane (1660\u20131753), a London-based doctor and scientist from Ulster. During the course of his lifetime, and particularly after he married the widow of a wealthy Jamaican planter, Sloane gathered a large collection of curiosities and, not wishing to see his collection broken up after death, he bequeathed it to King George II, for the nation, for a sum of \u00a320,000.", "At that time, Sloane's collection consisted of around 71,000 objects of all kinds including some 40,000 printed books, 7,000 manuscripts, extensive natural history specimens including 337 volumes of dried plants, prints and drawings including those by Albrecht D\u00fcrer and antiquities from Sudan, Egypt, Greece, Rome, the Ancient Near and Far East and the Americas.Gavin R de Beer, Sir Hans Sloane and the British Museum (London, 1953).", "Egyptian antiquities have formed part of the British Museum collection ever since its foundation in 1753 after receiving 160 Egyptian objectsReported in the list of Sloane's collection given to his executors in 1753. Reproduced in MacGregor (1994a:29) from Sir Hans Sloane. After the defeat of the French forces under Napoleon at the Battle of the Nile in 1801, the Egyptian antiquities collected were confiscated by the British army and presented to the British Museum in 1803. These works, which included the famed Rosetta Stone, were the first important group of large sculptures to be acquired by the museum. Thereafter, the UK appointed Henry Salt as consul in Egypt who amassed a huge collection of antiquities, some of which were assembled and transported with great ingenuity by the famous Italian explorer Giovanni Belzoni. Most of the antiquities Salt collected were purchased by the British Museum and the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre."]}, {"page": "Carl Linnaeus", "response": ["In August 1735, during Linnaeus's stay with Burman, he met George Clifford III, a director of the Dutch East India Company and the owner of a rich botanical garden at the estate of Hartekamp in Heemstede. Clifford was very impressed with Linnaeus's ability to classify plants, and invited him to become his physician and superintendent of his garden. Linnaeus had already agreed to stay with Burman over the winter, and could thus not accept immediately. However, Clifford offered to compensate Burman by offering him a copy of Sir Hans Sloane's Natural History of Jamaica, a rare book, if he let Linnaeus stay with him, and Burman accepted.Anderson (1997), p. 64.St\u00f6ver (1794), pp. 81\u201382. On 24 September 1735, Linnaeus moved to Hartekamp to become personal physician to Clifford, and curator of Clifford's herbarium. He was paid 1,000 florins a year, with free board and lodging. Though the agreement was only for a winter of that year, Linnaeus practically stayed there until 1738. It was here that he wrote a book Hortus Cliffortianus, in the preface of which he described his experience as \"the happiest time of my life\". (A portion of Hartekamp was declared as public garden in April 1956 by the Heemstede local authority, and was named \"Linnaeushof\". It eventually became, as it is claimed, the biggest playground in Europe.)", "In July 1736, Linnaeus travelled to England, at Clifford's expense.Blunt (2001), pp. 106\u2013107.

He taught Miller about his new system of subdividing plants, as described in . Miller was in fact reluctant to use the new binomial nomenclature, preferring the classifications of Joseph Pitton de Tournefort and John Ray at first. Linnaeus, nevertheless, applauded Miller's Gardeners Dictionary,Non erit Lexicon Hortulanorum, sed etiam Botanicorum, that the book will be, not just a lexicon of gardeners, but of botanists.\"; noted in Paterson 1986:40\u201341. The conservative Scot actually retained in his dictionary a number of pre-Linnaean binomial signifiers discarded by Linnaeus but which have been retained by modern botanists. He only fully changed to the Linnaean system in the edition of The Gardeners Dictionary of 1768.  Miller ultimately was impressed, and from then on started to arrange the garden according to Linnaeus's system.St\u00f6ver (1794), pp. 89\u201390."]}, {"page": "January 11", "response": ["*1753 \u2013 Hans Sloane, Irish-English physician and academic (b. 1660)"]}, {"page": "1753", "response": ["* January 11 \u2013 Sir Hans Sloane, Irish physician (b. 1660)"]}, {"page": "1660", "response": ["* April 16 \u2013 Hans Sloane, British physician (d. 1753)"]}, {"page": "Collecting", "response": ["*Hans Sloane \u2014 natural history"]}, {"page": "Leicester Square", "response": ["In 1726, anatomist Nathaniel St Andr\u00e9 claimed to have delivered rabbits from Mary Toft, a woman who lived at No.\u00a027 Leicester Square.
