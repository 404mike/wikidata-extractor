Standing just 5 feet 3 inches (1.60 m) tall he had the distinction of being the shortest English professional cricketer of modern times. A right-handed batsman, Pilling scored over 15,000 first-class runs for Lancashire, whom he played county cricket for from 1962 to 1982.One of his most memorable innings for Lancashire was an unbeaten 70 against Sussex, which helped secure his county's first Gillette Cup success in 1970.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lancashire County Cricket Club", "response": ["Jack Bond became Lancashire captain in 1968 and remained in the position until 1972. During his tenure, Lancashire performed well in the championship, finishing third in 1970 and 1971. His biggest triumph as captain was the five one day trophies he secured during his five-year captaincy. Farokh Engineer joined Lancashire in 1968, and Clive Lloyd joined in 1969; together Lloyd and Engineer helped establish Lancashire as one of the best one day sides in England. The silverware included a hat-trick of Gillette Cups (1970\u201372) and the Sunday League twice in successive seasons (1969\u20131970). Mainstays of the successful one day side included Clive Lloyd, David Lloyd, Barry Wood, Harry Pilling, Frank Hayes, Peter Lever, Ken Shuttleworth, David Hughes and Jack Simmons. In the Gillette Cup semi-final against Gloucestershire in 1971, David Hughes walked to the crease at 8.45pm and hit 24 from an over in near darkness to win the match. David Lloyd was captain from 1973 to 1977 and secured Lancashire's fourth Gillette Cup in 1975, and coming runners up in 1974 and 1976. However, in the late 1970s, the team that had been so dominant in the one day format began to break up. Despite boasting international players such as Lloyd and Engineer, Lancashire's first-class performances never matched the success of the limited overs team.
