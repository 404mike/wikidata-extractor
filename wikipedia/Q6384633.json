Here the unit's main duties were patrols, scrambles and convoy protection. On 15 August 234 Squadron was posted to RAF Middle Wallop, a part of No. 10 Group RAF flying in defence of Portsmouth, Southampton and other targets along the south coast. As there were fewer raids along the south coast than in the south east, about two thirds of patrols, scrambles and interceptions undertaken were flown in support of No. 11 Group RAF, as far as Kent. The squadron achieved a number of victories, including those of its inspirational force, high scoring Australian Pat Hughes and those of two long-surviving members of The Few, Bob Doe and Keith Lawrence.  On the afternoon of 7 September the Luftwaffe made its first heavy daylight raid on London. 234 Squadron was amongst those scrambled to intercept the enemy bomber force as it retired; during the engagement, the squadron lost both Pat Hughes and its CO, Squadron Leader O'Brien. Two days later, the squadron was posted back to its old base at St Eval to be rested, receive replacement aircraft and train new pilots being posted in from OTUs \u2013 Operational Training Units; the squadron had lost 18 Spitfires in 4 weeks fighting.
