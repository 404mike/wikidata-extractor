Powell was noted for her receptiveness to cultural change in the cinema and coined many classic phrases about films and actors. She was one of the founder members of the Independent Television Authority (ITA), which launched commercial television in the UK, and also served as the second female president of the Classical Association. Powell was also the author of several books on films and her travels in Greece.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Citizen Kane", "response": ["In the UK C. A. Lejeune of The Observer called it \"The most exciting film that has come out of Hollywood in twenty-five years\" and Dilys Powell of The Sunday Times said the film's style was made \"with the ease and boldness and resource of one who controls and is not controlled by his medium.\" Edward Tangye Lean of Horizon praised the film's technical style, calling it \"perhaps a decade ahead of its contemporaries.\""]}, {"page": "Peter Sellers", "response": ["In 1962 Sellers played a retired British army general in John Guillermin's Waltz of the Toreadors, based on the play of the same name. The film was widely criticised for its slapstick cinematic adaption, and director Guillermin himself considered the film \"amateurish\". However, Sellers won the San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival Award for Best Actor and a BAFTA award nomination for his performance, and it was well received by critics. Stanley Kubrick asked Sellers to play the role of Clare Quilty in the 1962 film Lolita, opposite James Mason and Shelley Winters. Kubrick had seen Sellers in The Battle of the Sexes and listened to the album The Best of Sellers, and was impressed by the range of characters he could portray. Sellers was apprehensive about accepting the role, doubting his ability to successfully portray the part of a flamboyant American television playwright who was according to Sellers \"a fantastic nightmare, part homosexual, part drug addict, part sadist\". Kubrick encouraged Sellers to improvise and stated that he often reached a \"state of comic ecstasy\". Kubrick had American jazz producer Norman Granz record portions of the script for Sellers to listen to, so he could study the voice and develop confidence, granting Sellers a free artistic licence. Sellers later claimed that his relationship with Kubrick became one of the most rewarding of his career. Writing in The Sunday Times, Dilys Powell commented that Sellers gave \"a firework performance, funny, malicious, only once for a few seconds overreaching itself, and in the murder scene which is both prologue and epilogue achieving the macabre in comedy\". Towards the end of 1962, Sellers appeared in The Dock Brief, a legal satire directed by James Hill and co-starring Richard Attenborough.", "Sellers' biographer, Ed Sikov, notes that because of this retained dignity, Sellers is \"the master of playing men who have no idea how ridiculous they are.\" Social historian Sam Wasson notes the complexity in Sellers' performances in the Pink Panther films, which has the effect of alienating Clouseau from his environment. Wesson considers that \"As 'low' and 'high' comedy rolled into one, it's the performative counterpoint to Edwardian sophisticated naturalism\". This combination of \"high\" and \"low\", exemplified by Clouseau's attempting to retain dignity after a fall, means that within the film Clouseau was \"the sole representative of humanity\". Film critic Dilys Powell also saw the inherent dignity in the parts and wrote that Sellers had a \"balance between character and absurdity\". Richard Attenborough also thought that because of his sympathy, Sellers could \"inject into his characterisations the frailty and substance of a human being\"."]}, {"page": "The Red Shoes (1948 film)", "response": ["While the film had its detractors in Britain, it was lauded by some national critics, such as Dilys Powell, who deemed it an \"extreme pleasure\" and \"brilliantly experimental.\" Writing for The Monthly Film Bulletin, Marion Eames praised the performances of Shearer and Goring, as well as the score. The Daily Film Renter published a divisive review, noting that Powell and Pressburger \"have fumbled over a fine idea, and their opulent work trembles between the heights and the depths.\" Despite this, it was voted the third-best film of the year in a readers' poll by the Daily Mail, behind Spring in Park Lane and Oliver Twist."]}, {"page": "Wendy Hiller", "response": ["In 1984 she was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Manchester. In 1996, Hiller was honoured by the London Film Critics Circle with the Dilys Powell Award for excellence in British film. Her style was disciplined and unpretentious, and she disliked personal publicity. The writer Sheridan Morley described Hiller as being remarkable in her \"extreme untheatricality until the house lights went down, whereupon she would deliver a performance of breathtaking reality and expertise.\""]}, {"page": "It's That Man Again", "response": ["A prequel programme to series 10, \"Whither Tomtopia?\", was based in the idea that Handley had \"to face an enquiry into his governorship\" of the island. He faced questions from, among others, Dilys Powell\u2014the film critic from The Sunday Times\u2014the medical spokesman Dr Charles Hill and the author A. G. Street; the programme was chaired by Sir William Darling, MP. The remainder of the series dealt with Handley living in the fictional Castle WeeHoose in Scotland, where he was building a rocket to take him to the moon. In about week six of the series, the rocket was launched, but crash-landed on Tomtopia, where a new governor\u2014Percy Palaver, played by Deryck Guyler\u2014was in charge."]}, {"page": "Film (film)", "response": [":A \"load of old bosh.\" \u2013 Dilys Powell (The Sunday Times)"]}, {"page": "John Le Mesurier", "response": ["Following his appearance in Josephine and Men, John and Roy Boulting cast Le Mesurier as a psychiatrist in their 1956 Second World War film, Private's Progress. The cast featured many leading British actors of the time, including Ian Carmichael and Richard Attenborough. Dilys Powell, reviewing for The Sunday Times, thought that the cast was \"embellished\" by Le Mesurier's presence, among others. Later in 1956 Le Mesurier again appeared alongside Attenborough, with small roles in Jay Lewis's The Baby and the Battleship and Roy Boulting's Brothers in Law, the latter of which also featured Carmichael and Terry-Thomas. He was also active in television, in a variety of roles in episodes of Douglas Fairbanks Presents, a series of short dramas.", "Le Mesurier's friendship with Tony Hancock provided a further source of work when Hancock asked him to be one of the regular supporting actors in Hancock's Half Hour, when it moved from radio to television. Le Mesurier subsequently appeared in seven episodes of the show between 1957 and 1960, and then in an episode of a follow-up series entitled Hancock. In 1958 he appeared in ten films, among them Roy Boulting's comedy Happy Is the Bride, about which Dilys Powell wrote in The Sunday Times: \"[M]y vote for the most entertaining contributions\u00a0... goes to the two fathers, John Le Mesurier and Cecil Parker\". In 1959, the busiest year of his career, Le Mesurier took part in 13 films, including I'm All Right Jack, which was the most successful of Le Mesurier's credited films that year; he also had an uncredited role as a doctor in Ben-Hur."]}, {"page": "Bournemouth", "response": ["Authors Radclyffe Hall (1880\u20131943) Your Dictionary website  retrieved 28 September 2017 poet and author, who wrote The Well of Loneliness a groundbreaking work in lesbian literature came from Bournemouth and Dilys Powell CBE (1901\u20131995) The Independent website;  Obituary, Dilys Powell  retrieved 28 September 2017 journalist, film critic of The Sunday Times for over fifty years went to school there.
