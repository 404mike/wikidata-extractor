Different centuries and different states gave it a fluctuating character.  However, the basic lance of three men; a knight, a squire who served as a fighting auxiliary, and a non-combatant squire, primarily concerned on the battlefield with looking after the knight's spare horses or lances, seems to evolve in the 13th century An excellent description to convey its relevance is in Howard, \"a team of half a dozen men, like the crew of some enormous battle tank\".  The 13th-century French rule of the Templars had specified that a brother knight should have one squire if he had one warhorse, two if he had an extra one.  In addition, he had a riding horse and a packhorse.  In battle the squires would follow the brothers with the spare warhorses.Matthew Bennett (1989) La R\u00e9gle du Temple as a Military Manual or How to Deliver a Cavalry Charge  in Studies in Medieval History presented to R.

The most famous of these battles were Crecy, Poitiers and Agincourt. The English tactical system relied on a combination of longbowmen and heavy infantry, such as dismounted men-at-arms. Difficult to deploy in a thrusting mobile offensive, the longbow was best used in a defensive configuration. Against mounted enemies, the bowmen took up a defensive position and unleashed clouds of arrows into the ranks of knights and men-at-arms.  The ranks of the bowmen were extended in thin lines and protected and screened by pits (e.g. Crecy), stakes (e.g. Agincourt) or trenches (e.g. Morlaix). There is some academic controversy about how the longbowmen and heavy infantry related on the battlefield. According to the traditional view articulated by A.H. Burne, the bowmen were deployed in a \"V\" between divisions of infantry, enabling them to trap and enfilade their foes. Other, more recent, historians such as Matthew Bennett dispute this, holding that the archers were normally deployed on the flanks of the army as a whole, rather than between divisions."]}, {"page": "Society of Ancients", "response": ["  Contributing writers include noted historians such as Adrian GoldsworthySlingshot issues 185, 186, 197, 199, 213, 218, 220, 223, 252 and Boris Rankov.Slingshot 257 Other professional historians who have written for Slingshot include Philip Sabin, Matthew Bennett, Guy Halsall, Paddy Griffith, Nigel Tallis and Steve Badsey.
