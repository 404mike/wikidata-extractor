A 1987 move to Dundee brought a similar number of appearances in only three seasons and saw Angus move to Motherwell. In his first season at Fir Park, he helped them on their way to victory in the Scottish Cup, scoring in the 4\u20133 win against Dundee United. In 1994, Angus left Motherwell and joined Clyde, playing in the majority of matches over the next two seasons. His finest moment as a Clyde player came when he scored the opening goal against Rangers in the Scottish Cup, though Clyde went on to lose 4\u20131. A spell at Albion Rovers added a few more appearances. Angus made one League Cup appearance for Stirling Albion at the start of the 1998\u201399 season.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1983 European Cup Winners' Cup Final", "response": ["|MF ||16|| Ian Angus"]}, {"page": "Aberdeen F.C. in European football", "response": ["* Ian Angus"]}, {"page": "1991 Scottish Cup Final", "response": ["Motherwell won the match 4\u20133 after extra time was played.  They took the lead when Iain Ferguson headed in just after 30 minutes had been played. In the second half, Dundee United equalized through Dave Bowman. Motherwell went back in front thanks to 18-year-old Phil O'Donnell and their lead was then extended to 3-1 by Ian Angus. However, two goals from United, one from John O'Neil and a last minute equaliser from Darren Jackson made the score 3\u20133, forcing the match into extra-time.

He was able to carry on after receiving treatment, but was in clear discomfort. Dundee United equalised on 55 minutes when Dave Bowman struck a 25-yard shot past the struggling Maxwell. Motherwell retook the lead a mere three minutes later when a Davie Cooper free-kick was flicked on by John Clark and headed past Alan Main by Phil O'Donnell. The Steelmen further extended their lead on 65 minutes when an Ian Angus shot from the edge of the penalty box flew into the top corner of the goal.", "|MF |||| Ian Angus"]}, {"page": "Ian Angus", "response": ["Ian Angus may refer to:", "* Ian Angus (activist) (born 1945), Canadian socialist and ecosocialist activist", "* Ian Angus (footballer) (born 1964), Scottish former footballer", "* Ian Angus (librarian), British librarian and editor", "* Ian Angus (philosopher) (born 1949), Canadian interdisciplinary philosopher"]}]}}
