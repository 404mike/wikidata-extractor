Based in Colchester (a town recorded in a vast number of his photographs), but born in Islington, London, \"he was an advocate of the real as against the sham studio accessory.\"  At the time of his death, Gill was President of the Professional Photographers' Association. A contributor to a number of magazines, his death was widely reported in photographic circles, such as by Wilson's Photographic Magazine:\n\nMr. Gill's work will be remembered for its good qualities and home portrait effects secured by the use of window effects.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Gill", "response": ["William Gill may refer to:", "* William Gill (sea captain) (1795\u20131858), Manx master mariner", "* William Gill (explorer) (1843\u20131882), British explorer and intelligence gatherer, companion of William Mesny", "* William Gill (photographer) (1854\u20131912), British photographer", "* William Gill (boxer) (fl. 2007\u20132009), American boxer", "* William Gillies (disambiguation)"]}]}}
