Horton initially told chairman Peter Swales that \"we have the makings, the backbone of a really good squad\" and that he was satisfied in not making many additions if it meant keeping hold of the existing squad; he cancelled a pre-arranged sale of Steve Lomas to Preston North End. City's previous three seasons in the top-flight had yielded top-ten finishes but Horton struggled with injuries \u2013 key striker Niall Quinn was missing through a cruciate ligament injury \u2013 and City were 20th and bottom in mid-February.

However they won only four of their remaining 25 league games, finishing just four points clear of relegation, and Horton was sacked. His sacking was predicted by many, as Francis Lee had taken over as chairman after Horton's appointment, and wished to have his 'own man' in the dugout at Maine Road.
