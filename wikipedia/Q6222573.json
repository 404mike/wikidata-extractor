The show was first broadcast on the BBC on 14 June 1958. It developed into a regular 45-minute show on Saturday evening prime-time television in a sing-along format with both solo and minstrel pieces (often with extended segueing), some country and western and music derived from other foreign folk cultures. The male minstrels performed in blackface; the female dancers and other supporting artists did not. The show included comedy interludes performed by Leslie Crowther, George Chisholm and Stan Stennett. It was initially produced by George Inns with George Mitchell. The minstrels' main soloists were baritone Dai Francis, tenor John Boulter, and bass Tony Mercer.Television Heaven  During the nine years that the show was broadcast in black and white, the blackface makeup was actually red, as black did not register as well.", "In the spring of 1962, the BBC musical variety show, The Black and White Minstrel Show, was to open at the Victoria Palace Theatre.
