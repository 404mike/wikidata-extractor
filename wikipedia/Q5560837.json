Barrie sued for divorce on the grounds of infidelity; the divorce was granted in October 1909. Knowing how painful the divorce was for him, some of Barrie's friends wrote to a number of newspaper editors asking them not to publish the story. In the event, only three newspapers did.

It was advertised in the spring of 1913 and was taken by  Gilbert Cannan and his new wife Mary (n\u00e9e Ansell), who had previously been married to J. M. Barrie, the creator of Peter Pan.  The Cannans immediately set about decorating the mill house property in an avantgarde style and the mill tower into an impromptu studio. Land was acquired at the rear of the property to create a garden.  They invited their many friends and acquaintances, many of whom were associated with two artists' groups, the Bloomsbury Group and the lesser well-known London Group which were both prominent around the time of the First World War.

He painted a famous picture of the mill called Gilbert Cannan at his Mill now on show in the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. The picture depicts Cannan outside the Mill with his two dogs. One of them, which is black and white in colour, is believed to be a dog that had previously belonged to the Barries. The original inspiration for Nana in the book Peter Pan and the model for the illustrations of the dog in the first edition of  Peter Pan was Porthos, the Barries' St Bernard. When Porthos subsequently died the Barries replaced him with Luath, a Landseer (black and white Newfoundland) dog whose behaviour was studied by the actor who played Nana in the first stage production of Peter Pan. The costume worn in this production was also black and white. The Mill was dubbed 'a poor man's Garsington' by those who also frequented Garsington Manor near Oxford, the artists' retreat of Lady Ottoline Morrell also a frequent guest at the mill. Compton Mackenzie was a regular visitor and based characters in his magnum opus, The Four Winds of Love  on the Cannans and Lawrences.
