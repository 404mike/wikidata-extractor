Black also points out that \"the frequency of his references and his willingness to offer racial stereotypes [was] typical of many writers of his age\". The writer Louise Welsh observes that \"Live and Let Die taps into the paranoia that some sectors of white society were feeling\" as the civil rights movements challenged prejudice and inequality. That insecurity manifested itself in opinions shared by Fleming with the intelligence industry, that the American National Association for the Advancement of Colored People was a communist front. The communist threat was brought home to Jamaica with the 1952 arrest of the Jamaican politician Alexander Bustamante by the American authorities while he was on official business in Puerto Rico, despite the fact that he was avowedly anti-communist. During the course of the year local Jamaican political parties had also expelled members for being communists."]}, {"page": "Zo\u00eb Strachan", "response": ["Strachan grew up in Kilmarnock, Ayrshire.
