During the 1932\u201333 season, he joined First Division side Bolton Wanderers for a fee of \u00a3300 but struggled to establish himself in the first-team at Burnden Park, despite being a consistent scorer for the club's reserve side in the Central League. Having made just 26 league appearances in nearly four seasons with the club, he was allowed to join Third Division South side Cardiff City, following former Bolton teammate George Nicholson who had made the same move one month before. The Bluebirds struggled in the bottom half of the table for the majority of his time there and, despite arriving three months into the season, he finished as the club's top scorer during his first season at Ninian Park. He left the club in 1939 to join Walsall, making three appearances at the start of the 1939\u201340 season before the Football League was suspended following the outbreak of World War II."]}]}}
