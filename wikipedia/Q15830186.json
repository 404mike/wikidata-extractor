Northumberland Fusiliers. In 1900, he wrote to the Quaker magazine The Friend, claiming many members of the movement\u2014known as the Society of Friends\u2014shared his views but hid behind the Quakers' pacifist stance, \"bringing on the Society the shadow of hypocrisy\". His father also supported the war, rankling other Quakers, and causing John Wilhelm Rowntree to write to Rufus Jones in indignation, claiming that \"[y]ou would hardly believe your eyes if you came over here. Thos. Hodgkin's son a Lieutenant, though still a nominal Quaker, heads a procession to burn Kruger in effigy, T. Hodgkin makes the speech and Lily [Lucy?] Hodgkin lights the faggots ... the spirit of war, stalks the land naked, unashamed & our leading Quaker gives his benediction!\" Not all agreed; Caroline Stephen wrote to Robert Hodgkin's mother that there was \"much of nobleness ... much that appeals to all one's best feelings\" in what he had done. Hodgkin was ultimately forced to leave the Society of Friends due to his military service in the Second Boer War. Later, during the First World War years of 1914 to 1919, he would return to the regiment as a captain in the Seventh Battalion. He was at the War Office from 1917 to 1919, serving in the General Staff for Operations."]}]}}
