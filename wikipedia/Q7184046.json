Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online.", "Sertorius was born in Nursia (a town whose people had received Roman citizenship in 268 BC) in Sabine territory around 126 BC. The Sertorius family were minor aristocrats, almost certainly Equites Romani, the class directly below the senatorial class. His father died before he became of age and his mother, Rhae, focused all her energies on raising her only son. She made sure he received the best education possible for a young man of his status. In return, according to Plutarch, he became excessively fond of his mother. Like many other young domi nobiles Sertorius moved to Rome in his mid-to-late teens trying to make it big as an orator and jurist.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the struggle for Spain, pp 2-3.", "After his undistinguished career in Rome as a jurist and an orator, he entered the military. His first recorded campaign was under Quintus Servilius Caepio and ended at the Battle of Arausio in 105 BC, where he showed unusual courage. Serving under Gaius Marius, Sertorius succeeded in spying on the wandering Germanic tribes that had defeated Caepio.Lynda Telford, Sulla A Dictator Reconsidered, p.57; Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, pp 6-7; Plutarch, Life of Sertorius, 3. After this success, he almost certainly fought at the great Battle of Aquae Sextiae (now Aix-en-Provence, France) in 102 BC in which the Teutones and the Ambrones were decisively defeated.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the struggle for Spain, p.11. He probably also fought at the Battle of Vercellae in 101 BC, where the Cimbri were decisively defeated, ending the German invasion.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the struggle for Spain, p.15. A few years after the Cimbric wars, Sertorius's patron Gaius Marius fell out of grace for his support of the demagogue Lucius Appuleius Saturninus and he and Sertorius had to get out of Rome for a while. Sertorius travelled to Hispania Ulterior and served its governor, Titus Didius, as a military tribune. He distinguished himself by putting down an insurrection in and around Castulo and was awarded the Grass Crown.Plutarch, Life of Marius, 27; Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the struggle for Spain, p.17.", "In 91 BC, he was elected quaestor and served in Cisalpine Gaul, where he was in charge of recruiting and training legionaries for the Social War. During the war he sustained a wound that cost him the use of one of his eyes.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the struggle for Spain, p. 22; Plutarch, Life of Sertorius, 8. ", "In 88 BC, after being sidelined by his political opponents, Sulla marched his legions on Rome and took the capital. He took revenge on his enemies and forced Marius into exile, Sulla then left Italy to fight the First Mithridatic War against Mithridates VI of Pontus. After Sulla left, violence erupted between the optimates, led by the consul Gnaeus Octavius, and the populares, led by the consul Lucius Cornelius Cinna. Sertorius, being a former subordinate of Marius, declared for Cinna and the populares.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, p.26 When Cinna was driven from Rome he and Sertorius started recruiting ex-legionaries and drumming up enough support to enable them, in their turn, to march on Rome. Though he had a very bad opinion of Marius by then, he consented to Marius's return upon understanding that Marius came at Cinna's request and not of his own accord.", "In October of 87 BC, Cinna marched on Rome, Sertorius commanded one of Cinna's divisions and fought a battle with troops commanded by Pompeius Strabo.John Leach, Pompey the Great, p.20; Lynda Telford, Sulla A Dictator Reconsidered, p.111; Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, p.27. After Octavius surrendered Rome to the forces of Marius, Cinna, and Sertorius, Sertorius abstained from the proscriptions his fellow commanders engaged in. Sertorius went so far as to rebuke Marius, and move Cinna to moderation.Lynda Telford, Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered, p. 114. After Marius's death he annihilated Marius's slave army which was still terrorizing Rome.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, pp 28-29; Lynda Telford, Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered, p. 115.", "The years 87-84 BC are often described as spent 'waiting for Sulla'.E. Badian, Waiting for Sulla, Journal of Roman Studies, vol 52 (1962), pp 47-61. Marius died in January 86 BC. Cinna was murdered in 84 BC, lynched by his own troops. It is probable that Sertorius became praetor in the year Cinna died.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, pp 29-31.", "On Sulla's return from the East in 83 BC a civil war broke out. Sertorius, a praetor now, was called upon to serve in the government's armies. When the consul Scipio Asiaticus marched against Sulla, Sertorius was part of his staff. Sulla arrived in Campania and found the other consul, Gaius Norbanus, blocking the road to Capua. At the Battle of Mount Tifata Sulla inflicted a crushing defeat on Norbanus, with Norbanus losing six thousand of his men to Sulla's seventy.Lynda Telford, Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered, p.162; John Leach, Pompey the Great. p. 25; Philip Matyszak, Cataclysm 90 BC, p. 133.  The beaten Norbanus withdrew with the remnants of his army to Capua. Sulla was stopped in his pursuit by Scipio's advance. However, Scipio was unwilling to risk a battle and started negotiations. Sertorius did not trust Sulla, and advised Scipio to force a decisive action. Instead he was sent to Norbanus to explain that an armistice was in force and negotiations were underway. Sertorius made a detour along his way and captured the town of Suessa which had gone over to Sulla. When Sulla complained to Scipio about this breach of trust he was given back his hostages as a sign of good faith. This behavior of their commander caused Scipio's troops to lose faith in him. Unwilling to fight Sulla's battle hardened veterans they defected. Scipio and his son were found cowering in their tents and brought to Sulla, who released them after extracting a promise that they would never again fight against him or rejoin Carbo.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, pp 32-33; Lynda Telford, Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered, pp 162-165; John Leach, Pompey the Great. p. 25; Philip Matyszak, Cataclysm 90 BC, pp 133-134.  In 82 BC, Marius' son, Gaius Marius the Younger, became consul without having held the offices which a candidate for the consulship should have held, and at the unconstitutional age of 27. Sertorius, who probably qualified for the office, objected but his opinion was ignored.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, p. 32. Plutarch sums up the events:", "After having fallen out with the new populares leadership Sertorius was sent to Hispania as propraetor, representing the Cinna-Marian faction and their cause in Spain.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, pp 32-33; Plutarch, Life of Sertorius, 6. When Sertorius marched through the Pyrenees mountain range he ran into severe weather and a mountain tribe which demanded a tribute for allowing his passage. His companions indignantly claimed it was an outrage; but while they considered it disgraceful to give in to extortion, Sertorius simply paid the tribe and commented that he was buying himself time, and that if a man had a lot to do, nothing is more precious than time.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, p. 52; Plutarch, Life of Sertorius, 6. The governor of the two Spanish provinces, Hispania Ulterior and Hispania Citerior, Gaius Valerius Flaccus did not recognize his authority, but Sertorius had an army at his back and used it to assume control. Then he persuaded the local chieftains of accepting him as the new governor and endeared himself with the general population by cutting taxes.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, p. 53; Plutarch, Life of Sertorius, 6. After gaining control of both provinces Sertorius sought to hold them by sending an army, under Julius Salinator, to fortify the pass through the Pyrenees; however, Sulla's forces, under the command of Gaius Annius Luscus, broke through after Salinator was assassinated by Calpurnius Lanarius, who defected to the Sullans.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, p. 57; Plutarch, Life of Sertorius, 7.", "Unable to convince the Spanish tribes to fight for him, Sertorius was seriously outnumbered and he decided to abandon his provinces. With 3,000 of his most loyal followers he fled to Mauritania, but was driven off by the locals who wanted no part of his rebellion.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, pp 57-58. He then fell in with a band of Cilician pirates who were pillaging the Spanish coast. Together they attacked and took Pityussa, the most southerly of the Balearic Islands, which they started using as a base. When this was reported to Annius Luscus, he sent a fleet of warships and almost a full legion which drove Sertorius and his pirate allies from the Balearics.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, p. 59. The pirates defected and went to Africa to help install the tyrant AscalisA local client of Sulla on the throne of Tingis. Sertorius followed them to Africa, rallied the locals in the vicinity of Tingis, who were unhappy with Ascalis for they saw him as a puppet of Sulla, and defeated Ascalis's men and the pirates in battle.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, pp 60-61.", "After gaining control over Tingis, Sertorius defeated Paccianus, one of Sulla's generals, who had been sent to put Ascalis on the throne.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the struggle for Spain, pp 60-61; Plutarch, Life of Sertorius, 9.", "The North African success won him the fame and admiration of the people of Hispania, particularly that of the warlike Lusitanians in the west, whom Roman generals and proconsuls of Sulla's party had plundered and oppressed. The Lusitanians, being threatened by a Sullan governor again, asked Sertorius to be their war leader. Sertorius decided to accept the Lusitanian offer and prepared his army and fleet to return to Hispania.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, p. 63.", "On a moonless night in the year 80 BC, Sertorius sailed his forces from Tingis across the Gibraltar strait back to Hispania.He chose a moonless night in order to remain undetected, but was detected nevertheless. A small fleet from the coastal town of Mellaria tried to stop him, but he pushed them aside and landed his army at the small fishing town of Baelo near the Pillars of Hercules.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, pp 63-64. After being reinforced by the Lusitanians he marched on Fufidius, the local Roman governor, intent on defeating him to strengthen his support and prestige. At the Battle of the Baetis River, fought at the Baetis estuary, he defeated Fufidius and started to consolidate his power in Hispania.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, pp 64-65.", "In 76 BC, after Sertorius had been reinforced by the rebel army of Marcus Perperna, the Roman Senate resorted to giving an extraordinary command (pro consulibus) to Gnaeus Pompey Magnus to help out Metellus who was doing miserably against Sertorius.Plutarch, Life of Pompey, 17. Pompey recruited a large army from among his father's and Sulla's veterans and marched to Spain. Confident of success he engaged Sertorius at the Battle of Lauron in eastern Spain only to suffer a major defeat.Frontinus, Stratagems, 2.5.31; Plutarch, Life of Pompey, 18.3; Plutarch, Life of Sertorius, 18; John Leach, Pompey the Great, pp.226-227; Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, pp 96-101.", "The turning point came in 75 BC when Pompey and Metellus started scoring victories against Sertorius's subordinates. Pompey defeated Sertorius's legates Perperna and Herrenius at the Battle of ValentiaPlutarch, Life of Pompey, 18; John Leach, Pompey the Great, p.48; Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, pp 117-118. and Metellus defeated Hirtuleius at the Battle of Italica.Livy, Epitome, 91.4; Frontinus, Stratagems, 2.1.2 and 2.3.5; John Leach, Pompey the Great, p.47; Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, pp.118-119.

From then on Sertorius refrained from fighting battles and reverted to guerrilla warfare. Although Pompey and Metellus had gained the initiative, the war was far from over. Sertorius still enjoyed the support of the inland tribes and their warriors still flocked to his cause.", "For six years he held sway over Hispania. In 76 BC, he was joined \u2014 at the insistence of the forces he brought with him \u2014 by Marcus Perpenna Vento, with a following of Roman and Italian aristocrats and a sizeable Roman-style army of fifty-three cohorts. In the same year, Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus (now better known as Pompey) was sent to help Metellus take back Hispania and crush Sertorius's rebellion. Contemptuously calling Pompey 'the young pup' and Metellus 'the old woman' Sertorius proved himself more than a match for his adversaries. After the Battle of Lauron, in which he out-generaled Pompey and massacred part of his army, he razed the city (proving Pompey and Metellus could not protect their allies). In 75 BC, Pompey and Metellus made a comeback, Pompey defeated Sertorius' legates Herrenius and Perpenna in the Battle of Valentia and Metellus was able to crush another Sertorian army when he defeated Hirtuleius at the Battle of Italica. Sertorius responded by marching against Pompey and nearly capturing him at the Battle of Sucro, when Pompey decided to fight him without waiting for Metellus. After these battles Sertorius was indecisively beaten at the Battle of Saguntum and had to revert to guerrilla combat again. Pompey wrote to Rome for reinforcements, without which, he said, he and Metellus would be driven from Hispania. With these reinforcements Pompey and Metellus were gaining the upper hand, grinding down their enemy by war of attrition, capturing stronghold after stronghold. Though Sertorius was still able to win some victories, he was losing the war, and his authority over his men was declining. He lost much of his acumen and authority, descending into alcoholism and debaucheryPhilip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, p. 152.", "Perperna and his fellow conspirator invited Sertorius to a feast to celebrate a supposed victory. While under most circumstances, any festivities to which Sertorius was invited were conducted with great propriety, this particular feast was vulgar, designed to offend the skillful general and get him off his couch and among the crowd where a knife could be shoved through his ribs without difficulty. Disgusted, Sertorius changed his posture on the couch, intent on ignoring them all. This presented something of a problem as Sertorius, although in late middle age, had a well deserved reputation as a skilled fighter. They changed their tactic, Perperna gave the signal to his fellow conspirators, and they rushed and stabbed the unsuspecting Sertorius until he was dead.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the struggle for Spain, pp 153-154.", "Upon learning of the death of Sertorius, some of his Iberian allies sent ambassadors to Pompey or to Metellus and made peace, most simply went home. To make matters worse for Perperna when Sertorius's will was read he had named him his chief beneficiary. Perperna already disgraced as the man who had slain his commander, the man who had given him sanctuary, was now also revealed to have killed his main benefactor and friend. And now that he was dead, the virtues of Sertorius were remembered, and his recent atrocities forgotten.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, pp 156-157."]}, {"page": "Social War (91\u201387 BC)", "response": ["* By mid-autumn, the peace had irrevocably broken down.

Also, Edward Bunbury believed the name of Getae, by which they were originally known to the Greeks on the Euxine, was always retained by the latter in common usage: while that of Dacians, whatever be its origin, was that by which the more western tribes, adjoining the Pannonians, first became known to the Romans.

After he found out Pompey and a very large army had been sent to defeat him (on route to the Iberian Peninsula and the war against Sertorius) he decided to take his forces to Hispania.Plutarch, Life of Sertorius, 15; Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, pp.86-93.", "Sertorius welcomed Perperna and his troops (a sizeable force of 53 cohorts) and put them to good use.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, p.91.

Pompey managed to cross the Ebro unhindered and marched to the plain of Valentia where he came to grips with Sertorius himself (see: Battle of Lauron).John Leach, Pompey the Great p.46.", "After the Valentia disaster Sertorius himself returned to the eastern theatre (he had been in the west of the Iberian Peninsula campaigning against Metellus) to take command of the fight against Pompey. Perperna was given command of a substantial force to block Metellus from coming to Pompey's aid. Sertorius tried to take out Pompey at the Battle of Sucro while Perperna tried to stop Metellus, both failed.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, pp 121-122.", "At the battle of Saguntum Perperna was in command of one of the wings of Sertorius' army. He fought Pompey then had to switch places with his commander and took on Metellus. During the battle, the biggest of the war, Perperna lost 6,000 men. After the battle Sertorius and Perperna withdrew inland and reverted to guerilla warfare.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, pp 127-128.", "In 74 BC, while Sertorius focused his attention on defending his allies in celtiberia, Perperna circumvented the Romans operating in the interior and marched to the Iberian westcoast where he took the city of Cale.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, p. 146.", "Perperna then proceeded to invite Sertorius to a feast to celebrate a supposed victory. While under most circumstances, any festivities to which Sertorius was invited were conducted with great propriety, this particular feast was vulgar, designed to offend the skillful general. Disgusted, Sertorius changed his posture on the couch, intent on ignoring them all. At this, Perperna gave the signal to his fellow conspirators, and they murdered the unsuspecting Sertorius on the spot.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, pp 153-154.", "Upon learning of the death of Sertorius, some of his Iberian allies sent ambassadors to Pompey or to Metellus and made peace, most simply went home. Now that Sertorius was dead, his virtues were remembered, and his recent atrocities forgotten.Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, pp 156-157.", "* Philip Matyszak, Sertorius and the Struggle for Spain, 2013."]}, {"page": "Matyszak, P.", "response": ["#REDIRECT Philip Matyszak"]}, {"page": "First Battle of Clusium (82 BC)", "response": ["Philip Matyszak disagrees:", "::Though Carbo thereby succeeded in checking Sulla's northern advance, it appears he achieved this by pulling manpower from other government forces operating in the north.

Sulla was campaigning in Greece and Macedon fighting against the forces of king Mithridates of Pontus (see: First Mithridatic War).Brennan, The Praetorship in the Roman Republic, p. 526. Flaccus probably employed experienced troops, drawing his recruits from veterans of the recent Social War, but due to a lack of funds he was only able to raise two legions . In 86 or 85 BC Flaccus took his legions through Epirus, Macedon and Thrace to the Hellespont (to cross over into Asia Minor). Flaccus was unpopular with his troops and by the time they had reached the Bosporus one of his legates, a man named Fimbria, taking advantage of Flaccus\u2019s absence, incited a mutiny. Flaccus returned to his army, failed to put down the mutiny, tried to flee, but was hunted down and executed. Fimbria cut off his head and hurled it into the sea. The Valerians now became the Fimbrians.Philip Matyszak, Mithridates the Great, Rome's Indomitable Enemy, pp 81-82.", "As Mithridates awaited his fleet at Pitane on the northwestern coast of Asia Minor, the Fimbrians surprised him again, appearing at the gates of Pitane and besieging the town. Soon after a Roman fleet arrived under the command of Lucius Licinius Lucullus, a legate of Sulla. Although this fleet could have completed the encirclement and prevented Mithridates from escaping Pitane, Sulla\u2014the chief political opponent of Fimbria's faction in Rome\u2014had signed a separate armistice with Mithridates and Lucullus did not interfere when the Pontic fleet arrived to evacuate the king.Philip Matyszak, Mithridates the Great, pp 85-86.", "After failing to capture Mithridates, Fimbria allowed his troops to pillage several cities, most prominently razing Ilium to the ground. Unfortunately for Fimbria, Sulla and his much larger army eventually approached and laid siege to Fimbria's camp. At this point Fimbria's men turned on him, once again deserting their commander. After a failed attempt at arranging Sulla's assassination, Fimbria committed suicide. When Sulla left Asia Minor to fight another civil war in Italy, he left the Fimbrians in Asia Minor to guard the Roman provinces.Philip Matyszak, Mithridates the Great, pp 89-90.", "In 83 BC one of Mithridates' generals, Archelaus, defected to the Romans. Archelaus convinced Lucius Licinius Murena, the Roman general tasked with protecting Bithynia, that Mithridates was planning another war with Rome. Murena marched his army, including the Fimbrians, across the river Halys into Pontic territory. This operation was less an invasion than a large-scale raid for plunder. The next year Murena repeated his actions, looting as many as 400 villages before Mithridates counterattacked. The Pontic king defeated the Roman force and drove Murena back to Bithynia. Subsequently, Aulus Gabinius, a representative of Sulla, arrived from Rome with instructions to cease all hostilities. This concluded the Second Mithridatic War.Philip Matyszak, Mithridates the Great, pp 93-96.", "Lucullus had planned to invade Pontus before going after Mithridates himself, but he received word that his colleague, the proconsul Marcus Aurelius Cotta, had been defeated in battle and was now under siege in Chalcedon. Lucullus altered his plans and marched to Cotta's rescue. Meanwhile, Mithridates had moved on to besieging Cyzicus. When Lucullus arrived near Cyzicus, he decided against engaging the numerically superior Pontic army. Similarly, Mithridates was reluctant to risk battle against the capable Lucullus, who eventually managed to trap the king's army on the cyzicus peninsula in a counter-siege. The siege of Cyzicus ended when Mithridates finally withdrew his army, weakened by disease and starvation.Lee Fratantuono, Lucullus, pp 57-61; Philip Matyszak, Mithridates the Great, pp 106-113.", "The next year Lucullus invaded Pontus. Here he finally allowed the Fimbrians to plunder and pillage.Philip Matyszak, Mithridates the Great, p.118. Mithridates' army disintegrated after the Battle of Cabira, whereupon the Pontic king fled east to the court of his son-in-law king Tigranes II of Armenia. When negotiations with Tigranes failed, Lucullus invaded Armenia and won victories at Tigranocerta and Artaxata. Unable to beat Lucullus in open battle, Tigranes and Mithridates began resorting to hit-and-run tactics. Winter forced Lucullus to march westward at the end of 68 BC. After 18 years of service and 960 miles (1,500 km) of marching in the last five years, the Fimbrians refused to accompany Lucullus when he marched to besiege Nisibis in northern Mesopotamia.Philip Matyszak, Mithridates the Great, p.139. They stayed on garrison duty in Pontus, where they were caught off guard by Mithridates when he suddenly returned to his kingdom in 67 BC at the head of a combined Armenian-Pontic army.Philip Matyszak, Mithridates the Great, p.140. It is unclear whether the Fimbrians fought at the disastrous Battle of Zela that year, but their continued existence as two legions in 66 BC suggests that they probably did not.", "In 66 BC the Roman general Pompey arrived in the East. Pompey had been given the command of the war against Mithridates and his allies. Pompey officially relieved Lucullus of his command and reenlisted most of his troops, including the Fimbrians.John Leach, Pompey the Great, p.76. In Pontus Pompey caught up with and defeated Mithridates' army at the Battle of the Lycus, but the Pontic king escaped yet again.John Leach, Pompey the Great, pp 79-80; Philip Matyszak, Mithridates the Great, pp 150-151. Unable to catch Mithridates, Pompey decided to attack Mithridates's allies: Tigranes, the Caucasian Iberians and the Caucasian Albanians. Before he advanced into Armenia, Pompey reduced the numbers of his army and granted some of his long-serving soldiers (almost certainly including the Fimbrians) their discharge, settling them in a new city called Nicopolis.John Leach, Pompey the Great, p.82.", "* Philip Matyszak, Mithridates the Great, Rome's indomitable enemy, 2008."]}]}}
