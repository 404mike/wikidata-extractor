The British general also vented his fury on a new cavalry regiment, writing, \"The 18th Hussars are a disgrace to the name of soldier, in action as well as elsewhere; and I propose to draft their horses from them and send the men to England if I cannot get the better of them in any other manner.\" (On 8April 1814, the 18th redeemed their reputation in a gallant charge led by Lieutenant-colonel Sir Henry Murray at Croix d'Orade, shortly before the Battle of Toulouse.)"]}, {"page": "David Murray, 2nd Earl of Mansfield", "response": ["* General Sir Henry Murray (1784\u20131860), who married Emily, daughter of Gerard de Vism\u00e9, and had children.", "Lord Mansfield died in September 1796 and his body laid to rest with his uncle, the 1st Earl, in Westminster Abbey.
