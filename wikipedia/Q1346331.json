He was inspired to write the song after seeing British soldiers patrolling the streets of Belfast. He stated, \"I made my first trip to Belfast in 1978 and saw mere boys walking around in battle dress with automatic weapons. They were no longer just on the evening news. These snapshot experiences exploded into visions of mercenaries and imperial armies around the world. The song was based on the premise 'they always get a working class boy to do the killing'\". Costello's family had roots in the Northern Ireland conflict; as his father, Ross McManus, recalled, Oliver's Army' is an important track for me.. My grandfather was an Ulster Catholic, and as a child, I lived in an area where bigotry was rife\". Costello's Irish grandfather, Pat McManus, had served as a British soldier during World War I and the Easter Rising."]}, {"page": "R.

The adverts featured actor Julian Chagrin in pyjamas creeping downstairs to raid the fridge for R. Whites Lemonade. Ross McManus wrote and sang the advert's song, with his son Declan McManus \u2013 later known by his stage name Elvis Costello \u2013 providing the backing vocals. An alternative, unaired version of the advert featured Costello and his father onstage, as the 'Secret Lemonade Drinker' fantasised about being a rock star.McManus, Declan (2015), pp.156-157 Unfaithful Music & Disappearing Ink.
