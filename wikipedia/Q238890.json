The report resulted in the first major published criticism of Wheeler, produced by the young archaeologist Nowell Myres in a review for Antiquity; although stating that there was much to praise about the work, he critiqued Wheeler's selective excavation, dubious dating, and guesswork.

Professor Frederick Zeuner, then Professor of Environmental Archaeology at the Institute of Archaeology and one of the founders of zoo-archaeology  recommended that she take a degree in zoology before undertaking further study in zooarchaeology. She therefore studied zoology at the Chelsea College of Science and Technology and graduated with a first class Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree. She returned to the Institute of Archaeology to undertake post-graduate study in zooarchaeology under Zeuner. She completed her Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree in 1962 with a thesis on \"mammalian faunas from sites in India and western Asia\". She also attended lectures by Gordon Childe, Kathleen Kenyon and Max Mallowan, which gave her a solid background in the archaeology of Central Europe and the Middle East.

It was here that he developed an interest in archaeology after volunteering to excavate at the Bronze Age site of Snail Down and Arcy sur Cure in France. In 1957, he was offered a place at St Catharine's College, Cambridge to read archaeology and anthropology. However, being too young for National Service, he spent two years at the Institute of Archaeology, London University, specialising in the archaeology of the western Roman provinces under Sheppard Frere. His teachers included Sir Max Mallowan, the husband of Agatha Christie, and Dame Kathleen Kenyon. During his time at the Institute, he excavated at the Roman city of Verulamium, and the Iron Age site of Camp du Charlat in France. In 1959, he went up to Cambridge, and studied the Neolithic Bronze and Iron Ages of Europe. His contemporaries included Lord Renfrew of Kaimsthorn, Sir Barry Cunliffe, Sir Paul Mellars and Queen Margrethe of Denmark. He took a double first, was elected a Scholar of his college in 1960, and played for Cambridge University against Oxford in the University rugby matches of 1961-62."]}, {"page": "Stepped Stone Structure", "response": ["Macalister, the first to excavate the structure in the 1920s, called the remains he had found a \"ramp\" and believed it to be Jebusite.

After the discoveries by Kenyon and Shiloh, some scholars have suggested that the structure might be a retaining wall, or a fortress.

The technique originates from the work of Mortimer Wheeler and Tessa Wheeler at Verulamium (1930\u201335), and was later refined by Kathleen Kenyon during her excavations at Jericho (1952\u201358). The Wheeler\u2013Kenyon system involves digging within a series of squares that can vary in size set within a larger grid. This leaves a freestanding wall of earth\u2014known as a \"balk\"\u2014that can range from 50\u00a0cm for temporary grids, and measure up to 2 metres in width for a deeper square. The normal width of a permanent balk is 1 metre on each side of a unit.  These vertical slices of earth allow archaeologists to compare the exact provenance of a found object or feature to adjacent layers of earth (\"strata\"). During Kenyon's excavations at Jericho, this technique helped discern the long and complicated occupational history of the site. It was believed that this approach allowed more precise stratigraphic observations than earlier \"horizontal exposure\" techniques that relied on architectural and ceramic analysis.
