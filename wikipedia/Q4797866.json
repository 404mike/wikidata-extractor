Immediately after the war, the signing of former England international forward George Holley for a club record \u00a3200 fee was viewed as quite a coup. Holley suffered a career-ending injury, so hardly played, but Webb replaced him with Jack Doran who finished as the club's top scorer despite joining halfway through the season.Carder & Harris, Seagulls!, pp. 68\u201370. He brought Tommy Cook through from the juniors into the first team; Cook was top scorer in three seasons, but when he left the club to concentrate on his cricket career, Webb brought in the Queens Park Rangers reserve Hugh Vallance, who turned out to be a \"goalscoring phenomenon\" alongside Dan Kirkwood.Carder & Harris, Seagulls!, p. 91. Again, when twice top scorer Arthur Attwood succumbed to appendicitis in 1933, Webb signed former Norwich City centre-forward Oliver \"Buster\" Brown who had failed to break into the first team at West Ham United; with regular football at Albion, Brown produced 41 goals in his first two seasons.Carder & Harris, Seagulls!, p. 102."]}, {"page": "List of Brighton & Hove Albion F.C. players", "response": ["Of the nearly 200 men who made 100 or more appearances in first-team competition for Brighton & Hove Albion, Tug Wilson has 75 more appearances than the next contender. He came into the team in 1922, and over the next 12 seasons averaged around 44 competitive matches a season, taking his total to 566 by the time he retired in 1936. Tommy Cook tops the club's all-time scorers list, with 123 goals from 209 peacetime matches. Kit Napier's 99 remained a post-Second World War record for nearly 50 years, until Glenn Murray scored his 100th Albion goal in October 2018. Arthur Attwood's club record of 35 goals scored in a single season stood for 45 years, until Peter Ward went one better in 1976\u201377 to set a mark that still stands. Eric Gill set the club record for consecutive appearances with 247 in the mid-1950s."]}]}}
