Virgin Films had contracted the band to provide a soundtrack for Michael Radford's modern film adaptation of George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four.

Nevertheless, the record was presented as \"music derived from the original score of Eurythmics for the Michael Radford film version of Orwell's 1984\". Eurythmics charged that they had been misled by the film's producers as well, and the album was withdrawn from the market for a period while matters were litigated.
