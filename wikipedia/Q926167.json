His research interests were in quantum field theory, especially the interface between high-energy particle physics and cosmology. He is best known as one of the first to describe the Higgs mechanism, and for his research on topological defects. From the 1950s he was concerned about the nuclear arms race and from 1970 took leading roles in promoting the social responsibility of the scientist.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "History of physics", "response": ["Peter Higgs was one of six physicists, working in three independent groups, who, in 1964, invented the notion of the Higgs field (\"cosmic molasses\").

According to one of the nominees for the prize in physics, the three person limit deprived him and two other members of his team of the honor in 2013: the team of Carl Hagen, Gerald Guralnik, and Tom Kibble published a paper in 1964 that gave answers to how the cosmos began, but did not share the 2013 Physics Prize awarded to Peter Higgs and Fran\u00e7ois Englert, who had also published papers in 1964 concerning the subject.

It is expected that at least one string per Hubble volume is formed. Their existence was first contemplated by the theoretical physicist Tom Kibble in the 1970s.", "During the early days of string theory both string theorists and cosmic string theorists believed that there was no direct connection between superstrings and cosmic strings (the names were chosen independently by analogy with ordinary string). The possibility of cosmic strings being produced in the early universe was first envisioned by quantum field theorist Tom Kibble in 1976, and this sprouted the first flurry of interest in the field. In 1985, during the first superstring revolution, Edward Witten contemplated on the possibility of fundamental superstrings having been produced in the early universe and stretched to macroscopic scales, in which case (following the nomenclature of Tom Kibble) they would then be referred to as cosmic superstrings. He concluded that had they been produced they would have either disintegrated into smaller strings before ever reaching macroscopic scales (in the case of Type I superstring theory), they would always appear as boundaries of domain walls whose tension would force the strings to collapse rather than grow to cosmic scales (in the context of heterotic superstring theory), or having a characteristic energy scale close to the Planck energy they would be produced before cosmological inflation and hence be diluted away with the expansion of the universe and not be observable.", "In 2002, Henry Tye and collaborators predicted the production of cosmic superstrings during the last stages of brane inflation, a string theory construction of the early universe that gives leads to an expanding universe and cosmological inflation. It was subsequently realized by string theorist Joseph Polchinski that the expanding Universe could have stretched a \"fundamental\" string (the sort which superstring theory considers) until it was of intergalactic size.  Such a stretched string would exhibit many of the properties of the old \"cosmic\" string variety, making the older calculations useful again.  As theorist Tom Kibble remarks, \"string theory cosmologists have discovered cosmic strings lurking everywhere in the undergrowth\".  Older proposals for detecting cosmic strings could now be used to investigate superstring theory."]}, {"page": "Hughes Medal", "response": ["The medal has on occasion been awarded to multiple people at a time; in 1938 it was won by John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton \"for their discovery that nuclei could be disintegrated by artificially produced bombarding particles\", in 1981 by Peter Higgs and Tom Kibble \"for their international contributions about the spontaneous breaking of fundamental symmetries in elementary-particle theory\", in 1982 by Drummond Matthews and Frederick Vine \"for their elucidation of the magnetic properties of the ocean floors which subsequently led to the plate tectonic hypothesis\" and in 1988 by Archibald Howie and M.

The Goldstone and Higgs idea for generating mass in gauge theories was sparked in the late 1950s and early 1960s when a number of theoreticians (including Yoichiro Nambu, Steven Weinberg, Jeffrey Goldstone, Fran\u00e7ois Englert, Robert Brout, G. S. Guralnik, C. R.
