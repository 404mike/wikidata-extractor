This suggests a date of between AD\u00a0800 and AD\u00a0900. The traditional interpretation of the battle scene was that it shows a victory by Malcolm II (M\u00e1el Coluim mac Cin\u00e1eda) (reigned 1005\u20131034) against Danes or Norse led by one Sueno. This appears in Alexander Gordon's Itinerarium Septentrionale of 1726 and is thought to have been ancient then, derived from folklore and the more learned histories of John of Fordun, Hector Boece and George Buchanan.
