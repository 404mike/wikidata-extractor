During her time at the soap Hutchison axed multiple characters, and reportedly ordered the rewriting of numerous scripts. Newspapers reported on employee dissatisfaction with Hutchison's tenure at EastEnders. In January 2005, Hutchison left the soap and John Yorke (who by this time, was the BBC Controller of Continuing Drama Series) took total control of the show himself and became acting Executive Producer for a short period, before appointing Kate Harwood to the role. Harwood stayed at EastEnders for 20 months before being promoted by the BBC.

Talking to the Daily Mirror shortly after appearing on-screen for the first time in April, Oberman declared, \"Chrissie is the sort of woman I'd really like to be friends with... She's an Essex girl who was brought up in a family of brothers, so she knows how to work men.

But if you cross her, she'll get her own back in the end.\" Her strong-willed persona has led reviewers to label the character as \"venomous\", \"devious\", and \"hard as nails\" in \"the grand tradition of landladies of the Queen Vic\", manipulating others to ensure matters go her way. As the \"scheming\" figure of the show, she was described as a \"witch\" and \"super-bitch\", but was also represented as \"strong\" and \"clever\" woman.
