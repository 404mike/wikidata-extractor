Up to that point, live news broadcasts had been in audio with the announcer/newsreader speaking over a still picture of the Big Ben clock. Once a day the Television Newsreel was shown, essentially a televised version of a cinema newsreel and intrinsically not fully up-to-date. In order to avoid what he described as the \"cult of personality\", Hole continued the audio-only tradition of broadcast news, making only a slight concession to the demands of television. Thus was born the News and Newsreel on 5 July 1954. This lasted about 20 minutes, the first ten being current news reports read out over captions, still pictures and occasionally a live human hand pointing to locations on a map; the remainder was filmed footage in the manner of Television Newsreel. The Spectator described this effort as a \"lamentably non-telegenic presentation of television news... at once singularly clumsy and unrealistic.\" Hole's austere approach was challenged by the imminent arrival of the competing ITN service in 1955 and it was three weeks before ITN's launch on 22 September of that year that newsreaders Richard Baker, Kenneth Kendall and Robert Dougall appeared in vision.
