He was educated at Clifton College where he was awarded his cap (for rugby) and was captain of the XI in 1882. Evershed made his first-class debut for Derbyshire in an innings victory against Sussex in July 1882, when he scored 19 runs in Derbyshire's innings. He made one further appearance during the 1882 season, in a defeat by Yorkshire.\nEvershed made eight appearances in the 1883 season, playing in all Derbyshire's County matches and twice against Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). He scored each of his three half-century innings during this season, including his career highest score of 92, achieved against Surrey. In this match, he and team-mate Edmund Maynard put on over fifty percent of the innings total, in separate batting partnerships. He ended the season with the most runs scored for the club. In the 1884 season, he only played one match for the club against Sussex, which was his last.\nEvershed was a right-handed batsman and played 24 innings in 13 first-class matches with an average of 14.87 and a top score of 92. He was a right-arm medium-pace bowler and in 27 balls took three wickets for eight runs.\nEvershed died in Kendal two days short of his 48th birthday. His brothers, Edward, Sydney, Frank, and cousin Geoffrey Bell were all first-class cricketers, while William Evershed also played first-class cricket in first half of the 19th century.", "link_mentions": {}}}
