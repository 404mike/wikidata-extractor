The knot is described in relation to the clove hitch, which he illustrated and called the \"builder's knot\". He wrote, \"The Gunner's knot (of which we do not give a diagram) only differs from the builder's knot, by the ends of the cords being simply knotted before being brought from under the loop which crosses them.\", But Bowling is simply an extraction & translation of the knotting work contained in the huge French Traite de L'Art  de la Charpenterie, ca. 1840, which says \"Le noeud de bombardier, que nous n'avons point figure', ne differe du noeud d'artificier qu'en ce que le outs du cordage sont croise's en noeud simple, avant de sortir de dessous la ganse qui les croise, fig.46.\"  When J. T. Burgess copied from Bowling, he changed this text to merely state \"when the ends are knotted, the builder's knot becomes the gunner's Knot.\"Joseph Tom Burgess, Knots, Ties, and Splices (London: George Routledge & Sons, 1884),  viii, 101.  Although a clove hitch with knotted ends is a workable binding knot, Burgess was not actually describing the constrictor knot. In 1917, A. Hyatt Verrill illustrated Burgess's clove hitch variation in Knots, Splices and Rope Work.A. Hyatt Verrill, Knots, Splices and Rope Work, Third Revised Edition (New York: Norman W.
