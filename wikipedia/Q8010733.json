It was particularity known for its involvement in Battle of Porto Praya, in April 1781  as part of the Anglo-French Wars (1778\u20131783). Later that same year, the squadron was ordered to capture the Dutch Colony of the Cape of Good Hope, eventually known as the Battle of Saldanha Bay, however, it failed to re-take the cape. Because of this, the squadron was disbanded in 1782 when Commodore Johnstone sought election as an MP. The Station was re-established in 1795 under the command of Vice-Admiral Sir George Vandeput to undertake convoy duties between England the Mediterranean and Lisbon. In 1808, Admiral Vandeput was succeeded by Vice-Admiral Sir Charles Cotton who was charged with preparation of Lisbon harbor for the planned invasion the Iberian Peninsula later in the year. The fleet was also involved with the evacuation of Sir John Moore's army stuck in Galicia following the Battle of Corunna. In 1810, Admiral Cotton was relieved  of command by Admiral Sir George Cranfield Berkeley when it was next involved in improving coastal defences until 1812, when Admiral Berkeley retired his command. He was then replaced by Vice-Admiral Sir George Martin who commanded the station until 1814. He was followed by Rear-Admiral Sir George H. Parker from 1815 until 1834. In early 1837, the station was under the temporary command of Rear-Admiral John Ommanney, until he was relieved as commander in chief by Vice-Admiral Sir William Hall Gage.
