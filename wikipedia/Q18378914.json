He is particularly known for his contributions to Dungeons and Dragons, Fighting Fantasy, Warhammer, and Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game which was based on the Star Wars films.

He also liked the number of adventures included in the 192-page rulebook: \"The fourth edition contains enough adventures to keep any group happily entertained and sanity blasted.\" However, while Cook questioned whether owners of the 2nd or 3rd edition would get good value for their money \u2014 \"You lack only the car-chase rules and the improved layout of the three books in one. The rest of the material has received minor editing but no substantial changes\" \u2014 Cook strongly recommended the new edition to newcomers, saying, \"If you don\u2019t already play CoC, all I can do is urge you to give it a try.... discover for yourself why it has made so many converts since its release.\""]}, {"page": "Star Frontiers", "response": ["Jim Bambra reviewed Star Frontiers for Imagine magazine, and said that \"In summary, the Starfrontiers game is an excellent introduction to Sci Fi gaming, a game I heartily recommend to beginners and experienced gamers.

According to game designer Jim Bambra, \"The second edition was much larger than the first and addressed itself to making the World of Greyhawk setting a more detailed and vibrant place.\" This edition quadrupled the number of pages from the original edition to 128, adding significantly greater detail. One major addition was a pantheon of deities: in addition to the nineteen deities outlined by Gygax in his Dragon article, another thirty-one new deities were added, though only three received full write-ups of their abilities and worshipers. This brought the number of Greyhawk deities to an even fifty. For the next eight years, Greyhawk would be primarily defined by the information in this publication."]}, {"page": "Mystara", "response": ["|GAZ12|| The Golden Khan of Ethengar ||Jim Bambra||1989||\u00a0", "|PC3|| The Sea People ||Jim Bambra||1990||\u00a0"]}, {"page": "Cyberpunk (role-playing game)", "response": ["In the September 1989 edition of Dragon (Issue 149), Jim Bambra liked the production values of the original edition, but found many typos in the various books as well as a missing encounter table.

The development and presentation of the Net is stunning and can be used as a basis for countless numbers of adventures. No other game has succeeded in portraying computer hacking in such a vibrant and absorbing way.\" He concluded that this was not for everyone: \"Gamers brought up on heroic-fantasy or shiny science-fiction games may find the gritty realism of the Cyberpunk game not to their liking...

It soon found a following among gamers looking for something different in their role-playing adventures. Still, a close inspection of the combat system revealed that it was slow moving and cumbersome. The mechanics were hard to grasp in places, making it difficult to get into the freewheeling fun. Now, all that\u2019s changed. The Paranoia game has been treated to a revamp, and this time the rules are slick. All that tricky stuff which made the combat system such a pain to run has been shelved off into optional rules. If you want the extra complications, you\u2019re welcome to them, or you can do what most people did anyway and simply ignore them.\" Bambra did express reservations about the suitability of the game for an on-going campaign, saying \"It doesn't lend itself easily to long-term campaign play. This game is best treated as a succession of short adventure sessions in which players get to enjoy themselves doing all those despicable things that would spoil a more 'serious\u2019 game.\"  However Bambra concluded with a recommendation, saying \"As a tongue-in-cheek science-fiction game, this one is hard to beat.\""]}, {"page": "BattleTech", "response": ["In the March 1988 edition of Dragon (Issue 131), Jim Bambra called the first edition BattleTech tabletop game \"a brilliantly conceived and presented game of robotic combat set in the war-torn universe of the Successor States\", and complimented the high production values of the game components.

Having slogged through the rules, he found much to recommend the game, including the character generation system, the skill system, and combat \u2014 although he found combat slow compared to the skill system. Bambra felt the starship combat system was \"not as good as it could have been... Space combat does not flow very well and is potentially very fiddly once the missiles are flying.\" Bambra also noted the lack of scenarios, saying, \"There is very little information about adventures\", pointing out that even in the provided adventure, \"vast chunks are left for the GM to develop \u2014 a daunting task for most.\" Bambra concluded, \"I would prefer simpler mecahnics and a more exciting background.\"", "A year later, in the May 1989 edition of Dragon (Issue 145), Jim Bambra had a chance to revisit the game with the publication of the updated 2300 AD, successor to Traveller 2300. Bambra found much to like in the new version of the game, including the upgrade from 96 pages of rules and background in the original setting to 208 pages in the revised setting. Bambra found the new rules for 2300 AD were better organized and had a much more professional layout than the previous version. He also found the sections demonstrating the game to new gamemasters to be very helpful. Bambra concluded with a positive recommendation: \"The 2300 AD game is a greatly welcomed development. With its new and improved presentation, revised and expanded rules and background, more dynamic feel, and extensive range of support products, the 2300 AD game can truly be called a state-of-the-art science-fiction role-playing game. I recommend it highly to anyone looking for a game of hard science-fiction that pulls no punches and delivers the goods in a highly satisfying manner. In bringing out the 2300 AD game, GDW has come up trumps and made a good game into a great one.\""]}, {"page": "Torg", "response": ["In the February 1991 edition of Dragon (Issue 166), Jim Bambra liked the multi-genre aspect of the game, in which players could be immersed in a medieval fantasy London one session and in a cyberpunk Paris the next. He also liked the quick resolution for skill checks and combat; although it did require some table checking, it was fast and adaptable. He noted that magic and healing were \"neatly handled and fit into the system with a minimum of fuss.\" Bambra criticized the varying quality of the rules, saying, \"some places are very clear, but re-readings are needed to grasp to what is being said in other areas.\" He also found the quality of artwork varied greatly.

He felt that the presentation of the North was less successful than that of Waterdeep, writing that while \"the history of the North is colorful, the descriptions of the various settlements are sketchy\", and cited the absence of a wilderness map showing the relationship of the various settlements to Waterdeep and to each other.

The laws and customs of the city are colorfully presented, as are the various guilds and factions of the city.\" He commented on how few of the city's buildings are detailed, which leaves that work up to the DM with the help of included tables and sample floor plans, and that the book instead provides \"a useful look at the workings of the city, outline descriptions of its various wards, and details on the services available\". He wrote that the adventure outlines provided \"require a bit of work to bring them to life, but they provide a good cross section of the types of adventure available within the city\". Bambra concluded by saying: \"With its emphasis on atmosphere and personalities, Waterdeep is a very strong city pack. It lacks any street encounter tables, which is a pity, as this would have added even more to the city's feel and given PCs a better handle on life in the city.

A reviewer for White Dwarf called the long background section of Kara-Tur in the book, a \"bonus\". Originally intended as a western part of the continent of Oerik in the Greyhawk setting, the description of Kara-Tur in the Oriental Adventures rulebook made no attempt to link it with another D&D game-world.  The first map of Kara-Tur appeared in the adventure module OA1: Swords of the Daimyo (1986), where the setting was still world-neutral.

Two spells were also added, which had been absent from the original modules.
