Initial work included rearranging and displaying the museum's collection of medieval pilgrims' badges. Soon, however, he was introduced to what would be later termed rescue archaeology, when a group of seventeenth-century houses gave way to a large extension to the Bodleian Library. Before the demolition, Bodley's Librarian invited the Oxfordshire Architectural and Historical Society \"to investigate and record any features of architectural or antiquarian interest which are contained in the block of houses ... and also to watch for any finds that may tum up during the demolition of these houses and the subsequent excavations for the foundations of the new building\". The Society, in turn, created a subcommittee consisting of E. T. Long, Edward Thurlow Leeds, and William Abel Pantin, the latter of whom wrote an article on the houses and commented on the \"practical consideration or morals to be drawn\" from their destruction."]}, {"page": "Pantin (surname)", "response": ["*William Abel Pantin (1902\u20131973), English historian"]}, {"page": "J.

In 1930 he won a history scholarship for Manchester University. Here he was influenced by William Abel Pantin and E.\u00a0F. Jacob, who helped Roskell gravitate towards medieval history. Roskell was taught a neo-Stubbsian method that sought to use administrative and biographical research in studying constitutional history."]}]}}
