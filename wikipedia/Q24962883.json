The Court of Appeal reduced the conviction to manslaughter, and she was released immediately. The success of the appeal was significant because it supported the argument that courts should take long-term issues such as \"battered woman syndrome\" into account when considering a defence of provocation.

National Review staff writer Madeleine Kearns called her videos a \"great source of inspiration and clarity for those trying to resist gender extremism\". Writing in The Velvet Chronicle, Julia Diana Robertson eulogised Berns as a \"rare force of nature\", suggesting that \"while many may never know the impact she made, the ripple effect will be felt for many years to come\". Journalist Meghan Murphy stated that Berns had contributed to \"igniting public conversation around sex, gender, and sexuality\". In Der Freitag, Berns was noted as a \"person who pits logical thinking, scientific definitions and dictionaries against ideological zeal and perceived reality\", whose videos \"will continue to help people navigate gender, feminism, and identity politics, inspire and hopefully lessen the confusion.\" Irish comedy writer Graham Linehan voiced vocal support for Berns on Twitter and other platforms. Berns's death was noted by two Members of the Scottish Parliament: Joan McAlpine MSP described her as a \"clever and uncompromising\" young woman, while Ruth Maguire MSP described her as a \"courageous young feminist, who inspired others\". The Communist Party of Great Britain (Marxist\u2013Leninist) stated that Berns \"gained a large online following for her own forthright brand of radical feminism\". In October 2019, Berns was posthumously shortlisted for the Emma Humphreys Memorial Prize, which the organisation awards to women it deems to have \"raised awareness of violence against women and children\"; in November 2019, she received a special award from the organisation."]}, {"page": "Karen Ingala Smith", "response": ["Smith is a trustee of the Emma Humphreys Memorial Prize and was awarded the Positive Role Model for Gender at the 2014 National Diversity Awards."]}]}}
