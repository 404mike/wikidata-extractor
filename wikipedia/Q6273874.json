The family lived in an \"unbelievably cramped\" terraced, thatched cottage in the East Harnham area of the city and Meades was educated until the age of 13 at the nearby Salisbury Cathedral School, within Salisbury Cathedral Close.Meades, Jonathan (2014). An Encyclopaedia of Myself, p. 91. Fourth Estate, London. .", "Although he ultimately decided against joining the acting profession, the training which he received would prove essential in his later television career, as would his extra-curricular interest in French New Wave cinema, in particular the work of Jean-Pierre Melville and Alain Robbe-Grillet. His regular Sunday pastime of exploring the capital with his Pevsner Architectural Guide would also benefit him later. On leaving RADA, he was told by the Principal, Hugh Cruttwell, that he might as well abandon acting until he reached middle age, at which point he might become an interesting character actor. When the two met again decades later, after Meades had established himself on television, Cruttwell joked that he hadn't realised that the character would be called \"Jonathan Meades\".", "An anthology of uncollected writing from 1988-2020 entitled Pedro and Ricky Come Again, described as \"the best of three decades of Jonathan Meades\" and the sequel to Peter Knows What Dick Likes, was published by Unbound in March 2021.", "His next series was Abroad in Britain, broadcast on BBC Two in 1990. It featured five irreverent, \"slightly bonkers\" films which explored unusual and neglected aspects of the built environment: informal plotland dwellings along the Severn Valley, nautical culture around the Solent and architectural forms associated with utopianism, bohemians and the military. Each episode was introduced by Meades as being \"devoted to the proposition that the exotic begins at home.\" The series was influenced by the work of architectural critic Ian Nairn and French New Wave film director Alain Robbe-Grillet, and it cemented Meades' uniquely incongruous on-screen persona: dark glasses, dark suits, inscrutable, didactic delivery and dense, mordant language peppered with gags and surreal interludes. Rachel Cooke of The Guardian later described his TV persona as \"pugnacious, sardonic and seemingly super-confident\", while noting the RADA training and that it was \"not the real Jonathan Meades, who is an altogether more diffident and shy character [...] except when drunk\". The series spawned four sequels: Further Abroad (1994), Even Further Abroad (1997), Abroad Again in Britain (2005) and  Abroad Again (2007), along with several other series and stand-alone films, the majority of which have been archived on the website MeadesShrine.", "The 2008 two-part BBC Four film Jonathan Meades: Magnetic North celebrated the culture of Northern Europe, examining why the North suffers in the British popular imagination in comparison with the South. Meades travelled from the slag heaps of northern France to Belgian cities, the red-light district of Hamburg, Gda\u0144sk, the Baltic States and finally Helsinki, musing on the architecture, food and art of the places he visited. Writing in The Daily Telegraph, James Walton praised the programme as \"Sparkling, thought-provoking, constantly challenging the accepted view, Meades seemed at times inspired, at others deranged. The only thing he never was, thank heaven, was obvious.\"", "In 2009, Meades toured Scotland in a three-part BBC Four series entitled Jonathan Meades: Off Kilter. He visited Aberdeen, Lewis and Harris (the 'Isle of Rust') and the less-renowned footballing towns of south-west Fife, Clackmannanshire and Falkirk, guided by his foul-mouthed 'ScotNav'.", "In 2012, BBC Four screened Jonathan Meades on France, a series in which he explored his \"second country\". The first episode, Fragments of an Arbitrary Encyclopaedia, focused on the Lorraine region, using a miscellany of words beginning with the letter V. The second episode, A Biased Anthology of Parisian Peripheries, focused on Frenchness and its major traits. The series concluded with Just a Few Debts France Owes to America.", "Jonathan Meades on Jargon aired on BBC Four in May 2018. The BBC Four website described it as a \"provocative television essay\" which \"dissects politics, the law, football commentary, business, the arts, tabloid-speak and management consultancy to show how jargon is used to cover up, confuse and generally keep us in the dark.\" The Guardian described it as \"blisteringly brutal, clever and hilarious,\" while The Times also declared Meades to be \"on blistering form.\"", "Over a period of 25 years, Meades has written and presented four films on the architectural legacy of 20th-century European dictators, the latest of which, Franco Building with Jonathan Meades, looking at Franco's Spain, aired in August 2019.

In the 56th minute, a shot from Andy Barcham was blocked before Tom Elliott headed over the bar from a Taylor cross.  Gregg Wylde became the first player to be booked after being shown the yellow card for a foul on Wimbledon's Barry Fuller in the 63rd minute.  Two minutes later, Carey's curling free kick from around  was saved by Roos, then Darius Charles was booked for a foul on Matt.  On 68 minutes, Plymouth made their first substitution of the afternoon with Jervis being replaced by Craig Tanner.  Soon after, Jonathan Meades came on to replace Connor Smith for Wimbledon.  In the 77th minute, Elliott left the pitch to be replaced by Akinfenwa whose first action a minute later was to help win a corner for Wimbledon, from which Taylor scored with a low shot past McCormick.  The Plymouth goalkeeper made another save four minutes later before Reid came on to replace Wylde in the 83rd minute.  Hartley was then injured in a clash with Akinfenwa and was stretchered off the pitch, and replaced by Jordon Forster.

Tanner was brought down in the 95th minute but the referee ignored appeals for a penalty from Plymouth before Taylor's weak shot after a one-on-one with McCormick was easily saved by the goalkeeper.
