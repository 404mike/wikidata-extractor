Guys who played with Scottish clubs got caps that I was better than. I sit here and I'm bloody proud of those 12 caps I won. I'm especially proud and will be forever proud of the three or four I played with my brother. I can't ever really get across what that feels like, what that means for me, for him, for the two of us. It's one of my greatest achievements in football. I got two late Scotland caps when I was playing for Wigan and I'm really, really proud of those. I felt like it was the start of this era that we're in now. We had these young guys coming through \u2013 Steven Naismith, James Morrison, James McArthur. Kenny Miller was captain in that last game [against Northern Ireland in Dublin in 2011] and as he went off, he gave me the armband. It was another honour.
