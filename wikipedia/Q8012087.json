It was extended and remodelled in 1858 by the Irish architect William Henry Lynn. There was rivalry between Lord Rossmore and the Shirleys of Lough Fea, and they competed for many years as to who could boast the largest room in County Monaghan; as a result, the drawing room at Rossmore was extended on five occasions, and the house ended up with three towers, and more than 117 windows in at least 53 assorted sizes and shapes. In latter part of the century was known for its social gatherings and gaiety, with Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, being a friend of The 5th Baron Rossmore. The 5th Baron was Lord Lieutenant of Monaghan from 1897 until his death in 1921, when he was succeeded by his son William, who became The 6th Baron Rossmore. After the Second World War, dry rot forced the abandonment of the castle; the family moved to Camla Vale, a more modest Georgian house situated within the estate grounds, and the castle fell into ruins; it was demolished in 1975.
