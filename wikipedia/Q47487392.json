Later in the year, the British Bobsleigh and Skeleton Association withdrew funding for McNeill and Moore, after deciding to maintain funding only for the British male bobsleigh teams. The pair then managed to crowdfund \u00a330,000, allowing them to compete in the 2017\u201318 Bobsleigh World Cup events. The money was needed to pay for travel between races for the pair of them, transport of the sled, race fees, insurance and possible medical expenses, among other things, and allowed them to concentrate on trying to win races. By January 2018, McNeill and Moore had raised over \u00a341,000 to fund their competitions. The pair have the slogan \"Powered By The People\" written on their sled. McNeill and Moore finished fifth in the 2-women bobsleigh event in Whistler, Canada, which was the best result for a British women's team in the Bobsleigh World Cup for 8 years. In January 2018, McNeill was selected as the pilot for the British 2-women bobsleigh team at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang. Moore was selected as the brakewoman for the team.  Their result of 8th was the best ever by a British women's Olympic bobsleigh team."]}]}}
