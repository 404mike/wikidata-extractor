Five days later the Vale beat Manchester United 1\u20130, and their season got going \u2013 albeit very slowly. Four games later they found their second victory \u2013 against new boys Bradford City, however by October they had racked up just five points from their opening eight games. A seven-game unbeaten run saw them surge up the table towards the end of 1903. This run ended at Gainsborough Trinity, but could be justified by the fact that they had played three games in four days. They went on to muster just one point from seven games to find themselves back in the danger zone as players looked towards their promising cup run rather than the league itself. An inconsistent end to the season followed, though picking up points from eight of their last twelve games was enough to ensure safety. On the final game of the season 20,000 Woolwich Arsenal fans turned up to watch their team claim the championship, however the \"Valeites\" hung on for a draw, with Harry Cotton in remarkable form, and a goalless draw was enough to hand the league title to Preston North End. Port Vale were one of only two teams to take a point home from London that season. This was even more surprising considering that Vale went the whole season without recording an away win, and had to rely entirely on their home form to stay in the league. They finished two points ahead of the re-election zones, and were twenty points shy of promotion.", "Adrian Capes was top scorer for the fourth consecutive season with seventeen goals, fourteen of them coming in the league.
