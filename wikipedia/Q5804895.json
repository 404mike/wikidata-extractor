The Phantom XII and Mark XII both featured a unique Bigsby style 12-string vibrato tailpiece, which made them, along with Semie Moseley's \"Ventures\" model 12-string Mosrite, the only 12 string electric guitars to feature such a vibrato.

In 1965, inspired by Harrison, Roger McGuinn made the Rickenbacker 12-string central to The Byrds' folk rock sound, further popularising the instrument. By the mid-1960s, most major guitar manufacturers were producing competing instruments, including the Fender Electric XII (used by Roy Wood of The Move), and the Vox Phantom XII (used by Tony Hicks of The Hollies).

For the audition, they brought in Tony Hicks to replace the departing Steele. Hicks played in a Nelson band called the Dolphins, which also featured Bobby Elliott on drums and Bernie Calvert on bass. Not only were the Hollies signed by Richards, who continued to produce the band until 1976 and once more in 1979, but a song from the audition, a cover of the Coasters' 1961 single \"(Ain't That) Just Like Me\", was released as their debut single in May 1963 and hit No. 25 on the UK Singles Chart.", "The Hollies' next single, \"I Can't Tell the Bottom from the Top\", again featured the young Elton John on piano and reached UK No. 7 in May 1970, charting in twelve countries.
