The first records in Latin the gift of the manuscript \"to God on the altar of St Teilo\" by a man named Gelhi, who had bought the manuscript for the price of his best horse from Cingal.  In her treatment of the Book of Kells, Fran\u00e7oise Henry reported Lichfield's provenance in similar terms: \"The Book of Lichfield was exchanged for a horse in the late eighth century and given to the sanctuary of S. Tellio at Llandaff where it remained until the tenth century, when it was transferred to the Cathedral of Lichfield.\"  The \"altar of St. Teilo\" has in the past been associated with the monastery at Llandaff but, as it has been determined that the third, fourth and sixth marginal inscriptions refer to lands within fifteen miles of Llandeilo Fawr, it is now thought that the book spent time there. The second such inscription contains a unique example of early Welsh prose recording the details of the resolution of a land dispute. These two inscriptions have been dated to the mid 9th century. The marginalia were edited by John Gwenogvryn Evans with John Rhys in their 1893 edition of the Book of Llandaff."]}, {"page": "John Evans", "response": ["* John Gwenogvryn Evans (1852\u20131930), Welsh minister and paleographer"]}, {"page": "Ernest Rhys", "response": ["* with John Gwenogvryn Evans, The Text of the Bruts from the Red Book of Hergest (1890) editors"]}, {"page": "Black Book of Carmarthen", "response": ["* Pennar, Meirion.
