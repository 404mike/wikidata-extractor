This proved a headache for the selectors who had already shuffled the previous year's crews considerably, in the wake of Matthew Pinsent and James Cracknell's disappointing 4th place in the pair in Milan. Until the trials Pinsent and Cracknell had been training in a four with Steve Williams and Josh West, but following the unexpected trials result replaced West with Partridge. Hodge remained in the Eight. However, following the World Cup in Lucerne, Partridge was diagnosed with a collapsed lung and had to withdraw from the Athens Olympics; he was replaced in the coxless four by Ed Coode, and the crew went on to win the Olympic final beating the Canadian 4- by just 0.08 seconds. Patridge, however, was first across the line; the crew had named their boat after him."]}]}}
