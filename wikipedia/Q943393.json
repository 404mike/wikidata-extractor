Departing in 1893, Fram drifted from the New Siberian Islands for one and a half years before Nansen became impatient and set out to reach the North Pole on skis with Hjalmar Johansen. Eventually, they gave up on reaching the pole and instead found their way to Franz Josef Land, the nearest land known to man. They were thus able to establish that there was no large landmass north of this archipelago.Barr (1995): 72 In the meantime the Jackson\u2013Harmsworth Expedition set off in 1894, set up a base on Bell Island, and stayed for the winter.
