They ended the season with 20 clean sheets \u2013 a club record for a 38-game season that\u2019s unlikely to be broken. In the end, Leeds scored just 28 goals.

Romania attacked after the break and were quickly rewarded; Dorinel Munteanu punishing a poor punch from Nigel Martyn, a late replacement for injured goalkeeper David Seaman, to equalize three minutes after the restart.
