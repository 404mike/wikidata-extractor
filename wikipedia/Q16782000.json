The British sinologist Demetrius Charles Boulger published a biography of Gordon in 1896 which depicted him as a staunch patriot and a Christian of immense virtue who displayed superhuman courage in the face of danger.Behrman, 1971 p. 51. By contrast, Gordon is one of the four subjects discussed critically in Eminent Victorians by Lytton Strachey, one of the first texts about Gordon that portrays some of his characteristics which Strachey regards as weaknesses. Notably, Strachey emphasises the claims of Charles Chaill\u00e9-Long that Gordon was an alcoholic, an accusation dismissed by later writers like Alan MooreheadMoorehead, 1960 p. 179. and Charles Chenevix Trench.Chenevix Trench, 1978 p. 95"]}, {"page": "Yellow Peril", "response": ["Despite that justifying historical background, Yellow Peril racism was not universally accepted in the societies of Europe. French intellectual Anatole France said that Yellow Peril ideology was to be expected from a racist man such as the Kaiser. Inverting the racist premise of Asian invasion, France showed that European imperialism in Asia and Africa indicated that the European White Peril was the true threat to the world. In his essay \"The Bogey of the Yellow Peril\" (1904), the British journalist Demetrius Charles Boulger said the Yellow Peril was racist hysteria for popular consumption. Asian geopolitical dominance of the world is \"the prospect, placed before the uninstructed reading public, is a revival of the Hun and Mongol terrors, and the names of Attila and Genghis are set out in the largest type to create feelings of apprehension. The reader is assured, in the most positive manner, that this is the doing of the enterprising nation of Japan\".Iikura, Akira. \"The Anglo\u2013Japanese Alliance and the Question of Race\", pp. 222\u201334, in The Anglo\u2013Japanese Alliance, 1902\u20131922, Philips O'Brian, Ed.

Throughout the successful imperial intrigues facilitated by Germany's Yellow Peril ideology, the Kaiser's true geopolitical target was Britain."]}, {"page": "Queue (hairstyle)", "response": ["British author Demetrius Charles Boulger in 1899 proposed that Britain form and head an alliance of \"Philo-Chinese Powers\" in setting up a new government for China based in Shanghai and Nanking as two capitals along the River Yangtze, to counter the interests of other powers in the region like the Russians due to what he believed was the imminent collapse of the Qing dynasty. The Yangtze valley was controlled by Qing officials such as Liu Kunyi and Zhang Zhidong, who were not under Beijing's influence and whom Boulger believed Britain could work with to stabilize China. He proposed that at Nanjing and Hankou a force of Chinese soldiers trained by the British be deployed and in Hong Kong, Weihaiwei and the Yangtze valley and it would have no allegiance to the Qing, and as such they in his idea would forgo the queue and be made to grow their hair long as a symbolic measure to \"increasing the confidence of the Chinese in the advent of a new era\". Boulger stated he could not discern from the Chinese he spoke to on whether the queue was invented by Nurhaci to impose on the Chinese as a symbol of loyalty or whether it was an already established Manchu custom as no one seemed to know the origin of it from his or other sinologists' inquiries."]}, {"page": "Boulger", "response": ["*Demetrius Charles Boulger (1853\u20131928), British author"]}, {"page": "D.
