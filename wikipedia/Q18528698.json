The Unknown Gertrude Jekyll.London: Frances Lincoln, 2006. Her writing was influenced by her friend Theresa Earle who had published her \"Pot-pourri\" books. In works like Colour Schemes for the Flower Garden (reprinted 1988) she put her imprint on modern uses of \"warm\" and \"cool\" flower colours in gardens. Her concern that plants should be displayed to best effect even when cut for the house, led her to design her own range of glass flower vases."]}, {"page": "Lady Constance Bulwer-Lytton", "response": ["In 1897 her aunt, Theresa Earle, published her gardening guide Pot-Pourri from a Surrey Garden. She had been encouraged to write this by Lytton who typed some of the text.

He wrote that he could:conscientiously recommend this book as admirably adapted to lead its readers to observe for themselves the varied phenomena presented by insects, and thus to become true entomologists.Horticulturist Theresa Earle also wrote favourably of her 1866 work British Spiders, describing it as: a very good book... which would tell all that anyone might want to know about these insects. The first page illustrates spiders' heads, with the varying numbers of eyes the different kinds possess.Eliza Fanny Staveley died in 1903 in Tunbridge Wells, aged 72."]}, {"page": "C. W.
