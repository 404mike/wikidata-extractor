Kerr then struck the opening goal of the game in the 4th-minute; Slaven started the movement as he collected a loose ball in the centre of the park and hit a through ball past Dave Miller and Lee Todd for Kerr to sprint on and slot home his fourteenth of the season. Van der Laan continued the Valiants spell of pressure, hitting a shot just wide of the goal not long after. In the 37th-minute Vale doubled their lead when Glover put in a cross, which Foyle turned into the path of Slaven, who burst past three defenders before he directed it to the left of the helpless Neil Edwards. Before the half-time whistle came, Jim Gannon earned the first yellow card of the game.", "|DF || || Dave Miller"]}, {"page": "Dave Miller (footballer born 1964)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Dave Miller (footballer, born 1964)"]}, {"page": "1994 Football League Second Division play-off Final", "response": ["|12||Dave Miller "]}]}}
