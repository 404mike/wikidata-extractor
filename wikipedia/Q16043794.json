Johnson said, \"I was an all-round gymnast, as I reckoned, a rope walker, and an equestrian. Barebacked I could do pretty well anything\". ", "Patrick Feeney, known as Mullaba, Malabar or Old Malabar, was the son of \"decent, working people\". He was born in Sligo, Ireland, on 16 March 1800, and was trained by the Chinese-Tartar juggler Chu Chan. Lord George Sanger recalled seeing \"American Malabar\" doing the Tuppence More trick with a donkey at the Hyde Park Fair of 1838. In 1910 the circus performer Edward Pablo recalled seeing Malabar in 1880, \"walking about the streets [of Glasgow] rigged up in his old Chinese dress\", although he did not remember Henry Johnson. Another report says that Malabar first performed in his own booth at the Border Fairs in Scotland around 1848, and continued at the fairs there, including at Selkirk and Edinburgh, until around 1878. Malabar was a \"big, strong man, with a huge voice ... He was a wyse-like man, with strong features\". He had once hired Lord George Sanger as a young man to patter (or attract trade) and to take part in the performance. Malabar was  tall; he was a \"tall, commanding figure, in gaudy robes\". His tricks included catching a ball in a cup attached to his forehead, and swallowing an  sword. However, Malabar did have issues with alcohol, according to Lord George Sanger, who was dropped on top of the crowd by a drunken Malabar on one occasion. In old age he was mocked for boasting that he had performed before kings, but Johnson's interviews confirm that he performed before William IV. His wife assisted him at his sideshows, and died around 1872. \"The last appearance of Malabar in public was on the occasion of the great procession at the laying of the foundation of the New Municipal Buildings in George's Square\", Glasgow, on 6 October 1883. Feeney died in Glasgow, on 13 November 1883."]}]}}
