These include Marcus Borg, Colin Gunton, Lincoln Hurst, David P. Moessner, John Muddiman, Allison Trites, Francis Watson, and N. T. Wright.see the various contributions to Hurst and Wright 1987, passim According to British Old Testament scholar James Barr, Caird was sometimes \"practically adored\" by students.Barr 1985, p.\u00a0521", "Caird's overall conception of New Testament thought is seen in his synthetic New Testament Theology, which for him involved presiding over \"an apostolic conference on faith and order\" (cf. Acts, Gal 2). Here he attempted to allow the New Testament writers \"to speak for themselves\" on a wide variety of topics (predestination, sin, salvation, the life of the church, eschatology, christology). He avoided using any form of artificial force to press their viewpoints into the arbitrary strictures of a system. The consequent unison of Caird's New Testament conference was therefore similar to that of a choir, sung not in complete harmony but with proper counter-melodies.Caird 1994, pp.\u00a01\u201326; Hurst, 1998, p.\u00a0459 Yet another integral feature of New Testament Theology was his inclusion as the final chapter of a discussion of the theology of Jesus. For him this was \"the starting point and goal of New Testament theology\".Caird 1994, pp.\u00a025\u201326, 346 Although New Testament Theology was published posthumously, Caird's effort had a visible and immediate impact on both sides of the Atlantic. According to Bruce Metzger of Princeton Theological Seminary, it was \"vintage Caird\" - \"a weighty volume whose pages instruct as well as stimulate\".Metzger 1995, pp.\u00a0368 John Muddiman, G. B. Caird Fellow in New Testament Theology at Mansfield College, Oxford, saw it as \"a tangible monument to the scholarly achievement of George Caird\".Muddiman 1994-1995, p.\u00a045 And, according to C. F. D. Moule of Cambridge, Caird's final work is \"a very important book,\" \"brilliant and provocative\"; it causes the New Testament \"to speak for itself by exact scrutiny and deft interrogation and with a sensitive awareness of the hazards of bridging the time-gap; and the results are fresh and radical\".Moule 1995, p.\u00a0245"]}, {"page": "The Journal of Theological Studies", "response": ["Previous editors have included the patristic scholars James Bethune-Baker (1904\u201335), Henry Chadwick (1954\u201385), and Maurice Wiles (1986\u201399), and the biblical scholars R.
