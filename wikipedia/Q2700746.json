Their greater range, ease of changing key, more fluent action, along with their strong musette tuning blended seamlessly with the other instruments and were highly valued during this period. They are a mainstay of the top Irish and Scottish ceilidh bands. Dermot O'Brien, Malachy Doris, Sean Quinn and Mick Foster are well known Irish solo masters of this instrument and were well recorded. The latest revival of traditional music from the late 1970s also revived the interest in this versatile instrument. Like the button key accordion, a new playing style has emerged with a dry tuning, lighter style of playing and a more rhythmically varied bass.  Notable players of this modern style include Karen Tweed (England) and Alan Kelly (Roscommon)."]}, {"page": "Albion: An Anthology", "response": ["*Karen Tweed\u00a0\u2013 arrangement"]}, {"page": "Methera", "response": ["Methera is an English string quartet which plays traditional music and compositions by the members of the group.
