He was favoured ahead of the ageing Jimmy O'Neill and the inexperienced David Ikin, and played 15 Fourth Division games at the end of the 1965\u201366 season. He played 49 of the club's 50 games in the 1966\u201367 campaign, beating off competition from young hopeful Billy McNulty. Sharrat was an ever-present during the 49 game 1967\u201368 season. In March 1968, manager Stanley Matthews arranged a \u00a315,000 transfer to Huddersfield Town, however Sharratt refused the move. However injury struck on 14 August 1968 as he cracked a kneecap in a 2\u20130 defeat at Wrexham in the first round of the League Cup, later contracting a virus in his blood. Upon his recovery he became a part-time player and barely got a game, though he did play instead of Keith Ball in 18 Third Division games in the 1970\u201371 season, and went on to feature 18 times in the 1971\u201372 season. His contract was terminated by manager Gordon Lee in May 1972 because he was unable to get release from his work as a college lecturer to play in a testimonial game. He appealed and the club were forced by the Football League to honour his contract to 30 June 1972."]}, {"page": "William George McNulty", "response": ["#REDIRECT Billy McNulty"]}, {"page": "William McNulty", "response": ["* Billy McNulty (born 1949), Scottish former football goalkeeper"]}, {"page": "1966\u201367 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|GK||align=\"left\"| Billy McNulty"]}, {"page": "1967\u201368 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["| May 1968 || GK ||  || Billy McNulty || Chesterfield || Free transfer || "]}]}}
