He was articled to Leadbetter and Fairley in Edinburgh and afterwards moved to Belcher and Joass in London where he was promoted to chief architectural assistant.\nHe joined the London and South Western Railway in 1907. He is noted as the chief architectural assistant in the period of the reconstruction of Waterloo Station between 1909 and 1923. The engineers J. W. Jacomb-Hood and Alfred Weeks Szlumper had designed the roof and platforms. Scott was responsible for the office range and the main entrance and war memorial to the fallen employees of the Railway known as the Victory Arch. Sometime early in the evolution of the Southern Railway he was appointed chief architect.\nHe died in 1965.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Scots", "response": ["* James Robb Scott (1882\u20131965), chief architect of the Southern Railway"]}, {"page": "Kingston upon Thames", "response": ["Nearby Surbiton station - originally named Kingston when it opened in 1838 - is on the South West Main Line in London fare zone 6.

A vehicular roadway to the station opened on 18 December 1911. The connection to Waterloo Junction was removed in March that year, but a siding remained until 3 May 1925. The bridge remained in place and was used as a walkway between the two stations. Construction of the main station continued sporadically throughout World War I, and the new station finally opened in 1922, with 21 platforms and a  long concourse. The roof and platforms were initially designed by J. W. Jacomb-Hood, who travelled to the US to look at station designs for inspiration. Following Jacomb-Hood's death in 1914, work was taken over by Alfred Weeks Szlumper. It was built in an Imperial Baroque style out of Portland stone. James Robb Scott designed the office range. The new station included a large stained glass window depicting the L&SWR's company crest over the main road entrance, surrounded by a frieze listing the counties served by the railway (the latter still survives today). These features were retained in the design, despite the fact that, by the time the station opened, the Railways Act 1921 had been passed, which spelt the end of the L&SWR as an independent concern.", "Category:James Robb Scott buildings"]}, {"page": "Richmond station (London)", "response": ["The station building, designed by James Robb Scott in Portland stone and dating from 1937, is in Art Deco style and its facade includes a square clock.

There was a goods yard beyond the passenger station.
