He is a right-handed batsman and a right-arm off-break bowler. Powell was born at Abergavenny in Monmouthshire. He became the third batsman for Glamorgan to score a century on debut in a first-class match.Having signed and played for Glamorgan since 1996, his first accolades as a player there include the Glamorgan Young Player of the Year award in 1997 and 1999. His first appearances at Glamorgan came courtesy of the Second XI Championship in May 1996, and in the 1996 Bain Hogg trophy two weeks later. He played moderately in his first season in the first team of 1997, before making a name for himself in the league in 1998. Participating mostly in Division Two prior to 2001, his team were promoted to Division One in 2002, having performed well at the end of the 2001 season, giving his team hope to progress further in the league.\nNext year, Glamorgan finished top of the points table in Division One, before failing in 2003. However his performances have remained steady since then, keeping his team in the top division until 2005, when the team dropped after winning one of 16 one-day game. Powell still scored above 1,000 runs, but was the team's second best run scorer after David Hemp. In 2006, Powell passed the 1,000-run mark after 11 games, scoring 299 against Essex but falling 10 runs short of Steve James' county record of 309. In 2007 after a successful operation to remove a rib Powell asked for, and was granted, permission to bury it beneath Sophia Gardens.After claiming to being held back at Glamorgan, Powell signed a two-year deal at Kent County Cricket Club, starting in 2012.\nHe retired from cricket after the 2013 season and took up a position with the Welsh risk consultancy firm Thomas Carroll PLC.Mike's uncle, Michael Powell, played cricket for Worcestershire Second XI in 1973 and Glamorgan Second XI in 1974 and 1975.", "link_mentions": {}}}
