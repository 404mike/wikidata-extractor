He is a right-handed batsman and a right-arm off-break bowler. Powell was born at Abergavenny in Monmouthshire. He became the third batsman for Glamorgan to score a century on debut in a first-class match.Having signed and played for Glamorgan since 1996, his first accolades as a player there include the Glamorgan Young Player of the Year award in 1997 and 1999. His first appearances at Glamorgan came courtesy of the Second XI Championship in May 1996, and in the 1996 Bain Hogg trophy two weeks later. He played moderately in his first season in the first team of 1997, before making a name for himself in the league in 1998. Participating mostly in Division Two prior to 2001, his team were promoted to Division One in 2002, having performed well at the end of the 2001 season, giving his team hope to progress further in the league.\nNext year, Glamorgan finished top of the points table in Division One, before failing in 2003. However his performances have remained steady since then, keeping his team in the top division until 2005, when the team dropped after winning one of 16 one-day game. Powell still scored above 1,000 runs, but was the team's second best run scorer after David Hemp. In 2006, Powell passed the 1,000-run mark after 11 games, scoring 299 against Essex but falling 10 runs short of Steve James' county record of 309. In 2007 after a successful operation to remove a rib Powell asked for, and was granted, permission to bury it beneath Sophia Gardens.After claiming to being held back at Glamorgan, Powell signed a two-year deal at Kent County Cricket Club, starting in 2012.\nHe retired from cricket after the 2013 season and took up a position with the Welsh risk consultancy firm Thomas Carroll PLC.Mike's uncle, Michael Powell, played cricket for Worcestershire Second XI in 1973 and Glamorgan Second XI in 1974 and 1975.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Glamorgan County Cricket Club in 2005", "response": ["After losing Knight and Wagh with only 4 added to the overnight score, the Champion county showed their class. After the start of the day, the pitch calmed down, and England hopeful, Ian Bell, who scored 96, and Mike Powell put on 153 for the fourth wicket. Dougie Brown then helped himself to a half-century being unbeaten on 85 at close, with Powell on 144 not out and Warwickshire on 415 for 4, 217 ahead. Alex Wharf and Simon Jones bowled enthusiastically, but without much to show for it.", "After rain, play began at 3pm at Bury St Edmunds with Glamorgan batting first. The highlight of their innings was an undefeated 100 from Matthew Elliott in 104 balls, with six of seven batsmen passing 20 as the visitors racked up 320 for 5. Mike Powell was the only Glamorgan batsman to not pass 20, as he was dismissed for a duck by former Essex bowler Andrew McGarry. Suffolk lost their first four batsmen \u2013 including New Zealand international Lou Vincent \u2013 for single-figure scores, going to 12 for 3 and then 33 for 4, and to spare the need for the match going into a second day, play continued in near-darkness to 8.40pm, with Glamorgan bowling their last 32 overs (all with spin, in order to make conditions playable for batsmen) in 80 minutes. Staffordshire finally finished on 177 for 8 off their 50 overs, with their numbers six, eight and nine in the order all passing 35. (Cricinfo scorecard)", "The third day, however, was the day of the spinners. After Matt Elliott (123), David Hemp (57) and Mike Powell (39) took Glamorgan to 274 for 2 and a lead of 47, Sri Lankan leg-spinner Upul Chandana and all-rounder Ian Fisher shared the last eight wickets between them for 71 runs, Chandana finishing with five for 117 and Fisher with four for 89, and resulting in a target of 119 for Gloucestershire to win. Glamorgan's spinners also took wickets, Dean Cosker and Robert Croft grabbing three as Gloucestershire to 59 for 3 at close on day 3, but on the morning of day 4, Gloucestershire batsman Tim Hancock \u2013 in his fifteenth season with the team \u2013 guided the visitors to the target with an unbeaten 41.", "On the third day, Newman (219) became the first man to make both a century and a double century in a game for Surrey as they finally declared on 425 for 4, leaving a theoretical target of 525. Bicknell then took his 1,000th wicket for Surrey as Glamorgan batted to 177 for 2 at close, with David Hemp and Mike Powell on 77 and 80 not out respectively. However, one session was enough to finish off Glamorgan, with Rikki Clarke and Mohammad Akram getting reverse swing to take 3 and 4 wickets respectively, as Glamorgan were reduced to 248 all out. Their last 7 wickets fell for 28 runs. (Cricinfo scorecard)", "Zimbabwean all-rounder Sean Ervine and wicket-keeper Nic Pothas made the most impact with ball and bat respectively for Hampshire as they defeated Glamorgan at Cardiff. Mike Powell was the only batsman to pass 40, making 56 runs in a little over an hour in a Glamorgan total of 214, while Ervine took five for 50 from his ten overs \u2013 admittedly mostly tail-enders, but he got the most wickets \u2013 while Chris Tremlett also took three for 32. Pothas then notched up the first limited-over century of the Hampshire season, scoring 114 not out off 127 balls and standing tall while Glamorgan's fast bowlers Andrew Davies and Simon Jones made inroads with the ball \u2013 Hampshire were 89 for 4 before England prospect Kevin Pietersen came in to hit 69 off 64 balls, including four sixes, as he shared a 130-run partnership with Pothas. Thanks to the quick scoring of Pothas and Pietersen, Hampshire won with nearly 11 overs to spare.", "Amid rains at Southampton, Hampshire batted their way to the big lead they were expected to get against Glamorgan, who had lost four games in the Championship before this. Former England batsman John Crawley took a day for his century, while in contrast Kevin Pietersen took two and a half hours for his, making a century off 99 balls and ending with 126. Hampshire eventually made 401 for 8 declared to get full batting points before attacking Glamorgan. Chris Tremlett reaped Glamorgan wickets in the next innings, removing David Hemp, Mike Powell and Jonathan Hughes among others to take four for 42 and reduce Glamorgan to 229 \u2013 a score that would have been much lower but for Darren Thomas, who blitzed his way to 63. Following on, Glamorgan got to 77 for 1 at stumps on day three, but wickets tumbled in the morning, reducing Glamorgan to 147 for 5. Robert Croft and Mike Powell rebuilt, but when Australian batsman Simon Katich had Croft caught by skipper Shane Warne and Powell went a few overs later, Glamorgan ended on a total of 250 as Zimbabwe all-rounder Sean Ervine picked up the last three wickets, finishing with five for 60, while Tremlett took three for 48. In reply, Hampshire reached the target of 79 inside fifteen overs, with Katich \u2013 unusually \u2013 opening the batting. With Nottinghamshire losing to Kent and Warwickshire and Surrey not playing, Hampshire took the lead in the Championship with their emphatic full-score win.", "James Hildreth was the most rapid scorer for the Sabres, making 46 off 26 deliveries at Sophia Gardens as Somerset Sabres made a total of 183 to Glamorgan Dragons. Alex Wharf took three wickets for Glamorgan, the most, but conceded 38 in three overs to be Glamorgan's most expensive bowler too. A highlight of Somerset's innings was the effort of their number 9 Gareth Andrew, who smashed three fours in his first three balls and then was bowled with the fourth. In reply, Glamorgan got to 126 for 2 before fifth- and sixth-change bowlers Keith Parsons and Hildreth got the better of them and shared five wickets, leaving Glamorgan at 167 for 7. However, Alex Wharf hung in there with Mike Powell, making 11 off five balls before he was caught off the sixth, and coupled with Powell's unbeaten 68 Glamorgan finished on a total of 183 for 8 after the 20 overs were up. The crowd seemed content with the one point and a tie, but the speaker informed the crowd of the actual result, that under Twenty20 Cup rules the team with the fewer wickets lost would win.", "James Hildreth hit his second quick knock against Glamorgan in a week, taking 71 runs off 37 balls to lift Somerset Sabres to a victory at Taunton. Along with Keith Parsons making 57 off 28, they made a dent in the theory that spinners are useful in Twenty20 cricket, as experienced off-spinner Robert Croft was dispatched for 50 runs in four overs. The slow left arm bowler Dean Cosker was also taken for 45 in his four, and Somerset made a total of 212 for 3. In reply, the visitors had no one to pass 30 once Mike Powell went, Ian Blackwell taking four Glamorgan Dragons wickets for 26 runs as the Welshmen crumbled to 123 all out, Sourav Ganguly top-scoring with 35.", "Glamorgan Dragons lengthened their run of losses to four, despite requiring 22 for the last seven wickets at Edgbaston. Jamie Troughton's 51 took Warwickshire Bears past 100 after they had lost their first four wickets for 56, and Dougie Brown along with eleven extras gave the hosts a total of 169 for 9. Glamorgan started well, with Sourav Ganguly and Matthew Elliott lifting them to 88 for 1 before leaving in quick succession to Neil Carter and Jonathan Trott respectively. Mike Powell and David Hemp (40 off 19 balls) then built another partnership of 59 to see Glamorgan 147 for 3, but Carter and Brown then shared five wickets as Glamorgan's next five wickets fell for six runs. Powell added 11 with Dean Cosker, but the damage was already done, and Powell was run out on the penultimate ball as they needed six runs from two balls. Adam Harrison needed to hit the final ball for six, but only managed a single.", "Worcestershire Royals failed to defend a total of 273 for 3 \u2013 their highest of the season thus far \u2013 against Glamorgan Dragons at New Road. Winning the toss and batting first, Worcestershire captain Vikram Solanki paired up for 91 with Stephen Moore, who would go on to make 104. Zander de Bruyn also made an unbeaten fifty to lift Worcestershire to 273 for 3. The Indian international Sourav Ganguly was the only Glamorgan bowler to escape with less than five runs an over to his name, as he got one wicket for 19 in his five overs. Worcestershire dismissed Robert Croft in the second over, but Glamorgan sent out another pinch-hitter in Alex Wharf who made 38 before he was bowled by David Leatherdale, who took two for 35. Another wicket fell shortly afterwards, and Glamorgan were 67 for 3, but Sourav Ganguly made 53, Mike Powell contributed 82, and David Hemp sealed the win with his unbeaten 51 off 36 ball. The Glamorgan batsman took a particular liking to England Test spinner Gareth Batty who finished wicketless for 69 runs.", "After a first day where Glamorgan had racked up 380 runs, Mike Powell top-scoring with 111 and Alex Wharf making 77 while Syed Rasel took four for 89, the touring Bangladesh A side were sent in to bat. Only 10.1 overs of play was possible on the second day, though, and Andrew Davies took two wickets while Alex Wharf was taken for 36 runs off just five overs. Day three was rained out, so the match at Abergavenny ended in a draw, with Bangladesh A finishing on 54 for 2.", "Gloucestershire Gladiators crashed back into the relegation zone with a defeat against Glamorgan Dragons at Sophia Gardens, succumbing to medium pace bowler David Harrison, who bowled four maiden overs to end with bowling figures of 9\u20134\u201316\u20132. Despite half-centuries from Kabir Ali and Alex Gidman, who looked to give the visitors a comfortable target after moving to 103 for 3, Dean Cosker ripped out three quick wickets, and Gidman was forced to consolidate. He did top score with 62, but Glamorgan were set a rather modest target of 195 to win. Jon Lewis made inroads with his medium pace early on, taking three wickets as Glamorgan stuttered to 40 for 4, but Mike Powell and Dan Cherry put Glamorgan back in it with a 79-run stand, and Gloucestershire's bowlers were made to rue their 15 wides, as they helped Glamorgan to reach their target with two overs remaining.", "Glamorgan went down to another loss the week after recording their first Championship win, as it took Nottinghamshire's bowlers 48 overs to wrap up their first innings after Glamorgan won the toss and batted. Glamorgan's number five Mike Powell made 62 as the only Glamorgan batsman to pass 25, but left-armer Greg Smith got him and three others out to finish with four for 28 off 17 overs. Glamorgan's final total was 151, and Nottinghamshire matched that for the loss of only two wickets at the close of the first day, despite losing opener Jason Gallian for a duck. On the second, only 33 overs of play were possible, but Nottinghamshire still added 80 before Darren Bicknell was dismissed for 123. The last seven partnerships mustered 52 runs \u2013 a quarter of what the first three partnerships had managed, as Robert Croft took three wickets and Dean Cosker four either side of stumps on the second day.", "David Hemp made 71 as Glamorgan made their way to a relatively competitive total of 255 in 77.3 overs on the first day, while Mushtaq Ahmed took five for 89 and James Kirtley four for 42 in response. When Glamorgan bowled, Alex Wharf and Dean Cosker took a wicket each, as Sussex worked their way to 70 for 2. After a first day yielding 12 wickets, a further 19 went down on the second day, as Sussex took the victory to further extend the gap between the two sides. Sussex lost Ian Ward for 48 early on in the day, but fifties from Murray Goodwin and Chris Adams propelled them to a total of 317, a lead of 62. Rana Naved-ul-Hasan then made up for his wicketless first innings effort by having two men caught behind and one bowled, as Glamorgan lost their first three wickets for 22, before Dan Cherry and Mike Powell forged a half-century partnership for Glamorgan. Once again, the Pakistanis broke through, with Rana and Mushtaq sharing five wickets, four of them ducks, and Glamorgan went from 73\u20134 to 78\u20139. Opener Cherry was last out, for 39, as Glamorgan were bowled out for 96 \u2013 Rana taking five for 41 and Mushtaq five for 29. Sussex were set a target of 35, which they passed for the loss of Ward to end with a nine-wicket victory.", "Scott Styris conceded 56 runs with the ball for Middlesex Crusaders in this National League game, but his four wickets near the end cut short Glamorgan's chase to bring Middlesex to victory. The Crusaders had been inserted by Glamorgan Dragons captain Robert Croft, against a Dragons side whose National League season had seen their best performances, as both Championship, Twenty20 and C&G had seen them finish below ninth. After Ed Smith departed for 6, fifties from Paul Weekes and Owais Shah sent Middlesex to 133 for 1. Dean Cosker took two quick wickets, but 37 off 27 balls from left-hander Ed Joyce helped Middlesex to a total of 239 for 5. Peter Trego then removed both openers, before Alex Wharf took him for runs (ending with 40 off 20 balls), and Trego ended with one maiden over, two wickets, and 31 runs off three overs. Wharf was eventually caught by Smith, but David Hemp, Dan Cherry and Richard Grant all added more than 30 in stands with Mike Powell, and at 219 for 5, Glamorgan needed 21 for the last five wickets. Styris had the last laugh, however, taking three wickets in the late overs and bowling Glamorgan out with eight balls remaining in their quota to leave Powell stranded on 83 not out.", "Glamorgan Dragons recorded a victory at their home ground Sophia Gardens, despite the bowling of Sean Ervine and Shaun Udal who took two wickets each and both conceded less than 40 runs. Wicket-keeper Mark Wallace hit one six and one four in an above-run-a-ball 32, while Mike Powell had set the pace with 52 from number four. Hampshire Hawks were then shot down in the chase. David Harrison had John Crawley caught with the second ball of the match, and Andrew Davies followed up, getting Greg Lamb and Ervine caught behind. With James Adams bowled by Harrison, Hampshire had scored seven runs for four wickets, and their lower order could not muster enough runs to chase the target of 221 to win. Jono McLean was the first to hit into double figures, before he too was caught behind off Davies, and Harrison then took two as Hampshire were 33 for 7. Kevin Latouf and Shaun Udal adjusted somewhat, adding 19 for the eighth wicket, but first change bowler Alex Wharf cleaned up them as well, leaving Hampshire all out for 69 \u2013 the lowest score of the National League Division One all season, and giving Glamorgan the highest victory by runs in the division all season.", "|| Mike Powell || 16 || 31 || 2 || 1038 || 111 || 1 || 6 || 35.79", "|| Mike Powell || 16 || 14 || 2 || 488 || 83* || 0 || 5 || 40.66"]}, {"page": "Mike Powell (Glamorgan cricketer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Mike Powell (Welsh cricketer)"]}, {"page": "2002 County Championship", "response": ["| Mike Powell"]}, {"page": "2004 NatWest Series", "response": ["* Mike Powell"]}, {"page": "Mike Powell (cricketer, born 1977)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Mike Powell (Welsh cricketer)"]}, {"page": "Kent County Cricket Club in 2012", "response": ["Kent signed five players ahead of the 2012 season.
