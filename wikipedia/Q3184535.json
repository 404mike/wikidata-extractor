He was the first to bring to notice to English botany, the parasitic plant with one of the world's largest flowers, Rafflesia arnoldii, which was named after him posthumously. His specimen collection is in the museum of the Linnean Society.\nBorn in Beccles, Suffolk, the fourth son of Edward Arnold, a tanner and Hannah (d. 1786). He was schooled at John Leman's Free School and at the age of sixteen apprenticed to apothecary William Crowfoot. Arnold learned surgery in Edinburgh and received an MD in 1806. with a thesis on De Hydrothorace also known as dropsy of the chest. He joined the Royal Navy and was posted assistant surgeon on HMS Victory from April 1808 to February 1809. After recovering from typhus at Portsmouth, he was posted as surgeon on HMS Hindostan. This sailed to Sydney via the Cape of Good Hope and returned Cape Horn and Rio de Janeiro, commanded by William Bligh who offered to introduce Arnold to Sir Joseph Banks in London. In 1811, he was posted to Haslar Hospital in Portsmouth to handle patients with malignant fever. He then served aboard HMS Alcmene, HMS Hibernia, and HMS America around the Mediterranean, during which period he made a visit to the crater of Vesuvius. A meeting with Alexander Macleay made him interested in South American insects and he chose an appointment in 1814 as surgeon superintendent aboard the female convict vessel HMS Northumberland and went collecting insects on reaching Rio de Janeiro. He reached Sydney in 1815. After 1815, he unsuccessfully tried to work as surgeon in Sydney, and upon his return trip to England aboard the Indefatigable he was stranded in Batavia and the ship caught fire with Arnold losing most of his possessions. He was aided by Charles Assey, also from Beccles, and stayed at Bogor and collected some specimens. He returned to England in May 1816 during which time he met Dawson Turner. In 1818, he worked with Sir Stamford Raffles sailing with him in November 1817 from Falmouth aboard the Lady Raffles and assisted Lady Raffles en route in giving birth to her first child. They reached Benkulen on 19 March 1818. Arnold then travelled on to Passemah Ulu Manna. It is thought that he may have contracted malaria on this journey. Despite being ill, he helped the wife of Captain Thomas Otho Travers and then returned to Benkulen on 8 July 1818. He then recovered and set out to the Menangkabau highlands. It was only when Stamford Raffles visited Padang on 30 July that they learned of Arnold's death four days earlier. His burial site was never documented and has never been located.The largest flowering plant, Rafflesia arnoldii, was discovered by an Indonesian guide working for him and later named in Arnold's honour. Arnold found the plant at Pulao Lebar on 19 May 1818 and wrote a letter to Raffles on 9 July 1818. The scientific name was assigned to it by Robert Brown two years later. Dawson Turner commissioned a memorial by Francis Chantrey to Arnold at the Beccles Parish Church.The memorial includes the inscription (with errors in the dates):", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Rafflesia", "response": ["Rafflesia () is a genus of parasitic flowering plants in the family Rafflesiaceae. The species have enormous flowers, the buds rising from the ground or directly from the lower stems of their host plants; one species has the largest flowers in the world. The genus contains approximately 28 species (including four incompletely characterized species as recognized in 1997 by Willem Meijer in the latest monograph on the genus), all found in Southeast Asia, mainly in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines. For Western Europe, it was first discovered by French surgeon and naturalist  in Java between 1791 and 1794, but his notes and illustrations, seized by the British in 1803, were not available to western science until 1861. The first British person to see one was Joseph Arnold in 1818, in the Indonesia rainforest in Bengkulu, Sumatra, after a Malay servant working for him discovered a flower and pointed it out to him. It was later named after Stamford Raffles, the leader of the expedition."]}, {"page": "Rafflesia arnoldii", "response": ["In 1818 the British surgeon Joseph Arnold collected a specimen of another Rafflesia species found by a Malay servant in a part of Sumatra, then a British colony called British Bencoolen (now Bengkulu), during an expedition run by the recently appointed Lieutenant-Governor of Bencoolen, Stamford Raffles. Arnold contracted a fever and died soon after the discovery, the preserved material being sent to Banks. Banks passed on the materials, and the honour to study them was given to Robert Brown. The British Museum's resident botanical artist Franz Bauer was commissioned to make illustrations of the new plants. Brown eventually gave a speech before the June 1820 meeting of the Linnean Society of London, where he first introduced the genus and its until then two species. Brown gave the generic name Rafflesia in honour of Raffles. Bauer completed his pictures some time in mid-1821, but the actual article on the subject continued to languish."]}, {"page": "Sir John Leman High School", "response": ["* Joseph Arnold, naval surgeon and naturalist"]}, {"page": "Arnold, Joseph", "response": ["#REDIRECT Joseph Arnold"]}, {"page": "Elizabeth Reef", "response": ["On 19 July 1815 Matthew Bowles Master of the Indefatigable sailed past a reef with Joseph Arnold recording"]}]}}
