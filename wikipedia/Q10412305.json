Scunthorpe made a double-substitution at the beginning of the second half of extra time with Jason White and Graham Alexander, two 20-year-olds, coming on in place of Daws and Buckley.  With no change to the scoreline after 120 minutes, the match went to a penalty shootout.  The first six spot-kicks were converted, making it 3\u20133, before Alexander's weak shot was saved by McIlhargey.
