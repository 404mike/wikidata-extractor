Ekins then earned his HND Science Applied Biology from Nottingham Trent University (formerly Polytechnic, 1988\u20131991), graduating in 1991, with a sandwich year (1989\u20131990) at the pharmaceutical company Servier in Fulmer, UK where his interest in drug discovery was established. Ekins then earned his MSc in Clinical Pharmacology (1991\u20131992) at the University of Aberdeen with a dissertation entitled \"Speculations on the relative roles of cytochrome P450 and flavin containing monooxygenase in the metabolism of S12363\" he then earned a PhD in clinical pharmacology, at the University of Aberdeen in 1996, funded by Servier, and wrote a thesis entitled \"Maintenance and cryopreservation of xenobiotic metabolism in precision-cut liver slices.
