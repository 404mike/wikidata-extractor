She says, \"I have a little book beside my bed, where I put all my ideas for songs and stuff. It's kind of weird, 'cuz usually when I'm having a dream, I'll wake up, and I'll write something down, then I'll look at it again and think, 'God, what was I dreaming about?'\"", "* Yak Bondy \u2013 keyboards ", "* Yak Bondy \u2013 production "]}, {"page": "Honey to the B", "response": ["*Yak Bondy \u2013 backing vocals, keyboards, piano, vocoder, programming"]}, {"page": "Alexander Klaws", "response": ["Here I Am, Klaws's second album, was released in July 2004.

In spite of this, the album managed to snag Klaws another three hit singles, including the top five hits \"Behind the Sun\" and \"Sunshine After the Rain\" as well as the top 20 entry \"Here I Am\".

With the introduction of a strongly distorted rhythm guitar, the P.O.X. brought in a further style element which was still uncommon in psychobilly in 1984. In connection with likewise atypically distorted singing resulted in the characteristic P.O.X. sound, which distinguished itself clearly from the traditional psychobilly sound of a slap bass dominated band. Starting from 1985, the P.O.X. used also MIDI and samples, which again represented an innovation in the scene.

The album was widely acclaimed by critics as being the \"one of best solo Spice records ever\" due to its catchy and fun use of sounds from the Motown and the 1960s era. The lead single, \"Free Me\", sold well in the UK, peaking at number five on the UK Singles Chart. \"Maybe\" was released as the second single in the autumn of 2003, and also gained extensive airplay throughout the UK, peaking at number six, one position lower than its predecessor. In the spring of 2004, the album and its third single, \"I'll Be There\", were released. The single, like its two predecessors, performed well on the charts, peaking at number seven. Later in the year, the fourth single, \"Crickets Sing for Anamaria\", was released. Despite its harder beat and grittier sound, by now the impact of Free Me was beginning to wear off, and the song only came in at number 15 on the UK Singles Chart, totalling 25,000 copies, and becoming Bunton's lowest-selling single.
