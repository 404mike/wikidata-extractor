This conclusion led him to be the first to identify cooperative binding, in the context of oxygen binding to haemoglobin.\nGilbert Smithson Adair was born on 21 September 1896 in Whitehaven, son of Harold and Anna Mary Adair (n\u00e9e Jackson), who were Quakers. Gilbert and his sister Anna were initially taught at home by a governess. Later, Gilbert was taught at the Quaker Bootham School, where he was a boarder. The family, meanwhile had moved to Egremont, where Harold Adair was managing director of Wyndham Mining Company Ltd. an iron ore mine.\nAdair entered King's College, Cambridge from 1915 to 1917, gaining a first in Natural Sciences. He was soon employed by the Food Investigation Board, a wartime research group set up by the DSIR to determine how to prevent wastage of food, particularly fish, meat, fruits, etc. on cargo ships.In 1920, he became a research student at King's College, and was made an official Fellow in 1928, granting him five years to devote to research. In 1931, he became assistant director of the Physiological Laboratory in Cambridge. He was a Reader in Biophysics from 1945 until his retirement in 1963.  Adair was made a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1939.He married Muriel Elaine Robinson in Cambridge in 1931. Muriel had entered Girton College in 1918, and went on to obtain a research fellowship at Newnham. She died on 2 January 1975.As an incidental historical note, Adair provided the purified haemoglobin that Max Perutz used for the first structure determination of any protein (by X-ray crystallography).Gilbert Smithson Adair died in Cambridge on 22 June 1979.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hemoglobin", "response": ["In 1825, Johann Friedrich Engelhart discovered that the ratio of iron to protein is identical in the hemoglobins of several species. From the known atomic mass of iron he calculated the molecular mass of hemoglobin to n \u00d7 16000 (n = number of iron atoms per hemoglobin, now known to be 4), the first determination of a protein's molecular mass. This \"hasty conclusion\" drew a lot of ridicule at the time from scientists who could not believe that any molecule could be that big. Gilbert Smithson Adair confirmed Engelhart's results in 1925 by measuring the osmotic pressure of hemoglobin solutions."]}, {"page": "List of biologists", "response": ["*Gilbert Smithson Adair (1896\u20131979), British protein chemist who  identified cooperative binding of oxygen binding haemoglobin."]}, {"page": "List of biochemists", "response": ["* Gilbert Smithson Adair FRS (1896\u20131979).

The possibility that some proteins are non-covalent associations of such macromolecules was shown by Gilbert Smithson Adair (by measuring the osmotic pressure of hemoglobin) and, later, by Frederic M. Richards in his studies of ribonuclease S.  The mass spectrometry of proteins has long been a useful technique for identifying posttranslational modifications and, more recently, for probing protein structure."]}, {"page": "Category talk:Academics of the University of Cambridge", "response": ["Gilbert Smithson Adairnot yet classified"]}, {"page": "Adair (name)", "response": ["* Gilbert Smithson Adair (1896\u20131979), British scientist"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society A, B, C", "response": ["| Gilbert Smithson Adair||16/03/1939||22 September 1896 \u2013 22 June 1979"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1939", "response": ["*Gilbert Smithson Adair"]}]}}
