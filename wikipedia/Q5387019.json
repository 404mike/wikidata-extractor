Mackay and Corelli, born Mary Mackay, were the children of Charles Mackay, by different mothers (Mary was illegitimate, with Charles marrying her mother subsequently).\nAs a poet he is described as \"execrable\", and reliant on Corelli's promotion of his works. His first works appeared in periodicals in the early 1860s; he  achieved some reputation in his time for Letters of a Violinist (1886). It sold 35,000 copies; he repaid Corelli's efforts by implying he wrote her novels.A 1940 biography of Corelli, George Bullock's Marie Corelli: The Life and Death of a Best-Seller, hinted that the relationship was incestuous; this has generally been discounted, though Eric's laziness and lack of scruples are acknowledged. This was an old rumour, attributed to Edmund Gosse.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Literary Taste: How to Form It", "response": ["* Eric Mackay: Love-letters of a Violinist*"]}, {"page": "List of compositions by Gustav Holst", "response": ["| Vocal || align=center|62 || align=center|  || align=center|1903 || A Prayer for Light || for voice and piano || words by Eric Mackay"]}, {"page": "George Eric Mackay", "response": ["#REDIRECT Eric Mackay"]}, {"page": "Mackay, Eric", "response": ["#redirectEric Mackay"]}]}}
