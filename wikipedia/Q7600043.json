He won back his old seat in a three-cornered race against Blundell and a Liberal candidate at the 1922 election. He was re-elected in 1925, 1928 and 1929. Yates advocated the adoption of Song of Australia as the Australian national anthem, and once sang it in parliament in an attempt to prove its appropriateness for the setting. In 1929, he endorsed and campaigned for independent Labor candidate Stanley Whitford for the Legislative Council against endorsed Labor candidate Doug Bardolph after a contentious preselection. He was defeated at the 1931 election by Nationalist candidate Fred Stacey.", "After his federal defeat, he was selected as one of two official Labor candidates for the South Australian Legislative Council seat of Central No. 1 Province at the 1933 election, held in the fallout of the 1931 Labor split. He was defeated for the second seat by Parliamentary Labor Party incumbent Stanley Whitford amidst some controversy over the system of preferential voting being used at the election. He nominated for preselection in Adelaide at the 1934 federal election, but lost to Ken Bardolph; he initially threatened to contest the seat as an independent in protest at alleged irregularities in the vote, but later withdrew. He unsuccessfully contested Boothby at the 1940 federal election, having stood aside in his old seat of Adelaide for former Labor leader Edgar Dawes."]}, {"page": "Candidates of the 1917 Australian federal election", "response": ["|Barker || Nationalist || Stanley Whitford || |John Livingston"]}, {"page": "Candidates of the 1919 Australian federal election", "response": ["|Boothby || Nationalist || Stanley Whitford || |William Story || George Illingworth (Ind)"]}, {"page": "Electoral district of North Adelaide", "response": ["| Stanley Whitford "]}, {"page": "Members of the South Australian House of Assembly, 1921\u20131924", "response": ["|| Stanley Whitford || Labor ||  North Adelaide || 1921\u20131927"]}, {"page": "Stanley R.
