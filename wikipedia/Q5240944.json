Several MPs elected in the 1940s and 1950s went on to be Ministers in Harold Wilson's governments of the 1960s and 1970s: The Lord Barnett, Edmund Dell, John Diamond, Reg Freeson, The Baroness Gaitskell, Myer Galpern, Gerald Kaufman, The Lord Lever of Manchester, Paul Rose, The Lord Segal, The Baroness Serota, The Lord Sheldon, John and Samuel Silkin, Barnett Stross, and David Weitzman. A prominent Jewish Labour politician in this era was Leo Abse, who put forward the private members' bill which decriminalised homosexuality and reformed the divorce laws in Britain. Robert Maxwell, a Labour MP during the 1964\u201366 Wilson government, eventually became a leading newspaper publisher when his holding company purchased Mirror Group Newspapers in 1984."]}, {"page": "Weitzman, David", "response": ["#redirectDavid Weitzman"]}, {"page": "List of Queen's Counsel in England and Wales appointed in 1951", "response": ["| height=\"19\" |David Weitzman", "|\" Mr. David Weitzman.\" Times, 8 May 1987, p. 16.For details of the lipstick case, see Donald Thomas, The Enemy Within Hucksters, Racketeers, Deserters, and Civilians During the Second World War (New York, NY: New York University Press), p. 372."]}]}}
