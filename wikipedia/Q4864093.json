She first came to public attention after being covered in an ITV documentary, Too Long a Winter, made by Yorkshire Television and produced by Barry Cockcroft, which chronicled the almost unendurable conditions of farmers in the High Pennines in winter.", "In the summer of 1972, Hauxwell was discovered by a friend of a researcher at Yorkshire Television while out walking in the Yorkshire Dales. The researcher contacted Barry Cockcroft, a producer at the company, who proposed to make a TV documentary tentatively entitled The Hard Life.  The documentary started with her leading a cow into a shed during a blizzard in Baldersdale. After the documentary was first shown in 1972, Yorkshire TV's phone line was jammed for three days with viewers wanting to find out more and help her. ITV received hundreds of phone calls and mail containing gifts and money for \"the old lady in the Yorkshire Dales\". A local factory raised money to fund getting electricity to Low Birk Hatt Farm, and she continued to receive thousands of letters and donations from well-wishers around the world.", "In 1992 director Barry Cockcroft once again ventured into Hauxwell's life making a documentary series which followed Hauxwell on her first trips outside of the UK. Hauxwell visited France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Italy, during which she met the Pope.  The series proved so popular it was followed by another trip, this time to the United States in 1994, filmed as Hannah:USA."]}, {"page": "Cockcroft", "response": ["* Barry Cockcroft (1933\u20132001), British television documentary director", "* Barry Cockcroft (dentist), Chief Dental Officer (CDO) for England"]}, {"page": "Brian Plummer", "response": ["The UK television documentary maker Barry Cockcroft made several documentaries about Plummer, including A Way Out of Walsall (1985), which is about Plummer's training pupils of the local Forest Comprehensive School for the world of professional boxing,BFI.org and Lone Furrow (1987, which looks at the preoccupation of Plummer with his dogs, which have been rat-catchers, and his current wish to cross the Highlands pulled by a pack of German shepherd dogs.BFI.org Another producer, Michael Croucher, made a 1981 documentary entitled Hunting Man about Plummer, formerly a full-time hunter and later a teacher and writer, who at that time still hunted in the fast-disappearing countryside around Birmingham.BFI.org"]}, {"page": "Deaths in February 2001", "response": ["*Barry Cockcroft, 68, British television documentary director and filmmaker (Too Long a Winter)."]}, {"page": "The Underground Eiger", "response": ["Simon Garvey and Stuart Herbage, two of the cavers, recalled that their only \"acting lessons\" consisted of two pieces of advice from Barry Cockcroft: \"act naturally\" and \"don't look at the camera.\""]}]}}
