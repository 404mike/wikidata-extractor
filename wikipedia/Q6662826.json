She ponders various strategies such as pretending to do up her shoes in order to let her follower overtake her or simply running away, but dismisses each idea as endangering her even more. Eventually she screws up her courage to turn around and confront the man behind her, but when she does so she sees nothing except a mobile phone glowing on the ground as it calls somebody. James (Lloyd Woolf), her follower, has actually been going out of his way to avoid the impression he is following her or is a threat, but every time he does so it somehow backfires. He tries speeding up to overtake her, but this only makes Martha walk faster. He ponders taking a different route, but there are no turnings off the path they are walking down. Eventually he decides to make a \"loud non-threatening phone call\" to his mum, reasoning that: \"I bet rapists never call their mums.\"  However, as he is distracted with finding her number in his phone, he fails to notice a manhole in the ground and falls head over heels into it, his phone flying to the ground near Martha's feet."]}, {"page": "The Double (2013 film)", "response": ["* Lloyd Woolf as Investigator"]}, {"page": "Joe Tucker", "response": ["Joe Tucker is a British comedy writer, director and animator known for directing and co-writing the award-winning short film For the Love of God.
