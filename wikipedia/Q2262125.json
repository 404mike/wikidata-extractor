Stocks also stated that Bruce Payne and Sean Cronin were 'excellent' as the Ferrino brothers, 'with Payne quietly sinister and Cronin a more brooding presence'. Mondo Squallido stated that 'there may be a bit too much going on in this film, but I enjoyed it'. In Tony Black's view 'there\u2019s only one, slight reason to watch The Antwerp Dolls and it can be described in two words: Bruce Payne. Black stated that 'Payne is one of those B-movie actors with such slimy, educated delivery you can\u2019t help but enjoy him chewing the scenery, even when he\u2019s given the kind of painful direlogue Reid affords him in his amateurish script; one specific court-holding monologue about monkeys and dolphins is hilarious because it\u2019s trying to be so poignant'. Black lamented that 'Payne barely appears and instead we lurch from one set of tedious, morose, cartoonish Cockney villains to the next, all mostly shouting and growling angrily as they clomp their way through a narrative that wishes it was Scorsese-clever, but feels like Vinnie Jones with a hangover'."]}, {"page": "Sean Cronin", "response": ["Sean Cronin may refer to:", "* Sean Cronin (Wisconsin politician) (died 2019), American meteorologist and political candidate", "* Sean Cronin (actor) (born 1964), English actor and director"]}, {"page": "Welcome to Curiosity", "response": ["*Sean Cronin as Nikolai"]}, {"page": "Eliminators (2016 film)", "response": ["* Sean Cronin as Big Boss Man"]}, {"page": "Rendel (film)", "response": ["On August 16, 2019, Haaja announced shooting would begin in September.
