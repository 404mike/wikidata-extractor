A poor row in the first round, West's 23rd birthday, saw them lose to a strong Australian crew, but they won the repechage. In the final Britain led from start to finish to win the gold medal for the first time since the 1912 Stockholm Olympic Games, with West being the youngest member of the crew, and the first member of Cambridge University to win at the Olympics while still a student. Australia took the silver.
