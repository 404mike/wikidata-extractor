The Blue Mountain (1908\u20131909) was painted at this time, demonstrating his trend toward abstraction. A mountain of blue is flanked by two broad trees, one yellow and one red. A procession, with three riders and several others, crosses at the bottom. The faces, clothing, and saddles of the riders are each a single color, and neither they nor the walking figures display any real detail. The flat planes and the contours also are indicative of Fauvist influence. The broad use of color in The Blue Mountain illustrates Kandinsky's inclination toward an art in which colour is presented independently of form, and which each color is given equal attention. The composition is more planar; the painting is divided into four sections: the sky, the red tree, the yellow tree, and the blue mountain with the three riders."]}, {"page": "1854", "response": ["* February 16 \u2013 Charles Webster Leadbeater, British theosophist (d. 1934)"]}, {"page": "1934", "response": ["**Charles Webster Leadbeater, British author and Theosophist (b. 1854)"]}, {"page": "Indigo children", "response": ["Daniel Kline, in an essay titled \"The New Kids: Indigo Children and New Age Discourse\", notes that the magical belief that the innocence of children equates to spiritual powers has existed for centuries, and that the indigo child movement is rooted in a religious rejection of science-based medicine.

The society refused to pay them and expelled them from their premises, at which the couple turned to the Madras-based Christian College Magazine, who published an expos\u00e9 of Blavatsky's alleged fraudulence using the Coulomb's claims as a basis. The story attracted international attention and was picked up by London-based newspaper, The Times. In response, in November 1884 Blavatsky headed to Cairo, where she and Theosophist Charles Webster Leadbeater searched for negative information on Emma Coulomb, discovering stories of her alleged former history of extortion and criminality.

Subsequent leaders of the Society, namely Annie Besant (1847\u20131933) and Charles Webster Leadbeater (1854\u20131934) interpreted modern theosophy as a form of ecumenical esoteric Christianity, resulting in their proclamation of Indian Jiddu Krishnamurti (1895\u20131986) as world messiah.
