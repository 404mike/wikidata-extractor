Following this, and an increased investment of \u00a31\u00a0million per year from the club, a number of players broke through to the first team squad; ahead of the 2010\u201311 season, almost a third of the Derby squad were academy graduates, with Mason Bennett setting the club record for youngest first team appearance when he made his full debut with a start in a defeat at Middlesbrough on 22 October 2011 at the age of 15 years and 99 days old. This helped strengthen the academy's reputation and reinforced CEO Tom Glick's stated desire to make Moor Farm \"the academy of choice in the Midlands.\" In August 2012, Derby's academy became a tier 2 academy under the new controversial Elite Player Performance Plan. It was awarded Tier 1 status two years later in July 2014. Focus on the academy continued during the ownership of Mel Morris after his purchase of the club later that year and, at the end of the 2019-20 season Derby had given more first-team minutes to players aged under 21 than any other club in the Football League Championship, with academy graduates such as Max Bird, Louie Sibley, Jason Knight, Jayden Bogle, Morgan Whittaker and Lee Buchanan getting a total of 7,946 minutes in the league during the campaign. When discussing targets for the 2020-21 campaign, Morris stated \"We are not going to see a team of 11 players from the Academy featuring this season (2019/20) but the target for next season (is) 50% of our starting 11 should be Academy players. That (is) our target, and I think there is a possibility we could get there.\""]}, {"page": "Craig Ramage", "response": ["He worked as a commentator for BBC Radio Derby on Derby County matches, but was dropped by the BBC after he said in February 2020 that the \"young black lads\" in the Derby team (Max Lowe and Jayden Bogle) should \"go back to basics, working hard\"."]}, {"page": "Bogle (surname)", "response": ["* Jayden Bogle (born 2000), English footballer"]}, {"page": "2018\u201319 Derby County F.C. season", "response": ["|37||||RB||Jayden Bogle                                      ||2||0||0||0||2 "]}]}}
