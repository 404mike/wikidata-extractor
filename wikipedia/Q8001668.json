He played 367 games for Newcastle scoring 8 goals. He also played for the Scotland national team, winning five caps between 1911 and 1920.Low remained with Newcastle after his playing retirement, firstly as a coach for the Swifts junior side, then latterly as the club's groundsman.", "link_mentions": {}}}
