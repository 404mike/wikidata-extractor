He released Void Dweller, with its dark and hard driving beats, on Columbia Records in September 1992; it used samples from David Lynch's Dune, The Outer Limits, and themes from the horror movie Basket Case.\nHis sound was a link between the early Detroit techno and contemporary dance music. In the early 1990s, this release was shared between DJs and musicians and was very influential. Eon was known for the acid techno song called \"Spice\" which was released in November 1990. Later in his career, he worked with Baby Ford and Bizarre Inc., and released singles on Trelik Records and Electron Industries.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Buffy the Vampire Slayer (film)", "response": ["The soundtrack does not include every song played in the film, which also included \"Everybody Hurts\" by R.E.M., \"In the Wind\" by War Babies, and \"Inner Mind\" by Eon."]}, {"page": "List of one-word stage names", "response": ["* Eon (1954\u20132009), British producer"]}, {"page": "Unusual types of gramophone records", "response": ["On the 12 inch single of Spice released in 1990 by Eon, the locked groove at the end of the disc continues the instrumental lead-out of the track indefinitely as long as the DJ wished to let it play."]}, {"page": "Eon", "response": ["Eon or Eons may refer to:", "* Eon (geology), a division of the geologic time scale", "* Eon, in the 2007 film Ben 10: Race Against Time", "* Eon, in the 1976 TV special Rudolph's Shiny New Year", "* Master Eon, a character in Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure", "* Eon, a character in the TV series Eon Kid", "* Eon Films, a Mexican film distributor", "* Eon Productions, a British film production company", "* Eon (role-playing game)", "* Eon Digital Entertainment, a British computer games publisher", "* Eon Products, an American game company", "* Eon (novel), by Greg Bear, 1985", "* Eon (comics), a fictional cosmic entity in the Marvel Universe", "* Eon (magazine), for players of Eve Online", "* Eon, or The Two Pearls of Wisdom, a 2008 novel by Alison Goodman", "* Eon (album), a 1975 album by Richard Beirach, including a track \"Eon\"", "* Eon, a 2008 album by Grafton Primary", "* \"Eon\", a 2012 song by Celldweller from Wish Upon a Blackstar", "* Eons, a 2014 album by Mimicking Birds", "* \"Eons\", a song on the album Soundsystem by 311", "* Eon (musician) (1954\u20132009), British musician", "* Mr. Eon, American rapper", "* Eon (Korean given name)", "* Eon of Axum, 5th-century King of Axum", "* Eon Densworth (born 1938), former Australian rules footballer", "* Eon Hooper (born 1991), Guyanese cricketer", "* Kim Eon (born 1973), Korean poet", "* Lee Eon (1981\u20132008),  South Korean actor and model", "* Eon McKai (born 1979),  American director of pornographic films", "* Daniel Eon (born 1939), retired French footballer", "** Elliotts of Newbury Eon, a monoplane built 1947\u20131950", "* Hyundai Eon, an automobile", "* Eon Mountain, in Canada", "* Eons.com, a former social networking website", "* D'Eon, a surname"]}, {"page": "Vinyl Solution", "response": ["* Eon"]}, {"page": "List of Peel sessions", "response": ["* Eon: (2 sessions, 1991\u20132002)", "* Modern Eon: (1 session, 1981)"]}, {"page": "Baby Ford", "response": ["Peter Ford, better known as Baby Ford, is a British electronic music record producer, known particularly for his contributions to the birth of acid house.
