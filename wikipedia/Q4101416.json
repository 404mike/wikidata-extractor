Bannister was purchased by Manchester United from Manchester City in 1906. He helped the club win the 1908 league championship. He left United in 1909 to go to Preston North End.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Billy Meredith", "response": ["City won immediate promotion as Second Division champions in 1902\u201303, with Meredith scoring 22 goals in 37 appearances and claiming a hat-trick against Chesterfield Town. Maley managed to find him a suitable inside-right partner in Jimmy Bannister, who was unselfish in his play and willing to feed the ball through to Meredith. He also played Sammy Frost at half-back, who was able to win the ball and bring Meredith into the play, and signed outside-left Frank Booth to balance the attack. Maley encouraged teamwork, meaning there was less pressure on Meredith from opposition defenders.", "In May 1906, while still serving his ban, Meredith moved to Manchester United. He joined on a free transfer and received a \u00a3500 signing-on fee from United; Manchester City reluctantly accepted the transfer as they had previously signed an undertaking promising Meredith a benefit match, and he was willing to forego on the agreement if the club instead granted his transfer. He returned from suspension on 1 January 1907, and marked his debut at Bank Street with an assist for Sandy Turnbull to score the only goal of the game against Aston Villa. In addition to Turnbull, Meredith was joined at United by former City teammates Jimmy Bannister and Herbert Burgess. This new forward line made the team into a powerful force, as they already possessed a dominant half-back line in captain Charlie Roberts, Dick Duckworth and Alex Bell. They ended the 1906\u201307 season in eighth place in the First Division."]}, {"page": "Sandy Turnbull", "response": ["Born in Hurlford to James and Jessie Turnbull of 1 Gibson Street, Kilmarnock, Ayrshire, Turnbull started his football career with his hometown club, Hurlford Thistle. He later moved to Manchester City. In 1905, City was found guilty of malpractice relating to payments of its players, and the entire squad was suspended from playing football. When the ban was lifted on 31 December 1906, Turnbull moved to City's crosstown rivals Manchester United, along with Billy Meredith, Herbert Burgess and Jimmy Bannister. His first game for United came on the next day, 1 January 1907, against Aston Villa. Along with Meredith, he helped the club to their first championship in 1908 and the 1909 FA Cup, scoring the only goal in the final, against Bristol City. In 1908 alone, he would score 27 goals in 25 games. On 19 February 1909, Turnbull scored the first ever goal at Old Trafford, in a 4\u20133 loss against Liverpool. He would go on to score 100 goals for the club in 245 games. His final game for the Reds came against Sheffield United in 1915."]}, {"page": "Herbert Burgess", "response": ["Born in Openshaw, Manchester, Burgess began his football career with Glossop North End, but soon signed for Manchester City. He made his debut for City on 5 September 1903, playing at left back away to Stoke City on the opening day of the 1903\u201304 season. In 1906, in the wake of a scandal regarding players' wages, Manchester City were forced into selling most of their players, and Burgess was purchased by Manchester United along with Sandy Turnbull, Jimmy Bannister and Billy Meredith. After helping the club to the 1907\u201308 Football League title, Burgess left the club and moved to Denmark to play for Kristiania. He then emigrated to Hungary, where he played for MTK Budapest, before becoming their manager. In the 1920s, Burgess' managerial career took him to Italy, where he became the manager of Padova. He had a two-year spell at Milan before returning to Padova, but two years later he was on the move again, this time to Roma."]}, {"page": "History of Manchester United F.C.

It paid off, and Manchester United won their first League Championship in 1908. They even attempted to sign Australian rugby footballer, Dally Messenger, a man recognised by some to be the top footballer of any code in his day.

At this time City were suffering the after-effects of a financial scandal in which the club were found guilty of making off-balance sheet payments to players. As a result, seventeen players were suspended and banned from ever representing the club again,Ward, The Manchester City Story, p. 14. including the core of the team which had won the 1904 FA Cup. When the suspensions ended in January 1907, four players (Jimmy Bannister, Herbert Burgess, Billy Meredith and Sandy Turnbull) joined United, where they helped United gain their first league title in 1908. In contrast to modern antipathy, the transfers were generally welcomed for helping a fellow Manchester club.James, Manchester \u2013 A Football History, pp. 117\u20139 The following season Turnbull became the first player to be sent off in a derby.Cawley & James, The Pride of Manchester, p. 41.", "The first transfers of note between the clubs occurred in 1906.

As a consequence, Sam Ormerod resigned as Manchester City manager and was succeeded by Tom Maley. Maley strengthened the team by purchasing Billy Lot Jones, Sandy Turnbull and Jimmy Bannister and they immediately earned promotion back into the first division in the 1902\u201303 football season by winning the Second Division championship.

He was receiving far more of the ball than in the first half and his ability to dribble the ball down the wing was causing problems for the QPR defence. On the 60th minute, Jimmy Bannister passed the ball out to Meredith once again who took the ball on towards Filder, the Rangers left-back. As he approached the defender he shot from outside the area past the QPR keeper to equalise for United. Manchester continued to keep the advantage after this, but the QPR defence was stubborn and Shaw in goal saved three more shots on target.
