In the same year Toogood's 1933 oil, Dan Nancy's, Cushendun was displayed in an exhibition at the Mansion House in Dublin by the Haverty Trust, before becoming one of ten works donated to the Belfast Museum and Art Gallery. In 1936 Toogood showed two paintings at the Royal Hibernian Academy, his only showing with the society. He was also elected a member of ruling council at the Ulster Academy of Arts in 1936, and again in 1944. The critics were still talking of the 1934 exhibition of four years earlier, when the participants were re-united for a show in aid of the Youth Hostel Association, where the reviewer in the Northern Whig remarked,\"Not since Colin Middleton, Edward Mansfield, George MacCann, Romeo Toogood, and other young artists held their first exhibition in Belfast has there been so stimulating a show as that which Lady Cushendun opened yesterday in John Magee's Gallery, Donegall Square West.\"Toogood displayed a painting of Glencoe which the same reviewer refers to as \"one [of] the most interesting in the exhibition, mainly because of its colouring and its naivet\u00e9.\""]}]}}
