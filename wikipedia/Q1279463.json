When Charlie, an FBI math consultant, goes to the FBI office to discuss Phil's arrest, FBI Special Agent Don Eppes (Rob Morrow), Charlie's brother, asks Charlie to link Phil to the kidnappings as Phil and the kidnapping victims belonged to the same Pakistani charity.  While insisting on Phil's innocence, Charlie suggests using social network analysis to find the connection between the victims and their kidnapper.  Don, Fraley, and FBI Special Agents David Sinclair (Alimi Ballard), Colby Granger (Dylan Bruno) and Megan Reeves (Diane Farr) uncover evidence that the kidnapping victims could be planning an RPG attack on a Los Angeles school.  Although Phil asserts that he sent research on DNA modification of crops to Pakistan, Fraley insists that Phil has given terrorists a way to create a bioweapon.
