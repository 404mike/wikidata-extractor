On 19 April 1850 he was gazetted lieutenant-colonel of the 78th foot, and in the Persian war of 1856 and 1857 commanded a brigade in the night attack and battle of Kooshat, and took charge of his own regiment at the bombardment of Mohamrah, after which he received the thanks of the governor-general as well as a medal and clasps. He commanded the advanced guard of Havelock's force at the relief of Lucknow, 25 September 1857, when, upon the death in battle of Brigadier-general James George Smith Neill, he was appointed to command the first brigade. That post he held until the close of the operations, when on 1 January 1858 he was nominated C.B. In that year he served also in Rohilcund and commanded the second brigade at the battle of Bareilly on 7 May."]}, {"page": "Indian Rebellion of 1857", "response": ["Other British accountsJ. W.

At the nearby town of Fatehpur, a mob had attacked and murdered the local British population. On this pretext, Neill ordered all villages beside the Grand Trunk Road to be burned and their inhabitants to be killed by hanging. Neill's methods were \"ruthless and horrible\"Michael Edwardes, Battles of the Indian Mutiny, Pan, 1963  and far from intimidating the population, may well have induced previously undecided sepoys and communities to revolt."]}, {"page": "Nana Saheb Peshwa II", "response": ["The Ganges river was unusually dry at the Satichaura Ghat, and the Europeans found it difficult to drift the boats away. Along the flight of steps going down to the river and also on the high banks on either side of the ghat was filled with people who had assembled in large numbers to see their erstwhile masters leaving. Standing with the throng of people along the banks were also sepoys of 6th Native Infantry from Allahabad and 37th from Benares. Both these battalions had been driven away from their stations by James George Smith Neill column. They were assembled on parade and ordered to lay down their arms and after doing so, were fired upon mercilessly by British troops. Those who were lucky to escape returned to their villages only to hear the brutality of Neills column in sacking entire villages that lay in the path of his march. These soldiers, who had come to Cawnpore to vent their anger with high hopes of participating in the assault on Entrenchment were also watching the proceedings at the Satichaura ghat. Wheeler and his party were the first aboard and the first to manage to set their boat adrift. At this point a shot was fired possibly from the high banks and the Indian boatmen jumped overboard and started swimming toward the banks. During their jump, some of the cooking fires were knocked off, setting some of the boats ablaze. Though controversy surrounds what exactly happened next at the Satichaura Ghat, and it is unknown who fired the first shot, the departing European were attacked by the rebel sepoys, and most either killed or captured."]}, {"page": "George Harris, 3rd Baron Harris", "response": ["When the Indian Rebellion of 1857 broke out, the province of Madras remained loyal to the British Crown. As a result, Harris lent the whole Madras Army to the Government of India for quelling the rebellion. The Madras Army participated in the relief of Cawnpore in which Lieutenant-Colonel James George Smith Neill of the Madras Fusiliers indulged in indiscriminate massacre of Indians and was eventually killed. However, there is also evidence that suggests that one of the 52 regiments of the Madras Army refused to volunteer for service during the mutiny."]}, {"page": "Neill", "response": ["* James George Smith Neill (1810-1857), British army general"]}, {"page": "List of islands named after people", "response": ["|Neil Island || India ||James George Smith Neill"]}, {"page": "Royal Warrant of Precedence", "response": ["|James George Smith Neill (KCB)"]}, {"page": "General Smith", "response": ["*James George Smith Neill (1810\u20131857), British Army brigadier general"]}, {"page": "Neil Statue Satyagraha", "response": ["thumb|James George Smith Neill (26 May 1810 \u2013 25 September 1857)"]}, {"page": "James Neill", "response": ["* James George Smith Neill (1810\u20131857), Scottish military officer of the East India Company"]}]}}
