The pivotal play, Grant Haley's blocked field goal return in the 4th quarter, was voted as the best Penn State play of the century. The game's aftermath included fans storming the field at Beaver Stadium and celebratory riots in downtown State College. Their White Out rematch two years later, a 27\u201326 loss, would break the Beaver Stadium attendance record, edging out the previous record (the 2017 White Out against Michigan, a 42\u201313 victory) by less than 70 attendees."]}]}}
