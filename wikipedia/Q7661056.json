David Marchese from Vulture wrote that, \"regardless of the lyricist, whether it was Scott (who was capable of real wit and colour), Johnson, or the Young brothers, there's a deep strain of misogyny in the band's output that veers from feeling terribly dated to straight-up reprehensible.\" According to Christgau in 1988, \"the brutal truth is that sexism has never kept a great rock-and-roller down\u2014from Muddy to Lemmy, lots of dynamite music has objectified women in objectionable ways. But rotely is not among those ways\", in regards to AC/DC. Fans of the band have defended their music by highlighting its \"bawdy humour\", while members of the group have generally been dismissive of claims that their songs are sexist, arguing that they are meant to be in jest. In an interview with Sylvie Simmons for Mojo, Angus called the band \"pranksters more than anything else\", while Malcolm said \"we're not like some macho band. We take the music far more seriously than we take the lyrics, which are just throwaway lines.\" Marchese regarded the musical aspect of the Youngs' songs \"strong enough to render the words a functional afterthought\", as well as \"deceptively plain, devastatingly effective, and extremely lucrative\"."]}, {"page": "The Master and Margarita", "response": ["* Mick Jagger of The Rolling Stones was inspired by the novel in writing the song \"Sympathy for the Devil\". Will Self's foreword to the Vintage edition of the Michael Glenny translation of the novel suggests the same, and Jagger's then girlfriend Marianne Faithfull confirmed it in an interview with Sylvie Simmons from the magazine Mojo in 2005.

The working title of the song was \"The Devil Is My Name\", having earlier been called \"Fallen Angels\". Jagger sings in first person narrative as the Devil, who boasts his role in each of several historical atrocities and repeatedly asks the listener to \"guess my name.\" The singer then ironically demands the listener's courtesy towards him, implicitly chastising the listeners for their collective culpability in the listed killings and crimes. In the 2012 documentary Crossfire Hurricane, Jagger stated that his influence for the song came from Baudelaire and from the Russian author Mikhail Bulgakov's novel The Master and Margarita (which had just appeared in English translation in 1967). The book was given to Jagger by Marianne Faithfull and she confirmed the inspiration in an interview with Sylvie Simmons from the magazine Mojo in 2005."]}, {"page": "Creem", "response": ["Publishers, editors and writers for Creem included  Barry Kramer, his partner (later his wife) Connie Warren Kramer, Lester Bangs, Dave Marsh, Billy Altman, Bob Fleck, John Morthland, Ben Edmonds, Ed Ward, Richard Riegel, Ric Siegel, Robert Christgau, Richard Meltzer, Nick Tosches, Greil Marcus, Jeffrey Morgan, Richard C.
