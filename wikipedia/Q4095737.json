The verses of the Yoga Sutras are terse. Many later Indian scholars studied them and published their commentaries, such as the Vyasa Bhashya (c. 350\u2013450 CE). Patanjali defines the word \"yoga\" in his second sutra, and his terse definition hinges on the meaning of three Sanskrit terms. I. K. Taimni translates it as \"Yoga is the inhibition () of the modifications () of the mind ()\". Swami Vivekananda translates the sutra as \"Yoga is restraining the mind-stuff (Citta) from taking various forms (Vrittis).\" Edwin Bryant writes that to Patanjali, \"Yoga essentially consists of meditative practices culminating in attaining a state of consciousness free from all modes of active or discursive thought, and of eventually attaining a state where consciousness is unaware of any object external to itself, that is, is only aware of its own nature as consciousness unmixed with any other object.\"Edwin Bryant (2011, Rutgers University), The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali IEP"]}, {"page": "Krishna", "response": ["The Chandogya Upanishad, estimated to have been composed sometime between the 8th and 6thcenturiesBCE, has been another source of speculation regarding Krishna in ancient India. The verse (III.xvii.6) mentions Krishna in Krishnaya Devakiputraya as a student of the sage Ghor' of the Angirasa family. Ghora is identified with Neminatha, the twenty-second tirthankara in Jainism, by some scholars. This phrase, which means \"To Krishna the son of Devaki\", has been mentioned by scholars such as Max M\u00fcllerMax M\u00fcller, Chandogya Upanishad 3.16\u20133.17, The Upanishads, PartI, Oxford University Press, pp. 50\u201353 with footnotes as a potential source of fables and Vedic lore about Krishna in the Mahabharata and other ancient literature only potential because this verse could have been interpolated into the text, or the Krishna Devakiputra, could be different from the deity Krishna.Edwin Bryant and Maria Ekstrand (2004), The Hare Krishna Movement, Columbia University Press, , pp. 33\u201334 with note 3 These doubts are supported by the fact that the much later age Sandilya Bhakti Sutras, a treatise on Krishna,Sandilya Bhakti Sutra SS Rishi (Translator), Sree Gaudia Math (Madras) cites later age compilations such as the Narayana Upanishad but never cites this verse of the Chandogya Upanishad. Other scholars disagree that the Krishna mentioned along with Devaki in the ancient Upanishad is unrelated to the later Hindu god of the Bhagavad Gita fame. For example, Archer states that the coincidence of the two names appearing together in the same Upanishad verse cannot be dismissed easily.WG Archer (2004), The Loves of Krishna in Indian Painting and Poetry, Dover, , p. 5", "Megasthenes, a Greek ethnographer and an ambassador of Seleucus I to the court of Chandragupta Maurya towards the end of 4thcenturyBCE, made reference to Herakles in his famous work Indica. This text is now lost to history, but was quoted in secondary literature by later Greeks such as Arrian, Diodorus, and Strabo. According to these texts, Megasthenes mentioned that the Sourasenoi tribe of India, who worshipped Herakles, had two major cities named Methora and Kleisobora, and a navigable river named the Jobares. According to Edwin Bryant, a professor of Indian religions known for his publications on Krishna, \"there is little doubt that the Sourasenoi refers to the Shurasenas, a branch of the Yadu dynasty to which Krishna belonged\". The word Herakles, states Bryant, is likely a Greek phonetic equivalent of Hari-Krishna, as is Methora of Mathura, Kleisobora of Krishnapura, and the Jobares of Jamuna. Later, when Alexander the Great launched his campaign in the northwest Indian subcontinent, his associates recalled that the soldiers of Porus were carrying an image of Herakles.
