He wrote a biography of fellow artist George Morland.\nHassell first appeared as an exhibitor at the Royal Academy, in London, in 1789 with a 'View of Stonehenge on Salisbury Plain.' He drew many views of local scenery, which he engraved himself in aquatint, most of them coloured. They were published in various topographical works. He had a large practice as a  drawing-master, and published some books on water-colour painting and drawing. Hassell was a friend of George Morland and wrote his biography (published in 1800); he also engraved Morland's drawing of 'Conway Castle' in aquatint.\nHis son Edward Hassell (d. 1852) was also a watercolourist, and exhibited for a number of years at the Society of British Artists, of which he became a member in 1841, and was also secretary. He occasionally exhibited at the Royal Academy and British Institution.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "David Cox (artist)", "response": ["Cox's reputation as both a painter and a teacher had been building over previous years, as indicated by his election as a member of the Society of Painters in Water Colours and his inclusion in John Hassell's 1813 book Aqua Pictura, which claimed to present works by \"all of the most approved water coloured draftsmen\". The depression that accompanied the end of the Napoleonic Wars had caused a contraction in the art market, however, and by 1814 Cox had been very short of money, requiring a loan from one of his pupils to pay even for the move to Hereford. Despite its financial advantages and its proximity to the scenery of North Wales and the Wye Valley, the move to Hereford marked a retreat in terms of his career as a painter: he sent few works to the annual exhibition of the Society of Painters in Water Colours during his first years away from London and not until 1823 would he again contribute more than 20 pictures."]}, {"page": "John Hassell (artist)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Hassell"]}, {"page": "Edward Williams (engraver)", "response": ["Williams became friends with the brothers William Ward and James Ward, both engravers who had apprenticed under Smith, and he had at least two children born out of wedlock with their 18-year-old sister Mary Ward (1764-1832), before finally marrying her in 1788, some six years after the fact.  This marriage made Williams a brother-in-law as well to the animal painter George Morland, and Morland's biographer John Hassell (1806) tells us that Williams and Morland were in fact drinking companions.Hassell (1808), p. 44-45.

As part of his business he ran a circulating library, established in 1764 and by the 1800s one of \"the two largest in London.\" The library continued on Bond Street until it was acquired by Mudie's ca.1871.
