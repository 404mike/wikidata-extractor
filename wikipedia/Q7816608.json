He was one of the outstanding wicket-keepers of the 19th century.\nTom Lockyer was a right-handed batsman.  As well as keeping wicket, he also bowled right-arm fast-medium, roundarm, particularly in his final years with Surrey.  \nHis first-class career extended from the 1849 English cricket season to the 1866 season.  He took 301 catches in 223 matches and made 123 stumpings.  As a bowler he took 119 wickets at an average of 19.73 with a best analysis of 6/33.  He took five wickets in an innings 10 times, and 10 wickets in a match once.  He scored 4917 runs at an average of 15.86 with a highest score of 108 not out, which was his only century, against Nottinghamshire in 1864, when he also took 6 for 44 in the second innings after keeping wicket in the first.At the end of the 1859 English cricket season, Lockyer was one of the 12 players who took part in cricket's first-ever overseas tour when an English cricket team led by George Parr visited North America. He was also a member of Parr's team that toured Australia and New Zealand in 1863\u201364.During this trip the team sailed on the SS Great Britain.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1852 in sports", "response": ["* The United All England Eleven (UEE) is established as a rival to William Clarke's All-England Eleven (AEE).

Once discovered, however, Emmett climbed almost immediately to the top of the cricketing tree, playing for England against Surrey & Sussex in Tom Lockyer's benefit match at the Oval in 1867, his second season. An even greater bowler, George Freeman, was approaching his best at the same time, and, from 1867 to the end of 1871, they dominated the English bowling scene. After 1871, however, business commitments took Freeman away from first-class cricket, but Emmett stayed on and found another able colleague in the excellent Allen Hill. In later years, Emmett shared the Yorkshire bowling duties with George Ulyett, Billy Bates, Ted Peate and Bobby Peel. He called his most famous delivery the \"sostenuter\": after pitching on leg the ball would break back a long way to take the off-stump. As time went on, Emmett's pace deserted him."]}, {"page": "Fred Lillywhite", "response": ["The touring party of 1859 left Liverpool on the SS Nova Scotian on 7 September and returned on 11 November.
