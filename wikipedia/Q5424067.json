Bateson emphasized in 1966 the poem's ability to capture truth: \"The Ode to a Nightingale had ended with the explicit admission that the 'fancy' is a 'cheat,' and the Grecian Urn concludes with a similar repudiation. But this time it is a positive instead of a negative conclusion. There is no escape from the 'woe' that 'shall this generation waste,' but the action of time can be confronted and seen in its proper proportions. To enable its readers to do this is the special function of poetry.\"Bateson 1968 p. 108 Ronald Sharp followed in 1979 with a claim that the theme of \"the relationship between life and art\u00a0... receives its most famous, and its most enigmatic and controversial, treatment\" within the poem.Sharp 1979 p. 151 In 1983, Vendler praised many of the passages within the poem but argued that the poem was unable to fully represent what Keats wanted: \"The simple movement of entrance and exit, even in its triple repetition in the Urn, is simply not structurally complex enough to be adequate, as a representational form, to what we know of aesthetic experience \u2013 or indeed to human experience generally.\"Vendler 1983 p. 152 Later in 1989, Daniel Watkins claimed the poem as \"one of [Keats's] most beautiful and problematic works.\"Watkins 1989 p. 105"]}, {"page": "Brunette Coleman", "response": ["Motion argues that aside from the sometimes facetious tone, the opinions expressed by Larkin in his Coleman persona, particularly the mild xenophobia that enters the essay, foreshadow his own mature prejudices.

His only other comment on the poem occurs in his essay 'English Literature' in the volume University Studies: Cambridge 1933,Wright, Harold, ed., University Studies: Cambridge 1933 (London, 1933), p.272 where he contested I. A. Richards' view of it in Science and Poetry (1926): \"The Waste Land is praised [by Richards] for its 'complete severence' from all beliefs, when it is really a yearning cry for them, and at its close some sort of faith is so clearly impending that it has been praised by others as a great religious poem (such are the triumphs of obscurity).\" The Letters of T. S. Eliot Eliot, Valerie: Haughton, Hugh: Haffenden, John; eds., The Letters of T. S. Eliot (London 2012, 2013), vols. 3&4 includes correspondence between Eliot and Lucas from the mid-1920s but no reference to the review. Historians of The New Statesman have regretted that Desmond MacCarthy invited Lucas to review modern poetry, one of them declaring Lucas \"a disastrous choice\" for a Waste Land review.Smith, Adrian,  'The New Statesman': Portrait of a Political Weekly, 1913-1931 (London 1996), p.206 (Disastrous, that is, for the journal's avant-garde image.) After 1923, though attacking obscurantism in general terms, Lucas largely ignored Eliot's poetry, aside from a retrospective dig in 1942 at 'The Hollow Men' (\"hollow men whimpering under prickly pear trees, conceited still amid their grovellings because a prickly pear remains an exotic and highly intellectual plant\" Lucas, F. L., Critical Thoughts in Critical Days (London, 1942), p.45) and at 'Sweeney among the Nightingales' (\"the nightingales of Aeschylus now exhibit to a ravished public their 'droppings'; for to the sewer all things are sewer\" ).
