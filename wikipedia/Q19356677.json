However in a match against Plymouth Argyle on 22 August 2015, Lelan received a red card for a second bookable offence, having been booked twice within the last two minutes of the game, as Northampton Town lost 2\u20130. In a match against Dagenham & Redbridge, he was at fault for the conceding the first goal of the game, as the club lost 2\u20131.
