He was the first Englishman to score a hat-trick against Wales in an international, with goals in the 16th, 70th and 90th minutes of their 1883 clash at Kennington Oval. A centre-forward, he also scored a goal in a loss to Scotland a month later and in a 1\u20131 draw with Wales at the 1885 British Home Championship.Mitchell had been a dominant batsman at school and played club cricket for Crystal Palace Cricket Club. In club cricket he scored double centuries and between 1890 and 1892 made eight first-class cricket appearances as a left-handed batsman for Kent. He had less success at county cricket level, scoring 126 runs at a batting average of less than 10 runs per innings.Mitchell died at Aldrington in Sussex in 1937 aged 75.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1882\u201383 in English football", "response": ["|Charles Bambridge (Swifts) (43 mins), Clement Mitchell (Upton Park) (16, 70 & 90 mins) & Arthur Cursham (Notts County) (65 mins)", "|Clement Mitchell (Upton Park) (24 mins) & William Cobbold (Cambridge University) (43 mins) "]}, {"page": "1884\u201385 in English football", "response": ["|Clement Mitchell (Upton Park) (35 mins)"]}, {"page": "1860s in association football", "response": ["* 20 February \u2013 Clement Mitchell (d. 1937), England international in five matches (1880\u20131885), scoring five goals."]}, {"page": "Upton Park F.C.", "response": ["Famous players for the side included Charles Alcock, later president of the Football Association, FA Cup Final referees Alfred Stair and Segar Bastard (who was also an England international), and Charlie Dove, one of the early leading players for Thames Ironworks.
