Wolpert was best known for his French flag model of embryonic development, where he used the French flag as a visual aid to explain how embryonic cells interpret genetic code for expressing characteristics of living organisms and explaining how signalling between cells early in morphogenesis could be used to inform cells with the same genetic regulatory network of their position and role. \nHe was also an author of several science books including Triumph of the Embryo (1991), Malignant Sadness (1999), The Evolutionary Origins of Belief (2006), and How We Live And Why We Die: The Secret Lives of Cells (2009).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of South Africans", "response": ["*Lewis Wolpert, author, biologist, broadcaster (1929\u20132021)"]}, {"page": "October 19", "response": ["*1929 \u2013 Lewis Wolpert, South African-English biologist, author, and academic (d. 2021)"]}, {"page": "List of biologists", "response": ["*Lewis Wolpert (1929\u20132021), South-African-British developmental biologist known for the French flag model of embryonic development"]}, {"page": "Frederick Sanger", "response": ["*.

This model was championed by the leading Drosophila biologist, Peter Lawrence. Christiane N\u00fcsslein-Volhard was the first to identify a morphogen, Bicoid, one of the transcription factors present in a gradient in the Drosophila syncitial embryo. She was awarded the 1995 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine for her work explaining the morphogenic embryology of the common fruit fly.

Its supporters make only selective reference to the overwhelming scientific evidence that supports evolution, and treat gaps in current knowledge which, as in all areas of science, certainly exist - as if they were evidence for a 'designer'.
