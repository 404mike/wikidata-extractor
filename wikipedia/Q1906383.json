She is the subject of Melvyn Bragg's 1987 novel The Maid of Buttermere, which was adapted into a play by Lisa Evans and  premiered at Keswick's Theatre by the Lake in 2009.She was a shepherdess and the daughter of the landlord of the Fish Inn in the village of Buttermere in England's Lake District.  She was married bigamously in 1802 to John Hatfield (c.1758\u20131803), who presented himself as \"Colonel Hope\".  The marriage of the celebrated local beauty to the brother of an earl (as he claimed) was widely reported, and Samuel Taylor Coleridge wrote in the London Morning Post of \"The romantic marriage\".  Hatfield was exposed as an impostor, bigamist and forger, was arrested, escaped, was captured in South Wales, and was tried at Carlisle for forgery and hanged in 1803.  Mary's story captured the public imagination, and subscriptions were raised on her behalf.  She married a local farmer Richard Harrison in 1807 and had four children.  Her death was mentioned in The Annual Register and she is buried in the churchyard at St Kentigern's Church at Caldbeck (St. Kentigern is also known as St. Mungo).\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1837 in literature", "response": ["*February 7 \u2013 Mary Robinson (Maid of Buttermere), English literary muse (born 1778)"]}, {"page": "1778 in literature", "response": ["*unknown date \u2013 Mary Robinson (Maid of Buttermere), English literary muse (died 1837)"]}, {"page": "Melvyn Bragg", "response": ["* The Maid of Buttermere (1987) (based on the life of Mary Robinson)"]}, {"page": "Buttermere", "response": ["Mary Robinson (1778\u20131837), known as the \"Maid of Buttermere\" and the subject of Melvyn Bragg's novel of that name, was the daughter of the landlord of the Fish Inn in Buttermere village."]}, {"page": "History of Cumbria", "response": ["The early tourists (who came to the Lakes from around 1760 onwards) were pulled towards the Lake District because of their interest in antiquity, aesthetics, and science as expressed in the writings of Hutchinson, Gray, West, Gilpin and so on (a \"counterpoint of curiosity with connoisseurship and of imagination with the senses.\") But after around 1790, Nicholson argues, these motives became degraded to ones where \"the curiosity of the scientist becomes a mere itch for oddities; the artist's careful assessment of the landscape in terms of visual beauty and design becomes a mere taste for prettiness...\" The search for thrills by people who were no longer \"explorers\", but \"holiday-makers\", took overNicholson (1995), p. 59.thumb|The Fish Hotel, Buttermere \u2013 where Mary Robinson worked", "The writings and paintings of artists added to the desire of people to view the location of their art, and vivid stories such as the one about Mary Robinson, with its Picturesque overtones of a Primitive culture being corrupted by the evil ways of city-based civilisation, caused tourists to flock to Buttermere.Thompson (2010), pp. [135]-149.Nicholson (1995), pp. 59\u201366.

He spent his time in excursions, and on a visit to Grasmere became acquainted with a Liverpool gentleman named Crump, whose name and credit he then employed when in want of money. By franking letters in his assumed name he silenced suspicion. An intrigue with a lady of fortune came to nothing. But the reputation of Mary Robinson, the \"Buttermere Beauty\", led him to visit the Fish Inn, Buttermere, where her father was landlord. She was sufficiently well known to be mentioned in a guide book of 1792, by Joseph Palmer.bbc.co.uk, Putting beauty on the map: A new breed of tourist. Finding that Mary's family had some means, Hatfield married her at Lorton Church on 2 October 1802.", "Hatfield was taken at a village sixteen miles from Swansea soon after. His trial took place at Carlisle on 15 August 1803. To three indictments for forgery Hatfield pleaded not guilty. But the charges were fully proved. He was sentenced to be hanged, and met his death coolly, on Saturday, 13 September. Mary Robinson and her false lover were the subject at the time of novels, verses, dramas, and tales. At the time, Samuel Taylor Coleridge gave wide publicity to the elopement of John and Mary, in five articles for The Morning Post. Coleridge also visited Hatfield as a condemned man, while travelling through Carlisle with Dorothy Wordsworth and William Wordsworth."]}]}}
