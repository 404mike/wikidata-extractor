Daer was a right-handed batsman who bowled right-arm medium pace.  He was born in Hammersmith, London.\nDaer made his first-class debut for Essex against Worcestershire in the 1938 County Championship.  He played 7 further first-class fixtures in that season, playing one more first-class fixture in the following against Yorkshire at Bramall Lane, Sheffield.  Daer very much adhered to the stereotype of a tailender, scoring just 60 runs in his 9 matches at a batting average of 6.66 and a high score of 17.  More successful with the ball, Daer took 11 wickets at a bowling average of 35.18, with best figures of 3/21.\nDuring World War II, Daer is mentioned in the London Gazette in January 1942 as a 2nd Lieutenant in the Royal Army Service Corps.  He died in Plymouth, Devon on 19 December 1980.  Daer had survived his brother, Arthur, by five months.  He too played first-class cricket, having a more successful career at the highest domestic level.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Daer", "response": ["* Harry Daer (1918\u20131980), cricketer"]}]}}
