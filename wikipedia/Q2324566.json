The young team managed by Matt Busby had been dubbed \"the Busby Babes\" in the media, with football left in mourning as the plane carrying United back from a European Cup quarter-final against Red Star Belgrade crashed having stopped to refuel in Munich, killing 23 people. Busby himself had suffered life-threatening injuries, but he was determined to carry on and rebuild his team, even taking them to the FA Cup final that season. Eventually United somehow recovered, winning the FA Cup in 1963 and then the league title in 1965 and 1967, before Busby's greatest ever achievement of leading them to the European Cup in 1968, 10 years after the deaths of talented, largely young players Duncan Edwards (21), Geoff Bent (25), Roger Byrne (28), Eddie Colman (21), Mark Jones (24), David Pegg (22), Tommy Taylor (26) and Liam \"Billy\" Whelan (22).
