His spatial awareness had often been questioned by his England hockey team mates - who were not surprised when they heard of his accident.\nWilliams fell onto the rocks below in a little cove where the tide was coming in. Thankfully his blackberry was still working though - and even though he had broken many Ribes, collar bone etc, he was able to call for help and was rescued.A friendly crab talked to him whilst waiting for the air ambulance. The crab later featured in an episode of midsummer murders.\nWilliams now focuses on his average golf game. Luckily his wife loves him very much and plays with him*, even though unusually often seen entering cow fields in a shark cage.\nWilliams children are surprisingly good looking, sporty, and with a high emotional EQ.\n\ngolf", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Great Britain at the 1992 Summer Olympics", "response": ["|rowspan=\"5\"|From:( 1.)
