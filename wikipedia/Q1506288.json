Often wearing a full-length mink coat and pink pedal pusher slacks, she would drive throughout Los Angeles in a pink Cadillac convertible with its top down and the front and back seats filled with pink poodle lamps and real pink-dyed poodles in the front seat. Not only did the residents of L.A. take note of Morris and her colorful marketing technique, but famed newspaper columnist Walter Winchell eventually wrote \"Who's the wise guy that said 'beauty and business don't mix?' Meet striking blonde Phyllis Morris. She's been setting this nation's furniture styling for ten years.\"Walter Winchell, Los Angeles Herald-Examiner, June 23, 1964", "thumb|left|Pop goes the Sixties!

And so impressive were Morris' parties at both her Beverly Hills home and her Los Angeles showroom that Town & Country magazine wrote \"Certainly this was THE top party of the holiday season,\" Town & Country, February 1967 referring to a 1966 soiree at Morris' 17-room manse. Many Hollywood film fans would have relished being at the Morris showroom in 1970 when Joan Crawford stopped in to look for artwork for her home. Morris offered the screen legend a Coca-Cola. The following day, 20 cases of Pepsi-Cola arrived at the Phyllis Morris showroom with a note from Crawford saying \"Pour all those Cokes down the drain.\"", "thumb|left|The lacquered Palm Leaf Bed with its soaring mirrored headboard was introduced by Phyllis Morris in the early 1980s", "thumb|right|Phyllis Morris in her Beverly Boulevard showroom in the early 1970s surrounded by a colorful array of furnishings including a large portrait by Margaret Keane whom Morris befriended in the early 1960s", "Such was Morris' reputation for producing lavish and expensive beds that People magazine ran a feature story on her in 1978, noting such clients as Gladys Knight, Allan Carr, Cher and even Who drummer Keith Moon (for whom Morris outfitted a Malibu, California beach house). \"I knew I had to make something that no one else could build cheaper,\" said Morris about her beds. \"In Vegas, I've done beds in gold with gold inlays.\"People magazine, April 17, 1978 Among the interiors and furnishings Morris created for film producer Allan Carr (Grease; Grease 2) was a glittering Egyptian-themed subterranean disco in his Beverly Hills house where actors John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John danced the night away for the paparazzi.

The company has been headed by Morris' daughter Jamie Adler who runs the business along with her husband John Adler and her father Nathan Goller. With the move to Robertson Boulevard, the company added two divisions: Circa Furniture which offers a contemporary collection of furniture; and 655 Home, a luxury home accessories boutique created by Adler as well.
