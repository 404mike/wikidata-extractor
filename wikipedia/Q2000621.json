Journal of Database marketing & Customer Strategy Management. London: Apr 2007. Vol. 14, Iss. 3; p. 161, 3 pages In response to the accusation that he unfairly claims to be using NLP whenever he performs, he wrote, \"The truth is I have never mentioned it outside of my book.\" He does have an off-stage curiosity about the system, and discusses it in the larger context of hypnotism and suggestion. In his book Tricks of the Mind, he mentions that he attended an NLP course with Richard Bandler, co-creator of NLP and mentor of Paul McKenna. He also describes the NLP concept of eye accessing cues as a technique of \"limited use\" in his book Pure Effect. The language patterns which he uses to suggest behaviours are very similar in style to those used by Richard Bandler and by the hypnotist from whom Bandler learnt his skill, Milton H. Erickson. Brown also mentions in Tricks of the Mind that NLP students were given a certificate after a four-day course, certifying them to practise NLP as a therapist. A year after Brown attended the class, he received a number of letters saying that he would receive another certificate, not for passing a test (as he discontinued practising NLP following the course), but for keeping in touch. After ignoring their request, he later received the new certificate for NLP in his mailbox, unsolicited.Derren Brown, Tricks of the Mind, Transworld Publishers, 2006,  Part Four: Hypnosis and Suggestibility, Section Neuro Linguistic Programming, Sub section: The eyes have it (some of the time)"]}, {"page": "Carlton Television", "response": ["* The Hypnotic World of Paul McKenna (1993\u201397)"]}, {"page": "Capital London", "response": ["*Paul McKenna"]}, {"page": "Charlotte Rampling", "response": ["That same year, Rampling backed children's fairytales app, GivingTales, in aid of UNICEF together with Roger Moore, Stephen Fry, Ewan McGregor, Joan Collins, Joanna Lumley, Michael Caine, David Walliams, Paul McKenna and Michael Ball."]}, {"page": "GamesMaster", "response": ["*Episode 15 \u2013 Paul McKenna \u2013 6 February 1997 "]}, {"page": "David Walliams", "response": ["In September 2015 he released Grandpa's Great Escape.
