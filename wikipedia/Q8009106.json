William was the son of William Fitz Allan, controlling the castles of Clun and Oswestry and later became the High Sheriff of Shropshire. William married a daughter of Hugh de Lacy, of which no first name is mentioned in any record known.  When William came to inherit his lands in 1210, King John demanded a fee of 10,000 marks; unable to pay, William was unable to inherit. He only outlived his father by a few years, dying around Easter 1215. The estates were eventually reclaimed by his younger brother John Fitzalan.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "House of Stuart", "response": ["**** William Fitz Alan, 2nd Lord of Oswestry and Clun"]}, {"page": "John Fitzalan (died 1240)", "response": ["John succeeded his brother, William Fitz Alan, 2nd Lord of Oswestry and Clun, who died in 1215 without issue.
