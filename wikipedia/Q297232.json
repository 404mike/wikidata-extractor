In 2009, Trent Reznor composed \"Theme for Tetsuo\" for the Japanese cyberpunk film Tetsuo: The Bullet Man from Shinya Tsukamoto."]}, {"page": "Nothing Records", "response": ["In the wake of the RCA shake-up, Pop Will Eat Itself moved to Infectious Records in the UK. A call between PWEI and Nine Inch Nails management would lead to Nothing Records picking up licensing rights for the band in the United States. Former frontman Clint Mansell (who shared songwriting and vocal duties with Graham Crabb) recalled:", "PWEI toured to promote the album and enjoyed a raised profile in the States, but at the end of touring, the band found themselves struggling to continue as a creative force.  Work did begin on an untitled follow-up to Dos Dedos Mis Amigos, with the band entering the studio in 1996. Their sixth studio album, which had been intended for Stateside release via Nothing, would not see release before the band broke up, however. Member Graham Crabb quit the band to focus on his ambient  project Golden Claw Musics. Members Richard March and Robert \"Fuzz\" Townshend went on to form the big beat band Bentley Rhythm Ace. Townshend also released two solo albums, while Clint Mansell would end up signing onto Nothing Records as a solo artist.  Mansell stated:", "Clint Mansell's time as a solo artist for the label would be short-lived, as his career as a film composer blossomed. While Mansell would appear on numerous releases for the label as a remixer and collaborator, as well as an appearance in 1996 on the label's \"Nights Of Nothing\" label showcase, performing with Nine Inch Nails (which included performances of some Pop Will Eat Itself songs), his planned solo album for Nothing was ultimately scrapped. Only two demos from Mansell's solo album ever surfaced. The songs \"Atlantic Crossing\" and \"The Mechanic\" found their way online, by way of Clint Mansell and Nothing Records' official websites (both since defunct). Mansell also put together a streaming mix for \"Radio Nothing\" on the Nothing Records website, which included \"The Mechanic\", alongside other tracks from the label. After Mansell's successful work composing the film \u03c0, he went on to become a full-time film composer, on such films as Requiem for a Dream, Doom (the soundtrack to which featured an exclusive Mansell remix of Nine Inch Nails' track \"You Know What You Are\"),  The Fountain, The Wrestler, Moon, and Black Swan.", "In January 2005, Pop Will Eat Itself reunited for a brief series of shows in the UK, which produced a number of Instant Live albums, whereby ten minutes after the completion of each gig, double live albums of the performance could be purchased. The band also released a preview of newly recorded material (not to be confused with their then-unreleased 1996 material), under the working title of Sonic Noise Byte in November 2005, via their official website, pweination. However, an announcement on the official website in March 2006 confirmed that Mansell and March would no longer be involved in the reformation of the band, due to other work commitments, effectively ending that conception of the PWEI reformation. However, the remaining band members continued as Vileevils, performing live, releasing re-recorded versions of several tracks from the Sonic Noise Byte sessions and releasing two EPs; Demon / Axe Of Men 2010 and Demon / Axe Of Men 2010 Remixes, both of which were credited as featuring Clint Mansell and Pop Will Eat Itself.", "Meat Beat Manifesto would support Subliminal Sandwich with extensive touring across the United States and Europe, featuring a line-up of Jack Dangers, John Wilson on guitar, Lynn Farmer on drums and Mike Powell on samples and keys. In 1996, the band took part in the \"Nights Of Nothing\" label showcase, which featured label-mates Marilyn Manson and Nine Inch Nails, with the latter's line-up including Clint Mansell of Pop Will Eat Itself and Kevin McMahon from Prick.", "During the summer of 1997, the band recorded an album's worth of material in their basement studio, with Atticus's brother Leopold Ross splitting guitar duties with keyboardist / guitarist Mark De Lane Lea, as well as Stanley Adler on cello. Trent Reznor would hear this material and offer them a deal with Nothing Records.  However, 12 Rounds was courted by numerous other labels as well.  Claudia stated, \"We were shocked by the influx of offers, but Nothing was so right for us because it's so artist-led.  It's really the difference between feeling like a handmade Bristol and being on a Ford conveyor belt.\" Their sophomore album, My Big Hero, featured eight new tracks, alongside two songs from Jitter Juice; \"Something's Burning\" and \"Pleasant Smell\" (though both would have minor differences from their original versions).  Pleasant Smell was released as a single on Nothing ahead of the album on June 9, 1998, featuring remixes from Trent Reznor, Charlie Clouser and Keith Hillebrandt of Nine Inch Nails, as well as Nothing Records label-mate Clint Mansell.  A music video was also released for \"Pleasant Smell.\"  The single was followed by the release of My Big Hero on July 14, 1998.  The band then went on their first tours of the United States, with Kirk Hellie joining the band to take over guitar duties.  They took opening slots for VAST and Nothing Records label-mates Marilyn Manson, as part of the first leg of their Mechanical Animals tour.", "In 2004, Atticus joined his brother Leopold Ross in forming the noise rock band Error, though it would be short-lived, with a one-off E.P. being released on Epitaph Records.  Atticus also made contributions to another of Leopold's rock bands, Nojahoda, although that project would also be short-lived.  Atticus began to deepen his musical collaboration with Trent Reznor, beginning with the Nine Inch Nails album With Teeth in 2005.  Meanwhile, Claudia Sarne would collaborate with Nothing label-mate Clint Mansell, to provide vocals to the main theme to the film The Hole in 2001.  She later joined former Nine Inch Nails member Jerome Dillon's band nearLY in 2006.  After the completion nearLY's debut album Reminder, the band played a handful of select live performances.  These performances were recorded as a live CD/DVD, entitled Reminder Live, which was self-released by the band.  It included a performance of \"Chicane,\" one of the songs from 12 Rounds' unreleased third album.  After the release of Reminder Live, Claudia announced her departure from nearLY, with the band as a whole quietly dissolving shortly after."]}, {"page": "1998 in film", "response": ["| Pi || Artisan Entertainment / Protozoa Pictures || Darren Aronofsky (director/screenplay); Sean Gullette, Mark Margolis, Ben Shenkman, Samia Shoaib, Ajay Naidu, Pamela Hart, Stephen Pearlman, Kristyn Mae-Anne Lao, Lauren Fox, Clint Mansell || Thriller || Live action"]}, {"page": "Darren Aronofsky", "response": ["Aronofsky followed his debut with Requiem for a Dream, a film based on Hubert Selby Jr.'s novel of the same name. He was paid $50,000, and worked for three years with nearly the same production team as his previous film. Following the financial breakout of Pi, he was capable of hiring established actors, including Ellen Burstyn and Jared Leto, and received a budget of $3,500,000 to produce the film. Production of the film occurred over the period of one year, with the film being released in October 2000. The film went on to gross $7,390,108 worldwide. Aronofsky received acclaim for his stylish direction, and was nominated for another Independent Spirit Award, this time for Best Director. The film itself was nominated for five awards in total, winning two, for Best Actress and Cinematography. Clint Mansell's soundtrack for the film was also well-regarded, and since their first collaboration in 1996, Mansell has composed the music to every Aronofsky film, (except for Mother!, 2017). Ellen Burstyn was nominated for numerous awards, including for an Academy Award for Best Actress, and won the Independent Spirit Award. Aronofsky was awarded the PRISM Award from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation with the National Institute on Drug Abuse for the film's depiction of drug abuse.", "With The Fountain, Aronofsky restricted the use of computer-generated imagery. Henrik Fett, the visual effects supervisor of Look Effects, said, \"Darren was quite clear on what he wanted and his intent to greatly minimize the use of computer graphics\u00a0... and I think the results are outstanding.\" He used more subtle directing in The Wrestler and Black Swan, in which a less-visceral directing style better showcases the acting and narratives. Aronofsky filmed both works with a muted palette and a grainy style. Part of this consistent style involves collaborations with frequent partners cinematographer Matthew Libatique, editor Andrew Weisblum and composer Clint Mansell. Mansell's music is often an important element of the films."]}, {"page": "Film score", "response": ["Further examples include Bernard Herrmann with Alfred Hitchcock; Jerry Goldsmith with Joe Dante and Franklin Schaffner; Ennio Morricone with Sergio Leone; Mauro Bolognini with Giuseppe Tornatore; Alan Silvestri with Robert Zemeckis; Angelo Badalamenti with David Lynch; James Newton Howard with M.
