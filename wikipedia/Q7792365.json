The first plates were engraved by Thomas Medland in May 1798, from paintings by Philip Reinagle. Between 1798 and 1807, they produced a total of thirty-three coloured plates, engraved in aquatint, stipple and line engraving. When he planned the project, Thornton had decided to publish seventy folio-size plates. Lack of interest from the general public spelled disaster for the scheme, and the holding of a lottery could not save it from financial ruin, neither did a page in the work dedicated to the spouse of George III, Queen Charlotte, patroness of botany and the fine arts. It is estimated that around 800 copies were produced, each containing 31 plates accompanied by inspirational poetry and explanatory notes covering flower lore and legend."]}, {"page": "Medland", "response": ["*Thomas Medland (c.1765\u20131833), English engraver and draughtsman"]}, {"page": "Medland, Thomas", "response": ["#redirectThomas Medland"]}, {"page": "An Authentic Account of an Embassy from the King of Great Britain to the Emperor of China", "response": ["The atlas' plates were selected and arranged by the English botanist Joseph Banks who did not accompany the embassy.
