This threat can be seen in a variety of forms across Europe, but much critical attention has been given to the field of research assessment in particular. For example, the UK [Research Excellence Framework] has been subject to criticism due to its assessment criteria from across the humanities, and indeed, the social sciences. In particular, the notion of \"impact\" has generated significant debate."]}, {"page": "Matthew Arnold", "response": ["Stefan Collini regards this as \"an exceptionally frank, but not unjust, self-assessment. ... Arnold's poetry continues to have scholarly attention lavished upon it, in part because it seems to furnish such striking evidence for several central aspects of the intellectual history of the nineteenth century, especially the corrosion of 'Faith' by 'Doubt'.  No poet, presumably, would wish to be summoned by later ages merely as an historical witness, but the sheer intellectual grasp of Arnold's verse renders it peculiarly liable to this treatment.\"Collini, 1988, p. 26.", "Assessing the importance of Arnold's prose work in 1988, Stefan Collini stated, \"for reasons to do with our own cultural preoccupations as much as with the merits of his writing, the best of his prose has a claim on us today that cannot be matched by his poetry.\"Collini, 1988, p. vii.  \"Certainly there may still be some readers who, vaguely recalling 'Dover Beach' or 'The Scholar Gipsy' from school anthologies, are surprised to find he 'also' wrote prose.\"Collini, 1988, p. 25.", "Arnold's \"want of logic and thoroughness of thought\" as noted by John M. Robertson in Modern Humanists was an aspect of the inconsistency of which Arnold was accused. Few of his ideas were his own, and he failed to reconcile the conflicting influences which moved him so strongly. \"There are four people, in especial,\" he once wrote to Cardinal Newman, \"from whom I am conscious of having learnt \u2013 a very different thing from merely receiving a strong impression \u2013 learnt habits, methods, ruling ideas, which are constantly with me; and the four are \u2013 Goethe, Wordsworth, Sainte-Beuve, and yourself.\" Dr. Arnold must be added; the son's fundamental likeness to the father was early pointed out by Swinburne, and was later attested by Matthew Arnold's grandson, Mr. Arnold Whitridge.

The beach, however, is bare, with only a hint of humanity in a light that \"gleams and is gone\".Collini, 1988, p. 39. Reflecting the traditional notion that the poem was written during Arnold's honeymoon (see composition section), one critic notes that \"the speaker might be talking to his bride\".Honan, 1981, p. 234.
