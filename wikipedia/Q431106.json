Lovett Professor of Military and Naval History at Yale University, and founder of the Department of War Studies, King's College London. In 1958, he co-founded the International Institute for Strategic Studies.Howard was described in the Financial Times as \"Britain's greatest living historian\". The Guardian described him as \"Britain's foremost expert on conflict\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Carl von Clausewitz", "response": ["Clausewitz's work is still studied today, demonstrating its continued relevance. More than sixteen major English-language books that focused specifically on his work were published between 2005 and 2014, whereas his 19th-century rival Jomini has faded from influence. The historian Lynn Montross said that this outcome \"may be explained by the fact that Jomini produced a system of war, Clausewitz a philosophy.  The one has been outdated by new weapons, the other still influences the strategy behind those weapons.\"Lynn Montross, War Through the Ages (2nd ed. 1946) p. 583.  Jomini did not attempt to define war but Clausewitz did, providing (and dialectically comparing) a number of definitions. The first is his dialectical thesis: \"War is thus an act of force to compel our enemy to do our will.\" The second, often treated as Clausewitz's 'bottom line,' is in fact merely his dialectical antithesis: \"War is merely the continuation of politics with other means.\" The synthesis of his dialectical examination of the nature of war is his famous \"trinity,\" saying that war is \"a fascinating trinity\u2014composed of primordial violence, hatred, and enmity, which are to be regarded as a blind natural force; the play of chance and probability, within which the creative spirit is free to roam; and its element of subordination, as an instrument of policy, which makes it subject to pure reason.\"Carl von Clausewitz, On War, originally Vom Kriege (3 vols., Berlin: 1832\u201334). The edition cited here was edited by Michael Howard and Peter Paret, Princeton University Press, 1984, pp. 75, 87, 89, 605.  Christopher Bassford says the best shorthand for Clausewitz's trinity should be something like \"violent emotion/chance/rational calculation.\" However, it is frequently presented as \"people/army/government,\" a misunderstanding based on a later paragraph in the same section. This misrepresentation was popularised by U.S. Army Colonel Harry Summers' Vietnam-era interpretation,Summers, Harry G., Jr. On Strategy: A Critical Analysis of the Vietnam War (Novato, CA: Presidio Press, 1982). facilitated by weaknesses in the 1976 Howard/Paret translation.", "Other notable writers who have studied Clausewitz's texts and translated them into English are historians Peter Paret of the Institute for Advanced Study and Sir Michael Howard.

The military historian Michael Howard, while describing Mincemeat as \"perhaps the most successful single deception operation of the entire war\", considered Mincemeat and Barclay to have less impact on the course of the Sicily campaign than Hitler's \"congenital obsession with the Balkans\". Macintyre writes that the exact impact of Mincemeat is impossible to calculate. Although the British had expected 10,000 killed or wounded in the first week of fighting, only a seventh of that number became casualties; the navy expected 300 ships would be sunk in the action, but they lost 12.

Andy Simpson argues that although Gough's command methods were clearly more prescriptive than those of Rawlinson's Fourth Army, in which a 20-page summary of division commanders' views was circulated in late August, given Rawlinson's lack of grip this was not necessarily a bad thing. Simpson argues that Gough's hands-on control may have been at Haig's urging, given Haig's dissatisfaction with Rawlinson, and suggests that this may also have been a factor in Gough being employed in major offensives in 1917, whereas Rawlinson was not.Simpson 2006, pp. 49\u201350, 53 Michael Howard cited Gough's love of micro-managing divisions as evidence that he had been overpromoted, and Gary Sheffield concedes that Gough's reputation for touring the trenches to spot dirty rifles suggests that he had found it hard to adapt to his greater responsibilities.Beckett & Corvi 2006, p. 83", "Some put the blame for Fifth Army's performance on Gough's Chief of Staff Neill Malcolm, although his overbearing behaviour with Gough's subordinates may have been, even in the view of contemporaries, a variant on the \"good-cop/bad-cop\" routine. Edmonds also wrote in his memoirs (which are somewhat less reliable than the Official History) that Malcolm \"accentuated and encouraged Gough's peculiarities, instead of softening them down\" and claimed that in late 1917 Peyton (Military Secretary) had warned Haig \"three times that he was not only injuring himself but also injuring the cause by keeping Gough in command\" but Haig was \"perfectly infatuated with him\". The situation worsened after Edward Beddington, who had been something of a buffer, left Fifth Army staff in 1917. Gough himself, in conversation with Liddell Hart and in The Fifth Army put some blame on Malcolm and also blamed himself for taking Malcolm with him on his inspection rounds, so that officers did not feel able to speak freely. However, Michael Howard, in his review of Farrar-Hockley's biography, commented that there was more to Fifth Army's \"malaise\" than just that. Sheffield points out that this does not seem to have been Gough's view during the war, and that Gough's problems began before Malcolm's arrival (e.g. at Loos) and continued after his removal.Sheffield & Todman 2004, p. 83 Watts of XIX Corps was the biggest victim of Malcolm.Farrar-Hockley 1974, p. 228 Farrar-Hockley argues that Gough was a popular figure until Bullecourt.Farrar-Hockley 1974, pp. 198\u2013199, 206 Wilson's academic biographer Keith Jeffery describes Farrar-Hockley as \"an unconvincing defence\" of Gough.Jeffery 2006, p. 170"]}, {"page": "John B.
