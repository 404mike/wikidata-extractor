He is a freelance illustrator and \"monster maker\" inspired by animals, music, folklore, myths, psychedelia and super nature. He has also worked on a number of other projects in the UK and Japan, such as television advertisements (Kia Picanto), as well as having art exhibitions in the UK and abroad. Fowler works in a variety of media, including drawing, painting, animation, printmaking and sculpture.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Super Furry Animals", "response": ["In early 1997, Super Furry Animals embarked on the NME Brats Tour and completed work on a speedy follow-up to Fuzzy Logic. Two singles preceded the new album, \"Hermann \u2665's Pauline\" in May and \"The International Language of Screaming\" in July, hitting No.\u00a026 and No.\u00a024 respectively: these releases were the first to feature cover art from Pete Fowler, who went on to design the sleeves of all their releases up until 2007's Hey Venus. The album, Radiator, hit shelves in August. The reviews were, if anything, better than those for Fuzzy Logic, and it sold more quickly than its predecessor, reaching a peak of No.\u00a08: however, Creation did not serve the album particularly well by releasing it just four days after the long-awaited new effort from Oasis, Be Here Now. Two further singles, \"Play It Cool\" (released September 1997) and \"Demons\" (November 1997) both hit No.\u00a027 in the charts, suggesting that Super Furry Animals had hit a commercial ceiling though which they were struggling to break. However, they had established themselves as favourites in the music press, a cut above the majority of their Britpop peers.", "In 1999, NME readers named them 'best new band' in January (this despite the fact it was now three years since they released their debut album). In May, the single \"Northern Lites\" was released and made No.\u00a011 in the charts. A dense production, with steel drums clattering out a calypso rhythm whilst Rhys sang an irreverent lyric about the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation weather phenomenon, it was an apt taster for the new album, Guerrilla. Recorded at the Real World Studios, the album retained SFA's pop melodies but took a less guitar-centric approach to their execution and was their most experimental work to date. Layers of samples over brass, percussion and Gruff's melodic singing produced an album which took the freewheeling approach of 1960s groups such as The Beatles, The Beach Boys and The Velvet Underground and updated it to the late 1990s. The album swung from glam and garage rock numbers (\"Night Vision\", \"The Teacher\") to novelty techno (\"Wherever I Lay My Phone (That's My Home)\"), ambient indietronica (\"Some Things Come From Nothing\") and upbeat drum and bass (\"The Door To This House Remains Open\"). For the cover art, Pete Fowler created the band's first three-dimensional models, rather than the paintings he had supplied for the Radiator album and singles."]}, {"page": "The Big Chill (music festival)", "response": ["In addition to a widely varied musical line-up, a focus on art, films, poetry, circus, cabaret, comedy and gourmet food all played a key part in setting The Big Chill apart from the competition.
