Their first vinyl release was a track (\"Three Years Later\") on the Crass Records compilation album Bullshit Detector 2.  They were initially inspired musically by bands as diverse as the Fall, PiL, Wire, and Adam and the Ants and politically by the anarchist stance of Crass.  Another of the band's early releases was under the name \"Skin Disease\", parodying the Oi! bands of the time so successfully that they were included on Back On The Streets, an Oi! compilation EP put together by Sounds magazine journalist Garry Bushell.  By the end of 1982, the band had expanded to include Alice Nutter (of Ow My Hair's on Fire), and Dunstan \"Dunst\" Bruce (of Men in a Suitcase) and were living in a squat in Armley, Leeds on Carr Crofts road, with Harry \"Daz\" Hamer and Mavis \"Mave\" Dillon joining soon after.  Stalwarts of the cassette culture scene, the band released a number of tapes including Be Happy Despite It All and Raising Heck With Chumbawamba, and were featured on many compilations. Chumbawamba were at the forefront of the 1980s anarcho-punk movement, frequently playing benefit gigs in squats and small halls for causes such as animal rights, the anti-war movement, and community groups. The band's collective political views are often described as anarchist. They made several songs about the UK miners' strike, including the cassette Common Ground and a song dedicated to the pit village of Fitzwilliam, which was one of the worst cases of economic decline following the strike."]}, {"page": "Whitesnake", "response": ["According to Coverdale, John Kalodner had convinced him that in order for the band to achieve their full potential, they needed a \"guitar hero\" that could match Coverdale as a frontman.

Schenker claims he turned down the offer to join Whitesnake, while Coverdale insists he decided to pass on Schenker. Vandenberg declined the offer to join as well, due to the success he was having at the time with his own band. Coverdale then approached Thin Lizzy guitarist John Sykes, who he met when Whitesnake and Thin Lizzy played some of the same festivals in Europe. Sykes was initially reluctant to join, wanting to continue working with Thin Lizzy frontman Phil Lynott, but after several more offers he accepted. John Sykes and Neil Murray were officially confirmed as members of Whitesnake in January 1984. Slide It In, Whitesnake's sixth studio album, was released on 30 January 1984. On the UK Albums Chart, it reached number nine. The album's highest chart position was in Finland, where it reached number four. Slide It In received mixed reviews from critics, with the production being a common complaint. Dave Dickson, writing for Kerrang!, called the record \"the best thing Whitesnake have yet commited to vinyl\", while Record Mirrors Jim Reid was highly critical of the lyrical content. AllMusic's Eduardo Rivadavia, in a retrospective review, called Slide It In \"an even greater triumph\" than the band's previous works, whereas Garry Bushell of Sounds gave the album a particularly scathing review, in which he likened Coverdale's voice to that of a \"dying dog\"."]}, {"page": "1955 in music", "response": ["*May 13 \u2013 Garry Bushell newspaper columnist, rock music journalist and singer, television presenter, writer and political activist"]}, {"page": "London Calling", "response": ["London Calling was met with widespread critical acclaim. Reviewing the album for The New York Times in 1980, John Rockwell said it finally validates the acclaim received by the Clash up to that point because of how their serious political themes and vital playing were retained in innovative music with a broad appeal. \"This is an album that captures all the Clash's primal energy, combines it with a brilliant production job by Guy Stevens and reveals depths of invention and creativity barely suggested by the band's previous work\", Rockwell said. Charles Shaar Murray wrote in NME that it was the first record to be on-par with the band's hype, while Melody Maker critic James Truman said the Clash had \"discovered themselves\" by embracing American music styles.Gray 2010, p. 412.

As a consequence, the whole movement lost much of its momentum and media interest, which were refocused on what British writer Malc Macmillan calls \"the more fashionable or lucrative markets of the day\" such as disco, glam, mod revival, new wave and electronic music.
