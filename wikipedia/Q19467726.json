Her father was a director of the , the seventh largest bank in Austria-Hungary, and the general director of the Oriental Railway. In the late 1890s Adele met Klimt, and may have begun a relationship with him. Opinion is divided on whether Adele and Klimt had an affair. The artist Catherine Dean considered that Adele was \"the only society lady painted by Klimt who is known definitely to be his mistress\", while the journalist Melissa M\u00fcller and the academic Monica Tatzkow write that \"no evidence has ever been produced that their relationship was more than a friendship\". The author Frank Whitford observes that some of the preliminary sketches that Klimt made for The Kiss showed a bearded figure which was possibly a self-portrait; the female partner is described by Whitford as an \"idealised portrait of Adele\". Whitford writes that the only evidence put forward to support the theory is the position of the woman's right hand, as Adele had a disfigured finger following a childhood accident."]}, {"page": "Albert Houthuesen", "response": ["During the Second World War he worked as a draughtsman at Doncaster.
