He specialised in the biology of flies, and wrote many books, especially popular science that helped entomology to reach a broader public. His The Natural History of Flies is considered to be the \"fly Bible\". Although his speciality was the Diptera, he acknowledged that they are not a popular topic: \"Breeding in dung, carrion, sewage and even living flesh, flies are a subject of disgust...not to be discussed in polite society\". It was Oldroyd who proposed the idea of hyphenating the names of true flies (Diptera) to distinguish them from other insects with \"fly\" in their names. Thus, the \"house-fly\", \"crane-fly\" and \"blow-fly\" would be true flies, while the \"dragonfly\", \"scorpion fly\" and so on belong to other orders. He also debunked the calculation that a single pair of house-flies, if allowed to reproduce without inhibitions could, within nine months, number 5.6\u00d71012 individuals, enough to cover the Earth to a thickness of 14.3 m (47 ft). Oldroyd calculated that such a layer would only cover Germany, but remarked \"that is still a lot of flies\".\nAll the following lists are potentially incomplete. Please add to them if you know of more.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Apterachalcus", "response": ["Apterachalcus is a genus of flies in the family Dolichopodidae. It has only one described species, Apterachalcus borboroides, known from New Zealand. It was originally described by Harold Oldroyd in 1955, who placed the species in Acropsilus. However, Daniel J. Bickel determined that the species did not belong to Acropsilus, and created a new genus for it in 1991."]}, {"page": "Oldroyd", "response": ["*Harold Oldroyd (born 1914), British entomologist"]}, {"page": "Biology of Diptera", "response": ["*Harold Oldroyd 1965: The Natural History of Flies.
