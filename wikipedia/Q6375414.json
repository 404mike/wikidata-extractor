She was, however, more famous for her Cockney songs, and became known as the Coster Comedienne.  Her act, a mixture of comedy and pathos, included such songs as \"Are We to Part Like This, Bill?\"She appeared in the Royal Variety Performance in 1935, and, following the death of her husband, became the lessee of the Grand Theatre, Clapham Junction  in her own right. Carney continued to perform until just before she died in 1950, at the age of 80.\nShe married George Barclay (b. 1868 Lambeth), a commission agent, in 1886, and had at least 5 children all born in Newington, including: \n\nGeorge (b. 1887)\nRichard (b. 1889)\nWilliam Edward (1891-1915)\nHarry (b. 1893)\nKate (b. 1899) She is buried with her husband and a son William, in Putney Vale Cemetery (Plot D5 no 47).

His most prolific writing period was between 1890 and 1920 and he claimed to have produced more than 2000 songs in total. One of his earliest patrons was the father of Charlie Chaplin, who predicted 'that child will be a great comedian one day'. His works included \"The Old Dun Cow\", \"Mademoiselle from Armenti\u00e8res\", \"How's Your Father?\", and \"Father's Got \u2018em\", which was to be performed by Debra Paget in the 1952 movie, Stars and Stripes, amongst many others. Wincott composed songs for artists such as: Dan Leno, Marie Lloyd, Charles Austin, The Great Vance, Vesta Tilley, Florrie Forde, Harry Champion and Kate Carney. Possibly his most well known song is \"The Little Shirt My Mother Made For Me\", sung by Tom Wooton and subsequently recorded by the country singer Marty Robbins among others.
