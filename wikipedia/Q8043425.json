They run the record label Type Records.Their earlier music combines constructed beats, smart melodies and brittle electronica, which is supplemented by guitar and other instrumentation in later recordings. An obsession with horror soundtracks, particularly from the films of Dario Argento, Umberto Lenzi and Lucio Fulci and the music of Goblin and Fabio Frizzi, has influenced them to produce more atmospheric soundscapes encompassing folk, drone, and psychedelia. Their album In Bocca Al Lupo fused this style with the doom and noise of Wolf Eyes and Sunn O))) to produce discomforting and loud funereal music. This album, composed of four long tracks, was originally conceived as a single piece, and is inspired by darker themes from Christian dogma and mythology. Since their transition away from IDM, beat driven electronics, beginning with The Dead Sea, Xela's rate of release has increased significantly.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of noise musicians", "response": ["*Xela"]}, {"page": "Xela", "response": ["Xela may refer to:", "* Quetzaltenango, a Guatemalan city which is more commonly referred to as Xela.", "* Xela, the signature that American artist Alex Schomburg used for his airbrushed covers for comic books.", "* Xela (musician), an electronic-music artist.", "* Xela (beetle) a genus of longhorn beetles in the tribe Xystrocerini."]}, {"page": "Tangled Wool", "response": ["Tangled Wool is a 2006 album released by the electronica music artist Xela under the label City Centre Offices.", "* Xela\u2019s Tangled Wool \u2013 Amazon.co.uk product information page"]}, {"page": "Grouper (musician)", "response": ["After finishing college, Harris briefly moved to Los Angeles, where she worked with Mayo Thompson at Patrick Painter.
