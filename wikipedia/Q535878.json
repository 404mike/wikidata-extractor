He was the author of numerous influential works about the history of France, particularly the French Revolution. Cobb meticulously researched the Revolutionary era from a ground-level view sometimes described as \"history from below\".\nCobb is best known for his multi-volume work The People's Armies (1961), a massive study of the composition and mentality of the Revolution's civilian armed forces. He was a prolific writer of essays from which he fashioned numerous book-length collections about France and its people. Cobb also found much inspiration from his own life, and he composed a multitude of autobiographical writings and personal reflections. Much of his writing went unpublished in his lifetime, and several anthologies were assembled from it by other scholars after his death.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Raymond Queneau", "response": ["* Raymond Queneau by Richard Cobb (Clarendon, 1976)"]}, {"page": "List of winners and shortlisted authors of the Booker Prize", "response": ["| rowspan=\"6\" | Professor Richard Cobb"]}, {"page": "Hugh Trevor-Roper", "response": ["In 1981 a Festschrift was published in honour of Trevor-Roper, History and the Imagination.

That night, rumors spread that supplies were hoarded at Saint-Lazare, a huge property of the clergy, which functioned as a convent, hospital, school, and even a jail.

French Revolutionary Infantry 1789\u20131802, p. 6.   This regiment had remained confined to its barracks during the initial stages of the mid-July disturbances. With Paris becoming the scene of a general riot, Charles Eugene, Prince of Lambesc (Marshal of the Camp, Proprietor of the Royal Allemand-Dragoons), not trusting the regiment to obey his order, posted sixty dragoons to station themselves before its depot in the Chauss\u00e9e d'Antin. The officers of the French Guards made ineffectual attempts to rally their men. The rebellious citizenry had now acquired a trained military contingent. As word of this spread, the commanders of the royal forces encamped on the Champ de Mars became doubtful of the dependability of even the foreign regiments.Munro Price. The Fall of the French Monarchy, pp. 96\u201397.  The future \"Citizen King\", Louis-Philippe, duc d 'Orl\u00e9ans, witnessed these events as a young officer and was of the opinion that the soldiers would have obeyed orders if put to the test. He also commented in retrospect that the officers of the French Guards had neglected their responsibilities in the period before the uprising, leaving the regiment too much to the control of its non-commissioned officers.Comments recorded in diary entries made by Louis-Philipp during 1789 However, the uncertain leadership of Besenval led to a virtual abdication of royal authority in central Paris. On the morning of 13 July, the electors of Paris met and agreed to the recruitment of a \"bourgeois militia\" of 48,000 men from the sixty voting districts of Paris, to restore order.Richard Cobb and Colin James.

In accord with principles of popular sovereignty and with complete disregard for claims of royal authority, the people established parallel structures of municipalities for civic government and militias for civic protection. In rural areas, many went beyond this: some burned title-deeds and no small number of ch\u00e2teaux, as the \"Great Fear\" spread across the countryside during the weeks of 20 July to 5 August, with attacks on wealthy landlords impelled by the belief that the aristocracy was trying to put down the revolution.M.
