The land was on Wandsworth Road. The institute was opened in 1871. The single large building had one basement floor accessible by a trapdoor from the apparatus room. A description by William Bulloch in 1925 notes: \"If one takes a tram from Westminster Bridge along the Embankment past \u201cLambeth Palace and Doultons and underneath an ugly railway bridge across the Wandsworth Road one reaches (No. 149) a small archway on which is graven the legend \u201cThe Brown Sanatory Institution founded 1871.\u201d On entering, one comes to a stable yard and, behind, a low building of one storey.

Among the researchers who worked at the institute was a Viennese scientist, Emanuel Edward Klein, sometimes considered the father of British bacteriology. The research he and his colleagues conducted at the Institution were published as in 1873 as the Handbook for the Physiological Laboratory along with John Burdon-Sanderson, Michael Foster, and Thomas Lauder Brunton. Their experiments included vivisection of animals, and following widespread protests, led to an enquiry in 1875, the Royal Commission on Vivisection for Scientific Purposes, chaired by Lord Cardwell and which resulted in the establishment of the Cruelty to Animals Act 1876.

In 1873, Sir John Burdon-Sanderson described action potentials and their long-distance propagation throughout plants. Action potentials in plants are carried out through a plants vascular network (particularly the phloem), a network of tissues that connects all of the various plant organs, transporting signaling molecules throughout the plant. Increasing the frequency of action potentials causes the phloem to become increasingly cross linked. In the phloem, the propagation of action potentials is dictated by the fluxes of chloride, potassium, and calcium ions, but the exact mechanism for propagation is not well understood. Alternatively, the transport of action potentials over short, local distances is distributed throughout the plant via plasmodesmatal connections between cells."]}, {"page": "John Mitchell Bruce", "response": ["After education at Aberdeen Grammar School, J.
