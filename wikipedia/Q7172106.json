Livesey was renowned for the intensity and competitiveness he brought to the development of his sport as well as a mischievous sense of humor, and during the mid-1970s, Livesey was regarded as Britain's leading rock climber.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of climbers and mountaineers", "response": ["* Pete Livesey (1943\u20131998) UK, influential rock climber in the 1970s"]}, {"page": "Johnny Dawes", "response": ["Dawes' main climbing career roughly splits into an initial period pre-1986 where he focused on gritstone in the Peak District, which was suited to his unique climbing style (e.g. Gaia, and End of the Affair).  From 1986, Dawes focused on Wales and on a diverse range of rock, from the slate quarries of Llanberis (e.g. The Quarryman, The Very Big and the Very Small, and Dawes of Perception), to the limestone cliffs of Gogarth (e.g. Conan the Librarian, and Hardback Thesaurus), and the rhyolite mountain crags of Clogwyn Du'r Arddu (e.g. Indian Face).  Dawes is mostly remembered for his intimidating traditional climbing routes, following the legacy of Pete Livesey and Ron Fawcett, and less for his sport climbing routes, unlike his contemporaries Jerry Moffatt and Ben Moon."]}, {"page": "Froggatt Edge", "response": ["Joe Brown popularised two well-known classic routes in the late 1940s, Sunset Slab (HVS 4b) and Three Pebble Slab (HVS 5a). Whilst the climbing is not difficult, a fall from either climb (particularly Sunset Slab) would result in injuries. One of the best-known climbs at Froggatt Edge is \"Downhill Racer\", a smooth and near-vertical 17 m (50 ft) slab of gritstone. It was first climbed in 1977 by Pete Livesey and represented a breakthrough in that it combined difficulty with real danger: there is no suitable crack in the rock in which to place protection (to anchor a rope), so a climber who slips from the small finger holds will hit the ground. It is now graded E4 6a."]}, {"page": "John Long (climber)", "response": ["In 1975, along with Ron Kauk and John Bachar, Long became the first to free climb a legitimate big wall with the first free ascent of the East Face of Washington Column, in Yosemite Valley, later dubbed Astroman, for two decades widely considered \"The World\u2019s Greatest Free Climb.\"  The following year, also in Yosemite, and with British climber Pete Livesey, Long free climbed the second big wall in history \u2013 the 1,700 foot Chouinard/Herbert route on Sentinel Rock.  On June 15, 2011, Alex Honnold free soloed the Chouinard/Herbert for CBS News, with Long hosting alongside 60 Minutes correspondent, Lara Logan."]}, {"page": "Mossdale Caverns", "response": ["Exploration of Mossdale Caverns was begun in 1941 by Bob Leakey of the British Speleological Association. It is a very flood-prone challenging cave system, with many of its passages involving long wet crawls. Other sections have neck-deep water and many of Leakey's explorations were conducted solo as few of his contemporaries had the necessary endurance. The end was finally reached again in 1964 by Mike Boon and Pete Livesey.
