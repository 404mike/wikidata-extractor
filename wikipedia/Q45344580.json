Cambridge won the toss and chose the Surrey station, leaving Oxford with the longer outside bend from the Middlesex station.  The crews were level at Fulham Football Club and Hammersmith Bridge but on the approach to Chiswick Pier, assistant umpire Matthew Pinsent spotted a person in the water and alerted umpire John Garrett, who stopped the race.

A representative of the Metropolitan Police noted: \"They almost took his head off\".  It was the first time the race had been stopped since 2001, and only the second time in the history of the event.
