Two years as player-manager of League of Ireland club Drogheda preceded a return to England with Fourth Division club Darlington and non-league club Scarborough, but a knee injury forced his retirement at the relatively young age of 27. He played once for his country, against England in the 1970 Home Internationals. After retiring as a player, he set up a sports trophy business in Newcastle upon Tyne.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Cowan (disambiguation)", "response": ["John Cowan (born 1952) is an American musician.", "John Cowan may also refer to:", "*John Cowan, Lord Cowan (1798\u20131878), Senator of the College of Justice in Scotland", "*Sir John Cowan (sheriff) (died 1842), Lord Mayor of London", "*John Cowan (Newfoundland politician) (1847\u2013?), politician in Newfoundland", "*Sir John Cowan (South Australian politician) (1866\u20131953), Australian politician", "*John Cowan (physician) (fl. 1870s), American physician and phrenologist", "*John Cowan (footballer, born 1870) (1870\u20131937), Scottish footballer", "*John Cowan (footballer, born 1949), Northern Ireland international footballer", "*Sir John Cowan, 1st Baronet (1814\u20131900), of the Cowan baronets, philanthropist", "*John Cowan (steel merchant) (1844\u20131929), Scottish iron and steel merchant", "*John Cowan (photographer) (1929\u20131979), British fashion photographer", "*John Cowan (RAN officer) (born 1957), Australian navy officer", "*John Cowans (1862\u20131921), Quartermaster-General to the Forces"]}]}}
