Her 1951 exhibition at the Crane Kalman gallery in Manchester was well reviewed and considered a great success. Guthrie also wrote and illustrated children's books, most notably with her first published book, The Magic Button which was published in 1958. A subsequent volume, Magic Button to the Moon also contained short poems by Guthrie. After Stephenson's death in 1965, Guthrie reproduced, as silk screens, three of his signature Abstracts designs from 1936, 1937 and 1938. During the 1960s Guthrie produced a further series of abstract silk screens, which she titled Camelot, that featured combinations of fields of pure colour."]}, {"page": "Free Painters and Sculptors", "response": ["* Cecil Stephenson"]}, {"page": "Colin St Clair Oakes", "response": ["In 1927 he enrolled in the architecture programme at the Northern Polytechnic School of Architecture (now London Metropolitan University), then under the direction of British abstract artist and pioneer of Modernism, Cecil Stephenson.
