He and the eight-month pregnant Alice were murdered in the village of Tacubaya (present day Mexico City), Mexico, where they had rented a house, on 27 April 1842.  Egerton was carrying large amounts of money, and both he and Alice were wearing jewelry which was untouched, although the murder was attributed to a robbery.  British diplomatic pressure to solve the crime led to the arrest of three local petty thieves, two of whom were hanged, and one of whom was allowed to escape from prison.  There has been speculation that Egerton's alleged involvement in fraudulent land sales in Texas, his ties to a Masonic order, or an unknown jealous lover of Alice was behind the killing.A painting of The Ravine of the Desert (The Valley of Mexico) was sold at Christie's New York in 2007 for $384,000.His painting The Valley of Mexico  (1837) is in the British Government Art Collection.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mexico", "response": ["Throughout history several prominent painters of different nationalities have expressed in their works the face of Mexico.
