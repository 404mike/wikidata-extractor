It was written in Cumbric or Old Welsh and contains the earliest known reference to King Arthur. From around the 7th century, the connection between Wales and the Old North was lost, and the focus of Welsh-language culture shifted to Wales, where Arthurian legend was further developed by Geoffrey of Monmouth. Wales's most celebrated medieval poet, Dafydd ap Gwilym (fl. 1320\u20131370), composed poetry on themes including nature, religion and especially love. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest European poets of his age. Until the late 19th century the majority of Welsh literature was in Welsh and much of the prose was religious in character. Daniel Owen is credited as the first Welsh-language novelist, publishing Rhys Lewis in 1885. The best-known of the Anglo-Welsh poets are both Thomases. Dylan Thomas became famous on both sides of the Atlantic in the mid-20th century. He is remembered for his poetry \u2013 his \"Do not go gentle into that good night; Rage, rage against the dying of the light\" is one of the most quoted couplets of English language verse \u2013 and for his \"play for voices\", Under Milk Wood. The influential Church in Wales \"poet-priest\" and Welsh nationalist R. S. Thomas was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1996.

The 20th century saw a move from verbose Victorian Welsh prose, with works such as Thomas Gwynn Jones's Ymadawiad Arthur. The First World War had a profound effect on Welsh literature with a more pessimistic style championed by T. H. Parry-Williams and R. Williams Parry. The industrialisation of south Wales saw a further shift with the likes of Rhydwen Williams who used the poetry and metre of a bygone rural Wales but in the context of an industrial landscape. The inter-war period is dominated by Saunders Lewis, for his political and reactionary views as much as his plays, poetry and criticism."]}, {"page": "List of museums in Wales", "response": ["| Mold Library, Museum and Gallery || Mold || Flintshire || North Wales || Local || website, local history, author Daniel Owen"]}, {"page": "1891 in literature", "response": ["*Daniel Owen \u2013 Enoc Huws"]}, {"page": "1885 in literature", "response": ["**Daniel Owen's long novel Hunangofiant Rhys Lewis, Gweinidog Bethel is published as the first written in Welsh.", "*Daniel Owen \u2013 Hunangofiant Rhys Lewis, Gweinidog Bethel"]}, {"page": "Seven Sleepers", "response": ["* Welsh: a late riser may be referred to as a saith cysgadur (\"seven sleeper\") - as in the 1885 novel Rhys Lewis by Daniel Owen, where the protagonist is referred to as such in chapter 37, p.\u00a0294 (Hughes a'i Fab, Caerdydd, 1948)."]}, {"page": "Mold, Flintshire", "response": ["Although denying the connection, Daniel Owen, who lived in the town, featured some similar events in his first novel, Rhys Lewis, published in instalments in 1882\u20131884.", "*Daniel Owen (1836\u20131895), a novelist writing in Welsh, was born in Mold."]}, {"page": "2004 in Wales", "response": ["*Gwobr Goffa Daniel Owen - Robin Llywelyn, Un Diwrnod yn yr Eisteddfod"]}, {"page": "2005 in Wales", "response": ["*Gwobr Goffa Daniel Owen - Sian Eirian Rhys Davies for I Fyd Sy Well"]}, {"page": "2003 in Wales", "response": ["*Gwobr Goffa Daniel Owen  \u2013 Elfyn Pritchard, Pan ddaw'r dydd"]}, {"page": "List of Welsh-language authors", "response": ["*Daniel Owen (1836\u20131895)"]}, {"page": "Western Mail (Wales)", "response": ["The Western Mail was founded in Cardiff in 1869 by John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute as a Conservative penny daily paper designed to promote the Marquess' political aspirations.
