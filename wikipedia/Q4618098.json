He taught Modern Languages at Blundell's School, Tiverton, Devon. \nHe was born in Hurstpierpoint, Sussex, England, of Cornish parents, Harriet Annie and Arthur Smith, and became a collaborator with Robert Morton Nance and Henry Jenner on the Gerlyver noweth Kernewek ha Sawsnek (Cornish-English dictionary). He compiled several grammars to make learning Cornish easier and edited some of the surviving Cornish texts.  He also wrote an important series of books aimed at teaching Welsh to English speakers. \nIn 1927, he married Dorothea Sophia Bazeley.

Works of this period were generally printed in limited publications by authors far removed from Cornwall and each other; their importance to the later revival movement was not fully recognized for decades. The literary output of the Cornish revival has largely been poetry. Notable writers of the time include Edward Chirgwin and A. S. D. Smith, whose epic poem Trystan hag Isolt, a reworking of the Tristan and Iseult legend, is one of the most celebrated pieces of Cornish revival writing.
