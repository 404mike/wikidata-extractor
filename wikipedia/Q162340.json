Kevin's screenplay has so many layers and interesting ideas. Apart from the love story I was very attracted by the themes of imagination and experience.\" The director intended to \"bring Austen up to date by roughening her up a bit\" and adding \"more life and energy and fun,\" opining that past Austen adaptations had been \"a little bit picture-postcard and safe and sweet and nice.\"", "Category:Films directed by Julian Jarrold"]}, {"page": "The Jarrold Group", "response": ["* Julian Jarroldwww.bafta.org"]}, {"page": "Anonymous Rex (film)", "response": ["Anonymous Rex is a 2004 science fiction film directed by Julian Jarrold and starring Sam Trammell and Daniel Baldwin.
