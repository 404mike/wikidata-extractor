Many of the magnates were alarmed when it was discovered that Ranulf wanted the king to take part in a campaign against the Welsh. Ranulf's opponents counselled the king that the earl might be planning treachery, since he had offered no hostages or security and could easily be ambushed in Wales. Stephen contrived a quarrel with Ranulf at Northampton, provoked by an advisor who told the earl that the king would not assist him unless he restored all the property he had taken and rendered hostages. The earl refused these terms. He was accused of treason and was arrested and imprisoned in chains until his friends succeeded in coming to terms with the King on 28 August 1146.  It was then agreed that the earl should be released, provided he surrendered all the royal lands and castles he had seized (Lincoln included), gave hostages and took a solemn oath not to resist the king in future."]}, {"page": "House of Rohan", "response": ["                               \u2502         x (after 1164) Constance of Penthi\u00e8vreDaughter of Alan, 1st Earl of Richmond (1095-30/03/1146), Count of Penthi\u00e8vre and Avaugour, Lord of Guingamp, and Bertha, Duchess of Brittany (c. 1114-1154).
