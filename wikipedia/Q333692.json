A year later his supporters again attempted to persuade Jenkins to challenge Wilson for the party leadership but he again declined.Campbell, Roy Jenkins: A Well-Rounded Life, p. 334.

Scenes From A Political Life (London: Little, Brown, 1995), p. 109. In his resignation letter to Wilson, Jenkins said that if there were a referendum \"the Opposition would form a temporary coalition of those who, whatever their political views, were against the proposed action.

He also criticised those who believed it was \"too late to do anything\" and that \"there lies the certainty of violence on a scale which can only adequately be described as civil war\".The Times (30 March 1981), p. 2.

Modern Britain was born in the opening years of the twentieth century.\" Asquith also worked strenuously to secure a settlement of the Irish question and, although unsuccessful, his work contributed to the 1922 settlement. Lastly, as a \"great head of a Cabinet\", Asquith directed and developed the talents of an extraordinary array of parliamentarians, for an extraordinarily long period. Hazlehurst contends that this \"ability to keep so gifted and divergently-inclined a group in harness (was) one of his major achievements.\" Overall, the Brocks argue that, \"on the basis of his achievements 1908 to 1914 he must rank among the greatest British statesmen of any era.\" His oldest political and personal friend, Haldane, wrote to Asquith on the latter's final resignation, \"My Dear A., a time has come in both of our lives when the bulk of work has been done.
