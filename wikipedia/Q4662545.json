He also brought in full-back James Chambers, twin brother of Adam Chambers. He also brought in a number of players on loan, including: Karl Darlow (21), Sam Mantom (20), Aaron McCarey (20), and Craig Westcarr (27). Mantom was made into a permanent signing in January. Smith signed a new two-and-a-half-year contract in October, keeping him at the club until summer 2015. This came after the club announced a \u00a310,000 profit on the previous campaign as Smith's 'Total Football' approach yielded a mid-table position for the young Walsall team, in addition to praise from pundits and fans. A poor run of results saw the team slip to just above the relegation zone in mid-December. Walsall recovered to win four of their five games in January, as Smith was named as Manager of the Month. They ended the season in ninth place, six points outside the play-offs."]}, {"page": "Richard Taundry", "response": ["On 9 May 2013, Taundry was released by Walsall along with George Bowerman, Connor Taylor, Aaron Williams and Jake Jones.", "In September 2013, following his period at Pelsall Villa, Taundry signed for Conference North side Worcester City, joining up with former Walsall teammate Aaron Williams.
