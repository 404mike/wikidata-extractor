Taylor (born 12 March 1968) is a British computer programmer with a Ph.D. in palaeontology.  To date, he has published 18 paleontological papers and is co-credited with naming three genera of dinosaur (Xenoposeidon in 2007 with Darren Naish, Brontomerus in 2011 with Matt J. Wedel and Richard Cifeli, and Haestasaurus in 2015 with Paul Upchurch and Phil Mannion).Along with paleontologists Darren Naish and Matt Wedel, he founded the paleontology blog Sauropod Vertebra Picture of the Week, where he blogs as Mike Taylor.\nHe lives in Ruardean, Gloucestershire, England.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Supersaurus", "response": ["The first described specimens of Supersaurus were individual bones that suggested a large diplodocid.

They concluded that an average Therizinosaurus may have had approximately  long legs. More recently, Mike Taylor and Matt Wedel suggested that the whole neck would be 2.9 times the size of the humerus, which was , resulting in a  long neck based on comparisons with the  series of Nanshiungosaurus. The most distinctive feature of Therizinosaurus was the presence of gigantic unguals on each of the three digits of its hands. These were common among therizinosaurs but particularly large and stiffened in Therizinosaurus, and they are considered as the longest known from any terrestrial animal."]}, {"page": "Barosaurus", "response": ["Barosaurus was an enormous animal, with some adults measuring about 25\u201327\u00a0meters (82\u201389\u00a0feet) in length and weighing about 12\u201320\u00a0metric tons (13\u201322\u00a0short tons).Paul, G.S., 2016, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs 2nd edition, Princeton University Press p. 213 There are some indications of even larger individuals, such as the enormous vertebra from the BYU 9024 specimen, which is 1.37 meters (4.5\u00a0ft) long. Assuming it belongs to Barosaurus, this was an animal that was 48 meters (157\u00a0ft) long and around 66 metric tons (73 short tons) in weight making it one of the largest known dinosaurs, with a neck length of at least 15 meters (49\u00a0ft) according to Mike Taylor. In 2020 Molina-Perez and Larramendi estimated it to be slightly smaller at 45 meters (148\u00a0ft) and 60 metric tons (66 short tons). However, abstracts from SVP indicate an assignment of BYU 9024 under Supersaurus. https://vertpaleo.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SVP_2021_VirtualBook_final.pdf Barosaurus was differently proportioned than its close relative Diplodocus, with a longer neck and shorter tail, but was about the same length overall. It was longer than Apatosaurus, but its skeleton was less robust."]}, {"page": "Haplocanthosaurus", "response": ["In 2005, Darren Naish and Mike Taylor reviewed the various proposed positions of Haplocanthosaurus in their study of diplodocoid phylogeny. They found it could be a non-neosauropod eusauropod, a basal macronarian, or a basal diplodocoid. In 2011, an analysis by Whitlock recovered Haplocanthosaurus as the basalmost member of the Diplodocoidea, the third potentiality of Taylor & Naish. In 2015, a specimen-level phylogenetic analysis was published, finding Haplocanthosaurus to be a confirmed diplodocoid, either very basal, or more derived than rebbachisaurids. Their implied weighting cladogram is shown below."]}, {"page": "Michael Taylor", "response": ["* Mike Taylor (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "Xenoposeidon", "response": ["Xenoposeidon (meaning \"strange or alien Poseidon\", in allusion to Sauroposeidon) is a genus of rebbachisaurid sauropod dinosaur from the Early Cretaceous of England, living about 140\u00a0million years ago. It is known from a single partial vertebra with unusual features, unlike those of other sauropods. This bone was first discovered in the early 1890s but received little attention until it was found by University of Portsmouth student Mike Taylor, who formally described and named it in 2007 with Darren Naish.", "Xenoposeidon's distinct suite of vertebral characteristics is unlike those found in other groups of sauropods, which differ in various proportional and structural features. So unique is the vertebra that when Taylor and Naish attempted to classify it using a phylogenetic analysis, they found that, although a neosauropod, it didn\u2019t fit \u2018comfortably\u2019 into any of the established groups, Diplodocoidea, Camarasauridae, Brachiosauridae and Titanosauria. Xenoposeidon could be a derived member of one of the known groups, or may even represent a new group. The authors left it as a neosauropod of uncertain affinities. The titanosauriform phylogeny by D'Emic established Xenoposeidon as a nomen dubium due to its basis on nondiagnostic material. However, Mike Taylor has disagreed with these findings online. According to a study published in 2018, X. proneneukos is a basal member of Rebbachisauridae, and 10 million years older than the next oldest member of the family, Histriasaurus.Taylor MP.

He thought that it might belong to Cetiosaurus brevis, better known today as Pelorosaurus conybearei. The bone attracted little attention for decades, sitting on a shelf at the British Natural History Museum in London for 113 years. Mike Taylor, a sauropod vertebra specialist, stumbled upon it and became interested in the unusual specimen, entering into a description of it with Darren Naish.", "*Description of the fossil by Mike Taylor"]}, {"page": "Epipophyses", "response": ["Several scientific papers have observed that epipophyses were present in various non-dinosaur archosauromorphs. These include several pseudosuchians (Batrachotomus, Revueltosaurus, Xilousuchus, Effigia, Hesperosuchus), basal avemetatarsalians (aphanosaurs) non-archosaur archosauriforms (Vancleavea, Halazhaisuchus), rhynchosaurs, several tanystropheids, and allokotosaurs. Sauropod-oriented paleontologist Mike Taylor has informally suggested that epipophyses were also present in the vertebrae of certain pterosaurs."]}]}}
