He uses a projection technique called anamorphosis to create the illusion of three dimensions when viewed from the correct angle. He preserves his work in photographs, often positioning a person within the image as if they were interacting with the scene.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Trompe-l'\u0153il", "response": ["Several contemporary artists use chalk on pavement or sidewalk to create trompe-l'\u0153il works, a technique called street painting or \"pavement art\". These creations last only until washed away, and therefore must be photographed to be preserved. Practitioners of this form include Julian Beever, Edgar Mueller, Leon Keer, and Kurt Wenner.", "*Julian Beever"]}, {"page": "Sidewalk chalk", "response": ["Artists such as Kurt Wenner, Ellis Gallagher and Julian Beever have created intricate and realistic street paintings using the chalk and pastels. It is typical for sidewalk chalk artists to use anamorphic drawing when drawing with sidewalk chalk. Nonanamorphic drawing are drawings that are drawn to be observed face-on, whereas anamorphic drawings are drawn to be observed from a different viewpoint. Julian Beever, in a Q&A with Adam Boretz, explained his drawing of his first anamorphic sidewalk chalk drawing, Swimming Pool:"]}, {"page": "Anamorphosis", "response": ["Anamorphic effects are popular in street art, sometimes called \"Slant Art\" when accomplished on sidewalks. Examples are the sidewalk chalk drawings of Kurt Wenner and Julian Beever, where the chalked image, the pavement, and the architectural surroundings all become part of an illusion. Art of this style can be produced by taking a photograph of an object or setting at a sharp oblique angle, then putting a grid over the photograph. Another elongated grid is placed on the sidewalk based on a specific perspective, and visual elements of one are transcribed into the other, one grid square at a time.", "* Julian Beever"]}, {"page": "Phantogram", "response": ["Phantograms are related to anamorphic trompe-l'\u0153il paintings that first appeared during the Renaissance, a famous example of which is Andrea Pozzo's fresco in Sant'Ignazio, featuring a flat area that appears to be a domed ceiling when viewed from the correct vantage point. Contemporary artists such as Kurt Wenner and Julian Beever use similar techniques to create chalk pavement art that appears to be three-dimensional. Similar effects are often seen on televised sporting events, where sponsor logos are painted onto the playing field or track, distorted so as to appear \"upright\" from the viewpoint of a particular TV camera. However, these examples do not employ any of the stereoscopy techniques that characterize phantograms."]}, {"page": "Pavement Picasso", "response": ["#REDIRECT Julian Beever"]}]}}
