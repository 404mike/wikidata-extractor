Dennis accepts and leaves Weatherfield. Dennis returns a year later and soon finds a new star in his hometown.

While on the course, he meets Sandra Petty (Heather Moore), a teenage girl who falls for him when he cuts her hair. Dennis is not interested in Sandra, who proceeds to send a love letter to him professing her feelings, but he tells her that he is engaged. To his horror, Sandra persuades her father, Lionel (Edward Evans), to buy the corner shop and the Pettys move in. Sandra continues to try and win Dennis over, which she eventually does. They date for a while but he is not that upset when Lionel sells the shop and she moves away a few months later."]}, {"page": "List of former Coronation Street characters", "response": ["|Jimmy Frazer || John Barrie || 1972"]}, {"page": "Barrie (name)", "response": ["* John Barrie (actor) (1917\u201380), British actor in TV police dramas"]}, {"page": "Life for Ruth", "response": ["* John Barrie as Mr. Gordon"]}, {"page": "The Wild and the Willing", "response": ["* John Barrie as Mr Corbett"]}, {"page": "List of fictional police detectives", "response": ["* Sergeant Cork (played by John Barrie)"]}, {"page": "List of Coronation Street characters (1961)", "response": ["| John Barrie"]}, {"page": "Sergeant Cork", "response": ["A 1969 review in The Age opined that rather than suspense, the strengths of the series were its \"[e]xcellent period settings and wonderfully thick pea-soupers\" which \"add up to splendid evocative stuff\", as well as the performance of star John Barrie.\"Crime fizz\", The Age TV Radio Guide, 16\u201322 May 1969, p. 3.", "* John Barrie as Sergeant Cork"]}, {"page": "The File of the Golden Goose", "response": ["The killing of the girlfriend makes the whole assignment very personal for Pete.
