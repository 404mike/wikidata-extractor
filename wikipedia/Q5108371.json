Tellingly, the author found that whilst Triumph 'was well able to design and build a model to match contemporary Japanese designs in engine performance, and to out-handle them on the road', the contact breaker points assembly required replacing during the ride. Testing the same machine some 3 years earlier, British magazine, The Biker commented similarly as to the performance but instead concluded that the Bandit would merely have been an 'also-ran' against the-then Japanese competition."]}, {"page": "Chris Vincent", "response": ["Chris Vincent may refer to:", "*Chris Vincent (American football) (born 1981), American football running back", "*Chris Vincent (motorcycle sidecar racer) (1935\u20132021), British motorcycle sidecar road racer"]}, {"page": "1962 Spanish motorcycle Grand Prix", "response": ["|  Chris Vincent /  Eric Bliss"]}, {"page": "Norman Storer", "response": ["Born in Ridgeway, Derbyshire, Storer was experienced in other disciplines of motorcycle racing before speedway, starting with trials in 1950 and later road racing and scrambles.Jones, Alan (2010) Speedway in Leicester: The Lions Roar, Automedia, p. 157.
