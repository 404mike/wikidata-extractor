Casey stuck to his strategy of turning over the operation to the Iraqis, whilst senior officers and Washington policymakers were using the failure of the operation to open a debate about what needed to be done and whether Casey was the correct commander. Casey and Lieutenant General Robert Fry, the SBMR-I (Senior British Military Representative-Iraq) in Baghdad, agreed that the British forces team in Baghdad (particularly the intelligence section) would spearhead the F-SEC (Force Strategic Engagement Cell)- a new effort (made up of US military intelligence counterparts, CIA and MI6 personnel) to turn the Sunni community against the jihadists. The domestic policy in the UK made it impossible for British forces in Iraq to reverse its planned withdrawal and reinforce the Coalition in Baghdad, so Fry reversed his idea that Task Force Knight should move to a \"operational overwatch\" role and made them an important contributor to the operation.Urban, Mark, Task Force Black: The Explosive True Story of the Secret Special Forces War in Iraq , St. Martin's Griffin, 2012  , p.172-173, p. 180"]}, {"page": "List of alumni of King's College London", "response": ["*Sir Robert Fry \u2013 Commandant General Royal Marines"]}, {"page": "List of people associated with Penarth", "response": ["*Lieutenant-General Sir Robert Fry KCB CBE is a British Royal Marines general, formerly Commandant General Royal Marines was born in Penarth."]}, {"page": "Department of War Studies, King's College London", "response": ["The department's alumni includes senior government officials, military personnel, diplomats, journalists, academics and businesspeople.
