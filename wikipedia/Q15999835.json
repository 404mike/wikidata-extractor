Brentford Development Squad manager Jon de Souza vouched for what Pierre could gain from Cambridge boss Richard Money, with de Souza having worked as youth team manager under Money while at Luton Town. After missing a few games through injury, Pierre was named on the bench for an FA Trophy second round tie at St Albans City on 14 December. After replacing Josh Gillies on 69 minutes and with the score at 1\u20131, Pierre smashed home a 25-yard shot in the third minute of injury time to send Cambridge through to the third round. After the game, Pierre said \"hopefully working with him (Money) for a little bit longer will help me improve and to cut out all the silly errors in my game. I'll just see how things go here, but hopefully I can just progress and if the gaffer wants me to stay a little bit longer then I'd do that\". After just one appearance, Pierre returned to Brentford on 6 January 2014. Brentford academy director Ose Aibangee commented that \"even though Aaron's game time was limited at Cambridge, the atmosphere and experience of being involved in a squad pushing for promotion to the Football League is something which he has not experienced before and something he can learn from massively\"."]}, {"page": "2014 FA Trophy Final", "response": ["|RW ||29|| Josh Gillies || || "]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 Carlisle United F.C. season", "response": ["| Josh Gillies", "| Josh Gillies", "||MF || ||14 ||Josh Gillies || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1"]}, {"page": "2015\u201316 Carlisle United F.C. season", "response": ["| 1 July || AM ||  || Josh Gillies || Gateshead  || Free transfer || "]}]}}
