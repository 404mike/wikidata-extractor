He returned with only circumstantial evidence: three sets of tracks found at a similar elevation as Trent's lions (). They were believed to have been left by individuals that were tracking a herd of buffalo during a hunt, ruling out the possibility of the marozi being cubs. Dower also discovered that the natives had long differentiated the marozi from lions or leopards, which they referred to by different names. Aside from that, he found out that the marozi had also been called different names in other regions, such as \"ntararago\" in Uganda, \"ikimizi\" in Rwanda, and \"abasambo\" in Ethiopia. R. I. Pocock examined a skin and skull collected by Michael Trent, and discussed his findings in an appendix to Gandar-Dower's book, but he could not reach definite conclusions on the limited evidence available."]}, {"page": "Windlesham House School", "response": ["*Kenneth Gandar-Dower (1908\u20131944), sportsman, aviator, explorer and author"]}, {"page": "Harringay Stadium", "response": ["In 1937, Harringay Stadium was part of a scheme by the owner of the Romford Stadium, Arthur Leggett, to increase attendance at his venue.

In early 1932 he suffered from pneumonia. In mid-June he made his comeback as a runner-up for the Queen's Club Championships having it lost to Jack Crawford in four sets. In Liverpool at the Northern tournament he clinched the title by defeating home-favorite Nigel Sharpe. The same year he played his first Dutch international final against von Kehrling but came short. The following year he went for the title again but was stopped the second time by Giorgio de Stefani in a four set final. Timmer found consolation in the doubles contest where he and Kehrling took revenge by defeating de Stefani and George Lyttleton-Rogers and gaining the title. The key of the winning form was that Timmer overcame his well-known weak serve. Also in 1933 he participated in the West of England Championships only losing to Daniel Prenn in the final. In the 1934 Dutch International Championships Timmer was eliminated early in the semifinal by Hermann Artens. He was also unsuccessful in retaining the doubles title with Kehrling as the Austrian duo of Artens and Georg von Metaxa won that title as well. He had to skip the 1937 season as a result of rheumatism in his shoulder. He fought one of his last matches in 1938 against Kenneth Gandar-Dower, a victory of only two sets."]}, {"page": "List of Old Harrovians", "response": ["*Kenneth Gandar-Dower (1908\u20131944), English tennis player and aviator"]}, {"page": "Romford Greyhound Stadium", "response": ["The greyhound industry boom allowed companies such as Romford Stadium Ltd to thrive and greyhound racing itself was big business and national news.
