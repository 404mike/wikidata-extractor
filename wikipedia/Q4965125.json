A free kick specialist, he was described by England manager Sir Alf Ramsey, after a game against Scotland in 1968, as being \"ten years ahead of his time\". His versatility was such that while he was at West Ham he played in every position in the team, including goalkeeper in his third game, replacing an injured Brian Rhodes. With his transfer from West Ham United to Tottenham Hotspur in 1970, he became Britain's first \u00a3200,000 footballer.", "Peters signed his first professional contract in November 1960. His first manager Ted Fenton left the club in 1961, to be replaced by Ron Greenwood. He was a major influence on Peters and his progress as a young footballer. In his first years with West Ham, Peters had played in both defensive and midfield positions before Fenton had encouraged him to play as a right-half. He made his debut on Good Friday 1962 in a 4\u20131 home win against Cardiff City. He scored his first goal for West Ham in a 6\u20131 win at Manchester City on 8 September 1962. Also in 1962, Peters played in goal for West Ham in a game against Cardiff City after regular goalkeeper, Brian Rhodes had been injured."]}, {"page": "1959\u201360 West Ham United F.C. season", "response": ["|Brian Rhodes"]}, {"page": "1977 Australian Sports Sedan Championship", "response": ["| Brian Rhodes", "| Brian Rhodes"]}, {"page": "Rhodes, Brian", "response": ["#redirectBrian Rhodes"]}, {"page": "List of outfield association footballers who played in goal", "response": ["|In only his third game for West Ham, Peters went in goal in an away game with Cardiff City after regular goalkeeper Brian Rhodes was injured."]}]}}
