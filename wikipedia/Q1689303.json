He appeared for local semi-professional sides in the Isthmian League until he joined Charlie Hurley's Fourth Division Reading team in 1974; quickly becoming a key player, he helped Reading to win promotion to the Third Division during the 1975\u201376 season. As his drug habit intensified, Friday's form began to dip in the first half of the 1976\u201377 season, leading Reading to sell him to Second Division side Cardiff City around the New Year. Friday travelled to join his new team by train without a valid ticket and had to be bailed by the Cardiff manager Jimmy Andrews before he signed for the club. He performed strongly on his debut, but afterwards his form declined and his personal life caused him to repeatedly miss matches altogether. Following a number of incidents, on and off the field\u2014including kicking Mark Lawrenson in the face \u2014Friday retired from football in December 1977, aged 25. He died in Acton in 1990, aged 38, after suffering a heart attack.", "Friday was watched by other clubs throughout November and December 1976, but although he performed well in some games, including a 1\u20131 draw away at Crystal Palace on 6 November in which he scored his team's only goal, he was poor in others. After being marked out of the game during Reading's 4\u20130 loss away against Mansfield Town on 8 November, he was substituted. \"Coincidence or not\", wrote the Evening Post, \"when Friday left, so did half a dozen managers and scouts\". Friday was so angry at his team's performance that he broke into the Mansfield dressing room and defecated in the team bath. Reading's asking price stood at \u00a350,000, and the first transfer offer came from Second Division side Cardiff City around mid-December. Cardiff boss Jimmy Andrews bid \u00a328,000, half of his offer a year before, which Reading's directors accepted, wanting the troublesome player off their hands as quickly as possible. Friday was reluctant to go to the Welsh club, saying that it was too far from home, that he wanted to go to a First Division team and that he wanted more money than was being offered; however, when Hurley told him that unless he went to Cardiff he would be released, he agreed and travelled to Wales on 30 December 1976.", "Friday's style of play was based around his exceptional ball skills, described by Cardiff doctor Leslie Hamilton as \"absolutely fabulous\", and his instinctive footballing vision, which enabled him both to execute flamboyant individual moves and to create attacks for his teammates. Jimmy Andrews, his manager at Cardiff, later called Friday \"the complete centre-forward\" and placed him on a par with Alan Shearer, while Maurice Evans claimed that he could have played for England, and was at least on a level with international strikers he had worked with such as John Aldridge and Dean Saunders. This opinion was shared by Hamilton and Friday's Reading teammate John Murray, both of whom firmly declared in separate interviews that Friday would have been good enough for the England team had he \"sorted his head out\", in Hamilton's words."]}, {"page": "John Toshack", "response": ["Having secured his release from his contract at Liverpool, Toshack looked to move into management and approached his former club Cardiff City over a coaching position but was rejected by manager Jimmy Andrews who questioned his qualifications for the role. Toshack instead received a phone call from Swansea City chairman Malcolm Struel and was invited to a meeting at the club. Following this, he was appointed player-manager of Fourth Division club Swansea on 1 March 1978, becoming the youngest manager in the Football League at the age of 29. Succeeding Harry Griffiths who stepped down to become his assistant, Toshack's appointment was seen as a significant coup for Swansea and the crowd for his first match in charge, a 3\u20133 draw with Watford, more than doubled from the club's previous home match with over 15,000 in attendance."]}, {"page": "West Ham United F.C.

It became a place for routine discussion of the team, and ideas and wisdom freely passed back and forth. The tradition of mentorship lasted long into the 1960s even after Fenton had moved on and saw future managers John Lyall and Harry Redknapp pass through.

However, Alston spent just one season at Kenilworth Road as the club began to experience financial difficulties resulting in Alston not being paid at times. Alston later described his decision to reject offers from Germany and return to England with Luton as \"the biggest mistake I ever made\". Cardiff City manager Jimmy Andrews paid \u00a320,000 to take him to Ninian Park with the club also agreeing to pay Alston the wages owed to him by Luton. He scored twice on his debut in a 4\u20133 win over Chesterfield and later went on to become the first post-war Cardiff player to score a hat-trick in the FA Cup in a 6\u20132 win over Exeter City. In his first season, the club won the Welsh Cup, qualifying for the European Cup Winners' Cup the following season.

He went on to play for Norwich City, where he teamed up with ex-West Ham players Alan Taylor, Graham Paddon, Martin Peters and John McDowell.

Dwyer won his second Welsh Cup at the end of the season, as Cardiff defeated Stourbridge under Jimmy Andrews, who had previously been O'Farrell's assistant. In only his second season as a senior professional, Dwyer was ever present in the league for Cardiff playing in all 42 matches during the campaign and missing just one first team match, the first leg of the Welsh Cup final against Stourbridge. He made a total of 52 appearances in the 1973\u201374 season. Andrews was forced to sell players to balance finances ahead of the 1974\u201375 season and the sales placed further strain on the club's results as the side were placed in the relegation zone midway through the campaign. In January 1975, Cardiff played Millwall at The Den. With Cardiff trailing 5\u20131, a frustrated Dwyer deliberately collided with Millwall goalkeeper Ray Goddard causing the opposition player to be stretchered off the field with a concussion. Dwyer's actions had caused fans from both sides to clash and a Millwall supporter ran onto the pitch and aimed a punch at Dwyer. Seeing the punch coming, Dwyer was able to avoid being hit and grabbed the fan in a headlock. Holding on until the fan was apprehended by police. Dwyer later refused to press charges against the fan. Cardiff finished the season in 21st position, suffering relegation to the Third Division, and went on to lose the Welsh Cup final 5\u20132 to Wrexham over two legs.", "Jimmy Andrews, who managed Dwyer for four seasons at Cardiff, described him as \"brave and he had a good professional mentality. He wasn't a great player but a good scrapper who would always give you everything he had.\" Referring to his period playing as forward, Andrews added \"I played him as a striker and he scored one or two important goals [...] he was always happy to give it a go\u2014wherever I wanted him to play. He was a good pro.\" Roger Gibbins, who won promotion with Dwyer in 1983, described him as \"an out-and-out centre half who was good in the air, competed very well and who put his head in where it hurt.\""]}, {"page": "John Lewis (footballer, born 1955)", "response": ["Lewis was born in Tredegar and was spotted by Cardiff City while playing for Pontllanfraith in a Welsh Football League match and was quickly offered a contract by then manager Jimmy Andrews.
