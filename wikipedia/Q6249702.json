He made his debut on 2 December 1969 against Kilmarnock and scored his first goal against Hearts on 29 August 1970.\nA series of injuries meant that it was not until the 1972-73 season that the Saints fans saw his real abilities and he was the club's top scorer in each of the next two seasons. He made his final appearance for the club against Aberdeen on 21 April 1976 and was freed at the end of the 1975-76 season after relegation from the Scottish Premier Division.\nMuir died in February 2018, aged 70.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Muir (disambiguation)", "response": ["John Muir (1838\u20131914) was a Scottish-born American environmentalist and author.", "John Muir may also refer to:", "* John Muir (indologist) (1810\u20131882), British linguist", "* John Muir (businessman) (1828-1903), Scottish businessman, founder of Finlay Muir & Co, and Lord Provost of Glasgow", "* John Muir (South African naturalist) (1874\u20131947), Scottish-born South African physician, naturalist and historian", "* John Muir (trade unionist) (1879\u20131931), British journalist and Member of Parliament", "* John Muir (footballer, born 1903), Scottish footballer", "* John Muir (engineer) (1918\u20131977), American engineer and author", "* John Muir (footballer, born 1947), Scottish footballer", "* John Muir (judge) (fl. c. 2000), judge on the Supreme Court of Queensland, Australia", "* John Muir College, an undergraduate college of the University of California, San Diego", "* \"John Muir\", a song by Schoolboy Q from Blank Face LP", "* John Muir Award (disambiguation)", "* John Muir Branch Library, Los Angeles", "* John Muir Country Park, East Lothian, Scotland", "* John Muir Health, a health care service", "* John Muir National Historic Site, in the San Francisco Bay area, California", "* John Muir Parkway, part of California State Route 4", "* John Muir Publications, an American publisher best known for publishing Rick Steves, acquired by Avalon Publishing Group", "* John Muir Trail, California", "* John Muir Trail (Tennessee)", "* John Muir Trust, a Scottish charity", "* John Muir Way, a coastal path in East Lothian", "* John Muir Wilderness, California"]}, {"page": "1947 in Scotland", "response": ["* John Muir, footballer (died 2018)"]}, {"page": "2018 in association football", "response": ["** John Muir, 70, Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "2017\u201318 in Scottish football", "response": ["*28 February: John Muir, 70, Alloa Athletic and St Johnstone forward."]}, {"page": "2018 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**John Muir, 70, Scottish footballer (St Johnstone, Alloa)."]}, {"page": "Deaths in February 2018", "response": ["*John Muir, 73, Australian judge.The Hon", "*John Muir, 70, Scottish footballer (St Johnstone, Alloa).Former player John Muir 1947-2018"]}]}}
