In the 29th Infantry Brigade's first action of the Korean War, the brigade was ordered to defend the areas east of Koyang on the Bridgehead Line. The 1st Battalion, Royal Ulster Rifles (1RUR) covered the brigade's left flank, while the 1st Battalion, Royal Northumberland Fusiliers (1RNF) was stationed on the brigade's right flank. The 1st Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment and the 1st Battalion, 21st Royal Thai Regiment covered the brigade's rear with artillery support. At 04:00 on January 3, 1RUR first made contact with the 149th Division of the PVA 50th Corps. The PVA surprised and overran the Companies B and D of 1RUR, but a counterattack by Major C. A. H. B. Blake of 1RUR restored the battalion's position by the morning. While 1RUR was under attack, the PVA forces also infiltrated 1RNF's positions by exploiting the unguarded valleys between hilltops occupied by the British. The entire 1RNF soon came under sniper fire and the PVA made repeated attempts to capture Y Company of 1RNF. To restore 1RNF's position, Brigadier Thomas Brodie of the 29th Infantry Brigade sent W Company of 1RNF with four Churchill tanks as reinforcement. The reinforcement was met with machine gun and mortar fire, but the PVA resistance immediately crumbled under the Churchill tanks' devastating assaults. The surviving PVA troops fled under the bombardment from 4.2-inch mortars and 25 pounder field guns. In the aftermath of fighting, the 29th Infantry Brigade suffered at least 16 dead, 45 wounded and 3 missing, while 200 PVA dead were found within 1RNF's position."]}, {"page": "Thomas Brodie (disambiguation)", "response": ["Thomas Brodie (1903\u20131993) was a British Army soldier.", "Thomas Brodie or Tom Brodie may also refer to:", "*Thomas Brodie (Royal Navy officer) (1779\u20131811)", "*Thomas Brodie-Sangster (born 1990), English actor and musician"]}, {"page": "1954 New Year Honours", "response": ["*Major-General Thomas Brodie, CBE DSO (34236), late Infantry."]}, {"page": "English understatement", "response": ["Better documented is the cross-cultural miscommunication between British and American military personnel in the midst of the Korean War.
