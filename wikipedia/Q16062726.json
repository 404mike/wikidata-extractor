A little later (in 1840) he made one of the earliest overland journeys with sheep from Sydney to Melbourne. The pastoral capabilities of the country attracted his attention, and he determined to settle in Australia Felix. He took up a run in the western district on the Loddon River, and subsequently removed to Mount Fyans. He was for some years associated in business with the late James Montgomery, and in 1852 he joined Edward Wilson, and became one of the proprietors of the Argus. Prior to this he had taken a prominent part in political life, particularly interesting himself in the agitation for the separation of Port Phillip District from New South Wales. He was one of the representatives for the Electoral district of Port Phillip in the Parliament of New South Wales in 1848, and vigorously supported its claims for justice from the governing authorities of New South Wales. He was a strong and earnest supporter of the anti-convict movement, and took a prominent part in the demonstration which was held in Melbourne in 1849, when the inhabitants resolved to oppose the landing of convicts from the ship Randolph by physical force, and to undergo any extremity of suffering rather than permit the colony to become a receptacle of felons.After separation had been secured, Mackinnon represented the Belfast and Warrnambool district in the old unicameral Victorian Legislative Council, and assisted to pass a measure intended to prevent the introduction of convicted offenders into the colony. He energetically combated the efforts of the imperial authorities to prevent the effective administration of the enactment; and on the popular opposition proving successful he proceeded in 1853 with William Westgarth to Tasmania to assist the anti-transportation party in the colony. Indeed, he took a strong interest in all the public movements of the day; and his vigour and courage were so well recognised that, in the early days when bushrangers were prevalent, he had been offered the command of the police force of Port Phillip\u2014a position which, however, he did not accept. He was one of the members of the original Council of the University of Melbourne, and first Chairman of its Building Committee. In 1864 he was nominated to serve on the Hawthorn Council, and elected as the Mayor. When the gold discoveries in Victoria gave such a wonderful impetus to the colony, the vigorous judgment and business ability of Mackinnon, with the brilliant literary qualities of his partner, Edward Wilson, placed the Argus in the van of the Australian press. After some years of arduous work, Mackinnon returned to England, where he remained. He was twice married, his first wife being a daughter of Robert Montgomery, and sister of James Montgomery; and his second, Emily, daughter of Capt. Bundoch, R.N.Mackinnon died in Torquay, Devon, England on 21 March 1888.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Edward Wilson (journalist)", "response": ["In the early days of the gold-rush the paper was produced under great difficulties, but the circulation kept increasing, and it became a valuable property. Wilson strenuously opposed the influx of convicts from Tasmania, fought for the separation of the Port Phillip District from New South Wales, and opposed Governor Charles Hotham in his attitude to the miners; but when the rebellion broke out he took the stand that there were peaceable and legitimate methods of obtaining redress. When Charles Gavan Duffy came to Victoria and went into politics Wilson sent him a list of suggested reforms which included justice to the Aborigines, the organizing of agriculture as a department of the state, the introduction of the ballot into municipal elections, and the leasing of crown lands for cultivation with the right of ultimate purchase. He was the first to raise the cry \"unlock the lands\". He was in fact a thorough democrat in sentiment, and an ardent reformer. Costs of running the Argus had increased and Wilson was close to ruin, but was saved when Lauchlan Mackinnon bought a partnership from James Gill, and took over management."]}, {"page": "Members of the Victorian Legislative Council, 1851\u20131853", "response": [": Osborne resigned December 1852; replaced by Lauchlan Mackinnon, by-election December 1852"]}, {"page": "James Johnston (Australian politician)", "response": ["Johnston was elected one of the first representatives of the City of Melbourne in the Legislative Council, then the only chamber, John O'Shanassy and William Westgarth being his colleagues. About this time he went into partnership with Edward Wilson in a cattle station near Dandenong, Victoria but the venture did not pay, and the partnership was dissolved, Johnston persuading Wilson to take to literary pursuits. Subsequently the two purchased the Melbourne Argus in equal co-partnership. The new venture did not at first pay better than the cattle station, and in 1852 Johnston sold his share to James Gill, who resold it to Lauchlan Mackinnon, whose interests Johnston subsequently represented in the management of the Argus when Mackinnon went to Europe."]}, {"page": "Electoral district of Belfast and Warrnambool", "response": ["| Lauchlan Mackinnon"]}, {"page": "Electoral district of Port Phillip", "response": ["| rowspan = 2 | Lauchlan Mackinnon", "Lauchlan Mackinnon and John Foster resigned in May 1850."]}, {"page": "List of mayors of Hawthorn, Victoria", "response": ["|4 ||  Lauchlan Mackinnon ||1864-1865"]}, {"page": "Lachlan Mackinnon (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Lauchlan Mackinnon (1817\u20131888), an Australian pastoralist, politician and newspaper proprietor"]}, {"page": "Lauchlan", "response": ["*Lauchlan Mackinnon (1817\u20131888), pastoralist, politician and newspaper proprietor in colonial Australia"]}, {"page": "List of New South Wales Legislative Council by-elections 1845-1856", "response": ["| John Foster &Lauchlan Mackinnon"]}, {"page": "Members of multiple Australian legislatures", "response": ["| rowspan=\"2\"|Lauchlan Mackinnon || align=center style=\"background:#009DC4|NSW || Port Phillip: 1848-1850 ||  || rowspan=\"2\"| NSW Parliament, Former Members: Lauchlan MackinnonParliament of Victoria, Remember Database: Lauchlan Mackinnon"]}]}}
