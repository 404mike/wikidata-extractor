He served as a junior minister in Margaret Thatcher's governments at the Departments of Employment, Trade and Defence. He became a member of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom in 1991.\nHe was the author of several books of military history, including his controversial work The Donkeys (1961), which inspired the musical satire Oh, What a Lovely War!\nClark became known for his flamboyance, wit, irreverence and keen support of animal rights. Norman Lamont called him \"the most politically incorrect, outspoken, iconoclastic and reckless politician of our times\". Clark is particularly remembered for his three-volume Alan Clark Diaries, which contains a candid account of political life under Thatcher and a moving description of the weeks preceding his death, when he continued to write until he could no longer focus on the page.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 13", "response": ["*1928 \u2013 Alan Clark, English historian and politician, Minister of State for Trade (d. 1999)"]}, {"page": "Roy Jenkins", "response": ["In March 1982 he fought the Glasgow Hillhead by-election, in what had previously been a Conservative-held seat.

Sometimes the criticism is more against the generation of British generals which he is deemed to represent, a view aired by writers such as John Laffin (British Butchers and Bunglers of World War One) and John Mosier (Myth of the Great War). Alan Clark's book The Donkeys (1961) led to the popularisation of the controversial phrase 'lions led by donkeys', which was used to describe British generalship. Clark attributed this remark to the German generals Max Hoffmann and Erich Ludendorff but later admitted that he lied.Corrigan 2002, p. 213.

He argues that French was an emotional man who was deeply moved by casualties and identified too closely with his soldiers, even in August 1914. Holmes quotes with approval John Terraine's verdict that French was the most distinguished English cavalry leader since Oliver Cromwell,Terraine 1960, p. 30 and argues that although he did not achieve victory, his personality inspired the BEF in 1914 (this was acknowledged at the time by Robertson and by Smith-Dorrien, who informed the King's adviser Wigram (6 November 1914) that in situations where other men would have panicked \"Sir John is unmoved and invariably does the right thing\"). Holmes acknowledges that French's qualities were marred by his \"undisciplined intellect and mercurial personality\", but concludes by quoting Churchill's verdict that \"French, in the sacred fire of leadership, was unsurpassed\".Holmes 2004, pp. 1, 276, 283\u201384, 365\u2013367", "Field Marshal French was played by Laurence Olivier in Richard Attenborough's World War I satire film Oh!

Smithers' The Man Who Disobeyed (a 1970 biography of Smith-Dorrien) kept up some interest in French, he was already becoming a somewhat forgotten figure as popular interest from the 1960s onwards concentrated on the Battle of the Somme, inevitably focussing attention on Douglas Haig.Bond & Cave 2009, pp. 51\u201352"]}, {"page": "Nicholas Budgen", "response": ["Due to his support for a referendum on the question of European integration, James Goldsmith's Referendum Party decided not to run a candidate against him.
