He took up the trumpet aged just 16 in 1944 and his family moved to Stanmore, Middlesex, in 1946.  He organised a new group called the 'Stanmore Stompers' a year later in 1947.\nHe is probably best known for his work with his own seven piece group 'The Delta Jazzmen'. He led this group from 1948 to 1974 and again in the 1990s.  He moved to Spain briefly in the mid-1960s.\nVery little recorded output exists during his lifetime of playing except for two albums worth of material, one of which was entitled Mike on Mike from 1960.  However, there exists some well recorded performances by the Delta Jazzmen which featured Daniels from 1958 to 1963, along with additional input from trombone player Gordon Blundy and John Barnes on reed instruments.  The rhythm section is accompanied on these works by banjo-tuba-drums.  Daniels was regarded as an ensemble-orientated player who provided a solid lead combined with laid-back solos.  The British Lake Label produced 'Limited Edition' recordings of Daniels' work.\nDaniels' aspired to reproduce the original styles of King Oliver, Jelly Roll Morton, Louis Armstrong and others as authentically as possible during live performance.Some of his other bands have featured talents such as Keith Nichols and John Chilton.He died on 18 October 2016 at the age of 88.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Beryl Bryden", "response": ["In May 1949 Bryden formed her own group called Beryl\u2019s Back-Room Boys and later worked with Mike Daniels.

After settling in London in the 1950s he worked with Bobby Mickleburgh, Mick Mulligan, Chris  Barber, Mike Daniels and Ken Colyer during that decade. A further move to Bromsgrove in 1960 meant that he played more in the Midlands. In the 1960s he was part of Ken Ingram's Band and Eddie Matthews' Jump Band. In the following decade he freelanced, led his own quintet, and played in Europe with Rod Mason. Foxley returned to Colyer in 1986, and stayed with the Ken Colyer Trust Band until 1994, following the leader's death. In the same decade, he also freelanced and led his own band. He also gave solo performances throughout his career. Much of what he played was traditional jazz, but he \"was also admired by avant-gardists like sopranoist Lol Coxhill and percussionist Roger Turner\".
