Note that some sources, such as a note in the personnel file, give him as taking command of the division in April 1915. This made him the first New Zealand officer to command a division in the war.Clayton. On 18 February 1915, he was formally transferred to the British Army,Letter of 1 February 1965, Maj. E. E. Andrews; in personnel file and promoted to major general. The 20th Division moved to France in July 1915, and he commanded it during a minor operation in September, but handed over command on 8 March 1916 due to ill-health.Inglefield, pp. 7, 15\u201323, & 44. Clayton refers to him being sent to England in \"late 1916\", which appears to be an error. He was appointed to command a reserve centre at Cannock Chase, Staffordshire, where the arrival of elements of the New Zealand Rifle Brigade in September 1917 meant that he once again had the opportunity to command his own countrymen.Appendix III,  He was relieved of command by General Robert Wanless O'Gowan in March 1918,Obituary of General O'Gowan, The Times, 17 December 1947. Appendix III of Austin confirms that O'Gowan directly succeeded Davies. and on 9 May 1918, after a prolonged period of physical and mental ill health, he committed suicide at the Special Neurological Hospital for Officers, Kensington.Bourne; see also Biographical Note by Maj. E. E. Andrews in personnel file.
