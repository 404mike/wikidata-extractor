He was defeated at the 1924 general election by the Liberal Party candidate Walter Runciman, but at the 1929 general election Ruciman stood instead in St Ives and Samuel regained the seat. In 1931, when Labour had split over its leader Ramsay MacDonald's decision to leave the party and form a Conservative Party-dominated National Government, he faced only one opponent, the Liberal National candidate Lewis Jones, who took the seat.  Samuel did not stand for Parliament again.", "link_mentions": []}}
