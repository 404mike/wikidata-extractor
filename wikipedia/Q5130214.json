This did not last long however, and, due to Southport's ability to concede late goals in most games, the club looked certain to drop down a league, however again doubts were cast as the club won 4 matches on the run, and with two matches left were only two points off safety. However these matches were against play off hopefuls York City and Exeter City. After losing to a Clayton Donaldson penalty against York, the Sandgrounders were relegated the following Tuesday, not even playing a game, after relegation rivals Grays and Halifax both won their games."]}, {"page": "Kevin O'Connor (footballer, born 1982)", "response": ["Under new manager Uwe R\u00f6sler, O'Connor began the 2011\u201312 season mostly as a substitute and suffered a serious ankle injury in a 1\u20130 FA Cup first round win over Basingstoke Town on 12 November. He had made 18 appearances and scored two goals before the injury ended his season. O'Connor returned to the team in time for the start of the 2012\u201313 season and featured regularly as a substitute. After making 11 appearances, he suffered a serious leg and ankle injury while falling in a tackle in a 1\u20130 victory over Portsmouth on 6 November 2012 and it was determined that he would be out for six months. O'Connor signed a new one-year contract in March 2013. He returned to the first team on 16 April 2013, as a substitute for Lee Hodson after 66 minutes of a pulsating 2\u20132 draw with Sheffield United, a game which saw Tony Craig and Clayton Donaldson sent off for Brentford. Craig's three match suspension began on Brentford's penultimate game of the season against Hartlepool United.
