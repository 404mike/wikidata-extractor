She also made some music recordings beginning in 1906.  In 1910, she played the leading role of Selene in W. S. Gilbert's last opera, Fallen Fairies and sang at the Royal Opera House the same year and thereafter.  She played Princess Helena in A Waltz Dream at Daly's Theatre in 1911.\nAfter Evans married Scottish baritone Fraser Gange in 1917, the two frequently performed together in concert and on tour, moving to the United States in 1923.  In 1975, at age 91, Evans gave her last performance.  Living to the age of 98, she was one of the last surviving cast members of a W. S.
