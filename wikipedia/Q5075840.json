Frederick William Robertson started visiting and walking there.  He remarked \"I was pleased to hear not a single human soul far or near ... above there were a few dense clouds, edged with light, sailing across a marvellous blue ... I heard nothing but the sea, falling with a most dissonant, heavy, endless clang upon the shore\".  At the time the area was much more extensive: graves ran beyond the present south wall on the site of Church Road.  The churchyard gained another  in 1858, but even this was filled soon afterwards.  Further burials were prohibited from 1883, by which time Hove Cemetery was open.  With the churchyard's importance diminished, a controversial plan to reduce its size at the southern end and extend Church Road through it was announced in 1895.  Work began in July of that year, and more than 300 bodies were dug up and moved to Hove Cemetery.  Many of the gravestones and memorials were destroyed during this work.  The northern section became overgrown and unsafe, and in 1972  were dug up and built over when a new school was built.  As before, many gravestones were destroyed, although the family tomb of Charles Brownlow, 2nd Baron Lurgan and four relatives was saved and re-erected in Hove Cemetery.  During the 1980s, a new parish hall was built near the church, and more land was taken from the churchyard.  In 2002, a section alongside the north wall was created for the burial of cremated remains."]}, {"page": "William Brownlow, 3rd Baron Lurgan", "response": ["He was the eldest son of Charles Brownlow, 2nd Baron Lurgan.
