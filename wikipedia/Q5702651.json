He had been singing at Charlie Murphy's Anawanda (Democratic) Club, for a Ladies' Night with a good party. On his walk home, he thought to himself that he sang everyone else's tunes, and he should write one of his own. He couldn't think of anything on his long walk home, but during the night the tune and theme came to him - from the walk itself. The next day, he went downtown to John Golden's hat store, where Blake worked, and hummed the melody for him. The melody was very similar to an 1892 song called \"Daisy Bell (Bicycle Built for Two)\" by British composer Harry Dacre. Blake took a liking to the 3/4 tune, and had Lawlor repeat it several times. \"You get the music on paper,\" he told Lawlor, \"and I'll write the words for it.\" Lawlor returned to the store in about twenty minutes with the musical notes written, and Blake was halfway through the lyrics, having been interrupted by a customer. He finished the words in another half-hour. The tune and words became familiar and well known throughout New York City. It was first made famous by Lottie Gilson, and it had staying power because the melody was catchy and easy to sing."]}, {"page": "List of music featured on Doctor Who", "response": ["| \"Daisy Bell\" || Penny Lister || The Talons of Weng-Chiang || By Harry Dacre.
