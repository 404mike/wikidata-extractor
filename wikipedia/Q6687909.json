Hammond argued that the inquiry, as well as prior investigations, clouded and influenced the story of the battle for over 30 years. Hammond wrote, \"Jeudwine's division was exhausted and considerably weakened in numbers and ought to have been relieved\" prior to the German counter-attack. Furthermore, the \"initial German bombardment was so violent many front-line defenders had little or no opportunity to defend themselves before they were overwhelmed\" by the rapid German advance, but acquitted themselves well where they could. Watson wrote that the division's \"exhaustion caused by the heavy fighting and appalling conditions\" was the reason for their conduct. The historian Tim Travers wrote that the reasons for the success of the German counter-attack \"are not hard to find, and they principally relate to command failures on the part of GHQ and Third Army, who did not anticipate the attack, believing the Germans not to be capable of a major effort\". Jeudwine warned of the attack, but VII Corps failed to co-ordinate their defence with flanking units. Travers wrote, \"when the warnings of the attack came from 55 Division, these warnings ran into greater and greater resistance the higher they went. Hence, the divisional level was caught in the inability of the corps and army structures to communicate with each other.\" The use of infiltration tactics by the Germans was also ignored. Smithers wrote the inquiry blamed junior officers and below, holding \"no officer of field rank or above ... to blame for anything\". Smithers mused \"one cannot wonder at the contempt this document excited once its contents became known\" and wrote that Louis Oldfield (a senior officer within the 51st (Highland) Division) \"probably spoke for everybody ..: 'The result of the Cambrai inquiry is very misleading and discreditable. Someone ought to be kicked\"."]}, {"page": "Leopold Oldfield", "response": ["#REDIRECT Louis Oldfield"]}, {"page": "1934 Birthday Honours", "response": ["* Major-General Leopold Charles Louis Oldfield, , Retd. pay (late Royal Artillery), late General Officer Commanding, Malaya."]}, {"page": "1919 Birthday Honours", "response": ["*Lt.-Col. and Bt.
