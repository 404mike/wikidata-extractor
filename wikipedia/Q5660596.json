He became a demonstrator at the college in 1919 and reader in physical chemistry in 1937. He was secretary of the Royal College of Science 1940\u201344 and of the Royal Institute of Chemistry 1944\u201363. He was made a fellow of Imperial College in 1949 and an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1962.Ellingham is best known for his diagrams plotting the Gibbs energy change for the reaction\n\n2x\u2044y\u2009M + O2 \u21cc 2\u2044y\u2009MxOyagainst temperature. By normalizing the thermodynamic functions to the reaction with one mole of oxygen, Ellingham was able to compare the temperature stability of many different oxides on the same diagram. In particular, he could show graphically that carbon becomes a stronger reducing agent as the temperature increases. The reduction of metal oxides with carbon (or carbon monoxide) to form the free metals is of immense industrial importance (e.g., the manufacture of iron in a blast furnace), and Ellingham diagrams show the lowest temperature at which the reaction will occur for each metal.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Bockris", "response": ["Bockris relates that his supervisor, Harold Ellingham, provided minimal guidance and soon left the university altogether.

This analysis is usually used to evaluate the ease of reduction of metal oxides and sulfides. These diagrams were first constructed by Harold Ellingham in 1944.. In metallurgy, the Ellingham diagram is used to predict the equilibrium temperature between a metal, its oxide, and oxygen \u2014 and by extension, reactions of a metal with sulfur, nitrogen, and other non-metals. The diagrams are useful in predicting the conditions under which an ore will be reduced to its metal. The analysis is thermodynamic in nature and ignores reaction kinetics. Thus, processes that are predicted to be favourable by the Ellingham diagram can still be slow."]}]}}
