He was a close friend of Robert Burns and is reputed to have built his coffin in 1796. He is also the subject of a famous poem by Burns, later set to music called \"John Anderson My Jo, John.\"\nHe is buried in Kilchuimen Burial Ground, Fort Augustus with a Scottish Heritage plaque. It mentions that his son in law was killed in the wreck of an early British passenger steamship, PS Comet II, near Gourock in 1825.\nThe heritage plaque reads:\n\"John Anderson. My Jo.\nFriend of Robert Burns\nCharacter of one of the most touching of Burns Songs. Gifted by the family of the late Norman Watters\nPast President of Bowhill People's Burns Club\"\nThe stone reads:\n\"Sacred to the memory of\nJohn Anderson who died at Invergarry\nthe 4 May 1832 Aged 84 years\nalso his daughter Catherine who died at Invergarry the 20 December 1832 aged 52 years\nRelict of the late\nJames Grierson who was lost in the \"Comet\" off Gourack Point the 20 Oct 1825\nThis stone is erected by their affectionate children.\"\nDespite the claim recorded in the heritage plaque above,  Burns' poem is based on an earlier poem of the same title and metre:\nJohn Anderson, my jo, John\nI wonder what you mean\nTo lie sae lang in the morning\nAnd sit sae late at e'en ...................\nThe earlier version was extant c.1744,  and is a mildly bawdy ballad in which the wife berates John for his waning performance in bed,  recalls his former ardour,  and threatens him with the cuckold's horns if he doesn't deliver:\n........... But 'tis a mickle finer thing\nTo see your hurdies fyke\nTo see your hurdies fyke, John\nAnd hit the rising blow\n'Tis then I like your chanter pipe\nJohn Anderson, my jo.\nThe editors of the Canongate Burns (2001) offer no explanation for Burns's adaptation of the old song of six stanzas into a two verse celebration of love into old age (Burns himself died at the age of 37).", "link_mentions": {}}}
