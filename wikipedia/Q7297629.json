He became famous for an apparent notable act of bravery in which he reportedly saved Buckingham Palace from being hit by German bombing, when he used his Hawker Hurricane to destroy a Dornier Do 17 bomber over London by ramming. He was feted by the press as a war hero for his saving of the Palace. However, this has come to become regarded as a much disputed legend.  Holmes became a King's Messenger after the war, and died at the age of 90 in 2005.", "link_mentions": {}}}
