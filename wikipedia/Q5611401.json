These performances are accomplished by the individual in an unconscious manner, and one might suggest that this memory carried in gestures and habits, is more authentic than 'indirect' memory via inscribing.", "The influence of memory is made obvious in the way the past is experienced in present conditions, for \u2013 according to Paul Connerton, for instance \u2013 it can never be eliminated from human practice.
