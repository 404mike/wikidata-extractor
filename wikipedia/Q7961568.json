One of her works (from the so-called Filmer Album) depicts a drawing room, painted in watercolour, in which she has added photographic cut-outs from albumen silver prints. She positions herself next to a large figure of the Prince of Wales, with whom she was known to flirt. Her albums and glue pot are set out on a large table beside her. Much smaller, Sir Edmund Filmer, her husband, is seated next to a pet dog. In 2010, the work was included in an exhibition at the Art Institute of Chicago, which traveled to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, titled \"Playing With Pictures: The Art of Victorian Photocollage\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Filmer", "response": ["*Mary Georgina Filmer (n\u00e9e Cecil; 1838\u20131903), British photographic collage artist"]}, {"page": "Frances Jocelyn, Viscountess Jocelyn", "response": ["Women were among the first to engage in the emerging field of photography, whose flexibility, when compared to other art forms, allowed women more freedom to engage in subject matter that interested them, since there was no hierarchy or body of regulations that governed their work. Most women photographers focused on domesticity, choosing to feature their families in an array of images. Keeping within this trend, Lady Jocelyn produced a series of albums in the 1850s. Her photographic collages \u2013 collections of cut-up images inserted onto painted backdrops \u2013 and use of watercolours \"subverted the realistic nature of photography,\" according to the Encyclopaedia of Nineteenth-century Photography.

Many institutions recognize these works as memorabilia for hobbyists, though they functioned as a facilitator of Victorian aristocratic collective portraiture, proof of female erudition, and presented a new mode of artistic representation that questioned the way in which photography is truthful.
