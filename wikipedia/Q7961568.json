One of her works (from the so-called Filmer Album) depicts a drawing room, painted in watercolour, in which she has added photographic cut-outs from albumen silver prints. She positions herself next to a large figure of the Prince of Wales, with whom she was known to flirt. Her albums and glue pot are set out on a large table beside her. Much smaller, Sir Edmund Filmer, her husband, is seated next to a pet dog. In 2010, the work was included in an exhibition at the Art Institute of Chicago, which traveled to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, titled \"Playing With Pictures: The Art of Victorian Photocollage\".\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
