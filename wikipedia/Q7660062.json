Towards the end of 1888, Bland was selected for the Welsh game to face the touring New Zealand Natives played at St. Helen's Ground, Swansea. The Welsh players experienced a hostile home crowd during the match due to the lack of Swansea players in the squad;Smith (1972), pg 17. but after trialing the four three-quarter system again, were able to beat the M\u0101ori opposition by a goal and two tries to nil.
