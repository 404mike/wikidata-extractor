The highlight of his career after retirement was his co-founding, with Martin Dent of Keele University, of the Jubilee 2000 Drop the Debt campaign, which went on to become the Make Poverty History movement.\nHe studied Greats at Balliol College, Oxford, but his studies were interrupted by World War II when he saw active service with the 9th Ghurkha rifles. After the war he completed his undergraduate studies in 1948 and went on to further study at the LSE and SOAS. Peters then joined the Colonial Service with a posting to the Gold Coast in 1950 where he worked to prepare for the transition to independence. In 1977, he became British Ambassador to Uruguay. He went on to work as High Commissioner in Malawi before retiring from the Foreign Office in 1983.\nA few years after retirement Peters met Martin Dent of Keele University and realised that Martin shared his concern at what they considered to be unsustainable levels of third world debt. They co-founded a campaign to write off third-world debt in time for the Millennium. They called this Jubilee 2000 in reference to the Old Testament Jubilee requirement to cancel debts every seven years. It was supported by the Anglican Church, with the Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, addressing a rally in Trafalgar Square with Bill and Martin and making Jubilee 2000 the subject of his New Year's Day Millennium address on BBC 1.UK Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown also spoke at a rally in St Paul's Cathedral, strongly supporting the campaign and confirming the cancellation of all debts to the UK. Peters continued to play an active role in the Drop the Debt campaign in the lead up to the Millennium, seeing it grow into a series of large- scale demonstrations and twice enter The Guinness Book Of Records, once for the largest petition and once for the most international petition. The campaign launched major demonstrations at every G8 summit from 1998 in Birmingham to Cologne and Genoa with a few people even travelling to Okinawa in Japan.\nPeters received the Gandhi International Peace Award from the Gandhi Foundation in recognition of his efforts and of the success of the Jubilee 2000 campaign, which 'made possible the provision of basic education and health-care to thousands of people.'He died on 23 March 2014.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jubilee 2000", "response": ["The idea was first articulated by Martin Dent, a retired lecturer in politics at the University of Keele, who with his friend, retired diplomat William Peters, linked the biblical Jubilee to a modern debt relief programme and founded the Jubilee 2000 campaign in the early 1990s."]}, {"page": "List of people associated with the London School of Economics", "response": ["* William Peters, High Commissioner in Malawi"]}, {"page": "1923 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["** William Peters, diplomat and activist (died 2014)"]}, {"page": "William Peters", "response": ["William Peters may refer to:", "*William Peters (Australian politician) (1903\u20131978), member of the New South Wales Legislative Council", "*William Peters (lawyer) (1702\u20131786), American lawyer and judge from Philadelphia", "*William Peters (painter) (1742\u20131814), British painter", "*William Peters (journalist) (1921\u20132007), American journalist and documentary filmmaker", "*William Peters (South African politician), Mayor of Cape Town from 1963 to 1965", "*William Peters (sport shooter), Colombian Olympic shooter", "*William Peters (diplomat) (1923\u20132014), British diplomat and founder of Jubilee 2000"]}, {"page": "List of ambassadors of the United Kingdom to Uruguay", "response": ["*1977\u20131980: William Peters"]}, {"page": "Peters (surname)", "response": ["*William Peters (painter) (1742\u20131814), British painter", "*William Peters (lawyer) (1702\u20131786), American lawyer and judge from Philadelphia", "*William Peters (Australian politician) (1903\u20131978), Australian (New South Wales) politician", "*William Peters (diplomat) (1923\u20132014), British diplomat and founder of Jubilee 2000", "*William Peters (sport shooter) (fl. 1956), Colombian Olympic shooter", "*William Peters (journalist) (1921\u20132007), American journalist and documentary filmmaker"]}, {"page": "List of High Commissioners of the United Kingdom to Malawi", "response": ["*1980\u20131983: William Peters"]}, {"page": "1981 New Year Honours", "response": ["*William Peters, M.V.O., British High Commissioner, Lilongwe.
