Kate Chopin's The Awakening (1899) also deserves mention, especially within the context of narratives derived from Flaubert's Madame Bovary (1856), both of which chronicle a woman's doomed search for independence and self-realization through sexual experimentation."]}, {"page": "Crosse", "response": ["* Victoria Crosse, a pseudonym of novelist Annie Sophie Cory (1868\u20131952)"]}]}}
