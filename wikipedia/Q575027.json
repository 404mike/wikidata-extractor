Initially a member of the Conservative Party, he crossed the floor to join the UK Independence Party (UKIP) in September 2014. He has since changed parties a further three times.\nWhile a member of the House of Commons, Reckless was noted for his rebelliousness; he cast 56 votes against the whip between 2010 and 2014, making him the 13th most rebellious Conservative Party MP in the period. He led a rebellion of 53 Conservative MPs on the EU budget, which inflicted the first House of Commons defeat on the coalition government. From November 2010, he served as a member of the Home Affairs Select Committee. After crossing the floor, he won re-election as a UKIP MP in a by-election held in November 2014 but lost his seat to the Conservatives at the 2015 general election.\nA Eurosceptic, Reckless was elected to the National Assembly for Wales, later known as the Senedd, in 2016. He campaigned to leave the European Union in the 2016 EU membership referendum. He subsequently left UKIP to join the Conservative Group in the National Assembly before joining the Brexit Party in 2019 when he was appointed its leader in the National Assembly by Nigel Farage. On 19 October 2020, he joined the Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party; the party lost both of its seats in the 2021 Senedd Election.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "December 6", "response": ["*  1970   \u2013 Mark Reckless, English politician"]}, {"page": "Columbia Business School", "response": ["* Mark Reckless, MBA 1999, UK Independence Party politician; Member of parliament for Rochester and Strood"]}, {"page": "UK Independence Party", "response": ["UKIP gained its first MP when Conservative defector Douglas Carswell won the seat of Clacton during an October 2014 by-election.\"UKIP gains first elected MP with Clacton win\" , BBC News.
