Lincoln approached the game using their players in numbers to Burnley's tactics. In the first half, both rams had chances with Lincoln's Jack Muldoon shooting over the crossbar and Burnley's Andre Gray getting a shot on target but it was saved by Lincoln goalkeeper Paul Farman. The first half finished 0\u20130. During the second half, there was a contest between Burnley's Joey Barton and Lincoln's Matt Rhead which eventually ended up in a brawl inside Lincoln's penalty area when Rhead claimed Barton had stamped on him and then Barton pushed Terry Hawkridge in the face and received a yellow card for it. Lincoln then started putting crosses into Burnley's penalty area. Eventually Lincoln scored on 89 minutes with their first and only shot on target of the game due to a header from Sean Raggett, which was confirmed via goal-line technology. Burnley responded with a number of attacks during five minutes of stoppage time, forcing Lincoln to defend a number of shots and corner kicks however Lincoln held on for the win becoming the first non-league side in 103 years to reach the FA Cup quarter-finals.
