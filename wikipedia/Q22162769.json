The squad was boosted by the arrivals of Ted Collins and Jack Needham, who signed after their club Wolverhampton Wanderers shut down operations. The pair \"showed their true regard for the game\" by turning up to play Stockport County on 16 September despite working until 6 am earlier that day; however former Valeite Bob Suart inspired County to a 5\u20133 win. Two more draws followed, including a 0\u20130 draw at Stoke, though this was then followed by five defeats in six games. The 13th game of the campaign proved unlucky for visitors Blackpool, as Vale recorded their first victory by a remarkable 11\u20131 scoreline, with Jack Needham, Holford, James Wootton, Albert Broadhurst and George Shelton all claiming two goals each, supplemented by a single strike for Albert Groves. They then beat Oldham Athletic 4\u20130, before dropping into a losing streak of seven defeats in nine games to prove the Blackpool result as an anomaly as the club dropped to last place. They recovered to lose only three of their final eight games, though the final day victory over Manchester United proved \"a farce\" as the visitors only turned up with four players and had to loan the other seven to make up a full team. Vale finished in 15th-place with 21 points from 30 games, whilst Needham finished as top-scorer with ten goals."]}, {"page": "1918\u201319 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["With Tom Holford largely unavailable, Jock Cameron was promoted to captain and team manager. The squad had to be made up largely of players available and willing to play, with only the Pearson brothers (Harry and Albert) offering much in the way of continuity from the previous campaign. The team started with a four-game unbeaten run, only to pick up one point from their next six games. The poor run included an embarrassing 8\u20131 defeat by Stoke at the Old Recreation Ground. The war was drawing to a close, ending on 11 November, but not before claiming the lives of Bob Suart and Jack Shelton. Vale beat bottom-club Burnley 4\u20132 five days later, and began to be strengthened by first-team players who returned from their wartime duties \u2013 as were every other club however. From this point Vale began winning their home games but losing their away matches, ending this run with a 2\u20130 win over Preston North End at Deepdale on 18 January \u2013 the first away win of the campaign. A sign of things returning to normal was the sale of Albert Pearson to Liverpool in January."]}]}}
