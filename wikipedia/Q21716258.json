Gerard Baker of The Wall Street Journal spoke highly of the piece, stating that \"Today's performers mostly fall over each other to demonstrate new establishment bona fides.

They're barely breathing.\" He continued by praising the performance: \"[Chappelle] is, in that sense, a true comic\u2014one of extraordinary talent and sophistication.\" D. Watkins of Salon, in a positive review, felt that \"dismissing Chappelle's work as simply or obstinately regressive is not unlike seeing the world through the same lens as\" a Comedy Central network executive who, according to Chappelle, told him that he couldn't say a slur against gay people despite allowing him to routinely use a slur against black people. The forthrightness of Chappelle was appreciated by reviewers such as Jeremy Jahns who commented specifically that \"I couldn't help but appreciate the fact that, well, this guy will do it; he'll go there.\" Jordan Ruimy of World of Reel opined that \"It's an act of sheer chutzpah from Chappelle, but it works as the jokes aren\u2019t only funny but come with a biting sting\", while stating Chappelle's piece feels \"immediate, a plea from one of our very best comedians to his own audience to stop the hysteria.\""]}, {"page": "Timeline of investigations into Donald Trump and Russia (July\u2013December 2017)", "response": ["** In an Oval Office interview with The Wall Street Journals Gerard Baker, Trump states that there was \"nobody on the campaign that saw anybody from Russia\"."]}, {"page": "Capitalism in America", "response": ["Critics found the presentation of ideas engaging, The Times columnist Gerard Baker calling it a \"compelling and well-documented single-volume history.\" Meyerinck attributed it to the author's ability to condense several sources and documents in a \"very well written\" book, and Publishers Weekly credited it to the fast pace at which its several \"fun facts\" were presented. Skousen and American economist Deirdre McCloskey analogized the content as \"spark[ling]\" with quotes and statistics, \"a stylistic device that academic histories often overlook\". For McCloskey and British philosopher Alan Ryan, the most exciting-to-read parts of the book were its biographies and entrepreneurs and innovators. Wrote Ryan, \"The bare recital of their names is enough to conjure up an image of a world remaking itself, taking on the form it still essentially possess.\" Also brought up was the book's ability to present complex ideas in a manner accessible to all readers. British economist Diane Coyle argued the book successfully makes it case \"with some wonderful insights into business history\"."]}]}}
