He joined Championship club Stoke City on loan in August 2007 and made an instant impact scoring on his debut against Cardiff City. His good form prompted Stoke to pay Manchester United \u00a31 million in January 2008 to keep him at the Britannia Stadium. He formed a good defensive partnership with Leon Cort as Stoke gained promotion to the Premier League for the first time, ending 23 years away from the top flight.\nDespite making a bad start to Premier League football, Shawcross established himself as first-choice centre-back along with Abdoulaye Faye. Stoke comfortably stayed up, and after another mid-table finish in 2009\u201310, Shawcross was handed the captaincy by manager Tony Pulis ahead of the 2010\u201311 season. With Faye drifting out of the team, Robert Huth became Shawcross's defensive partner and the team reached the 2011 FA Cup Final, finishing runners-up to Manchester City. The run to the final also meant that Stoke entered the UEFA Europa League in 2011\u201312, and they reached the round of 32 losing to Spanish team Valencia. Shawcross continued to be a regular under Pulis in 2012\u201313 and then under Mark Hughes in 2013\u201314 which saw him win the player of the year award. Shawcross remained at Stoke until February 2021, after making 453 appearances over a 14-year period with the club.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Chester", "response": ["* Ryan Shawcross (born 1987), Stoke City F.C. footballer"]}, {"page": "Buckley, Flintshire", "response": ["*Ryan Shawcross, a professional footballer with Stoke City."]}, {"page": "Ricardo Fuller", "response": ["Fuller scored his first goal of the 2010\u201311 season against Tottenham Hotspur at the Britannia Stadium.

Following the 5\u20130 FA Cup semi-final win over Bolton Wanderers Stoke captain Ryan Shawcross revealed that a speech from Fuller inspired the team.

Pulis sold several key players prior to the 2007\u201308 season; club captain Danny Higginbotham was one of a number of players to depart, joining Sunderland for \u00a33\u00a0million.

In a match against Sunderland, Huth was sent-off for tackling David Meyler, although replays showed that he pulled out of the challenge. Sunderland took full advantage of the extra man and scored the only goal through James McClean. Stoke attempted to have Huth's red card overturned on appeal, but failed in their efforts. Huth scored twice towards the end of the season against Midlands opponents Wolves and Aston Villa respectively.
