There, in a summer calculus course, her talent for mathematics brought her to the attention of Arizona State University mathematics professor Joaqu\u00edn Bustoz, Jr. She went on to undergraduate studies at ASU, originally intending to study engineering, but she was steered to mathematics by Bustoz.  From there, her interest in pure math developed into an interest in mathematical biology when she attended a talk by her future PhD advisor, James D. Murray, on the mathematics of pattern formation and \"how the leopard got its spots.\" She graduated in 1994, and she earned her MS and PhD at the University of Washington in 1996 and 1998."]}]}}
