It acts by being an antagonist of biotin. The oil was used intravenously or intramuscularly in the early part of the 20th-century against leprosy. An ethyl ester of the oil (the \"Ball method\") was developed by Alice Ball in 1916, who died suddenly before publishing the technique. Her work was stolen by Arthur L. Dean who began producing large quantities of the treatment and named it after himself. It was then produced and marketed by Burroughs Wellcome (modern GlaxoSmithKline) in the early 1920s. The oil preparations were used intravenously for leprosy patients, often producing local reactions. The oil was often obtained directly from trees in India, Sri Lanka or Africa. Doctors would locally prepare ethyl esters to treat their patients. In June 1927, Burroughs Wellcome released the commercial preparation, sodium hydnocarpate marketed as Alepol, which produced lesser disagreeable symptoms of pain, swelling, irritating cough and blocking of the veins. In May 1928, doctors reported cure of leprosy in some patients after treatment with alepol. In the 1940s chaulmoogra oil was replaced by the more effective sulfones."]}, {"page": "Index of women scientists articles", "response": ["*Alice Ball"]}, {"page": "December 1916", "response": ["* Died: Alice Ball, American chemist, first African-American woman to practice chemistry, developed an effective drug treatment for leprosy, died from chemical poisoning during her research (b. 1892)"]}, {"page": "History of leprosy", "response": ["Researchers worked to develop less toxic injectable forms of this oil. Merck of Darmstadt had already produced a version of the sodium salts in 1891. They named this sodium gynocardate in the mistaken belief that the origin of the oil was Gynocardia odorata. Bayer in 1908 marketed a commercial version of the esters under the name 'Antileprol'. At the University of Hawaii, the young chemist Alice Ball developed a chemical process that made the oil less hydrophobic and therefore more readily absorbed by the body. Sadly she died before she could see the results of her work: After being treated with the modified oil, 78\u00a0patients were able to return home from leper colonies in 1920. Despite the common side effects and continuing debates about its efficacy, chaulmoogra oil remained the best available treatment for leprosy into the 1940s."]}, {"page": "Alice Augusta Ball", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alice Ball"]}, {"page": "Beebe Steven Lynk", "response": ["* Alice Ball"]}, {"page": "Women in chemistry", "response": ["* Alice Ball (1892\u20131916), American chemist"]}]}}
