His first-class cricket debut came against Middlesex at Folkestone on 9 July and he played again in the county's following fixture against Surrey at Blackheath. The trial was not a success and these were Foster's only first-class appearances. He played twice for the Army team in 1934 against the Public Schools. His Wisden obituary describes him as a \"good stylist\" who was \"quick on his feet, with a beautiful pair of wrists\" when playing at school.After retiring from the army with the rank of captain, Foster died at Edenbridge, Kent, in November 1976, aged 71.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
