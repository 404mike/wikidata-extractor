Willis pointed out, using the  dazzle scheme as an example, that different mechanisms could have been at work. The contradictory patterns on the ship's funnels could imply the ship was on a different heading (as Wilkinson had said). The curve on the hull below the front funnel could seem to be a false bow wave, creating a misleading impression of the ship's speed. And the striped patterns at bow and stern could create confusion about which end of the ship was which."]}, {"page": "HMS Temeraire (1798)", "response": ["The Fighting Temeraire is a historical narrative written by Sam Willis and details the \"extraordinary story of the mighty Temeraire, the ship behind J.

Wishing to be as inconspicuous as possible, the French ships probably did not follow this practice. The French ships had all been issued with sealed orders, which they were to open on passing the Strait of Gibraltar; these instructed them that the fleet was to rendezvous at C\u00e1diz. Knowing they had been observed by the British, La Clue changed his plan. Instead of heading for C\u00e1diz, where he feared he could be easily blockaded by the British, he decided to sail more westerly, to clear Cape St. Vincent and head into the North Atlantic. However, the French navy did not have an effective system of night signalling. So at about midnight La Clue had his flagship, Oc\u00e9an, light her stern lantern, turn to port (left, or westward) and reduce her speed. Normally, such actions would be accompanied by firing a cannon to draw attention. The naval historian Sam Willis suggests it is possible that La Cluewho had been ordered to avoid battle at all costsknowing the entire fleet was relatively close and not wishing to advertise his manoeuvre to the British, omitted to do this."]}, {"page": "Battle of Ramree Island", "response": ["The British official history (War against Japan volume IV, The Reconquest of Burma, 1965 [2004]) referred only to \"crocodile-infested mangrove swamps\".
