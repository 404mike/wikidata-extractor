It was a frustrating affair over the course of 10 days. Shooting was done first thing in the morning and at sunset in order to capture the light at dawn and dusk, but the desired effect was never achieved due to constant rain and clouds. The photos of the two children were taken in black and white and were multi-printed to create the effect of 11 individuals that can be seen on the album cover. The results were unsatisfactory, but some accidental tinting effects in post-production created a suitable cover. The inner gatefold photograph was taken at Dunluce Castle nearby the Causeway. In February 2010, Stefan Gates was featured on a BBC Radio 4 documentary about the cover. He said there was something sinister about the image, though his sister disagreed. He also admitted never having heard the album. The programme ended with Gates returning to Giant's Causeway and listening to the album on a portable player, after which he said that a great weight had been lifted from him.", "* Stefan Gates' Cover Story (BBC programme about the album cover)"]}, {"page": "School Library Association", "response": ["* 2013 \u2013 Incredible Edibles by Stefan Gates, illustrated by Georgia Glynn (Walker Books, )"]}, {"page": "Cooking in the Danger Zone", "response": ["Cooking in the Danger Zone is a documentary television series produced by the BBC and presented by Stefan Gates.", "* Stefan Gates' website"]}, {"page": "Merrilees Parker", "response": ["In 2006, Parker co-presented Food Uncut on UKTV Food with Stefan Gates and Jean-Christophe Novelli.

Bear Grylls calls it \"a great survival food\" and describes how vast quantities are caught and turned into kunga cake.

She cites an example of how Chaoborus edulis swarms form near Lake Malawi and how the local people turn them into kunga cakes as a \"rich source of protein\" which is eaten \"with great enthusiasm\".
