He joined the university staff in 1959. He established a BA (Hons) course in Typography & Graphic Communication which eventually grew into its own department in 1974. Both the programme and the department are widely acknowledged to be the first of their kind in the world. He retired from full-time teaching in 1998 but still teaches postgraduate students and is also the Director of the Centre for Ephemera Studies. \nHe has been a visiting teacher at Rare Book Schools in Virginia, Lyons, Wellington and Melbourne. For many years he has served as Vice-President of the Printing Historical Society and in 2016 he succeeded Asa Briggs as President of the Ephemera Society.\nTwyman is often cited for his works on the history of printing and ephemera, especially lithography. In addition, he is well known for his writings on the theory of graphic language. He also completed and edited Maurice Rickards' book Encyclopedia of Ephemera (London: British Library, 2000). He was an early member of the Printing Historical Society and has edited and contributed to issues of its Journal.\nIn 1983 he was awarded the Samuel Pepys Medal for Outstanding Contribution to Ephemera Studies 1983 and in 2014 the Sir Misha Black award and was added to the College of Medallists.Twyman is not to be confused with Toronto lawyer and conservative thinker Michael Tweyman of Toronto, Ontario.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Phillips (geologist)", "response": ["Phillips was born at Marden in Wiltshire. His father belonged to an old Welsh family, but settled in England as an officer of excise and married the sister of William Smith, a renowned English geologist. When both parents died when he was a child, Phillips's custody was assumed by Smith and Phillips was brought into Smith's London home during early 1815. During the next few years he attended various schools and helped his uncle with his geological research and writing; he also developed an interest in lithography (printing from prepared slabs of stone), and was among the earliest English practitioners of the process, experimenting with it between about 1816 and 1819.Michael Twyman, editor, John Phillips's lithographic notebook: reproduced in facsimile from the original at the Oxford Museum of Natural History. London: Printing Historical Society, 2016. After ending school, Phillips accompanied Smith on his wanderings in connection with his preparation of geological maps. During the spring of 1824 Smith went to York to deliver a course of lectures on geology, and his nephew Phillips accompanied him. Phillips accepted engagements in the principal Yorkshire towns to arrange their museums and give courses of lectures on the collections contained therein. York became his residence, and he obtained during 1826 the situation of keeper of the Yorkshire Museum and secretary of the Yorkshire Philosophical Society at the same time as Henry Robinson was Librarian of the YPS.", "*John Phillips's lithographic notebook: reproduced in facsimile from the original at Oxford University Museum of Natural History, edited by Michael Twyman.
