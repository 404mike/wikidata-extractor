When Coalition Liberal MP Alexander Lyle-Samuel made a speech criticising reparations from Germany and supported the League of Nations, Croft claimed that although Lyle-Samuel sat for a Suffolk constituency, he might well sit for Wurtemburg or Bavaria in Germany.McCallum, p. 41. The Gladstonian liberal, R. B. McCallum, said Croft \"was the authentic voice of triumphant, nationalist Toryism ... [he] represented the crude, philistine spirit of John Bullish nationalism. He was speaking for millions\"."]}, {"page": "List of Liberal Party (UK) MPs", "response": ["* Alexander Lyle-Samuel, Eye, 1918\u20131923"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1918 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Alexander Lyle-Samuel"]}, {"page": "Eye (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Alexander Lyle-Samuel"]}, {"page": "Crewe (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["*Liberal candidate, Alexander Lyle-Samuel withdrew."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1922 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Alexander Lyle-Samuel"]}, {"page": "Samuel (name)", "response": ["*Alexander Lyle-Samuel (1883\u20131942), English businessman and politician"]}, {"page": "Alexander Lyle (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Alexander Lyle-Samuel (1883\u20131942), British businessman and politician"]}, {"page": "Lyle-Samuel, Alexander", "response": ["#redirectAlexander Lyle-Samuel"]}]}}
