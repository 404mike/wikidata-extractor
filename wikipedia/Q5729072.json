This was apparently to replace Nathaniel Welbeck, the then Ghanaian ambassador (charg\u00e9 d'affaires) to Congo.

General Henry Templer Alexander, the chief of staff of the Ghanaian Army, attributed the affair to the UN officers' inexperience and the UN's insistence on using persuasion with factions in the Congo instead of armed force. Ghanaian President Kwame Nkrumah rejected this explanation and instead said that it was Alexander's \"duty to see that Ghanaian troops were not placed in the kind of impossible position they found themselves in at Port Francqui\"."]}]}}
