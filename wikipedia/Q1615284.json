It was agreed that the colour be blue, and Kelly was given the task of designing a crest to be featured on the necktie. He worked on it for four months until deciding on a reproduction of Everton Lock-Up, which stands in the heart of the Everton district. The Lock-Up has been inextricably linked with the Everton area since its construction in 1787. It was originally used as a bridewell to incarcerate mainly drunks and minor criminals, and it still stands today on Everton Brow. The Lock-Up was accompanied by two laurel wreaths on either side and, according to the College of Arms in London, Kelly chose to include the laurels as they were the sign of winners. The crest was accompanied by the club motto, \"Nil Satis Nisi Optimum\", meaning \"Nothing but the best is good enough\". The ties were first worn by Kelly and the Everton chairman, Mr. E. Green, on the first day of the 1938\u201339 season."]}, {"page": "Tommy Lawton", "response": ["In January 1937, First Division club Everton paid Burnley \u00a36,500 to secure Lawton's services, and also gave his grandfather a job as deputy groundsman at Goodison Park; the fee was a record for a player under 21. The move to Everton made him a teammate of Dixie Dean, his boyhood idol, who he was expected to gradually replace as first choice centre-forward. He later recalled that on his way to Goodison Park on his first day as an Everton player he was told by a tram conductor that \"You're that young Lawton, aren't you? You'll never be as good as Dixie.\" Dean was finally rested on 13 February, which allowed Lawton to make his first team debut against Wolverhampton Wanderers at Molineux; the match ended in a 6\u20132 defeat, though Lawton scored a penalty. He spent the rest of the season at inside-left, with Dean at centre-forward, and ended the 1936\u201337 campaign with four goals in 11 games. He started the 1937\u201338 season in the Reserves, but was installed as first choice centre-forward in September after Dean was dropped for punching club secretary Theo Kelly. On 2 October, Lawton scored the winning penalty in a 2\u20131 victory over Merseyside derby rivals Liverpool at Anfield. He ended the campaign with 28 goals in 39 appearances to become the division's top-scorer."]}, {"page": "Joe Mercer", "response": ["Like many players of his generation, Mercer lost out on seven seasons of football due to the Second World War. He became a sergeant-major and played in 26 wartime internationals, many of them as captain. The Everton manager Theo Kelly accused Mercer of not trying in an international against Scotland, but in reality Mercer had sustained a severe cartilage injury. Even after consulting an orthopaedic specialist, the Everton management refused to believe him and Mercer had to pay for the surgery himself.

He won the league title in 1927\u201328, his first season at Goodison Park. They then won the subsequent Charity Shield in 1928, before finishing a disappointing 18th in 1928\u201329, just three places above the drop. Everton then finished bottom of the division in 1929\u201330, though were just one point behind third-from-bottom (and therefore not relegated) Sheffield United. The \"Toffees\" made an immediate return to the top-flight, marching to the Second Division title in 1930\u201331, seven points ahead of runners-up West Bromwich Albion; they scored 121 goals in their 42 league games. They continued their success into the First Division, winning the title in 1931\u201332 after finishing two points ahead of Arsenal. Their success continued in the Charity Shield in 1932, as they beat Newcastle United 5\u20133 at St James' Park. They dropped to eleventh in 1932\u201333, but lifted the FA Cup in 1933. The final, held in front of 92,950 spectators at Wembley, finished in a 3\u20130 victory over Manchester City, and the Manchester Guardian described Cresswell as giving \"an almost perfect display\". The club's final two seasons under manager-secretary Thomas H. McIntosh ended with a whimper however, with a 14th-place finish in 1933\u201334 and an eighth-place finish in 1934\u201335. Theo Kelly led Everton to a 16th-place finish in 1935\u201336, Cresswell's last as a professional footballer.
