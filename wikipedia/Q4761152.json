Despite defeating Rangers 2\u20131 at Ibrox in his first match, his time at Celtic Park was unsuccessful. Macari made several moves in the transfer market - none of them particularly successful. Gerry Creaney, one of the few consistent goalscorers at Celtic at that time, was played out of position on the right-wing for several weeks before being sold to Portsmouth for \u00a3600,000. Striker Willie Falconer was signed from Sheffield United, right-back Lee Martin and goalkeeper Carl Muggleton came north from England, and in what is considered one of Macari's poorest moves, Andy Payton moved to Barnsley in a part-exchange deal for journeyman striker Wayne Biggins. A miserable 4\u20132 defeat by Rangers in the New Year fixture at Parkhead left Celtic languishing in the league. An early Scottish Cup exit in January 1994 at Motherwell sealed another dismal season for Celtic. Fergus McCann took over as owner of Celtic in March 1994 and duly sacked Macari three months later."]}, {"page": "Brian Horton", "response": ["The club had an excellent youth policy, which saw talent such as Andy Payton and Leigh Jenkinson develop, though Nick Barmby was such a prodigious talent that he was signed to Tottenham Hotspur at the age of 16. Horton also brought in defender Richard Jobson from Watford for \u00a340,000 and Garry Parker from former club Luton for \u00a372,000. He attempted to sign Mark Bright from Leicester City for \u00a345,000, but the chairman could not agree terms with the player. The 1985\u201386 season saw Hull come very close to earning promotion to the First Division, finishing in sixth-place, which was then the third-highest finish in the club's history. At the end of the campaign Horton quit playing to concentrate on full-time management, having been sent off against Crystal Palace in his final appearance. Despite the introduction of the play-off system in 1986\u201387, the \"Tigers\" ended the campaign in 14th-place.", "Horton broke the club's transfer record when he splashed out \u00a31.2 million on Bristol Rovers striker Marcus Stewart, though he also sold top-scorer Andy Booth to Sheffield Wednesday for \u00a32.7 million. Huddersfield finished the 1996\u201397 season just two places and eight points ahead of relegated Grimsby Town. Huddersfield had suffered injuries throughout the spine of the team as midfielder Lee Makel, striker Marcus Stewart and defender Andy Morrison (\u00a3500,000 from Blackpool) missed much of the campaign due to injury, though \u00a3325,000 summer signing Andy Payton proved to be a revelation, hitting 19 goals in all competitions. Horton was sacked in October 1997 following a defeat to Nottingham Forest at the Kirklees Stadium that left Huddersfield bottom of the table."]}, {"page": "Bernie Slaven", "response": ["Todd was sacked in June 1991, and his successor Lennie Lawrence decided to keep Slaven and to play him in a partnership with new signing Paul Wilkinson. However Slaven picked up a calf strain in pre-season and lost his first team place to Stuart Ripley. He regained his first team place early in September after scoring three goals as a substitute against Portsmouth and Oxford United. On 28 September, he scored the opening goal in a 2\u20131 victory over rivals Sunderland. However Lawrence felt that Slaven was too individualistic, and in November he spent \u00a3700,000 on Hull City striker Andy Payton, who he hoped would prove to be an effective striker partner for Paul Wilkinson. Payton scored on his debut against Bristol City on 23 November, but Slaven claimed the other two goals in a 3\u20131 victory, and Payton left the field on a stretcher after picking up an injury. However Slaven injured his knee in January and after undergoing surgery was ruled out of action for five weeks. He scored a hat-trick in a 4\u20130 win over Brighton on 21 March, but fell out with Lawrence and was dropped for the end of season promotion run-in. He returned for the crucial final game of the season against Wolverhampton Wanderers however, and set up a late Jon Gittens equaliser, before a late winner from Wilkinson secured a 2\u20131 victory and the second automatic promotion place for Middlesbrough."]}, {"page": "Alan Lee (footballer)", "response": ["He left Villa in July 1999 when Burnley manager Stan Ternent signed him for a \u00a3200,000 fee. He scored once for Burnley; in a 2\u20131 Football League Trophy defeat at Wigan Athletic. He played 15 league games as the \"Clarets\" won promotion out of the Second Division as runners-up in 1999\u20132000. Though a successful season for the club, Lee never had an extended first team run at Turf Moor, and only had two league starts as Andy Payton and Andy Cooke formed an effective partnership up front."]}, {"page": "History of Celtic F.C. (1887\u20131994)", "response": ["Brady made several more personnel changes to the Celtic side for 1992\u201393, selling defenders Derek Whyte and Chris Morris whilst bringing in forwards Stuart Slater (for a then record fee of \u00a31.5m) and Andy Payton from England, and right-back Rudi Vata, the first Albanian to play in British football.  Celtic's domestic form proved to be no better than the previous season, losing 1\u20130 to Aberdeen in the semi-final of the League Cup, a disappointing 2\u20130 defeat at Falkirk in the Scottish Cup, and a fourth-place finish in the league.  Europe provided a brief respite for Brady, Celtic recovering from a 2\u20130 first leg defeat away at Cologne in the UEFA Cup to win the return match in Glasgow 3\u20130, midfielder John Collins scoring the decisive third goal seven minutes from time. Collins had been signed from Hibernian by Billy McNeill in the summer of 1990, but after a mediocre first season became one of the few players to genuinely flourish during Liam Brady's tenure as manager.", "Lou Macari was appointed the new manager of Celtic on 27 October 1993.

Horton used the \u00a32.7 million that Sheffield Wednesday had used to purchase Andy Booth from Huddersfield, to invest in Morrison as well as Marcus Stewart from Bristol Rovers and Andy Payton from Barnsley. Horton, like Allardyce before him, also made Morrison captain. Morrison scored in his debut for Huddersfield against Charlton (which Huddersfield won 2\u20130). Morrison's Huddersfield teammate Ben Thornley described him as 'the hardest person to have ever played football'. Morrison won the respect of fans 'with his braveheart style warrior performances'. A knee injury restricted Morrison's appearances for Huddersfield in the 1996\u201397 season. He was replaced by Sam Collins in a 1\u20130 defeat to Tranmere Rovers in September 1996 and did not play for Huddersfield again until a 0\u20130 draw with Manchester City in November 1996, in which he was replaced by Kevin Gray just after half time. He did not play again until April 1997 when he replaced David Beresford, at half time, in a 2\u20131 defeat to Charlton Athletic. In the 1997\u201398 season, Morrison played in Huddersfield's 3\u20130 defeat to West Ham United in the League Cup, in which John Hartson scored a hat trick. He also played in Huddersfield's 1\u20130 defeat to Wimbledon, in the FA Cup, in which Neal Ardley scored the only goal. Huddersfield's poor results in the league that season (they went nine games without a win) led to Horton being sacked. Horton was replaced by Peter Jackson, who managed to keep the team up. Morrison played in Huddersfield's first victory that season, a 3\u20131 win against Stoke City (in which Lee Richardson, Stewart and Paul Dalton scored Huddersfield's goals). He also played in Huddersfield's second win of the season, a 1\u20130 victory against Manchester City at Maine Road, in which Rob Edwards scored the winner. In the 1998\u201399 season, Morrison played in Huddersfield's 2\u20131 defeat to Everton, in the League Cup, in which Olivier Dacourt and Marco Materazzi scored Everton's goals and Stewart scored Huddersfield's goal. Morrison fell out with Jackson early that season when the latter decided to make Barry Horne Huddersfield captain, leading to Morrison's departure."]}]}}
