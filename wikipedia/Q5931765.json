McDonald was understudy to Arsenal's regular goalkeeper, England international Jimmy Ashcroft, and played only two league games in what was to be his first spell at Arsenal, his debut coming against Blackburn Rovers on 17 February 1906. At the end of the 1905\u201306 season he moved to Southern League Brighton & Hove Albion and spent two years there.\nIn May 1908 he returned to Woolwich Arsenal after they sold Ashcroft to make ends meet, and MacDonald was an ever-present for the entire 1908\u201309 season, and only missed two games of 1909\u201310. He left Arsenal in July 1910 for Oldham Athletic, spending one season there before moving to Bradford Park Avenue.\nIn December 1912 he returned to Arsenal for a third time, making him, apparently, the only player to have played for the club in three separate spells. As of June 2010, the only other players to have rejoined the club are John Lukic, Jock Rutherford, Martin Keown, Sol Campbell and Jens Lehmann who all rejoined only once. He took over from Sidney Crawford and played 18 of the last 21 league games of the 1912\u201313 season, in which Arsenal were relegated to the Second Division.\nMacDonald left Arsenal for a third and final time in November 1913, having been ousted from the team by Joe Lievesley. He saw out his career with first Fulham and then Bristol Rovers, before World War I intervened and ended competitive league football. He died, aged 36, in 1920.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hugh McDonald", "response": ["Hugh McDonald may refer to:", "* Hugh McDonald (Australian musician) (1954\u20132016), Australian musician", "* Hugh McDonald (politician) (1827\u20131899), member of the 1st Canadian Parliament", "* Hugh McDonald (American musician) (born 1950), American bass player", "* Hugh McDonald (footballer) (1884\u20131920), Scottish football goalkeeper"]}, {"page": "List of Arsenal F.C. records and statistics", "response": ["* Most separate spells with the club: Hugh McDonald, 3 (1905\u201306; 1908\u201310 and 1912\u201313)"]}, {"page": "Beith F.C.", "response": ["The club was initially formed in 1875 and were founder members of the Ayrshire Football Association in 1877, but went into abeyance in 1883 and did not re-emerge fully until 1888.
