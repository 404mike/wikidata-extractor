The barring of most international journalists from Syria by the government made such information particularly valuable. He was \"outed\" by the Syrian intelligence some time in September/October 2011 and fled to Egypt with his wife and daughter where he posts comments to Facebook and Twitter and continues to use the name Alexander Page.\n\nRami Jarrah is Syrian-British and lived most of his early life in London. He first visited Damascus, his parents' hometown, in 2004 where he was detained and placed under a 3-year travel ban by Syrian authorities. Between 2004 and 2007  he was interrogated by numerous intelligence branches regarding his relationship with his parents, both of whom were long-time opposers to the Ba'ath party. He was arrested on 25 March 2011 during the Syrian civil war whilst filming a protest in the Umayyad Mosque, Jarrah was tortured for three days in a Syrian security branch and then released upon signing a document admitting he was a terrorist sent from abroad.\nIn late 2011, Jarrah was arrested in Doha airport and almost sent back to Syria, he admits making it through the ordeal only because fellow Twitter users began a large campaign on the social network.According to NPR, before he became an activist, Jarrah was a \"successful businessman with a comfortable life\" but who quit his job \"rather than join a pro-government rally\".\n\nIn 2012, Jarrah along with Deiaa Dughmoch established The ANA New-Media Association claiming it would become Syria's first independent free media agency. The office was established in Cairo given the dangers of doing so in Syria due to the events of the Syrian civil war and the Ba'ath governments crackdown on independent free media.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Rami", "response": ["*Rami Jarrah, British-Syrian award winning journalist, a.k.a Alexander Page"]}, {"page": "Nouri al-Jarrah", "response": ["Jarrah's son Rami Jarrah became a prominent activist in early 2011 during the Syrian Uprising, he was cited by international media under the name Alexander Page until he was soon compromised in late 2011 by the Syrian intelligence services."]}]}}
