Using the names the Lady of the Rotunda and Isis, she delivered her lectures at the Blackfriars Rotunda in 1832, while it was under the management of her partner, Richard Carlile. Her speeches, together with writings by Carlile, herself and others, appeared in her weekly journal, The Isis.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Charles Bradlaugh", "response": ["Born in Hoxton (an area in the East End of London), Bradlaugh was the son of a solicitor's clerk. He left school at the age of eleven and then worked as an office errand-boy and later as a clerk to a coal merchant. After a brief spell as a Sunday school teacher, he became disturbed by discrepancies between the Thirty-nine Articles of the Anglican Church and the Bible. When he expressed his concerns, the local vicar, John Graham Packer, accused him of atheism and suspended him from teaching.See Bradlaugh-Bonner (1908, p.8); Headlingly (1888, pp. 5\u20136); Tribe (1971, p.18) He was thrown out of the family home and was taken in by Eliza Sharples Carlile, the widow of Richard Carlile, who had been imprisoned for printing Thomas Paine's The Age of Reason. Soon Bradlaugh was introduced to George Holyoake, who organised Bradlaugh's first public lecture as an atheist."]}, {"page": "Richard Carlile", "response": ["Some time after 1829, Carlile met Eliza Sharples and she became his common law wife.

From prison Taylor wrote that \"the spirit of the Rotunda lives\", and \"it opens with new spirit, with new attraction, with all that is lovely and virtuous in woman to grace it.\" From 9 February Eliza Sharples appeared as \"Isis\", the \"Lady of the Rotunda\", giving theatrically presented lectures which energetically decried Christianity, the priesthood, and the political establishment. In the first lecture she said she was \"neither of Taylor nor Carlisle; neither of Owen nor St Simon\", but would \"be the little busy bee extracting honey from all their doctrines\". There were soon claims that her lectures were, at least in part, written by Taylor and Carlisle. Her fiery presentations initially attracted attention, but interest fell away and her lectures finished at the end of April."]}, {"page": "Sharples", "response": ["* Eliza Sharples (1805\u20131852), British writer"]}, {"page": "Rotunda radicals", "response": ["==Zion Ward and Eliza Sharples==", "In a final attempt to revive the Rotunda's fortunes Carlile evicted the NUWC in January 1832 and brought in a new speaker, Eliza Sharples.
