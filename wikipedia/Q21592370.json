It was then announced on 15 May that club captain Magnus Okuonghae would not be offered a new deal to remain with the club when his deal expired. Okuonghae, who had spent six years with the U's, played 215 games for the club, but a ruptured achilles tendon early in the previous campaign brought a premature end to his season. Tony Humes described Okuonghae as \"an excellent servant to the club\". Also leaving the Colchester Community Stadium was Colchester United influential sports scientist Dave Carolan, who headed to Birmingham City to take up a role as the head of sports science for the Championship club.
