March 1995) was an English first-class cricketer who played 11 matches for Worcestershire in the late 1920s. He had the unwanted distinction of never playing in a winning side in his entire first-class career.\nHe made his debut against the New Zealanders in early June 1927, dismissing opener Jack Mills in both innings. In three County Championship games later that season, he took a further four wickets, all in two matches against Somerset, with a career-best return of 2-35 in the first of these. (Worcestershire lost both games by an innings, however.)\nIn 1928 Price played three times, all in the Championship, but could manage only two wickets, although he did make his best score of 33 against Derbyshire in early August. The following year he had another two outings, but again managed only a pair of wickets, his last victim in first-class cricket being Hampshire's Jack Newman, the only man other than Mills he dismissed twice in his career.\nPrice was born in the Shrub Hill region of Worcester; he died aged 86 in the same city.\nHis uncle Ted Arnold also played for Worcestershire and appeared in ten Tests for England, while his brother William played once for Worcestershire in 1923.\nHis granddaughter, Claire Price, is the actress who plays DS Siobhan Clarke in ITV's Rebus.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Claire Price", "response": ["Price was born in Chesterfield, Derbyshire.
