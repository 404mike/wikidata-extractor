The idea was to create a ground for London that could capture the grandeur of Villa Park, home of Birmingham club Aston Villa. The Highbury project was ambitious in its scale and reach, the first stand completed being the West Stand, designed by Claude Waterlow Ferrier and William Binnie in the Art Deco style which opened in 1932. On 5 November the same year the local Tube station was renamed from Gillespie Road to Arsenal. Leitch's main stand was demolished to make way for a new East Stand, matching the West, in 1936. The West Stand cost \u00a345,000 while the East Stand went far over budget and ended up costing \u00a3130,000, mainly thanks to the expense of the facade. The North Bank terrace was given a roof and the southern terrace had a clock fitted to its front, giving it the name the Clock End."]}, {"page": "Claude Ferrier", "response": ["Educated at Marlborough College, Ferrier started his career as an apprentice at the practice of Aston Webb, but left to start his own practice at the age of just 23. Ferrier spent much of his time in Continental Europe, especially in France, which influenced his work; an avowed Francophile, he published an English-French dictionary of technical terms. He later returned to London, and set up a practice based in Westminster with William Binnie, a former Deputy Director of Works at the Imperial War Graves Commission, in 1927."]}, {"page": "Architecture of Malta", "response": ["File:Malta_-_Floriana_-_Vjal_il-Re_Dwardu_VII_-_MCP_car_park+Malta_Memorial+Hotel_Phoenicia_01_ies.jpg|Hotel Phoenicia in Floriana, by William Binnie, 1936-39"]}, {"page": "Binnie", "response": ["*William Binnie (minister) (1823-1886) Scottish Presbyterian minister who wrote on the Psalms", "*William Binnie (architect) (c. 1885/1886 \u2013 ?), Scottish architect", "*William Binnie (engineer) (1867\u20131949), British civil engineer"]}, {"page": "National Temperance Hospital", "response": ["In 1931, Chicago magnate Samuel Insull donated $160,000 to build a new extension, the \"Insull Memorial wing\" which was designed in the Art Deco style by architect William Binnie."]}, {"page": "W.
