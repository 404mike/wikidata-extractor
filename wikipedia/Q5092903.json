The buzz generated around the book culminated in an invite-only event at St. Pancras Station in London on 25 May 2011. Here Deaver made his grand entrance in a Carte Blanche labelled Bentley, accompanied by stunt woman, model and actress Chesca Miles. Royal Marine Commandos abseiled from the roof of the elaborate station to hand Deaver a copy of the novel as he unveiled the book to the world's press."]}]}}
