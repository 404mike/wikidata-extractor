Although he did not become a main part of Swindon's set-up at the time, Storey was sent on loan to numerous clubs such as Portsmouth, Newport County and Inverness Caledonian Thistle. His goal-scoring form in the Scottish Premiership attracted more interest and in May 2016 Storey signed for Aberdeen, before moving to Partick Thistle in August 2017.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Partick Thistle F.C.", "response": ["In the 2017\u201318 Scottish Premiership, Thistle finished in 11th position, narrowly avoiding 12th place with Ross County being automatically relegated. Thistle subsequently went into the Scottish Premiership play-offs against Livingston, who had finished second in the Scottish Championship in their first season of returning to the league. On 17 May 2018, Thistle lost the first leg 2\u20131 away at Almondvale Stadium, with Kris Doolan getting Thistle's goal. Livingston then came to face Thistle at Firhill on 20 May 2018. Livingston won the away leg 0\u20131 after Keaghan Jacobs scored in the 46th minute. Thistle were relegated to the Scottish Championship after a stay in the top flight of five years. Subsequently, speculation surrounded whether or not Archibald would remain as Thistle's manager. On 24 May, Thistle announced on their website Archibald would remain as Partick Thistle's manager going into the Championship next season. As a result of Thistle's poor season, a number of players were not offered a new contract by the club including captain Abdul Osman, Callum Booth, Steven Lawless, Mustapha Dumbuya, Paul McGinn and Ryan Scully. Transfer listed players were Adam Barton, Niall Keown and Miles Storey. Australian midfielder Ryan Edwards triggered a relegation contract clause, allowing him to leave the club immediately. After a poor start to their 2018\u201319 Scottish Championship season, Archibald was sacked as manager on 6 October 2018 following a 2\u20130 loss to Ross County, leaving Thistle 8th in the Championship.", "Thistle's first season in the Scottish Championship after relegation was a difficult one; the club were one of the promotion favourites but after a poor first half of the season they were sitting bottom by December and facing the possibility of back to back relegations. Caldwell performed a large squad overhaul in January including the key signing of Scott McDonald who went on to score 7 goals in 13 games. Caldwell managed to turn the season around with the club finishing in 6th position and avoiding further relegation to League One with a 3\u20130 away win to Queen of the South thus removing the threat of the relegation play-offs. Although safe, Caldwell released striker Kris Doolan who ended his decade-long stay at the club after being informed that his contract would not be renewed. Other players to depart included Miles Storey, Scott McDonald, Niall Keown and Souleymane Coulibaly."]}, {"page": "West Bromwich", "response": ["*Miles Storey \u2013 footballer currently playing for Partick Thistle."]}, {"page": "Inverness Caledonian Thistle F.C.", "response": ["Inverness has been considered as somewhat of a breeding ground for future Aberdeen players, as players such as Adam Rooney, Jonny Hayes, Miles Storey, Graeme Shinnie, Greg Tansey and Ryan Christie have all ended up at Aberdeen after their time in Inverness."]}, {"page": "List of Inverness Caledonian Thistle F.C. seasons", "response": ["|Miles Storey"]}, {"page": "Highland derby", "response": ["| align=\"left\"| Miles Storey || Inverness CT ||3 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || 3"]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Swindon Town F.C. season", "response": ["| Miles Storey"]}, {"page": "Georgios Sarris", "response": ["He made his debut for the club in a 1\u20131 away draw against Rangers.

The Accies board were reportedly unhappy with the Greek defender's conduct immediately after 1-0 loss to Partick Thistle at Firhill.

The match finished 2\u20130 to Spurs, with goals from Steven Caulker and Aaron Lennon condemning Villa to their fourth loss and continued their poor start to the season. After a two-week international break, Villa returned to league action on 20 October against Fulham at Craven Cottage. Villa continued their worst start to a season in 26 years by losing their fifth game, as a late Chris Baird goal gave Fulham a 1\u20130 win. This loss left Villa one place and one point above the relegation zone. On 23 October, promising youngster Daniel Johnson joined League One outfit Yeovil Town on a month's loan. The next match saw Lambert face his old club Norwich City for the first time since leaving them to join Villa in the summer. The match ended 1\u20131 after Christian Benteke gave Villa the lead, but Norwich replied through Michael Turner, ten minutes from time. Joe Bennett was sent off for Villa after receiving two yellow cards, with Villa leading 1\u20130. This result meant that Villa did not win a league match in October and had still won only one so far this season. However, Villa continued to excel in the League Cup as they knocked out Swindon Town, to advance. The match finished 3\u20132 to Villa but it took a 90th-minute winner from Christian Benteke to see Villa book their place in the quarter-finals. Villa had led 2\u20130, after goals from Benteke and Gabriel Agbonlahor, and looked to be easing to a win before Swindon managed to level the score with two quickfire goals from 18-year-old substitute Miles Storey. However, Benteke's late winner sent Villa through and made sure of their only win in October. The draw for the quarter-finals was made the following day, with Villa getting an away tie at Paul Lambert's former club Norwich to be played on 11 December."]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Swindon Town F.C. season", "response": ["| Miles Storey || 1 || 0 || 2 || 0 || 3"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Stevenage F.C. season", "response": ["Stevenage travelled to second placed Notts County to begin October, securing a 2\u20131 victory at Meadow Lane. The hosts missed a penalty at the start of the second-half, with Jeff Hughes' spot-kick hitting the post. They were awarded another penalty twenty minutes later; this time Jamal Campbell-Ryce stepped up and duly converted from twelve yards. Stevenage levelled with just seven minutes remaining, Lucas Akins scoring from the penalty spot after Alan Sheehan handled Marcus Haber's goal-bound effort, with Sheehan receiving a straight red card for the offence. Substitute Robin Shroot scored in injury-time to give Stevenage the win, latching onto Haber's lofted through-pass to finish calmly. Stevenage then secured a 1\u20130 home victory over Scunthorpe United four days later. The only goal of the game came courtesy of Greg Tansey's curling free-kick fifteen minutes from time, enough to earn the hosts their second successive win. The club's unbeaten start to the league season was ended a week later, as they fell to 1\u20130 defeat away to Colchester United. Stevenage had Anthony Grant sent-off early in the second half for two bookable offences, before Colchester's Sanchez Watt scored the deciding goal with a drilled finish two minutes later. Stevenage recovered from their first defeat of the season by inflicting the first home defeat of the season on MK Dons a week later, with a first-half Lucas Akins strike settling the game and ensuring a 1\u20130 away victory. Three days later, on 23 October, Stevenage beat Portsmouth at Broadhall Way, winning 2\u20131. Midfielder Filipe Morais scored his first goal for the club after fifteen minutes, heading in a Lucas Akins cross. The visitors equalised early on in the second-half when Jon Harley found space on the edge of the area and fired in a left-footed shot from 20 yards. Stevenage responded almost instantly when a Morais cross evaded everyone and found its way into the net. Just four days later, Stevenage's unbeaten home record was ended courtesy of a 4\u20130 loss to Swindon Town.
