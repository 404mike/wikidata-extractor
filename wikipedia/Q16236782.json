He started the season in good form, scoring five tries in the first four games, and only missed out on scoring in all four matches because of a controversial tackle by Ospreys flanker George Stowers as he was in the process of grounding the ball. With six more tries to his name by March, Fenby attracted the attention of London Irish, who beat off interest from other clubs to bring him back to the English Premiership on a three-year contract from the 2013\u201314 season. Fenby's tries in 2012\u201313 helped the Scarlets to fourth in the Pro 12 table and a place in the championship play-offs; however, defeat to Ulster in the semi-finals brought the Scarlets' season to an end. His performances also led to speculation that a Wales call-up might have been on the cards for the team's summer tour against Japan, but he was eventually left out in favour of younger alternatives in Dafydd Howells, Liam Williams, Harry Robinson and Tom Prydie."]}, {"page": "2013 June rugby union tests", "response": ["|LW ||11||Dafydd Howells", "*Dan Baker, Dafydd Howells, James King, Rhys Patchell, Emyr Phillips, Andries Pretorius and Owen Williams (all Wales) made their international debuts.", "|WG ||23||Dafydd Howells || || "]}, {"page": "2013 Wales rugby union tour of Japan", "response": ["|LW ||11||Dafydd Howells", "*Dan Baker, Dafydd Howells, James King, Rhys Patchell, Emyr Phillips, Andries Pretorius, Owen Williams (all Wales) and Yusuke Nagae (Japan) made their international debuts.", "|WG ||23||Dafydd Howells || || "]}, {"page": "Judgement Day (rugby union)", "response": ["|LW ||11|| Dafydd Howells || || "]}, {"page": "List of 2018\u201319 Pro14 transfers", "response": ["* Dafydd Howells from  Ospreys", "* Dafydd Howells to  Dragons"]}, {"page": "2018 end-of-year rugby union internationals", "response": ["|RW ||14|| Dafydd Howells"]}, {"page": "List of 2021\u201322 United Rugby Championship transfers", "response": ["* Dafydd Howells to  Ebbw Vale"]}]}}
