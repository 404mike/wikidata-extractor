Additionally, multiple other characters appear throughout the year.", "Su Turtle, portrayed by Sam Battersea, first appeared on 12 April 2018. Su is introduced when the staff members at The Mill are sent to a conflict course, which Su is leading. Su nicknames herself Su without an E, due to the spelling of her name. Due to Zara Carmichael (Elisabeth Dermot Walsh) and Al Haskey (Ian Midlane) not wanting to participate in the activities, Su becomes stressed. On the second day of the course, Su turns up late, and the attendees wonder where she is, and become agitated. Su arrives in an upbeat mood, and sets everyone into pairs and instructs them to fill out a questionnaire about each other, and to make a sculpture out of pipe cleaners. However, every single pair begin arguing. Su takes the attendees to lunch, but gets stressed when they want to drink wine rather than non-alcoholic beverages. She breaks into tears, and Mrs Tembe (Lorna Laidlaw) insists that the staff apologise to Su for their behaviour. Eventually, Su instructs the staff to compliment each other, which brings them together. Over a year later, Su arrives at The Mill as Becky Clarke's (Ali Bastian) replacement as Practice Manager. Zara and Emma Reid (Dido Miles) both become disgruntled with Su, who keeps asking questions and giving them advice. Emma is shocked when Su arrives at her house, as a guest at Emma's home B&B. Su crashes Emma's night in with Zara, and continuously talks about her ex, Dave, who cheated on her. The next day, Su accompanies Emma to an art class, and when Su starts talking about Dave, Emma shouts at her and the pair have an argument in front of the class. Su leaves The Mill when Becky returns from her break. A year later, now calling herself Susan Mallard, she meets Emma a radio show. Emma belittles Su's theories about homeopathy, and the pair argue on air, thinking the show has ended. Realising the producers are pitting them against each other for listeners, they agree to be civil on air. After the show, Su comforts Frank Matthews (Ben Crowe) in the hospital."]}]}}
