In 2006 he struck driver J\u00f6rg Bastuck during the Rally of Catalunya, which shortly after led to Bastuck's demise. After becoming the Fiesta Sporting Trophy International champion in 2007, Clark has been awarded a drive in the World Rally Championship for one event, and secured funding for two more events. His first event was to be in Turkey driving a Ford Focus WRC for the Munchi's Ford team, but after regular Munchi's driver Lu\u00eds P\u00e9rez Companc had to drop out of the Jordan rally, Clark took his place at short notice.  Clark also helps organise his local event, the Speyside Stages organised by 63 car club.Despite competing in four WRC events in 2008, he was unable to secure sponsorship to enable him to continue at that level and he more or less retired from the WRC. He now runs a successful rally car preparation business in Kintore, Aberdeenshire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2006 World Rally Championship", "response": ["|  Barry Clark", "|align=left|  Barry Clark"]}, {"page": "List of World Rally Championship drivers", "response": ["|align=left|  Barry Clark"]}, {"page": "J\u00f6rg Bastuck", "response": ["J\u00f6rg Bastuck (4 September 1969 in Dillingen, Saarland, Germany \u2013 24 March 2006 in Salou, Spain) was a German co-driver in the Junior World Rally Championship.

This was not ideal for rally leader Latvala, who had hoped for warmer conditions overnight for a better chance of holding Loeb at bay. Loeb had been told by Citro\u00ebn boss Olivier Quesnel to push for the victory as a third place for Sordo would be enough to clinch the manufacturers title. After the first loop of Sunday's stages the gap was down to 1.4 seconds and a victory for Loeb was looking inevitable. Loeb was then initially handed a ten-second time penalty for a jump start at SS18  which meant that Latvala took a slender advantage of 2.2 seconds into the last stage. However, Loeb's pace was too strong and a further stage win meant that he won the rally by 12.7 seconds after his earlier time penalty was rescinded. Latvala finished a disappointed second but believed that the battle with Loeb would make him mentally stronger for next season. Sordo followed team instructions to drive carefully and finished third. Petter Solberg maintained his fourth place and the remaining points positions remained the same, except for a late retirement for Henning Solberg which meant that Hirvonen claimed eighth place. Wilson took the position of highest Brit position, ahead of Barry Clark.
