He played only 7 league games for Hartlepool, before leaving, turning up next at South African side Hellenic. In December 1972 he returned to England, signing for West Bromwich Albion, but left without appearing in their league side.\nHe had a spell with Workington before joining Bath City in July 1973. He made nearly 300 appearances for Bath over the next five years.\nIn August 1978, Allen joined AFC Bournemouth, where he was to make 152 league appearances. In 1983, he signed for Bury on non-contract terms, but failed to make the first team, and in December 1983 he joined Peterborough United, playing only once in the Associate Members' Cup at home to Wrexham. Peterborough proved to be an unhappy place for Allen a couple years later when, as a Torquay player, he was attacked on the pitch by Peterborough 'fans'.\nFrom Peterborough, he moved to Sweden, playing for Halmstads BK, before joining Torquay United on a free transfer in March 1984, taking over from John Turner as first choice goalkeeper, making his d\u00e9but in a 2\u20131 defeat away to Hartlepool United on 17 March.\nIn September 1985, he left Plainmoor to join Swindon Town again on a free transfer. He played 40 league games the following season as Swindon won the Fourth Division title, but early the following season he lost his place to Fraser Digby, only playing a further 5 league games, before being transferred back to Torquay in December 1986 as a replacement for John Smeulders.\nBy now his grey hair and moustache made him instantly recognisable and he helped Torquay to remain in league football, playing in the first great escape when Torquay drew 2\u20132 with Crewe Alexandra at Plainmoor thanks to a late equaliser from Paul Dobson and help from the police dog Bryn biting Jim McNichol ensuring that injury time would be required. The following season, he was an ever-present as Cyril Knowles' side made the play-offs, but was released in the summer, joining Bath City in July 1988. He began the season as a regular, but after only nine games, broke his leg while conceding a penalty against Dorchester Town. He regained his fitness, but was released in February 1989.He moved on to recently relegated Newport County, but as Newport folded and failed to complete their Conference season, he returned to Torquay for a third time in April 1989 to cover for the injured Ken Veysey and played at Wembley in the Associate Members' Cup Final as Torquay's only other professional keeper Mark Coombe was cup-tied. He retired from football in June 1989 to work for the Post Office.\nIn May 2001, the Torquay Herald Express reported that Allen was living in Paignton, captaining Chudleigh cricket team and working as an ambulance driver for the South & West Devon Health Authority", "link_mentions": [{"page": "January 12", "response": ["*1948 \u2013 Kenny Allen, English footballer"]}, {"page": "1948", "response": ["** Kenny Allen, English footballer"]}, {"page": "Torquay United F.C.", "response": ["During this time Lew Pope had taken over as chairman from Tony Boyce, and in February 1984 former Chelsea favourite Dave Webb took charge of the club.

Leigh made his professional debut for Bournemouth in 1981 after replacing the injured Kenny Allen in an away game against Peterborough United, a game in which Bournemouth lost 1\u20130. Over the next five seasons, Leigh made 123 appearances in the Football League for Bournemouth. While playing in the FA Cup against defending champions Manchester United in January 1984, Leigh kept a clean sheet in a 2\u20130 victory, and was rewarded with a  lifetime supply of pizzas from a local Italian restaurant. The deal stayed in place for over a year, until Bournemouth's then manager Harry Redknapp bought the restaurant, citing the fact that Leigh was getting, \"a bit fat, a little bit lumpy.\" He also played as Bournemouth won the inaugural Associate Members' Cup by beating Hull City in the final. Towards the end of his Bournemouth career, Leigh spent brief loan spells at Bristol City and Torquay United, making one and four appearances respectively. After Leigh left Bournemouth in 1986, he briefly played non-League football for Bashley, before moving to Malta to play with Hamrun Spartans, where he spent a further six seasons. Leigh was renowned for his powerful long shots, and became \u0126amrun Spartans' penalty taker."]}, {"page": "Ken Allen (footballer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Kenny Allen (footballer)"]}, {"page": "1989 Associate Members' Cup Final", "response": ["| || ||Kenny Allen"]}]}}
