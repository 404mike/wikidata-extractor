Oliver Burkeman of The Guardian writes that her characters are typically \"struggling to maintain a purchase on normality in the face of some secret anguish or creeping awareness of failure\". Suzie Mackenzie, also of The Guardian, has identified a theme of \"characters in a state of alienation\u00a0... women who have forgotten or lost themselves. People whose identity is a question.\" Her performances often include small hints at emotional turmoil, until there comes a point when the character breaks. The journalist Kira Cochrane has identified this as a \"trademark moment\" in many of her best films, while it has led Burkeman to call her the \"queen of the big-screen breakdown\". \"When she does finally crack\", writes journalist Simon Hattenstone, \"it's a sight to behold: nobody sobs from the soul quite like Moore.\" Ben Brantley of The New York Times has praised Moore's ability to subtly reveal the inner-turmoil of her characters, writing that she is \"peerless\" in her \"portraits of troubled womanhood\". When it comes to more authoritative roles, Brantley believes she is \"a bit of a bore\". \"Emotional nakedness is Ms. Moore's specialty\", he says, \"and it's here that you sense the magic she is capable of.\""]}, {"page": "Varsity (Cambridge)", "response": ["The paper has also launched the careers of many news journalists, including in recent times former Observer Political Editor Gaby Hinsliff, Guardian New York correspondent Oliver Burkeman, Guardian music critic Alexis Petridis, author and columnist Iain Hollingshead, Guardian columnist Archie Bland, the Independent's New York business correspondent Stephen Foley, The Sunday Times News Review Editor Martin Hemming, as well as former Independent columnist Johann Hari.
