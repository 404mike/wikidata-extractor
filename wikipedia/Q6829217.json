The division's first General Officer Commanding (GOC) was Major General Vyvyan Evelegh, and the division comprised the 1st Infantry Brigade (Guards) and the 11th and 36th Infantry Brigades, along with supporting units. At its formation, the war establishment (the on-paper strength) of an infantry division was 17,298 men. The divisional insignia, representing a battle axe as used by a crusader, was selected by Evelegh. A variant of the insignia featured the battle axe on a circular background. All versions displayed the blade facing to the left. The insignia gave rise to the formation's nickname: Battleaxe Division. Historian Michael Chappell wrote that the insignia \"was proudly worn on just about all forms of dress\" and to the exclusion of other insignia such as \"regimental titles, [and] arm-of-service strips\"."]}, {"page": "23rd (Northumbrian) Division", "response": ["The 23rd (Northumbrian) Division lacked any official descriptive, being labelled neither a \"Motor\" division like its first-line parent formation, nor an \"Infantry\" division akin to the majority of other British divisions. The shoulder patch is debated in the sources. It has been described as the white rose of Yorkshire but also as a Tudor rose (an amalgamation of the White Rose of York and the Red Rose of Lancaster). Sources differ on whether the background was blue or green. Michael Chappell stated the white rose motif represented the Yorkshire regiments within the division, and that a green background represented the light infantry lineage of these regiments. \"Examples of this sign made up for wear on uniform (with the rose stencilled on a felt patch) are in collections and indicate that the 23rd were probably one of [the few] formations wearing 'illegal' battle insignia in 1940\"."]}, {"page": "List of people from Aldershot", "response": ["* Michael Chappell - military writer and illustrator"]}, {"page": "Malras", "response": ["The British military illustrator and author Michael Chappell lived in the village."]}, {"page": "Australian National Badminton Championships", "response": ["| Wes CaulkettMichael Chappell"]}, {"page": "Chappell, Michael", "response": ["#redirectMichael Chappell"]}]}}
