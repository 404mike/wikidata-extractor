L. Dunlop (born 20 October 1968) is a British thoroughbred racehorse trainer.\nEd Dunlop was born to British champion trainer John Dunlop and his wife. Educated at Eton, he began his career on stud farms in Ireland and Kentucky before completing the National Stud student course in Sydney, Australia. Upon returning to Britain he spent three years as assistant to Nicky Henderson, then joined Alex Scott at his Newmarket Stables. When Scott was murdered in 1994 Dunlop took over and renamed the business Gainsborough Stables. The new stable had its first winner on 19 October 1994 and since then has sent entrants to races as far-flung as Istanbul, Dubai, Milan, Ireland and the United States. In 2003 alone the stable had 50 winners, and such prestigious owners as Edward Stanley, 19th Earl of Derby, have placed horses to train with Dunlop. Notable horses include Ouija Board (won 47%, \u00a32 million).\nDunlop married in 1996 and has three daughters.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Epsom Oaks", "response": ["| Ed Dunlop", "| Ed Dunlop"]}, {"page": "Prince of Wales's Stakes", "response": ["| Ed Dunlop"]}, {"page": "Ascot Gold Cup", "response": ["| Ed Dunlop"]}, {"page": "Sussex Stakes", "response": ["| Ed Dunlop"]}, {"page": "Nassau Stakes", "response": ["| Ed Dunlop", "| Ed Dunlop"]}, {"page": "Haydock Sprint Cup", "response": ["| Ed Dunlop"]}, {"page": "Scottish Derby", "response": ["| Ed Dunlop"]}, {"page": "Lennox Stakes", "response": ["| Ed Dunlop"]}, {"page": "Park Hill Stakes", "response": ["| Ed Dunlop"]}, {"page": "Doncaster Cup", "response": ["| Ed Dunlop"]}, {"page": "Royal Lodge Stakes", "response": ["| Ed Dunlop"]}, {"page": "Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Turf", "response": ["|Ed Dunlop", "|Ed Dunlop"]}, {"page": "Yorkshire Cup (horse race)", "response": ["| Ed Dunlop"]}, {"page": "Ouija Board (horse)", "response": ["Ouija Board (foaled 3 March 2001) is a British Thoroughbred racehorse (named after the ouija board spiritualism device) owned by Edward Stanley, 19th Earl of Derby and trained by Ed Dunlop and Chris Hinson.
