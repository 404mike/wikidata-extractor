He has also consulted for The Dutch National Motor Museum, the Brooklands Museum in England, McLaren International and McLaren Cars Limited.  He was a founding consultant to the SpeedVision TV network in the USA and to the Donington Collection of single-seater racing cars, is Historical Consultant (founding) to Goodwood Motorsport \u2013 creators of the Goodwood Festival of Speed and the Goodwood Revival Meeting, and a member of the Historians Council of the International Motor Racing Research Center at Watkins Glen, NY.\nAt the age of 18 he went straight from grammar school to the staff of Motor Racing magazine based at Brands Hatch. Since then he has written more than 70 motor racing books.\nHe has presented assorted TV programmes covering motor racing and collectors' cars, and since 2004 \u2013 with colleague David Weguelin has produced the Motorfilms Quarterly series of 90-minute archival movie DVDs/video tapes.\nHe has also been, or is currently, a regular contributor to The Daily Telegraph and Motor Sport.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lotus Cars", "response": ["* Doug Nye, The Story of Lotus: 1961\u20131971 Growth of a Legend (Motor Racing Publications, Chiswick, 1972)", "* Doug Nye, Theme Lotus: 1956\u20131986 (Motor Racing Publications, Croydon, 1986)"]}, {"page": "Stirling Moss", "response": ["In 1955 Moss won Italy's thousand-mile Mille Miglia road race, an achievement Doug Nye described as the \"most iconic single day's drive in motor racing history.\" He was paired with motor racing journalist Denis Jenkinson, who prepared pace note for Moss, and the two completed the race in ten hours and seven minutes. Motor Trend headlined it as \"The Most Epic Drive.

In 1964 he bought an elderly Ferrari 125 Formula One car, formerly owned and driven by Peter Whitehead. Despite having had its Ferrari V12 engine replaced by a Chevrolet Corvette V8 by the previous owner in Australia, Wheatcroft enjoyed driving the car at test sessions. The car sparked a buying spree and formed the first of what was to become a major collection of Grand Prix machinery. Over the following years Wheatcroft and his distinctive laugh \u2013 described by historian Doug Nye as \"like a rusty truck failing to start\" \u2013 became a familiar feature at race circuits around the world."]}, {"page": "March 701", "response": ["Using this lightened 701/1 car Amon qualified third for the 1970 Belgian Grand Prix, where Stewart yet again took pole position in Tyrrell's 701/2. Amon's team mate Siffert qualified in tenth position and Peterson, again driving the Antique Automobiles car, went one place better and qualified in ninth. In the race Stewart retired on lap 14 after his engine failed, and Peterson eventually crossed the line eight laps down on the winners and not classified. For the second race in a row Siffert was forced to stop as a consequence of fuel issues, but again he had completed sufficient laps to be a classified finisher, this time in seventh place. Amon, though, spent the majority of the race in second place and chasing hard behind Pedro Rodr\u00edguez's BRM. He was eventually beaten to the victory by the Mexican by only 1.1 seconds. Some controversy surrounded this win, however, and both Amon and Robin Herd have since alleged that Rodr\u00edguez's car was equipped with an illegally large engine for that race. This was later refuted by BRM historian Doug Nye, who could find no evidence either that a switch had been made, nor that at that point BRM had sufficient resources to be able to construct such an engine."]}, {"page": "Owen Maddock", "response": ["Despite their growing popularity, by the time Maddock joined the company in September 1948 they were still not large enough to be able to justify taking on a full-time engineer. In addition to his drafting duties Maddock therefore also filled the roles of fitter, storekeeper and van driver, among many.Nye (2003), p. 32. Gradually the Coopers began to make more use of Maddock's drafting skills, however, realising that having proper technical drawings was preferable to sketching designs to full scale on the walls, where they were frequently painted over! Some smaller parts were fabricated from crude sketches, or frequently simply by eye. During his time with Cooper Maddock became renowned for the detail and artistry of his blueprints, and with a talent for lateral thinking his contribution to the design of Cooper's cars grew rapidly. By the time of Cooper's heyday the design process was essentially a three-way tag match between Maddock, John Cooper and star driver Jack Brabham. Maddock's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and eventual successor, Eddie Stait, later recalled to historian Doug Nye that \"John had a lot of the original ideas and then Owen would add some very original thinking in developing those ideas; they were a team ... and Jack of course contributed a lot.\"Nye (2003), p. 248."]}]}}
