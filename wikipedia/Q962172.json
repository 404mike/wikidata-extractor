He also had notable feuds with Tiger Mask in Japan and Bret Hart in Canada.\nBillington is considered by many, including wrestling legend Bret Hart, to have been one of wrestling's most influential in-ring performers, having increased the level of athleticism involved in the art, bringing together styles from Britain, Mexico, Canada and Japan.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "December 5", "response": ["*  1958   \u2013 Dynamite Kid, English wrestler (d. 2018)", "*2018 \u2013 Dynamite Kid, English wrestler (b. 1958)"]}, {"page": "The A-Team", "response": ["The show featured professional wrestlers such as Hulk Hogan, Professor Toru Tanaka, Ricky \"The Dragon\" Steamboat, The Dynamite Kid, Bobby \"The Brain\" Heenan, Davey Boy Smith (The British Bulldog), Big John Studd and Greg \"The Hammer\" Valentine, in most cases playing themselves.

Hart also had high-impact matches against Tom Billington, who was better known by his in-ring name as the Dynamite Kid. In the midst of wrestling alongside his family, Hart made a point not to ride on the shoulders of his elders. Hart faithfully jobbed as requested of him, taking pride in the believability of his performances. As he said himself, \"No one could take a shit-kicking like Bret Hart\". Although he dreaded partaking in interviews and speaking in front of a crowd, Hart went on to win the promotion's top titles, including two British Commonwealth Mid-Heavyweight Championships, five International Tag Team Championships, and six North American Heavyweight Championships. Hart also wrestled Tiger Mask in New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), a promotion for whom he often wrestled during the early to mid-1980s. He remained one of Stampede's most successful performers until the promotion, along with several wrestlers, was acquired by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in August 1984.", "Hart was asked to start out in the WWF as a singles wrestler with a cowboy gimmick but refused, stating that where he comes from \"if you called yourself a cowboy, you'd better be one.\" He made his televised WWF debut on August 29, 1984, in a tag team match where he teamed with the Dynamite Kid. On September 11, in Poughkeepsie, New York, Hart defeated Aldo Marino in his televised debut singles match, which aired on the September 29 episode of Superstars of Wrestling. In 1985, after acquiring the nickname of \"Hit Man\", he requested to join Jimmy Hart's heel stable, The Hart Foundation, which included brother-in-law Jim Neidhart. Bret began to increasingly team with Neidhart, in order to build the promotion's tag team division. The \"Hart Foundation\" name then became exclusive to Bret, Neidhart and manager Jimmy Hart, due to the similar family names of both team members and their manager.

In addition to appearing on DeNucci's cards, Foley and several other students also took part in some squash matches as jobbers for WWF TV tapings of Prime Time Wrestling and Superstars of Wrestling, where Foley wrestled under the names Jack Foley and Nick Foley. In one of these matches (the first episode of Superstars), Foley and Les Thornton (another jobber) faced the British Bulldogs, during which the Dynamite Kid (who had a long earned reputation as a stiff worker in the ring) clotheslined Foley with such force that he was unable to eat solid food for several weeks.Foley, Have A Nice Day!, pp. 82\u201385 During these squash matches, Foley also faced other top-level talents at the time, such as Hercules Hernandez.

Meltzer describes people like Hulk Hogan and Jesse Ventura as people who were spawned by Harts actions and cites the Dynamite Kid, Junkyard Dog and Billy Robinson as some who would probably not have had the careers they did if not for Hart. He also mentions Chris Benoit and Brian Pillman as individuals who would most certainly never even have become wrestlers were it not for Hart. Meltzer characterized Hart as the biggest territorial star in wrestling history to never win a major championship. Former wrestling promoter and owner of the St. Louis Wrestling Club Larry Matysik described Hart as a Canadian icon."]}, {"page": "WrestleMania", "response": ["| Greg Valentine and Brutus Beefcake (c) vs. The British Bulldogs (Davey Boy Smith and Dynamite Kid) for the WWF Tag Team Championship"]}, {"page": "Chris Benoit", "response": ["During his childhood and early adolescence in Edmonton, Benoit idolized Tom \"Dynamite Kid\" Billington and Bret Hart; at twelve years old, he attended a local wrestling event at which the two performers \"stood out above everyone else\". Benoit trained to become a professional wrestler in the Hart family \"Dungeon\", receiving education from family patriarch Stu Hart.

He eventually declined their offers and chose Miss Elizabeth as his new manager. His gimmick was a crazed, ego-maniacal bully who mistreated Miss Elizabeth and threatened anyone who even looked at her. He made his pay-per-view (PPV) debut at The Wrestling Classic on November 7, 1985, participating in a 16-man tournament. He defeated Ivan Putski, Ricky \"The Dragon\" Steamboat, and the Dynamite Kid before losing by a countout in the finals to Junkyard Dog."]}]}}
