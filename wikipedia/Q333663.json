The Member of Parliament (MP) for Yeovil from 2001 to 2015, in his third parliament he served at the outset as a Cabinet Minister, in 2010, as Chief Secretary to the Treasury and later concurrently as Minister for Schools and for the Cabinet Office \u2013 an office where he worked cross-departmentally on implementing the coalition agreement in policies.\nAfter a career in investment banking, Laws became an economic adviser and later Director of Policy and Research for his party. In 2001, he was elected as MP for Yeovil, succeeding former Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown. In 2004, he co-edited The Orange Book: Reclaiming Liberalism, followed by Britain After Blair in 2006. After the 2010 general election, Laws was a senior party negotiator in the coalition agreement which underpinned the party's parliamentary five-year coalition government with the Conservative Party.\nHe held the office of Chief Secretary to the Treasury for 17 days before resigning owing to the disclosure of his parliamentary expenses claims, described by the Parliamentary Standards and Privileges Committee as \"a series of serious breaches of the rules, over a considerable period of time\", albeit unintended; the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards found \"no evidence that [he] made his claims with the intention of benefiting himself or his partner in conscious breach of the rules.\" His was among the six cabinet resignations during the expenses scandal and he was suspended from Parliament for seven days by vote of the House of Commons.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of political scandals in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* On 29 May 2010 Chief Secretary to the Treasury David Laws resigned from the Cabinet and was referred to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards after The Daily Telegraph newspaper published details of Laws claiming around \u00a340,000 in expenses on a second home owned by a secret partner between 2004 and 2009, whilst House of Commons rules have prevented MPs from claiming second home expenses on properties owned by a partner since 2006.

This production revived at the Gielgud Theatre, in London's West End from 17 September 2010 until 15 January 2011. The principal cast was David Haig as Jim Hacker, Henry Goodman as Sir Humphrey, Jonathan Slinger as Bernard Woolley and Emily Joyce as Claire Sutton, Hacker's special policy advisor. This production, while following the spirit and tone of the original series in many respects, was set contemporaneously at Chequers, the Prime Minister's country residence, with BlackBerrys frequently in evidence,Remarkably, Sir Humphrey was able to show Bernard Woolley how to disable the Prime Minister's BlackBerry. and even included a topical reference to a coalition agreement which Sir Humphrey had drafted (the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats having formed a coalition government in Britain in May 2010).Antony Jay & Jonathan Lynn (2010) Yes, Prime Minister (the play) (Faber & Faber). In reality, during the negotiations that led to the coalition government in 2010, the two parties appear largely to have shunned support available to them from the civil service: see David Laws (2010) 22 Days in May and Rob Wilson (2010) 5 Days To Power, who concluded that, \"probably the influence of the civil service, including the Cabinet Secretary, in pushing the [parties] together to avoid a financial crisis has been overplayed\". The plot was a little more provocative and risqu\u00e9 than most of those seen previously (including a debate about the ethics of procuring a twelve-year-old as a sexual partner for a visiting dignitary,Yes, Prime Minister, act 1, scene 2 (pages 36\u201340) a proposition which it is suggested might be spun in the national interest as a \"euro-job\")Yes, Prime Minister, act 2, scene 1 (page 61). The suggestion of \"euro-job\" was prompted by Hacker's objection to \"Anglo-Kumranistan Liaison Project\" as \"a bit of a mouthful\": ibid. and included some stronger expletives (reflecting perhaps their widely reported use among New Labour's hierarchy between 1997 and 2010).See, for example, Alastair Campbell (2007) The Blair Years; Andrew Rawnsley (2010) The End of the Party; Anthony Seldon  & Guy Lodge (2010) Brown at 10.

At the opening of the edition, presenter David Dimbleby said that the new Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition would not allow a frontbench member of the government to appear on the show unless Campbell was dropped. The BBC refused to do this. The government later accused the BBC of behaving improperly for allowing Campbell to appear as a more in-depth version of his diaries was due to be published the following week, and a Downing Street spokesman told The Guardian, \"Campbell seemed to be on because he's flogging a book next week, so the BBC haven't behaved entirely properly here.\" Campbell said that he had waited until Labour were in opposition before appearing on the show and that the date was a coincidence as it was the only time he was free. He suggested the discord was part of a Conservative anti-BBC agenda. The minister who had been scheduled to appear was the then-Chief Secretary to the Treasury David Laws who Campbell produced a picture of during the programme.
