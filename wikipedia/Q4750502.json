There is a tendency for theatricality and the adoption of personas, alongside intensely poetic lyrics incorporating surreal and metaphorical elements. Wry, intelligent humour is also often prevalent. However the defining characteristic of Chanson, both old and new, is that it focuses on the French language as vehicle and instrument. There is an emphasis on craftsmanship with many of the artists classically trained and/or having studied music academically (cf. Benjamin Biolay studied at the National Conservatoire, Lyon, Emilie Simon studied musicology at the University of Montpellier, and Ana Silvera has performed with the English National Opera and Royal Opera House) giving an intellectual aspect that sets this style of music apart from other genres such as pop, rock and 'anti-folk'."]}, {"page": "Womanizer (song)", "response": ["On January 13, 2009, English singer Ana Silvera covered the song during one of her London concerts."]}, {"page": "Ray Singer (record producer)", "response": ["Ray Singer is a British record producer and owner of Singer Records.
