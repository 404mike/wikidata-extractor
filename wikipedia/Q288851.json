After a period managing his family's estates, he moved permanently to Bath and died after a long public life there. His poem, The New Bath Guide, brought him to fame and began an easy satirical fashion that was influential throughout the second half of the 18th century. Later he wrote An Electoral Ball, another burlesque of Bath society that allowed him to develop and update certain themes in his earlier work. Among his Latin writing were translations and summaries based on both these poems; he was also joint author of one of the earliest Latin translations of Gray's Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard, which went through several editions both in England and abroad.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 3", "response": ["*1805 \u2013 Christopher Anstey, English author and poet (b. 1724)"]}, {"page": "October 31", "response": ["*1724 \u2013 Christopher Anstey, English author and poet (d. 1805)"]}, {"page": "1805", "response": ["* August 3 \u2013 Christopher Anstey, English writer (b. 1724)"]}, {"page": "1724", "response": ["* October 31 \u2013 Christopher Anstey, English writer (d. 1805)"]}, {"page": "1805 in literature", "response": ["*August 3 \u2013 Christopher Anstey, English poet (born 1724)"]}, {"page": "1724 in literature", "response": ["*October 31 \u2013 Christopher Anstey, English writer and poet (died 1805)"]}, {"page": "1766 in literature", "response": ["*Christopher Anstey \u2013 The New Bath Guide"]}, {"page": "Royal Crescent", "response": ["The first resident of Number 1 was Thomas Brock, Town Clerk of Chester, for whom Brock Street was named.

The Octagon fulfilled all of these requirements, and it became quite the most fashionable church in Bath.
