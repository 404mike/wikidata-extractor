It was first broadcast on 4 June 2009. The series was notable for having an \"Open door\" policy on writing, advertising itself as \"the scrapbook sketch show written entirely by the Great British public\" meaning that unsolicited writers without contract to the BBC could send in material. The show was designed to give new writers an opportunity to get material broadcast. It was hoped by the people behind the show that it would be a modern version of Week Ending, an earlier sketch show which also accepted material the same way. Most shows were recorded in front of a live audience at the BBC Radio Theatre in Broadcasting House."]}, {"page": "List of Would I Lie to You? episodes", "response": ["|Jo Brand and Kiri Pritchard-McLean"]}, {"page": "Llanbedrgoch", "response": ["Kiri Pritchard-McLean"]}, {"page": "Richard Herring's interview podcasts", "response": ["| Kiri Pritchard-McLean \u2013 Remote record"]}, {"page": "Frankie Boyle's New World Order", "response": ["| Lucy Prebble, Kiri Pritchard-McLean and Jason Williamson", "| rowspan=\"2\" | Kiri Pritchard-McLean, Jen Brister and George Monbiot", "| rowspan=\"2\" | Kiri Pritchard-McLean, Grace Blakeley and Eshaan Akbar", "| Kiri Pritchard-McLean and Jamali Maddix", "| rowspan=\"2\" | Sara Pascoe, Miles Jupp and Kiri Pritchard-McLean", "| rowspan=\"2\" | Miles Jupp, Kiri Pritchard-McLean and Jamali Maddix", "| rowspan=\"2\" | Sara Pascoe, Kiri Pritchard-McLean and Sophie Duker", "| Miles Jupp, Sophie Duker & Kiri Pritchard-McLean https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/frankie_boyle_new_world_order/episodes/2020/1/", "| rowspan=\"2\" | Miles Jupp, Sophie Duker and Kiri Pritchard-McLean", "| Miles Jupp, Desiree Burch and Kiri Pritchard-McLean", "| rowspan=\"2\" | Miles Jupp, Kiri Pritchard-McLean and Jamali Maddix", "| rowspan=\"2\" | Miles Jupp, Sophie Duker and Kiri Pritchard-McLean", "* Kiri Pritchard-McLean"]}, {"page": "Richard Osman's House of Games", "response": ["*Week 20 (8\u201312 March 2021): Glenn Moore, Mina Anwar, Kiri Pritchard-McLean and Shaun Williamson"]}, {"page": "The Russell Howard Hour", "response": ["| 1 || 21 September 2017 || 0.69 || 0.83 || rowspan=\"2\"| 2 || 8 || Diane Abbott || Kiri Pritchard-McLean"]}, {"page": "Roast Battle", "response": ["|Kiri Pritchard-McLean vs Brennan Reece"]}, {"page": "NextUp Comedy", "response": ["* Kiri Pritchard-McLean"]}, {"page": "Kiri Pritchard Mclean", "response": ["#REDIRECT Kiri Pritchard-McLean"]}, {"page": "Rachel Fairburn", "response": ["Rachel Fairburn is an English comedian.
