The match was contested by select teams of amateur and professional players. It was played on 6 October 1913 at The Den, London, and ended as a 7\u20132 win for the Professionals. England internationals Harry Hampton scored four goals, George Holley two and Harold Fleming one for the Professionals; George Barlow and Herbert Farnfield scored for the Amateurs. The proceeds were donated to the Senghenydd Colliery Disaster Fund.", "Hampton completed his hat-trick after five minutes of the second half, but then the Amateurs took control. Sam Hardy kept out shots from Dick Healey, Ivan Sharpe and Herbert Farnfield before being beaten twice in five minutes. After a \"great shot\" from Preston North End winger George Barlow, the Amateurs' second was touched in by Farnfield after a move involving four players brought the ball all the way down the field. It was, according to the pseudonymous 'Reflector', writing in the Mirror, \"easily the best of the match.\" Confusion between goalkeeper Ronald Brebner and full-back Thomas Burn presented Hampton with his fourth, and Holley completed the scoring late on.", "|Forward|| George Barlow||Preston North End"]}, {"page": "George Barlow (1900s footballer)", "response": ["#REDIRECTGeorge Barlow (footballer, born 1885)"]}]}}
