His sound recordings were acquired by the BBC and established the BBC's library of natural history sound. He never lost his strong German accent. His work was parodied by Peter Sellers. Koch retired in 1951, but continued to make expeditions to record wildlife sounds, visiting Iceland when he was seventy-one. He was the subject of a 2009 BBC Radio 4 documentary presented by Sean Street, \"Ludwig Koch and the Music of Nature\". His recordings and manuscript papers are preserved in the British Library Sound Archive."]}, {"page": "A. G.
