Ayler continued to experiment with vocals for the rest of his career (see, for example, the wordless vocalising near the end of \"Love Cry\" from the album of the same name); however, his singing on later albums such as New Grass and Music Is the Healing Force of the Universe has been the subject of some derision. Val Wilmer referred to his singing as \"tortuous,\" and critics have stated that \"his words and vocal delivery are truly frightening\", describing him as having \"a bellowing, untrained voice that was wavering at its most controlled,\" and delivering lyrics in \"a manic wail.\"", "Ayler developed a close friendship with John Coltrane, and the two influenced each other's playing. Coltrane said that Ayler \"filled an area that it seems I hadn't got to. I think what he's doing, it seems to be moving music into even higher frequencies.\" Ayler stated: \"when he [Coltrane] started playing, I had to listen just to his tone... To listen to him play was just like he was talking to me, saying, 'Brother, get yourself together spiritually. Just one sound - that's how profound this man was...\" According to Val Wilmer, \"the relationship between the two men was a very special one. They talked to each other constantly by telephone and by telegram and Coltrane was heavily influenced by the younger man.\" Coltrane first heard Ayler in 1962, after which he told Ayler that \"he had heard himself playing like that in a dream once.\" In February of the following year, Ayler sat in with Coltrane's group for the first time during a gig at the Jazz Temple in Cleveland, Ohio. Beginning that year, \"Coltrane and Ayler, when both in New York, were often in the same room. Various recollections have placed Coltrane watching Ayler and Cecil Taylor at the Take 3 Coffeehouse in the West Village in the fall of 1963; watching Ayler and Eric Dolphy together at the Half Note sometime that year; inviting Ayler onstage at the Half Note in March 1964; hearing Ayler\u2019s group with Rashied Ali at a little performance space at 27 Cooper Square in early 1965.\" Following the recording of Ascension in June 1965 (after Ayler had sent him copies of his albums Ghosts and Spiritual Unity), Coltrane \"called Ayler and told him, 'I recorded an album and found that I was playing just like you.' Albert's reply: 'No man, don't you see, you were playing like yourself.

Through Bradley, Johnson was recorded in 1934 for the film Oh, Daddy!, released in 1935, and in December 1934 he travelled to Trinidad. He toured the Caribbean, dancing on stage, before moving on to the US, where he visited Harlem, New York. He spent his time in the US honing his tap dancing skills, and studying the styles of the local African American dancers. According to Val Wilmer, the writer on jazz, it was here that he \"learnt to wind his hips in the suggestive manner that his nickname implied\". According to Andrew Simons, the Head of Music at the British Library, it is likely that Johnson also saw the act of Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson, who performed a \"stair dance\" that was well-known on the New York vaudeville stage. Johnson met Fletcher Henderson, who encouraged him in a future band-leading career and allowed him to conduct his orchestra. While in the US he also featured in two short films.

At that time I was musically out of this world. I knew I had to play this music for the people.\"", "Val Wilmer wrote that Spiritual Unity \"revolutionised the direction for anyone playing those three instruments. The music was shockingly different - Ayler disquietingly harsh and brutal but at the same time deeply tinged with pathos, Peacock listening as he played monumental bass figures, Murray behaving, as LeRoi Jones once put it, as though 'he might just want to disappear' - but its conclusions seemed so simple when you listened to it. Ayler, Murray and Peacock had created the perfect group music.\" According to John Corbett, Spiritual Unity represents \"one of the most radical moments\" in an \"alternative way of thinking\" where instrumentalists ask: \"What is my supposed role, and what if I don't want to live by it?\" He wrote: \"The saxophone and bass and drums are doing something quite different from what they normally do\u2014the bassist... is melodic, skittish, and virtuosic; the drummer... gathers pools and eddies of sound, mounting and dissipating volume, his cymbals awash in nervous energy; the saxophonist... only plays a smidge of melodic material, concentrating on ecstatic shouts and cries, swooping across the others in big slurs  and swipes, lightning flashing across a turbulent sea.
