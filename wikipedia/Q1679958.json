From his upbringing amidst the Anglo-Catholic Oxford Movement, Froude intended to become a clergyman, but doubts about the doctrines of the Anglican church, published in his scandalous 1849 novel The Nemesis of Faith, drove him to abandon his religious career.  Froude turned to writing history, becoming one of the best known historians of his time for his History of England from the Fall of Wolsey to the Defeat of the Spanish Armada.  Inspired by Thomas Carlyle, Froude's historical writings were often fiercely polemical, earning him a number of outspoken opponents. Froude continued to be controversial up until his death for his  Life of Carlyle, which he published along with personal writings of Thomas and Jane Welsh Carlyle. These publications illuminated Carlyle's often selfish personality, and led to persistent gossip and discussion of the couple's marital problems.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 23", "response": ["*1818 \u2013 James Anthony Froude, English historian, novelist, biographer and editor (d. 1894)"]}, {"page": "Great Famine (Ireland)", "response": ["Some also pointed to the structure of the British Empire as a contributing factor.

In the early Middle Ages, the views of Geoffrey of Monmouth produced a personally inspired (and largely fictitious) history that was not challenged for some 500 years. In the Reformation, Christians looking to establish an independent English church reinterpreted Anglo-Saxon Christianity. In the 19th century, the term Anglo-Saxon was broadly used in philology, and is sometimes so used at present, though the term 'Old English' is more commonly used. During the Victorian era, writers such as Robert Knox, James Anthony Froude, Charles Kingsley and Edward A. Freeman used the term Anglo-Saxon to justify colonialistic imperialism, claiming that Anglo-Saxon heritage was superior to those held by colonised peoples, which justified efforts to \"civilise\" them.Rule of Darkness: British Literature and Imperialism, 1830\u20131914 by Patrick Brantlinger.

The movement gained influential support, but it was also attacked by some bishops of the Church and by the latitudinarians within the University of Oxford, who believed in conforming to official Church of England practices but who felt that matters of doctrine, liturgical practice, and ecclesiastical organization were of relatively little importance. Within the Oxford movement, there gradually arose a much smaller group which tended towards submission to the supremacy of the Roman Catholic Church. In 1845, the university censured a tract entitled Ideal of a Christian Church and its author, the pro-Roman Catholic theologian W. G. Ward, on which basis was imputed the moniker \"Ideal Ward\". The year 1850 saw the victory of the Evangelical cleric George Cornelius Gorham in a celebrated legal action against church authorities. Consequently, some Anglicans of Anglo-Catholic churchmanship were received into the Roman Catholic Church, while others, such as Mark Pattison, embraced Latitudinarian Anglicanism, and yet others, such as James Anthony Froude, became sceptics. The majority of adherents of the movement, however, remained in the Church of England and, despite hostility in the press and in government, the movement spread. Its liturgical practices were influential, as were its social achievements (including its slum settlements) and its revival of male and female monasticism within Anglicanism."]}, {"page": "Rationalism", "response": ["* James Anthony Froude: \"We may deny his conclusions; we may consider his system of thought preposterous and even pernicious, but we cannot refuse him the respect which is the right of all sincere and honourable men.

Ruskin further explored political themes in Time and Tide (1867), his letters to Thomas Dixon, a cork-cutter in Sunderland, Tyne and Wear who had a well-established interest in literary and artistic matters. In these letters, Ruskin promoted honesty in work and exchange, just relations in employment and the need for co-operation."]}, {"page": "John Henry Newman", "response": ["In 1862 Newman began to prepare autobiographical and other memoranda to vindicate his career. The occasion came when, in January 1864, Charles Kingsley, reviewing James Anthony Froude's History of England in Macmillan's Magazine, incidentally asserted that \"Father Newman informs us that truth for its own sake need not be, and on the whole ought not to be, a virtue of the Roman clergy.\" Edward Lowth Badeley, who had been a close legal adviser to Newman since the Achilli trial, encouraged him to make a robust rebuttal.Courtney (2004) After some preliminary sparring between the two, in which Kingsley refused to admit any fault, Newman published a pamphlet, Mr Kingsley and Dr Newman: a Correspondence on the Question whether Dr Newman teaches that Truth is no Virtue, (published in 1864 and not reprinted until 1913). The pamphlet has been described as \"unsurpassed in the English language for the vigour of its satire\". However, the anger displayed was later, in a letter to Sir William Cope, admitted to have been largely feigned. After the debate went public, Kingsley attempted to defend his assertion in a lengthy pamphlet entitled What then does Dr Newman mean?, described by a historian as \"one of the most momentous rhetorical and polemical failures of the Victorian age\".Frank M.

Compared with Newman, Froude wrote, Keble, Pusey, and the other Tractarians \"were all but as ciphers, and he the indicating number\". Newman's face was \"remarkably like that of Julius Caesar. ...I have often thought of the resemblance, and believed that it extended to the temperament. In both there was an original force of character which refused to be moulded by circumstances, which was to make its own way, and become a power in the world; a clearness of intellectual perception, a disdain for conventionalities, a temper imperious and wilful, but along with it a most attaching gentleness, sweetness, singleness of heart and purpose. Both were formed by nature to command others, both had the faculty of attracting to themselves the passionate devotion of their friends and followers. ...For hundreds of young men Credo in Newmannum was the veritable symbol of faith.\"Quoted in Wilfred Ward, The Genius of Cardinal Newman: Lecture 1"]}, {"page": "List of historians", "response": ["*James Anthony Froude (1818\u20131894), Tudor England"]}, {"page": "Oriel College, Oxford", "response": ["Behind the high table is a portrait of Edward II; underneath is a longsword brought to the college in 1902 after being preserved for many years on one of the college's estates at Swainswick, near Bath.

Carlyle's biographer James Anthony Froude published (posthumously) his opinion that the marriage remained unconsummated due to impotence. On pages 21\u201324, Froude insinuates that Carlyle was impotent (p. 21): \"She [Mrs. Carlyle] had longed for children, and children were denied to her. This had been at the bottom of all the quarrels and all the unhappiness\"; (p. 22): \"Intellectual and spiritual affection being all which he had to give [his wife]\"; (p. 23): \"Carlyle did not know when he married what his constitution was.

Harris's information is doubted by several scholars, the editor John Gallagher noted in a footnote.", "Carlyle would have preferred that no biography of him was written, but when he heard that his wishes would not be respected and several people were waiting for him to die before they published, he relented and supplied his friend James Anthony Froude with many of his and his wife's papers. Carlyle's essay about his wife was included in Reminiscences, published shortly after his death by Froude, who also published the Letters and Memorials of Jane Welsh Carlyle annotated by Carlyle himself.

However, the biography in question was consistent with Carlyle's own conviction that the flaws of heroes should be openly discussed, without diminishing their achievements.

Froude's defence of his decision, My Relations With Carlyle, was published posthumously in 1903, including a reprint of Carlyle's 1873 will, in which Carlyle equivocated: \"Express biography of me I had really rather that there should be none.\" Nevertheless, Carlyle in the will simultaneously and completely deferred to Froude's judgment on the matter, whose \"decision is to be taken as mine.\"\"Will and Codicil of Thomas Carlyle, Esq.\", in My Relations with Carlyle, New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, p. 73."]}, {"page": "John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland", "response": ["A black legend about the Duke of Northumberland was already in the making when he was still in power, the more after his fall.Ives 2009 p. 109; Loades 2008 From the last days of Henry VIII he was to have planned, years in advance, the destruction of both King Edward's Seymour uncles\u2014Lord Thomas and the Protector\u2014as well as Edward himself.Ives 2009 pp. 107\u2013109 He also served as an indispensable scapegoat: It was the most practical thing for Queen Mary to believe that Dudley had been acting all alone and it was in nobody's interest to doubt it.Loades 1996 p. 267; Ives 2009 p. 3 Further questions were unwelcome, as Charles V's ambassadors found out: \"it was thought best not to inquire too closely into what had happened, so as to make no discoveries that might prejudice those [who tried the duke]\".Ives 2009 p. 154 (square brackets by Ives) By renouncing the Protestantism he had so conspicuously stood for, Northumberland lost every respect and became ineligible for rehabilitation in a world dominated by thinking along sectarian lines.Loades 1996 pp. vii\u2013viii; Jordan and Gleason 1975 pp. 54\u201355 Protestant writers like John Foxe and John Ponet concentrated on the pious King Edward's achievements and reinvented Somerset as the \"good Duke\"\u2014it followed that there had also to be a \"wicked Duke\".MacCulloch 2001 p. 42; Loades 1996 p. 192; Loades 2008 This interpretation was enhanced by the High and Late Victorian historians, James Anthony Froude and A.
