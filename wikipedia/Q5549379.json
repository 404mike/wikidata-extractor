He is particularly known for his work on the Guatemalan author Miguel \u00c1ngel Asturias and Colombian author Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, both Nobel Prize for Literature winners.\nHis 2008 book, Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez. A Life, was the first full biography of Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez to be published in English.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mario Vargas Llosa", "response": ["In 1965, Vargas Llosa published his second novel, The Green House (La casa verde), about a brothel called \"The Green House\" and how its quasi-mythical presence affects the lives of the characters. The main plot follows Bonifacia, a girl who is about to receive the vows of the church, and her transformation into la Selvatica, the best-known prostitute of \"The Green House\". The novel was immediately acclaimed, confirming Vargas Llosa as an important voice of Latin American narrative. The Green House won the first edition of the R\u00f3mulo Gallegos International Novel Prize in 1967, contending with works by veteran Uruguayan writer Juan Carlos Onetti and by Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez.. See also  This novel alone accumulated enough awards to place the author among the leading figures of the Latin American Boom. Some critics still consider The Green House to be Vargas Llosa's finest and most important achievement. Indeed, Latin American literary critic Gerald Martin suggests that The Green House is \"one of the greatest novels to have emerged from Latin America\".", "Mario Vargas Llosa is considered a major Latin American writer, alongside other authors such as Octavio Paz, Julio Cort\u00e1zar, Jorge Luis Borges, Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez and Carlos Fuentes. In his book The New Novel in Latin America (La Nueva Novela), Fuentes offers an in-depth literary criticism of the positive influence Vargas Llosa's work has had on Latin American literature. Indeed, for the literary critic Gerald Martin, writing in 1987, Vargas Llosa was \"perhaps the most successful\u00a0... certainly the most controversial Latin American novelist of the past twenty-five years\"."]}, {"page": "Latin American Boom", "response": ["The Latin American Boom () was a literary movement of the 1960s and 1970s when the work of a group of relatively young Latin American novelists became widely circulated in Europe and throughout the world. The Boom is most closely associated with Julio Cort\u00e1zar of Argentina, Carlos Fuentes of Mexico, Mario Vargas Llosa of Peru, and Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez of Colombia. Influenced by European and North American Modernism, but also by the Latin American Vanguardia movement, these writers challenged the established conventions of Latin American literature. Their work is experimental and, owing to the political climate of the Latin America of the 1960s, also very political. \"It is no exaggeration\", critic Gerald Martin writes, \"to state that if the Southern continent was known for two things above all others in the 1960s, these were, first and foremost, the Cuban Revolution (although Cuba is not in South America) and its impact both on Latin America and the Third World generally, and secondly, the Boom in Latin American fiction, whose rise and fall coincided with the rise and fall of liberal perceptions of Cuba between 1959 and 1971.\""]}, {"page": "Dictator novel", "response": ["Literary critic Roberto Gonz\u00e1lez Echevarr\u00eda argues that the dictator novel is \"the most clearly indigenous thematic tradition in Latin American literature\", and traces the development of this theme from \"as far back as Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo's and Francisco L\u00f3pez de G\u00f3mara's accounts of Cort\u00e9s's conquest of Mexico.\" The nineteenth century saw significant literary reflections on political power, though on the whole the dictator novel is associated with the Latin American Boom, a literary movement of the 1960s and 1970s. For critic Gerald Martin, the dictator novel marks the end of the Boom and even (as he says of Roa Bastos's I, the Supreme) \"the end of an entire era in Latin American history, the era which had stretched from Sarmiento's Facundo in 1845.\" In the 1970s, many dictator novels focused on the figure \"of the aging dictator, prey to the boredom of a limitless power he is on the verge of losing.\"", "Miguel \u00c1ngel Asturias's El Se\u00f1or Presidente (written in 1933, but not published until 1946) is, in the opinion of critic Gerald Martin, \"the first real dictator novel\". Other literary treatments of the dictator figure followed, such as Jorge Zalamea's El Gran Burund\u00fan Burund\u00e1 ha muerto, but the genre did not gain impetus until it was reinvented in the political climate of the cold war, through the Latin American Boom.", "*Augusto Roa Bastos' I, the Supreme (Yo, el Supremo, 1974) is a fictionalized account of the nineteenth-century Paraguayan dictator Jos\u00e9 Gaspar Rodr\u00edguez de Francia. However, it's also a historical account, making use of real documents and accounts of people who knew Francia. Roa's portrayal of a despot in Latin American fiction is distinguished \"not only by the quantity of detail lavished on him, but by his remarkable capacity to seem at one moment a person, at another an embodiment of contradictory elements not usually associated with a single person, let alone a powerful tyrant\". Its title was derived from the fact that Francia referred to himself as \"El Supremo\" or \"the Supreme\". Making use of non-traditional writing techniques, the novel is composed of separate discourses with their own distinctive styles, and the demarcation between them is often blurred. Gerald Martin claims that Roa Bastos's novel \"was more immediately and unanimously acclaimed than any novel since One Hundred Years of Solitude, and critics seemed to suspect that its strictly historical importance might be even greater than that of Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's fabulously successful creation.\""]}, {"page": "El Se\u00f1or Presidente", "response": ["Asturias first wrote  in response to the dictatorial rule of Manuel Estrada Cabrera. Because Asturias spent a decade writing the novel, the delay in its publication, and the fact that it never names its eponymous President, many scholars have noted that it could equally be taken to apply to the subsequent regime of Jorge Ubico. Moreover, since the novel's publication, it has been used to critique dictatorial rule throughout Latin America. In its examination of the nature of dictatorial power in general, it helped initiate the new genre of the dictator novel.

These errors were only rectified in the third edition, published in Argentina in 1952, which also included numerous substantial changes introduced by Asturias himself.

Asturias' writing style in Leyendas de Guatemala has been described by some as \"historia-sue\u00f1o-poemas\" (history-dream-poem). In each legend, Asturias draws the reader in with a fury of beauty and mystery without being able to comprehend the sense of space and time.Castelpoggi, p. 27 Leyendas de Guatemala brought Asturias critical praise in France as well as in Guatemala.
