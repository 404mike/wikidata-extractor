Baxter states that Kubrick explores the \"furtive and violent side alleys of the sexual experience: voyeurism, domination, bondage and rape\" in his films. He further points out that films like A Clockwork Orange are \"powerfully homoerotic\", from Alex walking about his parents' flat in his Y-fronts, one eye being \"made up with doll-like false eyelashes\", to his innocent acceptance of the sexual advances of his post-corrective adviser Deltroid (Aubrey Morris). British critic Adrian Turner notes that Kubrick's films appear to be \"preoccupied with questions of universal and inherited evil\", and Malcolm McDowell referred to his humor as \"black as coal\", questioning his outlook on humanity. A few of his pictures were obvious satires and black comedies, such as Lolita and Dr. Strangelove; many of his other films also contained less visible elements of satire or irony. His films are unpredictable, examining \"the duality and contradictions that exist in all of us\". Ciment notes how Kubrick often tried to confound audience expectations by establishing radically different moods from one film to the next, remarking that he was almost \"obsessed with contradicting himself, with making each work a critique of the previous one\"."]}, {"page": "The Prisoner", "response": ["* Aubrey Morris"]}, {"page": "The Wicker Man", "response": ["* Aubrey Morris as Old Gardener/Gravedigger"]}, {"page": "1996 in film", "response": ["| Tales from the Crypt presents Bordello of Blood || Universal Pictures || Gilbert Adler (director/screenplay); A.L.
