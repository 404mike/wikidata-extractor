They both later teamed up with Pete Waterman, and they went from small independent labels to the major RCA, producing a myriad of hits. According to Waterman, Aitken was a noted perfectionist, particularly when it came to his guitar solos.After the partnership split up in 1991, Aitken went into a period of retirement, raising his daughters Isabelle and Romy, and pursuing hobbies such as auto racing. He later returned to the music industry in 1994 -- partnering with Mike Stock once again and having success with acts such as Nicki French, Scooch, and Robson & Jerome -- before seemingly retiring again in 2002.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 25", "response": ["*1956 \u2013 Matt Aitken, English songwriter and record producer"]}, {"page": "Bananarama", "response": ["1986 saw the release of their third Jolley/Swain album, True Confessions.

The dance-oriented beats on the song typified the SAW approach to pop production. Bananarama had tracked the producers down after hearing \"You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)\" by Dead or Alive.

In 1982 Stock moved to Abbey Wood, South London where, along with Matt Aitken he acquired a recording desk and tape machine and formed his first record label. During the break of one of Mirage's sets on New Year's Eve 1983, Stock informed the band he would be leaving and was going into the studio to pursue his career as a songwriter and producer.

During 1989 Stock wrote and produced over seven albums' worth of material for artists such as Kylie Minogue, Jason Donovan, Bananarama, Donna Summer, Cliff Richard and Paul McCartney. The team supplied Donna Summer with her most successful hit single since the 1970s with \"This Time I Know It's for Real\" and Cliff Richard's No. 3 \"I Just Don't Have the Heart\". SAW also gave 18-year-old singer Sonia a debut No. 1 with \"You'll Never Stop Me Loving You\".

It wasn't a chart hit, but it was a club hit and was championed by Radio 1's John Peel. Their initial style was in creating hi-NRG dance music with \"You Think You're a Man\" by Divine (UK No. 16 in July 1984) and \"Whatever I Do\" by Hazell Dean (UK No. 4 in July 1984).

In mid-1991, Matt Aitken left the team due to stress, and Stock and Waterman carried on. With their sound no longer in vogue, they still had notable hits with Jason Donovan (who left them in 1991) and Kylie Minogue (who left them in 1992). 1993 saw a slight resurgence with two top 10 hits from Sybil, and top 40 hits from Bananarama, Bill Tarmey and the WWF Superstars.
