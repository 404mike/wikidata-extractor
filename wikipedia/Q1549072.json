The Essential Rothbard. Mises Institute. pp. 12\u201313. In 1965, Rothbard wrote that \"Lysander Spooner and Benjamin R.

Journal of Libertarian Studies. 20 (1): 5\u201315. However, Rothbard thought that they had a faulty understanding of economics as the 19th-century individualist anarchists had a labor theory of value as influenced by the classical economists and was a student of Austrian School economics which does not agree with the labor theory of value. Rothbard sought to meld 19th-century American individualist anarchists' advocacy of economic individualism and free markets with the principles of Austrian School economics, arguing that \"[t]here is, in the body of thought known as 'Austrian economics', a scientific explanation of the workings of the free market (and of the consequences of government intervention in that market) which individualist anarchists could easily incorporate into their political and social Weltanschauung\".Rothbard, Murray (2000) [1965]. \"The Spooner-Tucker Doctrine: An Economist's View\". Journal of Libertarian Studies. 20 (1): 7. Rothbard held that the economic consequences of the political system they advocate would not result in an economy with people being paid in proportion to labor amounts, nor would profit and interest disappear as they expected. Tucker thought that unregulated banking and money issuance would cause increases in the money supply so that interest rates would drop to zero or near to it.

Proudhon opposed government privilege that protects capitalist, banking and land interests, and the accumulation or acquisition of property (and any form of coercion that led to it) which he believed hampers competition and keeps wealth in the hands of the few. Proudhon favoured a right of individuals to retain the product of their labor as their own property, but believed that any property beyond that which an individual produced and could possess was illegitimate. Thus, he saw private property as both essential to liberty and a road to tyranny, the former when it resulted from labor and was required for labor and the latter when it resulted in exploitation (profit, interest, rent, tax). He generally called the former \"possession\" and the latter \"property.\" For large-scale industry, he supported workers associations to replace wage labour and opposed the ownership of land."]}, {"page": "Issues in anarchism", "response": ["* Offer, John (2000).

Carrier, Berg/Oxford, 1997, p. 107 and p. 104) Many defined themselves as socialists. These early individualist anarchists defined capitalism in various ways, but it was often discussed in terms of usury: \"There are three forms of usury, interest on money, rent on land and houses, and profit in exchange. Whoever is in receipt of any of these is a usurer\".James J. Martin. Men against the State. p. 208. Excluding these, they tended to support free trade, free competition and varying levels of private property such as mutualism based on occupation and use property norms.Non-capitalist market anarchists support private possession along Warren's, Proudhon's, or similar lines. In contrast, anarcho-capitalists support private property along Lockean or similar lines. It is this distinction which has led to the rift between anarchism and anarcho-capitalism. Historically, anarchists considered themselves socialists and opposed to capitalism, therefore anarcho-capitalism is considered by many anarchists today as not being a form of anarchism.As Peter Marshall notes in his history of anarchism, \"few anarchists would accept the 'anarcho-capitalists' into the anarchist camp since they do not share a concern for economic equality and social justice.\" Demanding the Impossible, p. 565.", "Anarchist organisations such as the Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo (Spain) and the Anarchist Federation (Britain and Ireland) generally take an explicitly anti-capitalist stance.
