His initial career was in the theatre, where he was an assistant director at the Royal Court Theatre in the mid-1980s. In 1985 he moved into television, joining the staff of the BBC as a production trainee, before eventually becoming a producer in the drama department.\nHe produced a variety of series and one-offs for the Corporation during the 1990s, of which the best known are 1996's Our Friends in the North (winner of the 1997 Best Drama Serial accolades from both the British Academy Television Awards and the Royal Television Society) and the 1997 Jimmy McGovern serial The Lakes.\nIn 1998, he and fellow producer George Faber set up their own independent production company, Company Pictures. The company has produced several notable and award-winning series and one-offs, such as Shameless, The Life and Death of Peter Sellers, Skins, Elizabeth I, Talk to Me and Wild At Heart. In 2014, he executive produced The Missing for New Pictures. He is also set to executive produce the upcoming supernatural drama television series Requiem.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Our Friends in the North", "response": ["In 1992, Wearing was able to persuade the controller of BBC Two, Alan Yentob, to commission Peter Flannery to write scripts for a new version of the project. Yentob had no great enthusiasm for Our Friends in the North, as he remembered a meeting with Flannery in 1988, when the writer had left him unimpressed by stating that Our Friends in the North was about \"post-war social housing policy\".Eaton, p. 18 As Wearing was now a head of department at the BBC, he was too busy overseeing other projects to produce Our Friends in the North.Eaton, p. 21 George Faber was briefly attached to the project as producer before he moved on to become Head of Single Drama at the BBC. Faber was succeeded by a young producer with great enthusiasm for the project, Charles Pattinson.Eaton, p. 23", "The scale of Our Friends in the North required BBC Two controller Michael Jackson to devote a budget of \u00a38\u00a0million to the production, which was half of his channel's drama serials budget for the entire year. Producer Charles Pattinson attempted to gain co-production funding from overseas broadcasters, but met with a lack of interest. Pattinson believed it was because the story was so much about Britain and had limited appeal to other countries.Born, p. 359 BBC Worldwide, the corporation's commercial arm which sells its programmes overseas, offered only \u00a320,000 of funding towards the production. The speaking cast of Our Friends in the North numbered 160; more than 3,000 extras were used, and filming took place across 40 weeks, from November 1994 until September 1995.Eaton, p. 130", "After Stuart Urban left the production and the decision had been made to re-shoot some of the material that he had completed with Pedr James directing, producer Charles Pattinson suggested to Peter Flannery that the first episode should not simply be remade, but also rewritten.Eaton, p. 30 Flannery took the opportunity to completely change the opening storyline, introducing the love story element between Nicky and Mary earlier. This was introduced in later episodes of the television version, but had not been part of the original play. Other storyline and character changes were made with the new version of the first episode because it was the script that had most closely resembled the original stage play. Michael Wearing felt that the story could be expanded to a greater degree for television."]}, {"page": "Jimmy McGovern", "response": ["| David Blair, Charles Pattinson"]}, {"page": "Company Pictures", "response": ["Company Pictures is an independent British television production company which has produced drama programming for many broadcasters.About Us - Company Pictures It was set up in 1998 by Charles Pattinson and George Faber, colleagues at BBC Films.
