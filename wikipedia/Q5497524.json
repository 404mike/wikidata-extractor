The Royal Flying Corps recon pilots began to use cameras for recording their observations in 1914 and by the Battle of Neuve Chapelle in 1915, the entire system of German trenches was being photographed. In 1916 the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy made vertical camera axis aerial photos above Italy for map-making."]}, {"page": "1975 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 27 October \u2013 Frederick Charles Victor Laws, Royal Air Force officer, pioneer of aerial reconnaissance (born 1887)"]}, {"page": "Aerial reconnaissance", "response": ["Frederick Charles Victor Laws started experiments in aerial photography in 1912 with  No. 1 Squadron RAF using  the British dirigible  Beta.

Laws was initially a Sergeant in the RFC and had a passion for photography. Despite Field Marshall Haig's reputed maxim that reconnaissance was best achieved by the Cavalry,There is some doubt that Haig actually said this; in the citation from Air Power Review, it mentions that it is more likely to be attributable to a technophobic officer under Haigh's command or part of his headquarters staff. Laws and his cohort proved that aerial photography could provide information at a level of accuracy unseen before in theatres of war."]}, {"page": "1946 New Year Honours (Order of the Bath)", "response": ["*Group Captain Frederick Charles Victor Laws, ."]}]}}
