He went down the order in 1958, when the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) asked Warwickshire to promote Smith to develop him for a possible England opening spot.  Horner scored quickly, and enjoyed his best three seasons from 1959 to 1961.  On a flat Oval pitch in 1960 he scored a career-best 203 not out, and put on 377 with Billy Ibadulla for the first wicket on the first day, then the highest unbroken opening partnership in cricket history. He was quick in the covers and took 131 catches. He retired in 1965 to concentrate on landscape gardening and his work as a cricket groundsman."]}, {"page": "Fred Gardner", "response": ["*Fred Gardner (activist), American activist and author", "*Fred Gardner (cricketer) (1922\u20131979), English cricketer and footballer", "*Fred Gardner (rugby league) (1909-1999), Australian rugby league footballer"]}, {"page": "List of Warwickshire County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Fred Gardner (1947\u20131961) : F.
