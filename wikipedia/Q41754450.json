As a student in 1858 at Cambridge University, he played in a single first-class cricket match for the university side. He was born at Lancing, Sussex and died at Cowes, Isle of Wight.\nThe son of the vicar of Lancing, Watson was educated at the innovative Clapham Grammar School in south London under the headmastership of Charles Pritchard and at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. His cricket career was brief: records survive only for matches he played in the 1858 season, plus a single later game in 1865, and only one somewhat-truncated match was later rated as first-class. In it, he played as a lower-order batsman and as a bowler, taking one wicket, though neither his bowling nor his batting styles are known.Watson graduated from Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1859, and this converted to a Master of Arts in 1863. He was ordained as a Church of England deacon in 1862 and as a priest the following year; in 1862 he became curate of Neston, Cheshire. Rather than pursuing a career in the church, however, Watson went into education, and in 1863 he returned to his own school, Clapham Grammar, as an assistant master and chaplain. In 1864, he married the daughter of a clergyman from Cowes on the Isle of Wight and from then until his death in 1920 he was headmaster of the Grange School at Cowes.Watson's son, Arthur Lacon Watson, had a similarly brief first-class cricket career for Hampshire and Cambridge University in the 1880s.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Arthur Watson", "response": ["Arthur Watson may refer to:", "* Arthur Watson (footballer, died 1937) (1870\u20131937), English footballer for Notts County", "* Arthur Watson (footballer, died 1931) (1870\u20131931), English footballer who played for Sheffield United", "* Arthur Watson (footballer, born 1913) (1913\u20131995), English football full back who played for Lincoln City, Chesterfield and Hull City", "* Arthur Watson (Australian footballer) (1902\u20131983), Australian rules footballer", "* Arthur Watson (journalist) (1880\u20131969), British newspaper editor", "* Arthur Watson (cricketer, born 1835) (1835\u20131920), English cricketer and father of the next", "* Arthur Watson (cricketer, born 1866) (1866\u20131955), English cricketer", "* Arthur Watson (cricketer, born 1884) (1884\u20131952), English cricketer", "* Arthur Watson (umpire) (born 1940), Australian cricket umpire", "* Arthur Watson, director of the Baltimore City Zoo", "* Arthur Watson (priest) (1864\u20131952), Archdeacon of Richmond"]}, {"page": "Arthur Watson (cricketer, born 1866)", "response": ["*Arthur Watson at Cricinfo", "*Arthur Watson at CricketArchive"]}]}}
