He fired his 75mm gun but the shot bounced off German tank. He was unable to fire again as the Sherman's gun was jammed. By now, the Tiger Tank was traversing its gun towards Gorman's Sherman so he ordered his driver L/Cpl James Brown to ram the German Tank. The collision disabled the Tiger and caused its crew to bail out. After seeing his own crew to safety, Lt Gorman commandeered a Firefly, Ballymena, whose commander had been killed and continued to fire at the Tiger tank with the Firefly's 17-pounder gun until the Tiger's destruction was complete. For this action Lt John Gorman was awarded the Military Cross and his driver L/Cpl James Brown was awarded the Military Medal, being the first of the Allied Expeditionary Forces to knock out a Tiger II. However, the German account is rather different. The Tiger II gunner, Hans-Joachim Thaysen, insisted he never even saw Gorman's Sherman and was instead concentrating on firing ahead of him. Thaysen also said that it was a German anti tank gun friendly fire incident which was likely trying to fire at Gorman's Sherman that destroyed his Tiger II,  which caused the crew to bail out. The 75mm PaK hit the Tiger II on the left side between the track and running gear. Thaysen said the round penetrated and just missed him under his backside."]}, {"page": "Irish Guards", "response": ["*Sir John Gorman, politician"]}, {"page": "Catholic unionist", "response": ["*Sir John Gorman, UUP MLA for North Down from 1998 to 2003."]}, {"page": "Sir John Gorman", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Gorman (politician)"]}, {"page": "Northern Ireland Forum", "response": ["|David Trimble, John Taylor, John Gorman, Antony Alcock, Jack Allen, Fred Parkinson, Josias Cunningham, Dennis Rogan, James Cooper, Jim Nicholson"]}, {"page": "John Gorman (NI)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Gorman (politician)"]}, {"page": "Rockport School", "response": ["* Sir John Gorman, soldier, Unionist politician"]}, {"page": "John Gorman", "response": ["John Gorman may refer to:", "*John Gorman (director) (1884\u20131936), American movie director", "*John Gorman (entertainer) (born 1936), English vocalist and musician", "*John Gorman (politician) (1923\u20132014), Northern Ireland politician", "*John Gorman (footballer) (born 1949), former football player and coach", "*John Gorman (radio executive) (born 1950), WMMS radio personality"]}, {"page": "List of members of the 1st Northern Ireland Assembly", "response": [":John Gorman"]}, {"page": "Members of the Northern Ireland Forum", "response": ["*John Gorman"]}, {"page": "1923 in Northern Ireland", "response": ["*1 February \u2013 Sir John Gorman, Ulster Unionist Party MLA for North Down."]}, {"page": "North Down (Assembly constituency)", "response": ["| John Gorman(UUP)"]}, {"page": "Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly", "response": ["|Sir John Gorman 31 January 2000 \u2013 19 February 2002 "]}, {"page": "History of the Irish Guards", "response": ["Following the Normandy landings on 6 June 1944, the 2nd and 3rd Irish Guards were landed in France on 25 June to take part in the Normandy Campaign. The Irish Guards, as part of the Guards Armoured Division, took part in Operation Goodwood (18\u201320 July). The Division's objective was Cagny, Vimont and the surrounding area. During 18 July 1944, near Cagny, Lieutenant (later Sir) John Gorman of the 2nd Battalion, Irish Guards was in his Sherman tank when he was confronted by a far superior German Tiger II or 'King Tiger'. Gorman's tank fired one shot at the Tiger II, but the shot bounced off its thick armour. The Sherman's gun jammed before a second shot could be fired, and Gorman then gave the order to ram the Tiger II just as it was beginning to turn its massive 88mm gun on his tank. The Sherman smashed into the Tiger II, the collision disabling both tanks. The crews of both tanks then bailed out. Lieutenant Gorman, once he had seen his crew to safety, returned to the scene in a commandeered Sherman Firefly and destroyed the King Tiger. He was awarded the Military Cross for his actions, while the driver from his own crew, Lance-Corporal James Baron, won the Military Medal. The Irish Guards were involved in the further fighting that raged around Cagny for the rest of the day. Cagny, devastated by heavy bombing, was finally liberated by the Guards on the morning of 19 July. The Irish Guards also saw action in Operation Bluecoat launched on 30 July which saw the British capture the strategically important high ground around the Mont Pincon area. Following the breakout from Normandy and rapid advance through the more open French terrain, the 2nd and 3rd Irish Guards crossed the River Seine on 29 August and began the advance into Belgium with the rest of the Guards Armoured Division towards Brussels which was liberated on 3 September."]}, {"page": "Index of World War II articles (J)", "response": ["# John Gorman (politician)"]}, {"page": "MacGorman", "response": ["Early bearers of the surname are William Gorman in 1296 and Adam Garman in 1327.
