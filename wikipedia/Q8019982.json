Walton's batting style is unknown.  He was born at Holborn in London.\nWalton made his first-class cricket debut for a Kent XI against Surrey at Sevenoaks Vine in 1828.  He was dismissed for 6 runs in Kent's first-innings of 177, though which bowler dismissed him is not recorded.  Surrey made 66 in their first-innings, with Kent making 84 in their second-innings, with Walton scoring 13 runs before he was dismissed by William Mathews.  Surrey were dismissed for 41 in their second-innings, to lose the match by 154 runs.
