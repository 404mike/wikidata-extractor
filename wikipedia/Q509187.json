However, some researchers before the midpoint of the century did assert Plato had an oral teaching. These included John Burnet, Julius Stenzel, Alfred Edward Taylor, L\u00e9on Robin, Paul Wilpert, and Heinrich Gomperz. Since 1959, the fully worked out interpretation of the T\u00fcbingen School has carried on an intense rivalry with the anti-esoteric approach.The rivalry began with Harold Cherniss,  The Riddle of the Early Academy (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1945), and Gregory Vlastos, review of H. J. Kraemer, Arete bei Platon und Aristoteles, in Gnomon, v. 35, 1963, pp. 641-655.
