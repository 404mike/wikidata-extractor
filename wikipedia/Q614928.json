One of the trials forced him to miss the second Swansea encounter of the season, played away on 12 November 1966; his place in the Llanelli team was given to a youth debutant from the Felinfoel club, Phil Bennett.Hughes (1986) p. 199 Bennett became one of the greatest fly-halves produced by Wales, but he was kept from the Wales squad in his early career by the presence of John.Thomas (1979) p. 182 In 1966, John was awarded his first international cap for Wales, taking David Watkins place at fly-half for the match against the touring Australia team.Thomas (1979) p. 154 This was seen as a surprise move by the Welsh Rugby Union selectors, as Watkins had recently returned from a British Lions tour where he was team captain. Wales lost to Australia 11\u20134, the first time the Welsh had been beaten by the 'Wallabies', due to poor form in the midfield, with the criticism aimed at John, Gerald Davies and John Dawes.Sports historian Wayne Thomas in his 1979 book A Century of Welsh Rugby Players (p. 162) places criticism for this loss on the midfield players. Stating \"John himself escaped the worst criticism even though guilty of poor positioning to take Allan Lewis's long pass\". Conversely, John's play during this game is praised by other sources. David Watkins in his 1979 autobiography \"The David Watkins Story\" (p. 101) wrote: \"He [John] played very well and I knew he would retain his place against Scotland,\". John himself, in his 1974 autobiography (p. 69-70), wrote that he \"...hadn't played a blinder... but I hadn't made a lot of mistakes\", and follows this up with an extract from Cliff Morgan's after-match report which stated: \"Barry John had a grand first international and looked as if he could beat the defence at any time.\" Although experiencing defeat in his first international, John managed to gain revenge over Australia just over a month later when the same team faced Llanelli at Stradey Park. Llanelli beat the Wallabies 11\u20130 after a bruising forward contest. John himself scored a try, and then added to his tally with a dropped goal."]}, {"page": "Phil Bennett", "response": ["Cliff Morgan's now legendary commentary of the try describes it thus:"]}, {"page": "Barbarian F.C.", "response": ["Cliff Morgan described Gareth Edwards' try:"]}, {"page": "David Duckham", "response": ["He was the only English back in the 1973 Barbarians side that beat the All Blacks 23\u201311 at Cardiff Arms Park. In the first half he made a run that has become part of rugby lore, that brought gasps and cheers from a Welsh crowd more accustomed to regarding him with hostility. When he broke through the All Black defence, he appeared to confuse the commentator, Cliff Morgan, who did not know whether Duckham had sidestepped or dummied. He even sent the cameraman the wrong way; his change of direction was such that the camera went to the right and Duckham disappeared out of shot to the left."]}, {"page": "Wales national rugby union team", "response": ["* 1991 \u2013 Cliff Jones, Cliff Morgan"]}, {"page": "Rugby union positions", "response": ["Fly-halves in the International Rugby Hall of Fame include Cliff Morgan, as well as fellow Welshman Phil Bennett, the latter of whom unleashed two great sidesteps to set up what some have described as \"the greatest try of all time\". South African Naas Botha scored 312 points (including a record 17 drop goals) despite playing most of his career when the Springboks were boycotted. Australia's Mark Ella used his vision, passing skills and game management to orchestrate a new flat-back attacking style. Grant Fox was one of the most respected goal-kickers who scored more than 1,000 points in all matches for New Zealand. Barry John was known simply as \"the king\" to Welsh rugby fans and was rated third in the 1971 BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award. Jack Kyle is widely considered Ireland's greatest player. Michael Lynagh took over fly-half from Ella and in his first test in that position scored an Australian record of 23 points against Canada. Bennie Osler played for South Africa from 1924 until 1933, during which he played a South African record of 17 consecutive games and scored a then world record of 14 points in one game against New Zealand.

Despite this, he still received tremendous criticism and many felt that he was not worthy enough to inherit the Welsh number 10 shirt of Barry John, Phil Bennett and Cliff Morgan, leading Jenkins to tailor his game to the demands of the modern game. He developed his tackling, passing and running skills, especially under the coaching of Graham Henry, and became an excellent distributor of the ball, notably his excellent flat passes, and also a strong runner.  In November 1993 he managed an international record eight successful penalty kicks at goal in Wales's 24-26 defeat to Canada. At the age of just 23, he passed Paul Thorburn to become Wales's record Test point scorer in a 29-19 win against Italy, in which he also equalled the record of 24 points in a game he had set against Canada."]}, {"page": "Question of Sport", "response": ["The first edition of A Question of Sport was broadcast on 5 January 1970.

Another notable player is Billy Cleaver from Treorchy, a member of the 1950 Grand Slam winning team.
