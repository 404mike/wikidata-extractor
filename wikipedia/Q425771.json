He freely distributed the DNA sample, later referred to as the Signer DNA, in early May 1950 at the meeting of the Faraday Society in London, and Wilkins was one of the recipients.

It was while Wilkins was away on holiday that Randall, in a letter in December 1950, assured Franklin that \"as far as the experimental X-ray effort there would be for the moment only yourself and Gosling.\" Randall's lack of communication about this reassignment significantly contributed to the well documented friction that developed between Wilkins and Franklin. When Wilkins returned, he handed over the Signer DNA and Gosling to Franklin.", "On the structure of the crystalline DNA, Franklin first recorded the analysis in her notebook, which reads: \"Evidence for spiral [meaning helical] structure. Straight chain untwisted is highly improbable. Absence of reflections on meridian in \u03c7talline [crystalline] form suggests spiral structure.\" An immediate discovery from this was that the phosphate group lies outside of the main DNA chain; she however could not make out whether there could be two or three chains. She presented their data at a lecture in November 1951, in King's College London. In her lecture notes, she wrote the following:The results suggest a helical structure (which must be very closely packed) containing 2, 3 or 4 co\u2010axial nucleic acid chains per helical unit, and having the phosphate groups near the outside.Franklin then named \"A\" and \"B\" respectively for the \"wet\" and \"crystalline\" forms. (The biological functions of A-DNA were discovered only 60 years later.) Because of the intense personality conflict developing between Franklin and Wilkins, Randall divided the work on DNA. Franklin chose the data rich \"A\" form while Wilkins selected the \"B\" form.Maddox, p. 155.Wilkins, p. 158.  thumb|A satirical death note of A-DNA helix by Franklin and Gosling.By the end of 1951 it became generally accepted at King's that the B-DNA was a helix, but after she had recorded an asymmetrical image in May 1952, Franklin became unconvinced that the A-DNA was a helix.Wilkins, p. 176. In July 1952, as a practical joke on Wilkins (who frequently expressed his view that both forms of DNA were helical), Franklin and Gosling produced a funeral notice regretting the 'death' of helical A-DNA, which runs:It is with great regret that we have to announce the death, on Friday 18th July 1952 of DNA helix (crystalline). Death followed a protracted illness which an intensive course of Besselised [referring to Bessel function that was used to analyse the X-ray diffraction patterns] injections had failed to relieve. A memorial service will be held next Monday or Tuesday. It is hoped that Dr M H F Wilkins will speak in memory of the late helix. [Signed Rosalind Franklin and Raymond Gosling.]During 1952, they worked at applying the Patterson function to the X-ray pictures of DNA they had produced. This was a long and labour-intensive approach but would yield significant insight into the structure of the molecule. Franklin was fully committed to experimental data and was sternly against theoretical or model buildings, as she said, \"We are not going to speculate, we are going to wait, we are going to let the spots on this photograph tell us what the [DNA] structure is.\" The X-ray diffraction pictures, including the landmark Photo 51 taken by Gosling at this time, have been called by John Desmond Bernal as \"amongst the most beautiful X-ray photographs of any substance ever taken\".Maddox, p. 153.", "* 2003, the Royal Society of Chemistry declared King's College London as \"National Historic Chemical Landmark\" and placed a plaque on the wall near the entrance of the building, with the inscription: \"Near this site Rosalind Franklin, Maurice Wilkins, Raymond Gosling, Alexander Stokes and Herbert Wilson performed experiments that led to the discovery of the structure of DNA.

The DNA from Signer's lab was much more intact than the DNA which had previously been isolated. Wilkins discovered that it was possible to produce thin threads from this concentrated DNA solution that contained highly ordered arrays of DNA suitable for the production of X-ray diffraction patterns.Wilkins, Maurice HF, 'The Molecular Configuration of Nucleic Acids'.  1962 Nobel lecture, 11 December 1962 Using a carefully bundled group of these DNA threads and keeping them hydrated, Wilkins and a graduate student Raymond Gosling obtained X-ray photographs of DNA that showed that the long, thin DNA molecule in the sample from Signer had a regular, crystal-like structure in these threads. Gosling later said \"When... I first saw all those discrete diffraction spots ...emerging on the film in the developing dish was a truly eureka moment....we realised that if DNA was the gene material then we had just shown that genes could crystallize!James D. Watson, The Annotated and Illustrated Double Helix p25\" This initial X-ray diffraction work at King's College was done in May or June 1950. It was one of the X-ray diffraction photographs taken in 1950, shown at a meeting in Naples a year later, that sparked James Watson's interest in DNAWilkins, p 138 causing him to write \"suddenly I was excited about chemistry.....I began to wonder whether it would be possible for me to join Wilkins in working on DNA\".James D. Watson, The Annotated and Illustrated Double Helix p25-26 At that time Wilkins also introduced Francis Crick to the importance of DNA. Crick advised him to work on proteins telling Wilkins \"what you ought to do is find yourself a good protein\".Robert Olby; \"The Path to The Double Helix: Discovery of DNA\"; p354 Wilkins knew that proper experiments on the threads of purified DNA would require better X-ray equipment. Wilkins ordered a new X-ray tube and a new microcamera. He also suggested to Randall that the soon-to-be-appointed Rosalind Franklin should be reassigned from work on protein solutions to join the DNA effort.Wilkins, p 128", "Early in 1951 Franklin finally arrived. Wilkins was away on holiday and missed an initial meeting at which Raymond Gosling stood in for him along with Alex Stokes, who, like Crick, would solve the basic mathematics that make possible a general theory of how helical structures diffract X-rays. No work had been done on DNA in the laboratory for several months; the new X-ray tube sat unused, waiting for Franklin. Franklin ended up with the DNA from Signer, Gosling became her PhD student, and she had the expectation that DNA X-ray diffraction work was her project. Wilkins returned to the laboratory expecting, on the other hand, that Franklin would be his collaborator and that they would work together on the DNA project that he had started. The confusion over Franklin's and Wilkins' roles in relation to the DNA effort (which later developed into considerable tension between them) is clearly attributable to Randall. In his letter of appointment he told Franklin \"as far as the experimental X-ray effort [on DNA] is concerned, there will be at the moment only yourself and Gosling\".Wilkins, p 145 However, Randall never informed Wilkins of his decision to give Franklin sole responsibility for the DNA effort and Wilkins only learned of the letter years after Franklin's death. He later wrote \"My opinion is very clear: that Randall was very wrong to have written to Rosalind telling her that Stokes and I wished to stop our work on DNA, without consulting us. After Raymond [Gosling] and I got a clear crystalline X-ray pattern I was very eager to continue that work\u00a0...
