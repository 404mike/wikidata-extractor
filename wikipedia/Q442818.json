She campaigned for women's suffrage by legal change and in 1897\u20131919 led Britain's largest women's rights association, the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (NUWSS). She explained, \"I cannot say I became a suffragist. I always was one, from the time I was old enough to think at all about the principles of Representative Government.\" Fawcett tried to broaden women's chances of higher education, serving as a governor of Bedford College, London (now Royal Holloway) and co-founding Newnham College, Cambridge in 1875. In 2018, 100 years after the Representation of the People Act, she was the first woman honoured by a statue in Parliament Square.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Elizabeth Garrett Anderson", "response": ["Garrett Anderson was also active in the women's suffrage movement. In 1866, Garrett Anderson and Davies presented petitions signed by more than 1,500 asking that female heads of household be given the vote.Manton, p. 171 That year, Garrett Anderson joined the first British Women's Suffrage Committee. She was not as active as her sister, Millicent Garrett Fawcett, though Garrett Anderson became a member of the Central Committee of the National Society for Women's Suffrage in 1889. After her husband's death in 1907, she became more active. As mayor of Aldeburgh, she gave speeches for suffrage, before the increasing militant activity in the movement led to her withdrawal in 1911.Manton, pp. 338\u2013345 Her daughter Louisa, also a physician, was more active and more militant, spending time in prison in 1912 for her suffrage activities.Manton, p. 345"]}, {"page": "Mary Wollstonecraft", "response": ["Wollstonecraft's work was exhumed with the rise of the movement to give women a political voice. First was an attempt at rehabilitation in 1879 with the publication of Wollstonecraft's Letters to Imlay, with prefatory memoir by Charles Kegan Paul.Wollstonecraft, Mary. Letters to Imlay, with prefatory memoir by C. Kegan Paul. London: C. Kegan Paul, 1879. Full text. Then followed the first full-length biography, which was by Elizabeth Robins Pennell; it appeared in 1884 as part of a series by the Roberts Brothers on famous women. Millicent Garrett Fawcett, a suffragist and later president of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies, wrote the introduction to the centenary edition (i.e. 1892) of the Rights of Woman; it cleansed the memory of Wollstonecraft and claimed her as the foremother of the struggle for the vote.Gordon, 521.

As Emmline Pankhurst put it, they viewed votes for women no longer as \"a right, but as a desperate necessity\". At the state level, Australia and the United States had already granted suffrage to some women. American feminists such as Susan B. Anthony (1902) visited Britain. While WSPU was the best-known suffrage group, it was only one of many, such as the Women's Freedom League and the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (NUWSS) led by Millicent Garrett Fawcett. WSPU was largely a family affair, although externally financed. Christabel Pankhurst became the dominant figure and gathered friends such as Annie Kenney, Flora Drummond, Teresa Billington, Ethel Smyth, Grace Roe, and Norah Dacre Fox (later known as Norah Elam) around her.
