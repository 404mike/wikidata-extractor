He was a member of the band Metro, as well as a solo artist and songwriter.\nGodwin's song \"Criminal World\" was banned by the BBC on its initial release in 1977 due to bisexual overtones. Six years later, David Bowie covered \"Criminal World\" on his best-selling album, Let's Dance. Adam Sweeting of Melody Maker disliked the song, saying it made \"a strong plea for bulk erasure\", while in a 2011 review, BBC writer David Quantick called the song one of the best on the album. In 1982, Godwin's \"Images of Heaven\" became a \"cult favorite on New Wave radio stations\". The dance remix of his song \"Baby's in the Mountains\" was a big dance hit and described as \"intricate but direct\". Godwin's 1983 solo studio album, Correspondence was issued by Polydor Records.\nIn 1998, a number of his songs from his time with the band Metro, his early 1980s solo work, and a couple of new songs were released on CD titled Images of Heaven: The Best of Peter Godwin, released on Oglio Records. He wrote lyrics with a \"spiritual bent\" for Steve Winwood's 2008 album Nine Lives.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Midge Ure", "response": ["In 1981, Ultravox recorded their second album with Ure as frontman, Rage in Eden, which was a Top 5 hit in the UK. After its release Ure and Currie reconvened with Visage to record the band's second album, The Anvil. Released in early 1982, it was a Top 10 hit; but Ure left the band soon after its release, citing creative differences with frontman Steve Strange. The same year saw Ultravox record and release their third album with Ure, Quartet, with production by Beatles producer George Martin. The album became their third Top 10 hit and featured four Top 20 singles. This period saw Ure work as a producer for other artists, amongst them Steve Harley, Skids, Peter Godwin, and Strasse, and in 1982 Ure released his first solo single, a cover of the 1968 Tom Rush song \"No Regrets\" (based on the 1975 hit cover version by The Walker Brothers), which made the UK Top 10.
