He was subsequently elected to Armagh County Council.Before the 1958 general election, Richardson announced that he would contest South Armagh.  A nationalist convention was held in the constituency, but it decided not to put up a candidate against Richardson.  As a result, he was elected, and immediately joined the Nationalist Party group.From 1965 to 1969, Richardson served as the Shadow Minister for Sport. He was the only Nationalist MP not to shadow an actual Minister.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Crossmaglen", "response": ["*Edward George Richardson - Member of Parliament for South Armagh, Nationalist Party and Independent Nationalist"]}, {"page": "List of members of the 11th House of Commons of Northern Ireland", "response": ["|Edward George Richardson"]}, {"page": "List of members of the 10th House of Commons of Northern Ireland", "response": ["|Edward George Richardson"]}, {"page": "List of members of the 9th House of Commons of Northern Ireland", "response": ["|Edward George Richardson", "* Edward George Richardson elected as an Independent Nationalist, but joined the Nationalist Party on election.", "*1958: Edward George Richardson joins the Nationalist Party grouping."]}, {"page": "South Armagh (Northern Ireland Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|rowspan=2|Edward George Richardson"]}, {"page": "Edward Richardson (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Edward George Richardson (1903\u20131987), nationalist politician in Northern Ireland"]}]}}
