His precise date and place of birth are not known; he died at Taunton, Somerset. \nThomas was a tail-end batsman and an opening bowler; his batting and bowling styles are not known. He played in one first-class match in each of the 1901, 1904 and 1905 seasons for Somerset. His only first-class wicket came in his first game, against Oxford University in 1901. His only runs of any note came with a score of 23 in his 1904 game against Sussex. His final game was the solitary match played for Somerset by the legendary fast bowler Tom Richardson; in the game against the 1905 Australians, Thomas was the last batsman to play an innings alongside Richardson and his bowling figures of 0/65 were identical to Richardson's, as the Australians amassed 609 for four wickets, with Warwick Armstrong making an unbeaten 303.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Thomas", "response": ["John Thomas may refer to:", "* John Thomas (c. 1490\u20131540/42), British Member of Parliament for Truro", "* John Thomas (c. 1531\u20131581/90), British Member of Parliament for Mitchell ", "* John Thomas (Welsh politician) (born 1852), Welsh county councillor and miners' agent", "* John Thomas (British politician) (1897\u20131968), British Member of Parliament for Dover", "* John Thomas, Baron Thomas of Cwmgiedd (born 1947), British judge", "* John Thomas (New York politician) (1792\u20131866), New York politician", "* John Thomas (American general) (1724\u20131776), American general in the American Revolutionary War", "* John Thomas (VC) (1886\u20131954), English soldier and recipient of the Victoria Cross", "* John Thomas (bishop of Winchester) (1696\u20131781), previously Bishop of Salisbury", "* John Thomas (bishop of Rochester) (1712\u20131793), previously Dean of Westminster", "* John Thomas (bishop of Salisbury) (1691\u20131766), previously Bishop of St Asaph and Bishop of Lincoln", "* John Thomas (priest) (1736\u20131769), Welsh Anglican priest and antiquarian", "* John Thomas (Christadelphian) (1805\u20131871), British Christian theologian, and founder of the Christadelphians", "* John Thomas (American football) (born 1935), American football player for the San Francisco 49ers", "* John Thomas (Australian footballer) (1935\u20132011), Australian rules footballer for Geelong", "* John Thomas (athlete) (1941\u20132013), American high jumper", "* John Thomas (Australian cricketer) (1852\u20131915), cricketer for Tasmania", "* John Thomas (English cricketer) (1879\u20131949), cricketer for Somerset", "* John Thomas (basketball) (born 1975), American basketball player", "* John Thomas (figure skater) (born 1960), Canadian ice dancer", "* John Thomas (Welsh footballer) (died 1920), Welsh footballer for Sheffield United and Gainsborough Trinity in the 1890s", "* John Thomas (Irish footballer), Irish international footballer", "* John Thomas (footballer, born 1958), English footballer for Preston North End and Bolton Wanderers", "* John Thomas (ice hockey) (1936\u20131995), Australian ice hockey player", "* John Thomas (lacrosse) (born 1952), American lacrosse player", "* John Thomas (bowls), Welsh international lawn and indoor bowler", "* John Thomas (baseball), American baseball player", "* John Thomas (harpist) (1826\u20131913), Welsh composer and musician", "* \"Big\" John Thomas (1952\u20132016), British lead guitarist with Budgie", "* John Thomas (sculptor) (1813\u20131862), British sculptor who worked on British palaces", "* John Thomas Idlet (1931\u20132002), American Beat poet", "* John Thomas (cinematographer), winner of the 1995 Independent Spirit Award for Best Cinematography", "* John Thomas (screenwriter) (fl. late 20th century), co-screenwriter for the movie Predator", "* John Thomas (photographer) (1838\u20131905), Welsh photographer", "**John Thomas sign"]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* John Thomas (1901\u20131905) 3 matches CA"]}, {"page": "John Thomas (cricketer, born 1879)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Thomas (English cricketer)"]}]}}
