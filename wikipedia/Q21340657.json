His grandfather, Ephraim Mosely (1807-1873) held practice in Grosvenor Square and was the author of Teeth, their natural history: with the physiology of the human mouth, in regard to artificial teeth (1862). His father died when he was just aged two and was raised by his mother Malvina Marian (n\u00e9e Schlesinger) and her older sister who had moved to live in Hampstead, London. By 1901 the family moved to Kensington and Martin began to work as a bank clerk for a while and took an interest in fishing, possibly through Frederic M. Halford (1844-1914). They fished together at Mottisfont in Hampshire. Mosely joined the Fly Fishers' Club in 1905 where he also joined Hugh G. Franks on fishing trips. Mosely however gave up active fishing around 1912, possibly due to an accident in which he nearly drowned. Mosely was briefly involved with a natural fly committee which was interested in the study of insects. Halford had collected a fair number and he donated his cabinets to the Club and Mosely later described the specimens and added to the collection. Mosely helped edit the journal of the club from 1911 to 1931. Mosely was admitted as a Fellow of the Entomological Society of London in 1910, proposed by Malcolm Burr and seconded by Kenneth J. Morton."]}, {"page": "Gabrielle Patterson", "response": ["She was born in Maida Vale in London on 6 July 1905. She was the eldest of four children.
