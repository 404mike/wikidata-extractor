This shot usually consists of showing the quarterback throwing the football, then the camera zooming in to focus on the spinning ball, then, as the ball starts to descend, the camera zooms out, showing the end result of the ball traveling into the receiver's hands. NFL Films also dubs sound bites of local radio broadcasts over key plays, because radio announcers are typically more enthusiastic about their home teams than are network television broadcasters. In addition, NFL Films often uses multiple camera angles (with an emphasis on close-up shots that often exaggerate the speed of the players in real time).  The company's films also employ muscular orchestral scores from a wide variety of musicians, notably Sam Spence, Johnny Pearson (whose \"Heavy Action\" became the theme for Monday Night Football) Frank Rothman, Ralph Dollimore, Udi Harpaz, Malcolm Lockyer, Jan Stoeckart (under his varied stage names such as Jack Trombey), Peter Reno, Paul Lewis, Prameela Tomashek, Dave Robidoux and Tom Hedden.  The company's use of KPM Musichouse tracks also notably included Syd Dale; tracks include \"Maelstrom\" for the company's 1968 Minnesota Vikings season highlight reel and also the psychedelic-flavored jazz track \"Artful Dodger\" on the film recap of Super Bowl V, specifically during the montage which shows Johnny Unitas's 75-yard touchdown pass to John Mackey which was tipped in flight by Eddie Hinton and Mel Renfro before bounding to Mackey."]}, {"page": "Deadlier Than the Male", "response": ["Category:Films scored by Malcolm Lockyer"]}, {"page": "Ten Little Indians (1965 film)", "response": ["Category:Films scored by Malcolm Lockyer"]}, {"page": "C'est si bon", "response": ["In 1961, Bing Crosby recorded the song in English with musical arrangements by Bob Thompson and conducted by Malcolm Lockyer for his album Holiday in Europe, a collection of European hits."]}, {"page": "Island of Terror", "response": ["Category:Films scored by Malcolm Lockyer"]}, {"page": "Night of the Big Heat (film)", "response": ["Category:Films scored by Malcolm Lockyer"]}, {"page": "BBC Big Band", "response": ["The BBC Radio Orchestra was a large flexible studio ensemble on the Nelson Riddle/Henry Mancini model, with a full jazz Big Band and symphonic strings.
