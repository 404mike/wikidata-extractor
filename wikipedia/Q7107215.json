Brock served as assistant director of naval intelligence and then as assistant director of naval mobilisation at the Admiralty in the early years of the 20th century. During the First World War Brock commanded the battlecruiser HMS Princess Royal at the Battle of Heligoland Bight and at the Battle of Dogger Bank. He then commanded the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron with his flag in HMS Princess Royal at the Battle of Jutland.\nAfter the war Brock became Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff and then went on to be Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet. Following the Turkish victory in Anatolia at the end of the Greco-Turkish War, Brock organised the rescue of fleeing Greek civilians and, by skillful deployment of his ships, he dissuaded the advancing Turks, led by Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, from attacking the British garrison at Chanak in the Dardanelles neutral zone. For his diplomatic handling of the Chanak Crisis, Brock was commended by Leo Amery, the First Lord of the Admiralty, in the House of Commons in 1923.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Admiral of the Fleet (Royal Navy)", "response": ["|  || 100px || Brock OsmondSir Osmond Brock || 1869 || 1947 ||  ||"]}, {"page": "HMS Iron Duke (1912)", "response": ["On 2 September 1922, Iron Duke was steaming to the Dalmatian coast for a training cruise, when she received news of the Greek defeat in Turkey.

During the chaos, a number of refugees managed to come alongside Iron Duke in small boats, and were brought aboard the battleship.Halpern, p. 381 The following month, the Allies held a conference aboard Iron Duke at Mudania to mediate the Greco-Turkish dispute.

During the Battle of Dogger Bank she scored only a few hits, although one directly crippled the German armoured cruiser , which allowed the enemy vessel to be caught and sunk by the concentrated fire of the British battlecruisers. Shortly afterwards Princess Royal became the flagship of the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron, under the command of Rear Admiral Osmond Brock. She was moderately damaged during the Battle of Jutland and required a month and a half of repairs. Both ships spent the rest of the war on uneventful patrols in the North Sea, although they did provide distant cover during the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight in 1917.

The squadron had put to sea with the rest of the Battlecruiser Fleet, led by Beatty in Lion, to intercept a sortie by the High Seas Fleet into the North Sea. Hipper's battlecruisers spotted the British ships to their west by mid-afternoon and turned about to fall back on the German battleships, then about  behind him. Beatty turned to cut him off but was out of position to do that and had to settle for a pursuit. This began what was to be called the \"Run to the South\" as Beatty changed course to steer east south-east at 15:45, paralleling Hipper's course. The Germans opened fire first, three minutes later, followed almost immediately afterward by the British. The sisters were in the lead and were engaged by their opposite numbers, the battlecruisers,  and Derfflinger. Fire from both German ships was very accurate, and both Lion and Princess Royal were hit twice within three minutes of the Germans' opening fire.Tarrant, pp. 69, 71, 75, 80\u201383"]}, {"page": "HMS Princess Royal (1911)", "response": ["Completed in 1913, Princess Royal participated in the Battle of Heligoland Bight a month after the start of World War I in August 1914.
