His first major official commission was a mural for the 1951 Festival of Britain, in the Country Pavilion, for the Milk Marketing Board.  In the same year, he was also commissioned to create the scenic design for the premiere of Fate\u2019s Revenge by the Ballet Rambert.Throughout the 1950s, he contributed witty line illustrations, decorations and cartoons to  Lilliput, for which he also painted several covers in colour, Punch, Picture Post, Scope, and Good Housekeeping, for which he drew a regular series entitled \"Semolina Silkpaws\".  He also illustrated a series of full-colour booklets for Guinness advertising campaigns.  Other important advertising work included elegant watercolour covers for Fortnum & Mason catalogues.In the early 1960s, he moved with his wife Iris to St Ives in Cornwall, so he could diversify from \"commercial art\" into painting and other endeavours.  As well as developing his noted series of surreal paintings in oil, which were sold through the Portal Gallery in London, he set up, with Iris, an initiative called \"Studio 22\".  Together, they designed and made ceramic jewellery, art pottery and beach clothes such as kaftans.\nThey moved back to London in the 1970s, where Ronnie continued to paint for the Portal Gallery and provide illustrations for  the Bond Street fashion emporium, Ports.  However, he was increasingly drawn to book illustration.  Alongside a successful series in collaboration with the poet Gavin Ewart \u2013 The Learned Hippopotamus (1986), Caterpillar Stew (1990) and Like It Or Not (1992) \u2013 he began writing children\u2019s stories as well as illustrating them.\nHis first book as both writer and artist, Osbert And Lucy (1988), was successful not only in Britain but also in the USA, and was translated into several European languages.  It was subsequently included in the 2003 anthology, The Hutchinson Book of Bunny Tales.  His second book, Bumpity And the Big Snake, was published in 1994.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Lilliput (magazine)", "response": ["Contributors included H. E.

Benson's advertising, primarily drawn by the artist John Gilroy, in the 1930s and 1940s. Benson created posters that included phrases such as \"Guinness for Strength\", \"Lovely Day for a Guinness\", \"Guinness Makes You Strong\", \"My Goodness My Guinness\" (or, alternatively, \"My Goodness, My Christmas, It's Guinness!\"), and most famously, \"Guinness is Good For You\". The posters featured Gilroy's distinctive artwork and more often than not featured animals such as a kangaroo, ostrich, seal, lion and notably a toucan, which has become as much a symbol of Guinness as the harp. (An advertisement from the 1940s ran with the following jingle: \"Toucans in their nests agree/Guinness is good for you/Try some today and see/What one or toucan do.\") Dorothy L. Sayers and Bobby Bevan copywriters at Benson's also worked on the campaign; a biography of Sayers notes that she created a sketch of the toucan and wrote several of the adverts in question. Guinness advertising paraphernalia, notably the pastiche booklets illustrated by Ronald Ferns, attract high prices on the collectable market."]}, {"page": "List of alumni of Saint Martin's School of Art", "response": ["* Ronald Ferns"]}, {"page": "Fern (name)", "response": ["* Ronald Ferns, English illustrator, designer, cartoonist and surrealist painter"]}]}}
