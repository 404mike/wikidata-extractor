In July 1986 Lord Londonderry hosted a memorable Liszt Festival at Wynyard Park, which included three recitals by Earl Wild - probably the last great living pianist with direct links to the Romantic tradition (Liszt in particular) - and lectures by the world's leading scholars and educators of piano repertoire and performance, such as Professor Bryce Morrison.
