Renowned for his lavish spending and flamboyant lifestyle, he converted the family chapel inside the house into a performance space called the Gaiety Theatre. Plays were put on regularly, with \"the Dancing Marquess\" often taking the lead role himself. The 5th Marquess's extravagant spending drained the family fortune, and after his death in 1905, 6th Marquess began to sell off assets to help restore the solvency of the family. The family also sold off their main home at Beaudesert and their London house, and moved into Plas Newydd permanently. The 6th Marquess made the final big changes to the house by removing the crenellations from the roof, disposing of the theatre, knocking three servants' rooms together to make the dining room and covering over a courtyard to provide a roof for the servants. In the 1930s the artist Rex Whistler was a regular visitor to Plas Newydd. He painted numerous portraits of Lady Caroline Paget, and in 1936-38 painted the largest canvas painting in the UK.National trust feature: Talented young artist at Plas Newydd It is a trompe-l'\u0153il seascape painting that fills a whole wall of the dining room with an imagined scene of Italianate churches, castles, Snowdonian mountains and a complete harbour wall, with tricks of perspective that mean the scenes appear to change when seen from different parts of the room.Standpoint Magazine: Book review of 'In Search of Rex Whistler' by Hugh and Mirabel Cecil, 2013"]}, {"page": "Paget", "response": ["* Lady Caroline Paget (1913\u20131973), British socialite and actress"]}, {"page": "List of bisexual people (A\u2013F)", "response": ["| Society figure, married to bisexual Lady Caroline Paget"]}, {"page": "List of bisexual people (N\u2013S)", "response": ["| Lady Caroline Paget"]}, {"page": "Caroline Paget", "response": ["*Lady Caroline Paget (1913\u20131973), daughter of Charles Paget, 6th Marquess of Anglesey and Lady Victoria Manners, eldest daughter of the 8th Duke of Rutland."]}, {"page": "Elizabeth Parrish Starr", "response": ["In 1921, Starr bought a castle that was actually an old country house, Castello San Peyre, at Opio.
