Other additions of left half Tommy Casey from Newcastle United and inside forward Tommy Cavanagh from Doncaster Rovers together with the return of Jimmy Rogers from Coventry City all gave City fans hope of a good season but by mid September the side were bottom of the table and between 21 November 1959 and the end of the season the \"Robins\" never rose above the two relegation places eventually being relegated as 22nd and bottom of the table. The season was beset by injury with McCann breaking his leg in Boxing Day match and Graham scoring 8 goals from only 14 appearances through persistent knee injuries. Atyeo finished a disappointing season as one of only two ever presents in the team, the other being the goalkeeper Tony Cook. Atyeo was also joint top scorer for Bristol City with 16 goals from his 42 appearances. Rogers also scored 16 goals from only 31 appearances on his return to Ashton Gate. Manager Peter Doherty was dismissed on 15 March and relegation confirmed by defeat at Leyton Orient on 23 April. The new manager Fred Ford was not appointed until July 1960."]}, {"page": "Tony Cook", "response": ["Tony Cook may refer to:", "* Tony Cook (rugby union), English rugby union player", "* Tony Cook (athlete) (born 1936), Australian Olympic marathon runner", "* Tony Cook (musician), dance music producer and former drummer for James Brown", "* Tony Cook (footballer, born 1929) (1929\u20131996), English football goalkeeper", "* Tony Cook (footballer, born 1976), English football midfielder"]}]}}
