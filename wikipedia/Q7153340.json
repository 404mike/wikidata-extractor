Speaking at the 1957 Labour Party conference, he decried unilateral nuclear disarmament, saying \"It would send a British Foreign Secretary naked into the conference-chamber\". This statement is often misconstrued: Bevan argued that unilateralism would result in Britain's loss of allies, and one interpretation of his metaphor is that nakedness would come from the lack of allies, not the lack of weapons. According to the journalist Paul Routledge, Donald Bruce, a former MP and Parliamentary Private Secretary and adviser to Bevan, had told him that Bevan's shift on the disarmament issue was the result of discussions with the Soviet government, where they advised him to push for British retention of nuclear weapons so they could possibly be used as a bargaining chip in negotiations with the United States."]}, {"page": "Airey Neave", "response": ["Neave's biographer Paul Routledge met a member of the Irish Republican Socialist Party (the political wing of INLA) who was involved in the killing of Neave and who told Routledge that Neave \"would have been very successful at that job [Northern Ireland Secretary].

He writes that Kevin Hunt, the NCB director of industrial relations, had asked Scargill in advance if he would allow more tonnage to be allowed out of Orgreave, which led Scargill to believe that Orgreave was a pressure point that he should target. The picketing of working pits in Nottinghamshire lost momentum after Orgreave, partly because many pickets were given bail conditions after being arrested, and the number of strikers in Nottinghamshire decreased."]}, {"page": "Nick Brown", "response": ["In the 1994 Labour leadership election, he supported Gordon Brown and acted as his unofficial campaign manager and, according to biographer Paul Routledge, advised against him pulling out of the contest in Blair's favour."]}, {"page": "Normanton, West Yorkshire", "response": ["*Paul Routledge \u2013 writer and journalist"]}, {"page": "Kenneth Woolmer, Baron Woolmer of Leeds", "response": ["After a special conference of the Labour Party endorsed an electoral college for future elections of the party leader, Woolmer signed a statement deploring the outcome. He volunteered as Secretary of Solidarity, a group which campaigned against the far left within the Labour Party and to stop further defections to the Social Democratic Party.Dianne Hayter, \"Fightback! Labour's traditional right in 1970s and 1980s\", Manchester University Press, 2005, p. 131-2.

However, his best remembered book is a posthumously published novel, No Love For Johnnie, a cynical portrayal of British politics in the late 1950s that was later adapted as a film starring Peter Finch. The novel seems to give vent to Fienburgh's deepseated concerns about corruption in politics. According to Michael Rush, in The Selection of Parliamentary Candidates (1969), Fienburgh claimed in 1955 that \"the Labour Party is the only party in Britain in which you can buy a seat\". One near-contemporary critic, Alan Lovell, writing in the New Left Review in 1961, considered No Love For Johnnie a \"bad novel\" and wrote that \"Fienburgh seems to have had no conception of what idealism means\". Derek Jewell, writing in 1967, called it \"a bitter study of political life\". Geoffrey Wheatcroft in The Observer in 2001 suggested that No Love for Johnnie was the archetype of a genre that he named \"the Labour Party novel of disillusionment\". In the New Statesman in 2000 Paul Routledge idescribed the novel as being highly prescient about New Labour."]}, {"page": "Elizabeth II", "response": ["Since Elizabeth rarely gives interviews, little is known of her personal feelings. She has not explicitly expressed her own political opinions in a public forum, and it is against convention to ask or reveal her views. During the miners' strike of 1984\u201385 Times journalist Paul Routledge asked the Queen for her opinions on the strike, to which she replied that it was \"all about one man\" (a reference to Arthur Scargill), which Routledge disagreed with. Routledge was widely criticised in the media for asking the question; he said he was not initially due to be present for the Queen's visit and was unaware of the protocols. After the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, Prime Minister David Cameron said that she was pleased with the outcome. She had arguably issued a public coded statement about the referendum by telling one woman outside Balmoral Kirk that she hoped people would think \"very carefully\" about the outcome. It emerged later that Cameron had asked the Queen to register her concern."]}, {"page": "Campbell Adamson", "response": ["With the Industrial Relations Act coming into effect, at the beginning of August 1972 Adamson agreed with Victor Feather of the TUC to set up an independent conciliation and advice service. According to Feather both sides saw this as one means of minimising the use of the Act.Paul Routledge, \"Use of industry Act to be kept to minimum\", The Times, 3 August 1972, p. 1. Through 1973 the government, CBI and TUC tried to establish a working relationship which suited all, but were unable to do so before the economic effects of the oil price rise caused profound disruption to the British economy. On other issues Adamson was strongly supportive of the Government, including giving consistent backing to entry to the European Communities. His leadership in this area was said to be crucial.", "After the oil shock, the NUM renewed its claim for a substantial wage increase, a claim which broke government pay guidelines, and then began industrial action in the form of an overtime ban in support of the claim. The sudden shortage of coal in the middle of the winter forced the Government to announce a 'three-day week' of restrictions of electricity by industry. Adamson deplored the move but regarded it as the lesser of two evils because industry might not be able to operate at all.Paul Routledge, \"CBI wants more talks with the unions\", The Times, 22 December 1973, p. 15. Adamson supported the Government's refusal to concede the miners' pay claim because of concerns that other wage claims would follow, although he conceded that it could be supported if there was a watertight guarantee that other unions would settle within the limits.Peter Hill and Malcolm Brown, \"CBI tells of moves to help industry meet 3-day week cash problems\", The Times, 12 January 1974, p. 17."]}, {"page": "Battle of Saltley Gate", "response": ["The success of the NUM pickets at Saltley Gate was promoted by Arthur Scargill and many of his supporters as the decisive victory in the 1972 strike and evidence of the effectiveness of solidarity strikes and mass picketing.  However, Frank Walters has argued that victory was likely even without the success at Saltley Gate,The Saltley Incident, A Report by FL Ffoulkes, British Gas Corporation, March 1985 in  and Paul Routledge has argued that, in the long-term, the actions were counter-productive by prompting the Conservative Party to adopt a more adversarial attitude towards strikes. The Battle of Orgreave was the state's response in the 1984 miners' strike to mass picketing."]}, {"page": "Arthur Scargill", "response": ["The media characterised the strike as \"Scargill's strike\" and his critics accused him of looking for an excuse for industrial action since becoming union president. There was some controversy in February 1985 when Times journalist Paul Routledge engaged the Queen in discussion on the strike, and the Queen said that the strike was \"all about one man\", which Routledge objected to. Many politicians, including the then Labour leader Neil Kinnock, believed Scargill had made a huge mistake in calling the strike in the summer rather than in the winter. Scargill was often accompanied by his then wife Anne Harper to speak at picket lines and to media appearances; Harper was simultaneously involved in foundling and leading the National Women Against Pit Closures movement."]}, {"page": "Workers Revolutionary Party (UK)", "response": ["In order to \"kill the bill\" which became the Industrial Relations Act 1971, the SLL called for a general strike to force the government of  Edward Heath to call a general election.
