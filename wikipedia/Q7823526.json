Sedgwick argued that by the middle of the 18th century, the \"sexual identity\" of the onanist was well established in British disclosures and that Austen writing at the beginning of the 19th century would have been familiar with it.Sedgwick, Eve Kosofsky \"Jane Austen and the Masturbating Girl\" from Critical Inquiry, Volume 17, Summer 1991, page 825-826. Sedgwick used Austen's description of Marianne Dashwood, whose \"eyes were in constant inquiry\", whose \"mind was equally abstracted from everything actually before them\" as she was  \"restless and dissatisfied\" and unable to sit still.Sedgwick, Eve Kosofsky \"Jane Austen and the Masturbating Girl\" from Critical Inquiry, Volume 17, Summer 1991, page 828. She then compared Sense and Sensibility with the 1881 document \"Onanism and Nervous Disorders in Two Little Girls\" where the patient X has a \"roving eye\", \"cannot keep still\" and is \"incapable of anything\".Sedgwick, Eve Kosofsky \"Jane Austen and the Masturbating Girl\" from Critical Inquiry, Volume 17, Summer 1991, page 827-828. In Sedgwick's viewpoint, the description of Patient X, who could not stop masturbating and was in a constant state of hysteria as the doctor tried to keep her from masturbating by such methods as having her hands tied together, closely matched Austen's description of Marianne Dashwood. Sedgwick argued that both patient X and Dashwood were seen as suffering from an excess of sexuality that needed to be brought under control, arguing that though Elinor Dashwood did things considerably more gently than the doctor who repeatedly burned Patient X's clitoris both were agents of discipline and control.Sedgwick, Eve Kosofsky \"Jane Austen and the Masturbating Girl\" from Critical Inquiry, Volume 17, Summer 1991, page 830."]}, {"page": "List of University of Cambridge people", "response": ["*Tony Tanner (Jesus/King's)"]}, {"page": "An American Dream (novel)", "response": ["Joan Didion writing in Vogue called An American Dream \"the only serious New York novel since The Great Gatsby\".

Since 1965, An American Dream has been defended by Mailer's critics, some of which call it one of his better novels. Tony Tanner posits that a few critics likely found An American Dream to be \"outrageous\" due to their perception of it as a simple narrative and not as a surrealist work. Tanner hailed Leo Bersani's review of An American Dream as a \"brilliant comment on the novel as a whole\" because Bersani recognized the purposeful \"exuberance\" that Mailer used."]}, {"page": "The End of the Road", "response": ["Critics have been divided on whether Barth identified with the narrator's beliefs; this appeared probable to John Gardner, Richard W. Noland, and Tony Tanner, while Beverly Gross and Campbell Tatham believed the tragic ending demonstrates the contrary.  Philosopher Robert C. Solomon included excerpts from the book in a collection on existentialism.  Gardner objected to the book's absurdist philosophy, \"vulgarities of style\", and a \"touch of life-hate which reveals itself in the author's fascination with the ugly, the disgusting\"; Gardner found this \"fascination\" perplexing, as \"in other respects Barth seems all sunshine and good cheer\".  Christopher Conti saw a \"moral-satiric design\" also found in Nabokov's Lolita (1955) and Gardner's Grendel (1971), in which the reader is meant to see through the moral failings of the novels' \"monstrous narrators\"."]}, {"page": "The Recognitions", "response": ["Over time, the work gradually became recognized for its significance. David Madden observed that \"(a)n underground reputation has kept it on the brink of oblivion.\" Tony Tanner said that it inaugurated a new period in American fiction, foreshadowing and sometimes directly influencing the work of later ambitious novelists such as Joseph McElroy, Thomas Pynchon, Don DeLillo, and David Foster Wallace.\""]}, {"page": "Reception history of Jane Austen", "response": ["A very controversial article was \"Jane Austen and the Masturbating Girl\" by Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick that juxtaposed three treatments of female suffering, namely Marianne Dashwood's emotional frenzy when Willoughby abandons her, a 19th century medical account of the \"cure\" inflicted on a girl who liked to masturbate, and the critic Tony Tanner's \"vengeful\" treatment of Emma Woodhouse as a woman who had to be taught her place.Irvine 111. Sedgwick argued that the way the portrayal of Marianne as emotionally overwrought and too inclined to give in to her feelings very closely resembled the account of patient X, the teenage girl seen as too inclined to masturbate, and the way a male critic like Tanner attacked Woodhouse for her emotional self-indulgence was no different from the doctor imposing the gruesome and painful treatment on the masturbating girl.Irvine 111\u201312. Sedgwick says that the way Elinor disciplines Marianne, Tanner's \"vengeful\" views and the treatment given to patient X were all attempts to crush female sexuality as she maintained that \"emotional self-indulgence\" was merely a code-word for female masturbation. Sedgwick argued that characters such as Dashwood and Woodhouse, who did not precisely conform to the feminine ideals are symbols of both female and homosexual resistance to the ideal of heterosexuality and patriarchy as the norm for everyone.Irvine 112. Sedgwick's provoked an uproar in 1991, becoming a prime exhibit in the American \"culture war\" between liberals and conservatives."]}, {"page": "Anne Elliot", "response": ["Lady Russell overvalues inherited social class and so underestimates Wentworth and nearly cheats Anne of her only chance of happiness.

Thus, in the context of Meryton, without his past and his family being known, Wickham's lies are readily believed, and he is left to indulge in his weakness for gambling and debauchery. He is protected by the mask of his fine manners and the certainty that Darcy, anxious to preserve the reputation of his younger sister, would not stoop to denounce him.", "The omniscient narrator reveals nothing of the youth or the true nature of Wickham. The reader knows him only through what he says about himself and what is said about him, but only later in the story, by characters who knew him before: Darcy (at Rosings Park), and Mrs. Reynolds (at Pemberley). It is therefore difficult to get a fair idea of a character so difficult to define. If the Bingley family (who had never met him before their arrival in Hertfordshire) are only aware of the little Darcy has told them, Mrs. Reynolds, the housekeeper of Pemberley, has known Darcy and Wickham from infancy.Tony Tanner 1975, p. 119 She can confirm that he was raised at Pemberley at the expense of Mr. Darcy Senior, and knows that he is in the army, but fears that he has turned out badly: \"I am afraid he has turned out very wild\".", "At most, the narrator gives the reader a subtle warning by some facial expressions, some slight pauses (marked by dashes) some hesitations in his conversation. In this way, on the evening of their first meeting, Wickham asks Elizabeth, in a slightly hesitating manner, how long Darcy has been in Hertfordshire, then, \"after a short pause\", Elizabeth vividly assures him that all Meryton is \"disgusted by his pride\" and that no one has anything good to say about him, he begins to disclose his confidences to a partner who is all ears. Later, hearing Collins quote Lady Catherine, and \"after having observed her for a moment,\" he asks Elizabeth if she is closely linked to the De Bourgh family. She is convinced that what he says is true because he looks so honest, and that is what justifies and reinforces her dislike for Darcy.Tony Tanner 1975, p. 116  For Matt Brumit, when Wickham avoids the whist card game and sits with Elizabeth and Lydia to play lotteries, Wickham may be attempting to hide his gambling, rather than the sign of interest Elizabeth sees it as.", "Wickham, whose speech is full of duplicity and is skilled at making white look black Tony Tanner 1975, p.112 has certainly read with profit Lord Chesterfield's Letters to His Son, full of pragmatic, but also quite Machiavellian advice, to appear a true gentleman in society.", "As to the opinion of the inhabitants of Meryton, the narrator shows with some irony that it is unreliable and unpredictable:Tony Tanner 1975, p. 111 if Wickham is \"universally appreciated\" at the beginning, he is then considered, with the same exaggeration, as the most evil (wickedest) man in the world, and each one openly affirms that they were always highly suspicious of his apparent virtue: \"had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness\".", "In trying to seduce Georgiana and by fleeing with Lydia, he defied a moral edict and social convention,Reeta Sahney 1990, p. 35 that Jane Austen whose \"view of the world was through the Rectory window\"Reeta Sahney 1990, p. xiii neither could nor would excuse: while she offers her heroes a happy future based on affection, mutual esteem, and a controlled sexuality; Austen forces Wickham to marry Lydia,Reeta Sahney 1990, p. 9 who he quickly ceases to love. Although he had almost seduced Georgiana Darcy, and then paid attention to Mary King with her 10,000 pounds a year, Wickham runs off with Lydia and is bribed to marry her. It seems that he often runs away from his marriage to \"enjoy himself in London or Bath\", which critic Susannah Fullerton regards as being what Wickham deserves. But he does not have the stature of his predecessor, Lovelace,Tony Tanner 1975, p. 95. nor is he as thorough a villain. His rank of ensign in the regular army was the lowest and could be held by boys of 15, which Breihan and Caplan see as a sign of Darcy feeling that \"enough was enough!\" Wickham's career path in the North, where he might at any point be drawn into war, may reflect a desire for atonement and honest service.", "* Tony Tanner, Jane Austen, Harvard University Press, 1975, 291 p. , \"Knowledge and Opinions: 'Pride and Prejudice'\" (reissue 1986)"]}, {"page": "Max Saunders", "response": ["Saunders was educated at Sevenoaks School in Kent, and won an entrance scholarship to Queens' College, Cambridge.
