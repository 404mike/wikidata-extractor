Black also questioned how redesignating would work on the Wye Valley AONB, shared with England where renaming may not be applied. With opposition from Gower (home to Wales' first AONB) being increasingly vocal in their opposition. Critics describe the re-branding to be a potential turn off for tourism to the areas, and describe the AONB naming to have years of brand integrity. A Welsh Government spokesperson said that any renaming of the areas would be subject to a full public consultation. Supporters of renaming describe the term \"AONB\" to be \"unusual\" due to it being overly descriptive and emotive. Other supporters support the rename to include \"Wales\" in the title to provide some distinction to Wales' areas over AONBs remaining in England and Northern Ireland. The renaming was also proposed for AONBs elsewhere in the United Kingdom, and followed through by the Cotswolds AONB which rebranded itself to the Cotswolds National Landscape in 2020."]}, {"page": "Swansea University", "response": ["* Peter Black, MS for South Wales West"]}, {"page": "2003 National Assembly for Wales election", "response": ["| Peter Black"]}, {"page": "Patrick Jones (poet)", "response": ["In November 2008, Waterstone's cancelled an appearance from Jones at one of their stores, where he was expected to sign autographs and promote his new work, because of a planned protest by a religious pressure group over alleged blasphemy.
