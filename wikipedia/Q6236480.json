A leading intellectual, writer, anthologist, and critic, The Guardian (in a tribute titled \"My Hero\") and The Spectator were among several publications to describe Gross as \"the best-read man in Britain\". The Guardian's obituarist Ion Trewin wrote: \"Mr Gross is one good argument for the survival of the species\", a comment Gross would have disliked since he was known for his modesty. Charles Moore wrote in The Spectator: \"I am left with the irritated sense that he was under-appreciated. He was too clever, too witty, too modest for our age.\"Gross was the editor of The Times Literary Supplement from 1974 to 1981, senior book editor and book critic on the staff of The New York Times from 1983 to 1989, and theatre critic for The Sunday Telegraph from 1989 to 2005. He also worked as assistant editor on Encounter and as literary editor of The New Statesman and Spectator magazines.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Schindler's List", "response": ["Stephen Schiff of The New Yorker called it the best historical drama about the Holocaust, a film that \"will take its place in cultural history and remain there.\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four stars out of four and described it as Spielberg's best, \"brilliantly acted, written, directed, and seen.\" Ebert named it one of his ten favorite films of 1993. Terrence Rafferty, also with The New Yorker, admired the film's \"narrative boldness, visual audacity, and emotional directness.\" He noted the performances of Neeson, Fiennes, Kingsley, and Davidtz as warranting special praise, and calls the scene in the shower at Auschwitz \"the most terrifying sequence ever filmed.\" In the 2013 edition of his Movie and Video Guide, Leonard Maltin awarded the picture a four-out-of-four-star rating; he described the movie as a \"staggering adaptation of Thomas Keneally's best-seller\u00a0... with such frenzied pacing that it looks and feels like nothing Hollywood has ever made before\u00a0... Spielberg's most intense and personal film to date\". James Verniere of the Boston Herald noted the film's restraint and lack of sensationalism, and called it a \"major addition to the body of work about the Holocaust.\" In his review for The New York Review of Books, British critic John Gross said his misgivings that the story would be overly sentimentalized \"were altogether misplaced. Spielberg shows a firm moral and emotional grasp of his material. The film is an outstanding achievement.\" Mintz notes that even the film's harshest critics admire the \"visual brilliance\" of the fifteen-minute segment depicting the liquidation of the Krak\u00f3w ghetto. He describes the sequence as \"realistic\" and \"stunning\". He points out that the film has done much to increase Holocaust remembrance and awareness as the remaining survivors pass away, severing the last living links with the catastrophe. The film's release in Germany led to widespread discussion about why most Germans did not do more to help."]}, {"page": "List of winners and shortlisted authors of the Booker Prize", "response": ["| rowspan=\"6\"| John Gross"]}, {"page": "Golders Green Crematorium", "response": ["* John Gross, writer"]}, {"page": "The Times Literary Supplement", "response": ["The TLS first appeared in 1902 as a supplement to The Times but became a separate publication in 1914.
