This became Millais's first major popular success in this medium, and the artist went on to produce a number of other paintings on similar subjects to serve a growing middle class market for engravings.Jason Rosenfeld and Alison Smith, Millais, Tate Publishing, 2007, pp. 68, 76, 94-6, 110, 112; no. 57.
