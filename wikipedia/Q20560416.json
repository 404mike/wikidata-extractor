Educated at the Howell's School, Llandaff, where a policy was enacted to bar anyone from speaking Welsh, she began her career teaching the language in schools. In 1950 Rhys began a bookshop specialising in books in Welsh and university textbooks in Cardiff. The shop was successful academically, financially and socially and attracted many notable Welsh individuals. After retiring in 1968, she travelled the world, wrote two books on the subject and a biography on Evan Rees, the Archdruid of Wales.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Rhys", "response": ["* Beti Rhys, (1907\u20132003), Welsh bookstore owner and author"]}, {"page": "2003 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 5 April \u2013 Beti Rhys, Welsh author and bookseller (born 1908)"]}, {"page": "1908 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 2 April \u2013 Beti Rhys, Welsh author and bookseller (died 2003)"]}, {"page": "Deaths in April 2003", "response": ["*Beti Rhys, 96, Welsh bookseller and author."]}, {"page": "List of Welsh women", "response": ["*Beti Rhys (1907\u20132003), bookseller and author"]}, {"page": "Beti", "response": ["* Beti Rhys (1907\u20132003), Welsh bookstore owner and author"]}]}}
