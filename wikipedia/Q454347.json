The show was presented by Anne Robinson and narrated by Jon Briggs. It ran in different variations, originally as a daytime series but also at primetime and with celebrity contestants playing for charity with a modified set and format. The format has since been produced around the world, most notably in the United States, where Robinson was the original presenter.", "On 22 April 2011, Anne Robinson announced that she would end her role as the quiz show's presenter by the time her contract would expire as she had served longer than she had originally intended. The original run ended on 31 March 2012 with its 1,693rd, and final episode.", "Another variant of the daytime show was the 1,000th episode, complete with an audience, a departure from the normally spectator-free background. Fan-favourites played again for \u00a310,000, and some previous contestants also sat in the audience. The show's first winner, David Bloomfield was one of the returning contestants, and was asked the question: If there have been 1,000 episodes of The Weakest Link, each with 9 players, how many contestants in total have appeared on the show? He answered the question correctly (9,000) but banked prior to it being asked. He did not win any money on the 1,000th episode, and was voted off in only the 3rd round, despite having been the strongest link in the first two rounds. In the end, Miss Evans (who had previously appeared on the Strong Women special but had lost out to curate Emma Langley) defeated Basil Brush, winning \u00a32,710, which she split with her co-finalist to give to charity. Robinson then announced that a bonus of \u00a31,000 would be added to the final total, as it was the 1,000th episode, resulting in a final total of \u00a33,710, or both contestants receiving \u00a31,855 each. It also marked the first time that Anne Robinson did not say the phrase \"...you leave with nothing.\" to the losing contestant.", "A normal daytime edition of the show was made, with some of Anne's favourite contestants from over the years taking part, and with no audience present during filming or changes to the money tree (see above). The first round of questions was notably different and was mainly about Weakest Link and the host, Anne Robinson. The last question asked was \"If the Roman numeral 'X' is halved, the result can be represented by which other Roman numeral?\", the answer being \"V\". The last UK winner was Archie Bland, the editor of The Independent newspaper's Saturday edition, who won \u00a32,090.", "Much of the show's success has been attributed to its host, Anne Robinson. She was already famous in the UK for her sarcasm while presenting Points of View and the consumer programme Watchdog, and Weakest Link saw her develop this further, particularly in her taunting of contestants. Her sardonic summary to the team, usually berating them for their lack of intelligence for not achieving the target became a trademark of the show, and her call of \"You are the weakest link\u2014goodbye!\" became a popular catchphrase.", "Anne Robinson's catchphrase \"You are the weakest link. Goodbye!\" has made several appearances in pop culture, including references in Family Guy, Scary Movie 2, How I Met Your Mother, and The League of Gentlemen.", "Two fictional television shows, Doctor Who and My Family, have depicted their own versions of Weakest Link in their episodes. The Doctor Who edition, broadcast in 2005, showed a futuristic version of the show in the year 200,100, with only six contestants, and presented by an 'Anne Droid' (voiced by Anne Robinson). A later special edition of Weakest Link featured nine cast members of Doctor Who playing the game, and the show was introduced by the Anne Droid. The real Anne walked on stage almost instantly as the droid began the show, unplugged it, and said, \"I don't think so. I think we'll do that again.\" She then began the show herself and proceeded as normal.", "In the seventh series of the British television show My Family, broadcast in 2007, the main characters Ben, Susan, Janey, Michael, Abi, Roger, and Alfie, along with Susan's mother and her husband, went on the show for a special family edition, after Michael forged all of their signatures to get on it.

His closest predecessor was British TV critic Nina Myskow who, in the 1980s, became known for her harsh put-downs in New Faces, a talent show that Cowell cited as an influence. Cowell's prominence grew, fed by his signature phrase, \"I don't mean to be rude, but ...\", inevitably followed by an unsparingly blunt appraisal of the contestant's talents, personality, or even physical appearance. A lot of these one-liners were the product of coaching that Cowell received from publicist Max Clifford.
