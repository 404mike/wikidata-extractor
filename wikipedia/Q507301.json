Andrew Scott Waugh, his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and successor as surveyor general, had been responsible for putting his name forward in 1856. Everest's name was used as a compromise due to the difficulty of choosing between multiple local names for the mountain. He initially objected to the honour, as he had had nothing to do with its discovery and believed his name was not easily written or pronounced in Hindi.See report in 'The Illustrated London News', 15 August 1857", "In June 1830, Everest returned to India to continue his work on the GTS, and was simultaneously appointed Surveyor General of India. The arc from Cape Commorin to the northern border of British India was finally completed in 1841, under the supervision of Andrew Scott Waugh. To his dismay, much of his time was spent on administrative concerns, as well as combating criticism from home. The East India Company had provisionally appointed Thomas Jervis as Everest's successor, and Jervis subsequently delivered a series of lectures to the Royal Society on the perceived deficiencies of Everest's methods. In response, Everest penned a series of open letters to Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex, the society's president, in which he lambasted the society \"for meddling in matters of which they know little\". Jervis withdrew from consideration, and Everest successfully secured the appointment of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Waugh as his successor. He resigned in November 1842 and his commission was formally revoked in December 1843, at which point he returned to England.", "George Everest had no direct connection with the mountain that bears his name, which he never saw. He was, however, responsible for hiring Andrew Scott Waugh, who made the first formal observations of the mountain, and Radhanath Sikdar, who calculated its height. Before its significance was realised, Mount Everest was originally known as Peak \"B\" and later as Peak XV. In March 1856, Waugh wrote to the Royal Geographical Society to announce that the mountain was believed to be the highest in the world, and proposed that it be named \"after my illustrious predecessor\", as it was \"without any local name that we can discover\" \u2013 the \"native appellation, if it has any, will not very likely be ascertained before we are allowed to penetrate into Nepal\". There were in fact several native names among the Nepalese and Tibetans, but those areas were closed off to the British at the time and people living further to the south of the Himalayas did not have a specific name for the peak. In the decade after 1856, Waugh's proposal was widely debated by the Royal Geographical Society and similar bodies. Other scholars of India put forward native names that they believed to be correct, such as Brian Houghton Hodgson's \"Deva-dhunga\" and Hermann Schlagintweit's \"Gaurisankar\". Everest himself objected to his name being used, as \"the native of India\" could not pronounce it and it could not be easily written in Hindi. Nonetheless, in 1865 the society officially settled on \"Mount Everest\" as the name.The Naming of Mount Everest"]}, {"page": "Waugh", "response": ["* Andrew Scott Waugh (1810\u20131878), British Indian surveyor"]}, {"page": "Brompton Cemetery", "response": ["* Sir Andrew Scott Waugh \u2013 army officer and surveyor, who named the highest mountain in the world after Sir George Everest"]}, {"page": "Radhanath Sikdar", "response": ["George Everest retired in 1843 and was succeeded by Colonel Andrew Scott Waugh.

While in Burma, he surveyed the Irrawaddy Delta, and this work came to the favourable notice of Sir Andrew Scott Waugh, Surveyor General of India.

While in India, Pratt was approached by Andrew Scott Waugh, Surveyor General of India who had succeeded George Everest, to examine the gravitational anomaly caused by the Himalayas on the plumbline which resulted in errors in the Great Trigonometrical Survey. Pratt estimated the deviation of the plumbline that would be expected by the mass of the mountains (based on density estimated in 1772 at Mount Schiehallion in Scotland) but the observed deviations were much less. He propounded a theory that the density of the mountains was less than that of the underlying substrate. It was also noticed that the deviations of the plumbline were greater at the foot of the mountain and reduced as one moved away from the mountain. George Airy came up with the explanation that the roots of the mountain go deep into the earth. He compared it with a heap of logs in water and suggested that when a log juts higher above the water, a greater amount of it must be submerged. Pratt on the other hand suggested that there was a lower density under mountains below sea-level (actually refined later and termed the depth of compensation) and that this is offset by the mass above sea-level. Pratt's explanation assumes a variation in density whereas Airy assumes a constant crustal density. Pratt found fault with Airy's idea as it assumed a thinner crust (10 miles) than that estimated by William Hopkins (800 to 1000 miles) and also that the crust is lighter. Pratt said that the crust cools from the solid interior and should therefore be denser. Airy did not defend his view but Samuel Haughton used the debate to claim that mathematics was a useless tool for speculation. Pratt suggested that the crust would be depressed in the cooler parts of the world and suggested that the plumb deflection was caused by anomalous high density in the oceans south of the Himalayas. Pratt also applied his knowledge of physics and mathematics to a number of applications in India on which he was consulted by engineers. He examined arches, the physics involved in the sudden movement of a mass of water such as in the Indus floods of 1858 and in the bore of the Hooghly river, and computed the iron required for cantilever bridges."]}, {"page": "Great Trigonometrical Survey", "response": ["The Great Trigonometrical Survey was a project which aimed to survey the entire Indian subcontinent with scientific precision.
