However, as the Crimean winter fell over the Light Brigade's exposed position, food, fodder, clothing and shelter were all in short supply. Beyond writing letters pointing out the deficiencies, Cardigan did nothing. Food and fodder were available at the coast, but he refused to release any men and horses to carry up stores, as his officers pleaded, in case of a surprise attack by the enemy and because \"I had no orders to do so\".David (1997), p. 438. Colonel Alexander Tulloch, who gave evidence to a board of enquiry into the failure, noted that in fact Cardigan had more horses than he had needed: indeed more horses than men to ride them, and wrote privately after his evidence was excluded from the final report: \"Because Lord Cardigan might have had some difficulty in carrying up all the barley to which his corps was entitled he [resolved himself] therefore justified in bringing up none.\" There was great hardship and many horses died."]}, {"page": "John McNeill (diplomat)", "response": ["At the beginning of 1855, when the Crimean disasters had roused public indignation, McNeill and Colonel Alexander Tulloch, an officer of great administrative experience at the War Office, were sent to the Crimea with instructions to report on the whole arrangements and management of the commissariat and the method of keeping accounts, and to the causes of the delays in unloading and distributing clothing and other stores sent to Balaklava."]}, {"page": "Alexander Murray Tulloch", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alexander Tulloch"]}, {"page": "1838 Coronation Honours", "response": ["*Lieutenant-Colonel Alexander Tulloch, of the Madras Infantry"]}, {"page": "Tulloch, Alexander", "response": ["#redirectAlexander Tulloch"]}]}}
