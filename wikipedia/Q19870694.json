Thewlis, for example, was given work as a groundsman and provided with a pension.  In Pullin's entry into the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Lincoln Allison notes that the book reflected Pullin's close and sympathetic relationship with the players. Allison describes it as a pioneering work: the unhappy experiences of cricketers after retirement was a phenomenon not widely known at the time. E.W. Swanton, a press box colleague for the last few years of Pullin's career, writes: \"It was his revelations about the straits of poverty to which some of these heroes of the past were reduced that first roused the conscience of the public and the county committees, Yorkshire's not least.\" Derek Hodgson, in the official history of Yorkshire County Cricket Club, writes that Pullin \"produced one of the most valuable source books on Victorian cricket\"."]}]}}
