Because he was already thirty at the time, and had been an international-level runner for a decade, this victory was a long-awaited one for him.  He admitted that he decided to run the 5,000 metres instead of the 1,500 metres, because he lost to Ovett and Coe so often in the shorter distance.  The fairly slow pace of the 1982 European Athletics Championships 5,000-metre final favoured Wessinghage, because he was in top form - having set a European record at 2,000 metres shortly before the Championships - and because he was the fastest 1,500-metre runner in the final, having run that distance in 3 minutes 31.6 seconds in 1980.  Shortly after he started his final sprint with over 250 metres to go, Wessinghage moved into a decisive lead, stretching it into five metres by 4,800 metres and almost doubling it by 4,900 metres (see, for example, \"The Thousand Stars of Athletics\" / Yleisurheilun tuhat t\u00e4hte\u00e4, written by Matti Hannus and published in Finland in 1983;  Pat Butcher, The Perfect Distance:  Ovett&Coe:  The Record-Breaking Rivalry, London:  Weidenfeld&Nicolson, 2004;  \"The Major Events of Top Sports Until 1982\" / Huippu-urheilun suuret tapahtumat vuoteen 1982 asti, published in Finland in 1982;  \"The Great European Championships Book\" / Suuri EM-kirja, published in Finland in 1990;  see tommytempo1's video about the race's last two laps on YouTube with the search words \"Thomas Wessinghage\")."]}, {"page": "Omer Khalifa", "response": ["Khalifa studied at Loughborough University during the same time when Sebastian Coe and David Moorcroft studied.Alumni-List Los Angeles 1984 During his career in competitive running he was 1.77 meters tall and weighed 64 kilograms."]}, {"page": "Coventry Godiva Harriers", "response": ["| David Moorcroft"]}]}}
