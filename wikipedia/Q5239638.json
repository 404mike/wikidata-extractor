The institute later came to be known as the Central Research Institute (CRI).\nSemple was born in Derry, the son of William Semple of Castlederg, County Tyrone. He was educated at Foyle College and earned his MD and MCh degrees at Queen's University Belfast, followed by his Public Health degree from Cambridge in 1892.In 1911, he developed a nerve-tissue based rabies vaccine from the brains of sheep first made rabid and then killed. The 'Semple' vaccine however is known to have side-effects such as paralysis with high risk of other diseases, being just a crude form of churned brain-tissue. It needs administration around the stomach in a series of very painful injections administered over a period of seven to 14 days, a course that many do not complete. Moreover, it is not reliable and the World Health Organization (WHO) has been advocating its total disuse since 1993. (WHO literature )\nHe was given a knighthood in 1911, and is buried in City of Westminster Cemetery, Hanwell.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sir David Semple", "response": ["#REDIRECT David Semple"]}, {"page": "Kaisar-i-Hind Medal", "response": ["* Lieutenant-Colonel Sir David Semple, for distinguished service in the advancement of the interests of the British Raj"]}, {"page": "Semple", "response": ["* David Semple (1856\u20131937), bacteriologist"]}, {"page": "City of Westminster Cemetery, Hanwell", "response": ["*Col.
