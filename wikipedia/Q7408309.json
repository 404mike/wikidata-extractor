At different times during the decade the club had on its books such players as Tommy Law, Sam Weaver, Sid Bishop, Harry Burgess, Dick Spence and Joe Bambrick, all established internationals, yet their highest league finish in the decade was eighth. Ironically, two of the club's most reliable players during the decade cost them nothing: goalkeeper Vic Woodley, who was to win 19 consecutive caps for England, and centre-forward George Mills, the first player to score 100 league goals for Chelsea. They avoided relegation by two points in 1932\u201333 and 1933\u201334, and by one point in 1938\u201339. Another promising cup run in 1939, which included wins over Arsenal and Sheffield Wednesday, petered out with a home loss to Grimsby Town in the quarter-finals."]}, {"page": "1932 FA Cup Final", "response": ["| ||6 || Sam Weaver"]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Sam Weaver (1939) 2 matches CA"]}, {"page": "List of English cricket and football players", "response": ["| Sam Weaver"]}, {"page": "List of Newcastle United F.C. seasons", "response": ["|Sam Weaver"]}]}}
