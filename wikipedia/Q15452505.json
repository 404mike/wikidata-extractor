Although his studies were interrupted for almost two years due to a prolonged illness, he nevertheless ranked second in Cambridge's famous mathematical examination, the tripos, for which he sat in 1837. However, Sylvester was not issued a degree, because graduates at that time were required to state their acceptance of the Thirty-nine Articles of the Church of England, and Sylvester could not do so because he was Jewish. For the same reason, he was unable to compete for a Fellowship or obtain a Smith's prize. In 1838, Sylvester became professor of natural philosophy at University College London and in 1839 a Fellow of the Royal Society of London. In 1841, he was awarded a BA and an MA by the University of Dublin (Trinity College). In the same year he moved to the United States to become a professor of mathematics at the University of Virginia, but left after less than four months. A student who had been reading a newspaper in one of Sylvester's lectures insulted him and Sylvester struck him with a sword stick. The student collapsed in shock and Sylvester believed (wrongly) that he had killed him. Sylvester resigned when he felt that the university authorities had not sufficiently disciplined the student.Biography of Sylvester, MacTutor, University of St. Andrews, accessed 6 October 2021 He moved to New York City and began friendships with the Harvard mathematician Benjamin Peirce (father of Charles Sanders Peirce) and the Princeton physicist Joseph Henry. However, he left in November 1843 after being denied appointment as Professor of Mathematics at Columbia College (now University), again for his Judaism, and returned to England."]}, {"page": "Hymers College", "response": ["The school was founded following the death in 1887 of the Revd Dr John Hymers, Rector of Brandesburton, who left a substantial sum in his will for the founding of a school \"for the training of intelligence in whatever social rank of life it may be found among the vast and varied population of the town and port of Hull\".

The school quickly established itself, and the first headmaster, Charles Gore, was soon admitted into the HMC, with all subsequent headmasters also being members. Hymers was a fee-paying school for most of its history, and many scholarships and bursaries were given to pupils whose parents' could not afford the fees, in accordance with John Hymers' will for the training of intelligence, regardless of social rank. In 1946 Hymers became a \"direct grant\" school, with many pupils being paid for by the local authority, in a similar system to today's academies. However, this scheme ended in 1971, and the school governors chose to become a fully independent school, rather than joining into the new comprehensive system, and re-established the bursaries system after the Government-funded Assisted Places scheme ended in 1997."]}, {"page": "Sedbergh School", "response": ["*John Hymers, English mathematician, Fellow of the Royal Society and founder of Hymers College"]}, {"page": "Brandesburton", "response": ["St Mary's Church, which is surrounded by its churchyard in the north-east corner of the village, is a large, medieval building, with tower, nave, aisles and chancel.

Exhibiting some fragments of Norman work (including a priest's door), it principally dates from the 13th to the 15th centuries, and was restored in 1892. Inside are two noteworthy brasses: on the south side of the chancel the fragments of a (rare) bracket-brass, and on the north side more substantial, full-size brasses to John St Quintin, a former Lord of the Manor, and his wife.

While it was important for geodesy, from a Cambridge point of view its introduction to the syllabus of the Tripos, as intended by William Whewell, proved troublesome. Whewell had George Biddell Airy write on it in his 1826 Tracts, but the solution of the equation appeared unmotivated. John Henry Pratt in Mathematical Principles of Mechanical Philosophy (1836) returned to the topic, clarifying it. Alexander John Ellis worked on the solution of the equation in 1836, as an undergraduate. Then in 1839 Gaskin produced a solution procedure by a differential operator method, setting the result of his investigation as a Tripos question. It immediately gained textbook status in the Differential Equations of John Hymers. The work proved seminal, influencing Robert Leslie Ellis to further developments of symbolic methods; and is credited with a stimulus to the On A General Method of Analysis (1844), the paper making the reputation of George Boole.James Gasser (editor), A Boole Anthology: Recent and classical studies in the logic of George Boole (2000), pp. 168-73; Google Books."]}, {"page": "Hymers, John", "response": ["#redirectJohn Hymers"]}]}}
