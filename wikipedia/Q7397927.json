In 2012, he directed the short film, The Man, as part of Sky Arts' Playhouse Presents strand.

In 2015, the BBC broadcast a two-part adaptation of author Sadie Jones' novel The Outcast which Softley also directed. The film was warmly received by The Guardian, with Julia Raeside writing: \"The tone set by Iain Softley's beautifully restrained direction and the careful use of music creates a real feeling of loss from the start, just as in the book, but he somehow avoids all hammy visual foreshadowing and narrative signposting, so often used to gee a plot along\"."]}, {"page": "Greg Wise", "response": ["In February 2015, Greg Wise made his theatrical return starring in Brad Fraser's Kill Me Now at Park Theatre in Finsbury Park, London.

The novel, one of my favourites, bursts with a fragile intensity that, while filmic, seemed unlikely to survive the transition\". However, she found Finn Elliot's portrayal of the younger Lewis to be \"thoroughly convincing\", describing him as an \"astonishing young talent\".

No need for prodding and over-talking.

Is evil caused by psychological damage, or is it inherent?\" and concludes \"An assuredly chilling ghost story, Dolly doesn't leave its questions unanswered. Damage is assumed, noted, but not forgiven, and as the story develops evil is passed through the generations like a stain \u2013 in dark places, dank graves, dolls, and ultimately even human flesh.\"Dolly by Susan Hill \u2013 review | Books | The Guardian Retrieved 2019-05-01."]}, {"page": "Theatre-fiction", "response": ["* Sadie Jones, Fallout (2014)"]}]}}
