The act for which he is best remembered was \"Over the Garden Wall\", in which he played Fanny Fairbottom, a toothless hatchet-faced Lancastrian housewife gossiping over a garden wall, The routine was the inspiration for Les Dawson and Roy Barraclough's later Cissie and Ada characters. The one-sided conversations would embrace local gossip, including scandal about the neighbours and personal medical complaints, including silently mouthing words deemed too rude to be spoken out loud, and accompanied with a range of facial contortions and glances round for supposed eavesdroppers. Another famous stage sketch was \"The Dentist\" in which Evans played both patient and dentist, and in which he employed a large screen.\nHis first appearance on the London stage was alongside a young Betty Driver. Evans was the only pantomime dame to receive top billing at the London Palladium.\nIn May 1955, he lost his right eye in a serious car accident while driving near Preston. The accident was caused after he swerved trying to avoid a black cat.His final summer season was at Butlin's Holiday Camp, Pwllheli in 1962. He wrote to Clarkson Rose (another top pantomime dame) \"Working in a Butlin theatre is a terrific experience, and although I've not been too well, I've never been happier in my life\".\nNorman Evans is buried in Carleton Cemetery, Blackpool. The headstone of his grave is a low wall built from natural gritstone blocks. His epitaph (preceding birth and death dates) reads \"Norman's last garden wall!\"", "link_mentions": {}}}
