God, identified as the Holy One of Israel, is a being with a glorified body, in appearance much like a man. There can never be a spirit without a body. A purely spiritual deity, lacking any locus, would be an absurdity (so Muggletonians vehemently told the Quakers) incapable of action in a material world. The man Christ Jesus was not sent from God but was the very God appearing on this earth. Speculation about a divine nature and a human nature, or about the Trinity, is not in error so much as unnecessary. At worst, John Reeve said, it encourages people to ascribe to the deity a whole ragbag of inconsistent human attributes expressed as superlatives. Or, as Thomas Tomkinson drily remarked, it tends to give you a father of justice just when you most wanted a son of mercy.", "John Reeve reports that only he was told of his Commission by the word of God.

Yet his soul was still troubled \"for fear God had made me a reprobate before I was born, because He did not answer my prayers.\"", "By April 1651 Muggleton had begun to feel that he lacked the power to reason his way out of his perplexities about resurrection and hellfire. He concluded that he must leave it all to God: \"even as the potter doth what he will with the dead clay.\" He began to experience revelations concerning the meaning of scripture.

Underwood Acts of the Witnesses p. 10 that, on the death of John Reeve, there was a power-struggle between Lodowicke Muggleton and Laurence Clarkson (or Claxton) for leadership. However, it is unclear if Muggleton saw there as being a \"movement\" of which to be leader. William Lamont remarks that it is strange that he took three years to bestir himself in his own cause. The issue may be more a misunderstanding on Clarkson's part. In temperament and talent, he seemed much more the natural successor to Reeve than Muggleton was \u2013 or cared to be. But he wasn't a commissioned prophet. Muggleton seems only slowly to have grasped that if he wanted to be taken seriously as an individual prophet, he had to write, to publish and to show himself outside his immediate neighbourhood.Muggleton's repeated assertions in his autobiography that he wished only to be \"quiet and still\" and hated anything \"public\" should perhaps be taken at face value more than they usually are.", "Edward Bourne asks Muggleton if the two seeds theology does not make God the harbinger of evil in the world? He does not receive a straight answer although Muggleton says that faith in a time of innocence is one thing, but that faith through knowledge of good and evil is a higher state of consciousness altogether.  Thus, evil is a sort of necessary evil.Theodicy and the problem of the existence of evil in the face of a deity that is both merciful and omnipotent is perhaps the weakest aspect of the Muggletonian doctrine. John Reeve's only explanation in A Divine Looking-Glass is that evil lurked in the earth and water from which God made the world, which seems a lack of any explanation. Perhaps it is a pity the two prophets nowhere consider the notion that evil is the misapplication of things intended for good.", "Samuel Hooten enquires if Muggleton should not pay heed to the instruction Christ gave to his disciples, \"Bless and curse not\"? But Muggleton dismisses this instruction as a temporary expedient for the disciples' use only. In Acts, St. Peter receives a quite different instruction and Peter, like Lodowicke, has a commission. In a similar vein, Muggleton is reminded there is nothing in scripture foretelling the coming of one Lodowicke Muggleton, to which the reply is, \"For, if there had been such a name written in scripture, many men would have named their sons Lodowicke Muggleton.\" Richard Farnesworth also taxes Muggleton about the failure of John Reeve and himself to live out their part from the book of Revelation. Muggleton says that prophets come to impose their commission which lives on after them no matter what happens to the prophet himself. Thus, Moses commission was to bring the law and that did not end with the death of Moses but with the death of John the Baptist.Lodowicke Muggleton Neck of the Quakers broken p. 81", "At first sight, it might seem surprising that Muggleton is impressed by John the Divine's visions. After all, the proof that John Reeve's calling had been authentic was supposed to have been because it was by voice of God, \"as a man speaks to his friend\" and not by visions which might be self-deceiving. In Jewish practice of John's time, visions came through meditation upon a message and a favourite vehicle was the first chapter of the Book of Ezekiel which is a centre-piece of Revelation.John Sweet Revelation p. 42 John Sweet explains how the idea is handled in Revelation. When John is spoken to, it is to explain the meaning of what he has seen; just as Mary Magdalene had seen Jesus in the garden but did not recognise him until she heard his voice.John Sweet Revelation p. 125 quoting Gospel according to John 20:14 When John the Divine witnesses the Lamb he sees weakness and defeat but the voice explains it all as power and victory.

Specifically, it is part of the 'Third and Last Testament of Our Lord Jesus Christ'. The first two testaments are the Mosaic law and the gospels of Christ's apostles.Roughly, the Muggletonian canon comprises the Old and New Testaments less those books attributed to Solomon, plus Ethiopic Enoch Book of Enoch and the Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs.

He received his commission from God \"to the hearing of the ear as a man speaks to his friend\" (23.22) in February 1651. There were no visions or ecstasies. This commission identifies Reeve and his cousin, Lodowicke Muggleton, as the Two Witnesses referred to in the Book of Revelation at chapter 11 verse 3. The context means that both men saw themselves as given a power from God to expound scripture, God now decreeing the world to be ready to learn more of the divine secrets as the end of time draws near. This contrasts with a more usual prophetic tendency of the 1650s to identify the prophet as messenger, with the 'angel with a book' in chapter 10 of Revelation.Norman Cohn \"The Pursuit of the Millennium\" London:Granada Publishing, 3rd edition 1970 p. 316 - 330 (earlier editions do not have this section) cites Abiezer Coppe (1619-72) \"A fiery flying roll\" (1649) and also Laurence Clarkson who subsequently converted to Muggletonianism.", "John Reeve writes at a time when an interpretive understanding of the world as an order of Ideas and archetypes was giving way to something more analytical.see the essay \"Aims of a new epoch\" in Charles Taylor \"Hegel\" Cambridge: Cambridge University Press (1975) Reeve has a foot in both old and new.

Smith (1823) p. 258 but in 1661 he read a book by Laurence Clarkson (presumably The Lost Sheep Found) and became attracted to Muggletonianism. Earlier, in February 1652, he had had a revelatory experience similar to the one Lodowicke Muggleton reported in 1650 but without any experience of the direct voice of God which had come to John Reeve and which was the foundation experience of Muggletonianism. Since John Reeve died in 1658, these dates mean that Tomkinson was one of the first prominent Muggletonian personalities not to have known Reeve personally.", "Tomkinson's conversion experience had been a difficult one. \"What a great deal of pain to please the unsatisfied fancy of one particular man,\" Muggleton had grumbled.Lamont \"Last Witnesses\" p. 21 Tomkinson had been attracted to Muggletonianism by the radical humanity of their God. Every Muggletonian agreed God was the man Christ Jesus; necessarily and sufficiently. One of Tomkinson's subsequent books was called \"None but Christ\". But it mattered intensely to him that Christ had not known of his divinity whilst on this earth, else his humanity was inauthentic. John Reeve had inclined to think Christ had awareness, at least at some stage. But, \"Mr Clarkson in his Wonder of Wonders said he did not know himself to be the only God.\"Lamont \"Last Witnesses p. 64 referring to Laurence Clarkson Muggleton affected sagely indifference. For Tomkinson, Christ had lived, died and lain in a grave for three days entirely as a man. By what power, then, did this man ascend to heaven? There has to be an answer else the crucifixion is the final death of God: indeed, God's suicide. The standard Muggletonian reply is that during Christ's sojourn on earth, the affairs of heaven were managed by Elijah (perhaps in partnership with Moses and Enoch). Elijah had temporary control of God's prerogative power, easily adequate to a resurrection and glorious return. Such a view seems to fit nicely with the transfiguration story. It also explains the crowd at the crucifixion crying out, \"Behold, he calleth Elias.\"Gospel of St Mark 15:35) But the monotheism of the whole enterprise is dangerously compromised. On one hand, there is a God in the form of the man Christ Jesus. On the other hand, there is a man Elijah, directly translated to heaven without death, capable of exercising God's full prerogative power. Where remains the dividing line between creator and created?John Saddington, an earlier writer, prefers to emphasize a different argument; namely that although the body and soul of the man Jesus were both authentically dead there remained the divine quickening power to restore vitality. Does this come dangerously close to 'spirits without a body'? Perhaps neither explanation is wholly satisfactory.", "Tomkinson's most original contribution to Muggletonian belief was to adapt the theory of 'the seed of the serpent and the seed of the woman', which John Reeve had expounded in A Divine Looking-Glass, to produce a doctrine of predestination that avoided the perceived pessimism of Calvin's model. Muggletonians felt Calvin portrayed God as a kind of capricious tyrant because Calvinism allowed only for 'one seed' which rendered the whole of humanity abject. Tomkinson also toned down Muggleton's implacable hostility to reason, accepting that reason had its uses in everyday life but was no substitute for faith. The term 'sober reason' was coined to imply reason subordinated to faith.", "Tomkinson's most lasting contribution may have been to stress that there was no dividing line between the ideas of Lodowicke Muggleton and those of John Reeve. This topic was a source of splits and dissent amongst Muggletonians, some believing that Muggleton, alone, had insisted that God took no immediate notice of everyday human activities.", "Dr Williams has most success with the Book of Revelation. He wants to know why John Reeve says one reprobate angel fell when scripture says many such angels fell. This matters: it is central to Muggletonianism that one angel was cast from heaven to earth to impregnate Eve (and to perish in the process) thus causing Cain to be the first offspring of the 'seed of the serpent' and for the perpetuation of evil to take place on our earth. However, Revelation 12:9 says, \"that old serpent called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him\". Tomkinson simply denies any 'rebellion in heaven' as described in Revelation 12:7Thomas Tomkinson \"Muggletonian Principles Prevailing\" Deal: James May (1822) p. 40 Such angels, he says, are merely Cain's offspring on this earth. But Tomkinson cannot summon the insouciance one might have expected Muggleton to have wielded at this point.

Reeve and Muggleton were believed to be the Two Last Witnesses mentioned in the Book of Revelation 11:3 but only Reeve had received his commission from the voice of God. So it was always arguable whether there were two equal prophets or only one fully commissioned prophet, John Reeve. The nine assertions might be thought to boil down to only one (that's certainly the way Muggleton looked at it) which concerned Muggleton's insistence that God takes no notice of everyday goings-on in this world. This idea is not found explicitly in any of John Reeve's writings. In fact, everything John Reeve said pointed in the opposite direction. \"Nothing comes by chance or fortune, but all through or by the providential choice of the most high.\"William Lamont The Last Witnesses Aldershot: Ashgate Publishing (2006) p. 131 Muggleton was quite candid about the situation. He said that although John Reeve was generally infallible in matters of doctrine, he was only human and could sometimes get things confused. This was one of those things and John Reeve had accepted Muggleton's correction. But we only have Muggleton's word for that.", "The idea about immediate notice (or the lack of it) was not originally Muggleton's. It was first written about by Laurence Clarkson. It perhaps strengthened Muggleton's hand that someone who might have been expected to follow John Reeve was so emphatically in-line with Muggleton on the issue. And it is why John Saddington started to write books.", "The work is written in the style of a personal credo with each of 48 articles beginning \"I do believe that ... \" The dedication to the work says it is written to confound and disprove all despisers that say, firstly, \"We do not know what we believe\" and secondly, that the Muggletonians \"do own neither God nor devil.\" The first charge, that of lacking internal consistency, was a commonplace of sectarian disputes. Quakers taunted Muggletonians with it and Lodowicke Muggleton threw it back at any \"ignorant spatter-brained Quaker\" who crossed pens with him.Lodowicke Muggleton An answer to William Penn (1673) reprinted Clerkenwell: E. Brown (1835) The hugely abusive style of the exchange of pamphlets seems to derive entirely from a personal trait of Lodowicke Muggleton, not emulated by his followers. It is fair to say that Quakers such as Isaac Pennington, William Penn and George Fox, paid him back as good as he gave. John Reeve's correspondence with Isaac Pennington is far more measured and persuasive and, from a Muggletonian perspective, the last word had already been written long before in Laurence Clarkson's definitive The Quakers Downfall (1659).", "But was Saddington's contribution really helpful? It is only his personal statement of belief. To the extent that these beliefs are co-extensive with the six principles of Muggletonian belief, then they are redundant. To the extent they go beyond them, they are controversial and any believer is free to accept or reject as he or she pleases. This issue becomes important in his other, much more substantial, published work, A Prospective-glass for Saints and Sinners where he enlarges upon the status of John Reeve and Lodowicke Muggleton.", "The choice of content for the book is partially influenced by events that were recent to its time of writing, notably the rebellion led by William Medgate over whether God took any notice of everyday affairs on earth. Those who championed a positive response tended to privilege John Reeve and to allege that it was Lodowicke Muggleton who was introducing new and erroneous ideas of his own fancy. They drew attention to the consequences of the dispute, especially that if God took no notice there was no court of appeal against Muggleton's supreme authority. The prophet was all-powerful and he was misusing his powers in antinomian ways. They criticised the idea that the prophet's favour could uphold a man even though he sins.William Medgate's assertions are set out in T. L.

According to Saddington, Jesus died so that the sins of the elect should not permanently count against them. (p.\u00a059) The believer's inner peace, although disturbed by sin and possibly rocked to the core by its misery, is never destroyed by it. What is present in Saddington's work, and which passed John Reeve by, is that the Jesus who shared our human predicament did so as redeemer.
