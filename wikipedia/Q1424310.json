However, the effects team had some difficulties. Most of the conception process involved members coming up with various concepts but never agreeing to final designs, meaning compromises had to be determined under deadlines during filming; Astles suggested more time could've been saved if the crew simply borrowed from Dungeons & Dragons books instead of trying to \"cleverly expand\" the game's universe."]}, {"page": "Broken Sword", "response": ["Revolution first discussed the idea of a third Broken Sword in 2000.

Todd suggested the character to wear an eyepatch, but Keen rejected the idea.
