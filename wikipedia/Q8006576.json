He held seats in three parliaments: the South Australian Legislative Assembly, the Australian House of Representatives and the Western Australian Legislative Assembly.\nCarpenter was born in Stratton, Wiltshire, England in 1863. He was educated at Swindon, and it was there that he took an apprenticeship as a boilermaker on the Great Western Railway.  In 1886, he emigrated to Victoria, Australia, where he found work in locomotive construction at the Phoenix Foundry in Ballarat. On 3 April 1889, he married Alice Catherine Ross.\nIn 1891, Carpenter moved to Gawler, South Australia, where he spent the next five years as foreman of Jas Martin & Co. During this time he developed an interest in public affairs, becoming active in the Barossa Reform League, which agitated for land reform. In 1896, he was elected to the South Australian House of Assembly seat of Encounter Bay.  Two years later he was Chairman of the Royal Commission on Old Age Pensions.  He held the seat of Encounter Bay until the election of 1902, at which he unsuccessfully contested the seat of Alexandra.\nCarpenter moved to Fremantle, Western Australia in 1903. He became a member of the Fremantle Trades Hall Association, and president of the Transcontinental Railway League.  In December 1903, he was elected to the Australian House of Representatives seat of Fremantle as a Labor candidate. He would hold the seat until his defeat in the election of December 1906. After his defeat he moved into a secretarial and agency business, and was also a journalist, working as editor of the briefly-reestablished Fremantle Herald.After losing his federal seat, Carpenter turned to state politics, standing unsuccessfully for the Western Australian Legislative Council seat of West Province in May 1908.  He stood once again for the federal seat of Fremantle in the election of April 1910, but was again unsuccessful.  In October 1911, however, he won the Western Australian Legislative Assembly seat of Fremantle. In 1917 he joined John Scaddan in leaving the anti-conscription Labor party for the pro-conscription National Labor movement. He contested the election of September 1917 under this banner, and was defeated by the new Labor candidate. He then left politics, going to Melbourne and then Sydney. On 11 September 1930, his dead body was found floating in the Hacking River at Sutherland, New South Wales. He was buried at Rookwood Cemetery.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sutherland, New South Wales", "response": ["* William Carpenter, Australian politician."]}, {"page": "King O'Malley", "response": ["In January 1896, the Register reported that O'Malley would be a candidate for the seat of Encounter Bay at the upcoming general election. Encounter Bay was a rural seat electing two MPs to the House of Assembly. Although not a resident of the electorate, O'Malley was \"apparently a frequent visitor to the area [...] popular with various people in Goolwa and Victor Harbor\". He stood as an independent, surprising observers by topping the poll ahead of William Carpenter of the United Labor Party (ULP), sitting MP Henry Downer of the Australasian National League, and former MP Charles Hussey. He enjoyed strong support among the newly enfranchised female voters, who were sympathetic to his pro-temperance views.", "O'Malley was defeated for re-election in Encounter Bay at the April 1899 general election, with William Carpenter outpolling him by 14 votes and Charles Tucker outpolling both. The election was fought largely on the temperance issue, with Tucker enjoying the support of the Licensed Victuallers' Association. Their supporters clashed on a number of occasions, culminating in a \"near riot\" at Goolwa the day after the election. A petition was subsequently lodged against Tucker's return, on the grounds that he had attempted to bribe electors. The result was declared void in July 1899 and another election ordered, which was equally acrimonious but resulted in a clear victory for Tucker against O'Malley."]}, {"page": "Division of Fremantle", "response": ["| William Carpenter"]}, {"page": "1930 in Australia", "response": ["* 11 September \u2013 William Carpenter, Western Australian politician (b. 1863)"]}, {"page": "Electoral district of Fremantle", "response": ["|rowspan=\"2\"| William Carpenter"]}, {"page": "William Henry Carpenter", "response": ["*William Carpenter (Australian politician) (1863\u20131930), Australian politician", "*William Carpenter (disambiguation) "]}, {"page": "William Carpenter", "response": ["William Carpenter may refer to:", "*William Carpenter (1797\u20131874), theological and political writer, journalist, and editor", "*William Carpenter (Australian politician) (1863\u20131930), Australian politician", "*William Carpenter (flat Earth theorist) (1830\u20131896), advocate of the Flat Earth theory", "*William Carpenter (painter) (1818\u20131899), watercolours of India", "*William Carpenter (Rhode Island colonist) (c. 1610\u20131685), co-founder of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations", "*William Carpenter (writer) (born 1940), American author", "*William Carpenter of Rehoboth (born 1605), co-founder of Rehoboth, Massachusetts, see Rehoboth Carpenter family"]}, {"page": "1903 Australian federal election", "response": ["| William Carpenter", "| align=\"left\" bgcolor=\"FFBBBB\" |William Carpenter"]}, {"page": "1906 Australian federal election", "response": ["| William Carpenter"]}, {"page": "Fremantle Herald", "response": ["In 1913 a new workers' weekly was established, with William Carpenter serving as editor.
