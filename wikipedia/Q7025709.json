The latter aimed at setting up a first-rate ensemble for opera and concert performances and, though no admirer of broadcasting, he was willing to negotiate with the BBC if this gave him what he sought. Reith's concern was that the BBC should have a first-rate radio orchestra. The critic Richard Morrison writes: Reith's BBC of the 1920s was ... imbued with an almost religious zeal for \"enlightening\" the public through the magical medium of the wireless. An orchestra, and particularly one that was unencumbered by commercial constraints and thus free to deliver the highest of highbrow programmes, would fit very well into that idealistic philosophy.Morrison, p. 72 Landon Ronald brought Reith and Beecham together in April 1928; negotiations and preliminary arrangements continued for more than 18 months until it became clear that the corporation and the conductor had irreconcilable priorities for the proposed new ensemble.

Elgar, who was well regarded by the royal family, pressed the case for retaining the post. According to the music writer Nicholas Kenyon, he also \"lobbied shamelessly\" for his own candidacy for it. Other names, including that of Ralph Vaughan Williams had been suggested, but George V and his advisers took the view that \"if the post is to go to the most eminent musician it would hardly be possible to go beyond Elgar.\" Elgar's appointment was announced in May 1924; The Times commented, \"it is entirely fitting that in the changed condition of the office he should be made Master of the King's Musick and the Musician Laureate of the British people.\"\"Master of the King's Musick\", The Times, 5 May 1924, p. 16 Elgar was not required to write any official music in his new capacity, but in 1931 he dedicated his Nursery Suite to the Duchess of York and her two daughters. He used his influence as Master to track down the original instruments of Edward VII's band, to ensure the royal music library was well ordered, and to secure recognition for other musicians, including a knighthood for Granville Bantock and the Companion of Honour for Delius.

Kenyon, similar to Singer a decade earlier, believed that Radio 3 had to make changes to its presentation before the new station began broadcasting rather than react later. As a result, three senior producers were sent to study classical music stations in the United States and the station hired advertising agents Saatchi & Saatchi to help improve public perception. Kenyon's tenure was to meet with much controversy: in attempts to update the station's presentation, popular announcers Malcolm Ruthven, Peter Barker and Tony Scotland were axed as well as drama being cut by a quarter, resulting in a letter of protest to The Times signed by Harold Pinter, Tom Stoppard and Fay Weldon among others; two new programmes for drive time, entitled On Air and In Tune, were launched and a new three-hour programme of popular classics on Sunday mornings fronted by Brian Kay was also launched.", "* 19921998 Nicholas Kenyon", "Controller Nicholas Kenyon summed up the perennial problem of Radio 3 as \"the tension between highbrow culture and popular appeal \u2026the cost of what we do and the number of people who make use of it\": elitism versus populism (or 'dumbing down') and the question of cost per listener.
