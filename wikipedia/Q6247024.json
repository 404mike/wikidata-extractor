The first cohort of students left school in 1938, and during the Second World War, about 65 Doon students served in the Army, Navy or Air Force. In 1948, Foot returned to England for \"family reasons\", and John Martyn became the second headmaster.  After the Indian Independence, Martyn's friends suggested it would be a mistake to stay on in India, but he later wrote: \"They could not have been more wrong. I have found my life much pleasanter than before...although no one had previously ever done or said anything to make me feel at all unwelcome, from now on it was often made quite explicit that I was very welcome.\" While Foot and Martyn were determined to model Doon on Eton and Harrow, they both agreed that Doon should cater primarily for Indian boys\u2014and not the sons of British expatriates\u2014in order to create a uniquely Indian public school rather than a transplanted British institution. Foot did not want Doon to be considered elitist. In a paper surveying the new school, presented to the Royal Society of Arts, London in 1947, Foot wrote: \"In language we have never intended to base our instruction on the Classics in the way that Latin is still the centre pin of the English Public School. The great majority of boys take Urdu or Hindi.\" Martyn retired as headmaster in 1966 and became a managing trustee of Indian Cheshire Homes.", "* In Tenzing Norgay's autobiography Man of Everest, he refers to Bandarpunch as \"The Doon School mountain\" as the mountain was frequented by two Doon School teachers, Jack Gibson and John Martyn."]}, {"page": "John Martyn (disambiguation)", "response": ["John Martyn (1948\u20132009) was a British singer-songwriter.", "John Martyn may also refer to:", "*John Martyn (schoolmaster) (1903\u20131984), second Headmaster of The Doon School, India", "*John Martyn (academic) (died 1473), Master of University College, Oxford, England", "*John Martyn (botanist) (1699\u20131768), British botanist and author of Historia plantarum rariorum", "*John Martyn (publisher) (died 1680), London publisher and bookseller", "*John Martyn (MP for Wycombe), for Wycombe", "*John Martyn (died 1627), MP for Nottingham", "*John Martyn (MP for Scarborough), MP for  Scarborough", "*John Martyn (priest) Dean of Bangor from 1371 to 1382", "*John Martyn (Leicester MP), represented Leicester (UK Parliament constituency)"]}, {"page": "Gurdial Singh (mountaineer)", "response": ["Gurdial Singh joined The Doon School in 1945 and it was here that he was influenced by Englishmen such as John Martyn, R.L.
