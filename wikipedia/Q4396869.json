He had several roles within the club from the 1890s to the 1940s, most notably putting them in contact with Matt Busby in 1945; Busby would go on to manage the club for 25 years.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Matt Busby", "response": ["After Manchester United had tried to sign Busby from Manchester City in 1930, he became good friends with United's fixer, Louis Rocca; their relationship was helped by the fact that both were members of the Manchester Catholic Sportsman's Club. United were in desperate need of a manager to take over from club secretary Walter Crickmer after the war and a board meeting was called in December 1944 so as to ascertain who that new manager might be. Knowing that Liverpool had already offered Busby a job, Rocca convinced the United board to \"leave it to [him]\" and immediately wrote a letter to Busby, addressed to his army regiment. The letter was vague, referring only to \"a job\", just in case it fell into the wrong hands, namely the Liverpool officials."]}, {"page": "History of Manchester United F.C. (1878\u20131945)", "response": ["A new manager, Herbert Bamlett was installed, but the club never finished higher than 12th in 1929 and finally finishing bottom of the First Division in 1931 after starting the season losing twelve times in a row. The finances were once again in a mess, and the much criticised Herbert Bamlett resigned. Secretary Walter Crickmer was given control of the team for the next season, and was aided by chief scout Louis Rocca, largely because the club couldn't afford a new manager. The players had gone to collect their wages just before Christmas and were told there was no money available. Another financial bailout was needed. They managed to finish mid table in the Second Division in 1931\u201332, despite losing 7\u20130 at Wolverhampton Wanderers on Boxing Day 1931, but with the club's finances precarious it seemed possible that the club could go out of business."]}, {"page": "Tom Manley (footballer)", "response": ["Manley was brought to First Division club Manchester United by scout Louis Rocca on an amateur basis in September 1930. At the end of the 1930\u201331 season, after the club's relegation to the Second Division, he signed a professional contract. Manley broke into the team over the course of the 1932\u201333 and 1933\u201334 seasons and scored 15 goals in United's 1935\u201336 Second Division title-winning campaign. After suffering relegation straight back to the Second Division at the end of the 1936\u201337 season, he helped the team to an immediate return to the top-flight one season later. 1938\u201339 was Manley's final season at Old Trafford and he finished his Manchester United career having made 195 appearances and scored 41 goals. Predominantly an outside left, he also performed the role of a utility player at Old Trafford by also playing in half and full back positions."]}, {"page": "Joe Armstrong (football scout)", "response": ["Joe Armstrong (1894\u20131975) succeeded Louis Rocca as chief scout of Manchester United after World War II. At United, Armstrong worked very closely alongside reserve team manager and follow scout, Jimmy Murphy, and the youth players that made their debut from the early 1950s onwards are a tribute to their scouting skills.

Just three months later, he was transferred to Manchester United. Having heard that Stockport were holding a bazaar to ease their financial difficulties, United's assistant manager Louis Rocca, whose family ran a successful ice cream business in the Newton Heath district of the city, donated a freezer full of ice cream to the event in exchange for Stockport releasing McLenahan from his contract."]}]}}
