She emigrated to the U.S. in 1885, following her parents who were settling in Salina, Kansas for the second time. Her father worked as a gardener and her mother ran a small family farm. Abel  attended Salina High School, graduating in 1893. She immediately began teaching in the Kansas public schools. In 1895, Abel began studies at the University of Kansas, where her undergraduate studies were free.Prucha, F. P. \u201cAnnie Heloise Abel\u201d in Notable American Women, 1607-1950, E. T. James et al., eds. (1971). After two years of high school teaching, she attended the University of Kansas for her M.A. in History. Under the direction of Kansas historian Frank Haywood Hodder, Abel wrote an M.A. thesis entitled: \"Indian Reservations in Kansas and the Extinguishment of Their Title.\"James C.  Malin, \" Frank Heywood Hodder, 1860-1935\" Kansas State Historical Quarterly 5 (May 1936),115-121.  Based on that work, her Kansas advisor there recommended her for PhD coursework at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York and Abel began her studies there in 1900.Smith College, Northampton, Massachusetts, 1922, Annual Yearbook, p. 15. After her potential advisor, Moses Coit Tyler, died, she decided to leave Cornell, and return to Kansas. To pay for graduate tuition, she returned to teaching high school from 1901 to 1903.", "The American Historical Association awarded her the Justin Winsor Prize in 1906 for her early work. That prize, created by the American Historical Association to recognize the best manuscript in the history of the Western Hemisphere, made Annie Abel an authority on national Indian policy.  Because only teaching colleges or women's colleges would hire women, it took her some years to find full-time academic work. Abel served briefly as the Historian for the U.S. Indian office and taught part-time at Goucher College, a women's college outside of Washington, DC.  She became active in local suffrage politics after she became a citizen in 1910.National Archives and Records Administration (NARA); Washington, D.C.; Naturalization records; NAI Number: 654310, Annie Heloise Abel, 1910, Baltimore, Maryland. She was hired as a faculty member at Smith College in Northampton Massachusetts in 1908 and spent 12 years teaching there, moving up the academic ladder."]}, {"page": "Annie Abel", "response": ["#REDIRECT Annie Heloise Abel"]}, {"page": "George Cockburn Henderson", "response": ["On 27 October 1922 Henderson married Dr. Annie Heloise Abel (1873\u20131947), an English-born Professor of History in America, with an interest in American colonial history."]}]}}
