W. Symonds & B. B. Whineray and also in The Country Life Book of English Furniture by Edward T. Joy, a table designed by E. W. Godwin in 1868 and made in large numbers by William Watt, and Collinson and Lock, is a coffee table.  If this is correct it may be one of the earliest made in Europe. Other sources, however, list it only as \"table\" so this can be stated categorically. Far from being a low table, this table was about twenty-seven inches high."]}, {"page": "R.W.
