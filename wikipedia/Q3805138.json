After the failure of the local church, Looney turned to the Shakespeare authorship question, publishing in 1920 his theory that de Vere was the author of most of the poems and plays published in Shakespeare's name. He later argued that de Vere had also written works published under the names of other poets.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Oxfordian theory of Shakespeare authorship", "response": ["By the beginning of the twentieth century other candidates, typically aristocrats, were put forward, most notably Roger Manners, 5th Earl of Rutland, and William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby. Oxford's candidacy as sole author was first proposed by J. Thomas Looney in his 1920 book Shakespeare Identified in Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford.. Following earlier anti-Stratfordians, Looney argued that the known facts of Shakespeare's life did not fit the personality he ascribed to the author of the plays. Like other anti-Stratfordians before him, Looney referred to the absence of records concerning Shakespeare's education, his limited experience of the world, his allegedly poor handwriting skills (evidenced in his signatures), and the \"dirt and ignorance\" of Stratford at the time. Shakespeare had a petty \"acquisitive disposition\", he said, while the plays made heroes of free-spending figures.. They also portrayed middle and lower-class people negatively, while Shakespearian heroes were typically aristocratic. Looney referred to scholars who found in the plays evidence that their author was an expert in law, widely read in ancient Latin literature, and could speak French and Italian. Looney believed that even very early works such as Love's Labour's Lost implied that he was already a person of \"matured powers\", in his forties or fifties, with wide experience of the world.. Looney considered that Oxford's personality fitted that he deduced from the plays, and also identified characters in the plays as detailed portraits of Oxford's family and personal contacts. Several characters, including Hamlet and Bertram (in All's Well that Ends Well), were, he believed, self-portraits. Adapting arguments earlier used for Rutland and Derby, Looney fitted events in the plays to episodes in Oxford's life, including his travels to France and Italy, the settings for many plays. Oxford's death in 1604 was linked to a drop-off in the publication of Shakespeare plays. Looney declared that the late play The Tempest was not written by Oxford, and that others performed or published after Oxford's death were most probably left incomplete and finished by other writers, thus explaining the apparent idiosyncrasies of style found in the late Shakespeare plays. Looney also introduced the argument that the reference to the \"ever-living poet\" in the 1609 dedication to Shakespeare's sonnets implied that the author was dead at the time of publication.", "In the opinion of J. Thomas Looney, as \"far as forms of versification are concerned De Vere presents just that rich variety which is so noticeable in Shakespeare; and almost all the forms he employs we find reproduced in the Shakespeare work.\" Oxfordian Louis P. B\u00e9n\u00e9zet created the \"B\u00e9n\u00e9zet test\", a collage of lines from Shakespeare and lines he thought were representative of Oxford, challenging non-specialists to tell the difference between the two authors. May notes that Looney compared various motifs, rhetorical devices and phrases with certain Shakespeare works to find similarities he said were \"the most crucial in the piecing together of the case\", but that  for some of those \"crucial\" examples Looney used six poems mistakenly attributed to Oxford that were actually written by Greene, Campion, and Greville. B\u00e9n\u00e9zet also used two lines from Greene that he thought were Oxford's, while succeeding Oxfordians, including Charles Wisner Barrell, have also misattributed poems to Oxford. \"This on-going confusion of Oxford's genuine verse with that of at least three other poets\", writes May, \"illustrates the wholesale failure of the basic Oxfordian methodology.\"", "Because Shakespeare lived until 1616, Oxfordians question why, if he were the author, did he not eulogise Queen Elizabeth at her death in 1603 or Henry, Prince of Wales, at his in 1612. They believe Oxford's 1604 death provides the explanation.Wright, Daniel.\"The Funeral Elegy Scandal.\"  The Shakespeare Fellowship. In an age when such actions were expected, Shakespeare also failed to memorialise the coronation of James I in 1604, the marriage of Princess Elizabeth in 1612, and the investiture of Prince Charles as the new Prince of Wales in 1613.Miller, Ruth Loyd. Oxfordian Vistas.  Vol II of Shakespeare Identified, by J. Thomas Looney and edited by Ruth Loyd Miller. Kennikat Press, 1975. pp. 290\u201394.", "Oxfordian writers say some literary allusions imply that the playwright and poet died prior to 1609, when Shake-Speares Sonnets appeared with the epithet \"our ever-living poet\" in its dedication. They claim that the phrase \"ever-living\" rarely, if ever, referred to a living person, but instead was used to refer to the eternal soul of the deceased.Miller, Ruth Loyd.Oxfordian Vistas.  Vol II of Shakespeare Identified, by J. Thomas Looney and edited by Ruth Loyd Miller. Kennikat Press, 1975. pp. 211\u201314. Bacon, Derby, Neville, and William Shakespeare all lived well past the 1609 publication of the Sonnets.", "J. Thomas Looney found John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford is \"hardly mentioned except to be praised\" in Henry VI, Part Three; the play ahistorically depicts him participating in the Battle of Tewkesbury and being captured.Asimov, Isaac. Asimov\u2019s Guide to Shakespeare. Vol. II. Wings book, 1970. p. 674 Oxfordians, such as Dorothy and Charlton Ogburn, believe Shakespeare created such a role for the 13th Earl because it was the easiest way Edward de Vere could have \"advertised his loyalty to the Tudor Queen\" and remind her of \"the historic part borne by the Earls of Oxford in defeating the usurpers and restoring the Lancastrians to power\". Looney also notes that in Richard III, when the future Henry VII appears, the same Earl of Oxford is \"by his side; and it is Oxford who, as premier nobleman, replies first to the king's address to his followers\"."]}, {"page": "1920 in literature", "response": ["*J.
