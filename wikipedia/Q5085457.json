He then played for Newstead Byron for a time, before moving on to Notts County in July 1894. However, Richards transferred to Notts County's city rivals, Nottingham Forest, only 18 months later, where he played for a total of three seasons. He made 74 league appearances for Forest, scoring 20 goals.\nIn December 1898, Richards transferred to Grimsby Town, where he made 80 league appearances and scored 42 goals, including three penalties. In his final season with Grimsby, Richards and the rest of the team won promotion to the First Division by finishing top of the Second Division. He was then picked up by Leicester Fosse in June 1901. In his one season at Leicester, Richards made a total of 25 appearances, and scored five goals.\nIn August 1902, Richards signed for Manchester United, who had recently been rescued from financial difficulties by a generous benefactor, and renamed from Newton Heath FC. The club was languishing in the Second Division at the time, and was just beginning to get back on its feet. Richards played for United for just one season, scoring just one goal in eight league appearances. He finally moved to Doncaster Rovers in March 1903, where he would play till the end of the season before going into retirement.Richards won his only England cap on 5 March 1898, in a 3\u20132 victory over Ireland in the Home Championship.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Nottingham Forest F.C.", "response": ["Forest's first FA Cup semi-final win was at the fifth attempt, the 1897\u201398 FA Cup 2\u20130 replay win against Southampton.
