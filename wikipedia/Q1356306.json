He won the Sullivan Prize for composition, the Cobbett Prize for chamber music, and was twice winner of the Ernest Farrar Prize for composition. Despite these honours, he was not greatly impressed by the establishment: he found his fellow-students \"amateurish and folksy\" and the staff \"inclined to suspect technical brilliance of being superficial and insincere\". Another Ireland pupil, the composer Humphrey Searle, said that Ireland could be \"an inspiring teacher to those on his own wavelength\"; Britten was not, and learned little from him.Cole, Hugo. \"Review \u2013 Britten\", Tempo, New Series, No 78, Autumn 1966, pp. 31\u201332  He continued to study privately with Bridge, although he later praised Ireland for \"nurs[ing] me very gently through a very, very difficult musical adolescence\"."]}, {"page": "Gerald Finzi", "response": ["Finzi's father, a successful shipbroker, died a fortnight short of his son's eighth birthday.McVeagh, p. 6 Finzi was educated privately. During World War I the family settled in Harrogate, and Finzi began to study music at Christ Church, High Harrogate, under Ernest Farrar from 1915.McVeagh, p. 9 Farrar, a former pupil of Stanford, was then aged thirty and he described Finzi as \"very shy, but full of poetry\". Finzi found him a sympathetic teacher, and Farrar's death at the Western Front affected him deeply. During those formative years he also suffered the loss of all three of his brothers. These adversities contributed to Finzi's bleak outlook on life, but he found solace in the poetry of Thomas Traherne and his favourite, Thomas Hardy, whose poems, as well as those by Christina Rossetti, he began to set to music. In the poetry of Hardy, Traherne, and later William Wordsworth, Finzi was attracted by the recurrent motif of the innocence of childhood corrupted by adult experience. From the very beginning most of his music was elegiac in tone."]}, {"page": "1918 in music", "response": ["*September 18 \u2013 Ernest Farrar, composer (b. 1885) (killed in action)"]}, {"page": "Frank Bridge", "response": ["Bridge's idiom in the wartime works tends towards moderation, but after the war his language developed significantly, building on the experiments with impressionist harmony found in the wartime piano and orchestral music. Bridge's technical ambitions (documented in his correspondence) prompted him to attempt more complex, larger works, with more advanced harmonic elements and motivic working. Several of the resulting works have some expressive connections with the First World War, which appears to have influenced the mood of the Piano Sonata (dedicated to his friend Ernest Farrar, killed in 1918) and certainly Oration.
