Cordle (born 29 September 1960) is a Welsh former rugby union, and professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1980s and 1990s. He played club level rugby union (RU) for Cardiff RFC, as a Wing, i.e. number 11 and 14, and representative level rugby league (RL) for Great Britain and Wales, and at club level for Bradford Northern and South Wales (loan), as a wing, i.e. number 2 or 5.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cardiff RFC", "response": ["Cardiff had been knocked in the quarter-finals of the 1982\u201383 cup by eventual winners Pontypool, but made it up for it with a third triumph in four years, beating Neath 24\u201319 in the final with tries from flanker Owen Golding and wing Gerald Cordle and 16 points from Gareth Davies. Then, on 12 October 1984, they beat Australia 16\u201312, thanks to eight points from Gareth Davies along with a penalty try and a score from Adrian Hadley. The same Australian side went on to complete a \"Grand Slam\" (beating England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland). Australia haven't played Cardiff RFC since, leaving the club with a perfect record of six wins from six games against the Wallabies (although Cardiff Blues did lose to Australia 31\u20133 in 2009). 1985 was very nearly another successful year for the club, beating Neath and Pontypool on their way to the Schweppes Cup final where, despite tries from wing Gerald Cordle and captain Alan Phillips alongside two penalties from Gareth Davies, they fell to an agonising 15\u201314 defeat to Llanelli. After this, Terry Holmes left the club to play rugby league.", "The club bounced back immediately however, beating Newport in the final of 1985\u201386 cup final 28\u201321, with Adrian Hadley scoring a hat-trick, Holmes's replacement, scrum-half Neil O'Brien, bagging another try and 12 points coming from the boot of fly-half Gareth Davies in his last game for the club against Welsh opposition before retiring. One year later, Cardiff were part of the first Challenge Cup final to go to extra time, with the scores 9\u20139 after 80 minutes, all Cardiff's points coming from the boot of Davies's replacement, Geraint John. Gerald Cordle scored to break the deadlock but the conversion was missed and Swansea scored a converted try soon after, putting them in the lead. But a late drop goal from full-back Mike Rayer won it for the Arms Park side capping one of the most successful periods in the club's history, with five Schweppes Cup victories in seven years.", "Cardiff's success began to tail off towards the end of the 1980s, with Adrian Hadley leaving for rugby league in 1988 and Gerald Cordle following in 89, and they could only manage two Cup quarter-finals and one semi-final appearance in the last three years of the decade. However, both Dai Young and Bob Norster were selected for the Lions tour to Australia in 1989, the only Lions team to come from 1\u20130 down to win the series. Young followed Hadley and Cordle to rugby league shortly after this, while Whitefoot and Norster both retired in 1990."]}, {"page": "List of Bradford Bulls internationals", "response": ["* Gerald Cordle won caps for Wales while at Bradford Northern in 1992 against France (sub), and England, in 1993 against New Zealand, in 1994 against France, and Australia (sub), in 1996 against France, and won a cap for Great Britain while at Bradford Northern in 1990 against France"]}, {"page": "1994 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France", "response": ["|IC ||14|| Gerald Cordle"]}, {"page": "List of Great Britain national rugby league team players", "response": ["* Gerald Cordle circa-1990"]}, {"page": "1990\u201391 League Cup (rugby league)", "response": ["|Des Drummond (c)||2||Gerald Cordle"]}, {"page": "1993 New Zealand rugby league tour of Great Britain and France", "response": ["|RW ||2|| Gerald Cordle"]}, {"page": "1989\u201390 Rugby League Premiership", "response": ["|2|| Gerald Cordle"]}, {"page": "Cordle", "response": ["*Gerald Cordle (born 1960), Welsh rugby union and rugby league player"]}, {"page": "The Socially Distant Sports Bar", "response": ["|Stealing a Living|| Steven Gerrard\u2019s slip (Elis)|| Buck Shelford.
