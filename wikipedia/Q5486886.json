Lee Thompson and writer Ted Willis. They made two films for Associated British Picture Corporation: the award-winning Woman in a Dressing Gown (1957) and No Trees in the Street (1959).Godwin was a producer for films such as Don't Bother to Knock (1961) and Demons of the Mind (1972).

Godwin was influenced by Flagg and Charles Dana Gibson, and reflections of both can be seen in Godwin's work. Illustration historian and critic Jim Vadeboncoeur gave Godwin the highest ranking:", ":While obviously influenced by Flagg (and Charles Dana Gibson), Godwin managed to create a style that was recognizably his and that stood out from both his idols and the mass of clones that were cropping up everywhere. His ability to create tones, especially facial characteristics, with his pen and brush were equal to and in some ways better than Gibson and, I think, obviously superior to Flagg. His use of pen and brush in the same illustration demonstrated an understanding of the medium that set his work apart from his contemporaries. It, combined with his tonal skills, gave his work a depth and weight that was seldom equaled. Walt and Roger Reed in The Illustrator in America, 1880-1980 credit some of this realism to his modeling of busts in clay for reference. They don't say when he adopted this practice, but it's unlikely that he was doing this so early in his career.Vadeboncoeur, Jim. \"Illustrators: Frank Godwin\"", "A Society of Illustrators vice-president, Godwin was a member of the National Press Club and the Dutch Treat and Salmagundi clubs.Holtz, Allan. \"Ink-Slinger Profiles: Frank Godwin,\" Stripper's Guide (March 07, 2012).", "*\"Frank Godwin\" by Jim Vadeboncoeur"]}, {"page": "Sammy's Super T-Shirt", "response": ["The theme song, Sammy's Super T-Shirt was written by Harry Robinson and Frank Godwin.
