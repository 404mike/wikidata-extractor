Although he did not admit culpability, at a conciliation meeting in October 2013 Sizer agreed to have his online web usage monitored.In 2015, the Board of Deputies lodged a further complaint against Sizer, this time for posting a link accusing Jews and Israel of responsibility for the 9/11 attacks in the United States.
