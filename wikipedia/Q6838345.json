A midfielder, he played for Preston North End and Port Vale, but made his name at both Southport and Wigan Athletic. He helped Southport to the Fourth Division title in 1972\u201373, and also played for Wigan in their first ever season in the Football League. He also enjoyed an extensive non-league career, turning out for eleven different clubs, as well as spending a brief period in the United States with Dallas Tornado.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Michael Moore (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Mick Moore (born 1952), English footballer"]}, {"page": "Dennis Butler", "response": ["Following his retirement as a player, he coached at Rochdale and Bury. He was made assistant manager at Port Vale under Bobby Smith in November 1977. After Smith's departure to Swindon Town, he became manager for the 1978\u201379 season. The \"Valiants\" finished 16th in the Fourth Division and later he left by mutual consent in August 1979. He had signed popular player Bernie Wright from Bradford City for \u00a39,000, however most of his big money signings had torrid times at Vale Park. He signed right-back Neil Wilkinson (free), Ken Todd (a club-record \u00a337,000 signing despite only having made a handful of appearances for Wolverhampton Wanderers), Gerry Keenan (\u00a315,000), Felix Healy (\u00a38,000), Kevin Tully (\u00a33,000 plus Neil Wilkinson), Andy Proudlove (\u00a31,000), Peter Farrell (breaking the club-record again at \u00a340,000), and Bob Delgado (\u00a330,000). To finance these signings, he sold John Froggatt (\u00a38,000), Mick Moore (\u00a32,000), Terry Bailey (\u00a32,000), Ken Beamish (\u00a335,000), and John Ridley (\u00a355,000). After his team were booed he called the fans 'a bunch of yobs'. Vale recorded a \u00a352,000 loss despite a remarkable \u00a3225,000 income from the club's commercial department. Butler's transfer dealings had lost the club \u00a336,000, whilst wages more than doubled from \u00a3113,000 to \u00a3259,000.

In August the club broke their transfer record for Wolves midfielder Ken Todd, paying \u00a337,000 for a youngster with just five league appearances to his name.
