He was a regular in the Surrey side for 15 years up to the First World War, scoring 1,000 runs and more in every season from 1899 to 1914. His best year was 1906 when he scored 2,309 runs at an average of more than 45 runs an innings, and he was named as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1907. His highest score, 276, was made against Hampshire in 1909 at The Oval, when he shared a second wicket partnership of 371 with Jack Hobbs that remains a Surrey record.\nHayes' bowling was intermittently useful: in 1905, he took 76 wickets, and in 1912 there were 60, but in other seasons he took very few and was expensive. As a slip fielder, he took more than 600 catches in all matches.\nHayes' Test match career was not a success. He went to South African under Pelham Warner in 1905\u201306 and played in three of the Tests in the first series ever won against England by the South African cricket team. He scored just 69 runs, with a top score of 35. He also went on the 1907\u201308 tour to Australia, but his form was so poor that he was not picked for any of the Tests. In 1909, he played once in a home Test against the Australians, but though the match was won, he scored only 13 runs in his two innings. Finally, he was recalled for one match against South Africa in the 1912 Triangular Tournament, and scored just four runs.\nAfter distinguished war service that won him the MBE, Hayes returned to Surrey as an amateur in 1919, but retired after just one season. He was afflicted with a contracture of the fingers of the right hand that made holding a bat difficult: this was attributed to years of fielding at slip to the stinging pace of Tom Richardson and William Lockwood. He moved to Leicestershire as coach and Second Eleven captain, and was so successful that, in 1926, at the age of 49, he was picked for five first-team matches, scoring 99 against Nottinghamshire in his first game and heading the county's averages.\nIn all cricket, he scored 27,318 runs with 48 centuries, and took 515 wickets.\nHe was later coach at Surrey. In 1933 he retired to run a pub, the Paxton Arms in West Norwood, being its landlord for 20 years.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1906 in sports", "response": ["* Wisden Cricketers of the Year \u2013 Jack Crawford, Arthur Fielder, Ernie Hayes, Kenneth Hutchings, Neville Knox"]}, {"page": "1909 in sports", "response": ["* Most runs \u2013 Ernie Hayes 2105 @ 36.29 (HS 276)"]}, {"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  Ernie Hayes"]}, {"page": "Surrey County Cricket Club", "response": ["*  Ernie Hayes"]}, {"page": "1912 Triangular Tournament", "response": ["*Ernie Hayes"]}, {"page": "List of Test cricketers", "response": ["Ernie Hayes \u00b7"]}, {"page": "1903 English cricket season", "response": [" || Ernie Hayes || Surrey || 26 || 1449 || 34.50 || 3 || 8"]}, {"page": "Ernest Hayes", "response": ["* Ernie Hayes (1876\u20131953), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Silk & Soul", "response": ["*Ernie Hayes - piano, harpsichord"]}, {"page": "Hayes (surname)", "response": ["| Ernie Hayes || 1876 || 1953 || EnglishProfessional cricketer; Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE)"]}, {"page": "1906 English cricket season", "response": ["* Jack Crawford, Arthur Fielder, Ernie Hayes, Kenneth Hutchings, Neville Knox", "|Ernie Hayes || Surrey || 35 || 56 || 5 || 2309 || 218 || 45.27 || 7 || 11"]}, {"page": "Lord Brackley's XI cricket team in the West Indies in 1904\u201305", "response": ["For the first time on a tour of the West Indies, professionals were taken: Ernie Hayes of Surrey and George Thompson of Northamptonshire.", "*Ernie Hayes", "| align=left | Ernie Hayes || 9 || 16 || 1 || 425 || 100* || 28.33 || 2 || 1 || 8", "| align=left | Ernie Hayes || 121.2 || 25 || 325 || 26 || 3-16 || 12.50 || - || -"]}, {"page": "Pairs in Test and first-class cricket", "response": ["*Ernie Hayes for England v South Africa at Cape Town in 1905-06"]}, {"page": "Cricket in World War I", "response": ["210 first-class cricketers enlisted in the armed services, and others undertook war related work in support of the war effort.

In the following game, Hobbs scored 159 against Warwickshire and shared an opening partnership of 352 with Hayward, then top-scored in the first innings of Surrey's victory over the touring Australian team. Surrey then played Warwickshire again, and Hobbs scored a century in each innings before hitting 99 against Essex in the next match. Such form placed him in contention for a place in the England team to play Australia, but the strength of English batting at the time meant that he was not a certainty. Furthermore, the England captain, Archie MacLaren, remained unconvinced that Hobbs possessed the required quality. However, the Surrey captain, Leveson-Gower, was a selector that year. He persuaded the committee to include Hobbs in the squad, then convinced a reluctant MacLaren to play him in the team.McKinstry, pp. 89\u201391."]}, {"page": "1903 County Championship", "response": ["|style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1,449 ||style=\"text-align:center;\"| 34.50 || Ernie Hayes || Surrey"]}, {"page": "1907 County Championship", "response": ["|style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1,721 ||style=\"text-align:center;\"| 37.41 || Ernie Hayes || Surrey"]}, {"page": "1909 County Championship", "response": ["|style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1,844 ||style=\"text-align:center;\"| 39.23 || Ernie Hayes || Surrey"]}, {"page": "Norman Armstrong", "response": ["After Armstrong's single unsuccessful appearance as an amateur in 1919, he disappeared into club cricket in Loughborough, but in 1924 he re-emerged in a single match as an all-rounder as Leicestershire entered its second team in the Minor Counties competition, though he was injured in the game. The establishment of a second team in the Minor Counties was part of a series of moves intended to produce a stronger team for what had traditionally been one of the weaker English counties; the moves included the appointment of the club's first full-time coach, the former Surrey and England player Ernie Hayes, and the recruitment of new professionals. Armstrong was cited then and later as a player who had benefited from this coaching and the more professional set-up."]}]}}
