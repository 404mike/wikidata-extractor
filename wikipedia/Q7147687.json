On the GNR, Patrick Stirling built 53 examples with outside cylinders at Doncaster railway works between 1870 and 1895, for use on the main line between London and York. They ran at an average speed of more than 60\u00a0mph during the race to the north, and were called eight-footers because of the driving wheel, that was more than 8\u00a0ft. in diameter.
