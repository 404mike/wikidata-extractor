His father was Gille Chlerig. He is often known as Morgrund or Morgan.\nIt is possible that Morgg\u00e1n participated in the so-called Revolt of the Earls, a protest by some of the native Scottish nobility at King M\u00e1el Coluim IV's trip to France as a vassal of King Henry II of England. \nIt is also possible that he became estranged from the French-speaking king William I, as Morgg\u00e1n's name appears in no royal acts of the latter king's reign. \nHe married Agnes, a patroness of churches. Agnes was probably related to the de Warenne family - the family who married Ada de Warenne to Henry of Scotland and mother of Kings Malcolm IV and William the Lion. Morgg\u00e1n and Agnes had at least one son, Donnchad, who eventually succeeded to become a Mormaer of Mar. Morgg\u00e1n had another two sons, M\u00e1el Coluim and James, but they may have been illegitimate - i.e. the product of an uncanonical marriage acceptable in the Celtic system, but not in the Franco-Roman system then gaining favour in Scotland. \nHe went on to marry Orabilis FitzNess de Leuchars divorced wife of Sir Robert de Quincy Justiciar of Lothian, who with her first husband was the mother of Saher de Quincy. Orabilis survived Morgg\u00e1n, and married thirdly Adam of Fife, brother of Duncan II, Earl of Fife.\nHis daughter Alesta of Mar was married to Alan Fitzwalter, 2nd High Steward of Scotland who was possibly mother to Walter Stewart, 3rd High Steward of Scotland.\nHe appears in royal charters dated as early as 1147. He is attested in the documents for the last time in 1178, and was dead by 1183.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Earl of Mar", "response": ["*Morgg\u00e1n, Earl of Mar (died before 1183)"]}, {"page": "List of peers 1140\u20131149", "response": ["|Morgg\u00e1n, Earl of Mar||Abt. 1140||Abt. 1178||"]}, {"page": "List of peers 1150\u20131159", "response": ["|Earl of Mar (1114)||Morgg\u00e1n, Earl of Mar||Abt. 1140||Abt. 1178||"]}, {"page": "List of peers 1160\u20131169", "response": ["|Earl of Mar (1114)||Morgg\u00e1n, Earl of Mar||Abt. 1140||Abt. 1178||"]}, {"page": "List of peers 1170\u20131179", "response": ["|rowspan=2|Earl of Mar (1114)||Morgg\u00e1n, Earl of Mar||Abt. 1140||Abt. 1178||Died"]}, {"page": "Donnchad I, Earl of Fife", "response": ["* Adam of Fife.
