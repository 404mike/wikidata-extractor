In Boston, Welch ran faster than all the British women in London. In August 1988, both Ford and Welch withdrew from the Olympic team due to injury and an Olympic place was offered to Veronique Marot, who declined it due to injury. The place was then offered to Paula Fudge, who also turned it down. Finally, only a few weeks before the Olympic marathon on 23 September, Sue Crehan and Hulley (then Pain), were both selected to join Tooby in the British Olympic team.
