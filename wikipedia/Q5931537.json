Luttrell's majority was a slender 2.5% of the votes, and although he increased it slightly in 1895, he did not contest the seat in 1900, when the Liberal Unionist John Ward Spear won it with a majority of only 15 votes. Luttrell stood again at the 1906 general election and regained the seat by a wide margin, but his majority was cut in January 1910 and at the December 1910 general election Spear unseated him for a second time.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1895 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Hugh Luttrell"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1892 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Hugh Luttrell"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the January 1910 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Hugh Luttrell"]}, {"page": "Tavistock (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|| 1892 || Hugh Luttrell ||Liberal", "|| 1906 || Hugh Luttrell ||Liberal", "thumb|120px|Hugh Luttrell"]}, {"page": "Hugh Courtenay Fownes Luttrell", "response": ["#REDIRECT Hugh Luttrell (Liberal politician) "]}, {"page": "John Spear", "response": ["He was elected at the 1900 general election as Member of Parliament (MP) for the Tavistock division of Devon, with a majority of only 15 votes.
