Luttrell's majority was a slender 2.5% of the votes, and although he increased it slightly in 1895, he did not contest the seat in 1900, when the Liberal Unionist John Ward Spear won it with a majority of only 15 votes. Luttrell stood again at the 1906 general election and regained the seat by a wide margin, but his majority was cut in January 1910 and at the December 1910 general election Spear unseated him for a second time.", "link_mentions": {}}}
