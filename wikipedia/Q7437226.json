The club had to turn to a youth policy to rebuild the team, with the emergence of players like John Sheridan, Neil Aspin, Denis Irwin and Scott Sellars. After top half finishes in his first two seasons in charge, the 1984\u201385 season saw a push for promotion that was lost on the final day at Birmingham City. Following failure to gain promotion from the Second Division, Gray ended association with Leeds after 20 years, 561 games and 68 goals."]}, {"page": "Billy Bremner", "response": ["Bremner was appointed as Leeds United manager in October 1985, having impressed the boardroom with his work at Doncaster, particularly his negotiation skills during the sale of Ian Snodin; Leeds paid Doncaster \u00a345,000 in compensation. The club had declined during his absence; Leeds had dropped down into the Second Division, sold Elland Road to the council to raise money, and club supporters picked up a reputation for violence after regular hooligan riots in the stands. He quickly reinstated Don Revie's philosophy and his little traditions, for example he reinstated the sessions of carpet bowls on Friday evenings. Despite this he appointed Ian Snodin as club captain, and dropped former captain and teammate Peter Lorimer from the starting line eleven. He also moved on the young players signed by former manager and teammate Eddie Gray, choosing to sign experienced players in their place. Five key young players to leave the club were Scott Sellars (\u00a320,000 to Blackburn Rovers), Terry Phelan (free transfer to Swansea City), Denis Irwin, Tommy Wright and Andy Linighan (all to Oldham Athletic for \u00a360,000, \u00a355,000 and \u00a380,000 respectively). The money raised allowed him to buy central defender Brendan Ormsby (\u00a365,000 from Aston Villa), and also sign David Rennie, Brian Caswell and Ronnie Robinson. Leeds struggled in the 1985\u201386 season, but managed to steer away from the relegation zone to finish in 14th place."]}, {"page": "1993\u201394 FA Premier League", "response": ["| align=\"left\" |  Scott Sellars"]}, {"page": "Robbie Elliott", "response": ["Keegan's managerial departure from Newcastle also yielded the end of Elliott's first spell with his boyhood club. New manager Kenny Dalglish accepted a bid of around \u00a32.5 million for Elliott from Division One champions Bolton Wanderers in July 1997, becoming their record signing at the time. Bolton had, at the time, moved to the new 25,000 all-seater Reebok Stadium arena and this looked to be a new start for Elliott as he faced the prospect of more regular first team football alongside his former Newcastle teammates Alan Thompson, Peter Beardsley, Scott Sellars and Franz Carr, all of whom were also on Bolton's books at that time."]}, {"page": "Paul Stretford", "response": ["Stretford had a lengthy association with Newcastle. He first represented Andrew Cole while he was a player at the club, suggested by a second player, Scott Sellars, and Kenneth Shepherd had formerly been employed by Proactive Sports Management, working for Stretford from an office in Newcastle's St James Park. According to Manchester United's chief executive, David Gill, Wayne Rooney's original transfer to Manchester United was provoked by Newcastle's apparent interest in the player."]}, {"page": "Sellars", "response": ["* Scott Sellars (born 1965), English footballer"]}, {"page": "History of Leeds United F.C.", "response": ["Clarke's spending had left Leeds in a precarious financial situation, and Gray was forced to concentrate on youth development to rebuild the team. Gray had no money to spend on team building, and those players he developed were often sold off as well. Young players to emerge during this period included Neil Aspin, Denis Irwin, John Sheridan, Scott Sellars and Bob Taylor \u2013 who all enjoyed considerable success at other clubs after leaving Leeds. The 1984\u201385 season saw Leeds take the promotion battle to the final game, but lost 1\u20130 away to Birmingham City. However, that game will be remembered for all the wrong reasons by both clubs due to a high-profile hooliganism incident at St Andrew's stadium. Leeds fans rioted at the game, causing a wall to collapse and crushing a 15-year-old boy to death. 96 policemen were injured, hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of damage was caused by vandalism and graffiti, and the collapsed wall also crushed several parked motor vehicles beyond repair."]}]}}
