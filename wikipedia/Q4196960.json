This had  flangeless driving wheels, and was only moderately successful, having a tendency to derail. By the 1870s, improved design of bogies giving more flexibility enabled designers to create fast standard gauge express passenger locomotives of this type. On the GNR, Patrick Stirling built 53 examples with outside cylinders at Doncaster railway works between 1870 and 1895, for use on the main line between London and York. They ran at an average speed of more than 60\u00a0mph during the race to the north, and were called eight-footers because of the driving wheel, that was more than 8\u00a0ft. in diameter. Stirling's successor Henry Ivatt built a further twelve singles between 1898-1901 before moving on to larger 4-4-2 designs.", "The Stirling 'eight-footers' were very successful but were best suited to the predominantly straight and flat GNR main line in Cambridgeshire and the Vale of York. Other railways slowly replaced their original 'singles' with 4-4-0 locomotives that offered better traction at the cost of ultimate speed. However, in 1886 Francis Holt, manager at the Derby Works of the Midland Railway invented a practical form of steam sanding gear which allowed locomotive crews to quickly and effectively stop wheelspin. This led to the Midland reviving the 'single' in the form of the distinctive inside cylinder \"Spinners\"; eighty-five were built to five designs by Samuel Waite Johnson between 1887 and 1900.Baxter (1977), p. 55. One 115 class, No. 673, survives at the National Railway Museum, York. Other railways adopted the steam-powered sander, leading to a resurgence of interest in the 'single' for fast express passenger work in the 1880s and 1890s. William Dean of the Great Western built fifty examples of the standard gauge GWR 3031 Class Achilles class from 1893-1899.Baxter (1977), p. 57. No 3065 Duke of Connaught contributed to the record-breaking run of the Ocean Mail express train from Plymouth to Paddington in 227 minutes on 9 May 1904, when it took over the train at Bristol from No 3440 City of Truro and completed the journey to Paddington in 99 minutes 46 seconds. By 1900 average train loads had grown beyond the capability of even a sander-fitted 'single' and development stopped. On the GNR Stirling's famous 'eight-footers' required Double heading with 4-4-0s before they were replaced by the 'Klondyke' 4-4-2 engines designed by Henry Ivatt, while on the Midland Samuel Johnson developed a powerful compound 4-4-0 to replace his 'Spinners'."]}, {"page": "H.
