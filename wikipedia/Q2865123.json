His only major rivals were seen as Sullivan, Frederic Hymen Cowen, Parry, Alexander Mackenzie and Arthur Goring Thomas.

Stanford helped Parry in particular to gain recognition, commissioning incidental music from him for a Cambridge production of Aristophanes' The Birds and a symphony (the \"Cambridge\") for the musical society. At Cambridge Stanford continued to raise the profile of CUMS, as well as his own, by securing appearances by leading international musicians including Joachim, Hans Richter, Alfredo Piatti and Edward Dannreuther. The society attracted further attention by premiering works by Cowen, Parry, Mackenzie, Goring Thomas and others. Stanford was also making an impression in his capacity as organist of Trinity, raising musical standards and composing what his biographer Jeremy Dibble calls \"some highly distinctive church music\" including a Service in B (1879), the anthem \"The Lord is my shepherd\" (1886) and three Latin motets including Beati quorum via (1888)."]}, {"page": "Nellie Melba", "response": ["From the 1890s, Melba played a wide range of parts at Covent Garden, mostly in the lyric soprano repertoire, but with some heavier roles also.

S. Gilbert to supply the libretto for a grand opera, but Gilbert declined, writing that in grand opera the librettist's role is subordinate to that of the composer, and that the public would, in any case, not accept a serious work from his pen.  Gilbert recommended Julian Sturgis to write the libretto.  Sturgis had written the libretto for Nadeshda by Arthur Goring Thomas (1885), which had been produced with success by Carl Rosa.  Ivanhoe had been treated operatically previously, including an 1826 pastiche opera with music by Rossini and operas by Marschner in 1829, Pacini in 1832 and Nicolai in 1840.  Both Sullivan and the critics noted that Scott's novel, with its many scenes, would make for a complex adaptation.Lamb (1973), p. 476  Sturgis set to work on Ivanhoe in the spring or early summer of 1889.  The libretto uses some of the language directly from the novel and does not change the basic story.  However, in condensing the lengthy and action-packed novel for a stage work, the libretto relies on the audience's knowledge of the novel and omits many scenes, also entirely omitting the characters of Gurth the Swineherd, Oswald, Cedric's manservant, some of King John's advisors, and Athelstane the Unready, among others.

C. Stephenson, The Black Mask, including a Spanish setting involving guerillas during the Peninsular War. Gilbert then completed Act I assuming that there were no conflicts, but finally received a response from Cellier by early January, stating that the change in setting did indeed conflict with his earlier work; Gilbert replied that he was ending the collaboration, and that Horace Sedger, the manager and lessee of London's Lyric Theatre, where the piece was to be produced, agreed with this. In early February, Gilbert approached composer Arthur Goring Thomas to set the libretto to music, and Thomas sketched out music to four musical numbers. For unknown reasons, possibly Thomas's poor health, he never set the opera; when Cellier returned to England in April 1891, he sought, through his and Gilbert's mutual friend, Edward Chappell, to mend fences with Gilbert, and, after some flattery, succeeded. Gilbert changed the setting to Sicily, and the guerillas became brigands; it turned out that The Black Mask was never produced."]}, {"page": "B. C.
