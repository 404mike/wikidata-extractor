Robeson, Essie, and Marie Seton traveled to the Soviet Union on an invitation from Sergei Eisenstein in December 1934. A stopover in Berlin enlightened Robeson to the racism in Nazi Germany;  and, on his arrival in Moscow, in the Soviet Union, Robeson said, \"Here I am not a Negro but a human being for the first time in my life\u00a0...

In mid-1932, the Sinclairs were able to secure the services of Sol Lesser, who had just opened his distribution office in New York, Principal Distributing Corporation. Lesser agreed to supervise post-production work on the miles of negative \u2014 at the Trust's expense \u2014 and distribute any resulting product. Two short feature films and a short subject\u2014Thunder Over Mexico based on the \"Maguey\" footage, Eisenstein in Mexico, and Death Day respectively\u2014were completed and released in the United States between the autumn of 1933 and early 1934. Eisenstein never saw any of the Sinclair-Lesser films, nor a later effort by his first biographer, Marie Seton, called Time in the Sun, released in 1940. He would publicly maintain that he had lost all interest in the project. In 1978, Gregori Aleksandrov released \u2013 with the same name in contravention to the copyright \u2013 his own version, which was awarded the Honorable Golden Prize at the 11th Moscow International Film Festival in 1979. Later, in 1998, Oleg Kovalov edited a free version of the film, calling it \"Mexican Fantasy\".", "Eisenstein confessed his asexuality to his close friend Marie Seton: \"Those who say that I am homosexual are wrong. I have never noticed and do not notice this. If I was homosexual I would say so, directly. But the whole point is that I have never experienced a homosexual attraction, even towards Grisha, despite the fact I have some bisexual tendency in the intellectual dimension like, for example, Balzac or Zola.\""]}, {"page": "Battleship Potemkin", "response": ["* Marie Seton (1960).

Marie Seton describes how the film intersperses the depiction of poverty and the delights and pleasures of youth. She represents the bond between Durga and Indir, and their fate, as signifying a philosophical core: that both the young and the old die. Seton writes of the film's \"lyrical\" qualities, noting especially the imagery immediately before the onset of monsoon. Robinson writes about a peculiar quality of \"lyrical happiness\" in the film, and states that Pather Panchali is \"about unsophisticated people shot through with great sophistication, and without a trace of condescension or inflated sentiment\"."]}, {"page": "Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne", "response": ["Around 1967, Ray started toying with the idea of creating a film based on extra terrestrial creatures on earth, and wrote a screenplay to that effect. Marlon Brando and Peter Sellers were supposed to star in lead roles in the movie. However, things did not turn out well between him and Columbia Pictures, and the project was shelved. Unable to make a fantasy movie in Hollywood, Ray decided to make one in India instead. He intended to reach a wider audience with this movie, prompted in part by the lukewarm box office performance of his previous movies Kapurush, Mahapurush and Nayak. R.D Bansal, who had produced those movies, became even less enthusiastic when he learnt of the film's estimated budget, and, as Ray told Marie Seton in December 1967, he spent the remainder of 1967 scouting for finance, and almost reduced to the same situation as he had been during shooting Pather Panchali. Finally, towards the end of 1967, Nepal Dutta and Asim Dutta of Purnima Pictures agreed to lend some financial help. But since it was not substantial enough to shoot the entire movie in color, Ray decided to do it in black and white and show only the final scene in color.", "Critical response was generally positive, with the length and special effects being the main points of criticism. Dennis Schwartz wrote that \"Its only fault is that I thought it was too lengthy to hold the attention of children. But the appealing film dazzles with Ray's lively score that's carried out very well by the film's stars.\" Lindsay Anderson said that it had got lovely things in it, but it went on for too long. A critic, writing for The Guardian, said that this was \"Satyajit Ray at his least convincing\". The Observer wrote that \"perhaps it would appeal to singularly unfidgety children\". The Times observed, \"Ray is a true poet of the cinema, but he finds his poetry in everyday reality; in all-out fantasy, he seems somewhat prosaic\". It was, however, a smash hit at home. Ray later wrote to Marie Seton, \"It is extraordinary how quickly it has become part of popular culture. Really there isn't a single child who doesn't know and sing the songs\"."]}, {"page": "Seton (surname)", "response": ["* Marie Seton (1910\u20131985), film critic and biographer"]}, {"page": "Two (1964 film)", "response": ["Satyajit Ray mentioned about Two and its timing in his biography Portrait of a Director: Satyajit Ray by Marie Seton that he considered that the film \"packs quite a punch in its ten (actually 15) minutes\". The film had its first public screening at Academy of Fine Arts, Kolkata. On 19 January 2008, a week-long exhibition \"Art of Ray: A Ray Society Exhibition\" was inaugurated by then Governor of West Bengal, Gopalkrishna Gandhi and showcased Two. At \"Ray Festival 2009\", Satyajit Ray Society screened Two along with other three Ray documentaries, namely Rabindranath Tagore, The Inner Eye and Sukumar Ray on 7 May 2009.
