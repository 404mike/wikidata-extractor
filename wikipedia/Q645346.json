Hudson's success was built on dubious financial practices and he frequently paid shareholders out of capital rather than money the company had earned.\nEventually in 1849, a series of enquiries, launched by the railways he was chairman of, exposed his methods, although many leading the enquiries had benefited and approved of Hudson's methods when it suited them. Hudson fell a long way, becoming bankrupt, and after losing his Sunderland seat he was forced to live abroad to avoid arrest for debt, returning only when imprisonment for debt was abolished in 1870.\nHudson's name is associated with financial wrongdoing, although others were at least partially guilty of similar practices.

A rebuild of the station was authorised in 1870 by the North Eastern Railway, but this was not carried out until 1902; the line from Leeds was quadrupled at this time and the station re-sited slightly east of its original position.  In its rebuilt form, platforms were only provided on the outside (slow) lines, along with a ticket office at street level, substantial canopies and waiting rooms on each side.  A new goods yard was also built alongside the eastbound platform."]}, {"page": "South Milford railway station", "response": ["The station was opened in 1834 as Milford railway station on the Leeds and Selby Railway.

As such, between 1848 and 1850, no railway traffic moved west of Milford, and even by 1850, this was restarted as only local traffic. During the early years of operation at Milford, the platforms at the station were known to be causing problems for passengers as they were only  above the level of the rail lines."]}, {"page": "Leeds and Bradford Railway", "response": ["At last in 1843 they succeeded in forming the Leeds and Bradford Railway company, with George Hudson (known as the 'railway king') as chairman.
