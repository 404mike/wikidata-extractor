Hudson's success was built on dubious financial practices and he frequently paid shareholders out of capital rather than money the company had earned.\nEventually in 1849, a series of enquiries, launched by the railways he was chairman of, exposed his methods, although many leading the enquiries had benefited and approved of Hudson's methods when it suited them. Hudson fell a long way, becoming bankrupt, and after losing his Sunderland seat he was forced to live abroad to avoid arrest for debt, returning only when imprisonment for debt was abolished in 1870.\nHudson's name is associated with financial wrongdoing, although others were at least partially guilty of similar practices.  He never named any of his co-conspirators, although many of them turned their backs on him when the bubble burst.", "link_mentions": {}}}
