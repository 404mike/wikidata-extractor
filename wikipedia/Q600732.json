Steve Bruce succeeded Jackson in May 1999. Huddersfield topped the table in December, but their form plummeted after striker Marcus Stewart was sold in the January transfer window to First Division rivals Ipswich Town. They finished the season in eighth place, just outside the play-offs. Bruce was sacked in October 2000. Rubery accused Bruce of \"wasting \u00a33m\", arguing that the money would have been \"spent more wisely by a more experienced manager without an ego to feed\". He was replaced by Lou Macari, who was unable to halt the slide as relegation to the third tier followed at the end of the season.

The individual prices were not made clear by Sunderland, although a figure of \u00a38.2 million for Flo was widely quoted by the media. Sunderland have since confirmed that he was bought for \u00a36.75 million, making him Sunderland's second most expensive purchase. Sunderland's manager Peter Reid had been under-fire throughout pre-season for his failure to buy a big-name striker as a long-term replacement for the ageing Niall Quinn.

However Ipswich entered administration, and were forced to sell talent such as Marcus Stewart, Titus Bramble, and Darren Ambrose; a relegation battle was only avoided after manager George Burley was replaced by Joe Royle. Ipswich then found another striking talent, Darren Bent (no relation), and Bent joined newly promoted Premier League side Leicester City on loan for the 2003\u201304 campaign, in a move that reunited him with manager Micky Adams.
