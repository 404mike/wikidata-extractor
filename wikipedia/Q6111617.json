Szeto Wah was actively involved in the opposition campaign and the founding of the Hong Kong Professional Teachers' Union (HKPTU) in 1972 as the founding vice-chairman under Tsin Sai-nin. In April 1973, Szeto Wah took a leading role in two waves of labour strikes. After the strikes, the teachers negotiated with government representative Jack Cater with Bishop Francis Hsu as the mediator. As a result, the teachers cancelled the third labour strike and began the negotiation process with the government. The government eventually backed down on the plan, but installed a \"3-2-2\" standard which raised the salaries of the certificated masters after their salary points had reached the highest levels in three, two and two years."]}, {"page": "Michael David Irving Gass", "response": ["From then until his retirement in 1973 he remained in the Far East, notably in Hong Kong where he was Colonial Secretary and Acting Governor intermittently between 1965 and 1969. In the colonial secretary's tenure, he and Ronald Holmes and Jack Cater and other government officials had to deal with riots in 1967 against British colonial rule. During the disorder, Governor Sir David Trench happened to be absent from Hong Kong and all of a sudden there was no one fully in command of the government. As a result, Gass became acting-Governor, and therefore it was Holmes and Gass who were in charge in the crisis.  During the riots, he took a tough stance against the activists, to effectively control the situation, but has also become one of the main targets of attack leftist camp vocal opposition."]}, {"page": "Secretary for Security", "response": ["| align=center| 6 || 80px || Jack Cater\u59ec\u9054 || 9 February 1967 || 21 May 1967 || "]}, {"page": "Secretary for Home Affairs", "response": ["| align=center| 3 || 80px || Jack Cater\u59ec\u9054 || 3 June 1973 || 14 November 1973 || "]}, {"page": "Commissioner of the Independent Commission Against Corruption", "response": ["| Sir Jack Cater || 15 February 1974 || 3 July 1978"]}, {"page": "Commissioner of Customs and Excise", "response": ["* Jack Cater (1970\u20131972)"]}, {"page": "Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department", "response": ["* Jack Cater (1964-1965)"]}, {"page": "Jack Carter", "response": ["* Jack Cater (1922\u20132006), Chief Secretary of Hong Kong"]}, {"page": "Sir George Monoux College", "response": ["* Sir Jack Cater CBE, Chief Secretary of Hong Kong from 1978\u201381"]}, {"page": "Cater", "response": ["*Jack Cater (1922\u20132002), Chief Secretary of Hong Kong"]}]}}
