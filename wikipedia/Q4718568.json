He was the editor of the conservative Spectator magazine from 1975 to 1984. During his editorship the magazine was saved from extinction and transformed into the most influential political weekly in the country.  In 1986, after a spell as deputy editor of The Sunday Telegraph, Chancellor became the first Washington correspondent of the newly-launched quality broadsheet, The Independent, and subsequently launched and edited the paper's first Saturday magazine.  In 1993 Chancellor spent a year in the United States working as an editor at The New Yorker magazine, where he oversaw the \"Talk of the Town\" section. Some thought him \"bumbling\" and a \"laughing stock\", imparting a \"skepticism so dry and genial it apparently went unnoticed.\" This experience was the basis of a brilliant memoir, Some Times in America, which both satirised the ordeal and recorded his deep affection for New York and the United States. It was published in both the UK and the U.S. in 2000. In June 2014 he became editor of The Oldie magazine in succession to Richard Ingrams. Until January 2012, he contributed a weekly column in The Guardian, published in the \"Weekend\" supplement each Saturday. In March 2012, he began to contribute to The Spectator again, with a column entitled \"Long Life\".Chancellor lived in Northamptonshire. He was the father of British model Cecilia Chancellor, and Eliza, who married the writer Alexander Waugh. He was the grandson of Sir John Chancellor, the first Governor of Southern Rhodesia.He was the uncle of British actress Anna Chancellor.\nHe was appointed a CBE in the 2012 Birthday Honours for services to journalism.Alexander Chancellor died on 28 January 2017, aged 77.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "January 28", "response": ["*2017 \u2013 Alexander Chancellor, British journalist (b. 1940)"]}, {"page": "The Spectator", "response": ["===Henry Keswick and Alexander Chancellor===", "Keswick gave the job of editor to \"the only journalist he knew\", Alexander Chancellor, an old family friend and his mother's godson, with whom he had been at Eton and Cambridge.

They quickly become stale and dated, and one sometimes wonders what the point of them is except to deceive journalists into thinking that their ephemeral scribblings deserve some permanence.
