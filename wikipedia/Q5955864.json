Guy Rickards considers McCabe's early works to have been overlooked because he was perceived as a pianist rather than a composer. One of his early successes was the orchestral song cycle Notturni ed Alba (1970), based on a set of poems in medieval Latin about the theme of night, which was described as \"an intoxicating creation, full of tingling atmosphere and slumbering passion\". His Concerto for Orchestra (1982) brought him international recognition, but it was not until the 1990s that he came to be viewed primarily as a composer, with the successes of the piano work Tenebrae (1992\u201393), which marked the deaths in 1992 of musicians Sir Charles Groves, William Mathias and Stephen Oliver, and was written for Barry Douglas; his Fourth Symphony, Of Time and the River (1993\u201394); and his third ballet Edward II (1995), which won the 1998 Barclays Theatre Award."]}, {"page": "B.

This prevented him from playing at the Bechstein (now Wigmore) Hall when it first opened.  (). He is particularly known for winning in 1928 the Columbia Gramophone Company competition to write the remaining movements (scherzo and finale) of Schubert's 8th Symphony. His composition was recorded by Columbia and sold, although these recordings are primarily, if not all, on 12-inch records and now very rare. Several later LP recordings of Frank Merrick playing various works by John Field and other British composers were released on the British label Rare Recorded Editions and are also rare. A \"Frank Merrick Society\" was formed to release his recordings. His book, Practising the Piano, first published by Barrie and Jenkins in 1960, has gone through at least four printings. His many pupils include the composer Michael Garrett and the pianist and teacher Stephen Gosney."]}, {"page": "Thomas B.
