It featured several soul, funk, and R&B-stylised songs; most notably the No.\u00a01 hit \"Town Called Malice\", which boasts a Motown-style bassline somewhat reminiscent of The Supremes' \"You Can't Hurry Love\". The song included work by Keith Thomas and Steve Nichol, who later became well known as members of the R&B groups Legacy and Loose Ends respectively. \"Town Called Malice\", a reality-based tale about dealing with hardship in a small, downtrodden English town, is one of a handful of Jam songs Weller still performs (along with \"That's Entertainment\", \"Man in the Corner Shop\", \"Strange Town\", \"Art School\", \"Start!\" and \"In the Crowd\"). When \"Town Called Malice\" reached number one the group had the honour of performing both it and its double A-side, \"Precious\" on Top of the Pops \u2013 the only other band to be accorded this honour being the Beatles. After the string-laden soul ballad \"The Bitterest Pill (I Ever Had to Swallow)\" peaked at No.\u00a02, the band followed with their finale and another No.\u00a01, \"Beat Surrender\". The latter featured Tracie Young on vocals; a few months later, she also guested on The Style Council's debut single \"Speak Like a Child\".", "* Keith Thomas \u2013 saxophone, soprano sax"]}, {"page": "True Confessions (album)", "response": ["* Keith Thomas \u2013 saxophone "]}, {"page": "The Gift (The Jam album)", "response": ["* Keith Thomas - saxophone"]}, {"page": "Beat Surrender", "response": ["*Keith Thomas \u2013 saxophone"]}, {"page": "A Trick of the Night", "response": ["*Keith Thomas \u2013 sax"]}, {"page": "Keith Thomas", "response": ["Keith Thomas may refer to:", "*Keith Thomas (footballer, born 1961) (born 1961), Australian rules footballer", "*Keith Thomas (footballer, born 1929) (1929\u20132017), Australian rules footballer", "*Keith Thomas (English footballer) (1929\u20132021), English footballer", "*Keith Thomas (historian) (born 1933), Welsh historian", "*Keith Thomas (record producer), US record producer and songwriter", "*Keith Thomas (saxophonist), British saxophonist, writer and producer", "*Keith Thomas (sailor) (born 1956), sailor who competed for the British Virgin Islands", "*Keith Thomas (director), wrote and directed the 2019 film The Vigil"]}, {"page": "Thomas (surname)", "response": ["*Keith Thomas (disambiguation), multiple people", "**Keith Thomas (historian) (born 1933), Welsh historian", "**Keith Thomas (producer), American Grammy Award-winning producer and songwriter", "**Keith Thomas (saxophonist), English saxophonist, writer and producer"]}]}}
