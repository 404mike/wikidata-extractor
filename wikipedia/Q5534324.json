In June 2005, Geoff Southern was elected as party leader. Some members, including Senator Paul Le Claire feared that under Southern the JDA would move too far to the left, and formed the Centre Party. At the JDA's inaugural annual general meeting in July 2005, Southern said that \"the party would continue to maintain the centre ground of politics despite claims from a breakaway group that the alliance had moved to the left under his leadership\". The JDA launched its manifesto to a crowd of 150 people in People's Park in September 2005.

He said he would \"continue to assist people who ask me to help them fill in the form \u2026 I am among those who may well be prosecuted under the bureaucratic nonsense of a piece of law\" and she said \"\u2026 if this [the prohibition created by Article 39A] goes through as law I will ignore it and continue with collecting these postal votes\". On 20 February 2009, Pitman and Southern pleaded guilty in Magistrate's Court to breaking the law \"by assisting about 70 elderly, infirm or busy people to complete a postal vote application form in the election and/or delivering their completed forms\" and they were committed to the Royal Court for sentencing.;  In mitigation their advocate submitted that the law infringed the human rights of the disabled and infirm to take part in the electoral process and the debate on Article 39A in the States had been flawed.
