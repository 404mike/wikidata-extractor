Tommy Griffiths scored Wales' goal in a 1\u20131 draw with France at the Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir. Buoyed by their championship victory, the Welsh team began their title defense in the 1933\u201334 British Home Championship by securing a 3\u20132 victory over Scotland in front of 40,000 fans at Ninian Park. A draw with Ireland in Belfast meant Wales required a victory over England to guarantee consecutive titles. The match was played at St James' Park in Newcastle with Wales taking an early lead through Tommy Mills. The tension of the match was so intense Mills nearly failed to return for the second half having been sick during half-time. Eric Brook equalised for England in the second half but, with less than ten minutes remaining, Dai Astley scored a header to give Wales victory and win the Home Championship in consecutive years for the only time in the nation's history."]}, {"page": "Thomas Mills", "response": ["* Tommy Mills (1883\u20131944), American football player, coach, and college athletics administrator", "* Tommy Mills (footballer) (1911\u2013?), Welsh footballer"]}]}}
