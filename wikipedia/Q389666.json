It was through this book that Hutton's principle of uniformitarianism, later taken up by Charles Lyell, first reached a wide audience. Playfair's textbook Elements of Geometry made a brief expression of Euclid's parallel postulate known now as Playfair's axiom.\nIn 1783 he was a co-founder of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.

In 1816 he was a candidate for a teaching job at Haileybury College; he had recommendations from James Ivory and John Playfair, but lost out to Henry Walter.

He was a close friend of Charles Darwin, and contributed significantly to Darwin's thinking on the processes involved in evolution. As Darwin wrote in On the Origin of Species, \"He who can read Sir Charles Lyell's grand work on the Principles of Geology, which the future historian will recognise as having produced a revolution in natural science, yet does not admit how incomprehensibly vast have been the past periods of time, may at once close this volume.\" Lyell helped to arrange the simultaneous publication in 1858 of papers by Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace on natural selection, despite his personal religious qualms about the theory. He later published evidence from geology of the time man had existed on the earth.", "From 1830 to 1833 his multi-volume Principles of Geology was published. The work's subtitle was \"An attempt to explain the former changes of the earth's surface by reference to causes now in operation\", and this explains Lyell's impact on science. He drew his explanations from field studies conducted directly before he went to work on the founding geology text. He was, along with the earlier John Playfair, the major advocate of James Hutton's idea of uniformitarianism, that the earth was shaped entirely by slow-moving forces still in operation today, acting over a very long period of time. This was in contrast to catastrophism, an idea of abrupt geological changes, which had been adapted in England to explain landscape features\u2014such as rivers much smaller than their associated valleys\u2014that seemed impossible to explain other than through violent action.

In a 1753 letter he wrote that he had \"become very fond of studying the surface of the earth, and was looking with anxious curiosity into every pit or ditch or bed of a river that fell in his way\". Clearing and draining his farm provided ample opportunities. The mathematician John Playfair described Hutton as having noticed that \"a vast proportion of the present rocks are composed of materials afforded by the destruction of bodies, animal, vegetable and mineral, of more ancient formation\". His theoretical ideas began to come together in 1760. While his farming activities continued, in 1764 he went on a geological tour of the north of Scotland with George Maxwell-Clerk,, Playfair ancestor of the famous James Clerk Maxwell.", "He had a house built in 1770 at St John's Hill, Edinburgh, overlooking Salisbury Crags. This later became the Balfour family home and, in 1840, the birthplace of the psychiatrist James Crichton-Browne. Hutton was one of the most influential participants in the Scottish Enlightenment, and fell in with numerous first-class minds in the sciences including mathematician John Playfair, philosopher David Hume and economist Adam Smith. Hutton held no position in the University of Edinburgh  and communicated his scientific findings through the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He was particularly friendly with physician and chemist Joseph Black, and together with Adam Smith they founded the Oyster Club for weekly meetings.", "In the Spring of 1788 he set off with John Playfair to the Berwickshire coast and found more examples of this sequence in the valleys of the Tour and Pease Burns near Cockburnspath.

They found the sequence in the cliff below St. Helens, then just to the east at Siccar Point found what Hutton called \"a beautiful picture of this junction washed bare by the sea\". Playfair later commented about the experience, \"the mind seemed to grow giddy by looking so far into the abyss of time\". Continuing along the coast, they made more discoveries including sections of the vertical beds showing strong ripple marks which gave Hutton \"great satisfaction\" as a confirmation of his supposition that these beds had been laid horizontally in water. He also found conglomerate at altitudes that demonstrated the extent of erosion of the strata, and said of this that \"we never should have dreamed of meeting with what we now perceived\".", "It has been claimed that the prose of Principles of Knowledge was so obscure that it also impeded the acceptance of Hutton's geological theories.  Restatements of his geological ideas (though not his thoughts on evolution) by John Playfair in 1802 and then Charles Lyell in the 1830s popularised the concept of an infinitely repeating cycle, though Lyell tended to dismiss Hutton's views as giving too much credence to catastrophic changes.", "** John Playfair (1802), Illustrations of the Huttonian theory of the Earth", "** John Playfair (1815), Explication de Playfair sur la th\u00e9orie de la terre par Hutton (French)"]}, {"page": "Uniformitarianism", "response": ["In geology, uniformitarianism has included the gradualistic concept that \"the present is the key to the past\" and that geological events occur at the same rate now as they have always done, though many modern geologists no longer hold to a strict gradualism.FARIA, Felipe.
