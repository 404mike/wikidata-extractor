Charles Darwin's name does not appear on the rolls of the Lodge but it is very possible that he, like Francis, was a Mason, as he held many Masonic beliefs such as Deism throughout his life.", "Darwin's most important scientific work, Zoonomia (1794\u20131796), contains a system of pathology and a chapter on 'Generation'. In the latter, he anticipated some of the views of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, which foreshadowed the modern theory of evolution. Erasmus Darwin's works were read and commented on by his grandson Charles Darwin the naturalist. Erasmus Darwin based his theories on David Hartley's psychological theory of associationism.Allen, Richard C. 1999. David Hartley on human nature. Albany, N.Y.: SUNY Press.  The essence of his views is contained in the following passage, which he follows up with the conclusion that one and the same kind of living filament is and has been the cause of all organic life:", "Erasmus Darwin also anticipated survival of the fittest in Zo\u00f6nomia mainly when writing about the \"three great objects of desire\" for every organism: \"lust, hunger, and security.\" A similar \"survival of the fittest\" view in Zo\u00f6nomia is Erasmus' view on how a species \"should\" propagate itself. Erasmus' idea that \"the strongest and most active animal should propagate the species, which should thence become improved\". Today, this is called the theory of survival of the fittest.  His grandson Charles Darwin, much less libidinous and who led more of an invalid life, and who is not known to have illegitimately fathered children, or fathered children he did not plan, acknowledge and raise, posited the different and fuller theory of natural selection. Charles' theory was that natural selection is the inheritance of changed genetic characteristics that are better adaptations to the environment; these are not necessarily based in \"strength\" and \"activity\", which themselves ironically can lead to the overpopulation that results in natural selection yielding nonsurvivors of genetic traits.", "* A horizontal windmill, which he designed for Josiah Wedgwood (who would be Charles Darwin's other grandfather, see family tree below).", "* Darwin's opposition to slavery in poetry was included by Benjamin Zephaniah in a reading.

There is no mention of a Mother Hutton in Withering's works or anyone else's and no mention of him meeting any old woman directly. In his account he states that he is merely asked to comment on a family recipe that was originally an old woman's receipt or recipe (that she had long kept secret) by a colleague. Since 1928, Mother Hutton's status has grown from being an image in an advertising poster to an acclaimed wise woman, herbalist, pharmacist and medical practitioner in Shropshire who was cheated out of her true recognition by Dr. Withering's unscrupulous methods. The story often written around this is also totally apocryphal.  Withering was in fact informed of the Brasenose College, Oxford case by one of his medical colleagues Dr. Ash at Birmingham Hospital and the Dean was treated with digitalis root not leaves. The myth of Mother Hutton and how Withering chased her around Shropshire has been created by authors not going back to primary sources but instead copying and then embellishing the unreferenced work of others. See \"Withering and The Foxglove; the making of a myth\" by D.M. Krikler British Heart Journal 1985 54: 256-257. In Withering's Account of the Foxglove printed in 1785 Withering mentions seven different occasions when foxglove was brought to his attention. Recognising that foxglove was the active ingredient in a family recipe (that was long kept secret by an old woman in Shropshire) would not have been difficult with his expert botanical knowledge. Withering had first published his Botanical Arrangement in 1776 and in it suggested foxglove deserved looking at in more detail. Erasmus Darwin tried to take the credit for foxglove and failed. Erasmus Darwin then attempted to try and discredit Withering behind the scenes with the unwitting help of his son Robert having earlier used the thesis of his dead son Charles to try and establish priority. Charles Darwin in fact had been friendly with Withering (as had Robert) and had talked in Edinburgh University about Withering's experiments with foxglove. Erasmus Darwin was probably jealous that Withering had become the most famous and sought after doctor outside London and that Withering's English Botanical Arrangement became the standard reference source and far exceeded the botanical publications of Erasmus (all published semi-anonymously) in popularity. Withering's Botanical Arrangement, although now almost forgotten, became the standard reference for English Botany for almost the next 100 years."]}, {"page": "William Hyde Wollaston", "response": ["Wollaston's attempt to demonstrate the presence of glucose in the blood serum of diabetics was unsuccessful due to the limited means of detection available to him.

Wollaston supported this theory by referring to the thesis of a young medical student at Edinburgh, named Charles Darwin, titled, \"Experiments establishing a criterion between mucaginous and purulent matter.

Although Darwin changed his field of interest several times in these formative years, many of his later discoveries and beliefs were foreshadowed by the influences he had as a youth.", "Darwin's extended family of Darwins and Wedgwoods was strongly Unitarian. One of his grandfathers, Erasmus Darwin, was a successful physician, and was followed in this by his sons Charles Darwin, who died in 1778 while still a promising medical student at the University of Edinburgh, and Doctor Robert Waring Darwin, Darwin's father, who named his son Charles Robert Darwin, honouring his deceased brother.", "thumb|190px|left|The seven-year-old Charles Darwin in 1816, a year before the sudden loss of his mother.", "Charles Robert Darwin was born in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, England on 12 February 1809 at his family home, the Mount, He was the fifth of six children of wealthy society doctor and financier Robert Waring Darwin , and Susannah Darwin (n\u00e9e Wedgwood). Both families were largely Unitarian, though the Wedgwoods were adopting Anglicanism.

Darwin added that \"I am going to learn to stuff birds, from a blackamoor... he only charges one guinea, for an hour every day for two months\". These lessons in taxidermy were with the freed black slave John Edmonstone, who also lived in Lothian Street. Darwin often sat with him to hear tales of the South American rain-forest of Guyana, and later remembered him as \"a very pleasant and intelligent man.\"", "In October Charles returned on his own for his second year, and took smaller lodgings in a top flat at 21 Lothian Street. He joined the required classes of Practice of Physic and Midwifery, but by then realised he would inherit property and need not make \"any strenuous effort to learn medicine\". For his own interests, and to meet other students, he joined Robert Jameson's natural history course which started on 8 November. It was unique in Britain, covering a wide range of topics including geology, zoology, mineralogy, meteorology and botany.Ashworth, J.H. (1935) Charles Darwin as a student in Edinburgh, 1825-1827.

He went long walks with Grant and others, frequently with William Ainsworth, one of the Presidents who became a Wernerian geologist. As well as the shores of the Forth, he and Ainsworth took boat trips to Fife and the islands. On the Isle of May with the botanist Robert Kaye Greville, this \"eminent cryptogamist\" laughed so much at screeching seabirds that he had to \"lie down on the greensward to enjoy his prolonged cachinnation.\" On another trip, Darwin and Ainsworth got stuck overnight on Inchkeith and had to stay in the lighthouse.Bettany, G. T. (1887) Life of Charles Darwin. London: Walter Scott, pp. 22\u201323, also ", "Grant in his publication about the leech eggs in the Edinburgh Journal of Science for July 1827 acknowledged \"The merit of having first ascertained them to belong to that animal is due to my zealous young friend Mr Charles Darwin of Shrewsbury\", the first time Darwin's name appeared in print. Grant's lengthy memoir read before the Wernerian on 24 March was split between the April and October issues of the Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal, with more detail than Darwin had given: he had seen ova (larvae) of Flustra carbasea in February, after they swam about they stuck to the glass and began to form a new colony. He noted the similarity of the cilia in \"other ova\", with reference to his 1826 publication describing sponge ova. Darwin was not given credit for what he felt was his discovery, and in 1871, when he discussed  \"the paltry feeling\" of scientific priority with his daughter Henrietta, she got him to repeat the story of \"his first introduction to the jealousy of scientific men\"; when he had seen the ova of Flustra move he \"rushed instantly to Grant\" who, rather than being \"delighted with so curious a fact\", told Darwin \"it was very unfair of him to work at Prof G's subject & in fact that he shd take it ill if my Father published it.\" In European university practice, team leaders reported research without naming assistants, and clearly the find was derivative from Grant's research programme: it seems likely he had already seen the ova, like the sponge ova, moving by cilia. Grant phased announcement of discoveries rather than publishing quickly, and was now looking for a professorship before he ran out of funds, but young Darwin was disappointed. As Jameson noted in October, back in 1823 Dalyell had observed the Pontobdella young leaving their cocoons.", "Darwin left Edinburgh in late April, just 18 years old. In 1826 he had told his sister he would be \"forced to go abroad for one year\" of hospital studies, as he had to be 21 before taking his degree, but he was too upset by seeing blood or suffering, and had lost any ambition to be a doctor.

He classifies bodily and sensory motions as \"irritative,\" \"sensitive,\" \"voluntary,\" and \"associative.\" He presents theories on the production and classes of ideas, and seeks to explain  the causes and mechanisms of sleep, reverie, vertigo, and drunkenness. He then discusses anatomy, especially the operation of the circulatory system and various glands. Chapter 29, \"The Retrograde Motions of the Absorbent Vessels,\" is Erasmus Darwin's translation of his late son Charles Darwin's dissertation. These anatomical chapters are followed by four chapters on diseases, which draws on his classification of four types of motion to identify four types of diseases: those of irritation, of sensation, of volition, and of association. Two chapters, \"Of the Oxygenation of the Blood in the Lungs and Placenta\" and \"Of Generation\" develop his theories about human reproduction, including observations related to evolution.
