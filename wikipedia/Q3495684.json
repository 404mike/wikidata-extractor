As an academic, he taught at the Universities of St Andrews, Lancaster, Oxford and Prague.\nHe also worked for The Economist magazine and Amnesty International. In particular, Zeman was responsible for organising the translation into English of A Chronicle of Current Events, the samizdat periodical that documented human rights violations in the USSR from 1968 to 1982.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Propaganda", "response": ["Propaganda is sometimes evaluated based on the intention and goals of the individual or institution who created it. According to historian Zbyn\u011bk Zeman, propaganda is defined as either white, grey or black. White propaganda openly discloses its source and intent. Grey propaganda has an ambiguous or non-disclosed source or intent. Black propaganda purports to be published by the enemy or some organization besides its actual origins (compare with black operation, a type of clandestine operation in which the identity of the sponsoring government is hidden). In scale, these different types of propaganda can also be defined by the potential of true and correct information to compete with the propaganda. For example, opposition to white propaganda is often readily found and may slightly discredit the propaganda source. Opposition to grey propaganda, when revealed (often by an inside source), may create some level of public outcry. Opposition to black propaganda is often unavailable and may be dangerous to reveal, because public cognizance of black propaganda tactics and sources would undermine or backfire the very campaign the black propagandist supported."]}, {"page": "History of Poland (1918\u20131939)", "response": ["France was an ally of both Poland and Czechoslovakia and tried repeatedly to get them to resolve their border disputes and become allies, and also collaborate with the Soviet Union.
