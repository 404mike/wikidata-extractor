Recognizing that \"two beautiful women at the same time are always a difficulty\", Koehler \"at once\" made the \"dreadful decision\" and between Lady Emma Margery Thynne (1893\u20131980) and Lady Alice Kathleen Violet Thynne (1891\u20131977), chose Emma as the object of his pursuit. The following day, Koehler, was scheduled to go to Maiden Bradley to hunt with Sir Edward Seymour, 16th Duke of Somerset. He devised a scheme with the cooperation of his hostess, Lady Paget. Returning from the hunting trip, they would have a tire \"puncture\" in front of Longleat, the ancestral home of the Marquess of Bath. The enterprising Koehler would present himself at the door and further sojourn with Emma would be his. Koehler showed Balfour and the duke the note of his plan he had scribbled to Lady Paget. They \"roared\" and asked Koehler what he was going to do about it. \"Get them of course\", was the response to more laughter. The duke and Koehler made a wager, his gun for the duke's greatcoat, that Koehler would not succeed. Koehler executed his plan, and \"lifting the enormous knocker, [to] beat a bold tattoo on a door about the size of the gates of St. Peter's,\" he was ushered into Longleat. Only then did he discover that while he was hunting, Emma had sent word to Cranmore inviting him to spend the weekend at Longleat, and so his suitcase had been packed and put in his car unbeknownst to him. \"At any rate I have the duke's greatcoat. Since then all my weekends save one, when I went back to the old duke, have been spent at Longleat\".Capelotti, pp. 34-36"]}, {"page": "Mary Seymour, Duchess of Somerset", "response": ["*Very Reverend Lord Francis Seymour (1726\u20131799), Dean of Wells Cathedral, who married Catherine Payne and had children; he was the ancestor of Edward Seymour, 16th Duke of Somerset, and of Colonel Henry Abel Smith.
