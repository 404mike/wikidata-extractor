An off-spinner, Such was brought into the Test arena in 1993 as a replacement for John Emburey but, despite taking 6 for 67 on debut and being the highest wicket taker for England in the series  only played an initial eight Tests before having to wait 5 years before his next appearance.\nSuch enjoyed a 19-year first-class career including stints at Nottinghamshire and Leicestershire before joining Essex in 1990. It was at Essex where he gained most success although he is perhaps best remembered for hitting the winning boundary in the second day of a Natwest Trophy semi final against Glamorgan in 1997 when play had been suspended the day before due to bad light with Mark Ilott and Robert Croft having an on field confrontation seen on BBC television.  Although not noted for his batting, in 1999, playing in his final Test at Old Trafford, he made the second-longest duck in Test history, from 52 balls, against New Zealand, and earned a standing ovation.Such joined the ECB in 2009, going full-time in 2012, to work with bowlers throughout the England Performance Pathway as the National Lead Spin Bowling Coach. After leaving the role in November 2019 Such became a match referee ahead of the 2020 County Championship season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "June 12", "response": ["*  1964   \u2013 Peter Such, Scottish-born, English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Helensburgh", "response": ["*Peter Such, Test cricketer"]}, {"page": "Essex County Cricket Club", "response": ["In the 1990s, Essex had more internationals, including Nasser Hussain, who captained England in several series.

In contrast, Australia picked three fast bowlers, with the inexperienced Warne as the only spinner. Warne had played in 11 Test matches up to that point, and taken 31 wickets at a moderate average of 30.80 runs per wicket.  Although showing some promise, Warne's early career had been less than spectacular and his style of bowling \u2014 leg spin \u2014 was seen by many cricket followers as an antiquated art with little value in the modern game.  Pace bowling had dominated the game since the legendary West Indian pace bowlers of the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. New Zealand's captain and leading batsman, Martin Crowe, had praised Warne before the series, but Wisden notes that Crowe's proclamation was widely dismissed as excusing New Zealand's frailties rather than genuinely endorsing Warne."]}, {"page": "National Cricket Performance Centre", "response": ["*ECB Spin-Bowling Programme Lead: Peter Such"]}, {"page": "Australian cricket team in England in 1993", "response": ["* Peter Such", "Four players debuted in the First Test: Andy Caddick and Peter Such for England and Brendon Julian and Michael Slater for the tourists.

In contrast to previous captain Graham Gooch, Atherton adopted a more relaxed approach to touring, allowing players time off rather than continual practicing, though perhaps Chris Lewis's decision to get his head shaved on a day off was a mistake \u2013 he spent a full day recovering from the subsequent sun-stroke.Martin Johnson's column in The Independent between the first two warm-up games, accessed from Cricinfo.com on 16 March 2007"]}, {"page": "James Boiling", "response": ["After a successful 1992 season, in which he took 45 first-class wickets including match figures of 10 for 203 against Gloucestershire, Boiling toured with the England A team to Australia.

He was unlucky to have his toe broken whilst batting at the MCG against an Australian Academy XI, which effectively ended his chances of international selection. However, Boiling enjoyed a successful one-day season in 1993, taking 25 wickets in the 50 over AXA League and in 1994 helped to propel Surrey to the semi-finals of both the NatWest trophy and Benson and Hedges Cup.
