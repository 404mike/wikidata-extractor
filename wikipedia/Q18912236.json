Frank Evers Bed was appointed prosector. The official expedition artist was John James Wild. As well as Nares and Maclear, others that were part of the naval crew included Pelham Aldrich, George Granville Campbell, and Andrew Francis Balfour (one of the sons of Scottish botanist John Hutton Balfour). Also among the officers was Thomas Henry Tizard, who had carried out important hydrographic observations on previous voyages. Though he was not among the civilian scientific staff, Tizard would later help write the official account of the expedition, and also become a Fellow of the Royal Society.", "Sir Thomson believed, as did many adherents of the then-recent theory of evolution, that the deep sea would be home to \"living fossils\" long extinct in shallower waters, examples of \"missing links\". They believed that the conditions of constant cold temperature, darkness, and lack of currents, waves, or seismic events provided such a stable environment that evolution would slow or stop entirely. Louis Agassiz believed that in the deeps \"we should expect to find representatives of earlier geological periods.\" Thomas Huxley stated that he expected to see \"zoological antiquities which in the tranquil and little changed depths of the ocean have escaped the causes of destruction at work in the shallows and represent the predominant population of a past age.\" Nothing of the sort came to pass, however; though a few organisms previously regarded as extinct were found and cataloged among the many new discoveries, the harvest was typical of what might be found in exploring any equivalent extent of new territory. Furthermore, in the process of preserving specimens in alcohol, chemist John Young Buchanan and Sir Thomson realized that he had inadvertently debunked Huxley's prior report of Bathybius haeckelii, an acellular protoplasm covering the sea bottoms, which was purported to be the link between non-living matter and living cells. The net effect was a setback for the proponents of evolution."]}, {"page": "Dean Cemetery", "response": ["* John Young Buchanan FRS FRSE (1844\u20131925) oceanographer"]}, {"page": "Bathybius haeckelii", "response": ["In 1872 the Challenger expedition began; it spent three years studying the oceans. The expedition also took soundings at 361 ocean stations. They did not find any sign of Bathybius, despite the claim that it was a nearly universal substance. In 1875 ship's chemist John Young Buchanan analyzed a substance that looked like Bathybius from an earlier collected sample. He noticed that it was a precipitate of calcium sulfate from the seawater that had reacted with the preservative liquid (alcohol), forming a gelatinous ooze which clung to particles as if ingesting them. Buchanan suspected that all the Bathybius samples had been prepared the same way and notified Sir Charles Thomson, now the leader of the expedition. Thomson sent a polite letter to Huxley and told about the discovery."]}, {"page": "HMS Challenger (1858)", "response": ["* Oceanographers: John Young Buchanan (1844\u20131925) and John Murray (1841\u20131914)"]}, {"page": "Keith Medal", "response": ["*1885\u201387: John Young Buchanan, for a series of communications, extending over several years, on subjects connected with Ocean Circulation, Compressibility of Glass, etc."]}, {"page": "John Buchanan", "response": ["*John Young Buchanan (1844\u20131925), Scottish chemist, oceanographer and Arctic explorer"]}, {"page": "Thomas Buchanan (Liberal politician)", "response": ["He was born in Glasgow the son of John Buchanan of Dowanhill.
