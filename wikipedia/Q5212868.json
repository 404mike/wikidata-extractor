He often proves to be naturally talented at most things he tries, but his attempts at being successful are usually scuppered quite quickly. He is jealous of his seldom seen brother Michael. It is stated by Ma on multiple occasions that Cal came \"really close\" to getting married until Da ruined, but the details keep changing.
