It infects fish-eating mammals, including humans. In humans, it infects the common bile duct and gall bladder, feeding on bile. It was discovered by British physician James McConnell at the Medical College Hospital in Calcutta (Kolkata) in 1874. The first description was given by Thomas Spencer Cobbold, who named it Distoma sinense. The fluke passes its lifecycle in three different hosts, namely freshwater snail as first intermediate hosts, freshwater fish as second intermediate host, and mammals as definitive hosts.", "The formal scientific description was published in 1875 by Thomas Spencer Cobbold, who named it Distoma sinense. In 1876, Rudolf Leuckart named it Distomum spithulatum. Kenso Ishisaka recorded the first case of clonorchiasis in Japan in 1877. McConnell identified another infection in a Chinese cook from Hong Kong in 1878. Erwin von Baelz reported the presence of similar flukes from an autopsy of a Japanese patient at Tokyo University in 1883. He recorded two different forms, naming the smaller, more pathogenic form as Distoma hepatis endemicum sive perniciosum, and the larger, less pathogenic form as D.h.e.s. innocuum. Isao Ijima correctly redescribed them as the same species, but still wrongly renamed it Distoma endemicum in 1886. When a new genus Opisthorchis was created by \u00c9mile Blanchard in 1895, Cobbold's species name D. sinense was moved to the new genus because of close similarities with the other members. Further analyses by Arthur Looss, though,  showed significant differences from the general features of Opisthorchis, particularly on the highly branched testes. He created a new genus Clonorchis (from Greek klon meaning \"twig/branch\", orkhis meaning \"testis\") in 1907. Similar to Baelz, he differentiated the larger species as Clonorchis sinensis, which is mostly found in China, and the smaller species as C. endemicum, found mostly in Japan. In 1912, Harujiro Kobayashi corrected the classification that the differences in sizes were due to the nature of the host and intensity of infection, and had nothing to do with the biology. Hence, he supported only C. sinensis. Kobayashi was also the first to discover fish as the second intermediate host in 1911. Masatomo Muto discovered snails as the first intermediate host in 1918."]}, {"page": "Fasciola gigantica", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Thomas Spencer Cobbold"]}, {"page": "List of authors of names published under the ICZN", "response": ["* Cobbold \u2013 Thomas Spencer Cobbold (1828\u20131886)"]}, {"page": "List of Old Carthusians", "response": ["*Thomas Spencer Cobbold (1828\u20131886), first Professor of Helminthology, Royal Veterinary College, 1873\u20131886"]}, {"page": "Cobboldia", "response": ["The genus is named after Thomas Spencer Cobbold (1828 - 1886) who described the first species as Gastrophilus elephantis."]}, {"page": "Thomas Cobbold", "response": ["*Thomas Spencer Cobbold (1828\u20131886), English man of science"]}, {"page": "Echinorhynchidae", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Thomas Spencer Cobbold"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society A, B, C", "response": ["| Thomas Spencer Cobbold||02/06/1864||26 May 1828 \u2013 20 March 1886"]}, {"page": "Quekett Microscopical Club", "response": ["Several eminent scientists have been presidents of the Club, including Edwin Lankester (1865\u201366), Peter le Neve Foster (1869), Lionel Smith Beale (1870\u201371), Robert Braithwaite (bryologist) (1872\u20131873), Henry Lee (1875\u201377), Thomas Henry Huxley (1877\u201379), Thomas Spencer Cobbold (1879\u201380), Mordecai Cubitt Cooke (1881\u201383), William Benjamin Carpenter (1883\u201385), William Dallinger (1889\u201392), George Edward Massee (1899-1903), Edward Alfred Minchin (1908-1912) Arthur Dendy (1912\u201316), Alfred Barton Rendle (1916\u201321), Sir David Prain (1924\u201326), William Thomas Calman (1926\u201328), John Ramsbottom (1928\u201331) and Hamilton Hartridge (1951\u201354)."]}, {"page": "Metorchis conjunctus", "response": ["This species was discovered and described by Thomas Spencer Cobbold in 1860.", "Category:Taxa named by Thomas Spencer Cobbold"]}, {"page": "Heterophyes", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by Thomas Spencer Cobbold"]}, {"page": "Brugia", "response": ["The first species discovered was B. malayi. It was reported by a Dutch parasitologist Steffen Lambert Brug in 1927 from Southeast Asia (Malaya, for which the name was given). It was originally believed to be similar or closely related to another filarial roundworm then named Microfilaria bancrofti (now Wuchereria bancrofti), described by an English naturalist Thomas Spencer Cobbold in 1877. It was for this reason that Brug gave the original name Microfilaria (Filaria) malayi. Brug was aware of the difference mainly on the basis of their occurrence. He found both the worms in Sumatra, Java, Borneo, and Celebes; but in New Guinea only W. bancrofti was present, but not the new species. They are so similar that even after a decade of research, there were still arguments of B. malayi as a separate and valid species. As such S. Sundar Rao and P.A. Maplestone assigned the name Wuchereria malayi in 1940. The scientific name was retained for two decades."]}]}}
