Holland kept up his impressive record of playing every game over the course of the season. He scored 10 goals in the league as Ipswich once again finished 3rd in the First Division, narrowly missing out on an automatic promotion place on the final day of the season. This meant Ipswich had qualified for the play-offs for the fourth season in a row. Holland started both legs of the semi-finals. The first leg of the semi-finals saw Ipswich come from 0\u20132 down to draw 2\u20132 away at Bolton, with Marcus Stewart scoring a brace. Ipswich won the second leg 5\u20133 at Portman Road, in a match that also saw two Bolton Wanderers players red carded, with goals from Jamie Clapham, Martijn Reuser and a Jim Magilton Hat-trick. Ipswich progressed to the play-offs final following a 7\u20135 aggregate win over Bolton Wanderers. Holland started in and captained Ipswich in the final on 29 May 2000 against Barnsley at Wembley Stadium.

The club's league form was poor, and 18 games into the campaign, Ipswich were bottom of the table with just one league victory. However, there was some relief in the UEFA Cup with a victory over Inter Milan 1\u20130 at home in the third round, despite which the tie was lost over two legs after a 4\u20131 defeat at the San Siro. From bottom of the table at Christmas, a run of seven wins from eight fixtures appeared to have secured the team's league status, but another decline set in and relegation was confirmed on the final day of the season with a 5\u20130 defeat by Liverpool at Anfield. The loss of income due to relegation to the Championship contributed to the club going into financial administration, resulting in the sale of a number of players including Jamie Clapham, Darren Ambrose, and club captain Matt Holland. Ipswich had the consolation of again qualifying for the UEFA Cup, through UEFA's Fair Play system, losing in the second round to Czech side Slovan Liberec. A poor start to the domestic season, leaving the club 19th in the table by mid-October, resulted in George Burley being sacked after nearly eight years as manager."]}, {"page": "Loughborough University F.C.", "response": ["In 2021 former Leeds, Middlesbrough, Hull and Barnsley Assistant Manager and former Ipswich and Birmingham player Jamie Clapham was appointed as Mens Head Coach replacing Alex Ackerley who joined Sunderland FC to coach within their Academy set up."]}, {"page": "2007\u201308 Leeds United F.C. season", "response": ["* 8 October 2007: Manuel Rui Marques, Jamie Claphamhttp://www.football-league.premiumtv.co.uk/staticFiles/ca/99/0,,10794~104906,00.pdf"]}, {"page": "2005\u201306 Manchester United F.C. season", "response": ["United's away game with Birmingham City was their third successive game against West Midlands opposition.
