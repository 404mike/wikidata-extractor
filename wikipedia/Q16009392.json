This proved vital as Worcestershire ran out winners by 25 runs.\nSmith's highest score of 70 had come earlier in his career, against Nottinghamshire at Amblecote in June 1923, but on that occasion his efforts had not affected the result of this game, with Worcestershire falling to a heavy defeat.Smith was born in Ledbury, Herefordshire and died in the same town at the age of 85.", "link_mentions": {}}}
