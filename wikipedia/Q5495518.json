In 1911, though overshadowed in county cricket by Kent veteran Fred Huish, Studwick was chosen as the first-choice wicket-keeper to Australia because of his relative youth and did not disappoint, taking the bowling of Frank Foster and Sydney Barnes with skill. His skill was seen to even greater effect taking Barnes on the matting wickets of South Africa in 1914: with Barnes' bowling bouncing and turning. In the following season, Strudwick's skill was an essential part of Surrey's success in winning the County Championship for the only time during his career."]}, {"page": "Joe Murrell", "response": ["Murrell was born at Hounslow in Middlesex.Joe Murrell, CricInfo.
