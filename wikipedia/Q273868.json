The team were then asked to produce a song for Divine and they recorded \"You Think You're a Man\" at the Marquee Studio which was released by Proto Records in July 1984 reaching number 16 in the UK charts. Soon after, the team recorded Hazell Dean's \"Whatever I Do, (Wherever I Go)\". The song became SAW's first top 10 hit, reaching number 4 in the UK.

Mike and Matt turned up with a song they had written and produced called \"The Upstroke\", a hi-NRG female version of Frankie Goes To Hollywood's \"Relax\". Pete Waterman was impressed and offered to form a partnership with Mike and Matt. \"The Upstroke\", performed by female duo Agents Aren't Aeroplanes, was the very first Stock Aitken Waterman record. It wasn't a chart hit, but it was a club hit and was championed by Radio 1's John Peel. Their initial style was in creating hi-NRG dance music with \"You Think You're a Man\" by Divine (UK No. 16 in July 1984) and \"Whatever I Do\" by Hazell Dean (UK No. 4 in July 1984). This period saw a rapid refining of the core production team and their roles, with a fourth collaborator, Pete Ware, who was co-credited on the team's earliest records, leaving after Stock and Aitken objected to him taking a side gig touring with Dean.", "The tendency toward interchanging artists and repertoire was well established when Rick Astley's breakout album Whenever You Need Somebody got its name and title track from a minor hit the trio had produced a year earlier for O'Chi Brown. Evidently they thought the song still had some mileage, and it was even issued with an exact replica of O'chi's club mix for the Rick Astley club mix. Similarly, many of their songs were tried out and recorded by multiple artists; Mel and Kim, Pepsi and Shirlie and Sinitta all recorded the song \"Who's Gonna Catch You\", both Kylie Minogue and Mandy Smith recorded \"Got To Be Certain\", whilst Mel and Kim, Carol Hitchcock and Hazell Dean all laid down vocals for \"More Than Words Can Say\". Their prodigious, production line-like output and similar song structures led to them being referred to as the \"hit factory\" (not to be confused with the record label of the same name or the New York City recording studio The Hit Factory) and attracted criticism from many quarters, including the Guardian newspaper who unflatteringly dubbed the team, \"Schlock, Aimless and Waterdown\". However, Pete Waterman defended their style by comparing it to the output of Motown in the 1960s.", "SAW's early work was recorded and mixed at Marquee Studios in Wardour Street, where Phil Harding and Rob Waldron worked with them on Youthquake, the Dead or Alive album which included their huge hit \"You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)\". Waldron went to work as an assistant engineer to Harding when Waterman opened his new studio in Borough (The Hit Factory).

The 1979 \"A Song For Europe\" final was never held at all, due to a strike by BBC sound engineers. The juries had to judge using audio recordings of the rehearsals. The songs were presented to the public on Terry Wogan's radio show the following day, after the result was known, followed later in the day with a spot on the TV magazine show Nationwide, where the top 5 were revealed and the winners, Black Lace, were interviewed as guests on the show.  As a result of this industrial action, all future contests were staged at BBC studios and not as outside broadcasts from venues. The 1980 result ended in a tie between Prima Donna's \"Love Enough for Two\" and Maggie Moone's \"Happy Everything\". To resolve this, in an unrehearsed panic, host Terry Wogan called back the juries to announce their favourite of the two songs. This led to extreme confusion when the scoreboard failed to keep up and some juries contradicted the results they had given earlier. Prima Donna won, with eight juries to Maggie Moone's six. A detailed check of the votes after the show did confirm that Prima Donna were the correct winners. Prima Donna were the first winners of the competition specifically formed to take part in Eurovision. This became the norm in the 1980s and the artists taking part in the contest became more and more obscure and amateurish.
