Reformers such as Francis Burdett and John Horne Tooke were his friends, and he maintained correspondence with supporters of radicalism. Francis Place acknowledged an intellectual debt to Frend. Frend's Unitarian network, as well as the group round Priestley, included James Gifford the elder and Robert Hibbert.
