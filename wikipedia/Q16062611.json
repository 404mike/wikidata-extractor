In 1857 he was chosen as a candidate to contest the two-seat constituency of Finsbury as a Whig and supporter of the policy of Lord Palmerston. The election was held on 29 March, and Cox was elected, coming second of the four candidates, with a majority of 156 votes over the third-placed candidate.When a further general election was called in 1859, Cox found himself opposed by two other Liberal candidates. He lost his seat, with The Standard noting satirically that:\n\n\"...the honourable gentleman neither spared his lungs nor his powers of sitting out the most long-winded debate... He had almost arrived at the distinction of being called a bore... Happily for his peace, his health, and his pocket, his too Liberal career has been stopped by an oblivious constituency\".\nOn 13 November 1861 one of the sitting members of parliament for Finsbury, Thomas Slingsby Duncombe, died. On 9 December Cox announced that he would seek election in the resulting by-election. The by-election was held on 16 December, and Cox defeated his only opponent, J R Mills by 42 votes.Cox held the seat until the next general election in July 1865. He was one of four Liberal candidates who, along with a lone Conservative, contested the seat. He failed to be re-elected, finishing in third place with 5,008 votes, more than 2,800 behind the second-placed candidate.Between c.1861 and c.1868 Cox commissioned a house to be built in the village of  Netteswell, Essex.  The house was called 'Spurriers'. Cox lived in the house until his death in December 1889 aged 72. William Cox is buried in the parish of St Andrew's churchyard, Netteswell, Harlow.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Cox", "response": ["William Cox may refer to:", "*William Cox (wrestler), British Olympic wrestler", "*William Cox (governor) (born 1936), known as Bill Cox, Governor of the state of Tasmania, Australia", "*William Cox (British politician) (1817\u20131889), Member of Parliament for Finsbury 1857\u20131859, 1861\u20131865", "*William Cox (British general) (1776\u20131864), British general of the peninsular war, in Siege of Almeida", "*William Cox (Nova Scotia lawyer) (1921\u20132008), past president of the Canadian Bar Association", "*William Cox (pioneer) (1764\u20131837), constructor of the road across the Blue Mountains in New South Wales, Australia", "*William Cox Ellis (1787\u20131871), member of the United States House of Representatives from Pennsylvania", "*George William Cox (1827\u20131902), British historian", "*William Coxe (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "Finsbury (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| William Cox", "| William Cox"]}, {"page": "William Cox (UK politician)", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Cox (British politician)"]}]}}
