Perhaps because of his quick advancement through the grades of the order, Case sparked some jealousy among the other adepts. Moreover, others may have thought some of his teachings inappropriate. On July 18, 1921, Mathers wrote Case regarding complaints she had received regarding some of his teachings. Apparently, Case had begun discussing the topics of sexual symbolism and sex magic, which at the time had no official place in the order's curriculum. Since no knowledge lectures exist on the subject, whether sex practices were ever taught in the Golden Dawn has been a long-standing question. In her correspondence with Case, Moina wrote, \"I have seen the results of this superficial sex teaching in several occult societies as well as in individual cases. I have never met with one happy result.\"Clark, P. (2013). Paul Foster Case.

With the approval of Moina Mathers, Fortune created an outer court for the A+O for the purpose of attracting prospective initiates, initially called the Christian Mystic Lodge of the Theosophical Society, as a \"guise\", and then later known by its formal title, the Fraternity of Inner Light.King, 1971a, p 143  In 1922, Dion Fortune published the Esoteric Philosophy of Love and Marriage. Moina Mathers considered this to be an unauthorized expose of secret teachings of the Alpha et Omega, and also, according to author Francis King, became concerned about Dion Fortune's increasing skill with astral travel and reception of \"trance messages from Masters of the Western Tradition\" (see Secret Chiefs).  This conflict eventually resulted in Dion Fortune\u2019s expulsion from the Alpha et Omega.King, 1971a, p.143  Fortune later joined the Stella Matutina and attained the grade of 5\u00b0=6\u25a1.

In December, 1921, Case therefore wrote to Moina Mathers asking for permission to demit from Thoth-Hermes temple, but was expelled by Mathers instead in January, 1922.

Case's new school moved away from some of the Golden Dawn and A.O. teachings, adopting, for example, a modified version of Arthur Edward Waite's design of the Tarot deck and dispensing with the use of Dee and Kelley's tablets and teachings regarding Enochian magic, in favor of tablets using Qabalistic formulae.King, 1971a, pp 141-142; Clark, P., 2013, p. 89."]}, {"page": "Bergson (surname)", "response": ["* Moina Mathers (born Mina Bergson) (1865\u20131928), Swiss-born British artist and occultist"]}, {"page": "Magical motto", "response": ["Within the Golden Dawn tradition, documents and instructions were typically issued under the initials of the magical mottoes of their authors.
