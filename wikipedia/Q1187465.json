The show was an immediate hit, with Pertwee describing it as \"becoming something of a cult\" after only four episodes had been broadcast. Press interest in the series was high, and it ran on the channel until 1981. Keen to continue beyond this, Pertwee campaigned for the series and it was picked up by a New Zealand network, TVNZ, in 1987. Worzel Gummidge Down Under aired for the next two years and was screened in the UK on Channel 4. In 1995, Pertwee played the role one last time in a one-off special for ITV, which celebrated 40 years of the channel. Pertwee played the title character in Worzel Gummidge, the Musical, book and lyrics by Keith Waterhouse and Willis Hall, music by Denis King, which opened at London's Cambridge Theatre in December 1981, co-starring Una Stubbs and Geoffrey Bayldon.

For example: \"When music experts hear Colin's compositions, they say he could have been another Berlin, Porter or anybody else employed by the German State Railway.\" Guest pianists are called in when Sell has been unable to attend (or the ISIHAC team have \"won the coin toss\" as Lyttelton once said on the show), including Neil Innes, Denis King and Matthew Scott. Lyttelton's band also appeared on a couple of Christmas specials. Once when Innes was guesting Lyttelton outlined the musician's career, concluding that this \"has brought him to where he is today: standing in for Colin Sell.\" In another appearance Innes sang along to his own composition \"I'm the Urban Spaceman\" during a round of \"Pick Up Song\"."]}, {"page": "Lovejoy", "response": ["The sixth and final series of ten episodes was broadcast between October and December 1994.
