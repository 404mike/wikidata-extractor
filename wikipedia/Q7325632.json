After Jeremiah Stamler received the medal in 1988, it was not then awarded for five years until 1993 (to Richard Peto), and then not for a further four years until 1997 (Brian MacMahon). Thus, in this 9-year period when three awards should have been made, only two were. In 1991, when the award was not made at all, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine was undergoing a period of restructuring following the appointment of Professor Richard Feachem as the Dean (the former Dean, Professor Gordon Smith having retired in 1989). The award made in 1993 was either two years late, or one year early because no 1994 award was made either. However, the 1997 award was made in accordance with the three-year cycle and re-established the regularity of the award."]}, {"page": "Commission on Health Research for Development", "response": ["The Commission's work was coordinated by a secretariat, run by Lincoln Chen, Sunil Chacko and David Bell at Harvard University; Richard Feachem and David Bradley at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; and Shigekoto Kaihara at Tokyo University.
