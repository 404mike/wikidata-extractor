In that year his opera, Pauline, was given by the Carl Rosa Opera Company with moderate success. His most important work, his Symphony No. 3 in C minor, Scandinavian, which was first performed at St. James's Hall in 1880 and went on to establish itself for a decade as one of the most popular symphonic works in the repertoire, brought him some international recognition.Lionel Carley, Edvard Grieg in England, pg. 88, Boydell Press (2006),  Appearing in 1880, it proved to be the most regularly and widely performed British symphony until the arrival of Elgar's First. In 1884 he conducted five concerts of the Philharmonic Society of London, and in 1888, on the resignation of Arthur Sullivan, became the regular conductor of that society.Michael Kennedy, The Hall\u00e9 tradition: a century of music, pg. 110, Manchester University Press, (1960),  His employment there came to an abrupt termination in 1892 when he apologised for any shortcomings in the orchestra's performance of Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony before they had rendered it, due to the lack of rehearsal time that he felt he had been given. The directors took umbrage at his remarks and did not renew his contract. In the year of his appointment to the Philharmonic Society, 1888, he went to Melbourne as the conductor of the daily concerts given in connection with the Exhibition there for the unprecedented sum of \u00a35,000. In 1896, Cowen was appointed conductor of the Liverpool Philharmonic Society and of the Hall\u00e9 Orchestra, succeeding Sir Charles Hall\u00e9. He was ousted from the Hall\u00e9 after three years in favour of Hans Richter. In 1899, he was reappointed conductor of the Philharmonic Society of London. He also conducted the Bradford Festival Choral Society, the Bradford Permanent Orchestra, the Scottish Orchestra (now known as the Royal Scottish National Orchestra) and the Handel Festivals at The Crystal Palace for some years, as well as being a regular attendee at many British music festivals, both as conductor and composer."]}, {"page": "Sea Drift (Delius)", "response": ["Sea Drift was completed by Delius between 1903 and 1904, not long before his A Mass of Life. It was dedicated to the composer and conductor Max von Schillings (then plain \"Max Schillings\"), and (at a time when Delius found it very difficult to obtain performances of his works in Britain) the first performance was given on 24 May 1906 at the Essen Tonk\u00fcnstler Verein (Composers' Society) in Germany, with Joseph Loritz as soloist and Georg Witte conducting.T. Beecham, Delius (Hutchinson, London 1959), 135. Carl Schuricht was present, was immediately won over by the work, and wrote frequently to the composer about it.Lionel Carley, 'Hans Haym: Delius's Prophet and Pioneer' (in Music and Letters, January 1973), C.

The set of three 78rpm discs featured baritone Roy Henderson with the New English Symphony Orchestra and Chorus; however, the recording was pulled by Decca after a limited time (before 1936R. D. Darrell, The Gramophone Shop Encyclopedia of Recorded Music (New York, 1936).) because it fitted poorly across six record sides, and on account of contract issues related to the conductor (who went unnamed on the recording).The identity of the conductor is also disputed, between Julian Clifford (Decca listings, Decca Classical, 1929-2009 Discography by Philip Stuart (July 2009 Edition), pdf page 35 for 29 May in Chelsea, issued July 1929): Anthony Bernard (according to Jelka Delius: see Lionel Carley, Jelka Rosen Delius: Artist, Admirer and Friend of Rodin.
