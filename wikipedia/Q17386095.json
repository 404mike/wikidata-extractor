He entered Qualifying School in January 2013 in an attempt to play full-time in the PDC and almost succeeded in the third event as he reached the final round before being edged out 6\u20135 by Campbell Jackson. However, after all four days had been completed he had done enough to finish fifth on the Q School Order of Merit and earn a two-year tour card. In May he reached the quarter-finals of the World Youth Championship, but was beaten 6\u20133 by Arron Monk. De Vreede made his European Tour debut in 2014 at the Gibraltar Darts Trophy and was beaten 6\u20133 by Adam Hunt in the first round. He went one better at the European Darts Open by losing 6\u20131 to Kim Huybrechts in the second round. When Richie Burnett withdrew from the 2015 PDC World Darts Championship due to personal reasons, De Vreede received a place in the draw through the European Pro Tour Order of Merit. In his debut in the event, De Vreede played Dave Chisnall in the first round and was beaten 3\u20130, missing one set dart in the third."]}]}}
