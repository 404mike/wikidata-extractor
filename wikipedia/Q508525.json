In Vol II of his biography of his father (Young Statesman, p. 290), Randolph states that his parents had moved from Bolton Street to Eccleston Square in March 1909. His parents nicknamed him \"the Chumbolly\" before he was born.The meaning of the word is obscure. Randolph himself claimed not to know what it meant [Young Statesman pp. 350\u201355] His sister Mary Soames believed that it meant \"a beautiful flower\" in North West India, or else was a Farsi (Persian) word for a fat, happy child.[Soames 2003, p. 81] Mary Lovell writes that it was an Indian word for a chubby, happy child.[Lovell 2012, p. 268]"]}, {"page": "Chartwell", "response": ["On 5 April 1955, Churchill chaired his last cabinet, almost fifty years since he had first sat in the Cabinet Room as President of the Board of Trade in 1908. The following day he held a tea party for staff at Downing Street before driving to Chartwell. On being asked by a journalist on arrival how it felt no longer to be prime minister, Churchill replied, \"It's always nice to be home\". For the next ten years, Churchill spent much time at Chartwell, although both he and Lady Churchill also travelled extensively. His days there were spent writing, painting, playing bezique or sitting \"by the fish pond, feeding the golden orfe and meditating\". Of his last years at the house, Churchill's daughter, Mary Soames, recalled, \"in the two summers that were left to him he would lie in his 'wheelbarrow' chair contemplating the view of the valley he had loved for so long\".", "In 1946\u201347, Churchill extended his land-holdings around Chartwell, purchasing Chartwell Farm and Parkside Farm, and subsequently Bardogs Farm and a market garden. By 1948, he was farming approximately 500 acres. The farms were managed by Mary Soames's husband, Christopher and Churchill kept cattle and pigs and also grew crops and market vegetables. The farms did not prove profitable, and by 1952 Churchill's operating losses on them exceeded \u00a310,000 a year. By the end of the decade, both the farms and the livestock had been sold."]}, {"page": "Clementine Churchill", "response": ["Although legally the daughter of Sir Henry Hozier and Lady Blanche Hozier (a daughter of David Ogilvy, 10th Earl of Airlie), her paternity is a subject of much debate, as Lady Blanche was well known for infidelity. After Sir Henry found Lady Blanche with a lover in 1891, she managed to avert her husband's suit for divorce because of his own infidelities, and thereafter the couple separated. Lady Blanche maintained that Clementine's biological father was Capt. William George \"Bay\" Middleton, a noted horseman; Mary Soames, Clementine's youngest child, believed this. However, Clementine's biographer, Joan Hardwick, has surmised (due in part to Sir Henry Hozier's reputed sterility) that all Lady Blanche's \"Hozier\" children were actually fathered by her sister's husband, Algernon Bertram Freeman-Mitford, 1st Baron Redesdale (1837\u20131916), better known as a grandfather of the famous Mitford sisters of the 1920s. Whatever her true paternity, Clementine is recorded as being the daughter of Lady Blanche and Sir Henry.", "In the summer of 1899, when Clementine was 14, her mother moved the family to Dieppe, a coastal community in the north of France.

London, Doubleday While in Dieppe, the family became well acquainted with \u2018La Colonie\u2019, or the other English inhabitants living by the sea. This group consisted of military men, writers and painters, such as Aubrey Beardsley and Walter Sickert. The latter came to be a great friend of the family. According to Clementine's daughter, Mary Soames, Clementine was deeply struck by Sickert and thought he was the most handsome and compelling man she had ever seen. The Hoziers' happy life in France ended when Kitty, the eldest daughter, was struck with typhoid fever. Blanche Hozier sent Clementine and her sister Nellie to Scotland so she could devote her time completely to Kitty.
