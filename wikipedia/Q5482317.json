The Rochdale incumbent Thomas Drake (1745\u20131819) had died in September. He had ordered volunteer troops to fire on a crowd during a 1795 riot, causing two deaths, and his reputation had suffered.Alan Booth, Food Riots in the North-West of England 1790\u20131801, Past & Present No. 77 (Nov., 1977), pp. 84\u2013107, at p. 100.

Hay was successful with the backing of the Manchester municipal establishment. Hay continued to hold the Ackworth rectory with  a dispensation; he had curates there, William James Farrington (1820), John Hope (1821), Richard Bassnett (1823), and Thomas Frederick Paull Hankins (1828). At Rochdale also he had curates, beginning with James Aspinall (1824), and including Francis Robert Raines (1829\u20131832). Raines wrote \"Mr. Hay seems never to have been known in his parish as a clergyman, but only as a lawyer and a politician.\" Henry Charles Beeching in the Dictionary of National Biography called Hay an absentee Erastian.", "Much material collected by Hay was added to scrapbooks. Manuscripts, commonplace books and scrapbooks (18 volumes) went to Chetham's Library. Other manuscripts came into the hands of A. P. Wadsworth, whose daughter Janet gave them in 1957 to the John Rylands Library. These scrapbooks, mostly consisting of newspaper cuttings, are in some ways comparable with those of the Yorkshire antiquarian and diarist Dorothy Richardson (1748\u20131819). Hay's interests included poetry, trivia and the local volunteer corps. The scrapbooks were maintained in parallel with commonplace books. The scrapbooks and other papers were given by Hay's daughter Mary, after his death, to Francis Robert Raines."]}]}}
