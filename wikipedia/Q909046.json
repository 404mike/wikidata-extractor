He was intrigued by atomic weights and the periodic occurrence of chemical properties. William Odling and Lothar Meyer drew up tables similar, but with improvements on, Dmitri Mendeleev's original table. Odling drew up a table of elements using repeating units of seven elements, which bears a striking resemblance to Mendeleev's first table. The groups are horizontal, the elements are in order of increasing atomic weight and there are vacant slots for undiscovered ones. In addition, Odling overcame the tellurium-iodine problem and he even managed to get thallium, lead, mercury and platinum in the right groups - something that Mendeleev failed to do at his first attempt.\nOdling failed to achieve recognition, however, since it is suspected that he, as Secretary of the Chemical Society of London, was instrumental in discrediting John Alexander Reina Newlands' efforts at getting his own periodic table published. One such unrecognised aspect was for the suggestion he, Odling, made in a lecture he gave at the Royal Institution in 1855 entitled The Constitution of  Hydrocarbons in which he proposed a methane type for carbon (Proceedings of the Royal Institution, 1855, vol 2, p. 63-66).  Perhaps influenced by Odling's paper, August Kekul\u00e9 made a similar suggestion in 1857, then in a subsequent paper later that same year proposed that carbon is a tetravalent element.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August Kekul\u00e9", "response": ["In 1856, Kekul\u00e9 became Privatdozent at the University of Heidelberg. In 1858, he was hired as full professor at the University of Ghent, then in 1867 he was called to Bonn, where he remained for the rest of his career. Basing his ideas on those of predecessors such as Williamson, Charles Gerhardt, Edward Frankland, William Odling, Auguste Laurent, Charles-Adolphe Wurtz and others, Kekul\u00e9 was the principal formulator of the theory of chemical structure (1857\u201358). This theory proceeds from the idea of atomic valence, especially the tetravalence of carbon (which Kekul\u00e9 announced late in 1857) and the ability of carbon atoms to link to each other (announced in a paper published in May 1858), to the determination of the bonding order of all of the atoms in a molecule. Archibald Scott Couper independently arrived at the idea of self-linking of carbon atoms (his paper appeared in June 1858), and provided the first molecular formulas where lines symbolize bonds connecting the atoms. For organic chemists, the theory of structure provided dramatic new clarity of understanding, and a reliable guide to both analytic and especially synthetic work. As a consequence, the field of organic chemistry developed explosively from this point. Among those who were most active in pursuing early structural investigations were, in addition to Kekul\u00e9 and Couper, Frankland, Wurtz, Alexander Crum Brown, Emil Erlenmeyer, and Alexander Butlerov."]}, {"page": "Queen Mary University of London", "response": ["*William Odling \u2013 British chemist who contributed to the development of the periodic table"]}, {"page": "1855 in science", "response": ["* William Odling proposes that carbon is tetravalent."]}, {"page": "Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry", "response": ["* William Odling \u2013 Helped develop the periodic table"]}, {"page": "History of the periodic table", "response": [" Newlands's table left no gaps for possible future elements, and in some cases had two elements at the same position in the same octave.
