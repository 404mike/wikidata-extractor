Amongst his most notable successes as a producer were Colditz, The Brothers, Secret Army and Howards' Way.\nAfter studying at RADA, Glaister made his West End debut in 1939. With the outbreak of war, he joined the Royal Air Force, commissioned as Pilot Officer on 8 September 1939 and initially flying a Blenheim bomber. He later served as a photo reconnaissance pilot in 208 Squadron RAF in the Western Desert, initially flying Westland Lysanders. It was during these latter duties that he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross on 6 October 1942, for a hazardous reconnaissance flight in an unarmed Hurricane at extremely low level across the Italian front line. He rose to the rank of Squadron Leader and retired from the RAF on 5 Agust 1952 (for medical reasons). Glaister later drew on his RAF experiences when, in 1963, he produced Moonstrike, a drama about an RAF squadron which ferried agents in and out of occupied Europe in Westland Lysanders. From 1962, he worked on the popular Dr Finlay's Casebook. His 1968 production The Expert is based on the work of his uncle, forensic scientist Prof John Glaister FRSE.Glaister's success ended with the 1991 series Trainer, which was moved from prime time to a weeknight slot because of its perceived failure.

Although Howards' Way is commonly cited as an attempt to provide a British alternative to glossy American sagas such as Dallas and Dynasty, it also acts as a continuation of plot themes explored in a previous Glaister series, The Brothers, which involved a family's personal and professional crises running a road haulage firm, and embraced several soap opera touches in its characterisations and storylines.", "Inspired by a storyline in Howards' Way, Gerard Glaister went on to create Trainer (1991\u20131992), set in the world of horse-racing, and also featuring several of the same cast members."]}, {"page": "Secret Army (TV series)", "response": ["Secret Army is a television drama made by the BBC and the Belgian national broadcaster BRT (now VRT) created by Gerard Glaister.
