In addition she assisted with developing and printing the film. Her most famous role was in the 1903 film Alice in Wonderland where she played Alice opposite her future husband Norman Whitten as the \"Mad Hatter\". This film is historically important as it is the first in a long line of later film adaptations of Lewis Carroll's 1865 children's book Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. She also played the part of a distraught nursemaid in Hepworth's 1905 film, Rescued By Rover, which was a global success, with 395 prints sold for worldwide distribution. Clark acted in approximately 22 short silent films.Filmography of May Clark, British Film Institute database; accessed 2 July 2020."]}, {"page": "John MacDonagh", "response": ["After making other films in the United States he returned to theatre.

In 1921 he wrote the theatrical hit The Irish Jew, about the election of a Jew as Lord Mayor of Dublin, for Broadway, in which O'Dea played a cameo part. This helped O'Dea on the way to become Ireland's most popular comedian. In 1922 he directed some light comedy films produced by Norman Whitten, including Casey's Millions, with Barrett MacDonnell, Chris Sylvester and Jimmy O'Dea, which was critically well received.
