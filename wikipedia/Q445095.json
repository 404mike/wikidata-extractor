She happened to be visiting Dublin in 1884, when Wilde was lecturing at the Gaiety Theatre. He proposed to her, and they married on 29 May 1884 at the Anglican St James's Church, Paddington, in London. Although Constance had an annual allowance of \u00a3250, which was generous for a young woman (equivalent to about \u00a3 in current value), the Wildes had relatively luxurious tastes. They had preached to others for so long on the subject of design that people expected their home to set new standards. No. 16, Tite Street was duly renovated in seven months at considerable expense. The couple had two sons together, Cyril (1885) and Vyvyan (1886). Wilde became the sole literary signatory of George Bernard Shaw's petition for a pardon of the anarchists arrested (and later executed) after the Haymarket massacre in Chicago in 1886."]}, {"page": "Constance (given name)", "response": ["*Constance Lloyd (1858\u20131898), Oscar Wilde's wife"]}, {"page": "Mina Loy", "response": ["In 1917 she met the \"poet-boxer\" Arthur Cravan, a nephew of Oscar Wilde's wife, Constance Lloyd.
