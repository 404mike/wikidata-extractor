In reply, two run-outs and wickets from Gareth Batty and Zander de Bruyn left Warwickshire trailing by 60 with one wicket in hand, with Heath Streak and James Anyon at the crease. Streak rotated the strike well, facing most of the balls and hitting most of the runs, and brought the score to 140 for 9 with a ball to spare. Then \u2013 setting off for the last run that would tie the scores (and win the match for Warwickshire on fewer wickets lost) \u2013 Streak was run out for 59, off 32 balls, and Warwickshire's quarter-final hopes were dented, but not wiped out."]}, {"page": "James Kirtley", "response": ["The third and fourth matches of Kirtley's four match Test career were against Sri Lanka in December 2003. The first game was drawn, with Kirtley taking 2-109 and 2-62, and hitting 3 not out in the first innings. The second encounter was won comprehensively by Sri Lanka, by an innings and 215 runs. England batted first and scored 265, with Kirtley scoring 1. In their reply, the Sri Lankans amassed 628, with all bowlers struggling. Ashley Giles took two wickets at the cost of 190 runs and Gareth Batty conceded 137 with no reward, making Kirtley's return of 2-131 look distinctly presentable. In their reply, England were dismissed for 148. Despite this batting failure by the team, Kirtley hit 12, his best ever score in a Test, off 25 deliveries, including a six, before being bowled by Muttiah Muralitharan."]}, {"page": "Daryl Mitchell (English cricketer)", "response": ["Mitchell was appointed vice-captain to Vikram Solanki for the start of the season, replacing the departed Gareth Batty. He struck a rich vein of form that season, scoring four centuries and 1,000 runs by mid-August. Three of his centuries came in consecutive innings, two against Gloucestershire at Cheltenham, where he led Worcestershire to an improbable victory having been 202 behind on first innings, and another, a fine 165, against Glamorgan. Following defeat in this last match, Solanki resigned as captain, and Mitchell was immediately appointed his successor."]}, {"page": "List of nicknames used in cricket", "response": ["* Gareth Batty \u2013 Boris, Nora"]}, {"page": "Jim Troughton", "response": ["On 19 August 2014, Troughton announced that he would be retiring, with immediate effect, because of a back injury.
