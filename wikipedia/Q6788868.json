Notable was Paul Cornell who wrote five of the novels, including the single most popular one (according to a Doctor Who Magazine poll), Human Nature. Cornell went on to write for the 2005 revival of the television series: \"Father's Day\" and \"Human Nature\"/\"The Family of Blood\", the latter a two-part adaptation of the 38th New Adventure. Others who later worked on the revived television series include Mark Gatiss, Gareth Roberts, Matt Jones, Simon Winstone and Gary Russell.

At its height, new novels in both lines were being published monthly. Many authors of these books went on to write for the revival of Doctor Who in 2005: Russell T Davies, Paul Cornell, Gareth Roberts, Matt Jones, and Mark Gatiss. Indeed, if one counts Steven Moffat's contribution to the second Decalog collection, then about 75% of episodes of the new series were written by people who contributed to the Virgin line. (The same cannot be said of the BBC Books line. In fact, no writer who made their Doctor Who debut on the BBC Books line has written for the new series. The only writers to have contributed to the BBC line and the new series are those who also wrote for the Virgin line - Gatiss, who wrote two BBC books, and Cornell, who wrote one. Several writers from the BBC line have written tie-in novels for the new series, however, including editors Justin Richards and Stephen Cole.)"]}, {"page": "Bernice Summerfield", "response": ["*Beyond the Sun by Matt Jones"]}, {"page": "Ian Chesterton", "response": ["*\"The Nine-Day Queen\" by Matt Jones (Decalog 2: Lost Property)"]}, {"page": "Matthew Jones", "response": ["Matthew or Matt Jones may refer to:", "*Matt Jones, past member of the band Ultrasound", "*Matt Jones (footballer, born 1970), English footballer formerly of Southend United", "*Matt Jones (footballer, born 1980), Welsh international football player", "*Matt Jones (footballer, born 1986),  English football goalkeeper for Belenenses", "*Matt Jones (basketball) (born 1994), American basketball player", "*Matt Jones (Australian footballer) (born 1987), Australian rules footballer", "*Matt Jones (golfer) (born 1980), Australian professional golfer", "*Matt Jones (ice hockey) (born 1983), American ice hockey defenseman", "*Matt Jones (mixed martial artist) (born 1982), American mixed martial artist", "*Matt Jones (rugby union) (born 1984), Welsh international rugby union player", "*Matt Jones (wide receiver) (born 1983), American football wide receiver", "*Matt Jones (running back) (born 1993), American football running back", "*Matt Jones (interaction designer) (born 1968), active researcher and organizer of scientific conferences", "*Matt Jones (writer) (born 1968), British television writer and television producer", "*Matt Jones (radio host) (born 1978), host and founder of Kentucky Sports Radio", "*Matt Jones (actor) (born 1981), American actor and comedian", "*Matt Jones (American politician), American politician from Colorado", "*Matt Jones (Canadian politician), member of the Alberta Legislature"]}, {"page": "Torchwood", "response": [" The other episodes were written by James Moran, Matt Jones, J.
