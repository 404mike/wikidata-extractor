Various Spiritualist mediums came to be disillusioned with the esoteric thought available, and sought inspiration in pre-Swedenborgian currents; the most prominent of these were Emma Hardinge Britten (1823\u20131899) and Helena Blavatsky (1831\u20131891), the latter of whom called for the revival of the \"occult science\" of the ancients, which could be found in both the East and West. Authoring the influential Isis Unveiled (1877) and The Secret Doctrine (1888), she co-founded the Theosophical Society in 1875. Subsequent leaders of the Society, namely Annie Besant (1847\u20131933) and Charles Webster Leadbeater (1854\u20131934) interpreted modern theosophy as a form of ecumenical esoteric Christianity, resulting in their proclamation of Indian Jiddu Krishnamurti (1895\u20131986) as world messiah. In rejection of this was the breakaway Anthroposophical Society founded by Rudolf Steiner (1861\u20131925).
