He most recently played for Cymru Premier club Newtown.\nBorn in Cardiff, Cotterill began his career at Bristol City before signing for Premier League Wigan Athletic where he spent two seasons before switching to Sheffield United, initially on loan and then later on a permanent deal.  From United, Cotterill transferred to Swansea City in his native Wales, before spending a spell on loan at Portsmouth and then transferring to Barnsley.  It was from Barnsley that Cotterill signed for near neighbours Doncaster Rovers, where he spent two seasons before joining Birmingham City. He spent the second half of the 2016\u201317 season on loan to Bristol City. Cotterill's contract with Birmingham was cancelled by mutual consent in December 2017, and he joined ATK of the Indian Super League. In January 2020, Cotterill came out of retirement to play for Cymru Premier side Barry Town United.\nCotterill has represented Wales at full international level on more than 20 occasions, scoring twice.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Barry Town United F.C.", "response": ["|MF|| David Cotterill"]}, {"page": "Thomas Butler (footballer)", "response": ["In January 2012, Rodgers offered Butler (along with David Cotterill and Andrea Orlandi) to join Dutch side ADO Den Haag on loan as their first team is limited. Swansea City announced on 20 January 2012 that Butler has been released from his contract by mutual consent, he signed a one-year contract in August 2011, but never made an appearance for Swansea in the Premier League."]}, {"page": "Mark Gower", "response": ["Before the start of the 2009\u201310 season, Gower revealed he would be ditching his number 11 shirt, when he chose that number all the squad told him it was 'cursed' and fail to find good form. Gower from then on wore the number 27 shirt. Shortly after changing shirt numbers he scored four goals in two pre-season friendlies. He finally scored his first league goal for Swansea in the 2\u20130 win over Queens Park Rangers. Since the start of the 2010\u201311 season under new manager Brendan Rodgers, Gower has adapted a new role in the centre of midfield and had played with eight different players this season in that very same position: Jordi L\u00f3pez, Andrea Orlandi, Kemy Agustien, Darren Pratley, Joe Allen, David Cotterill, Scott Donnelly and the returning Leon Britton. Gower signed a one-year extension to his contract in November 2010, the extension proved Gower was viewed as integral to Brendan Rodgers plans."]}, {"page": "Caerau, Cardiff", "response": ["* David Cotterill, Welsh Footballer."]}, {"page": "Nathan Dyer", "response": ["Dyer started the 2010\u201311 season with strong performances, including during the new coach Brendan Rodgers' home match for Swansea City: a 4\u20130 rout against Preston in which Dyer scored one goal and set up a goal for David Cotterill. His second goal of the season came when he scored the opening goal in a 4\u20133 victory over Middlesbrough on 12 February 2011. His form was sustained throughout the campaign, and he was eventually named Swansea City Supporters' Player of the Year 2010\u201311. Dyer played an important role in the Football League Championship's play-off final in which he made a double assist, for both Stephen Dobbie and Scott Sinclair, in a 4\u20132 win over Reading. That victory earned Swansea a promotion to the Premier League, making them the first Welsh club to ever play in the league."]}, {"page": "Andrea Orlandi", "response": ["On 4 July 2011, after having helped Swansea to its first-ever promotion to the Premier League, contributing 20 games to this feat, Orlandi penned a new one-year contract extension with the club. After signing, however, he found opportunities limited in Brendan Rodgers' first team and, on 2 January 2012, was offered to ADO Den Haag on a temporary basis alongside Thomas Butler and David Cotterill; both Butler and Cotterill were subsequently released from their contracts, with Orlandi opting to remain with the Welsh until the end of the season."]}, {"page": "Cardiff City F.C. Under-23s and Academy", "response": ["By the late 1990s, Cardiff chairman Steve Borley led an investment in the club's youth system along with manager Frank Burrows. The move was in direct response to several Cardiff-born players, including future Welsh internationals Craig Bellamy, Mark Pembridge, Gareth Bale and David Cotterill, leaving the area to sign for more sophisticated youth programmes. Neal Ardley, who managed the academy for five years, later stated that during this period, the youth system at Cardiff was an \"unattractive prospect\" and that staff at the club had described how \"we could not have attracted those players at that point because the club had nothing to offer.\""]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 Hull City A.F.C. season", "response": ["Hull entered the fifth round for the first time since 1989 and were given an away tie with local team Sheffield United.

His next appearance was five weeks later away at Reading; he started the match at centre back alongside Michael Morrison, and scored Birmingham's second goal in their 2\u20130 win after 27 minutes when David Cotterill's free kick was parried by Reading's goalkeeper. Playing in his preferred position and hoping for a permanent move, Shotton kept his place for the next five matches, and succeeded in impressing manager Gary Rowett to the extent that he would consider making an offer for the player if he were available."]}, {"page": "Cotterill", "response": ["*David Cotterill (born 1987), a Welsh footballer"]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 Wigan Athletic F.C. season", "response": ["|  David Cotterill ||  Sheffield United || Undisclosed || 31 July 2008 || align=\"center\"|"]}, {"page": "2011 Nations Cup", "response": ["|MF ||19||David Cotterill || || ", "|AM ||7 ||David Cotterill"]}]}}
