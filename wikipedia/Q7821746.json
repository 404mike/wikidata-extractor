He brought in a host of new players and the club escaped from relegation by finishing 18th in Division Two that May. In the close-season, he released a number of the fans favourite players including Joe Dunne and Tony Adcock. Wadsworth held a short-term coaching role with St. Kitts & Nevis.

A consistent performer with the U's, it was not until the 1981\u201382 season that Allinson began to be noticed by the wider football world. Colchester boasted a powerful strike force of Roy McDonough, Kevin Bremner, Tony Adcock and Allinson, who scored 43 league goals in just two seasons. Allinson was valued in the region of \u00a3100,000 to Colchester, but an administration error cost the club dearly when his future benefits and bonuses were erroneously entered as less than his previous contract, entitling the player to a free-transfer. Fulham were the club most likely to sign Allinson, before a late bid from Arsenal was placed, joining them in the summer of 1983."]}, {"page": "David White (English footballer)", "response": ["In his childhood White played for Salford Boys, before joining the youth system at Manchester City. He signed as an apprentice on his eighteenth birthday, and was a member of City's \"golden generation\" that won the FA Youth Cup in 1986. White made his debut for Manchester City's first-team in September 1986, in a 1\u20130 defeat to Luton Town. He soon became a regular in the side, alternating between the right-wing and striker positions, and missed just one game in the next two seasons.

He scored in six successive league games between October and December 1988, and went on to make over 40 league appearances, scoring 13 times, in two seasons at Swindon. He joined AFC Bournemouth for a fee of \u00a3110,000 in March 1989, though he failed to settle and after only 14 games in which he failed to score, was sold to Northampton Town for \u00a370,000. Barnes managed to star despite Northampton being relegated, and with Tony Adcock formed a successful striking partnership, Barnes scoring 37 times in 98 league games for the Cobblers. In February 1992, a financial crisis came to a head at Northampton, and with the club in administration, both Barnes and Adcock were sold to Peterborough United, Barnes costing only \u00a335,000 in a joint \u00a365,000 deal.

He scored 18 league goals for Manchester City, including the equaliser at Bradford City on the last day of the 1988\u201389 season that meant Manchester City won promotion, a point ahead of Crystal Palace. On 23 September 1989, he put City 2\u20130 ahead in the famous 5\u20131 derby win over Manchester United in the First Division. When manager Machin was sacked by Manchester City chairman Peter Swales, his replacement Howard Kendall saw no place in his side for Morley."]}]}}
