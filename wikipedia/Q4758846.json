Andrew Wareham suggests that these two different branches of the royal family may have come together in the marriage which produced \u00c6lfgifu.

In favour of the former, Andrew Wareham has suggested that in naming his third and most 'throneworthy' son (b. after c. 964) \u00c6thelred, after his great-great-uncle and thus after \u00c6lfgifu's and \u00c6thelweard's ancestor (see genealogy \u2191), Edgar may have intended to make a sympathetic gesture by which he stressed their kinship.Wareham, \"Transformation of Kinship.\" p. 389."]}, {"page": "Wareham", "response": ["* Andrew Wareham, British historian"]}, {"page": "Hearth tax", "response": ["The centre was established in 1995 (then known as the Centre for Hearth Tax Studies) under the direction of Professor Margaret Spufford.

Owen object that there is no sign of royal relatives or connections in Wynfl\u00e6d's will and Finberg's assumptions about \u00c6lfgifu's family therefore stand on shaky ground.Keynes, \u201cAlfred the Great and Shaftesbury Abbey.\u201d pp. 43-5; Owen, \u201cWynfl\u00e6d's wardrobe.\u201d p. 197 note 1; Yorke, Nunneries and the Anglo-Saxon royal houses. p. 100 note 136. Andrew Wareham is less troubled about this and suggests that different kinship strategies may account for it.Wareham, \u201cTransformation of kinship.\u201d pp. 382-3. Much of the issue of identification also seems to hang on the number of years by which Wynfl\u00e6d can plausibly have outlived her daughter. In this light, it is significant that on palaeographical grounds, David Dumville has rejected the conventional date of c. 950 for the will, which he considers \u201cspeculative and too early\u201d (and that one Wynfl\u00e6d was still alive in 967).Dumville, \u201cEnglish square minuscule.\u201d p. 146 note 75. The Prosopography of Anglo-Saxon England also links Wynfl\u00e6d with the noble matrona of that name, who appears in as late as 967 receiving royal grants of land in Hampshire.
