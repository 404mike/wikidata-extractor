His primary areas of research are the systematics and ecology of venomous snakes and the evolution of their venoms. He has  authored approximately 150 scientific papers on varying herpetological subjects. Recent contributions have included descriptions of new species, especially of cobras, several studies into how natural selection drives the evolution of snake venoms, and demonstrating the likely vulnerability of Madagascar's native fauna to the skin toxins of the invasive Asian toad Duttaphrynus melanostictus. He was the scientific editor for The Herpetological Journal (2002\u20132009), the scientific publication of the British Herpetological Society.\nHe has participated in the description of the following taxa:\n\nNaja mandalayensis Slowinski & W\u00fcster 2000.\nDrymarchon caudomaculatus W\u00fcster, Yrausquin & Mijares-Urrutia 2001.\nLycodon cardamomensis Daltry & W\u00fcster 2002.\nNaja nubiae W\u00fcster & Broadley 2003.\nNaja ashei W\u00fcster & Broadley 2007.\nNaja senegalensis Trape, Chirio & W\u00fcster 2009.\nSubgenus Afronaja Wallach, W\u00fcster & Broadley 2009.\nAcanthophis cryptamydros Maddock, Ellis, Doughty, Smith & W\u00fcster 2015.\nNaja guineensis Broadley, Trape, Chirio, Ineich & W\u00fcster 2018.\nNaja savannula Broadley, Trape, Chirio & W\u00fcster 2018.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Aspidites", "response": ["W\u00fcster W, Bush B, Keogh JS, O'Shea M, Shine R. 2001.

Previously, seven other C. viridis subspecies were also recognized, including C. v. abyssus, C. v. caliginis, C. v. cerberus, C. v. concolor, C. v. helleri, C. v. lutosus and C. v. oreganus. However, in 2001 Ashton and de Queiroz described their analysis of the variation of mitochondrial DNA across the range of this species. Their results agreed broadly with those obtained by Pook et al. (2000). Two main clades were identified, east and west of the Rocky Mountains, which they argued were actually two different species: on the one hand C. viridis, including the conventional subspecies C. v. viridis and C. v. nuntius, and on the other C. oreganus, including all the other traditional subspecies of C. viridis. The authors retained the names of the traditional subspecies, but emphasized the need for more work to be done on the systematics of C. oreganus.Viperidae - Crotalinae - 2001 Publications.
