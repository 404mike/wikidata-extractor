His father was Thomas Matthews Rooke, for many years the studio assistant of Edward Burne-Jones, and an accomplished artist in his own right. His mother Leonora Rooke (n\u00e9e Jones) had been governess to Burne-Jones's daughter, Margaret. Rooke studied in France at the Lyc\u00e9e de Chartres and then at the Godolphin School in Hammersmith, London. He completed his education at the Slade and the Central School of Arts and Crafts."]}, {"page": "John Melhuish Strudwick", "response": ["In the 1860s he was encouraged by a visitor, the Scottish genre painter, John Pettie, whose style he subsequently emulated. His depiction of the ballad of 'Auld Robin Gray', which was exhibited at the Royal Society of British Artists in 1873, is an example of this period. His art style, however, developed in a new direction in the 1870s when he worked first as studio assistant to his uncle Spencer Stanhope and then to Edward Burne-Jones. In keeping with artists in his circle, he exhibited at the Grosvenor and New Galleries. Strudwick's studio was in Hammersmith, close to that of Burne-Jones and Thomas Matthews Rooke, who had also been an assistant to Burne-Jones. He married Harriet Reed and had a single daughter, Ethel (1880\u20131954), who later became High Mistress of St Paul's Girls' School from 1927 to 1948, and was appointed a CBE."]}, {"page": "The Tabard, Chiswick", "response": ["The Tabard pub has an entrance porch with Tuscan columns; to either side are windows divided into many small panes. The roughcast first floor of the pub has a pair of projecting bow windows, with small round windows on either side; a third similar gable faces west. A cornice forms an overhang above the windows, topped by two tile-hung gables, each with five small mullioned windows. The architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner described the Tabard as \"especially attractive, with tile-hung gables and very original shallow-curved, completely glazed bay-windows\". The swing sign was painted by Thomas Matthews Rooke, one of the artists resident in Bedford Park. The pub, depicted by Thomas Erat Harrison, was among the buildings celebrated in an 1882 illustrated book Bedford Park on the then-fashionable garden suburb.", "File:Tabard Inn and St Michael and All Angels Church by TM Rooke.jpg|thumb|Tabard Inn and St Michael and All Angels Church by Thomas Matthews Rooke, c. 1895.
