She left the company after doing voice work for Kameo.Often credited by the name E. Fischer in earlier games she worked on, she married and adopted the name Novakovic in the early 2000s.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Donkey Kong Country", "response": ["Additionally, Eveline Fischer contributed seven tracks. Fischer was less experienced than Wise, who helped teach her as they worked together. She attempted \"to give a feeling of the place you were in [and] a sense of the momentum you needed\" through her compositions, which she felt were more atmospheric than Wise's. Funky Kong's theme had originally been written by Robin Beanland for an internal progress video about another Rare game, Killer Instinct (1994). Nintendo decided to use the track in a Donkey Kong Country promotional trailer; Tim Stamper liked the track and wanted to include it in the game itself, so Wise adopted it. Meanwhile, character voice clips were provided by various Rare employees. The chomping noises made by the Klaptrap enemy came from an artist who continually snapped his teeth as he worked, while Mark Betteridge provided the playable Kongs' voice clips and Sutherland voiced the Kremlings. During visits to the Twycross zoo, Wise attempted to record real animal noises for inclusion, but they proved too quiet to be captured by his microphone.", "Category:Video games scored by Eveline Fischer Novakovic"]}, {"page": "Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!", "response": ["Development of Dixie Kong's Double Trouble! began shortly after the release of Diddy's Kong Quest, utilising the same Silicon Graphics (SGI) and Advanced Computer Modelling (ACM) rendering technology as its predecessors, in which pre-rendered 3D animations are turned into 2D sprites. Rare founder Tim Stamper re-took the role as the game's director, whereas Rare staffers Andrew Collard and Paul Weaver designed the game. The game's soundtrack was composed by Eveline Fischer and David Wise, with Fischer producing most of the game's music.", "Category:Video games scored by Eveline Fischer Novakovic"]}, {"page": "Donkey Kong 64", "response": ["Grant Kirkhope composed the soundtrack, bringing it closer to the tradition of Banjo-Kazooie than to that of David Wise's Donkey Kong Country soundtracks. However, Kirkhope has commented he tried to retain the darker, atmospheric tone that Wise brought to Donkey Kong Country, and included a remix of Wise's \"Jungle Japes\". Donkey Kong Country 3 composer Eveline Fischer was originally assigned to Donkey Kong 64; Kirkhope became involved after he was asked for assistance, and he provided Donkey Kong's voice. The \"DK Rap\", which introduces the Kong character abilities, was conceived and written by George Andreas, scored and recorded by Kirkhope, and performed by Andreas and Chris Sutherland. It was intended to be a lighthearted joke despite being interpreted as a \"serious\" songwriting attempt at the game's launch. Nintendo of America ran a \"DK Rap\" contest in which fans record their own version of the rap to win prizes including a trip to its headquarters."]}, {"page": "Perfect Dark", "response": ["The soundtrack was primarily composed by Grant Kirkhope, who replaced Norgate after his departure. Writing sci-fi music was a new and enjoyable experience for Kirkhope, as he had mainly worked on Banjo-Kazooie at the time. While he took inspiration from Blade Runner and the whistling sound of \"The X-Files\" theme song, he reused much of Norgate's sample set, especially peculiar sci-fi noises he had created. One of Norgate's few contributions to the final Perfect Dark score was the theme of the first level. A third composer, David Clynick, composed the game's cinematic sequence while Kirkhope was working on Donkey Kong 64 and Banjo-Tooie. The game supports 16x9 widescreen and Dolby surround sound, and features voice acting for all in-game and cutscene dialogue. Nintendo wanted an American actress to voice Joanna Dark, but the role ultimately went to composer Eveline Fischer. Because Perfect Dark features more than 45 minutes of voiced cutscenes, the game was shipped in a 32\u00a0MB cartridge."]}, {"page": "List of film score composers", "response": ["* Eveline Fischer (born 1969)Donkey Kong Country, Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!"]}, {"page": "Robin Beanland", "response": ["|Donkey Kong Country||With Eveline Fischer and David WiseRare: Scribes (December 21, 2005) at Internet Archive"]}, {"page": "Joanna Dark", "response": ["Joanna's design was influenced by a number of fictional heroines, including the seductive spy Agent X-27 in the 1930s film Dishonored, FBI agent Dana Scully from The X-Files television series, and the eponymous femme fatale of the film La Femme Nikita, whom Hollis describes as \"iconic, heroic, independent, vulnerable and very damaged.\" Her haircut and facial features were modelled after actress Winona Ryder. The name \"Joanna Dark\" was taken from the French pronunciation of Joan of Arc as \"Jeanne d'Arc\". Hollis revealed that they \"wanted her to be quite normal, not with supermodel looks, perhaps a little androgynous.\" Joanna is worn different attire throughout the game, a decision to make her \"intrinsically fashionable\".
