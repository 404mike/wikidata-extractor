In Ray Charnley and Ray Pointer, Blackpool and Burnley had strikers of the highest quality.  Matters improved and eventually promotion was achieved in the 1963/64 season after two campaigns which had seen Sunderland miss out on top flight football due to consecutive last day failures against Swansea Town and  Chelsea."]}, {"page": "1962 FIFA World Cup qualification", "response": ["* Ray Pointer"]}, {"page": "1962 FA Cup Final", "response": ["| ||9 || Ray Pointer"]}, {"page": "Song Car-Tunes", "response": ["*Ray Pointer, Max Fleischer's Ko-Ko Song Car-tunes (with the Famous Bouncing Ball) DVD (2002)"]}, {"page": "1962 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 UEFA Group 6", "response": ["| FW ||align=\"left\"| Ray Pointer || 10 October 1936 || 2 || 2 || 180 || 0 || 0 || - || - ||bgcolor=red| 90 ||bgcolor=red| 90 ||align=\"left\"|  Burnley F.C."]}, {"page": "1960 FA Charity Shield", "response": ["| ||9 || Ray Pointer "]}]}}
