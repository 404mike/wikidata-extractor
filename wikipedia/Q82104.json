Fleming came from a wealthy family connected to the merchant bank Robert Fleming & Co., and his father was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Henley from 1910 until his death on the Western Front in 1917. Educated at Eton, Sandhurst, and, briefly, the universities of Munich and Geneva, Fleming moved through several jobs before he started writing.\nWhile working for Britain's Naval Intelligence Division during the Second World War, Fleming was involved in planning Operation Goldeneye and in the planning and oversight of two intelligence units, 30 Assault Unit and T-Force. His wartime service and his career as a journalist provided much of the background, detail and depth of the James Bond novels.\nFleming wrote his first Bond novel, Casino Royale, in 1952. It was a success, with three print runs being commissioned to cope with the demand. Eleven Bond novels and two collections of short stories followed between 1953 and 1966. The novels revolve around James Bond, an officer in the Secret Intelligence Service, commonly known as MI6. Bond is also known by his code number, 007, and was a commander in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve. The Bond stories rank among the best-selling series of fictional books of all time, having sold over 100 million copies worldwide. Fleming also wrote the children's story Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang and two works of non-fiction. In 2008, The Times ranked Fleming 14th on its list of \"The 50 greatest British writers since 1945\".\nFleming was married to Ann Charteris, who was divorced from the second Viscount Rothermere because of her affair with the author. Fleming and Charteris had a son, Caspar. Fleming was a heavy smoker and drinker for most of his life and succumbed to heart disease in 1964 at the age of 56. Two of his James Bond books were published posthumously; other writers have since produced Bond novels.

Among those types were his brother, Peter, who had been involved in behind-the-lines operations in Norway and Greece during the war.

No? Well that man is one of the three in the world who have achieved the Black Belt in Karate. Karate is a branch of judo, but it is to judo what a spandau is to a catapult...\". Such a description in a popular novel assumed and relied upon Karate being almost unknown in the West. Following the inclusion of judo at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, there was growing mainstream Western interest in Japanese martial arts, particularly karate, during the 1960s. By the 1970s, martial arts films (especially kung fu films and Bruce Lee flicks from Hong Kong) had formed a mainstream genre and launched the \"kung fu craze\" which propelled karate and other Asian martial arts into mass popularity.

Contemporary mystery writer Paul Levine has described Chandler's style as the \"literary equivalent of a quick punch to the gut\". Chandler's swift-moving, hardboiled style was inspired mostly by Dashiell Hammett, but his sharp and lyrical similes are original: \"The muzzle of the Luger looked like the mouth of the Second Street tunnel\"; \"He had a heart as big as one of Mae West's hips\"; \"Dead men are heavier than broken hearts\"; \"I went back to the seasteps and moved down them as cautiously as a cat on a wet floor.\" Chandler's writing redefined the private eye fiction genre, led to the coining of the adjective \"Chandleresque\", and inevitably became the subject of parody and pastiche.

Perhaps the most famous fictional spy, Bond was introduced in Casino Royale (1953). After Fleming's death the franchise continued under other British and American authors, including Kingsley Amis, Christopher Wood, John Gardner, Raymond Benson, Sebastian Faulks, Jeffery Deaver, William Boyd and Anthony Horowitz.

The acronym KGB (Komitet Gosudarstvennoy Bezopasnosti-Committee of State Security) was adopted in 1954, but the organisation had been founded in 1917 as the Cheka. The frequent name changes for the secret police made no impression with the Russian people who still call any secret policeman a Chekisty. Semichastny felt that the legacy of the Yezhovshchina (\"Yezhovz times\") of 1936-1939 had given the KGB a fearsome reputation that he wanted to erase as wanted ordinary people to have a more favorable and positive image of the Chekisty as the protectors and defenders of the Soviet Union instead of torturers and killers. As such, Semichastny encouraged the publication of a series of spy novels that featured heroic Chekisty defending the Soviet Union. It was also during Semichastny's time as KGB chairman that the cult of the \"hero spies\" began in the Soviet Union as publications lionised the achievements of Soviet spies such as Colonel Rudolf Abel, Harold \"Kim\" Philby, Richard Sorge and of the men and women who served in the Rote Kapelle spy network. Seeing the great popularity of Ian Fleming's James Bond novels in Britain and the United States, Soviet spy novels of the 1960s used the Bond novels as inspiration for both their plots and heroes, through Soviet prurience about sex ensured that the Chekisty heroes did not engage in the sort of womanising that Bond did. The first Bond-style novel was The Zakhov Mission (1963) by the Bulgarian writer Andrei Gulyashki who had commissioned by Semichastny and was published simultaneously in Russian and Bulgarian. The success of The Zakhov Mission led to a follow-up novel,, Zakhov vs. 007, where Gulyashki freely violated English copyright laws by using the James Bond character without the permission of the Fleming estate (he had asked for permission in 1966 and was denied). In Zakhov vs. 007, the hero Avakoum Zakhov defeats James Bond, who is portrayed in an inverted fashion to how Fleming portrayed him; in Zakhov vs. 007, Bond is portrayed as a sadistic killer, a brutal rapist and an arrogant misogynist, which stands in marked contrast to the kindly and gentle Zakhov who always treats women with respect. Zakhov is described as a spy, he more of a detective and unlike Bond, his tastes are modest.", "Notable British examples from the Cold War period and beyond include Ian Fleming, John le Carr\u00e9, Graham Greene, Brian Cleeve, Ian Mackintosh, Kenneth Benton, Bryan Forbes, Andy McNab and Chris Ryan.

Fleming wrote the novel in early 1957 at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica. It was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape on 31 March 1958. The novel centres on Bond's investigation into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives. He establishes that they had been investigating Doctor No, a Chinese operator of a guano mine on the fictional Caribbean island of Crab Key. Bond travels to the island and meets Honeychile Rider and later Doctor No.", "In June 1956 the author Ian Fleming began a collaboration with the producer Henry Morgenthau III on a planned television series, Commander Jamaica, which was to feature the Caribbean-based character James Gunn. When the project foundered, and Fleming could not fashion a new plot for his next Bond novel, he used the idea as the basis for Dr. No. By January 1957 he had published four Bond novels in successive years from 1953\u2014Casino Royale, Live and Let Die, Moonraker and Diamonds Are Forever. A fifth, From Russia, with Love, was being edited and prepared for publication. That month Fleming travelled to his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica to write Dr. No. He followed his usual practice, which he later outlined in Books and Bookmen magazine: \"I write for about three hours in the morning\u00a0... and I do another hour's work between six and seven in the evening. I never correct anything and I never go back to see what I have written\u00a0... By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day.\" By the time he returned to London in late February, he had completed a 206-page first draft, which he initially titled The Wound Man.", "Although Fleming did not date the event within his novels, John Griswold and Henry Chancellor\u2014both of whom wrote books for Ian Fleming Publications\u2014have identified different timelines based on events and situations within the novel series as a whole. Chancellor put the events of Dr. No in 1956; Griswold is more precise, and considers the story to have taken place in February and March of that year.", "Fleming used known brand names and everyday details to produce a sense of realism, which the writer Kingsley Amis calls \"the Fleming effect\". Amis describes \"the imaginative use of information, whereby the pervading fantastic nature of Bond's world\u00a0... [is] bolted down to some sort of reality, or at least counter-balanced.\" The journalist and writer Matthew Parker sees the novel as \"the most fantastical, gothic and melodramatic; and at times frankly, even knowingly, over the top\", while Black considers the fantastic element of Doctor No's underground lair to be a \"weak\" and \"bizarre\" part of the story. When the writer Raymond Chandler reviewed the novel, he thought \"that the long sensational business which is the heart of the book not only borders on fantasy. It plunges in with both feet. Ian Fleming's impetuous imagination has no rules.\" Writing in 1963, Fleming acknowledged his plots were \"fantastical while often being based in truth. They go wildly beyond the probable but not, I think, beyond the possible\".", "Writing in The Times Literary Supplement, Philip Stead was more generous to Dr. No. Despite thinking that Fleming was offering \"too opulent a feast\" with the book, Stead argued that Fleming managed to pull this off, where \"a less accomplished writer\u00a0... would never have got away with this story.\" Raymond Chandler reviewed the novel for The Sunday Times and praised as \"masterly\" Fleming's depiction of colonial Kingston in the first chapter. Chandler admired Fleming's writing, which had \"an acute sense of pace.\u00a0... You don't have to work at Ian Fleming. He does the work for you.\"", "The reviewer for Time acknowledged the critical storm around Fleming and Dr. No, but was broadly welcoming of the book, writing that while \"not all readers will agree that Dr. No\u00a0... is magnificent writing,\u00a0... pages of it, at least, qualify for Ezra Pound's classic comment on Tropic of Cancer: 'At last, an unprintable book that is readable'.\" In The New York Times, Anthony Boucher\u2014described by Fleming's biographer John Pearson as \"throughout an avid anti-Bond and an anti-Fleming man\"\u2014was again damning of Fleming's work, saying \"it's harder than ever to see why an ardent coterie so admires Ian Fleming's tales\". Benson described Boucher's critique as \"true to form\" and \"a tirade\" as Boucher concluded his review by saying: \"it is 80,000 words long, with enough plot for 8,000 and enough originality for 800.\"", "* Ian Fleming.com Official website of Ian Fleming Publications", "Category:Novels by Ian Fleming"]}, {"page": "Susan Cooper", "response": ["After graduating, she worked as a reporter for The Sunday Times (London) under Ian Fleming and wrote in her spare time.

Lee enthusiastically accepted, but by the time Fleming told the producers, they had already chosen Joseph Wiseman for the role. Lee finally got to play a James Bond villain in The Man with the Golden Gun (1974), in which he was cast as the deadly assassin Francisco Scaramanga.

After Forester read what Dahl had given him, he decided to publish the story exactly as Dahl had written it.
