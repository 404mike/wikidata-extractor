Leyton Orient were reduced to ten men in the first-half, with Ben Chorley receiving a red card for an off-the-ball incident with Chris Beardsley. Stevenage substitute Chuks Aneke was also sent-off in the second half for a high-footed challenge. In the week prior to Stevenage's trip to Rochdale, speculation mounted as to whether Stevenage manager Graham Westley would remain at the club amidst interest from fellow League One side, Preston North End. Westley eventually joined Preston on 13 January, leaving the club after three-and-a-half years in charge. Westley took his back-room staff with him to Preston, meaning captain Mark Roberts was named as player-manager for the club's trip to Spotland on 14 January. The game ended 5\u20131 to Stevenage. Luke Freeman, playing his first game since signing for the club on a permanent basis, scored the opening goal when his shot squirmed under Rochdale goalkeeper P\u00e9ter Kurucz. Shortly after the interval, Stevenage had doubled their advantage when Freeman beat his man down the left, before laying the ball to Chris Beardsley, who in-turn rolled the ball to the onrushing Lawrie Wilson, who scored with a first-time finish. Rochdale reduced the two-goal deficit when loanee Brett Ormerod finished well from Daniel Bogdanovic's driven cross. Stevenage restored their two-goal advantage almost instantly, Lawrie Wilson ran onto Mark Roberts' ball, before finishing neatly past Kurucz. Rochdale defender Joe Widdowson was given a second yellow card shortly after for a foul on Beardsley. Five minutes later, the visitors had a fourth goal, Freeman cut in from the right wing and unleashed a 25-yard drive into the top corner of the goal. Freeman was again involved in Stevenage's fifth goal, whipping in a cross from the left that Byrom side-footed home. Roberts remained in charge for the club's trip to Scunthorpe United a week later, on 21 January, with the game ending in a 1\u20131 draw. Scunthorpe took the lead shortly after the half-time interval, with Garry Thompson collecting a Mark Duffy long ball before firing into the net from 12-yards out. Substitutes Robin Shroot and Darius Charles combined to ensure Stevenage earned a point from the match, with Shroot bringing down Lawrie Wilson's cross into the path of Charles, who turned quickly to beat the outstretched Sam Slocombe from six yards. Stevenage returned to Broadhall Way three days later, after three successive away fixtures in all competitions, hosting Milton Keynes Dons. The away side took the lead after just two minutes, when former Stevenage loanee Jay O'Shea finished from close range after Chris Day had palmed away Adam Smith's cross. Stevenage drew level midway through the first-half following a neat interchange between Luke Freeman and Lawrie Wilson, with Freeman laying the ball off to Michael Bostwick, who unleashed a 25-yard strike into the bottom left corner of the goal. On the hour mark, MK Dons defender Mathias Doumb\u00e9 was sent-off for a second bookable offence after bringing down Chris Beardsley on the edge of the area. Stevenage took the lead from the resulting free-kick, with Scott Laird heading in Freeman's cross. The hosts had doubled their advantage three minutes later, Freeman again supplying the cross that was met by the head of Darius Charles, who firmly headed past MK Dons goalkeeper David Martin. With five minutes remaining, MK Dons scored their second goal of the game, with O'Shea crossing the ball for substitute Tom Flanagan to head into the net from six yards. Stevenage restored their two-goal advantage almost instantly when Charles worked his way into the box before firing the ball across the face of the goal, which was turned in by MK Dons defender Gary MacKenzie."]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Gillingham F.C. season", "response": ["|6||DF||Tom Flanagan||1||0||0||0||1", "|6||DF||Tom Flanagan||1||1||0||0||0||0||0||0||1||1"]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Milton Keynes Dons F.C. season", "response": ["| 31 July 2012 || DF ||  Tom Flanagan || Gillingham || November 2012 || ", "| 14 March 2013 || DF ||  Tom Flanagan || Barnet || "]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Barnet F.C. season", "response": ["|Tom Flanagan (on loan from Milton Keynes Dons)", "| Tom Flanagan"]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 Plymouth Argyle F.C. season", "response": ["| 20|| || CB|| Tom Flanagan|| 4|| 0|| 0|| 1|| 0"]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 Milton Keynes Dons F.C. season", "response": ["| 9 January 2015 || DF ||  Tom Flanagan || Plymouth Argyle || 10 February 2015 || "]}, {"page": "2015\u201316 Burton Albion F.C. season", "response": ["| 25 August 2015 || DF ||  || Tom Flanagan || MK Dons || Free transfer || "]}]}}
