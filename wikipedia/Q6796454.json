However, an early reference to decorating with marzipan balls appears in May Byron's Pot-Luck Cookery, but with no mention of this story, and her version may well be derived from earlier styles, which were sometimes crenelated."]}, {"page": "Mabel Lucie Attwell", "response": ["She illustrated children's classics such as Mother Goose (1910), Alice in Wonderland (1911), Hans Andersen's Fairy Tales (1914), The Water Babies by Charles Kingsley (1915), and an edition of J. M. Barrie's Peter Pan and Wendy abridged and written by May Byron (1921). For the gift books published by Messrs Raphael Tuck (Mother Goose, Alice in Wonderland, and later volumes including Hans Andersen's Fairy Tales (1913) and Grimm's Fairy Tales (1925)), she provided line drawings as well as \"colour work for twelve full-page half-tone plates.\"  Attwell's illustrations caught the attention of Queen Marie of Romania, who wrote children's books and short stories in English.
