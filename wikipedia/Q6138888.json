He started his career in railway work and then designed many sewerage schemes and fresh water schemes.\nHis most famous projects were:\n\nElan Valley Dam and Elan aqueduct for Birmingham Corporation Water Department, England (water supply).\nHury Reservoir for Stockton and Middlesbrough, England (water supply).\nAbbeystead Dam, one of the first stone-faced concrete dams.\nWerribee sewage works and farm for Melbourne, Australia.\nClaymills Pumping Station for Burton upon Trent, England (sewage disposal).\nLaid out parts of Ramsey, Isle of Man (drainage).He became a member of the council of the  Institution of Civil Engineers in 1884, vice-president in 1895 and was elected to the chair of the institution from November 1900 to November 1901.He became the elected chairman of the Engineering Standards Committee, when it was formed in 1901 from a combination of organizations, which later became the British Standards Institution. He served as High Sheriff of Radnorshire for 1901.He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1901. His candidature citation read:\n\nPresident of the Institution of Civil Engineers.

Features included reservoirs to the north of Dial Hill and Old Street pumping station. As the population increased, the water works proved inadequate and a new pumping station was created on Tickenham Road in 1901, some  to the north-east. The new site could be seen from Clevedon Court, and the 8th Baronet, Sir Edmund Elton, took exception to the designs of the engineer James Mansergh. The Waterworks Company employed the architect Henry Dare Bryan to improve the appearance of the buildings, which included the pumping station, a coal shed and store, a lodge for the foreman, and the boundary wall and gates. The original pumping station was reused as a fire station. The new pumping station contained a vertical triple-expansion engine manufactured by the Scottish company Glenfield and Kennedy. This was upgraded to a Marshal horizontal compound engine in 1916, in turn replaced in 1938, when a steam turbine was fitted. The boiler house, engine house and chimney are grade II listed, as largely unaltered buildings in Domestic Revival style, with the interior retaining its glazed tiling and elaborate roof trusses, although the machinery has been replaced by modern equipment, and the site is still operational.

Construction was overseen by James Mansergh, on behalf of the City of Birmingham's Water Department. Due to the height above sea level of the Elan Valley, water would be fed to Birmingham along a  pipeline that employed a gravity feed with a gradient of 1 in 2,300. The schedule for the project was to build the four lower Elan Valley dams first. The Claerwen would then be built later (work was expected to begin 1939 but was delayed by the Second World War; it was completed in 1952).", "* Report of a 1901 lecture by James Mansergh"]}, {"page": "Claymills Pumping Station", "response": ["Claymills Pumping Station is a restored Victorian sewage pumping station on the north side of Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire, England.

The system he conceived and which was implemented in only slightly modified form began with a water closet at every property which delivered the sewage by gravity through a network of underground sewers of increasing diameter to a steam pumping station at Spotswood where it was forced up wrought iron rising mains to Brooklyn to begin its 25 kilometre journey along the Main Outfall Sewer to the sewage farm at Werribee.http://vhd.heritage.vic.gov.au/vhd/heritagevic/?timeout=yes#detail_places;11868"]}, {"page": "Elan aqueduct", "response": ["The engineer for the Elan aqueduct scheme was James Mansergh."]}, {"page": "Listed buildings in Worthing", "response": ["|Built in 1861\u201362 to a length of  and a width of  by Robert Rawlinson\u2014provider of the town's first regular water supply a decade earlier\u2014the pier was rebuilt by James Mansergh in 1889 and had its landward pavilion added in 1925 by Stanley Adshead.

He initially gave evidence to the Royal Commission into the Sanitary Conditions of Melbourne in 1889 at which he produced a detailed and comprehensive scheme for underground sewers for Melbourne. While British engineer James Mansergh was brought to Australia to advise on the Sewerage System and proposed a number of design options, a 2011 biography by Robert La Nauze has demonstrated that Mansergh drew strongly from Thwaites' earlier report, and it was left to Thwaites, when appointed to the task, to put the plans into practice and he successfully argued for a modification of Mansergh's proposals by reducing the size of the main sewer pipes and so \"...removed a design fault in Mansergh\u2019s scheme that would have led to embarrassing blockages\". The large main sewers proposed by Mansergh would not have created sufficient velocity to scour the solids, particularly in the early stages before many properties were connected, and so Thwaites believed they would require manual cleaning. His solution was to reduce the diameter of the mains, and use ovoid section sewers, which had a narrow section at the base that concentrated the flow and therefore increased the velocity.Jon Schladweiler 'History of Sanitary Sewers', Pipe - Oval / Egg-shaped (2)  Other changes were the construction of a single pumping station at Spotswood and a single sewage treatment farm at Werribee."]}, {"page": "Mansergh (surname)", "response": ["*James Mansergh (1834\u20131905), English civil engineer"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1901", "response": ["*James Mansergh  (1834\u20131905), civil engineer"]}, {"page": "Stephen W.

A tunneling apparatus was imported from Britain, designed by British engineer James Henry Greathead. It consisted of a cylindrical shield, 3.4 metres in diameter, made of cast iron and steel plate, which was driven into the soft alluvial clays by hydraulic rams. Air pressure inside the shield was maintained at two or three times atmospheric pressure to inhibit groundwater inflow, with an airlock to allow tunnellers to enter and exit.
