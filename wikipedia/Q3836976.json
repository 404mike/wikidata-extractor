His father, Andrea Giuntini, was born ca. 1808 in Italy and, having immigrated to England, married Mary Woulds on 12 May 1839 in Lincoln. Lorenzo Giuntini married Susannah Louisa Barnett on 11 September 1866 in Frome, Somerset and had 8 children. He died in London on 29 December 1920.\nLorenzo Giuntini was a plaster modeller. This was a family gift, as his father, brothers and sons had the same profession. Lorenzo worked at one time for a known firm in the field, Brucciani (Brucciani D, &Co. Ltd, 40 Russel street, Covent Garden).\nLorenzo Giuntini took part in several archaeological expeditions:\n\nin 1883 et 1885, in Quirigu\u00e1 (Guatemala) and Cop\u00e1n (Honduras) with Alfred Maudslay, where he made plaster moulds of low-reliefs\nin 1892 in Persepolis with Herbert Weld-Blundell: the plaster was replaced by \"papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9\", due to transport difficulties.These expeditions were covered by articles in the Times on 19 August 1893, 9 September 1892 and 27 November 1898.\nSome of Lorenzo's casts are displayed in the British Museum", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alfred Maudslay", "response": ["In the course of his surveys, Maudslay pioneered many of the later archaeological techniques. He hired Italian expert Lorenzo Giuntini and technicians to make plaster casts of the carvings, while Gorgonio L\u00f3pez made casts of papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9. Artist Annie Hunter drew impressions of the casts before they were shipped to museums in England and the United States.
