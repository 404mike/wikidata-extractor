Third Division Birmingham City took a 1\u20130 lead at their St. Andrews ground in the third round, but a late equalizer from Bunn led to a replay at Boundary Park. In the replay, Rick Holden scored an excellent solo goal to give the Latics a 1\u20130 win and set up a fourth round tie at home to Second Division Brighton & Hove Albion. Brighton took a first half lead before two goals in a minute from Scott McGarvey and Ritchie gave Oldham a hard-fought 2\u20131 win. First Division Everton were the visitors to Boundary Park for the fifth round tie, and raced into a 2\u20130 half time lead thanks to goals from Tony Cottee and future Oldham player/manager Graeme Sharp. A second half fightback saw the underdogs claim a draw thanks to an Ritchie penalty and a late Roger Palmer header. The replay at Goodison Park was again a draw \u2013 ex-Evertonian Ian Marshall's close range header for Oldham being cancelled out by a disputed Kevin Sheedy penalty. Another replay was required, and this time Oldham prevailed \u2013 a goal from Palmer and a penalty from Marshall cancelling out Cottee's early strike to give Oldham a 2\u20131 win and hand them another home tie, this time against First Division leaders Aston Villa. The Villains were beaten 3\u20130 thanks to Holden's  effort, Neil Redfearn's close range finish and a Chris Price own goal. The Latics' first FA Cup semi-final appearance since 1913 saw them pitted against old local rivals Manchester United at Manchester City's Maine Road ground."]}, {"page": "List of foreign football players in Cypriot First Division", "response": ["*Scott McGarvey \u2013 Aris Limassol FC (1992\u20131993)"]}, {"page": "1984\u201385 Manchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|  Scott McGarvey"]}, {"page": "1982\u201383 Manchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Scott McGarvey"]}, {"page": "1980\u201381 Manchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Scott McGarvey"]}, {"page": "McGarvey", "response": ["* Scott McGarvey (born 1963), Scottish football player"]}, {"page": "1981\u201382 Manchester United F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Scott McGarvey"]}]}}
