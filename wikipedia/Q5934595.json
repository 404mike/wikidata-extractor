HMS Lincoln was seriously damaged in the second Cod War. In 1974, the new Labour Government made a policy decision that only anti-submarine frigates would be operational in the frigate fleet from then on. Therefore, for the rest of the decade, Salisbury and Lincoln alternated between the standby squadron and lengthy re-activations under a number of pretexts. HMS Salisbury, under the first Frigate command of Hugo White (later Admiral of the Fleet), was extensively involved in the third Cod War, holding the line against Icelandic gunboats within  of multinational fishing fleets, colliding seven times with the Iceland gunboats Tyr and Aegir in March and April 1976.Hugo White Obituary, The Times.
