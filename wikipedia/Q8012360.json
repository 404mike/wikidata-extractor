He stood again in 1922 and 1923, as a Labour Co-operative candidate with the endorsement of the Labour Party, losing in both elections by a narrow margin of less than 3% of the votes.He won the seat on his fourth attempt, at the 1924 general election, defeating the sitting Liberal MP Herbert Harvey Spencer. Hirst was re-elected in 1929 with an increased majority.However, at the 1931 general election, the Labour Party had split over Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald's decision to form a National government with the support of both the Conservative Liberal parties, and Hirst was opposed in Bradford only by a Liberal candidate, the Conservatives having stepped aside. He lost his seat by a huge margin of 32.6% of the votes.Hirts's seventh and final candidacy was at the 1935 general election, when he was defeated again, although he halved the Liberal majority to 16.8%.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1924 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|William Hirst"]}, {"page": "Bradford South (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| 1924 || William Hirst || Co-operative"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1929 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|William Hirst"]}, {"page": "List of Labour Co-operative MPs", "response": ["| 1924 || William Hirst|| Bradford South", "| 1929 || William Hirst|| Bradford South", "* William Hirst, Bradford South, 1924\u20131931"]}, {"page": "Hirst (surname)", "response": ["* William Hirst (1873\u20131946), British politician"]}, {"page": "Herbert Harvey Spencer", "response": ["By the timem of the 1924 general election the tide was turning against the Liberals in the aftermath of the first Labour government. During the 1924 Parliament the Liberals had often been divided over support for the government of Ramsay MacDonald. Even on the initial vote to bring down the government of Stanley Baldwin and install Labour's minority administration, ten Liberal MPs voted with the Conservatives. Spencer also defied the party whip in this period voting against the Labour government and with the Conservatives on the Evictions Bill (i.e. evictions under the Rent Restriction Act) The Times, 8 April 1924 p14 and twice on the Housing (Financial Provisions) Bill.The Times, 25 June 1924 p14The Times, 26 July 1924 p12 The sort of difficulties which beset the Liberal Party in Parliament were apparent nationally at the 1924 general election. The Liberals were finding it difficult to define their political position in relation to the Labour and Conservative parties and electorally, as the third party in a two party system, they were being targeted and squeezed by the others.David Dutton, A History of the Liberal Party in the Twentieth Century; Palgrave Macmillan, 2004 p98ff These electoral currents proved too strong for Spencer and in another three-cornered fight in Bradford South he lost to Labour's William Hirst, even falling to the bottom of the poll behind the Conservatives."]}, {"page": "Hirst, William", "response": ["#redirectWilliam Hirst"]}]}}
