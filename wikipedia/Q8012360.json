He stood again in 1922 and 1923, as a Labour Co-operative candidate with the endorsement of the Labour Party, losing in both elections by a narrow margin of less than 3% of the votes.He won the seat on his fourth attempt, at the 1924 general election, defeating the sitting Liberal MP Herbert Harvey Spencer. Hirst was re-elected in 1929 with an increased majority.However, at the 1931 general election, the Labour Party had split over Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald's decision to form a National government with the support of both the Conservative Liberal parties, and Hirst was opposed in Bradford only by a Liberal candidate, the Conservatives having stepped aside. He lost his seat by a huge margin of 32.6% of the votes.Hirts's seventh and final candidacy was at the 1935 general election, when he was defeated again, although he halved the Liberal majority to 16.8%.", "link_mentions": {}}}
