Four year later he was ordained to the episcopate as Bishop of Ripon. At the opening ceremony  of the Hostel of the Resurrection in Leeds in 1928 Burroughs caused controversy when he described modern universities such as Leeds as \"counterfeit presentations\" when compared to the \"real thing(s)\" of Oxford and Cambridge. His comments denounced by others at the ceremony, Burroughs was forced to withdraw his words in a statement to the press the following week.An eminent author, he died on 23 August 1934.", "link_mentions": {}}}
