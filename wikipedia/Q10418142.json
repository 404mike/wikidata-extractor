Police officers also assisted in the rescue attempts. One man clambered over burning seats to help a fan, as did player John Hawley, and one officer led fans to an exit, only to find it shut and had to turn around. Bradford City's coach Terry Yorath, whose family was in the stand, ran onto the pitch to help evacuate people. Another player went into the office space to ensure there was nobody there. One fan put his jumper over a fellow supporter's head to extinguish flames. Those who escaped were taken out of the ground to neighbouring homes and a pub, where a television screened World of Sport, which had live pictures from the ground. They queued there for a telephone to ring their families."]}, {"page": "St. Louis Stars (soccer)", "response": ["* 1975\u00a0\u2013  John Hawley (11 G)"]}, {"page": "1985\u201386 in English football", "response": ["* 22 December 1985: West Bromwich Albion won 3\u20131 against Watford.

Early in the new season, Hawley was sold and Hankin submitted a transfer request, which was turned down by Leeds' board: Adamson said he was too valuable a player to lose. In hopes of a move abroad, Hankin declared himself an admirer of \"Continental methods and their style\" before submitting a second request in Octoberalso rejectedbefore being made available for transfer some six weeks later. His form had dipped, and by March 1980, when he finally left the club, he had scored only three league goals and one in the UEFA Cup.", "In November 1981, First Division club Arsenal, who were struggling to score goals after the departure of Frank Stapleton, expressed an interest in signing Hankin. There was some argument about the feevariously reported as \u00a3300,000 or \u00a3400,000and the deal included an agreement for him to return to Vanvouver if he did not impress. Reunited with Leeds striker partner John Hawley, Hankin played twice for the first team, both times as a substitute in the League Cup against Liverpool, but no permanent move ensued. He attributed that to the economic problems then current in English football. Before returning to Canada for one last season with the Whitecaps, Hankin made a few appearances for Shamrock Rovers under Johnny Giles, who combined coaching the Whitecaps with managing the League of Ireland club. He scored the only goal of the match at Sligo Rovers on his debut, as well as missing from six yards \"when it looked so much easier to score.\""]}, {"page": "John B.
