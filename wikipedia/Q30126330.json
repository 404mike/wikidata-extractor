He was born and died at Norwich, Norfolk.\nThe son of the vice-master of the King's College Grammar School at Norwich, Stocks was educated after the death of his father at the Clergy Orphans' School, Canterbury and at St Catharine's College, Cambridge. As a cricketer, he was a right-handed lower-order batsman and a right-arm medium-pace bowler in the roundarm style. He had little success in his matches for Cambridge University, scoring just 18 runs in five innings and failing to take a wicket in eight overs, and he was not picked for the University Match against Oxford University in either of his two first-class seasons. He did, however, win a Blue in athletics in both 1875 and 1876, competing in the long jump.Stocks' final cricket match of minor status was for Norfolk against Suffolk in August 1876, when he opened both the batting and the bowling. He died two months after this game, at the age of just 20.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Stocks (surname)", "response": ["* Edward Stocks (1856\u20131876), English cricketer and athlete"]}]}}
