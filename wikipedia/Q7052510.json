The pro-government London Gazette reported that \"they were so warmly entertained by Major Scot, who commanded there [at Upnor], and on the other side by Sir Edward Spragg, from the Battery at the Shoare, that after very much Dammage received by them in the shattering of their ships, in sinking severall of their Long Boats manned out by them, in the great number of their Men kill'd, and some Prisoners taken, they were at the last forced to retire.\"The London Gazette, 13\u201317 June 1667, no. 165, p. 2 Military historian Norman Longmate observes tartly, \"in presenting damning facts in the most favourable light Charles [II's] ministers were unsurpassed.\" Samuel Pepys, secretary of the Navy Board, got closer to the truth when he noted in his diary that the castle's garrison were poorly provisioned: \"I do not see that Upnor Castle hath received any hurt by them though they played long against it; and they themselves shot till they had hardly a gun left upon the carriages, so badly provided they were.\"Saunders, p. 14"]}, {"page": "Deutsche Luft Hansa", "response": ["Even though the early years of the decade saw a difficult financial situation due to the Great Depression, Deutsche Luft Hansa further expanded its international route network in South America, and launched scheduled flights from Germany to the Middle East. Politically, the company leaders were linked to the rising Nazi Party; an aircraft was made available to Adolf Hitler for his campaign for the 1932 presidential election free of any charge. Erhard Milch, who had served as head of the airline since 1926, was appointed by Hermann G\u00f6ring to be head of the Aviation Ministry when Hitler came to power in 1933; Milch had been a member of the Nazi party since 1929 and would later be convicted of war crimes. According to a leading scholar of the history of German aviation, from this point, \"Lufthansa served as a front organization for armament, which took place secretly until 1935 - it was an air force in disguise.\" The historian Norman Longmate reported that during its peacetime flights in the 1930s, the airline had secretly photographed the entire British coastline as preparation for a possible invasion."]}, {"page": "List of people educated at Christ's Hospital", "response": ["*Norman Longmate \u2013 Author, historian and broadcaster"]}, {"page": "Deaths in June 2016", "response": ["*Norman Longmate, 90, English historian.Norman Longmate, historian \u2013 obituary"]}]}}
