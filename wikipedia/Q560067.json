The first wave had numerous errors such as the TARDIS console featuring the wrong amount of sides and a green painted K9 as opposed to the correct metallic grey, apparently because the photo given by the BBC to Dapol gave the impression K9 was green as it allegedly reflected the grass. Half a year later a second wave of the first series was released featuring an Earthshock Cyberman, Dalek variants and the Fourth Doctor, surprisingly without his trademark long scarf and hat. The next batch of figures released in 1989 featured costume variants for the Doctor and Melanie, current companion Ace, an Ice Warrior story and a two-armed Davros. At first the way to readdress this mistake was simply to snap the offending hand off but later models took more care to readdress the balance. The final editions of this wave were three more Dalek colour variants. In 1990 the Dapol factory suffered serious fire damage and no new Doctor Who figures were produced until 1998. Dapol's third series of action figures mainly focused on the early 1970s era of the programme, including two types of Silurian, a Sea Devil, the Master as portrayed by Roger Delgado and the Doctor as portrayed by Jon Pertwee. The series also featured a Dalek based on the Peter Cushing film series and a gold Dalek from Day of the Daleks, which was only available in the Third Doctor box set. In 1999 Dapol released six more Daleks, the Melkur and two types of Sontaran. The next year Dapol discontinued the figure range and made 4-inch statues of the Second Doctor and a cyberman from The Moonbase.

The company also hosted the Doctor Who Experience exhibition, which showed props and costumes from the original series and ran until 2003.
