Until 30 June 2013 he was the chairman of Eurostar International Limited, having previously been Eurostar UK Ltd's chief executive between August 2002 and April 2010.Brown was chair of the Association of Train Operating Companies (ATOC) in both 2000 and 2001. He previously worked in British Rail's freight business, migrating to BR's InterCity Planning division. He was heavily involved with BR's \"Organising For Quality\" project which divided British Rail into separate businesses. With that Brown headed up the combined InterCity Cross Country and Midland Mainline. Brown moved to Derby and continued as the head of Midland Mainline before, during and after the privatisation of British Rail. The franchise win by National Express led to Brown becoming head of its new rail unit, and a commercial director of NEG itself.Brown was president of the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport for one year, having taken over at the end of May 2008. He was appointed to the board of High Speed Two Ltd in 2012, where he has served as the chair of the remuneration committee since July 2012.During late 2012, Brown was commissioned to undertake an independent review of the system of rail franchising in Great Britain for the United Kingdom's Department for Transport.  This was published in January 2013 as \"The Brown Review of the Rail Franchising Programme\". Brown was later appointed as a non-executive member to the board of the Department for Transport for a three-year period beginning on 15 July 2013.  In June 2015, Brown was made a special director of Network Rail, reporting directly to Secretary of State for Transport Patrick McLoughlin.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Eurostar", "response": ["Eurostar won the Train Operator of the Year award in the HSBC Rail Awards for 2005. In 2006, Eurostar's Environment Group was set up, with the aim of making changes in the Eurostar services' daily running to decrease negative environmental impact. The organization set itself a target of reducing carbon emissions per passenger journey by 25% by 2012. Drivers were trained in techniques to achieve maximum energy efficiency, and lighting was minimised; the provider of the bulk of the energy for the Channel Tunnel was switched to nuclear power stations in France. Eurostar's target was to reduce emissions by 35 percent per passenger journey by 2012, putting itself beyond the efforts of other railway companies in this field and thereby winning the 2007 Network Rail Efficiency Award. In the grand opening ceremony of St Pancras International, one of the Eurostar trains was given the name 'Tread Lightly', said to symbolise their smaller impact on the environment compared to planes.Statement by Richard Brown, Chief Executive of Eurostar, during the opening ceremony, video clip on YouTube. By 2008, Eurostar's environmental credentials had become highly developed and promoted.", "In 2005, the chief executive of Eurostar, Richard Brown, suggested that existing Eurostar trains could be replaced by double-deck trains similar to the TGV Duplex units when they are withdrawn from service. According to Brown, a double-deck fleet could carry 40\u00a0million passengers per year from Britain to Continental Europe, equivalent to adding an extra runway at a London airport.", "At the same time as Pepy's announcement, Richard Brown announced that Eurostar's plans for expanding its network potentially included Amsterdam and Rotterdam as destinations, using the HSL Zuid line. This would require either equipment upgrades of the existing fleet, or a new fleet equipped for both ERTMS and the domestic signalling systems used by Nederlandse Spoorwegen. Following the December 2009 opening of HSL Zuid, a London\u2013Amsterdam journey is estimated to take 4 hr 16 min."]}, {"page": "Richard Brown", "response": ["Richard Brown or Browne may refer to:", "* Richard Brown (cricketer) (1811\u2013?), English cricketer and clergyman", "* Richard Brown (footballer) (born 1967), retired English footballer", "* Richard Brown (rugby union) (born 1984), Australian rugby union footballer", "* Richard Brown (linebacker) (born 1965), former American football linebacker", "* Richard Brown (American football center) (1907\u20131990), played for Portsmouth Spartans", "* Richard Browne (hurler) (born 1962), retired Irish sportsman", "* Richard Browne (athletics) (born 1991), USA sprint runner and high jumper", "* Richard Browne (footballer) (born 1946), Australian rules footballer for Hawthorn", "* Richard Brown (Canadian politician) (born 1956)", "* Sir Richard Browne, 1st Baronet, of Deptford (c. 1605\u20131682/83), English ambassador to the court of France", "* Sir Richard Browne, 1st Baronet, of London (c. 1610\u20131669), Major-General in the English Parliamentary army; Lord Mayor of London", "* Richard Browne (died 1604) (c. 1538\u20131604), MP for Lichfield, Newton (Isle of Wight), Cirencester and Harwich", "* Richard Browne (died 1614?), MP for Steyning, Arundel, Lewes, Gatton and Midhurst", "* Richard Brown (Ohio politician), member of the Ohio House of Representatives", "* Richard Brown (lawyer) (1932\u20132019), American attorney and politician from the state of New York", "*Richard Brown (Missouri politician), member of the Missouri House of Representatives", "* Richard Brown (captain) (1753\u20131833), shipmaster and friend of Robert Burns", "* Richard Brown (journalist), Canadian television journalist", "* Richard Brown (professor) (c. 1712\u2013?), academic at the University of Oxford", "* Richard Brown (transport executive) (born 1953), British chief transport executive & chairman of Eurostar", "* Richard Browne (painter) (1776\u20131824), early Australian convict artist and illustrator", "* Sir Richard Browne, 2nd Baronet (before 1634\u20131684), barrister", "* Richard Brown (TV and Film Producer)", "* Richard Brown, rocket developer of Corpulent Stump", "* Richard Brown, openSUSE Chairman", "* Richard Brown, British musician, original drummer for the new wave-post-punk band Modern English"]}, {"page": "2007 Birthday Honours", "response": ["* Professor John Richard Browne McMinn, Principal, Stranmillis University College, Belfast.
