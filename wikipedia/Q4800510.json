He failed to make a first team appearance between September and 9 March, only returning to the side following a run of three consecutive defeats. He broke his leg during 1935\u201336 pre-season training, but made a speedy recovery to feature in a 2\u20130 defeat to Liverpool at Anfield on 18 September. He found himself a first team regular under new manager Bob McGrory, who utilised him as a left-sided half-back in the place of ageing veteran Harry Sellars. Playing alongside Arthur Turner and Arthur Tutin, Soo would be a part of one of the club's great half-back lines. He played a total of 40 matches that season, helping Stoke to a fourth-place finish, the highest in the club's history."]}, {"page": "William Robertson (Scottish footballer)", "response": ["Robertson was born in Falkirk and played for King's Park and Ayr United before joining English side Stoke City in August 1929. It took him until 1930\u201331 to establish himself in Tom Mather's first team playing in 23 matches. He made the right half position his own in 1931\u201332 missing just two matches and then played in 40 matches in 1932\u201333 as Stoke won the Second Division title. After playing in 11 Football League First Division games in 1933\u201334 Robertson lost his place to the younger Arthur Tutin and he was sold to Manchester United in March 1934. He helped the club avoid relegation to the Third Division North and played 39 matches in 1934\u201335 as the \"Red Devils\" finished in 5th place. He only played once in 1935\u201336 losing his place to James Brown and was sold to Third Division South side Reading.

It was at this juncture that Tom Mather made two vital decisions, firstly he signed Arthur Tutin a right-half from Aldershot for \u00a3500 and then he recalled Bob McGrory from the reserves at the age of 40. McGrory's presence boosted the sides morale and Stoke climbed up the table, eventually finishing 12th place. During the second half of the season they picked up more points than any other team with the exception of the top two Arsenal and Huddersfield Town.
