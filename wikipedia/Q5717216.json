The stone masons were William Drinkwater Gough and Messrs E Turner & Sons. The bronze statues were cast by A.B. Burton. The memorial is the only 'secular' work by Comper, who was primarily a furnisher of churches. He received much hostility, from the president of the Royal Institute of British Architects and others, for not being a qualified architect, but was supported by the sculptors Sir William Goscombe John and Sir Hamo Thornycroft.
