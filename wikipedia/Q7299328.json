He took eight catches in his five games and played for Somerset's second eleven across the summer. But the county was looking for a wicketkeeper who could make reliable runs as the long-term successor to Gard, and signed Neil Burns from Essex for the 1987 season. Blitz was released by Somerset at the end of the 1986 season.Blitz did not play first-class cricket again, though he played for Derbyshire's second eleven and for Dorset in the Minor Counties.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dorset County Cricket Club", "response": ["* Rayner Blitz"]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Rayner Blitz (1986) 5 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Southerners Sports Club", "response": ["* Rayner Blitz, Former English first-class cricketer"]}, {"page": "Blitz (surname)", "response": ["*Rayner Blitz (born 1968), cricketer"]}]}}
