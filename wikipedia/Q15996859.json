He and his wife, Sarah Dodgson were also known for producing new varieties of daffodils and lilies.\nHe was born in Darlington, County Durham and died in Sutton St Nicholas, Herefordshire.Backhouse entered the double York round event in 1908, taking 13th place with 516 points. He also shot a round in the manner of the Continental style event, but as a demonstration rather than in the actual competition.  He scored 260 points, which would have given him a silver medal if his competition had been official.  Backhouse received a Diploma of Merit for his effort in the Continental style.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Archery at the 1908 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's Continental style", "response": ["Just as the British dominated the York round archery, the French dominated the Continental-style.
