On 26 June there was sharp firing followed by a Boer attack on the picquets held by the KOYLI, Cameronians and South Staffs. Private Charles Ward of the KOYLI won a Victoria Cross for carrying a message for reinforcements and then returning under fire. The Boers were driven off. On 2 July the mounted troops left Lindley and cleared the country toward Leeuw Kop while the South Staffs made a demonstration against the ridge east of the town. Next day Lindley was evacuated and the infantry moved to carry the Boer position at Leeuw Kop with artillery support. Abandoning Lindley, the column then followed the Boers towards Bethlehem and successfully attacked the town. The demoralised Orange Free State Boers had now been driven into a trap in the Brandwater Basin.Amery, Vol IV, pp. 300\u20139.Wylly, pp. 77\u20138."]}, {"page": "Charles Burley Ward", "response": ["#REDIRECT Charles Ward (VC)"]}]}}
