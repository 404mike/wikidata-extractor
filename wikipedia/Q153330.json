The third child and second son of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, Andrew is ninth in the line of succession to the British throne.\nAndrew served in the Royal Navy as a helicopter pilot and instructor and as the captain of a warship. During the Falklands War, he flew on multiple missions including anti-surface warfare, casualty evacuation, and Exocet missile decoy. In 1986, he married Sarah Ferguson and was created Duke of York. They have two daughters, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie. Their marriage, separation in 1992, and divorce in 1996 attracted extensive media coverage. Andrew served as the UK's Special Representative for International Trade and Investment for 10 years until July 2011.\nAndrew has been accused of child sexual abuse by Virginia Giuffre, who alleges that she was sex trafficked as a minor to him by the American financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. In a BBC television interview in November 2019 he categorically denied Giuffre's allegation. Following intense negative reaction to his connections to Epstein, Andrew permanently resigned from public roles in May 2020, and his honorary military affiliations and royal charitable patronages were returned to the Queen in January 2022. As of January 2022, Andrew is the defendant in a civil lawsuit over sexual assault filed by Giuffre in New York State.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "February 19", "response": ["*1960 \u2013 Prince Andrew, Duke of York"]}, {"page": "House of Lords", "response": ["Of the 92, two remain in the House of Lords because they hold royal offices connected with Parliament: the Earl Marshal and the Lord Great Chamberlain.
