A tectonic interpretation was supported by, amongst others, Charles Lapworth who had corresponded with Albert Heim on similar structures in the Alps. In 1883 and 1884 the survey geologists Ben Peach and John Horne were sent into the area by the survey's director Archibald Geikie to carry out detailed mapping.

In November that year Peach and Horne's preliminary results were published and Geikie published a paper in the same issue of Nature in which he coined the term \"thrust-plane\" for these low-angle faults, although the term was probably already in use before then. By 1888 the term \"Moine Thrust\" was being used for the tectonic break at the base of Moine schists (what is now called the Moine Supergroup).

The genus was based on G. perornatus and the fragmentary species G. caledonicus, previously described as the plant Cycadites caledonicus by English paleontologist John William Salter in 1863. This designation was reinforced with more fossil fragments discovered in the Coomsdon Burn, which Peach referred to Glyptoscorpius caledonicus. In 1887 Peach described G. minutisculptus from Mount Vernon, Glasgow, and G. kidstoni from Radstock in Somerset. Peach's Glyptoscorpius is highly problematic; some of the diagnostic characteristics used when describing it are either questionable or outright meaningless. For instance, the original description had been based on G. caledonicus and G. perornatus but since the parts of the body preserved in the fossils described don't completely overlap it is impossible to say if Peach's diagnostic characteristics actually apply to the two original species.", "When Kjellesvig-Waering designated the genus Hibbertopterus in 1959, Eurypterus scouleri had already been referred to (considered a species of) the related Campylocephalus for some time. Kjellesvig-Waering recognised Campylocephalus scouleri as distinct from the type species of that genus, C. oculatus, in that the prosoma of Campylocephalus was more narrow, had a subelliptical (almost elliptical) shape and had its widest point in the middle rather than at the base. Further differences were noted in the position and shape of the animal's compound eyes, which in Hibbertopterus are surrounded by a ring-like shape of hardened integument (absent in Campylocephalus). The eyes of Hibbertopterus are also located near the center of the head whereas those of Campylocephalus are located further back. The generic name Hibbertopterus was selected to honor the original descriptor of H. scouleri, Samuel Hibbert.The fact that Glyptoscorpius was questionable at best and that its type species, G. perornatus, (and other species, such as G. kidstoni) had recently been referred to the genus Adelophthalmus prompted Norwegian paleontologist Leif St\u00f8rmer and British paleontologist Charles D. Waterston to in 1968 re-examine the various species that had been referred to it. Because G. perornatus was the type species of Glyptoscorpius, the genus itself became synonymous with Adelophthalmus. That same year, the species G. minutisculptus had been designated the type species of a distinct eurypterid genus, Vernonopterus. St\u00f8rmer and Waterston concluded that the Glyptoscorpius species G. caledonicus was to be part of a new genus, which they named Cyrtoctenus (the name deriving from the Greek Cyrtoctenos, a curved comb) and they named a new species, C. peachi (named in honour of Ben Peach), as its type. Both of these species were based on fragmentary fossil remains. Furthermore, the species G. stevensoni, named in 1936, was referred to the new genus Dunsopterus. The key diagnostic feature of Cyrtoctenus was its comb-like first appendages. Waterston remarked in another 1968 paper that the \"controversial\" Stylonurus wrightianus was similar to the unusual and massive prosomal appendage of Dunsopterus and as such reassigned S. wrightianus to Dunsopterus, creating Dunsopterus wrightianus."]}, {"page": "Benjamin Neeve Peach", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ben Peach"]}, {"page": "Walcot Gibson", "response": ["In 1921 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.

During the nineteenth century Knockan Crag became the subject of much debate when geologists noted that the Moine schists at the top of the crag appeared to be older than the Cambrian and Ordovician rocks such as Durness limestone lower down. Disagreements over the processes that could have caused this to occur were referred to at the time as the 'Highlands Controversy'. The argument was primarily between Roderick Murchison and Archibald Geikie on the one hand and James Nicol and Charles Lapworth on the other. Murchison and Geikie believed the sequence was wrong and that the Moine schists must be the younger rocks. The controversy was finally resolved by the work of Ben Peach and John Horne whose 1907 paper on the subject remains a classic text. Peach and Horne demonstrated that the situation resulted from the action of a thrust fault - this being the first to be discovered anywhere in the world. The older rocks had been moved some 70\u00a0kilometres to the west over the top of the younger rocks due to tectonic action.Dryburgh, P. M. et al. (1995) Assynt: The geologists' Mecca.
