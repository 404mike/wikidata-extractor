After being ordained in 1895, he served in a number of towns in Scotland and England, notably Renfield Church, Glasgow, and Egremont, Wallasey, before being appointed, in 1914, to the Chair of Church History at Westminster College, Cambridge. During the period leading up to the Scottish Church Crisis (1900\u20131905), he worked closely with Principal Rainy, his former professor at New College, Edinburgh, in his efforts to secure the union of the Free and the United Presbyterian Churches. In the post World War I period, he played a significant role in the area of inter-Church relations, particularly during the Lambeth Conversations and the Revised Prayer Book controversy. (See below) As an author, two of his books, The Fact of Christ (1900) and The Life of Principle Rainy (1909) earned widespread acclaim. In 1928, Carnegie Simpson was elected Moderator of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church of England. He retired from Westminster College in 1937.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Robert Rainy", "response": ["See Lives by Patrick Carnegie Simpson (1909) and R Mackintosh (1907)."]}, {"page": "William Robertson Smith", "response": ["*Patrick Carnegie Simpson,  The Life of Principal Rainy  (London: Hodder and Stoughton 1909).
