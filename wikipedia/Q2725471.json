He was also an early proponent of English spelling reform. He observed that bees produce wax combs from scales of wax produced in their own bodies; and he was among the first to assert that drones are male and the queen female, though he believed worker bees lay eggs.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1571", "response": ["** Charles Butler, English beekeeper and philologist (d. 1647) "]}, {"page": "1647", "response": ["* March 29 \u2013 Charles Butler, English beekeeper and philologist (b. 1560)"]}, {"page": "Buckinghamshire", "response": ["* Charles Butler, pastor, grammarian, and pioneering beekeeper was born in the county."]}, {"page": "Jan Swammerdam", "response": ["In Biblia naturae the first visual proof was published that his contemporaries had mistakenly identified the queen bee as male. Swammerdam also provided evidence that the queen bee is the sole mother of the colony. Swammerdam had engaged in five intense years of beekeeping. He had found that drones were masculine, and had no stinger. Swammerdam identified the worker bees as \"natural eunuchs\" because he was unable to detect ovaries in them, but described them as nearer to the nature of the female. Swammerdam had produced a drawing of the queen bee's reproductive organs, as observed through the microscope. Since ancient times it had been asserted that the queen bee was male, and ruled the hive. In 1586 Luis Mendez de Torres had first published the finding that the hive was ruled by a female, but Torres had maintained that she produced all other bees in the colony through a \"seed\". In 1609 Charles Butler had recorded the sex of drones as male, but he wrongly believed that they mated with worker bees. The drawing Swammerdam produced of the internal anatomy of the queen bee was only published in 1737. His drawing of the honeycomb geometry was first published in Biblia naturae, but had been referenced by Giacomo Filippo Maraldi in his 1712 book. Details of Swammerdam's research on bees had already been published elsewhere because he had shared his findings with other scientists in correspondence. Among others, Swammerdam's research had been referenced by Nicolas Malebranche in 1688."]}, {"page": "1609 in literature", "response": ["*Charles Butler \u2013 The Feminine Monarchie, or the History of Bees"]}, {"page": "1647 in science", "response": ["* March 29 \u2013 Charles Butler, English beekeeper (born 1560)"]}, {"page": "1609 in science", "response": ["* Charles Butler publishes The Feminine Monarchie, or, A Treatise Concerning Bees."]}, {"page": "English-language spelling reform", "response": ["* English Grammar in 1634 by Charles Butler, vicar of Wootton St Lawrence.", "*Charles Butler, British naturalist and author of the first natural history of bees: \u0110e Feminin' Monar\u0137i', 1634.

It was based on a translation of Talon's Rhetoricae, and was a companion to The Lawiers Logike of 1585, an adapted translation of the Dialecticae of Ramus. Through it, Sidney's usage of figures was disseminated as the Ramist \"Arcadian rhetoric\" of standard English literary components and ornaments, before the source Arcadia had been published. It quickly lent itself to floridity of style. William Wimsatt and Cleanth Brooks consider that the Ramist reform at least created a tension between the ornamented and the plain style (of preachers and scientific scholars), into the seventeenth century, and contributed to the emergence of the latter.William Wimsatt and Cleanth Brooks, Literary Criticism: A Short History (1957), pp. 224\u20136. With the previous work of Dudley Fenner (1584), and the later book of Charles Butler (1598), Ramist rhetoric in Elizabethan England accepts the reduction to elocutio and pronuntiatio, puts all the emphasis on the former, and reduces its scope to the trope.Quentin Skinner, Reason and Rhetoric in the Philosophy of Hobbes (1996), p. 62.", "* Charles ButlerVictor W.

The movements were likely meant as an addition to the Benedictus and Te Deum from William Mundy's Short Service. Also surviving is the short 3-part verse anthem Awake and arise, most of which's text is lost, though Harley noted that \"this does not disguise the animation of the short piece\". His two extant instrumental works are Nomine and What Strikes the Clocke? for five and three viols respectively. These works are descried by Harley, as routine and \"workmanlike\". The musicologist John Milsom considers What Strikes the Clocke? similar to Charles Butler's Dial Song and Parsley's Clock by Osbert Parsley, as all three works center around a line that counts the hours."]}]}}
