He became resident in his constituency before (and remained so since) his 2005 candidature and became its MP, a predominantly single-town seat by population, at various times from 2010.\nFirst elected in the 2010 general election, he served for all five years of the 2010\u20132015 UK parliament and supported the Cameron\u2013Clegg coalition. Having lost his seat to the Conservative candidate Caroline Ansell in the 2015 general election, Lloyd went on to regain it in 2017 and served as the Liberal Democrat spokesperson on matters concerning Work and Pensions. Lloyd was again defeated by Caroline Ansell at the 2019 general election.\nOn 6 December 2018, Lloyd resigned the Liberal Democrat whip, saying that his party's position on Brexit was inconsistent with his pledge to his constituency that he would \"respect the result\" of the 2016 EU referendum. Until 29 October 2019, Lloyd sat in the House of Commons as an Independent, remaining a member of the Liberal Democrat party, but had the whip restored following the announcement of the general election, and the 'clean-slate' opportunity to be on the ballot paper as a committed remainer.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Matthew Green (British politician)", "response": ["Green remained involved in politics after leaving Parliament, being mentioned by the Shropshire Star as a potential Liberal Democrat candidate in the 2021 North Shropshire by-election.
