There was some controversy about the record, when Sutcliffe was dismissed with the total on 555, after which the Leyton scoreboard moved the total back to 554, meaning that the partnership had only equalled the previous record. After discussion between the Essex captain, Charles Bray, and the scorers Billy Ringrose and Charlie McGahey, the total was amended back to 555. Bray asked McGahey to ensure that a run was added to bring the total to the record-breaking figure, but later admitted that he was wrong and shouldn't have allowed the change. This remained the record for any wicket till 1945\u201346, and it was not until the 1976\u201377 season in Pakistan that it was beaten for the first wicket.
