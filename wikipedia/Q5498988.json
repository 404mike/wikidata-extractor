He is noted for his work in neuropathology and endocrine glands in relation to mental disorder, and consequently as psychiatrist and social scientist. He was Croonian Lecturer to the Royal College of Physicians for the year 1900.The Maudsley Hospital in London was Mott's idea, inspired by Emil Kraepelin's clinic in Germany, and Mott conducted the negotiations for its funding and construction. He ran the pathology laboratory which was transferred there, and treated shell shock patients during World War I. His reputation had been greatly enhanced by helping establish that 'general paralysis of the insane' was actually due to syphilis, but he has been criticised for overly organic and degenerative assumptions in regard to mental illness including shell shock. After the war, in a lecture to the Eugenics Education Society, he claimed that shell shock was rare in volunteers as opposed to regular conscripted men, and that it was not a new disorder but merely a variation occurring in those already predisposed.Mott, like Maudsley, appears to have held that mental illness was inherited due to degenerate family lines that worsened until dying out, though his selecting of cases and statistics were questioned by other eugenicists. Mott advanced an overarching theory that mental disease was due to pathology of the sexual reproductive system, as evidenced for example by atrophied testes, causing breakdown of cerebral neurons in certain parts of the brain.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Acetylcholine", "response": ["In 1867, Adolf von Baeyer resolved the structures of choline and acetylcholine and synthetized them both, referring to the latter as \"acetylneurin\" in the study. Choline is a precursor for acetylcholine. This is why Frederick Walker Mott and William Dobinson Halliburton noted in 1899 that choline injections decreased the blood pressure of animals. Acetylcholine was first noted to be biologically active in 1906, when Reid Hunt (1870\u20131948) and Ren\u00e9 de M. Taveau found that it decreased blood pressure in exceptionally tiny doses."]}, {"page": "British Psychological Society", "response": ["* Frederick Walker Mott"]}, {"page": "Maudsley Hospital", "response": ["The Maudsley story dates from 1907, when once leading Victorian psychiatrist Henry Maudsley offered London County Council \u00a330,000 (apparently earned from lucrative private practice in the West End) to help found a new mental hospital that would be exclusively for early and acute cases rather than chronic cases, have an out-patients' clinic and provide for teaching and research. Maudsley's associate Frederick Walker Mott had proposed the original idea and he conducted the negotiations, with Maudsley remaining anonymous until the offer was accepted. Mott, a neuropathologist, had been influenced by a visit to Emil Kraepelin's psychiatric clinic with attached postgraduate teaching facilities in Munich, Germany. The Council agreed to contribute half the building costs - eventually rising to \u00a370,000 - and then covered the running costs which were almost twice as high per bed as the large asylums. The hospital also incorporated the Central Pathological Laboratory, transferred from Claybury Hospital, run by Mott. Construction of the hospital was completed in 1915. An Act of Parliament had to be obtained, that year, to allow the institution to accept voluntary patients without needing to certify them as insane."]}, {"page": "Mott", "response": ["*Frederick Walker Mott (1853\u20131926), British biochemist"]}, {"page": "Northgate High School, Ipswich", "response": ["* Sir Frank Willis CBE, General Secretary from 1939-55 of the National Council of YMCAs, who married the daughter of the biochemist Sir Frederick Walker Mott FRS"]}, {"page": "William Dobinson Halliburton", "response": ["During his tenure at King's College, he assembled a research team, many of whom later became distinguished clinicians, including such figures as Thomas Gregor Brodie (1866-1916), Frank S.

He and Rosenheim discovered that cholesterol was not pure, but contained ergosterol which led to the formation of Vitamin D under ultraviolet light. Halliburton's first laboratory was improvised in a disused corridor, but nonetheless became the meeting place of the keenest minds in the infant science of biochemistry. His early research centered on the proteins making up muscle and blood, leading to his election as a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1891. Together with Walter Ernest Dixon he studied cerebral circulation and cerebrospinal fluid. During this time he helped found the Biochemical Society of which he was the sole honorary member.British Medical JournalBiochemical JournalObituary"]}, {"page": "Fullerian Professor of Physiology", "response": ["* 1909\u20131912 Frederick Walker Mott"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society M, N, O", "response": ["| Frederick Walker Mott||04/06/1896||23 October 1853 \u2013 8 June 1926"]}, {"page": "Charles John Bond", "response": ["Charles Bond attended Repton School and was apprenticed to Dr C.M.
