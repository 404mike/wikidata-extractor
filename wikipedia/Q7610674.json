The first explicit statement to the effect that Robin Hood habitually robbed from the rich to give the poor can be found in John Stow's Annales of England (1592), about a century after the publication of the Gest.Stephen Thomas Knight 2003 Robin Hood: A Mythic Biography p. 43 quoting John Stow, 1592,Annales of England .for it being the earliest clear statement see Dobson and Taylor (1997), Rhymes of Robyn Hood p.  290. But from the beginning Robin Hood is on the side of the poor; the Gest quotes Robin Hood as instructing his men that when they rob:", "In 1598, Anthony Munday wrote a pair of plays on the Robin Hood legend, The Downfall and The Death of Robert Earl of Huntington (published 1601). These plays drew on a variety of sources, including apparently \"A Gest of Robin Hood\", and were influential in fixing the story of Robin Hood to the period of Richard I. Stephen Thomas Knight has suggested that Munday drew heavily on Fulk Fitz Warin, a historical 12th century outlawed nobleman and enemy of King John, in creating his Robin Hood.Robin Hood: A Mythic Biography p. 63. The play identifies Robin Hood as Robert, Earl of Huntingdon, following in Richard Grafton's association of Robin Hood with the gentry, and identifies Maid Marian with \"one of the semi-mythical Matildas persecuted by King John\".Dobson and Taylor (1997), p. 44. The plays are complex in plot and form, the story of Robin Hood appearing as a play-within-a-play presented at the court of Henry VIII and written by the poet, priest and courtier John Skelton. Skelton himself is presented in the play as acting the part of Friar Tuck. Some scholars have conjectured that Skelton may have indeed written a lost Robin Hood play for Henry VIII's court, and that this play may have been one of Munday's sources.Dobson and Taylor (1997), \"Rhymes of Robin Hood\", pp. 43, 44, and 223. Henry VIII himself with eleven of his nobles had impersonated \"Robyn Hodes men\" as part of his \"Maying\" in 1510. Robin Hood is known to have appeared in a number of other lost and extant Elizabethan plays. In 1599, the play George a Green, the Pinner of Wakefield places Robin Hood in the reign of Edward IV.Dobson and Taylor (1997), pp. 42\u201344. Edward I, a play by George Peele first performed in 1590\u201391, incorporates a Robin Hood game played by the characters. Llywelyn the Great, the last independent Prince of Wales, is presented playing Robin Hood.Robin Hood: A Mythic Biography, p. 51."]}, {"page": "Welsh literature in English", "response": ["The phrase \"Welsh writing in English\" has replaced the earlier \"Anglo-Welsh literature\" because many Welsh writers in English have felt that the latter usage failed to give \"Welsh status to Welsh people who, not speaking Cymraeg, nevertheless do not feel at all English\".Stephen Thomas Knight, A Hundred Years of Fiction. Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 2004.", "The beginnings of an Anglo-Welsh tradition are found by some in the novels of Allen Raine (Anne Adalisa (Evans) Puddicombe) (1836\u20131908), from Newcastle Emlyn, Carmarthenshire, whose work, Stephen Thomas Knight proposes, \"realised a real, if partial, separate identity and value for a Welsh social culture\".A Hundred Years of Fiction, p.25. (Other possible precursors are Monmouthshire-born Arthur Machen (1863\u20131947), and Joseph Keating (1871\u20131934), who began his working life as a South Wales miner.) However, many see the Carmarthenshire-born satirical short-story writer and novelist Caradoc Evans (1878\u20131945) as the first\u2014or first modern\u2014Welsh writer in English. His short-story collections My People (1915) and Capel Sion (1916) were highly controversial, and Roland Mathias bitterly comments that \"No other Anglo-Welsh prose writer. .. displayed such ill will to Wales or to Welsh people\".Anglo-Welsh Literature, p.82. W. H. Davies (1871\u20131940), born in Newport, became famous principally for his The Autobiography of a Super-Tramp which was set mostly in North America. The principal themes in his work are observations about life's hardships, the ways in which the human condition is reflected in nature, his own tramping adventures and the various characters he met. In his poetry he was particularly inspired by birds, the weather and the seasons. His prose works were nearly all autobiographical and were sometimes, as with his 1918 \"A Poet's Pilgrimage (or A Pilgrimage In Wales)\", set in his homeland. (See also Gerard Manley Hopkins (1844\u201389), Edward Thomas (1878\u20131917) and Joseph Keating (1871\u20131934).)", "Gwyn Thomas (1913\u201381) was also a coalminer's son from the Rhondda, but won a scholarship to Oxford and then became a schoolmaster. He wrote 11 novels as well as short stories, plays, and radio and television scripts, most of which focused on unemployment in the Rhondda Valley in the 1930s. He has been described by Stephen Thomas Knight as \"about the most verbally brilliant writer of Welsh fiction in English\".A Hundred Years of Fiction, p.93. His inaugural novel Sorrow for Thy Sons (1937) was rejected by Gollancz and not published until 1986. Thomas's first accepted book was a collection of short stories, Where Did I Put My Pity: Folk-Tales From the Modern Welsh, which appeared in 1946. He was also known for his negative attitude to the Welsh language, and Glyn Jones sees him as falling \"short of being a completely representative figure ... in his attitude to Wales and Welshness,\" as Gwyn Thomas \"appears in his writing to have little sympathy with the national aspirations and indigenous culture of our country\".The Dragon Has Two Tongues. p.115 Another writer who escaped from his proletarian background was Gwyn Jones (1907\u20131999). He wrote about this world in novels and short stories, including Times Like These (1936) which explores the life of a working-class family during the 1926 miners' strike. Jones founded The Welsh Review in 1939, which he edited until 1948; this journal was important for raising discussion of Welsh issues. What is probably the most famous novel about Wales, Richard Llewellyn's How Green Was My Valley, was published in 1939. It is described by Glyn Jones in The Dragon Has Two Tongues as a \"staggering and accomplished piece of literary hokum\" (p.\u00a051), \"a book [that Jones finds] impossible to take seriously, though much of it [he] read with absorption\" (p.\u00a053).

She is a prominent character in the books, being a childhood friend of, a major love interest for, and finally an adversary to the series' main protagonist, Arthur's warrior Derfel Cadarn. She begins as Merlin's most adept priestess and lover, but as she grows ever more brutal and fanatical, by the time of the final novel she will turns against him and imprisons him, torturing him to reveal the last of his magical secrets in her desperate obsession to bring back the Old Gods of Britain at any price. Eventually, she brings Merlin to total madness before ultimately sacrificing him to their lost gods, whose return she believes would rid the island of the Saxons and the Christians alike. As Nimue believes the key to her goal is to sacrifice Gwydre, Arthur's son with Guinevere using Excalibur (as she already did with Gawain), Derfel's final act of casting the sword away is not to return it to her but to hide it from her forever. Stephen Thomas Knight, commenting on Cornwell's vicious Nimue, with her tunnel-vision ruthlessness, vindicativeness, and frequent use of prolonged torture, opined the \"pro-Celtic quasi-historian\" author \"links her to the Saxons as part of her hostility to decent people, including Merlin.\" Symbolically, both Nimue and the hypocritcal Bishop Sansum, representing the Christian side of the books' major theme of the danger of religious extremism, remain still alive as the story comes to the end."]}, {"page": "De Montfort University", "response": ["*Stephen Thomas Knight"]}, {"page": "Bows against the Barons", "response": ["thumb|right|Foreground from the first-edition illustration of the Nottingham riot.
