Govan, who was a key part of the successful post-war Hibs side, was capped six times by Scotland.Govan grew up in Larkhall, a Lanarkshire town noted for its support of Rangers. He played for the local junior club Larkhall Thistle until he was signed by Hibernian in 1941. This move upset the people in Larkhall, who burned his Hibs training kit. Govan was a full-back, but had an attacking style that was ahead of its time.He broke into the Hibs first team in 1943, eventually forming a partnership with Davie Shaw. This partnership formed the basis of Hibs success after the Second World War, as they won the league championship in 1948. Although Shaw was eventually replaced due to age and injury, Govan continued to enjoy success with Hibs, winning the league again in 1951 and 1952. He was transferred to Ayr United in 1954, where he finished his playing career.After retiring as a football player, Govan worked as a mining engineer and played lawn bowls in Midlothian. He died in February 1999 and was survived by his wife and two children.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Larkhall Thistle F.C.", "response": ["*Jock Govan - Hibernian "]}, {"page": "Coronation Cup (football)", "response": ["|RB ||||Jock Govan"]}, {"page": "1946\u201347 Scottish Cup", "response": ["|RB |||| Jock Govan"]}, {"page": "List of Hibernian F.C. players", "response": ["*Jock Govan"]}, {"page": "Jock (given name)", "response": ["* Jock Govan (1923\u20131999), Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "1950 Scottish League Cup Final", "response": ["|FB ||||Jock Govan"]}, {"page": "Govan (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Jock Govan (1923\u20131999), Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "1947 Scottish Cup Final", "response": ["|DF ||2|| Jock Govan"]}, {"page": "1946 Victory Cup", "response": ["|DF ||2|| Jock Govan"]}, {"page": "Scotland national football team results (unofficial matches)", "response": ["*Jock Govan (Hibernian)"]}]}}
