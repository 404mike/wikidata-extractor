Introduced as a mild-mannered and quiet administrator working for Torchwood Three, the first episode to focus on him was \"Cyberwoman\", which dealt with both his backstory and motivations. In the episode, Ianto is revealed as a former employee of Torchwood One in London (first seen in parent series Doctor Who), whose girlfriend Lisa (Caroline Chikezie) has been partially converted into a Cyberman, a cyborg species seen repeatedly in Doctor Who. Ianto has been keeping her alive, concealed in the basement of the Hub, but she eventually breaks loose and kills two civilians. Ianto is forced into confrontation with team leader Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman), who is later able to revive Ianto with a kiss when Lisa knocks him unconscious. Ultimately, the rest of Ianto's team is forced to kill Lisa. Although Ianto's thoughts continue to be concerned with Lisa, mid-series he begins to develop a sexual relationship with Jack. By the penultimate episode of the series, Ianto is willing to shoot colleague Owen Harper (Burn Gorman) to protect Jack, and refutes claims he is merely his \"part time shag\". In the series finale, an image of what appears to be Lisa's ghost is used to bring Ianto to mutiny against Jack, but still later when Jack (who cannot stay dead) returns to life, he and Ianto immediately kiss one another."]}, {"page": "List of Torchwood characters", "response": ["Lisa Hallett, played by Caroline Chikezie, is introduced in \"Cyberwoman\" as a former employee of Torchwood One in London and ex-girlfriend of Ianto Jones. It is established that during the \"Battle of Canary Wharf\"  the Cybermen needed more troops and began directly converting people rather than transplanting their brains into Cyberman shells. Lisa is in the midst of conversion when Ianto rescues her, taking her and a support system to Torchwood Three where he keeps her in a basement until he can restore her humanity. Once freed from the unit, her Cyberman persona asserts itself and she attempts to take over the Hub in order to use it as a base for a new Cyber army. Seeing how far Ianto has gone to protect her, she transplants her brain into the body of a pizza delivery girl so they can be together.

Alone in the hub, Ianto brings in Japanese cybernetics expert Dr Tanizaki (Togo Igawa) down to a basement deep inside, home to Lisa Hallett (Caroline Chikezie), Ianto's girlfriend. Ianto and Lisa both worked Torchwood in London when Cybermen partially converted Lisa before their invasion ended. Ianto has since cared for her by placing her in the basement with a conversion unit to keep her alive. Ianto wants Tanizaki to reverse the process.

The episode was filmed as part of the third production block of the first series, along with eighth episode \"They Keep Killing Suzie\". Director James Strong wanted to film the episode in a sort of real time format. Filming largely took place at the Upper Boat Studios outside Pontypridd, where the Torchwood Hub set is located. The scene where Jack threatens to kill Ianto if he does not kill Lisa was the first scene to be shot. The flashback scene where Ianto finds a half-converted Lisa in Canary Wharf took a full day to film; it was originally supposed to take only a few hours, but the camera failed to record the scene. It was replaced, but the second camera failed to record also. Eve Myles and Burn Gorman were both trained how to handle guns and a torch like a \"secret agent.\" Strong noted that they both held the gun and torch in each hand like professionals."]}, {"page": "End of Days (Torchwood)", "response": ["During Gwen's (Eve Myles) morning off with her boyfriend Rhys (Kai Owen), they both see news reports of UFO sightings over the Taj Mahal, and an armed clash between CO19 officers and English civil war era soldiers.
