Having lived in Poland for several years, Hedley learned Polish and was able to translate and edit many of Chopin's letters, which had been collected and annotated by Bronislaw Edward Sydow, and which were published in 1962 as Selected Correspondence of Fryderyk Chopin.\nHedley was vice-president of the International Chopin Competition in 1949, the centenary of Chopin\u2019s death, and received the Commander\u2019s Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta.  He processed a considerable collection of Chopiniana, and died at Birmingham on 8 November 1969, aged 63, and is buried in Lodge Hill Cemetery.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin", "response": ["Chopin seldom performed publicly in Paris. In later years he generally gave a single annual concert at the Salle Pleyel, a venue that seated three hundred. He played more frequently at salons but preferred playing at his own Paris apartment for small groups of friends. The musicologist Arthur Hedley has observed that \"As a pianist Chopin was unique in acquiring a reputation of the highest order on the basis of a minimum of public appearances\u00a0\u2013 few more than thirty in the course of his lifetime.\" The list of musicians who took part in some of his concerts indicates the richness of Parisian artistic life during this period. Examples include a concert on 23 March 1833, in which Chopin, Liszt, and Hiller performed (on pianos) a concerto by J.S. Bach for three keyboards; and, on 3 March 1838, a concert in which Chopin, his pupil Adolphe Gutmann, Charles-Valentin Alkan, and Alkan's teacher Joseph Zimmermann performed Alkan's arrangement, for eight hands, of two movements from Beethoven's 7th symphony. Chopin was also involved in the composition of Liszt's Hexameron; he wrote the sixth (and final) variation on Bellini's theme. Chopin's music soon found success with publishers, and in 1833 he contracted with Maurice Schlesinger, who arranged for it to be published not only in France but, through his family connections, also in Germany and England."]}, {"page": "1905 in music", "response": ["*November 12 - Arthur Hedley, English musicologist (d.1905)"]}, {"page": "Polonaise-Fantaisie (Chopin)", "response": ["This work was slow to gain favour with musicians, due to its harmonic complexity and intricate form.  Arthur Hedley was one of the first critics to speak positively of the work, writing in 1947 that it 'works on the hearer's imagination with a power of suggestion equaled only by the F minor Fantasy or the fourth Ballade', although Arthur Rubinstein, Leff Pouishnoff, Claudio Arrau and Vladimir Horowitz had been including it in their programs some decades earlier."]}, {"page": "Roger Woodward", "response": ["During summer visits to London (1966\u201368), he prepared Chopin manuscripts owned by British musicologist Arthur Hedley-before including them in recitals at the Wigmore Hall and South Bank. In 1967, he played for Lina Prokofieva in Warsaw and soon was invited to perform with the Warsaw National Philharmonic Orchestra then throughout Poland.  Two years later, he toured extensively with the Wiener Trio performed in Cuba as guest of Casa de las Americas and at the Paris Jeunesses Musicales where the UNESCO Rostrum's two principal jury members: Yehudi Menuhin and Jack Lang, noticed Woodward's performances of his own compositions alongside works of J.S.
