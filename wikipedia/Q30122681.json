Keane reportedly said, \"I can't understand why people in Scotland rave about Darren Fletcher.\" However, Keane later attempted to set the record straight stating, \"If you listen to any of my comments over the last two or three years, if I've given any player credit over the years it would be Fletch. Fletch will tell you that himself.\" Fletcher went some way towards answering his critics on 6 November 2005, with his performance in the vital league match at home to Chelsea, scoring the only goal of the game with a looping header. His winning goal ended Chelsea's 40-match unbeaten run in the Premier League.", "|+ List of international goals scored by Darren Fletcher"]}, {"page": "List of British football commentators", "response": ["|Darren Fletcher "]}, {"page": "606 (radio show)", "response": ["* Darren Fletcher (2010\u20132016)", "In 2011\u201312, as Savage was taking part in Strictly Come Dancing, he was replaced on Saturdays by Jason Roberts.
