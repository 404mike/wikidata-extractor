The Doctor's first companions seen on screen were his granddaughter Susan Foreman (Carole Ann Ford) and her teachers Barbara Wright (Jacqueline Hill) and Ian Chesterton (William Russell). These characters were intended to act as audience surrogates, through which the audience would discover information about the Doctor who was to act as a mysterious father figure. The only story from the original series in which the Doctor travels alone is The Deadly Assassin (1976). Notable companions from the earlier series included Romana (Mary Tamm and Lalla Ward), a Time Lady; Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen); and Jo Grant (Katy Manning). Dramatically, these characters provide a figure with whom the audience can identify, and serve to further the story by requesting exposition from the Doctor and manufacturing peril for the Doctor to resolve. The Doctor regularly gains new companions and loses old ones; sometimes they return home or find new causes\u2014or loves\u2014on worlds they have visited.

Bridget was renamed Suzan/Suzanne Foreman, later changed to Susan, and writer Anthony Coburn made her the Doctor's granddaughter to avoid any possibility of sexual impropriety implicit in having a young girl travelling with an older man; Newman was reluctant about the idea, as he wanted the character to have human naivety. Miss McGovern later became history teacher Miss Canning, and Susan's birth name briefly became \"Findooclare\". When the show's bible was written, the two teachers were renamed Ian Chesterton and Barbara Wright. Chesterton was much more violent in earlier drafts of the script.

Edward Kelsey, who portrayed the slave buyer, was a long-term friend of Barry's, as the two had entered the television industry at the same time. Two guest actors had previously appeared in the show as extras: Tony Lambden, who portrayed the court messenger, was previously an extra in The Keys of Marinus; and Brian Proudfoot, who played Tigellinus, had previously acted as Hartnell's double for location filming in The Reign of Terror.

A journalist for The Times called Doctor Who \"the strongest weapon in the BBC armoury\", noting that The Romans \"promises well\" and describing the production as \"once again flawless\". At the BBC Programme Review Board, director of television Kenneth Adam praised Jacqueline Hill's performance in the second episode. Letters read out on Junior Points of View following the third episode noted historical inaccuracies in Ian's outfit. An audience report prepared following the serial's broadcast was negative, with criticism directed at the show's historical episodes; several felt that it looked corny and amateurish, though the performances of Hartnell and Francis were praised."]}, {"page": "The Crusade (Doctor Who)", "response": ["The Crusade is the sixth serial of the second season in the British science fiction television series Doctor Who.
