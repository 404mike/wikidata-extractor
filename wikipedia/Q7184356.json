Scott established himself as a mainstay in the midfields of John McClelland and Paul Sturrock. Nicknamed Fizzy, he was a member of Sturrock's 1996\u201397 squad that won promotion to the Scottish Premier Division.\nAfter eight years at McDiarmid Park, Scott moved south to join English club Sheffield Wednesday for a \u00a3100,000 fee.
