From 1931 to 1940, Dame Dorothy was a member of the Consultative Committee of the Board of Education.  From 1933-35, she was President of the Association of Headmistresses. During World War II, Brock led the evacuation of Mary Datchelor Girls School to Ashford then latterly to Llanelli.  She published a pamphlet called \"An Unusual Happening\" telling the story of the evacuation years. She was a much-loved and caring headmistress.  Many Old Girls of the school still talk about what a wonderful woman she was. Her contribution to the life of the school is also given coverage in 'The Story of the Mary Datchelor School 1877-1977'.  From 1951 to 1968, Brock was a director of the University of London Press.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Brock (surname)", "response": ["*Dorothy Brock (1886\u20131969), English teacher"]}, {"page": "Steamboat ladies", "response": ["* Dorothy Brock DBE (1886\u20131969), educationist and headmistress"]}, {"page": "Laurence Brock", "response": ["Brock was born in Islington, London to George William Frederick Brock, a clerk, and Eliza Jane Wilkins.1891 England Census His younger sister, Dorothy Brock, was a headmistress of the Mary Datchelor School,Janet Sondheimer, \"Brock, Dame (Madeline) Dorothy (1886\u20131969)\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004.

Scaliger and Bentley praised Manilius's handling of numbers in verse,Manilius & Housman (1920), p. 51. and the Harvard University Press later echoed this commendation, writing that he \"exhibit[s] great virtuosity in rendering mathematical tables and diagrams in verse form\", and that the poet \"writes with some passion about his Stoic beliefs and shows much wit and humour in his character sketches of persons born under particular stars\". Housman calls him \"facile and frivolous\" but also describes him as \"the one Latin poet who excelled even Ovid in verbal point and smartness\".Housman (1916), p. xix.Housman (1903), p. xxi. The poem, while metrically correct, has been noted for its technical language and unusual word choices.Hatch (2007), p. 735. The classicist Arthur Woollgar Verrall says that while \"at his best, Manilius may remind us of Lucretius\", the \"metre [that he uses] has the regular and monotonous flow of the age\". Jacobs, Monceaux, and others have attributed the Astronomica idiosyncrasies to Manilius's reported African origin; they suggest he wrote and spoke a form of Africitas \u2013 a putative African dialect of Latin \"with strongly marked peculiarities of vocabulary, syntax, sentence-structure, and style\" \u2013 thus explaining the poem's quirks.Wilfrid (1928), p. 73. Aside from the dubiously hypothesized presence of Africitas in the poem, however, M. Dorothy Brock argues there is very little evidence that Manilius was from Africa."]}, {"page": "Mary Datchelor School", "response": ["From 1918 to 1950, the headmistress was Dorothy Brock:", "* Dorothy Brock, former headmistress"]}, {"page": "Category talk:Steamboat ladies", "response": ["User:Pierrette13, thanks for creating this category.
