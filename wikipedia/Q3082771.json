The game took place at Cardigan Fields in Leeds, which a disappointing crowd of only 2,000 witnessed, and though Wales lost Simpson was reselected for the remaining two games of the 1884 Home Nations Championship. Wales lost again in the second game of the tournament against Scotland, but in the final match of the competition, in a home game at the Cardiff Arms Park, Simpson was given the captaincy. This was Simpson's last game but it resulted in a Welsh win with tries from Tom Clapp and William Norton. The 1884 match against Ireland which Simpson captained is often remembered because Ireland arrived two players short, and Wales supplied them with two replacements, both of whom became dual nationals as they also represented Wales."]}, {"page": "George Frederick Harding", "response": ["Harding first played rugby for Newport in 1877 during the founding years of the club.
