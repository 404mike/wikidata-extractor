He is now a coach for Lincoln City youth team and centre of excellence. He is best known as a right sided full-back, but can also play in midfield if needed. Throughout his career, West has been known as a committed and dedicated full back who loves to overlap with the winger in front of him and get forward at every opportunity.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Glen Little", "response": ["Little moved from Glentoran to Burnley in November 1996 for a \u00a3100,000 fee. After Stan Ternent's arrival at Turf Moor in summer 1998, he became a fixture in the right-wing slot, linking up especially well with full-back Dean West. In Burnley's 1999\u20132000 Second Division promotion season, Little scored a memorable goal at home to Bristol Rovers. He also helped Burnley beat Tottenham Hotspur in the League Cup in 2002 after a game-turning performance when brought on as a substitute. Little attracted attention during this time, and his club was reported to have turned down big money offers for his signature."]}, {"page": "Gareth McAuley", "response": ["However, when Dean West was dropped from the squad and club captain Paul Morgan sidelined with an injury, McAuley moved into central defence to partner Ben Futcher. He immediately drew the plaudits for his excellent performances, which included a man of the match display against Derby County. He thereafter battled for a starting centre back role with fellow giant Jamie McCombe for much of the season."]}, {"page": "Matt Bloomer", "response": ["The following season, Keith Alexander succeeded Alan Buckley as manager, and brought Bloomer in on a permanent deal. After signing permanently for Lincoln he was mainly a bit-part player, but nonetheless made nearly a century of appearances for the club. During the 2004\u20132005 season, he earned himself a starting place at right-back, replacing veteran Dean West. Bloomer was given his chance to start ahead of West for the League Cup first round match against Derby County. Lincoln won 3\u20131, Bloomer's performance was highly praised, and he went on to make a number of solid performances. He lost his starting place following an ill-fated first half against Wycombe Wanderers in early 2005. Bloomer moved from right back to central defensive position held by captain Paul Morgan, who was out with an injury, Wycombe scored three goals in the first 45 minutes, all from Nathan Tyson. He did not start again all season, with both Lee Beevers and Gareth McAuley playing in his position for the rest of the year, however, he did play as a striker in the play-off final in Cardiff, where Lincoln lost 2\u20130 after extra-time to Southend United. During the 2005\u201306 season, Bloomer found himself on the fringes of the Lincoln squad, and had spells on loan at former club Grimsby Town and Conference side Cambridge United."]}, {"page": "Paul Cook (footballer)", "response": ["After the end of the 2005/06 season, Cook was granted a testimonial by Accrington as a sign of appreciation for his efforts. The testimonial was played on 2 May 2006 at the Interlink Express (now the Wham) Stadium; Accrington against a Burnley Select XI featuring old teammates Dean West, Lenny Johnrose, Ian Cox, Kevin Ball and Cook's son Liam."]}, {"page": "Lee Roche", "response": ["In his first season, Roche wasn't a first team regular, despite scoring an outstanding 25-yard volley against Crystal Palace on his debut which although credited to him was a clear own goal. Towards the end of the 2003\u201304 season though, he began to push the previous right back, Dean West out of the side. Unfortunately for Roche, Ternent's contract wasn't renewed and Steve Cotterill was appointed as the new manager at Turf Moor. Cotterill did not rate Roche as highly as Ternent had done, and brought in Mike Duff from Cheltenham Town instead. Roche still featured in the team fairly regularly though, but out of position on the right side of midfield where he looked much less comfortable. Roche scored his only other Burnley goal in a famous 2\u20131 victory at Elland Road against Leeds United."]}, {"page": "Matt O'Halloran", "response": ["O'Halloran signed for King's Lynn in March 2005 following becoming disillusioned with professional football and became an integral part of the team that challenged for the Southern Premier league title where he was joined by former Boston United teammate Dean West. He also played a prominent role scoring important goals in the clubs FA cup run in the 2006/2007 season, culminating in their 2nd-round game being televised live on Sky Sports against his former club Oldham Athletic eventually losing 2-0. . He re-signed for Boston in August 2007 but after a positive start injuries took their toll and he underwent a double hernia operation in the latter stages of the season . He was offered a new contract by manager Tommy Taylor but instead chose to sign for Corby Town where he scored on debut in the opening game of the season. Injuries again played their part and limited his appearances in the second half of the season but he was a member of the Southern Premier league title winning side that season. He left Corby at the end of the 2008\u201309 season and joined his home town club Lincoln United alongside former Boston and King's Lynn teammate Steve Melton becoming a regular on the scoresheet from midfield. In October 2010, he joined Lincoln Moorlands Railway but persistent concerns with an ongoing back injury resulting in ruptured discs continued and he was forced to retire from competitive football at the age of 28. O'Halloran came out of retirement at the start of the 2013\u20132014 season having rejoined Lincoln United but overcoming the injuries proved difficult and following a stint at Sleaford Town he officially retired in October 2014.
