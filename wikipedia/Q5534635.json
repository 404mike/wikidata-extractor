Following periods on the News Chronicle and the Daily Herald, he was a senior journalist on the Daily Mirror from 1969 to 1986. Goodman was known as \"the doyen of industrial correspondents\" for his extensive contacts and prominent role covering British industrial disputes.\nHe was close to leading left-wing politicians including Harold Wilson, Frank Cousins, Aneurin Bevan and Michael Foot. He briefly served as an economic adviser to Wilson in 1975. After retiring from the Daily Mirror, Goodman was the founding editor of the quarterly British Journalism Review in 1989, and remained its editor until 2002.\nIn 2020, The Sunday Times uncovered his role as an agent of the StB, the intelligence agency of communist Czechoslovakia, with whom he had contact between 1955 and 1972. The newspaper reported on declassified intelligence archives stating that he received payments in return for providing information and analysis about the Labour Party, trade unions and Harold Wilson's government during his first term.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "September 5", "response": ["*  2013   \u2013 Geoffrey Goodman, English pilot, journalist, and author (b. 1922)"]}, {"page": "Winter of Discontent", "response": ["At a May 1978 Downing Street lunch with editors and reporters from the Daily Mirror, Callaghan asked if they believed it was possible that the planned Phase IV would succeed, as he believed it would if the unions and their members understood it was the best way to keep Labour in power. Most told him that it would be difficult, but not impossible. Geoffrey Goodman disagreed, saying in his view it would be impossible for the union leaders to keep their membership from demanding higher pay increases. \"If that is the case, then I will go over the heads of the trade union leadership and appeal directly to their members\u2014and the voters\", the prime minister responded. \"We have to hold the line on pay or else the government will fall.\", cited at L\u00f3pez, 60\u201361"]}, {"page": "Battle of Orgreave", "response": ["At an internal BBC meeting held on 19 June 1984, Peter Woon, the editor of BBC News, said there was \"a general feeling in the newsroom\" that the previous day's coverage of Orgreave had displayed \"a marginal imbalance\", while Alan Protheroe, the assistant director general of the BBC, admitted that \"the BBC's early evening coverage of Orgreave might not have been wholly impartial\". In 2009, Nicholas Jones, a former BBC journalist, said: \"I got ensnared by the seeming inevitability of the Thatcherite storyline that the mineworkers had to be defeated in order to smash trade union militancy.\" Jones said that the media may have been guilty of \"a collective failure of judgment\", and if its \"near-unanimous narrative had not been so hostile to the NUM and had done more to challenge government then Thatcher may have been forced to reach a negotiated settlement during the initial phase of the dispute\". Geoffrey Goodman, a former industrial editor for the Daily Mirror, said that \"the dominant media account\" had been \"hostile\" to the strikers, \"with much of the UK's mainstream media willingly 'marshalled by Downing Street to provide the propaganda that helped defeat the miners."]}, {"page": "Daily Mirror", "response": ["* Geoffrey Goodman (1969\u20131986)"]}, {"page": "News Chronicle", "response": ["In 1956, the News Chronicle opposed the UK's military support of Israel in invading the Suez canal zone, a decision which cost it circulation.

Foot's predecessor, James Callaghan, had offered Clements the chance to stand for Labour in a safe seat in East London in the 1979 general election. Clements had declined the offer, insisting on a selection ballot, which he lost narrowly. After Foot's resignation following Labour's landslide defeat in the 1983 general election, Clements continued in a similar role for the new leader, Neil Kinnock, although his title was officially that of \"executive officer\". It was said of Clements that he was \"Kinnock's closest ally and a shaper of Labour's strategies\". He retired from the position in 1987, although Geoffrey Goodman has speculated that he might have agreed to become \"Kinnock's Alastair Campbell\" had Labour won the 1992 general election.

The article though was modified without their consent, according to Goodman, and they insisted on changes approved by editor Mike Molloy.
