His work was included in two major retrospectives of British photography: \"Through the Looking Glass\" at the Barbican in 1990; and \"How We Are: Photographing Britain\" (whose title derived from his book) at Tate Britain in 2007. His work was featured, along with that of Peter Mitchell, in an exhibition and conference about British photography in the 1970s held at the University of Sussex in 2005, after he had donated much of his early work to their archives. Other work was also donated to the V&A collection, the National Portrait Gallery (including a print of his mother ) and Lincolnshire County Council, but he is not represented in the Arts Council's collections of photography.\nThe critic John Berger wrote in his introduction to How We Are: \"I can think of no comparable contemporary English work of literature or visual art which so gently, so persistently and so finally brings one face-to-face with the wretchedness of the kind of society in which we live: a society in which every personal meaning achieved by an individual is pitted against corporate meaninglessness; in which every personal need, expressed in terms of what is socially available, is in agonizing conflict with the origins of that need in the soul.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "David Hamilton (photographer)", "response": ["His photographs were in demand by other magazines such as R\u00e9alit\u00e9s, Twen and Photo. By the end of the 1960s, all of Hamilton's photographs appeared to have been snapped as if through a hazy mist. His further successes included dozens of photographic books with combined sales well into the millions; five feature films; countless magazine displays and museum and gallery exhibitions. His work was exhibited in every one of the first three years of The Photographers' Gallery, London, but were roundly condemned by Euan Duff for its \"cliched pictorial symbolism, exploiting soft focus, pastel colours, country landscapes and old houses, old fashioned clothes and even white doves to give a phoney impression of heaIth-food ad naturalness; they are a sort of wholemeal stoneground pornography,\" exhibited \"because the gallery needs the money.\"Euan Duff, 'Hamilton exhibition at the Photographers' Gallery,' The Guardian, Sat, Dec 1, 1973 p.10 In December 1977, Images Gallery\u2014a studio owned by Bob Persky at 11 East 57th Street in Manhattan\u2014showed his photographs at the same time that Bilitis was released. At that time art critic Gene Thornton wrote in The New York Times that they reveal \"the kind of ideal that regularly was expressed in the great paintings of the past\". Hamilton has said that his work looks for \"the candor of a lost paradise\". In his book, Contemporary Photographers, curator Christian Caujolle wrote that Hamilton worked only with two fixed devices: \"a clear pictorial intention and a latent eroticism, ostensibly romantic, but asking for trouble\".David Hamilton, photographer known for nude images of girls, dies at 83, The New York Times, 28 November 2016 "]}, {"page": "Peggy Duff", "response": ["After university she worked as a journalist and in 1933 married Bill Duff, a fellow journalist.
