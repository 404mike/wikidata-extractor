With Oldham struggling at the foot of the Third Division, Oldham paid Stoke \u00a35,000 so that they could register McIlroy as a player again. He signed several former Stoke City team-mates, including Bill Asprey, Alan Philpott, George Kinnell and Keith Bebbington. However McIlroy did not cope well with the pressure of management and resigned after losing 4\u20130 against Luton Town on the opening day of the 1968\u201369 season. He returned to Stoke City for a short while as assistant to Waddington before moving to Bolton Wanderers as coach and assistant to Nat Lofthouse. McIlroy had an 18-day spell in charge after Lofthouse's departure but resigned after just two matches on principle after being told by the board to sell players."]}, {"page": "Crossgates Primrose F.C.", "response": ["The club's best-known former players are Scotland legend Jim Baxter, who Crossgates sold to Raith Rovers for \u00a3200, and his second cousin George Kinnell."]}, {"page": "Jimmy Jones (comedian)", "response": ["Jones' catchphrase 'Kin' ell' was a play on words, derived from footballer George Kinnell."]}, {"page": "1964 Football League Cup Final", "response": ["For the Second leg at Filbert Street Stoke manager Tony Waddington had to change his goalkeeper with Leslie out with an ankle injury Bobby Irvine taking his place. He was unable to prevent Mike Stringfellow from scoring after six minutes following a defensive error. Stoke hit back and a perfect pass from Jimmy McIlroy cut through the Foxes\u2019 defence and Dennis Viollet levelled the scores. This put Stoke into the ascendency but then a nasty leg injury to Calvin Palmer saw him stretchered off and thus put Stoke down to 10 men. Leicester capitalised on the situation and before Palmer was able to get back on the pitch Gibson headed in a Howard Riley corner. With not long left Stoke pushed forward and left a too big a gap in defence and Dave Gibson made it 3\u20131. Stoke to their credit fought on and pulled one back through George Kinnell but it was too late as Leicester won the tie 3\u20132 giving them a 4\u20133 aggregate win and with it the League Cup.", "|||5|| George Kinnell", "|||5|| George Kinnell"]}, {"page": "1963\u201364 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["Stoke made a dream start to the 1963\u201364 season beating Tottenham Hotspur 2\u20131 at home on the opening match of the season, Jimmy McIlroy scoring both goals, and then accounting for Aston Villa 3\u20131 two days later. There followed though, a run of 10 matches without a win and Stoke found themselves at the wrong end of the table. Waddington was not happy with his defence and went out and bought Calvin Palmer from Nottingham Forest for \u00a330,000 and George Kinnell from Aberdeen for \u00a327,000 and another 'keeper Lawrie Leslie from West Ham United. On the other hand, he released Don Ratcliffe, and Ron Wilson. John Ritchie was introduced into the first team by October and he made an instant impression as he started scoring the first few of his 171 for the club. With Ritchie in full flow, things improved and in nine matches from early October to mid November, Stoke remained unbeaten.
