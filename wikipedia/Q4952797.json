At that time Upper and Lower Egypt had long been united with Men-nofer as the capital. The Flood is not fixed in historical time, and its being placed here tends to confirm the suspicion of some of the characters that it will be a merely local affair. The author cites several scholarly sources on Egypt and says that she has tried to avoid slips in the historical background, but \"if there are some, I shall make the cowardly excuse that most writers on ancient Egypt blandly disagree on detail, right down to the spelling of names\".Mollie Hunter, \"Author's Note\", The Moon in the Cloud, p. 7."]}, {"page": "Template talk:Authority control/Archive 2", "response": [":: Two authors conflated.
