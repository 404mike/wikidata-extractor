In 1909 she met Octavia Wilberforce, a young woman whose fervent desire to study medicine was thwarted by a family that felt intellectualism and professional careers were 'unsexing' for women. When Wilberforce's father not only refused to pay for her studies, but disinherited her for pursuing them, Robins and other friends provided financial and moral support until she became a physician.  While some have conjectured that Robins and Wilberforce were romantically involved, such insinuation has never been supported by the considerable scholarly material available about both women, nor is it born out in their own copious written material. All evidence points to Robins and Wilberforce enjoying a relationship much like that of mother and daughter. In her declining years she developed a friendship with Virginia and Leonard Woolf. Dr Wilberforce, the great-granddaughter of William Wilberforce, the British emancipator of slaves, looked after Robins until her death in 1952, just months shy of her 90th birthday.", "*Pat Jalland, ed., Octavia Wilberforce:The Autobiography of a Pioneer Woman Doctor"]}, {"page": "List of people from Brighton and Hove", "response": ["*Octavia Wilberforce, doctor, suffragist, founder of New Sussex Hospital for Women, and lifelong partner of Elizabeth Robins, had a home and medical practice in Montpelier Crescent"]}, {"page": "List of people from Sussex", "response": ["* Octavia Wilberforce (1888-1963), physician"]}, {"page": "Wilberforce (name)", "response": ["* Octavia Wilberforce (1888\u20131963), English physician"]}]}}
