Hodson was a right-handed batsman who bowled right-arm roundarm medium pace. He was born at Ditchling, Sussex.\nHodson made his first-class debut for Sussex against Kent in 1838. Sussex County Cricket Club was formed the following season, with Hodson playing in the team's first-class debut against the Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's. In total, he made 51 first-class appearances for Sussex, the last of which came against Surrey in 1854. He took 95 wickets with his roundarm bowling, at an average of 15.58. He took three five wicket hauls during his career, achieving best innings figures against the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1839. Hodson took 8 wickets in the Marylebone Cricket Club's first innings, though his exact bowling figures are not recorded. These figures made Hodson the first person to take a five wicket haul for Sussex County Cricket Club. With the bat, Hodson scored 554 runs at a batting average of 7.48, with a high score of 44. In addition to playing for Sussex, both before and after the county club was founded, Hodson appeared for an England XI, the Players and the All England Eleven.He died at Hunston Mill, near Hunston, Sussex on 17 March 1879.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ditchling", "response": ["* James Hodson \u2013 cricketer \u2013 was born in Ditchling"]}, {"page": "Hunston, West Sussex", "response": ["Cricketer James Hodson died at Hunston Mill in 1879."]}, {"page": "Royal New Ground", "response": ["Apart from first-class matches, the ground hosted a number of other matches. In 1845, the ground hosted two matches in benefit of fast-bowler George Brown. The first was a match between Sussex and an All England team, which was won by the All England team.  The second match was a Gentlemen v Players match which was heavily interrupted by rain, meaning only 85 runs were scored on the opening day's play.  In 1846, a match took place between the Zingari Club and the officers of the 12th Lancers regiment, which included Thomas Box, John Wisden and James Hodson. Box top scored in the officer's first innings, scoring 44 of the 110 runs.
