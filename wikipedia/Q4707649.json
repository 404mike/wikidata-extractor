The Independent James Wilson thought it \"perplexing\" and a \"seriously silly folly\". The Journal Tony Jones called it \"a visible but under-rated symbol of regional identity\". David Brandon described it in The Guardian as an \"extraordinary... symbol of the Earl of Durham's insanity and county pride\". The Northern Echo Chris Lloyd compared Penshaw Monument to the Angel of the North, calling both \"beautifully pointless\". Tony Henderson, also of The Journal, wrote that the lack of roof and interior walls \"has been to the advantage of the monument as it allows the dramatic play of light among the columns\". In her Monument Guide to England and Wales, Jo Darke called the monument \"a great northern landmark\"; architectural historians Gwyn Headley and Wim Meulenkamp have described its blackened surface as \"a satanic response to the pure white Hellenic ideal\". Nikolaus Pevsner wrote that \"the monument looms as an apparition of the Acropolis under hyperborian skies\". In his book The Northumbrians, historian Dan Jackson praised it: \"It is a building of great gravitas, and its austere Doric silhouette dominates the landscape for miles around.\""]}, {"page": "Chillingham Castle", "response": ["The current owners market the castle as being the most haunted castle in Britain.

Until the pub was sold by Vaux, it was said that the landlord would leave out a special tankard of ale each night after closing and, in the morning, it would be empty. Local DJ and TV presenter, Alan Robson drank from the tankard during one of his live Metro Radio shows, allegedly sparking off a series of supernatural phenomena that eventually forced the then landlord to quit.

In late 2008 with the album released, the band toured across the UK again twice, the first in September/October and the other in November.
