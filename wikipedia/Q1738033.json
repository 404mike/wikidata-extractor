There is a fire near the shepherds at left, where the family is headed. At the centre of the composition, Joseph holds a torch that illuminates Mary and the infant, who are riding an ass.  The heavily treed landscape behind them is almost black, its outline forming a diagonal across the sky and completely containing the foreground figures. The diagonal is echoed in the night sky by the intricate band of the Milky Way, and detailed configurations of stars are seen, including Ursa Major at far left. Elsheimer is thought to be the first painter to accurately depict constellations.Madlyn Millner Kahr (1993). Dutch painting in the seventeenth century. 2nd edition. Westview Press; pp. 94\u201395.  Another readily identifiable constellation is Leo, above the Holy Family, with its brightest star, Regulus, in the centre of the picture. It has been proposed that Elsheimer reworked the painting in 1610, after the publication of Galileo's Sidereus Nuncius, which showed the Milky Way as composed of individual stars and showed the Moon's surface in unprecedented detail. This hypothesis has been contested by Elsheimer scholar Keith Andrews."]}, {"page": "Sabine Kalter", "response": ["Sabine Kalter (28 March 1889 in Jaros\u0142aw \u2013 1 September 1957 in London) was a British mezzo-soprano singer, mostly operatic.
