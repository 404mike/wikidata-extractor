Previously he had been the Minister of State for Government Policy from 2010.During the Second May ministry in 2019, Letwin rebelled against leading Eurosceptics within the Conservative Party by tabling a cross-party motion to hold \"indicative votes\", allowing MPs to vote on several Brexit options in order to establish whether any could command a majority in the House of Commons; it transpired that none of them could. Letwin sought to extend Article 50 through passing the Cooper\u2013Letwin Act. In August 2019 he announced that he would stand down at the next election. On 3 September 2019, he lost the Conservative party whip and sat as an independent MP after that.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ann Widdecombe", "response": ["In the 2005 leadership election, she initially supported Kenneth Clarke again.
