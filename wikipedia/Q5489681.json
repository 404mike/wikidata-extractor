The P\u00e9tard moniker was originated by Ralph P. Boas, Frank Smithies and other Princeton mathematicians who were aware of the Bourbaki project; inspired by them, the Princeton mathematicians published an article on the \"mathematics of lion hunting\". After meeting Boas and Smithies, Weil composed the wedding announcement which contained several mathematical puns.
