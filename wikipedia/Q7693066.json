He also frequently performs his own versions of well-known songs in a similarly listless style. His act has left audiences bemused or hostile, with heckling a frequent occurrence during his performances.\nHis deadpan style has won him a small number of devoted followers. Stewart Lee has often cited Chippington as the reason he began stand-up comedy, describing Chippington's act as \"a mixture of surrealism and insolent provocation and uncompromising boredom\" and citing him as \"the first post-alternative comedian\". Another admirer, Richard Herring, talks of Chippington's \"contempt for the very idea of jokes\". For his part Chippington \u2013 who describes his own act as being influenced by Lenny Bruce and Owd Grandad Piggott \u2013 says he is an \"anti-comedian\" and that he only started doing his act \"to annoy people\". He has even claimed that his main reason for retiring from the stage in the 1990s was that he was becoming too popular.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of comedians", "response": ["* Ted Chippington (born 1960)"]}, {"page": "List of British comedians", "response": ["*Ted Chippington (born 1962)"]}, {"page": "Stewart Lee", "response": ["His influences include Ted Chippington, Jerry Sadowitz, Simon Munnery, Kevin McAleer and Johnny Vegas.", "Lee's influences include Ted Chippington, Jerry Sadowitz, Simon Munnery, Kevin McAleer and Johnny Vegas."]}, {"page": "Stonehenge Free Festival", "response": ["The stage hosted many bands including Hawkwind, Gong,  Doctor and the Medics, Flux of Pink Indians, Buster Blood Vessel, Omega Tribe, Crass, The Damned, Killing Joke, The Selecter, Dexys Midnight Runners, Thompson Twins, Bronz, The Raincoats, The 101ers with Joe Strummer, Jeremy Spencer & the Children of God, Brent Black Music Co-op, Killerhertz, Mournblade, Amazulu, Wishbone Ash, Man, Benjamin Zephaniah, Inner City Unit, Here and Now, Cardiacs, The Enid, Roy Harper, Jimmy Page, Ted Chippington, Zorch and Ozric Tentacles, Vince pie and the crumbs, which all played for free."]}, {"page": "The Nightingales", "response": ["* \"Rocking With Rita (Head To Toe)\" 1986 (with We've Got a Fuzzbox and We're Gonna Use It and Ted Chippington; credited as The Vindaloo Summer Special)"]}, {"page": "Lee and Herring", "response": ["The pair performed a short set at London's Bloomsbury Theatre on 5 February 2007 as part of a tribute to stand-up comedian Ted Chippington."]}, {"page": "Man in a Suitcase", "response": ["British comedian Ted Chippington's 1986 debut album on Birmingham's Vindaloo record label was also entitled Man in a Suitcase."]}, {"page": "We've Got a Fuzzbox and We're Gonna Use It", "response": ["In the summer of 1986 the band teamed up with their Vindaloo Records labelmates The Nightingales and Ted Chippington to record a single \"Rocking with Rita (Head to Toe)\".
