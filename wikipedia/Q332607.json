As a member of Parliament from 1974 to 1988, he served several ministerial roles in Margaret Thatcher's government, including Home Secretary from 1983 to 1985.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "September 25", "response": ["*1939 \u2013 Leon Brittan, English lawyer and politician, Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills (d. 2015)"]}, {"page": "2015", "response": ["* January 21 \u2013 Leon Brittan, British politician (b. 1939)"]}, {"page": "Michael Heseltine", "response": ["Heseltine resisted demands by Leon Brittan, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury with whom he already enjoyed a somewhat antagonistic relationship, that central government have power to cap the spending of local authorities. He argued that the worst offenders were the large metropolitan counties (which, ironically, he had helped to create a decade earlier) and that the simplest solution was simply to abolish them. In the event, the 1983 manifesto, after Heseltine had moved to his next job, committed the Conservatives both to abolition of the metropolitan boroughs and to rate capping. When Heseltine objected after the election, Thatcher gave him \"one of the most violent rebukes I have ever witnessed in Cabinet\" according to Jim Prior, who believed that the issue helped fuel the hostility between Heseltine and Thatcher and Brittan, which would later exhibit itself as the Westland Affair.Crick 1997, pp. 215\u20136.", "In mid-October Heseltine suggested a European consortium (which would include French Aerospatiale, German MBB and Italian Agusta). The new Trade and Industry Secretary Leon Brittan at first urged Thatcher to consider a European option (Heseltine later said Brittan preferred this option, although Brittan denied this). The Government was officially neutral (i.e. arguing that it was a matter for Westland directors and shareholders) but by November Heseltine was pushing the European option hard. In late November Peter Levene, Chief of Procurement, had a meeting at the Ministry of Defence with his French, German and Italian counterparts (the National Armaments Directors) and the representatives of the consortium, and agreed to \"buy European\" for certain classes of helicopters, although Heseltine was not actually present. The meeting was later praised by the House of Commons Defence Select Committee. Thatcher, who only learned of the meeting through Cuckney, was displeased, as were Brittan and the Treasury, who thought the US option might be cheaper.Crick 1997, pp. 277\u20138."]}, {"page": "Moors murders", "response": ["Hindley was told that she should spend twenty-five years in prison before being considered for parole. The Lord Chief Justice agreed with that recommendation in 1982, but in January 1985 Home Secretary Leon Brittan increased her tariff to thirty years. By that time Hindley claimed to be a reformed Catholic. Downey's mother was at the centre of a campaign to ensure that Hindley was never released from prison, and until her death in February 1999, she regularly gave television and newspaper interviews whenever Hindley's release was rumoured. In February 1985, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher told Brittan that his proposed minimum sentences of thirty years for Hindley and forty years for Brady were too short, saying, \"I do not think that either of these prisoners should ever be released from custody. Their crime was the most hideous and cruel in modern times.\""]}, {"page": "Home Secretary", "response": ["| Leon Brittan"]}, {"page": "John Smith (Labour Party leader)", "response": ["Smith was appointed Shadow Chancellor by Neil Kinnock in July 1987 following the Labour Party's general election defeat.Stuart, p. 143. Despite a quiet, modest manner and his politically moderate stance, he was a witty, often scathing speaker. Smith was named as Parliamentarian of the Year twice: first in November 1986 for his performances during the Westland controversy during which Leon Brittan resigned, and the second time in November 1989 for taking Nigel Lawson to task over the state of the economy and over his difficult relationship with Sir Alan Walters, the Prime Minister's economic adviser.Stuart, pp. 138\u2013139, 161. Smith made two notably witty attacks on Lawson that year. On 7 June 1989, he sang the theme tune for the soap Neighbours at the dispatch box, lampooning the differences between Lawson and Walters, who was critical of Lawson's policies but whom Thatcher refused to sack.Stuart, p. 159. Then, on 24 October, he made another scathing attack on the differences.Stuart, p. 160. Two days later, Lawson resigned, followed shortly afterwards by Walters."]}, {"page": "William Hague", "response": ["Hague contested Wentworth unsuccessfully in 1987, before being elected to Parliament at a by-election in 1989 as Member for the safe Conservative seat of Richmond, North Yorkshire, where he succeeded former Home Secretary Leon Brittan. Following his election he became the then-youngest Conservative MP and despite having only recently become an MP, Hague was invited to join the Government in 1990, serving as Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Norman Lamont. After Lamont was sacked in 1993, Hague moved to the Department of Social Security (DSS) where he was Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State. The following year he was promoted as Minister of State in the DSS with responsibility for Social Security and Disabled People. His fast rise up through Government ranks was attributed to his intelligence and debating skills."]}, {"page": "Norman Lamont", "response": ["At Cambridge, he was a contemporary of Michael Howard, Kenneth Clarke, Leon Brittan, and John Gummer, all of whom became leading figures in the Conservative Party.
