Time magazine wrote that Baron-Cohen \"most dramatically wandered into fraught territory in 2003, when he published the book The Essential Difference, which called autism a manifestation of an extreme 'male brain'--one that's 'predominantly hard-wired for understanding and building systems,' as opposed to a 'female brain,' one that's 'predominantly hard-wired for empathy'--and ended up on the wrong side of the debate on science and sex differences.\" A book review published in the journal Nature, wrote:\"The idea that males are more interested in systemizing than females merits serious consideration\u00a0...\u00a0It is unquestionably a novel and fascinating idea that seems likely to generate a rich empirical body of literature as its properties are tested. The second part of the theory\u2014that females are more empathic than males\u2014is more problematic ... Other measures, however, show that males are highly socially skilled.\"Others criticize the original EQ and SQ, which form most of the research basis behind the notions of empathising and systemising. Both measure more than one factor, and sex differences exist on only some of the factors. Other critics argue that the work has focused only on higher-functioning individuals with autism spectrum disorders, and requires independent replication with broader samples. Isabelle Rapin and Helen Tager-Flusberg said about the theory; Isabelle Rapin\u00a0...\u00a0finds Dr. Baron-Cohen's theory \"provocative\" but adds that \"it does not account for some of the many neurological features of the disorder, like the motor symptoms [such as repetitive movements and clumsiness], the sleep problems or the seizures.\" Others worry that the term \"extreme male brain\" could be misinterpreted. Males are commonly associated with \"qualities such as aggression,\" says Helen Tager-Flusberg\u00a0...\u00a0\"What's dangerous is that's the inference people will make: Oh, these are extreme males.\""]}, {"page": "Video self-modeling", "response": ["Video self-modeling (VSM) is a form of observational learning in which individuals observe themselves performing a behavior successfully on video, and then imitate the targeted behavior. VSM allows individuals to view themselves being successful, acting appropriately, or performing new tasks. Peter Dowrick, a key researcher in the development of self-modeling, described two forms of VSM, feedforward and self-review. Self-review involves someone with a relatively well developed skill watching examples of best performance.Dowrick, P. W. & Biggs, J. (1983), Using Video: Psychological and social applications (1st ed.), New York: Wiley A good example of this is the procedure used by Laura Wilkinson, gold medal platform diver, prior to every meet. In an interview after her gold medal performance, she was asked how she prepares for competition.National Broadcasting Corporation (2000, September, 24). Laura Wilkinson gold medal interview - Sydney games. New York: NY. She said that she watches a video that consists of her best dives along with encouragement from family and coaches. Self-review is mainly used in sports training as a form of visual imaging.Buggey, T. (2009). Seeing is Believing: Self-modeling Applications with Children with Autism and Other Developmental Disabilities. Baltimore; Woodbine House. Feedforward, on the other hand, is used with people who do not have a skill or when a new skill is emerging. Thus, feedforward is the method most often used in instructional or clinical settings. Because Feedforward involves new skills or behaviors performed by the viewer, it usually requires some degree of video editing to make it appear that the viewer is performing in an advanced manner. The term feedforward can be contrasted with the more traditional term feedback as it relates to receiving information about performance. Feedback allows people to see how they are doing. Feedforward allows them to see how they could be performing; a future self. Feedforward is mainly used in education and therapy circles and mainly with children with disabilities. It has been found to be especially effective with children with autism who tend to be visual learners and who seem to attend better to monitors than to live models.Bauman, M. L.  (1999).
