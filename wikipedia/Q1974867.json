He signed for the League One side in July 2004 with fellow former Everton trainee Steven Schumacher, with whom he lived during his spell at Bradford. Symes made his Bradford debut in a 2\u20131 defeat at Hartlepool United on the opening day of the 2004\u201305 season. Three days later he missed a late penalty which would have secured Bradford victory over Peterborough United in a game in which Symes was also booked. Symes was dropped from the first team after Bradford signed Dele Adebola. When Bradford were allowed special dispensation to sign Neil Roberts, Bradford tried to give Symes a loan transfer to Darlington but the deal was blocked by the Football League. The following month, Symes scored his first goals for Bradford when he came off the bench at half-time to score twice in a 3\u20131 victory over Sheffield Wednesday on 23 October 2004. They were the only goals he scored that season from just 15 games."]}, {"page": "Neil Roberts", "response": ["Neil Roberts may refer to:", "*Neil Roberts (actor) (born 1964), English actor", "*Neil Roberts (anarchist) (1960\u20131982), activist who killed himself when he bombed the New Zealand police database", "*Neil Roberts (Australian footballer) (born 1933), Australian rules footballer", "*Neil Roberts (basketball) (born 1945), former American basketball coach", "*Neil Roberts (politician) (born 1955), Australian politician", "*Neil Roberts (author) (born 1946), English professor and author", "*Neil Roberts (racing driver), NASCAR Cup Series driver; see 1953 Southern 500", "*Neil Roberts (Welsh footballer) (born 1978)", "*Dr. Neil Roberts, fictional character from American TV series The OC"]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 Welsh Premier League", "response": ["*  Neil Roberts (Rhyl FC)", "| Neil Roberts", "| Neil Roberts"]}]}}
