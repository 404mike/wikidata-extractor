After two loan spells at Stafford Rangers and one at Nantwich Town, he signed permanently with Stafford in 2010. He soon switched clubs to Hednesford Town, before joining Kidsgrove Athletic in 2011. He switched to Leek Town in July 2012, and joined New Mills in December 2012. He moved on to Nantwich Town the following year, before playing for Witton Albion.

However, he was transfer listed by new manager Micky Adams in August 2009, along with five other youngsters, having failed to impress in the pre-season. He swiftly joined Conference National side Salisbury City on a one-month loan deal, along with fellow \"Valiant\" Luke Prosser. He made his debut for the \"Whites\" as a substitute in a 1\u20130 defeat to Mansfield Town at the Raymond McEnhill Stadium, former Vale teammate Kyle Perry was the goalscorer. He played seven games, mostly as a substitute, before returning to Vale Park. By mid-November, his impressive performances in the reserves showed a new 'appetite for the game', and earned him a place on the first-team bench. Before the month was out he was loaned out Rochdale, also of League Two. He returned to the Vale in early January, having played just two games as a late substitute, totalling just 25 minutes on the field. His opportunities at Spotland were limited by an in-form strike force and match postponements due to poor weather. Rochdale did not extend the loan spell, reportedly due to financial difficulties. However Glover said that the loan spell helped to boost his confidence. He still received abuse from some at Vale Park though, almost a year after his father's departure. In March 2010 he was informed that he would not be offered a new contract at the Vale at the end of the season, along with fellow youth graduates Luke Prosser and Ross Davidson. He and Davidson immediately joined local Conference North side Stafford Rangers on loan."]}, {"page": "Steve Thompson (footballer, born 1989)", "response": ["During a 2009\u201310 pre-season friendly with Nantwich Town, Thompson was dismissed for violent conduct, shoulder-barging an opposition player in an off-the-ball incident.

Early the next month local Conference North side Stafford Rangers enquired about Thompson's availability, after fellow Vale youngster Ross Davidson performed well in his loan spell. A one-month loan deal was quickly agreed.
