He introduced strict training methods to the club, the emphasis being on fitness, using activities such as running and gymnastics. These were combined with relaxed sessions of snooker and billiards. The \"Valiants\" were in the Third Division North, and had spent the majority of the 1935\u201336 season without a manager. He signed winger Gerry Kelly from Chester; right-half Tommy Ward from Grimsby Town; and left-half Spencer Evans from Altrincham. He also traded George Stabb to Bradford Park Avenue for Tom Nolan. Results began poorly, and so Cresswell signed inside-forward Alfred Dickinson from Everton. Vale then became hard to beat, and remained undefeated for thirteen matches between 24 October and 2 January, with central player Fred Obrey proving to be a revelation. The team were in fourth place at the turn of the year, however results then tailed off, and Cresswell left the club after the campaign ended with an eleventh-place finish."]}, {"page": "1936\u201337 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["The season opened with two defeats, as Vale found it tough to acclimatize to third tier football, their 3\u20131 home defeat to Hull City came despite them doing the double over the \"Tigers\" the previous season. Following this, George Stabb transferred to Bradford Park Avenue, in a deal which saw Tom Nolan return to The Old Recreation Ground. Continuing their poor form, by the end of September they were seventh from bottom. This prompted Cresswell to sign inside-forward Alfred Dickinson from Everton. On 26 September, Nolan scored a hat-trick past Stockport County, but the Vale would have to wait a little longer before getting into their stride. Seven changes were made for the 24 October win over Hartlepools United, and the wait would be worth it, as Vale then went on a thirteen-game unbeaten run. Nevertheless, Cresswell continued to travel the country in the hunt for talented young amateurs. By the end of October the 40,000 Shilling Fund completed its mission. With Ward scoring two hat-tricks during the spell, Michael Curley and George Heywood were judged as surplus to requirements, and moved on to Colwyn Bay and Southport respectively. Fred Obrey also proved to be a revelation in the centre of the pitch.", "|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Alfred Dickinson", "| September 1936 || FW ||  || Alfred Dickinson || Everton || Free transfer || ", "| October 1936 || FW ||  || Alfred Dickinson || Everton || Free transfer || "]}]}}
