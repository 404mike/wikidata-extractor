Going beyond the classical music of the late eighteenth century, Chopin's later music revitalised and transcended the brilliant style in several ways: in the first set of \u00c9tudes Op. 10, he introduced new highly concentrated contrapuntal elements; in the Nocturnes, the brilliant effects evolved into a mature ornamental melodic style; and, most importantly, he was able to imbue his works with an over-arching harmonic structure, effortlessly alternating lyrical and virtuosic passages. At the beginning of the 1830s, Chopin thus succeeded in moulding the Viennese multi-movement classical style with the subsequent brilliant style. From that period, sonata form can be discerned in Ballade No. 1 and the brilliant style in Scherzo No. 1. In the same way, Chopin's two late fantaisies breathed new life into the classical keyboard fantasia. For the extended mature works the historical genre titles\u2014\"ballade\", \"scherzo\", or \"fantaisie\"\u2014clearly had significance for Chopin; however, as Chopin scholar Jim Samson comments, \"ultimately he transcended them\"."]}, {"page": "D\u00e9nes Kov\u00e1cs", "response": ["Jim Samson, reviewing his recording of Bart\u00f3k's Violin Concerto No. 2 and Rhapsodies No. 1 and No. 2 with the Budapest Symphony Orchestra conducted by Ervin Lukacs, describes both performances as \"distinguished\", especially the \"cogent, well-shaped performance\" of the concerto; however, he characterises the first movement as \"uncomfortably fast\", preferring Szerying's version.
