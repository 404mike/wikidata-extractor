In a series of articles published in the 1970s, he considered the relationship between nation-states and multinational firms, detailing their role in the creation of an international division of labor. Hymer argued that this hierarchal division of labor was a macrocosm of the internal division of labor reproduced within the multinational corporation. Hymer did not believe that these firms had become more powerful than nation-states; instead, multinationals were firmly rooted in the major financial centers of the world, and they tended to reinforce existing geographic and spatial boundaries and dependencies.

His work in this area is part of a broader approach to economics known as institutionalist political economy which places economic history and socio-political factors at the centre of the evolution of economic practices."]}, {"page": "Newport High School, Bettws Lane", "response": ["* Prof Robert Rowthorn, professor of economics from 1991 to 2006 at the University of Cambridge"]}, {"page": "List of Marxian economists", "response": ["|Robert Rowthorn"]}, {"page": "Bob Rowthorn", "response": ["#RedirectRobert Rowthorn"]}, {"page": "List of socialist economists", "response": ["* Robert Rowthorn"]}, {"page": "Institutional complementarity", "response": ["Ugo Pagano and Robert RowthornPagano U (1992) Organizational equilibria and production efficiency.

In their models the technological choices take as parameters property rights arrangements whereas the latter are made on the basis of given technologies. The complementarities of technologies and property rights create two different sets of organizational equilibria. For instance, strong rights of the capital owners and a technology with a high intensity of specific and difficult to monitor capital are likely be institutional complements and define one possible organizational equilibrium. However, also strong workers' rights and a technology characterized by a high intensity of highly specific labor can be institutional complements and define an alternative organizational equilibrium. The organizational equilibria approach integrate the approach of Oliver Williamson,Williamson O E (1985) The economic institutions of capitalism.

The complementarities existing in the different organizational equilibria integrate both directions of causation in a single analytical framework.
