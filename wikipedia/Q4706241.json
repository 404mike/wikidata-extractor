He produced some 78 recordings, for example from his later repertoire: \"I've Got a Lovely Bunch of Coconuts\". He produced recordings at film studios for actors who could not sing. He met the band leader Billy Cotton, who was to change his career forever.\nBreeze started with Billy Cotton in 1932, without a contract, and stayed for 36 years. He became one of the most popular UK vocalists, on radio, television and in theatres around the United Kingdom. His recordings are still occasionally heard on the radio.\nAlan Breeze died in January 1980 in Norwich aged 70.", "link_mentions": {}}}
