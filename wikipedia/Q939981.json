In 1921 he entered Corpus Christi College, Cambridge University, to read classics, but he switched to natural sciences, taking his degree in 1924 and finishing in 1925, then taking a position at Kew Gardens. He became an expert on tropical Asian botany and on entomology.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of botanists by author abbreviation (A)", "response": ["* Airy Shaw \u2013 Herbert Kenneth Airy Shaw (1902\u20131985)"]}, {"page": "Airy Shaw", "response": ["#REDIRECT Herbert Kenneth Airy Shaw"]}, {"page": "Herbert Airy Shaw", "response": ["#REDIRECTHerbert Kenneth Airy Shaw"]}, {"page": "Emblingia", "response": ["Placement of the genus within a family has previously been considered a difficult problem; it has at various times been placed in Capparaceae, Sapindaceae, Goodeniaceae and, in the Cronquist system, Polygalaceae.
