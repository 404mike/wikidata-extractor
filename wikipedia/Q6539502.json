Douglas was on the bench when Forfar Athletic beat Rangers 2\u20131 on 3 August 2013, in the first round of the Scottish League Cup, a match that Forfar claimed was arguably the biggest result in their history. On 8 September 2013, Douglas returned for Celtic to play one match as keeper in Celtic's charity match in honour of Stiliyan Petrov. Douglas took over in goal for the Loons at the start of November after injury ruled usual first choice Darren Hill out for a few weeks. Douglass would go on to be named in the 2014\u20132015 PFA League 1 Team of the Year. Douglas played a crucial role in Forfar's promotion challenge in the 14/15 season as they made it into the championship play off final defeating Alloa 3\u20131 in the first leg but eventually crashing out in a 3\u20130 defeat in the second leg, the second goal of which Douglas gave the ball away to Liam Buchanan following a miscommunication with Darren Dods for him to strike into a near enough open net. Following the sacking of manager Dick Campbell in December 2015, Douglas quit the Station Park side in protest."]}, {"page": "2006\u201307 Scottish Second Division", "response": ["| Liam Buchanan || style=\"text-align:center;\"|20 ||Cowdenbeath "]}, {"page": "2007\u201308 Scottish First Division", "response": ["| Liam Buchanan"]}, {"page": "2005\u201306 Scottish Third Division", "response": ["|style=\"text-align:left;\"| Liam Buchanan"]}, {"page": "2007\u201308 Partick Thistle F.C. season", "response": ["|Liam Buchanan||28||3||14||0||0", "|Liam Buchanan||11||3||0||0||14"]}]}}
