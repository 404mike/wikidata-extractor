He appeared with Georgie Fame and the Blue Flames and Manfred Mann in the mid-1960s, and then with Soft Machine and Keef Hartley, as well as playing on albums by Nick Drake and John Martyn. Dobson played the flute solo on Manfred Mann's \"Pretty Flamingo\". Dobson also played on a number of sessions for The Small Faces, including their Ogden's Nut Gone Flake LP, and the track \"The Autumn Stone\" (released after the group split in 1969), and he performed live with them during 1968. He also subsequently guested on Humble Pie's debut album As Safe As Yesterday Is (1969), on which he also played sitar.\nHe released an album, Jam Sandwich, on Fresh Air Records in 1974.After the 1970s, he worked in theatre, dance, drama, multimedia, music teaching and music therapy. In the 1990s, Dobson recorded two albums with the Third Ear Band.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Manfred Mann", "response": ["The group had managed an initial jazz/rhythm-and-blues fusion, and then had taken chart music in their stride\u2014but could not hope to cope with Paul Jones' projected solo career as singer and actor, and with Mike Vickers' orchestral and instrumental ambitions. Jones intended to go solo once a replacement could be found, but stayed with the band for another year, during which Vickers left. McGuinness moved to guitar, his original instrument, contributing the distinctive National Steel Guitar to \"If You Gotta Go, Go Now\" and \"Pretty Flamingo\", and was replaced on bass by Jack Bruce, who had been playing for the Graham Bond Organisation for some time before a recent brief stint with John Mayall's Bluesbreakers. In his brief tenure before leaving to form Cream, Bruce played on \"Pretty Flamingo\" and on the EP Instrumental Asylum (for which he and wind instrumentalists Henry Lowther and Lyn Dobson were included in the sleeve photo of the group), which began the group's experiments with instrumental versions of chart songs. Bruce was replaced by Klaus Voormann. The band changed record companies just afterward, although EMI quickly released an EP of earlier unissued 1963\u201366 era songs titled As Was (a play on the title of their then new 1966 album, As Is), a hits compilation; Mann Made Hits (1966), an instrumental compilation LP that included one unissued instrumental track; Soul of Mann (1967); and, most controversially, used session players to complete the unfinished track \"You Gave Me Somebody To Love\" (c/w 'Poison Ivy\"\u2014both sung by Paul Jones) which made No. 36 in the UK singles chart, upsetting the group\u2014hence McGuinness's wry comment \"Manfreds disown new single\" on the sleeve of their next studio album for their new record label."]}, {"page": "Soft Machine", "response": ["In December 1968, to fulfill contractual obligations, Soft Machine re-formed with former road manager and composer Hugh Hopper on bass added to Wyatt and Ratledge and recorded their second album, Volume Two (1969), which started a transition toward jazz fusion. In May 1969 this line-up acted as the uncredited backing band on two tracks of The Madcap Laughs, the debut album by Syd Barrett. In 1969 the trio was expanded to a septet with the addition of four horn players, though only saxophonist Elton Dean remained beyond a few months, the resulting Soft Machine quartet (Wyatt, Hopper, Ratledge and Dean) running through Third (1970) and Fourth (1971), with various guests, mostly jazz players (Lyn Dobson, Nick Evans, Mark Charig, Jimmy Hastings, Roy Babbington, Rab Spall). Fourth was the first of their fully instrumental albums and the last one featuring Wyatt.", "| Lyn Dobson, Nick Evans, Jimmy Hastings, Rab Spall"]}, {"page": "Ogdens' Nut Gone Flake", "response": ["At some point during the sessions the group also cut a cover version of The Ronettes' \"Be My Baby\" - a track which, in contemporary interviews in the UK music press preceding the LP's release, was declared by Marriott to be included on side one. Although an early version of the LP that included this track was alleged to exist in acetate form, by the time of the LP's release in May the track had been excised and remained unreleased. Like the band's own version of \"If You Think You're Groovy\", it is now thought to be lost. One of the few songs not recorded at Olympic Studios for the LP was the track \"The Journey\", recorded at Trident Studios in London in February (with Ronnie Lane and Steve Marriott switching their usual instruments to play guitar and bass, respectively). Album sessions wrapped on 3 April (two days before the release of the \"Lazy Sunday\" / \"Rollin' Over\" single) at Olympic with the recording of \"Mad John\", and the out-take \"A Collibosher\" (which was again later released on the posthumous compilation The Autumn Stone). As was usual for Immediate label recordings at this time, other artists on the label's roster such as P.P.

While a large part of the finished product is essentially a live recording, parts involve tape collage and speeding up, slowing down, looping and backwards playing of tapes, the ending being the most memorable part, where two different treatments of the same basic riff (one from the live concert, the other, at double speed, from Spaced) are heard simultaneously, backwards.
