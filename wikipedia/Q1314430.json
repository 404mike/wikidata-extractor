This exclusion was seen as acceptable by individuals like John Westlake, a professor of international law at the University of Cambridge at the time, who commented that countries with European civilisations should be who comprises the international society, and that countries like Turkey and Persia should only be allowed a part of international law. The figurative superiority resulting from the rise of \"European Civilization\" and the labels of \"civilized\" and \"uncivilized\" are partly responsible for eurocentrism's denial of Islamic social evolution, giving westerners the advantage of an early dismissal of such ideas regarding Oriental civilisations through comparisons to the West. Along with that, the rooted belief of the inferiority of non-white and non-Europeans has given justification for racial discrimination and discredit to the Islamic world, with much of these feelings still present today."]}, {"page": "Tobias Asser", "response": ["Asser co-founded the Revue de Droit International et de L\u00e9gislation Compar\u00e9e with John Westlake and Gustave Rolin-Jaequemyns.
