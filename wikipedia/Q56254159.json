That same July Helen Archer began an affair with him despite knowing he was married. Only 3 months later and despite passionate pleas from Helen, he ended it  to \"make a go of things\" with his wife, Jess (Rina Mahoney). Jess moved in on Halloween but left Ambridge in December after a disastrous cocktail party and went back to Hampshire, leaving Rob. Helen resumed her affair with Rob on New Year's Day 2014. During their engagement Jess had a baby, which she claimed was Rob's until he consented to a DNA test, which proved otherwise, and they were soon divorced. Rob and Helen married secretly on the Isle of Wight in August 2015. It was then that Rob revealed himself to be manipulative, controlling and emotionally abusive. Over the next few months he isolated Helen from her family and friends, employing gaslighting methods to persuade her that she was the one who was being problematic and even made plans to send Henry to boarding school without Helen's knowledge or consent, with the assistance of his mother, Ursula (played by Carolyn Jones), herself a victim of coercive control at the hands of Rob's father, Bruce (Michael Byrne). In April 2016, after the secret intervention of her friend, Kirsty Miller, Helen secretly met Jess, who revealed the true nature of her marriage with Rob, before stabbing Rob in a moment of clarity, after he placed a knife in her hand and goaded her to commit suicide, as he refused to let her and Henry leave the house. Rob barely survived the encounter. Subsequently Rob and his mother tricked Pat and Tony into handing Henry over to them, forcing them into a lengthy legal battle over custody. After a long and intense trial, during which the truth of Rob's abusive nature was exposed publicly, as well as the revelation that he had raped Helen, she was acquitted on both counts of attempted murder and Grievous Bodily Harm. Subsequently Rob found himself becoming a pariah in the village, with Usha evicting him from the house he rented from her, Oliver banning him from the hunt, local shops refusing his custom and villagers openly expressing their distaste for him. It was also revealed shortly afterwards that the previous year, while still manager of the mega dairy, Rob had blocked a nearby culvert to prevent a build-up of rainwater from flooding the dairy and was therefore responsible for the massive flood that had engulfed Ambridge and nearly caused the death of his boss. After this information was brought to the attention of Rob's new boss, Justin Elliott, he was sacked. After an attempt to kidnap his son from Helen failed, Rob disappeared and was last reported boarding a flight to Minneapolis, Minnesota, where he had previously worked."]}, {"page": "Ned Chaillet", "response": ["| Carolyn Jones and Marcia Warren", "| John Woodvine, Clive Swift, Tom George, Ioan Meredith, David Timson, Peter Luke Kenny and Carolyn Jones", "| Angela Pleasence, Carolyn Jones, Joanna McCallum, Alice Hart, Jennifer Hilary and Eve Pearce"]}, {"page": "Carolyn Jones (disambiguation)", "response": ["Carolyn Jones (1930\u20131983) was an American actress.", "Carole, Caroline or Carolyn Jones may also refer to:", "*Carolyn Jones (British actress) (1941\u20132018), played Sharon Metcalfe on Crossroads from 1977 to 1984", "*Carolyn Jones (filmmaker) (born 1957), American director, writer, producer and photographer", "*Carolyn Jones, American winner of 1977 National Sweetheart beauty pageant", "*Carolyn Jones (politician), Canadian legislator in Saskatchewan from 1999 to 2003", "*Carolyn Jones (basketball) (born 1969), American guard for Auburn and Portland Fire"]}, {"page": "List of Crossroads characters", "response": ["|Carolyn Jones"]}, {"page": "2018 in British television", "response": ["|Carolyn Jones"]}, {"page": "2018 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Carolyn Jones, 77, British actress (Crossroads)."]}, {"page": "Deaths in July 2018", "response": ["*Carolyn Jones, 77, British actress (Crossroads).Carolyn Jones obituary "]}, {"page": "Sharon Metcalfe", "response": ["#REDIRECT Carolyn Jones (British actress)"]}, {"page": "Carolyn Jones (British actor)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Carolyn Jones (British actress)"]}]}}
