The king refused due to the belief that his reign would come to an end if the Krao people left the country. Krao's father named Schua Mayong was being held at the court along with her mother, and herself. They had been given to the king of Burma as a gift from the King of Laos. Farini then arranged for an expedition to be led by Carl Bock to find the Krao people. He encountered thirty to forty of them, but was not able to capture any of them. Bock returned to the king of Burma, who eventually agreed to let Bock take Krao and her father. The entire expedition came down with cholera at Chiang Mai and Krao's father died there. Six weeks after recovering, the expedition reached Bangkok. The king of Siam tried to prevent Bock from taking Krao to Europe. Prince Kronoiar intervened as Bock how later done a service for him.
