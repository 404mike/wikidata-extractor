At the end of the 1973\u201374 season, with his name linked with a transfer to either Luton Town or Glasgow Celtic, he was called up by the Northern Ireland FA for the first time, making his professional international debut in a Home Nations Championship game with Wales.Dowd was 23 when he was signed by English Division Two side Sheffield Wednesday, and he made his debut in a League Cup tie on 20 August 1974. That season he made just one more appearance at Hillsborough, in the FA Cup, as Wednesday were relegated to Division Three. He did however win two further international caps that season, against Norway and Sweden, which were his last international caps.Over subsequent seasons, Dowd began to establish himself in the first team at Hillsborough, but Wednesday remained in Division Three. He made his final appearance for the Sheffield team on 30 September 1978. In August 1979, Dowd joined Doncaster Rovers for \u00a315,000. He captained Rovers to promotion from Division Four in 1981 before retiring from League football during the 1982\u201383 season as a result of a knee ligament injury.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Billy Bremner", "response": ["He introduced massages and changed the canteen and team kit for the 1979\u201380 campaign. With no money available for transfers he was forced to turn to the youth team for new players, though he could afford to take on Ian Nimmo, Hugh Dowd, John Dowie and Billy Russell on free transfers. He appointed former Leeds coach Les Cocker as his assistant. The season started poorly, but the squad bonded following Cocker's death on 4 October and went on a run of six straight wins, for which Bremner was credited with the Fourth Division Manager of the Month award. However a run of just one win in 15 games followed, for which Bremner blamed his small squad and lack of training facilities. A mounting injury crisis caused him to make a return to playing on 29 March for the visit of Bournemouth, a game in which 16-year-old Ian Snodin was named on the bench. Rovers ended the season in 12th place."]}, {"page": "Dowd", "response": ["* Hugh Dowd (born 1951), Northern Irish football player"]}, {"page": "List of Sheffield Wednesday F.C. international footballers", "response": ["|Hugh Dowd"]}]}}
