He is a six-time Olympic medalist (all-round, team, floor exercise and three times on his signature piece, pommel horse), winning three golds and three bronzes, and a five time world medalist on the pommel horse with three gold and two silvers. He became Britain's first ever Olympic gold medalist in artistic gymnastics when he won both the men's floor and pommel horse exercises at the 2016 Summer Olympics. With fourteen medals and six titles in Olympic and world championships, Whitlock is the most successful gymnast in his nation's history, and the most successful pommel horse worker in gymnastics history; he has 8 global medals in the apparatus, including 5 global gold medals (two Olympic gold, 3 World gold).\nWhitlock came to prominence when he won the bronze medal at pommel horse at the 2012 Summer Olympics and the silver on the apparatus at the 2013 World Championships. He has been European champion on both floor and pommel horse, and won the floor and all-around individual title at the 2014 Commonwealth Games. In 2014, Whitlock won the silver medal in the all-around competition at the 2014 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships, matching Daniel Keatings for the best performance in a World all-around competition by a British gymnast. At the 2015 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Glasgow, Scotland, Whitlock became the first British man ever to win a World Championship gold medal, with a score of 16.133 on the pommel horse.\nOn 12 July 2016, Whitlock was selected for Great Britain's 2016 Olympics gymnastics team. During the games, he first won a bronze medal in the all-around gymnastics event, which was Great Britain's first medal in this Olympic event for 108 years. Days later he won the gold medal in the Men's Floor and Men's Pommel Horse events in the space of two hours, becoming his country's most successful Olympic gymnast, and its first Olympic champion in gymnastics.\nAt the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan, Whitlock won the Olympic gold medal on the pommel horse with a score of 15.583. The win gave him two Olympic titles and three World titles, making him the most successful gymnast ever on pommel horse.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "January 13", "response": ["*1993 \u2013 Max Whitlock, English artistic gymnast"]}, {"page": "1993", "response": ["* January 13 \u2013 Max Whitlock, English artistic gymnast"]}, {"page": "List of Olympic medalists in gymnastics (men)", "response": ["|Sam OldhamDaniel PurvisLouis SmithKristian ThomasMax Whitlock "]}, {"page": "Basildon", "response": ["In rugby, the town is represented in the London 2 North East League by Basildon R.F.C., while there is only local cricket played at Basildon and Pitsea C.C. in the Shepherd Neame Essex League Division 3.

In 2003, a canteen operated by independent catering contractors was built called 'La Wokerie' - a pun derived from the school's name \"WOK\". In 2006, a new English and Humanities Block was built, referred to by most students as 'the new building' It offered larger classrooms, some of which have false walls between two of them which can open up to create one large room. A new Arts and Drama suite was completed in early 2008. In the beginning of 2014, another two storey building was built for Maths and Examinations, and an extension to 'La Wokerie' was added by converting the adjacent classroom into a diner style restaurant with extra seating and a salad bar. Following the conversion of the old gymnasium into the 'Sixth Form Hub', accompanying the 'Sixth Form Caf\u00e9', the school opened a new sports hall towards the end of 2016.
