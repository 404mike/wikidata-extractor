He continued to nurse the Southport constituency while on leave in anticipation of being selected as the candidate when the election was finally held. However, the Conservative MP for Southport, received endorsement from the Coalition Prime Minister David Lloyd George, so the Southport Liberals decided not to run a candidate against him.Southport Liberal Association - The First 100 Years by Michael Braham He unsuccessfully contested the Walthamstow West constituency at the 1922 and 1923 general elections, before winning the seat at the 1924 general election, narrowly defeating the sitting Labour MP Valentine McEntee.

The parliamentary seat had a chequered history; the Liberals had won the seat on eight occasions but had lost it three times. At the last election in 1918, the Liberal candidate had finished third with just 24%, behind a socialist candidate supported by the National Federation of Discharged and Demobilized Sailors and Soldiers. At the 1922 general election, Harris faced the Unionist MP who had taken the seat from the Liberals in 1914 and a Communist who had Labour Party support. The sitting Unionist member finished third and Harris re-gained the seat polling over 40% of the vote. Harris repeated his victory in 1923 when his Communist opponent ran as an official Labour Party candidate and in 1924 when that opponent once more ran as a Communist. The 1924 election was a very bad election for the Liberals nationwide but Harris's support had held up very well. During the 1924\u201329 parliament which was dominated by a Unionist majority, Harris worked closely with a group of radical Liberal MPs that included William Wedgwood Benn, Frank Briant, Joseph Kenworthy and Horace Crawfurd to provide opposition to the government. Harris avoided getting involved in the Liberal Party in-fighting of the time and supported the radical policy platforms of the party presented under Lloyd George's leadership. At the 1929 general election he was easily returned, thanks in part to both the Communist and Labour parties running candidates."]}, {"page": "List of members of London County Council 1889\u20131919", "response": ["Frank Briant (elected at by-election, 16 December 1905)London County Council election in North Lambeth, The Times, 18 December 1905, p. 12.", "| Frank Briant", "| Frank Briant", "| Frank Briant"]}, {"page": "List of members of London County Council 1919\u20131937", "response": ["| Frank Briant"]}, {"page": "Briant", "response": ["* Frank Briant (1863\u20131934), a British Liberal politician and Civil Servant"]}, {"page": "1934 Lambeth North by-election", "response": ["The Lambeth North by-election of 1934 was held on 23 October 1934.
