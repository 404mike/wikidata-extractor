According to his biographer, Asser, writing in 893, \"In the year of our Lord's Incarnation 849 Alfred, King of the Anglo-Saxons\", was born at the royal estate called Wantage, in the district known as Berkshire (which is so called from Berroc Wood, where the box tree grows very abundantly).\" This date has been accepted by the editors of Asser's biography, Simon Keynes and Michael Lapidge, and by other historians such as David Dumville and Richard Huscroft. West Saxon genealogical lists state that Alfred was 23 when he became king in April 871, implying that he was born between April 847 and April 848. This dating is adopted in the biography of Alfred by Alfred Smyth, who regards Asser's biography as fraudulent, an allegation which is rejected by other historians. Richard Abels in his biography discusses both sources but does not decide between them and dates Alfred's birth as 847/849, while Patrick Wormald in his Oxford Dictionary of National Biography article dates it 848/849. Berkshire had been historically disputed between Wessex and Mercia, and as late as 844, a charter showed that it was part of Mercia, but Alfred's birth in the county is evidence that, by the late 840s, control had passed to Wessex."]}, {"page": "Camelot", "response": ["In 1542, John Leland reported the locals around Cadbury Castle, formerly known as Camalet,Phelps, W.

These excavations, led by archaeologist Leslie Alcock from 1966 to 1970, were titled \"Cadbury-Camelot\" and won much media attention. The dig revealed that the site seems to have been occupied as early as the 4th millennium BC and to have been refortified and occupied by a major Brittonic ruler and his war band from . This early medieval settlement continued until around 580. The works were by far the largest known fortification of the period, double the size of comparative caers and with Mediterranean artifacts representing extensive trade and Saxon ones showing possible conquest. The use of the name Camelot and the support of Geoffrey Ashe helped ensure much publicity for the finds, but Alcock himself later grew embarrassed by the supposed Arthurian connection to the site.

Attestations of Welsh kings to English charters appear to have been rare compared with those in \u00c6thelstan's reign, but in the historian David Dumville's view there is no reason to doubt that Edmund retained his overlordship over the Welsh kings. Attestations became more common again after Eadred succeeded Edmund. In a charter of 944 disposing of land in Devon, Edmund is styled \"king of the English and ruler of this British province\", suggesting that the former British kingdom of Dumnonia was still not regarded as fully integrated into England, although the historian Simon Keynes \"suspects some 'local' interference\" in the wording of Edmund's title."]}, {"page": "King Arthur", "response": ["Partly in reaction to such theories, another school of thought emerged which argued that Arthur had no historical existence at all.

Alex Woolf concurs and Pauline Stafford describes \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d as \"the last Mercian queen\", referred to in charters in such terms as \"by the gift of Christ's mercy ruling the government of the Mercians\". Stafford argues that \u00c6thelred and \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d exercised most or all of the powers of a monarch after Alfred's death but it would have been a provocative act formally to claim regality, especially after \u00c6thelwold's rebellion.
