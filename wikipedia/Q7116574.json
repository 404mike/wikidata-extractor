According to Michael Kelly, when young, Mrs Linley was \"reckoned beautiful\". The couple had 12 children over an 18-year period from 1753 until 1771, but only eight lived beyond infancy or childhood. Seven went on to musical or theatrical careers: Elizabeth Ann Linley (1754\u20131792), his eldest daughter, wife of Richard Brinsley Sheridan; his eldest son Thomas Linley the younger (1756\u20131778), composer and noted violinist; Mary Linley (1758\u201387), who gave up her career as a singer after she married playwright Richard Tickell in 1780; Samuel Linley (1760\u20131778), second son, singer and oboe player; Maria Linley (1763\u201384), singer; Ozias Thurston Linley (1765\u20131831), minor canon at Norwich and organist at Dulwich; and William Linley, (1771\u20131835), composer of glees, songs and writer. Another child, Jane Nash (1768\u20131806), sang in an amateur capacity until her marriage.
