The team won six of their next 11 matches, but relegation to League Two was confirmed at the start of May in their penultimate match of the season. Argyle finished 23rd in the league table, having taken 42 points from 46 matches. They finished above Swindon Town, but were six points below Walsall, who stayed up on the last day of the season. Having been in negotiations over a takeover with interested parties, nine first team players out of contract at the end of June were released by the club. They included defenders Marcel Seip and Kriszti\u00e1n Tim\u00e1r, Scottish players Chris Clark, Steve MacLean and Jim Paterson, midfielders Anton Peterlin and Luke Summerfield, forward Rory Fallon and Karl Duguid. The only player to be offered a new contract was Frenchman St\u00e9phane Zubar, while captain Carl Fletcher agreed to stay by taking up the option of a further 12 months on his deal. First year professional Ryan Leonard was also released, and among the apprentices that were allowed to leave was Matt Rickard, who made one appearance for the first team in 2010\u201311.
