In the phone call Cox explained to Keegan, sharply, he had signed a player called Peter Beardsley from Vancouver Whitecaps and explained to Keegan that he'd like him; after giving Keegan the message, Cox immediately put the phone down... A few days later Keegan met Beardsley at Benwell. Keegan and his teammates, at first sight, thought Beardsley was just a lad who had won the competition to train with the first team. It was only when they saw him in action that they knew he had something about him. At Beardsley's first training session Keegan could not believe his eyes at what a talent he was witnessing. Keegan once stated about Beardsley, \"At Scunthorpe I always thought Terry Heath had the wow factor, because of his skill on the ball, and when I moved to Liverpool I had never seen anyone with Peter Thompson's ability. By the time I started playing for Newcastle, however, I had played against Cruyff, Maradona and Pel\u00e9, and yet I have never had my mind blown as I did on the first day I saw Peter Beardsley.\""]}, {"page": "1969\u201370 Football League", "response": ["|20||align=left|  Terry Heath ||align=left| Scunthorpe United ||13||2||0||15"]}, {"page": "1970\u201371 Football League", "response": ["|=||align=left|  Terry Heath ||align=left| Scunthorpe United ||11||0||0||11"]}, {"page": "1964 Football League Cup Final", "response": ["The First leg was played at Stoke City's Victoria Ground and was a very exciting encounter. Peter Dobing hit the post early on and John Ritchie had a shot brilliantly cleared off the line by John Sjoberg.

In front of a crowd of 22,309 Stoke went out for a second goal but Leicester's defence held firm and against the run of play they got an equaliser.
