He was elected MP in 1866 to represent Aberdeenshire and, following the reorganisation of constituencies by the Representation of the People (Scotland) Act 1868, on 20 November 1868 to represent East Aberdeenshire.He pioneered benefits for his tenants, such as insurance for their cottages, and sent carriages to Banff, Peterhead and Aberdeen each week, so that they had greater mobility. He drove through gaming laws to aid the rural economy and created a railway station at Maud, which is now a part-time museum. On his death in 1875, aged 39, the Culsh Monument was built for him by tenant subscription and designed by James Matthews. He was buried on his estate at Brucklay Castle, where an obelisk marks his grave.", "link_mentions": {}}}
