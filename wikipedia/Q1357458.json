In particular, he was not known as an interpreter of the Italian opera repertoire (he conducted no Puccini and only five Verdi works during his music directorship at Covent Garden). His tenure began well; a cycle of the Mozart Da Ponte operas directed by Johannes Schaaf was a success, and although a Ring cycle with the Russian director Yuri Lyubimov could not be completed, a substitute staging of the cycle directed by G\u00f6tz Friedrich was well received.Clements, Andrew. \"A great musician \u2013 but that was not enough\" , The Guardian, 21 June 2002 Musically and dramatically the company prospered into the 1990s.

However, it was the role of Br\u00fcnnhilde that would earn her international fame, most notably in the Wagner temple of Bayreuth in 1989-1992, a performance which was also captured on CD and video (now transferred to DVD, and announced on Blu-ray by the end of 2012), conducted by Daniel Barenboim and directed by Harry Kupfer.
