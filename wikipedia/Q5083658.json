The following month, he featured for Somerset in what is generally considered to be their first match of the first-class cricket, against Lancashire. Somerset were heavily beaten in the match, during which Fothergill took three wickets and scored three runs. That summer, he was selected to appear for the professional \"Players\" against the amateur \"Gentlemen\" in the prestigious annual fixture at Lord's, in which he had little impact as the Gentlemen won by eight wickets. In all, Fothergill played fourteen first-class matches in 1882, claiming 44 wickets at an average of 22.02, and taking five wickets in an innings twice.

The match, played against Hampshire, showed little sign of the troubles that were to come. Sainsbury scored 0 and 13 opening the batting for his side, but the bowling of Edward Bastard, who claimed eight wickets in the first innings and three in the second, helped Somerset to a five-wicket victory. The county's next match, played two weeks later against Gloucestershire, was their heaviest defeat when losing by an innings to that point. Gloucestershire won the toss and elected to bat, totalling 448 in 190\u00a0overs; Somerset bowlers James Parfitt and Charles Winter both conceding over 100 runs. In reply, five of the Somerset batsman were out for ducks; Sainsbury, Parfitt and Albert Clapp were the only ones to reach double figures.

Playing six matches, there were a total of 120\u00a0wickets on offer, but Somerset's bowlers took only 67. Edward Bastard, a slow left-arm orthodox bowler, was the county's leading wicket-taker, claiming 25\u00a0wickets during his four appearances, at an average of 15.32. His bowling average was not far below that of George Lohmann, who finished the season as the country's leading wicket taker, with 142\u00a0wickets from his 24\u00a0matches. Unfortunately for Somerset, Bastard was only able to play in four of the county's six matches, and of the other bowlers, the best bowling average was the 25.85 managed by Bill Roe, who took only seven wickets. Charles Winter, who took the next highest total of wickets, only managed to claim 15 in his 6\u00a0appearances. Batting was the strongest aspect of Somerset's play, but the club lacked the strength-in-depth of other county teams. Herbie Hewett, playing his second season of first-class cricket, finished with the highest batting average for the county with 35.28, a respectable average which exceeded a number of England Test batsmen that season.

The MCC started well in their innings, but the introduction of Fowler into the bowling attack brought their batting to a quick conclusion; Fowler took four wickets while only conceding eight runs, and claimed a hat-trick by bowling Edward Hawtrey, Charles Burke and Thomas Mycroft in successive deliveries. Somerset had a 25-run lead going into the second innings, in which Newton once again top-scored. In addition to his total of 67, Lyonel Hildyard made an unbeaten 59, and Fowler scored 23 runs from just six scoring shots, including a six which went out of the ground. The Western Daily Press described Fowler as \"possibly the hardest hitter amongst English cricketers\", while his history of the county, David Foot suggests that Fowler was \"perhaps the earliest Somerset batsman to parade the fundamental skills of slogging.\" Somerset totalled 219, to leave the MCC needing to score 245 runs to win.
