At the college, where she was encouraged to read more widely and to engage with the issues of the day, she discovered socialism through the works of Robert Blatchford. By this time she was impatient with religion; socialism provided a timely and attractive substitute.Jackson, p. 24.

Thirty years later Wilkinson told her colleague George Middleton that Glasier had \"brought me into the Socialist movement\u00a0... It always makes me humble to think of her indomitable courage\".Letter from Wilkinson to Middleton, quoted by Bartley, p. 5. After meeting the suffragist Hannah Mitchell, Wilkinson took up the cause of women's suffrage, the major women's rights issue of the day.
