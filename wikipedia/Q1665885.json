However, he criticised Hood's performance, saying \"the casting of Morag Hood (which, according to the production history included in this DVD set, was a desperate, last-minute decision) is a distressing misfire. [...] poor Hood can't begin to approach the character with even a modicum of believability. Natasha begins the story as a wild, impetuous girl of thirteen - an age and a temperament that Hood evidently felt needed to be delineated by having Natasha laugh insanely at everything while leaping about like a mad thing (Hood is also far too old to be a believable 13-year-old). As for later maturing into this bewitching, erotic little beauty whom all men adore, either an actress has that innate, inexplicable quality or they don't - you can't \"act\" that powerful allure onto the screen. It has to come from within, and simply put, Hood doesn't have it.\""]}, {"page": "List of Bergerac episodes", "response": ["| Nicholas Ball, Sue Lloyd, Sylvester Morand, Anthony Calf, Carmen du Sautoy, Danny Webb"]}, {"page": "Ancient Rome: The Rise and Fall of an Empire", "response": ["*Sylvester Morand as Mancinus"]}, {"page": "Sharpe's Siege (TV programme)", "response": ["* Sylvester Morand \u2013 Colonel Henri Lassan"]}, {"page": "Ned Chaillet", "response": ["| Maria Friedman, Emily Woof, Sylvester Morand and Ray Lonnen", "| Nicholas Le Prevost, Julian Barnes, Ron Cook, Timothy Watson, Sylvester Morand, Jonathan Tafler, Tracy Wiles, Rebecca Egan, Martin Hyder, Richard Firth, Scott Brooksbank, Emma Woolliams and Laura Doddington"]}, {"page": "I Remember Nelson", "response": ["* Sylvester Morand as  Lord Byron"]}]}}
