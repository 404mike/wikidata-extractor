He was Vicar of Chacombe (in Northamptonshire) from 1873-1894. In 1894 he retired on a small pension, and he died at Saffron Walden (in Hertfordshire) in 1909. He translated from Latin the life of John Dee written by Thomas Smith.He is generally thought to have been a member of the shadowy Society of Eight founded in 1883. He became a member of the successor Order of the Golden Dawn. He was a supporter of the reforms of Arthur Edward Waite, which split the Order as the Holy Order of the Golden Dawn and the Stella Matutina.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Old Carthusians", "response": ["*William Alexander Ayton (1816\u20131909), clergyman, alchemist, and member of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn"]}, {"page": "William Ayton", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Alexander Ayton"]}, {"page": "Stella Matutina", "response": ["After a revolt of London Adepts against the then-head of the Order (Samuel MacGregor Mathers) in early 1900, the Order segmented into two new groups.

After a short time, Bullock resigned, and Dr. Robert Felkin took his place.King, 1989, page 94 During this time they fell into conflict with Annie Horniman which led to her leaving the order for good. In May 1903 Brodie Innes attempted to pass a new constitution in which he would become head of the order. He was opposed by a majority of the remaining members led by Arthur Edward Waite, Marcus Blackden and William Alexander Ayton. The Waite group proposed that the order should be reorganised and refocused in a mystical direction retaining control of the Isis-Urania temple, while those wishing to pursue active magical operations should separate. This led a minority under Felkin and Brodie-Innes, and including Yeats, to separate to form the Stella Matutina.Gilbert, Robert A.; p. 44"]}, {"page": "Ayton (surname)", "response": ["* William Alexander Ayton (1816\u20131909), British Anglican clergyman"]}, {"page": "Category talk:Alchemists", "response": ["List of all pages in category Alchemists retrieved by PockBot.PockBot is currently Undergoing Trials.
