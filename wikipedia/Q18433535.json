He was born at Aldgate in Middlesex.\nHoppe made his first-class debut for Kent County Cricket Club, playing against a United England Eleven at Gravesend in 1854. His final appearance was for the Gentlemen of Kent and Sussex against the Gentlemen of England at Lord's in 1857. He played club cricket for Town Malling Cricket Club in Kent between 1849 and 1874.\nHoppe died at Cobham in Kent in April 1919 aged 88.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Thomas Hopper (cricketer)", "response": ["He is believed to have made a single first-class appearance against MCC at Lord's in 1856. There is some doubt about the identity of the man who played in this match and both the 1907 History of Kent County Cricket and the 1929 Kent Cricket Matches 1719\u20131880 identify him as Mr J Hoppe, probably John Hoppe, the twin brother of Alfred Hoppe, whilst Scores and Biographies identifies him as T Hoppe. More recent research has concluded that Hopper was probably the player involved and several prominent Gravesend cricketers, including Tom Adams, played in the same match."]}]}}
