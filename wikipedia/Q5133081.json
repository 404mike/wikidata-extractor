The architectural historian John Newman describes the 18th century building, situated on the Hereford Road away from the main school site, as \"the best house in the entire street\". More modern developments include the Hall of 1961, redeveloped in the early 21st century and now the Blake Theatre, the Red Lion Block of the same date and the Science Block of 1981\u20131984. In 1985\u20131986, two ceramic murals were designed for the chapel by the Polish religious artist Adam Kossowski, a friend and wartime colleague of the school's Head of Art from 1947 to 1978, Otto Maciag. Executed by Maciag, and another art master at the school, Michael Tovey,  the murals were dedicated at a service conducted by the Bishop of Monmouth, the Rt Rev Clifford Wright on 3 October 1987. He described them as \"masterpieces of twentieth-century religious art\u201d. In November 2008, a \u00a32.3 million sports pavilion was completed and opened by the former British Lions player and Welsh captain, Eddie Butler, an old boy of the School.  It was designed by the architects Buttress Fuller Alsop Williams. In 2011 the school began the Heart Project.  This led to the sale of some outlying sites, such as St. James's House, and the re-organisation of others, to assist in the raising of funds for the redevelopment of the main school site.  Further funds came from the Haberdashers' Company, and the first phase was completed with the rebuilding of the Red Lion Block, now renamed the William Jones Building."]}, {"page": "Royston Clifford Wright", "response": ["#REDIRECT Clifford Wright (bishop)"]}, {"page": "2014 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Clifford Wright, 91, Anglican prelate, Bishop of Monmouth."]}, {"page": "Deaths in February 2014", "response": ["*Clifford Wright, 91, British Anglican prelate, Bishop of Monmouth (1986\u20131991).Tributes for former Bishop of Monmouth"]}, {"page": "Clifford Wright", "response": ["* Clifford Wright (bishop) (1922\u20132014), Anglican bishop of Monmouth", "* Clifford Wright (mayor) (1927\u20132014), mayor of Saskatoon, Canada"]}]}}
