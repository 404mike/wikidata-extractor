As the club awaited completion of the new stadium, all home fixtures in 2011 were played at the Halton Stadium in Widnes, effectively meaning St Helens were forced to play an entire season of away fixtures. In addition, they suffered upheaval in terms of the playing squad; having already lost the influential Cunningham to retirement and other club legends like Sean Long, the start of the season was overshadowed by the news that Kyle Eastmond, who had been earmarked as Long's replacement, and inspirational leader James Graham were both looking to leave the club. A number of serious injuries to further key players such as Leon Pryce and Ade Gardner meant the team was facing an uphill battle on the field all season. However, despite all the problems faced, St Helens defied the odds to reach their 11th Challenge Cup semi-final in a row, and at the end of the season they qualified for their 6th consecutive Grand Final. However, for the 5th year in a row they were on the losing side, as the injury-plagued squad finally succumbed to Leeds. However, the 2011 season saw the emergence of a new crop of talent, with players such as Jonny Lomax and Lee Gaskell stepping up to fill the gaps left by senior players and earning rave reviews for their performances."]}, {"page": "2006 Rugby League Tri-Nations", "response": ["|St Helens R.F.C.||Lee Gilmour, Leon Pryce, James Roby, Paul Wellens, Jon Wilkin, Sean Long", "|6 Darren Lockyer (c)|| FE/SO ||6 Leon Pryce"]}, {"page": "Lance Todd Trophy", "response": ["The trophy has been shared on two occasions, in 1964\u201365 by Ray Ashby (Wigan) & Brian Gabbitas (Hunslet), and in 2007 by Wellens and Leon Pryce.", "| Paul WellensLeon Pryce"]}, {"page": "Danny Tickle", "response": ["Workington Town Head Coach Leon Pryce said,  \u201cDanny is a fantastic addition to the squad.\u201d"]}, {"page": "2007 All Golds Tour", "response": ["|SO ||6|| Leon Pryce", "|SO ||6|| Leon Pryce"]}]}}
