Jones was a constant champion towards his people, specially the womenfolk, whose morals were severely criticized in the report. He set out to prove that the morality of the Welsh were no different to the English to which the Bill compared them, making detailed studies of facts such as the comparison of the countries' illegitimacy rates. Although he privately disapproved of some practices conducted in Wales, such as bundling, he defended Welsh women resolutely and became their moral champion.  The decision to publish Y Gymraes was not taken lightly as Jones' health had worsened and he did not expect to live to see more than a few issues of the monthly paper.
