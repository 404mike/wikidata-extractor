Opening the bowling, she remained wicket-less in the first-innings, with Maureen Payne taking all nine English wickets (Ann Jago retired hurt).  She scored 30 with the bat playing at number four, and claimed the wicket of Mollie Hunt in the second-innings.  In a match that England won by 120 runs, she could only manage one run as South Africa chased 153 in their second-innings.  After missing the first Test at St George's Park, Lang was selected to play for South Africa XI Women the following week.  Opening the batting alongside Eleanor Lambert, she made 56 runs in two hours and followed it up by taking two wickets as England matched the South African XI total of 190.  With limited overs remaining in the two-day match, Lang scored 16 runs in a declared total of 91 for 7 in South Africa's second-innings; a total the English chased down in just 13.3 overs."]}]}}
