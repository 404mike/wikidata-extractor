The award was shared with Philip W. Anderson and J. H. Van Vleck. The three had conducted loosely related research. Mott and Anderson clarified the reasons why magnetic or amorphous materials can sometimes be metallic and sometimes insulating.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 8", "response": ["*1996 \u2013 Nevill Francis Mott, English physicist and academic, Nobel Prize laureate (b. 1905)"]}, {"page": "Semiconductor", "response": ["A unified explanation of these phenomena required a theory of solid-state physics, which developed greatly in the first half of the 20th century. In 1878 Edwin Herbert Hall demonstrated the deflection of flowing charge carriers by an applied magnetic field, the Hall effect. The discovery of the electron by J.J. Thomson in 1897 prompted theories of electron-based conduction in solids. Karl Baedeker, by observing a Hall effect with the reverse sign to that in metals, theorized that copper iodide had positive charge carriers. Johan Koenigsberger classified solid materials like metals, insulators, and \"variable conductors\" in 1914 although his student Josef Weiss already introduced the term Halbleiter (a semiconductor in modern meaning) in his Ph.D. thesis in 1910. Felix Bloch published a theory of the movement of electrons through atomic lattices in 1928. In 1930, B. Gudden stated that conductivity in semiconductors was due to minor concentrations of impurities. By 1931, the band theory of conduction had been established by Alan Herries Wilson and the concept of band gaps had been developed. Walter H. Schottky and Nevill Francis Mott developed models of the potential barrier and of the characteristics of a metal\u2013semiconductor junction. By 1938, Boris Davydov had developed a theory of the copper-oxide rectifier, identifying the effect of the p\u2013n junction and the importance of minority carriers and surface states."]}, {"page": "September 30", "response": ["*1905 \u2013 Nevill Francis Mott, English physicist and academic, Nobel Prize laureate (d. 1996)"]}, {"page": "1977", "response": ["* Physics \u2013 Philip Warren Anderson, Sir Nevill Francis Mott, John Hasbrouck Van Vleck"]}, {"page": "1996", "response": ["* August 8 \u2013 Nevill Francis Mott, English Nobel physicist (b. 1905)"]}, {"page": "1905", "response": ["** Nevill Francis Mott, English physicist, Nobel Prize laureate (d. 1996)"]}]}}
