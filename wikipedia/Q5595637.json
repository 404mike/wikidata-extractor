He also recorded the four seasonal Percy the Park Keeper stories for a home audio release based on the books by Nick Butterworth, creating memorable voices for all of the animal characters as well as Percy the Park Keeper himself.

Each cartoon, written by Calveley and directed by Bob Godfrey, was about five minutes long. Thirty episodes were made, and the show was first shown on 21 October 1974.

Like the original series, it was written by Grange Calveley and narrated by Richard Briers. The series introduced a large number of other animal characters who also got involved in Roobarb's schemes. It was produced by Adam Sharp and Bernadette O'Riordan for A&B TV, and directed by Jason Tammemagi; the animation was by the Irish company Monster Animation & Design. The revival used computer animation, but kept the \"wobbly\" look and plain white backgrounds from the original series. The music for the revival was by Jon Atkinson.

SkylArk", "response": ["Noah and Nelly was created by Grange Calveley, writer of the earlier and better known Roobarb cartoon. The five-minute films depict a world loosely based around Noah's Ark. However, Calveley's surreal interpretation involves two-headed talking animals reminiscent of the pushmi-pullyu known to Doctor Dolittle. Each animal has a cheerful, optimistic head at one end and an unhappy, pessimistic head at the other. Even the SkylArk itself is a longship with a figurehead at either end, one smiling, the other frowning. Although there is only one animal of each type, they are referred to in the plural - Brian the lions and Rose the Elephants. As with the earlier Roobarb, the main narration is provided by British actor Richard Briers. However, co-narrator Peter Hawkins manages to find a different and appropriate voice for each of the many animals."]}, {"page": "1943 in British television", "response": ["* 6 May \u2013 Grange Calveley, animator and screenwriter"]}, {"page": "Calveley (surname)", "response": ["*Grange Calveley (born 1943), British writer and artist"]}, {"page": "Deaths in August 2021", "response": ["*Grange Calveley, 78, British writer (Roobarb, Noah and Nelly in...
