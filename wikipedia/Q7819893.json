He came into the side for a visit to Woolwich Arsenal in early December when Watson was rested, and \"played excellently\" in a 1\u20130 win; the Athletic News noted that \"even when beaten, he made some remarkable recoveries.\" He recovered from influenza just in time to stand in for Watson when he fell ill with the same complaint at the end of January, and missed only two more league matches that season, playing either alongside Watson or in his place. Daykin began the 1907\u201308 season as first choice at left back, partnering new signing Bob Bonthron, but other players were tried in mid-season. He came back into the side in March, but this time lost his place through injury.  He was retained for 1908\u201309, and played in the opening fixture, but was dropped in favour of Tommy Tait, and made just three more appearances for Sunderland before moving on. His last match was the local derby against Newcastle United in December 1908. Sunderland took an early lead before the visitors equalised with a penalty just before half-time. Sunderland regained the lead two minutes into the second half, and in the next half hour scored seven more goals to make the final score 9\u20131; it remains the club record league away win."]}, {"page": "Tommy Tait (footballer born 1879)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Tommy Tait (footballer, born 1879)"]}]}}
