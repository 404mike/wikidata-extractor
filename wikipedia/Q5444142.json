The team defeated bottom side Stoke 2\u20131 on 2 December following goals from Gill and Clennell but defeat to Stoke in the reverse fixture a week later left the two sides tied at the bottom of the league on 13 points along with Arsenal and Oldham Athletic. The Times expressed surprise at the club's struggles in the first half of the season, reporting \"Cardiff City can play extremely well at Cardiff on occasions [...] They have not however reproduced their form at the end of last season, playing rather in-and-ourlt football\". The slump in form was blamed largely on the team's attacking players and their lack of scoring. This prompted manager Fred Stewart to make the first major signings of the season, with Fergie Aitken arriving on a free transfer. The side were credited with playing \"dashing and improved football\" as they recorded a 3\u20131 home victory over Manchester City in their following match. In the week following the fixture, defender Blair collapsed during a training session and was taken to a local hospital. It was believed that he was still suffering effects from a bout of pneumonia earlier in the season. A second signing arrived soon after with George Reid arriving from Walsall. He made a goalscoring debut for Cardiff in the reverse fixture against Manchester City with what proved a consolation goal as the side were soundly beaten 5\u20131. He scored again in the club's following fixture with Gill adding a brace in a 3\u20130 win over West Bromwich Albion before Cardiff finished the year with a defeat to West Brom and a goalless draw with Bolton Wanderers.
