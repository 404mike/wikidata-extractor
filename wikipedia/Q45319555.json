The vivid, unnatural colors led the critic Louis Vauxcelles to derisively dub their works as les Fauves, or \"the wild beasts\", marking the start of the Fauvist movement. In March 1906, the noted art dealer Ambroise Vollard sent Derain to London to produce a series of paintings with the city as subject. In 30 paintings (29 of which are still extant), Derain presented a portrait of London that was radically different from anything done by previous painters of the city such as Whistler or Monet. With bold colors and compositions, Derain painted multiple pictures of the Thames and Tower Bridge. These London paintings remain among his most popular work. Art critic T. G Rosenthal: \"Not since Monet has anyone made London seem so fresh and yet remain quintessentially English. Some of his views of the Thames use the Pointillist technique of multiple dots, although by this time, because the dots have become much larger, it is rather more simply the separation of colours called Divisionism and it is peculiarly effective in conveying the fragmentation of colour in moving water in sunlight.\"Tom Rosenthal, reviewing Derain's London paintings on show at the Courtauld Gallery, The Independent 4 December 2005"]}, {"page": "The Perse School", "response": ["*Tom Rosenthal (publisher) (1935\u20132014), publisher and art critic"]}, {"page": "Euan Uglow", "response": ["Euan Uglow was born in 1932 in London.
