This spell with Town however would be a lot less successful as an injury in early 2004 meant his place was contested by his under study Andrew Pettinger and Hull City loanee Alan Fettis.

He made two more appearances that season but none in the following season. After City won promotion to the Premier League in May 1999, Bower's first-team opportunities were restricted. Instead he spent a period on loan at York City in the 1999\u20132000 season, after he was signed by the club's new manager Terry Dolan, who had previously managed Bradford City. Dolan made a number of other defensive signings including Alan Fettis, Peter Swan and Peter Hawkins, and with Bower they helped to reduce the number of goals York conceded to help them avoid relegation.

He made three appearances before returning to Sunderland in December. He played for Sunderland in a friendly against Hull City for the opening of their new ground, the KC Stadium, which made him the first away goalkeeper at the ground, while also being the last to play at Hull's former ground, Boothferry Park.

However, he was unable to play regularly for York because of the form of Bobby Mimms and Alan Fettis. After having trials with Premier League and First Division clubs, Howarth left York in November 2002 to sign for Tranmere Rovers for a five-figure fee. Here, he again played sporadically, only having runs in the team when first-choice goalkeeper John Achterberg was unavailable. After being released by Tranmere in 2005, Howarth signed for Bradford City. However, he was unable to dislodge Donovan Ricketts in goal and was released in 2007. He retired from football and started working as a paramedic.", "Howarth started his career with hometown club York City in their youth system, joining in 1996 on schoolboy terms. In the summer of 1998, he signed a three-year academy scholarship at York and became a first-year trainee. During May 1999, he played for York in the Candia-66 International Under-20s Tournament, a youth tournament hosted in Europe. York won the tournament after defeating Trenkvin Slowakigie in the final, in which Howarth saved two penalty kicks in the 4\u20132 penalty shoot-out victory. Aged 17, he made his first-team debut for Third Division York in a 1\u20130 victory at home to Swansea City in the opening match of the 1999\u20132000 season on 7 August 1999. He started the season as York's first-choice goalkeeper ahead of the experienced Bobby Mimms, keeping clean sheets in the first three matches. On 26 August 1999, two days after making his fifth successive appearance, Howarth signed a three-year professional contract with York. However, after conceding 11 goals in three matches, and having played in York's first six matches of the season, manager Neil Thompson dropped him for the more experienced Mimms. York's management team insisted Howarth's exclusion was to safeguard him, and was not based on merit. His next appearance came as a 72nd-minute substitute in York's 2\u20130 defeat away to Plymouth Argyle on 19 February 2000, following an injury to Mimms. Howarth was favoured over Mimms for the following match, a 0\u20130 draw at home to Exeter City on 26 February 2000. However, following the signing of Northern Ireland international Alan Fettis, Howarth was once again restricted to the substitutes' bench. His first season in senior football finished with eight appearances.", "Howarth made his first appearance of 2001\u201302 in the 2\u20130 defeat away to Notts County on 16 October 2001 in the Football League Trophy Northern Section first round. Having made a number of fine saves, he was named man of the match, and Dolan remarked that: \"he is playing as well as I have seen him and he is putting real pressure on Alan Fettis.\" Despite not featuring regularly for York, he spent four days on trial with Premier League club Sunderland, training with the team for three days and playing 45 minutes of a practice match against Huddersfield Town. Howarth then spent a brief period on trial with Wolverhampton Wanderers (Wolves) of the First Division in January 2002. He played for the reserve team against Huddersfield and reportedly impressed manager Dave Jones. Howarth made his first league appearance for York in over two years as a 65th-minute substitute for an injured Fettis a 3\u20130 home win over Bristol Rovers on 17 April 2002. Two days later, he was offered a new contract by York. With Fettis still injured for the following match, Howarth started for the first time since February 2000 in a 1\u20130 defeat away to Scunthorpe United on 20 April 2002, York's final match of the season.
