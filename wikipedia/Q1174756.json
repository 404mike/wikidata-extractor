Born in Northern Ireland, Holmes worked as a DJ before releasing several solo albums that have incorporated elements of trip hop, big beat, electronic and rock. In the late 1990s, Holmes also began composing film scores, establishing a long-standing collaboration with director Steven Soderbergh that includes Out of Sight (1998) and the Ocean's trilogy.\nHe is currently part of the band Unloved, whose music has been used extensively in the television series Killing Eve, for which Holmes is the composer. Holmes has remixed songs for numerous artists and produced albums for Primal Scream. He is best known for his 1993 BBC Radio 1 Essential Mix.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Steven Soderbergh", "response": ["Soderbergh's films are centered on suspenseful and ambient soundscapes. A primary way he achieves suspenseful soundscapes is by introducing audio before visuals in cut scenes, alerting the viewer of a sudden change in tone. His frequent collaborations with composers Cliff Martinez, David Holmes, and most recently Thomas Newman, provide his films with \"the thematic and sonic landscapes into which he inserts his characters.\"", "Soderbergh has frequently relied on Jerry Weintraub to produce many of his films. Composer Cliff Martinez has scored ten Soderbergh films starting with Sex, Lies, and Videotape (1989) and ending with Contagion (2011). Northern Irish composer David Holmes joined him in 1998 to score Out of Sight and rejoined him in scoring his Ocean's trilogy. Soderbergh rejected Holmes' score for his 2006 film The Good German, but brought him back on for subsequent movies, most recently Logan Lucky (2017). Starting in 2000, composer Thomas Newman has worked with four Soderbergh films, most recently in 2020 with Let Them All Talk. Often editing the films himself, he also works with editor Stephen Mirrione and frequently collaborates with screenwriter Scott Z.

It was originally the brainchild of Eddie Gordon, the producer of the show from the first broadcast in 1993 to 2001. In 1993, after months of receiving weekly mix shows on tape-cassette, featuring New York DJs Tony Humphries WRKS 98.7 Kiss FM and Frankie Knuckles WQHT HOT 97 FM, and recorded and mailed religiously by U.S. Billboards Dance Editor Brian Chin, Eddie advised BBC Radio 1 that a weekly dance-mix show with DJs of different genres of music would offer more variety and the chance for the ever-burgeoning UK dance music scene to flourish with both notable and upcoming DJs. Eddie further encouraged the DJs he scheduled to flex their musical knowledge; a high number of listeners were recording the show on cassette to listen to later, so a straight out \"4 to the floor\" mix was not necessarily required, allowing the DJs to include more eclectic music or offer something different from their normal selections. DJ Paul Oakenfold particularly grasped the concept, and after sitting with Eddie to blueprint his December 1994 Essential Mix, he produced the now world-famous Goa Mix, which won a Silver Award in the Specialist Music Programme category at the 1998 Sony Radio Awards and in 2000 was voted the Best Ever Essential Mix by the BBC Radio 1 listeners. Then DJ David Holmes in June 1997 created another two legendary hours in the history of the Essential Mix; his set, a surprising journey from Nancy Wilson to Jimi Hendrix, redefined the DJ as a collector of musical history. In May 1998, DJ Ashley Beedle, known for his house music style, completed a two-hour reggae mix to reveal his extensive knowledge of that genre of music and it is blogged as the best reggae mix ever broadcast (see link Best Foot Forward).
