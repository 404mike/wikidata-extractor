Through a royal warrant issued on 14 July 1917, Alexander, along with his brother, Prince Adolphus, Duke of Teck, similarly relinquished all of his German titles, styles, and honours, choosing instead the name of Cambridge, after his grandfather, Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge. Alexander was then known simply as Sir Alexander Cambridge (being entitled to the honorific Sir through his knighthoods in the Royal Victorian Order and the Order of the Bath), until, on 7 November 1917, the King created him Earl of Athlone and Viscount Trematon. Athlone had declined a marquessate, as he thought the title did not sound British enough. Athlone's wife retained her royal style and title, while their surviving children became the Lady May Cambridge and Rupert Cambridge, Viscount Trematon. Rupert was to inherit the title of Earl of Athlone, but he died on 15 April 1928, ten days shy of his twenty-first birthday, meaning the third creation of the title became extinct with the death of the first earl.", "* Rupert Cambridge, Viscount Trematon"]}, {"page": "Rupert (name)", "response": ["* Rupert Cambridge, Viscount Trematon (1907\u20131928), great-grandson of Queen Victoria"]}, {"page": "Duke of Teck", "response": ["***Prince Rupert of Teck, later Rupert Cambridge, Viscount Trematon (1907\u20131928)"]}, {"page": "Haemophilia in European royalty", "response": ["|\t6\t||\tRupert Cambridge, Viscount Trematon||\t15-Apr-1928\t||\tgreat-grandson"]}, {"page": "Prince Rupert of Teck", "response": ["#REDIRECT Rupert Cambridge, Viscount Trematon"]}, {"page": "Rupert Trematon", "response": ["#REDIRECT Rupert Cambridge, Viscount Trematon"]}, {"page": "Royal Burial Ground, Frogmore", "response": ["* 1928 Rupert Cambridge, Viscount Trematon (1907\u20131928), son of Alexander Cambridge, 1st Earl of Athlone.
