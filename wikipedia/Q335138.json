When a junior officer, he served in the Peninsular War and the Waterloo campaign, latterly as military secretary to the Duke of Wellington. He also took part in politics as Tory Member of Parliament for Truro, before becoming Master-General of the Ordnance. He became commander of the British troops sent to the Crimea in 1854: his primary objective was to defend Constantinople, and he was also ordered to besiege the Russian Port of Sevastopol. After an early success at the Battle of Alma, a failure to deliver orders with sufficient clarity caused the fateful Charge of the Light Brigade at the Battle of Balaclava. Despite further success at the Battle of Inkerman, a poorly coordinated allied assault on Sevastopol in June 1855 was a complete failure. Raglan died later that month, after suffering from dysentery and depression.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1855", "response": ["* June 28 \u2013 FitzRoy Somerset, 1st Baron Raglan, commander of British forces in the Crimean War (b. 1788)"]}, {"page": "Crimean War", "response": ["** FitzRoy Somerset, 1st Baron Raglan"]}, {"page": "Somerset (disambiguation)", "response": ["*FitzRoy Somerset, 1st Baron Raglan (1788\u20131855)"]}, {"page": "Battle of Inkerman", "response": ["The allied armies of Britain, France, Sardinia, and the Ottoman Empire had landed on the west coast of Crimea on 14 September 1854, intending to capture the Russian naval base at Sevastopol.
