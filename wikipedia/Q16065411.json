In 1858 they were arrested as spies in the Carpathian mountains on the grounds that they had \"pan-Slavistic tendencies\". They did not stand trial, and neither of them were aware of the underlying issues, but they were both intrigued by the subject. They travelled in Albania and Serbia investigating the conditions and both became supporters of Serbia and the southern Slavs as they saw their conditions under the perceived poor government by the Ottoman rulers. They were particularly concerned by the plight of Serbian Orthodox women and girls who found they had poor access to positions and schooling. In 1862 they published Notes on the South Slavonic Countries in Austria and Turkey in Europe based on Mackenzie's lecture in Bath and Across the Carpathians but they did this anonymously."]}, {"page": "Lady Georgina Sebright", "response": ["#REDIRECT Georgina Muir Mackenzie"]}, {"page": "Georgina Mary Sebright, Lady Sebright", "response": ["#REDIRECT Georgina Muir Mackenzie"]}, {"page": "Georgina Mary Muir Mackenzie", "response": ["#REDIRECT Georgina Muir Mackenzie"]}, {"page": "Georgina Mackenzie", "response": ["#REDIRECT Georgina Muir Mackenzie"]}]}}
