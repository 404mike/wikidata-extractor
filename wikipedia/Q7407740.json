In December, he briefly returned to Scotland when his young son became ill. In 1927, Kennedy began the season with Fall River, played one game, then was transferred to J&P Coats. In 1928, he was again transferred during the season, this time to the New Bedford Whalers. Despite the changes in team, he scored twenty-three goals (thirteen with Coats and ten with New Bedford), placing him sixth on the goals list. In 1929, he was back with J&P Coats, now known as the Pawtucket Rangers under new ownership. He played for the Rangers until 1931.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1926\u201327 American Soccer League", "response": ["| Sam Kennedy"]}, {"page": "1928\u201329 American Soccer League", "response": ["| Sam Kennedy"]}, {"page": "Sam Kennedy", "response": ["Sam Kennedy may refer to:", "* Sam Kennedy (Holby City)", "* Sam Kennedy (Home and Away) ", "* Sam Kennedy (American football) (born 1964), former American football linebacker", "* Sam Kennedy (footballer, born 1881) (1881\u20131955), Scottish international footballer", "* Sam Kennedy (footballer, born 1896) (1896\u20131963), English footballer", "* Sam Kennedy (footballer, born 1899) (1899\u2013?), Scottish footballer", "* Sam Kennedy (baseball executive) (born 1973), president of the Boston Red Sox of Major League Baseball", "* Sam Kennedy, an alias of tax protester Glenn Unger (born 1951)"]}, {"page": "Sam Kennedy (footballer born 1899)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sam Kennedy (footballer, born 1899)"]}]}}
