In December, he briefly returned to Scotland when his young son became ill. In 1927, Kennedy began the season with Fall River, played one game, then was transferred to J&P Coats. In 1928, he was again transferred during the season, this time to the New Bedford Whalers. Despite the changes in team, he scored twenty-three goals (thirteen with Coats and ten with New Bedford), placing him sixth on the goals list. In 1929, he was back with J&P Coats, now known as the Pawtucket Rangers under new ownership. He played for the Rangers until 1931.", "link_mentions": {}}}
