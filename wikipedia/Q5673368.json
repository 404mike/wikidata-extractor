He joined the Labour Party, but after Black Friday moved to the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB).  After studying with A. E. E. Reade, he came to support Leon Trotsky and the International Left Opposition.\nElected to the executive of the Young Communist League in 1926, Wicks attended the International Lenin School in Moscow and the Sixth World Congress of the Comintern.  He began working with the Balham Group of Trotskyists, and was expelled from the CPGB in 1932.  He became a founding member of the Communist League and met Trotsky in Copenhagen but disagreed with Trotsky's advice to join the Independent Labour Party. The Communist League split with the tendency opposed to joining the ILP continuing as the Marxist League (not to be confused with the earlier, unconnected Marxist League aka Marxian League of FA Ridley and Hugo Dewar), which later worked within the Labour Party. He also chaired the British Committee for the Defence of Leon Trotsky. In 1936, Wicks and several others signed a letter to the Manchester Guardian  defending Trotsky's right to asylum and calling for an international inquiry into the Moscow Trials. Wicks was also an active anti-fascist.Wicks began working with C. L. R. James of the Marxist Group, helping James write World Revolution, his 1937 history of the Communist International, and in 1938 their tendencies merged to form the Revolutionary Socialist League.  However, Wicks and the remnants of the former Marxist League soon left and formed the Socialist Anti-War Federation.  In 1940, this group dissolved and he joined the Independent Labour Party.\nAt the end of the Second World War, Wicks joined the Labour Party and became active in NALGO.  In 1971, he became involved with the Trotskyist movement again, joining the forerunner of the Socialist Workers Party (SWP), the International Socialists.  He was part of the 1976 split which formed the Workers League. He would later work with the SWP in various campaigns but never rejoined it.\nNot long before his death he wrote an autobiography, Keeping My Head: The Memoirs of a British Bolshevik, with the help of Logie Barrow.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Communist League (UK, 1932)", "response": ["The Communist League was one of the firstAlexander, Robert Jackson.International Trotskyism, 1929-1985: A Documented Analysis of the Movement.

Along with most of his United Toilers comrades, Harry Wicks joined the Workers Party of America following the liquidation of the Central Caucus split in the summer of 1922. The hatchet was quickly buried. Harry Wicks was named to the governing Central Executive Committee of the WPA by the party's December 1922 convention, as well as to the 11 man \"Executive Council\" which handled day-to-day operations of the party.Draper, The Roots of American Communism, pg. 457, fn. 32. He was also named to the editorial board of the party's weekly newspaper The Worker at that time. He also delivered the report on the printing trades to the first annual convention of William Z. Foster's Trade Union Educational League in August 1922.Gitlow, I Confess,\" pg. 174.", "The year 1923 also saw Harry Wicks named National Organizer for the WPA. In the fall of that year he conducted a 5-week East Coast speaking tour on behalf of the party. Wicks was a delegate to the 3rd Convention of the WPA in 1923 and was a consistent backer of the Pepper-Ruthenberg faction.", "In 1929 the Executive Committee of the Communist International called the American party leadership onto the carpet over the claim of Lovestone and his top associates that the American party was entitled to follow their own particular path to revolution due to the national exceptionalism of the largest country in the capitalist world. A large delegation was dispatched to Moscow, a group which included the representative to the Profintern, Harry Wicks. Lovestone and his associate Benjamin Gitlow refused to accept the admonishment of the Comintern and were subsequently expelled. Wicks chose to accept the Comintern's position, however, and he remained in Moscow. He would subsequently be sent abroad to root out the similar political heresy in Australia.Stuart Macintyre, The Reds: The Communist Party of Australia from Origins to Illegality. Sydney, Australia: Allen and Unwin, 1998. Pp. 170-171.", "In April 1930, Harry M. Wicks, using the pseudonym \"Herbert Moore,\" his given and middle names, arrived in Sydney, Australia as a plenipotentiary representative of the Comintern.Macintyre, The Reds, pg. 170. Wicks made use of the mechanism of self-criticism \u2014 ritual public confession of failings by \"errant\" individuals \u2014 as a means of instilling ideological uniformity and party discipline.Macintyre, The Reds, pg. 170. The best memoir account of the process of self-criticism may be found in Wolfgang Leonhard's Die Revolution entl\u00e4sst ihre Kinder (1957), published in English as Child of the Revolution (1957). Leonhard was a Comintern functionary in Moscow, as was Harry Wicks, and his account of the process of \"criticism/self-criticism\" in the Comintern school is illuminating. Australian party leaders Jack Ryan and Jack Kavanagh were two who ran afoul of Wicks during the reorganization.Macintyre, The Reds, pp. 171-175.", "For his part Harry Wicks, who opened the Congress with a keynote speech lasting four hours, congratulated the loyal majority for conducting a discussion which \"annihilated\" the arguments of the dissidents. \"We are going to have one monolithic whole,\" Wicks confidently predicted.Macintyre, The Reds, pg. 178. Wick's speech was subsequently published in pamphlet form by the Communist Party of Australia as Australia and the World Crisis.", "It bears mentioning that Harry Wicks' well documented Comintern mission in Australia may not have been his only task abroad for Moscow. In his 1940 memoir, former member of the Secretariat of the CPUSA Benjamin Gitlow asserted that \"H.M. Wicks went on special missions to Germany and Central America.\"Gitlow, I Confess, pg. 304. This assertion by Gitlow is unconfirmed.Historian Theodore Draper indicates that Wicks was used by the CI \"in Australia and elsewhere.\" Draper, American Communism and Soviet Russia, pp. 170-171.", "Historian Harvey Klehr asserts that Harry Wicks was the Communist Party's District Organizer for a district which included Chattanooga, Tennessee in the summer of 1931, using the pseudonym \"Allen.\" This matter remains less than certain.Harvey Klehr, The Heyday of American Communism: The Depression Decade.

In 1934 Wicks was the CPUSA's candidate for US Senate from Pennsylvania.Wicks did not do well. In the Socialist Party hotbed of Reading, PA, Wicks polled exactly 53 votes in the November 1934 election, compared to 11,835 for James Maurer of the Socialist Party, 10,303 for the Democratic candidate, and 8,176 for the Republican.

Cannon and the Origins of the American Revolutionary Left, pg. 430, fn. 14. This time the charges stuck and Wicks was expelled. Adding insult to injury, the old accusation which he had dodged in 1923 was revisited and it was declared that Wicks had been a spy ever since joining the party in 1919.Fred Stanton (ed.), James P. Cannon, Writings and Speeches, 1928-31: The Left Opposition in the US, 1928-31. New York: Monad Press, 1981. Page 423.

It was a pioneering Marxist analysis from a Trotskyist perspective of the history of revolutions during the interwar period and of the fundamental conflict between Trotsky and Stalin after the Russian Revolution. James, who was a leading Trotskyist activist in Britain during the 1930s, outlined Russia's transition from communist revolution to a Stalinist totalitarian state bureaucracy building on works such as Trotsky's The Revolution Betrayed. He also provides an account of the ideological contestations within the Communist International while examining its influence on the development of the Soviet Union and its changing role in struggles such as the German Revolution of 1918\u201323, the Chinese Revolution of 1925\u201327 and the Spanish Civil War.  He was helped when writing it by Harry Wicks and other Trotskyists, while Dorothy Pizer typed up the manuscript.  The work was dedicated to the Marxist Group, of which James was then a leading member.", "Outside of active Communists (like John Ross Campbell and Andrew Rothstein, who reviewed the book negatively), the book had a very good reception overall with Trotsky in 1939 calling it 'a very good book'.  George Orwell in 1937 thought it '[a] very able book' while E. H. Carr in 1937 called it 'decidedly useful \u2026 in his analysis of the course of the Russian Revolution and of the point at which it took the wrong turning, Mr. James displays commendable independence of judgment and desire to arrive at the truth'.\"World Revolution by C.L.R.

In January 1929, Glading and Pollitt were in the minority over the question of the progressive (or otherwise) nature of the Labour Party. Then, in July 1928, when it discussed the further question of affiliation to it, extant minutes of this meeting show the members as being split down the middle, nine for and nine against: Glading was in favour of the motion.
