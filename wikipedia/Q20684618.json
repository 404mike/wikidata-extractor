The 5 pounds have to cover food, accommodation and travel; the 5 pounds reflecting an average hourly wage, according to the Department of Trade and Industry in the U.K.. Leon had certain cities he had to pass through and was only ever allowed to stay for 24 hours in each city. The 5 pounds could not roll over and had to be spent. He was presented a new five pound note for each new day. The public could buy him things and he could work for goods, but was never allowed to be given money directly.\nBefore Leon had done the U.K. version, he traveled in America on $5 a day, starting in Times Square, New York and finishing at the Hollywood Sign, Los Angeles.\nAmazing Adventures of a Nobody has been shown on numerous Television Channels including Sky3, Sky Travel, Life One, Extreme Sports Channel & Fox Reality Channel.\nAs of June 2009, a European version in which Logothetis travels from Paris, France all the way to Moscow, Russia on \u20ac5 a day was aired on Dave and was repeated on Blighty.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Greek Americans", "response": ["*Leon Logothetis - British-born author who now lives in Los Angeles, TV host, global adventurer, traveler, and inspirational speaker."]}, {"page": "Category talk:English people of Greek descent", "response": ["Leon Logothetis is missing from the list.123.211.197.7 (talk) 04:54, 26 July 2015 (UTC)"]}, {"page": "The Kindness Diaries", "response": ["The Kindness Diaries is a documentary television series on Discovery+.
