He also played first-class cricket on two occasions.  The first of these was for the West of England against the touring New Zealanders at the County Ground, Exeter in 1927.  He took the wicket of Herb McGirr in this match, while in the West's only batting innings, he was dismissed for a duck by Bill Merritt. His second first-class appearance came for the Minor Counties against Oxford University in 1937. He was dismissed in the Minor Counties first-innings for 8 runs by David Macindoe, while in their second-innings he was dismissed by the same bowler for 8 runs.  With the ball, he took the wickets of Eric Dixon and Alexander Singleton in the Oxford first-innings, while going wicket-less in their second.

However, twelve years later he returned to play a single match in the 1966 Minor Counties Championship against Dorset.  He made a total of 154 appearances for the county in that competition and scored a total of 5,365 runs.
