Butler is Professor of Computer Science at the University of Southampton, England.\nButler was originally from Ireland and received his bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Trinity College, Dublin in 1988. He then undertook an MSc and DPhil at the Programming Research Group in Oxford (1989 and 1992 respectively), working in the area of Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP). Subsequently, he worked for Broadcom in Dublin and at \u00c5bo Akademi University in Turku, Finland with Ralph-Johan Back on Refinement Calculus. He joined the University of Southampton in 1995 as a lecturer, rising to Reader in 2000 and then Professor in the same year.\nHe leads the Dependable Systems & Software Engineering (DSSE) group at the School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton. His main research is in the area of the B-Method (originated by J.-R. Abrial), especially tool support such as ProB (advanced model checking for B which allows for state-of-the-art simulation of Event-B machines in the Rodin/Eclipse platform), U2B (UML and B), csp2B (CSP and B), and the RODIN toolset for Event-B.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of computer scientists", "response": ["* Michael Butler \u2013 Event-B"]}, {"page": "BCS-FACS", "response": ["In recent years, a series of evening seminars have been held, mainly at the BCS London office.
