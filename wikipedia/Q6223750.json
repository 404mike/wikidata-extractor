He was consecrated Bishop of Carlisle on 3 December 1626 at Durham House, London, by Richard Neile, Bishop of Durham; John Buckeridge, Bishop of Rochester; and three other prelates, John Cosin preaching the consecration sermon. His elevation was much canvassed.A letter (13 February 1628) in James Ussher, Archbishop of Armagh's correspondence states that he 'hath sold all his books to Hills the broker . . . some think he paid for his place.' It was said that he had 'sold his orthodoxe bookes and bought Jesuits'.' Sir Walter Earle referred to the matter in parliament (11 February 1628), quoting the line 'Qui color albus erat, nunc est contrarius albo'.Appendix to Sir Francis Seymor his . . . Speech, 1641. He was made Lord Almoner the same year."]}, {"page": "Richard Montagu", "response": ["Controversy around Montagu's positions played an important part in the period 1625\u20139, both in publications and in political moves, and was one of the issues setting the tone for the reign of Charles I. Montagu had the open support of three bishops (John Buckeridge, John Howson, and William Laud). His Appello Caesarem: a just Appeale from two unjust Informers (London, 1625) came out with an imprimatur from Francis White, dean of Carlisle, after George Abbot's refusal to license it. It was partly written in self-justification, but also attacked some Calvinist tenets, including the perseverance of the saints.Kenneth Fincham, Nicholas Tyacke, Altars Restored: The Changing Face of English Religious Worship, 1547-c.1700 (2007), p. 130.
