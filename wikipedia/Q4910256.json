He was signed by Wolverhampton Wanderers in May 1933 for \u00a3100, and made his debut for the club against former team West Bromwich Albion on 17 February 1934, playing as an emergency centre-forward.\nHe remained a back-up player until the 1935\u201336 season when he became a first choice centre-half for the Midlanders. A disappointing start to the next campaign saw him switched to right-back, which would remain his position for the rest of his Molineux career.\nHe played in the 1939 FA Cup Final, where Wolves were surprisingly beaten by Portsmouth, and won three England caps. His international debut came on 16 November 1939 in a 7\u20130 victory over Northern Ireland at Old Trafford.\nThe outbreak of World War II meant the suspension of league football, but Morris turned out 67 times for Wolves in regional games, and also guested for Wrexham. At the resumption of league action in 1946, Morris soon found himself out of the team, and at the end of the 1946\u201347 season he left Wolves.\nHe joined nearby Dudley Town, where he played two further seasons as a centre-forward before retiring in May 1949.\nHe died in 1995, aged 82.", "link_mentions": {}}}
