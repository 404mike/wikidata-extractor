However, a lack of goals and some poor form in the league meant the club faced some fears of relegation to League One, but luckily safety was secured with few games to spare.

After his retirement in 2010, Corica served his time as staff member for the club in various roles of assistant coach, youth team coach and the caretaker first team coach for two games in 2012. The off-season would prove be a crucial first test for Corica in terms of recruitment for some key positions. It had already been announced that key players from prior seasons including Dutch defender Jordy Buijs, former Socceroos Luke Wilkshire, David Carney and Matt Simon had all left the club as well as youth product Anthony Kalik returning to Europe as his loan deal expired.
