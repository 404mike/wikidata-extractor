Born in north London into a family with strong left-wing links, she was personal secretary to Count Mihaly Karolyi, exiled socialist president of Hungary, and later became secretary to the School of Slavonic and East European Studies in London.\nGalton joined the Communist Party of Great Britain, travelled several times to Russia, and Kim Philby, who was actually working for the KGB, took an interest in her. She was under some form of surveillance for much of her working life but no conclusive evidence of espionage was ever found against her. In retirement she became an expert in beekeeping and wrote several books on the subject.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Albert Evans (politician)", "response": ["*Dorothy Galton (sister-in-law)"]}, {"page": "Hyman Levy", "response": ["*Dorothy Galton"]}, {"page": "Dorothy Constance Galton", "response": ["#REDIRECT Dorothy Galton"]}, {"page": "Bounds Green Road", "response": ["*The former home of communist and university administrator Dorothy Galton at number 49."]}, {"page": "Galton (name)", "response": ["* Dorothy Galton (1901\u20131992), British university administrator"]}]}}
