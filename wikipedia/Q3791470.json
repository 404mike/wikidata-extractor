After a spell with Hamilton Academical, Crawford joined Hearts in August 1954. He scored 58 goals in 127 league appearances as Hearts won two league championships and the Scottish Cup during his time at the club.\nHe was transferred to West Ham United for \u00a310,000 in July 1961, where he played alongside Bobby Moore under the management of Ron Greenwood.
