Jack Meadows led a team at Leicester University, including John K. Davies and Simon F. Green, which searched the rejected sources for moving objects.

The comets included 126P/IRAS, 161P/Hartley\u2013IRAS, and comet IRAS\u2013Araki\u2013Alcock (C/1983 H1), which made a close approach to the Earth in 1983.
