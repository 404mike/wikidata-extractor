After a winless November, Reading beat Norwich 3\u20130 in the league before progressing to the fourth round of the FA Youth Cup with a 3\u20131 win over Leeds United. The year ended on a bad note after a 6\u20130 loss to Chelsea, though away from the pitch there was good news with four second year scholars: Dominic Hyam, Liam Kelly, Aaron Kuhl and Jack Stacey, all signing their first professional contracts, tying each of them to the club until summer 2016. In the league, Reading's indifferent form continued throughout January and February with just two wins from seven, though in the Youth Cup, victories over Crewe Alexandra and Accrington Stanley ensured progress into the quarter-finals. The under-18s took on Liverpool at the Madejski Stadium in the last eight and, with the game finishing 4\u20134 after extra time, required a 5\u20134 win in the resulting penalty shoot-out to reach the last four of the Youth Cup for the first time in their history. The side faced Fulham in the semi-final with the first leg finishing in a 2\u20132 draw at the Madejski Stadium. In the return leg at Craven Cottage Reading found themselves leading thanks to goals from Tarique Fosu-Henry and Jack Stacey, though a last minute Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 strike gave Fulham a 3\u20132 win on the night and a 5\u20134 aggregate victory. After the cup exit the side won three of their last four games to finish third in the South Group of the Under-18 Premier League. With nine goals each, Harry Cardwell and Liam Kelly were the Academy's joint top scorers. Of the six players whose futures were uncertain upon the conclusion of the season, three: Nana Owusu, George McLennan and Rob Dickie were offered their first professional contracts while the others were released."]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 Reading F.C. season", "response": ["| Aaron Kuhl", "|28||||MF||Aaron Kuhl||1||0||0||0||0||0||1||0"]}, {"page": "2015\u201316 Reading F.C. season", "response": ["On transfer deadline day, Reading sold defender Michael Hector to Chelsea, before loaning him back for the remainder of the season, loaned out Aaron Kuhl to Dundee United until 4 January 2016, and signed Mat\u011bj Vydra and Ola John join the club on season-long loan deal from Watford and Benfica respectively.", "On 10 December, Rob Dickie extended his loan with Cheltenham Town until the end of January, with Aaron Kuhl returning early from his loan spell with Dundee United on 14 December.", "On 9 May, it was confirmed that Reading would not be renewing the contracts of Anton Ferdinand, Hal Robson-Kanu, Simon Cox, Nana Owusu, Pierce Sweeney, Lewis Collins, Noor Husin, Hammad Lawal, Sam\u00fael Fri\u00f0j\u00f3nsson, Conor Shaughnessy and Bogdan Va\u0161t\u0161uk.
