It was in 1975 that the dance group, Bock Yuan Fannee, was formed by Colin Jerry specifically to perform Manx dances. Working closely with Mona Douglas, together they reconstructed the remaining dances from Douglas\u2019 notes.

Although a complete rewrite of the play was prepared by Stewart Bennett to address contemporary politics, the version eventually performed was an amalgamation of the 1832 and 1845 versions, with other slight additions. On the last Saturday before Christmas 1975 they performed the play concluding with the sword dance at fourteen locations all over the Isle of Man."]}]}}
