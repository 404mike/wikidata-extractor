However, recalled to the side in July 1961 and used as an opener in the match against Kent at Maidstone in the absence of the regular opener Geoff Smith, he hit 95. When Smith was injured for the first month of the 1962 season, Bear took his place as Gordon Barker's regular opening partner, and remained as an opening batsman for most of the rest of his first-class career, Smith moving down to No 3 on his return to the side. 1962 was by some distance Bear's most successful so far as a batsman. He made 1613 runs in all matches, and was Essex's leading scorer in County Championship games; his batting average rose to nearly 30 runs per innings. He made two centuries to add to his single previous effort five years earlier. Against Middlesex at Lord's in May he scored 117; and with Smith back in the team, Bear made 107 as an opener against Kent at Romford in early June."]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1946\u20131977)", "response": ["* Geoff Smith (1963) : G.
