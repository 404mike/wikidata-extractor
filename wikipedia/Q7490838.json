Also that year, he received a Laurence Olivier Award nomination for his work in the stage musical Parade, and the following year played Mufasa in a London production of The Lion King. Escoffery's other West End credits include Les Mis\u00e9rables, Smokey Joe's Caf\u00e9, Tommy and Mama I Want to Sing.In 2014, Escoffery returned to the recording studio to release a new album, In the Red Room for Dome Records.

Three further singles, \"People\", \"Nobody Knows\" and \"Perfect Love Affair\", also entered the UK Airplay chart.
