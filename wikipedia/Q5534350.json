After he retired from playing, Twentyman became chief scout at Liverpool, working with Shankly and finding several outstandingly talented players.Kelly, p. 62.", "Many of the new players came to Liverpool because of a new scouting system created by Shankly in 1967 and placed under the control of new chief scout Geoff Twentyman, who had played for Shankly at Carlisle and had then spent several seasons at Liverpool, retiring shortly before Shankly's appointment. According to Stephen Kelly, hiring Twentyman as chief scout was \"perhaps Shankly's finest signing ever\".Kelly, p. 244. It was through Twentyman that Liverpool found the new players and, after Shankly retired, Twentyman gave sterling service to Bob Paisley and Joe Fagan by finding players including Phil Neal, Alan Hansen and Ian Rush.Kelly, pp. 245\u2013246. As always, Shankly kept things simple and Twentyman was told to look for a prospect's basic qualities which were the abilities to pass the ball and move into position to receive a pass.Hughes, p. 17. Shankly also wanted Twentyman to check the player's personality and ensure he had the right attitude for a professional footballer. Above all, said Twentyman, \"he wanted to know if the lad had the heart to play for Liverpool\". Although Shankly sometimes paid large transfer fees he was loath to do so and Twentyman's brief was to find young players so he (Shankly) could mould them into what he wanted.Hughes, p. 44."]}, {"page": "Kevin Keegan", "response": ["In 1971, he attracted the attention of Liverpool's head scout Geoff Twentyman, whose opinion was held in high regard by manager Bill Shankly. After Twentyman's recommendation, Liverpool made an offer for Keegan and this offer was accepted by Scunthorpe United. After Scunthorpe had agreed to the fee Keegan was driven the four hours to Bill Shankly's office by manager Ron Ashman who was determined to get a cash influx for Scunthorpe United. Prior to the journey Keegan's father prompted Keegan to not sell himself cheap. Keegan then haggled a contract worth \u00a350 a week from Shankly, after Shankly had originally offered him \u00a345. Ashman, sensing a cash windfall may fall through, was at one stage aghast at Keegan's negotiation game. On the drive back to Scunthorpe Ashman was critical of Keegan's bluff that he was almost earning \u00a345 a week at a fourth division football club."]}, {"page": "Ian Rush", "response": ["Despite interest from Manchester City, and in spite of Rush being a boyhood Everton fan, Liverpool won the race to sign the 19-year-old in April 1980, though he had to remain at Chester until the end of the season as the transfer deadline (27 March 1980) had passed. Recommended by chief scout Geoff Twentyman, Liverpool paid a record fee for a teenager of \u00a3300,000. It remained Chester City's record sale until they went bankrupt in March 2010. Rush was managed throughout his time at Chester by Alan Oakes, although much of the credit for his development is given to youth manager Cliff Sear. Nearly 20 years later, Rush and Sear worked together on the coaching staff at Wrexham."]}, {"page": "Carlisle United F.C.", "response": ["In 1949, the club became the first to appoint Bill Shankly as manager. Shankly, a former player at Carlisle, later went on to manage local rivals Workington (helping them finish above Carlisle for the first time) before being appointed as manager of Liverpool in 1959; over the next 15 years he would guide that club to numerous trophy successes. It is at Carlisle where he met local player Geoff Twentyman, who he would later sign as head scout at Liverpool, and lifelong friend Ivor Broadis. Broadis, who was playing for Sunderland but living and training with Carlisle, once arrived late for training and Shankly asserted that he would play by United's training rules even if he didn't play there. According to Shankly, he said to Broadis: \"What do you think you're doing? Who do you think you are? If you do the training we do you can train with us and we'll play five-a-side and you'll run your guts out as an example to everybody else\"."]}, {"page": "Morecambe F.C.", "response": ["|  Geoff Twentyman"]}, {"page": "Scout (sport)", "response": ["*Geoff Twentyman"]}, {"page": "Ballymena United F.C.", "response": ["Former Liverpool legend, Geoff Twentyman, then came along as manager and brought the Ulster Cup to the Showgrounds in 1960 with a 3\u20131 win over Glenavon.
