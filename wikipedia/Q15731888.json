Modern SMS text messaging is usually messaging from one mobile phone to another. Finnish Radiolinja became the first network to offer a commercial person-to-person SMS text messaging service in 1994. When Radiolinja's domestic competitor, Telecom Finland (now part of TeliaSonera) also launched SMS text messaging in 1995 and the two networks offered cross-network SMS functionality, Finland became the first nation where SMS text messaging was offered on a competitive as well as on a commercial basis. GSM was allowed in the United States and the radio frequencies were blocked and awarded to US \"Carriers\" to use US technology. Hence there is no \"development\" in the US in mobile messaging service. The GSM in the US had to use a frequency allocated for private communication services (PCS) \u2013 what the ITU frequency r\u00e9gime had blocked for DECT \u2013 Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications \u2013 1000-feet range picocell, but survived. American Personal Communications (APC), the first GSM carrier in America, provided the first text-messaging service in the United States. Sprint Telecommunications Venture, a partnership of Sprint Corp. and three large cable-TV companies, owned 49 percent of APC. The Sprint venture was the largest single buyer at a government-run spectrum auction that raised $7.7 billion in 2005 for PCS licenses. APC operated under the brand name of Sprint Spectrum and launched its service on 15 November 1995, in Washington, D.C. and in Baltimore, Maryland. Vice President Al Gore in Washington, D.C. made the initial phone-call to launch the network, calling Mayor Kurt Schmoke in Baltimore."]}, {"page": "History of communication", "response": ["* 1992 \u2013 Neil Papworth sends the first SMS (or text message), on the Vodafone network."]}, {"page": "List of English inventions and discoveries", "response": ["* 3 December 1992: The world's first text/SMS message (\"Merry Christmas\") sent over the Vodafone GSM network by Neil Papworth (born 1969)."]}, {"page": "Airwide Solutions", "response": ["Neil Papworth, a test engineer at Sema at the time, sent the world's first SMS message from an R&D lab using a personal computer to Richard Jarvis of Vodafone using an Orbitel 901 handset in December 1992."]}]}}
