E. Baynes started studying the variable sweep wing. He devised a method of varying the tail geometry as well in order to stabilise the centre of lift; no sliding mechanism was necessary, instead, the wing wake interacted with the variable tail to effect the necessary trim changes. During 1949 and 1951, Baynes filed patent applications associated with this work.UK Patent GB664058A, EspacenetUK Patent GB713525A, Espacenet While the design reached the physical modelling stage and was subject to a complete round of wind tunnel tests, the British Government failed to provide financial backing for the work, allegedly due to budget constraints at the time."]}, {"page": "Variable-pitch propeller (aeronautics)", "response": ["In 1919 L.

The Scud was popular, and in 1932 a development of it, the Scud II model was launched.
