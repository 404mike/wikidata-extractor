The script was given to BBC Head of Drama Series & Serials, Jonathan Powell, who encouraged Kennedy Martin to continue its development.Pixley, Get It While It's Hot, p. 53. The script went through many changes and revisions. A particular influence was the speech made by President Ronald Reagan on 23 March 1983 announcing the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) which proposed protecting the United States from attack by nuclear missiles. One of the supporters of SDI was Lyndon LaRouche, on whom Kennedy Martin based the character of Jerry Grogan, owner of the Fusion Corporation of Kansas. Kennedy Martin was also influenced by the secrecy surrounding the UK's policy on nuclear power in light of the inquiry into the construction of the Sizewell B nuclear power station and the concerns about the safety record of the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant; this led him to conceive International Irradiated Fuels and its chief executive Robert Bennett.", "By 1983, Jonathan Powell was keen to put the serial into production and offered the scripts to producer Michael Wearing who was immediately impressed by the scenes in the first episode, \"Compassionate Leave\", depicting Craven's reaction to Emma's death, describing them as \"the most sustained evocation of individual grief in bereavement that I can remember\".Pixley, Get It While It's Hot, p. 54.

Further clashes over the script occurred between Kennedy Martin and star Bob Peck over the conclusion in which his character would turn into a tree; Peck recalled that \"it didn't seem to be working in script terms, it seemed as though we wouldn't be able to make it work for the audience\", a view echoed by Michael Wearing who felt that it was \"likely not to come off as an effect\". Kennedy Martin capitulated, introducing instead the concept of the black flowers seen in the finished production. However, some elements of Kennedy Martin's original vision persist in the final script: for example, in episode three, \"Burden of Proof\", the ghost of Emma urges Craven, as he undergoes a breakdown, to be strong, like a tree.Lavender, Edge of Darkness (Troy Kennedy Martin), p. 113."]}, {"page": "Michael Wearing", "response": ["The first project he was given there by Head of Series & Serials Jonathan Powell was a Troy Kennedy Martin project entitled Edge of Darkness.
