It was chaired by Sir Henry Walker, His Majesty's Chief Inspector of Mines, who had himself been in the pit during the rescue attempts. The miners, through the North Wales Miners' Association, were represented by Sir Stafford Cripps; the mine owners, mindful of the fact they could face criminal charges, hired a formidable legal team including Hartley Shawcross.  Two mining assessors, one approved by the miners and the other by the colliery management, were also appointed to assist Walker and the inquiry. Local interest in the inquiry was enormous: as time went on the colliery officials called as witnesses faced increasing hostility from the public gallery, to the degree the atmosphere began to affect the quality of their evidence. The inquiry was marked by sensational allegations about the conduct of both sides: it was claimed that the deputies had after the accident held meetings together with the inspectorate, leading to a protest by miners, and there were several comments that the unions had paid miners to give evidence, causing an uproar in court."]}, {"page": "Minnie Pit Disaster", "response": ["A formal investigation of the causes and circumstances of the disaster was launched under section 83 of the Coal Mines Act 1911.

Both sides employed barristers, Hartley Shawcross for the owners; while the MFGB were offered pro bono publico the services of Labour MP and barrister Sir Stafford Cripps.", "The report noted that before the accident ventilation in some districts was possibly inadequate: in particular, it was noted that 14's and 29's districts were poorly ventilated. The report after the accident, considered that the main return airway for the 109's, 14's and 29's districts was far too small at 4 feet by 4 (according to one witness).Report by Sir Henry Walker in Colliery Engineering, March 1937 Evidence was given that 95's and 24's district, at 2,600 feet deep, was uncomfortably hot. There were numerous breaches of regulations regarding the firing of explosive charges in 14's district, taking of dust samples, and other matters.At the inquiry a pit deputy (whose job was to oversee the safety of the workings) admitted that he carried out shotfiring during his shifts in addition to his other duties. It was revealed that he fired more charges during his shift than a full-time shotfirer could have safely carried out. The colliery had made an operating loss in 1933, and the manager, William Bonsall, had been under pressure from the Dennis family to increase profitability.Inquiry Failed to Heal the Wounds, Wrexham Chronicle, 30-09-04 He had spent little time in the Dennis section of the pit in the months before the disaster, as he was overseeing the installation of new machinery in the mine's other section, the South-Eastern or Slant.", "Subsequent to the accident a number of theories were advanced in the Report as to the explosion's exact cause: Sir Stafford Cripps, the miners' legal representative, suggested that an explosion had been triggered in 95's by shotfiring (the firing of explosive charges) near a main airway. The miners' appointed Assessor also surmised that a large quantity of gas had accumulated at the top of the face in 14's district, which was then ignited by an accident with a safety lamp or by a spark from a coalcutter. The legal representatives of the pit's management, however, suggested that firedamp had accumulated in the main Dennis haulage road beyond the Clutch (a junction on the main drift where the underground haulage machinery was located) and which was ignited at the Clutch when a telephone was used to warn miners of the influx of gas.Report by Sir Henry Walker in Colliery Engineering, March 1937 This interpretation sought to deny that poor working practices were the ultimate cause of the disaster."]}, {"page": "Henry Walker", "response": ["Henry Walker may refer to:", "*Henry Walker (basketball) (born 1987), American basketball player previously known as Bill Walker", "*Henry Walker (cricketer) (1807\u20131872), English cricketer", "*Sir Henry Walker (mines inspector) (1873\u20131954), English Chief Inspector of Mines", "*Henry Walker (rugby union), English rugby union player"]}, {"page": "1928 Birthday Honours", "response": ["*Henry Walker  His Majesty's Chief Inspector of Mines"]}, {"page": "John Brass (colliery manager)", "response": ["On Saturday 22 September 1934 at 2:08 a.m. a violent explosion ripped through the Dennis section of Gresford Colliery.

The outcome was unusual for all three men arrived at different conclusions with the assessors' reports being presented as appendices to the main report.  The official finding, as presented by the commissioner Sir Henry Walker, viewed with suspicion shot firing activities.  The other assessor, Mr Joseph Jones, was concerned about a possible firedamp build up on one of the faces which was ignited by an accident with a safety lamp or from a spark from a mechanised coalcutter.  Brass however was concerned about the telephones which were not of an approved type.  He surmised that the explosion could have been caused by a gas build on one of the main access tunnels which was ignited by the telephone being called."]}]}}
