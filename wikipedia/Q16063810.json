This manual, though slighter than the subsequent works of Cuvier, Carus, and others, and not to be compared with such later expositions as that of Gegenbaur, was long esteemed for the accuracy of the author's own observations, and his just appreciation of the labors of his predecessors."]}, {"page": "Coulson", "response": ["*William Coulson (1802\u20131877), English surgeon"]}, {"page": "Chester Terrace", "response": ["There are two blue plaques on the street: one at No. 13 for the architect Charles Robert Cockerell,Rennison, N.

At that point the shared medical school of Guy's Hospital and St. Thomas's Hospital was divided. Tyrrell lectured at the Aldersgate School, but later took a position at St. Thomas's, and was no longer involved with the Aldersgate school. Lawrence was also an early supporter of the school, lecturing on surgery in 1826\u20137; but he withdrew after taking a position at St. Bartholomew's Hospital. Lawrence was a reformer, and the background was his opposition to an 1824 regulation of the Royal College of Surgeons aiming to limit the number of medical schools that a surgical student could attend. He saw this measure as intended to force students into the hospital medical schools. Jones Quain taught anatomy alongside Lawrence; but he had to drop out following a dissection wound."]}, {"page": "List of burials at Kensal Green Cemetery", "response": ["* William Coulson (1802\u20131877)"]}, {"page": "Coulson, William", "response": ["#redirectWilliam Coulson"]}, {"page": "Will Coulson", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Coulson"]}]}}
