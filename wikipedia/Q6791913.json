Holmes had to have four operations on his leg following a tackle by Muscat in 1998, and there were initial fears that his leg might have to be amputated. The claim was settled at the High Court without any admission of liability. In a League Cup tie while at Millwall, he grabbed the throat of Liverpool striker Milan Baro\u0161. Also in 2004, Iwan Roberts admitted he deliberately stamped on Muscat in a match against Norwich City in revenge for his attempt to injure Craig Bellamy in 1999. Roberts was subsequently fined and suspended by The Football Association for his comments."]}, {"page": "History of West Ham United F.C.", "response": ["One of Redknapp's first actions as West Ham manager was to re-sign striker Tony Cottee from Everton.

Redknapp also attempted to bring through the young talent of Matthew Rush, Steve Jones and Matty Holmes. Cottee started the second spell of his West Ham career well, forming a solid partnership with Trevor Morley that was aided by Ian Bishop, Dale Gordon and the aggressive Martin Allen in midfield. The team defied the popular belief that they would return to the First Division by finishing 13th. In addition, John Moncur was added from relegated Swindon Town.", "West Ham avoided relegation again in the 1994\u201395 season and played their part in the final-day drama of the season, holding Manchester United to a 1\u20131 draw at Upton Park and denying them a third successive Premiership title. On paper, the team was routinely outclassed by opposition, but on grass it put in a series of superb performances. Old hand Alvin Martin partnered Steve Potts, Tim Breacker and Dicks with longterm custodian Lud\u011bk Miklo\u0161ko in goal to form a stout defence that made up for the deficiencies elsewhere in midfield and up front, which had seen a number of players move on, including fan favourite Matty Holmes, to newly christened league champions Blackburn Rovers for \u00a31.5\u00a0million."]}, {"page": "Matty (name)", "response": ["* Matty Holmes (born 1969), English former footballer"]}, {"page": "Bobby Moore", "response": ["The first West Ham home game after his death was on 6 March 1993, against Wolverhampton Wanderers.
