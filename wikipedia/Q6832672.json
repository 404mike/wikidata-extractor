His final aggregate of 600 first-class runs was the most he scored in any season, albeit with only two fifties and an average of little more than 20.\nHe again played a fair number of first-team games in 1981, and claimed his only three first-class wickets when he took 3/20 against Middlesex at Lord's,\nbut he was confined to the Second XI after mid-July and left Essex at the end of the season.\nWithout a first-class county to play for in 1982, McEvoy turned out for Cambridgeshire in minor counties cricket, and made his maiden List A half-century in scoring 52 against Warwickshire in the NatWest Trophy.\nIn 1983, he returned to senior cricket with Worcestershire, and near the end of the season hit his only first-class hundred when he struck 103 against Warwickshire.\nHe averaged 22.76 in scoring 569 first-class runs that summer, his highest in any season, but in 1984 that figure collapsed to 14.46, and his total of 188 runs from 13 innings told its own story.That was that as far as McEvoy's first-class career was concerned, but he then enjoyed several seasons with Suffolk, playing quite regularly from 1985 until 1990, and then occasionally until 1992.\nHe scored four centuries in the space of six weeks in 1989,\nand appeared in Suffolk's losing Championship final against Cheshire in 1985, though he was dismissed for just 5.\nHe played one List A game in the NatWest Trophy each year from 1985 to 1990.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "McEvoy", "response": ["* Michael McEvoy (born 1956), Indian-born English cricketer"]}, {"page": "List of Cambridgeshire County Cricket Club List A players", "response": ["*Michael McEvoy, 1 match, 1982 "]}, {"page": "McEvoy, Michael", "response": ["#redirectMichael McEvoy"]}]}}
