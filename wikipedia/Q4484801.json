In Dukas's piano works critics have discerned the influence of Beethoven, or, \"Beethoven as he was interpreted to the French mind by C\u00e9sar Franck\". Both works were premiered by \u00c9douard Risler, a celebrated pianist of the era.Lockspeiser, p. 90 There are also two smaller works for piano solo.  The Sonata, described by the critic Edward Lockspeiser as \"huge and somewhat recondite\",Lockspeiser, p. 92 did not enter the mainstream repertoire, but it has been more recently championed by such pianists as Marc-Andr\u00e9 Hamelin and Margaret Fingerhut.Nicholas, Jeremy. \"Dukas\", Gramophone, July 2006, p. 74, accessed 18 March 2011Chandos CD 8765 (1988) Lockspeiser describes the Rameau Variations as more developed and assured ...
