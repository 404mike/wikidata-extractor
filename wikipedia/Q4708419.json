White together with his colleague, John Fairhurst, examined Tuckman's development sequence when developing the White-Fairhurst TPR model.

This is then followed by a \"performing\" phase that leads to a new performance level which they call the \"reforming\" phase. Their work was developed further by White in his essay \"From Comfort Zone to Performance Management\"White A, From Comfort Zone to Performance Management, 2009, White & MacLean Publishing in which he demonstrates the linkage between Tuckman's work with that of Colin Carnall's \"coping cycle\" and the \"comfort zone theory\"."]}, {"page": "Alasdair White (management author)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alasdair A.
