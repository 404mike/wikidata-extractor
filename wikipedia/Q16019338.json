She left school at age 16 and began to teach music in local private schools in Sunderland and Newcastle. At the age of 17 she was asked to teach for the local education authority, leading her to look for a published violin method on which to base her teaching. In 1933 after failing to find a satisfactory book she decided to begin writing out the lessons she taught to her students. These lessons would eventually become the foundation of her own violin method which was published as a series of books .In 1945, she married Ephraim Smith, a businessman in the cloth industry, whose parents were also Jewish immigrants from Lithuania. Cohen had two daughters, Maureen and Hazel, born in Leeds.  She studied the violin with Max Rostal and Carl Flesch . She died at the age of 96, survived by her daughters, two granddaughters and a great-granddaughter.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2012 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Eta Cohen, 96, violin teacher and author."]}, {"page": "Deaths in December 2012", "response": ["*Eta Cohen, 96, English violin teacher and author.Eta Cohen: Best-selling violin tutor dies aged 96"]}, {"page": "Eta (given name)", "response": ["*Eta Cohen, English violinist"]}]}}
