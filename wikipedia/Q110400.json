From 1948, Zeitlyn also found cartoons portraying concern about the 'bureaucratic consequences' of the NHS. The number of critical cartoons about NHS policy increased from the 1960s, as the NHS faced cuts, and the satire movement emerged in Britain.  In December 1960, cartoonist Victor Weisz drew an image for the Evening Standard showing Minister for Health Enoch Powell as a surgeon covered in blood, accusing him of making too many cuts.  Other cartoonists suggested that too much was being spent on the NHS.  For example, in the Daily Mail in 1968, John Musgrave-Wood drew a man to portray the NHS, who was wearing a dunce's cap and being fed 'Defence Cuts'.  Many cartoons have been very interested in portraying NHS staff, both their lives and industrial conflict.  The cartoonist Carl Giles, who often drew for the Daily Express, was very interested in drawing nurses in particular.  Historian Jack Saunders has argued that Giles' presentation shifted from presenting nurses from 'caring and sexualised' to 'bolshie and assertive'.  Giles sent a cartoon of nurses stealing peas from patients directly to the East Suffolk Nurses League.  On the cartoon, Giles wrote 'with deepest sympathy', referring to the cutting of food allowances."]}, {"page": "Supermac (cartoon)", "response": ["With its rather dismissive caption, \"How to Try to Continue to be Top Without Actually Having Been There\",See, e.g., Dominic Sandbrook (1994) Never Had It So Good the cartoon image, by \"Vicky\" (Victor Weisz)See J.

Joss also mixed with many other artists in different circles, beyond that of the newspaper, and he enjoyed long friendships with Oscar Kokoschka and the cartoonist Vicky (Victor Weisz). Joss often attended theatre opening nights and film premiers in his role as \"Joss of The Star\" and produced many caricatures of famous actors of the day. This extended to directors, musicians, singers and writers too. His caricature of Vivien Leigh in costume ran on the front page heralding her discovery in the play.
