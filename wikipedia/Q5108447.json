In the 1970s he was a member of the London Film-Makers' Co-op (now LUX film distributors), and co-founder of the Digital Media Studio (now Slade Centre for Electronic Media in Fine Art)  at the Slade School of Fine Arts, UCL, London. He is considered one of the pioneers of expanded cinema and moving image installation and was one of the first artists to exhibit film installations at the Tate and Hayward galleries London. His expanded cinema works and installations have since continued to break new conceptual ground and attract critical attention. A. L. Reece, in British Film Institute's A History of Experimental Film and Video, wrote: \"Twenty-five years ago, when he made his first projections for large spaces, film and art rarely met in the gallery; now it is common and installation art is a distinct practice.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Chelsea College of Arts", "response": ["* Chris Welsby (experimental filmmaker)"]}, {"page": "Welsby", "response": ["*Chris Welsby (born 1948), filmmaker"]}, {"page": "List of alumni of the Central School of Art and Design", "response": ["* Chris Welsby"]}, {"page": "Shaheen Merali", "response": ["* Aug 9th \u2013 Nov 11th.

P. Adams Sitney identified it as an early example of what he termed structural film, in particular for its monomorphic form and its emphasis on the mechanics of filmmaking tools. Filmmaker Chris Welsby remarked that \"it has taken me, quite literally, all my life so far to truly appreciate the simple elegant beauty of this cinematic gem. There is nothing in the film that could be changed for the better.\" Phil Solomon called it \"one of the great works of film art\"."]}]}}
