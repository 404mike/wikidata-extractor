He is the original guitarist and the longest continuous member of the British rock band Marillion.

Madonna has also cited Mitchell as the first female artist that really spoke to her as a teenager; \"I was really, really into Joni Mitchell. I knew every word to Court and Spark; I worshipped her when I was in high school. Blue is amazing.

According to an unauthorised biography, Courtney Love of Hole listened to Bush among other artists as a teenager. Tricky wrote an article about The Kick Inside, saying: \"Her music has always sounded like dreamland to me.... I don't believe in God, but if I did, her music would be my bible\". Suede front-man Brett Anderson stated about Hounds of Love: \"I love the way it's a record of two halves, and the second half is a concept record about fear of drowning. It's an amazing record to listen to really late at night, unsettling and really jarring\". John Lydon, better known as Johnny Rotten of the Sex Pistols, declared her work to be \"beauty beyond belief\". Rotten once wrote a song for her, titled \"Bird in Hand\" (about exploitation of parrots) that Bush rejected. Bush was one of the singers whom Prince thanked in the liner notes of 1991's Diamonds and Pearls. In December 1989, Robert Smith of the Cure chose \"The Sensual World\" as his favourite single of the year, The Sensual World as his favourite album of the year, and included \"all of Kate Bush\" in his list of \"the best things about the eighties\"."]}, {"page": "November 25", "response": ["*  1959   \u2013 Steve Rothery, English guitarist and songwriter "]}, {"page": "Marillion", "response": ["In 1977, Mick Pointer joined Electric Gypsy, which also included Doug Irvine on bass, Alan King on vocals and Andy Glass (later of Solstice) on guitar. Pointer and Irvine left to form their own band, Silmarillion, named after J.R.R. Tolkien's book The Silmarillion, in late 1978. They played one London show as an instrumental band with Neal Cockle (keys) and Martin Jenner (guitar). 1979 saw a new line-up of Mick Pointer, Steve Rothery, Doug Irvine and Brian Jelliman. They played their first concert at Berkhamsted Civic Centre, Hertfordshire, on 1 March 1980. According to Pointer, it was at this stage that the name was shortened to Marillion.Carol Clarke, \"Marillion In Words & Pictures\" (1985)", "Afraid of Sunlight would be the band's last album with record label EMI Records. Once again, it received limited promotion, no mainstream radio airplay and its sales were disappointing for the band. Despite this, it was one of their most critically acclaimed albums and was included in Q's 50 Best Albums of 1995.Q, February 1996. One track of note on the album is Out of This World, a song about Donald Campbell, who died while trying to set a speed record on water. The song inspired an effort to recover both Campbell's body and the \"Bluebird K7,\" the boat which Campbell crashed in, from the water. The recovery was finally undertaken in 2001, and both Steve Hogarth and Steve Rothery were invited. In 1998, Steve Hogarth said this was the best album he had made with the band.", "thumb|275px|right| Marillion in 2007, left to right: Steve Rothery, Steve Hogarth, Pete Trewavas (front row), Mark Kelly, Ian Mosley (back row) The band's management organised the biggest promotional schedule since they had left EMI and Steve Hogarth secured interviews with prominent broadcasters on BBC Radio, including Matthew Wright, Bob Harris, Stuart Maconie, Simon Mayo and Mark Lawson. Marbles also became the band's most critically acclaimed album since Afraid of Sunlight, prompting many positive reviews in the press.Betty Clarke The Guardian, 30 April 2004.Tim Jones Record Collector, May 2004, Issue 297.Jon Hotten Classic Rock, May 2004, Issue 66.Roger Newell Guitarist, June 2004Simon Gausden Powerplay, June 2004Guitar, June 2004The Star, June 2004 The band released \"You're Gone\" as the lead single from the album. Aware that it was unlikely to gain much mainstream radio airplay, the band released the single in three separate formats and encouraged fans to buy a copy of each to get the single into the UK Top Ten. The single reached No.\u00a07, making it the first Marillion song to reach the UK Top Ten since \"Incommunicado\" in 1987 and the band's first Top 40 entry since \"Beautiful\" in 1995. The second single from the album, \"Don't Hurt Yourself\", reached No.\u00a016. Following this, they released a download-only single, \"The Damage (live)\", recorded at the band's sell-out gig at the London Astoria. All of this succeeded in putting the band back in the public consciousness, making the campaign a success. In September 2004 Marillion returned for shows in Mexico, USA and ended in Canada Quebec City on 13 October 2004.", "Marillion's music has changed stylistically throughout their career. The band themselves stated that each new album tends to represent a reaction to the preceding one, and for this reason their output is difficult to 'pigeonhole'. Although the band has featured two very distinct and different vocalists, the core instrumental line-up of Steve Rothery (lead guitar, and the sole 'pre-Fish' original member), Pete Trewavas (bass), Mark Kelly (keyboards) and Ian Mosley (drums) has been unchanged since 1984.", "Their 1980s sound (with Fish on vocals) was guitar and keyboard-led neo-progressive rock. They have been described at their outset as \"a bridge between punk and classic progressive rock\". Guitarist Steve Rothery wrote most of the music during the period Fish was in the band. Iron Maiden guitarist Janick Gers commented, \"What I love so much about Marillion is that they could be very strong and powerful and have very quiet passages, but the powerful stuff was really edgy and heavy... I just thought he (Fish) wrote good lyrics, and they wrote good music, and it fit together effortlessly.\"", "*Steve Rothery \u2013 electric guitars, acoustic guitars (1979\u2013present)", "* Steve Rothery \u2013 electric guitars, acoustic guitars", "* Steve Rothery \u2013 electric guitars, acoustic guitars", "* Steve Rothery \u2013 electric guitars, acoustic guitars", "* Steve Rothery \u2013 electric guitars, acoustic guitars", "* Steve Rothery \u2013 electric guitars, acoustic guitars", "* Steve Rothery \u2013 electric guitars, acoustic guitars", "* Steve Rothery \u2013 electric guitars, acoustic guitars", "* Steve Rothery \u2013 electric guitars, acoustic guitars", "* Steve Rothery \u2013 electric guitars, acoustic guitars"]}, {"page": "Buckinghamshire", "response": ["* Steve Rothery, musician with Marillion, lives in Whitchurch"]}, {"page": "Fish (singer)", "response": ["Fish joined Marillion in 1981.

In the Pearl Jam documentary Pearl Jam Twenty, the members jokingly refer to the fact that while the core lineup of the group has remained unchanged (singer Eddie Vedder, guitarists Mike McCready and Stone Gossard, and bassist Jeff Ament), the band has had five drummers. They describe this as \"very Spinal Tap of us\". In the documentary, a mock silent film called The Drummer Story is shown explaining what happened to their previous drummers.
