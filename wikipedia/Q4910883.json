He left school at 14 and became a crane operator in the iron and steel industry, becoming active in forerunners of the ISTC. He remained in north-east England until he moved south with his two children and his wife Joan.Sirs is best remembered for his involvement in the steelworkers' strike of 1980. During the action, Sirs came into conflict with Ian MacGregor, the man appointed by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to slim down British Steel Corporation, then a nationalised industry. Sirs was quoted as saying, \"We are being looked upon as the worst producing steel nation in Europe\".Sirs subsequently incurred the wrath of other trade unionists by his intervention in the miners' strike of 1984.Sirs was a member of the St Ermin's group, an organised group of right-wing trade unionists meeting at the St Ermin's Hotel with the aim of preventing the Bennite left taking over the Labour Party.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Battle of Orgreave", "response": ["In the early days of the 1984\u20131985 strike, the NUM made a decision to picket the integrated steel complexes. Scargill invoked the notion of the old Triple Alliance whereby the unions in coal, steel and rail were bound to support one another, and asked steelworkers not to handle deliveries of coal. Bill Sirs of the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation (ISTC) rejected such calls on the grounds that industrial action by steelworkers at the integrated complexes could incapacitate the rolling mills and billet forges, and cause job losses. Sirs stated, in defiance of Scargill, that his members would continue to handle any fuel that presented itself."]}, {"page": "Iron and Steel Trades Confederation", "response": [":1975: Bill Sirs", ":1973: Bill Sirs"]}, {"page": "List of Question Time episodes", "response": ["| Ann Clwyd, James Goldsmith, Sally Oppenheim-Barnes, Bill Sirs"]}, {"page": "2015 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Bill Sirs, 95, trade unionist."]}, {"page": "Deaths in June 2015", "response": ["*Bill Sirs, 95, British trade unionist.William (Bill) Sirs: Obituary "]}, {"page": "General Council of the Trades Union Congress", "response": ["| Bill Sirs", "|rowspan=2| Bill Sirs"]}, {"page": "Sirs", "response": ["* Bill Sirs (1920\u20132015), British trade unionist"]}]}}
