Both the comic strip and its main character took adopted the name of the paper. Rooum recalled the creation of Wildcat's characters in an interview:There had to be some kind of female, and thinking about that, I decided to make the wildcat female, then I thought about the contrast between the anarchists that I knew. Some of them were, like Colin Ward, very anxious for anarchism to become intellectually respectable. Some were just the opposite and wanted to go around throwing things. I thought the cat could be the wild anarchist, and the free-range egghead could be the intellectual. So that's how it started.After Wildcat's closure, Sansom persuaded Rooum to revive the Wildcat comic strip in the anarchist newspaper Freedom where it featured until the publication ceased printing in 2014.", "* Philip Sansom (anarchist and conscientious objector)"]}]}}
