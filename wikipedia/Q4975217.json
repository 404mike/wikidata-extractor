She was born in Lempster, New Hampshire to a \"poor but respectable\" family.  In order to earn a living, she became \"an itinerant painter and show woman,\" traveling from her home in 1807 to Northampton, Massachusetts and Hartford, Connecticut on the way to New York City.

It was at this point that the emphasis moved from her as a person needing charity to her talent as an artist, and she stopped using Sally and became known as Sarah Rogers. She also made a second visit to the gallery, when people were able to commission works from her.  After New York City, she traveled to Philadelphia, where, in 1811, the Society of Artists in the United States, formed the previous year by Charles Willson Peale and other painters, had their first exhibition. Entry #340 was \"Landscape, painted by holding the brush in the mouth, Miss Sarah Rogers.\"  Two years later, the exhibition catalog listed two works by Sarah Rogers, \u201cSt. Scholastic (drawing or water color)\u201d and \u201cMount Sidney, seat of John Barker, Esq., painted without the use of her hands (water color).\u201d William Hamilton, whose estate The Woodlands was in West Philadelphia, purchased and donated to Peale's Philadelphia Museum, a drawing of flowers by Rogers.
