Queen Elizabeth, however, preferring gold, changed the color of the dragon supporter from red to gold gules, in parallel to her change of the royal mantle from gules and ermine to gold and ermine.

The suggestion is discredited by an examination, in England, of the records of the High Court of Chivalry and, in Scotland, by a judgment of the Court of Session (per Lord Mackay in Maclean of Ardgour v. Maclean [1941] SC 613 at 650).  The significance of a right to a coat of arms was that it was definitive proof of the status of gentleman, but it recognised rather than conferred such a status, and the status could be and frequently was accepted without a right to a coat of arms."]}, {"page": "Tenn\u00e9", "response": ["While tenn\u00e9 is frequently mentioned in books about heraldry, it is not among the basic heraldic colours and its appearance in practice is quite rare. Arthur Charles Fox-Davies, in his Complete Guide to Heraldry, asserted that both tenn\u00e9 and murrey were probably inventions of the theoretical (though never shown in actual practice) system of abatements, further commenting that he knew of only one instance of tenn\u00e9 to date (as of 1909), and that was in an estate livery rather than coat armory. The Oxford Guide to Heraldry cites a late-14th century English treatise as stating that in addition to the two metals and five colours, a colour called tawny was \"borne only in the Empire and France,\" the Oxford Guide also citing Gerard Leigh's The Accendance of Armory (1562) as rejecting tenn\u00e9 or tawny as non-existent and sanguine or murrey as mistaken purpure."]}, {"page": "Arsenal", "response": ["An arsenal is a place where arms and ammunition are made, maintained and repaired, stored, or issued, in any combination, whether privately or publicly owned.

When displayed in war or battle, this banner signalled that the sovereign was present in person.. Because the royal banner depicted the royal arms of England, its design and composition changed throughout the Middle Ages. It is variously known as the royal banner of England, the banner of the royal arms, the banner of the king of England, or by the misnomer of the royal standard of England; Arthur Charles Fox-Davies explains that it is \"a misnomer to term the banner of the royal arms the Royal Standard\", because \"the term standard properly refers to the long tapering flag used in battle, by which an overlord mustered his retainers in battle\". The archaeologist and antiquarian Charles Boutell also makes this distinction. This royal banner differs from England's national flag, St George's Cross, in that it does not represent any particular area or land, but rather symbolises the sovereignty vested in the rulers thereof."]}, {"page": "Carrick bend", "response": ["The Carrick bend is known as the \"Wake knot\" or \"Ormonde knot\" when it is used as a heraldic badge.Arthur Charles Fox-Davies, A Complete Guide to Heraldry (1909), p.\u00a0469."]}, {"page": "Hippocampus (mythology)", "response": ["The mythic hippocampus has been used as a heraldic charge, particularly since the Renaissance, most often in the armorial bearings of people and places with maritime associations.  However, in a blazon, the terms hippocamp and hippocampus now refer to the real animal called a seahorse, and the terms seahorse and sea-horse refer to the mythological creature.  The above-mentioned fish hybrids are seen less frequently. In appearance, the heraldic sea-horse is depicted as having the head and neck of a horse, the tail of a fish and webbed paws replacing its front hooves. Its mane may be that of a horse or it may be replaced with an additional fin. Sea-horses may be depicted with wings, but this motif does not appear to be present within any officially sanctioned arms.Arthur Charles Fox-Davies. A Complete Guide to Heraldry, T.C. and E.C.
