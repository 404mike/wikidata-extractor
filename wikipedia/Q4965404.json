In an essay published in College English in 2001, Martine Dutheil states that The Coral Island can be thought of as epitomising a move away from \"the confidence and optimism of the early Victorian proponents of British imperialism\" toward \"self-consciousness and anxiety about colonial domination\". She locates this anxiety in what she calls the \"rhetoric of excess\" that features in the descriptions of cannibalism, and especially in the accounts of Fijian savagery provided by Bloody Bill (most notably that of the sacrifice of children to the eel gods) and the missionary, a representative of the London Missionary Society, an \"emblematic figure of colonial fiction\". Others have also linked popular boys' fiction of the period with imperialism; Joseph Bristow's Empire Boys (1991) claimed to see an imperialist manhood,' which shaped British attitudes towards empire and masculinity.\" The novel's portrayal of Pacific culture and the effects of colonisation are analyzed in studies such as Brian Street's The Savage in Literature: Representations of 'Primitive' Society in English Fiction (1975) and Rod Edmond's Representing the South Pacific: Colonial Discourse from Cook to Gauguin (1998). The domination imposed by \"geographical mapping of a territory and policing of its native inhabitants\" is an important theme in the novel both specifically and in general, in the topography of the island as mapped by the boys and the South Pacific's \"eventual subjugation and conversion to Christianity\", a topic continued in Stevenson's Treasure Island."]}, {"page": "List of people from Brighton and Hove", "response": ["* Brian Street, anthropologist; lived in Brighton, died in Hove"]}, {"page": "History of Islamic economics", "response": ["The early Islamic Empire also had the highest literacy rates among pre-modern societies, alongside the city of classical Athens in the 4th century BC,. \"Reaching further back through the centuries, the civilizations regarded as having the highest literacy rates of their ages were parent-driven educational marketplaces. The ability to read and write was far more widely enjoyed in the early medieval Islamic empire and fourth-century-B.C.E. Athens than in any other cultures of their times.\" and later, China after the introduction of printing from the 10th century.. \"The spread of written knowledge was at least the equal of what it was in China after printing became common there in the tenth century. (Chinese books were printed in small editions of a hundred or so copies.)\" One factor for the relatively high literacy rates in the early Islamic Empire was its parent-driven educational marketplace, as the state did not systematically subsidize educational services until the introduction of state funding under Nizam al-Mulk in the 11th century.. \"In neither case did the state supply or even systematically subsidize educational services. The Muslim world's eventual introduction of state funding under Nizam al-Mulk in the eleventh century was quickly followed by partisan religious squabbling over education and the gradual fall of Islam from its place of cultural and scientific preeminence.\" Another factor was the diffusion of paper from China,. \"According to legend, paper came to the Islamic world as a result of the capture of Chinese papermakers at the 751 C.E. Battle of Talas River.\" which led to an efflorescence of books and written culture in Islamic society, thus papermaking technology transformed Islamic society (and later, the rest of Afro-Eurasia) from an oral to scribal culture, comparable to the later shifts from scribal to typographic culture, and from typographic culture to the Internet.. \"Whatever the source, the diffusion of paper-making technology via the lands of Islam produced a shift from oral to scribal culture across the rest of Afroeurasia that was rivaled only by the move from scribal to typographic culture. (Perhaps it will prove to have been even more important than the recent move from typographic culture to the Internet.) The result was remarkable. As historian Jonathan Bloom informs us, paper encouraged \"an efflorescence of books and written culture incomparably more brilliant than was known anywhere in Europe until the invention of printing with movable type in the fifteenth century.\" Other factors include the widespread use of paper books in Islamic society (more so than any other previously existing society), the study and memorization of the Qur' an, flourishing commercial activity, and the emergence of the Maktab and Madrasah educational institutions.. \"More so than any previously existing society, Islamic society of the period 1000\u20131500 was profoundly a culture of books. [...] The emergence of a culture of books is closely tied to cultural dispositions toward literacy in Islamic societies. Muslim young men were encouraged to memorize the Qur'an as part of their transition to adulthood, and while most presumably did not (though little is known about literacy levels in pre-Mongol Muslim societies), others did. Types of literacy, in any event, varied, as Nelly Hanna has recently suggested, and are best studied as part of the complex social dynamics and contexts of individual Muslim societies. The need to conform commercial contracts and business arrangements to Islamic law provided a further impetus for literacy, especially likely in commercial centers. Scholars often engaged in commercial activity and craftsmen or tradesmen spent time studying in madrasas. The connection between what Brian Street has called \"maktab literacy\" and commercial literacy was real and exerted a steady pressure on individuals to upgrade their reading skills.\""]}]}}
