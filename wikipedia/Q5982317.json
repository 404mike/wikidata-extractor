A former editor of Contemporary Art magazine, and the founder-editor of The Journal of Geography and Urban Research, throughout the 1990s he was best known for his writings on the arts of Eastern Europe, being cited as the first British art critic to emphasize the negative impact of the western art market in that region. Throughout the 1990s and early-2000s, he was a contributor to a wide range of art journals, as well as writing on subjects relating to photography, cinema, and music. Since 2007 his publishing activities have mainly centred on UK Rural Affairs, and the environment however. Though periodically he continues to publish works of art criticism, his most recent publications concern social justice in rural Britain, as well as environmental conservation in the wider European sphere. He has also worked as an academic in several UK universities.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Christine Keeler", "response": ["Funded by the Arts Council England and Arts Council of Wales, a touring exhibition called Dear Christine opened in Newcastle upon Tyne in June 2019 and toured to Swansea in October 2019, finishing at Arthouse1 in London in February 2020.

Importantly however, the publication is noteworthy as it served to provide Cook with his first significant point of connection with the professional music business (his contact with Adam Ant being a notable example), and for both McKay and Thomas, their first experiences of publishing. Whilst Cook remained in the music business, McKay became a writer on the visual arts and culture, while Thomas moved into the business sector; he is currently the publisher of Communicate magazine and owner of Cravenhill Publishing."]}, {"page": "Music for Miners", "response": ["Music for Miners (MFM) was a collective of UK writers, artists and filmmakers (including several independent television producers associated with RPM Productions and Channel 4) who attempted to engage young people with politics during the UK Miner's Strike of 1984\u20131985.
