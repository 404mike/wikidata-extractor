One plan that surfaced was to set up a religious community in Littlemore, outside the city of Oxford.Chadwick, p. 178. Since accepting his post at St. Mary's, Newman had a chapel (dedicated to Sts. Nicholas and Mary) and school built in the parish's neglected area. Newman's mother had laid the foundation stone in 1835, based on a half-acre plot and \u00a3100 given by Oriel College.Gilley, p. 142. Newman planned to appoint Charles Pourtales Golightly, an Oriel man, as curate at Littlemore in 1836. However, Golightly had taken offence at one of Newman's sermons, and joined a group of aggressive anti-Catholics. Thus, Isaac Williams became Littlemore's curate instead, succeeded by John Rouse Bloxam from 1837 to 1840, during which the school opened.Curthoys, M.C., Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, \"Bloxam, John Rouse (1807\u20131891), antiquary\" William John Copeland acted as curate from 1840.Macnab, K.
