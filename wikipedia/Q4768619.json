Anne was revered for her roles in tragedies but was also known to play in breeches roles, wherein she would be playing a woman dressed as a boy. She had been nominated as possibly the \"first English actress,\" the  Desdemona in the performance of Othello on 8 December 1660. [See: Margaret Hughes; Katherine Corey.] Marshall certainly played Desdemona in later performances. She excelled in rhymed heroic tragedy, creating \u201cexcessively grandiose heroines which so delighted Restoration audiences.\u201dMarshall is thought to have played Zempoalla in the Dryden/Howard collaboration The Indian Queen in 1664. Reportedly, she did wonderfully but her voice was not as sweet as Mary Betteron's. She is known to have played the following roles with the King's Company:\n\nCelia in Jonson's Volpone\nthe Lady in Beaumont and Fletcher's The Scornful Lady\nEvadne in The Maid's Tragedy\nMargarita in Fletcher's Rule a Wife and Have a Wife\nEdith in Rollo Duke of Normandy\nCelia in The Humorous Lieutenant\nAlmeria in Dryden's The Indian Emperour\nMrs. Double-Diligence in Wilson's The Cheats\nCelestina in Sir William Killigrew's The Siege of Urbin.Anne Marshall married an actor named Peter Quin, or Gwyn, sometime after June 1665. Peter Quin was wanted by the police for acting without a warrant. She resumed her stage career as Mrs. Quin once the theatres re-opened after the plague epidemic and the Great Fire of 1665\u201366. When she returned in November 1666 she was treated as a newcomer. She quarreled with the management about her private dressing room with a chimney, which had been taken from her, and she got it back in May 1667. She played:\n\nCandiope in Dryden's The Maiden Queen\nAurelia in An Evening's Love\nAlizia Pearce in Boyle's The Black Prince.Marshall retired from the stage in 1668; but she resumed her career nine years later, this time with the rival Duke's Company under Thomas Betterton. With that troupe, her first role was Angelica Bianca in Aphra Behn's The Rover in March 1677. (Coincidentally, Marshall had been cast in the same role in the abortive all-female production of Thomas Killigrew's Thomaso in 1664.) She also played:\n\nLady Knowell in Behn's Sir Patient Fancy\nLady Squeamish in Otway's Friendship in Fashion\nQueen Elizabeth in Banks's The Unhappy Favourite\nSunamira in Southerne's The Loyal Brother\u2014 and other parts.Anne Marshall had a younger sister, Rebecca Marshall, who joined her sister in the King's Company a few years after and was also a noted actress. Their father, Stephen Marshall, was a clergyman, the chaplain of Lord Gerard. Samuel Pepys mentions both Marshalls frequently in his Diary. The sisters played together at least once, in The Maiden Queen.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "December 8", "response": ["*1660 \u2013 A woman (either Margaret Hughes or Anne Marshall) appears on an English public stage for the first time, in the role of Desdemona in a production of Shakespeare's play Othello."]}, {"page": "1660", "response": ["* December 8 \u2013 The first English actress appears on the professional stage in England in a non-singing r\u00f4le, as Desdemona in Othello, following reopening of the theatres (variously considered to be Margaret Hughes, Anne Marshall or Katherine Corey)."]}, {"page": "1660 in literature", "response": ["*December 8 \u2013 The first English actress to appear on the professional stage in England in a non-singing r\u00f4le, as Desdemona in Othello, is variously considered to be Margaret Hughes, Anne Marshall or Katherine Corey."]}, {"page": "The Rover (play)", "response": ["\u00a4 In the original 1677 production, Anne Marshall played Angellica Bianca and Elizabeth Barry was Hellena."]}, {"page": "An Evening's Love", "response": ["The original production featured Charles Hart as Wildblood, Michael Mohun as Bellamy, Nell Gwyn as Jacinta, Nicholas Burt as Don Lopez, William Wintershall as Don Alonzo, Robert Shatterell as Maskal, Edward Lydall as  Don Melchor de Guzman, Elizabeth Boutell as Donna Theodosia, Anne Marshall as Aurelia, and Mary Knep as Beatrix.Van Lennep 138"]}, {"page": "Margaret Hughes", "response": ["At the age of 30, Hughes made theatre history by becoming the first woman known to perform on an English stage. Her first performance was on 8 December 1660, when she played the role of Desdemona in Shakespeare's play Othello, in a production by Thomas Killigrew's new King's Company at their Vere Street theatre.Halliday, Shakespeare Companion, p. 347. Some historians identify Anne Marshall as the first actress to step onto the English stage.Howe, p. 24.; Gilder, p. 166. However, there has been much analysis of the early recollections of John Downes, whose memories of the 1660s form a key part of Hughes' claim in this regard.See Highfill, Burnim and Langhans, p. 24, for an extended analysis of the various claims here."]}, {"page": "King's Company", "response": ["Killigrew quickly expanded his troupe to include the first actresses on the English public stage, starting in 1661.

In his Diary, Samuel Pepys recorded seeing it on 27 November 1660 and on 4 January 1661, both times with male actors in the title role, as was standard up to that time. Then Thomas Killigrew staged the play with women in the female parts; Pepys saw that production on 12 February 1661. Pepys saw the play again on 27 December 1666, 16 September 1667, and 3 June 1668. Charles Hart and Edward Kynaston were among the actors of the day who played in it.Arthur Colby Sprague, Beaumont and Fletcher on the Restoration Stage, Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press, 1926; pp. 42\u20133. The Scornful Lady remained in the repertory until the middle of the 18th century.Sprague, p. 124. Some early actresses acquired reputations for their work in the play; Anne Marshall was noted for her portrayal of the title character in the 1660s, while in the next century Mrs. Macklin, the wife of Charles Macklin, was a popular success as the servant Abigail."]}, {"page": "Thomaso", "response": ["Thomaso was never performed in the seventeenth century, and certainly not since; many critics regard it as unactable, and place it securely in the category of closet drama. Yet Killigrew once attempted to mount a production \u2013 and an extraordinary one. In October 1664, Killigrew's King's Company gave an unprecedented all-female-cast production of his Parson's Wedding. At the same time, Killigrew prepared a similar all-women staging of Thomaso.Elizabeth Howe, The First English Actresses: Woman and Drama, 1660\u20131700, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1992; p. 58.
