Curran was an attacking midfielder, who could also play as a winger, and as an out and out striker. During his 13-year career Curran played for many clubs, although he is especially remembered by Sheffield Wednesday supporters for his part in launching the clubs revival during the late 1970s and early 1980s.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jack Charlton", "response": ["His priority in summer 1978 was to find a target man for Tommy Tynan to play alongside and he found it in  Andrew McCulloch, who arrived from Brentford for a \u00a370,000 fee. He signed Terry Curran as a winger but eventually moved him up front to play alongside McCulloch. He sold goalkeeper Chris Turner to Sunderland and replaced him with the bigger Bob Bolder. He further raised the average height of the team by signing uncompromising centre-half Mick Pickering from Southampton. The team failed to advance in the league, finishing the 1978\u201379 season again in 14th spot. They did make their mark on the FA Cup in the Third Round by taking eventual winners Arsenal to four replays before they eventually succumbed to a 2\u20130 defeat."]}, {"page": "Singing the Blues", "response": ["Birmingham City-supporting radio presenters Tom Ross and Ian Danter released a version to celebrate the club's promotion to the Premier League.  It has been sung since at least the 1969 season by fans of the Midlands club.  Blackburn Rovers fans have been known to sing a version of the song: \"Never felt more like singing the blues, the Rovers win and Burnley lose, oh Rovers, you've got me singing the blues.\"  Everton fans sing a version of this song; \"I've never felt more like singing the blues, when Everton win and Liverpool lose, oh Everton you've got me singing the blues.\"  Also this song is commonly used at Manchester City football matches, where the fans sing: \"Never felt more like singing the blues, City win, United lose.\"  This song has also been used by Sheffield Wednesday fans. Their lyrics are:  \"Never felt more like singing the blues, When Wednesday win, United lose.\"  Former Wednesday player Terry Curran recorded a version of the song that is still used at Hillsborough to this day. Ipswich Town fans also use the song and the club recorded their own version of it, with the chorus being \"I've never felt more like singing the Blues, When Ipswich win and Norwich lose, Oh Ipswich you've got me singing the blues\"."]}, {"page": "Steel City derby", "response": ["The Boxing Day Massacre, was a match played on 26 December 1979. It was famous for being the biggest win in recent times for Wednesday, winning 4\u20130, with goals from Ian Mellor, Terry Curran, Mark Smith and Jeff King. The United side at the time were top of the league, while Wednesday were 4th in the table. The victory for Wednesday propelled them onto promotion and is widely believed to have shaped the next 20 years fortunes for Wednesday while United languished in the 3rd division before being relegated to the 4th division, which is the only time one of the Sheffield clubs has been in the bottom tier of the football league. The match was watched by a record Third Division crowd of 49,309 spectators and is still celebrated by Owls fans today.", "* Terry Curran"]}, {"page": "1979\u201380 in English football", "response": ["*Terry Curran (Sheffield Wednesday) \u2013 22 goals"]}, {"page": "List of Sheffield Wednesday F.C. seasons", "response": ["|Terry Curran"]}]}}
