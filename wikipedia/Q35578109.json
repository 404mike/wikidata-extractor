He started in the first two league matches before suffering a knee injury that kept him out for a month. Odoi returned from injury, coming on as a late substitute, in a 1\u20131 draw against West Bromwich Albion on 14 September 2019. Since returning from injury, he regained his first team place, playing in the right\u2013back position for three months despite competing with Steven Sessegnon and Cyrus Christie. This last until Odoi was sent\u2013off for a straight red card in the 28th minute, in a 3\u20131 loss against Preston North End on 10 December 2019. After serving a three match suspension, he returned to the first team, coming on as a 67th-minute substitute, in a 1\u20130 win against Stoke City on 29 December 2019. Odoi then helped the club keep three consecutive clean sheets between 11 January 2020 and 22 January 2020 against Hull City, Middlesbrough and Charlton Athletic. He did once again by helping Fulham keep two sheets in two matches between 26 February 2020 and 29 February 2020 against Swansea City and Preston North End. Odoi continued as a first-team regular, and by the time the season was suspended because of the COVID-19 pandemic, he had made 26 league appearances."]}, {"page": "Coombe Boys' School", "response": ["* Steven Sessegnon, footballer for Fulham FC"]}, {"page": "List of Fulham F.C. players (1\u201324 appearances)", "response": ["Since the club's first competitive match, 966 players have made an appearance in a competitive match, of which 500 have played only a handful of matches (including substitute appearances); all players who have made fewer than 25 appearances for the club are listed below.
