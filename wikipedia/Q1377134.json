By then, the band had moved into a house, 10 Alma Street, Kentish Town, near a pub called the Tally Ho. The band were used to playing in American bars, but in common with most London pubs at the time, the Tally Ho had a jazz-only policy. They persuaded the landlord that they played jazz, although their music was predominantly country rock and blues, and first appeared on either 3 May, or 13 May 1971, with Steel on drums. They soon attracted large crowds - including other musicians, such as Graham Parker, Nick Lowe and Elvis Costello - making Eggs the pioneers of the \"pub rock\" movement. Eventually, they were asked to increase their performances, until they were playing three nights and Sunday lunchtime each week.
