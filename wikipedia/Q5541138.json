The signing of fellow Welsh international John Charles had raised hopes of improvement but the side struggled throughout the season, winning just 14 league matches out of 42. Allchurch finished as the club's top league scorer, scoring 12 times including a hat-trick against Sunderland in September 1963. The club's struggles saw George Swindin dismissed as manager and replaced by Jimmy Scoular, who had captained Newcastle during Allchurch's spell in the North-East. Allchurch found Scoular's loud and vocal form of management difficult and in mid-October 1964, found himself dropped from the side after recovering from a brief thigh injury as Scoular favoured playing Peter King in his place. He did not return to the first team until February, during which time he stated his desire to leave the club, when Scoular was forced to recall him after the Bluebirds had suffered a severe decline during his absence. Scoular had introduced a new youth policy within the squad, handing regular places to players such as King, George Johnston and Don Murray. Murray later commented that he regarded it as a privilege to play alongside Allchurch and Charles and stated \"There was a saying among the players, if you are in trouble give it to Ivor\"."]}, {"page": "George Johnston", "response": ["George Johnston may refer to:", "*George Johnston (burgess) (1720\u20131766), American lawyer and politician", "*George Johnston (British Marines officer) (1764\u20131823), Lieutenant-Governor of New South Wales", "*George Johnston (naturalist) (1797\u20131855), Scottish naturalist and physician", "*George Johnston (engineer) (1855\u20131945), Scottish engineer and motorcar designer", "*George Johnston (general) (1868\u20131949), Australian army general and politician", "*George Johnston (politician) (1884\u20131977), Canadian politician", "*George Johnston (novelist) (1912\u20131970), Australian journalist and novelist", "*George Johnston (ice hockey) (1920\u20132006), National Hockey League player", "*George Johnston (footballer, born 1947), Scottish footballer", "*George Johnston (footballer, born 1998), footballer for Bolton Wanderers", "*George Johnston (Australian footballer) (1877\u20131945), Australian rules footballer for Carlton", "*George Johnstone (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "Johnston (surname)", "response": ["* George Johnston (burgess) (1700\u20131766), American lawyer and politician", "* George Johnston (British Marines officer) (1764\u20131823), leader of the Rum rebellion, briefly Lieutenant-Governor of New South Wales", "* George Johnston (naturalist) (1797\u20141855), Scottish surgeon and naturalist", "* George Johnston (novelist), Australian journalist and novelist", "* George Johnston (politician), Canadian politician", "* George Johnston (general), Australian Major General in World War 1, member of the Fitzroy City Council from 1896 to 1900", "* George Johnston (engineer), designer of Scotland's first motorcar and co-founder of Arrol-Johnston Car Company Ltd.", "* George Johnston (ice hockey), former National Hockey League player", "* George Johnston (footballer, born 1947), former Scottish footballer for Cardiff City, Arsenal, Fulham and others"]}, {"page": "South Wales derby", "response": ["Brayley Reynolds has scored more goals in competitive South Wales derbies than any other player.
