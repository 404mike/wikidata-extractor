She took leading roles at Theatre Royal, Drury Lane\nHer success was rapid, participating in the rivalry for popular favor in Romeo and Juliet in 1750, playing with Garrick at Drury Lane, while Barry and Mrs. Cibber played at Covent Garden. She was thought the more charming of the Juliets. Mrs. Bellamy was popular and she was received in the best society. She forfeited her reputation by her liaisons.Her last appearance was at Drury Lane on 24 May 1785 in her own benefit concert. She was unable to act, but spoke a short address to the audience.
