He kept his place in the starting line-up for the majority of the campaign, although he spent some time on the sidelines when Ambrose Harris enjoyed a run in the team mid-season. Mitchell played a total of 34 competitive matches for Nelson before leaving to join Bristol Rovers in the summer of 1927. However, he did not make a senior appearance during his only season with Bristol, and moved into non-league football for the 1928\u201329 season.

He did not make the team as regularly in a higher league, and was often second choice left-half behind new signing Leigh Collins. Broadhead found his first-team opportunities highly limited during the 1924\u201325 season. On 21 April 1925, he played his first match in almost a year when he was selected for the 2\u20131 home win over Southport.Dykes, p. 78 He played in the first six games of the following campaign, but was then replaced by Ernie Braidwood and later by Ambrose Harris.

The two most senior squad members, David Wilson and goalkeeper Joseph Birds, retired from professional football aged 40 and 36 respectively.
