Formed in October 1939 as a duplicate of the 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division, the 46th Division comprised the 137th, 138th and 139th Infantry Brigades, along with supporting divisional troops. The division, minus its divisional troops, had fought in France with the BEF, sustaining extremely heavy casualties due to its poor level of training, and after being evacuated, was then serving in Scotland under Scottish Command, reorganising after its heavy losses. Soon after Hudson became GOC, in early January 1941 the 46th Division moved to Cambridgeshire, then Norfolk, where it came under the command of Lieutenant-General Edmund Osborne's II Corps, serving under Eastern Command and, like it had in Scotland, focused on reorganising and training to repel a German invasion, although then considered unlikely in winter.Hudson, p. 184 Hudson only held the command for just over five months, until May 1941, after a dispute with Osborne, his senior officer, which resulted in his demotion to the substantive rank of colonel, and he never again held a divisional command, nor regained his rank of major-general. Osborne, who, possibly envious of Hudson being the holder of a VC, interfered with Hudson's command, writing to his battalion and brigade commanders without Hudson knowing, organising exercises, and visiting the division without informing its GOC.Hudson, pps. 184-185 Hudson wrote an official letter of complaint. Osborne arrived, apologised and promised that he would no longer interfere, and went away on two weeks' leave. However, when he returned Hudson received an official report that he was, in his corps commander's opinion, unfit to command a division.Hudson, pps. 185-186 Hudson, following Osborne's own advice, appealed, unsuccessfully, and he lost command of the division.Hudson, p. 187 He was succeeded as GOC of the 46th Division by Major-General Douglas Wimberley, a fellow student at the Staff College in the mid-1920s, who was sympathetic to Hudson's plight. Hudson wrote that \"There are few blows in life which are more shattering than wounded pride. I felt personally shamed and disgraced. I had worn the insignia of a general long enough to become known to relatives, friends and acquaintances as such, and now I had to tell them that I had dropped to a rank lower than that I held before the war\"."]}, {"page": "General Anderson", "response": ["*Sir Desmond Anderson (1885\u20131967), British Army lieutenant general"]}, {"page": "45th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)", "response": ["!scope=\"row\" | Major-General Desmond Anderson"]}, {"page": "Persia and Iraq Command", "response": ["** III Corps - Lieutenant-General Sir Desmond Anderson"]}, {"page": "Horatio Berney-Ficklin", "response": ["The division spent most of the rest of 1940 reforming, reequipping and retraining, absorbing large numbers of reinforcements, mostly recently called-up conscripts, to replace the heavy losses suffered in Norway and France. The division was moved to Western Command in North West England in late October. The division was serving under III Corps, then commanded by Lieutenant General James Marshall-Cornwall until he was replaced by Desmond Anderson the following month, and trained throughout the winter in numerous exercises. Remaining there until March 1941, the division was then sent to Northern Ireland, again coming under Desmond Anderson's III Corps, to help prevent a possible German invasion of the country via Southern Ireland.

Arriving there in late September 1942, the division formed part of III Corps, still under Desmond Anderson, itself part of the Tenth Army, commanded by General Sir Edward Quinan, itself part of Paiforce (formerly Iraqforce) under the newly created Persia and Iraq Command. In early October the division concentrated in Kermanshah before moving to Qum for the winter, where training continued, although it was made difficult by the severe weather. However, the German defeat at Stalingrad in February 1943 removed the threat of invasion and the division was available for service elsewhere. Travelling and training in both amphibious landings and mountain warfare in the Lebanon, Egypt and Syria, the division became part of Lieutenant General Miles Dempsey's XIII Corps, itself part of the British Eighth Army, under General Sir Bernard Montgomery. Berney-Ficklin, promoted on 5 May 1943 to permanent major general (with seniority backdated to 17 November 1941), knew Dempsey well, as the latter had commanded the 13th Brigade while the former commanded the 15th Brigade in France."]}, {"page": "Index of World War II articles (D)", "response": ["# Desmond Anderson"]}, {"page": "British Army during the Second World War", "response": ["The Tenth Army was formed in Iraq and from the major part of Paiforce after the Anglo-Iraqi War.
