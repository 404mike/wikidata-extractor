He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for the Whitehaven constituency in Cumberland from 1959 until he stood down at the 1970 general election for health reasons. He was an organiser of the Jarrow March and the first signatory of the petition handed to Parliament.One of 21 children, Symonds served with The Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) in India, reaching the rank of Sergeant Major. He married Mary Lavinia Harrison with whom he had 13 children. From 1946 onwards the family lived at Hedworth View in a three-bedroomed council house.\nAs well his elected status, Symonds held many other offices during his lifetime, including Councillor and Mayor of Jarrow, and Chair of the National Housing Committee. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1957 New Year Honours for services to the disabled and was a strong influence in the building of the Tyne Tunnel crossing in preference to a bridge, the construction of which would have required the demolition of many good quality council houses.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jarrow March", "response": ["Shortly after the return home in November 1936 Riley, together with three other Jarrow councillors who had led the march\u2014James Hanlon, Paddy Scullion and Joseph Symonds\u2014left Labour to form a breakaway group committed to a more direct fight for employment.

A reviewer for The Economic Journal found the book \"not quite as polemical as one might have expected\", but felt that in her denunciation of the BISF Wilkinson had not taken full account of the state of the iron and steel industry in the 1930s.  Wilkinson continued her parliamentary career, and from 1940 to 1945 held junior ministerial office in Churchill's wartime coalition government.Vernon, pp. 184\u201385 In the 1945 Labour government she was appointed Minister of Education, with a seat in the cabinet, a post in which she served until her death, aged 55, in February 1947."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1959 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Joseph Symonds"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1964 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Joseph Symonds"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1966 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Joseph Symonds"]}, {"page": "Symonds", "response": ["*Joseph Symonds (1900\u20131985), British politician, MP for Whitehaven"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1950\u20131979)", "response": ["|Joseph Symonds"]}, {"page": "Whitehaven (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Joseph Symonds"]}, {"page": "Joseph Bede Symonds", "response": ["#REDIRECT Joseph Symonds"]}, {"page": "Symonds, Joseph", "response": ["#redirectJoseph Symonds"]}]}}
