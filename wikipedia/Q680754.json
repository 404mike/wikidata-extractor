The journey involved traversing the Punjab which had descended into a state of near anarchy following the death of Ranjit Singh and the convoy was frequently at risk from marauding soldiers and bandits. On reaching Kabul, part of the escort was formed into a company of sappers and miners, which, under the command of Broadfoot, marched with Sir Robert Sale's force from Kabul to Jalalabad in October 1841. Broadfoot was specially mentioned in the dispatches for his gallantry in the actions with the Afghans between Kabul and Gandamak. At Jalalabad Broadfoot became garrison engineer, and by his skill and vigour speedily restored the defences of the town, which had been found in a ruinous condition. Having no men from the Sappers and Miners available, he used Gurkha troops as an ad hoc engineer workforce. During the siege of Jalalabad by the Afghans, Broadfoot (now a captain), aided by his friend Henry Havelock, then a Captain of foot, was instrumental in preventing a capitulation, which at one time had been resolved on by Sir Robert Sale and a majority of the principal officers of the force. In one of the sorties made by the beleaguered garrison Broadfoot was severely wounded. He subsequently accompanied General Pollock's army of retribution to Kabul, again distinguishing himself in the actions which were fought at Mammu Kh\u00e9l, Jagdallak, and Tez\u00edn. At the close of the war he was created a Companion of the Order of the Bath, and was appointed Commissioner of Moulmein.
