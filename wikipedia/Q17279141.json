After gaining a First in Classics at King's College, Cambridge, he was for some years programmer at London's Electric Cinema in Notting Hill, and later became the editor and chief critic of the film section of Time Out magazine.\nAndrew is a regular contributor to Sight & Sound and has contributed essays and articles to many books and journals. He is the author of a number of books on the cinema, including BFI Modern Classics books on Abbas Kiarostami (10) and Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski\u2019s Three Colours Trilogy; The Films of Nicholas Ray, Stranger Than Paradise: Maverick Film-makers in Recent American Cinema, The Film Handbook and Film Directors A-Z \u2013 The Art of the World\u2019s Greatest Film-makers.

In 2009, the French government made him a Chevalier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres for his contribution to French cinema.\nAndrew participated in the 2012 Sight & Sound critics' poll, where he listed his ten favorite films as follows: L'Atalante, Citizen Kane, The General, His Girl Friday, La Morte Rouge, My Night with Maud, Ordet, Persona, Ten, and Tokyo Story.He writes on film, music and others arts at GeoffAndrew.com.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Marilyn Monroe", "response": ["Monroe and Miller separated after filming wrapped, and she obtained a Mexican divorce in January 1961.

Its reviews were mixed, with Variety complaining of frequently \"choppy\" character development, and Bosley Crowther calling Monroe \"completely blank and unfathomable\" and stating that \"unfortunately for the film's structure, everything turns upon her\". It has received more favorable reviews in the twenty-first century. Geoff Andrew of the British Film Institute has called it a classic, Huston scholar Tony Tracy has described Monroe's performance the \"most mature interpretation of her career\", and Geoffrey McNab of The Independent has praised her for being \"extraordinary\" in portraying the character's \"power of empathy\"."]}, {"page": "The Rocky Horror Picture Show", "response": ["Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a rating of 78% based on 45 reviews, and an average grade of 6.9/10, with the critical consensus reading \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show brings its quirky characters in tight, but it's the narrative thrust that really drives audiences insane and keeps 'em doing the time warp again\". A number of contemporary critics find it compelling and enjoyable because of its offbeat and bizarre qualities; the BBC summarised: \"for those willing to experiment with something a little bit different, a little bit outr\u00e9, The Rocky Horror Picture Show has a lot to offer.\" The New York Times called it a \"low-budget freak show/cult classic/cultural institution\" with \"catchy\" songs. Geoff Andrew, of Time Out, noted that the \"string of hummable songs gives it momentum, Gray's admirably straight-faced narrator holds it together, and a run on black lingerie takes care of almost everything else\", rating it 4 out of 5 stars. On the other hand, Dave Kehr of the Chicago Reader considered the wit to be \"too weak to sustain a film\" and thought that the \"songs all sound the same\"."]}, {"page": "Cary Grant", "response": ["The following year Grant was considered for the Academy Award for Best Actor for Penny Serenade\u2014his first nomination from the Academy. Wansell claims that Grant found the film to be an emotional experience, because he and wife-to-be Barbara Hutton had started to discuss having their own children. Later that year he appeared in the romantic psychological thriller Suspicion, the first of Grant's four collaborations with director Alfred Hitchcock. Grant did not warm to co-star Joan Fontaine, finding her to be temperamental and unprofessional. Film critic Bosley Crowther of The New York Times considered that Grant was \"provokingly irresponsible, boyishly gay and also oddly mysterious, as the role properly demands\". Hitchcock later stated that he thought the ending of the film in which Grant is sent to jail instead of committing suicide \"a complete mistake because of making that story with Cary Grant. Unless you have a cynical ending it makes the story too simple\". Geoff Andrew of Time Out believes Suspicion served as \"a supreme example of Grant's ability to be simultaneously charming and sinister\"."]}, {"page": "Richard Burton", "response": ["Burton next featured as Jimmy Porter, \"an angry young man\" role, in the film version of John Osborne's play Look Back in Anger (1959), a gritty drama about middle-class life in the British Midlands, directed by Tony Richardson, again with Claire Bloom as co-star. Biographer Bragg observed that Look Back in Anger \"had defined a generation, provided a watershed in Britain's view of itself and brought [Osborne] into the public prints as a controversial, dangerous figure\". Burton was able to identify himself with Porter, finding it \"fascinating to find a man who came presumably from my sort of class, who actually could talk the way I would like to talk\". The film, and Burton's performance, received mixed reviews upon release.  Biographer Alpert noted that though reviews in the UK were favourable, those in the United States were more negative. Crowther wrote of Burton: \"His tirades are eloquent but tiring, his breast beatings are dramatic but dull and his occasional lapses into sadness are pathetic but endurable.\" Geoff Andrew of Time Out magazine felt Burton was too old for the part, and the Variety reviewer thought \"the role gives him little opportunity for variety\". Contemporary reviews of the film have been better and it has a rating of 89% on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes. Look Back in Anger is now considered one of the defining films of the British New Wave cinema, a movement from the late 1950s to the late 1960s in which working-class characters became the focus of the film and conflict of social classes a central theme. Jimmy Porter is also considered one of Burton's best on-screen roles; he was nominated in the Best Actor categories at the BAFTA and Golden Globe Awards but lost to Peter Sellers for I'm All Right Jack (1959) and Anthony Franciosa for Career (1959) respectively. Though it didn't do well commercially, Burton was proud of the effort and wrote to Philip, \"I promise you that there isn't a shred of self-pity in my performance. I am for the first time ever looking forward to seeing a film in which I play.\" While filming Look Back in Anger, Burton did another play for BBC Radio, participating in two versions, one in Welsh and another in English, of Welsh poet Saunders Lewis' Brad, which was about the 20 July plot. Burton voiced one of the conspirators, Caesar von Hofacker."]}, {"page": "Stranger Than Paradise", "response": ["Stranger Than Paradise has been released on DVD by The Criterion Collection as its 400th title.

He also pointed out that his films are as notable for their \"considerable technical virtuosity and visual flair\" as for their \"brilliant narrative ingenuity and their unusually adult interest in complex philosophical questions\". David Bordwell observed that Nolan is \"considered one of the most accomplished living filmmakers\", citing his ability to turn genre movies into both art and event films, as well as his box office numbers, critical acclaim, and popularity among cinemagoers. In 2008, film critic Philip French deemed Nolan \"the first major talent to emerge this [21st] century\". Film critic Mark Kermode complimented the director for bringing \"the discipline and ethics of art-house independent moviemaking\" to Hollywood blockbusters, calling him \"living proof that you don't have to appeal to the lowest common denominator to be profitable\". The Observer described Nolan as a \"skilful, stylish storyteller, capable of combining the spectacle of Spielberg with the intellectual intricacy of Nicolas Roeg or Alain Resnais\". Mark Cousins applauded the director for embracing big ideas, \"Hollywood filmmakers generally shy away from ideas\u2014but not Christopher Nolan\". Scott Foundas of Variety declared Nolan \"the premier big-canvas storyteller of his generation\", while Justin Chang of the Los Angeles Times called him \"the great proceduralist of 21st century blockbuster filmmaking, a lover of nuts-and-bolts minutiae.\""]}, {"page": "L'Avventura", "response": ["L'Avventura influenced the visual language of cinema, changing how subsequent films looked, and has been named by some critics as one of the best made.

Roger Ebert wrote that he came to like the film later in life when he began to admire the \"clarity and passion Antonioni brought to the film's silent cry of despair.\" Geoff Andrew of Time Out criticized the film, writing that \"If it once seemed the ultimate in arty, intellectually chic movie-making, the film now looks all too studied and remote a portrait of emotional sterility.\" Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune defended the film against Andrew's criticism, writing that \"It's easy to bash Antonioni as passe.
