Classically trained, he became a professional rock musician at the age of 17 and initially had his first \"mainstream\" experience with singer-songwriter Gilbert O'Sullivan. He subsequently played guitar and keyboard for the hard rock band UFO, blues rock guitarist Gary Moore, and Wild Horses. He is credited for co-writing a number of Gary Moore's songs including the worldwide hit \"Empty Rooms\". At 30 he left the rock world and  developed a different career as both teacher of woodwind (saxophone and clarinet) and as an ABRSM examiner. 2010 saw an unexpected return to rock with Gary Moore, playing festivals across Europe and a tour of Ukraine and Russia. Future tours and a Celtic rock album were to follow but this was curtailed by the death of Gary Moore in February 2011. \nOn 30 April 2019, it was announced that he would return to UFO for their 'Last Orders' tour, following the death of Paul Raymond with Neil replacing Paul. The tour began in June 2019 in Germany with concerts and festival appearances. It is expected that following the USA dates in autumn 2019 there will be some concerts in 2020 as a continuation of the bands\u2019 final 50th anniversary tour.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "UFO (band)", "response": ["UFO are  an English rock band that was formed in London in 1968. They became a transitional group between early hard rock and heavy metal and the new wave of British heavy metal. The band's current lineup includes vocalist Phil Mogg, lead guitarist Vinnie Moore, rhythm guitarist and keyboardist Neil Carter, bass guitarist Rob De Luca, and drummer Andy Parker. They have gone through several line-up changes, leaving Mogg as the only constant member, and had two breaks (1983\u20131984 and again from 1989 to 1991). The band are also notable for featuring former Scorpions guitarist and MSG founder Michael Schenker, who was a member of UFO from 1973 to 1978 and had rejoined the band sporadically between 1993 and 2003, when Moore replaced him. In May 2018, Mogg announced that he would retire from UFO after one last tour as a member of the band in 2019; however, the band plans to resume their farewell tour in 2022.", "After Schenker's exit, UFO rehired Paul Chapman on guitar, who brought over unused track ideas from Lone Star's drummer Dixie Lee. Shortly afterward they released their next LP, No Place to Run, in January 1980. Produced by former Beatles producer George Martin, No Place To Run failed to match up to the success of its predecessors, though it fractionally missed the UK Top 10. Paul Raymond left the band at the end of the No Place To Run tour, and was replaced by John Sloman from Uriah Heep on keyboards for a couple of months and then by former Wild Horses guitarist and keyboardist Neil Carter, who helped fill the void in the songwriting left by Schenker's departure. Carter debuted with UFO on stage at the three-day Reading Festival on 23 August 1980, when the band played as the Saturday night headline act. At the beginning of the following year, UFO released the self-produced The Wild, the Willing and the Innocent, which had a lighter pop rock sound, which was popular at the time. The album achieved mild success in the UK, reaching the UK Top 20, and the single \"Lonely Heart\" was released.", "Longtime keyboardist and guitarist Paul Raymond died from a heart attack on 13 April 2019 at the age of 73. Two weeks later, it was announced that Raymond's initial replacement Neil Carter would be rejoining UFO for the remainder of the band's final tour. Former guitarist Paul Chapman died on his 66th birthday on 9 June 2020. Chapman was followed two months later by original bassist Pete Way, who died from accident injuries at the age of 69.", "*Neil Carter \u2013 keyboards, rhythm guitar (1980\u20131983, 2019\u2013present)"]}, {"page": "Gary Moore", "response": ["After moving to London and signing a new recording contract with Virgin, Moore released his second solo album Corridors of Power in 1982. While not a major success, it was the first album to feature Moore on lead vocals throughout, as well as his first solo release to crack the Billboard 200 chart. Musically Corridors of Power featured \"more of a rock feel\", with additional influences from AOR bands, such as Journey and REO Speedwagon. The album also featured former Deep Purple drummer Ian Paice, Whitesnake bassist Neil Murray, and keyboardist Tommy Eyre, who had previously played with Moore in Greg Lake's backing band. During the supporting tour for Corridors of Power, singer John Sloman was also hired to share lead vocal duties with Moore, while Eyre was replaced by Don Airey. In 1983, Moore released the album Victims of the Future, which marked another musical change, this time towards hard rock and heavy metal. The album also saw the addition of keyboardist Neil Carter, who would continue to push Moore in this new musical direction. For the supporting tour, they were joined by former Rainbow bassist Craig Gruber and drummer Bobby Chouinard, who were later replaced by Ozzy Osbourne bassist Bob Daisley and former Roxy Music drummer Paul Thompson, respectively."]}, {"page": "Run for Cover (Gary Moore album)", "response": ["*Neil Carter \u2013 keyboards on tracks 5, 7, 8, 10-13, backing vocals on tracks 1, 4, 7, 8, 10-13"]}, {"page": "Victims of the Future", "response": ["Victims of the Future is the fourth solo studio album by Northern Irish guitarist Gary Moore, released in 1983.
