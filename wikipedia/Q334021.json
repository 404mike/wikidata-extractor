Collaborators on the SGA projects also included Michael Artin (\u00e9tale cohomology) and Nick Katz (monodromy theory and Lefschetz pencils). Jean Giraud worked out torsor theory extensions of nonabelian cohomology. Many others like David Mumford, Robin Hartshorne, Barry Mazur and C.P. Ramanujam were also involved.", "Grothendieck is considered by many to be the greatest mathematician of the 20th century. In an obituary David Mumford and John Tate wrote:", "Although mathematics became more and more abstract and general throughout the 20th century, it was Alexander Grothendieck who was the greatest master of this trend. His unique skill was to eliminate all unnecessary hypotheses and burrow into an area so deeply that its inner patterns on the most abstract level revealed themselves\u2013and then, like a magician, show how the solution of old problems fell out in straightforward ways now that their real nature had been revealed.Alexander Grothendieck obituary by David Mumford and John Tate David Mumford at Brown and Harvard Universities: Archive for Reprints: Can one explain schemes to biologists, 14 December 2014", "* Can one explain schemes to biologists \u2014biographical sketch of Grothendieck by David Mumford & John Tate"]}, {"page": "Brown University", "response": ["Notable past and present faculty include biologists Anne Fausto-Sterling (Ph.D. 1970) and Kenneth R.
