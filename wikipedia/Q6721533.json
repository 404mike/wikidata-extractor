The ground floor is rusticated, the end bays have pilasters, and there is an entablature with a frieze, a cornice and a parapet.  In the centre is a tetrastyle portico of fluted Doric columns with four paterae on the frieze.  There are three doorways with moulded architraves, and the windows are sashes."]}, {"page": "Chorlton-on-Medlock Town Hall", "response": ["The building was remodelled in the early 1970s, with the fa\u00e7ade retained but the interior of the building demolished to create a new refectory for the School of Art, which by that time had become part of the new Manchester Polytechnic. The Mabel Tylecote Building, named after the Labour politician, Dame Mabel Tylecote, was built on an adjacent site to the northeast and was completed in 1973. Manchester Metropolitan University, which evolved from Manchester Polytechnic after a rebranding in 1992, decided to redevelop the site with a proposed new arts and humanities building in 2018. The construction work, which was carried out by Morgan Sindall to a design by Allies and Morrison, involved the demolition of both the 1970s building behind the town hall fa\u00e7ade and the Mabel Tylecote Building: the work, which also included the restoration and cleaning of the town hall fa\u00e7ade, was completed and the complex re-opened in December 2020. The project was highly commended in North West Project of the Year category for Constructing Excellence in 2020."]}]}}
