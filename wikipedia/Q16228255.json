The sport of cricket in this period had already acquired most of its modern features such as eleven-a-side, the three-stump wicket and the lbw law, although pitch preparation was rudimentary and play was largely dictated by the weather. The main difference was in bowling which was still mostly underarm, the key development of the period being the movement towards roundarm bowling which began in the late eighteenth century and was gathering pace by 1825.\nThe principal club throughout the period was Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) which was founded in 1787. MCC organised the early Gentlemen v Players matches and most of the games played by occasional XIs such as those led by Colonel Lennox, Lord Frederick Beauclerk, George Osbaldeston and others. Inter-county cricket was rare during the Napoleonic Wars and there were no formally constituted county clubs at the time, but the main centres at county level were Berkshire, Essex, Hampshire, Kent, Middlesex, Surrey and Sussex. Towards the end of the period, Cambridge University became prominent, especially through its series of matches against the Cambridge Town Club. In the north of England, cricket was developing through town clubs which became the focal points of the game in their respective counties, especially Nottingham Cricket Club and Sheffield Cricket Club.\nThe players included are those known to have played in matches which were given retrospective first-class status between 1787 and 1825 inclusive.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gillan", "response": ["Gillan may refer to:", "* Gillan, Cornwall, England", "* Gillan, the former Turkish name for Gjilan (Serbian: Gnjilane)", "* Gillan (1809 cricketer), English cricketer", "* Audrey Gillan, journalist", "* Cheryl Gillan (1952\u20132021), Welsh politician", "* Chester Gillan (born 1943), Canadian politician", "* Felix Gillan (1903\u20131986), Scottish footballer", "* Ian Gillan (born 1945), English musician", "* James Angus Gillan (1885\u20131981), Scottish rower and colonial service official", "* James Gillan (actor) (born 1975), British actor", "* Jamie Gillan (born 1997), American football player", "* Jeff Gillan (born 1957), American journalist", "* Karen Gillan (born 1987), Scottish actress", "* Kim Gillan (born 1951), Montana politician", "* Robert Gillan (died 1879), minister of the Church of Scotland", "* Gillan (band), A rock band headed by Deep Purple frontman Ian Gillan in the late seventies and early eighties, selling ten million albums in Europe", "** Gillan (album), their debut album"]}]}}
