He played as an inside right.Kirkwood was born in Dalserf, South Lanarkshire. He turned professional with Airdrieonians in 1923, and in August of the following year moved to Rangers. Unable to dislodge Scotland international Andy Cunningham from the starting eleven, Kirkwood spent a season on loan at St Johnstone, and played only once for Rangers in the Scottish League, in a 2\u20131 defeat of Partick Thistle on 28 August 1926.In November of that year, he joined Sheffield Wednesday, where he made 18 appearances in as many months before moving on to Brighton & Hove Albion at the end of the 1927\u201328 season for a \u00a3500 fee. Described as slow but constructive, Kirkwood scored 74 goals from 168 League appearances for the club and was their top scorer in the 1928\u201329 season with 21 goals in all competitions. His career was affected by injury, and he was allowed to leave on a free transfer in October 1933, spending a few weeks with Luton Town before finishing the season and his professional career with Swindon Town. Kirkwood returned to Scotland where he worked as a miner. He died in Stonehouse, South Lanarkshire in 1977 at the age of 76.His elder brother Andrew Kirkwood was also a footballer who was contracted to Rangers and was loaned to St Johnstone at the same time as Dan where the siblings played together; Andrew also featured for Hamilton Academical.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hugh Vallance", "response": ["Vallance was born in Wolverhampton and after serving in the army as a guardsman began his football career with Kidderminster Harriers. He moved to Aston Villa in 1927, but left to join Queens Park Rangers without having broken into the first team. He made just one appearance for Rangers before moving to Brighton & Hove Albion in the spring of 1929. He was given his chance by Brighton manager Charlie Webb and soon established himself in the Brighton attack alongside Dan Kirkwood. In the 1929\u201330 season, Vallance scored four hat-tricks before the end of the year. By the end of the season, Vallance had scored 30 league goals in 37 games, while his strike partner Kirkwood had netted 38 in 40. The following season, Vallance scored twice in the first seven games before his Brighton contract was terminated for a \"serious misdemeanour\" at the same time as that of Ireland international Jack Curran."]}, {"page": "Daniel Kirkwood (footballer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Dan Kirkwood"]}, {"page": "Charlie Webb", "response": ["He earned a reputation as a sound judge of a player. Immediately after the war, the signing of former England international forward George Holley for a club record \u00a3200 fee was viewed as quite a coup. Holley suffered a career-ending injury, so hardly played, but Webb replaced him with Jack Doran who finished as the club's top scorer despite joining halfway through the season.Carder & Harris, Seagulls!, pp. 68\u201370. He brought Tommy Cook through from the juniors into the first team; Cook was top scorer in three seasons, but when he left the club to concentrate on his cricket career, Webb brought in the Queens Park Rangers reserve Hugh Vallance, who turned out to be a \"goalscoring phenomenon\" alongside Dan Kirkwood.Carder & Harris, Seagulls!, p. 91. Again, when twice top scorer Arthur Attwood succumbed to appendicitis in 1933, Webb signed former Norwich City centre-forward Oliver \"Buster\" Brown who had failed to break into the first team at West Ham United; with regular football at Albion, Brown produced 41 goals in his first two seasons.Carder & Harris, Seagulls!, p. 102."]}, {"page": "Kirkwood (surname)", "response": ["*Dan Kirkwood (1900-1977), Scottish athlete in football"]}]}}
