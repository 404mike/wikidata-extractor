He transferred to Championship club Watford in 2010 and captained the team to promotion to the Premier League in the 2014\u201315 season.

After a 4\u20131 loss to West Ham on the last league game of the season, Watford confirmed their highest ever points tally and finish in English Premier League football of 50 points and 11th place respectively, although they did finish 2nd with 71 points in the 1982\u201383 season of the English Football League."]}, {"page": "Leicester City F.C.", "response": ["Leicester were viewed as one of the favourites for promotion in the 2011\u201312 season, but on 24 October 2011, following an inconsistent start with the Foxes winning just 5 out of their first 13 matches, Eriksson left the club by mutual consent.

He will usually occupy two defenders, thus making the defence more vulnerable. Combined with two fast wingers, this tactic may give the 4-man defence potential problems. The team may also benefit from a target man at set pieces. The target man, can use give/go tactics described earlier, can attempt to \"knock down\" high passes to teammates or can simply try to outpower and outmuscle opposition defenders to create scoring opportunities for himself.
