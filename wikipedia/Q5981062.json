Back at Sun Hill, Superintendent John Heaton alerted DCI Meadows to events when a police director in Germany told them a German woman staying in a London hotel, Helen Wegner, had reported her daughter Charlotte Fischer missing. When Jack arrived to the hotel with DCs Mickey Webb and Kezia Walker, they met Leipzig based officers Hajo Trautzschke and Ina Zimmermann, who had flown in at Helen's request alongside her husband Karl. When CCTV showed Terry near the abduction, Jack arranged a raid on Thompson & Ray, where Alan Brady was arrested. However, Charlotte had already been taken by company boss Jimmy Thompson (Ian Burfield) to Piccadilly Circus. SO19 caught Thompson fleeing as both Terry and Ina went after Charlotte; Thompson's contact Nick Carson intervened in the pursuit before taking Terry and Charlotte away at gunpoint with the man who organised the kidnapping. When Terry came to, the ringleader identified himself as Victor Hauptmann. As he briefed Terry on his operation, Terry swiped Carson's phone to tell the Sun Hill team about Hauptmann and where he was located. When Hajo learned a new player was entering the gang that Hauptmann had never met, he arranged for the man's place to be taken by his officer, Jan Maybach. As Terry met Jan at the airport, he left a note for Mickey stating where he was staying. When Hauptmann, Carson, Terry and Jan headed for an airfield to fly to Leipzig, a raid occurred on Hauptmann's hideout, and a video feed alerted him to the fact he had a traitor in his ranks.", "|Jimmy Thompson || Ian Burfield || 1"]}, {"page": "List of American films of 2009", "response": ["| The International || Columbia Pictures / Relativity Media / Atlas Entertainment || Tom Tykwer (director); Eric Warren Singer (screenplay); Clive Owen, Naomi Watts, Armin Mueller-Stahl, Ulrich Thomsen, Br\u00edan F.
