She was one of the three women who have won the Open Championship, winning in 1905.\nShe had won her very first public tournament at Budleigh Salterton, in 1898  and won the Ladies Championship for the next three years. In 1901, she started entering tournaments with men and in that year she won the Open Gold Medal, with a controversy. In semi-final her opponent (a man) accused her of \"spooning\". This sparkled heated discussions as to whether this was a gentlemanly way to do. \nDuring her peak she was also three times Open Gold Medalist (contestants being both men and women) and even Men's Gold Medalist. The latter case was a result of confusion in rules: after \"Open\" and \"Women's\" were renamed into \"Men's\" and \"Women's\", the inadequately modified rules contained a loophole which allowed women to enter the \"Men's Gold\" contest.In 1906 she married Reginald CJ Beaton, who was also a leading croquet player.\nAs an administrator she served on the Council of the Croquet Association between 1939 and 1954.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Croquet", "response": ["Unlike most sports, men and women compete and are ranked together.

She was a member of the Garden Vale Tennis and Croquet Club in Athlone, winning the South of Ireland croquet championship in 1901 and 1902. In 1903, she lost the semi-final croquet championship of Ireland to the winner, Mrs Edith Preston. She went on to play in the 1903 English ladies\u2019 open championship in Wimbledon, defeating Preston in the final. She won the English ladies\u2019 open championship again in 1905, and also won the mixed doubles with Cyril Corbally. She won the 1905 Irish gold medals for croquet and the gold caskets. She defeated Lily Gower in 1904, at the time Gower was considered to be the best croquet player, male or female. She tied with Gower in seventh place in the 1905 champions\u2019 cup, playing against both men and women. In 1906 and 1907, she ranked ninth in the cup competition. Following in Gower's footsteps, Coote won the 1908 men's gold medal. This led to the rules being changed to forbid women from entering that competition. When the ladies\u2019 champion cup held its inaugural competition in 1911, Coote came third."]}]}}
