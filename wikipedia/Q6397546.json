With Pearson performing poorly, Darren Hughes was signed from Brighton & Hove Albion for a \u00a310,000 fee. Paul Smith was also offloaded to Lincoln City for \u00a340,000.

Alex Williams was also forced to retire with a back injury, leading to the return of a fit again Mark Grew in goal. More injuries came as Chris Banks had his nose broken after a reserve match at Barnsley when he was attacked by a gang of youths whilst waiting at a fish and chip shop.

In November Kevin Steggles was signed from West Bromwich Albion for 'a small fee' to replace the still-injured Webb. More signings were made with former England international Peter Barnes arriving on loan from Manchester City, and 'hard-working' Simon Mills purchased from York City for \u00a335,000.", "On the financial side, the cup run and sale of Jones had raised a record profit of \u00a3410,239.
