However, the review did not examine specific doctorates, and therefore did not look at the awarding of Wilyman's PhD. Upon completion, the university's report found that their higher degree research policies and procedures were consistent with those at other comparable Australian universities. Immunology academic John Dwyer noted that even though the university's review made some \"excellent recommendations for improving the postgraduate research students' experience\", it \"failed to address the vital question of matching the scientific question to be examined to the expertise of the supervisor and the ultimate reviewers\".", "Wilyman wrote an open letter to Paul Wellings, the Vice Chancellor of the University of Wollongong asking the university to correct alleged inaccuracies in the Wikipedia article about her research, asserting that criticism of her thesis in the media and by individual scientists was not \"a proper scientific debate (but) suppression of the literature using political strategies\". She also criticised Alison Jones, a Wollongong academic, for using the university's website to publicise \"personal opinions of vaccination\". The university responded by saying that they do not endorse or otherwise the views of students or academic staff, and do not curate Wikipedia."]}, {"page": "Patricia M.
