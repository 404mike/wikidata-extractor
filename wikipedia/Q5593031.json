In a review of Lord's book, Hugh Massingberd from The Spectator stated photographic evidence did show a strong physical resemblance between Niven and Comyn-Platt that \"would appear to confirm these theories, though photographs can often be misleading.\" Niven is said to have revealed that he knew Comyn-Platt was his real father a year before his own death in 1983.", "A Thanksgiving service for Niven was held at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, on 27 October 1983.

He gave as an exception Martin Benson, who said Lowe did not have a lot of vocal skill in his rep days, \"and I don't think he had afterwards either...A lot of his success came from this oddball personality that he had and the fact that later in his career he had some very good writers.\" ", "Two biographies of Arthur Lowe have been published: Arthur Lowe\u00a0\u2013 Dad's Memory by his son Stephen, in 1997; and Arthur Lowe by Graham Lord in 2002.
