She founded her firm in a converted cobbler\u2019s shop in Halton, Leeds, in 1982. An attack by three masked men outside her office on 3 December 2003 led to the closure of her offices in Leeds, followed by a reopening in Harrogate, North Yorkshire. The success of this office inspired Stowe to open branches across the country, and she eventually grew the firm into the UK\u2019s largest family law specialist.  In February 2017 she sold her firm and blog for a \u2018substantial\u2019 eight figure sum to private equity investors Living Bridge. Her first clients were legally aided.
