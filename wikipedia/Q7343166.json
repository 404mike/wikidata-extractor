The 6-inch (15\u00a0cm) Cooke refractor was donated by William McEwan and installed in the dome on the Playfair Building. Additional domes were built for a 13-inch (33\u00a0cm) reflector donated by Robert Cox and for a 13-inch (33\u00a0cm) refractor transferred from the Dunecht observatory near Aberdeen. Only remnants of these two domes remain today. The City Dome was built to house a 22-inch (56\u00a0cm) refractor. This did not perform very well and was dismantled in 1926. The dome remained and was used as a lecture theatre."]}, {"page": "Old College, University of Edinburgh", "response": ["The South Bridge Act 1785 was passed in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom on 21 April 1785 and in 1789 taxes were raised to fund a new University building in Edinburgh to a plan prepared by Robert Adam, to replace an existing collection of dilapidated buildings of the University. The foundation stone was laid in November of that year for what was proposed as a building with a \"First Court\", giving access to professor's lodgings, followed by a Great Court, around which the main academic halls and lecture rooms would be arranged. By the end of 1791 several apartments were in use, but in the following year the death of Robert Adam and the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars and the imposition of income tax slowed, then halted progress. In 1815 further funds were raised, and work recommenced. Plans were submitted by nine architects showing their proposals to continue the design work, with the outcome that William Henry Playfair was appointed architect in 1817. Playfair's design clove close to Adam's but combined the two courts into a single large quadrangle. By 1827 the building was virtually complete with the exception of fitting out the library, and construction of a dome which Adam had proposed at the east end of the building. This was left out as a cost saving, and the work was completed about four years later. The dome was added in 1887, to a design by Sir Robert Rowand Anderson, and funded by a donation from Gorgie industrialist and politician, Robert Cox. The gilded statue of Youth which crowns the dome is by John Hutchison.Buildings of Scotland: Edinburgh by Gifford McWiliam and Walker"]}, {"page": "Robert Cox", "response": ["Robert Cox may refer to:", "* Robert Cox (Canadian politician) (1850\u20131934), former merchant and politician in Prince Edward Island, Canada", "* Robert Cox (Scottish politician) (1845\u20131899), Scottish politician, Member of Parliament for Edinburgh South, 1895\u20131899", "*Robert Cox (Michigan politician), member of the Michigan House of Representatives", "* Robert Cox (actor) (died 1655), English actor", "* Robert Cox (anti-Sabbatarian) (1810\u20131872), Scottish lawyer, known as a writer on the Christian Sabbath, and phrenologist", "* Robert Cox (journalist) (born 1933), British journalist, editor of the Buenos Aires Herald", "* Doc Cox (Robert Cox, born 1946), British musician and former television journalist", "* Robert Cox Cup, trophy awarded annually by the United States Golf Association for the United States Women's Amateur Golf Championship", "* Robert Cox Clifton (1810\u20131861), English churchman, Canon of Manchester"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1895 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Robert Cox", "*20 June: Edinburgh South - Arthur Dewar, Liberal, replacing Robert Cox"]}, {"page": "St Cuthbert's Church, Edinburgh", "response": ["The organ of St Cuthbert's was donated in 1899 by Robert Cox and built by Robert Hope-Jones of Birkenhead.
