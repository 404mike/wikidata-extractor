During his Ministry of Defence (MoD) career he occupied a wide range of analytical and management positions in the DIS and elsewhere, including three tours in the Cabinet Office, culminating as Secretary to the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC).\nMorrison ended his official career as the senior civilian intelligence professional in the Defence Intelligence Staff, serving four years as Deputy Chief of Defence Intelligence and Head of the Defence Intelligence Analysis Staff. During this period he represented the MoD and DIS as a member of the JIC, UK representative to the NATO Intelligence Board and Head of Profession for MoD Intelligence Analyst classes. He was awarded the US Defence Intelligence Agency's Director's Award in 1999.\nOn leaving the DIS and the civil service in 1999, Morrison was selected by the parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) to be its first Investigator. He held this position until 2004, when his contract was prematurely terminated by the committee after he appeared on the UK BBC television programme Panorama and maintaining that Saddam Hussein was not in fact a threat to the UK. Morrison is a joint author of The Open Side of Secrecy: Britain's Intelligence and Security Committee, the first in-depth study of the ISC.\nSince his retirement, Morrison has appeared on a number of TV and radio programmes, including Panorama, Today, The Politics Show, Newsnight, and Conspiracy Files (on the death of Dr David Kelly).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Morrison", "response": ["John Morrison or Morison may refer to:", "* John Morrison (Manitoba politician) (1868\u20131930), politician in Manitoba, Canada", "* John Morrison (Saskatchewan politician) (1872\u20131950), Canadian Member of Parliament", "* John Morrison (intelligence officer) (born 1943), British intelligence officer", "* John Morrison (Montana politician) (born 1961), politician in Montana, USA", "* John Morrison (blacksmith) (1726\u20131816), farmer, blacksmith and politician in Nova Scotia", "* John Morrison, 1st Baron Margadale (1906\u20131996), British Conservative Party politician", "* John Morrison, 2nd Viscount Dunrossil (1926\u20132000), British diplomat", "* John Morrison (Australian footballer) (born 1947), former Australian rules footballer", "* John Morrison (basketball) (born 1945), American professional basketball player and college head coach", "* John Morrison (chess player) (1889\u20131975), Canadian chess player", "* John Morrison (cricketer) (born 1947), New Zealand cricketer and Wellington City Councillor", "* John Morrison (footballer, born 1889) (1889\u20131972), Scottish footballer (Falkirk) and manager (Third Lanark, St Mirren)", "* John Morrison (footballer, born 1909) (1909\u20131992), Scottish footballer (Celtic)", "* John Morrison (ice hockey, born 1895) (1895\u20131956), ice hockey player", "* John Morrison (ice hockey, born 1945), ice hockey player", "* John Morrison (wrestler) (born 1979), ring name for professional wrestler, John Hennigan", "* John Morrison (writer) (1904\u20131998), Australian novelist and short story writer", "* John Morrison (drummer), Australian jazz drummer", "* John Morrison (priest) (born 1938), Archdeacon of Oxford ", "* John Morrison (songwriter), 19th-century Tyneside songwriter", "* John Morrison, puppeteer for Dustin the Turkey"]}, {"page": "John Morrison (British Intelligence Official)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Morrison (intelligence officer)"]}]}}
