She was born Rachel Vitkopski in Kiev, Ukraine to Jewish parents - Simon and Freda (Grill) - who brought her to London, England when she was five years old.\nWitcop was a member of the anarchist Jubilee Street Club - her sister Milly (Witkop) was the partner of Rudolf Rocker - and it was there she met Guy Aldred. In January 1907 they set up home together in Thorpebank Road, Shepherd's Bush, London. Two years later, on 2 May 1909, she gave birth to their son, Annesley.\nShe worked alongside Guy Aldred and single-handedly ran The Spur during his imprisonment for resisting conscription during the First World War. From 1921 she concentrated her efforts on the issue of birth control and in 1923 she and Aldred were arrested and charged for publishing and distributing Margaret Sanger's Family Limitation. The case drew much press coverage and was supported both morally and financially at appeal by Dora Russell and John Maynard Keynes. Although losing the case, Rose re-published the text in 1925 and, while she avoided prosecution, attracted the attention of the Home Office who threatened to deport her as a Russian (i.e. Soviet) national. Despite having parted in 1924, Witcop and Aldred arranged a civil marriage in order to confirm her citizenship status and prevent any possible deportation.\nShe died on 4 July 1932 in St George's Hospital, London from gangrenous appendicitis and was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium two days later.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dora Russell", "response": ["Russell supported Rose Witcop and Guy Aldred and who were prosecuted for publishing Margaret Sanger's Family Limitation which was a guide to contraception.

As a result, it organised meetings in London later in the month, which were attended both by anti-parliamentarists such as the WSF and South Wales Socialist Society (SWSS), as well as by supporters of \"Revolutionary Parliamentarism\", including the SLP and British Socialist Party (BSP). Pankhurst wrote to Vladimir Lenin in July 1919, asking for his support for the party's opposition to standing in elections; but to her disappointment, he argued that renouncing parliamentary action would be a mistake. While not changing its views, the WSF accordingly deprioritised this policy in the hope of furthering the unity negotiations, a decision criticised by Rose Witcop of the Communist League."]}, {"page": "Guy Aldred", "response": ["Aldred worked closely with his partner Rose Witcop (9 April 1890 \u2013 4 July 1932), a pioneer of birth control and sister of Milly Witkop (who was, in turn, partner of anarchist Rudolf Rocker).Nicolas Walter, \u2018Witcop, Rose Lillian (1890\u20131932)\u2019, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/58610, accessed 4 Sept 2007"]}, {"page": "Anti-Parliamentary Communist Federation", "response": ["When Sylvia Pankhurst's Communist Party dissolved itself into the newly founded Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) in January 1921, many libertarian communists refused to join due to the CPGB's policy of parliamentarism.
