He was the drummer and percussionist in Flintlock and at the same time became an actor, notably in the cult TV series The Tomorrow People.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of drummers", "response": ["* Mike Holoway"]}, {"page": "The Tomorrow People", "response": ["By now, Price had become tired of his creation and attempted to end it by killing off the leads at the conclusion to Series 3, but Ruth Boswell made him rewrite it so that they survived. Thames Television had a ratings winner (as well as excellent overseas sales) and insisted he continue the programme, albeit in shorter, staggered seasons from now on. Price only ever allowed one attempt by another writer to work on it solo, with John E. Watkins penning the story \"Into the Unknown\" broadcast in early 1976. Price was not satisfied with the final episodes and decided from now on he would be sole writer. Having fewer episodes to write every year, Price would have more time to work on his comedic and light-entertainment productions, which he enjoyed more than the demanding sci-fi drama. At the start of the fourth series he attempted to give a boost to the format with the introduction of teenage idol Mike Holoway as Mike Bell. Holoway was the drummer with pop band Flintlock who were the regular house band on Price's You Must Be Joking, and Price hoped that his young charge would be Britain's answer to Donny Osmond or David Cassidy. Mike's arrival swells the ranks of TPs in the Lab to five (Tricia had remained on the Trig, due to Ann Courthoys' departure from the series) which made things look a bit overcrowded, this led to the decision to sack Vaughan-Clarke as Stephen, who ignobly disappears off screen after the season finished and is never even mentioned again. Mike was now very much being touted as the show's hero and with this change, it was noticeable that John and Elizabeth took on a more parental role as both actors entered their mid-20s. Tyso also vanished after the fourth year, but his character had been mostly redundant for some time due to not having been written into scripts that year. His late inclusion was only addressed a couple of weeks before filming started when Price discovered from Lawrence that he was still available to appear in the programme (he had been led to believe that he had moved abroad). This meant Tyso only had limited screen time and very few lines.  What scenes Tyso was in he was either the butt of a joke, or in a position where he was rarely pleased to be seen. Anne Curthoys was asked back to play Tricia, but was committed to a daytime soap at Thames.", "Vic Hughes took over as producer for Series 5, which began transmission in early 1977 and was the only series not to introduce a new Tomorrow person (although the first story does feature a potential TP in doomed Russian teenager, Pavla). All three adventures were two-parters which allowed Price to write them quickly and remove any unwanted excess padding which tended to slow down the action. Mike Holoway was now very much the star of the show as on screen, Mike developed into the resident hero guided by an increasingly parental John and Elizabeth. His band Flintlock even appeared in the closing adventure, \"The Heart of Sogguth\". From this season on, Price would only be credited as the writer but he retained overall control of the series and was very heavily involved in major decisions.", "* Mike Bell \u2013 (Mike Holoway) Mike is a working class Cockney who lives with his mother and sister. He is introduced at the start of season four when a group of London criminals try to force him to use his powers to help them commit crimes. Although loyal to the Tomorrow People, he is less willing than some of the others blindly to follow John's orders and they often clash. In later series, he occasionally takes on a leadership role when John and Elizabeth are absent, notably in \"War of the Empires\".", "In 2001, Big Finish Productions launched a series of new audio plays based on the original series, produced by Nigel Fairs. Nicholas Young and Philip Gilbert reprised their roles as John and TIM, with Helen Goldwyn and James Daniel Wilson appearing as Elena and Paul, the new Tomorrow People.
