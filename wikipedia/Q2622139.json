With the support of his father and the patronage of the Edinburgh Lord Provost George Drummond, Alexander Monro was appointed foundation Professor of Anatomy at the University of Edinburgh.

In 1721 Alexander Monro circulated a pamphlet setting out the case for this hospital.  Lord Provost George Drummond helped secure financial backing from local surgeons, physicians, wealthy citizens and Church of Scotland parishes. Monro and the committee of donors established this hospital in August 1729 in a house in Robertson's Close, rented from the university. This had six beds where the sick poor could be treated and provide clinical teaching for medical students. This 'Hospital for the Sick Poor' or  'Little House' as it was known was the origin of the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. In 1736 it received a Royal Charter from King George II, which conferred the 'Royal' designation. With the growth of the new medical school this soon became too small for purpose and a new teaching hospital was commissioned, designed by the leading architect William Adam. The original hospital moved in 1741 and the new hospital was finally completed in 1745.

The doctrine states that since the skull is incompressible, and the volume inside the skull is fixed then any increase in volume of one of the cranial constituents must be compensated by a decrease in volume of another.", " The Street directories for Edinburgh and Leith for the years 1773\u20131805 show that \u2018George Kelly\u2019 senior practised as a surgeon in Tolbooth Wynd, Leith, the only Kelly or Kellie listed in Leith for that period. In 1774 he published a paper describing a case of extensive surgical emphysema which, after consulting with Alexander Monro secundus, he had successfully treated by inserting of a cannula into the thoracic cavity.Kellie G., An Account of the Paracentesis Being Performed in the Thorax for the Cure of an Emphysema, Medical and Philosophical commentaries 1774;2:427-3 George Kelly senior died at Leith on 3 April 1805, the spelling of his name on the death notice reverting to 'Kellie'.", "In the paper which was to give Kellie lasting eponymous fame he describes the post mortem appearances in the bodies of two individuals found dead after lying outside after a storm.Kellie G. An account of the appearances observed in the dissection of two of three individuals presumed to have perished in the storm of the 3rd, and whose bodies were discovered in the vicinity of Leith on the morning of the 4th, November 1821 : with some reflections on the pathology of the brain. Transactions of the Medico-Chirurgical Society of Edinburgh 1824;1:82\u2013169 He was asked by local magistrates to try to establish the cause of death. Kellie noted that the veins in the meninges and surface of the brain were congested and the associated arteries were relatively bloodless while the brain was otherwise normal. In concluding that the individuals died from exposure he quotes a similar case described by Samuel Quelmalz (1696\u20131758) where exposure results in a progression through weariness, lassitude, drowsiness, coma and death which he ascribes to disordered cerebral circulation. He concluded 'When the cavity of the cranium is encroached upon by depression of its walls compensation may be made at the expense of circulatory fluid within the head; less blood is admitted and circulated'. Kellie gave credit to two of his Edinburgh contemporaries for their contributions in the shaping of this concept, Alexander Monro secundus (' \u2026 my illustrious preceptor in anatomy, the second Monro') and John Abercrombie. Monro had stated that since the healthy cranial cavity is rigid and of constant volume and the brain 'is nearly incompressible, the quantity of blood within the head must remain the same'.Monro A. Observations on the structure and functions of the nervous system: illustrated with tables. Edinburgh: Printed for, and sold by, William Creech 1783 Later in the paper Kellie described how Monro, aware of his interest, invited him jointly to examine the brains of executed criminals and sent him descriptions of autopsy findings in other similar cases. He gives Abercrombie particular credit when he writes  'the argument has already been taken up and illustrated by Dr Abercrombie, in his ingenious analysis of apoplexy \u2026 '. In 1818 Abercrombie indeed had \u2018proposed a doctrine\u2019 clearly setting out the hypothesis."]}]}}
