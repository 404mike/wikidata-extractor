He was the son of King Arvirargus and ruled following his father's death.\nAccording to Geoffrey, he ruled wisely in the time when the Picts first arrived in Britain.  A fleet of ships under the leadership of Sodric came from Scythia and landed in Albany.  Once there, they began to destroy the lands and Marius was forced to react.  Following numerous battles, Marius killed Sodric and set up a stone there to remember that triumph.  In addition, that land became known as Westmorland after him.  In respect for the people he defeated, he gave them a small portion of Albany called Caithness to live in.  Marius refused, however, to give them women to marry so the Picts fled to Ireland and took wives there.\nMarius established close ties with Rome and good diplomacy through tribute and respect of the Roman citizens in Britain.  He followed the laws of his ancestors and ruled justly.  When he died, he was succeeded by his son, Coilus.", "link_mentions": []}}
