Having fallen for Claudia, a distraught Cutter was forced to start again with her look alike while Connor gained a girlfriend, Caroline Steel (Naomi Bentley), a woman with a hidden agenda, whom Abby despised.

After Connor breaks up with Caroline by text message, she steals Rex for Leek. The team were also faced with a mysterious cleaner (Tim Faraday) whom they first encountered at a shopping mall and who worked against the team before he was killed in the Silurian by a Silurian Scorpion.
