The island is the one that originally housed a cottage.", "The first gardens on the site were begun by William Garrett who purchased the land in 1802. In 1817 the park was sold to John Julius Angerstein but in 1819 the sale was reversed after Angerstein brought a case against Garrett over non disclosure of dry rot. Garrett then put the estate back on the market. The park was purchased in 1820 by Regency politician and botanist Sir George Thomas Staunton as part of his country estate 'Leigh Park'. He made significant changes and additions to the gardens with the construction of the lake and a number of follies. On his death in 1859 the estate and gardens were inherited by Staunton's cousin Henry Cormick Lynch. Henry Lynch died just six weeks after receiving his inheritance and it was in turn passed to his eldest son George Staunton Lynch who then changed his name to George Staunton Lynch-Staunton. In 1861 he in turn sold the gardens and the estate to William Henry Stone for \u00a360,000. Stone had a new house built which was finished in 1865 and most of the old house was demolished around the same time.", "The temple was a memorial commissioned by George Staunton in 1824 with a large memorial urn at its centre. As initially completed the temple contained dedications to Staunton's parents and further dedications to more distant relations and friends. In the following years an eight busts were added in a semi circle around the urn. Most of the busts were of friends of Staunton who had died after 1820 but one was of the then still living William Howley. In 1840 Staunton decided to add no further memorials to the temple. Further busts were added after this time but they were primarily of people still living. The temple was removed when William Henry Stone had his new home constructed on its site.", "The moss house appears to have been built at some point in the first half of the 1830s and featured covered seat. The inside was lined with moss and the floor was made up of Emsworth pebbles of differing colours. It was removed in the 1860s as part of the building work undertaken by William Henry Stone."]}, {"page": "List of Old Harrovians", "response": ["*William Henry Stone (1834\u20131896), Liberal MP for Portsmouth (1865\u20131874)Harrow, 1800\u20131911, p. 216"]}, {"page": "Stone (surname)", "response": [":*William Henry Stone (1828\u20131901), U.S. representative from Missouri", ":*William Henry Stone (MP) (1834\u20131896), British politician, MP for Portsmouth, 1865\u20131874 ", ":*William Henry Stone (physician) (1830\u20131891), English physician, Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians"]}, {"page": "Portsmouth (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|rowspan=\"2\"| William Henry Stone"]}, {"page": "William Stone", "response": ["* William Henry Stone (1828\u20131901), U.S. representative from Missouri", "* William Henry Stone (physician) (1830\u20131891), English physician, Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians", "* William Henry Stone (MP) (1834\u20131896), British politician, MP for Portsmouth (1865\u20131874)"]}]}}
