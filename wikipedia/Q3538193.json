Many of his works have been made into popular films and television serials, including: Travers Vale's P\u00e8re Goriot (1915), Les Chouans (1947), Le P\u00e8re Goriot (1968 BBC mini-series), and La Cousine Bette (1974 BBC mini-series, starring Margaret Tyzack and Helen Mirren; 1998 film, starring Jessica Lange). Balzac is mentioned to humorous effect in Meredith Willson's musical The Music Man. He is included in Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut's 1959 film, The 400 Blows. Truffaut believed Balzac and Proust to be the greatest French writers.Truffaut, Fran\u00e7ois et al. Correspondence, 1945\u20131984.
