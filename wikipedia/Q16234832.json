Moore joined Dorchester Town in February 2013 due to Truro's continued financial difficulties, and he finished his first season in the Conference South with 20 goals. His goal-scoring record brought him to the attention of Yeovil Town for whom he signed in July 2013.\nAfter making more than fifty appearances for Yeovil, Moore was released and had a brief spell with Norwegian club Viking before returning to English football with Forest Green Rovers. Moore had a loan spell back at his hometown club Torquay United where he scored five goals in four games, grabbing the attention of Championship club Ipswich Town, signing for the club in January 2017. Before the beginning of the 2017\u201318 season, Moore signed on loan for Rotherham United for whom he scored 13 goals in 20 matches. His form saw him recalled by Ipswich in January 2018, and he subsequently joined fellow Championship club Barnsley for an undisclosed fee.\nBorn in England, Moore played once for their non-league select team in 2016 but was eligible for Wales and China through ancestral affiliations, before making his senior debut for Wales in 2019; he was selected subsequently for the Welsh UEFA Euro 2020 finals squad and scored on his first appearance at the tournament.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Steve Morison", "response": [" He was appointed as the lead coach of the Cardiff City under-23 team on 10 February 2020, joining up with Cardiff manager Neil Harris, who he played alongside and was managed by at Millwall. Following the sacking of Mick McCarthy in October 2021, Morison was place in temporary charge of the first-team. Morison's first match in temporary charge was a 3\u20133 draw away at Stoke City with his side having been 3\u20130 down with just 25 minutes remaining, this result ending Cardiff's club-record run of eight defeats in a row. Morison's third match in charge got Cardiff a first win in ten matches as a late winner from Kieffer Moore defeated Huddersfield Town. On 12 November, Morison was appointed First Team Manager on a deal until the end of the 2021\u201322 season with the owner stating that he had been impressed by the more attacking brand of football on display in Morison's three matches in charge."]}, {"page": "Severnside derby", "response": ["| Curtis NelsonKieffer Moore"]}, {"page": "List of Wigan Athletic F.C. seasons", "response": ["|align=left|Kieffer Moore"]}, {"page": "King Edward VI Community College", "response": ["* Kieffer Moore, footballer"]}]}}
