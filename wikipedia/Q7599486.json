He was educated at Highgate School. He was called up to the British Army during World War II, and served in the Royal Artillery and the Royal Indian Artillery. Having returned to England after five years military service, he studied history at Oriel College, Oxford, and then trained for the priesthood at Westcott House, Cambridge.\nBooth-Clibborn was ordained in the Church of England. He served two curacies in the Diocese of Sheffield in the first half of the 1950s. In 1956, he emigrated to Kenya where he worked for the Christian Council of Kenya, and then for a newspaper. In 1967, he returned to England and was Priest-in-Charge of a group of inner-city churches in Lincoln. Then, from 1970 to 1979, he was Vicar of the Church of St Mary the Great, Cambridge; Great St Mary's is the university church of the University of Cambridge.\nIn 1978, it was announced that Booth-Clibborn would be the next Bishop of Manchester, the diocesan bishop of the Diocese of Manchester in the north of England.

The ensuing restoration, by E. G. Thorne, included the complete renewal of even those parts of the building which had not been directly affected by the fire.  At the same time, changes in liturgical worship made it convenient to move the High Altar from the east end to a new bay in the Chancel, and remove the old chancel screen to the west end of the church, where it lent greater dignity to a new baptistery area, created in a more central location with a new marble font at its centre.  During the eighteen months during which the church was completely out of action, the congregation used the Church House for worship.  The church was rehallowed by Bishop Stanley Booth-Clibborn on 8 September 1986."]}, {"page": "Stanley (name)", "response": ["* Stanley Booth-Clibborn (1924\u20131996), British Anglican bishop"]}, {"page": "Section 28", "response": ["Lord McIntosh of Haringey took up the mantle of Simon Hughes' amendments in the Lords' second reading, furthered by the Bishop of Manchester, Stanley Booth-Clibborn:"]}, {"page": "Stanley Guy Francis Booth-Clibborn", "response": ["#REDIRECT Stanley Booth-Clibborn"]}, {"page": "List of Question Time episodes", "response": ["| Stanley Booth-Clibborn, Edward du Cann, Antonia Fraser, Shirley Williams"]}, {"page": "Movement for the Ordination of Women", "response": ["The Movement for the Ordination of Women (MOW) was an organisation which campaigned for the ordination of women as deacons and priests in the Church of England.
