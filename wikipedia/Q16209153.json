By 16 September 1943, a line had formed across Italy with everything to north held by the Germans and to the south by the Allies.Gerhard Weinberg, A World in Arms, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 601 Because of what Weinberg called the \"extraordinary incompetence\" of The Duke of Addis Abeba, who, like Victor Emmanuel, had not anticipated Operation Achse until it was far too late, thousands of Italian soldiers with no leadership were taken prisoner by the Germans without resisting in the Balkans, France and Italy itself, to be taken off to work as slave labour in factories in Germany, an experience that many did not survive. The way in which Victor Emmanuel mishandled the armistice was to become almost as controversial in Italy as his support for Fascism.Kogan, Norman A Political History of Postwar Italy, London: Pall Mall Press, 1966 p. 5 Under the terms of the armistice, the ACC had the ultimate power with the Royal Italian Government in the south, being in many ways an analogous position to the Italian Social Republic under the Germans. However, as the British historian James Holland noted, the crucial difference was that: \"In the south, Italy was now moving closer towards democracy\".Holland, James Italy's Year of Sorrow, 1944\u20131945, New York: St. Martin's Press, 2008 p. 250.
