He mostly plays as a wing, but he is also capable of playing at fullback and as a centre. Born in Stockport, England, he came through the Newport Gwent Dragons academy and made his professional debut for the region in October 2011 at the age of 17 years and 28 days, briefly making him the youngest player to appear for one of the four Welsh regional sides. After eight years with the Dragons, during which time he made 115 appearances, he moved to the Cardiff Blues in 2019.\nAmos also represented Wales in international rugby. After playing at under-16 level, he played for the under-20s in the 2013 Six Nations Under 20s Championship, before making his full international debut later that year, against Tonga in the 2013 Autumn internationals. He scored his first international try in Wales' opening game at the 2015 Rugby World Cup, a 54\u20139 win over Uruguay. He has since gone on to earn a total of 25 international caps, scoring six tries.\nIn October 2021, Amos announced his retirement from professional rugby union to focus on his medical career.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cardiff Rugby", "response": ["*  Hallam Amos"]}, {"page": "Dragons (rugby union)", "response": ["Several former players have been capped by the Wales national rugby union team while with the region; props Chris Anthony and Rhys M.

He was left out of the opening match, a 42\u20133 win over Samoa, before starting at full-back in the 26\u201321 win over Scotland four days later. He was named on the bench for the final pool match against Argentina, and came on for Hallam Amos in the 59th minute as Wales won 25\u201320 to top the group and qualify for the semi-finals. Williams again started at full-back in the semi-final against defending champions South Africa, and played a part in both of Wales' tries; for the first, a deft pass allowed captain Ellis Jenkins to crash over and give Wales an 11\u20137 lead. South Africa replied almost immediately, and had a six-point lead going into the final minute, when Williams broke four tackles to put Wales in good field position for Sam Davies to set up a try for wing Ashley Evans, which Davies then converted to give Wales an 18\u201317 win. Williams was again picked at full-back for the final against England on 23 June, but England won the match and the title. "]}]}}
