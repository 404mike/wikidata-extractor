Given the similarity in themes and the use of the phrase \"dawning of the day\" in both On Raglan Road and the traditional tune, it is quite likely that Kavanagh from the beginning imagined the pairing of verse and tune. Indeed, there is a broadcast recording of Kavanagh singing On Raglan Road to the tune on Irish television and in 1974 Benedict Kiely recalled in an interview for RT\u00c9 Kavanagh trying out the paired verse and tune for him soon after its writing.
