Extraordinary measures were taken to ensure that Johns did not escape again. He was sent to Fremantle Prison, and kept in the yard with his neck chained to the iron bar of a window, while a special \"escape-proof\" cell was made for him. The stone-walled cell was lined with jarrah sleepers and over one thousand nails, and was almost air-proof and light-proof. Johns was kept in the cell on a bread and water diet, with only one to two hours of exercise a day. In early 1867, due to his diminishing health, Johns was set to work breaking stone in the open air but, rather than permit him to leave the prison, the acting comptroller-general ordered that the stone be brought in and dumped in a corner of the prison yard, where Johns worked under the constant supervision of a warder. Governor John Hampton was so confident of the arrangements, he was heard to say to Johns: \"If you get out again, I'll forgive you\". However, the rock broken by Johns was not removed regularly, and eventually a pile grew up until it obscured the guard's view of him below the waist. Partially hidden behind the pile of rocks, he occasionally swung his sledgehammer at the limestone wall of the prison."]}, {"page": "Northampton, Western Australia", "response": ["Northampton is a town  north of Geraldton, in the Mid West region of Western Australia. At the 2011 census, the town had a population of 868. The town contains a National Trust building. The town lies on the North West Coastal Highway. Originally called The Mines, Northampton was gazetted in 1864 and named after the colony's Governor, John Hampton. The town was sited in the Nokanena Brook valley, between the hamlets around the two major copper mines in the area, the Wanerenooka and the Gwalla."]}, {"page": "Great Eastern Highway", "response": ["A road along what is now Great Eastern Highway has existed since the convict era of Western Australia. The original road is thought to have been constructed in 1867, using convict labour, with a road base made of jarrah tree trunks cut into disc shapes. The use of wooden discs as a road base had been proposed by Western Australian Governor John Hampton, leading them to be known as \"Hampton's Cheeses\". The discs were approximately  thick and as large as  in diameter, and the gaps between pieces would have been filled with soil or lime. The same type of road is known to have existed along Stirling Highway, Guildford Road, Albany Highway and Wanneroo Road in the 1860s, and would have prevented horses and carts from getting bogged in wet weather. Evidence of this original road was found in Belmont in 1948 when widening works uncovered jarrah discs. During upgrade works in 2012, more discs were discovered beneath the existing asphalt, over a  stretch."]}, {"page": "Frederick Barlee", "response": ["In 1862, Governor Kennedy was succeeded by Governor John Hampton, and Barlee returned to a position of influence.  In 1863, he became permanent chairman of the Board of Education.  The following year he gave Bishop Matthew Hale financial help in establishing the Bishop's Collegiate School (now Hale School), and was appointed first Governor of the school.  That year, he also invested in the unsuccessful attempt to establish a pastoral settlement at Roebuck Bay.  Eventually, Barlee again fell out of favour with the governor, this time through disagreements over the treatment of convicts, and the management of the convict system in general."]}, {"page": "Fremantle Prison", "response": ["Governor John Hampton was so confident of the arrangements, he was heard to say to Moondyne Joe: \"If you get out again, I'll forgive you\". However, the rock broken by Moondyne Joe was not removed regularly, and eventually a pile grew up until it obscured the guard's view of him below the waist. Partially hidden behind the pile of rocks, he occasionally swung his sledgehammer at the limestone wall of the prison. On 7 March 1867, Moondyne Joe escaped through a hole he had made in the prison wall. A few days before the second anniversary of his escape, Moondyne Joe was recaptured, returned to prison, and sentenced to an additional four years in irons. Eventually, Governor Frederick Weld heard of his predecessor Hampton's promise, and decided that further punishment would be unfair. Moondyne Joe was given a ticket of leave in May 1871."]}, {"page": "Maitland Brown", "response": ["Brown was appointed a Justice of the Peace later that year, and in 1866 was made Resident Magistrate at Greenough.  During his time in the position, he became involved in a protracted dispute with the Governor, John Hampton, and the Colonial Secretary Frederick Barlee.  Brown declined to obey an instruction to reverse a minor legal decision he had made, essentially on the grounds that it was inappropriate for a magistrate to reverse a decision on the instruction of the Government: \"I have yet to learn that a magistrate has any right to pursue a course which in his view is in opposition to Law upon the mere instructions of the Governor\"1.  Hampton was angered by Brown's repeated refusal to obey him, and by the \"tone and tenor\" of his letters, which he thought insolent.  Brown eventually resigned over the issue, but in the meantime, Hampton's appointment had ended.  Acting governor John Bruce, who agreed with Brown's legal position, smoothed the matter over, and Brown withdrew his resignation."]}, {"page": "Comptroller General of Convicts (Western Australia)", "response": ["After Henderson's resignation in 1863, William Newland was appointed his successor.  Newland's arrival closely followed the arrival of Governor John Hampton.  Hampton had previously been Comptroller General of Convicts in Van Diemen's Land, and assumed far more direct control of Western Australia's convict establishment than had his predecessors.  Newland and Hampton constantly disagreed with each other, and Hampton complained to the Secretary of State for the Colonies that Newland was incompetent.  Newland was eventually removed in 1866."]}]}}
