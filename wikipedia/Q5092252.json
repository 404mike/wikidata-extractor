In 1969, his show moved from the BBC to Thames Television, where it remained until its cancellation in 1989, with an erratic schedule of one-hour specials. The series showcased Hill's talents as an imaginative writer, comic performer and impressionist. He may have bought scripts from various comedy writers, but if so, they never received an onscreen credit (some evidence indicates he bought a script from one of his regular cast members in 1976, Cherri Gilham, to whom he wrote from Spain, telling her he was using her \"Fat Lady\" idea on the show in January 1977)."]}, {"page": "Vivian Stanshall", "response": ["A memorial plaque was unveiled in the Poets' Corner of Golders Green Crematorium on 13 December 2015, opposite that of his friend Keith Moon, by his widow Ki and his daughter Silky.

The cost of the plaque was met by many of his fans and friends via online crowdfunding."]}, {"page": "Page 3", "response": ["* Cherri Gilham "]}, {"page": "The Golden Shot", "response": ["The next host was comedian and entertainer Norman Vaughan, who was assisted by regular hostess Anne Aston and for several months \"Maid of the Month\" Cherri Gilham. In theory, Norman Vaughan was an ideal host for the show but the pressure of the live show seemed to overwhelm him and he was never as confident a host as Monkhouse. Audience figures began to drop and in late 1973, he was replaced by comedian (and former footballer) Charlie Williams along with hostess Wendy King. Williams, of Barbadian ancestry on his father's side and Yorkshire on his mother's side, was rather a novelty on British TV at the time, being a black man with a broad Yorkshire accent. Despite his cheerfulness and amiability he proved unsuited to handling the pressure of a live TV show where things frequently went wrong. After six months, Williams was also replaced."]}, {"page": "The Benny Hill Show", "response": ["The regular sexpot-type women include Jenny Lee-Wright, Sue Bond, Bettina Le Beau, Lesley Goldie, Cherri Gilham and Diana Darvey. In later years, the show included a dance troupe, the Hill's Angels, which was briefly preceded by the Love Machine. Regular Angels were Sue Upton and Louise English, whilst Jane Leeves also appeared as a Hill's Angel in a few episodes in the early 1980s; among those who appeared only once were Susan Clark and Sue McIntosh."]}, {"page": "Cherri", "response": ["*Cherri Gilham, British actress"]}, {"page": "Peter Collins (record producer)", "response": ["In 1976, Collins was signed to Magnet Records and formed a group called Madison, along with Sippy, Peter Spooner and Page 3 girl Cherri Gilham, to perform the pop song \"Let It Ring\".
