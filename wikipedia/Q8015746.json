His force of Georgian rebels and Dagestani auxiliaries fought a series of engagements with the Russian troops until its final defeat at the hands of General Dimitri Orbeliani in November 1812. In the meantime, in October 1812, General Pyotr Kotlyarevsky decisively defeated Abbas Mirza's attempt to advance towards Georgia in the battle of Aslanduz. According to the British officer William Monteith, who knew Alexander personally and accompanied him during his raid into Georgia, the rebellious prince, finding it impossible to raise the means of paying his Lezgian auxiliaries, had to consent to their carrying of Georgian slaves. As a result, Alexander's army was disbanded and he fled to the Khevsur highlanders. The Russians under General Stahl proceeded with ravaging the Khevsur villages, putting Alexander into flight to the Avars and other mountainous tribes of the Caucasus. The Russian authorities vainly pressured the mountaineers into surrendering the fugitive prince; they evinced toward him, in the words of Monteith, \"a fidelity equal to that of the Highlanders towards Charles Edward under similar circumstances after the battle of Culloden.\"", "Sir Robert Ker Porter, who saw Alexander in Tabriz in 1819 and noted his \"bold independence of spirit\" and irreconcilability to the Russian possession of Georgia, compared the refuge prince to \"the royal lion hunted from his hereditary waste, yet still returning to hover near, and roar in proud loneliness of his ceaseless threatening to the human strangers who had disturbed his reign\". William Monteith recalled that Alexander \"never showed any pride of birth, nor did he gave way to useless regrets for the loss of his fortune and princely dignity, though he had no hesitation in talking of his adventures, or giving any information that was asked for concerning them.\""]}, {"page": "Monteith", "response": ["* William Monteith (1790\u20131864), British soldier and historian"]}, {"page": "Meghri", "response": ["In 1810, young British army officer William Monteith visited the region as part of his service with the British embassy to Persia.

However, in 1812, Britain and Russia had reconciled, which meant that Britain was withdrawing its support from Iran. Christie, two other British officers (Henry Lindsay and William Monteith) and thirteen sergeants were allowed to remain in the Iranian service at the request of Crown Prince Abbas Mirza, commander of the Iranian army. Christie and Lindsay both participated in the Battle of Sultanabad (13\u00a0February 1812), in which the Iranian army achieved a victory.
