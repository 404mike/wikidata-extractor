For his part, Henry disliked Anne's constant irritability and violent temper. After a false pregnancy or miscarriage in 1534, he saw her failure to give him a son as a betrayal. As early as Christmas 1534, Henry was discussing with Cranmer and Cromwell the chances of leaving Anne without having to return to Catherine.

He left in June 1617 without taking a degree, immediately after his father's death. Early biographers claim that he then attended Lincoln's Inn, but the Inn's archives retain no record of him.

He kept his troops close together following skirmishes where they had gained superiority, rather than allowing them to chase opponents off the battlefield. This facilitated further engagements in short order, which allowed greater intensity and quick reaction to battle developments. This style of command was decisive at both Marston Moor and Naseby.Cromwell: Our Chief of Men, by Antonia Fraser, London 1973, Weidenfeld and Nicolson, , pp. 154\u2013161", "The following year, Charles II and his Scottish allies made an attempt to invade England and capture London while Cromwell was engaged in Scotland.

The majority of Marie Antoinette's and Louis XVII's biographers believe that the young prince was the biological son of Louis XVI, including Stefan Zweig and Antonia Fraser, who believe that Fersen and Marie Antoinette were indeed romantically involved.Stefan Zweig, Marie Antoinette: The portrait of an average woman, New York, 1933, pp. 143, 244\u201347Ian Dunlop, Marie-Antoinette: A Portrait, London, 1993\u00c9velyne Lever, Marie-Antoinette : la derni\u00e8re reine, Fayard, Paris, 2000Simone Berti\u00e8re, Marie-Antoinette: l'insoumise, Le Livre de Poche, Paris, 2003Jonathan Beckman, How to ruin a Queen: Marie Antoinette, the Stolen Diamonds and the Scandal that shook the French throne, London, 2014Munro Price, The Fall of the French Monarchy: Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette and the baron de Breteuil, London, 2002Deborah Cadbury, The Lost King of France: The tragic story of Marie-Antoinette's Favourite Son, London, 2003, pp. 22\u201324 Fraser has also noted that the birthdate matches up perfectly with a known conjugal visit from the King. Courtiers at Versailles noted in their diaries that the date of the child's conception in fact corresponded perfectly with a period when the King and the Queen had spent much time together, but these details were ignored amid attacks on the queen's character.Cadbury, p. 23 These suspicions of illegitimacy, along with the continued publication of the libelles and never-ending cavalcades of court intrigues, the actions of Joseph II in the Kettle War, the purchase of Saint-Cloud and the Affair of the Diamond Necklace combined to turn popular opinion sharply against the Queen, and the image of a licentious, spendthrift, empty-headed foreign queen was quickly taking root in the French psyche."]}, {"page": "Catherine Parr", "response": ["In March 1548, at the age of 35, Catherine became pregnant.

Although extant evidence does not support the notion of a fully-fledged m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois, or even that Seymour's flirtation with Elizabeth led to sexual intercourse with her, Starkey has speculated as to how such behaviour would play in front of a modern panel of social workers and pediatricians (Elizabeth, op.cit.)
