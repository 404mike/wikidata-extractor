K. Rowling, about whose encounters with ancient authors he has written. Because of his connection with Rowling, Wiseman attracted brief pop-culture notoriety when media speculated that he was a model for the character of Albus Dumbledore in the Harry Potter series of books and movies.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Persephone", "response": ["The Romans first heard of her from the Aeolian and Dorian cities of Magna Graecia, who used the dialectal variant Proserpin\u0113 ().

His servile birth-mythos, his populist leanings and his reorganisation of the vici appear to justify the Roman belief that he founded or reformed the Compitalia festivals (held to celebrate the Lares that watched over each local community), or allowed for the first time their attendance and service by non-citizens and slaves.Lott, John. B., The Neighborhoods of Augustan Rome, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2004. p. 31 ff. His personal reputation and achievements may have led to his historical association with temples and shrines to Fortuna; some sources suggest that the two were connected during Servius' lifetime, via some form of \"sacred marriage\". Plutarch explicitly identifies the Porta Fenestella (\"window gate\") of the Royal palace as the window from which Tanaquil announced Servius' regency to the people; the goddess Fortuna was said to have passed through the same window, to become Servius' consort.Cornell, pp. 146 - 148. cf. images of a \"goddess at the window\" and forms of ruler-marriage to a tutelary deity.

By the late Republic, ludi were held on 57 days of the year;Bunson, Matthew, A Dictionary of the Roman Empire, Oxford University Press, 1995, p. 246. an unknown number of these would have required full use of the Circus. On many other days, charioteers and jockeys would need to practise on its track. Otherwise, it would have made a convenient corral for the animals traded in the nearby Forum Boarium, just outside the starting gate. Beneath the outer stands, next to the Circus' multiple entrances, were workshops and shops. When no games were being held, the Circus at the time of Catullus (mid-1st century BC) was probably  \"a dusty open space with shops and booths ... a colourful crowded disreputable area\", citing T.

It had been definitely published by 46 BC, when Cicero reviewed it and gave it great praise. It is unclear whether the books were released invididually, or all at once. Nipperdey's 1847 account believed that they had been mostly all composed at once in 50 BC. Frank Adcock suggested in 1956 that they had been written in stages, but then published simultaneously. T. P. Wiseman believed they were written and published yearly, as Caesar would have gained enormous utility from keeping the public informed about his exploits. The debate as to the time and nature of publication continues, with critical examination of the evolution of the writing style the chief tool for dating the work. Even if the works were published after the wars, it was clear that Caesar was waging a propaganda campaign during the war, including writing copious letters to his political allies back in Rome. Because of the questionable nature of the war, and threats by his enemies to have him essentially tried for war crimes, winning the public relations battle was critical for Caesar."]}, {"page": "Romulus and Remus", "response": ["Current scholarship offers little evidence to support any particular version of the Roman foundation myth, including a historical Romulus or Remus.Rodriguez Mayorgas p.91 Starting with Fabius Pictor, the written accounts must have reflected the commonly-held history of the city to some degree.Rodriguez Mayorgas p.90 The archaeologist Andrea Carandini is one of very few modern scholars who accept Romulus and Remus as historical figures, and dates an ancient wall on the north slope of the Palatine Hill to the mid-8th century BC and names it the Murus Romuli.See Carandini, La nascita di Roma.

It was established around 200 BC in the Aventine grove of Stimula by a priestess from Campania, near the temple where Liber Pater (\"the Free Father\") had a State-sanctioned, popular cult. Liber was a native Roman god of wine, fertility, and prophecy, patron of Rome's plebeians (citizen-commoners), and one of the members of the Aventine Triad, along with his mother Ceres and sister or consort Libera. A temple to the Triad was erected on the Aventine Hill in 493 BC, along with the institution of celebrating the festival of Liberalia. The worship of the Triad gradually took on more and more Greek influence, and by 205 BC, Liber and Libera had been formally identified with Bacchus and Proserpina.T. P. Wiseman, \"Satyrs in Rome? The Background to Horace's Ars Poetica\", The Journal of Roman Studies, Vol. 78 (1988), p. 7, note 52. Liber was often interchangeably identified with Dionysus and his mythology, though this identification was not universally accepted.Grimal, Pierre, The Dictionary of Classical Mythology, Wiley-Blackwell, 1996, .

Pulcher, the senior consul, supported by a council of war, believed these gave him sufficient advantage to risk an attack on the Carthaginian fleet at Drepana,  north of Lilybaeum along the west coast of Sicily. The Roman fleet sailed on a moonless night to avoid detection and ensure surprise. The Romans had a tradition of divining the likely fortune of a military endeavour by observing the actions of the sacred chickens. In the early morning they would be offered food: if they ate eagerly, the omens were good; if they refused it, the action was ill-fated. When the solemn ceremony was performed on the way to Drepana, the chickens declined to eat. Infuriated, Pulcher pitched them overboard, exclaiming that if they were not hungry, then perhaps they were thirsty. Polybius does not mention this, which has caused some modern historians to doubt its veracity. T. P.

In particular, T. P.

This tradition casts doubt on the usage of numerical names: the masculine praenomina Quintus (\"the Fifth\"), Sextus (\"the Sixth\"), and Decimus (\"the Tenth\") were widely used without reference to birth order, because they were passed on. Thus the semi-legendary Claudia Quinta should have been the fifth daughter of her patrician father from the gens Claudia, but it is doubtful that four older sisters existed: Quinta is probably an archaic feminine praenomen that later Latin authors treated as a cognomen.T.
