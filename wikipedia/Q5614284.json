The hoard is known as the Traprain Treasure, or Traprain Law Treasure. Consisting of over  of sliced-up Roman-era silver, the discovery was made in a pit within the boundary of the settlement earlier uncovered. Four Gallic coins were discovered with the hoard; one of the emperor Valens (reigned 364\u2013378), three of Arcadius (reigned 383\u2013408) and one of Honorius (reigned 393\u2013423), which dates the find to some point in the fifth century AD after the Romans had left Britain. The quality of some of the items suggests that they may have come from as far afield as Rome, Ravenna, or possibly Antioch or Constantinople.HMSO Information Sheet 7/1980, The Treasure of Traprain.

Preliminary ideas for a Scottish museum were drawn up in 1917 by Alexander Ormiston Curle, curator of the National Museum of Scotland, under advice from organisers in London, as well as a civic committee of the Edinburgh council, set up by Lord Provost John Lorne MacLeod. John Stewart-Murray, 8th Duke of Atholl, was also a supporter of the idea. The committee worked through 1918 and 1919 on ideas for the museum, including plans for procuring exhibits. After the end of the war, however, priority was given to the construction of the Scottish National War Memorial, which opened in 1927, and the museum project was put on hold."]}, {"page": "Melrose Abbey", "response": ["* Alexander Ormiston Curle"]}, {"page": "Joseph Anderson (antiquarian)", "response": ["He retired from the Museum in 1913 following the death of his wife and was succeeded by Alexander Ormiston Curle."]}, {"page": "Thomas Carlaw Martin", "response": ["When he retired in 1916 from the museum, he was succeeded by Alexander Ormiston Curle."]}, {"page": "Alexander Curle", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alexander Ormiston Curle"]}]}}
