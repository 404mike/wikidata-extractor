This conclusion was later rendered false by the discovery of the theory of conjoint measurement by Debreu (1960) and independently by Luce & Tukey (1964). However, Stevens's reaction was not to conduct experiments to test for the presence of additive structure in sensations, but instead to render the conclusions of the Ferguson committee null and void by proposing a new theory of measurement:"]}, {"page": "Gateway to the Great Books", "response": ["*Norman Robert Campbell, \"Measurement\", \"Numerical Laws and the Use of Mathematics in Science\" "]}, {"page": "List of philosophers born in the 19th century", "response": ["* Norman Robert Campbell, (1880\u20131949)"]}, {"page": "List of philosophers (A\u2013C)", "response": ["* Norman Robert Campbell (1880\u20131949)"]}, {"page": "Campbell (surname)", "response": ["* Norman Robert Campbell, English physicist and measuremental theorist"]}, {"page": "Theory of conjoint measurement", "response": ["In the 1930s, the British Association for the Advancement of Science established the Ferguson Committee to investigate the possibility of psychological attributes being measured scientifically. The British physicist and measurement theorist Norman Robert Campbell was an influential member of the committee. In its Final Report (Ferguson, et al., 1940), Campbell and the Committee concluded that because psychological attributes were not capable of sustaining concatenation operations, such attributes could not be continuous quantities. Therefore, they could not be measured scientifically. This had important ramifications for psychology, the most significant of these being the creation in 1946 of the operational theory of measurement by Harvard psychologist Stanley Smith Stevens.
