He played as a left-sided forward.\nHigginson was born in Dudley, which was then in Worcestershire, and played for Gornal Wood and Dudley Town before joining Small Heath in 1900. On his debut in the Second Division on 6 October 1900, Higginson scored the second goal in a 2\u20130 home win against Burton Swifts, and followed this up with goals in the next two games. Unable to maintain this level of goalscoring, Higginson lost his place to the newly arrived Johnny McMillan. He played only rarely after the club's promotion to the First Division, and returned to non-league football with Stourbridge in 1902.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jack Higginson", "response": ["Jack Higginson may refer to:", "* Jack Higginson (athlete) (1891-1966), British Olympic athlete", "* Jack Higginson (footballer) (1876\u2013?), English footballer", "* Jack Higginson (rugby league) (born 1997), rugby league player"]}]}}
