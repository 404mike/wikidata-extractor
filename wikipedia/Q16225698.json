They arrived at Lyttelton on the Cressy, one of Canterbury's First Four Ships. She had already had some years of art training in England before emigrating, and on arrival she continued to paint. She specialised in portraits, and her portrait of the Chairman of the Colonists' Association (her husband, Dr Donald) was exhibited in Christchurch in 1852. Townsend also produced drawings and watercolours of Lyttelton, one of which was used to illustrate the Canterbury Association's Canterbury Papers 1850\u20131851. In 1870, Townsend's work was included in the first art exhibition held in Christchurch, staged by the Canterbury Provincial Council and held at a temporary annex of the Canterbury Museum."]}, {"page": "James Townsend (1788\u20131866)", "response": ["#REDIRECT James Townsend (New Zealand settler)"]}, {"page": "James Townsend (1788-1866)", "response": ["#REDIRECT :James Townsend (New Zealand settler)"]}, {"page": "James Townsend (cricketer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT James Townsend (New Zealand settler)"]}]}}
