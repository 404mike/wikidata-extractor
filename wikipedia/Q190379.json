In 2008, The Times featured him on its list of \"The 50 greatest British writers since 1945\" and The Daily Telegraph ranked him number 19 in its list of the \"100 most powerful people in British culture\".McEwan began his career writing sparse, Gothic short stories. His first two novels, The Cement Garden (1978) and The Comfort of Strangers (1981), earned him the nickname \"Ian Macabre\". These were followed by three novels of some success in the 1980s and early 1990s. His novel Enduring Love was adapted into a film of the same name. He won the Booker Prize with Amsterdam (1998). His next novel, Atonement, garnered acclaim and was adapted into an Oscar-winning film featuring Keira Knightley and James McAvoy. His later novels have included The Children Act, Nutshell, and Machines Like Me. He was awarded the 1999 Shakespeare Prize, and the 2011 Jerusalem Prize.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bletchley Park", "response": ["* Ian McEwan's television play The Imitation Game (1980) concludes at Bletchley Park."]}, {"page": "Booker Prize", "response": ["Between 2005 and 2008, the Booker Prize alternated between writers from Ireland and India. \"Outsider\" John Banville began this trend in 2005 when his novel The Sea was selected as a surprise winner: Boyd Tonkin, literary editor of The Independent, famously condemned it as \"possibly the most perverse decision in the history of the award\" and rival novelist Tibor Fischer poured scorn on Banville's victory.

Henry James wrote that Arnold's poetry will appeal to those who \"like their pleasures rare\" and who like to hear the poet \"taking breath\".
