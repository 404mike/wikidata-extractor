This broke a 12 match winless run in the league, 13 matches in all competitions. McCarthy guided Ipswich past Burnley on 10 November \u2013 the first home win since March after a late DJ Campbell winner. The match ended 2\u20131.

His final season with the club was marred by a fractured relationship between him and the club's supporters, with many supporters voicing their dissatisfaction with McCarthy's defensive style of play and McCarthy branding them as \"numbskulls\". He left the club earlier than expected on 10 April 2018, shortly after a 1\u20130 home win over Barnsley.", "On 25 November 2018, McCarthy was appointed manager of Republic of Ireland for the second time in his career, replacing Martin O'Neill.

McCarthy appointed Terry Connor as his assistant, who he had worked with at Wolverhampton Wanderers and Ipswich Town respectively. Ireland's record goalscorer Robbie Keane was announced as a member of the backroom team. He started poorly with an unconvincing 1\u20130 win over Gibraltar after having previously beaten them 7\u20130 and 4\u20130 in the past. However, a good performance against Georgia saw another 1\u20130 win thanks to a Conor Hourihane free kick. The wins left them top of the group, a position they still held three matches later in mid-September 2019, with just three matches remaining.
