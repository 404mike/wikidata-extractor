However, evaluation of the suit showed that it encumbered the wearer and did not integrate well with RAF escape systems. Instead, the RAF IAM proposed a minimal-coverage suit which would provide \"get-me-down\" protection. The RAF never issued a partial-pressure suit, preferring instead to use anti-g trousers in conjunction with pressure jerkins (which applied mechanical counter-pressure to the wearer's chest)."]}, {"page": "Deaths in October 2006", "response": ["*Walter Gibb, 87, British aviator and test pilot who twice held the world flight altitude record."]}, {"page": "Flight altitude record", "response": ["||Walter Gibb", "||Walter Gibb"]}, {"page": "Gibb", "response": ["* Walter Gibb (1919\u20132006), British test pilot"]}, {"page": "List of Old Cliftonians", "response": ["* Walter Gibb, world record holder (altitude)"]}, {"page": "Walter Borchers", "response": ["Having claimed an Avro Lancaster, Borchers was shot down and killed in action on the night of 6 March 1945 by a long-range British night fighter north of Altenburg.
