As the twin daughters of John Smith of Irvine, Ayrshire, Scotland, they learned more than 12 languages between them, and became acclaimed scholars in their academic fields, and benefactors to the Presbyterian Church of England, especially to Westminster College, Cambridge.Agnes Lewis's discovery of the Syriac Sinaiticus (Old Syriac Gospels), on their first journey to Sinai (1892), was one of the most important palimpsest manuscript find since that of the Codex Sinaiticus in 1859 by Constantin von Tischendorf next to the Syriac Curetonian Gospels, today British Library. Her second most valuable attribution to the field of Aramaic (Christian Palestinian Aramaic, Syriac) studies and New and Old Testament text critique was the purchase of another unique palimpsest manuscript, the Codex Climaci Rescriptus, in Egypt (Cairo 1895; Port Tewfik 1906), and the largest batch from an anonymous Berlin (Germany) scholar (1905), containing underneath several individual manuscripts in Christian Palestinian Aramaic of various lectionaries with Gospels, Epistles, and Old Testament pericopes, an early apocryphal text Dormition of Mary with the hagiographic story of Peter and Paul (6th century), and Greek with Gospels (7th/8th centuries), overwritten by the Syriac translation of scala paradisi and liber ad pastorem by the monk John Climacus of Sinai, of which now surfaced the missing quire at Saint Catherine\u2019s Monastery.", "link_mentions": {}}}
