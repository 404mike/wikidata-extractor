His work is often coupled with that of Lucie Rie due to their close association, even though their best known work differs dramatically, with Rie's being less sculptural, while Coper's was much more abstract, but also always functional.  The latter point was noted by M. S. Thomas in his recent book \"The Essential Potness.\" Coper always made functional vessels, principally containers for flowers (vases), fruit (bowls), candles (candle holders) including work for Coventry Cathedral and Sussex University meeting house. He made a small group of Figures in the fifties, which were not vessels and were never put on sale (see Tony Birks).\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ethical pot", "response": ["The term \"ethical pot\" was coined by Oliver Watson in his book Studio Pottery: Twentieth Century British Ceramics in the Victoria and Albert Museum to describe a 20th-century trend in studio pottery that favoured plain, utilitarian ceramics.

It is represented by potters all over the world but has strong roots in Britain, with potters such as Bernard Leach, William Staite Murray, Dora Billington, Lucie Rie and Hans Coper. Bernard Leach (1887\u20131979) established a style of pottery influenced by Far-Eastern and medieval English forms. After briefly experimenting with earthenware, he turned to stoneware fired to high temperatures in large oil- or wood-burning kilns.  This style dominated British studio pottery in the mid-20th-century.  The Austrian refugee Lucie Rie (1902\u20131995) has been regarded as essentially a modernist who experimented with new glaze effects on often brightly coloured bowls and bottles. Hans Coper (1920\u20131981) produced non-functional, sculptural and unglazed pieces.  After the Second World War, studio pottery in Britain was encouraged by the wartime ban on decorating manufactured pottery and the modernist spirit of the Festival of Britain.  The simple, functional designs chimed in with the modernist ethos.  Several potteries were formed in response to this fifties boom, and this style of studio pottery remained popular into the nineteen-seventies.Harrod, Tanya, \"From A Potter's Book to The Maker's Eye: British Studio Ceramics 1940\u20131982\", in The Harrow Connection, Northern Centre for Contemporary Art, 1989 Elizabeth Fritsch (1940-) took up ceramics working under Hans Coper at the Royal College of Art (1968\u20131971). Fritsch was one of a group of outstanding ceramicists who emerged from the Royal College of Art at that time. Fritschs' ceramic vessels broke away from traditional methods and she developed a hand built flattened coil technique in stoneware smoothed and refined into accurately profiled forms.

Working at a studio she set up at Great Baddow she produced simpler designs with reduced decoration based around a few elemental shapes.
