The first to present a proof was Gustav Kramer in his work Styl und Herkunft der bemalten griechischen Tongef\u00e4\u00dfe (1837).

Eduard Gerhard published an article entitled Rapporto Volcente in the Annali dell\u2019Instituto di Corrispondenza Archeologica in which he systematically investigated the vases; he was the first scholar to do so. Toward this end in 1830 he studied vases found in Tarquinia, comparing them, for example, with vases found in Attica and Aegina. During this work he identified 31 painter and potter signatures.

Middleton executed the drawings while traveling in Italy during 1808 and 1809 and considered his work an artistic achievement. He attributed more importance to the drawings than the text, but because it appeared during a time of turmoil in Europe, his work received slight attention from contemporaries. Some of the drawings appeared in later works on archaeology without credit to Middleton, notably those of Edward Dodwell with whom Middleton travelled.
