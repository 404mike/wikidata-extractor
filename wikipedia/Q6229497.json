In 1936, Celtic fielded trialist Mohammed Salim in two Alliance league matches, with him becoming the first footballer from the Indian sub-continent to play for a European club. A league AGM in 1938, resulted in the non-league sides being removed and the league became exclusive to First Division reserve sides. The advent of World War II, however, once again saw the suspension of national reserve league football in Scotland, although regional leagues were set up."]}, {"page": "John Divers (footballer born 1911)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Divers (footballer, born 1911)"]}, {"page": "List of Scottish football families", "response": ["*  Patsy Gallacher, Willie Gallacher (son), Tommy Gallacher (son), John Divers Sr. (nephew), Brian Gallacher (grandson, son of Tommy), Kevin Gallacher (grandson), John Divers Jr. (great-nephew)"]}]}}
