Birmingham Daily Post. p. 7. 16 February 1891. In Jenkyns' absence, the 36-year-old Charlie Simms played his first and only league match of the season, at home to Grimsby Town. Short scored early in the second half, but the forwards lacked composure in front of goal, and despite Charsley's best efforts, Grimsby scored twice. After the match, the Post correspondent described Small Heath as \"a most erratic combination\".Notes on Sport and The Alliance. Small Heath v. Grimsby Town. Birmingham Daily Post. p. 7. 23 February 1891. As if to illustrate the point, they beat leading club Nottingham Forest twice in three days. At Nottingham, on a frosty pitch with bright, low sun that made goalkeeping difficult, the two teams scored alternately, Forest taking the lead and Heath equalising, until 4\u20134, when Short's 73rd-minute winner inflicted Forest's first home league defeat of the season.Football.
