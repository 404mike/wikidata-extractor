Crerar took the matter to General Montgomery, the Eighth Army commander, but found little support. On 11 December 1943 Crerar sent a memo to Montgomery declaring he had \"serious cause to doubt...the suitability of Simonds for higher command\", going on to write that he believed that Simonds was mentally ill, saying that Simonds had \"always been high strung...with a tendency to be introspective rather than objective, when faced with acute problems\". Montgomery wrote back that he had the \"highest opinion of Simonds\" and rejected Crerar's claims that he was mentally ill.English (1991) p. 187. However, Crerar discussed the event with army psychiatrists, the Canadian First Army commander, Lieutenant-General Kenneth Stuart, and post-war pushed for Charles Foulkes to be selected as Chief of the General Staff (CGS) over Simonds.Dancocks, pp. 205\u2013207.", "Simonds, by his own admission, was bad-tempered, unable to tolerate those he regarded as fools, and had a headstrong streak, which he attempted to check by maintaining a cold \"glacial\" composure. Simonds always spoke with a strong English accent, and his personality never inspired any affection from the men under his command who regarded him as a \"cold Englishman.\" One Canadian brigadier wrote that Simonds \"was not a man one could love. In my heart I knew, however, that I would rather serve under his type than under a kindly, but less driving commander; the former is much more likely to win battles\".  Simonds had a long-standing feud with his fellow British immigrant Charles Foulkes, going back to their days as students at the Staff College where Simonds had received greater recognition than Foulkes. Both Foulkes and Simonds were ambitious men with strong ruthless streaks, and together with General Harry Crerar, who had \"a nasty streak of his own\", the three officers were the ones most responsible for the command decisions of the Canadians in the Normandy campaign. Relations between Simonds and his commanding officer, Crerar, were very poor as Crerar had attempted to sack Simonds as commander of the 5th Canadian Division in December 1943.English (1991) p. 186-187. However, Simonds was a favorite of Bernard Law Montgomery, who viewed Simonds as the most talented Canadian general in the entire war, and Montgomery blocked Crerar's attempts to send Simonds back to Canada.English (1991) p. 186-188.", "Simonds was \"undoubtedly deeply hurt\" when he was passed over for Charles Foulkes as Chief of the General Staff (CGS) in August 1945.C.P.
