He was said to be courted by several teams, including the Oakland Raiders and San Francisco 49ers. In July it was confirmed the New York Giants had offered him the opportunity to trial with them after the Rugby League Tri-Nations series finished in November. However, the Canterbury club had dismissed the deal, and Mason remained with the club beyond 2006.  In 2006, Willie returned to become a regular member of the Bulldogs team where he managed to play 20 club matches, all three Origin games for NSW \u2013 in which he was named Man of the Match in the opening game and three Tests for Australia in the 2006 Tri-Nations series. He was a firm figure in the clubs return to finals football as the Bulldogs finished second on the ladder, Canterbury-Bankstown were beaten by eventual Premiers the Brisbane Broncos one game shy of the Grand Final. Mason was televised appearing to swear during the New Zealand haka, before game 1 of the 2006 Gillette Tri-nations Series. Later in the match Mason suffered a swollen black eye and suspected broken eye socket from a shoulder charge by David Kidwell. Mason explained that his swearing was in response to the traditional M\u0101ori dance being performed by Brent Webb, an Indigenous Australian of Torres Strait Islander origin who became a New Zealand citizen. Mason was banned for one game and fined $5,000 following an altercation with Stuart Fielden during Great Britain's victory over Australia in November 2006. In December 2006 Mason took part in a trial with the New York Jets, but still maintained he would fulfil his contract with the Canterbury club until the end of the 2009 season. Mason said \"I'm probably at the time in my career now where maybe it is time for a change. New York City is the capital of the world. I'm pretty sure I could settle in there if given the opportunity...\" However a Jets representative stated that Mason even being offered a contract was very unlikely, \"I don't think they were even football drills, it was more of a visit. We just had a look at him and that is where we left it.\" The Jets coach Eric Mangini was impressed with Mason, saying \"Willie is a guy that came to our attention, he is a pretty good rugby player, and it was just one of those opportunities we had, where we have to take a look at him. What we're doing is taking a look at him, seeing what potential there is for him. He seems to have been a pretty dynamic guy in that league for a long time. He seemed relatively feisty when I spoke to him.\" The Bulldogs never anticipated any move, saying \"Willie has given us his guarantee he will be with us.\""]}, {"page": "Joe Vagana", "response": ["Despite competition from other Super League and Australian clubs, Vagana signed for the Bradford Bulls in 2001.
