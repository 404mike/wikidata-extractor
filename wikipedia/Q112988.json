Hopfe states that more than 400 Mithraic sites have been found. These sites are spread all over the Roman empire from places as far as Dura Europos in the east, and England in the west. He, too, says that Mithraism may have been a rival of Christianity. David Ulansey thinks Renan's statement \"somewhat exaggerated\", but does consider Mithraism \"one of Christianity's major competitors in the Roman Empire\".

In the Cappadocian kingdom, whose territory was formerly an Achaemenid possession, Persian colonists, cut off from their co-religionists in Iran proper, continued to practice the faith [Zoroastrianism] of their forefathers; and there Strabo, observing in the first century B.C., records (XV.3.15) that these \"fire kindlers\" possessed many \"holy places of the Persian Gods\", as well as fire temples.Mary Boyce. Zoroastrians: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices Psychology Press, 2001 , p. 85 Strabo further states that these were \"noteworthy enclosures; and in their midst there is an altar, on which there is a large quantity of ashes and where the magi keep the fire ever burning.\" It was not until the end of the Parthian period (247 \u2013 224) that Zoroastrianism would receive renewed interest.", "As late as the Parthian period, a form of Zoroastrianism was without a doubt the dominant religion in the Armenian lands.Mary Boyce. Zoroastrians: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices Psychology Press, 2001 , p. 84 The Sassanids aggressively promoted the Zurvanite form of Zoroastrianism, often building fire temples in captured territories to promote the religion. During the period of their centuries-long suzerainty over the Caucasus, the Sassanids made attempts to promote Zoroastrianism there with considerable successes, and it was prominent in the pre-Christian Caucasus (especially modern-day Azerbaijan).", "In time, a tradition evolved by which Islam was made to appear as a partly Iranian religion. One example of this was a legend that Husayn, son of the fourth caliph Ali and grandson of Islam's prophet Muhammad, had married a captive Sassanid princess named Shahrbanu. This \"wholly fictitious figure\". was said to have borne Husayn a son, the historical fourth Shi'a imam, who claimed that the caliphate rightly belonged to him and his descendants, and that the Umayyads had wrongfully wrested it from him. The alleged descent from the Sassanid house counterbalanced the Arab nationalism of the Umayyads, and the Iranian national association with a Zoroastrian past was disarmed. Thus, according to scholar Mary Boyce, \"it was no longer the Zoroastrians alone who stood for patriotism and loyalty to the past.\" The \"damning indictment\" that becoming Muslim was Un-Iranian only remained an idiom in Zoroastrian texts."]}, {"page": "Zoroaster", "response": ["Some scholars: \"At present, the majority opinion among scholars probably inclines toward the end of the second millennium or the beginning of the first, although there are still those who hold for a date in the seventh century.\" such as Mary Boyce (who dated Zoroaster to somewhere between 1700 and 1000 BCE) used linguistic and socio-cultural evidence to place Zoroaster between 1500 and 1000 BCE (or 1200 and 900 BCE). The basis of this theory is primarily proposed on linguistic similarities between the Old Avestan language of the Zoroastrian Gathas and the Sanskrit of the Rigveda (c. 1700\u20131100 BCE), a collection of early Vedic hymns. Both texts are considered to have a common archaic Indo-Iranian origin. The Gathas portray an ancient Stone-Bronze Age bipartite society of warrior-herdsmen and priests (compared to Bronze tripartite society; some conjecture that it depicts the Yaz culture), and that it is thus implausible that the Gathas and Rigveda could have been composed more than a few centuries apart. These scholars suggest that Zoroaster lived in an isolated tribe or composed the Gathas before the 1200\u20131000 BCE migration by the Iranians from the steppe to the Iranian Plateau. The shortfall of the argument is the vague comparison, and the archaic language of Gathas does not necessarily indicate time difference."]}, {"page": "Turan", "response": ["According to Mary Boyce, in the Farvardin Yasht, \"In it (verses 143\u2013144) are praised the fravashis of righteous men and women not only among the Aryas (as the \"Avestan\" people called themselves), but also among the Turiyas, Sairimas, Sainus and Dahis; and the personal names, like those of the people, all seem Iranian character\".M.

From the personal names of Medes as recorded by Assyrians (in 8th and 9th centuries BC) there are examples of the use of the Indo-Iranian word arta- (lit. \"truth\") which is familiar from both Avestan and Old Persian and also examples of theophoric names containing Ma\u017edakku and also the name \"Ahura Mazd\u0101\". Scholars disagree whether these are indications of Zoroastrian religion amongst the Medes. Diakonoff believes that \"Astyages and perhaps even Cyaxares had already embraced a religion derived from the teachings of Zoroaster\" and Mary Boyce believes that \"the existence of the Magi in Media with their own traditions and forms of worship was an obstacle to Zoroastrian proselytizing there\". Boyce wrote that the Zoroastrian traditions in the Median city of Ray probably goes back to the 8th century BC. It is suggested that from the 8th century BC, a form of \"Mazdaism with common Iranian traditions\" existed in Media and the strict reforms of Zarathustra began to spread in western Iran during the reign of the last Median kings in the 6th century BC."]}, {"page": "Nowruz", "response": ["* \"Nowruz, \u201cNew Day\u201d, is a traditional ancient festival which celebrates the starts of the Persian New Year.

Mary Boyce and Frantz Grenet explain the traditions for seasonal festivals and comment: \"It is possible that the splendor of the Babylonian festivities at this season, led the Iranians to develop their own spring festival into an established New Year feast, with the name Navasarda \"New Year\" (a name which, though first attested through Middle Persian derivatives, is attributed to the Achaemenian period).\"  Akitu was the Babylonian festivity held during the spring month of Nisan in which Nowruz falls. Since the communal observations of the ancient Iranians appear in general to have been seasonal ones and related to agriculture, \"it is probable that they traditionally held festivals in both autumn and spring, to mark the major turning points of the natural year.\"A History of Zoroastrianism: Under the Achaemenians", "By Mary Boyce, Frantz Grenet. Brill, 1982", "Nowruz is partly rooted in the tradition of Iranian religions, such as Mithraism and Zoroastrianism. In Mithraism, festivals had a deep linkage with the Sun's light. The Iranian festivals such as Mehregan (autumnal equinox), Tirgan, and the eve of Chelle ye Zemestan (winter solstice) also had an origin in the Sun god (Mithra). Among other ideas, Zoroastrianism is the first monotheistic religion that emphasizes broad concepts such as the corresponding work of good and evil in the world, and the connection of humans to nature. Zoroastrian practices were dominant for much of the history of ancient Iran. In Zoroastrianism, the seven most important Zoroastrian festivals are the six Gahambar festivals and Nowruz, which occurs at the spring equinox. According to Mary Boyce,Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica, \"Festivals: Zoroastrian\" Boyce, Mary  \"It seems a reasonable surmise that Nowruz, the holiest of them all, with deep doctrinal significance, was founded by Zoroaster himself\"; although there is no clear date of origin.Boyce, M. \"Festivals. i.

Between sunset on the day of the sixth Gahambar and sunrise of Nowruz, Hamaspathmaedaya (later known, in its extended form, as Frawardinegan; and today is known as Farvardigan) was celebrated.

As part of their religion, these priests paid particular attention to the stars and gained an international reputation for astrology, which was at that time highly regarded as a science. Their religious practices and use of astrology caused derivatives of the term Magi to be applied to the occult in general and led to the English term magic. The King James Version translates the term as wise men; the same translation is applied to the wise men led by Daniel of earlier Hebrew Scriptures ().  The same word is given as sorcerer and sorcery when describing \"Elymas the sorcerer\" in , and Simon Magus, considered a heretic by the early Church, in . Several translations refer to the men outright as astrologers at Matthew Chapter 2, including New English Bible (1961); Phillips New Testament in Modern English (J.B.Phillips, 1972); Twentieth Century New Testament (1904 revised edition); Amplified Bible (1958-New Testament); An American Translation (1935, Goodspeed); and The Living Bible (K.
