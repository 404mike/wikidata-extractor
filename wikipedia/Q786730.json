It is not absolutely certain that this was the actor, though the name was not common at the time.. He was most likely the son of William Hart, a minor actor with the King's Men. Hart began his career as a boy player with the King's Men; he was an apprentice of Richard Robinson, longtime member of that company. Hart established his reputation by playing the role of the Duchess in The Cardinal, the tragedy by James Shirley, in 1641. Wright says in Historia histrionica that:\"Hart and Clun, were bred up Boys at the Blackfriers; and Acted Womens Parts, Hart was [Richard] Robinson's Boy or Apprentice: He Acted the Dutchess in the Tragedy of the Cardinal, which was the first Part that gave him Reputation.\"He served as a soldier in the English Civil War, and was an officer in Prince Rupert's regiment of cavalry, along with fellow actors Nicholas Burt and Robert Shatterell. Hart and the others most likely saw combat at the battles of Marston Moor and Naseby, and perhaps at Edgehill as well.Hart then returned to acting; evidence suggests he was with other displaced English actors in Europe in 1646. In 1648, Hart, Walter Clun and eight other actors, were involved in an attempt to restart the King's Men company during the Puritan Commonwealth, which, perhaps unsurprisingly, did not succeed. On 5 February 1648, at the Cockpit Theatre, Hart and other King's Men were arrested for violating the ban against theatrical performance; they were caught in the midst of a performance of Rollo Duke of Normandy (in which Hart played the character Otto). Hart and the others were imprisoned for a short time, then released.Just before the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660, acting resumed on a larger scale, and Hart seems to have been then a member of a company performing at the Cockpit playhouse, led by Michael Mohun. As soon as the King's Company was formed in 1660, Hart became one of its leading men; he specialised in playing the male half of witty, bantering couples. This type of dialogue in Restoration comedy was largely influenced by the talents and personalities of Hart and Nell Gwyn, in plays like James Howard's The Mad Couple; Gwyn was his mistress before she became Charles II's. Hart's natural dignity in playing royal roles was also often commented on by contemporaries, and in the heroic play he \"was celebrated for superman roles, notably the arrogant, bloodthirsty Almanzor in John Dryden's Conquest of Granada.\"When Hart played in Euterpe Restored in 1672, Richard Flecknoe composed the following lines:\n\nBeauty to the eye, and music to the ear,\nSuch even the nicest critics must allow\nBurbage was once and such Charles Hart is now.Throughout his Restoration career, Hart filled a range of noteworthy parts. He was Cassio in early stagings of Shakespear's Othello; after 1669 he played the title role. He played roles in revivals of plays by Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, and John Fletcher \u2014\n\nHotspur in Henry IV, Part 1\nBrutus in Julius Caesar\nMosca in Volpone\nDemetrius in The Humorous Lieutenant\nMichael Perez in Rule a Wife and Have a Wife\nArbaces in A King and No King\nAmintor in The Maid's Tragedy\nRollo in Rollo Duke of Normandy\nWelford in The Scornful Lady\nDon John in The Chances\u2014 and in contemporary dramas, by John Dryden \u2014\n\nMarc Antony in All for Love\nPorphyrius in Tyrannick Love\nAurange Zebe in Aurang-zebe\nCeladon in The Maiden Queen\nWildblood in An Evening's Love\nCortez in The Indian Emperour\nAurelian in The Assignation\u2014 and by other dramatists \u2014\n\nHorner in Wycherly's The Country Wife\nManly in Wycherly's The Plain Dealer\nPhraartes in Crowne's The Destruction of Jerusalem\nMassinissa in Lee's Sophonisba, or Hannibal's Overthrow\nAlexander the Great in Lee's The Rival Queens\nZiphares in Lee's Mythridates, King of Pontus\nLord Delaware in Boyle's The Black Prince.In 1682, when the King's Company joined with the Duke's Company to form the United Company, Hart retired due to poor health, with a pension of 40 shillings per week.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "English Renaissance theatre", "response": ["*Charles Hart"]}, {"page": "Charles Hart (17-th century actor)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Charles Hart (actor)"]}, {"page": "Amboyna (play)", "response": ["The original production was acted by the King's Company at the theatre at Lincoln's Inn Fields.
