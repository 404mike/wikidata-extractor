He underwent many surgeries on his way to recovery, and was a founding member of the Guinea Pig Club.

McIndoe had been elected life president at the club's foundation: after his death in 1960, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, became president.

McIndoe moved to the recently rebuilt Queen Victoria Hospital in East Grinstead, Sussex, and founded a Centre for Plastic and Jaw Surgery.

In mid-afternoon through cloudy and foggy skies Jabs made the short trip back to his home base at Deelen. As Jabs approached Deelen he could see a small group of single engine fighters low over the airfield, which he took to be German. The aircraft, in fact, were from No. 132 Squadron RAF, led by Squadron Leader Geoffrey Page, who had taken a flight of Spitfires on a low level mission looking for enemy aircraft. The approaching twin engine fighter was just what Page was looking for. As Jabs continued his approach he saw the aircraft turn toward him. Realizing his mistake, he flew toward his attackers and through some cloud. Emerging on the other side he found himself approaching head on with the Spitfire of New Zealander John Caulton. As the two aircraft rapidly closed both began firing, but Jabs' twin 30\u00a0mm cannon took effect first, ripping open the Spitfire's drop tank and putting hits on the engine and wing. Flying past, the undamaged Spitfires regrouped and turned to make another attack. Jabs attempted to reach the cover of his airfield. As the Spitfires closed from behind, Jabs surprised them by turning back into them again. Both sides were firing as they closed. For a brief moment one of the Spitfires was caught by the heavy forward guns of the Bf 110. It was engulfed in fire and crashed to earth. Jabs' aircraft had also taken several hits, and was losing power in one of the engines. He made an abrupt hard landing, and with the aircraft still rolling he and the crew scrambled for cover while the airfield's Flak batteries attempted to drive off the attackers. Despite the fire from the field's defenses, the Spitfires strafed the Bf 110, setting it ablaze.", "After the war Jabs met a number of his former adversaries, including two from his encounter of 29 April 1944, Geoffrey Page and John Caulton. Jabs met Page in the 1950s at a gathering of former fighter pilots in Munich. The two discussed their encounter and formed a friendship. In the 1960s Kiwi native and former Pilot Officer John Caulton read a book Jabs had contributed to, and was intrigued as to whether this was the same man who had given him the note in Belgium. When his daughter traveled to the UK in 1970, he asked her to see if she could track Jabs down. She was successful, and in 1972 the two former adversaries met, and established a friendship. The friendship was long standing, with Caulton and Jabs meeting regularly every 3 to 4 years until Jabs' death in 2003."]}]}}
