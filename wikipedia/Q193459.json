He served as the songwriter, lead guitarist, and co-lead vocalist of the rock band Oasis. After leaving Oasis in 2009, he formed and became the lead vocalist, guitarist, and songwriter for Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds. Oasis had various line-up changes, though Gallagher and his brother Liam remained as the staple members.\nGallagher began playing guitar at the age of 12, and became a roadie and technician for Inspiral Carpets at the age of 21. He learned that Liam had formed a band called The Rain, which eventually became Oasis, and Liam invited him to join them as the lead guitarist. He agreed on condition that he would write their material. The band's debut album, Definitely Maybe (1994), was a critical and commercial success. Their second album, (What's the Story) Morning Glory? (1995), reached the top of the album charts in many countries, and their third studio album, Be Here Now (1997), became the fastest-selling album in UK chart history. Britpop eventually declined in popularity and Oasis failed to revive it, though their final two albums, Don't Believe the Truth (2005) and Dig Out Your Soul (2008), were hailed as their best efforts in over a decade. In August 2009, following an altercation with Liam, Noel announced his departure from Oasis. Gallagher would go on to form Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds, with whom he has released three studio albums.\nOasis' time was marked by turbulence, especially during the peak of Britpop, during which Noel was involved in several disputes with Liam and their fights and wild lifestyles regularly made tabloid headlines. The band notably had a rivalry with fellow Britpop band Blur. Noel himself was often regarded as a pioneer and spearhead of the Britpop movement. Many have praised his songwriting, with Beatles producer George Martin calling him \"the finest songwriter of his generation\". Conversely, he was voted the most overrated guitarist of the last millennium in a 1999 poll, and the ninth most overrated ever in a 2002 listener survey. He cited the former as the award he most enjoyed receiving.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Eden Project", "response": ["Since 2002, the Project has hosted a series of musical performances, called the Eden Sessions.

Gallagher told them how much he liked Exit Planet Dust, and asked if he could sing on a future track, similar to the way Tim Burgess had worked on \"Life Is Sweet\". They did not think much of the offer at the time, given how busy Gallagher would be with the release of Oasis' (What's the Story) Morning Glory?, plus the complexities of dealing with each other's record companies. However, the duo later worked on a track which they thought would benefit from having a vocal on it. They sent Gallagher a tape of what they had done so far. He worked on it overnight, and left a message with them early the next morning that he was ready to record it. The track was called \"Setting Sun\" and was finally released in October 1996. It entered the UK charts at the top, giving the duo their first ever Number One single. \"Setting Sun\" was backed by a longer instrumental version, and also a new track \"Buzz Tracks\", which was not much more than a DJ tool.

The Madchester scene, fronted by the Stone Roses, Happy Mondays and Inspiral Carpets (for whom Oasis's Noel Gallagher had worked as a roadie during the Madchester years), was an immediate root of Britpop since its emphasis on good times and catchy songs provided an alternative to the British-based shoegazing and American based grunge styles of music. Pre-dating Britpop by four years, Liverpool-based group the La's hit single \"There She Goes\" was described by Rolling Stone as a \"founding piece of Britpop's foundation\".", "Local identity and regional British accents are common to Britpop groups, as well as references to British places and culture in lyrics and image. Stylistically, Britpop bands use catchy hooks and lyrics that were relevant to young British people of their own generation. Britpop bands conversely denounced grunge as irrelevant and having nothing to say about their lives. In contrast to the dourness of grunge, Britpop was defined by \"youthful exuberance and desire for recognition\". Damon Albarn of Blur summed up the attitude in 1993 when after being asked if Blur were an \"anti-grunge band\" he said, \"Well, that's good. If punk was about getting rid of hippies, then I'm getting rid of grunge.\" In spite of the professed disdain for the genres, some elements of both crept into the more enduring facets of Britpop. Noel Gallagher has since championed Ride and once stated that Nirvana's Kurt Cobain was the only songwriter he had respect for in the last ten years, and that he felt their music was similar enough that Cobain could have written \"Wonderwall\". By 1996, Oasis's prominence was such that NME termed a number of Britpop bands (including the Boo Radleys, Ocean Colour Scene and Cast) \"Noelrock\", citing Gallagher's influence on their music.Kessler, Ted. \"Noelrock!\" NME. 8 June 1996.

In what was the best week for UK singles sales in a decade, on 20 August, Blur's \"Country House\" sold 274,000 copies against \"Roll with It\" by Oasis which sold 216,000, the songs charting at number one and number two, respectively.Harris, pg. 235. Blur performed their chart topping single on the BBC's Top of the Pops, with the band's bassist Alex James wearing an 'Oasis' t-shirt. However, in the long run Oasis became more commercially successful than Blur, at home and abroad. In a 2019 interview, Oasis bandleader Noel Gallagher reflected on the chart battle between the two songs, both of which he saw as \"shit\", and suggested that a chart race between Oasis' \"Cigarettes & Alcohol\" and Blur's \"Girls & Boys\" would have had greater merit.

The first new member to be announced was new lead/rhythm guitarist Colin \"Gem\" Archer, formerly of Heavy Stereo, who later claimed to have been approached by Noel Gallagher only a couple of days after Arthurs' departure was publicly announced. Finding a replacement bassist took more time and effort: the band were rehearsing with David Potts, but he quickly resigned, and they brought in Andy Bell, former guitarist/songwriter of Ride and Hurricane#1 as their new bassist. Bell had never played bass before and had to learn to play it (with Noel since saying, \"I was amazed that Andy was up for actually playing the bass y\u2019know, cos he\u2019s such a good guitarist\"), along with a handful of songs from Oasis' back catalogue, in preparation for a scheduled US tour in December 1999.", "In May 2008, Zak Starkey left the band after recording Dig Out Your Soul, the band's seventh studio album.

The first was the case of Neil Innes (formerly of the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band and the Rutles) suing to prove the Oasis song \"Whatever\" borrowed from his song \"How Sweet to Be an Idiot\". Innes was eventually awarded royalties and a co-writer credit. Noel Gallagher claimed in 2010 that the plagiarism was unintentional and he was unaware of the similarities until informed of Innes's legal case. In the second incident, Oasis were sued by Coca-Cola and forced to pay $500,000 in damages to the New Seekers after it was alleged that the Oasis song  \"Shakermaker\" had lifted words and melody from \"I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing\". When asked about the incident, Noel Gallagher joked \"Now we all drink Pepsi.\" On the third and final occasion, when promotional copies of (What's the Story) Morning Glory? were originally distributed, they contained a previously unreleased bonus song called \"Step Out\". This promotional CD was quickly withdrawn and replaced with a version that omitted the controversial song, which was allegedly similar to the Stevie Wonder song \"Uptight (Everything's Alright)\".
