He added to his squad with youngsters Ian Osborne and Kevin Kennerley, and experienced midfielder Geoff Davies. After Cullerton suffered a cartilage injury he signed Ken Beamish for a \u00a312,000 fee from Blackburn Rovers, as well as former Wigan Athletic forward John Rogers for 'a small fee'. His team struggled with poor discipline \u2013 Rotherham manager Jimmy McGuigan claimed Vale were 'the worst exhibition of football thuggery I have ever seen'. Midway through the season Sproson sold two more key players: striker Ray Williams went into non-league football for 'a small fee' and midfielder Colin Tartt joined Chesterfield for \u00a315,000. Sproson brought in Alan Lamb from Preston North End and Peter Sutcliffe from Stockport County for a combined outlay of \u00a38,000. Ultimately though, the loss of star midfielder Brian Horton to Brighton for \u00a330,000 in March 1976 was something Sproson proved unable to remedy. Nevertheless, relegation was narrowly avoided at the end of 1976\u201377, as his side finished nineteenth, three points above the drop."]}, {"page": "The Whitby High School", "response": ["* Kevin Kennerley, footballer"]}, {"page": "History of Port Vale F.C.", "response": ["The small squad barely changed for 1976\u201377; Kevin Kennerley and Ian Osborne replacing an outgoing Geoff Morris.

Terry Lees was sold to Sparta Rotterdam for \u00a325,000. \u00a312,000 of this money was spent on striker Ken Beamish. Former England international Bobby Thomson was also brought in and quickly made captain. The club continued in their physical footballing ways, opposition manager Jimmy McGuigan describing it as 'the worst example of football thuggery I have ever seen' and Burnley captain Peter Noble calling Vale 'a bunch of kickers'. In the FA Cup they lost at the Fifth Round to a crowd of nearly 50,000 at Villa Park.
