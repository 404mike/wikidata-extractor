Young academy graduate hooker Joe Lumb signed a 1-year deal with local League 1 side Keighley Cougars after not featuring much during 2017. Further departures were announced as winger Johnny Campbell resigned with his old club Batley Bulldogs. While fellow winger Omari Caro announced on social media that he had retired from the sport. Second row forward Colton Roche joined the mini exodus as he signed for Huddersfield Giants of the Super League. Some good news followed the exodus as it was revealed that highly rated academy prospects Reiss Butterworth, Evan Hodgson and Oliver Wilson all signed new 3-year contracts with the Bulls. Hodgson and Butterworth have both featured in the first team during the 2017 season, however Wilson is yet to make his debut. In a shock move, Bradford managed to acquire the services of current superstar halfback Dane Chisholm for another 2 season despite interest from several other clubs. Meanwhile, prop forward Ross Peltier put pen to paper on a new 2-year deal and young halfback Joe Keyes also signed up for another 2 years. Hooker Vila Halafihi became the 9th player to re-sign with the Bulls after agreeing a new 2-year deal to stay at Odsal. Following this, hooker Scott Moore was released after declining to sign a new contract. Lifelong Bulls fan and loose forward Elliot Minchella became the first new signing of the 2018 season as he signed a 2-year part-time deal from RFL Championship side Sheffield Eagles.
