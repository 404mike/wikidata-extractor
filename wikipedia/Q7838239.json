With the support of Sir Trenchard Cox of the Victoria and Albert Museum, O'Donnell established and designed a course for those wishing to work in museums, as auctioneers, art students, or those who owned or ran country houses. The course was convened in the V&A's galleries and lecture hall, and O'Donnell recruited from the Courtauld Institute and the museum to lecture. It was colloquially known as the \"V. & A. course\". From these informal roots, O'Donnell founded the Study Centre for the History of the Fine and Decorative Arts in 1964. The course received far more applications than places, and the demand led to other universities establishing their own, similar courses. Helena Hayward later ran the course with her, and with Hayward and Harriet Bridgeman she published books on fine art. Some of the graduates from the course during O'Donnell's tenure included Giles Waterfield and Timothy Schroder."]}, {"page": "The Conway Photographic Library", "response": ["# Trenchard Cox"]}]}}
