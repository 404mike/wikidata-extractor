He had already acted in school plays in Latin and had also appeared in more recent works with his mother and sister and other amateur actors at Adlestrop House. In May 1788 he and Wattell had played together as Mentevole and Julia in an amateur performance of Julia by Robert Jephson, at Freemasons' Hall, London,  and in September of that year they eloped and were married at Gretna Green in Scotland, going through a more regular wedding ceremony after at St. Marylebone Church in London on 4 November 1788.London, England, Church of England Marriages and Banns, 1754-1932 for Charlotte Ann Frances Wattell: Westminster, St Marylebone, 1787-1794 - Ancestry.com  The newspapers at the time reported on the marriage of the second son of a lord to a minor provincial heiress, and this interest only increased when the couple continued acting in amateur dramatics, before turning professional. They performed together at Adlestrop House and elsewhere for a year or so, attracting public attention. If reports from the time are true, the couple were under no financial necessity to act as Charlotte Wattell had a considerable fortune, as recorded in one newspaper on 8 October 1788: \"Mr Twistleton, by his marriage with Miss Wattle, has got possession of an amiable little girl, that must make any man the happiest of Triflers: -- the lady's age is about eighteen and her fortune about \u00a34,000\".The Gentleman's Magazine. 1825. pp. 275\u2013.
