Aricia is the last of the Pallantids, and as such is held captive by Theseus and has been sentenced to take a vow of chastity to Diana. Before she does so, she and Hippolytus reveal mutual love to each other and, defying the will of Phaedra, the priestesses of Diana proclaim that it is unlawful to force her to dedicate her heart to the goddess when it already belongs to another. Phaedra, incensed by the disobedience of the priestesses, threatens to destroy the temple. The high priestess appeals to the gods, and the goddess Diana descends and rebukes Phaedra, forcing her to leave the temple. Phaedra leaves with her only confidant, Oenone, and vents her frustration at the situation. Phaedra, Theseus second wife, has been nursing an illicit desire for her stepson. Arcas brings news that Theseus has made a journey to the Underworld and is likely dead.
