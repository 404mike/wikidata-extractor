Leitch-Smith doubled Crewe's advantage almost instantly, running on to a neat Chuks Aneke pass before finishing calmly with a low driven shot. Luke Freeman halved Stevenage's deficit midway through the first-half when he unleashed a shot from 25-yards, following good work from Patrick Agyemang and Lucas Akins, which left Crewe goalkeeper Alan Martin rooted to the spot. Former Stevenage loanee, Aneke, was sent-off for Crewe in the second half for a two-footed tackle on Anthony Grant.
