George Shenton Jnr was educated locally until 1855, when at the age of 13 he was sent to England to complete his education at the Wesleyan Collegiate Institute (Queen's College) in Taunton.  In 1858 he returned to Perth, where he received experience working in a range of his father's businesses, including running his father's store in Geraldton, and managing the family's farm on the Greenough River", "On 5 March 1867, George Shenton Snr drowned when his schooner, The Lass of Geraldton, capsized off Mandurah in a storm.  George Shenton Jnr then took over his father's businesses.  The Shenton family's businesses continued to prosper over the next thirty years, but as George Shenton became more involved in politics he had less time to invest in his business activities.  From 1884, his youngest brother Ernest gradually took over the running of the Perth store, and another brother, Edward, took the Geraldon business as his inheritance.  This left George with responsibility for the shipping business that his father had established.", "George Shenton also invested profitably in gold mining.  He was a member of the syndicate that financed Leslie Menzie's 1894 prospecting expedition that resulted in the discovery of the Menzies gold field.  The first lease became the famous Lady Shenton mine, which yielded over 130000 ounces of gold and paid out over \u00a3150000 in dividends.  Shenton later became a shareholder and director of the Gold Estates Mining Company.", "In 1886, Shenton appointed H. F. Payne to manage his shipping agency.  As he became increasingly involved in politics, his involvement in his shipping business decreased, and he came to rely more and more heavily on Payne.  In 1903 he merged his company with the South Australian company Elder Smiths, to form a new company under the name Elder Shenton and Co. Ltd.  This company survives today as the well-known Australian rural services provider Elders Limited.  George Shenton became a principal shareholder and Chairman of Directors of the new company, but was largely uninvolved in the day-to-day running of the firm.", "Western Australia gained representative government in 1870, and in October of that year the first Western Australian Legislative Council elections were held.  On 12 October 1870, George Shenton was elected unopposed to the seat of Greenough. The main political issue of the day was that of free trade versus protection. In accordance with the wishes of his constituents, Shenton took a protectionist stance, helping to push for an import duty on flour. This was opposed by the governor, Sir Frederick Weld, and when the Legislative Council successfully moved an amendment on the matter, Weld responded by dissolving the Council in March 1872. Shenton was then re-elected for Greenough, comfortably defeating his opponent, Geraldton merchant Henry Gray.", "George Shenton is honoured by the Perth suburb Shenton Park.  His home, named Crawley Park by a previous owner, was situated on a  site much of which is now the site of the University of Western Australia.  The suburb Crawley is named after Shenton's land.  The Crawley Park homestead in which Shenton lived, now known as Shenton House, still stands in the University Grounds, and is managed by the National Trust of Australia.", "* George Shenton at Australian Dictionary of Biography, Online Edition"]}, {"page": "Shino", "response": ["*George Shenton (footballer) (1899\u20131978), English footballer nicknamed Shino"]}, {"page": "Shino Shenton", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Shenton (footballer)"]}, {"page": "Jimmy Oakes", "response": ["He managed a rare feat in scoring from his own half in a 2\u20131 defeat to Stockport County at The Old Recreation Ground on Christmas Day 1929, albeit with help from the wind.

He featured 32 times in 1931\u201332, helping Vale to avoid relegation only due to their superior goal average to Barnsley.
