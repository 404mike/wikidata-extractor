He was a major promoter and collector of modern art and an associate of the surrealists in the United Kingdom.

The film-maker Geoffrey Barkas ran the Middle East Command Camouflage Directorate during the 1941\u20131942 war in the Western Desert, including the successful deception of Operation Bertram. Hugh Cott was chief instructor; the artist camouflage officers, who called themselves camoufleurs, included Steven Sykes and Tony Ayrton. In Australia, artists were also prominent in the Sydney Camouflage Group, formed under the chairmanship of Professor William John Dakin, a zoologist from Sydney University. Max Dupain, Sydney Ure Smith, and William Dobell were among the members of the group, which worked at Bankstown Airport, RAAF Base Richmond and Garden Island Dockyard. In the United States, artists like John Vassos took a certificate course in military and industrial camouflage at the American School of Design with Baron Nicholas Cerkasoff, and went on to create camouflage for the Air Force."]}, {"page": "Roger Penrose", "response": ["Born in Colchester, Essex, Roger Penrose is a son of Margaret (Leathes) and psychiatrist and geneticist Lionel Penrose.

Sussex also became a major centre for surrealism in the early 20th century.  At West Dean, Edward James was patron to artists including Salvador Dal\u00ed and Ren\u00e9 Magritte while at Farley Farm House near Chiddingly the home of Roland Penrose and Lee Miller was frequented by artists such as Pablo Picasso, Man Ray, Henry Moore, Eileen Agar, Jean Dubuffet, Dorothea Tanning and Max Ernst.  Both collections form one of the most important bodies of Surrealist art in Europe."]}, {"page": "Lee Miller", "response": ["By 1937, Miller had grown bored with her life in Cairo. She returned to Paris, where she met the British surrealist painter and curator Roland Penrose. Four of her photographs (\"Egypt\" (1939), \"Roumania\" (1938), \"Libya\" (1939), and \"Sinai\" (1939)) were displayed at the 1940 exhibition Surrealism To-Day at the Zwemmer Gallery in London. More of her work was included in the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) exhibition Britain at War in New York City in 1941. Her photographs would not be included in another exhibition until 1955, when she was included in the renowned The Family of Man exhibition curated by Edward Steichen, director of the MoMA Department of Photography.", "In 2015, an exhibition of Miller's photographs at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, Lee Miller and Picasso, focussed \"on the relationship between Lee Miller, Roland Penrose and Pablo Picasso.\" In the same year, a work of historical fiction, The Woman in the Photograph, by Dana Gynther, was published. It builds its story around Miller's affair with Ray in Paris circa 1930."]}, {"page": "Peggy Guggenheim", "response": ["Her first gallery was called Guggenheim Jeune, the name ingeniously chosen to associate her gallery with both the epitome of a gallery, the French Bernheim-Jeune, and with the name of her own well-known family. The gallery on 30 Cork Street, next to Roland Penrose's and E. L. T. Mesens' show-case for the Surrealist movement, proved to be successful, thanks to many friends who gave advice and who helped to run the gallery. Marcel Duchamp, whom she had known since the early 1920s, when she lived in Paris with her first husband Laurence Vail, had introduced Guggenheim to the art world; it was through him that she met many artists during her frequent visits to Paris. He taught her about contemporary art and styles, and he conceived several of the exhibitions held at Guggenheim Jeune.", "According to both Guggenheim and her biographer Anton Gill, it was believed that while living in Europe, she had \"slept with 1,000 men\".\"Thomas Messer\", Telegraph obituary, 23 May 2013 She claimed to have had affairs with numerous artists and writers, and in return many artists and others have claimed affairs with her. When asked by conductor Thomas Schippers how many husbands she had, she replied, \"You mean my own, or other people's?\" In her autobiography, Peggy provides the names of some of these lovers, including Yves Tanguy, Roland Penrose and E. L. T. Mesens."]}, {"page": "Francis Bacon (artist)", "response": ["In the winter of 1935\u201336, Roland Penrose and Herbert Read, making a first selection for the International Surrealist Exhibition, visited his studio at 71 Royal Hospital Road, Chelsea saw \"three or four large canvases including one with a grandfather clock\", but found his work \"insufficiently surreal to be included in the show\". Bacon claimed Penrose told him \"Mr. Bacon, don't you realise a lot has happened in painting since the Impressionists?\" In 1936 or 1937 Bacon moved from 71 Royal Hospital Road to the top floor of 1 Glebe Place, Chelsea, which Eric Hall had rented. The following year, Patrick White moved to the top two floors of the building where De Maistre had his studio, on Eccleston Street and commissioned from Bacon, by now a friend, a writing desk (with wide drawers and a red linoleum top). Expressing one of his basic concerns from the late 1930s, Bacon said that his artistic career was delayed because he spent too long looking for subject matter that could sustain his interest."]}, {"page": "Queens' College, Cambridge", "response": ["|Sir Roland Penrose"]}, {"page": "British Surrealist Group", "response": ["* Roland Penrose (1900\u20131984) "]}]}}
