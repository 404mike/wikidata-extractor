This locomotive was L&YR 1008 and is now preserved at the National Railway Museum. By 1899 a further 677 locomotives had been built, and another 220 under Henry Hoy. Between 1891 and 1900, 230 0-6-0 tender engines designed by Barton Wright were rebuilt as 0-6-0ST saddle tanks, LYR Class F16."]}, {"page": "L&YR Class 5", "response": ["In 1903 the incumbent CME Henry Hoy reported that the now 270 strong class had between them covered  in the preceding 14 years all over the L&YR system.

Aspinall then ordered more locomotives of a modified design: the wheelbase was shortened to , the tank was extended over the smokebox, the cab was enlarged,  and the boiler pressure raised to . Seventeen of this modified design were ordered from Horwich Works in three batches; Aspinall's successor Henry Hoy order another batch of 10; and Hoy's successor George Hughes ordered 30 more in two batches."]}, {"page": "L&YR Class 27", "response": ["Class 27 locomotives were designed by John Aspinall and 484 were built between 1889 - 1918 at Horwich Works. It was the standard goods engine used by the Lancashire & Yorkshire Railway. Aspinall opted for a two-cylinder format with a non superheated round top boiler. David Joy's configuration of valve gear was employed. By the time Aspinall became general manager of the L&YR on 1 July 1899 more than 400 of the simple but powerful engines had been built. More were built under his successors, Henry Hoy and George Hughes, albeit with some modifications. By 1918 there were the 484 locomotives in the class."]}, {"page": "Launch-type boiler", "response": ["The Lancashire & Yorkshire Railway suffered problems with firebox stays, leading to a boiler explosion with an 0-8-0 'Class 30' near Knottingley in 1901 Their Chief Mechanical Engineer Henry Hoy, sought to avoid the problems of the stayed firebox altogether and so developed an alternative boiler and firebox. This used a corrugated tubular furnace and cylindrical outer firebox, as for the Lentz. Such corrugated furnaces were already in widespread use locally, with the Lancashire and Galloway stationary boilers of the Lancashire cotton mills and local makers already had several designs available. The furnace was also of steel, rather than the copper used for fireboxes at this time. Hoy's involvement was ironic, as a major cause of the original accident had been Hoy's invention of a new brass alloy for firebox stays, an inelastic alloy that turned out to have serious drawbacks. One Class 30, 396, was rebuilt in 1903 and 20 more were built new with this boiler."]}, {"page": "L&YR Class 30", "response": ["Twenty of the class, built in 1903, were fitted with Henry Hoy's corrugated cylindrical steel firebox. This was not a great success (the internal flue deformed under steam pressure and water circulation was poor) and they were later rebuilt with conventional boilers between 1911 and 1914. Crews referred to them as \"Sea Pigs\" which infers they were not well liked.  Barry C.
