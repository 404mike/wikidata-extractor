Several generations of ethnologists were inspired by his pseudo-evolutionary theory of archaic matriarchy. Following him and Jane Ellen Harrison, several generations of scholars, usually arguing from known myths or oral traditions and examination of Neolithic female cult-figures, suggested that many ancient societies might have been matriarchal, or even that there existed a wide-ranging matriarchal society prior to the ancient cultures of which we are aware. According to Uwe Wesel, Bachofen's myth interpretations have proved to be untenable.Wesel, Uwe, Der Mythos vom Matriarchat. \u00dcber Bachofens Mutterrecht und die Stellung von Frauen in fr\u00fchen Gesellschaften (Frankfurt/M.: Suhrkamp, 1980). The concept was further investigated by Lewis Morgan.Morgan, L., Ancient Society Or Researches in the Lines of Human Progress from Savagery through Barbarism to Civilization. Many researchers studied the phenomenon of matriarchy afterward, but the basis was laid by the classics of sociology. The notion of a \"woman-centered\" society was developed by Bachofen, whose three-volume Myth, Religion, and Mother Right (1861) impacted the way classicists such as Harrison, Arthur Evans, Walter Burkert, and James MellaartRuether, Rosemary Radford, Goddesses and the Divine Feminine: A Western Religious History, p.\u00a015. looked at the evidence of matriarchal religion in pre-Hellenic societies.Bachofen, Johann Jakob, Myth, Religion, and Mother Right.
