Foulis is said to have heard his daughter playing the piano in the distance on a foggy night, and noticed the low notes were more audible than the higher notes: he then designed a device to produce a low-frequency sound, as well as a code system for use with it. Foulis repeatedly presented his concept to the Commissioners of Light Houses for the Bay of Fundy for installation on Partridge Island. While the Commissioners initially rejected Foulis's plan, one commissioner eventually encouraged Foulis to submit detailed plans to the Commission.  For reasons unknown, the plans were given to another Canadian engineer, T. T. Vernon Smith, who officially submitted them to the Commissioners as his own. The foghorn was constructed at Partridge Island in 1859 as the Vernon-Smith horn.  After protest by Foulis and a legislative inquiry, Foulis was credited as the true inventor, but he never patented or profited from his invention.Famous Glaswegians - Robert Foulis, JR, accessed 05-09-08 "]}, {"page": "Robert Foulis", "response": ["Robert Foulis may refer to:", "*Robert Foulis (printer) (1707\u20131776), Scottish printer and publisher", "*Robert Foulis (inventor) (1796\u20131866), Canadian inventor"]}, {"page": "List of Canadian inventions and discoveries", "response": ["* Steam-powered foghorn \u2014 invented by Robert Foulis (1859)."]}, {"page": "History of lighthouses in Canada", "response": ["In 1791 the first lighthouse was built at the entrance to Saint John on Partridge Island, New Brunswick.

In 1859, Partridge Island also became known as the site of the first successful demonstration of an automated steam-powered foghorn, invented by the Scotsman Robert Foulis who had settled in the city.

During this time he patented the first automated steam-powered foghorn, which has since been adopted in Canada as well as on the English Coasts and elsewhere.
