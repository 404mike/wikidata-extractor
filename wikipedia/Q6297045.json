She died in 1963 in tragic circumstances..\nShe was taught oboe by L\u00e9on Goossens and attended the Royal College of Music from 1929 to 1937 at which, for a short while before her death, she was a Professor of Oboe. She helped establish Benjamin Britten's English Opera Group, being a member of its orchestra in the late 1940s and 1950s. In 1951 Britten dedicated his Six Metamorphoses after Ovid to Joy, which she premiered at the Aldeburgh Festival on 14 June that year. Together with John Francis (flute) and Millicent Silver (piano) she became part of The Sylvan Trio.\nIn 1937, Joy gave the first performance of the Oboe Concerto written specially for her by Rutland Boughton at a concert in Oxford with the Boyd Neel String Orchestra. She was married to the theatre impresario Christopher Ede and they had two children, Robin and Penny. A concert in her memory was held at the RCM in April 1963.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of oboists", "response": ["* Joy Boughton (1913\u20131963), English"]}, {"page": "L\u00e9on Goossens", "response": ["Goossens commissioned a number of works for the oboe from such distinguished composers as Sir Edward Elgar, Ralph Vaughan Williams and Rutland Boughton and collaborated extensively with other prominent soloists such as Yehudi Menuhin.

These include his 2nd and 3rd symphonies (the latter was first performed at the London Kingsway Theatre in 1939 in the presence of, among others, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Clarence Raybould and Alan Bush), a number of pieces for oboe (including two concertos, one dedicated to his talented daughter Joy Boughton and the other to L\u00e9on Goossens), chamber music and a number of orchestral pieces. In 1934 and 1935, Boughton attempted to repeat his earlier successes at Glastonbury with festivals commissioned at Stroud and Bath, and these saw the release of new works, The Lily Maid (the third opera in the Arthurian Cycle) and The Ever Young. Boughton's reputation was, however, affected by his political leanings towards Communism, and his music was subsequently neglected for the next forty years. In 1956 Boughton left the Communist Party of Great Britain, although he remained a committed socialist for the remained of his life. Boughton died at the home of his daughter, Joy, in Barnes, London, in 1960."]}, {"page": "Six Metamorphoses after Ovid", "response": ["The piece was inspired by Ovid's Metamorphoses.
