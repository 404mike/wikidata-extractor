He was then promoted to captain in 1796 and from around 1799 served on board the ship of the line HMS Sans Pareil. He was made lieutenant-governor of Curacoa Island, that island having recently been captured by the forces of Vice-Admiral Lord Hugh Seymour of which Tremenheere was a part of, on 17 October 1800. Tremenheere served as co-governor of the island with the previous Dutch occupant of that position. As neither man was senior to the other there was often great confusion in the giving of orders and in the control of the island. To further difficulties, Seymour quarrelled with the army's Major-General Sir Thomas Trigge over who Tremenheere owed subordination to, he being an anomalous Royal Marine. Trigge attempted to replace him as lieutenant-governor with Lieutenant-Colonel William Carlyon Hughes, but Tremenheere refused to give up his position to him. Under orders from Seymour he focused his time on the island on attempting to install a sense of Britishness on the foreign population, it being expected that the islands would stay under their control. In 1801 Seymour died, giving the upper hand to Trigge who finally succeeded in installing Hughes and removing Tremenheere in 1802.

In March 1798 Gosselin and Syren convoyed a large fleet of merchant ships to the Leeward Islands and Jamaica, including Major-General Henry Bowyer and his staff, for which service the masters of the merchant ships presented Gosselin with a valuable sword. Gosselin stayed with Syren on the Leeward Islands Station and on 20 August 1799 took part in the successful occupation of Surinam by the forces of Vice-Admiral Lord Hugh Seymour and Lieutenant-General Thomas Trigge.
