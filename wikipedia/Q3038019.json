Debus", "response": ["Debus studied chemical engineering and history, graduating with a major in chemistry in the summer of 1947 from Northwestern University. He pursued his master's degree at Indiana University Bloomington where he had followed John J. Murray. In June 1949 he presented his master's thesis Robert Boyle and Chemistry in England 1660-1700 under John J. Murray. Subsequently, he worked towards a master's in chemistry at the same institution. He went to work for Abbott Laboratories, a company for which he filed five patents. He wrote that slow reaction times for some of his work provided reading time for broader investigations in history of science and chemistry literature. In fall 1956 he began his Ph.D. studies at Harvard University under I. Bernard Cohen. His teaching assistant work was supervised by Leonard K. Nash. In a seminar with W. K. Jordan he presented a paper on the English followers of Paracelsus which received the Bowdoin Prize in the Natural Sciences, the first of two from his years at Harvard. In September 1959 he went to London, England to delve more deeply into the topic. There he met regularly with Walter Pagel and attended University College of London courses given by Douglas McKie. Returning to Harvard, he completed the requirements for a Harvard Ph.D. in history of science in 1961.Directory of American Scholars, 6th ed.

They decided that aside from the Belgian Isis, there were few outlets for such work, and so founded the Annals of Science with Douglas McKie (University College London), who was the main editor. The aim was to publish faster than Isis and with a focus on the modern period. The editors chose to have a bright orange cover to make it stand out against the usual blue or grey of periodicals at the time."]}, {"page": "Society for the History of Alchemy and Chemistry", "response": ["The Society was first established in November 1935 by J.R.

In 1982 he retired.", "Smeaton worked with Douglas McKie and  and amassed an important book collection in his research area. His research focus was French history of chemistry in the 18th and 19th centuries, in particular chemists of the French Revolution. These included Antoine Lavoisier, Fourcroy, Guyton de Morveau and the Dijon Academy). Smeaton's work on Fourcroy was considered the standard work on that scientist. He wrote a number of biographies in the Dictionary of Scientific Biography. "]}]}}
