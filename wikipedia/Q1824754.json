She sat for more of his finished works than any other of his more well-known muses, including Elizabeth Siddall, Jane Morris and Fanny Cornforth.Comparatively little is known about Wilding, while Rossetti's other models, Siddall, Morris and Cornforth, are frequently written about. This is perhaps partly due to the lack of any romantic or sexual connection between the pair, which differentiates Rossetti's relationship with Wilding from those with his other muses.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Holy Grail", "response": ["The combination of hushed reverence, chromatic harmonies and sexualized imagery in Richard Wagner's final music drama Parsifal, premiered in 1882, developed this theme, associating the grail \u2013 now periodically producing blood \u2013 directly with female fertility.Donington, Robert (1963).

He spotted her one evening in the Strand in 1865 and was immediately struck by her beauty. She agreed to sit for him the following day, but failed to arrive. He spotted her again weeks later, jumped from the cab he was in and persuaded her to go straight to his studio. He paid her a weekly fee to sit for him exclusively, afraid that other artists might employ her.Dunn, Recollections of Dante Gabriel Rossetti and his circle, ed. Mander, (1984) p. 46. They shared a lasting bond; after Rossetti's death Wilding was said to have travelled regularly to place a wreath on his grave.Spencer-Longhurst, The Blue Bower: Rossetti in the 1860s (2006).", "The savage reaction of critics to Rossetti's first collection of poetry contributed to a mental breakdown in June 1872, and although he joined Jane Morris at Kelmscott that September, he \"spent his days in a haze of chloral and whisky\".Todd (2001), pp. 128\u2013129. The next summer he was much improved, and both Alexa Wilding and Jane sat for him at Kelmscott, where he created a soulful series of dream-like portraits. In 1874, Morris reorganised his decorative arts firm, cutting Rossetti out of the business, and the polite fiction that both men were in residence with Jane at Kelmscott could not be maintained. Rossetti abruptly left Kelmscott in July 1874 and never returned. Toward the end of his life, he sank into a morbid state, darkened by his drug addiction to chloral hydrate and increasing mental instability. He spent his last years as a recluse at Cheyne Walk.", "File:Dante Gabriel Rossetti The Blessed Damozel.jpg|The Blessed Damozel (1871\u20131878; model: Alexa Wilding)", "File:Lady-Lilith.jpg|Lady Lilith (1868), Delaware Art Museum (Fanny Cornforth, overpainted at Kelsmcott 1872\u201373 with the face of Alexa Wilding)", "Image:Dante Gabriel Rossetti - La viuda romana (D\u00ees Manibus).jpg|Roman Widow (1874: model:Alexa Wilding), Museo de Arte de Ponce, Ponce, Puerto Rico"]}, {"page": "Fanny Cornforth", "response": ["Rossetti substitutedSpencer-Longhurst, Paul The Blue Bower: Rossetti in the 1860s (2006) the features of another model, Alexa Wilding for Fanny Cornforth in Lady Lilith (1864\u20131868)."]}]}}
