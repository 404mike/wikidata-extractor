As project architect in charge, he took the scheme from the initial competition bid through to completion. Opened in December 1999 by HM the Queen the campus has since been awarded the RIBA Sustainability Award 2001.\nBefore Nottingham he developed the environmental strategy and detailed fa\u00e7ade design for Portcullis House. This work followed 4 years of research in the European Union funded Joule Research Project, collaborating with the leading environmental consultants in Europe, including Arup, CSTB Nantes, Christian Bartenbach and Conphoebus.\nIn 1995 he built his own house, Hope House which is a prototype low energy live/work unit in which he and his family now live. Dunster was educated at Edinburgh University and is an honorary graduate of Oxford Brookes University.[2] He has taught at the Architectural Association, Kingston University and Harvard University. He has also taught at the EPFL (Switzerland), and currently lectures at University of Westminster and UCL.\nHe founded the architecture practice Zedfactory in 1999 . Zedfactory specialise in the field of zero-carbon design and development. Zedfactory's most notable project is bedZED, winner of 2003 Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) Sustainability Award,[3] and shortlisted for the 2003 Stirling Prize.\nIn 2009 Zedfactory won the UK Green Building Council 'Sustainable Development of the Year Award' for projects under \u00a32million,[4] for their RuralZED development in Upton Square, Northampton. This project was also the first commercially available housing development awarded the Code for Sustainable Homes, Level 6.[5]", "link_mentions": [{"page": "London Borough of Sutton", "response": ["The acclaimed BedZED (Beddington Zero Energy Development) housing complex is located on London Road, SM6, about 500 yards north of Hackbridge mainline railway station.
