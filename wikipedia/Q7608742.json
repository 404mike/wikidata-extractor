Stephen Booth bowled the first ball of the season's last over and Bore scored a boundary.  The second ball went to the ropes again, and the third went for two runs.  Nottinghamshire needed four more runs from three balls to complete a remarkable win. Bore blocked the fourth ball and Andy Pick, Nottinghamshire's number 11, walked down the pitch to ask \"What did you do that for?\" \"It wasn't in the right place.\" Bore replied. The next delivery saw Bore launch a blow towards the stands.  The crowd and the entire Nottingham team were on their feet and Bore thought, as soon as he'd hit it, \"That's it, we've won\". However Somerset's Richard Ollis ran in and caught the ball above his head, just ten feet from the boundary.  Nottinghamshire had lost by three runs and Bore's innings had been in vain.  As Bore related in an interview with Simon Lister \"We were stunned. We got in the car and I don't think we spoke a word until we were well past Gloucester. No matter how many times I lie in bed and replay that ball I never score those four runs\"."]}, {"page": "Boston Spa Academy", "response": ["* Stephen Booth, cricketer"]}, {"page": "Steven C.
