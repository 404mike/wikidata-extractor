He is well known for his portrayal of the fourth incarnation of the Doctor in the science fiction television series Doctor Who from 1974 to 1981, a longer tenure than any other actor in the title role. He also provided narration in the television comedy series Little Britain (2003\u20132006) and Little Britain USA (2008). His voice, which has been described as \"sonorous\", was voted the fourth-most recognisable in the UK in 2006.At age 15, Baker began study as a religious brother. He gradually lost his vocation, leaving religious life at age 21 to undertake national service in the Royal Army Medical Corps. Upon leaving the army, he served in the Merchant Navy and then became an actor, joining the Royal National Theatre under Laurence Olivier. He was in his thirties when his professional acting career began, and his first major film role was as Grigori Rasputin in Nicholas and Alexandra in 1971, when he was 37. He went on to play the villainous Prince Koura in The Golden Voyage of Sinbad in 1973, which led to his casting in Doctor Who.\nDuring his period as the star of Doctor Who, the original series received its highest viewing figures. His era featured many stories which became regarded as classics and he remains one of the most instantly recognisable incarnations of the character. He continued to feature in regular television roles later in his career, including in the series Medics (1992\u20131995), Randall & Hopkirk (Deceased) (2000\u20132001) and Monarch of the Glen (2004\u20132005). He has also narrated commercials, video games, audiobooks, radio plays, music albums, and television series.\nBaker has been married three times, firstly to Anna Wheatcroft with whom he had two sons, the second time being to his Doctor Who co-star Lalla Ward.
