The president of the Grenada Football Association, Cheney Joseph, adopted The Shrews as his team, stating \"I have fallen in love with Shrewsbury. I\u2019m serious. I believe they can become a dream story, a Cinderella story\". In November 2019, Joseph sent a partnership offer to the club, as well as a formal invitation for Town chairman Roland Wycherley to visit the country. On 9 November, Oliver Norburn became the third Town player to be called up by Grenada, whom he qualified for through his paternal grandfather.
