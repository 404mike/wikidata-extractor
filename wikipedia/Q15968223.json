Pevsner recalled his response: \"Allen said, 'You have done the King Penguins now and we are going on with them, but if you had your way, what else would you do?' I had my answer ready\u2014and the answer was very formidable, because I outlined both The Pelican History of Art and The Buildings of England on the spot, each about 40 to 50 volumes. Allen said, 'Yes, we can do both,' and that was the end of the meeting.\"Peter Draper, Reassessing Nikolaus Pevsner, 2004, p. 73. Pevsner's industry quickly bore fruit with the first contracts signed by 1946 for John Summerson's Architecture in Britain, Anthony Blunt's Art and Architecture in France, and Rudolf Wittkower's Italian art and architecture, the first title Painting in Britain, 1530\u20131790 by Ellis Waterhouse was issued in 1953. By 1955, Pevsner produced a prospectus for the series announcing the publication of four new volumes and a plan for the rest of the series totalling 47 titles. The ambition of the series exceeded previously published multi-volume histories of art such as Andr\u00e9 Michel's Histoire de l'art (17 vols., 1905\u201328), the Propyl\u00e4en Kunstgeschichte (25 vols., 1923\u201335). Forty-one volumes were published by the time Pevsner retired from editing in 1977. His work was continued by Judy Nairn (his editorial assistant on the Buildings of England) and the medievalist Peter Lasko. Yale University Press acquired the series in 1992 when 45 titles had been completed; by 2004 they had published 21 volumes, mostly revisions of existing editions.Draper, Reassessing Nikolaus Pevsner, p. 75.

They were probably made in Milan in about 970, to decorate a large flat surface, though whether this was a door, an antependium or altar frontal, the cover of an exceptionally large book, a pulpit, or something else, has been much discussed.  Each nearly square plaque measures about 13x12 cm, with a relief scene from the Life of Christ inside a plain flat frame; one plaque in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York has a \"dedication\" scene, where a crowned monarch presents Christ with a model church, usually taken to be Otto I with Magdeburg Cathedral.  Altogether seventeen survive, probably fewer than half of the original set.  The plaques include background areas fully cut through the ivory, which would presumably originally have been backed with gold.  Apart from the spaces left beside buildings, these openwork elements include some that leave chequerboard or foliage patterns.Lasko, 87\u201391; Williamson, 12; Beckwith, 126\u2013129.

A number of exhibitions held in Germany in the years following World War II helped introduce the subject to a wider public and promote the understanding of art media other than manuscript illustrations.  The 1950 Munich exhibition Ars Sacra (\"sacred art\" in Latin) devised this term for religious metalwork and the associated ivories and enamels, which was re-used by Peter Lasko in his book for the Pelican History of Art, the first survey of the subject written in English, as the usual art-historical term, the \"minor arts\", seemed unsuitable for this period, where they were, with manuscript miniatures, the most significant art forms.Suckale-Redlefsen, 524; Lasko, xxii lists a number of the exhibitions up to 1972.

There are three main survivals of metalwork pieces certainly commissioned by Egbert, though contemporary literary references make it clear there was originally a large production, and both the three clear survivals and a larger group of objects often related to Trier both show \"astonishingly little unity\" in style and workmanship, which makes the confident attribution of other pieces such as the Cross of Otto and Mathilde very difficult.  The three clear survivals are the so-called \"Egbert shrine\", a reliquary casket and portable altar for a sandal of Saint Andrew and other relics, still in the Treasury of Trier Cathedral, the staff-reliquary of St Peter, now in Limburg Cathedral Treasury, and the metalwork on the treasure binding reused for the Codex Aureus of Echternach some fifty years later, having been donated by Empress Theophanu. This last had possibly been given to Theophanu and Otto III to mark Egbert's reconciliation with them in 985.Head, 76 Of these three pieces clearly attributable to Trier, Peter Lasko wrote: \"Each seems to have been made in a totally different workshop, using different sources, techniques, and principles of composition, and if the evidence for Archbishop Egbert as the donor for all three pieces were not so overwhelming, no one would have dared to attribute them all to one centre.\"Lasko, 95\u201399, 96 quoted; Head deals with the first two objects; Beckwith, 133\u2013135 for the book cover; Image of the foot reliquary.
