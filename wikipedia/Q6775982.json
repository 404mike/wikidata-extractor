Following a near fatal beating from Simon she moved on to a romance with moneyed Terry Fox (Miles Anderson), but their happiness is short-lived because of Terry's terminal cancer. Writers featured her in a euthanasia story, when she agrees to assist him in committing suicide. A feud with her step-daughter Lisa Fox (Luisa Bradshaw-White) was created and Kath found herself standing trial for assisted suicide. Kath was then a regular feature in a controversial serial killer plot, in which patients are murdered by staff nurse Kelly Yorke (Rachel Leskovac). She tries to frame Kath, who lays blame to Kelly's brother Nic Yorke (Liam Garrigan), which results in Kelly stabbing Kath in a near fatal clash.", "One of Kath's early issue lead stories was becoming the victim of domestic abuse from her husband Simon Shaughnessy (Andrew Dunn). Initially Kath develops feelings for her colleague, the consultant general surgeon Mike Barratt (Clive Mantle). When they attend a course together they almost share a kiss. This tests Kath's faith and she decides to distance herself from him. Kath briefly break up with Simon, but he convinces her to return with the promise of counselling sessions. Simon tries to change his ways but his aggression towards Kath heightens the following month. She then bonds with a patient named Linda (Sonia Beinroth) whose husband has attacked her. Simon had long been aggressive towards Kath but it was only when she was admitted to the hospital following a \"severe beating\", would her colleagues discover the abuse. It happens after she becomes close with the on-site priest Father Michael (Martin Ledwith), which makes Simon jealous. When Father Michael drops Kath off at home following a church service, Simon beats Kath up and she is rushed into the hospital for emergency surgery. Danny becomes desperate to protect Kath from his father. He and Father Michael secure and decorate a new flat for Kath to live in when she is discharged. Father Michael gives Kath the courage to leave Simon for good. But their relationship cannot progress because both of their commitments to religion. Father Michael offers to leave the church but Kath believes it is wrong and ends their relationship."]}, {"page": "Ledwith", "response": ["*Martin Ledwith, British actor and acting coach"]}, {"page": "The Whistle-Blower (TV series)", "response": ["* Martin Ledwith as Vincent Shearer"]}, {"page": "Ledwith, Martin", "response": ["#redirectMartin Ledwith"]}]}}
