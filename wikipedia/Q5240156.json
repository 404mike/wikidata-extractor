He grew up in Leeds and in the early Eighties was a student at the University of Oxford where he was a close friend of Simon Reynolds. The two were part of the Oxford-based collective that in 1984 launched the pop journal Monitor and then in 1986 both joined Melody Maker as staff writers.\nStubbs remained at Melody Maker for a dozen years. He combined his serious writing career with writing the humorous \"Talk Talk Talk\" section, which featured the character of Mr Agreeable who would insult sacred cows with barrages of swear words (asterisked out to comply with IPC Media regulations).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "OK Computer", "response": ["Critics have compared Radiohead's statements of political dissatisfaction to those of earlier rock bands. David Stubbs said that, where punk rock had been a rebellion against a time of deficit and poverty, OK Computer protested the \"mechanistic convenience\" of contemporary surplus and excess.

During its recording, Kramer experimented with innovative studio techniques such as backmasking, chorus effect, echo, and flanging, which AllMusic's Cub Koda said recontextualized Hendrix's psychedelic and funk sounds on the album."]}, {"page": "Ambient 1: Music for Airports", "response": ["Music for Airports makes use of spliced tape loops. Recalling its creation, Eno said it was \"conceived as deliberately austere and unemotional\" and  \"was essentially made by machines\". He has stated a connection to death.

Some reviewers panned it, feeling that U2 were making a deliberate and pretentious attempt at rock and roll renown. Jon Pareles of The New York Times called it a \"mess\" that exuded \"sincere egomania\", and said the \"band's self-importance got in the way\" of their ambition for the album. He said it was plagued by the group's \"attempts to grab every mantle in the Rock-and-Roll Hall of Fame\" and that each one was \"embarrassing in a different way\". David Stubbs of Melody Maker said that Rattle and Hum \"lacks cohesion\" and \"is musically, stylistically confused\". He criticised Bono's \"reverential nods to the great white heroes of rock\" and the band's \"homages to the bluesmen and gospel greats\". Thom Duffy of the Orlando Sentinel said that Rattle and Hum is \"greatly in need of a focal point\" and \"often sounds like an over-reaching attempt to claim chunks of pop history as [U2's] own story\". He believed the group had \"merely celebrated its own ascension into the pop history books... and little more\". Tom Carson from The Village Voice called it an \"awful record\" by \"almost any rock-and-roll fan's standards\", and said the group's failure did not \"sound attributable to pretensions so much as to monumental know-nothingism\". Fellow Village Voice critic Robert Christgau was more complimentary, calling the record \"looser and faster than anything they've recorded since their first live mini-LP\". David Browne of the New York Daily News said the album's \"scope and disjointedness\" recalled double albums such as Exile on Main St. or The Beatles, but that until it aged as well as those records, \"'Rattle and Hum' just prattles and numbs\". Andrew Means of The Arizona Republic thought the album was \"no substitute\" for the \"exhilaration and conviction\" of the Joshua Tree Tour. He believed that Bono's passion on record was not \"quite as mesmerizing as it is on stage\" and that the group's new material did not \"add significantly\" to their message or image. Lynden Barber of The Sydney Morning Herald called it \"an ambitious project, and the result is almost inevitably a mixed bag\". He lamented the songs that presented the band's Christianity \"as a fait accompli\", as well as their proclivity for \"jams around a couple of chords substituting themselves for considered song-writing\".
