He plays baroque music on a Perugian cello made by Finnocchi in about 1720 and later music on a Lorenzo Ventapane made in Naples in 1806.\nAs well as ensemble work, Medlam has begun to popularise and record the solo gamba music of composers such as Nicolas Hotman, Jean Lacquemant (Dubuisson), Sainte-Colombe and De Machy.  Medlam and his music are often heard on BBC Radio 3. His work has been favourably reviewed by BBC Radio 3, the Early Music journal and others.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of early music ensembles", "response": ["* London Baroque (founded in 1978 by Ingrid Seifert and Charles Medlam): baroque chamber orchestra"]}, {"page": "Eurovision Young Musicians 1990", "response": ["*  \u2013 Charles Medlam"]}, {"page": "Sally Bradshaw", "response": ["*Scarlatti.
