This error was highlighted in 1944 by D. F. Ferguson (using a mechanical desk calculator).Shanks earned his living by owning a boarding school at Houghton-le-Spring, which left him enough time to spend on his hobby of calculating mathematical constants. His routine was as follows: he would calculate new digits all morning; and then he would spend all afternoon checking his morning's work.  To calculate \u03c0, Shanks used Machin's formula:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \u03c0\n            4\n          \n        \n        =\n        4\n        arctan\n        \u2061\n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              1\n              5\n            \n          \n          )\n        \n        \u2212\n        arctan\n        \u2061\n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              1\n              239\n            \n          \n          )\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\pi }{4}}=4\\arctan \\left({\\frac {1}{5}}\\right)-\\arctan \\left({\\frac {1}{239}}\\right)}\n  Shanks's approximation was the longest expansion of \u03c0 until the advent of the digital electronic computer about one century later.\nShanks also calculated e and the Euler\u2013Mascheroni constant \u03b3 to many decimal places. He published a table of primes up to 60 000 and found the natural logarithms of 2, 3, 5 and 10 to 137 places.\nShanks died in Houghton-le-Spring, County Durham, England in June 1882, aged 70, and was buried at the local Hillside Cemetery on 17 June 1882.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "E (mathematical constant)", "response": ["| 1853 ||align=right| 137 || William ShanksWilliam Shanks, Contributions to Mathematics, ...

For one, it was known that any error would produce a value slightly high, and for the other, it was known that any error would produce a value slightly low. And hence, as long as the two series produced the same digits, there was a very high confidence that they were correct. The first 100,265 digits of  were published in 1962.
