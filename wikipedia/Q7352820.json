She worked in close collaboration with her husband, Robin Tanner, at their home in Kington Langley, Wiltshire.", "Heather Tanner attended Chippenham Grammar School, where she met her future husband, the etcher and teacher Robin Tanner. In his autobiography, Double Harness, Robin recounts how, as school prefects he and Heather would smuggle secret messages to each other in the absentee registers for which they were responsible as their relationship blossomed in the early 1920s.Robin Tanner, Double Harness: An Autobiography(London: Impact, 1987), 21. Heather achieved a First Class degree at King's College London, which she left in 1929 to become an English teacher at The Duchess School for Girls, Alnwick Castle, Northumberland.See account in An Exceptional Woman: The Writings of Heather Tanner, ed. by Rosemary Devonald (Salisbury: Hobnob Press, 2006).  After a brief geographical separation while Robin studied at Goldsmiths College, London, they married at Corsham Church on 4 April 1931.", "Heather and Robin Tanner moved to Kington Langley, Wiltshire, after their wedding, the start of a lifelong creative collaboration and residence. In Double Harness, Robin Tanner writes that Heather\u2019s uncle, the architect Vivian Goold, 'generously offered as a wedding gift to design a house for us and supervise its building if we could find a piece of land we liked'.Robin Tanner, Double Harness, 45. The result was Old Chapel Field, completed in 1931. The house, which is still standing in the village, is a distinctive blend of arts and crafts and modernist styles. Inspired by C.F.A. Voysey, Goold came to regard the house as the finest that he had designed. Heather and Robin had great affection for the 'Voyseyish' Old Chapel Field, where they were to live for the rest of their lives. The Tanners were thrilled to discover that Francis Kilvert\u2019s great-grandfather was buried in the graveyard of the Chapel from which their home took its name, and both Heather and Robin actively supported the Kilvert Society.", "After the War, Heather worked as an examiner in English for the University of Cambridge and later at the University of London.Robin Tanner, Double Harness, 123. Her moral and spiritual outlook as a Quaker was to deeply affect her outlook and support for a range of environmental and social causes. She was an active member of the Chippenham branch of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (visiting the Greenham Common Women's Peace Camp and attending many Aldermaston Marches) and supporter of Friends of the Earth and Oxfam.", "The Tanners created four books, that Robin illustrated and for which Heather provided the text, collaborating so closely together that Robin wrote that 'they were essentially the production of two minds working in such close unison that it would be impossible to separate them.'Robin Tanner, Double Harness, 208.", "Wiltshire Village is a thinly disguised description of the village life and countryside surrounding the Tanners' home. The subject of the book Kington Borel takes its name from a compound of their own village, Kington Langley, and the neighbouring parish of Langley Burrell (named after the Borel family who held the estate and manor in Norman times). First published in 1939, the book has been the most widely admired and frequently reprinted fruit of the couple\u2019s creative collaboration. Heather Tanner\u2019s text and Robin Tanner\u2019s etchings and pen drawings distil all that is picturesque in the rural landscape of North-West Wiltshire. Featuring history, culture, crafts and wildlife, Wiltshire Village embraces much of the Tanners' aesthetic and ethical creed as the celebration of traditional rural crafts and community is underpinned by a rejection of militarism, blood sports and the conservative outlook of feudal England; a creed in keeping with that of their hero William Morris.", "In many ways a companion volume for Wiltshire Village, the Tanners similarly started to collate the materials for Woodland Plants during the early years of the Second World War, although the completed project was not published until 1981. It has been suggested that the manuscript was lost under the Tanners' bed for 17 years.Joe James, 'Heather & Robin', Corsham Spotlight 4.3 (November 2006), 5; http://www.corsham-civic-society.co.uk/Nov2006.pdf  [accessed 9 November 2010]. The Tanners were keen amateur botanists and counted their original copy of James Sowerby\u2019s 37-volume English Botany (1790\u20131814) as one of their most treasured possessions. Woodland Plants is an account of local plants' uses, lore and presence in literature. Robin Tanner was keen to produce the detailed drawings from sketches made in situ, mostly within a few miles of their home such as in the Weavern Valley and at Bird's Marsh and Thickwood. In an epilogue, Heather reflects upon the way that the forty years gestation of the book enabled them to observe and reflect upon the environmental damage that took place during the intervening period, but also, more positively, the emergence of ecological awareness.", "The preface to A Country Alphabet indicates that this work was a collaborative project shared between Heather who wrote the text and Robin who designed the letters. 'As a drawing was finished Heather would contemplate it as she went about the daily chores, now and then scribbling an idea on the nearest piece of paper.'Heather and Robin Tanner, A Country Alphabet (London: Impact Press, 1987), 6.  Their friends the publishers Frances and Nicolas MacDowall at Old Stile Press contributed creatively towards the feel of the book through their experimentation and selection of typefaces, paper and pagination when it was first published as a limited hand-printed edition in 1984. This resulted in an extremely tactile volume both in its content with its sensory celebration of physical things and in A Country Alphabet\u2019s feel and physical appearance as an artefact in its own right.", "Reawakens the pre-Victorian genre of the book of days with a celebration of rural life and rites through the cycle of the year. Heather Tanner\u2019s twenty-five entries, set out as a commonplace book, are accompanied by Robin Tanner\u2019s woodcuts. Like A Country Alphabet, to which it is in some ways a companion volume, A Country Books of Days was originally published as a hand-printed limited edition in 1986, thus owing much not only to the style of William Morris but also to the early craft of book production exemplified by William Blake.", "* Tanner, Heather and Robin Tanner.

He returned to London in 1928 to continue etching under Hubert Schroeder at Chiswick. In 1929, Webb studied with F. L. Griggs in Chipping Campden, Gloucestershire, when the older artist became the principal contemporary influence upon Webb's etched work both technically and in subject matter. Both artists shared a love of ancient buildings set in idealised landscapes, charged with a spiritual and mystical intensity. Following the example of the late Romantic etchings of Samuel Palmer, a group of contemporary British printmakers, including Robin Tanner, Graham Sutherland and Paul Drury, were developing a body of work based on evocative visionary scenes of a lost pre-industrial England."]}, {"page": "Robin Tanner (minister)", "response": ["Reverend Robin Noelle Tanner is an American Unitarian Universalist minister notable for her activism for the causes of religious freedom and civil rights. Reverend Tanner is the Minister of Worship and Outreach at Beacon Unitarian Universalist Congregation in Summit. From 2010 to 2016, she was lead minister at the Piedmont Unitarian Universalist Church in Charlotte and Salisbury in North Carolina. Tanner is a lesbian who married her partner in 2014 and has performed marriage services for same-sex couples.  In 2014, Tanner joined the United Church of Christ in an innovative lawsuit challenging prohibitions against marrying same-sex couples. This lawsuit took the novel position that the laws restricted the ministers' freedom of religion. The suit was successful: On October 10, 2014, the federal district court for western North Carolina struck down the ban on same-sex marriage.  Reverend Tanner also worked to overturn HB2 (more formally the Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act), the North Carolina law that was passed in March 2016 to ban individuals from using a public bathroom that does not match the person's biological sex.  The law also prevented cities from passing rules to protect gay and transgender people from discrimination. In spite of challenges and an apparent agreement between the city of Charlotte and the state to repeal both the Charlotte anti-discrimination ordinances and HB2, HB2 remains in effect. She is an advocate for equal opportunity, voting rights for Latino and African-Americans, raising the minimum wage, marriage equality, as well as other issues.
