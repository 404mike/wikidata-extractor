Internationally, he represents Northern Ireland, being eligible through his Northern Ireland-born grandfather, although he previously played for the England under-21 team.\nCamp started his professional career with Derby County in 2002, having progressed through the club's youth ranks. During a five-year spell at the club, he made 89 league appearances for Derby, and also went on loan to three clubs: Burton Albion in 2003, Queens Park Rangers in 2004 and 2007, and Norwich City, in 2006. He switched to Queens Park Rangers in July 2007, and made 50 league appearances for the club in a two-season spell, taking his total number of QPR appearances to 73. Between October 2008 and January 2009, Camp was loaned to Nottingham Forest, signing permanently for the club in July 2009. In total, he made 182 league appearances for Nottingham Forest before returning to Norwich City in January 2013. He made three appearances in his second spell at the club, before being released on a free transfer in May 2013.\nCamp joined West Bromwich Albion in September 2013 and spent two months on loan at AFC Bournemouth. He was released by West Brom in January 2014 and subsequently joined Bournemouth on a two-and-a-half-year deal, but left after one year for Rotherham United, where he was a regular for 18 months until an injured knee kept him out for the rest of his contract. He then joined Cardiff City, but never played, and spent time on loan at Sunderland before signing for Birmingham City, where he spent two seasons as first choice. He had a short non-playing spell at Coventry City as injury cover before spending the last two months of the 2020\u201321 season with Swindon Town.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 22", "response": ["*1984 \u2013 Lee Camp, English footballer"]}, {"page": "Nottingham Forest F.C.", "response": ["|2010|| Lee Camp"]}, {"page": "Verwood", "response": ["*Lee Camp \u2013 AFC Bournemouth player"]}, {"page": "Chris Coleman (footballer)", "response": ["During the winter transfer window, Coleman was informed that club chairman Ellis Short had refused to invest any more money into player transfers, with the American businessman announcing his intentions to sell the club.

His debut was against Manchester United in the 2007 FA Community Shield, coming on as a substitute, but then missed the penalty shootout as Chelsea lost the match. Nevertheless, his season with Chelsea got off to a good start, scoring a goal on the opening weekend of the 2007\u201308 Premier League season against Birmingham City. After Chelsea's coach Jos\u00e9 Mourinho's departure and the signing of French striker Nicolas Anelka, Pizarro found himself surplus to the then new manager Avram Grant. Despite this, Pizarro did play an important role in Chelsea progressing to the fourth round of the 2008 FA Cup, by contributing to a rebound of QPR keeper Lee Camp that went into the net. He also scored the only goal in a match against Birmingham. This meant that his only two Premier League goals with Chelsea came in separate games against Birmingham City."]}, {"page": "Kevin Poole", "response": ["Phil Brown signed Poole as a goalkeeping coach for Derby County in July 2005; Brown had been assistant manager of Poole's old club Bolton until that summer. Although at the age of 42 he was also registered as a player, this was initially intended only for emergencies; however he was unexpectedly promoted to first choice for a spell due to poor form and injuries affecting young goalkeepers Lee Camp and Lee Grant in a difficult season for the East Midlands club, who narrowly avoided relegation to League One. The 42-year-old Poole played seven times for the first team before returning to coaching duties.

Steele started all three games at the finals in Liechtenstein in July 2003, but England were eliminated with just one win in three group games.

Before reaching 16 he spent time as the Norwich first team's substitute goalkeeper, but did not make an appearance. He turned professional in October 2004, but got no nearer to a first team debut than being named on the bench for portions of 2004\u201305 and 2005\u201306. The sale of first-choice goalkeeper Robert Green meant that Lewis became second-choice goalkeeper at Carrow Road before a fractured cheekbone sustained in a reserve team game against Leyton Orient prompted the loan signing of Lee Camp."]}, {"page": "Chris Day", "response": ["Day played 34 times for QPR during the 2003\u201304 season.

He sustained an injury in February 2004, which meant QPR signed Lee Camp on loan to cover in his absence, and his Camp's form ultimately kept Day out of the team when he returned. Day was an unused substitute in QPR's 3\u20131 win against Sheffield Wednesday, a victory that ultimately secured automatic promotion back to the Championship. Day returned to the first-team for the club's return to the Championship during the 2004\u201305 season, playing 33 games. He was dropped in January 2005 in favour of loanee Simon Royce, and was, as a result, allowed to move to Preston North End on a one-month loan deal.

The move led to press reports that Grant was surplus to requirements at Pride Park, however manager George Burley dismissed the story as \"total speculation with no basis in fact\". Around the same time, Grant also found himself ousted from the England under-21 squad by Camp.", "Grant would have to wait until 19 October to make his first appearance of the season for Derby, when he replaced Lee Camp in goal following Camp's sending-off against Wolves. Grant went on to start the following match against Burnley whilst Camp served a suspension for the red card, but would not play another first team game for the remainder of the season. Lee Camp sympathised with Grant at the time, saying: \"It's tough for Granty and I would be frustrated in his situation. He came in for the Burnley game and did nothing wrong but I think I've done enough this season to warrant my place in the side\". Grant's woes were added to when he suffered a wrist injury in training in March 2005. The injury was followed by a shoulder problem the following month which required surgery and kept the goalkeeper out of action for several months.", "Grant was again given a chance during the 2006\u201307 pre-season, and Derby manager Billy Davies awarded him with a starting place for the club's second league game of the season against Stoke City on 8 August 2006. However, the arrival of Stephen Bywater on 12 August 2006 further limited Grant's first team opportunities. Following Bywater picking up a thigh injury and Camp's loan move to Norwich City, Grant was able to string together six appearances in September and October 2006, but after Bywater's return to fitness he was again left out of the team until his final appearance for Derby against Ipswich Town on 14 April 2007 when he came on a substitute after Bywater had been shown a red card. Bywater was handed a one-match ban, however Lee Camp was recalled from his loan and took his place in the following match.

Bolder came in, and added steel to the midfield, with some good tackling performances and an excellent range of passing. Combined with the signings of Danny Cullip and Lee Camp (on loan), Bolder helped QPR to avoid relegation, quite comfortably in the end and was named as club captain. On 27 October 2007, Bolder scored his first goal for Queens Park Rangers in a 1\u20130 win over Charlton Athletic at The Valley which lifted QPR off the bottom of the table.
