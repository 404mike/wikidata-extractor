As far as we can ascertain the details of the masque,  the Queen of Sheba  was to bring gifts to the King, representing Solomon, and was to be followed by the spirits of Faith, Hope, Charity, Victory and Peace. Unfortunately, as Harington reported, the actress playing the Queen tripped over the steps of the throne, sending her gifts flying;  Hope and Faith were too drunk to speak a word, while Peace, annoyed at finding her way to the throne blocked, made good use of her symbolic olive branches to slap anyone who was in her way.Henry Harington, Nugae Antiquae, vol. 1 (London, 1804), pp. 348-351"]}, {"page": "List of inventors", "response": ["*John Harington (1561\u20131612), UK \u2013 the flush toilet"]}, {"page": "Christian IV of Denmark", "response": ["His sister Anne had married King James VI of Scotland, who succeeded to the English throne in 1603.

Already during the reign of Henry VII, notices of money issued several times for the King's losses at cards appear in the Remembrance's Office, dated December the 26th, in the ninth year of his reign. There, an entry is made of one hundred shillings paid at one time to him for the purpose of playing at cards. The private expenses of Princess Mary, Henry VIII's daughter and later Queen, also contain numerous items of money \"for the playe at cardes\". But despite the records, it is not certain that primero found its way to England previously to the marriage of Queen Mary I with Philip II of Spain, although there is no doubt that his coming to England from the court of Charles V would have cause it to be more generally known and played. William Shakespeare also speaks of Henry VIII playing at primero with his brother-in-law Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk, and makes Falstaff say: \"I never prospered since I forswore myself at primero.\" Additionally, the clown Lancelot in Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice confides in this father that \"for mine own part, as I have set up my rest to run away, so I will not rest till I have sun some ground\" (2.2.91-92).

In the 19th century, the house was bought by Colonel Joseph Holden Strutt who renovated it, with the work being continued by his sons. In 1984, actress Jane Seymour bought the house and carried out further renovation. During her ownership, the property was used as a recording studio and party venue, which caused complaints among the neighbours.

It takes its name from the Church of St Catherine beside the manor house. When the house was not occupied by the monks, it was leased. In 1536, the lease was to Thomas Llewellyn, who remained as the tenant after the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Henry VIII granted the manor to his tailor, John Malte, in 1546. Part of the condition of the gift was that he adopt the king's illegitimate daughter Ethelreda Malte. Ethelreda inherited the house and married John Harington. After Ethelreda's death in 1551, Harrington married again. His son from this marriage was another John Harington who grew up and became a courtier of Elizabeth I and invented the first flush toilet. He spent most of his time at his principle seat at nearby Kelston and, in 1591, sold St Catherine's Court to John Blanchard. His son, William Blanchard, remodelled the house. His initials appear in the plasterwork frieze of a bedroom. The Blanchard family lived at the court for several generations. In 1610, the porch was added and a terraced garden laid out. The house passed by marriage to the Parry family but was not maintained, and the fabric of the building was declining by the 18th century, when half of the building was used by a tenant farmer."]}, {"page": "List of Old Etonians born before the 18th century", "response": ["* Sir John Harington (1561\u20131612), author and inventor of the water closet"]}, {"page": "Oxford poetry anthologies", "response": ["Henry Aldrich - William Allingham - Drummond Allison - John Amner - Matthew Arnold - W.

The grammar school and almshouses at Warton were shortly afterwards founded by him. In John Harington's 'Nug\u00e6 Antiqu\u00e6,\u2019 ii. 248, there is an account of a very bold sermon which he preached before Queen Elizabeth at Whitehall. He acted as lord president of the north from 1595 to 1600, and in 1598 he had in his custody at Bishopsthorpe Sir Robert Ker of Cessford, one of the wardens of the Scottish Marches.John Duncan Mackie, Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1597-1603, vol. 13 (Edinburgh, 1969), pp. 200\u20132: John Strype, Annals of the Reformation, vol. 4 (London, 1824), pp. 447-8. His courtesy to his prisoner was afterwards acknowledged by King James and by Sir Robert himself. One of his last public acts was to write a letter to Robert Cecil, Lord Cranborne, counselling a relaxation in the prosecution of the puritans. He died at Bishopthorpe on 16 January 1605\u20136, and was buried in York Minster. His monument is in the south aisle of the choir."]}, {"page": "Theobalds House", "response": ["In July 1606, Cecil again entertained King James and his brother-in-law, King Christian IV of Denmark, at Theobalds, while Anne of Denmark stayed at Greenwich. Both monarchs were notoriously heavy drinkers, and according to Sir John Harington, the occasion was simply an orgy of drunkenness, as few English or Danish courtiers had their rulers' capacity to hold their drink: an attempt to put on a masque of Solomon and Sheba descended into a farce, as most of the players were too inebriated to remember their lines, or even to stand up.Henry Harington, Nugae Antiquae, vol. 1 (London, 1804), pp. 348-351 The five-day visit cost Cecil \u00a31,180 including presents worth \u00a3284.Lawrence Stone, Crisis of the Aristocracy (Oxford, 1965), p. 453.

But she failed to curtail her commander and, according to her godson Sir John Harington, raged impotently at the news from Ireland: \"She walks much in her privy chamber and stamps with her feet at ill news, and thrusts her rusty sword at times into the arras in great rage.\"  She could take no more and on 30 July 1599 ordered an immediate attack on O'Neill."]}, {"page": "Sir Francis Drake (TV series)", "response": ["*Michael Anderson Jr. as John Harington"]}, {"page": "List of English inventions and discoveries", "response": ["* Before 1596: Modern flushing toilet invented by John Harington (1560\u20131612).

It has often been noticed that many of the texts that Shakespeare used as sources for his plays were products of the Vautrollier/Field printshop. These texts include Thomas North's translation of Plutarch, Sir John Harington's translation of Orlando Furioso, Robert Greene's Pandosto, the works of Ovid, and possibly Raphael Holinshed's Chronicles. Since Field would have kept a copy of each of these books in his shop, it has been theorised that Shakespeare used Field's shop as a library during his early career.Stopes, Charlotte. Shakespeare's Warwickshire Contemporaries. Stratford-upon-Avon, Shakespeare Head Press, 1907. James Shapiro argues that the influence of Plutarch was especially significant in Shakespeare's mid-career and that he \"probably worked from a copy of Plutarch given, or lent him, by Field, an expensive and beautiful folio that cost a couple of pounds\"."]}]}}
