The castle was bought by Henry Beveridge, a wealthy mill owner, in 1884, when it was extended and modernised.  He commissioned the architect Charles Kinnear in 1885 to add an east wing, insert larger windows on the ground floor, and add a portico to the north, leading to a new main entrance. The additions were detailed in a similar Scottish Renaissance style. The grounds were also renovated, with a water garden and a narrow-gauge railway.

Peddie senior retired in 1879 and entered Parliament as Liberal MP for Kilmarnock Burghs. The practice became known as Kinnear and Peddie, with Charles Kinnear as senior partner. The Peddie family incurred substantial debts following the failure of some of John Dick Peddie's business interests, and fraud committed by his uncle. In 1878, the City of Glasgow Bank also collapsed, leading to recession in Scotland. However, the practice continued to find work, with J M Dick Peddie's designs including the Bank of Scotland's George Street branch (1883\u20131884). Kinnear worked on the practice's major schemes during the early 1880s, including Longmore Hospital and Craiglockhart Hydropathic, but in 1884 he became Colonel of the Midlothian Coast Artillery Volunteers, and his role in the firm reduced. He died suddenly in 1894, and within a year or two Peddie had taken on George Washington Browne (1853\u20131939), with whom he had worked informally for some time, as a partner. Further work on bank branches included several outlets of the British Linen Bank. The practice was very successful, and lasted formally to 1907.
