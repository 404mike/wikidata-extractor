Her accession day was celebrated in England and Wales during her reign and also, according to the 19th-century historian Thomas Lathbury, during the reigns of her successors.\"According to Lathbury, the 17th day of November, the day of the Queen's accession, was observed even after Elizabeth's death as a day of thanksgiving to Almighty God for the gracious deliverance wrought out for the Church by her instrumentality.\" (Evan Daniel, The Prayer-Book; its history, language and contents; 26th ed. Redhill: Wells Gardner (1948), p.\u00a0535.) A \"Form of Prayer and Thanksgiving\" to be used in churches on the anniversary of the queen's accession was published in 1576 and used until 1602."]}, {"page": "Thomas Brett (nonjuror)", "response": ["Brett was consecrated bishop by the nonjuring bishops Jeremy Collier, Nathaniel Spinckes, and Samuel Hawes, in 1716. He took part in a negotiation which they opened in 1716 with the Greek archbishop of Thebais, then in London, and which continued till 1725, when it was allowed to drop. Brett's account, with copies of a proposed concordat, and letters to the Tsar of Moscovy and his ministers, is given by Thomas Lathbury from the manuscripts of Alexander Jolly. Before a definitive reply had been received from the Greek prelates, the nonjurors had split into two over a controversy. Brett supported Collier in proposing to reinstate the four usages that had been included in the first liturgy of Edward VI. He defended his view in a postscript to his work on 'Tradition' and in an important collection of Liturgies.  He took part in related controversies, and joined in consecrating bishops with Collier and Archibald Campbell. In 1727 he consecrated Thomas Brett, junior."]}, {"page": "Joseph Sortain", "response": ["Sortain was a reviewer during the mid-1830s. He obtained work foe the High Church British Critic, through contacts with the Rev. Richard Harvey of Hornsey, and James Shergold Boone. He wrote also for the Edinburgh Review, at the suggestion of William Empson. These articles of the mid-1830s were anonymous, but attributions to Sortain have been made, for topics such as Brougham on natural theology, Coleridge, Charles Lyell on geology, and Mary Somerville's Connection of the Physical Sciences in the British Critic.John Taylor, Notes on Bristol Huguenots, Proceedings of the Huguenot Society, Vol. III Issue 3 (PDF), p. 373. In the Edinburgh Review topics were Richard Baxter, Thomas Lathbury's History of English Episcopacy, and Jeremy Bentham's Deontology (he thought Bentham's works brought on \"mental nausea\"). Harvey, however, seemed to find Sortain's oratory incomprehensible."]}, {"page": "Daniel Conner Lathbury", "response": ["He was born in Wootton, near Northampton, the eldest son of Thomas Lathbury, a cleric and ecclesiastical historian, and was educated at King's College, London and Brasenose College, Oxford, graduating in 1854. He entered Lincoln's Inn to study law and was called to the bar in 1858 but never practiced law."]}, {"page": "Lathbury, Thomas", "response": ["#redirectThomas Lathbury"]}]}}
