He has been a professor at Cognitive Neuroscience Sector of the International School for Advanced Studies (SISSA) in Trieste, Italy since 1994.\nShallice has been influential in laying the foundations for the discipline of cognitive neuropsychology, by formalising many of its methods and assumptions in his 1988 book From Neuropsychology to Mental Structure. He has also worked on many core problems in cognitive psychology and neuropsychology, including executive function, language and memory. Together with psychologist Don Norman, Shallice proposed a framework of attentional control of executive functioning. One of the components of the Norman-Shallice model is the supervisory attentional system. The model is viewed as a possible realization of Alexander Luria's theory in information-processing terms.Together with John Fox, Shallice was also awarded a grant on cognitive modelling by the United Kingdom's Joint Council Initiative in Cognitive Science and Human-Computer Interaction. The project developed an existing specification language for cognitive modelling and resulted to a prototype COGENT system.Shallice also co-authored a study on the relationship of prospective and retrospective memory using neuropsychological evidence with Paul W. Burgess. Shallice contributed in the development of neuropsychological tests including the Hayling and Brixton tests and the Behavioural Assessment of the Dysexecutive Syndrome (BADS).He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1996.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Working memory", "response": ["* Tim Shallice"]}, {"page": "Don Norman", "response": ["Together with psychologist Tim Shallice, Norman proposed a framework of attentional control of executive functioning.

Cognitive neuropsychology. Scholarpedia, 3(2), 3644. doi: 10.4249/scholarpedia.3644. Cognitive psychologists and clinical neuropsychologists developed more research collaborations to gain a better understanding of these disorders. The rebirth of neuropsychology was marked by the publishing of two seminal collaborative papers from Marshall & Newcombe (1966) on reading and Warrington & Shallice (1969) on memory. Subsequently, work by pioneers such as Elizabeth Warrington, Brenda Milner, Tim Shallice, Alan Baddeley and Lawrence Weiskrantz demonstrated that neurological patients were an important source of data for cognitive psychologists."]}, {"page": "Conduction aphasia", "response": ["In 1970, Tim Shallice and Elizabeth Warrington were able to differentiate two variants of"]}, {"page": "Tower of London test", "response": ["The test was developed by the psychologist Tim Shallice and consists of two boards with pegs and several beads with different colors.

For example, Posner proposed that there is a separate \"executive\" branch of the attentional system, which is responsible for focusing attention on selected aspects of the environment. The British neuropsychologist Tim Shallice similarly suggested that attention is regulated by a \"supervisory system\", which can override automatic responses in favour of scheduling behaviour on the basis of plans or intentions. Throughout this period, a consensus emerged that this control system is housed in the most anterior portion of the brain, the prefrontal cortex (PFC)."]}, {"page": "Hayling and Brixton tests", "response": ["The Hayling and Brixton testsBurgess, P. & Shallice, T.

The model uses thought and action schemas which are a series of learned thought and action sequences, like scripts, that specify behaviours during situations.  Schemas are activated from perceptual stimuli or from the output of recently activated schemata.  For an example, entering your kitchen to find a pile of unclean dishes (input) could initiate a behavioural response to clean (schema). It is postulated that an enormous, finite quantity of thought and action schemata exist and that they range in hierarchy.  For instance, high-level schemas represent problem solving while low-level schemas typify actions."]}, {"page": "Mind & Brain Prize", "response": ["*2013 \u2013 Tim Shallice"]}, {"page": "UCL School of Management", "response": ["Although management has recently emerged as specific area of research at UCL, some prominent figures in closely related fields were faculty members at UCL. Karl Pearson who founded the world's first statistics department at UCL in 1911, is regarded as the father of modern statistics. Pearson's mentor and polymath, Francis Galton, who founded the erstwhile Galton Laboratory of UCL, is considered to be the father of psychometrics and differential psychology. Several important contributions to areas such as statistics and evolutionary game theory were made by figures like Kirstine Smith, Ronald Fisher, J.B.S. Haldane and John Maynard Smith associated with the lab. In the field of experimental psychology, several faculty members of UCL's Faculty of Brain Sciences like James Sully, Charles Spearman and Tim Shallice made noted contributions to advance the field. The Bartlett, was the first architecture and built environment school established in the UK in 1841 and since, many of its faculty members like Patrick Abercrombie and Peter Hall have made notable contributions to the field of planning.
