Effective lobbyists, however, have included Families Need Fathers (FNF), whose ideas were included in the Adoption and Children Act 2002  regarding the automatic granting of parental responsibility to fathers when their name appears on a child's birth certificate. Tony Coe has been an articulate proponent of a singular message, and appeared in 2004 on a TV programme with Bob Geldof and Jim Parton, the editor of the FNF newsletter. The 2005 Children and Contact Bill addresses one of the expressed concerns of Fathers For Justice. If remains to be seen in the United Kingdom whether providing evidence to Select committees is a more effective tactic than performing publicity stunts."]}, {"page": "Parton", "response": ["*Jim Parton, fathers' rights activist"]}, {"page": "Piotrowice Nyskie", "response": ["The village has a seventeenth-century former bishop's palace which is currently being restored by the author Jim Parton.
