Pattinson joined his family's railway contracting firm after finishing school and was quickly appointed to senior positions. In 1900, he became chairman of Ruskington Urban District Council and four years later joined Kesteven County Council, eventually becoming an alderman and serving as its chairman for 20 years between 1934 and his death in 1954. He chaired the Sleaford Liberal Association (1900\u201318) and was nominated as the party's representative for Sleaford shortly before World War I broke out. He contested Grantham unsuccessfully in 1918, but was returned for the seat in 1922, serving until he was defeated in the following year's general election. Several other unsuccessful attempts at a parliamentary career followed. He chaired several bodies responsible for maintaining Lincolnshire's waterways, served as a magistrate for Kesteven and Lindsey and sat as Lincolnshire's High Sheriff in 1941. Knighted in 1934, Pattinson died aged 82 in 1954 after several years of illness.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sir Robert Pattinson", "response": ["#REDIRECT Robert Pattinson (politician)"]}, {"page": "Robert Pattinson (disambiguation)", "response": ["Robert Pattinson (born 1986) is an English actor.", "Robert Pattinson may also refer to:", "*Robert Pattinson (politician), MP for Grantham", "*Sir Robert Pattinson Academy, North Hykeham, Lincolnshire, England"]}, {"page": "Robert Pattinson (British politician)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Robert Pattinson (politician)"]}, {"page": "Emmeline Taylor", "response": ["Emmeline Pattinson was the second daughter of William Pattinson, a railway contractor from the Lincolnshire village of Ruskington, near Sleaford.\"Death of Mrs. E.
