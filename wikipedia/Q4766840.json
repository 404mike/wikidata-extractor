(Anna Beer, one of Milton's most recent biographers, points to a lack of evidence and the dangers of cynicism in urging that it was not necessarily the case that the private life so animated the public polemicising.) In 1643, Milton had a brush with the authorities over these writings, in parallel with Hezekiah Woodward, who had more trouble.Lewalski 2003 pp. 181\u201382, 600. It was the hostile response accorded the divorce tracts that spurred Milton to write Areopagitica; A speech of Mr. John Milton for the Liberty of Unlicenc'd Printing, to the Parlament of England, his celebrated attack on pre-printing censorship. In Areopagitica, Milton aligns himself with the parliamentary cause, and he also begins to synthesize the ideal of neo-Roman liberty with that of Christian liberty. Milton also courted another woman during this time; we know nothing of her except that her name was Davis and she turned him down. However, it was enough to induce Mary Powell into returning to him which she did unexpectedly by begging him to take her back. She bore him two daughters in quick succession following their reconciliation.Ann Hughes, 'Milton, Areopagitica, and the Parliamentary Cause', The Oxford Handbook of Milton, ed.

Throughout her childhood, Venice had suffered plagues that had killed much of its population. However, Barbara survived along with her mother and reached the age of 12 by the first Festa della Salute in 1631. By this time, she had begun to develop as a musician and started to demonstrate virtuosic vocal talent. Alongside this, she developed the ability to begin to accompany herself on the lute or theorbo. In her book Sounds and Sweet Airs, historian Anna Beer states that Strozzi's musical gifts became more evident at the time of her early adolescence, which led Giulio to arrange lessons in composition for her with one of the leading composers at the time, Francesco Cavalli. By the age of fifteen, Barbara was described as \"la virtuosissima cantatrice di Giulio Strozzi\" (Giulio Strozzi's extremely virtuosic singer). Around Barbara's sixteenth birthday, Giulio actively started to publicize her musical talents, ensuring dedications of works for her. Giulio subsequently established the Accademia degli Unisoni, a subsidiary of the Incogniti, which also welcomed musicians into the privileged social circle. Unisoni, operating from the Strozzi household, became the major performance space for the young Barbara, ensuring her opportunities of performing as a singer, as well as semi-public performances of her own works. In 1637, at the age of 18, Barbara took her father's last name, Strozzi, keeping it until her death."]}, {"page": "Elizabeth Raleigh", "response": ["The couple remained devoted to each other, although, according to Weir, Bess proved to be a domineering wife. Anna Beer, Lady Raleigh's biographer, offers a different perspective, pointing out that due to Raleigh's frequent absences, whether on expeditions, diplomatic duties, or in prison, Bess had to shoulder an unusual level of responsibility for a woman of her time. The Raleighs\u2019 second son, Walter, was born in 1593 at Sherborne.", "*My Just Desire: The Life of Bess Raleigh, Wife to Sir Walter (), by Anna Beer"]}]}}
