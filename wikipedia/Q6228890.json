He was born at Raygill in Garsdale, then in the West Riding of Yorkshire, where \"Dawson's Rock\" celebrates the site of his early thinking about conic sections.  After learning surgery from Henry Bracken of Lancaster, he worked as a surgeon in Sedbergh for a year, then went to study medicine at Edinburgh, walking 150 miles there with his savings stitched into his coat.  Despite a very frugal lifestyle, he was unable to complete his degree, and had to return to Garsdale until he earned enough as a surgeon and as a private tutor in Mathematics at Sedbergh School to enable him to complete his MD from London in 1765.\nDawson published The Doctrine of Philosophical Necessity Briefly Invalidated in 1781, arguing against Joseph Priestley's doctrine of Philosophical Necessity, but his main skill was in Mathematics. He was a private tutor to many undergraduates at the University of Cambridge where his pupils included twelve Senior Wranglers between 1781 and 1807.  Although he published little original work, he was skilled in correcting errors in the work of others. He studied the orbit of the moon and the dynamics of objects in central force fields, correcting serious errors in the calculations of the distance between the earth and the sun, and confirming an error in Newton's precession calculations.\nHe is notable as a mentor of Adam Sedgwick, James Inman, George Butler and many other public figures of the nineteenth century.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1734", "response": ["** John Dawson, English mathematician and surgeon (d.1820)"]}, {"page": "Sedbergh School", "response": ["*John Dawson Watson, British painter and illustrator", "*John Dawson, surgeon and mathematician"]}, {"page": "Adam Sedgwick", "response": ["He studied mathematics and theology, and obtained his BA (5th Wrangler) from the University of Cambridge in 1808 and his MA in 1811.

Haygarth's descendants now reside in Perth, Australia.", "In 1778 Haygarth helped found the Smallpox Society of Chester; the group advocated inoculation, an unpopular position at the time, and tried to educate the populace so as to avoid casual contraction of the disease. Only four years after this effort began, Chester's smallpox mortality rate had been reduced by almost 50%. Soon other towns, such as Leeds and Liverpool, adopted the Society's methods. They were assisted by his Inquiry how to Prevent the Small Pox (1784) which included statistical calculations supported by John Dawson. The book was translated into French and German and made Haygarth an internationally known figure. He further elaborated his ideas in Sketch of a plan to exterminate the casual small pox from Great Britain and to introduce general inoculation (1793). Unfortunately, his plan to inspect homes and provide general inoculation was resisted in the increasingly conservative 1790s. For his important work on smallpox, Haygarth was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1781."]}, {"page": "James Losh", "response": ["With his brother John, Losh had instruction from the local curate, William Gaskin, and then went to the academy of John Dawson.

He was born in 1778, in the small village of Wreay, Cumbria, the son of a local shoemaker, and descended from a long line of yeomen. Armstrong attended the local village school, developing an early interest in mathematics, and attending alongside the children of John Losh, from the local Losh family: James (1763\u20131833), George (1766\u20131846), and William. The Losh family were powerful in this area, descended from the Arloshes, who had occupied the area for over two centuries, and residing in the large local mansion, known as Woodside. Though the family were never honoured with titles, John Losh was known locally as \"the big black squire\" of Woodside. At this school, Armstrong was tutored by the local priest, William Gaskin, an eccentric man who James Losh recalled as \"uncouth in his manners and abrupt and confused in his manner of speaking\", if also \"a man of considerable powers of mind\". Armstrong was also likely introduced to the celebrated mathematics teacher, John Dawson, by John and James Losh, who both later studied under him at Sedbergh School."]}]}}
