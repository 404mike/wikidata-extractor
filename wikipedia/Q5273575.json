The South were bowled out for 183, Charlie Winning capturing five for 57, in 64 overs. The AIF collapsed and were 96 for six at the close before going on to total 162 in the second morning. Willis with 54 saved real embarrassment as Woolley took six for 74 and White four for 50. At close of play on day two, the South had advanced to 269 for six with Hardinge 90 not out. They were all out for 280 next morning with Hardinge stumped before he could add to his overnight score.

To allow him to recover from his illness upon arrival in Australia, Hobbs missed the first two games of the tour, but once recovered, he played in only two of the remaining four fixtures before the Test series began. Hobbs later expressed the belief that the MCC captain, Arthur Jones was instrumental in his omission from the team as he did not rate Hobbs a good player. He also believed that Jones did not give him a chance to prove himself. But Hobbs failed with the bat on his two appearances and was subsequently left out of the team for the first Test match.McKinstry, p. 78. Even when Jones was taken ill before the game started, George Gunn, not a member of the touring team but present in Australia, was preferred to Hobbs and scored a century in the game. However, England lost the game and the performance of the amateur wicketkeeper and makeshift opening batsman Dick Young was singled out as detrimental to the team. Following effective batting performances by Hobbs in two matches after the Test, Frederick Fane, the stand-in England captain, chose Hobbs to open the batting in the second Test.McKinstry, pp. 79\u201380. He made his Test debut on 1 January 1908 at Melbourne.McKinstry, p. 80. He went in to bat on the second day after Australia had scored 266; in 182 minutes, he scored 83 runs in his first innings and although he batted more slowly than usual, critics praised his defence.McKinstry, p. 81. Eventually, England needed 282 to win. Hobbs and Fane added 54 for the first wicket;McKinstry, p. 82. before Hobbs fell for 28 but England went on to win the match by one wicket."]}, {"page": "List of Sussex County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Dick Young (1905\u20131925) : R.
