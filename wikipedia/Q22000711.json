Emotionally Weird - an unexplained and inexplicably grotty title that suggests a rather different kind of book - is teeming with various fictions; the book itself boasts a bewildering array of typefaces. A more insidious by-product of this carnival of confabulation is that, after a while, the reader has no idea what's true and what isn't. By that point, Atkinson is relying, rather too heavily at times, on the fact that we won't care, so beguiled are we by her narrative exuberance and comic invention...Take out the typefaces and banish the overly ponderous outer reaches of this book and it's just a series of gags; but they're pretty good gags, and it's none the worse for that.\"\"Wag tales Comedy?

Alex Clark in The Guardian said of it: \"It is both a reasonably conventional narrative \u2013 there is plenty of action, detailed description and a focus spread between the principal characters \u2013 and a subtly unpredictable one. History and modernity are juxtaposed in the factual asymmetries of warfare (the Ethiopians must rely on outdated and often malfunctioning weapons and have no way of long-distance communication beyond running messengers). They are also set side by side in the modes of consciousness that all the characters experience.\" Michael Schaub of NPR wrote: \"The importance of memory \u2014 of those that came before us, and of things we'd rather forget \u2014 is at the heart of The Shadow King.... The star of the novel, however, is Mengiste's gorgeous writing, which makes The Shadow King nearly impossible to put down. Mengiste has a real gift for language; her writing is powerful but never florid, gripping the reader and refusing to let go. And this, combined with her excellent sense of pacing, makes the book one of the most beautiful novels of the year. It's a brave, stunning call for the world to remember all who we've lost to senseless violence.\""]}, {"page": "Ancient Light", "response": ["Critical reception for Ancient Light was primarily positive, with a reviewer for UK newspaper The Independent calling it a \"luminous, breathtaking work.\" Critics for The Guardian also reviewed Ancient Light, with Tim Adams praising Banville's themes and \"cleverness\", while Alex Clark praised the dual narrative as \"disorienting\".
