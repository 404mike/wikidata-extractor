K. Meek, was a British anthropologist. He wrote about the northern tribes of Nigeria and studied the Jukun people.

Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss wrote in The Elementary Structures of Kinship that exchanged women are \"the supreme gift\"; he also asserted that sister exchange embodies the principle of reciprocity present in all marriage and kinship systems. At the same time, the research available to him did not firmly establish the existence of sister exchange without cross-cousin marriage and L\u00e9vi-Strauss expressed doubts in whether it is real. However, local census data in Nigeria and other West African countries from 1920s already included information about people who primarily practised sister exchange without cross-cousin marriage. Similarly to L\u00e9vi-Strauss, Charles Kingsley Meek wrote that sister exchange is similar to bride price and the former can also be considered a type of exchange marriage with the woman substituted by material possessions."]}, {"page": "Tyap language", "response": ["|| Spoken by the A\u0331tyap people of the chiefdom bearing their name, in Zangon Kataf, also found in neighbouring chiefdoms in Kaura, Jema'a and Kauru LGAs. The dialect seems to be the mother dialect from which the others evolved, and was probably influenced by other languages, causing its drift from its parent proto-Plateau language root. British colonial anthropologist, Charles Kingsley Meek in 1931, classified most of the proto-Plateau ethno-linguistic groups as part of the \"Kataf (Atyap) Culture Complex\", speaking closely related dialects of a possible single language."]}, {"page": "C.
