This was a significant evolution from previous models of \"open\" dress that did not allow a diver to invert. Siebe-Gorman went on to manufacture helmets continuously until 1975."]}, {"page": "Decompression sickness", "response": ["* 1900: Leonard Hill used a frog model to prove that decompression causes bubbles and that recompression resolves them.
