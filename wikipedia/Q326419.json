When he was teaching at the University of Florence, Caselli devoted much of his research to the technology of telegraphic transmission of sketches as well as handwritten words. Inventor Alexander Bain was working on this technology as was physicist Frederick Bakewell. The major problem of the time was to get perfect synchronization between the transmitting and receiving parts so they would work together correctly. Caselli developed an electrochemical technology with a \"synchronizing apparatus\" (regulating clock) to make the sending and receiving mechanisms work together that was far superior to any technology Bain or Bakewell had."]}, {"page": "Shelford Bidwell", "response": ["In the late 1870s, he carried out a number of experiments with selenium photocells.  In one experiment, he duplicated the \"photophone\" originally created by Alexander Graham Bell.  This device used sound to vibrate a mirror.  Variations in light intensity reflected from the vibrating mirror were detected using  a selenium photocell which was then connected to a telephone. This showed that voice communication could be transmitted using light beams with a photocell used to convert it to an electrical signal. In another experiment, Bidwell placed a selenium photocell inside a rotating cylinder. A small hole in the cylinder allowed the photocell to scan an image on a brightly illuminated glass slide. Another rotating cylinder was covered with a paper treated with potassium iodide. The electrical signal from the photosignal was sent to a platinum wire that darkened the paper when current was applied. Bidwell's device did not solve the problem of synchronizing the transmitter and receiver. Both cylinders were on the same shaft. Similar devices for transmitting images had previously been demonstrated by Alexander Bain and Frederick Bakewell, but Bidwell was the first to use a photocell to scan the image.  Bidwell reported his results in an article entitled \"Tele-Photography\" in the February 10, 1881 issue of Nature. His device is displayed in the London Science Museum. In 1886, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.

Some scholars, notably Arthur McCallister, describe him as a lonely child without siblings; others believe him to have been the eldest of as many as seven brothers and sisters.Arthur McCallister Myth and Invention: Fantastical Inventions of the Nineteenth Century (New York: Maritime Press, 1994). It is however certain that by 1850 he was the only remaining Hopewell child. The profession of his father prior to the 1840s is unknown. However, based on several letters and daguerreotypes it is relatively certain that his father, Richard D. Hopewell, was excited by the prospect of photography\u2014so much so that he became a traveling photographer who circulated primarily through New York and New Jersey taking portraits in the towns he visited. While Jacob Hopewell's adolescence is shrouded in uncertainty, it can be sure that he attended the Great Exhibition of 1851 in London. It was there that he saw Frederick Bakewell's demonstration of the facsimile machine (an early precursor to the modern fax machine).
