Salmon crossed a wild Manitoban hop with cultivated English stock to create hybrid C9a, which was released to commercial cultivation in 1934 as Brewer's Gold. Though the original wild hop died during the winter of 1918\u201319, Brewer's Gold has become the ancestor of nearly every new high-alpha hop variety released since then.\nSalmon was born in Richmond, Surrey, England, in 1871 and held a number of research and teaching positions through his life. He was a researcher at the Kew Gardens from 1899 to 1906 and at Wye College from 1906 to 1937. Salmon was elected as the president of the British Mycological Society in 1911, he was appointed as a reader in mycology at London University in 1912 and was promoted to a full professorship there in 1925.As his obituaries noted, Salmon was an excellent tennis player.  He reached the Wimbledon men's singles quarter final in 1903.  Salmon did not marry and lived for most of his life in the village of Wye. He died in a Folkestone nursing home on October 12, 1959.", "link_mentions": {}}}
