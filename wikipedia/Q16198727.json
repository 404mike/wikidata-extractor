He is recorded in two first-class matches. In 1824, he played for Godalming Cricket Club against Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's Cricket Ground, scoring 2 in his sole innings. In 1827, Jupp played for All-England against Sussex at Darnall New Ground in the first of the roundarm trial matches, scoring 0 not out and 20.It is possible, but unconfirmed, that he was the father of England Test cricketer Harry Jupp, who was also from Dorking.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Hodges", "response": ["His bowling had both pace and movement and occasionally he could swing the ball sharply.  But it also lacked consistency and all the good work he showed previously rarely came to the fore in his two representative matches.  He bowled too short and was hit about the ground by some of the English batsmen.  Hodges got his chance to play in the inaugural Test when the more widely recognised bowler Frank Allan refused to travel to Melbourne from Warrnambool for the match.  Allan could not spare the time and thus Hodges bowled the very first ball for Australia in Test history and was unlucky not to take a wicket with it.  Newspaper reports suggested that an umpiring error saved the English batsman, Henry Jupp, after he dislodged the bails whilst attempting to play the ball.  Umpire Ben Terry, standing at square leg, did not see the incident and therefore Jupp survived."]}, {"page": "Amos Marshall", "response": ["His last game came against the South of England for the North of England at Lord's in May, 1875.   He was second top scorer, with 13, as James Southerton took 9 for 30 to bowl out the North for just 90.  Southerton was denied his tenth wicket only by the last man being run out.  Marshall took 1 wicket for 7 in 4.30, as the South were skittled in turn for 123.  Marshall was left not out 3 when the North again collapsed to 72 all out, with Southerton returning match figures of 16 for 55, and W. G. Grace and Henry Jupp scored the 41 needed to win by 10 wickets."]}, {"page": "List of English cricketers (1787\u20131825)", "response": ["|Henry Jupp"]}, {"page": "List of English cricketers (1826\u20131840)", "response": ["|Henry Jupp"]}]}}
