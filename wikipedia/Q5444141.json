The poll attracted over one million votes in 2015, making it the world's biggest music poll. Danny Rampling was the first to be named as the number one DJ in the world by the magazine's journalists in 1991. In 1992 Smokin Jo was named the number one DJ by the magazine editors and was the only female DJ to have ever earned the top ranking until Charlotte de Witte was crowned number one in 2020. In 1993 to celebrate the 100th edition of DJ Magazine, the magazine introduced a Top 100 list that was still compiled by its staff until 1996. For the previous five years, the system for nominee selection and voting to determine the winners was similar to that of current Grammy Awards and the Brit Awards in that dance music industry specialists (in this case music journalists) decided on who was nominated and who won the award. However, in 1997 the decision was taken by the publication to let the readers of the magazine decide who they thought was the world's top DJ, and in 1997 British DJ Carl Cox was the first winner of the Top 100 DJs Award by public vote. As of 2017, Fergie holds the record for the highest new entry in the poll's history, achieved when he placed 8th in 2000. Dutch DJ Armin van Buuren currently holds the record of most overall wins with five and a record four consecutively."]}, {"page": "Shine (nightclub)", "response": ["The club had no formal music policy, but techno was prevalent on most nights.

Improvements included an extra room of music being added to the two already in use (resulting in a lowered ceiling of the main room). Along with the club's name change, the 3 spaces inside were named the Oxygen Arena, the Nitrogen Room and the Carbon Lounge. The club features state-of-the-art lighting and sound systems.
