Impressed and frightful of the content, Whitman had doubts and asked himself if he was in the right business, but came to the conclusion that he could pull it off. Whitman's performance earned him rave reviews and an Oscar nomination for Best Actor. He said the film \"doubled my rating as an actor\". However, he later said, \"I had a tough time breaking my image in that movie... it blocked my image as a gutsy outdoorsman.\"", "Whitman said that when he first met Peter Falk on the set of Murder, Inc., they had their differences but eventually became friends.
