Upon his return to Britain his first book, the non-fiction The Biafra Story: The Making of an African Legend about that brutal civil war during which Nigeria fought to prevent the secession of its eastern province, was published as a paperback by Penguin Books in late 1969. To Forsyth's disappointment, however, the book sold very few copies and so with the arrival of the 1970s the then 31\u00a0year-old freelance journalist, international adventurer, and onetime youngest (at 19) fighter pilot in the RAF found himself both out of work and \"flat broke\". To solve his financial problems he thus decided to try his hand at fiction by writing a political thriller as a \"one-off\" project to \"clear his debts\". Unlike most novelists, however, Forsyth would employ the same type of research techniques that he had used as an investigative reporter to bring a sense of increased reality to his work of fiction, a story which he first began to consider writing in 1962\u20131963 while posted to Paris as a young Reuters foreign correspondent.", "The editors told Forsyth that they felt that these well-known facts essentially abrogated the suspense of his fictional assassination plot against de Gaulle as readers would already know it would not and could not possibly have been successful.Anderson, Hephzibah. \"Forsyth\u2019s Shadowy Jackal Celebrates 40 Years of Assassination: Interview\" Bloomberg News, 31 July 2011 (De Gaulle subsequently died of natural causes at his country home in Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises in November 1970 after peacefully retiring).\"France Mourns de Gaulle: World Leaders to Attend a Service at Notre Dame\".

He persuaded London based Hutchinson & Co. to take a chance on publishing his novel, however, they only agreed to a relatively small initial printing of just 8,000 copies for its 358-page red and gold clothbound first edition.
