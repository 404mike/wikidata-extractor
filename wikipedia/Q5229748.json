Tranmere had worn a kit of blue shirts, white shorts and blue socks since 1904\u00a0\u2013 the same colours as local rivals, Division One club Everton. Russell introduced an all-white strip to set the teams apart; these have been Tranmere's usual colours since. Russell also developed a successful youth policy which included England international Roy McFarland among its graduates. Russell guided Rovers back to Division Three in 1967, a year before a new 4,000-seater main stand was opened, and Rovers reached the fifth round of the FA Cup for the first time. Three years later the club's record attendance at Prenton Park was established as 24,424 supporters witnessed Rovers draw 2\u20132 with Stoke City in the FA Cup.", "Belmont F.C., the forerunners of today's Rovers, wore blue shirts and white shorts, as did the early Rovers, until a radical change in 1889, when a combination of maroon and orange shirts and navy blue shorts was introduced to \"dazzle\" their opponents in the West Lancashire League. These were abandoned in 1904 in favour of the earlier blue and white colours which have, in some form or other, remained until the present day. In 1962, Dave Russell introduced a white strip with blue trim, saying \"Tranmere Rovers should have a specific identity of its own, so on Merseyside there's now Liverpool's Red, Everton's blue and Tranmere's white\". Since then, the team have worn varying combinations of blue and white, moving back towards a more predominantly white kit in 2000. The team's colours are reflected in their nickname of the \"Superwhites\".", "By the start of the 2020-21 season, the club had had 30 managers. The first man to hold this position was Bert Cooke, appointed in 1912. He oversaw the club's entry into the Football League and remained in charge for 23 years, the longest spell of any manager at the club. Major changes were not seen until businessman Dave Russell took over in 1961. His introductions included the team's current all-white kit and regularly arranged floodlit home fixtures on Friday evenings rather than the usual Saturday afternoon. Rock band and Tranmere fans Half Man Half Biscuit described the practice in their song \"Friday Night And The Gates Are Low\"."]}, {"page": "Bury F.C.", "response": ["Bury won the Second Division title in 1894\u201395 and won their test match to secure promotion into the First Division.

This remains a record winning margin in an FA Cup final, equalled only once, when Manchester City beat Watford in the 2019 final. They were relegated to the Second Division at the end of the 1911\u201312 season, before securing promotion again in 1923\u201324. Bury lost their top-flight status in 1928\u201329 and have not returned. They dropped into the third tier in 1956\u201357, before winning promotion as champions of the Third Division under the stewardship of Dave Russell in 1960\u201361.

In the 1962\u201363 Football League Cup, they reached the semi-final but lost 4\u20133 on aggregate to eventual winners Birmingham City. For three seasons from 1963, Bury's best player was the future England midfielder Colin Bell, who was team captain while still a teenager. He transferred to Manchester City in 1966 and Bury were relegated the following season. They bounced straight back as Third Division runners-up in 1968 but went down again in 1969.", "Norman Bullock, who was the club's then-record goalscorer, took over in December 1935 but went to Chesterfield in June 1938. After the Second World War, Bullock returned to Bury until November 1949 when he went to Leicester City. The club's longest-serving manager has been Dave Russell for eight years from December 1953 to December 1961. The highlight of his career was winning the Third Division championship in 1960\u201361. Bob Stokoe was team manager twice between 1961 and 1978.

The supporters' association raised the \u00a315,000 cost of the new lights.

This allowed supporters to watch Tranmere on Fridays and First Division sides Everton or Liverpool on Saturdays. The idea was successful and continued until the 1990s.", "The Main Stand houses the VIP area, directors box and various suites. The Tranmere suite was added to the Main Stand in 1988, with the Dixie Dean suite, Bunny Bell bar and Dave Russell restaurant added soon after.
