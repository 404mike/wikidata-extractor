She continues to appear in the show, whenever a character visits her at her surgery, which is presumably in Hotton. She first appears when Jasmine Thomas visits her after she is too unwell to attend the funeral of Dawn Woods. Dr Abbott tells Jasmine that she is pregnant, but Jasmine doesn't believe it and leaves. Jasmine returns the following day and tells Dr Abbott that she had unprotected sex, and Dr Abbott advises Jasmine to book herself into an STD clinic as a precaution. Later, she visits a very weak Alice Dingle and tells Alice that she would like to admit her to hospital, but Alice doesn't want to."]}, {"page": "Betty Davies (radio)", "response": ["| Beatie Edney, Kate Maravan, James Fleet, David Sinclair, Rachel Atkins, Andrew Wincott, Neville Jason and John Evitts."]}]}}
