However, the broadcaster was hesitant on making the move, leading to the pair being approached by Channel 4, who eagerly liked the idea, and securing a deal from the producers to bring the programme to their channel. The move to television was initially hit with a problem, as while it was desired for the regular cast to appear on the first televised series, Fry had begun to dislike conducting improvisational comedy. The matter was resolved by allowing him to pull out, with Sessions convinced by Fry to remain as a regular performer for the first series. In addition, Sell was unable to perform on the programme, resulting in Richard Vranch  - a member of improvisational group, The Comedy Store Players, based at London's Comedy Store - becoming the resident musician for much of the programme's broadcast."]}, {"page": "Paul Merton", "response": ["He used his experiences at Maudsley as a key framework in his 2012 tour, Out of My Head.
