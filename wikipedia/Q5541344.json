Finding just fifty members for the '100 club', the financing was helped by a \u00a38,000 grant from The Football Association. In January the club initiated a fire-sale of players: Bill Pointon went to Queens Park Rangers for a then-club record five-figure fee, whilst Harry Hubbick was sold to Rochdale for around \u00a31,000. Meanwhile, the club transfer listed Palk, Aveyard, and Eric Eastwood (who all lived outside North Staffordshire); whilst Hulligan returned from injury. A two-month run without a win followed, in which Hodgson again experimented with the first eleven. This run finally ended with a 1\u20130 win over Notts County on 9 April. Nine days later at Ashton Gate, keeper Harry Prince was given a chance in place of regular George Heppell, who embarrassed himself by attempting to punch a forty-yard punt from Stone, only to miss the ball entirely and thereby concede the equalizer. Later in the month, Hodgson signed George King from Hull City for a four-figure fee.
