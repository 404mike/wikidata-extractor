He was the lead vocalist of the Beathovens.  He worked with Maurice Gibb between 1971 and 1973.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Bonham", "response": ["Bonham was born in 1948 in Redditch, Worcestershire, and took up drums at the age of five, receiving a snare drum at the age of 10 and a full drum set at the age of 15. He played with multiple local bands both at school and following school, eventually playing in two different bands with Robert Plant. Following the demise of the Yardbirds in 1968, Bonham joined Plant, guitarist Jimmy Page and bassist John Paul Jones to form Led Zeppelin. With the band, Bonham mostly showcased a hard-hitting hard rock style, but also handled funk and Latin-influenced grooves in later releases. Like Keith Moon of the Who, Bonham's drum set grew in size following the band's 1969 concert tours, including congas or timpani and a gong. His drum solo, \"Moby Dick\", was featured on the group's second album and was a staple of their concerts, often lasting over 20 minutes. Outside of Led Zeppelin, Bonham played drums for other artists, including the Family Dogg, Screaming Lord Sutch, Lulu, Jimmy Stevens and Wings. Bonham played with Led Zeppelin until his death at the age of 32, in September 1980 following a day of heavy drinking. The surviving members disbanded the group out of respect for Bonham after his death.", "In 1969, Bonham appeared on The Family Dogg's A Way of Life, with Page and Jones. Bonham also played for Screaming Lord Sutch on Lord Sutch and Heavy Friends in 1970. He played on Lulu's 1971 single \"Everybody Clap\", written by Maurice Gibb and Billy Lawrie. In 1972, he played on a Maurice Gibb-produced album by Jimmy Stevens called Don't Freak Me Out in the UK and Paid My Dues in the US, credited as \"Gemini\" (his star sign). He drummed for his Birmingham friend, Roy Wood, on \"Keep Your Hands on the Wheel\", a single subsequently released on his 1979 album, On the Road Again, and on Wings' album Back to the Egg on the tracks \"Rockestra Theme\" and \"So Glad to See You Here\". He was also featured on Paul McCartney & Wings' \"Beware My Love\" demo version first recorded in 1976; it remained unreleased until 2014 with the release of the album Wings at the Speed of Sound boxset. Bonham was the best man of Black Sabbath's Tony Iommi at his wedding ceremony."]}, {"page": "Maurice Gibb", "response": ["Around 1970, Gibb played piano on George Harrison's song \"Isn't It a Pity\" as a part of his first triple solo album, All Things Must Pass. In the recording studio he met Genesis' Phil Collins, Phil Spector, Ringo Starr, Billy Preston and Harrison. In 1971, he produced Lulu's 1971 song \"Everybody Clap\", which features Gibb on guitar, Leslie Harvey on guitar, former Manfred Mann and Cream member Jack Bruce on bass, and Led Zeppelin's John Bonham on drums. Bonham and his wife, Pat Philips became friends with Gibb and Lulu. Also in that year, he played bass on Billy Lawrie's 1973 song \"Freedom\". Future Wings and former Thunderclap Newman guitarist Jimmy McCulloch played guitar on that song, and McCulloch suggests that it was recorded at around the same time as Lulu's \"Everybody Clap\", with Stone the Crows' Maggie Bell providing backing vocals. On 17 January 1972, Gibb produced, with Billy Lawrie, \"Baby Come on Home\", released as a single also in that year. In April 1972, Gibb produced Jimmy Stevens' album Don't Freak Me Out (called Paid My Dues in US). The same year, Gibb produced Drift Away, an album released by Bob Saker and Mike Berry; it includes a cover version of \"On Time\". In 1973, Gibb produced and played bass on Jimmy Stevens' unreleased numbers with musicians Alan Kendall, Jimmy McCulloch, Pete Willsher, Zoot Money and singer Paul Jones. In August 1973, Gibb participated on Andy Gibb's first recording session, performing two new songs."]}, {"page": "List of Peel sessions", "response": ["* Jimmy Stevens: (2 sessions, 1972\u201373)"]}, {"page": "Smokestack Lightning (album)", "response": ["#\"Tears\" (Jimmy Stevens) - 4:12  "]}, {"page": "Don't Freak Me Out", "response": ["Don't Freak Me Out is the first and only album released by English musician Jimmy Stevens in 1972.
