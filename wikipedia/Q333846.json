Since 1987, he has been the Member of Parliament (MP) for Wokingham in Berkshire. He was formerly Secretary of State for Wales in the Major government and was twice an unsuccessful candidate for the leadership of the Conservative Party in the 1990s. He subsequently served in the Shadow Cabinets of William Hague and Michael Howard, and has remained a backbencher since then.\nRedwood is a veteran Eurosceptic who was described in 1993 as a \"pragmatic Thatcherite\". He was the co-chairman of the Conservative Party's Policy Review Group on Economic Competitiveness until 2010. He has the role of Chief Global Strategist of investment management company Charles Stanley & Co Ltd (part of Charles Stanley Group). Redwood is a long-term critic of the European Union and of the United Kingdom's former membership of it. He supported Brexit in the 2016 EU referendum, and is a member of the British Eurosceptic pressure group Leave Means Leave.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau", "response": ["The existence of a separate national anthem for Wales has not always been apparent to those from outside the country.

According to John Major's autobiography, the first thing Redwood's successor William Hague said, on being appointed, was that he had better find someone to teach him the words.

This did not lead to an improvement in his political standing, and by December 1996, the Government had lost its majority in the House of Commons. At the 1997 election, after the Conservatives had been in power for 18 years, Major lost to Tony Blair's Labour Party in one of the largest electoral defeats since the 1832 Great Reform Act.

The Tories remained divided over this era and with an attempt to silence his critics, Major resigned as Party leader. In the leadership election, Major comfortably beat John Redwood in June 1995.
