Prior to this, it had been featured on the Fourth & Broadway/Island compilation \"The Rebirth Of Cool Six\". Lead singer Nina Miranda, who was living in Brazil at the time, was asked to return to London to discuss signing the project. Miranda and Smoke City were later based in London, but their interests were in Brazil. Miranda was proud that they had success in Portugal as that country was \"in the middle of what we're about\".

New Musical Express commended its mixture of \"dub and Brazilian touches and healthy helpings of sleaze\", whilst The Pitch Online called the song \"a perfect reprieve from the steel bars of winter into a humid rainforest of resonating vocals and music\" and praised the vocals of Nina Miranda, noting that \"even better than her exotic purring of the English hook would be when she transitions to a string of spoken Portuguese without using her full singing voice\". In addition, Tom Bromley, author of We Could Have Been the Wombles, described the song as having \"a fantastic feel: the hypnotically plucked guitar, the funky drum loop, a judicious mix of Brazilian beats and sonar bleeps, wafts of organ and hints of Herbie Hancock [are] all topped off by Nina's mesmeric vocals\"."]}, {"page": "Nublu Records", "response": ["3 Na Massa was founded in Sao Paulo, Brazil, by producer Rica Amabis, and the Silva brothers, drummer Pupillo and bass-player, Sucinto.
