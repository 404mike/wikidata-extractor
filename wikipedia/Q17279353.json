Gaining a regular team place with Stoke Potters in 1974 he rode in 35 meetings, raising his average to 5.87. The same year, he had one match for Belle Vue Aces but had only 2 rides, failing to score in either.\n\nIn 1975 he rode still for Stoke Potters and over 14 meetings, having 50 rides, he raised his points average to 7.92. He had 2 meetings for Cradley Heathens where he managed 5 rides.\nHarry Bastable brought him to Oxford Cheetahs in their first year of National League in 1976, the Rebels having moved to White City with Danny Dunton. Steve became a crowd favourite, not just by riding but by living locally and getting involved off-track, such as dee-jaying at the Supporters Club, and, in Easter 1976, taking chocolate eggs to the children's ward of the John Radcliffe Hospital. With Cliff Anderson, he worked on track maintenance, looking after safety features such as boarding up the wire fencing, which had to be put up and taken down at every meeting so as not to obscure the view of the greyhound track on their race nights.Before speedway, Steve had been a Private in the Royal Corps of Signals, following an apprenticeship as a Hydraulic Fitter.\nHe  lived in Wolverhampton with his family until his death in hospital in the early hours of 13 December 2014.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Oxford Cheetahs", "response": ["|   || Mick Handley || Phil Bass ||  Pip Lamb || Roy Sizmore || Steve Holden"]}, {"page": "Steve Holden", "response": ["Steve Holden may refer to:", "* Steve Holden (American football) (born 1951), American football player", "* Steve Holden (speedway rider) (1952\u20132014), British speedway rider", "* Steve Holden (One Life to Live), a fictional character from the American soap opera One Life to Live"]}]}}
