He soon became associated with the more openly Nazi wing under Colin Jordan and took an active role in his and John Tyndall's attempts to set up a paramilitary wing, Spearhead. Pirie was arrested at one of their drills in 1961 and was sentenced to three months imprisonment for his role. After the court passed sentence Pirie gave a Hitler salute to the court.After his release from prison Pirie followed Jordan and Tyndall into the National Socialist Movement in 1962. Whilst here, he joined Tyndall in attempting to procure funds from Egypt for the NSM, although nothing came of this. During the quarrel between Jordan and Tyndall, Pirie largely sided with Tyndall and so followed him into the Greater Britain Movement in 1964. Pirie joined the National Front at the same time as the rest of the GBM and continued to feature prominently, gaining a seat on the NF Directorate. Pirie was dismissed from the Directorate in 1973 after it came to light that he attended celebrations for Hitler's birthday, although he had regained his place by the following year.Around this time, Pirie enrolled as a mature student at the University of Sussex and soon became friendly with Richard Lawson, a young activist in the NF. Pirie's political outlook changed and he abandoned the neo-Nazism which had previously defined his politics, adopting a Strasserite outlook and becoming associated with this faction. Grouped around The Beacon, a party newspaper, the Strasserites initially represented an independent faction within the NF but soon became associated with the populists of John Kingsley Read in his struggle against Tyndall. As a result, Pirie became a founder member of the National Party and took a leading role in this group during its fairly brief existence. Following its collapse he became involved with the League of Saint George for a time.When the National Party foundered, Pirie left active politics until the mid-1980s when he collaborated with Martin Webster in organising Our Nation. Initially taking a leading role in the group, Pirie's involvement was curtailed when the press leaked the story of his membership of the group while working in a potentially sensitive role as a civil servant in Whitehall. With Our Nation holding only a few meetings and Pirie's involvement compromised by the press leak, he retired from active politics after this incident.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "British Movement", "response": ["The NSM had come to an end sometime after Colin Jordan was imprisoned in early 1967 for distributing a racist leaflet The Coloured Invasion and following his release Jordan had met John Tyndall in Denis Pirie's house about the possibility of joining the National Front.Martin Walker, The National Front, Glasgow: Fontana, 1977, p. 77 These talks came to nothing however and with the Race Relations Act 1968 passed the notion of openly parading Nazi credentials in a party name had to be abandoned, leading to Jordan forming a new group to known as the British Movement.R.

A journalist commented in 1962 that Jordan was becoming the British Adolf Hitler. Bean jokingly responded to the Daily Mail reporter that that made him \"the British Joseph Goebbels\". Despite this, Bean soon clashed with Jordan over his extremism and before long Jordan had left to form the National Socialist Movement, taking emerging figures John Tyndall and Denis Pirie with him. Matters had come to a head at the party's national council meeting in 1962 when Bean proposed a motion to condemn Jordan's open support for Nazism. It was passed 7 to 5, but the party immediately split as a result, albeit with around 80% of the membership remaining within the BNP.Walker, The National Front, p. 37 Bean had blamed the associations with Nazism that Jordan and Tyndall brought for the party's marginal position in British politics.Macklin, Very Deeply Dyed in Black, p. 55"]}, {"page": "National Party (UK, 1976)", "response": ["* Denis Pirie, a veteran of the National Socialist Movement, though he later distanced himself from his extremist past."]}]}}
