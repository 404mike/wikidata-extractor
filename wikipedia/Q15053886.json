First marketed in Britain it was soon exported throughout the British Commonwealth and became a worldwide brand between 1934 and 1967. The name derived from Bakelite, one of the world's first commercial plastics that was originally used to manufacture many of the parts. Bayko was one of the world's earliest plastic toys to be marketed.", ":See Charles Plimpton for early Bayko history.", "The Bayko system was invented and patented by Charles Plimpton in 1933, following a long period of convalescence in Ruthin in North Wales.  Plimpton set up Plimpton Engineering in Liverpool, England, to manufacture the components, the majority of which were made from Bakelite, a new synthetic plastic developed in the early 1900s.  The sets were called \"Bayko Light Construction Sets\" (the term \"Bayko Light\" coming from the name \"Bakelite\") and went on sale nationally towards the end of 1934. There had been, however, limited production, with sets literally packed on the kitchen table, 12 months earlier, presumably for a restricted, local market.  The Bakelite material was sourced from Bakelite Limited, a Birmingham supplier, and for the first few years of its life, Bayko was marketed by both Plimpton Engineering and Bakelite Limited.", "Charles Plimpton died of tuberculosis in December 1948 and his wife, Audrey Plimpton took over the running of Plimpton Engineering.", "Further new parts were added to the sets in 1949 and 1950, probably from Charles Plimpton's innovation stream, were introduced to increase the realism and flexibility of the system.  Although the initial plans had been for a further two sets, the range was completed in 1952 when \"set 4\" was introduced, which included all the parts except turrets."]}, {"page": "Charles Bird Plimpton", "response": ["#REDIRECT Charles Plimpton "]}, {"page": "Plimpton Engineering", "response": ["#REDIRECT Charles Plimpton"]}, {"page": "List of British innovations and discoveries", "response": ["*Bayko \u2013 Charles Plimpton"]}, {"page": "Plimpton", "response": ["* Charles Plimpton (1894\u20131948), English businessman"]}, {"page": "Plimpton, Charles", "response": ["#redirectCharles Plimpton"]}]}}
