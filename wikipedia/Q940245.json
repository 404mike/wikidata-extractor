Aldridge also received 30 caps for the Republic of Ireland, and was the first Tranmere player to score at a World Cup.

The home leg was won 3\u20131 by Tranmere, with Villa scoring their only goal in the 94th minute. The away leg was 2\u20131 to Villa until the 88th minute with Villa finally winning 3\u20131, so the match went to extra time and penalties.

Towards the end of the season, Celtic legend Billy McNeill took charge but left for Aberdeen after only a few months at the helm.

The subculture originated in the United Kingdom in the early 1980s when many hooligans started wearing designer clothing labels and expensive sportswear such as Stone Island, CP Company, Lacoste, Sergio Tacchini, Fila,  Hackett & Fred Perry in order to avoid the attention of police and to intimidate rivals. They did not wear club colours, so it was easier to infiltrate rival groups and to enter pubs. Some casuals have worn clothing items similar to those worn by mods. Casuals have been portrayed in films and television programmes such as ID, The Firm, The Football Factory, and Green Street. The documentary Casuals: The Story of the Legendary Terrace Fashion featuring Pat Nevin, Peter Hooton and Gary Bushell amongst others is about the fashion that started in the late 70s and into the 1980s."]}, {"page": "Robert Huth", "response": ["On 29 October 2016, Huth fouled Vincent Janssen in a 1\u20131 draw away at Tottenham Hotspur to concede his first penalty since January 2013.
