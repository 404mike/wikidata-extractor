When the ships sailed Nott stated that they carried their \"full range of weapons\" and were \"sailing under wartime orders with wartime stocks of weapons\". The government stated that nuclear weapons were not applicable to the Falklands conflict but did not deny their presence.  The Observer at the time reported that nuclear weapons were almost certainly present on some of the ships and its correspondent, Andrew Wilson, claimed to have spoken to one frigate captain who refused to leave for war without his complement of tactical nuclear weapons.  Wilson reported that the task force was carrying nuclear depth charges for the Westland Sea King helicopters and free-fall bombs for the Harrier jets which were part of their usual NATO equipment.  Sheffield was reportedly one of the vessels carrying nuclear depth charges.  According to Member of Parliament Tam Dalyell some of the weapons were recovered from outward bound ships by helicopter when the ships were in the Western Approaches, by a Ministry of Defence concerned about sending such a large proportion of its nuclear arsenal away from the UK.  Paul Rogers claims that a number of nuclear weapons which reached Ascension Island were offloaded to RFA Regent which was kept outside the conflict zone.  Some reports claim that Sheffield and Coventry were still carrying nuclear depth charges when sunk though Rogers considers this unlikely."]}]}}
