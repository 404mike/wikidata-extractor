He was the professor at the University of Belgrade Faculty of Law (1897\u20141940), Rector of the University of Belgrade (1913\u201314 and 1920\u201321), and the President of the Serbian Royal Academy (1928\u20131931).

The leader of the anti-Simovi\u0107 group was the historian Slobodan Jovanovi\u0107 who served as deputy prime minister, who was widely respected as an distinguished scholar, a liberal and a Serb opposed to the more chauvinistic Serb nationalists, giving him a degree of credibility with the non-Serb ministers. Peter's own relations with Simovi\u0107 became strained as he found Simovi\u0107 to be too dominating and resented being \"lectured\" by his prime minister, who felt he had a duty to \"tutor\" the teenage king in the ways of statecraft and politics.", "The instructions given by the prime minister Slobodan Jovanovi\u0107 to Mihailovi\u0107 in January 1942 were to protect the pre\u010dani Serbs from the massacres being waged by the Ustashe, but otherwise he was not to engage in any actions that would bring down reprisals against civilians unless absolutely necessary while at the same time he was to build up his forces to engage in a general uprising when the Allies landed in the Balkans. In October 1941, Mihailovi\u0107 had already decided upon a policy of limiting the Chetniks to sabotage attacks and of building up his forces for an uprising when the Allies returned to the Balkans. The German policy that for every German soldier killed, 100 Serb civilians would be shot in reprisal and for every wounded German soldier, 50 Serb civilians would be shot in reprisal worked to deter Chetniks from attacking the Wehrmacht after October 1941 as Mihailovi\u0107 concluded that guerrilla attacks were not worth the reprisals.", "After signing the accord, King Peter and King George II of Greece spoke to the British press at a luncheon where the two kings spoke of the \"Balkan Union\" as being open to all of the states of the Balkans. On 11 January 1942, Peter dismissed his prime minister, General Du\u0161an Simovi\u0107, who proved himself to be an inept politician who was unable to get along with his cabinet, which had been threatening to all jointly resign since late 1941 if General Simovi\u0107 continued as prime minister. The new prime minister was Slobodan Jovanovi\u0107, a widely respected historian. ", "The cabinet in a rare show of unity had all objected to Peter's plans for a wedding in wartime when the issue was first discussed in April 1942, and the issue was not raised again until April 1943. Again, when the matter was discussed in early 1943 the Serb ministers had objected while from Serbia itself General Mihailovi\u0107 reported that public opinion strongly disapproved. The Prime Minister, Slobodan Jovanovi\u0107, was opposed to announcing the engagement while Yugoslavia was still occupied, predicting the news would discredit the monarchy in Serbia, and rather than postpone the engagement, which was announced in July 1943, Peter dismissed Jovanovi\u0107 on 26 June 1943."]}, {"page": "Kingdom of Yugoslavia", "response": ["* 1942\u20131943 \u2013 Slobodan Jovanovi\u0107"]}, {"page": "List of people from Serbia", "response": ["*Slobodan Jovanovi\u0107", "*Slobodan Jovanovi\u0107"]}, {"page": "List of jurists", "response": ["* Slobodan Jovanovi\u0107"]}, {"page": "Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107", "response": ["Mihailovi\u0107 did not resume radio transmissions with the Allies before January 1942. In early 1942, the Yugoslav government-in-exile reorganized and appointed Slobodan Jovanovi\u0107 as prime minister, and the cabinet declared the strengthening of Mihailovi\u0107's position as one of its primary goals. It also unsuccessfully sought to obtain support from both the Americans and the British. On 11 January, Mihailovi\u0107 was named \"Minister of the Army, Navy and Air Forces\" by the government-in-exile. The British had suspended support in late 1941 following Hudson's reports of the conflict between the Chetniks and Partisans. Mihailovi\u0107, infuriated by Hudson's recommendations, denied Hudson radio access and had no contact with him through the first months of 1942. Although Mihailovi\u0107 was in hiding, by March the Nedi\u0107 government located him, and a meeting sanctioned by the German occupation took place between him and A\u0107imovi\u0107. According to historian Jozo Tomasevich, following this meeting, General Bader was informed that Mihailovi\u0107 was willing to put himself at the disposal of the Nedi\u0107 government in the fight against the communists, but Bader refused his offer. In April 1942, Mihailovi\u0107, still hiding in Serbia, resumed contact with British envoy Hudson, who was also able to resume his radio transmission to Allied headquarters in Cairo, using Mihailovi\u0107's transmitter. In May, the British resumed sending assistance to the Chetniks, although only to a small extent, with a single airdrop on 30 March. Mihailovi\u0107 subsequently left for Montenegro, arriving there on 1 June. He established his headquarters there and on 10 June was formally appointed as Chief-of-Staff of the Supreme Command of the Yugoslav Army in the Fatherland. A week later he was promoted to the rank of General of the Army. The Partisans, in the meantime, insisted to the Soviets that Mihailovi\u0107 was a traitor and a collaborator, and should be condemned as such. The Soviets initially saw no need for it, and their propaganda kept supporting Mihailovi\u0107. Eventually, on 6 July 1942, the station Radio Free Yugoslavia, located in the Comintern building in Moscow, broadcast a resolution from Yugoslav \"patriots\" in Montenegro and Bosnia labelling Mihailovi\u0107 a collaborator.", "The trial of Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107 opened on 10 June 1946. His co-defendants were other prominent figures of the Chetnik movement as well as members of the Yugoslav government-in-exile, such as Slobodan Jovanovi\u0107, who were tried in absentia, but also members of ZBOR and of the Nedi\u0107 regime. The main prosecutor was Milo\u0161 Mini\u0107, later Minister of Foreign Affairs in the Yugoslav government. The Allied airmen he had rescued in 1944 were not allowed to testify in his favour. Mihailovi\u0107 evaded several questions by accusing some of his subordinates of incompetence and disregard of his orders. The trial shows, according to Jozo Tomasevich, that he never had firm and full control over his local commanders. A Committee for the Fair Trial of General Mihailovi\u0107 was set up in the United States, but to no avail. Mihailovi\u0107 is quoted as saying, in his final statement, \"I wanted much; I began much; but the gale of the world carried away me and my work.\""]}, {"page": "Serbian dinar", "response": ["|Slobodan Jovanovi\u0107 (1869 \u2013 1958), jurist, historian and politician"]}, {"page": "Milan I of Serbia", "response": ["Several months later, on 6 October, Prince Milan was involved in another incident, this time during a visit to Smederevo.

As he was armed at the time, the prince began shooting from his pistol in order get the attention of his entourage who rescued him. Historical accounts of the nature of this event differ.

The divisions deepened as the HSS ministers displayed reluctance to publicly discuss and condemn Usta\u0161e atrocities against Serbs in autumn of 1941. In January 1942, Simovi\u0107 was replaced by Slobodan Jovanovi\u0107 and his decision to support the Chetniks widened the rift with the HSS ministers. Jovanovi\u0107 saw Chetniks as a guerrilla force promising restoration of the monarchy after the war. In combination with fear of communism, this led him to ignore information about Chetnik collaboration with the Axis powers, and appoint their leader Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107 the Minister of the Army, Navy and Air Forces. At the same time, the government promoted Mihailovi\u0107 to the rank of Army General and formally renamed the Chetniks the \"Yugoslav Army in the Homeland\". In June 1943, Jovanovi\u0107 resigned unable to reunite the ministers, and his replacement Milo\u0161 Trifunovi\u0107 also resigned after less than two months of failing to resolve the same problem. In August, Bo\u017eidar Puri\u0107 was appointed the prime minister of a largely administrative government mostly composed of civil servants, although Mihailovi\u0107 retained his ministerial position."]}]}}
