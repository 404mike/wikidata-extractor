The match is notable for being one of the few occasions in the history of the FA Cup where a non-league club has defeated a team in the top tier of English football.", "As extra time began, a dense cloud of fog descended onto the pitch, almost forcing the match to be abandoned. Towards the end of the first period of extra time, a mishit pass from Len Shackleton fell to Ray Wright, playing Eric Bryant through on goal, who found the net to put Yeovil back into the lead. With 15 minutes remaining to hold onto their lead, Yeovil were now on the back foot, with the superior fitness of Sunderland's professional players beginning to tell. Three minutes from time, the referee blew for a free kick to Sunderland. The Yeovil supporters, thinking the whistle had been blown for full-time, prematurely invaded the pitch in celebration, threatening to abandon the game once more. Order was eventually restored, allowing the final minutes of the game to be played.", "| FW || 9 || Eric Bryant"]}, {"page": "Eric Bryant", "response": ["Eric Bryant may refer to:", "* Eric Bryant (cricketer) (1936\u20131999), English cricketer", "* Eric Bryant (footballer) (1921\u20131995), footballer for various English clubs"]}, {"page": "1946\u201347 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Eric Bryant"]}, {"page": "1947\u201348 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Eric Bryant"]}]}}
