In these definitions, the Romanian Old Kingdom also includes areas of Transylvania and Bukovina still under Romanian rule after 1940. Reflecting on this fact, Lucian Boia noted that Antonescu could not \"decently\" be viewed as a rescuer of Jews, but that there still is a fundamental difference between the effects of his rule and those of Hitler's, concluding that the overall picture is not \"completely dark.\"Boia, pp. 260\u2013261 For Dennis Deletant, this situation is a \"major paradox\" of Antonescu's time in power: \"more Jews survived under [Antonescu's] rule than in any other country within Axis Europe.\" American historian of Romania William O. Oldson views Antonescu's policies as characterized by \"violence, inconsistency and inanity\",Oldson, p. 162 but places them in the wider context of local antisemitism, noting some ideological exceptions from their respective European counterparts. These traits, he argues, became \"providential\" for the more assimilated Jewish communities of the Old Romanian Kingdom, while exposing Jews perceived as foreign.Deletant, pp. 275, 354; Oldson, pp. 4\u201311, 161\u2013163 Discussing Antonescu's policy of ethnic cleansing, Polonksy and Mihlic note: \"[it] raises important questions about the thin line between the desire to expel an unwanted minority and a small-scale genocidal project under sanctioned conditions.\" American military historian Gerhard L. Weinberg made reference to the Antonescu regime's \"slaughter of large number of Jews in the areas ceded to the Soviet Union in 1940 when those areas were retaken in 1941 as well as in [...] Transnistria\", but commented: \"the government of Marshal Ion Antonescu preferred to rob and persecute Jews [from Romania]; the government would not turn them over to the Germans for killing.\"", "*Dennis Deletant, Hitler's Forgotten Ally: Ion Antonescu and His Regime, Romania, 1940\u20131944, Palgrave Macmillan, London, 2006.

He only aimed at legitimizing the elite whose leader he was and which he propelled out of communism to a new era essentially defined by violence, abuse and repression, as it was obvious already by 1990-91. For purposes of revealing such interest groups, the political scientist risked both his name and life. Both his results in the academic field and his unwavering determination must be appreciated and treasured, more so considering the insults and calumny showered upon him by the post-communist clique and their followers in the mass-media.

Gallagher himself noted that the initiative was motivated by \"the need to display solidarity in order to prevent the replacement of democracy with the collective autocracy of economic barons and their political allies.
