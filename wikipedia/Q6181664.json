Much of his work focused on musical subjects.\nHis reputation was made with the Beats of the Heart series, which introduced elements of what is now called world music, and its performers, to the Western world. Rhythms of Resistance, a film in the series, was where Paul Simon first saw Ladysmith Black Mambazo, who played a prominent role on Simon\u2019s Graceland album. The New York Times said of Beats of the Heart: \"It can make your jaw drop regularly with astonishment.\" He has run director courses for the National Film and Television School, sat on the advisory boards for the British Library Sound Archive and the Arts Council of England, has broadcast widely on BBC radio, has written for The Times, New York Post and The Independent.\nThere have been retrospectives of his music films at the Florence Film Festival and on Channel 4.In 2016, Marre was the first recipient of a new lifetime achievement award bestowed jointly by Arizona State University and Arizona Humanities.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "James Brown", "response": ["Brown continued making recordings. In 1993 his album Universal James was released. It included his final Billboard charting single, \"Can't Get Any Harder\", which peaked at No. 76 on the US R&B chart and reached No. 59 on the UK chart. Its brief charting in the UK was probably due to the success of a remixed version of \"I Feel Good\" featuring Dakeyne. Brown also released the singles \"How Long\" and \"Georgia-Lina\", which failed to chart. In 1995, Brown returned to the Apollo and recorded Live at the Apollo 1995. It included a studio track titled \"Respect Me\", which was released as a single; again it failed to chart. Brown's final studio albums, I'm Back and The Next Step, were released in 1998 and 2002 respectively. I'm Back featured the song \"Funk on Ah Roll\", which peaked at No. 40 in the UK but did not chart in his native US. The Next Step included Brown's final single, \"Killing Is Out, School Is In\". Both albums were produced by Derrick Monk. Brown's concert success, however, remained unabated and he kept up with a grueling schedule throughout the remainder of his life, living up to his previous nickname, \"The Hardest Working Man in Show Business\", in spite of his advanced age. In 2003, Brown participated in the PBS American Masters television documentary James Brown: Soul Survivor, which was directed by Jeremy Marre."]}, {"page": "Reggae", "response": ["In 1973, the film The Harder They Come starring Jimmy Cliff was released and introduced Jamaican music to cinema audiences outside Jamaica.Steffens, Roger. \u2018The Harder They Come: 30 Years After.\u201d The Beat 22.1 (2003): p. 36 Though the film achieved cult status its limited appeal meant that it had a smaller impact than Eric Clapton's 1974 cover of Bob Marley's \"I Shot the Sheriff\" which made it onto the playlists of mainstream rock and pop radio stations worldwide. Clapton's \"I Shot The Sheriff\" used modern rock production and recording techniques and faithfully retained most of the original reggae elements; it was a breakthrough pastiche devoid of any parody and played an important part in bringing the music of Bob Marley to a wider rock audience.
