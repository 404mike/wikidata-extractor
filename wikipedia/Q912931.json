These included a new introduction, vocal harmony, an instrumental interlude, small lyric changes and removal of the half-step modulation for the last verse. Although Murray disliked their changes, the decision not to release the Beatles' version was primarily a business one.Lewisohn (2013), p. 699 In fact, George Martin came very close to issuing \"How Do You Do It?\" as the Beatles' first single before settling instead on \"Love Me Do\", recorded during the same sessions.

They were also to present themselves as all things to all men and women, \"direct[ing] Beatle-esque grins\" at the audience and avoiding controversy. To this end he attempted to stop band members swearing on stage, to which Jagger muttered \"bloody hell\". Easton retorted, \"bloody hell, you don't say\". He considered that compromises had to be made before the British public would accept them: their long hair was an obvious target. For their first photoshoot, Easton bought the band shiny waistcoats, white shirts, slim-jim ties, black trousers and Cuban-heeled boots. Among the band, says rock journalist Paul Trynka, Jones was \"the most enthusiastic about the new managers; that spring of 1963 he remained the Stone with whom Oldham and Easton would huddle and share plans\". Easton ensured that the group's money was kept in discrete bank accounts, in order to lower their collective tax bill (although in the event, he overlooked that they would also be liable for tax on touring income). Easton also arranged generous credit with fashionable stores in London; this, says Sandford, allowed Jagger and Richards \"to run up impressive bills that they waved away airily on presentation\"."]}]}}
