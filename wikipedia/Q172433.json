This left Graham Hill the fastest on track, taking the lead at the start and also setting a new lap record. The leading pack also included John Surtees (Lola), Jim Clark (Lotus), and Bruce McLaren (Cooper). These four pulled steadily away from Jack Brabham (Lotus) and Dan Gurney (Porsche). After only nine laps Brabham was out of the race with a broken rear suspension, while McLaren lost fourth gear and spun off the track, rejoining the race far down the field. Surtees had to stop four laps later with ignition problems, but was back on track in eighth place. Hill had pulled out a twenty-second lead ahead of Clark, but on the thirtieth lap he made contact with Jackie Lewis' Cooper when lapping him, allowing Clark to pass. Hill gave chase, netting the lap record, and re-took the lead on lap 33. On the next lap, Clark had to stop with a broken front suspension. Hill and BRM looked sure to win, but on lap 42 he stopped in a hairpin with fuel injection and throttle linkage troubles; he lost several laps and ended up dead last after also having stopped in the hairpin to pick up the engine cover that he had left behind during his earlier visit there.", "|  Jackie Lewis", "|  Jackie Lewis"]}, {"page": "1962 British Grand Prix", "response": ["It was not a particularly exciting race, with Clark leading from start to finish and fairly large gaps between the cars. Out of the twentyone starters, six still had four-cylinder engines while the rest were multi-cylinder cars. These cars were in a sort of class of their own, with Jackie Lewis finishing best of the four-cylinder cars.Blunsden, p. 32 John Surtees' Lola started and finished in second place, in spite of having lost second gear on the tenth lap. Dan Gurney was hopeful after winning in France and at the non-championship Solitude race in the preceding two weeks. He began the race in third but had a slipping clutch and slid steadily down the field, ending in ninth position.Blunsden, p. 18 His teammate Jo Bonnier had to retire with a broken transmission. Bruce McLaren (Cooper) passed Gurney after twelve laps and finished in third. Graham Hill pushed his BRM hard but had to settle for fourth, and was threatened by Jack Brabham in the closing stages. Brabham, however, had burns on his right foot since lap 40 and was in a lot of pain. He finished fifth, ahead of Tony Maggs' Cooper. Brabham had hoped to start in his own car after his mechanics had worked days and nights, but at 3 am the morning before the race it was discovered that they had been supplied with the wrong exhaust system. The Brabham BT3 had to wait until N\u00fcrburgring two weeks later to make its first appearance.Blunsden, p. 33", "|  Jackie Lewis", "|  Jackie Lewis"]}, {"page": "1962 German Grand Prix", "response": ["|  Jackie Lewis", "|  Jackie Lewis"]}, {"page": "1962 Formula One season", "response": ["|rowspan=2|  Jackie Lewis", "|align=\"left\"|  Jackie Lewis"]}, {"page": "1961 Formula One season", "response": ["|  Jackie Lewis", "|align=\"left\"|  Jackie Lewis"]}, {"page": "Lewis (surname)", "response": ["*Jackie Lewis (born 1936), British racing driver"]}, {"page": "Harry Hibbs (footballer)", "response": ["In August 1944, Hibbs became manager of Walsall for seven years.
