One episode featured Judi Dench in the role of a delinquent. This character inspired Hopkins to write what is probably his best remembered work for the small screen, the four-part play sequence Talking to a Stranger (1966) directed by Christopher Morahan, with whom he had developed a rapport while working with him on Z-Cars. Starring Dench, and Michael Bryant, as the adult children of characters played by Maurice Denham, and Margery Mason, Talking to a Stranger was transmitted as part of BBC2's Theatre 625 anthology series. The plays told the story of one bleak weekend from the viewpoints of the four individuals. It won the British Directors' Guild Writers' Award and an Emmy in 1968 after the sequence was shown on American television. Critic George Melly described in The Observer as \"[t]he first authentic masterpiece written directly for television\". Two Wednesday Plays from this period by Hopkins were Fable from January 1965 and Horror of Darkness broadcast the following March. The former imagines an inverted South African apartheid in Britain (which was postponed by the BBC in case it affected a by-election), while the latter is a rare exploration of homosexuality in the 1960s. Hour of Darkness featured Glenda Jackson and Nicol Williamson in the lead roles."]}, {"page": "Peak Practice", "response": ["*Alice North \u2013 Margery Mason"]}, {"page": "The Listerdale Mystery", "response": ["Margery Mason as Mrs. Lithinglow"]}, {"page": "Pink Floyd \u2013 The Wall", "response": ["* Margery Mason as Teacher's wife"]}, {"page": "A Family at War", "response": ["* Margery Mason as Celia Porter", "All episodes of A Family at War are available on DVD in the UK, distributed by Acorn Media UK, but with several of the episodes edited from their original running times.
