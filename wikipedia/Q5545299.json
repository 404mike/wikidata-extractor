He is credited as being one of the discoverers of the flower Layia gaillardioides, as a result having the genus Layia named for him.\nHe then went on to become a missionary in China for the British and Foreign Bible Society from 1836 to 1839.  During this time, he studied the Chinese language and culture.  Upon returning to England in 1839, his experience in China helped him obtain a position of British Consul in China.  He was posted in Canton in 1843, then Foochow in 1844, and finally Amoy in 1845, before dying later that year from a fever.\nHis son, Horatio Nelson Lay following in his footsteps, was also a diplomat in China.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Horatio Nelson Lay", "response": ["Horatio Nelson Lay was born in Forest Hill to George Tradescant Lay, a naturalist and missionary, who served as British consul in the treaty port of Amoy in China.
