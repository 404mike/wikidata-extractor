He continued attempting to strengthen the squad throughout February, with loan signings Albert Jarrett and Luke Medley from Lincoln and Mansfield respectively, though neither had a large impact on the team with only a handful of appearances between them. Holdsworth also signed former \"Shots\" goalkeeper Mikhael Jaimez-Ruiz, who made 62 appearances in a previous spell at the club.

Dillon responded by urging fans to be \"realistic\", while goalkeeper Jamie Young called for fans to get behind the team. The club's woes were compounded by striker Marvin Morgan sparking controversy over his comments on social networking site Twitter, resulting in the player being transfer-listed and quickly moved out on loan to Dagenham & Redbridge. A fourth straight home reverse to Oxford followed, and proved to be Dillon's last game as manager, as he and assistant Gary Owers left by mutual consent on 10 January, the club citing the team's poor league performance as a major contributing factor in the decision.
