The reports were then confirmed by Sexton and Racing Metro after talks with the IRFU over a new contract had broken down. Sexton joined fellow British & Irish Lions teammates Jamie Roberts and Dan Lydiate as the club's marquee signings for the 2013\u201314 season, while his former adversary for the Irish 10 jersey Ronan O'Gara was confirmed as a coach for the club. Sexton stated that he had been unaware of O'Gara's arrival, but was happy at the news as both men had developed a good working friendship in their later years together in the Ireland set-up, despite a reportedly fractious early relationship during Sexton's emergence."]}]}}
