His idiosyncratic left-wing nationalism led to comparison with the French politician Jean-Pierre Chev\u00e8nement. He was described in an obituary by the Conservative journalist Patrick Cosgrave as \"Between Harold Wilson and Tony Blair, the only possible Labour Party leader of whom a Conservative leader had cause to walk in fear\" and, along with Enoch Powell, \"the most captivating rhetorician of the age\".", "link_mentions": {}}}
