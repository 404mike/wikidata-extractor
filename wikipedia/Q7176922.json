His idiosyncratic left-wing nationalism led to comparison with the French politician Jean-Pierre Chev\u00e8nement. He was described in an obituary by the Conservative journalist Patrick Cosgrave as \"Between Harold Wilson and Tony Blair, the only possible Labour Party leader of whom a Conservative leader had cause to walk in fear\" and, along with Enoch Powell, \"the most captivating rhetorician of the age\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Michael Foot", "response": ["The Bennites were demanding revenge for what they considered to be the betrayals of the Callaghan government. They called for MPs who had acquiesced in Callaghan's policies to be replaced by left-wingers who would support unilateral nuclear disarmament, withdrawal from the European Communities, and widespread nationalisation. Benn did not stand for the leadership; apart from Foot and Healey, the other candidates (both eliminated in the first round) were John Silkin, a Tribunite like Foot, and Peter Shore, a Eurosceptic."]}, {"page": "Enoch Powell", "response": ["During the 1975 referendum on British membership of the EEC, Powell campaigned for a 'No' vote. Powell was one of the few prominent supporters of the 'No' camp, with Michael Foot, Tony Benn, Peter Shore, and Barbara Castle. The electorate voted 'Yes' by a margin of more than two to one.Mark Baimbridge, The 1975 Referendum on Europe \u2013 Volume 2: Current Analysis and Lessons (2015), p. 10.David Butler and Uwe Kitzinger, The 1975 Referendum (Macmillan, 1976), pp. 178, 194."]}, {"page": "James Callaghan", "response": ["Notwithstanding electoral defeat, Callaghan stayed on as Labour leader until 15 October 1980, shortly after the party conference had voted for a new system of election by electoral college involving the individual members and trade unions. His resignation ensured that his successor would be elected by MPs only. Following a campaign that laid bare the deep internal divisions of the parliamentary Labour Party, Michael Foot narrowly defeated Denis Healey on 10 November in the second round of the election to succeed Callaghan as party leader. Foot had been a relatively late entrant to the contest and his decision to stand ended the chances of Peter Shore."]}, {"page": "Michael Heseltine", "response": ["The Permanent Under-Secretary at the Environment Department, Sir John Garlick, described Heseltine's arrival as a change from \"a very conservative Labour Secretary of State [Peter Shore] to a very radical Conservative Secretary of State\". On his first day Heseltine took him out to lunch at the Connaught and drew up a list of what he wanted to accomplish in office (the list appears in Heseltine's book Where There's A Will, and was returned to him at the end of his time at the Environment). Only a quarter of Heseltine's agenda consisted of manifesto commitments and other political goals; the rest of it consisted of administrative and organisational changes. Peter Hennessy observed that Heseltine was more interested in the nuts and bolts of Whitehall reform than any minister since David Lloyd George. Heseltine was quite ruthless about moving civil servants with whom he was dissatisfied, but nonetheless staff thought he had mellowed somewhat since the early 1970s, and was more relaxed and fun to work with. His permanent secretaries Sir John Garlick and Sir George Moseley thought highly of him. He preferred to reach decisions through informal discussion rather than wading through paperwork. He instituted Peter Walker's custom of morning \"prayer\" meetings (ministers and PPSs with no civil servants present), now common in Whitehall but an innovation at the time.Crick 1997, pp. 201\u20134.", "Heseltine became the troubleshooter to deal with the explosion of violence in Britain's inner cities in the aftermath of the Brixton and Toxteth riots of 1981. Unemployment had reached 20% in Liverpool, and 60% among young blacks in Toxteth. Tear gas had had to be used, and the Cabinet contemplated deploying the Army. A few weeks before the riots, a Cabinet thinktank had proposed that the area be left to go into \"managed decline\". Thatcher visited Merseyside and it was decided that a minister should go for a longer visit. Heseltine was already chairman of the Merseyside Partnership, set up his predecessor Peter Shore, to channel government money into Liverpool (six other partnerships existed).Crick 1997, pp. 221\u20132."]}, {"page": "Great Yarmouth", "response": ["*Peter Shore (1924\u20132001), Labour MP and cabinet ministerHANSARD 1803\u20132005, Mr Peter Shore.

The other competitors were Neil Kinnock, Peter Shore, and Eric Heffer. Hattersley had the support of most of the Shadow Cabinet, but the majority of the PLP, the constituency groups and the unions were in favour of Kinnock. In the final count Kinnock secured around three times as many votes as the second-place Hattersley. As was standard practice at the time, Hattersley was elected deputy leader. The combination was promoted at the time as being a \"dream ticket\" with Kinnock a representative of the left of the party and Hattersley of the right.
