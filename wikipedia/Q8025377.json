Rachmaninov also made recordings of Tausig's transcription of Schumann's Der Kontrabandiste (also recorded by Josef Lh\u00e9vinne, Josef Hofmann, and Emil Gilels) and Tausig's Pastorale in E minor, adaptated from Scarlatti's harpsichord Sonata, L. 413, the latter also being popular with several other pianists of that era, including Vladimir Horowitz. The Bach Toccata and Fugue in D minor adaptation and the Schubert/Tausig Marche Militaire were also quite popular in recordings, the latter being recorded by Eugen d'Albert, Leopold Godowsky, Mischa Levitzki, Lh\u00e9vinne, Ignaz Friedman, Egon Petri, Wilhelm Backhaus, Alexander Brailowsky, Horowitz, and Gy\u00f6rgy Cziffra. Most of those pianists recorded other Tausig works as well, such as Lh\u00e9vinne's rare recording of the Hungarian Gypsy Dances. Benno Moiseiwitsch recorded Tausig's piano arrangement of Weber's orchestral Invitation to the Dance.

Marie was a very talented pianist who had been playing in public since the age of twelve and had even had the privilege of playing in duet with Paderewski Ignacy Jan Paderewski. She was married to the Armenian WWI hero and writer Levon Tutundjian [de Vartavan] and lived in Lausanne with him in Cornette de Bise. She taught at the Ribeaupierre Institute, a higher music school in Lausanne founded in 1915 by Mathilde and \u00c9mile de Ribeaupierre. The same year Em\u00e1nuel Mo\u00f3r sparked a lively controversy in the world of music by presenting two revolutionary inventions in quick succession. First, \"a giant violin, one and a half meters long, with five to six strings to reach the length of the cello, the bow being moved by a pedal\". The possibility of his employment in the orchestra prompted ironic comments from a critic of the Lausanne Gazette. Marie, for her part, worked with Moor's wife, Winifred Christie, to operate the second invention, a piano with two keyboards, the lower keyboard of which has its raised white keys to allow chromatic glissando and a pedal intermediate coupling the two keyboards - not to mention an ingenious system which made it possible to imitate a harpsichord. Marie Tutundjian played with it on 03-11-1921 at the Palace of Montreux and at least once again on 16-11-1921 [La Musique dans le Canton de Vaud (1904-1938), p.\u00a0146. See pages 251, 252 on Marie Tutundjian/de Jarowslawska], but these trials, if they left a trace in music history were not repeated [Encyclop\u00e9die de la musique, 2e partie, vol. 3, p.\u00a02080-2081].
