Because he was unable to accept responsibility for his wife's death, Thomas blamed John and the pair grew up with a deep dislike for one another.

In the meanwhile, Gemma, hearing about her uncle's return from the Fates, tries to kill herself with a poisonous revolver, but Constantine sneaks the last remaining dart from his niece.

John suggests he let her be, but Gemma fears he will return and put her life to misery. John tells Gemma to make her own decision, and she reluctantly points the revolver at him.

In the process John loses his memory, setting up the events leading up to the 200th issue. Leading up to the landmark issue, John has little control over events, and is led along by a psychic serial killer, who threatens to kill Chas and his family, and a demon, Rosacarnis, who offers his memories back, at the cost of 24 hours in her service.

The comic mixed supernatural and real life horror, akin to contemporary gothic, with noire, surrealism and occult detective fiction elements. Unlike other comic books, it is also unique as it follows real time in its span of 20 years, with its protagonist John Constantine aging in every publication. Because of this, writers of the series often place their era's culture and social commentary in their run. When Jamie Delano first wrote the series in the late 1980s and early 1990s, his issues were heavily inspired by the era such as punk rock and the British economy. Delano would be the first to put his political views in the series, such as his negative views of Thatcher's regime and by 2005 includes the War on Terror. This made John Constantine different from other comic book characters at that time, in that he fights the political and social injustice of Great Britain.", "Jamie Delano's original run on the title is looked on fondly, with journalist Helen Braithwaite stating, \"His take on the character of John Constantine has never been equalled. Delano's Original Sins graphic novel should be in every comic book fan's collection.\" She added that, \"His writing evokes an incredible sense of dread and terror in a reader.\" IGN listed the title as one of the 25 Best Vertigo Books, calling John Constantine as \"one of Vertigo's best characters.\" December 19, 2005", "The comic book's initial cancellation, and the introduction of the character to DC led to many negative feedback and reception.

November 8, 2012 As a result, DC co-publisher Dan Didio issued a statement defending this decision, stating that, \"Hellblazer's had a long and incredibly successful run and that's a tip of the hat to all the great creators that have worked on the book over the years. The new Constantine series will return him back to his roots in the DCU and hopefully be the start of another incredible run.\" November 9, 2012 Comic Alliance described Hellblazer's cancellation as marking \"the end of an era for Vertigo\" while adding it to be \"one of a handful of comics from the late eighties that helped comic books and their readers grow up.\" February 21, 2013", "Hellblazer boosted the popularity and image of the occult detective fiction genre and shaped it to its modern form.
