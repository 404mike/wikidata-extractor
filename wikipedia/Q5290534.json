His work includes the arrangement of the Doctor Who theme music which served as the series' theme for Season 23 of the programme. It was replaced by Keff McCulloch's arrangement the next season. He also wrote the incidental music for the Doctor Who stories The Mysterious Planet, The Ultimate Foe, Dragonfire, The Happiness Patrol and Survival. Big Finish Productions has used his arrangement of the theme on several audio plays featuring the Sixth Doctor, starting with Jubilee in 2003.\nIn 2007, Glynn wrote and performed the score for the British crime thriller Bad Day, starring Claire Goose and Donna Air and Sarah Harding. As a regular writer for Universal Music Publishing Group, and other production music libraries, his music has featured in episodes of The Simpsons, Red Dwarf, Episodes and Eerie Indiana, and the feature films Holy Man and Kevin & Perry Go Large.\nIn 2005/2006, his composition \"Dangerous Beauty\" was used as the theme to the hit Dutch television thriller series, Vuurzee. A number of his production music tracks have been aired on the Adult Swim TV channel \"bumps\".\nGlynn has also been active in the alternative electronica field, running the left field record label, No Bones Records and recording under the names Fluid and Cybajaz and, with Justin Mackay, as Syzygy. Much of his work as Syzygy was released during the 1990s on Rising High Records. He also co-composed the score of the video game Forsaken (performing as The Swarm) and also contributed music for Re-Volt, both published by Acclaim Entertainment. He has collaborated with Michael Faulkner's D-Fuse AV in both live performance and music videos, and has been seen regularly as both artist and DJ at The Big Chill.\nGlynn has written soundtrack music for many of B7 Productions's audio plays, based on the BBC TV series Blake's 7, which subsequently were aired on BBC Radio 4 Extra. A long-term working relationship with the filmmaker, Anthony Baxter, has resulted in musical contributions to the film, You've Been Trumped, as well as complete scores to A Dangerous Game and the 2016 sequel, You've Been Trumped Too.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Doctor Who", "response": ["A different arrangement was recorded by Peter Howell for season 18 (1980), which was in turn replaced by Dominic Glynn's arrangement for the season-long serial The Trial of a Time Lord in season 23 (1986).

He signed a contract with Time Warner, the parent company of WCW, and went through more training at the WCW Power Plant. Wright made his WCW debut, defeating Brady Boone on the September 3rd edition of Saturday Night. He originally wrestled as a babyface and was known as \"Das Wunderkind\" Alex Wright. His entrance music (\"Warped Mind\" by Dominic Glynn), was of the techno genre, which was popular in some American and German dance clubs at the time, and he often danced as he walked to the ring or once he got in the ring. His first feud was with Jean-Paul Levesque, whom he defeated at Starrcade in December in both men's pay-per-view debut. In his early career, Wright went undefeated in matches against several WCW superstars including Bobby Eaton in January 1995 at Clash of the Champions XXX and Paul Roma at SuperBrawl V in February '95. However, the latter saw Roma's contract later terminated by WCW because of his stiff performance and his disregard of instructions to put Wright over during the match. WCW had Wright feud on and off with Disco Inferno, another wrestler who danced in or on his way to the ring, with Wright representing modern dancing and music, and Disco representing older styles.
