In this modern soil, which is a ground of alluvium brought by the waters of both the Alfeios and those which came down from the sandy mountains that surround the valley, one should not look for traces of the hippodrome and the stadium, since this land did not exist when there was a stadium and an hippodrome.\" Abel Blouet, 1831, v.
