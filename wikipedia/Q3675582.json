Two notable projects that Whitten was the drummer for were Paul McCartney's Flowers in the Dirt album in 1989, and Dire Straits\u2019 final world tour from 1991\u20131992 to accompany their last studio album, On Every Street. He also played drums on some tracks of the album Titanic (1982) by the Italian songwriter Francesco De Gregori. Whitten was also a member of the Catch, with Don Snow.\nWhitten unusually has used a Noble & Cooley drum kit which are radically designed drums. The toms and snare are single-ply, steam-bent shells which give them (especially the snare) a distinctive sound. He has also recorded with such varied musicians as Tom Jones, Johnny Cash, the Pretenders, Swing Out Sister, ABC and the The and for Jean-Jacques Goldman for the Rouge album with Fredericks Goldman Jones.\nWhitten has been an active participant and Honorary VIP Member of the Drummer Cafe community forum since 2003.\nHe is a specialist at drum sample production and has contributed drums and percussion with recording partner, the British engineer/producer Peter Henderson of Supertramp fame for the Toontrack drum sample libraries Custom and Vintage SDX and The Classic EZX, as well as several others.\nHe toured with The Dire Straits Experience and visited India to perform at a charity event in Gurgaon and Bangalore in March 2017.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dire Straits", "response": ["In early 1991, Dire Straits reunited. Retaining Bicknell as their manager, Dire Straits comprised only four members once again: Clark, Fletcher, Illsley and Knopfler. The band began recording a new album, produced by Knopfler, Clark and Fletcher, integrating new session musicians, including steel guitarist Paul Franklin and percussionist Danny Cummings. Saxophonist Chris White returned, and guitarist Phil Palmer filled the vacancy left by Sonni. The new album also included Toto drummer Jeff Porcaro, and session drummer Chris Whitten joined the band for the subsequent world tour.", "With Chris Whitten added to the lineup, Dire Straits embarked on a world tour to promote the album, which lasted until October 1992. The On Every Street Tour featured 300 shows in front of some 7.1 million ticket-buying fans. While musically more elaborate than the previous 1985\u201386 world tour, the band's gruelling final tour was not as critically acclaimed nor as successful commercially. This proved to be too much for Dire Straits, and by this time Mark Knopfler had had enough of such massive operations. This led to the second and final break-up. Bill Flanagan described the sequence of events in GQ: \"The subsequent world tour lasted nearly two years, made mountains of money and drove Dire Straits into the ground. When the tour was over, both Knopfler's marriage and his band were gone.\""]}, {"page": "Mark Knopfler", "response": ["The follow-up to Brothers in Arms was finally released in September 1991. On Every Street was nowhere near as popular as its predecessor, and met with a mixed critical reaction, with some reviewers regarding the album as an underwhelming comeback after a six-year break. Nonetheless, the album sold well and reached No. 1 in the UK. Session drummer Chris Whitten joined Dire Straits as they embarked on a gruelling world tour featuring 300 shows in front of some 7.1 million ticket-buying fans. This was to be Dire Straits' final world tour; it was not as well received as the previous Brothers in Arms tour, and by this time Mark Knopfler had had enough of such huge operations. Manager Ed Bicknell is quoted as saying \"The last tour was utter misery. Whatever the zeitgeist was that we had been part of, it had passed.\" John Illsley agreed, saying \"Personal relationships were in trouble and it put a terrible strain on everybody, emotionally and physically. We were changed by it.\" This drove the band into the ground, and ultimately led to the group's final dissolution in 1995."]}, {"page": "The Waterboys", "response": ["The Waterboys (officially a trio of Scott, Thistlethwaite and Wallinger, with a slew of guests) released their third album, This Is the Sea, in October 1985. It sold better than either of the two earlier albums, and managed to get into the Top Forty. A single from it, \"The Whole of the Moon\", reached number 26 in the UK. Promotion efforts were hampered by Scott's refusal to perform on Top of the Pops, which insisted that its performers lip sync. The album release was followed by successful tours of the UK and North America, with Wickham becoming a full-time member, Marco Sin replacing Martyn Swain on bass, and Chris Whitten replacing Kevin Wilkinson on drums. Towards the end of the tour Wallinger left to form his own band, World Party, and was replaced by Guy Chambers. At the same time, drummer Dave Ruffy replaced Chris Whitten."]}, {"page": "Julian Cope", "response": ["World Shut Your Mouth was followed six months later by 1984's Fried album for which Cope was joined by Skinner, Lovell, St John, ex-Waterboys drummer Chris Whitten and Wah! guitarist Steve \"Brother Johnno\" Johnson. The album was much more raw in approach than its predecessor, and although in many respects it prefigured the looser and more mystical style which Cope would follow and be praised for in the next decade, it sold poorly at the time (as did the accompanying single \"Sunspots\"). Notoriously, the sleeve featured a naked Cope crouched on top of the Alvecote Mound slag heap clad only in a large turtle shell.Julian Cope entry in The Rough Guide to Rock, 3rd edition, page 226 (2003), ed. Peter Buckley (article written by Nig Hodgkins) The album includes a song called Bill Drummond Said about Cope's A&R man at WEA, to which future KLF star Drummond responded with a song titled Julian Cope Is Dead, pondering how much more famous Cope might have been had he been shot at the height of his fame. The commercial failure of Fried led to Polygram dropping Cope; he subsequently engaged a new manager Cally Callomon, and signed a deal with Island Records."]}, {"page": "Edie Brickell & New Bohemians", "response": ["* Chris Whitten \u2013 drums"]}, {"page": "This Is the Sea", "response": ["The first recording session for This Is the Sea began in March 1985 at Park Gates Studio in Hastings, England with engineer and producer John Brand.  Band members Scott, Anthony Thistlethwaite, Karl Wallinger, Chris Whitten, and Roddy Lorimer performed the new material.  Wallinger's home studio heard demo recordings for a number of the album's songs.  Some of the recordings, like the ones of the last two albums, are relatively untouched by studio engineering.  On other recordings, however, Scott added a drum machine and layered the sound, using a studio technique similar to that of the famous record producer Phil Spector, with help from Wallinger.  \"Having Karl [Wallinger] in the studio\", writes Scott, \"was like having a one-man orchestra around.
