The term millefiori is a combination of the Italian words \"mille\" (thousand) and \"fiori\" (flowers).

His initial celebrity can be largely attributed to the enthusiastic backing of influential Christians\u2014particularly the editors of the evangelical newspaper The World as well as the leadership of the Philo-Judaean Society. Philo-Judaeans were ostensibly devoted to the material and educational welfare of London's impoverished Jews but nevertheless harbored conversionist goals. In contrast Levy sought tangible relief for his fellow Jews, most of whom dwelt in the East End slums, but steadfastly rejected the tactics of conversion. Striking an unprecedented diplomatic balance, Levy was able to rise within the reform ranks and still retain a staunchly Jewish persona. His prominent Philo-Judaean supporters included the radical evangelical and former Tory MP Henry Drummond; the decorative glass manufacturer Apsley Pellatt; and the Anglican clergyman Hugh McNeile (also M'Neile). Levy's first major address before the organization, held at Freemasons' Hall in May 1827, stressed the commonality of the Judaeo-Christian tradition, condemned antisemitism, and challenged Christians to end \"the persecution of contempt.\" (The World (London), 20 June 1827) Positive press coverage presented Levy as an admired orator, philanthropist, and promoter of inter-faith relations. Millennialist zeal contributed to Levy's notoriety and some viewed his actions as \"extraordinary signs of the times\" and proof that \"something most singular is approaching\" (ibid., 9 January 1828). Previously any public notice among Anglo-Jewry was purposely avoided and debates with gentiles were considered anathema\u2014a passive strategy that emerged after centuries of Old World oppression."]}, {"page": "Apsley", "response": ["* Apsley Pellatt, an English glassware manufacturer and politician", "** Apsley Pellatt (1763\u20131826), his father"]}, {"page": "Pellatt", "response": ["*Apsley Pellatt (1791\u20131863), English glassware manufacturer and politician", "*Apsley Pellatt (1763\u20131826), (1763\u20131826), English glass manufacturer"]}, {"page": "George Caldwell (cricketer)", "response": ["Caldwell wrote articles about sport for The Field and Bell's Life in London under the pseudonym Childers and for Spirit of the Times in New York under the name Censor.

Miles Taylor says of those elected in 1852 - who included James Bell, William Biggs, Lawrence Heyworth and Apsley Pellatt - that they \"were either almost completely silent, or became tongue-tied in the House of Commons when it came to taking the lead in church reform\".
