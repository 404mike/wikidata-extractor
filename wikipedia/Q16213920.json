Previously he raced in the 2004 Renault Clio Cup, having a successful season with two race wins and a final point standing of fifth. He stepped up to the BTCC the next year with a drive in a Lexus IS200 for the HPI Racing with Friends Reunited team. The car was uncompetitive and well off the pace of the front running teams. He only had the funding for selected races through the season and finished down in seventeenth in a field of just eighteen drivers with three points.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2005 British Touring Car Championship", "response": ["Two new squads joined the series, both on very low budgets.
