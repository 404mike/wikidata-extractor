The band consisted mostly of ex-students of the Glasgow School of Art, Initial band members were Will Bradley (drums), Chris Evans (bass) and Robert Johnston (guitar). Painter Sue Tompkins (vocals) joined later in 1999. The band split writing duties, with Johnston, Bradley and Evans writing the music while Tompkins wrote the vocals. Tompkins' \"talk-sung\" vocal styling eventually became the band's most famous attribute. Impressed after their first London gig, the Rough Trade-affiliated Tugboat label asked the band to record a debut single."]}, {"page": "Any Other City", "response": ["Sue Tompkins' unique vocal style was singled out in multiple reviews. While John Mulvey of NME compared Tompkins' voice to \"the scrape of fingernails on a blackboard,\" opining that \"only mad people and immediate family could warm to Tompkins,\" other critics were more receptive. Jenn Sikes of Splendid praised Tompkins' vocals, stating, \"The chewed word-bits are like little metronomes, counting beats between her  words, which are spoken/sung in a cheery Scottish accent that's childlike but fierce.\" Kellman commented that \"[h]er repet-pet-petitive repetitive style might be at odds with the ears of some listeners, but it's just as unique as the exuberant vocals\" employed by Tompkins' influences. Connor McEleney of Structured Harmony praised bassist Chris Evans by describing him as \"the stronghold underneath which Tompkins makes her unique sound palatable.\"", "*Chris Evans \u2013 bass"]}, {"page": "Objectif Exhibitions", "response": ["* Chris Evans (2009)", "Mai Abu ElDahab, Binna Choi, Emily Pethick, \"Circular Facts,\" Mai Abu ElDahab, \"From Berkeley to Berkeley: Objectif Exhibitions 2008\u20132010,\" Chris Evans, Will Holder, Lisette Smits, \"Goofy Audit,\" Hassan Khan, \"The Agreement,\" Michael Portnoy, \"Script opposition in Late-Model Carrot Jokes\""]}, {"page": "De Ateliers", "response": ["*Chris Evans "]}]}}
