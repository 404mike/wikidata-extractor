H. Robins, was an English cricketer and sports promoter, at one time chairman of Coventry City Football Club. He was born in Bexleyheath, Kent.\nRobins played two matches for Warwickshire in 1947, but did little and never played county cricket again. Extraordinarily, his third first-class appearance would come 22 years later, when he appeared for his own \"D. H. Robins' XI\" against the touring West Indians at The Saffrons, Eastbourne. Robins made two further appearances for his own XI, against Oxford University in 1969 and against the Indians in 1971, the latter game coming a few days after his 57th birthday.\nHowever, he was better known as the promoter who took several strong sides to apartheid South Africa in the 1970s. Between 1972/73 and 1975/76 a D. H. Robins' XI played in the country each winter. In those days there were no sanctions against cricketers who visited South Africa, and Robins' teams included players of high quality, including such names as Bob Willis, Brian Close, Tony Greig and Trevor Chappell. Detailed accounts of these matches can be found in the International cricket in South Africa from 1971 to 1981 article.\nHe also took first-class teams to Sri Lanka in 1977\u201378 and New Zealand in 1979\u201380.\nHe died in South Africa at the age of 89.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ken Barrington", "response": ["Barrington managed the Derrick Robins XI tour of South Africa, a multiracial cricket team led by Brian Close and including Younis Ahmed, John Shepherd and Gordon Greenidge in an attempt to restore cricket links with South Africa.

However, friction was developing between him and the club. During the season Willis took 31 Championship wickets at 28.83, but found himself unable to accept the contract offered to him by the club. Though the county was reluctant to lose him, Willis sought another club. He took two wickets in his final match for Surrey against Hampshire on 11 September 1971. After turning down Leicestershire and Lancashire he signed for Warwickshire, for whom he had immediate success, with 25 wickets at 29.28, including one five-wicket haul (taking five wickets in one innings). Willis, who under rules then applying was banned from playing for his new county before July, helped Warwickshire win the 1972 Championship, thus achieving the unusual feat of winning the Championship in consecutive years with two different counties. In his final match of the season, he took 8/44 to demolish Derbyshire. His new team won nine of their 20 matches, drew 11 and lost none. He was not selected for the 1972 Ashes series in England, and travelled to South Africa as part of Derrick Robins' invitation XI in January. On the tour Willis took 13 wickets from the six matches."]}, {"page": "Brian Close", "response": ["In 1972/73 Close led a two-match tour of the \"International Wanderers\" to Rhodesia.

The apartheid policy followed by the South African Governments of the day meant that no Test match playing nation was willing to tour, thereby depriving world cricket of leading stars such as Graeme Pollock, Barry Richards, Clive Rice and Eddie Barlow.", "However the first \"international\" games played by South Africa post-isolation occurred after this. Derrick Robins, a millionaire businessman and chairman of Coventry City Football Club, had organised a number of private cricket tours in the past, arranged a tour to South Africa that took place between 1 January and 6 February 1973. His XI included many England Test players, who \u2013 unlike the 1981/2 South African tourists like Gooch and Underwood \u2013 did not suffer bans as a result of touring. Robins' aim was for his XI \"to do so well that you will invite us back again\". His players were also aware that England's Test selectors would notice how they performed.", "At the start of the next South African season, Derrick Robins took another group of tourists to South Africa. Only Mike Smith and John Lever of those who toured earlier in 1973 went on this tour. Whilst the other players on the team were mostly English, there were also a number of players from other countries. Most notably the tour included Pakistani Younis Ahmed and West Indian John Shepherd.

In addition, the following also toured: Malcolm Francke (Sri Lanka/Australia), Geoff Greenidge (West Indies), Tony Greig (South African-born England player), Jackie Hampshire, Frank Hayes, Eddie Hemmings, Terry Jenner (Australia), John Lyon, Clive Radley, Stephen Rouse, John Steele, Stuart Turner, Max Walker (Australia).", "*St George's Park article on Derrick Robins' XI of January-February 1973 (Retrieved on 4 February 2005)"]}, {"page": "South Africa women's national cricket team", "response": ["Although the D'Oliveira affair had drawn international condemnation, cricket administrators in England and Australia were reluctant to sever their playing links with South Africa.  Other international sports had already cut their ties with the country, exclusion from the 1964 and 1968 Olympics were followed by expulsion from the Olympic Movement in 1970.  Later in the same year South African athletes were suspended from international competition by the International Amateur Athletics Federation.  The invitation for the South African men's tour of England was initially maintained, but threats of physical disruption to matches from anti-apartheid militants saw the British government step-in to cancel the tour.  In May 1970, the Cricket Council made the decision that there should be no further tours to and from South Africa until cricket within the country was played on a multi-racial basis, and the national team was selected purely on merit.  In 1976, three different organisations; the South Africa Cricket Association (SACA), South African Board of Cricket Control (SACBOC) and the South African African Cricket Board (SAACB) agreed to establish one single board to govern South African cricket, and that all future cricket in the country would be played on an integrated basis regardless of race or colour.  The new governing body; the South African Cricket Union formally took over the running of cricket in the republic in September 1977.  However, a group within the SACBOC did not recognise this body, and set up a rival organisation, the South African Cricket Board, led by Hassan Howa, who claimed that there could be \"no normal sport in an abnormal society\".Williams (2001), p. 85.  The International Cricket Conference (ICC) imposed a moratorium on tours in 1970.Booth (1998), p. 99.  Despite the official boycott, cricket tours of South Africa did continue.

He was a right-arm fast-medium bowler who moved the ball off the seam and became among the most effective bowlers in English county cricket during the 1970s. Presumably because his batting was impotent as shown by his highest first-class score in more than 200 matches being 26, Lee appears never to have been considered seriously for Test cricket.

Arriving in 1961, Hill and club chairman Derrick Robins led a revival of the club's fortunes which culminated in promotion to Division One in 1967. During their promotion season, the club went 25 games undefeated and reportedly attracted a crowd of over 50,000 spectators for a match with Wolverhampton Wanderers.", "The return to third-tier football led to a dramatic decline in attendance at Highfield Road, with average gates dropping from 22,000 to 13,000. This placed a strain on the club's finances, and they were forced to sell winger Norman Lockhart to Aston Villa for \u00a315,500. They finished in a reasonable sixth-place in their first season in the division but poor form returned in the 1953\u201354 campaign. With the club lying in the bottom half of the table, manager Harry Storer left in early November. According to the club he had resigned, but Storer himself described his departure as a sacking. The team was run by the board for a two months, after which Jack Fairbrother took over as manager. In April 1954 a new board was elected following a contentious annual general meeting. The new board was led by Erle Shanks and also featured Derrick Robins, who would later go on to become a highly influential figure in the club. Fairbrother signed some new players in the close season and the 1954\u201355 season started brightly with six wins in seven games, but they then failed to win in the following five. Fairbrother then left the club on 27 October, officially for health reasons \u2013 his wife had been killed in an accident earlier in the year and he had been under considerable stress. But newspaper reports at the time suggested that he may have been ousted by the board as a result of the club's recent downturn in form.", "Despite an early-season blip, which saw Coventry occupy their lowest-ever league position of 91st after three games, the club's stay in Division Four limited to just one season. Finances were extremely tight but Frith made some shrewd low-cost signings, including Irish international Reg Ryan, Alan Daley, and Accrington's George Stewart. When the club's goalkeeper, Jim Sanders, broke his leg in September Frith persuaded 44-year-old Alf Wood, who played his first game in 1938 and had returned to the club as a trainer, to take his place. Wood played ten games, of which the team lost only one, before being replaced with the signing of Arthur Lightening. Frith's tactics paid off, and City were promoted in second place, behind Port Vale. Coventry's good form continued in the 1959\u201360 season, and they were a contender for a second-successive promotion until Easter. But a run of three defeats in the final matches meant that they missed out. Once more in a perilous financial situation, Coventry started 1960\u201361 poorly with only four wins in the first sixteen games. They rallied in the middle part of the season, but another poor run consigned them to a poor finish. The most significant aspect of the season was that Walter Brandish was replaced by Derrick Robins as club chairman; it was under Robins' chairmanship that the club's fortunes were transformed.", "Three months after Cantwell's departure, Joe Mercer and Gordon Milne were appointed as joint managers of the club. City had offered the job to Brian Clough, who said that he had been very tempted to take it, but he instead opted to remain at Derby. They started out the 1972\u201373 season with the existing squad, seeking to play in what Mercer called \"the attractive way\". But after failing to win any of the first six games, they began a series of transfers to reshape the team. Notable incoming players included Colin Stein and Tommy Hutchison, both of whom would go on to become highly popular with the supporters, while Jeff Blockley was sold to Arsenal for a club-record \u00a3200,000. The changes worked, as City went eight games unbeaten, including a 2\u20130 win at Arsenal featuring a much-lauded Hutchison goal. They also progressed to the FA Cup quarter final for the third time, but a poor performance at Wolverhampton Wanderers ended that run. League form also suffered and the club finished 19th. The following season started brightly, and wins at home to Liverpool, Manchester City and Derby put City in the top five after ten games. They progressed to the quarter-final of the League Cup and the fifth round of the FA Cup, but suffered narrow defeats in both. The league ended disappointingly again with a 16th-place finish. The club were plunged into financial difficulties in 1974. They purchased Larry Lloyd from Tottenham for \u00a3240,000, with Mick McGuire and Jimmy Holmes due to be sold in the other direction for \u00a3200,000, but the latter deal fell through after the former was already completed and Coventry faced a huge deficit. Derrick Robins left the club in April 1975 due a relocation to South Africa, ending a fifteen-year career at the helm which had transformed the club's history. Joe Mercer left his management position to become a club director at the same time, leaving Milne in sole charge of the team.

On what was known as 'Black Saturday', 25 November 1961, Coventry were dumped out of the FA Cup by non-league King's Lynn, and Frith was sacked by chairman Derrick Robins. He was replaced by Jimmy Hill, who took Coventry to a fourteenth-place finish in 1961\u201362.
