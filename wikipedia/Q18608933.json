Thompson, a large plantation that included the ancient city of Chichen Itza. There he studied the Maya language and traveled the countryside collecting folk tales and oral histories. During one of his seasons at Chichen Itza he helped Thompson dredge the Cenote Sagrado; at the end of another, he carried artifacts to the Peabody Museum in his luggage.McVicker, Mary (2005).

University of New Mexico Press.", "From the beginning of his professional career, Tozzer began to shift more to archaeology and away from ethnography. During his seasons at Chichen, he assisted Adela Breton with her copies of reliefs, and Thompson who was making paper molds. During his time with the Lacandons he discovered and explored ruins that today share the name of the Rio Tzendales. In the summer of 1907, he joined Dixon, Alfred Kidder and Sylvanus Morley on a purely archaeological expedition to Rito de los Frijoles in New Mexico (today part of Bandelier National Monument)."]}, {"page": "Guachimontones", "response": ["The earliest documentation of Los Guachimontones comes from Victorian artist Adela Breton. Breton traveled through the Tequila Valleys region in the 1890s. During her travels, near the town of San Marcos Breton documented a mound in the process of being destroyed that contained several burials, hollow ceramic figures, and shell ornaments.Adela C. Breton (1903). Some Mexican Portrait Clay Figures. Man 3: 130-133.Mary Frech McVicker (2005). Adela Breton: A Victorian artist amid Mexico's ruins. UNM Press, Albuquerque. This mound was likely the central altar for a guachimonton, but with its complete destruction, we may never know exactly what the mound was. Breton continued east stopping at the town of Teuchitl\u00e1n in which she documented the site of Los Guachimontones. Breton took three photographs of the site, created two sketch maps, and collected a number of obsidian artifacts from a Postclassic workshop. These materials are now stored at the Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery in Bristol, United Kingdom. Unfortunately, Breton did not publish her maps or photographs and the unique architectural form of the guachimontones went unnoticed for several decades until the late 1960s."]}, {"page": "List of people from Bath", "response": ["*Adela Breton (1849-1923) \u2013 artist and archaeologist, primarily known for recording Mexican frescoes in the 1890s."]}, {"page": "Breton (surname)", "response": ["*Adela Breton (1849\u20131923), English archaeologist"]}, {"page": "Adela Catherine Breton", "response": ["#REDIRECT Adela Breton"]}, {"page": "Kate Devlin", "response": ["She is also interested in, and has researched, the life story of Adela Breton, the Victorian archaeologist and explorer, and contributed to the Raising Horizons exhibition of 'trowel-blazing' women throughout the history of archaeology and geology."]}, {"page": "TrowelBlazers", "response": ["* Adela Breton"]}]}}
