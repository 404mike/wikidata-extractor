He commanded a paddle-sloop during the Second Opium War in 1860 and, as senior officer on the Cape of Good Hope and West Coast of Africa Station, he landed on the coast of South Africa with a small naval brigade which he led at the Battle of Gingindlovu and the Siege of Eshowe in April 1879 during the Anglo\u2013Zulu War. He took part in the Battle of Laing's Nek in January 1881 during the First Boer War and, as Commander-in-Chief of the East Indies Station, he organized and equipped a naval brigade to support the British advance up the Irrawaddy River in November 1885 during the Third Anglo-Burmese War. He went on to be First Naval Lord and in that role led a huge shipbuilding and naval works programme undertaken in accordance with the provisions of the Naval Defence Act 1889. The programme was opposed by Prime Minister William Gladstone who was concerned about its vast cost and who resigned after a Cabinet defeat over it in March 1894. The programme continued under the Governments of Lord Rosebery and then Lord Salisbury and Richards remained in office driving the programme throughout the political turmoil.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1912", "response": ["* September 28 \u2013 Frederick Richards, British admiral (b. 1833)"]}, {"page": "1833", "response": ["* November 30 \u2013 Frederick Richards British admiral (d. 1912)"]}, {"page": "Admiral of the Fleet (Royal Navy)", "response": ["|  || 100px || Richards FrederickSir Frederick Richards || 1833 || 1912 || First Sea Lord 1893\u20131899 ||"]}, {"page": "Second Sea Lord and Deputy Chief of Naval Staff", "response": ["* Admiral Sir Frederick Richards, 1892\u20131893"]}, {"page": "Richards Bay", "response": ["The town began as a makeshift harbour that was set up by Commodore of the Cape, Sir Frederick Richards, during the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879.

The official report of events was prepared by Admirals Sir William Dowell, Sir Vesey Hamilton and Sir Frederick Richards. They stressed the importance to Britain of an effective navy to protect its waters and the much greater importance of this to the country as a whole than the army. If control of the seas around Britain could be maintained, then no army was needed to defend it. Whereas, if control was lost then no army however great would suffice to defend it, because it must starve deprived of shipping. This contributed to the adoption of the principle that the British navy must equal the combined force of the other two greatest world navies.Fitzgerald pp. 260\u2013262"]}]}}
