Ali also believed that she \"had a lasting influence on the public discourse, particularly in matters of mental health\" by discussing her eating disorder publicly.

Writing in 1989, Michael White differentiated between TFA's brand of libertarianism and that of civil liberties campaigners, arguing that: \"The unavoidable fact is that TFA represents that ancient tradition of English concepts of freedom, easily traceable to Magna Carta, which see liberty in terms of freedoms from restraints and obligations, not civil rights and duties enunciated by Jefferson in the rebellious American colonies, by Tom Paine and the revolutionaries of 1789\".", "In the 1970s, the founders regarded the power of the UK trade union movement as excessive and out of control. Soon after its formation the National Association for Freedom as TFA was then known became involved in a number of industrial disputes providing support to both employers and non-unionised workers to counter to the power of the Trades Unions. The best known of these actions was \"Operation Pony Express\" during the Grunwick dispute. Harold Walker, the Labour Secretary of State for Employment between 1976 and 1979, was strongly critical of NAFF's activities, claiming the group was an \"ultra right-wing political organisation\" which \"sought to interfere in industrial disputes, with harmful consequences\". Following the election of the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher, the Association \"suffered a slow decline in membership\". In January 1989, The Guardian's Michael White reported that TFA \"no longer has the power or glory it enjoyed when it was Thatcherism's extra-parliamentary advance guard against a fading Labour government and its union allies.\""]}, {"page": "BBC Cardiff Singer of the World competition", "response": ["* Michael White (1995)"]}, {"page": "What the Papers Say", "response": ["The radio programmes were recorded at the Westminster BBC's New Broadcasting House studios.
