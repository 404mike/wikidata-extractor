These tournaments were the Jameson International Open 1982 and 1983, the Professional Players Tournament 1982 and 1983, the 1984 Lada Classic, and the 1982, 1983 and 1984 Embassy World Championships. Steve Davis was ranked first with 32 points, some way ahead of Tony Knowles in second place with 21, Cliff Thorburn (3rd, with 20) and Kirk Stevens (4th, with 19). John Virgo, who did not win any ranking points in the 1983\u20131984 season was the only player to lose their place in the top 16 from the previous year. Willie Thorne joined the top 16. The Coral Open and Dulux British Open were added for to the ranking list with effect from the 1984\u201385 season, which meant that performances in those events were taken into account for the 1985/1986 rankings. In the same season, due to changes in sponsors, the Professional Players Tournament became the Rothmans Grand Prix, and the Lada Classic became the Mercantile Credit Classic."]}]}}
