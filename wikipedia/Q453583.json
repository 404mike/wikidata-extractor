Regarded as one of the most distinguished classical guitarists of the 20th century, he played a significant role in improving the public perception of the classical guitar as a respectable instrument. Over the course of a career that spanned more than half a century, Bream helped revive interest in the lute.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 14", "response": ["*2020 \u2013 Julian Bream, English classical guitarist and lutenist (b. 1933)"]}, {"page": "Classical guitar", "response": ["The fingerstyle is used fervently on the modern classical guitar. The thumb traditionally plucks the bass \u2013 or root note \u2013 whereas the fingers ring the melody and its accompanying parts. Often classical guitar technique involves the use of the nails of the right hand to pluck the notes. Noted players were: Francisco T\u00e1rrega, Emilio Pujol, Andr\u00e9s Segovia, Julian Bream, Agust\u00edn Barrios, and John Williams (guitarist).", "The steel-string and electric guitars characteristic to the rise of rock and roll in the post-WWII era became more widely played in North America and the English-speaking world. Agust\u00edn Barrios Mangor\u00e9 of Paraguay composed many works and brought into the mainstream the characteristics of Latin American music, as did the Brazilian composer Heitor Villa-Lobos. Andr\u00e9s Segovia commissioned works from Spanish composers such as Federico Moreno Torroba and Joaqu\u00edn Rodrigo, Italians such as Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco and Latin American composers such as Manuel Ponce of Mexico. Other prominent Latin American composers are Leo Brouwer of Cuba, Antonio Lauro of Venezuela and Enrique Solares of Guatemala. Julian Bream of Britain managed to get nearly every British composer from William Walton and Benjamin Britten to Peter Maxwell Davies to write significant works for guitar. Bream's collaborations with tenor Peter Pears also resulted in song cycles by Britten, Lennox Berkeley and others. There are significant works by composers such as Hans Werner Henze of Germany, Gilbert Biberian of England and Roland Chadwick of Australia."]}, {"page": "Django Reinhardt", "response": ["For about a decade after Reinhardt's death, interest in his musical style was minimal. In the fifties, bebop superseded swing in jazz, rock and roll took off, and electric instruments became dominant in popular music. Since the mid-sixties, there has been a revival of interest in Reinhardt's music, a revival that has extended into the 21st century, with annual festivals and periodic tribute concerts. His devotees included classical guitarist Julian Bream and country guitarist Chet Atkins, who considered him one of the ten greatest guitarists of the twentieth century."]}, {"page": "Isaac Alb\u00e9niz", "response": ["Alb\u00e9niz's works have become an important part of the repertoire of the classical guitar, many of which have been transcribed by Francisco T\u00e1rrega, Miguel Llobet and others. Asturias (Leyenda) in particular is heard most often on the guitar, as are Granada, Sevilla, Cadiz, Catalu\u00f1a, C\u00f3rdoba, Mallorca, and Tango in D. Gordon Crosskey and Cuban-born guitarist Manuel Barrueco have both made solo guitar arrangements of all the eight-movements in Suite espa\u00f1ola. Selections from Iberia have rarely been attempted on solo guitar but have been very effectively performed by guitar ensembles, such as the performance by John Williams and Julian Bream of Iberia's  opening \"Evocation\". The Doors incorporated \"Asturias\" into their song \"Spanish Caravan\"; also, Iron Maiden's \"To Tame a Land\" uses the introduction of the piece for the song bridge. More recently, a guitar version of Granada functions as something of a love theme in Woody Allen's 2008 film Vicky Cristina Barcelona."]}, {"page": "John Dowland", "response": ["Dowland's song \"Come Heavy Sleepe, the Image of True Death\" was the inspiration for Benjamin Britten's Nocturnal after John Dowland, written in 1963 for the guitarist Julian Bream. It consists of eight variations, all based on musical themes drawn from the song or its lute accompaniment, finally resolving into a guitar setting of the song itself.", "Dowland's music became part of the repertoire of the early music revival with lutenist Julian Bream and tenor Peter Pears, and later with Christopher Hogwood and David Munrow and the Early Music Consort in the late 1960s and later with the Academy of Ancient Music from the early 1970s."]}, {"page": "Lute", "response": ["The lute enjoyed a revival with the awakening of interest in historical music around 1900 and throughout the century. That revival was further boosted by the early music movement in the twentieth century. Important pioneers in lute revival were Julian Bream, Hans Neemann, Walter Gerwig, Suzanne Bloch and Diana Poulton. Lute performances are now not uncommon; there are many professional lutenists, especially in Europe where the most employment is found, and new compositions for the instrument are being produced by composers."]}, {"page": "1933", "response": ["** Julian Bream, English guitarist and lutenist (d. 2020)"]}, {"page": "2020", "response": ["** Julian Bream, English classical guitarist and lutenist (b. 1933)"]}, {"page": "Benjamin Britten", "response": ["Britten's other works range from orchestral to choral, solo vocal, chamber and instrumental as well as film music. He took a great interest in writing music for children and amateur performers, including the opera Noye's Fludde, a Missa Brevis, and the song collection Friday Afternoons. He often composed with particular performers in mind. His most frequent and important muse was his personal and professional partner, the tenor Peter Pears; others included Kathleen Ferrier, Jennifer Vyvyan, Janet Baker, Dennis Brain, Julian Bream, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Osian Ellis and Mstislav Rostropovich. Britten was a celebrated pianist and conductor, performing many of his own works in concert and on record. He also performed and recorded works by others, such as Bach's Brandenburg Concertos, Mozart symphonies, and song cycles by Schubert and Schumann.", "Britten's close friendship with Rostropovich inspired the Cello Sonata (1961) and three suites for solo cello (1964\u201371). String quartets featured throughout Britten's composing career, from a student work in 1928 to his Third String Quartet (1975). The Second Quartet, from 1945, was written in homage to Purcell; Mason considered it Britten's most important instrumental work to that date. Referring to this work, Keller writes of the ease with which Britten, relatively early in his compositional career, solves \"the modern sonata problem \u2013 the achievement of symmetry and unity within an extended ternary circle based on more than one subject\". Keller likens the innovatory skill of the Quartet to that of Walton's Viola Concerto.Keller, Hans. \"Benjamin Britten's Second Quartet\", Tempo, March 1947, pp. 6\u20139  The third Quartet was Britten's last major work; the critic Colin Anderson said of it in 2007, \"one of Britten's greatest achievements, one with interesting allusions to Bart\u00f3k and Shostakovich, and written with an economy that opens out a depth of emotion that can be quite chilling.Anderson, Colin, \"Britten \u2013 'Phantasy Quartet'; String Quartet No. 3; Bliss \u2013 Oboe Quintet\", Fanfare, March 2007, pp. 87\u201388. The Gemini Variations (1965), for flute, violin and piano duet, were based on a theme of Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly and written as a virtuoso piece for the 13-year-old Jeney twins, musical prodigies whom Britten had met in Budapest in the previous year. For Osian Ellis, Britten wrote the Suite for Harp (1969), which Joan Chissell in The Times described as \"a little masterpiece of concentrated fancy\".Chissell, Joan. \"Little Masterpieces\", The Times, 26 June 1976, p. 11 Nocturnal after John Dowland (1963) for solo guitar was written for Julian Bream and has been praised by Benjamin Dwyer for its \"semantic complexity, prolonged musical argument, and philosophical depth\"."]}, {"page": "Andr\u00e9s Segovia", "response": ["Segovia's repertoire consisted of three principal pillars: first, contemporary works, including concertos and sonatas, usually specifically written for Segovia himself by composers with whom he forged working relationships, notably Federico Moreno Torroba, Federico Mompou, and Joaqu\u00edn Rodrigo, the Mexican composer Manuel Ponce, the Italian composer Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco, and the great Brazilian composer Heitor Villa-Lobos; second, transcriptions, usually made by Segovia himself,Julian Bream (A Life on the Road) by Tony Palmer (First Published in the UK by Macdonald & Co 1982) () p125 \"the composer Peter Warlock\u00a0... persuaded the Oxford University Press to publish his edition of Dowland's Lachrimae or Seven Tears, and this was the edition Segovia used for his guitar transcriptions.\" of classical works originally written for other instruments (e.g., lute, harpsichord, piano, violin, cello) by Johann Sebastian Bach, Isaac Alb\u00e9niz, Enrique Granados, and many other prominent composers; third, traditional classical guitar works by composers such as Fernando Sor and Francisco T\u00e1rrega.

Further, Segovia left behind a large body of edited works and transcriptions for classical guitar, including several transcriptions of Bach\u2014in particular, an extraordinarily demanding classical guitar transcription of the Chaconne from the 2nd Partita for Violin (BWV 1004). During his lifetime, guitarists were eager to claim association with Segovia, and Segovia himself suggested that he had not actually taught as many students as has been claimed; he once said, \"All over the world I have 'pupils' I have never met.\"Duarte, John W.
