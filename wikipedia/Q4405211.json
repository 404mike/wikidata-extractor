He is possibly known for being the bassist for Black Sabbath during their 1987 tour in support of the album The Eternal Idol. He left the band once the tour ended.\nJo Burt was also a founding member of Sector 27 with Tom Robinson - and a member of Virginia Wolf with Jason Bonham.  Burt also appears on Freddie Mercury's solo album, Mr. Bad Guy playing fretless bass.\nHe has written, toured, and performed with many other artists, including The Troggs, Brian Setzer, Bob Geldof, Roger Taylor, James Reyne, Sweet and many more.\nBurt continues to write music and now lives in Dorset with his wife, Antonia (a soprano). Burt still performs regularly in the UK, Europe and North America with his band, The Jo Burt Experience.  He calls his southern-style rock with a trippy Beatles-esque English twist sound \"Anglicana\" - a term he coined himself - and describes it as \"Nashville Rock with an English Accent\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Black Sabbath", "response": ["After nearly a year in production, The Eternal Idol was released on 8 December 1987 and ignored by contemporary reviewers. On-line internet era reviews were mixed. AllMusic said that \"Martin's powerful voice added new fire\" to the band, and the album contained \"some of Iommi's heaviest riffs in years.\" Blender gave the album two stars, claiming the album was \"Black Sabbath in name only\". The album would stall at No. 66 in the United Kingdom, while peaking at 168 in the U.S. The band toured in support of Eternal Idol in Germany, Italy and for the first time, Greece. In part due to a backlash from promoters over the South Africa incident, other European shows were cancelled. Bassist Dave Spitz left the band shortly before the tour, and was replaced by Jo Burt, formerly of Virginia Wolf."]}, {"page": "Headless Cross (album)", "response": ["Due to Jo Burt's exit early in the sessions, Laurence Cottle played bass as a session musician rather than an official member. He appeared in the video for the title track, but was not featured in promotional photos. For the tour, the lineup was completed by Whitesnake and Gary Moore bassist Neil Murray."]}, {"page": "The Troggs", "response": ["* Jo Burt \u2013 bass (1977\u20131979)"]}, {"page": "The Sweet", "response": ["The mid-2000s would bring further confusing shake-ups and rotations. Tony O'Hora (ex-Onslaught, Praying Mantis) replaced Brown as lead vocalist in 2003. Ian Gibbons came back for a third stint as fill-in keyboardist in June 2005 for a gig in the Faroe Islands. O'Hora decided to split to take a teaching job in late 2005. Grant then jumped from keyboards to lead vocals and bass as Phil Lanzon returned on keyboards for a tour of Russia and Germany in October/November. New singer Mark Thompson Smith (ex-Praying Mantis) joined in November 2005 for some Swedish gigs, while Jo Burt (ex-Black Sabbath) was temporary bass player. Tony Mills (ex-Shy) was slated to be Sweet's new singer in early 2006 but failed to work out and left after six shows in Denmark. At this point, O'Hora came back as fill in front man and then Grant did another turn himself as the singer/bassist (Steve Mann depped on keyboards) until the group finally landed a new permanent front man when Peter Lincoln (ex-Sailor) arrived in July 2006. The line-up then consisted of Scott, Bisland, Grant and Lincoln."]}, {"page": "Mr. Bad Guy", "response": ["* Jo Burt \u2013 bass guitar on \"Man Made Paradise\""]}]}}
