In 2003, to mark the hundredth anniversary of his birth, the Greater Astoria Historical Society and other community organizations, spearheaded by Paul Maringelli and The Bix Beiderbecke Sunnyside Memorial Committee, erected a plaque in Beiderbecke's honor at the apartment building in which he died in Queens.Gray, Frank (April 30, 2005). \"Solo in Sunnyside: Frank Gray travels through Queens, New York, in search of the late Bix Beiderbecke\" The Guardian.

The critic and musician Digby Fairweather sums up Beiderbecke's musical legacy, arguing that \"with Louis Armstrong, Bix Beiderbecke was the most striking of jazz's cornet (and of course, trumpet) fathers; a player who first captivated his 1920s generation and after his premature death, founded a dynasty of distinguished followers beginning with Jimmy McPartland and moving on down from there.\"Fairweather, p. 122."]}, {"page": "Southend-on-Sea", "response": ["* Digby Fairweather, jazz musician, author."]}, {"page": "Rochford", "response": ["*Digby Fairweather, jazz musician"]}, {"page": "Loughton", "response": ["* The National Jazz Archive is housed in Loughton Library and Town Hall; it is the national repository and research centre for printed material, photographs and memorabilia relating to jazz, with an emphasis on British jazz.
