He fostered political and religious tolerance and drew talented minds to the college, including Christopher Wren. Although he was a supporter of Oliver Cromwell, Royalists placed their sons in his charge. From those interested in experimental science, he drew together a significant group known as the Oxford Philosophical Club, which by 1650 had been constituted with a set of rules. Besides some of the London group (Goddard, Wallis, Ward, and Wren who was a young prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Scarburgh), it included (in the account of Thomas Sprat) Ralph Bathurst, Robert Boyle, William Petty, Lawrence Rooke, Thomas Willis, and Matthew Wren.. Robert Hooke was gradually recruited into the Wilkins group: he arrived at Christ Church, Oxford in 1653, working his way to an education, became assistant to Willis, became known to Wilkins (possibly via Richard Busby) as a technician, and by 1658 was working with Boyle.."]}, {"page": "Thomas Warton", "response": ["Among other important contributions, Warton, along with his brother, was among the first to argue that Sir Thopas, by Geoffrey Chaucer, was a parody.

He was a great man and carried all things at his pleasure.\" In particular he struck out all the passages which Wood had inserted in praise of Thomas Hobbes, and substituted some disparaging epithets. He called Leviathan \"monstrosissimus\" and \"publico damno notissimus.\" To the printed remonstrance of Hobbes, Fell inserted an insulting reply in the History to \"irritabile illud et vanissimum Malmesburiense animal,\" and to the complaint of Wood at this usage answered only that Hobbes \"was an old man, had one foot in the grave; that he should mind his latter end, and not trouble the world any more with his papers.\" In small things as in great he loved to rule and direct. \"Let not Fell,\" writes R.
