He was part of the 1966 FIFA World Cup winning squad, receiving a winner's medal in 2007. He was the first winner of the PFA Players' Player of the Year award in 1974, and was included in the Football League 100 Legends. A tough tackling centre-half and defensive midfielder, he was nicknamed \"Bites Yer Legs\" Hunter. The nickname originated from a banner held up by Leeds United fans at the 1972 FA Cup Final against Arsenal; the banner read \"Norman bites yer legs\". He played 726 games in total for Leeds, scoring 21 goals.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bristol City F.C.", "response": ["|1976\u201377|| Norman Hunter||Defender", "|1977\u201378|| Norman Hunter||Defender"]}, {"page": "2020", "response": ["** Norman Hunter, English international footballer (b. 1943)"]}, {"page": "Brian Clough", "response": ["That season, Derby failed to retain their title, finishing seventh, but reached the semi-finals of the European Cup in April 1973, when they were knocked out by Juventus 3\u20131 on aggregate. After the game, Clough emerged from the dressing room and told the expectant Italian reporters \"No cheating bastards do I talk to. I will not talk to any cheating bastards\" and then questioned the Italian nation's courage in the Second World War. It was these sorts of frequent, outspoken comments \u2013 particularly against football's establishment, such as the FA and club directors, and figures in the game such as Sir Matt Busby, Alan Hardaker, Alf Ramsey, Don Revie and Len Shipman, along with players such as Billy Bremner, Norman Hunter and Peter Lorimer \u2013 combined with Clough's increased media profile, that eventually led to his falling out with the Rams' chairman, Sam Longson, and the Derby County board of directors."]}, {"page": "Jack Charlton", "response": ["The 1962\u201363 season was the beginning of a new era for Leeds United as Revie began to mould the team and the club into his own liking. In a game against Swansea Town in September, Revie dropped many senior players and played Charlton in a young new defensive line-up: Gary Sprake (goalkeeper), Paul Reaney (right-back), Norman Hunter and Charlton (centre-back), and Rod Johnson (left-back). With the exception of Johnson, this defensive line-up would remain consistent for much of the rest of the decade. Charlton took charge of the defence that day, and insisted upon a zonal marking system; Revie agreed to allow Charlton to become the key organiser in defence. Aided by new midfield signing Johnny Giles, Leeds put in a strong promotion challenge and finished fifth, before securing promotion as champions in the 1963\u201364 campaign, topping the table two points ahead of Sunderland. Other players that began to make their mark on the first team included Billy Bremner, Paul Madeley and Peter Lorimer.", "He became the 12th player from the 1966 FIFA World Cup squad to die after: Bobby Moore (1993), Alan Ball (2007), John Connelly (2012), Ron Springett (2015), Gerry Byrne (2015), Jimmy Armfield (2018), Ray Wilson (2018), Gordon Banks (2019), Martin Peters (2019), Peter Bonetti (2020) and Norman Hunter (2020)."]}, {"page": "Gateshead", "response": ["*Norman Hunter \u2013 footballer (Leeds United and member of 1966 World Cup-winning England squad)"]}, {"page": "Barnsley F.C.", "response": ["*  Norman Hunter (1980\u20131984)"]}, {"page": "Rotherham United F.C.", "response": ["|Norman Hunter"]}, {"page": "Alf Ramsey", "response": ["Before the qualifier with Poland at Wembley Stadium, the Derby County manager Brian Clough described Polish goalkeeper Jan Tomaszewski as a \"circus clown in gloves\". Errors by Norman Hunter and goalkeeper Peter Shilton and an inspired goalkeeping performance by Tomaszewski, who made many crucial, and sometimes unorthodox saves, meant that the match finished 1\u20131. Ramsey, always uncomfortable with the substitute rule, was blamed for waiting until the 85th minute before bringing on forward Kevin Hector. The draw meant that England had tried and failed to qualify for a World Cup for the first time in the national team's history."]}]}}
