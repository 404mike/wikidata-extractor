It was to be his highest score in first class cricket, and he only made two higher scores in any form of the game, the aforementioned Twenty20 century and 93 against a Durham Cricket Board XI in the C&G Trophy.\nAfter the 2005 season, where Thomas' highest first class cricket score was 42, he was released from the club, and currently plays some minor cricket for Herefordshire. He has also represented Welsh Minor Counties.\nThomas played for Port Talbot Town in the South Wales Cricket Association between 2007 and 2008. In 30 matches, he scored 1295 runs at an average of 46.25, making three centuries with a highest score of 133. He also took 42 wickets at 29.83 with a best of 5/57.
