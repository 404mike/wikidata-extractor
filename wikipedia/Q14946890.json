The diseased vineyards were dug up and replanted, and farmers were looking for alternatives to wine. In 1892, Rhodes financed The Pioneer Fruit Growing Company at Nooitgedacht, a venture created by Harry Pickstone, an Englishman who had experience with fruit-growing in California.  The shipping magnate Percy Molteno had just undertaken the first successful refrigerated export to Europe. In 1896, after consulting with Molteno, Rhodes began to pay more attention to export fruit farming and bought farms in Groot Drakenstein, Wellington and Stellenbosch. A year later, he bought Rhone and Boschendal and commissioned Sir Herbert Baker to build him a cottage there.  The successful operation soon expanded into Rhodes Fruit Farms, and formed a cornerstone of the modern-day Cape fruit industry."]}, {"page": "Dumfriesshire (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Percy Molteno"]}, {"page": "National Liberal Club", "response": ["*Percy Molteno, barrister, businessman, philanthropist and Liberal MP 1906\u201318."]}, {"page": "Boschendal", "response": ["In the meantime, farmers needed alternative forms of agriculture and the lucrative fruit industry in California provided a suitable model for the Cape.

Here he joined Merriman, and his old friend the powerful politician and businessman Percy Molteno, in advocating a non-racial franchise in the constitution. The concept was bitterly opposed by the representatives of the other South African colonies and their exclusively white electorate; Sauer later proposed the extension of the qualified Cape franchise to the rest of the Union. When this was also rejected, he successfully fought for the retention of this system in the Cape only. While some of his allies thought this compromise \"pathetic\", Sauer believed it was the only way to retain a semblance of political voice for nonwhites, without scuppering the entire Union. Sauer was also under the mistaken belief that the existing franchise could later be extended and expanded after union had been secured. He nonetheless viewed the results of the Union Convention as a great disappointment."]}, {"page": "John Charles Molteno Jr.", "response": ["After his father\u2019s death he took over much of the family\u2019s businesses, and managed their enormous Karoo farms.
