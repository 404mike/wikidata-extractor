Anderson, Danielle Allen and Timuel D. Black.  Best known for his work on the 19th-century philosopher Henry Sidgwick, Schultz aims to expand the range of interpretive questions philosophers should consider; his work on the history of philosophy seeks both a deeper historical/critical understanding through the examination of both the lives and the works of such philosophers as Sidgwick, and a candid confrontation with the racism, sexism, and patterns of exclusion that have characterized philosophy both past and present.  He claims that this type of historical approach can help unmask the limitations of some popular current forms of academic philosophy.  His blog post \"On Not Seeing in Philosophy\" (September 29, 2016) is suggestive of the critical perspective characteristic of his work  Partly for such reasons, and because of his work in environmental philosophy, he has over the last three decades moved steadily away from the more Rawlsian and neo-Kantian frameworks that he was initially drawn to, in the direction of certain forms of consequentialism more characteristic of a Sidgwickian perspective, but with a greater emphasis on environmental issues and matters of diversity and inclusion."]}, {"page": "Roger Stephen Crisp", "response": ["#REDIRECT Roger Crisp"]}, {"page": "List of St Anne's College, Oxford people", "response": ["*Roger Crisp \u2013 current Professor of Moral Philosophy, Uehiro Fellow and Tutor in Philosophy, Chairman of Management Committee of the Oxford Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics"]}]}}
