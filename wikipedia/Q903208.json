Although Edison was aware of the unidirectional property of current flow between the filament and the anode, his interest (and patentThomas A. Edison  \"Electrical Indicator\", Issue date: 1884) concentrated on the sensitivity of the anode current to the current through the filament (and thus filament temperature). Little practical use was ever made of this property (however early radios often implemented volume controls through varying the filament current of amplifying tubes). It was only years later that John Ambrose Fleming utilized the rectifying property of the diode tube to detect (demodulate) radio signals, a substantial improvement on the early cat's-whisker detector already used for rectification."]}, {"page": "Mustard gas", "response": ["Mustard agent was possibly developed as early as 1822 by C\u00e9sar-Mansu\u00e8te Despretz (1798\u20131863).By Any Other Name: Origins of Mustard Gas . Itech.dickinson.edu (2008-04-25). Retrieved on 2011-05-29. Despretz described the reaction of sulfur dichloride and ethylene but never made mention of any irritating properties of the reaction product. In 1854, another French chemist, Alfred Riche (1829\u20131908), repeated this procedure, also without describing any adverse physiological properties. In 1860, the British scientist Frederick Guthrie synthesized and characterized the mustard agent compound and noted its irritating properties, especially in tasting. Also in 1860, chemist Albert Niemann, known as a pioneer in cocaine chemistry, repeated the reaction, and recorded blister-forming properties. In 1886, Viktor Meyer published a paper describing a synthesis that produced good yields. He combined 2-chloroethanol with aqueous potassium sulfide, and then treated the resulting thiodiglycol with phosphorus trichloride. The purity of this compound was much higher and consequently the adverse health effects upon exposure were much more severe. These symptoms presented themselves in his assistant, and in order to rule out the possibility that his assistant was suffering from a mental illness (psychosomatic symptoms), Meyer had this compound tested on laboratory rabbits, most of which died. In 1913, the English chemist Hans Thacher Clarke (known for the Eschweiler-Clarke reaction) replaced the phosphorus trichloride with hydrochloric acid in Meyer's formulation while working with Emil Fischer in Berlin. Clarke was hospitalized for two months for burns after one of his flasks broke. According to Meyer, Fischer's report on this accident to the German Chemical Society sent the German Empire on the road to chemical weapons."]}, {"page": "Eutectic system", "response": ["The term  was coined in 1884 by British physicist and chemist Frederick Guthrie (1833\u20131886)."]}, {"page": "Thermionic emission", "response": ["The phenomenon was initially reported in 1853 by Edmond Becquerel.
