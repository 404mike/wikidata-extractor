The austenite class of iron alloys is named after him.\nHe was born William Chandler Roberts in Kennington, Surrey, the son of George and Maria n\u00e9e Chandler Roberts. He later (1885) assumed the name of Roberts-Austen at the request of his uncle, Major Nathaniel Lawrence Austen, as a condition of inheritance. He was educated privately and at the Royal School of Mines (1861\u20131865).\nHe was appointed Assistant to the Master of the Mint and then Chemist of the Royal Mint (1869), Professor of Metallurgy at the School of Mines (1880) and Chemist and Assayer to the Royal Mint (1882\u20131902). He developed procedures for the analysis of alloy constituents and an automatic recording pyrometer used to record temperature changes in furnaces and molten materials;. He became a world authority on the technical aspects of minting coins. His work had many practical and industrial applications.\nHe was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in June 1875 and was their Bakerian Lecturer in 1896. He was made CB in 1890 and knighted (KCB) in 1899. He was also a Chevalier of the Legion d'honneur.He was largely responsible for the building of St Martin's chapel of ease, Blackheath, Surrey, in 1893. He died at his residence in the Royal Mint and was buried in St Martin's churchyard, Canterbury, Kent.\nHe had married Florence Maude Alldridge in London in 1876.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alloy", "response": ["Steel is an alloy of iron and carbon, but the term alloy steel usually only refers to steels that contain other elements\u2014 like vanadium, molybdenum, or cobalt\u2014in amounts sufficient to alter the properties of the base steel. Since ancient times, when steel was used primarily for tools and weapons, the methods of producing and working the metal were often closely guarded secrets. Even long after the Age of reason, the steel industry was very competitive and manufacturers went through great lengths to keep their processes confidential, resisting any attempts to scientifically analyze the material for fear it would reveal their methods. For example, the people of Sheffield, a center of steel production in England, were known to routinely bar visitors and tourists from entering town to deter industrial espionage. Thus, almost no metallurgical information existed about steel until 1860. Because of this lack of understanding, steel was not generally considered an alloy until the decades between 1930 and 1970 (primarily due to the work of scientists like William Chandler Roberts-Austen, Adolf Martens, and Edgar Bain), so \"alloy steel\" became the popular term for ternary and quaternary steel-alloys.Sheffield Steel and America: A Century of Commercial and Technological Independence By Geoffrey Tweedale \u2013 Cambridge University Press 1987 Page 57\u201462Experimental Techniques in Materials and Mechanics By C.

Many different methods and cooling baths for quenching have been attempted during ancient times, from quenching in urine, blood, or metals like mercury or lead, but the process of tempering has remained relatively unchanged over the ages. Tempering was often confused with quenching and, often, the term was used to describe both techniques. In 1889, Sir William Chandler Roberts-Austen wrote, \"There is still so much confusion between the words \"temper,\" \"tempering,\" and \"hardening,\" in the writings of even eminent authorities, that it is well to keep these old definitions carefully in mind. I shall employ the word tempering in the same sense as softening.\"Roberts-Austen By Sir William Chandler Roberts-Austen, Sydney W.
