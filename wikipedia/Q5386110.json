He was the elder identical twin brother of Alec Bedser (1918\u20132010), widely regarded as one of England's top bowlers of the 20th century. Eric was an all-rounder, a useful right-handed batsman and right-arm off-spin bowler.\nEric Bedser was born in Reading, Berkshire 10 minutes before his twin brother Alec. The twins were regarded as 'inseparable' throughout their lives, and they often dressed identically. Their father served in the Royal Flying Corps in the First World War, later becoming a bricklayer. He also played cricket and football.\nThe Bedser brothers began playing cricket together at age seven for local school sides and Woking Cricket Club. Both twins also played football for Surrey Boys, and considered a professional career in that sport. They were educated at Maybury Junior School and Monument Hill Central School. From the age of 14, the twins worked as clerks at a solicitor's office in Lincoln's Inn Fields. They were spotted by Surrey coach Alan Peach in 1938 and joined the Surrey county squad staff at the Oval, making their first-class debuts in the same match in June 1939. There is a famous story that when Eric and Alec were first selected for Surrey, they agreed they couldn't both be fast bowlers, as at that time they were. A flip of the coin saw Alec win the toss, and Eric consequently took up off-spin bowling, at which he became very adept in a Surrey county team that was dominated by famous spinners such as Jim Laker and Tony Lock, and concentrated on his batting.\nThe pair were called up for duty with the Royal Air Force in 1939, serving in France and being evacuated from Dunkirk. They later served variously together throughout the war, in North Africa and Italy. Eric was promoted to Warrant Officer (and Alec refused a similar promotion, staying a flight sergeant so they could stay together), and both being demobilised in 1946, and returned to cricket at Surrey.\n\nBedser enjoyed a successful first-class career, a member of the Surrey team that won seven successive County Championships from 1952 to 1958, despite many of the side's best players being away playing for England. Despite being called to a Test Trial in 1950, in which Laker took 8 wickets for 2 runs, one of which was scored by Eric, he was never called to play in a Test himself: he played for England only once, in a first-class tour match in Tasmania. As a result, Eric's record will always be lacking when compared with Alec's, who played in 51 Test matches, although Eric often accompanied Alec on overseas tours.\nIn a first-class career that lasted twenty-three years, Bedser played in 457 matches for Surrey, scoring 14,716 runs at the useful batting average of 24.00, and taking 833 wickets at the good bowling average of 24.95. He passed 1,000 runs in six seasons.\nAfter retiring from playing cricket he went into business with his brother. Among other business interests, they co-operated with Ronald Straker in a successful stationery firm, Straker-Bedser, which was later taken over by Ryman in 1977. While Alec became a selector for England, Eric served on various committees at Surrey. He was president of Surrey County Cricket Club in 1990.\nNeither twin married, living together in a house that they built with their father in 1953 in Woking, until Eric died aged 87 in Woking.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "July 4", "response": ["*  1918   \u2013 Eric Bedser, English cricketer (d. 2006)"]}, {"page": "1918", "response": ["** Eric Bedser, English cricketer (d. 2006)"]}, {"page": "List of twins", "response": ["* Alec (1918\u20132010) and Eric Bedser (1918\u20132006)"]}, {"page": "Surrey County Cricket Club", "response": ["*  Eric Bedser"]}, {"page": "Horsell", "response": ["It is also the home of Woking and Horsell Cricket Club, whose members have included Alec and Eric Bedser.

On a sticky wicket that played into the hands of the Surrey spinners, Australia were skittled for 143. Only Davidson, who took the attack to the pair, made 44 not out. One six that he lofted from Laker almost reached the iconic gasometer outside The Oval.

Having said that, the arrival of Jim Laker certainly resolved any problems in spin bowling and his future partner Tony Lock was already making progress at second eleven level. Another good start was made by opening batsman David Fletcher who was awarded his county cap with Laker and Eric Bedser. Six Surrey batsmen topped 1,000 runs in the championship: Eric Bedser, Fletcher, captain Errol Holmes, Tom Barling, John Parker and Stan Squires. Laurie Fishlock had a chequered season having been dogged by serious illness since he went to Australia with England in the winter. Wicketkeeper Arthur McIntyre played well and produced some good batting performances. The main bowlers were Alec Bedser, Jim Laker and the retiring Alf Gover, who took 121 wickets in his final season. Seamer Eddie Watts could make only a few appearances due to injury. Geoffrey Whittaker made eight appearances and two future Surrey mainstays Bernie Constable and Stuart Surridge also played.Playfair, pp. 92\u201394."]}, {"page": "List of presidents of Surrey County Cricket Club", "response": ["|30||align=\"left\" | Eric Bedser||1990"]}, {"page": "Alan Peach", "response": ["He was Surrey coach from 1935 to 1939 and discovered Alec and Eric Bedser.

Miller had the first of many brushes with death in April, when he was invited to play weekend cricket for a RAAF team in London. While he was away for his first weekend match, the local Bournemouth pub where he ate lunch on Sunday was struck by a German air strike. Miller's weekly lunchmates were all killed. His selection for the RAAF cricket team had saved him.Perry, p. 62.Mallett, p. 63.Haigh, p. 2.Whitington, pp. 54\u201355. Miller quickly gained a reputation among the servicemen for his carefree batting and bowling. He often bowled without a proper run-up but managed to trouble batsmen with pace and bounce regardless.Perry, p. 64. The RAAF team was officially formed in preparation for the 1943 season and Miller was selected. The captain was flying officer Keith Carmody.  Miller played his first match at Lord's, the home of cricket, against Warner's XI, a team that included former England captains Bob Wyatt and Gubby Allen and future Test players Alec and Eric Bedser and Trevor Bailey.Perry, p. 65. Oblivious to authority, Miller pushed a person in the dressing room out of his way before the match started, unaware that it was Warner, the secretary of the Marylebone Cricket Club himself.Perry, p. 66. Warner's XI batted first, and Miller dismissed Wyatt and Allen in taking 2/20 from ten overs as the hosts made 201. Miller came to the crease at the fall of the first wicket and hit consecutive fours off the bowling of Dick Pollard from the Royal Air Force (RAF). The RAAF were bowled out for 100, with Miller top-scoring with 45. In the second innings, he made 21 not out with two sixes as time ran out and the match ended in a draw. In a match for the United Services against Sussex, Miller top-scored with 134 not out in 120 minutes, striking 12 fours and three sixes. He then tore through Sussex with 7/36, breaking through the defences of six players who were bowled or leg before wicket, as his team won by 225 runs. He also played one match for Sussex against the RAF, scoring 11 and taking 3/41."]}, {"page": "David Pratt (cricketer)", "response": ["He did not play in the first-team again until early August, when Worcestershire played Surrey at Worcester, but he then produced what was to remain a career-best performance.

Both took two wickets and Hamence snared opposing captain Laurie Fishlock and Eric Bedser to end with 2/24. Brown injured a finger while fielding, so he was not able to bat in Australia's first innings. Hamence was thus elevated to open the batting. Hamence made a duck, but Australia nevertheless took a 168-run lead. Hamence opened the bowling for the second time, although he was unable to take a wicket and ended with 0/30. In the second innings, Harvey volunteered to play as a makeshift opener alongside Loxton and they chased down the 122 runs for victory in less than an hour to complete a 10-wicket win."]}, {"page": "Woking", "response": ["The footbridge over the Basingstoke Canal by the Lighthouse features statues of the cricketing brothers, Sir Alec and Eric Bedser by Allan Sly.
