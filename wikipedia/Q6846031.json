He developed a fine understanding with Alan Hudson which saw a strong Stoke side nearly win the league title in 1974\u201375. In January 1976 a severe storm in Stoke-on-Trent caused considerable damage to the Victoria Ground and in order to pay for the repairs the club sold off their players. This meant that Stoke struggled in 1976\u201377 and were relegated to the Second Division. Mahoney joined Middlesbrough in July 1977 for \u00a390,000. \"I didn't want to leave but when I looked at the fixture list and Stoke were away at Mansfield and Middlesbrough at home to Liverpool, I knew I had to go.\" He spent two seasons at Ayresome Park making 90 appearances helping \"Boro\" to two mid-table finishes. He then moved on to Swansea City with whom helped gain promotion in 1980\u201381 and finish 6th in their first season in the top-flight.
