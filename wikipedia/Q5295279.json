A left-handed batsman and occasional wicketkeeper Walker played 73 first-class games for Hampshire. In 1937 during a County Championship match played against Sussex, at the United Services Recreation Ground Walker and Gerry Hill put on 235 for the 5th wicket, which remains to this day a Hampshire record. A patient batsman, Walker was able to manufacture an innings with great touch. His best season came in 1939, in what was to be his last season. Walker scored 1,117 runs, including three centuries; average 29.39.\nWalker was also a strong Rugby player, he captained the Dorset County team and also captained a Royal Air Force side.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Don Walker", "response": ["Don or Donald Walker may refer to:", "*Donald Walker (cricketer) (1912\u20131941), English cricketer", "*Donald Walker (politician) (1949\u20132009), American politician"]}, {"page": "United Services Recreation Ground", "response": ["After the war, Hampshire played Sussex there in 1919, a season which also saw the South play the Australian Imperial Forces, before the resumption of first three matches, then four matches per season being played there.  1920 saw Hampshire's first even double century opening wicket partnership between Alex Bowell and George Brown, with the two compiling a partnership of 204. The emergence of Alec Kennedy and Jack Newman during this period under the captaincy of Lord Tennyson led to stronger Hampshire performances, with Hampshire winning all three matches played at the ground in the 1921 season.  The Combined Services played only their second ever first-class match in that same season against the Australians.  Later in the 1920s, the Royal Navy played first-class cricket at the ground for the first time, against the 1927 touring New Zealanders. The first hat trick at the ground was taken by Stuart Boyes in 1925. Hampshire continued to play at the ground throughout the thirties, at a time when following the retirements of George Brown, Phil Mead, Jack Newman and Lord Tennyson Hampshire were a less successful team.  Hampshire played four matches per season there during the thirties, with the exception of 1938 when they played five matches, before returning to four in 1939. Hampshire record partnership for the fifth wicket was made there in 1937, when Gerry Hill and Donald Walker put on 235, a record which stands to this day. World War II ended county cricket until 1946, and during the war Portsmouth was heavily bombed by the German Luftwaffe during The Blitz."]}, {"page": "Gerry Hill", "response": ["In 1935, Hill was hit for 32 in an over by Glamorgan's Cyril Smart (6, 6, 4, 6, 6, 4), then the most expensive six-ball over in first-class history.
