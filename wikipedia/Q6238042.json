After initially racing stock cars from 1959, he began his speedway career in 1960 with Stoke Potters. Hart was the last to ride on Birmingham's Perry Barr track (at the Alexander Sports Stadium) before it closed to speedway in 1960. He moved to Cradley Heathens in 1961, the team that he would ride for in eight seasons over the course of his career. In 1962 he represented England against an Overseas team, and also represented a Provincial League select against the National League. When the British League started in 1965, Hart was a heat leader with the Heathens, averaging close to eight points per match. In 1966 he transferred to Sheffield Tigers, where he spent two seasons before moving to Leicester Lions for three seasons in which he only missed one match. In 1971 he returned to Cradley, but failed to repeat his earlier form over two seasons there and in 1973 dropped down to the Second Division with Birmingham Brummies, where was a consistent high scorer for three seasons before retiring in 1975. \nTowards the end of his speedway career he became a partner in the Compleat Angler public house at Wirksworth, Derbyshire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Hart", "response": ["John Hart or Johnny Hart may refer to:", "* John Hart (actor) (1917\u20132009), American actor", "* John Hart (dancer) (1921\u20132015), English ballet dancer, choreographer and artistic director", "* John Hart (author) (born 1965), American novelist", "* John Hart (producer), American film and theater producer", "* Captain John Hart (Torchwood), fictional character on Torchwood", "* John Hart (soldier) (1706\u20131777), American soldier", "* John Hart (RAF officer) (1916\u20132019), Canadian pilot in the Royal Air Force", "* John Hart (colonial administrator) (flourished 1714\u20131720), royal governor of Maryland and later the Leeward Islands", "* John Hart (New Jersey politician) (c. 1711\u20131779), delegate from New Jersey to the Continental Congress and a signer of the United States Declaration of Independence", "* John Hart (doctor) (1751\u20131836), American surgeon and politician", "* John Hart (South Australian colonist) (1809\u20131873), \"Capt.
