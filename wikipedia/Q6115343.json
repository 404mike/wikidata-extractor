He signed from Sunderland after being found playing for Non League side Usworth Colliery after the Second World War. Stelling made his first appearance for Sunderland on 5 January 1946 against Grimsby Town in a 3\u20131 win at Blundell Park. During his time at Sunderland spanning from 1946 until 1956 he had made 259 league appearances scoring 8 goals. Shortly after he retired from playing football in 1956.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Len Shackleton", "response": ["Shackleton never won any honours with Sunderland, the closest he came to doing so being a third-place finish in 1949\u201350, when they finished one point behind champions Portsmouth. Shackleton felt that a surprise home defeat to Manchester City on 15 April was both decisive and galling, as teammate Jack Stelling twice missed a penalty in a 2\u20131 loss. Sunderland lost fewer games than any other team in the 1954\u201355 season, but still ended up four points behind champions Chelsea. They also reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup in 1955 and in 1956, losing 1\u20130 to Manchester City at Villa Park and then 3\u20130 to Birmingham City at Hillsborough. He injured his ankle on the opening day of the 1957\u201358 season, and announced his retirement shortly afterwards. This meant he played only 45 minutes for new manager Alan Brown, who had a reputation as a tough taskmaster. The club were reluctant to grant him a benefit match, but relented after Shackleton threatened to tell the FA about illegal payments the club had made."]}, {"page": "Yeovil Town 2\u20131 Sunderland (1949)", "response": ["| DF || 2 || Jack Stelling"]}, {"page": "Stelling", "response": ["*Jack Stelling (born 1924), English footballer"]}]}}
