He had a UK Top 10 hit single in 1982 with \"Orville's Song\" which reached number 4 in the charts.The son of variety performers, Harris assisted in his father's ventriloquy acts as a child; as a teenager, he created his own ventriloquism characters which he performed at holiday resorts in the summer season, attracting the attention of television producers. He debuted on screen in 1965 and became a popular act guest starring on various shows; he had his first solo series Cuddles and Company in the 1970s, but got his big break in 1982 with The Keith Harris Show. He, Orville and Cuddles became popular performers on primetime television until the show was cancelled in 1990, as audiences and television producers began to move away from variety performances. \nAfter a low period and two failed business ventures in the early 1990s, he embarked on a busy stage career (mostly in pantomime) and found new appreciation in the 2000s, appearing as a guest in several television programmes. His output declined after a 2013 cancer diagnosis and he died two years later.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "September 21", "response": ["*  1947   \u2013 Keith Harris, English ventriloquist and singer (d. 2015)"]}, {"page": "Jim Diamond (singer)", "response": ["|align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|The Keith Harris Show"]}, {"page": "Adam and Joe", "response": ["They directed pop promos for Frank Black and Gorky's Zygotic Mynci, as well as appearing in two Surf washing powder commercials, in which they comically set upon Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen and Keith Harris and Orville."]}, {"page": "List of ventriloquists", "response": ["*Keith Harris (1947 - 2015) \u2013 \"Orville the Duck\", \"Cuddles the Monkey\""]}, {"page": "David Walliams", "response": ["| style=\"text-align: center\" | 7 || Blankety Blank || Paul O'Grady (this time as himself, having only done so before as Lily Savage) || Panellist || Panellists: Barbara Windsor, David Tennant, George Lamb, Keith Harris and Orville and Stacey Solomon, with Lee Ryan and Duncan James from Blue playing as contestants"]}, {"page": "Bob Carolgees", "response": ["Carolgees appeared in pantomime at Hull New Theatre for the 2013 run of Jack and the Beanstalk, replacing an unwell Keith Harris.
