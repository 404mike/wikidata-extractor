Fraser and bassist Greg Lake wrote the lyrics together, while Keith Emerson added some improvisations on the Hammond organ. (Lake worked with non-performing lyricists before and after this, notably Peter Sinfield.)\nMost of the music to \"Knife-Edge\" was borrowed from the first movement of Leo\u0161 Jan\u00e1\u010dek's Sinfonietta (1926), except for the organ solo section, which is a note-for-note quotation of the Allemande of Bach's 1st French Suite in D minor, BWV 812. On the original Cotillion Records USA release of the Emerson, Lake & Palmer LP, \"Knife-Edge\" was credited entirely to Emerson, Lake and Fraser without any mention of Jan\u00e1\u010dek or Bach; however, on the British Manticore LP re-release, Sinfonietta and Jan\u00e1\u010dek were listed in the album credits, including on the back cover, and Keith Emerson has often mentioned the French Suite quote, including in the 1977 Keyboard Magazine interview. Re-issues of Emerson, Lake & Palmer on compact disc have used the older credits.\nGreg Lake said of Fraser in March 1972: \"He was a roadie, a roadie's roadie, called 'Dynamite Legs.' We got to be good friends with him. He helped one day with the words, so we gave him the credit. We only gave him credit. We never gave him any money.\" Prior to Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Fraser was a roadie for King Crimson (which also included Lake in its lineup), and he later became a roadie for Genesis.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Pictures at an Exhibition (Emerson, Lake & Palmer album)", "response": ["All music by Modest Mussorgsky, except where noted.
