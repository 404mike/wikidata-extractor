His research embraces a wide range of areas across ancient Greek culture, and has resulted in publications that contribute to scholarship on ancient Greek music and metre, innovation in ancient Greece, Latin and Greek lyric poetry, the biography of Socrates and the status of Aspasia of Miletus. He writes poetry in ancient Greek and Latin, and was commissioned to compose odes in ancient Greek verse for the 2004 and 2012 Olympic Games.\nD'Angour's researches into the sounds of ancient Greek music (2013 to date) are considered groundbreaking in potentially establishing, through his scholarly recreation of the sound of the earliest substantial notated document of Greek music (from Euripides' drama Orestes), connections between ancient Greek music and much later Western musical traditions.D'Angour's book Socrates in Love (published in March 2019) presents new evidence for a radically revisionist historical thesis regarding the role of Aspasia of Miletus in the development of Socrates' thought. His How to Innovate: An Ancient Guide to Creative Thinking (Princeton 2021) distils for the general reader some of the findings relating to innovation explored in his academic monograph The Greeks and the New: Newness and Novelty in Ancient Greek Imagination and Experience (Cambridge 2011).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Arion", "response": ["Herodotus (1.23) says \"Arion was second to none of the lyre-players in his time and was also the first man we know of to compose and name the dithyramb and teach it in Corinth\". However J.H. Sleeman observes of the dithyramb, or circular chorus, \"It is first mentioned by Archilochus (c 665 BC) \u2026 Arion flourished at least 50 years later \u2026 probably gave it a more artistic form, adding a chorus of 50 people, personating satyrs\u2026 who danced around an altar of Dionysus. He was doubtless the first to introduce the dithyramb into Corinth\".J.H. Sleeman, ed. Herodotus Book I. Armand D'Angour notes that Arion's contribution to the reform of the dithyramb, which was eventually performed in a circle and called kuklios choros, was recognised by ancient sources by the fact that they named his father 'Kukleus' ('Circle-man').'How the Dithyramb got its shape'.

The meaning of these is still uncertain. According to an ancient source (known as the Anonymus Bellermanni), they represent an 'arsis', which has been taken to mean a kind of 'upbeat' ('arsis' means 'raising' in Greek); Armand D'Angour argues, however, that this does not rule out the possibility of a dynamic stress. Another view, by Solomon, is that the stigmai \"signify a rhythmical emphasis\".Solomon, J. \"Orestes 344\u201345: Colometry and Music\".

Socrates also claims to have learned from her on more than one occasion. These indications have been used to argue for Diotima's independent existence; but more plausibly they may account for why Plato does not directly attribute \"Diotima's doctrine of Love\" either to Aspasia or to Socrates (her doctrine ends up as being evidently Platonic in relation to its introduction of Forms). In 2019 Armand D'Angour extracted new evidence from the text of Symposium to suggest that at least the main model for Diotima was Aspasia (even though the doctrines she expounds are more Plato's rather than Aspasia's): the connection of the name 'Diotima' (honored by Zeus) to Pericles (regularly called 'Zeus' in comedy, and famously said to have honored his consort Aspasia); and the relationship of the action of \"postponing the Plague by 10 years\" to the notorious misconduct by Pericles at the siege of Samos in 440-439, which will have caused concerns about divine retribution falling on Athens that in the event did not appear to come to fruition until the Plague of 430-429.", "In 2019 Oxford professor Armand D'Angour published Socrates in Love: The Making of a Philosopher, presenting for the first time a wholly new case for identifying Diotima with Aspasia. His historical arguments are based on 1) the likelihood of Aspasia's involvement in the warding off of plague that Athenians will have expected to be brought on by Pericles' irreligious actions (e.g. failure to bury the dead) after his campaign against Samos in 440-39 2) the fact that 'Diotima' means 'honored by/honoring Zeus'; Pericles was called 'Zeus' in comedy and popular parlance, and he was notorious for the unusual honor that he bestowed on Aspasia."]}, {"page": "Syracusia", "response": ["British classical scholar Armand D'Angour has argued that the construction of the Syracusia by Archimedes at the behest of Hieron II underlies the more implausible story told by Vitruvius that Hieron asked Archimedes to assess the metal content of a fabricated gold crown.

First translations of the poem would derive from Catullus' re-visitation of the poem, Catullus 51, painting Sappho with a green taint of jealousy.
