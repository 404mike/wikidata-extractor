All students were subject to a rigid curfew, and daily chapel attendance was mandatory. If a student wished to leave college grounds, they were required to wear a cap and gown. The college was deliberately built away from the temptations of the city proper. This was all part of Strachan's plan to counteract the University of Toronto's secularism through modelling his vision of conservative Anglican education. Strachan was supported in these efforts by George Whitaker, a clergyman from Cambridge University who served as Trinity's divinity professor and first Provost. Strachan's hatred of the secular university was so great that Trinity's student athletes were forbidden to compete against students from the University of Toronto.Watson, Andrew. Trinity, 1852-1952. Trinity University Review, 1952, p. 28. It is not well known what the general student body thought of these rules, although there are records of students having cached their formal garb in the College ravine and clandestinely visiting town in informal clothes.Watson, Andrew. Trinity, 1852-1952. Trinity University Review, 1952, p. 11-17. Despite the rigid rules and church culture, beer consumption formed an important element of student life, and students purchased over 100 gallons of ale a year from a nearby brewery.", "The largest component of the western wing, as well as the central dining hall and social space for students residing at Trinity College, Strachan Hall was built in elaborate wood and stone with the intention of matching the aesthetics of the existing college. It is replete with decorations intended to extol the history and values of the college, with heraldric artist A. Scott Carter commissioned to execute paintings and carvings of the coats of arms belonging to founder John Strachan, Queen Victoria, St Hilda's College, the Trinity Medical College, Provost Cosgrave, and Gerald Larkin. Adorning the walls of the Strachan Hall are portraits of the College Provosts, the founder John Strachan, and Sir John Beverley Robinson - Chief Justice of Upper Canada and the college's first chancellor. The largest portraits, which hang from the north wall, are of Bishop Strachan and George Whitaker, the college's first provost from 1852 to 1880. Hanging on the front wall prominently behind the High Table is a large medieval tapestry provenant of Gerald Larkin's enthusiastic patronage, believed to have been woven in Flanders in the sixteenth century to depict the coming of the Queen of Sheba to the court of King Solomon.", "#George Whitaker 1851 to 1881"]}, {"page": "Bratton, Wiltshire", "response": ["* Rev.

However, the lay synod delegates were opposed to the clergy candidate and proposed a Reverend Dr Sullivan as their candidate, who was then on his way from Chicago to Montreal to take up the rectory there. Neither candidate received the necessary number of votes to become the bishop.
