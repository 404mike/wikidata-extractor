A soldier with The Bedfordshire Regiment during the First World War, he was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions on 27 September 1916, during the Battle of the Somme. He later served in the Second World War.\nAdlam was twenty two years old, and a temporary second lieutenant in the 7th Battalion, The Bedfordshire Regiment, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place on 27 September 1916 at Thiepval, France, for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.\n\nA portion of a village which had defied capture on the previous day had to be captured at all costs to permit subsequent operations to develop. This minor operation came under very heavy machine gun and rifle fire. Second Lieutenant Adlam realising that time was all important, rushed from shell hole to shell hole under heavy fire collecting men for a sudden rush, and for this purpose also collected many enemy grenades. At this stage he was wounded in the leg, but nevertheless he was able to outthrow the enemy and then seizing his opportunity, and in spite of his wound, he led a rush, captured the position and killed the occupants. Throughout the day he continued to lead his men in bombing attacks. On the following day he again displayed courage of the highest order, and though again wounded and unable to throw bombs, he continued to lead his men. His magnificent example and valour, coupled with the skilful handling of the situation, produced far-reaching results.\nMajor-General (later Lieutenant-General, Sir) Ivor Maxse, commanding 18th (Eastern) Division later wrote that Adlam\u2019s bravery and example and also his skilful handling of his unit was \u2018chiefly responsible for the success of the two companies of the Bedfordshire regiment, who cleared and made good the last bit of the Thiepval objective ...It was, in fact, a successful minor operation without which the main attack on Schwaben Redoubt could not take place\u2019.When interviewed in 1973, Adlam declared: \u2018Some officers would think that they had to do better than their own men.  But if I found a man who could do something better than me I\u2019d say \u2018Well do that\u2019.  And I think they like it ... A man likes to be recognised as being a responsible person.\u2019  Simkins would argue that this was an example of initiative being delegated down from division to the man on the spot, as early as the Somme battles.In civilian life, Adlam was a teacher at Brook Street School in Basingstoke and a member of the National Union of Teachers.Adlam served in the Second World War with the Royal Engineers (Movement Control Section), and achieved the rank of lieutenant colonel. \nHis Victoria Cross is displayed at Salisbury Guild Hall.Adlam's voice was used in Peter Jackson's World War I film, They Shall Not Grow Old.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Salisbury", "response": ["*Lieutenant Colonel Tom Edwin Adlam VC (1893 in Salisbury \u2013 1975)Imperial War Museums  retrieved 29 September 2017 recipient of the Victoria Cross"]}, {"page": "Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Regiment", "response": ["The 7th (Service) Battalion served entirely on the Western Front in the 54th Brigade, 18th (Eastern) Division from July 1915 until it was disbanded in May 1918. 2nd Lieutenant Tom Edwin Adlam won the Victoria Cross during the battalion's assault against the Schwaben Redoubt in September 1916 and stretcher bearer Christopher Augustus Cox won the battalion's second Victoria Cross during operations opposite Achiet Le Grand in March 1917. When the battalion was reduced to a cadre in May 1918, the personnel were folded into the 2nd (Regular) Battalion, who took their place in the 18th Division."]}]}}
