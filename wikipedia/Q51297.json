Faraday is introduced in the Season 4 premiere as a physicist from the Queen's College, University of Oxford. He suffers from short-term memory loss, possibly due to his experiments with radioactivity. He is part of the team aboard the  freighter Kahana that is offshore the island. Throughout his time on the series, Faraday plays an important role by sharing his knowledge of time travel. After time traveling to 1977, Faraday is shot and killed by Eloise Hawking (Alice Evans) who is unaware that he is her son.\nJeremy Davies was cast in the role because of the \"tremendous intelligence that seems to emanate from him\" and was one of the writer-producers' favorite character actors. Davies was critically praised for his performance and critics were generally disappointed by the character's death in season five. UGO.com named him one of the best TV nerds.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Queen's College, Oxford", "response": ["* Daniel Faraday and The Constant in Lost"]}, {"page": "List of theoretical physicists", "response": ["* Daniel Faraday"]}, {"page": "Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor on Television", "response": ["| Daniel Faraday"]}, {"page": "Teresa", "response": ["*Theresa Spencer, girlfriend and research partner of the character Daniel Faraday from the TV series Lost"]}, {"page": "List of Lost characters", "response": ["| Daniel Faraday", "| Daniel Faraday || Jeremy Davies || 4, 5|| 6", "|colspan=\"6\"| thumb|100px|Henry Ian Cusick Desmond, a former monk and member of the Royal Scots Regiment, undertakes a boat race around the world after splitting with his girlfriend Penelope Widmore. He shipwrecks on the island while on this race, and he lives in a hatch for three years, pressing a button every 108 minutes. One day he neglects to push the button, and on this day Flight 815 crashes. The survivors find the hatch and blow it open, and when they take over pushing the button he attempts (unsuccessfully) to escape the island. After he returns to the island, he moves in with the crash survivors. At the start of the third season, Desmond starts seeing flashes of future events, most of them being about Charlie's death. Later, he experiences flashes into the past. He escapes the Island with the Oceanic Six at the end of season four and is reunited with his girlfriend, Penny. They are married and have a baby boy named Charlie. Desmond has various meetings with Eloise Hawking who urges him not to marry Penny Widmore. He later finds out she is Daniel Faraday's mother, locates her through Charles Widmore, and visits her at the Lamppost.

Before she is revealed as such, she is introduced as a jewelry store employee who urges Desmond not to marry Penny, and explains the nature of time travel to him. Later, in the monastery Desmond briefly lives in, she also appears in a photograph in the head monk's office. Eloise is the mother of Daniel Faraday, the father being Charles Widmore, and, like Widmore, was formerly a member of the Others. The rat that Daniel trains to run a maze in Desmond's presence is named after her. She instructs Jack, Sun, and Ben on how to get back to the island.

Widmore admits to Daniel Faraday he staged the find of the false plane wreckage of Oceanic 815, and he sends the freighter Kahana to the Island in order to find and capture Ben, which is unsuccessful. Widmore disapproves of his daughter's relationship with Desmond Hume and is estranged from her. However, when Desmond is searching for Eloise Hawking, it is Widmore who informs him of her location in Los Angeles. He is still actively searching for the Island and tries to assist Locke in reuniting the Oceanic Six into going back to the Island. Later, he returns to the island with Desmond Hume, who he describes as a \"failsafe\". He gives this information to the Man in Black in return for a guarantee of safety for his daughter Penny, but Ben shoots him dead.", "|colspan=\"5\"| Penny is Desmond's wife and the estranged daughter of Charles Widmore, as well as the half sister to Daniel Faraday. Before Desmond went missing and crashed on the island she was his longtime girlfriend, although they broke up shortly before. Nevertheless, Penny searched for any sign of him and was alerted to his location when the Swan DHARMA station exploded at the end of season two. At the end of season three she was able to communicate briefly with Charlie after the jamming of communications from the island was lifted. When Desmond made contact with Penelope during \"The Constant\" the communication was garbled just as she began to tell how she knew of the Island, but confirmed she knew of it. She was able to rescue Desmond, the Oceanic Six and Frank by boat at the end of season four. Desmond and Penny then married and proceeded to have a son, whom they also named Charlie. Ben Linus hunts Penelope down with intent to kill her in retaliation for his own daughter's death indirectly at the hands of Charles Widmore, but he changes heart when he sees she is now a mother."]}, {"page": "Nuclear weapons in popular culture", "response": ["* The third episode of Losts fifth season, \"Jughead\", reveals that the United States military brought a hydrogen bomb called Jughead to the island in 1954; the military troops were killed by the Others and the bomb was seized. A time-traveling Daniel Faraday convinces the Others that he is part of a military science team sent to defuse the bomb, which is leaking radioactive material, but eventually confides to one of their members that the bomb must be buried underground after being sealed with lead or concrete, explaining that he knows this will work because the island is still intact 50 years later, having never been destroyed in a nuclear blast. However, in 1977, the bomb was used in an attempt to stop the Incident, in the hope of changing the future."]}, {"page": "Charlie Pace", "response": ["In the episode \"LA X\", Charlie is seen on board Oceanic 815, in the restroom with heroin, as seen in the \"Pilot\" episode.

He is revived by Jack and later arrested for possession of illegal drugs. He later claims, while he was unconscious, he had a vision of a \"beautiful, rapturous\" woman who is implied to be Claire. Glaring at Jack as he is restrained, he snarls \"I was meant to die.\" In the episode \"Recon\", Charlie's brother, Liam, was at a police station, the same one Sawyer and Miles work at, asking about Charlie. In the episode \"Happily Ever After\" Charlie is released from jail and greeted by Desmond Hume. Desmond has been tasked by his boss, Charles Widmore (Alan Dale), with bringing Charlie and his band Drive Shaft to play with Charles' son, Daniel Faraday (Jeremy Davies), at a charity concert. Desmond does not succeed since Charlie runs Desmond's car into the water, which triggers Desmond's memory of Charlie's death in the original timeline. Desmond escapes and rescues Charlie from the submerged vehicle. In the episode \"The End\", Charlie is tranquilized by Hurley in order to carry him to the concert which he was scheduled to perform. While on stage, he sees Claire sitting in the crowd and realizes she's the one he saw when he almost died.

He then sees a vision of Ana Lucia Cortez (Michelle Rodriguez), who informs him of how to avoid the police. He returns to his house and confesses to his parents what actually happened on the island. Hurley's father takes the unconscious Sayid to Jack and orders Jack to stay away from Hurley. While alone in his house, Hurley is approached by Ben Linus, who asks Hurley to come with him so they can go back to the island, to which Hurley declines. Hurley runs outside of his house, confessing to the murders that Sayid committed, and is arrested. Ben later has his lawyer get the charges dropped against Hurley, who is released from jail. Hurley leaves jail in a taxi, and rides along with Jacob who asks Hurley why he does not want to return to the Island. Jacob explains to Hurley that he is not cursed, and leaves a guitar case with Hurley. Hurley takes Jacob's advice and goes to LA X to leave on the flight with Sun, Jack, Sayid, Kate and Ben. During the flight, the plane encounters severe turbulence and a bright flash of light and disappears. Hurley finds himself on the Island's lake, where he is saved by Jack.

An edit to the film, which according to Inman was made by Radzinsky, removed specific details of this incident. This event required the entire Swan station area to be sealed with a large amount of concrete \"like Chernobyl\" (according to Sayid and Daniel Faraday) to contain the dangerous energy. This caused a consistent build-up of electromagnetic energy, which resulted in a change of the station's focus: a two-member crew, replaced every 540 days, were instructed to enter a numeric code into a microcomputer terminal every 108 minutes.
