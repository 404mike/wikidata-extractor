Gauld mainly appeared for the club's B team, and was also loaned to Vit\u00f3ria de Set\u00fabal, Aves, Farense and Hibernian. In July 2019, Gauld moved to Farense on a permanent basis. In July 2021 he signed with MLS club Vancouver Whitecaps FC.\nGauld has represented Scotland at under-19 and under-21 level.
