The Who featured in several promotional clips, beginning with their 1965 clip for \"I Can't Explain\". Their plot clip for \"Happy Jack\" (1966) shows the band acting like a gang of thieves. The promo film to \"Call Me Lightning\" (1968) tells a story of how drummer Keith Moon came to join the group: The other three band members are having tea inside what looks like an abandoned hangar when suddenly a \"bleeding box\" arrives, out of which jumps a fast-running, time lapse, Moon that the other members subsequently try to get a hold of in a sped-up slapstick chasing sequence to wind him down. Pink Floyd produced promotional films for their songs, including \"San Francisco: Film\", directed by Anthony Stern, \"Scarecrow\", \"Arnold Layne\" and \"Interstellar Overdrive\", the latter directed by Peter Whitehead, who also made several pioneering clips for The Rolling Stones between 1966 and 1968. The Kinks made one of the first \"plot\" promotional clips for a song. For their single \"Dead End Street\" (1966) a miniature comic movie was made. The BBC reportedly refused to air the clip because it was considered to be in \"poor taste\".", "The Rolling Stones appeared in many promotional clips for their songs in the 1960s. In 1966, Peter Whitehead directed two promo clips for their single \"Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing In The Shadow?\" In 1967, Whitehead directed a plot clip colour promo clip for the Stones single \"We Love You\", which first aired in August 1967. This clip featured sped-up footage of the group recording in the studio, intercut with a mock trial that clearly alludes to the drug prosecutions of Mick Jagger and Keith Richards underway at that time. Jagger's girlfriend Marianne Faithfull appears in the trial scenes and presents the \"judge\" (Richards) with what may be the infamous fur rug that had featured so prominently in the press reports of the drug bust at Richards' house in early 1967. When it is pulled back, it reveals an apparently naked Jagger with chains around his ankles. The clip concludes with scenes of the Stones in the studio intercut with footage that had previously been used in the \"concert version\" promo clip for \"Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby\". The group also filmed a color promo clip for the song \"2000 Light Years From Home\" (from their album Their Satanic Majesties Request) directed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg. In 1968, Michael Lindsay-Hogg directed three clips for their single \"Jumpin' Jack Flash\" / \"Child Of The Moon\"\u2014a color clip for \"Child Of The Moon\" and two different clips for \"Jumpin' Jack Flash\".
