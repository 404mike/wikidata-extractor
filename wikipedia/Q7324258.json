Boon participated on the writing of several Buzzcocks songs, using the pen name Alan Dial. Seeking to release the band's music, Boon started the New Hormones label. The label released the Spiral Scratch EP in January 1977, and began releasing records by other artists regularly from 1979 to 1982. During this time acts such as Biting Tongues, Diagram Brothers, Dislocation Dance, Ludus and Eric Random all released early records with the Manchester-based label.\nRichard Boon went on to work for Rough Trade Records, and is now a librarian in Stoke Newington Library, Hackney, London, where he facilitates a monthly reading group on the second Tuesday of each month.On 6 July 1983 The Smiths appeared live at the Hacienda, Manchester, and Morrissey dedicated the song \"I Don't Owe You Anything\" to Boon.Boon contributed a regular column to the Stoke Newington free quarterly community magazine N16, and is part of the crew at the annual Stoke Newington Literary Festival, held first weekend of June", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Joy Division", "response": ["Buzzcocks manager Richard Boon and frontman Pete Shelley have both been credited with suggesting the band name \"Stiff Kittens\", but the band settled on \"Warsaw\" shortly before their first gig, a reference to David Bowie's song \"Warszawa\". Warsaw debuted on 29 May 1977 at the Electric Circus, supporting the Buzzcocks, Penetration and John Cooper Clarke. Tony Tabac played drums that night after joining the band two days earlier. Reviews in the NME by Paul Morley and in Sounds by Ian Wood brought them immediate national exposure. Mason became the band's manager and Tabac was replaced on drums in June 1977 by Steve Brotherdale, who also played in the punk band The Panik. Brotherdale tried to get Curtis to leave the band and join The Panik, and even had Curtis audition. In July 1977, Warsaw recorded five demo tracks at Pennine Sound Studios, Oldham. Uneasy with Brotherdale's aggressive personality, the band fired him soon after the sessions: driving home from the studio, they pulled over and asked Brotherdale to check on a flat tyre; when he got out of the car, they drove off."]}, {"page": "Stoke Newington", "response": ["* Richard Boon the former manager of Buzzcocks, lives in Stoke Newington and formerly worked at Stoke Newington Library."]}, {"page": "Howard Devoto", "response": ["Born in Scunthorpe, Devoto grew up in Nuneaton, Warwickshire and Moortown, Leeds, where he attended Leeds Grammar School and met and befriended future Buzzcocks manager Richard Boon.Savage, John.
