He showed that the Notch ligand (a molecule involved in cell-to-cell communication) controls the timing of nerve cell differentiation and the synchronised cycling of neighbouring cell activity. He modelled the cellular oscillatory circuit that determines the segmentation of the developing body, and clarified the importance of delay kinetics in setting the frequency of those oscillations.He was an undergraduate at Balliol College, Oxford from 1964.   He was elected a member of the European Molecular Biology Organization in 2005.  The British Society for Developmental Biology awarded him the Waddington Medal in 2003.  He became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 2012.\nAs well as leading a research team at Cancer Research UK's London Research Institute, he was co-author of Molecular Biology of The Cell, Alberts et al., and Essential Cell Biology, Alberts et al., popular biology textbooks.\nHe died in April 2014 after living with prostate cancer for a decade.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 30", "response": ["*  2014   \u2013 Julian Lewis, English biologist and academic (b. 1946)"]}, {"page": "Julian Lewis", "response": ["Julian Lewis has been described by The Daily Telegraph as \"one of the most vigorous rightwingers in the Commons\" and by The Guardian as the Conservative Party's \"front bench terrier\".

He maintained that: \"At no stage did I claim for the flooring and it did not cost the taxpayer a penny.\" A senior Commons official confirmed that, by seeking advice in advance about second home expenditure, he had acted \"in accordance with best practice as recommended by this department\" and that \"it is not true that you attempted to claim \u00a36,000 in expenses for a wooden floor at your second home\".", "From May 2013 onwards, he strongly opposed arming the rebels in the Syrian civil war, arguing that Assad's chemical weapons would pose a deadly threat to the West if they fell into the hands of jihadists fighting on the side of the opposition. On 29 August, the Coalition Government's motion in support of the principle of military intervention was defeated by just 13 votes. Julian Lewis spoke and voted against the Government's motion.", "produced under the chairmanship of Julian Lewis have been:", "In February 2018, Julian Lewis and his French counterpart Jean-Jacques Bridey agreed to launch a joint Inquiry by their respective committees into the UK-France future cruise/anti-ship weapon project.
