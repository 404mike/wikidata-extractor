Kedwell scored again in the 54th minute from a penalty after Garry Thompson committed a foul in his own box; however, Gillingham gave away a penalty not long after, which Nahki Wells happily converted. The game was wrapped up when Myles Weston made it 3\u20131 to ensure the Bantams got their league campaign off to a losing start. The Bantams' next match was at home to newly promoted Fleetwood Town; Bradford won the game 1\u20130 after Gary Jones crossed the ball in for James Hanson to head it into the net, giving the Bantams their first win of the season.

A first half brace from centre back Richard Hinds and a debut goal from winger Keanu Marsh-Brown helped Yeovil to a comfortable 3\u20130 victory over their League One rivals. The draw for the second round of the League Cup took place the following day and presented Yeovil with a home tie against Premier League side West Bromwich Albion. Prior to the first match of the league season, on 18 August, the Football League Trophy draw took place on Soccer AM with Yeovil drawn away against Bristol Rovers in the first round of the competition. Later in the day, in Yeovil's opening league match against Coventry City the club fell behind early from a Cody McDonald header, before Richard Hinds scored his third goal in a week as the game ended in a 1\u20131 draw. The following Tuesday, Yeovil's first away game saw a trip to Brentford in an eventful game Yeovil ran out 3\u20131 victors thanks to a brace from James Hayter and a penalty save from Marek \u0160t\u011bch. Hinds's goal scoring form and impressive performances earned him a place in the League One Team of the Week. On 23 August, Chelsea youngster Archange Nkumu joined the club on a one-month loan deal as cover for injured fellow Chelsea loanee Rohan Ince, and Curtis Haynes-Brown left the club to join League Two side AFC Wimbledon on a one-month loan deal. Yeovil's next away trip saw a match against bottom of the League side Scunthorpe United and courtesy of a first half goal from Keanu Marsh-Brown and second half goals from Reuben Reid and a brace from Gozie Ugwu gave Yeovil a 4\u20130 away victory. The result sent Yeovil to the top of League One for the first time in their history, the result saw four players receive recognition from the Football League Team of the Week goalkeeper Marek \u0160t\u011bch was joined by full backs Luke Ayling and Jamie McAllister along with midfielder Ed Upson. On 28 August in the League Cup second round tie against West Brom despite an impressive performance and a brace from forward Reuben Reid, the match saw Yeovil eventually overpowered to lose 4\u20132. Yeovil's performances in the month of August led to the nomination of Gary Johnson for Manager of the Month and defender Richard Hinds for Player of the Month, both though lost out to Ronnie Moore and Andy Robinson, both of Tranmere Rovers, respectively.", "Yeovil's dismal run of form continued into October, and despite a Reuben Reid penalty the club suffered a 2\u20131 home defeat against Portsmouth, their sixth consecutive defeat as the club slid to 16th in the League One table. The game proved more costly for Yeovil than merely a defeat with injuries to both Lewis Young, ankle ligament damage and Gozie Ugwu, recurrence of a hamstring injury, ruling them both out for the month of October, in an attempt to arrest this run of form and as cover for those injuries, on 4 October, Gary Johnson completed the loan signing of Republic of Ireland U21 striker Paddy Madden from Carlisle United. The move worked with immediate effect with Madden scoring a brace on his debut and Hayter adding a third in a 3\u20131 victory over Colchester United. The poor run of form though was reflected by the Colchester United match being the club's lowest ever Football League attendance of just 3,002. This improved performance led to a double nomination in the Football League's Team of the Week with Irish duo Madden and winger Sam Foley both represented. On 9 October, Yeovil's away Football League Trophy tie against Torquay United was postponed due to a waterlogged pitch at Plainmoor, with the match rescheduled for the following week on the following Saturday the winner of the tie was given the reward of a home Area Quarter-final tie against Wycombe Wanderers in the next round. Another encouraging performance away at league leaders Tranmere Rovers saw Yeovil take a 2\u20130 lead after half an hour thanks to goals from Madden and Foley, but another second half collapse saw Tranmere comeback to win the game 3\u20132 with Yeovil's plight not aided by having Joe Edwards sent off for two yellow cards. In their rearranged tie on 16 October, Yeovil salvaged a 2\u20132 draw against Torquay United with a stoppage time equaliser from James Hayter, to add to his earlier goal, with Yeovil winning the tie 5\u20134 on penalties, having scored all five of their spot kicks and keeper Marek \u0160t\u011bch having saved Torquay's Thomas Cruise's effort. The victory confirming Yeovil's progress to the Area Quarter-final stage of the Football League Trophy, for the first time in five years, with a home tie against Wycombe Wanderers. An unconvincing 2\u20131 victory over a ten-man Bury followed courtesy of goals from Byron Webster and Foley, the performance of midfielder Korey Smith earned him recognition in the League One Team of the Week. That weekend in the draw for the FA Cup First Round Proper Yeovil were given an away tie against fellow League One side Preston North End, to be played on 3 November. On 23 October, with injuries continuing to hamper the squad young Jamaican-born midfielder Daniel Johnson joined the club on a month-long youth loan deal from Aston Villa. That evening Yeovil strolled to a 3\u20131 victory over Shrewsbury Town courtesy of a brace from Paddy Madden and a goal from top scorer Hayter who took his tally for the season to seven, Daniel Johnson made his debut as a second-half substitute but had the ignominy of giving away a penalty. Yeovil ended the month with a third consecutive victory this time a 1\u20130 away win against Crewe Alexandra thanks to a second goal in a week for defender Byron Webster, the result was also only Yeovil's second clean sheet in the League that season. After a two-month loan spell at AFC Wimbledon, defender Curtis Haynes-Brown returned to the club having made six appearances for the Dons. Webster's winning goal and the club's second league clean sheet of the season led to his inclusion in the Football League's Team of the Week.", "On 1 November, after lengthy negotiations with Carlisle United the club agreed to extend the loan of striker Paddy Madden until January, the Irish forward having scored five goals in his five appearances in the first month of his loan deal. Gary Johnson also did not rule out a permanent deal for the Carlisle striker suggesting it was part of the discussions to extend his loan deal. On 3 November, Yeovil's FA Cup ended with a first round away defeat at Preston North End. The 3\u20130 lacklustre defeat was not helped by the sending off of Ed Upson, who coincidentally was sent off in the corresponding league fixture in September. Yeovil's three game winning run in the league came to an abrupt end with a 3\u20131 home defeat against high flying Stevenage despite a further goal by inform loan striker Paddy Madden early in the first half. The club though got back to winning ways the following on 10 November, courtesy of a goal from Bristol City loanee Joe Edwards after seven minutes to give the side a 1\u20130 win over bottom of the league side Hartlepool United. The same day youth team goalkeeper Matt Cafer joined Sherborne Town on a work-experience loan deal. Luke Ayling's performance in the victory over Hartlepool United led to his inclusion in the Football League Team of the Week. Yeovil's inconsistent form continued throughout November with a 4\u20131 defeat at the hands of Swindon Town, including a goal from former striker Andy Williams, followed, on 20 November, by an impressive 1\u20130 away win against Cralwey Town. The conclusion of the loan transfer window saw Yeovil extend the loan of defender Dan Burn until January, and bring in Watford defender Dale Bennett on loan also until the new year. Meanwhile Daniel Johnson returned to Aston Villa, and defender Curtis Haynes-Brown was sent out on loan again this time to Conference National side Cambridge United, it was also announced the club had taken former Canadian international winger Jaime Peters on trial. The team ended the month in 12th place following a 3\u20131 home defeat at the hands of Carlisle United.", "The opening of the January transfer window saw Yeovil complete the free transfer of Irish midfielder Kevin Dawson on a contract until the end of the season from League of Ireland side Shelbourne, the signing came too late for Dawson to be permitted to feature in Yeovil's New Year's Day fixture against Leyton Orient. A brace from Paddy Madden and a goal for top scorer James Hayter led Yeovil to a 3\u20130 victory over Leyton Orient, the result saw Yeovil climb to 9th place in the League One table and to within three points of the play-off positions. Following the game the club confirmed the permanent signing of Carlisle United loanee Madden on two-and-a-half-year deal for an undisclosed fee following the completion of his highly successful loan spell scoring nine goals in sixteen appearances for the Glovers. Yeovil completed their third signing of the transfer window with the addition of left sided midfielder Matthew Dolan on a one-month loan deal from Middlesbrough, but the day also saw the departure of left-back Curtis Haynes-Brown on a free transfer to Football Conference side Cambridge United on a free transfer, Haynes-Brown having only appeared in thirteen matches in eighteen months for Yeovil still had six months left to run on his contract. Prior to the Football League Trophy Southern Area semi-final tie against Leyton Orient, Yeovil confirmed that Fulham defender Dan Burn had extended his youth loan until the end of the season with an agreement for a further extension should Yeovil be involved in the play-offs. With the club funding free transport for away fans to travel to Leyton Orient for the Football League Trophy area semi-final the game saw Yeovil supported by 815 travelling fans for the trip to London, but the match ended in disappointment for the away side with a late Dave Mooney header condemning Yeovil to defeat despite having a man advantage for the last fifteen minutes. On 12 January, Yeovil recorded their first victory over Sheffield United, courtesy of a brace from Paddy Madden on his permanent debut for the club. The 2\u20130 victory at Bramall Lane saw Yeovil climb to eighth in the league table and to within a point of the play-off positions. Impressive performances from midfielders Kevin Dawson and Matthew Dolan on their league debuts at Sheffield United and in recognition of Paddy Madden's brace all three were included in the League One Team of the Week. On 17 January, Yeovil confirmed the signing of versatile defender/midfielder and former loanee Joe Edwards, from Bristol City on an 18-month contract for an undisclosed fee. Edwards's permanent debut was delayed due to Yeovil's league game against Preston North End, on 19 January, being postponed due to health and safety problems in the area surrounding the stadium because of heavy snowfall in the Yeovil area. On 25 January, out of favour striker Reuben Reid joined his former club Football League Two side Plymouth Argyle on loan for an initial month. Later that day out of favour winger Keanu Marsh-Brown also left the club having his contract cancelled by mutual consent, having not featured in the club's matchday squads since Boxing Day. On 28 January, Yeovil made their fifth signing of the transfer window with Crystal Palace striker Kwesi Appiah joining the club on a month's loan. Yeovil ended their extended break from match action due to postponements with a crucial 2\u20131 victory over play-off chasers Milton Keynes Dons, on 29 January. A third consecutive brace from Paddy Madden saw the Glovers to victory over the 10-man Dons. The result saw Yeovil end the month in seventh place just one position and three points outside the play-offs, the month seeing them win all three of their league matches and top scorer Paddy Madden scoring six goals in just three appearances. Despite a 100% winning record in the league manager Gary Johnson being lost out in the race for Manager of the Month to Walsall manager Dean Smith, but striker Paddy Madden's six goals were enough to secure him the Player of the Month award."]}]}}
