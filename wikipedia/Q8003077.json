He guested for Crystal Palace during the war and was offered a professional contract with Palace when the war ended. However, he chose to remain as an amateur with South Shields where he was assistant manager and masseur in addition to being a player.\nIn January 1923, Shields' manager Jimmy Lawrence left to manage Preston North End with Scott joining him as trainer. He continued in that role until March 1941, when he became club secretary, leaving in April 1947 to become manager of Blackburn Rovers. His term at Blackburn was cut short when he fell ill, and in his time in charge between March and the start of December 1947, Blackburn Rovers struggled, winning just 8 and losing 16 of his 28 games. Despite his ill health, he remained with the club as a scout.\nHaving recovered from illness, Scott became manager of Preston in June 1949. Preston won 78, lost 49 and drew 36 of his 163 matches at the helm. He led Preston to the Second Division title in the 1950\u201351 season and when he left in March 1953 Preston were challenging for the Football League title, eventually finishing as runners-up on goal average.\nHe was later assistant manager of Sunderland.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Blackburn Rovers F.C.", "response": ["| Will Scott"]}, {"page": "William Scott", "response": ["* William Matthew Scott (1893\u20131964), pen name Will Scott, English author", "* Will Scott (1893\u20131972), English footballer and football manager"]}, {"page": "Tom Finney", "response": ["The following year, Finney saw an advert placed by Preston North End in the local newspaper for junior players aged fourteen to eighteen.

He went home to get his father's approval but Alf Finney refused, insisting that he must first complete his apprenticeship before signing professional terms. Preston were nevertheless happy with this and Finney joined them as an amateur, doing his training in the evenings after work and eligible to play for the club's junior teams.Agnew, pp. 19-23."]}]}}
