He made 531 appearances in all competitions in 15 seasons as a player in the Football League, and as a manager took charge for 1,195 competitive matches.\nBorn in Meir, Stoke-on-Trent, he joined local club Stoke City as an amateur in 1964, making his first-team debut in September 1968. A hard-tackling defender, he soon established himself in the first team, playing in a centre-back partnership with Alan Bloor for much of his career. Stoke enjoyed one of the most successful periods of their history during his time at the club, as he helped Stoke to win the League Cup in 1972, featuring in successive FA Cup semi-finals in 1971 and 1972 and helping the club to successive fifth-place finishes in the First Division in 1973\u201374 and 1974\u201375. His bravery as a player meant that he also entered the Guinness Book of Records as the most injured man in football, although he was never able to fully recover after breaking his leg for the fifth time in his career in March 1975. He did manage to continue to play competitive football, and helped Stoke to win promotion from the Second Division in 1978\u201379. He missed the entire 1980\u201381 season due to injury, and left the club in May 1982.\nHe began his management career at York City in May 1982, having played for the club on loan the previous season. He led the club to the Fourth Division title in 1983\u201384, totalling five seasons at the club . He took charge of Sunderland in May 1987, and took the club to the Third Division title in 1987\u201388, before getting the club promoted from the Second Division in 1989\u201390. Dismissed by Sunderland in December 1991, he took charge at Bristol City three months later. He steered the club away from relegation in 1992\u201393, but was dismissed in January 1993 after falling out with the club's directors. He was appointed manager of Oxford United in September 1993 and, although unable to avoid relegation in 1993\u201394, led the club to promotion from the Second Division in 1995\u201396. He switched clubs to West Bromwich Albion in December 1997, remaining in charge for two-and-a-half seasons before being dismissed in July 1999.\nHe returned to manage Oxford in February 2000, and steered the club away from relegation in 1999\u20132000 before resigning in October 2000. In October 2001 he was appointed manager of Wrexham, but was unable to steer the club away from relegation in 2001\u201302. He won promotion from the Third Division at the first attempt in 2002\u201303, but Wrexham entered administration in December 2004 and the resulting points deduction saw them relegated once more. Despite the financial problems he managed the club to the Football League Trophy title in 2005, in addition to two successive FAW Premier Cup wins in 2002 and 2003. He was dismissed in January 2007, months after the club exited administration.

He was sold to Newcastle United in February 1993 and later played for Manchester United, where he collected five Premier League titles, two FA Cups and the European Cup.", "Coach Tony Fawthrop took over until the end of the season, when Danny Wilson was appointed.

Albion were hovering just above the relegation zone in Division One (which had been a familiar pattern since their promotion in 1993) and Harford did much to keep the club clear of relegation. Despite a promising start to the following season, he said that found it tiring to travel the 100+ miles from his Berkshire home to the Midlands on an almost daily basis, and in December 1997 moved to Division One rivals Queens Park Rangers. His successor, Denis Smith, claimed that Harford had told him the real reason he decided to leave the club was that an ageing team and a lack of investment from the boardroom meant that the club were \"heading for a fall\"."]}, {"page": "Bryan Robson", "response": ["Robson experienced top-flight football for the first time during the 1976\u201377 season, and began to appear more regularly in the side, although he was still alternating between the positions of left back and his preferred central midfield role.

Playing at left back, he broke his left leg in a tackle with Tottenham Hotspur striker Chris Jones.Robson (2007), pp. 30\u201332.

Unfortunately they were beaten in a shock 5\u20130 defeat at Accrington Stanley on 13 September 2006, then followed by a 5\u20132 defeat at Stockport County. Both of these teams were struggling at the foot of the table when these defeats happened, and Wrexham never fully recovered from them. This would begin the start of a long relegation battle for Wrexham. Denis Smith was sacked along with his assistant Kevin Russell on 11 January 2007 with Wrexham in the bottom half of the division and after a poor run of results and was replaced by coach Brian Carey. Wrexham finished 19th in Football League Two and on 51 points after an impressive late run of form which saw them win 4 out of their last 5 games, which included defeating local rivals Shrewsbury in the last derby match at Gay Meadow. Wrexham's league status was saved on the last day of the season with a vital 3\u20131 victory on 5 May 2007 over Boston United at home which sent their opponents down to the Conference Premier (they were later demoted to the Conference North) and ensured that Wrexham would stay in the Football League.", "* Denis Smith", "* 2001\u20132007 Denis Smith"]}, {"page": "Oxford United F.C.", "response": ["Former Liverpool defender Mark Lawrenson was named as Oxford's new manager, but was unable to prevent relegation to the Second Division.

He remained in charge until September 1993, when he moved to Manchester City in the recently formed FA Premier League.
