Eduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic praised the band's musicianship, and remarked how the album has \"endured far better than most similarly styled heavy metal albums of the era\". He also touted the production as one of Rock's best alongside his work with Metallica. Rivadavia was, however, critical of the perceived Led Zeppelin influences found on some of the tracks. Author Martin Popoff awarded Blue Murder a score of seven out of ten in his 2005 book Collector's Guide to Heavy Metal, while Record Collectors William Pinfold gave the album four star out of five. White Wizzard guitarist Will Wallner, writing for Guitar World, called the album \"phenomenal\", with special praise being given to Sykes' playing. White Wizzard's Jon Leon, meanwhile, named Blue Murder one of his favourite obscure heavy metal records of the 1980s. Ultimate Classic Rock named Blue Murder the sixth best album produced by Bob Rock, while MetalSucks included it on a list of essential hair metal albums not included on a similar list by Rolling Stone. Radio and television personality Eddie Trunk also highlighted the album in his 2011 book Eddie Trunk's Essential Hard Rock and Heavy Metal."]}, {"page": "Colyton Grammar School", "response": ["*Will Wallner, musician"]}, {"page": "Metal Mind Productions", "response": ["*Will Wallner & Vivien Vain"]}, {"page": "White Wizzard", "response": ["In April 2013, Earache Records announced White Wizzard would release a third album titled The Devil's Cut.
