His career was largely undermined by the 1939-45 war gap. A right-arm medium-fast bowler and outstanding fielder, in the 1939 season he took 121 wickets at an average of 22.69 and during his career took 193 catches. He was unable to rediscover his pre-war form at the resumption of first-class cricket in 1946, and operated as a spin bowler in the 1950 and 1951 seasons.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1939 English cricket season", "response": ["Gloucestershire finished third under England captain Wally Hammond who scored 2121 championship runs.  Other good performers for Gloucestershire were batsmen Charlie Barnett, Jack Crapp and George Emmett; seam bowler Colin Scott and the outstanding spin bowler Tom Goddard who took 181 championship wickets."]}, {"page": "1947 English cricket season", "response": ["Middlesex won the toss and decided to bat, Brown and Edrich opening with a stand of 50 before Brown was out lbw to the seamer Colin Scott. Edrich went on to score 50 but, apart from some resistance by tailenders Sims and Young, Middlesex's batting collapsed as Gloucestershire's great off spinner Tom Goddard took seven for 70. Middlesex were all out for 180 but Sims (six for 65) and Young (four for 55) turned the tables and bowled out Gloucestershire for 153. At close of play on Saturday, Middlesex had reached 9 for 1 in their second innings, Goddard having taken the key wicket of Edrich, so Monday's play began with Middlesex ahead by 36 and nine wickets standing. The decisive phase of the match was a third wicket partnership on Monday morning between Harry Sharp and the captain Robins. Scoring 46 and 45 respectively, they shared a stand of 70 runs which Playfair described as \"vital\". Otherwise, Middlesex again collapsed and Goddard took eight for 86 to complete an outstanding match analysis of fifteen for 156. So Gloucestershire with a day and a half remaining needed 169 to win. Jack Crapp tried to hold the innings together and scored 40 but Gloucestershire were rolled over for only 100 to lose by 68 runs. Young took five for 27 but an important role was again played by Sharp, this time as an off spinner, taking the wickets of three of Gloucestershire's top six batsmen, two of them without scoring. Playfair points out that Sharp at the time was still only a member of the Lord's ground staff but he played the key part in winning the match that ultimately settled the championship.", "Gloucestershire's strong challenge for the title was despite the loss of Wally Hammond but in Tom Goddard they had the best bowler in the country. He took 238 wickets in all matches, 61 more than his nearest rival. He was well supported by Sam Cook who took 120 championship wickets and gained a Test call, but the team lacked quality pace bowlers with George Lambert largely on his own apart from the medium pace of Test batsman Charlie Barnett. Five Gloucestershire batsmen scored over 1,000 runs in the championship: captain Basil Allen, Barnett, Jack Crapp, George Emmett and wicket-keeper Andy Wilson. Playfair recorded concerns about the pitch at Bristol which was alleged by some to have been prepared especially for Goddard. It is true that Gloucestershire won eight of the nine matches played there but equally true that Goddard took most of his wickets in matches not at Bristol. Ken Graveney made his debut for Gloucestershire in 1947 and his brother Tom was waiting in the wings. Other players included Monty Cranfield, Bev Lyon, Clifford Monks, William Neale, Grahame Parker, Colin Scott and Alfred Wilcox.Playfair, pp. 85\u201387."]}, {"page": "IColin James Scott", "response": ["#REDIRECT Colin Scott (cricketer)"]}, {"page": "Colin Scott", "response": ["Colin Scott may refer to:", "* Colin Scott (footballer) (born 1970), Scottish goalkeeper", "* Colin Scott (rugby league) (born 1960), Australian rugby league footballer", "* Colin Scott (cricketer) (1919\u20131992), English cricketer", "* Colin Scott (bishop) (born 1933), Bishop of Hulme"]}, {"page": "Colin James Scott", "response": ["#REDIRECT Colin Scott (cricketer)"]}, {"page": "List of Gloucestershire County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Colin Scott (1938\u20131954) : C.
