He was educated at Perth Academy and the University of Edinburgh, but did not graduate, as on his father's death and while only seventeen, he had to take over the responsibilities of managing and running the affairs of a property estate at Gourdiehill near Errol, Perth and Kinross in the Carse of Gowrie, between Perth and Dundee. Over the years he successfully nurtured, cultivated, and transformed much of the estate's farmland and pastures into several large orchards of apple and pear trees, numbering over 10,000.  He became an avid proponent as well as interested researcher of both silviculture and horticulture, both of which influenced his growing awareness of the forces of nature.  This awareness, along with his own experiences acquired from years of working his own modest estate would later frame a strong base of reference to form his own opinions and theories.Calman, WT (1912) \"Patrick Matthew of Gourdiehill, Naturalist\", Handbook and Guide to Dundee and District, AW Paton and AH Millar (Eds), the British Association for the Advancement of Science, pp. 451-7 (see The Patrick Matthew Project \u00bb More On Matthew"]}, {"page": "HMS Camperdown (1885)", "response": ["HMS Camperdown was an Admiral-class battleship of the Royal Navy, named after Adam Duncan, 1st Viscount Duncan of Camperdown."]}, {"page": "Pinz\u00f3n Island", "response": ["Pinz\u00f3n Island (Spanish: Isla Pinz\u00f3n), sometimes called Duncan Island (after Adam Duncan, 1st Viscount Duncan), is an island in the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, Ecuador."]}, {"page": "Adam Duncan Duncan", "response": ["#REDIRECT Adam Duncan, 1st Viscount Duncan"]}, {"page": "Adam Duncan, Viscount Duncan of Camperdown", "response": ["#REDIRECT Adam Duncan, 1st Viscount Duncan"]}, {"page": "Order of Saint Alexander Nevsky", "response": ["* Adam Duncan, 1st Viscount Duncan"]}, {"page": "Clan Duncan", "response": ["*Camperdown House was built by the Duncans in the nineteenth century in four hundred acres of park land.
