While the precise details on activities of the carrier's squadrons are not readily available, it is known that the commanding officer of 854 Squadron was forced to ditch his Avenger on the morning of 27 March with the loss of both his crewmen; he was ultimately rescued that evening by an American submarine. On the afternoon of 6 April, four kamikaze aircraft evaded detection and interception by the CAP, and one, a Yokosuka D4Y3 \"Judy\" dive bomber, attacked Illustrious in a steep dive. The light AA guns managed to sever its port wing so that it missed the ship, although its starboard wingtip shattered the Type 272's radome mounted on the front of the bridge. When the  bomb that it was carrying detonated in the water only  from the side of the ship, the resulting shock wave badly damaged two Corsairs parked on the deck and severely shook the ship. The initial damage assessment was that little harm had been done, although vibrations had worsened, but this was incorrect as the damage to the hull structure and plating proved to be extensive. Vice Admiral Sir Bernard Rawlings, commander of Task Force 57, ordered the recently arrived Formidable to join the task force to replace Illustrious on 8 April. In the meantime, she continued to conduct operations with the rest of the fleet. On 12 and 13 April, the BPF switched targets to airfields in northern Formosa and her sister joined the task force on 14 April. Since the beginning of the operation, her aircraft had flown 234 offensive and 209 defensive sorties, claiming at least two aircraft shot down. Her own losses were two Avengers and three Corsairs lost in action and one Avenger and six Corsairs due to non-combat causes.Brown 1971, pp. 258\u201359, 261; Hobbs 2011, pp. 134, 136, 142\u201343, 145, 147; McCart, p. 32"]}, {"page": "HMS Manchester (15)", "response": ["The Admiralty convened a Board of Enquiry on 16 September to establish the facts of the cruiser's loss using testimony provided by available witnesses.

Vice-Admiral Bernard Rawlings, second in command of the BPF, and his staff had determined that bombardment of Japanese gun positions by the heavy guns of battleships and cruisers might be a more effective method of destroying them than aerial attack. They detached King George V and Howe, as well as five cruisers, that morning to bombard Nobara and Hiara airfields while fighters flew a protective CAP over them and spotted the fall of their shells. The loss of the most effective anti-aircraft ships was more important than anticipated and the Japanese were able to take advantage of the opportunity. The carrier had just launched two Corsairs for bombardment-spotting duties and the deck park of eleven Avengers was being moved forward to allow aircraft to land when an undetected Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter attacked at 11:31. The Zero first strafed the flight deck before any of Formidables guns could open fire and then turned sharply to dive into the forward flight deck despite the ship's hard turn to starboard. The fighter released a bomb shortly before it would have impacted the deck and was destroyed by the bomb's blast, although the remnants of the Zero struck Formidable.Hobbs 2011, pp. 175\u2013176"]}, {"page": "British Pacific Fleet", "response": ["During World War II, the fleet was commanded by Admiral Sir Bruce Fraser.

The main body of the BPF arrived at Manus to refuel on 30 May, and most of its ships continued to Sydney on 1 June. Implacable remained at Manus, which she and her air group used as a base for intensive training. As part of the preparations for the BPF's return to combat the commander of the fleet's combat force, Vice-Admiral Bernard Rawlings,  decided at around this time to dispatch Implacable and several other recently arrived warships to attack the Japanese positions at Truk. The purpose of this operation was to ensure that the warships' crews had recent combat experience before the BPF commenced operations off Japan during July. Rawlings' initial orders for the attack specified that it was to involve two days of air strikes against Japanese airfields. The crews of the ships involved, including Implacables aircraft pilots, were not told that the main purpose of the operation was training."]}, {"page": "1st Battle Squadron", "response": ["* Rear-Admiral Bernard Rawlings (1940\u201341)", "* Vice-Admiral Sir Bernard Rawlings (1944\u201345)"]}, {"page": "Joint task force", "response": ["|Southeast Pacific Force, Rear Admiral Francis Whiting, December 1, 1943; 110-series designation for British Pacific Fleet Carrier Task Force under Vice Admiral Bernard Rawlings, Vice-Admiral BPF, aboard , November 1945.CINCPAC War Diary, 11/1-30/45, accessed April 2020."]}, {"page": "List of Knights Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire", "response": ["*1946: 1st Baron Alness, Edward Appleton, Thomas Barlow, Muhammad Ahmad Said Khan Chhatari, Douglas Evill, Henry French, Alexander Hood, Maurice Holmes, Harold Howitt, Hubert Huddleston, 1st Baron Iliffe, John Kennedy, Arthur Power, Charles Kennedy-Purvis, Henry Peat, Thomas Williams Phillips, Hubert Rance, Bernard Rawlings, James Somerville, 1st Viscount Slim, 1st Baronet Thomson, Maharaja of Tripura"]}, {"page": "List of English people", "response": ["* Bernard Rawlings (1889\u20131962), admiral, second in command of the British Pacific Fleet during Second World War"]}, {"page": "Henry Rawlings", "response": ["#REDIRECTBernard Rawlings (Royal Navy officer)"]}, {"page": "Flag Officer, West Africa", "response": ["|2 || Vice-Admiral ||25px  ||Bernard Rawlings ||May - November, 1943 || "]}, {"page": "Attack on Yokosuka", "response": ["Nagatos presence at Yokosuka was revealed to the Allies by photographs taken during the 10\u00a0July raid on the Tokyo area.
