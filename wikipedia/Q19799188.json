In World War Two she served in the Women's Royal Naval Service. After the War she became a local government officer in the Middlesex Education Department, where she worked until the success of her first novel allowed her to become a full-time writer and move to Lewes, East Sussex, where she lived for the rest of her life.Hocking's novels were published by Chatto & Windus. They are characterized by wit and irony, and their subject matter often includes central women characters and their relationships with families, or individuals seen against a background of work and society, with moral questions asked. Most of Hocking's novels are set in the contemporary world, although He Who Plays the King (1980) is a historical novel set in the last years of the Wars of the Roses. Her last novel, The Meeting Place (1996), included time-slip scenes. The Fairley family trilogy - Good Daughters (1984), Indifferent Heroes (1985) and Welcome, Stranger (1988) - is family saga spanning several decades of the twentieth century, including the Second World War; Letters from Constance (1991) is an epistolary novel that looks back over the same period.\nNick Totton commented about The Mind has Mountains in The Spectator: \"Mary Hocking writes brilliantly on many levels at once, because she knows that the everyday contains another, stranger reality: it only takes attention, an at first casual intensification of vision, to open the crack between the worlds ... The Mind Has Mountains is a funny, serious book, to be read and reread: the kind of book that bides its time, perhaps remaining an innocuous entertainment for years until a reader is opened to it by explosive experience\u2014'so that was what it meant!' It is a Steppenwolf for our time; and, I think, the equal of Hesse's.\"Mary Hocking died in 2014.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Haberdashers' School for Girls", "response": ["*Mary Hocking, author (1921\u20132014) (Class of 1939)"]}]}}
