He noted the book's insights on the origins of Arab disunity, citing Sykes\u2013Picot Agreement and the inability of Arabs to (re)unite following independence because of their inherent disunity that traces all the way back to Basus War in 5th-6th century. The translated poems earned a special mention by Hijjawi, who found them very pleasant to read with their orderly qaafiyaa, and he praised their complete faithfullness to original meaning, citing the author's use of the 40-volume Arabic dictionary Taj al-Arus. The humorous style, love for Arabic language and heartfelt criticisms were hailed as distinct features, putting the author above any accusation of arrogant orientalism as characterized by Edward Said. Finally, he pleaded for the book to be translated to Arabic."]}]}}
