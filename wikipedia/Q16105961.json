Footage from a Zoom call was released of Prince Michael, alongside Simon Isaacs, 4th Marquess of Reading, interacting with undercover reporters posing as business executives seeking to make contacts with the Kremlin. In the video, he assured the men that his close ties with the country would be of benefit, and that he could introduce them to high-ranking figures within the Russian government in exchange for money. The call took place the day after the European Union imposed sanctions on the Kremlin. Michael was being offered \u00a3143,000 for a proposal and \u00a336,000 a month by the faux businessmen, which he expressed satisfaction with. The Marquess claimed that Prince Michael was the Queen's \"unofficial ambassador to Russia\" and had direct access to Putin. He later stated that he had \"overpromised\", while the prince said that he had not had contact with Putin since 2003. In a 2019 interview, Michael stated that he visited Russia twice a year as part of his work for the Russo-British Chamber of Commerce."]}, {"page": "List of marquesses in the peerages of Britain and Ireland", "response": ["| Simon Isaacs, 4th Marquess of Reading"]}, {"page": "Bisley, Gloucestershire", "response": ["The area is noted for the wealth of its Cotswold stone houses of architectural and historic interest.Stroud Council Conservation Area No. 6 Bisley  They include Lypiatt Park, formerly the home of Judge H.
