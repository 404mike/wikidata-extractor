The only school to be represented on this occasion was Charterhouse. The Freemasons' Tavern was the setting for five more meetings between October and December, which eventually produced the first comprehensive set of rules. At the final meeting, the first FA treasurer, the representative from Blackheath, withdrew his club from the FA over the removal of two draft rules at the previous meeting: the first allowed for running with the ball in hand; the second for obstructing such a run by hacking (kicking an opponent in the shins), tripping and holding. Other English rugby clubs followed this lead and did not join the FA and instead in 1871 formed the Rugby Football Union. The eleven remaining clubs, under the charge of Ebenezer Cobb Morley, went on to ratify the original thirteen laws of the game. These rules included handling of the ball by \"marks\" and the lack of a crossbar, rules which made it remarkably similar to Victorian rules football being developed at that time in Australia. The Sheffield FA played by its own rules until the 1870s with the FA absorbing some of its rules until there was little difference between the games."]}, {"page": "November 20", "response": ["*1924 \u2013 Ebenezer Cobb Morley, English sportsman and the father of the Football Association and modern football (b. 1831)"]}, {"page": "United Kingdom", "response": ["A 2003 poll found that football is the most popular sport in the United Kingdom.

Thirdly, to William McGregor, the founder of the Football League was inducted to commemorate the organisation's 125th anniversary.
