They moved to Bangor when Ednyfed was a child. Although both sets of grandparents were Welsh speaking, differences in dialect sometimes made communication difficult.Hudson Davies was educated at Dynevor Grammar School, Swansea, the University College, Wales in Swansea, and Balliol College, Oxford. He became a lecturer in government and a broadcaster. Davies was elected Labour Party MP for Conway in 1966, serving there until 1970.  He was later elected for Caerphilly, in 1979. In 1981, he was among the Labour MPs who defected to the new Social Democratic Party.In 1983, in Caerphilly, it was the Liberal side of the SDP-Liberal Alliance which put up a candidate. Davies therefore did not stand in Caerphilly, but was adopted in Basingstoke, having moved to the New Forest after marrying Amanda Barker-Mill in 1972. He lost comprehensively as it was a strongly Conservative seat.  The Liberals also did not win in Caerphilly.\nHudson-Davies remained active in public life as chairman of a museum trust in the New Forest in the south of England.His first marriage ended in divorce in 1994 and in 2016 he married Sue Owen. He had twin daughters from his first marriage and a stepdaughter from his second.He died on 11 January 2018, aged 88.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1983 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Ednyfed Hudson Davies"]}, {"page": "1970 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["*Ednyfed Hudson Davies (Conway)"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1979 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Ednyfed Hudson Davies"]}, {"page": "Davies", "response": ["* Ednyfed Hudson Davies (1929\u20132018), Welsh politician"]}, {"page": "Caerphilly (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|rowspan=\"2\"| Ednyfed Hudson Davies"]}, {"page": "Conwy (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Ednyfed Hudson Davies"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1966 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Ednyfed Hudson Davies"]}, {"page": "1982 Social Democratic Party leadership election", "response": ["* Ednyfed Hudson Davies"]}, {"page": "List of Social Democratic Party (UK) MPs", "response": ["| Ednyfed Hudson Davies"]}, {"page": "Tom Ellis (politician)", "response": ["In 1981, Ellis became one of the founding members of the SDP.
