His memoirs were titled Never a Normal Man.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dracula", "response": ["Aside from the historical, Count Dracula also has literary progenitors. Academic Elizabeth Signorotti argues that Dracula is a response to the lesbian vampire of Sheridan Le Fanu's Carmilla (1872), \"correcting\" its emphasis on female desire. Bram Stoker's great-nephew, broadcaster Daniel Farson, wrote a biography of the author; in it, he doubts that Stoker was aware of the lesbian elements of Carmilla, but nonetheless notes that it influenced him profoundly. Farson writes that an inscription upon a tomb in Dracula is a direct allusion to Carmilla. Scholar Alison Milbank observes that as Dracula can transform into a dog, Carmilla can become a cat. According to author Patrick McGrath, \"traces of Carmilla\" can be found in the three female vampires residing in Dracula castle. A short story written by Stoker and published after his death, \"Dracula's Guest\", has been seen as evidence of Carmilla influence.  According to Milbank, the story was a deleted first chapter from early in the original manuscript, and replicates Carmilla setting of Styria instead of Transylvania."]}, {"page": "The The", "response": ["* Fifty First State Press; a book publishing company whose name is inspired by the chorus of Johnson's 1986 song \"Heartland\".
