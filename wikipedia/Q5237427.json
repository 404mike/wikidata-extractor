He also influenced the poet Cyprian Norwid, philosopher Bronis\u0142aw Trentowski and philosopher, art historian and proto-psychologist J\u00f3zef Kremer. He is arguably the creator of the \"philosophy of action.\" His most important philosophical legacy is probably his influence on the young Karl Marx, via German communist and Young Hegelian Moses Hess. The latter adopted Cieszkowski's idea of that the dualism between consciousness and action would collapse in the latter part of the history of humanity, though he believed the synthesis had occurred on various occasions throughout history and located the transition to the 'third age' at the Reformation instead of the philosophy of Hegel. Scholars David McLellan and Shlomo Avineri argue that Marx, who was a friend of and collaborator with Hess from a few years from 1841 onwards, owes various aspects of his thought on alienation and the nature of and transition to communist society to Cieszkowski, including that the dualism between consciousness and action would collapse in revolutionary praxis. (Cieszkowski was one of the earliest philosophers to use the term praxis as meaning \"action oriented towards changing society\" in his Prolegomena zur Historiosophie).G.

Ko\u0142akowski further notes that while Marx does not use the term \"alienation\", the description of commodity fetishism found in the first chapter of Das Kapital (1867) is the same as in his earlier works, as is the analogy with religion which he owes to Feuerbach."]}, {"page": "Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844", "response": ["Marx discusses his conception of communism in his third manuscript. For Marx, communism is \"the positive expression of the abolition of private property\". Marx here claims that previous socialist writers had offered only partial, unsatisfactory insights on the overcoming of alienation. He mentions Proudhon, who advocated the abolition of capital, Fourier, who advocated a return to agricultural labor and Saint-Simon, who advocated the correct organization of industrial labor. Marx discusses two forms of communism that he deems inadequate. The first is \"crude communism\"\u2014the universalization of private property. This form of communism \"negates the personality of man in every sphere,\" as it does not abolish the category of worker but instead extends it to all men. It is an \"abstract negation of the entire world of culture and civilization.\" Here the only community is a community of (alienated) labor and the only equality is one of wages paid out by the community as universal capitalist.
