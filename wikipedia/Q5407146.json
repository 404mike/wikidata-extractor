Customary African law has been typified by  as more concerned with the resolution of disputes than the punishment of crimes. Many systems of customary African law have little recognition of crimes, in the sense of a specific offence committed against, and prosecuted by, a society as opposed to torts or civil wrongs to be pursued by the individual affected as a plaintiff. Some offences, for example patricide, incest or witchcraft were, however, so serious as to be regarded as crimes against the community involving the death of those guilty.T O Elias, (1972). The Nature of African Customary Law, Manchester University Press, pp. 110-12, 116 . . Although it has sometimes been claimed that, because of its flexibility and basis in custom, it was not really law, experts in African legal systems such as Eugene Cotran have demonstrated it was. Cotran also showed that, despite some informality, assemblies of people meeting to administer customary law are clearly courts. However, in the colonial period, English law and legal procedures were introduced and given priority over customary Law, which tended to be labelled \u201cnative law\u201d, \u201clocal law\u201d or \u201ctraditional law\u201d. Europeans also sought to codify these laws, which as a result, became increasingly rigid.E Cotran, (1966).
