He also played for several other Scottish clubs, in England with Bolton Wanderers, in Wales (albeit in the English Football League) with Cardiff City, and on both sides of the border in Ireland with Ballymena and Dundalk.

Their bid was rejected but they returned to meet Motherwell's asking price soon after; Ferguson signed for a fee of \u00a35,000, just \u00a31,000 less than the record transfer fee at the time. Such was his popularity at the Scottish club that the local steelworks closed for half an hour as the workers lined the streets to wave Ferguson off. A large crowd also gathered at the train station as he departed and a salute of 21 fog signals was issued from the David Colville & Sons works as he passed. Cardiff manager Fred Stewart, who was accompanying him, remarked that \"he had never seen a player given such a send-off before\". Ferguson was one of three Scots signed by Cardiff in short succession with Joe Cassidy and George McLachlan both arriving for a similar \u00a35,000 fee combined. Ferguson made a goalscoring debut for the club on 7 November 1925 in a 5\u20132 win over Leicester City, a match in which Cassidy scored a hat-trick. "]}, {"page": "George McLachlan", "response": ["Many English Football League clubs were interested in signing McLachlan but, in November 1926, he joined for Football League First Division side Cardiff City for \u00a32,000 (approximately \u00a3125,000 in 1925). He was persuaded to join City as his father was captain of a ship that regularly called at Cardiff docks. He was the third Scottish player to join the club in short succession, signing soon after Joe Cassidy and Hughie Ferguson. The trio cost a combined fee of \u00a310,000, with Ferguson accounting for half. McLachlan made his debut for Cardiff alongside Ferguson as the attacking trio combined in a 5\u20132 victory over Leicester City. His first goal for the club came on 16 January 1926, when he scored Cardiff's goal in a 1\u20131 draw with Everton. He added a brace three weeks later during a 4\u20131 win over Blackburn Rovers, while the Daily Herald reported that  \"he delighted City's supporters with his fine form\". However his season was ended when he suffered a broken leg in the return fixture against Leicester in March."]}, {"page": "Sam Irving", "response": ["In 1920, Irving joined Scottish Football League side Dundee where he quickly established himself in the first team. He spent six years with the club, making over 150 appearances in all competitions, despite suffering persistent knee injuries for several years. He helped the club to two top four finishes and reach the 1925 Scottish Cup Final where they were defeated by Celtic. He joined Football League First Division side Cardiff City in 1926 in a swap deal with Joe Cassidy. In his first year with the club, he helped them win both the FA Cup, becoming the only team from outside England to win the competition, and the Welsh Cup. He also won the 1927 FA Charity Shield the following year, but fell out of favour midway through the 1927\u201328 season.", "In June 1926, after six years with Dundee, Irving signed for Football League First Division side Cardiff City in an exchange deal that led to Joe Cassidy moving to Dundee, with the Scottish club also paying a fee towards the move. Irving had nearly joined Cardiff in February 1924 but the move had collapsed. He made his debut for Cardiff in a goalless draw with Leeds United on 30 August, before scoring his first goal on 9 October in a 3\u20130 win over Sheffield United. His early months were disrupted by a knee injury sustained after slipping down steps at a team hotel before a game against Bury and an infected finger that caused him to miss several matches in November. Having initially played at half back, he was moved to inside right in February 1927 and remained there for the rest of the campaign. Irving made 27 league appearances, scoring three times as Cardiff finished in 14th place. He also played in all six of the club's matches en route to reaching the 1927 FA Cup Final and was instrumental in his side's 3\u20132 victory over Chelsea in a sixth round replay, scoring one and assisting Len Davies for another. In the final, Irving started at inside right as Cardiff went on to beat Arsenal 1\u20130 to become the only side from outside England to win the competition. Two weeks later, Irving scored in the final of the Welsh Cup as Cardiff defeated Rhyl to complete a cup double."]}, {"page": "1920\u201321 British Home Championship", "response": ["|align=left|Joe Cassidy"]}, {"page": "1922\u201323 Scottish Cup", "response": ["|CF |||| Joe Cassidy"]}, {"page": "List of Celtic F.C. international footballers", "response": ["*Joe Cassidy (4)"]}, {"page": "Scotland national football team results (1920\u20131939)", "response": ["|Andrew Wilson, Joe Cassidy"]}, {"page": "1926\u201327 Cardiff City F.C. season", "response": ["By October 1925 Cardiff were bottom of the First Division table, leading manager Fred Stewart to implement several changes to the squad. As well as dropping some first team players he signed three new forwards, Joe Cassidy from Bolton Wanderers, George McLachlan from Clyde and Hughie Ferguson from Motherwell. The \u00a33,800 spent on Cassidy was a new club transfer record before Stewart broke the record again to sign Ferguson for \u00a35,000.

He was part of the side selected to play in the 1925 FA Cup Final, losing 1\u20130 to Sheffield United following a goal from Fred Tunstall. Despite his goal drought, during his time at the club Beadles won two caps for Wales, playing in consecutive matches on 14 and 28 February 1925 against Scotland and England in the 1924\u201325 British Home Championship. The following year, Beadles scored in the opening game of the 1925\u201326 season during a 3\u20132 defeat to Manchester City and scored three times in five further appearances in the opening months of the season.

He played football for Harp Athletic and Edinburgh Emmet before signing for Dundee in 1926, touted by the Dundee Evening Telegraph along with Jim Meagher and Andy Ramage as \"lads who will make a capital inside trio in the near future\". Flannigan was backup for Joe Cassidy in the 1926\u201327 season, and did not make his debut until the last First Division match of the campaign, on 30 April 1927. He played at inside left, alongside Ramage at centre forward, in a 3\u20130 win against Queen's Park.

Blair, Keenor and Willie Davies were absent due to international call-ups and Harry Wake was dropped from the defensive side of the line-up and the changes proved significant as they defeated Aston Villa 2\u20130. Stewart continued making changes and the club accepted an offer of \u00a33,200 for Gill from Blackpool, the striker leaving after five years with Cardiff. The money was given to Stewart to reinvest in the squad and the directors provided further transfer funds as the manager reshaped the club's attack. Joe Cassidy was signed from Bolton Wanderers for \u00a33,800 and George McLachlan from Clyde for \u00a32,000. The most significant signing was the arrival of Hughie Ferguson from Motherwell for a club record fee of \u00a35,000. The arrival of Ferguson was seen as a coup, with the Football Echo writing that the signing \"was regarded as a triumph for Mr Fred Stewart ... for prevailing upon the Scottish officials to part with their star player\". The new arrivals prompted a reshaping of the squad, with Beadles, Lawson and Jack Evans being largely omitted for the remainder of the season."]}]}}
