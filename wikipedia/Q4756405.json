A Machine Aesthetic (co-curated with Sim\u00f3n Granell), was a major national touring exhibition presenting the work of 11 contemporary British artists whose creative practices engaged with the concept of mechanisation. The exhibition explored the various manifestations, uses and influences of different aspects of mechanisation within the practices of an otherwise diverse group of artists (with Andrew Bracey, Eric Butcher, David Connearn, Rob Currie, Paul Goodfellow, Sim\u00f3n Granell, Emma Hart (artist), Dan Hays, Natasha Kidd, Tim Knowles, Michael Roberts). In conjunction with the exhibition, the curators guest edited an edition of the arts and culture magazine Garageland (issue XVI: Machines),[https://www.transitiongallery.co.uk/htmlpages/editions/GL16/intro.htm \"Garageland: issue XVI: Machines\" . which was themed to coincide with the show."]}, {"page": "Bracey (surname)", "response": ["*Andrew Bracey (born 1978), British artist"]}, {"page": "Bracey, Andrew", "response": ["#redirectAndrew Bracey"]}]}}
