Billy Bennett replaced Wigmore in the forward line. Playing against a strong wind, McRoberts opened the scoring when he was first to the rebound after his shot was fumbled, and Bennett converted a cross from Sid Wharton not long before the interval. Persistent attacking led to further goals, from Harry Wilcox and Walter Main, before the visitors' Herbert Munday scored when the ball rebounded off the crossbar.

On a pitch made slippery by a thunderstorm before kickoff, the visitors had Nat Robinson to thank for keeping Gainsborough Trinity at bay; the home side protested that one shot \"scooped out\" by Robinson had in fact crossed the line. Then McRoberts scored a solo goal, Trinity's goalkeeper allowed Wharton's shot from distance to slip through his hands into the net, and Wharton made the half-time score 3\u20130 after a move between McRoberts and Wigmore left him a tap-in. Freddie Fenton pulled one back with a header after Robinson missed his punch, and Bennett made the final score 4\u20131 after the goalkeeper failed to hold a low shot.\"Gainsbro' Trinity v.

Although Wrexham would have preferred to rearrange the game for the following Saturday, Small Heath had a league fixture against Woolwich Arsenal scheduled for that day, so guaranteed Wrexham \u00a350 from the gate money if they agreed to play in mid-week. Small Heath were too casual in the first half; after McRoberts opened the scoring with a header, they made little positive effort and were surprised by a long shot that tied the scores. In the second half, they resumed \"in a more business like style\", and scored five times. The Birmingham Daily Post remarked on Billy Bennett's accurate placement of corner kicks.Birmingham Daily Post (23 November 1899), quoted in \"Wrexham v. Small Heath\".
