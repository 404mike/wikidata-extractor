Wisden Cricketers' Almanack reported that \"the calm and compact Vikram Atri caught the eye, before he trudged off dejectedly, two shy of a century in his maiden first-class knock\". Atri's innings was characterised as \"patient\" and \"dogged\" in another report, which noted, however, nine \"graceful\" boundaries on the first day alone, when rain curtailed play.  In the event, Atri played only two further first-class matches for Nottinghamshire, both of them in the 2003 County Championship against Middlesex and Kent.  In 2003, he made his first-class debut for Loughborough UCCE against Somerset and from 2003 to 2005, he represented Loughborough UCCE in nine first-class matches, the last of which came against Worcestershire.  In his combined total of 12 first-class matches, he scored 548 runs at a batting average of 28.84, with four half centuries, although he never surpassed his 98 on debut.
