The early years of the firm coincided with major advances in surgical techniques. Leeds was a centre of high-calibre surgeons, many of whom made their names at the Infirmary; best known was Berkeley Moynihan, 1st Baron Moynihan, who achieved worldwide recognition for his contribution to abdominal surgery. It was Moynihan who first suggested to Charles Thackray that he should make instruments; and the firm, with its experience in repairs at their premises just across the road, was well placed to do so. By 1914 Thackray's was employing 25 people, including eight instrument makers and three full-time representatives. Salesmen visited customers over a wide area, supplying wholesale pharmaceuticals not only to hospitals and nursing homes but also to general practitioners serving rural areas. The War Office's acceptance of Thackray's \u2018Aseptic\u2019 range as standard field dressings was important to the firm, both ensuring large contracts for drugs and sundries. By 1918 Thackray's employed fourteen instrument makers, out of a total workforce of 32. In the 1930s the firm began to make its own hospital sterilizers, operating tables and other items of theatre furniture."]}, {"page": "Berkeley Moynihan", "response": ["#REDIRECT Berkeley Moynihan, 1st Baron Moynihan"]}]}}
