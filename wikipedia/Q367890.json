His writings on biology resulted from his research into natural history on and around the island of Lesbos, and have survived in the form of four books, usually known by their Latin names, De anima (On the Soul), Historia animalium (History of Animals), De generatione animalium (Generation of Animals), and De partibus animalium (On the Parts of Animals). Aristotle's works contain accurate observations, fitted into his own theories of the body's mechanisms. However, for Charles Singer, \"Nothing is more remarkable than [Aristotle's] efforts to [exhibit] the relationships of living things as a scala naturae.\" This scala naturae, described in Historia animalium, classified organisms in relation to a hierarchical but static \"Ladder of Life\" or \"great chain of being,\" placing them according to their complexity of structure and function, with organisms that showed greater vitality and ability to move described as \"higher organisms.\" Aristotle believed that features of living organisms showed clearly that they had what he called a final cause, that is to say that their form suited their function.

Her father was Nathaniel Louis Cohen, a stock broker, and her mother was Julia Matilda Waley. The industrialist and prominent leader of the Anglo-Jewish community, Sir Robert Waley Cohen, was one of her brothers, the English jurist and economist Jacob Waley her maternal grandfather.  Dorothea Cohen studied arts at Queen's College, London. In 1910 she married the physician Charles Singer. The couple later adopted two children, Andrew Waley Singer and Nancy Waley Singer. Nancy would go on to marry Edgar Ashworth Underwood, the director of the Wellcome Institute for the History of Medicine.", "At the time of her marriage Dorothea already was an aspiring expert on scientific manuscripts of the middle ages, and devoted herself to numerous philanthropic activities. For Charles Singer's career, marriage to the wealthy palaeographer would prove a turning point. His first historic work, on Benjamin Marten, a precursor of Louis Pasteur, appeared in 1911. With the support of his wife Charles Singer became one the central figures of interwar history of science and medicine. In turn, by his side Dorothea Singer trained herself as a medical historian. Her first papers were co-authored with her husband, starting with a publication on the development of contagium vivum,Charles und Dorothea Singer (1913). \"The development of the doctrine of contagium vivum, 1500-1750\", Proceedings of the 17th international congress on medicine, London 1913, Section 23, 187\u2013206. a concept relating to the theory of microorganisms as the cause of infectious diseases. By 1927 seven more joint papers had appeared, among them studies on the plague, the physician and poet Girolamo Fracastoro and the school of Salerno. Dorothea Singer also participated very actively in the planning and implementation of the famous 2nd International Congress on the History of Science and Technology in London, 29 June \u2013 4 July 1931, over which Charles Singer presided.William H.

Krige und D. Pestre (eds): Science in the twentieth century. Amsterdam, pp. 1\u201326.", "In parallel she started her own line of research specializing in Medieval and Early Modern palaeography. Her discussion of over 100 plague treatises from 1348 to 1485 appeared in 1916. During Charles' absence on war service she also began to dedicate herself to the monumental project of cataloguing all medical and scientific manuscripts in Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the Middle Ages to the early modern era. She had found over 30,000 by the end of 1918, presenting her results at the History of Medicine Society, the first women to do so in the history of the Society. The first volume of her catalogue of alchemical manuscripts was published in 1924 by the Union Acad\u00e9mique Internationale, focussing on the Greek manuscripts. A further three volumes appeared in the years up to 1931, dealing with Latin and vernacular manuscripts. Based on her experiences with this project Dorothea Singer gave presentations on palaeography at the University of California, where the Singers stayed in 1930 and 1932 (Charles Singer had accepted invitations as visiting professor).See e.g. Dorothea Waley Singer (1932). \"Preparation and use of manuscript catalogues', presentation on the occasion of the meeting of the Medical Library Association, San Francisco, California, 20-22 June 1932\", Bulletin of the Medical Library Association vol. 21, issue 2, 1932, 43\u201345.

In 1948 another paper introduced the term pattern welding to describe a method of strengthening and decorating iron and steel by welding into them twisted strips of metal; the method was employed on the Sutton Hoo sword among others, giving them a distinctive pattern.
