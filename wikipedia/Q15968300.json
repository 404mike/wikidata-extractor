Born in Guildford, he studied architecture in London before moving to Salisbury where he established his practice.\nBuildings he designed include  St Francis Church in Salisbury, Church of the Ascension in Plymouth and South Stoneham Tower in Southampton. He was also involved in substantial renovations to existing buildings including Chichester Cathedral, Oxford's Bodleian Library, St Peter Mancroft (the largest church building in Norwich other than the city's cathedrals) and St Stephen Walbrook, All Souls Church, Langham Place and St Paul's Cathedral, all in central London. His expertise in creating community spaces beneath the foundations of historical church buildings earned him the nickname \"The Mole\".\nPotter was awarded the OBE in 1993.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Peterhouse, Cambridge", "response": ["The north-west corner of the main site is occupied by former Victorian warehouses containing the Ward Library, as well as a theatre and function room. The building it is housed in was originally the University's Museum of Classical Archaeology and was designed by Basil Champneys in 1883. It was adapted to its modern purpose by Robert Potter in 1982 and opened in its current form as a library two years later.

After a major crack appeared in the ceiling in May 1976, it became clear that it would cost \u00a3150,000 to repair the building. And it would still remain a  large and inflexible Victorian barn of a building with very limited ancillary rooms. For a number of years, developers had been approaching the church wanting to make use of the prime site. Now, with a desperate need for action, another developer suggested a scheme with shops on the ground floor, the church above and still with an entrance on Above Bar Street. The church was positive about the plan and appointed Robert Potter, of Brandt Potter Associates, as architect. Royal Insurance Investment Department took over the developer's interest in the scheme and covered a substantial proportion of the building costs. The final service in the old building took place on 1 July 1979.", "David Jackman, who was appointed as Assistant Minister in 1976, became the Senior Minister on Leith Samuel's retirement in 1980. The new church building opened in 1981 and provided much better facilities than the previous one, though with a smaller seating capacity in the main body of the church. The auditorium, which seats over four hundred, was designed by Robert Potter as a hexagon, drawing on the concept of the amphitheatre with the partially tiered seating angled towards the front. The ceiling is made of Columbian pine, while much of the woodwork at ground level is beech. The communion table, made for the new building is of English elm. The basement, which was nearly not included in the project, has roughly the same area as the previous church hall, while the top hall is significantly larger. The organ was built by Copeman Hart for the church in 1977\u201379, and was first installed in the old building for a few months before demolition."]}, {"page": "South Stoneham House", "response": ["The extension was designed by Robert Potter and Richard Hare, while the associate architect in charge was JJA Caount.

Weakened by additions to the church tower and undermined by burials in and around the church, by the 19th century the building was structurally unsound.

By the 1990s the internal design of the church was beginning to be considered impractical for the needs of the community, and the interior was remodelled to a design by Robert Potter, with the works carried out in 1999. The west gallery was restored to house the 1852 organ, together with a kitchen and toilet facility, and the north transept was converted into a vestry with a room above it. Underfloor heating was built below a new marble floor and the chancel step replaced by an ovoid raised marble dais.
