It was released on 7 June 1995 by One Little Indian Records. Continuing the style developed on her first album Debut (1993), Post features an eclectic mixture of electronic and dance styles such as techno, trip hop, IDM, and house, but also ambient, jazz, industrial, and experimental music. Bj\u00f6rk produced Post herself with co-producers including Nellee Hooper, 808 State's Graham Massey, and former Massive Attack member Tricky. She wrote most of the songs after moving to London, and intended the album to convey the city's pace, urban culture, and underground club culture.", "For this record, Bj\u00f6rk incorporated shelved songs she wrote in Manchester with 808 State's Graham Massey, which had preceded the recording sessions for Debut. These included \"Army of Me\" and \"The Modern Things\", which had become live staples over the summer, and did not need to undergo extensive transformations at Compass Point. Massey stated: \"With \"Army of Me\" we wanted to try something that was quite hard and techno-y. I'm not sure how she wrote those lyrics so fast but I remember that song being almost instantaneous. [...] We kind of knocked that off in one day and then started on \"The Modern Things\" the same day and finished that the next\". Although the album was supposed to be delivered the day after she returned from the Bahamas, Bj\u00f6rk felt it was not yet complete and decided to continue its production back in London. She enlisted a new team of engineers and programmers, and spent the next months \"tweaking, rearranging, and sometimes completely rerecording her pre-existing tracks\". Ultimately, it was the inclusion of more \"real\" instruments that \"resuscitated Post for Bj\u00f6rk\".", "\"Possibly Maybe\" is an ambient track that a fuses trip hop and chill-out music. Bj\u00f6rk has said that it was the first unhappy song she wrote, stating in 1997: \"That was very hard for me. [...] I was ashamed writing a song that was not giving hope\". Its lyrics document the various stages of Bj\u00f6rk's ill-fated relationship with St\u00e9phane Sednaoui. With the track, De Vries \"create[ed] a vinyl-crackling ambience, full of glissando strings and leaden, muted bass. The slide guitar heard in the background of the song was originally intended to be its focal point, as Bj\u00f6rk initially strived for an \"ambient country\" sound inspired by Chris Isaak's \"Wicked Game\".  \"I Miss You\" was described in 1997 as an \"amalgam of styles, with electronic drums melding into African bongos mixed with jazzy horn playing\". A house music number, its \"horn-infused Afro-Cuban strains [...] reflect the romantic whimsy of [its] lyrics\". Bj\u00f6rk wrote \"Cover Me\", one of the quieter moments on the album, to her co-producer Nellee Hooper after he agreed to participate in the making of Post. She has said: \"I guess I was trying to make fun of myself, how dangerous I manage sometimes to make album making. And trying to lure him into it. But it is also  thing from me to him\". The album ends with the experimental \"Headphones\", an ambient track. Featuring \"just-for-headphones studio tricks\", it has been described as \"a chiming, somnolent dip into Bj\u00f6rk's heavy-lidded pre-dream state\". Its lyrics were written as a thank you to Graham Massey, who would make compilation cassettes for Bj\u00f6rk. She also stated: \"But, of course, it is also a love letter to sound. The sound of sound. Resonances, frequencies, silences and such... a music-worship thing\".", "In November 1996, Bj\u00f6rk released the \"often-delayed\" remix project Telegram, which contained reworkings of several songs from Post, with her voice re-recorded. Telegram has been described as \"effectively a completely new album\". Author Mark Pytlik writes, \"Promises of a Post remix album had been circulating since the release of \"Army of Me\" in April 1995. To compensate, Bj\u00f6rk announced the release of a string of 12\u2033 remixes beginning in June, limited to only 1,000 copies each. Producers and musicians featured on Telegram include: Dillinja, Eumir Deodato, LFO, and Graham Massey, among others; Bj\u00f6rk only remixed \"You've Been Flirting Again\" herself. The album also contains a new composition, \"My Spine\", a collaboration with British percussionist Evelyn Glennie. According to CMJ New Music Monthly, musically the album contains \"a real and surprising taste for recent trends in dance music\". Regarding the release, Bj\u00f6rk said: \"It's like the core of Post. That's why it's funny to call it a remix album, it's like the opposite. [...] Telegram is more stark, naked. Not trying to make it pretty or peaceable for the ear. Just a record I would buy myself\". Bj\u00f6rk also declared that the release of Telegram meant the end of an era consisting of Debut and Post. The compilation was well received by music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote, \"Telegram works as an excellent introduction to techno for alternative pop fans unsure of where to begin exploring.\" Douglas Wolk of CMJ New Music Monthly felt the music of Telegram was \"actually better than Post\", describing the tracks as, \"well-considered reworkings\". The Rolling Stone Album Guide gave the album three and a half stars, and stated it, \"shed new light on the songs\". Telegram spent five weeks on the US Billboard 200 chart, peaking at number 66.
