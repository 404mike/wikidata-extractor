The work, incorporating this colour nomenclature with some modifications, was translated into French by Claudine Guyton de Morveau (n\u00e9e Picardet) in 1790 and into English by Thomas Weaver in 1805. Patrick Syme (1774\u20131845), painter to the Wernerian and Horticultural Societies of Edinburgh, published in 1814 a revised version, entitled Werner's Nomenclature of Colours, with Additions, arranged so as to render it useful to the Arts and Sciences. In Germany, the scheme was favoured, for example, by the young polymath Novalis (Friedrich von Hardenberg) (1772\u20131801), who was impressed by its analytical character.William Jervis Jones (2013).
