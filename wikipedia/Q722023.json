The other two just thought he was crazy.\" McLaren later stated that, much earlier in the band's career, Vivienne Westwood had told him he should \"get the guy called John who came to the store a couple of times\" to be the singer. When Johnny Rotten was recruited for the band, Westwood said McLaren had got it wrong: \"he had got the wrong John.\" It was John Beverley, the future Vicious, she had been recommending.Blood on the Turntable: The Sex Pistols (dir. Steve Crabtree), BBC documentary (2004). McLaren approved the belated inclusion of Vicious, who had virtually no experience on his new instrument, on account of his look and reputation in the punk scene.", "McLaren had wanted for some time to make a movie featuring the Sex Pistols. Julien Temple's first major task had been to assemble Sex Pistols Number 1, a 25-minute mosaic of footage from various sources, much of it refilmed by Temple from television screens.Savage, Jon, England's Dreaming, pp. 339\u2013340. Number 1 was often screened at concert venues before the band took the stage. Using media footage from the Thames incident, Temple created another propaganda-like short, Jubilee Riverboat (aka Sex Pistols Number 2).Thompson, Stacy (winter 2004), \"Punk Cinema\", Cinema Journal 43, no. 2;  During summer 1977, McLaren had been making arrangements for the feature film of his dreams, Who Killed Bambi?, to be directed by Russ Meyer from a script by Roger Ebert. After a single day of shooting, 11 September, production ceased when it became clear that McLaren had failed to arrange financing.Savage, Jon. England's Dreaming, pp. 379\u2013380, 388\u2013389, 413\u2013414.", "Cook, Jones and Vicious never performed together again live after Rotten's departure. Over the next several months, McLaren arranged for recordings in Brazil (with Jones and Cook), Paris (with Vicious) and London; each of the three and others stepped in as lead vocalists on tracks that in some cases were far from what punk was expected to sound like. These recordings were to make up the musical soundtrack for the reconceived Pistols feature film project, directed by Julien Temple, to which McLaren was now devoting himself. On 30 June, a single credited to the Sex Pistols was released: on one side, notorious criminal Ronnie Biggs sang \"No One Is Innocent\" accompanied by Jones and Cook; on the other, Vicious sang the classic \"My Way\", over both a Jones\u2013Cook backing track and a string orchestra.Gimarc, George, Punk Diary, p. 145. Gimarc refers to sources claiming that the \"My Way\" recording involved no contact between Vicious and the Jones-Cook duo; Temple, however, says that Jones was flown over to Paris to join Vicious in the studio (Temple, Julien, \"Commentary\", 1:29:18\u20131:29:20), and seems to indicate that he recorded his guitar part there (1:33:09\u20131:33:16). The single reached number seven on the charts, eventually outselling all the singles with which Rotten was involved.Savage, Jon, England's Dreaming, p. 497\u2013498. Savage describes the single as being a double A-side; other sources indicate that the Biggs vocal was the A-side and the Vicious vocal the B-side (e.g., Gimarc, George, Punk Diary, p. 145). There is no disagreement that the Vicious side was the more popular. McLaren was seeking to reconstitute the band with a permanent new frontman, but Vicious\u2014McLaren's first choice\u2014had sickened of him. In return for agreeing to record \"My Way\", Vicious had demanded that McLaren sign a sheet of paper declaring that he was no longer Vicious's manager. In August, Vicious, back in London, delivered his final performances as a nominal Sex Pistol: recording and filming cover versions of two Eddie Cochran songs. The bassist's return to New York in September put an end to McLaren's dreaming.Savage, Jon, England's Dreaming, pp. 491\u2013494, 497\u2013503. For the management termination, see also Temple, Julien, \"Commentary\", 1:30:38\u20131:30:51.", "The Sex Pistols film was completed by Temple, who received sole credit for the script after McLaren had his name taken off the production. Finally released in 1980, The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle still largely reflects McLaren's vision. It is a fictionalized, farcical, partially animated retelling of the band's history and aftermath with McLaren in the lead role, Jones as second lead, and contributions from Vicious (including his memorable performance of \"My Way\") and Cook. It incorporates promotional videos shot for \"God Save the Queen\" and \"Pretty Vacant\" and extensive documentary footage as well, much of it focusing on Rotten. In Temple's description, he and McLaren conceived it as a \"very stylized...polemic\". They were reacting to the fact that the Pistols had become the \"poster on the bedroom wall of the day where you kneel down last thing at night and pray to your rock god. And that was never the point.... The myth had to be dynamited in some way. We had to make this film in a way to enrage the fans\".Salewicz, Chris, Interview with Julien Temple, 11:49\u201311:55, 13:19\u201313:36. In the film, McLaren claims to have created the band from scratch and engineered its notorious reputation; much of what structure the loose narrative has is based on McLaren's teaching a series of \"lessons\" to be learned from \"an invention of mine they called the punk rock\". Quote: Temple, Julien, The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle, 1:23\u20131:25.", "Toby Creswell argues that the \"Sex Pistols' agenda was inchoate, to say the least. It was a general call to rebellion that falls apart at the slightest scrutiny.\" Critic Ian Birch, writing in 1981, called \"stupid\" the claim that the Sex Pistols \"had any political significance.... If they did anything, they made a lot of people content with being nothing. They certainly didn't inspire the working classes.\"Mulholland, Neil, The Cultural Devolution, p. 68. While the Conservative triumph in 1979 may be taken as evidence for that position, Julien Temple has noted that the scene inspired by the Sex Pistols \"wasn't your kind of two-up, two-down working class normal families, most of it. It was over the edge of the precipice in social terms. They were actually giving a voice to an area of the working class that was almost beyond the pale.\"Salewicz, Chris, Interview with Julien Temple, 1:13\u20131:28. Within a year of \"Anarchy in the U.K.\" that voice was being echoed widely: scores if not hundreds of punk bands had formed across the country\u2014groups composed largely of working-class members or middle-class members who rejected their own class values and pursued solidarity with the working class.Albiez, Sean, \"Print the Truth\", p. 100; Henry, Tricia, Break All Rules, p. xi.", "* Salewicz, Chris, Interview with Julien Temple by Chris Salewicz (The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle DVD bonus feature), Shout!

Recording artists John Cougar Mellencamp, Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley of Kiss, along with directors Dominic Orlando and Julien Temple, provided a defense of their work. The episode's conclusion was that the controversy will continue to grow. Some artists have used censorship as a publicity tool. In the 1980s, the show Top of the Pops was censorious in its approach to video content, so some acts made videos that they knew would be censored, using the resulting public controversy to promote their release.
