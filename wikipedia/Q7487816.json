He was born at Inisherk in Fermanagh and died in Surrey. He attended Farra School in County Westmeath, he failed the Dublin University entrance exams and moved to London. He served on secretariat of Irish Home Rule Convention.Bullock's works include 14 novels set in Ulster and he was admired by J.M. Barrie and Thomas Hardy.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Thomas Andrews", "response": ["Although this has become one of the most famous stories of the Titanic disaster \u2013 published in a 1912 book (Thomas Andrews: Shipbuilder by Shan Bullock) and thereby perpetuated \u2013 there is circumstantial evidence to show that Stewart, in fact, left the ship in lifeboat No. 15 at approximately 1:40\u00a0a.m.,On a Sea of Glass: The Life & Loss of the RMS Titanic by Tad Fitch, J. Kent Layton & Bill Wormstedt. Amberley Books, March 2012. pp 321-323 half an hour before his reputed sighting of Andrews. In Thomas Andrews: Shipbuilder, Bullock wrote that Andrews likely stayed in the smoking room for some time to gather his thoughts, then continued assisting with the evacuation. Bullock even discussed several other very later sightings of Andrews after that moment. Another sighting of Andrews was around 2:00\u00a0a.m., where he was seen on the back of the boat deck. The crowd had begun to stir, but some women remained reluctant to leave the ship. To be heard and to draw attention to himself, Andrews waved his arms and called to them in a loud voice. This didn't do anything, so he began frantically throwing deck chairs into the ocean for people to use as floatation devices. Bullock also said that Andrews was seen, carrying a lifebelt, possibly the same lifebelt that was lying on the table in the smoking room, heading to the bridge, perhaps in search of Captain Smith. In addition, mess steward Cecil Fitzpatrick claimed to have seen Andrews and Captain Smith together on the bridge just a few minutes before the ship began its final plunge, and that both men jumped overboard just before the bridge was submerged.", "Newspaper accounts of the disaster labelled Andrews a hero. Mary Sloan, a stewardess on the ship, whom Andrews persuaded to enter a lifeboat, later wrote in a letter: \"Mr. Andrews met his fate like a true hero, realising the great danger, and gave up his life to save the women and children of the Titanic. They will find it hard to replace him.\" A short biography was produced within the year by Shan Bullock at the request of Sir Horace Plunkett, a member of Parliament, who felt that Andrews' life was worthy of being memorialised."]}, {"page": "Emily Lawless", "response": ["* The Race of Castlebar (1914) - co-authored with Shan Bullock"]}, {"page": "John William Bullock", "response": ["#redirectShan Bullock"]}, {"page": "Bullock, Shan Fadh", "response": ["#redirectShan Bullock"]}, {"page": "Shan Fadh Bullock", "response": ["#redirectShan Bullock"]}, {"page": "Farra School", "response": ["The writer and poet Shan Bullock (John William Bullock) attended Farra School.Shan F.
