He contributed to many periodicals, and was an esteemed leader-writer on The Spectator when that paper was under Robert Stephen Rintoul's editorship between 1828 and 1858.\nAs an author his greatest success was \u2018The Black Book, or Corruption Unmasked! Being an Account of Persons, Places, and Sinecures,\u2019 1820\u20133, 2 vols. Published by Effingham Wilson, and brought out when the reform excitement was commencing, it produced a considerable sensation, and fifty thousand copies were sold. With some alterations in the title, it was reproduced in 1831, 1832, and 1835.\nIn 1826 he wrote for Longmans \u2018The Cabinet Lawyer: a Popular Digest of the Laws of England,\u2019 the twenty-fifth edition of which appeared in 1829. Another popular work was \u2018British History, chronologically arranged,\u2019 1839; supplement 1841; 3rd edit. 1844; 5th edit. 1847. Effingham Wilson paid Wade so much a week for years while he was compiling the \u2018British History,\u2019 and supplied him with all the necessary works of reference.Wade also edited an annotated \u2018Junius, including Letters by the same Writer under other signatures,\u2019 (1850, in Bohn's \u2018Standard Library,\u2019 2 vols.). Here he was out of his depth, and the imperfections of his edition, and especially of his introduction, were pointed out by Charles W. Dilke in the \u2018Athen\u00e6um\u2019 of 2 Feb. et seq. Literature he did not find a profitable employment, and his main dependence in his later years was a civil-list pension of 50l., granted to him on 19 June 1862 by Lord Palmerston, chiefly on the representations of Effingham Wilson.\nHe was a vice-president of the historical section of the Institution d'Afrique of Paris.\nHe died at Chelsea on 29 Sept. 1875, and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery on 2 Oct.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Wade", "response": ["*John Wade (14th century), UK member of parliament for Lyme Regis in 1395", "*John Wade (born 1893), American architect, designed the Buffalo City Hall", "*John Wade (20th century), former Tennessee Commissioner of Tourist Development", "*John Wade (American football) (born 1975), American football center", "*John Wade (author) (1788\u20131875), British writer", "*John Wade (miller) (1842 England\u20131931), Australian cornflour manufacturer", "*John Wade (rower) (born 1928), American Olympic rower", "*John Wade (footballer) (1871\u20131937), professional English footballer", "*John Wade House, Massachusetts"]}, {"page": "Marshalsea", "response": ["Before the Bankruptcy Act 1869, debtors in England were routinely imprisoned at the pleasure of their creditors.
