He attended Wimbledon College, and went on to study at Balliol College, Oxford in the 1930s.During the Second World War he had a musical role with the RAF becoming a bandleader. After the War he completed his musical studies with Herbert Fryer. He bought a harpsichord at auction and went on to develop a career as a harpsichordist. He continued to make occasional appearances as a pianist, for example in Mozart's music for four hands and with the Dennis Brain Wind Ensemble (with whom he made one of his rare recordings as pianist in the first performance of the Gordon Jacob Sextet, written for the group). As a mentor, he also influenced a number of musicians not necessarily associated with the harpsichord such as Andras Schiff.", "link_mentions": {}}}
