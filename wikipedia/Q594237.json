He turned professional in 1992 and gained his European Tour card at the 1997 qualifying school. He finished in the top 100 of the Order of Merit every year from 1998 to 2004, and won for the first time on tour at the 2003 Daily Telegraph Damovo British Masters at his 158th tournament.At the 2001 Open Championship, Owen notably became only the sixth golfer in the history of the competition to score a rare albatross (double eagle), on the par-5 11th hole at Royal Lytham.Since 2005, Owen has played mainly in the United States being a full member of the PGA Tour in 2005\u201307, 2009\u201310 and 2012. His best finish in the United States was second at the 2006 Bay Hill Invitational, where he finished one shot behind Rod Pampling after playing the last two holes in three over par.Having lost his PGA Tour card at the end of 2007, he bounced back the following season, to graduate directly from the second tier Nationwide Tour by finishing in 10th place on the money list.In 2010 he finished 183rd on the PGA Tour money list and lost his card for the second time. In 2011 he played again on the Nationwide Tour, finishing 52nd on the money list. However he finished tied for 18th in the 2011 PGA Q School to regain his full PGA Tour card for 2012. He finished 85th in earnings in 2012, but was less successful in 2013, finishing 134th in the FedEx Cup.\nIn 2014 he split time between the PGA Tour and Web.com Tour; after winning the United Leasing Championship he finished 27th on the regular-season Web.com money list, missing out on a PGA Tour card by only $3,205. He went on to earn his card by finishing 10th on the Web.com Tour Finals money list.\nOwen was in the top 50 of the Official World Golf Rankings for three weeks in 2006 with his highest ranking being 49.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Arnold Palmer Invitational", "response": ["| 2006 ||  Rod Pampling || align=center|274 || align=center|\u221214 || 1 stroke ||  Greg Owen || align=right|990,000 || align=right|5,500,000"]}, {"page": "British Masters", "response": ["| 2003 ||  Greg Owen || align=center|274 || align=center|\u221214 || 3 strokes ||  Christian C\u00e9va\u00ebr Ian Poulter || Forest of Arden ||"]}, {"page": "Rod Pampling", "response": ["| Greg Owen"]}, {"page": "Reno\u2013Tahoe Open", "response": ["| 2017 || PGAT ||  Chris Stroud || colspan=2 align=center|44 points || Playoff ||  Greg Owen Richy Werenski || align=center|3,300,000 || align=center|594,000"]}, {"page": "Sanderson Farms Championship", "response": ["| 2016 ||  Cody Gribble || align=center|268 || align=center|\u221220 || 4 strokes ||  Chris Kirk Luke List Greg Owen || align=center|756,000 || align=center|4,200,000 || "]}, {"page": "Stadion Classic at UGA", "response": ["| 2008 || Robert Damron ||  || align=center|277 || align=center|\u221211 || Playoff ||  Greg Owen"]}, {"page": "Robert Damron", "response": ["| Greg Owen", "| Greg Owen"]}, {"page": "2006 Open Championship", "response": [":America: Aaron Baddeley, Steve Elkington, J.
