During the 1980s, he was one half of comic double act 'The Oblivion Boys', alongside Stephen Frost.\nArden was born in Newbury, Berkshire. He and Frost came to prominence in the late 1970s alternative comedy boom, and became recognisable to a national audience with regular spots on Saturday Live. In the early 1980s, they were instrumental in the forming of the long-running north London comedy show News Revue, and shortly afterwards began appearing as a pair in episodes of series such as The Black Adder and The Young Ones; they are perhaps most remembered for a series of commercials for Carling Black Label lager, one of which involved Arden and Frost appearing in the nude. Arden continued to perform with Frost in comedy clubs, although he did not follow his partner into the genre of improvisation. Nevertheless, he featured as the chauffeur Johnny Blackpool (a paranoid ex-soldier) in the partially-improv 1994 comedy film There's No Business..., opposite Raw Sex (Simon Brint and Rowland Rivron).\nArden had a major role as Roland 'Vaseline' Cartwright in London's Burning, appearing in the original pilot film and the first two series; he has also had roles in such comedies as Blackadder II and Bottom. He and Frost also played the title roles in the surrealist police sitcom Lazarus and Dingwall. Later, Arden appeared in the 1992 film Carry On Columbus and in the 1990s series Harry Enfield and Chums. In October 1996 he played Jansson in an episode of the 6th series of Heartbeat (Snapped).\nArden also has had a theatre career, appearing in Willis Hall's acclaimed play The Long, the Short and the Tall in the West End. He also played the title role in An Inspector Calls at the Garrick Theatre, Pop in the musical We Will Rock You at London's Dominion Theatre, and in Fings Ain't Wot They Used T'Be at the Theatre Royal Stratford East.\nArden's television career continued in 2002 with The Estate Agents.
