Webb coined the term in response to a comment on his design by Sir Nikolaus Pevsner in a 1961 lecture, in which he recalled hearing the words: \"within the schools there are some disturbing trends; I saw the other day a design for a building that looked like a series of stomachs sitting on a plate. Or bowels, connected by bits of gristle\".Samantha Hardingham and David Greene, The disreputable projects of David Greene, Architectural Association Publications 2007-10-01, , pdf  p. 44.
