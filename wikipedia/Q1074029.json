For the first season, Gough and Millar usually wrote the final draft of every episode because they were still seeking the show's voice. The pair understood that a writing staff would help \"expand [the] show\". As part of their expanding, they also brought in comic-book writer Jeph Loeb, who spent his first two weeks seeking fresh ideas for new episodes. One of the decisions the new writing team came up with was letting Pete in on Clark's secret. The decision to let Pete learn Clark's secret was a choice made so that the character would have a function on the show, and allow Clark someone who was not one of his parents.Simpson, Paul, pp.22\u201325 It was also a way to examine the \"power of friendship and loyalty\", and \"the price of having to keep a secret\".", "In addition, Jeph Loeb requested the introduction of Superman's future ally, Metropolis Police Lieutenant Maggie Sawyer, for the episode \"Insurgence\". As Loeb recalls, \"Ken [Biller] had written a hard-bitten, crusty kind of cop. I asked him if he minded if it was a woman, and explained who Maggie Sawyer was and the role she would play in the future.\" The concept for \"Insurgence\" also developed from an aspect of the Superman mythology that stemmed back to Superman's original incarnation, which was his ability to leap tall buildings in a single bound. After their Thanksgiving break, the \"Smallville\" writers were in the writers' room when Miles Millar walked in and exclaimed, \"I think it's time for Clark to leap a tall building.\" Jeph Loeb and the other writers had already been trying to develop a story that involved a hostage situation, and after Millar made his announcement the team suggested that they also pay homage to the Bruce Willis action film Die Hard. The setting for the hostage situation was LuthorCorp Plaza; the team introduced the \"Daily Planet\", another pivotal piece of Superman lore that would one day employ Clark Kent and his alternate identity of Superman, by using it as the building that Clark uses to execute his \"first leap\".Simpson, Paul, pp.58\u201361 \"Insurgence\" was actually written before \"Visage\" and \"Suspect\", but not filmed until after both of those episodes because the team was having difficulty figuring out the logistics of producing the episode.

They had Rosenbaum pull what they referred to as the \"Fight Club gag\", where he believes that he is fighting Louis, but in reality he has been fighting himself the entire time.Simpson, Paul, pp.14\u201317 This would culminate in the episode \"Shattered\", where, as Mark Verheiden explains, the episode was set up like something out of the film Gaslight, where the audience believes that Lex is being driven insane.", "The idea to use Superman's cape, which came from Miles Millar, to represent Clark's \"cosmic lifespan\" came after much discussion on what to actually use. Ideas were thrown around, including a shot of Lex dumping kryptonite on Clark, as he is lying down, killing him. Ultimately they went with Millar's idea, which they saw as this \"great iconic moment\", because the audience finally sees their first glimpse of Superman's costume. Superman's cape was not the only iconic imagery used during the third season. The episode \"Whisper\" not only introduced a new superpower for Clark, his super hearing, but allowed the writing staff the opportunity to provide a sort of \"in-joke\" to the audience. The team wrote in a gag where Clark wears a pair of eyeglasses, a staple of his disguise later in life while working at the Daily Planet. In the episode, an accident with Clark's heat vision causes him to go blind; as his eyes heal, he is forced to wear a pair of prescription eyeglasses until he fully regains his sight.Simpson, Paul, pp.50\u201353 \"Perry\" would introduce Clark's future boss, and editor of the Daily Planet, Perry White. This episode would also serve as the point where Clark finally learns that his powers are caused by the radiation from Earth's yellow Sun.Simpson, Paul, pp.30\u201333", "Season three saw the directing debut of one of the show's developers, Miles Millar, who got to direct the episode \"Memoria\". Welling describes Millar's style as very succinct, to which he credits to Millar's background of writing for all of the characters on the show. As Welling explains, Millar managed to capture the same effect as other directors, but with fewer words. Millar's visual style, at least for this episode, tended to lean more to applying \"extreme lighting\" to the scenes, to create silhouettes of the characters.Simpson, Paul, pp.100\u2013111 Miles Millar was inspired by the film Kings Row when he filmed the scene for Lex's birthday party as a child. In the scene, a camera pulls back from a flashback transition to reveal a young Lex sitting alone at a large table full of food and gifts. Instead of using the same techniques that were employed in previous episodes for transitioning between the present and the past, Millar decided to shift between the two time frames by transitioning between the older Lex and the younger Lex. This required Rosenbaum to rely more on Millar's direction, so that the emotional level was matched between himself and the young actor portraying Lex, Wayne Dalglish. One particular scene seemed to provide Millar with the most trouble, mainly because of the constraints of the film division at Warner Bros. In the scene, Jor-El and Lara are placing the infant Kal-El into his spaceship during Krypton's final moments. At the time, Warner Bros. was working on a new Superman film, and it was going to be an origin story. This affected how much Smallville could actually show. The film department prohibited Millar from showing Krypton, or Jor-El and Lara. As a result, Millar took inspiration from a comic book written by Jeph Loeb. In Loeb's book, Jor-El and Lara are depicted as just a pair of hands holding on to each other after they place Kal-El into his spaceship.", "The final moment in \"Crisis\", of Lionel preparing to kill himself, was also added at the last minute. John Glover and the crew filmed the scene during the filming of \"Memoria\", which occurred a week before \"Crisis\" was going to air. While filming, Greg Beeman, James Marshall and Miles Millar were all sitting behind the monitors, trying to come up with the cliffhanger ending that was going to be attached to \"Crisis\". Beeman added the moment where the phone rings, interrupting Lionel from completing his suicide; this was used as the opening for \"Legacy\" and it all eventually set up Lionel's terminal liver disease.Simpson, Paul, pp.74\u201377 Another late change, though it was not at the last minute, came for Lionel's physical appearance on the show. John Glover came up with the idea of cutting Lionel's hair for the season finale. Glover was busy preparing for a play that he was going to be acting in, and he needed his hair cut for the part. Glover made the suggestion while the crew was filming \"Memoria\", as well as the idea of setting the scene in prison. Gough admits to needing some kind of device to cut back to while all of the other cliffhangers are occurring\u2014Clark being taken away, the Kryptonian symbol burned into field on the Kent farm, and Lex being poisoned\u2014and he felt that Glover's suggestion would help them pull off the effect they wanted.Simpson, Paul, pp.96\u201399"]}, {"page": "Justin Hammer", "response": ["* Early stages of the 2008 Iron Man film produced by New Line Cinema under David Hayter, Alfred Gough, and Miles Millar had Hammer as an ancillary villain to Howard Stark as War Machine."]}, {"page": "Hover Car Racer", "response": ["Disney bought the rights to the film when the book was still only a manuscript, and had begun the screen-writing process with Alfred Gough and Miles Millar.Dunkley, Cathy (Jul. 21, 2004).
