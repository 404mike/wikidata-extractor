The original members were Reg King (lead vocals), Alan 'Bam' King (rhythm guitar, vocals), Mike \"Ace\" Evans (bass guitar, vocals) and Roger Powell (drums). They had a brief spell as a bar band in Germany, and then as a backing band for Sandra Barry, (sometimes referred to as Sandra Barry and the Boyfriends) playing on her single \"Really Gonna Shake\" in 1964. After the stint with Barry, Pete Watson was recruited as lead guitarist, and in 1964 they changed their name to The Action.", "The Action now set about gathering original new material for a projected LP, but recording demos in a radically different Byrds-influenced psychedelic style failed to secure them their hoped-for recording deal (the 1967/68 demos were eventually released in the 1990s under the title Rolled Gold). With the band seemingly having reached an impasse vocalist Reg King's behaviour became increasing unpredictable, and he departed the band in mid-1968. King's exit left Ian Whiteman and Alan King to share vocal duties, and at this point The Action decided on a brief change of name to Azoth. However the band soon reverted to their old name to record a new set of five demos, where they moved toward a more mid-tempo West Coast-influenced psychedelic ballad style and then into folk rock (these demos were eventually released in 1985 as The Action Speaks Louder Than Words). By January 1969 however, upon signing to Head Records (a fledgling independent label run by their former roadie John Curd), The Action was finally and permanently re-christened Mighty Baby.", "# Reg King Interview (BBC Radio's Saturday Club 1966)"]}, {"page": "Robbers on High Street", "response": ["Scratchie/New Line Records folded shortly after the New Year.

After purchasing a TASCAM MS-16 1\" 16 track, the band entered the studio in October 2009 to begin work on their third full-length album.
