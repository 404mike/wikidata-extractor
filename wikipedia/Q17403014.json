While she is recognised primarily for her work in fashion, she has also contributed illustrations to books, magazines and album covers. Her work has been widely exhibited, including at London's Hayward Gallery. She is a design academic at both Central Saint Martins and the Royal College of Art.\nWith recurring retro references \u2013 particularly to the 1970s and pop culture \u2013 her illustrations have been described as \"whimsical\" and \"Rock & Roll meets rainbow\". The Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) noted that: \"Her drawings, sculptures, assemblages, installations and video combine a rawness, at times reminiscent of punk, with a bewildering sensuality and a strong sense of colour and texture\".In a 2008 interview, she said: \"For the moment I am doing artist/designer... I would like to be regarded as an artist eventually\". In 2012, the Victoria & Albert Museum (V&A) acquired a large archive of her work (over 100 illustrations) for its permanent collection.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Kent Institute of Art & Design", "response": ["* Julie Verhoeven, illustrator/artist and fashion designer"]}, {"page": "List of fashion designers", "response": ["* Julie Verhoeven"]}, {"page": "Maximalism", "response": ["Charlotte Rivers describes how \"maximalism celebrates richness and excess in graphic design\", characterized by decoration, sensuality, luxury and fantasy, citing examples from the work of illustrator Kam Tang and artist Julie Verhoeven.Rivers, Charlotte (2008).
