She stood for the leadership of the SNP in 1990 but lost out to Alex Salmond despite the backing of many prominent SNP members (such as Jim Sillars). Ewing had become leader of the SNP's parliamentary group after the 1987 election. The leadership vacancy was caused by the fact that the SNP Chairman Gordon Wilson had lost his seat at Dundee Dundee East and previous group leader Donald Stewart had retired from parliament. While, the three SNP MPs elected in 1987 had not been members of the previous parliament, both Ewing and Andrew Welsh had served in parliament in the past. A post-election meeting held at Perth between Ewing, Welsh, Salmond (newly elected as MP for Banff and Buchan) and Wilson led to Ewing's appointment with Welsh becoming the group's chief whip."]}, {"page": "Stornoway", "response": ["*Donald Stewart, politician"]}, {"page": "Na h-Eileanan an Iar (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Donald Stewart"]}, {"page": "Operation Cauldron", "response": ["In 1979 Western Isles MP Donald Stewart, aware of rumours about the trial, questioned Defence Secretary Francis Pym about them in Parliament.
