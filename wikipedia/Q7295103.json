He always gives the best if he wants to impress his friends or the girl he likes. Fred has confidence in himself and is loyal to his friends Brianna and Friday. Sometimes, when panic strikes him, he becomes really nervous and can not make a decision. Fred always used to have a lot of bad luck, until one day, the ANIQUILAITOR 9-0-9-0-9-0-9, the robot with the most advanced technology of all came into his life. Fred nicknamed him Friday, maybe in reference to Friday the 13th, which although it is usually a bad day, gave Fred a lot of luck. His special characteristic is that he always carries two dice in his hand. One white and one black, which he uses to make decisions (\"Unfortunate Fred\"). His phrase is \"Sweet corn\" and is in love with Nora, a girl in his class. Obviously, Fred is not the most appropriate person to take care of a powerful robot like Friday. Unfortunately, Fred can not turn his back on him, and even if he could, he would not. And Fred loves his robot friend and carefully looks after him. He really enjoys being with him.
