On the death of Charles II, his brother James, a Roman Catholic, became James II. James wished to achieve toleration for those of his own Roman Catholic faith, whose practices were still banned. This, however, drew the Presbyterians closer to the Church of England in their common desire to resist 'popery'; talk of reconciliation and liturgical compromise was thus in the air. But with the flight of James in 1688 and the arrival of the Calvinist William of Orange the position of the parties changed. The Presbyterians could achieve toleration of their practices without such a right being given to Roman Catholics and without, therefore, their having to submit to the Church of England, even with a liturgy more acceptable to them. They were now in a much stronger position to demand changes that were ever more radical. John Tillotson, Dean of Canterbury pressed the king to set up a commission to produce such a revision. The so-called Liturgy of Comprehension of 1689, which was the result, conceded two thirds of the Presbyterian demands of 1661; but, when it came to convocation the members, now more fearful of William's perceived agenda, did not even discuss it and its contents were, for a long time, not even accessible. This work, however, did go on to influence the prayer books of many British colonies."]}, {"page": "Mary II of England", "response": ["Many of Mary's proclamations focus on combating licentiousness, insobriety and vice.Van der Kiste, p. 164; Waller, pp. 281, 286 She often participated in the affairs of the Church\u2014all matters of ecclesiastical patronage passed through her hands.Van der Kiste, pp. 163\u2013164 On the death of Archbishop of Canterbury John Tillotson in December 1694, Mary was keen to appoint Bishop of Worcester Edward Stillingfleet to the vacancy, but William over-ruled her and the post went to Bishop of Lincoln Thomas Tenison.Van der Kiste, p. 176"]}, {"page": "November 22", "response": ["*1694 \u2013 John Tillotson, English archbishop (b. 1630)"]}, {"page": "Transubstantiation", "response": ["Elizabeth I, as part of the Elizabethan Religious Settlement, gave royal assent to the 39 Articles of Religion, which sought to distinguish Anglican from Roman Church doctrine.

Indeed, for many years it was illegal in Britain to hold public office whilst believing in transubstantiation, as under the Test Act of 1673. Archbishop John Tillotson decried the \"real barbarousness of this Sacrament and Rite of our Religion\", considering it a great impiety to believe that people who attend Holy Communion \"verily eat and drink the natural flesh and blood of Christ. And what can any man do more unworthily towards a Friend? How can he possibly use him more barbarously, than to feast upon his living flesh and blood?\" (Discourse against Transubstantiation, London 1684, 35).

He is one of the preachers, along with John Tillotson and Louis Bourdaloue, who began the transition from Baroque to Neoclassical preaching.  He preached with a simple eloquence that eschewed the grandiose extravagances of earlier preaching.  He focused on ethical rather than doctrinal messages, often drawing from the lives of saints or saintly contemporaries as examples.  He preached, for example, on St. Francis de Sales as well as funeral orations on Queen Henrietta Maria of France and Henrietta Anne of England.  Bossuet's funeral orations in particular had lasting importance and were translated early into many languages, including English.  Such was their power that even Voltaire, normally so antagonistic toward clergy, praised his oratorical excellence. cited in ."]}, {"page": "Thomas the Rhymer", "response": ["John Tillotson's version (1863) with \"magic harp he had won in Elfland\" and Elizabeth W.
