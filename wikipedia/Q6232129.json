Although marginal at first, a religious underground was slowly growing from the 1730s which would eventually spout a second wave of Protestant Zionism and with it the birth of Evangelical Protestantism. This was precipitated in Germany by Philipp Spener's Pietism, a mystical and often millennialist take on Lutheranism, which prophesised the \"conversion of the Jews and the fall of the Papacy as the prelude of the triumph of the Church.\" One of Spener's followers, Nicolaus Zinzendorf, spread this into the Moravian Church, linking the theory to Palestine, changing the Moravian liturgy to include a prayer \"to restore the tribe of Judah in its time and bless its first fruits among us.\" John and Charles Wesley, early leaders in Methodism; inspired by the Pietists and Zinzendorf's Moravians; also promoted a Jewish return to Palestine with Charles Wesley even authoring a hymn dedicated to it. The Baptist, John Gill, who moved in similar circles to the Wesleys, authored works expressing similar views. By 1771, the Evangelical minister, John Eyre, founder of the Evangelical Magazine and among the original members of the London Missionary Society was promoting a more developed version of these views with his Observations upon Prophecies Relating to the Restoration of the Jews."]}, {"page": "Trefeca", "response": ["* John Eyre (evangelical minister), co-founder of the London Missionary Society"]}, {"page": "John Eyre", "response": ["John Eyre may refer to:", "*John Eyre (died 1581), Member of Parliament for Wiltshire and Salisbury", "*John Eyre (died 1639), MP for Cricklade", "*John Eyre (1659\u20131709), MP for Galway Borough, son of the above", "*John Eyre (died 1745), MP for Galway Borough, son of the above", "*John Eyre (1665\u20131715), MP for Downton", "*John Eyre, 1st Baron Eyre (c. 1720\u20131781), MP for Galway Borough, nephew of the above", "*John Eyre (Canadian politician) (1824\u20131882), Canadian attorney and politician", "*John Eyre (cricketer, born 1885) (1885\u20131964), Derbyshire cricketer", "*John Eyre (cricketer, born 1944), Derbyshire cricketer", "*John Eyre (footballer) (born 1974), English footballer", "*John Eyre (Archdeacon of Sheffield) (1845\u20131912), Anglican priest in the late 19th and early 20th centuries", "*John Eyre (evangelical minister) (1754\u20131803), English cleric", "*John Eyre (Archdeacon of Nottingham) (1758\u20131830)", "*John Eyre (settler) (died 1685), English settler in Ireland", "*John Eyre (British artist) (1847\u20131927), English genre painter, designed and painted pottery", "*John Eyre (painter) (1771\u20131812), Australian painter and engraver", "*Edward John Eyre (1815\u20131901), Australian explorer and Governor of Jamaica"]}, {"page": "John Eyre (clergyman)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Eyre (evangelical minister)"]}, {"page": "John Eyre (evangelical priest)", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Eyre (evangelical minister)"]}]}}
