In 1937, he moved to London to continue his studies at the Westminster School of Art. One year later, Reynolds got a post as a naval instruments engineer in Norwich and this endured throughout the war times and thereafter. This wartime experience as an engineer seems to have strengthened rather than repressed his artistic practice. In fact, craftsmanship has influenced his observations vis-a-vis nature and mankind. He constantly expanded the knowledge of materials and techniques in his sculpture studio. As he noted, \"I was one who was always interested in things, in specimens, and so that brought me round strongly on the side of sculpture ... the forms of solid nature rather than views of nature.\" Apropos of his Bird Skull Series, he explained \"...it's symbolic of primaeval life which runs through nearly all my themes ... an upthrust of growth and energy.\""]}, {"page": "List of alumni of the Byam Shaw School of Art", "response": ["* Blair Hughes-Stanton"]}, {"page": "Colchester Art Society", "response": ["The Permanent Collection includes a number of works produced by renowned East Anglian artists from the past half century, including: Roderic Barrett, Arthur Lett-Haines, Lucy Harwood (who also belonged to the East Anglian School of Painting and Drawing), Blair Hughes-Stanton, John Nash (who was the first president of the Colchester Art Society), Cedric Morris, Bernard Reynolds and Valerie Thornton.
