Midway through the first half, Simon Garner flicked on a cross from Scott Sellars and Howard Gayle scored to make it 1\u20130 to Blackburn. In the 27th minute, Gayle doubled his side's lead with a half-volley from just outside the Palace penalty area.  In the 70th minute, Jeff Hopkins brought Gayle down in the box and a penalty was awarded. Gayle took the spot kick himself but struck his shot wide of the goal.  With four minutes of regular time remaining, Palace made it 2\u20131 through Eddie McGoldrick.  Garner restored the two-goal lead in injury time, ending the match 3\u20131.  Selhurst Park hosted the second leg of the final on 3 June 1989.  Blackburn started the game strongly but Palace took the lead through Ian Wright who scored after 17 minutes from an Alan Pardew cross. A minute after half time, Mark Atkins tripped McGoldrick in the box to concede a penalty from which David Madden scored.  Palace were 2\u20130 ahead at the end of regular time, and with the aggregate score being 3\u20133, the game went into extra time.  With three minutes of the match remaining, Wright scored his 33rd goal of the season heading the ball from a McGoldrick cross past Terry Gennoe.  The match ended 3\u20130 and Palace were promoted to the First Division with a 4\u20133 aggregate victory.", "In the other play-off semi-final, Crystal Palace's opponents were Swindon Town, and the first leg was played at the County Ground, Swindon, on 21 May 1989.  The match was dominated by Swindon but the first half ended goalless.  In the 53rd minute, Crystal Palace's captain Jeff Hopkins scored an own goal after a dangerous cross from Dave Hockaday.  Swindon manager Lou Macari suggested that his side were favourites going into the second leg but added \"we shan't be defending\".  The return leg took place at Selhurst Park three days later.  The largest crowd of the season meant congestion caused the kick off to be delayed by fifteen minutes.  On eight minutes, Mark Bright scored his 25th goal of the season after Paul Digby had beaten away a shot from David Madden, to put Palace ahead.  Seven minutes before half-time, Ian Wright doubled the lead after scoring from a Bright header.  The match ended 2\u20130 and Crystal Palace qualified for the final with a 2\u20131 aggregate win.", "| David Madden ", "| David Madden"]}]}}
