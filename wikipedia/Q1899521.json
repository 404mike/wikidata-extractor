The character on the television show was an anesthesiologist from Australia, often depicted wearing an Australian Slouch hat. In the book, he was an American who had \"trained in the States with McIntyre\". In the film, he is an American (as he can be seen wearing the insignia of a US Army Captain), but his background is not discussed. In the TV series, Ugly John was present only in the first season. He began as a significant supporting member of the cast, often engaged in poker games with Hawkeye and Trapper, but by the end of the season he was rarely seen outside brief O.R. scenes.", "Ugly John was never seen living in \"The Swamp\" and there was no fifth bunk, though it was the only quarters for subordinate male officers ever seen. In the episode \"Sometimes You Hear the Bullet\", Hawkeye says that he shares a tent with three other doctors. The script was likely written before Spearchucker was dropped and the writers presumably overlooked editing that line of dialogue. However, Ugly John was still a recurring character, and may have been one of the \"three other doctors\". John Orchard later returned to the show for the Season 8 episode \"Captains Outrageous\", this time playing a drunken and corrupt Australian Military Policeman \"Sgt.
