He played in eight Tests than spanned either side of World War II.Cricket writer, Colin Bateman, noted, \"a great servant of Sussex, Jim Langridge played only one Test after the War in a sporadic England career. As a steady left-handed batsman and patient left-arm spinner, his Test opportunities were greatly limited by the presence of Yorkshire's Hedley Verity\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1931 in sports", "response": ["* Wisden Cricketers of the Year \u2013 Bill Bowes, Stewie Dempster, James Langridge, Iftikhar Ali Khan Pataudi, Hedley Verity "]}, {"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  James Langridge"]}, {"page": "Sussex County Cricket Club", "response": ["* James Langridge", "|James Langridge || 28,894", "|James Langridge || 1,416"]}, {"page": "Hugh Bartlett", "response": ["On 27 August, the Australians came to Hove and Bartlett hit 157 in two hours.

The previous Somerset record had been 292, set by the late Victorian era amateur Lionel Palairet. Gimblett told his biographer David Foot, on the tapes that form the backbone of the biography, that he had said on the pitch at Eastbourne to Sussex player James Langridge: \"Well, that's got rid of one amateur's name in our county's record books.\"Foot, p. 102. Gimblett went on to say that a collection had been proposed to mark the feat, but that Somerset's secretary had been dismissive of the idea. \"I think that was when I first decided that my career with Somerset was going to end.

The balding and bespectacled Paul Gibb had a sensational tour of South Africa before in 1938\u201339, when he hit 473 runs (59.12) and two centuries, but in Australia was found to have a weakness against leg-spin and failed. He was chosen for the First Test ahead of Godfrey Evans because of his batting ability, but Evans proved to be a decent batsman, a perky, attacking player who tried to take a run off every ball, but in the Fourth Test he went for a record 95 minutes before scoring while Compton made a century at the other end.p174, R.L Arrowsmith, EVANS, Thomas Godfrey, E.W. Swanton (ed), Barclays World of Cricket, Collins Willow, 1986 At 28 Jack Ikin was one of the younger English players on the tour and apart from five first class matches in 1938 and 1939 he was a post-war player. Not noted for his footwork or strokeplay he was a gritty left-hander who was picked even though he only made one century for Lancashire in 1946. He was popular in Australia as he was a Tobruk Rat who had fought alongside the Australian 9th Division in North Africa.p105, Cary Norman Yardley was a sensible player who liked to play his strokes on the leg-side and though he never made a Test century was a good man in a crisis.p252, R.L Arrowsmith, YARDLEY, Norman Walter Dransfield, E.W. Swanton (ed), Barclays World of Cricket, Collins Willow, 1986 James Langridge, Peter Smith and Bill Voce were bowlers who regularly made runs and even centuries for their counties, but Doug Wright's only hundred had become before the war and afterwards was relegated to the bottom of the batting order. Alec Bedser was a tailender who was capable of hitting a few runs on occasion and Dick Pollard's lack of batting ability was cited as one of the reasons why he was not picked for a Test in the series.", "Doug Wright was seen as England's trump card when he arrived in Australia, but he was either the unluckiest or the most over-rated spinner to tour Australia. Don Bradman said he was the best leg-spinner to tour Australia since Sydney Barnes 35 years before,p68 Swanton and Keith Miller thought he was the best leg-spinner he knew after Bill O'Reilly.p156, Miller After Tich Freeman retired Wright became Kent's main spinner, taking 2,056 wickets (23.98) and a record seven first class hat-tricks. His long rollicking run up and brisk pace gave away many no-balls and too often he served up full tosses and long hops, but he turned the ball fiercely and his googly had even the best batsmen groping. His ability to run through a side made him the terror of the County circuit, but he rarely achieved this in Tests. In the Fifth Test at Sydney his 7/105 dismissed Australia for 253 and in 1947 his 10/175 in the Second Test gave England a 10 wicket victory over South Africa. His great asset was that he always looked as if he was about to take a wicket, but in Australia in 1946\u201347 and again in 1950\u201351 he proved too expensive and like Bedser was overbowled. Their second leg-spinner was Peter Smith, who was preferred to Eric Hollies because of his batting, but he injured a finger on the journey to Australia and had an appendix removed once there. Even so, he was effective in tour matches - his 9/121 against NSW is the best bowling return by an Englishman in Australia - but was understandably below par in his only Test. James Langridge was a veteran Slow Left Arm bowler who started his trade in 1924, and had taken 92 wickets (22.11) in 1946, but he was 41 years old on his first tour of Australia and just when he appeared to be finding his form he strained a muscle and could not play.pp7-8, Cary Jack Ikin was a part-time leg-spinner whose bowling was thought to be of all round status early in his career (helped by the very poor wickets at Old Trafford), but Hammond used him rarely and he proved to be expensive in the Tests.pp426-427, K.M. Kilburn and Brian Bearslaw, Lancashire, E.W. Swanton (ed), Barclays World of Cricket, Collins Willow, 1986", "This was one of the last teams to use old fashioned practice of putting the old men in the in-field and the young men in the out-field. As a result, Bill Voce was put in the slips and James Langridge in the gully, so many catches went begging. Meanwhile, the bowlers Doug Wright and Alec Bedser tired themselves chasing the ball around the ground when they should have been resting.p8, Alec Bedser, May's Men in Australia, Stanley Paul, 1959 Bill Edrich and Len Hutton were specialist slip fielders, Denis Compton was a good fielder anywhere and Jack Ikin took 31 catches in his 18 Tests and \"as a fielder he had no superior in the slips or at short leg\". Cyril Washbrook was an excellent cover fieldsman who flaunted his ability to throw down the stumps like a bullet and \"if the runs he saved could have been added to those he made he would have boasted an aggregate to make Bradman envious\".p107, Cary Australian batsmen soon learnt not to run if the ball went anywhere near him."]}, {"page": "1931 English cricket season", "response": ["*Wisden \u2013 Bill Bowes, Charles Dempster, James Langridge, Nawab of Pataudi, senior, Hedley Verity"]}, {"page": "1947 English cricket season", "response": ["England, playing under the auspices of MCC, took 17 players to Australia and New Zealand.

Only Jim Cornford performed consistently well among the bowlers while six batsmen scored over 1,000 runs. Three of these exceeded 2,000 in all matches: John Langridge, George Cox and Harry Parks. James Langridge reached the thousand despite missing several matches due to appendicitis. Charles Oakes and new captain Hugh Bartlett were the other two.

Martindale and Constantine used the bodyline \"leg-theory\" style of bowling fast and short to a packed leg-side field, and England lost four wickets for 134, including Hammond, who returned to bat after having his chin split open by a short-pitched ball. Douglas Jardine led the resistance, putting on 83 with Ames and 140 with Robins. Jardine's 127 was his first Test match century. Martindale took five wickets for 73 runs. When West Indies batted a second time, England fast bowler Edward Clark also bowled leg-theory, but with little success.
