In 1942, when Loja Saarinen retired, Strengell replaced her as head of the Department of Weaving and Textile Design. Soon after, a powerloom was installed in the weaving studios. She developed a curriculum that emphasized weave structure, versus the more pictorial imagery used by Saarinen. In her 25 years at Cranbrook, she trained many textile artists, including Jack Lenor Larsen, Robert Sailors and Ed Rossbach. Her circle of friends and colleagues included Harry Bertoia, Ben Baldwin, Ray and Charles Eames, Florence Knoll, and Eszter Haraszty. She maintained her role as Department Head of Weaving and Textile Design until she retired from Cranbrook in 1961.\"Marianne Strengell Papers\". Cranbrook Archives. Bloomfield Hills, Michigan.
