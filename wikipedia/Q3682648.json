Though he was less prolific a songwriter than his bandmate Andy Partridge, Moulding wrote their first three charting UK singles: \"Life Begins at the Hop\" (1979), \"Making Plans for Nigel\" (1979) and \"Generals and Majors\" (1980).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 17", "response": ["*1955 \u2013 Colin Moulding, English singer-songwriter and bassist "]}, {"page": "XTC", "response": ["XTC were an English rock band formed in Swindon in 1972. Fronted by songwriters Andy Partridge (guitars, vocals) and Colin Moulding (bass, vocals), the band gained popularity during the rise of punk and new wave in the 1970s, later playing in a variety of styles that ranged from angular guitar riffs to elaborately arranged pop. Partly because the group did not fit into contemporary trends, they achieved only sporadic commercial success in the UK and US, but attracted a considerable cult following there and in Japan. They have since been recognised for their influence on post-punk, Britpop and later power pop acts.", "Andy Partridge and Colin Moulding grew up on Penhill council estate in Swindon. Partridge jokingly characterised the community as being populated almost entirely by people with physical, mental or emotional defects. In the 1960s, he was a fan of contemporary pop groups like the Beatles, but was intimidated by the process of learning guitar. When the Monkees grew popular, he became interested in joining a music group. He recalled watching local guitarist Dave Gregory performing Jimi Hendrix-style songs at churches and youth clubs: \"Sort of acid-skiffle. I thought, 'Ah, one day I'll play guitar!' But I didn't think I would be in the same band as this kid on the stage.\" Partridge eventually obtained a guitar and taught himself how to play it with no formal training. At the age of 15, he wrote his first song, titled \"Please Help Me\", and attracted the nickname \"Rocky\" for his early guitar mastery of the Beatles' \"Rocky Raccoon\" (1968). By the early 1970s, his music tastes had transitioned \"from the Monkees to having a big binge on this Euro-avant-garde stuff. I got really in deep.\" One of his first bands was called \"Stiff Beach\", formed in August 1970. In early 1972, Partridge's constantly evolving group settled into \"Star Park\", a four-piece that featured himself with guitarist Dave Cartner, drummer Paul Wilson, and a bassist nicknamed \"Nervous Steve\".", "In 1972, Partridge became closer acquainted with Gregory, a diabetic then suffering from a bout of depression, while working as an assistant at the Bon Marche record shop in Swindon. Gregory was playing the Mahavishnu Orchestra's album The Inner Mounting Flame (1971), which he later called \"one of the watershed moments in my musical education.\" Partridge met Colin Moulding at the Stage Bar on Swindon's Old Town's Union Row, later known as Long's. Moulding had been playing bass since 1970 \"because I liked music [and] I thought that playing a bass, with four strings, would be infinitely easier than playing a guitar, with six strings. That was a horrible misconception!\". At the end of 1972, Moulding and drummer Terry Chambers joined Partridge's band, replacing Nervous Steve and Paul Wilson, and the group was renamed \"Star Park (Mark II)\". Other members would frequently join and leave the group.", "In July 2008, Partridge wrote in the Swindon Advertiser that he believed his \"musical partnership with Colin Moulding has come to an end. For reasons too personal and varied to go into here, but we had a good run as they say and produced some real good work. No, I won't be working with him in the future.\" In December, Moulding resurfaced for a live radio interview where he confirmed his recent disillusionment with music, but revealed that he was thinking of working on solo material. His given reasons for the break-up were financial discord, disagreement over the extent of the Fuzzy Warbles project, and a \"change in mindset\" between him and Partridge. He also stated that he and Partridge were once again communicating directly by email.", "XTC's principal songwriters were guitarist Andy Partridge and bassist Colin Moulding. Partridge, who wrote the majority of XTC's songs, was the group's frontman and de facto leader. He drove the band's image, designed many of their record sleeves, and handled most of their interviews. His involvement with XTC's record sleeves stemmed from his disappointment with the sleeve for the \"Statue of Liberty\" single, which depicted a poorly cropped photo of the statue and the XTC logo in red. He was less successful in his attempts to involve himself in the band's music videos, as he said, the woman in charge of Virgin's video department rebuked all his ideas, some of which other groups later adopted in award-winning videos.", "* Colin Moulding \u2013 vocals, bass guitar (1972\u20132006)", "  bar:Colin      text:Colin Moulding", "* Great Aspirations (2017, Colin Moulding and Terry Chambers reunion EP)"]}, {"page": "1955 in music", "response": ["**Colin Moulding, English bass guitarist, songwriter and vocalist (XTC)"]}, {"page": "Barry Andrews (musician)", "response": ["Andrews joined the group formed by Andy Partridge and Colin Moulding about the same time they changed their name to XTC in 1976.

He and Colin Moulding each acted as a songwriter and frontman for XTC, with Partridge writing and singing about two-thirds of the group's material.  While the band were a formative punk group, Partridge's music drew heavily from 1960s songwriters, and his style gradually shifted to more traditional pop, often with pastoral themes. The band's only UK top 10 hit, \"Senses Working Overtime\" (1982), was written by Partridge.", "In late 1972, Partridge's Star Park was joined by bassist Colin Moulding and drummer Terry Chambers. The band became known as XTC in 1975 and signed to Virgin Records in 1977. Partridge wrote the majority of XTC's songs, was the band's frontman and de facto leader, and in Moulding's view, typically acted as an \"executive producer\" for their albums. His early XTC songs were marked by his distinct singing style, something he jokingly described as a \"walrus\" or \"seal bark\", but otherwise an amalgamation of Buddy Holly's \"hiccup\", Elvis Presley's vibrato, and \"the howled mannerisms of Steve Harley.\" He later dismissed most of his initial output as premature songs \"built around this electric wordplay stuff\". ", "In the 1990s, Partridge became regarded as \"godfather\" to the nascent Britpop movement due to his earlier work with XTC. They released several more albums on Virgin and two more on their own label, Idea Records, before going on hiatus in 2006.

The work projected brighter, more upbeat and aggressive moods than Skylarking, and the harsher effect returned the group closer to the sound of their earlier records. Lyrically, most of the songs focus on parent-child relationships and the state of world affairs. Partridge's ornate vision for the psychedelic opening track \"Garden of Earthly Delights\" exemplified the album's general aesthetic, which he described as songs that could be singles in a \"bizarre perfect universe\".", "In early 1988, XTC began rehearsing material for their next LP. At the suggestion of A&R executive Jeremy Lascelles, young American producer Paul Fox was recruited based on the strength of a Boy George remix that the label commissioned of him. Partridge disliked the original track but enjoyed Fox's remix: \"It was really shiny, powerful and impressive.\" Fox subsequently flew to England and met Partridge at his home: \"He was obviously a huge fan of the band and was willing to translate what we wanted onto tape.\" He offered them a cheap studio rate in Los Angeles, which the band accepted. Another reason for recording in the US with an American producer, guitarist Dave Gregory said, was that the US had become \"our biggest market\". XTC, accompanied by the Moulding and Partridge families, arrived in Los Angeles on 12 May and stayed at the Oakwood Apartments in north Hollywood. The families returned home after two months; Partridge and bassist Colin Moulding then shared an apartment for the remainder of their stay.", "Commenting on the influence of the Beatles, Partridge said, \"There is some Beatles in our music, but also some Captain Beefheart, some jazz bands, some others who were not necessarily musicians, like Mir\u00f3, Walt Disney ...  If people see only some Beatles, it is because they want to search only for some Fab Four.\" He acknowledged that it was their first work in which they were conscious that they had a record-buying audience, particularly in the US. External stresses affecting the group included their ongoing litigation against former manager Ian Reid. Colin Moulding remembered, \"it was about to come to a head, and that was the worrying thing ...

It was met with positive reviews and a number 34 chart peak.

In his recollection, \"Up until that point, we were viewed as a poor man\u2019s Talking Heads or something ... when we came out with Drums and Wires it was like a different band, really.\" Lead single \"Making Plans for Nigel\" went further to propel the band's popularity, with every date of their proceeding UK tour sold-out.

Moulding explained: \"The problem for us is that we had seen Andy in the early days and witnessed how great he was with an audience. For us then, this came out of the blue.\" Partridge did not approach drummer Terry Chambers due to an expected hostile reaction. Further to the band's demoralisation was their poor financial situation, as they never received any of the revenue generated by the increasing number of sold-out shows they performed.

Blogger Roger Friedman of Details noted lyrical content ranging from book burning, the Gulf War and P.T.

It has also been cited as the band's most political album. Unlike previous XTC albums, Partridge composed many of his songs on Nonsuch using the keyboard, an instrument Partridge referred to as \"this grinning shark; stroke its teeth and any minute it'll swallow you up.\" He said he was so unfamiliar with the keyboard that he played it \"by drumming on it, two fingers here, two fingers there.\"", "New 2.0 stereo and 5.1 surround sound mixes from the original Nonsuch multitracks by Steven Wilson were released by Partridge's label Ape Records on 4 November 2013.
