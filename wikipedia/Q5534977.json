He was Yorkshire's captain from 1922 to 1924.\nBorn in Potternewton, Leeds, Yorkshire, Wilson was educated at Harrow. During World War I he served in the Royal Marines. After the war he went up to Trinity College, Cambridge. As a batsman he scored 1,801 runs at an average of 16.22, with a best of 142 not out for the MCC against Victoria, his only century.  He took forty four catches in the field.  He took one wicket for 55 runs, bowling his right arm medium pace.\nWilson died in November 1960 in Southsea, Hampshire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Herbert Sutcliffe", "response": ["In 1922, as Yorkshire regained the County Championship title under new captain Geoffrey Wilson, Sutcliffe lived up to his early promise by scoring 2,020 runs at 46.97 with a highest score of 232 against Surrey at the Oval.

He made his Test debut on Saturday, 14 June 1924, playing for England against South Africa at Edgbaston and opening the innings with Jack Hobbs. In this First Test, which England won by an innings, they recorded their first century partnership for England by putting on 136 before Sutcliffe was out for 64.  In the Second Test at Lord's, Hobbs and Sutcliffe scored 268 before Sutcliffe was out for 122, his maiden Test century; Hobbs went on to make 211 and England again won by an innings.

Waddington maintained his innocence but the MCC supported the umpires, finding him guilty of dissent, and the Yorkshire president Lord Hawke persuaded him to write a letter of apology to the MCC secretary. After the game, Middlesex threatened to cancel their future matches against Yorkshire; rumours circulated that the Yorkshire captain Geoffrey Wilson had offered to resign and that Waddington would be dropped. Later in 1924, Yorkshire had another controversial match, this time against Surrey, where there were disputes on the field, but no official complaint was made. The editor of Wisden suggested that a handful of players were the root cause of Yorkshire's problem; Geoffrey Wilson resigned at the end of the season,Woodhouse, p. 332. and these events probably cost Macaulay a place in the England Test team. The Yorkshire cricketer and journalist Bill Bowes later recalled a story in circulation that Waddington had deliberately tripped and injured the Middlesex player J. W. Hearne around this period, although he did not specify if it was during the 1924 Sheffield match.Marshall, p. 16. Waddington ended the season with 69 wickets at an average of 21.55, but appeared less effective than before his injury.Woodhouse, p. 333"]}, {"page": "List of people from Leeds", "response": ["*Geoffrey Wilson - cricketer who captained Yorkshire"]}, {"page": "List of people with surname Wilson", "response": ["* Geoff and Geoffrey Wilson (disambiguation), multiple people", "*** Geoffrey Wilson (cricketer) (1895\u20131960), English cricketer", "*** Geoffrey Wilson (British politician) (1903\u20131975), British Conservative politician"]}, {"page": "Geoff Wilson", "response": ["* Geoffrey Wilson (cricketer) (1895\u20131960), English cricketer", "* Geoffrey Wilson (British politician) (1903\u20131975), British Conservative politician"]}, {"page": "Yorkshire captaincy affair of 1927", "response": ["By the end of the 1927 English cricket season, Yorkshire had had a succession of short-term captains. Generally, these men were neither sufficiently good players nor leaders to merit a position in the team, but Yorkshire's side was strong enough to include them in the interest of maintaining amateur leadership. Tactically, Yorkshire's success came not from the captain but from the influence of leading professionals Wilfred Rhodes and Emmott Robinson.Rogerson, p. 150.Hill, p. 104. The captain's primary role was the enforcement of discipline: maintaining an amicable attitude within the team during games and ensuring that umpires and opponents were respected. In the early 1920s, Yorkshire had been undisciplined on the field; cricket correspondent Jim Kilburn wrote that they were in danger of becoming \"social outcasts\", and E. W. Swanton commented that Yorkshire's hostile attitude when fielding looked likely to jeopardise their relations with other teams. Matters came to a head in a match against Middlesex in 1924 at Sheffield. The crowd became very antagonistic and a Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) enquiry found that a Yorkshire player had incited the unrest. Further incidents against Surrey that season led the captain Geoffrey Wilson to resign, though he led the team to the County Championship in each of his three years in charge. His resignation was possibly prompted by the Yorkshire president, Lord Hawke, but Wilson did not like the belligerent nature of the team and found it difficult to handle Rhodes.Hill, pp. 106\u20137."]}, {"page": "Marylebone Cricket Club cricket team in New Zealand in 1922\u201323", "response": ["*Geoffrey Wilson"]}, {"page": "Herbert Sutcliffe's cricket career (1919\u20131927)", "response": ["In 1922, as Yorkshire regained the championship title under new captain Geoffrey Wilson, Sutcliffe lived up to his early promise by scoring 2,020 runs at 46.97 with a highest score of 232 against Surrey at The Oval.
