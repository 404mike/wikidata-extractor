Christmas was born to a British family in London. He was the son of film and television actor Eric Christmas. He emigrated to Toronto, Ontario, Canada with his family, and was there at the age of 2 years that hemophilia was diagnosed at the Hospital for Sick Children. The family returned to London in 1952 to visit their relatives, and during the trip Stephen was admitted to hospital. A sample of his blood was sent to the Oxford Haemophilia Centre in Oxford, where Rosemary Biggs and Robert Gwyn Macfarlane discovered that he was not deficient in Factor VIII, which is normally decreased in classic hemophilia, but a different protein, which received the name Christmas factor in his honour (and later Factor IX). Stephen was dependent on blood and plasma transfusions, and was infected with HIV in the period during which blood was not routinely screened for this virus. He became an active worker for the Canadian Hemophilia Society and campaigned for transfusion safety ever since getting infected, but developed AIDS and died from it in 1993."]}, {"page": "Coagulation", "response": ["Factor IX was discovered in 1952 in a young patient with hemophilia B named Stephen Christmas (1947\u20131993).

She then researched the formation and breakdown of blood clots (coagulation and fibrinolysis), and earned an MD and a gold medal from the University of London with her thesis on the clotting enzyme prothrombin in 1949. In 1952, she designed a new test, the thromboplastin generation test, for detecting defects in the blood of people with haemophilia. The same year, Biggs and Macfarlane's group discovered a previously unknown clotting enzyme, factor IX, which they originally named Christmas factor. They also coined the term Christmas disease (now known as haemophilia B) for patients with factor IX deficiencies, as distinguished from classical haemophilia (now known as haemophilia A), wherein there is a deficiency in factor VIII. The new factor and disease were named after Stephen Christmas, the first patient discovered by the group at Oxford to be deficient in factor IX."]}]}}
