The first killing happened when she was 10 years old. In both instances, Bell informed her victim he had a sore throat, which she would massage before proceeding to strangle him.Bell was convicted of both murders in December 1968 in a trial held at Newcastle Assizes when she was 11 years old and in which her actions were judged to have been committed under diminished responsibility. Her accomplice in at least one of the murders, 13-year-old Norma Joyce Bell (no relation), was acquitted of all charges.Bell was released from custody in 1980, aged 23. A lifelong court order granted her anonymity, which has since been extended to protect the identity of her daughter and granddaughter. She has since lived under a series of pseudonyms.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1968", "response": ["* December 17 \u2013 In England, Mary Bell, aged 11, is found guilty of murdering two small boys and sentenced to life in detention, but is released from prison in 1980 and granted anonymity."]}, {"page": "Child murder", "response": ["In most countries, there are very few cases where children are killed by other young children. According to the U.S. Department of Justice statistics for 1996, one in five murders of children were committed by other children. Several murders by children have gained prominent media exposure. One was the killing on 12 February 1993 of the almost 2-year-old boy James Bulger by two 10-year-old boys in Bootle, Merseyside, UK. He was beaten and stoned before his unconscious body was left on train tracks to give the impression that a train had hit him. Bulger's killers became the youngest convicted murderers in the modern history of the United Kingdom. Another notable case in the UK occurred in 1968 in Newcastle upon Tyne, when 10-year-old Mary Bell was convicted of manslaughter due to diminished responsibility in the deaths of toddlers Martin Brown and Brian Howe. She was released in 1980 at the age of 23. In 1998, 8-year-old Madelyn Clifton was killed by 14-year-old Josh Phillips."]}, {"page": "Gordon Giltrap", "response": ["In 1995 Giltrap released the album Music for the Small Screen.
