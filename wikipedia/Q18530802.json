For example, the Old English  ('wife') was neuter and referred to with the pronoun  ('it'), and w\u012bfmann ('woman') was masculine and referred to with the pronoun  ('he'). English lost grammatical gender during the late Middle Ages, and the pronouns he and she came to refer to animate subjects of male (or indeterminate) and female biological gender, and it came to refer to inanimate subjects. The American philologist George Perkins Marsh posited that this animate\u2013inanimate distinction led to an eventual discomfort with using whose to refer to both. In contrast, Richard Hogg speculates that causality is the other way around."]}, {"page": "The Cambridge History of the English Language", "response": ["The Cambridge History of the English Language is a six volume history of English published between 1992 and 2001.
