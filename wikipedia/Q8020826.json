He was then ordained and became the Vicar of Glynde from 1844 until his death in 1877. He was the author of several sermons and archaeological papers.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Long Man of Wilmington", "response": ["Whatever the figure's origin, for much of its history it seems to have existed only as a shadow or indentation in the grass, visible after a light fall of snow or as a different shade of green in summer: it is described or illustrated as such in 1710, 1781, 1800, 1835 and 1851. Indeed, the figure was once known locally as the \"Green Man\". Earlier depictions, such as those of Rowley and Burrell, show other details such as a possible scythe blade on the right-hand staff and the suggestion of a helmet or hat on the figure's head: they also indicate a different, albeit indistinct, position for the feet. The current outline of the Long Man is largely the result of a 'restoration' of 1873-4, when a group led by the vicar of Glynde, Reverend William de St Croix, marked out the outline with yellow bricks whitewashed and cemented together, though it has been claimed that the restoration process distorted the position of the feet."]}, {"page": "List of English cricketers (1826\u20131840)", "response": ["|William de St Croix"]}, {"page": "List of English cricketers (1841\u20131850)", "response": ["|William de St Croix"]}, {"page": "List of Cambridge Town Club and Cambridgeshire cricketers", "response": ["* William de St Croix (1840) : W. de St Croix"]}, {"page": "Thomas Spinks", "response": ["The son of William Spinks, he was born at Westminster in September 1819.
