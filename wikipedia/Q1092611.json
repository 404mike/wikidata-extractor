Hughes agreed a two-year contract with the London side and was officially unveiled to the media on 3 August 2010, before his first match as manager on 7 August against Werder Bremen. Hughes was joined at Fulham by his backroom team of Eddie Niedzwiecki, Mark Bowen and Kevin Hitchcock. His first league match in charge of the Cottagers came exactly a week later, when they drew 0\u20130 at Bolton Wanderers on the opening day of the Premier League season, followed by a resolute display against Manchester United in a 2\u20132 draw at Craven Cottage.", "On 14 March 2018, Hughes succeeded Mauricio Pellegrino as manager of relegation-threatened Premier League club Southampton, signing a short-term contract for the remainder of the 2017\u201318 season.

For the next couple of years, he was used irregularly. Coach Mark Bowen cited a lack of confidence, and a long-standing problem with concentration, as leading to inconsistency of performance; though the player's own determination to combat the problem led him to encourage the coaching staff to keep shouting at him during the game to maintain his concentration levels. In addition, he underwent laser eye surgery to deal with the problems caused by wearing contact lenses for football. He sometimes struggled badly against quick, tricky players, but always gave of his best when given an opportunity."]}, {"page": "Anthony Barness", "response": ["Barness left Chelsea in August 1996, and returned to Charlton Athletic for a fee of \u00a3165,000. He was an important and regular part of the Charlton team, managed by Alan Curbishley. In his first season back at The Valley, he was a virtual ever present and a top performer in a Charlton side struggling after the sale of Lee Bowyer. Barness suddenly left the first team in 1997 being replaced by Mark Bowen at left back and occasionally Paul Konchesky, and only made a handful of appearances from then on many at right back. Although Mark Bowen was an excellent performer for Charlton in the 97/98 season, many Charlton fans were perplexed by Anthony's replacement as he'd been a very reliable player. Alan Curbishley was quoted at the time of dropping him, that he'd been virtually ever present the previous season and appeared close to burn out. Though the fans saw a minimal drop off in form, it retains a mystery why he fell out of favour with Alan Curbishley."]}]}}
