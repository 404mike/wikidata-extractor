Despite nearly 16 years together the marriage only produced one child, Rosalie Caroline Chichester, and with Sir Bruce's sudden death in 1881, at the age of only 38, his young family were left with hefty debts which were only, finally paid off some 45 years later.  His widow continued to reside at Arlington, with their 16 year old daughter, Rosalie, until her death in 1908.

The Arlington Estate lay in the centre of the territory hunted by Sir Ian Amory's Staghounds (or The Barnstaple Staghounds) and other packs, and stags at the end of hunts frequently stood at bay in the ornamental lake in front of Arlington House. After an occasion in 1897 when such an event had occurred and the stag had been dispatched in the lake, 31-year-old Miss Chichester's coachman delivered a sealed letter to Mr R. Sanders, Master of the Devon and Somerset Staghounds, at a meet of the Staghounds. The letter stated that \"the Loxhore covers on the Arlington Estate were not to be hunted\".Lethbridge, p.168 Not only was that day's hunting ruined, but this action caused much consternation in the high society of North Devon, who were then overwhelmingly supporters of hunting, and caused great interruption to several local hunts. Although her wishes were complied with as far as possible, there were several incidents of hounds entering the forbidden areas. The hunts paid to erect fencing to discourage hunted deer from entering the Arlington Estate, but without total success. "]}]}}
