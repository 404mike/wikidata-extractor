Lee was born in Sileby, Leicestershire and died in Rugby, Warwickshire, and also played first-class cricket for Leicestershire.Lee began his professional career with Leicester City, moving to Derby County in 1950. He won his only England cap that same year when he played and scored in their 4\u20131 win over Northern Ireland at Windsor Park. He finished his career in 1955 at Coventry City.At cricket, Lee was a right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium-pace bowler. He made a single first-class appearance for Leicestershire, in 1947, against Glamorgan.

Revie scored the opening goal of the semi-final victory over First Division champions Portsmouth, having been told pre-match that opposition goalkeeper Ernest Butler tended to palm the ball over the attacker's head before reclaiming possession Revie positioned himself to take advantage of the situation when teammate Jack Lee challenged Butler for the ball, leaving Revie with a simple conversion.

He was an all-rounder, scoring six centuries and taking ten wickets in a match on two occasions by the end of his career.  He was killed on active service with the British Army during the Second World War.", "Lee was a Londoner and played one match in 1923 for Middlesex, where his brother, Harry, 12 years his senior, was an opening batsman and off-break bowler from 1911 to 1934. The Middlesex match was against Somerset at Taunton, and Lee failed to take a wicket with his leg-breaks and, batting at number ten, was run out without scoring. Unable to win a place in the Middlesex side, he moved to Somerset from the 1925 season, starting his career with his new county in almost identical circumstances, with just one wicket for his bowling and two scoreless innings in the match against Cambridge University at Bath. That was his only first-class match in his first two seasons at Somerset: without a residential or birth qualification, he was forced to wait for two years before he could appear in County Championship matches. While waiting, he played club cricket for the Lansdown Cricket Club in Bath.Foot (1986), p13. Two years after Jack Lee moved from Middlesex to Somerset, his younger brother Frank, who had made two appearances for Middlesex, made the same move: he also played for Lansdown and his qualification for Somerset proceeded two years behind Jack's.", "Jack Lee was qualified for Somerset in 1927 and immediately became a regular player in the side. In his first County Championship match, he was used as an opening batsman, and he stayed at or near the top of the batting order for most of the season, moving down only when one of Somerset's amateur irregulars arrived to claim one of the opening slots. In his first season, he made 759 runs at an average of 17.25 runs per innings and a highest score of 65. He also took 41 wickets, including five for 23 in an innings in the match against Warwickshire when, in Wisden's report, \"he bowled an excellent length and with some variety of pace made the ball turn quickly\". In its review of Somerset's season, Wisden added that Lee had made \"an encouraging start\" and \"may develop into a thoroughly good all-round player\".", "The praise from Wisden for Lee's performance in 1932 was rather less grudging: \"Jack Lee fully maintained his ability as a batsman,\" it said. Lee's overall figures were similar to those of 1931, with 949 runs at 21.56. There was again a single century, this time in the match against Essex at Leyton, and Lee put on 234 for the first wicket with his brother, Frank, an opening partnership somewhat overshadowed by the record 555-run first-wicket partnership by Yorkshire's Percy Holmes and Herbert Sutcliffe on the same ground just two weeks earlier. There was an advance, though, in Lee's bowling: White had retired from the Somerset captaincy after the 1931 season and played in only half the county's matches, and Lee had more bowling to do, responding with 67 wickets at, for him, the low average of 25.88 runs per wicket.", "After the 1935 season Lee accepted the position of head cricket coach at Mill Hill School in north London. His departure was controversial: the biography of Harold Gimblett, written by the historian of Somerset County Cricket Club, David Foot, reported more than 40 years after the event that \"old players still grumble about the way Jack Lee departed\". Gimblett told Foot, in tape recordings that form the basis of the biography, that Lee had been vocal about the disparities in treatment between the amateurs who still formed a large percentage of the Somerset side and the half dozen professional cricketers the county employed; Gimblett also said that Lee felt he was due a benefit match. When Lee approached the Somerset secretary, the former captain John Daniell, to say he had been offered the job at Mill Hill, in reality \"he wanted to remain with Somerset... Should he take the job? Yes, he was apparently advised.\"Foot (1986), p137. To Gimblett and other Somerset professionals, Foot wrote, this indicated that the county officials were \"offhanded in their treatment of the pros\", and particularly of one with a history of being disrespectful of the amateurs."]}, {"page": "1952\u201353 Stoke City F.C. season", "response": ["Prior to the lead up to 1953 Stoke had agonisingly slipped into the relegation zone, but seven games without defeat at the turn of the year they seemed to have averted the danger. But then it all went wrong again and they slipped back down the table and in the end they had to win their final match of the season against an already relegated Derby County at the Victoria Ground. Most expected Stoke to step it up and beat a dejected Derby side but disaster struck as Jack Lee scored for the \"Rams\" early on. Stoke hit back through Frank Bowyer but Jackie Stamps but Derby 2\u20131 up. Stoke created plenty of chances and with just minutes left were awarded a penalty but the reliable Ken Thomson hit his kick straight at Ray Middleton and with it ended Stoke's 20 year stay in the First Division."]}]}}
