Prior to this he was part of the Great Britain cycling team for eight years as a sprint athlete.In addition to his five British titles, Lewis is the current British keirin champion after successfully defending his title on 26/01/2018. He was successful in winning various international accolades, culminating in five world cup medals and multiple European and world championship honours. Oliva has also represented Wales at the Commonwealth Games at Delhi 2010,  Glasgow, 2014 and Gold Coast 2018. He took the silver medal in the keirin in the 2018 Games, after progressing from the first round via the repechages. His most recent competition (World Championship) representing Great Britain was the 2017 Worlds, where he competed in the keirin, his favourite event whilst balancing a vigorous training regime alongside his demanding studies at Cardiff Medical School. In October 2018 he announced that he would be stepping away from international competition after that year's edition of the Six Days of London in order to concentrate on his medical studies, although he did not rule out a comeback once he had completed his medical degree.Oliva was educated at Shirenewton Primary School, then at Monmouth School: he participated in the Queen's Baton Relay there in September 2017, ahead of the 2018 Commonwealth Games. He subsequently spent six years studying for a degree in philosophy with the Open University whilst being part of the British Cycling Academy programme. Since 2016, he has been a student of Medicine at Cardiff University in Wales. He is married to fellow racing cyclist and physiotherapist Ciara Horne.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Monmouth School for Boys", "response": ["*Lewis Oliva, (born 1992), team GB cyclist "]}, {"page": "List of British cyclists", "response": ["* Lewis Oliva"]}, {"page": "Jason Kenny", "response": ["At the Commonwealth Games he won a silver medal in the Team Sprint.

Despite his poor form in the early rounds, in the 1/8 round he beat Matthew Glaetzer, the fastest qualifier (qualifying almost half a second quicker) and holder of the Commonwealth record, in two straight rides, to secure his way into the semi-finals, where he beat Peter Lewis after three rides.
