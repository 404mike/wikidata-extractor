Scabies formed a one-off band called \"Les Punks\" for a late 1978 gig: Les Punks was a quasi-reunion of The Damned (without Brian James or Lu) that featured Scabies, Vanian, Sensible and bassist Lemmy of Hawkwind and Mot\u00f6rhead. The Damned tentatively reformed with the \"Les Punks\" line-up in early 1979, but originally performed as \"The Doomed\" to avoid potential trademark problems. Captain Sensible switched to guitar and keyboards, and after a brief period with Lemmy on bass for studio demos and a handful of live appearances,see the notes for Smash It Up - The Anthology 1976\u20131987 and a slightly longer period with Henry Badowski on bass, the bassist position was filled by Algy Ward, formerly of The Saints. During a December 1978 tour of Scotland, Gary Holton filled in for Vanian."]}, {"page": "Machine Gun Etiquette", "response": ["* Henry Badowski \u2013 backing vocals (\"Noise, Noise, Noise\")"]}]}}
