One teacher, Alan Corkish, made public the school's punishment book and was summonsed to a disciplinary hearing, which instigated rioting and protests by students. In a televised interview with the BBC's The Oxford Road Show, Alan Corkish explained his reasons for whistleblowing, stating that the school would use corporal punishment for trivial offenses \"as the first resort, in almost every instance\". Corkish suggested that many staff at the school were unaware of the rate of punishments at the school and suggested he knew only of four colleagues who opposed such punishments. Despite around 200 students staging a walkout in support of Corkish making the excessive punishments publicly known, he was subsequently sacked from his post several months later and his appeal to Sefton Council failed after a 5 hour meeting, following which he was reported to be considering taking his case to the High Court. Corkish appealed his dismissal and ultimately won his case at the Court of Appeal, with a ruling that Sefton Council \"had followed the wrong procedures in dismissing Mr Alan Corkish\". Corkish, who was being supported by the National Union of Teachers, was awarded his legal costs for appealing and said that he could not \"wait to get back into teaching\" and was open to the idea of returning to Litherland High School, although accepting that it was not \"the best thing for everyone\"."]}, {"page": "1990 Bootle by-elections", "response": ["The first by-election was caused by the death of Labour MP Allan Roberts, on 21 March 1990.
