He worked as a miner in Nanaimo, British Columbia and wrestled his first match in 1889, winning the Pacific Coast heavyweight championship that same year.On 26 October 1897, McLeod defeated Martin Burns to win the American Heavyweight Championship, which he would retain for four years. The most notable incident during his reign as champion came far away from the media spotlight when on 18 June 1899, McLeod met and defeated a young Frank Gotch in a hard-fought impromptu match on a cinder track. It was Gotch's very first professional match and he later recounted that McLeod had hustled all involved by pretending to be a simple furniture dealer from a neighboring town, but was sufficiently impressed by Gotch's talent to leave him a visiting card revealing his true identity.  Gotch would go on to defeat McLeod on multiple occasions after much training under Martin \"Farmer\" Burns.  McLeod occasionally used the \"catch name\" alias George Little.\nMcLeod's reign as champion came to an end on 7 November 1901, when he was defeated by Tom Jenkins. Amid a series of rematches between the two men, McLeod recaptured the title on Christmas Day 1902 but lost it to Jenkins the following April at Broadway Arsenal.After retirement, McLeod worked as a wrestling instructor at the Los Angeles Athletic Club.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Frank Gotch", "response": ["Gotch wrestled and won his first match against Marshall Green in Humboldt on April 2, 1899, but his first important match was in Lu Verne, Iowa on June 16, 1899, against a man claiming to be a furniture dealer from a neighboring town. Gotch held his own for nearly two hours, but lost the hard-fought contest. Only later when he received the impressed man's visiting card, he did learn that his opponent had actually been reigning American Heavyweight Champion Dan McLeod. On December 18, 1899, Gotch challenged another former American Heavyweight Champion, \"Farmer\" Martin Burns, losing in 11 minutes, but impressing Burns as well, who offered to train Gotch. Under the guidance of Burns, Gotch won a series of matches in Iowa and later Yukon. While in the Yukon, Gotch wrestled under the name Frank Kennedy and won the title of \"Champion of the Klondike\". During his time in the Yukon, Gotch tried his hand at boxing, but failed miserably against the heavyweight Frank \"Paddy\" Slavin.Chapman, Mike, Frank Gotch, World's Greatest Wrestler (William S. Hein & Co., Inc., 1990), p. 23; Hewitt, Mark S., \"Professional Wrestling: Frank Gotch in the Klondike\", Journal of Manly Arts, September 2001 (Research in Dawson Daily News by Don Luce. Research in Klondike Daily Nugget and Klondike Semi-Weekly Nugget by Bill Taylor.", "Gotch competed in an era when a championship wrestling match was the same as a championship prize fight: i.e., it was a major event for which the wrestlers went into training and which promoters publicized for weeks. Thus, he did not have a long career in terms of the number of matches wrestled. His mentor Farmer Burns, and later champions Ed Lewis, the \"Strangler\", as well as Lou Thesz, each engaged in more than 6,000 matches in their careers. Gotch engaged in only 160, finishing with a record of 154 wins and only 6 losses. Of those six losses, however, two were in the first year of his career \u2013 to Dan McLeod and Farmer Burns \u2013 and three were to Tom Jenkins. His last defeat was to Fred Beell on December 1, 1906, when he had crashed head-first into an uncovered turnbuckle and been rendered nearly unconscious. He defeated Beell in seven rematches and never lost again by the time of his retirement in 1913."]}, {"page": "George Little", "response": ["*Dan McLeod (wrestler) (1860\u20131958), Scottish wrestler, born George Little"]}, {"page": "American Heavyweight Championship", "response": ["|Dan McLeod", "|Dan McLeod"]}]}}
