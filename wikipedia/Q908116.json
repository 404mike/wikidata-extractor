Steno showed that the angles between the faces are the same in every exemplar of a particular type of crystal, and Ren\u00e9 Just Ha\u00fcy (1784) discovered that every face of a crystal can be described by simple stacking patterns of blocks of the same shape and size. Hence, William Hallowes Miller in 1839 was able to give each face a unique label of three small integers, the Miller indices which remain in use today for identifying crystal faces. Ha\u00fcy's study led to the correct idea that crystals are a regular three-dimensional array (a Bravais lattice) of atoms and molecules; a single unit cell is repeated indefinitely along three principal directions that are not necessarily perpendicular. In the 19th century, a complete catalog of the possible symmetries of a crystal was worked out by Johan Hessel, Auguste Bravais, Evgraf Fedorov, Arthur Sch\u00f6nflies and (belatedly) William Barlow (1894). From the available data and physical reasoning, Barlow proposed several crystal structures in the 1880s that were validated later by X-ray crystallography; See also    however, the available data were too scarce in the 1880s to accept his models as conclusive."]}, {"page": "Scientific phenomena named after people", "response": ["* Bravais\u2013Miller indices (a.k.a.

By 1826, he was already using the integer reciprocals of Weiss' coefficients (the intersection of a plane with the three crystallographic axes) to describe the spatial positions of crystal surfaces, from which the British crystallographer William Hallowes Miller (1801-1880) developed the concept of Miller indices in 1839.  By assigning symmetry elements to the crystal systems defined previously by Weiss and Friedrich Mohs (1773-1839), Frankenheim was able, for the first time, to define 32 point groups (crystal classes) and to classify them into four crystal systems (the regular one, the fourfold, the twofold and the sixfold).  From his observations he derived 15 lattice types for crystals, which were later reduced by Auguste Bravais (1811-1863) to 14 and today as Bravais lattices describe unit cells of crystal structures. Frankenheim conducted one of the first microscopic examinations of crystals in polarized light, using the then-new Nicol prism as a polarizer."]}, {"page": "Albrecht Schrauf", "response": ["Known for his investigations in the field of crystallography, he was a proponent of the crystallographic index developed by William Hallowes Miller.Google Books Scholars in Stone and Bronze In the mid-1860s, he published his best works, \"Atlas der Krystallformen des Mineralreiches\" and an award-winning textbook titled \"Lehrbuch der physikalischen Mineralogie\".
