In August 1953 he had a trial with Manchester City, and made his debut two months later against Tottenham. The teenage Hayes appeared in the 1955 FA Cup Final, but finished on the losing side. 12 months later Manchester City reached the final again, and Hayes scored the first goal in a 3\u20131 win. Hayes was a regular goalscorer in the late 1950s and early 1960s, until a knee injury occurring in September 1963 had a noticeable effect on his abilities, after which first team opportunities became limited. He was transferred to Barnsley in the 1965 close season, and later went on to play for Wigan Athletic, appearing 32 times and scoring seven goals for the club. In total, Hayes scored 152 goals in 363 appearances for Manchester City, making him the third highest Manchester City goalscorer of all time.\nHayes died in 1999 at the age of 63.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Francis Lee (footballer)", "response": ["Lee also held the record for the most goals in Manchester derbies, scoring 10 goals in all against Manchester United, a tally that equalled Joe Hayes' record. This record was later beaten by Wayne Rooney who scored his 11th goal in a Manchester derby on 22 September 2013."]}, {"page": "Bert Trautmann", "response": ["During the previous final, nerves had contributed to the opposition scoring an early goal, but the City team was more settled on this occasion. Under the influence of Don Revie who was outstanding on the day, City scored an early goal, a left-footed strike by Joe Hayes. Birmingham equalised on 14\u00a0minutes. The match remained level until midway through the second half, when Jack Dyson and Bobby Johnstone scored two goals in as many minutes to give Manchester City a 3\u20131 lead. Birmingham attacked strongly in the next ten minutes. In the 75th minute, Trautmann, diving at an incoming ball, was knocked out in a collision with Birmingham's Peter Murphy in which he was hit in the neck by Murphy's right knee. No substitutes were permitted in those days, so Trautmann, dazed and unsteady on his feet, carried on. For the remaining 15\u00a0minutes he defended his net, making a crucial interception to deny Murphy once more. Manchester City held on for the victory, and Trautmann was the hero because of his spectacular saves in the last minutes of the match. Trautmann admitted later that he had spent the last part of the match \"in a kind of fog\"."]}, {"page": "Don Revie", "response": ["McDowall fined Revie \u00a327 for missing two weeks of training for a family holiday in Blackpool, which infuriated him as he had already won permission from trainer Laurie Barnett and had promised to train whilst on holiday. McDowall dropped Revie for much of the 1955\u201356 season, preferring instead to play Bobby Johnstone. Revie played only one FA Cup match that season before being named in the team for the 1956 FA Cup Final against Birmingham City, with Johnstone being moved to the wings. He provided the assist for Joe Hayes's opening goal, and instructed Ken Barnes to deviate from the manager's instructions at half-time, with the result being a more dominant second half display and a 3\u20131 victory; Revie was named as Man of the Match. However the rift with his manager was not forgotten, and he was moved to right-half in the 1956\u201357 campaign, leaving him to seek a move away from Maine Road."]}, {"page": "Lancaster City F.C.", "response": ["|Joe Hayes||1966||1968"]}, {"page": "Manchester derby", "response": ["| Joe Hayes"]}, {"page": "Roy Clarke (footballer)", "response": ["In the 1954\u201355 season Manchester City had success using a tactical system known as the Revie Plan, in which Don Revie was used as a deep-lying centre-forward. Clarke was one of the players to benefit from this system, with interplay between Clarke and Revie prominent. A long run in the FA Cup followed. Clarke scored the winning goal in a semi-final against Sunderland, heading in a Joe Hayes cross to send City to Wembley, but suffered a knee injury late in the match.Ward, The Manchester City Story, p46 After missing five matches Clarke returned to the starting line-up, but he aggravated the injury in the final league match of the season. The knee required an operation, causing him to miss the 1955 FA Cup Final.", "Manchester City reached the FA cup final again the following season, Clarke played all but one match of the cup run, and supplied a cross for the winning goal in both the quarter-final (against Everton), and the semi-final (against Tottenham Hotspur). Manchester City played Birmingham City in the final, and were viewed as underdogs, despite reaching the final the previous year.James, Manchester City \u2013 The Complete Record, p 125 Early in the match Clarke exchanged passes with Don Revie, who set up Joe Hayes for Manchester City to take the lead with less than three minutes played.James, Manchester City \u2013 The Complete Record, p 122 Birmingham equalised in the first half, but two second half goals meant Manchester City beat Birmingham City 3\u20131.

Second half goals from Jack Dyson and Bobby Johnstone gave Manchester City a 3\u20131 victory.

The visitors took the lead after only 10\u00a0seconds (their fastest goal ever), but midway through the match, fog enveloped Maine Road. The match was abandoned during the second half, immediately after City had scored an equalising goal, and replayed the following Wednesday; City won 2\u20131. In the fourth round Manchester City faced Southend United at Roots Hall. The Essex club's ground had only opened five months previously, and was suffering from drainage problems. Torrential rainfall meant that in the week before the match a trench was dug across the pitch, and sand added. Though Southend were a Third Division team, their familiarity with the uneven pitch meant the match was closely contested. Southend pressured the Manchester City goal, requiring Bert Trautmann to make several saves, but Joe Hayes scored the only goal of the game on a City counter-attack to earn a fifth-round tie against Liverpool.Rowlands, Trautmann: The Biography, p.\u00a0175.", "|Forward ||8 ||Joe Hayes"]}, {"page": "1955 FA Cup Final", "response": ["|8 || Joe Hayes"]}, {"page": "List of Manchester City F.C. seasons", "response": ["|align=left|Johnny HartJoe Hayes", "|align=left|Joe Hayes", "|align=left|Joe Hayes"]}, {"page": "List of Manchester City F.C. records and statistics", "response": ["| rowspan=2|5 || Joe Hayes || align=\"left\" |  || 1953\u20131965 || rowspan=2|152", "| 5|| Joe Hayes || align=\"left\" |  || 1953\u20131965 || 142"]}, {"page": "1955\u201356 FA Cup", "response": ["The final took place on Saturday, 5 May 1956 at Wembley and ended 3\u20131, with goals scored by Joe Hayes, Bobby Johnstone and Jack Dyson for Manchester City and Noel Kinsey for Birmingham City.
