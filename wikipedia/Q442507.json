Parepa's aristocratic father died soon after her birth, and her mother turned to the stage to support them. Parepa made her operatic debut in 1855, at age 16, and soon earned enthusiastic reviews in the major London opera houses. In 1867, following the death of her first husband, Parepa married the violinist and conductor Carl Rosa in New York, and they founded an opera company with Parepa as the leading lady. They toured successfully in America for several years. After their return to Britain with ambitious plans for their opera company, Parepa fell ill and died in 1874 at only 37 years of age.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Euphrosyne (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Euphrosyne Parepa-Rosa (1836\u20131874), Scottish soprano"]}, {"page": "Royal Philharmonic Society", "response": ["** Euphrosyne Parepa-Rosa", "** Euphrosyne Parepa-Rosa"]}, {"page": "Carl Rosa", "response": ["Carl August Nicholas Rosa (22 March 184230 April 1889) was a German-born musical impresario best remembered for founding an English opera company known as the Carl Rosa Opera Company.

In 1868, Gilbert had published a short comic sketch in Fun magazine titled \"Trial by Jury: An Operetta\". In 1873, Gilbert was asked by the theatrical manager, Carl Rosa, to write a work for his planned 1874 season. Gilbert expanded Trial into a one-act libretto. However, Rosa's wife Euphrosyne Parepa-Rosa, a childhood friend of Gilbert's, died after an illness in 1874 and Rosa dropped the project.Stedman, p. 121 Later in 1874 Gilbert offered the libretto to Richard D'Oyly Carte, but Carte could not use the piece at that time. By early 1875, Carte was managing the Royalty Theatre, and he needed a short opera to play as an afterpiece to Offenbach's La P\u00e9richole. He contacted Gilbert, asked about the piece, and suggested Sullivan to set the work. Sullivan was enthusiastic, and Trial by Jury was composed in a matter of weeks. The little piece was a runaway hit, outlasting the run of La P\u00e9richole and being revived at another theatre.Walbrook, H. M.

For $5 a ticket, people would receive an engraving and had the chance to acquire the opera house or any of its holdings.  Works from the art gallery wing were of particular interest. The lottery was very successful, and the association had to open branch offices in other cities to comply with the demand for tickets.
