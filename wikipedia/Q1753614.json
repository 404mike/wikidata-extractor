He had a good run at the club, saving them from relegation to the Third Division in what remained of the 2003\u201304 season. In the 2004\u201305 and 2005\u201306 seasons he took Brentford to the play-offs with fourth and third-place finishes respectively, but they were eliminated by Sheffield Wednesday and Swansea City respectively in the semi-finals on both occasions. Allen won press attention during the 2004\u201305 season for the success of his self-described \"two bob team\", which was composed of ageing pros (John Salako, Andy Myers, Scott Fitzgerald and Jamie Lawrence), free transfers (Deon Burton, Chris Hargreaves, Stewart Talbot and Isaiah Rankin) and young guns who would go on to play in the Premier League (Jay Tabb, Stephen Hunt, Sam Sodje and Michael Turner). Allen took Brentford to the fifth round of the FA Cup in two consecutive years, going out to Premier League sides Southampton in the 2004\u201305 season (losing 3\u20131 in a replay, after a 2\u20132 draw at St Mary's) and Charlton Athletic 3\u20131 in the 2005\u201306 season.

The move was made permanent on 2 February when he joined on a free transfer. Naylor was appointed vice-captain of the club and scored his first goal for the club in the 2\u20130 win over Southend United. Naylor helped rejuvenate Leeds' form after signing for his boyhood club, who had previously conceded several goals from set pieces. Leeds' defence considerably improved, and when Sam Sodje also signed for Leeds on loan they made a formidable centre back partnership at the back, after Leeds had previously had some defence problems. The performances of Naylor and Sodje helped Leeds reach the playoff semi-finals, but they eventually lost out to Millwall after losing 2\u20131 on aggregate over two legs."]}, {"page": "Sodje", "response": ["*Sam Sodje, footballer"]}, {"page": "Rui Marques", "response": ["At the start of the 2008\u201309 season, Marques, who is fluent in Spanish, acted as a translator for new Argentine signing Luciano Becchio. After a poor start to the 2008\u201309 season, with Leeds' defence leaking a lot of goals, McAllister was sacked and was replaced by Simon Grayson. Marques scored in Leeds' 2\u20130 win against Southend United on 28 January 2009. Marques played regularly under Grayson and began partnering new signing Richard Naylor, but when Sam Sodje was signed on loan from Reading, Marques lost his place when he suffered an hamstring injury. Leeds reached the playoff semi-finals but lost to Millwall.", "With Sam Sodje's loan spell over and captain Richard Naylor injured, Marques found himself as first choice central defence partnership with Patrick Kisnorbo at the start of the 2009\u201310 season. However, Marques lost his starting place when he suffered an Achilles injury while on international duty in September, and dropped down the pecking order when he was out injured when Leeds completed the signing of Leigh Bromby. Marques' injury kept him out for a prolonged period lasting over several matches. After featuring in some reserve matches and closed-door friendlies, Marques returned from injury and was named to the substitutes' bench against Kettering Town. After his spell out injured, he was behind Patrick Kisnorbo, Richard Naylor, Leigh Bromby and \u013dubom\u00edr Michal\u00edk in the pecking order for Leeds. Marques was named on the bench against Oldham Athletic and kept his place on the bench against Huddersfield Town.
