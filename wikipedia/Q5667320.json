Bidgood released dance band music under various names, mostly notably Primo Scala and his Accordion Band, who issued over 200 sides on 78rpm. Over the course of 20 years he would frequently broadcast on the BBC. In 1930, he and his band covered Amy, Wonderful Amy, a song about Amy Johnson. Bidgood was also the musical director for numerous films, including several starring George Formby. Apart from the many recordings made under his own name, he also led accordion bands under the names 'Rossini' and 'Don Porto'. As 'Primo Scala', he broadcast regularly on Music While You Work until just before his death. Many of these sessions were directed by deputies, such as Ernest Penfold, owing to Bidgood being in and out of hospital.\nHe died in November 1957, at the age of 59, having been diagnosed with inoperable stomach cancer.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Amy Johnson", "response": ["In June 1930, Johnson's flight to Australia was the subject of a contemporary popular song, \"Amy, Wonderful Amy\", composed by Horatio Nicholls and recorded by Harry Bidgood, Jack Hylton, Arthur Lally, Arthur Rosebery and Debroy Somers.

Another of Bidgood's sons was the dance band leader Harry Bidgood, also known as Primo Scala. In the 1901 census, Casselden was not living with her husband; she declared herself to be Rosetta Barnard and her 10-year-old son Alan Charles Butler to be \"Allan Barnard\" who was born in New York. Prior to cohabiting with Bidgood, she had three more sons (1893 - Thomas George who died in infancy; 1896 - Thomas Walter; and 1898 - Henry James), all were registered as \"Barnard\" (Harry Bidgood was Henry James Barnard). Thomas Walter was registered with Butler as the mother's name, the other two with Casselden. By the time Thomas Bidgood left his wife and son Albert Thomas, and set up home with Rosetta Casselden/Butler, Alan Charles Butler had moved on, and the remaining three sons adopted the surname Bidgood. A fourth was born in 1914 and named Warwick Bidgood.
