They had a bye in the first round and lost in the second round of the doubles tournament to Hannah Keith and Amber McCord, but won the consolation tournament. One journalist, Sydney Brown, noted that \"Miss L. Dod should be heard of in the future\". The following year, 1884, she participated in two tournaments, the Northern Championships, played that year in Liverpool, and Waterloo. With Annie she reached the doubles finals in both tournaments and with Tony she was defeated in the first round of the mixed doubles event at Waterloo. At the Northern Championships in 1885, she came to prominence when she nearly beat reigning Wimbledon champion Maud Watson in the final, losing 6\u20138, 5\u20137. Dod would win the doubles event (with Annie). Earlier she had won the first singles title of her career at the Waterloo tournament where she was also victorious in the doubles and mixed doubles events. These performances earned her the nickname \"Little Wonder\" in the press."]}, {"page": "Queen's Club Championships", "response": ["| 1884 ||  Maud Watson ||  Edith Coleridge Cole || 6-4 6-2 2-6 6-1 ", "| 1885 ||  Maud Watson ||  Lilian Watson || 6-2 6-3 "]}, {"page": "Balsall Common", "response": ["Several Premiership and Championship footballers live (and have lived) in Balsall Common, especially those playing with Birmingham City, Aston Villa and Coventry City.
