He was nicknamed \"Lordy\", in allusion to Ted Dexter (who was known as \"Lord Ted\") because of his aggressively big-hitting, confident batting style. He was a right-hand bat and occasional right-arm off-break bowler, who made 16 One Day International appearances for England between 1996 and 2001, with a best of 118.\nBrown scored over 15,000 runs in first-class cricket following his debut in 1992. An equally prolific one day player with over 11,000 runs, he also holds the world-record List-A score \u2013 268.

Following the resultant internal restructuring, a change of fortunes soon followed as new captain Alec Stewart \u2013 son of Micky \u2013 led the team to the Sunday League title in 1996. This in turn proved to be the catalyst for further success under the captaincy of Adam Hollioake and the influence of Keith Medlycott, who was county coach from 1997 to 2003. County Championship triumphs in 1999, 2000 and 2002 were complemented with Benson and Hedges Cup victories in 1997 and 2001, a National League Division Two title in 2000 and the inaugural Twenty20 Cup in 2003. This was in spite of the death of the highly talented all-rounder Ben Hollioake, Adam Hollioake's younger brother, who was involved in a fatal car accident in early 2002. That same year, Ali Brown posted what remains today a world record List A score of 268 against Glamorgan at The Oval, beating Graeme Pollock's former record score in the first of his two one-day double hundreds for Surrey.
