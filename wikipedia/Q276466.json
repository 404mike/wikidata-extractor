Pankhurst aligned herself with the \"new rules\" group, which became known as the Parliament Street Society (PSS). Some members of the PSS favoured a piecemeal approach to gaining the vote. Because it was often assumed that married women did not need the vote since their husbands \"voted for them,\" some PSS members felt that the vote for single women and widows was a practical step along the path to full suffrage. When the reluctance within the PSS to advocate on behalf of married women became clear, Pankhurst and her husband helped organise another new group dedicated to voting rights for all women \u2013 married and unmarried.Purvis 2002, pp. 29\u201330; Bartley, pp. 38\u201339; Pugh, pp. 53\u201354; E.S.
