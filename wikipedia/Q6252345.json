Silence. Eight solemn bell strokes echo and die. Again silence. Suddenly the brasses blare, and out of the trombones\u2019 awesome processional grows a steady roar \u2026 the big gongs the tam-tam beaten in a long and powerful resonance, shattering and echoing across mountains and along valleys. This is music of the high hills, music for vast spaces: \u2018The hour is coming when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God\u2019. We can feel the awe and the majesty of the High Alps and the great churches. The instrumental sounds are vast the silences are deep. The words of St John are alive in the music, and through these sounds Messiaen reveals himself and his vision.An extreme example from 1952 is 4\u203233\u2033, an experimental musical work by avant-garde composer John Cage, incorporating ambient sounds not foreseeable by the composer. Though first performed on the piano, the piece was composed for any instrument or instruments and is structured in three movements. The length of each movement is not fixed by the composer, but the total length of the combination of three movements is. The score instructs the performer(s) to remain silent throughout the piece.Cage, J.(1952),  4\u201933\", Published by Edition Peters (PE.P06777)"]}, {"page": "Wilfrid Mellers", "response": ["From 1964 until 1981 he was founding professor and head of the Music Department at the University of York; he remained emeritus professor of music there until his death. In contrast to most university music departments at the time which were dominated by musicology, Mellers focused the courses on performance leading towards composition and staffed his department with young composers, including Peter Aston, David Blake, Bernard Rands, and Robert Sherlaw Johnson. John Paynter joined a little later."]}, {"page": "Music education", "response": ["Contemporary music scholars assert that effective music advocacy uses empirically sound arguments that transcend political motivations and personal agendas. Music education philosophers such as Bennett Reimer, Estelle Jorgensen, David J. Elliott, John Paynter, and Keith Swanwick support this view, yet many music teachers and music organizations and schools do not apply this line of reasoning into their music advocacy arguments. Researchers such as Ellen Winner conclude that arts advocates have made bogus claims to the detriment of defending the study of music,Dorothy Wu, \"Entrepreneurship in Research: Ellen Winner on Why We Need the Arts,\" Entrepreneurship Review, (2013): [2 http://miter.mit/edu/ellen-winner-on-why-we-need-the-arts/] her research debunking claims that music education improves math, for example.David J.
