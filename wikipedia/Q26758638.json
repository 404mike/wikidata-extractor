He was named for his great-grandfather, who had a strong influence on his early life, ensuring that he was brought up devoutly Catholic. His mother's family had married into English aristocracy, and with their support, MacTavish began a career with the British diplomatic service. In the 1840s, he became interested in politics, and stood for election as a candidate in an Irish seat at the 1847 general election. He was narrowly elected, but the result was overturned following an election petition, which challenged both the conduct of the election and his status as a British subject. The committee ruled that some votes had been cast illegally, but did not find that it was proven he was ineligible to sit.\nMacTavish later returned to America, where he married a daughter of General Winfield Scott, and took over a large family plantation in Maryland with around fifty slaves. He remained a slaveholder until the end of the Civil War, when he sold the estate, though he was considered a loyal Union citizen. He died in 1868.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dundalk (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Charles MacTavish"]}, {"page": "1847 in Ireland", "response": ["*26 August \u2013 1847 United Kingdom general election concludes with Repeal Association candidates receiving a majority of Irish votes, but the American Charles MacTavish's election in Dundalk will be overturned on appeal."]}, {"page": "MacTavish", "response": ["*Charles MacTavish (1818\u20131868), American landowner"]}, {"page": "Charles MacTavish (MP)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Charles MacTavish"]}, {"page": "Charles Carroll MacTavish", "response": ["#REDIRECTCharles MacTavish"]}, {"page": "Carroll MacTavish", "response": ["#REDIRECTCharles MacTavish"]}]}}
