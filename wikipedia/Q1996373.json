He began his career with amateur side Bolton Temperance before signing for First Division club Blackburn Rovers but was released a year later having made no appearances. He instead joined Second Division side Bolton Wanderers and was eventually handed his professional debut in 1904. Shepherd won promotion in his first full season with Bolton and the following year he finished as the top goalscorer in the First Division. His form led to call ups for the Football League representative XI and the England national football team, scoring on his debut for both sides in 1906.\nHe joined Newcastle United in 1908, winning the First Division title and becoming the first player for Newcastle to reach thirty goals in a single season during the 1909\u201310 season, including scoring both goals in the 1910 FA Cup Final during a 2\u20130 victory over Barnsley. He gained a second cap for England in 1911 before his career was halted after sustaining a serious knee injury that kept him out for over a year. After struggling to regain form after his return, he was sold to Bradford City where he spent one season before retiring. During his career, he scored over 150 goals in the Football League in 241 appearances.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "History of Newcastle United F.C.", "response": ["In 1903\u201304, the club built up a promising squad of players, and went on to dominate English football for almost a decade, the team known for their \"artistic play, combining team-work and quick, short passing\". Newcastle started to purchase talented players, especially from Scotland, and soon had a squad to rival all of England. With players like Colin Veitch, Jackie Rutherford, Jimmy Lawrence and Albert Shepherd, Newcastle had a team of international talent. Bill McCracken, Jimmy Howie, Peter McWilliam and Andy Aitken were also household names in their day. Long after his retirement, defender Peter McWilliam said \"The Newcastle team of the 1900s would give any modern side a two goal start and beat them, and further more, beat them at a trot.\""]}, {"page": "List of Newcastle United F.C. players", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Albert Shepherd||||FW||1908\u20131914||123||92||"]}, {"page": "Great Lever", "response": ["Footballer Albert Shepherd played for Bolton Wanderers and Newcastle United."]}]}}
