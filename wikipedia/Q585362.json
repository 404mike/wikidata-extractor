Over the years, the story was embellished.  One version was that the man who produced the stamps, Joseph Osmond Barnard, was a half-blind watchmaker and an old man who absent-mindedly forgot what he was supposed to print on the stamps. On his way from his shop to visit the postmaster, a Mr. Brownrigg, he passed a post office with a sign hanging above it.  This provided the necessary jog to his memory and he returned to his work and finished engraving the plates for the stamps, substituting \"Post Office\" for \"Post Paid\". This story appears to have arisen from a book by Georges Brunel in 1928.

Adolphe and d'Unienville wrote that \"It is much more likely that Barnard used 'Post Office' because this was, and still is, the legal denomination of the government department concerned\".  The plates were approved and the stamps issued without any fuss at the time.  Joseph Barnard was an Englishman of Jewish descent from Portsmouth who had arrived in Mauritius in 1838 as a stowaway, thrown off a commercial vessel bound for Sydney.  He was not a watch-maker, although he may have turned his hand to watch repairs; not half-blind; and certainly not old; he was born in 1816 and was therefore 31 years old when he engraved the stamps in 1847. In addition, several rubber stamps used in Mauritius on letters prior to these stamps also used the words \"Post Office\", as did the first two stamps issued by the United States in July 1847.Scott nos. 1 & 2."]}, {"page": "Barnard", "response": ["* Joseph Osmond Barnard (1816\u20131865), engraver of the Mauritius \"Post Office\" stamps"]}, {"page": "Postage stamps and postal history of Mauritius", "response": ["The stamps were engraved by Joseph Osmond Barnard, born in England on August 10, 1816, who stowed away on a ship to Mauritius in 1838.Kanai, Classic Mauritius, pp. 20-21.
