When Flaxman first saw them at Elgin's house in 1807, he advised against their restoration.Whinney 1971, p. 140. Flaxman's statements in favour of their purchase by the government to a parliamentary commission carried considerable weight; the sculptures were eventually bought in 1816. His designs for the friezes of Ancient Drama and Modern Drama, for the facade of the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, made in 1809 and carved by John Charles Felix Rossi, provide an early example of the direct influence of the marbles on British sculpture.Whinney 1971, p. 140.

Its plan consists of a rectangle with a portico extending to the south and Wyatt's rectangular extension to the north. The extension is slightly narrower than the rest of the building, and also has a projecting portico. The building has two storeys and a basement; the stonework of the basement and lower storey is rusticated. The south face, overlooking Castle Street, has nine bays. Its central three bays are occupied by the portico. This has three rounded arches on the ground floor, and four pairs of Corinthian columns in the upper storey surrounding a balcony. The east and west faces also have nine bays in the original part of the building, plus an additional three bays to the north on Wyatt's extension. The middle three bays of the nine original bays project slightly forward and are surmounted by a pediment. The roof of the north face is higher than that of the main building.  This face has five bays, with a central portico of three bays. On its first floor are four pairs of Corinthian columns and standing on the roof above these are four statues dating from 1792 by Richard Westmacott;  these statues have been moved from the Irish Houses of Parliament.  Above the upper storey windows on all faces are panels containing carvings, some of which relate to Liverpool's foreign trade.  The dome stands on a high drum supported on Corinthian columns. Around the base of the dome are four clock faces, each of which is supported by a lion and unicorn.  On the summit of the dome is a statue, representing Minerva. It is  high and was designed by John Charles Felix Rossi."]}, {"page": "Mountsorrel", "response": ["* The sculptor John Charles Felix Rossi lived in the village in the 19th century"]}, {"page": "St James's Church, Piccadilly", "response": ["* John Charles Felix Rossi RA (1762\u20131839),  English sculptor"]}, {"page": "List of British artists", "response": ["* John Charles Felix Rossi (1762\u20131839) \u2013 sculptor"]}, {"page": "Richard James Wyatt", "response": ["Wyatt was born in London, the son of Edward Wyatt the elder (1757\u20131833) and Anne Maddox; he was baptised at St James, Middlesex.

When Canova visited this country Wyatt was brought under his notice by Sir Thomas Lawrence, and received from him an invitation to Rome.

The octagonal domed ceiling of the vestibule is in imitation of the Tower of the Winds, and the tower above uses details from the same structure. At the east end is an apse, flanked by the church's most original features: two tribunes designed in imitation of the Erechtheum, with entablatures supported by caryatids. Unlike those on the Erechtheum, each caryatid holds a symbolic extinguished torch or an empty jug, appropriate for their positions above the entrances to the burial vault. There is a stone sarcophagus behind the figures in each tribune, and the cornices are studded with lion's heads. The caryatids are made of terracotta, constructed in sections around cast-iron columns, and were modelled by John Charles Felix Rossi,  who provided all the terracotta on the building. The upper levels of the tribunes were designed as vestries."]}, {"page": "Eleanor Coade", "response": ["John Bacon, a talented sculptor, had worked for Mrs Coade since 1769.

Their joint success meant that the Coade Artificial Stone Manufactory gained the business of all the eminent Georgian architects, including Robert Adam, James Wyatt, Samuel Wyatt, Sir William Chambers, John Nash, and John Soane. Throughout this period of the late 18th century, Mrs Coade also employed designers and modellers such as John Devaere (John De Vaere (1755\u20131830)) before he joined Josiah Wedgwood in 1790,\"Profile of John de Vaere\", National Portrait Gallery), John Charles Felix Rossi, J.
