Convinced by the work of Edward Jenner, he was among the first to promote vaccination. His four volume book on medical botany published between 1790 and 1794 with 300 illustrations of medicinal plants by James Sowerby was an important reference work for physicians in the nineteenth century with a second edition in 1810 followed by a revision in 1832 by William Jackson Hooker and George Spratt.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Smallpox vaccine", "response": ["In the early empirical days of vaccination, before Louis Pasteur's work on establishing the germ theory and Joseph Lister's on antisepsis and asepsis, there was considerable cross-infection. William Woodville, one of the early vaccinators and director of the London Smallpox Hospital is thought to have contaminated the cowpox matter \u2013 the vaccine \u2013 with smallpox matter and this essentially produced variolation. Other vaccine material was not reliably derived from cowpox, but from other skin eruptions of cattle. In modern times, an effective scientific model and controlled production were important in reducing these causes of apparent failure or iatrogenic illness."]}, {"page": "Contrayerva", "response": ["William Woodville wrote in Medical Botany: \"The root of Contrayerva has a peculiar kind of aromatic smell, and a light astringent warm bitterish taste, and on being long chewed it discovers somewhat of a sweetish sharpness. According to Lewis, 'Contrayerva root gives out its virtue, by the assistance of heat, both to water and rectified spirit, and tinges the former of a dark brownish red, the latter of a brighter reddish colour: the watery decoction is very mucilaginous, so as not to pass through a filter.'

Second edition, 1810, Vol. I, p. 485.", "The official contrayerva root or radix contrayervae in 18th century English medical literature was Dorstenia contrajerva, but the roots of other Dorstenia species such as the closely related Dorstenia drakenaand Dorstenia brasiliensis were also often collected and sold. The 18th century physician and botanist William Woodville wrote: \u201cupon the faith of Dr. Houston, who examined the Contrayerva plants in their native soil, we should otherwise have had no doubt in referring the official radix contrayervae to the species (i.e. Dorstenia contrajerva) he has described, as has been done by Bergius and Murray. But as Houston has observed, that the roots of different species of Dorstenia are promiscuously gathered and exported for those of the Contrayerva; and as all the species bear a great resemblance to each other, we conceive the further discussion of this subject to be of no material consequence.\u201d The 19th century English pharmacologist Jonathan Pereira wrote in his Elements of Materia Medica that the Contrayerva root \u201cusually met in the shops\u201d is not Dorstenia contrajerva but Dorstenia brasiliensis\u2014\u201cA native of Jamaica, Brazil, and Trinidad.\u201dPereira, Jonathan.

The 18th century physician and botanist William Woodville wrote: \u201cThe antipoisonous virtues formerly attributed to this root, have been long very justly exploded as entirely chimerical, so that it is now merely employed as a diaphoretic of a moderately stimulant kind, being possessed of less pungency than any other of those medicines usually denominated alexipharmic.
