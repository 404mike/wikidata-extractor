By the end of 1954, there were 1,069 gay men in prison in England and Wales, with an average age of 37. There were a number of high-profile arrests and trials, including that of scientist, mathematician, and war-time code-breaker Alan Turing, convicted in 1952 of \"gross indecency\". He accepted treatment with female hormones (chemical castration) as an alternative to prison. Turing committed suicide in 1954. In 2009, then Prime Minister Gordon Brown, in response to a petition, issued an apology on behalf of the British Government for \"the appalling way he was treated\". In 1954, the trial and eventual imprisonment of Edward Montagu (the 3rd Baron Montagu of Beaulieu), Michael Pitt-Rivers and Peter Wildeblood for committing acts of \"homosexual indecency\" caused uproar and led to the establishment of a committee to examine and report on the law covering \"homosexual offences\" appointed by Sir David Maxwell Fyfe and Sir Hugh Lucas-Tooth."]}, {"page": "Pitt-Rivers", "response": ["* Michael Pitt-Rivers (1917\u20131999), George (1890\u20131966)'s son, who gained notoriety when put on trial charged with buggery"]}, {"page": "1954 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 24 March \u2013 after an eight-day trial at Winchester Assizes, The Lord Montagu of Beaulieu, Peter Wildeblood and Michael Pitt-Rivers are convicted of \"conspiracy to incite certain male persons to commit serious offences with male persons\" or buggery and related charges.

Wildeblood brought with him two young RAF servicemen: his lover Edward McNally, and John Reynolds. The foursome were joined by Montagu's cousin Michael Pitt-Rivers. At the subsequent trial, the two airmen turned Queen's Evidence, and claimed there had been dancing and \"abandoned behaviour\" at the gathering. Wildeblood said it had in fact been \"extremely dull\". Montagu claims that it was all remarkably innocent, saying: \"We had some drinks, we danced, we kissed, that's all.\"", "Wildeblood was arrested on 9 January 1954, and in March he was brought before the British courts charged with \"conspiracy to incite certain male persons to commit serious offences with male persons\" (or \"buggery\"). Wildeblood was charged along with Lord Montagu and Michael Pitt-Rivers, and during the course of the trial he admitted his homosexuality to the court. Montagu received a 12-month sentence, while Wildeblood and Pitt-Rivers were sentenced to 18 months in prison as a result of these and other charges. The harsh verdict divided opinion and led to an inquiry resulting in the Wolfenden Report, which in 1957 recommended the decriminalisation of homosexuality in the UK. Wildeblood's testimony to the Wolfenden committee was influential on its recommendations. The committee was set up during the prison sentence of Peter Wildeblood in order to investigate the law regarding homosexuality and to give advice and recommendations for reform if need be. Setting up the committee was made possible thanks to increased public attention about homosexuality generated by this and other cases. Peter Wildeblood thus made a great contribution to legal reform, by providing evidence and arguments for the debate in the House of Lords where the law to decriminalise homosexuality was passed in October 1965. Peter Wildeblood was the only openly gay witness to be interviewed and his book Against the Law served as a passionate account of the case and the need for reform."]}]}}
