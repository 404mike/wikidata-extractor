During his years with Stockport, several of his players went on to play at higher levels, the most prominent being Arthur Goddard who signed his first contract with Stewart. With Cardiff, the squad which Stewart considered the strongest of his time there, consisted of five players who had never played professionally before and had been signed from non-League sides or through youth teams: Tom Farquharson, Jimmy Nelson, Herbie Evans, Fred Keenor and Len Davies. Another, Hardy, had made his professional debut in England under Stewart with Stockport."]}, {"page": "1926\u201327 Cardiff City F.C. season", "response": ["Following the below par performances, Stewart initiated an overhaul of his playing squad during the off-season. The high-profile departures included Jack Evans, the club's first professional signing in 1910 who had been with the side for 16 years. Also leaving were Cassidy, less than a year after his \u00a33,800 move and for a fee described in The Times as \"substantially less\" than the one paid for him, and Joe Nicholson, who had led the club's attack in the 1925 FA Cup Final. Several fringe players also left the club, including Herbie Evans, Alfie Hagan, Joe Hills, Denis Lawson, Jack Page and Ebor Reed. However, the most significant departure was club captain Jimmy Blair who joined A.F.C. Bournemouth for \u00a33,900. His sale resulted in Fred Keenor being appointed the new captain of the first team. He had served as vice-captain under Blair and had filled the role on numerous occasions and was a popular choice for the position. Upon his appointment, the Football Echo remarked that Keenor was \"a leader in every sense of the word, he commands respect of colleagues and sets an inspiring example by his wholehearted enthusiasm.\""]}, {"page": "1923\u201324 Cardiff City F.C. season", "response": ["Cardiff began their season with a home tie against FA Cup holders Bolton Wanderers. A brace from Jimmy Gill and one from Joe Clennell helped the side to an opening day victory with the match finishing 3\u20132 with Bolton's David Jack scoring twice. A 2\u20131 victory over Sunderland in the following match left Cardiff as one of only five unbeaten teams in the First Division after two matches. Cardiff met Bolton in the reverse fixture on 1 September in the team's first away match of the season. Bolton took a 2\u20130 lead before Len Davies scored his first goal of the season with ten minutes remaining. Cardiff were awarded a penalty soon after but Herbie Evans' effort was saved by Bolton goalkeeper Dick Pym. Cardiff eventually equalised when Billy Hardy converted from a corner to end the match with a 2\u20132 draw. A 3\u20130 victory over Sunderland placed Cardiff top of the table after four matches and the team's performance garnered praise from manager Fred Stewart who declared the match \"the greatest game I have ever witnessed and I have never seen our lads play such wonderful football.\" The side went on to lose the top position on goal average following a goalless draw with West Ham United.", "Having surrendered first place to Huddersfield Town, Cardiff retook the position by defeating West Bromwich Albion with a brace from Gill and one from Herbie Evans. In the reverse fixture against West Brom a week later, Len Davies became the first Cardiff player to score four goals in a Football League match when he scored all of his side's goals in a 4\u20132 victory. Back-to-back fixtures against Manchester City yielded consecutive 1\u20131 draws. In the first tie, Cardiff were deemed lucky to have gained a point with The Times stating, \"the balance of play was all against them\". Billy Grimshaw had given Cardiff the lead with a \"speculative\" long shot with Manchester City equalising in the final 15 minutes. In the second tie, Scottish forward Denis Lawson made his debut having signed from St Mirren although he was described as not playing \"a very distinguished game\". The arrival of Lawson ultimately led to the departure of Grimshaw after the club received an offer of \u00a34,000 from fellow First Division side Sunderland. Grimshaw had made over 45 appearances in the previous two seasons and had been ever present prior to Lawson's signing but the chance to recoup a significant transfer fee proved too tempting for the club's board.", "A goal from Clennell was enough to beat Middlesbrough on New Year's Day but the return fixture against Aston Villa again ended in defeat for Cardiff as they were beaten 2\u20130. On 19 January, Cardiff met Arsenal in a match that was severely affected by strong winds and rain. Against the run of play, Cardiff took the lead through Len Davies but Arsenal were able to equalise soon after. A late attack saw Clennell score the winning goal although later reports suggest that he had been in an offside position. In the reverse fixtures a week later, Cardiff dominated the match and a hat-trick for Gill and a single goal for Len Davies resulted in a 4\u20130 victory. Cardiff's participation in the FA Cup and Welsh Cup restricted the amount of league fixtures played in February, with the side playing only two matches during the month. After defeating Blackburn Rovers 2\u20130 at Ninian Park following goals from Gill and Hardy, the side drew 1\u20131 with Tottenham Hotspur on 16 February. The start of March saw a severe dip in the side's form as injuries to key players Len Davies and Herbie Evans weakened the squad. A defeat to title rivals Huddersfield Town on 1 March reduced Cardiff's lead to a single point. International call-ups further affected the squad in the following match as five first team players were absent for a 2\u20130 defeat to Notts County, goalkeeper Tom Farquharson along with Keenor, Herbie Evans and Len Davies with Clennell injured. The side's poor run of form continued as they suffered further defeats to Blackburn and Notts County to record four consecutive losses and dropped to fourth position in the table.", "! scope=row|Herbie Evans"]}, {"page": "List of Glamorgan County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Herbie Evans (1922) : H.

The teams met again on 17 January 1923 but neither side emerged victorious for a second time as the match ended in a 2\u20132 draw. A second replay was needed at a neutral ground, being held at the home stadium of Aston Villa, Villa Park on 22 January.
