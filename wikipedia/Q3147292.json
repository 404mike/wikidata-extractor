This argument suggests that the ammunition was too far from the firing line and that the seventy rounds each man took to the firing line were not sufficient.MorrisLaband, p. 4. A different view, supported with evidence from the battlefield, such as Ian Knight and Lt. Colonel Snook's works, (the latter having written How Can Man Die Better?), suggests that, although Durnford's men probably did run out of ammunition, the majority of men in the firing line did not. The discovery of the British line so far out from the camp has led Ian Knight to conclude that the British were defending too large a perimeter.Snook, Mike.

Some of the dead had been carried away by friends or relatives but had to be abandoned during the pursuit. Many more warriors retreating from the battle were overtaken and killed by British mounted troops and furthermore, many wounded warriors died fore they could reach home and help, the following day 157 bodies were counted along the line of retreat with reports of more in the distance. The official British estimation in the War Office narrative put the total Zulu losses of dead and wounded at \"nearly 2,000\". The Zulus thought that their casualties were at least as high or higher than those suffered at Isandlwana. The British suffered casualties of 18 British soldiers killed, 8 officers and 57 men wounded, 11 of whom later died.

He considers there was no military value to the engagement as Sihayo's warriors had already left the kraal to assemble with the main army and could not threaten Chelmsford's supply lines.  Greaves thinks the action may have given Chelmsford false confidence that the Zulu would run from future engagements.  Ian Knight considers that Chelmsford took the wrong lesson from the action, rather than noting the determination of the Zulu to hold their ground and the courage of their leaders (Mkumbikazulu having been killed leading his men), he focussed on the ease with which the Zulu had been defeated in a one-sided engagement.
