After he and Effie moved to Annat Lodge, close to Bowerswell, she was readily available for this purpose, but while it seems she was beginning to displace Effie herself as a favored subject, it is unsurprising that Effie wanted to keep herself out of the public eye to a degree, following the very public dissolution of her marriage.  In the words of art historian Suzanne Fagence Cooper, whose biographical chapter about Gray (2010) provides the fullest account of her life, Gray \"changes before our eyes from a child to a stunning teenager.\" This change can be traced in three works by Millais: Autumn Leaves (1855\u201356), Spring (or Apple Blossoms) (1856\u20131859) and, most strikingly, in a small, but \"unnerving\" portrait of her at the age of 13, entitled Portrait of a Young Lady, or simply Sophie Gray (1857).Tate Britain, Millais, 2007, pp.134-135 Charles Edward Perugini also painted a portrait of Gray as a young woman; the date is not known with certainty and for some years it was attributed mistakenly to Millais.http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=5089471 "]}, {"page": "December 1918", "response": ["* Died: Charles Edward Perugini, Italian-British painter, known for works including A Girl Reading and A Summer Shower (b. 1839)"]}, {"page": "Henry Woods (painter)", "response": ["By 1871 Woods and Luke Fildes were lodging together in Finsbury, London, and later at 22 King Henry's Road, Haverstock Hill, where each had a studio.
