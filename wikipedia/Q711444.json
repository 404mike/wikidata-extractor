The game was played at the Victoria Ground on 28 April 1965, by which time Matthews had decided to retire as a player, and the pre-match entertainment consisted of another match of two veteran teams featuring many legends of the game. Harry Johnston led out a team consisting of Bert Trautmann, Tim Ward, George Hardwick, Jimmy Hill, Neil Franklin, Don Revie, Stan Mortensen, Nat Lofthouse, Jimmy Hagan, Tom Finney and Frank Bowyer (reserve). Walley Barnes led out an opposing team consisting of Jimmy O'Neill, Jimmy Scoular, Danny Blanchflower, Jimmy Dickinson, Hughie Kelly, Bill McGarry, Jackie Mudie, Jackie Milburn, Jock Dodds, Ken Barnes, and Arthur Rowley (reserve)."]}, {"page": "Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano", "response": ["After the Superga air disaster, in May 1949, a friendly match between River Plate and Grande Torino was played and Di St\u00e9fano was promised to the Granata. However the Argentine forward was soon after contacted by Adolfo Pedernera, who had already agreed to terms with the Colombian Bogota-based club Millonarios F.C. On 9 August 1949, after another one of his teammates, N\u00e9stor Rossi signed for the Colombian club without River Plate receiving any compensation for the transfer. Di St\u00e9fano signed with the Colombians. Millonarios, who could not afford to pay the transfer fees anyhow, offered him a salary clearly higher than that at River Plate, and the Argentine forward started a new chapter in his career in Colombia, in period called El Dorado. Many international stars like the Hungarians B\u00e9la S\u00e1rosi, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Sz\u0151ke, Lithuanian Vytautas Kri\u0161\u010di\u016bnas, the Argentines Ren\u00e9 Pontoni, H\u00e9ctor Rial, English Charlie Mitten from Manchester United for 5.000 pounds a year, Neil Franklin from Stoke City, French-Hungarian Ferenc Nyers, Italian Luigi Di Franco, the Brazilian legend Heleno de Freitas, and others had joined the league after legendary Perdenera first signed."]}]}}
