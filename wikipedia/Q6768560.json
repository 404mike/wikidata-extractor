His first season signings included Mark Leonard from Tranmere Rovers, John Crabbe from Hereford United and David Pullar from Exeter City as Gradi looked to build an academy structure to develop players that could be sold to help fund the player development programme. Among his first transfer successes were Dave Waller (sold to Shrewsbury Town), Gary Blissett (sold to Brentford) and Geoff Thomas (sold to Crystal Palace); gradually the club moved forward."]}, {"page": "Mark Leonard", "response": ["Mark Leonard may refer to:", "* Mark Leonard (baseball) (born 1964), Major League Baseball outfielder", "* Mark Leonard (footballer) (born 1962), English footballer", "* Mark Leonard, charged in Richmond Hill explosion", "* Mark Leonard (director) (born 1974), founder of the European Council on Foreign Relations"]}, {"page": "List of Bradford City A.F.C. players", "response": ["|Mark Leonard||||1986\u20131992||157||29||"]}, {"page": "Leonard", "response": ["* Mark Leonard (footballer), association football"]}, {"page": "List of Bradford City A.F.C. seasons", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Mark Leonard", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Mark LeonardJimmy Quinn"]}, {"page": "1987\u201388 Bradford City A.F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Mark Leonard"]}, {"page": "1993\u201394 Chester City F.C. season", "response": ["||| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Mark Leonard"]}, {"page": "List of Rochdale A.F.C. players (25\u201399 appearances)", "response": ["|Mark Leonard"]}]}}
