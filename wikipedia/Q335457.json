Upon reading it, James immediately seized upon the word \"blow\" and felt that it hinted at \"some strategem of fire and powder\", perhaps an explosion exceeding in violence the one that killed his father, Lord Darnley, at Kirk o' Field in 1567. Keen not to seem too intriguing, and wanting to allow the King to take the credit for unveiling the conspiracy, Salisbury feigned ignorance. The following day members of the Privy Council visited the King at the Palace of Whitehall and informed him that, based on the information that Salisbury had given them a week earlier, on Monday the Lord Chamberlain Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk would undertake a search of the Houses of Parliament, \"both above and below\". On Sunday 3 November Percy, Catesby and Wintour had a final meeting, where Percy told his colleagues that they should \"abide the uttermost triall\", and reminded them of their ship waiting at anchor on the Thames. By 4 November Digby was ensconced with a \"hunting party\" at Dunchurch, ready to abduct Elizabeth. The same day, Percy visited the Earl of Northumberland\u2014who was uninvolved in the conspiracy\u2014to see if he could discern what rumours surrounded the letter to Monteagle. Percy returned to London and assured Wintour, John Wright, and Robert Keyes that they had nothing to be concerned about, and returned to his lodgings on Gray's Inn Road. That same evening Catesby, likely accompanied by John Wright and Bates, set off for the Midlands. Fawkes visited Keyes, and was given a pocket watch left by Percy, to time the fuse, and an hour later Rookwood received several engraved swords from a local cutler."]}, {"page": "May 28", "response": ["*1626 \u2013 Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk (b. 1561)"]}, {"page": "1626", "response": ["* May 28 \u2013 Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk (b. 1561)"]}, {"page": "1561", "response": ["** Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk (d. 1626)"]}, {"page": "Thomas Howard", "response": ["*Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Berkshire (1587\u20131669), second son of Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk and Catherine Knyvet", "*Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk (1561\u20131626), son of Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk by his second wife Margaret Audley"]}, {"page": "Edward Coke", "response": ["During the 1580s, Coke became intimately linked with the Howard family, the Dukes of Norfolk and Earls of Arundel.

His power base was his household, particularly the network of lawyers and stewards who held his estates together. Coke's uncle Thomas Gawdy had served as Steward to the Third Duke of Norfolk, and during the 1580s Coke was employed by the Howards to counter lawyers employed by the Crown, who argued that the Howards' lands were forfeit owing to the treason of the 4th Duke. As well as defeating these direct attacks Coke traveled to Cardiff to answer a challenge by Francis Dacre, son of William Dacre, 3rd Baron Dacre and uncle-in-law to the 4th Duke's three sons, Philip Howard and his two half-brothers, Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk and Lord William Howard\u00a0\u2013 he proved that Dacre's evidence was false and had the case dismissed."]}, {"page": "Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk", "response": ["* Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk;"]}, {"page": "List of Lord High Treasurers of England and Great Britain", "response": ["**Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk ", "*Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk (11 July 1614 \u2013 1618)"]}]}}
