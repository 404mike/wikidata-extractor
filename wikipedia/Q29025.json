He created the original theme music after having discussions with Gard about the character of Lara Croft. Having decided to use Classical English music as an inspiration, he decided to create something simple for the theme song. Its simplicity made rearrangements and orchestrations easy. For his work on the first three Tomb Raider games, he was given fairly minimal briefs, and for Tomb Raider III he was working on the game as a freelancer as he had left the company. For The Last Revelation, Peter Connelly replaced Nathan McCree as the main composer, using McCree's music as a basis for his work. He composed the opening theme for The Last Revelation, saying that the opening melody came to him out of the blue, and added Egyptian motifs to fit in with the game's setting. Chronicles was originally going to have a sizeable original opening theme, but due to time constraints the majority of it ended up being discarded, much to Connelly's later regret. Only the opening segment survived. The music for The Angel of Darkness, composed by Connelly and Martin Iveson, was the one element of production that did not encounter problems, as recording was finished before the major content cuts happened. Scored using a full orchestra as opposed to the synthesised instruments of previous titles, it was performed by the London Symphony Orchestra."]}, {"page": "List of film score composers", "response": ["* Peter Connelly (born 1972)Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness, Flesh Feast, Mass Destruction"]}, {"page": "List of video game musicians", "response": ["*Peter Connelly \u2013 Three games from the Tomb Raider series"]}, {"page": "Herdy Gerdy", "response": ["Category:Video games scored by Peter Connelly"]}, {"page": "Tomb Raider Chronicles", "response": ["The music was composed by Peter Connelly, who returned from The Last Revelation. As with other his other projects, Connelly used early level builds as inspiration for his compositions. Taking inspiration from the narrative's gloomy tone, Chronicles used a darker musical style while retaining established Tomb Raider musical motifs. The main theme is very short compared to earlier Tomb Raider games, but Connelly had wanted something \"epic\".

Due to the strain of developing Tomb Raider titles non-stop since 1996, and general fatigue with the character, the Core Design staff wrote the narrative to end with Lara's death.

He drew inspiration from the original Tomb Raider scores created by Nathan McCree, in addition to the music of John Williams, Danny Elfman and Hans Zimmer. The main theme \"kind of just came to [him]\", with the opening harp motif appearing first. Due to the game's location, Connelly wrote it to have Egyptian-style themes and motifs. He used early level designs and story drafts as inspiration for his themes. Connelly reused a piece he had written for Tomb Raider III, the final boss theme that did not make it onto the disc due to time constraints, in The Last Revelation.

The soundtrack, compared to earlier entries in the franchise, was far more orchestral. It was also one of the few areas of the game's development that did not suffer setbacks or similar problems. It was known from the start that the score would be performed by the London Symphony Orchestra so it was written with that in mind. The music was recorded in a very short time, meaning the team did not get many retake opportunities. Connelly later referred to the game's main theme as his masterpiece. The track \"Dance of the Lux Veritatis\" was left out of the game due to both quality concerns and having no scenes to match it. The score was recorded live by the London Symphony Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios, London, in 2002. It was orchestrated by Peter Wraight and conducted by David Snell. The orchestra had no time for rehearsals, performing them for the first time when they were being recorded. Angel of Darkness was described by Connelly as his \"the most exciting project to work on\" due to working with the London Symphony Orchestra. The Europe-exclusive 'Collector's Edition' of the game included eight tracks from the game's soundtrack on the bonus documentary DVD.
