(Other possible precursors are Monmouthshire-born Arthur Machen (1863\u20131947), and Joseph Keating (1871\u20131934), who began his working life as a South Wales miner.) However, many see the Carmarthenshire-born satirical short-story writer and novelist Caradoc Evans (1878\u20131945) as the first\u2014or first modern\u2014Welsh writer in English. His short-story collections My People (1915) and Capel Sion (1916) were highly controversial, and Roland Mathias bitterly comments that \"No other Anglo-Welsh prose writer. .. displayed such ill will to Wales or to Welsh people\".Anglo-Welsh Literature, p.82. W. H. Davies (1871\u20131940), born in Newport, became famous principally for his The Autobiography of a Super-Tramp which was set mostly in North America. The principal themes in his work are observations about life's hardships, the ways in which the human condition is reflected in nature, his own tramping adventures and the various characters he met. In his poetry he was particularly inspired by birds, the weather and the seasons. His prose works were nearly all autobiographical and were sometimes, as with his 1918 \"A Poet's Pilgrimage (or A Pilgrimage In Wales)\", set in his homeland. (See also Gerard Manley Hopkins (1844\u201389), Edward Thomas (1878\u20131917) and Joseph Keating (1871\u20131934).)", "Amongst these was Swansea suburbanite Dylan Thomas (1914\u201353), whose first collection, 18 Poems, was published in 1934. Then there is Geraint Goodwin (1903\u201341) from Newtown in mid-Wales, who, in such works as the novel The Heyday in the Blood (1936), wrote about declining rural communities in the border region. David Jones (1895\u20131974), whose father was from North Wales, was born in a London suburb. His epic poem In Parenthesis, which deals with his World War I experiences, was published in 1937. Another Swansea poet Vernon Watkins (1906\u201367) likewise does not belong with the main group of writers of the so-called First Wave from the South Wales mining communities.
