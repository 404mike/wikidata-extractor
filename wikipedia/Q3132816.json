His career took him all over the world, particularly on the North American station and in the West Indies where he commanded numerous ships and, later in his career, squadrons during the course of three different wars.

On 17 August the squadron forced the surrender of a Dutch expeditionary force in the Capitulation of Saldanha Bay. Wilson and Bellona then continued their attacks on privateers, taking the French 6-gun La Legere off Cape Descada on 7 January 1797 and destroying another three days later. Wilson then took part in the successful Invasion of Trinidad in February and in April similarly participated in the unsuccessful Invasion of Porto Rico. In the former invasion Wilson assisted with the other ships of the line of Rear-Admiral Henry Harvey's fleet in destroying a Spanish squadron of four ships of the line and a frigate before the main invasion force of Lieutenant-General Sir Ralph Abercromby landed. Towards the end of 1797 Wilson was sent back to England in Bellona where he re-joined the Channel Fleet.Marshall, Royal Naval Biography, p. 113."]}]}}
