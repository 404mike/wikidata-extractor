He was one of the old style farmers, locally well known, and spent much of his life farming a mixed arable and livestock business at Hartburn, near Morpeth, Northumberland.\nHe began his artistic work of drawings, sketches, cartoons etc. in the 1970s and these together with his writings became very popular, and featured regularly in the farming magazines, particularly the West Cumberland Farmers Journal, regional NFU journals and Livestock Farming.\nHis book, Funnywayt'mekalivin' was a great success at the 1983 Smithfield Show with Henry Brewis in great demand to sign copies of the book.\nHe eventually sold his property on a lease-back arrangement so that he could spend more time on his side-line which by now had developed into a not so small local industry with the addition of greetings cards, decorated beer mugs and Tee shirts etc., audio tapes and prints of his cartoons. He had by this time even converted a byre into a studio.\nHenry Brewis died in 2000 leaving three children and two grandchildren.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Brewis", "response": ["*Henry Brewis (1932\u20132000), English artist and poet"]}, {"page": "List of Geordie songwriters", "response": ["* Henry Brewis - poet, writer, cartoonist, illustrator"]}, {"page": "Robert Allen (poet)", "response": ["He then produced three audio tapes of his poems \"The Canniest Place on Earth\", \"Ridin' High\" and \"The Lang Pack\", and eventually, in 1994, he published the whole in a book Canny Bit Verse, illustrated by local poet/illustrator and neighbouring farmer Henry Brewis.", "*Henry Brewis"]}, {"page": "Canny Bit Verse", "response": ["The 128 page book is illustrated by local writer and artist Henry Brewis."]}, {"page": "Henry Brewis (artist)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Henry Brewis"]}]}}
