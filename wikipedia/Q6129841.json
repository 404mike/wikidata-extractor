In the 1950s, Lead Belly's prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Fred Gerlach, brought the instrument into the American folk music world. Initially, it was primarily used for accompaniment, owing to the greater difficulty of picking or executing string \"bends\" on its double-strung courses. The Delta Blues guitar virtuoso Robert Lockwood Jr was presented a handcrafted acoustic 12-string guitar made by an outstanding Japanese luthier in the end of the sixties, and this became the instrument of choice for Lockwood thereafter. In the later 20th century, however, a number of players devoted themselves to producing solo performances on the 12-string guitar, including Leo Kottke, Peter Lang, John McLaughlin, Larry Coryell, Ralph Towner, Robbie Basho, Jack Rose, and James Blackshaw."]}, {"page": "Young God Records", "response": ["* James Blackshaw"]}, {"page": "The Cloud of Unknowing", "response": ["* James Blackshaw released an album in 2007 by the same name"]}, {"page": "Davenport Family (band)", "response": ["*Split w/ James Blackshaw \u2014 CDR (Static Records)"]}, {"page": "Ashtray Navigations", "response": ["Whilst the music evades easy categorisation due to variations in sound, approach and personnel, it often incorporates extended droning and lengthy guitar pieces.

Bill Meyer of Chicago Reader called it \"a distillation of everything great about Basho's mature work. His acoustic fingerpicking is thrillingly propulsive, full of quicksilver changes in direction, but he never gets lost in it.\" He found his \"ululating, hyperemotional singing\" as \"the perfect vehicle for his shamelessly ardent pledges of love to nature\" and noted his \"beatific vision of America whose fever-dream romanticism fit so poorly with the rest of the label's catalog that it went out of print in a flash and stayed that way for more than three decades.\" Grayson Haver Currin of Pitchfork characterized Basho's singing as inaccessible, writing that it \"generally wasn\u2019t what you\u2019d call pretty or subtle. During \u201cNight Way\u201d [...] he obscures the wonderful ribbons of his six-string guitar with singing generously described as zealous. He wails a ceremonial Navajo chant, his voice locking into and falling from falsetto, its vibrato smearing the track with warble. [...] These aren\u2019t songs you'd really put on during a party or in a mix for a love interest.\" He concludes: \"His music is, at first, rather off-putting, but ultimately, he imagined modes for the guitar and composition that we\u2019re still reconciling. Marnie Stern sometimes maneuvers against her instrument in the same way, and James Blackshaw explores the same nebulous majesty. But Robbie Basho\u2019s music mostly remains a pan-everything oddball, and Visions of the Country is, at last, once again living proof.\" The general inaccessibility of the music was again echoed by Spectrum Culture's Mike Randall, who wrote that \"his use of obscure modes and his chant-like voice (almost a cross between Antony and Israel Kamakawiwo\u2019ole) tends to skirt any sort of beaten path.\" \"The adventure these songs bring, however,\" he writes, \"makes it worthy of a left-of-center trip\". \"Leveraging the raga style of Hindu music, Basho successfully used his guitar to visualize the wilderness, sketching the running of water, the ferocity of a charging animal, the reach and power of a mountain.\" Comparisons to Hindustani classical music were also made by Rob Caldwell of Popmatters, who called it the \"quintessential Robbie Basho album, containing dazzling instrumental guitar flights as well as songs featuring his operatic singing and whistling (yes, whistling).\" Of the latter, he characterized the whistling on \u201cLeaf in the Wind\u201d as \"haunting\". \"Basho turns a suite about the American West into a courtly romance;\" wrote John Mulvey for Uncut, \"imagine John Renbourn drawing on Native American myth rather than old English legend, perhaps.\" He found echoes of Tim Buckley in his voice, \"especially\" on \"Blue Crystal Fire\". \"Of all the guitarists associated with the Takoma School, it\u2019s hard to think of one who imbued folk music with quite as much mystical portent as Robbie Basho.\""]}]}}
