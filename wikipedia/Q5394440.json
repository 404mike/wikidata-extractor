As a converted centre, at 5\u00a0ft 11 in. (1.8 m) he was much taller than was usual for the position, and his unusually long arms helped to make him a master of the \u2018dummy\u2019 pass. He was known for the unflappable way he distributed the ball, and his unrivalled ability to read a game. His natural ability is rendered all the more extraordinary when one considers that for almost all of his international career he was not playing club football due to his work commitments. A measure of his stature is that in 1987 he and his half-back partner Eugene Davy were the inaugural members of the Irish Rugby Writers Hall of Fame. In 1926 he was a key part of a back line that many regard as the finest ever to play for Ireland, with himself and Davy at half-back, Denis Cussen and Tom Hewitt on the wings, George Stephenson (qv) and Tom Hewitt's brother Frank in the centre, and Ernie Crawford at full-back."]}, {"page": "Lansdowne Football Club", "response": ["* Ernie Crawford"]}, {"page": "Ireland at the 1924 Summer Olympics", "response": ["*Ernie Crawford (Bohemians)"]}, {"page": "List of Ireland national rugby union players", "response": ["|Ernie Crawford"]}]}}
