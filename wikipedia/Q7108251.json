He was also a poet and wrote in non-fiction areas including travel, cooking and pets. His pseudonym combined a reference to the writer Osbert Sitwell with his mother's maiden name.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Austin Osman Spare", "response": ["Spare held exhibitions of his work at the St. George's Gallery in Hanover Square in 1927, and then at the Lefevre Gallery in 1929, but his work received little praise in the press or attention from the public.Baker 2011. pp. 157\u2013158. Two major supporters of Spare died around this time, in the form of his father in 1928, and then his primary patron Pickford Waller in 1930, although at his 1927 exhibit (titled \"The Journey of the Soul Through Death to Rebirth\") he did gain an important new patron and friend in the form of journalist Hannen Swaffer.Baker 2011. pp. 157, 160. Living in poverty and with his work becoming unpopular in the mainstream London art scene, Spare contemplated suicide.Baker 2011. p. 160. He then undertook a series of anamorphic portraits, predominantly of young women, which he termed the \"Experiments in Reality\". Influenced by the work of El Greco, they were exhibited at the Godfrey Phillips Galleries in St James's, Central London in November 1930, an exhibit that proved to be Spare's last in London's West End.Baker 2011. pp. 162\u2013164. In 1932, he moved into a flat at 148 York Road, Waterloo, from where he would hold art shows that had been co-organised by G.S. Sandilands of the Royal College of Art. He proceeded to move to Lambeth for a while, and then in 1936 to Elephant and Castle, a poverty-stricken working class area of South London, where he set up his home in the flat at 56a Walworth Road, situated above the loading bay of a Woolworth's store.Baker 2011. pp. 165\u2013166. He would often be visited at his flat by friends and people interested in purchasing his work, and formed friendships with both Dennis Bardens, whom he had met through Victor Neuberg, Oswell Blakeston and Frank Letchford.Baker 2011. pp. 167\u2013170, 180\u2013181."]}, {"page": "M.

His themes included boys bathing, sunbathing, posing with pansies and possibly boy prostitutes on a \"Saturday afternoon\" in Artwork (1924, I, p.\u00a075). He is one of the few modernist artists to use abstraction to express the essentials of male beauty in simplified forms like his painting of \"Ganymede\" or by contrasts of black and white as in \"Drawing\" (1922). As Candela has speculated, he may also be the creator of the photomontages that he published in Ray (pp.\u00a02, 15 and 27), as by the otherwise unknown P. Capeli. His work as a pioneer of British modernism and as an abstract gay artist deserves much more reassessment."]}, {"page": "Close Up (magazine)", "response": ["Close Up was an influential literary magazine devoted to film, published by the Pool Group between 1927 and 1933. \"It was the brain child of Kenneth Macpherson, a young man of independent means, not a little talent, and quite a lot of personal charm\".
