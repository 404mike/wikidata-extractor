He was again nominated for the League Two Manager of the Month, with the EFL writing that \"Slow and steady has been Vale's progress under Askey's astute management this season.

A hamstring problem caused him to miss the first month of the 2019\u201320 season, and he eventually made his debut for the \"Valiants\" on 14 September, replacing Callum Evans 35 minutes into a 1\u20130 win over Plymouth Argyle at Vale Park; ironically Evans was taken off due to a hamstring injury, as was winger David Amoo, leaving Browne with an opportunity to stake a first-team place in their absence. He scored his first goal for the club in an EFL Trophy tie against Mansfield Town on 3 December. After the game Askey commented that Browne \"has a tendency to be lazy\" but \"has got a lot of ability [and] if he is confident then he can play at a high level\". Speaking in February, first-team coach Danny Pugh said that \"he has done exceptionally well in the last couple of games... [though] it has been a frustrating season [for him and] maybe he has not played as much as he would have liked\". He signed a new one-year contract after he ended the campaign with one goals in 15 appearances. On 29 August 2020, Browne left Port Vale having had his contract terminated at his request.

After a public vote held in December 2019, he was named by The Sentinel as Port Vale's second-best right-back of the 2010s with 27% of the vote, behind Adam Yates (62%) and ahead of Ben Purkiss (11%). On 14 January, he scored his first goal in professional football during a 2\u20131 defeat at Morecambe.

Though the budget was reduced he aimed to have a smaller and more competitive squad. His first summer signing was midfielder Scott Burgess, released from Bury despite an impressive loan spell at York City; the 21-year-old had previously played on loan at Macclesfield Town in Askey's National League title winning season. He next signed Adam Crookes, a 21-year-old defender who had been released by Nottingham Forest despite impressing whilst on loan at Vale in the second half of the 2018\u201319 season. He then signed 25-year-old Kieran Kennedy, \"a footballing centre-half\" who turned down a new deal at Wrexham in order to return to the English Football League. Big target man striker Richie Bennett then joined, having been let go by Carlisle United. The signings of 27-year-old former Blackpool striker Mark Cullen and 25-year-old former youth-team midfielder Ryan Lloyd were confirmed on 26 June. On 8 July, winger David Amoo arrived on a one-year deal after rejecting a new contract with Cambridge United; this was the first signing to meet Askey's priorities of bringing in a winger, a right-back and a backup goalkeeper. Askey also evaluated five trialists in pre-season friendlies: 19-year-old Bradford (Park Avenue) midfielder Alex Hurst, former Darlington goalkeeper Jonny Maddison, former Millwall and Reading right-back Shaun Cummings, former Yeovil Town winger Rhys Browne and former Coventry City striker Kwame Thomas. Cummings left without a contract as Askey instead again signed another of his former Macclesfield Town players, 23-year-old Callum Evans, who \u2013 like Lloyd \u2013 had been released by Macclesfield boss Sol Campbell. Bookmakers predicted a mid-table finish for the club. The club kit was reverted to Erre\u00e0 manufacturers and the shirt sponsors were revealed as Synectics Solutions, the company owned by chairpersons Carol and Kevin Shanahan. The black and gold away kit was launched in tribute to the protestors who helped to oust Smurthwaite. As pre-season drew to a close the club took a week long trip to Scotland. Trialist winger Rhys Browne, yet another former Macclesfield player, became the ninth summer signing on the day of the club's final pre-season friendly. Signing number ten was the new back-up goalkeeper, 24-year-old Jonny Maddison, who had impressed on trial. A third of the five trialists was also signed, though Alex Hurst was immediately loaned back to Bradford (Park Avenue) in order to gain match experience.", "On 15 May, League Two clubs voted to end the season after 37 games, causing Vale to finish one place outside the play-offs; CEO Colin Garlick said that the club had voted for the proposal despite meaning they narrowly would miss out on the play-offs as it would help to secure the financial future of all the clubs in the division. A BBC Sport study with Professor James Reade and Dr Carl Singleton from the Economics Department at the University of Reading predicted that Vale would have finished seventh if the season had played out. Askey confirmed that eight players would be offered new contracts \u2013 Luke Joyce, David Amoo, Rhys Browne, Shaun Brisley, Cristian Monta\u00f1o, Tom Conlon, Mark Cullen and Nathan Smith \u2013 whilst six players would be released: Will Atkinson, Kieran Kennedy, Callum Evans, Ryan Lloyd, Jonny Maddison and Jordan McFarlane-Archer.", "|align=\"left\"|DF||18||align=\"left\"| Callum Evans", "| 20 July 2019 || DM ||  || Callum Evans || Macclesfield Town || Free transfer || ", "| 19 May 2020 || DM ||  || Callum Evans || Bath City || Released || "]}, {"page": "2019\u201320 Macclesfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["| 20 July 2019 || DM ||  || Callum Evans ||  Port Vale || Mutual consent || "]}]}}
