Eric and sometimes Ernie would often call an invited guest by the wrong name. So Andr\u00e9 Previn was \"Andrew Preview\", Ian Carmichael was Hoagy Carmichael, Elton John was Elephant John, Vanessa Redgrave was \"Vanilla Redgrave\" and when The Beatles appeared, Ringo Starr was \"Bongo\". Alternatively, one or both would seem not to recognise the famous guest artist at all. The pair would frequently make fun of their old friend, the singer and entertainer Des O'Connor in various disparaging ways.Sellers & Hogg.  A rhyming example was: \"If you want me to be a goner, get me an LP by Des O'Connor\". Another typical example was \"There's only one thing wrong with Des O'Connor records. The hole in the middle isn't big enough\". O'Connor actually appeared in the 1975 Christmas special and eavesdropped on these insults before Eric and Ernie noticed him.", "Another concept of the shows during the Braben era was Ernie's utterly confident presentation of amateurishly inept plays \"wot I wrote\". This allowed for another kind of sketch: the staged historical drama, which usually parodied genuine historical television plays or films (such as Stalag 17, Antony and Cleopatra, or Napoleon and Josephine). Wise's character would write a play, complete with cheap props, shaky scenery and appallingly clumsy writing (\"the play what I wrote\" became a catchphrase), which would then be acted out by Morecambe, Wise and the show's guest star. Guests who participated included many big names of the 1970s and 1980s, such as Dame Flora Robson, Penelope Keith, Laurence Olivier, Sir John Mills, Vanessa Redgrave, Eric Porter, Peter Cushing (who in a running gag would keep turning up to complain that he had not been paid for an earlier appearance) and Frank Finlay\u2014as well as Glenda Jackson (as Cleopatra: \"All men are fools. And what makes them so is having beauty like what I have got...\"). Jackson had not previously been known as a comedian and this appearance led to her Oscar-winning role in A Touch of Class. Morecambe and Wise would often pretend not to have heard of their guest, or would appear to confuse them with someone else (former UK Prime Minister Harold Wilson returned the favour, when appearing as a guest at the duo's flat, by referring to Morecambe as \"Mor-e-cam-by\"). Also noteworthy was the occasion when the respected BBC newsreader Angela Rippon was induced to show her legs in a dance number (she had trained as a ballet dancer before she became a journalist and TV presenter). Braben later said that a large amount of the duo's humour was based on irreverence. A running gag in a number of shows was a short sequence showing a well-known artist in close-up saying \"I appeared in an Ernie Wise play, and look what happened to me!\". The camera would then pull back and show the artist doing some low-status job such as newspaper seller (Ian Carmichael), Underground guard (Fenella Fielding), dustman (Eric Porter), bus conductor (Andr\u00e9 Previn), or some other ill-paid employment. However, celebrities felt they had received the highest accolade in showbusiness by being invited to appear in \"an Ernest Wide play\" as Ernie once mispronounced it during a show's introduction involving \"Vanilla\" (Vanessa) Redgrave."]}, {"page": "Wives and Daughters", "response": ["In 1999, BBC produced a four-part serial based on the novel with a screenplay written by Andrew Davies;  Wives and Daughters featuring Justine Waddell, Bill Paterson, Francesca Annis, Keeley Hawes, Rosamund Pike, Tom Hollander, Anthony Howell, Michael Gambon, Penelope Wilton, Barbara Flynn, Deborah Findlay, Iain Glen, Barbara Leigh-Hunt, and Ian Carmichael."]}, {"page": "Ian Charmical", "response": ["#REDIRECT Ian Carmichael"]}, {"page": "Terry-Thomas", "response": ["In February 1956 Terry-Thomas appeared on Desert Island Discs, and chose two songs from his \"Technical Hitch\" routine as part of his selection. Later that year he appeared in his first major film roles: Charles Boughtflower in The Green Man, and Major Hitchcock, \"a charlatan military officer on the take\", in Private's Progress, directed by the Boulting brothers. Terry-Thomas appeared in the latter film only briefly, with a total screen time of about ten minutes, but his biographer Graham McCann thought the actor \"came close to stealing the show from the central character\", Windrush played by Ian Carmichael. Terry-Thomas's depiction of the character was not how he wished to play it: his desired choice was that of a \"silly-ass\" sergeant major, but the role was written as a strict, alcohol and prescription drug-dependent Army officer. He was initially disappointed with the role, and turned it down but, after being persuaded to accept it by his agent, he embraced its possibilities. One of his lines, delivered in his clipped upper class voice, was \"You're an absolute shower\", which became a catchphrase for him. The Boulting brothers were so impressed with Terry-Thomas's performance that they signed him up to a five-film deal.", "The first of the five films was Brothers in Law, in which Terry-Thomas played the spiv Alfred Green, a performance which was based on Sid Field's characterisation in Piccadilly Hayride. Roy Boulting later recounted that one short scene with Terry-Thomas, Richard Attenborough and Ian Carmichael took 107\u00a0takes because of Terry-Thomas's unfamiliarity with filming techniques; he initially struggled to hit his marks, or give his line and move on, while still acting. Filming the scene took two days and Boulting described it as a \"unique experience for him, and had a wonderful after-effect\". Following Brothers in Law he was cast as Romney Carlton-Ricketts in Blue Murder at St Trinian's by producers Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliat, before again appearing for the Boulting brothers in the cameo role of a local policeman in Happy Is the Bride. Terry-Thomas starred in two further films in 1957. The first was as Bertrand Welch in Lucky Jim, an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Kingsley Amis. Although Amis thought Terry-Thomas has been \"totally miscast as Bertrand, the posturing painter and leading shit\" of the book, the critic for The Manchester Guardian considered Terry-Thomas as being \"the nearest to a complete success\" in the film, in a portrayal that \"suggests possibilities for more serious roles\". His final part of 1957 was Lord Henry Mayley in The Naked Truth; this brought him together with Peter Sellers for the first time, and the two of them appeared frequently together over the next few years in scenes in which, Graham McCann considered that each actor's performance \"highlight[ed] what was special about the other\". During one scene Terry-Thomas was dumped in a near-freezing lake, and his health was affected for some time afterwards.", "In 1960 Terry-Thomas appeared as Raymond Delauney in School for Scoundrels, a film his biographer, Robert Ross, called \"the definitive screen presentation of his frightfully well-mannered, well-read and well-educated lounge lizard: T-T the man as T-T the film star\". He again appeared opposite Ian Carmichael, and they were joined by Alastair Sim and Janette Scott. Michael Brooke, writing for the British Film Institute, thought Terry-Thomas was \"outstanding as a classic British bounder\". CNN would list the performance among the top 10 British villains, stating, \"generally found twirling his cigarette holder while charming the ladies \u2014 at least, when not swindling, cheating or behaving like an absolute rotter.\"\"The Screening Room's Top 10 British Villains\" , CNN.
