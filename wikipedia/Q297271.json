He is England's fifth-highest international goalscorer (44 goals), Tottenham Hotspur's highest ever goalscorer (266 goals), the highest goalscorer in the history of English top-flight football (357 goals), and also scored more hat-tricks (six) for England than anyone else. He finished as the First Division's top scorer in six seasons. He is also a member of the English Football Hall of Fame.\nGreaves began his professional career at Chelsea in 1957, and played in the following year's FA Youth Cup final. He scored 124 First Division goals in just four seasons before being sold on to Italian club A.C. Milan for \u00a380,000 in April 1961. His stay in Italy was not a happy one and he returned to England with Tottenham Hotspur for a fee of \u00a399,999 in December 1961. Whilst with Spurs he won the FA Cup in 1961\u201362 and 1966\u201367, the Charity Shield in 1962 and 1967, and the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1962\u201363; he never won a league title but did help Spurs to a second-place finish in 1962\u201363. He moved to West Ham United in a player-exchange in March 1970 and retired the following year. After a four-year absence he returned to football at the non-league level, despite suffering from alcoholism. In a five-year spell he played for Brentwood, Chelmsford City, Barnet, and Woodford Town before retiring for good in 1980.\nGreaves scored 13 goals in 12 England under-23 internationals and scored 44 goals in 57 full England internationals between 1959 and 1967. He played in the 1962 and 1966 FIFA World Cup, but was injured in the group stage of the 1966 World Cup and lost his first team place to Geoff Hurst, who kept Greaves out of the first team in the final. England won the World Cup, but Greaves was not given his medal until a change of FIFA rules in 2009. He was also part of the squad that finished third in UEFA Euro 1968, although he did not play any minute in the finals.\nAfter retiring as a player Greaves went on to enjoy a successful career in broadcasting, most notably working alongside Ian St John on Saint and Greavsie from 1985 to 1992. During this period, he also made regular appearances on TV-am. He worked on a number of other sport programmes on ITV during this period, including Sporting Triangles (1987\u20131990).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bobby Charlton", "response": ["His goals became a little less frequent, and indeed Jimmy Greaves, playing purely as a striker, overtook his England tally in October 1964. Nevertheless, Charlton was still scoring and creating freely, and as the tournament was about to start he was expected to become one of its stars and galvanise his established reputation as one of the world's best footballers.", "Weeks later he scored his 45th England goal in a friendly against Sweden, breaking the record of 44 set the previous year by Jimmy Greaves. He was then in the England team which made it to the semi-finals of the 1968 European Championships where they were knocked out by Yugoslavia in Florence. During the match Charlton struck a Yugoslav post.

Eight other players have also scored over 100 goals for Chelsea: George Hilsdon (1906\u20131912), George Mills (1929\u20131939), Roy Bentley (1948\u20131956), Jimmy Greaves (1957\u20131961), Peter Osgood (1964\u20131974 and 1978\u20131979), Kerry Dixon (1983\u20131992), Didier Drogba (2004\u20132012 and 2014\u20132015), and Eden Hazard (2012\u20132019).
