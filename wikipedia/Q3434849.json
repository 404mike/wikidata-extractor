The Royal Air Force was reluctant to risk landing on what they saw as an amateur airstrip at Glamoj (Glamo\u010d), although Slim Farish was in fact an airfield designer, and night air drops were sporadic.  The Royal Navy was approached, and they offered to bring supplies to an outlying island off the Dalmatian coast. Maclean and a couple of companions set off on foot for Kor\u010dula, being passed from guerilla group to guerilla group.  They passed through battle-scarred villages and towns that had changed hands many times, some so recently that corpses still lay on the ground: Bugojno and Livno and Ar\u017eano. Once, they were billeted with a landlady whose sympathies clearly did not lie with the Partisans; she would not sell them food, but there was no question of simply commandeering it. Eventually, after an all-night march across noisy stony ground, dodging German patrols as they crossed a major road, the little group reached Zadvarje, where they were greeted with astonishment as creatures  from another world \"as indeed in a sense we were\". After a few hours' sleep, they continued over the final range of hills to the coast, and down to Ba\u0161ka Voda, where a fishing boat took them circuitously to Kor\u010dula. There, all seemed in order for a Navy supply drop, but the wireless set developed problems. Maclean was on the point of  returning to Jajce when the motor launch arrived, with a crew that included Sandy Glen (also, like Maclean, thought to be one of the inspirations for James Bond) and David Satow.  By this point the enemy were closing in to take the remaining access points to the coast, which would throttle the Partisan supply route before it had even begun. He sent top priority requests, asking for air and sea support from Allied bases in Italy, and these took effect. Maclean decided he needed to discuss matters with Tito and then with Allied superiors in Cairo to argue for more resources to push the project forward, and accordingly made his way back to Partisan HQ in Jajce. He returned to the islands, first on Hvar and then on Vis, to wait for the response to his strongly worded signals. On Vis he discovered an overgrown British war cemetery dating from a naval victory over the French in 1811."]}, {"page": "1912 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 18 April \u2013 Sandy Glen, explorer (died 2004)"]}, {"page": "Alexander \"Sandy\" Glen", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sandy Glen"]}, {"page": "List of people educated at Fettes College", "response": ["* Sandy Glen, Arctic explorer and pioneer of the package holiday."]}, {"page": "Glen (surname)", "response": ["*Sandy Glen (1912\u20132004) Scottish explorer"]}, {"page": "1912 in Scotland", "response": ["* 18 April \u2013 Sir Sandy Glen, explorer of the Arctic and wartime intelligence officer (died 2004)"]}]}}
