He was educated at Rugby School, before going up to Brasenose College, Oxford. Crowder was a student of the Inner Temple, though it is uncertain whether he was ever called to the bar. While studying at Oxford, he did not play first-class cricket for Oxford University. Instead, his debut in first-class cricket came in 1873 for the Gentlemen of England against Oxford University at Oxford. The following year he made two further first-class appearances, playing one match each for the Marylebone Cricket Club against Oxford University, and for the Gentlemen of England against Cambridge University at Fenner's. In addition to playing cricket, Crowder also played tennis. He took part in the 1880 Wimbledon Championship, where he received a walkover to the second round following the withdrawal of William Hacon. He was defeated in straight sets by F. Durant in the second round. He died at Oxford in March 1938.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Old Rugbeians", "response": ["* Frederick Crowder (1845\u20131938), cricketer and tennis player"]}, {"page": "Frederick Crowder", "response": ["Frederick Crowder may refer to:", "* Frederick Crowder (cricketer, born 1798) (1798\u20131894), English cricketer", "* Frederick Crowder (cricketer, born 1845) (1845\u20131938), English cricketer and tennis player", "* Frederick Crowder (politician) (1850\u20131902), Western Australian politician"]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1864\u20131894)", "response": ["* Frederick Crowder (1874) : F.
