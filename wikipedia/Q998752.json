Walter Bahr had taken a shot from about 25 yards away and the ball was heading to goalkeeper Bert Williams's right. It appeared to be a relatively easy save, but Gaetjens dove headlong and grazed the ball enough that it went to the goalkeeper's left instead, with his momentum preventing him from stopping the ball. Williams later considered the goal to be a result of a lucky deflection, but this view was disputed by Laurie Hughes, who was defending Gaetjens on the play."]}, {"page": "England national football team records and statistics", "response": [": Laurie Hughes, 25 June 1950, 2\u20130 vs. ChileLaurie Hughes has an international record which is unlikely to be equalled \u2013 all of his England's games were at the World Cup finals.
