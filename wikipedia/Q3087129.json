At half time Wales were 7\u20130 down following tries from Frederick Lohden and Howard Marshall and a conversion from England captain Andrew Stoddart. The second half started poorly for Wales when Marshall scored a second try following excellent English forward pressure. The game turned not long after: the English forwards could not maintain the pace they had set in the first half of the game, and began to slow. Then Welsh forward Charles Nicholl broke through a line-out with the ball, transferred it to Hannan, who passed to Gould at the halfway line. Gould evaded both Alderson and Lockwood before outpacing Edwin Field to score beneath the posts. Bancroft converted. A near identical move resulted in Conway Rees then releasing Cardiff wing Norman Biggs who scored with a run from the half-way line, though this time the conversion missed."]}, {"page": "List of Old Dunelmians", "response": ["* Frederick Lohden OBE, England and Barbarians rugby footballer"]}, {"page": "List of England national rugby union players", "response": ["|252||Frederick Lohden||forward ||1893-01-07||v Wales at Cardiff"]}, {"page": "1895\u201396 Rugby Union County Championship", "response": ["| || Frederick Lohden || Blackheath"]}]}}
