Due to policy of the NAMPI Thirteen Points, the filmmakers of the 1923 film adaptation would not portray a member of the Roman Catholic Church in a negative and controversial light. As a result, Claude Frollo (played by Nigel de Brulier) is not the villain, but instead a good-hearted archdeacon of Notre Dame, and the villain of the film is actually his younger brother Jehan (played by Brandon Hurst). The 1939 film had a similar change for the same reason due to policy of the Hays Production Code; the only difference is that Jehan (played by Sir Cedric Hardwicke) is portrayed as King Louis XI's Chief Justice of Paris, and Claude (played by Walter Hampden) is portrayed as the Archbishop of Paris. In Disney's 1996 animated film, Claude Frollo (voiced by Tony Jay) is Paris' judge/Minister of Justice and the villain as in the novel, the Archdeacon of Notre Dame is a separate character entirely (and voiced by David Ogden Stiers), and the character of Jehan is omitted."]}, {"page": "The Adventures of Mark Twain (1944 film)", "response": ["* Brandon Hurst as Ralph Waldo Emerson (uncredited) "]}, {"page": "Kidnapped (1938 film)", "response": ["* Brandon Hurst as Doomster "]}, {"page": "Jane Eyre (1943 film)", "response": ["* Brandon Hurst as Trustee"]}, {"page": "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1920 Paramount film)", "response": ["Henry Jekyll (John Barrymore) is a doctor of medicine living and working in London in the late 1880s.
