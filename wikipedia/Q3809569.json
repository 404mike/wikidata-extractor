He developed a notable collection of Chinese drawings of animals and plants.\nReeves was the son of Reverend Jonathan Reeves of West Ham, Essex. Orphaned young, he was educated at Christ's Hospital and started working with a tea merchant. His knowledge of teas got him an appointment of inspector of tea in 1808. In 1812 he was sent to China in the employment of the British East India Company. He was responsible for the introduction of a number of garden plants to the West including Wisteria. Reeves was a correspondent of the Horticultural Society of London to which he sent specimens. He also corresponded with Sir Joseph Banks, regularly sending him specimens. Reeves also took an interest in Chinese astronomy and herbal medicine, collaborating on these with the missionary and sinologist Robert Morrison. Reeves' son John Russell Reeves joined the tea business in 1827 and also took an interest in natural history and like his father, he too was elected into the Linnean and Royal Societies. Reeves senior returned to live in Clapham in 1831.\nMany of Reeves' Chinese drawings are held in the Lindley Library at the Royal Horticultural Society. Reeves is commemorated in the names of Reeves's muntjac and Reeves's pheasant. Four species of reptiles are also named in his honor: Gekko reevesii, Leiolepis reevesii, Mauremys reevesii, and Scincella reevesii.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Reeves's muntjac", "response": ["Reeves's muntjac (Muntiacus reevesi; ), also known as the Chinese muntjac, is a muntjac species found widely in southeastern China (from Gansu to Yunnan) and Taiwan.

As a result the Bradby Blake drawings became the basis for a chain of influence in botanical art: the manual Banks commissioned was used by the botanist William Kerr, who would influence yet another botanical artist, John Reeves, who became known for his Chinese botanical art.
