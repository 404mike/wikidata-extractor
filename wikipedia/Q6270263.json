The ill-feeling towards Allen hit a new high in October 2006 after the sacking of popular manager Sturrock, with fans attributing a slump in form to the chairman's relationship with the manager and Allen's transfer policy rather than the performance of the manager; this then led to a series of protests by supporters aimed directly at the chairperson and board of directors. However, the appointment of caretaker manager Sean McAuley and his eventual successor Brian Laws did see an improvement in results.  Allen was sometimes the basis of much criticism from Wednesday fans, who he referred to as \"scum\", \"yobs\" and \"cretins\", also labelling one female fan a \"venomous bitch\" after she voiced her frustration at Allen as he sat in the directors box at Hillsborough Stadium."]}, {"page": "Stephen Dawson", "response": ["In the 2011\u201312 season, Dawson missed the opening game of the season, due to suffering from ankle injury, which he sustained in the club's pre-season tour. After returning, he made his first appearance of the season on 13 August 2011, in a 1\u20130 loss against Tranmere Rovers. However, after suffering another injury, Dawson continued to feature in the first team and wasn't until on 17 December 2011 when he scored, in a 2\u20131 win over Notts County. After the match, Dawson, along with teammate Scott Cuthbert, was named League One's Team of the Week for his display. In a 2\u20131 loss against Carlisle United on 7 January 2012, Dawson was substituted in the first half after a challenge from Jon-Paul McGovern, in what turned out to be his last appearance for Leyton Orient. After the match, it was announced that Dawson was sidelined for six weeks.
