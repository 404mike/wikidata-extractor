It was formed in January 1999 as a splinter party from the UK Unionist Party (UKUP). This split was caused by disagreement between the five UKUP members of the Northern Ireland Assembly. Four of the members disagreed with UKUP leader Robert McCartney's policy of resigning from the Assembly should Sinn F\u00e9in become part of the power-sharing executive. Cedric Wilson, Patrick Roche, Norman Boyd and Roger Hutchinson disagreed with McCartney, wanting to remain in the Assembly to challenge unionists in favour of the Belfast Agreement. McCartney disciplined these members in their absence and, in response, they left the UKUP and formed the NIUP. Led by Wilson, the new party argued that it had the support of the grassroots membership of the UKUP, but McCartney disputed this."]}, {"page": "2003 Northern Ireland Assembly election", "response": ["| align=\"right\" |Cedric Wilson"]}, {"page": "Robert McCartney (Northern Irish politician)", "response": ["in 1996.Peter Barberis, John McHugh and Mike Tyldesley, Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations, pg. 252 (2005).
