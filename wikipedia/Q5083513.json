He remained on board to travel to Otago for land exploration. Having bought land in the Awatere Valley sheep farming proved uneconomic and Taylor moved south, leaving his family in Nelson. He bought land in circa 1853 just north of the Waitaki River; the Waikakahi run was later known as Elephant Hill. Taylor sold the run in 1855 and took up run 28 at Otekaike, on the south side of the Waitaki River and inland from Duntroon. In 1856, he bought the Waiau run (run 165), located between the Waiau and Wairaki Rivers in Southland, from Charles Whybrow Ligar. He sold his northern land holdings, moved his stock over land to his new run, and sent for his family to come down from Nelson. He reached his new land in July 1856, and built a homestead 'Waldeck' near Riverton. He entertained at his homestead and it became an important meeting point."]}, {"page": "Surveyor General of Victoria", "response": ["| Charles Whybrow Ligar || 1858\u20131869 || Ligar earlier served as the Surveyor General of New Zealand 1841-1856 "]}, {"page": "Surveyor-General of New Zealand", "response": ["| Charles Whybrow Ligar || January 1842 \u2013 February  1856 || From 1852 to 1876 the office of Surveyor-General lapsed.

In mid-April, Bennett set the department's senior civil assistant, Charles Whybrow Ligar, to making a scale model from card in 50 ft contour heights which, quickly done, worked well. Having taken an office-residence at Armagh in April 1838, and inspected the civilian sketchers' work from Dungannon to Coleraine and the Giant's Causeway, he resolved that for efficacy and economy, the Royal Sappers and Miners must do the contour work. Settling in Armagh in early May he noted: \"got all right and comfortable\u2014shall now set to work\u2014head aches as bad nearly as ever with eternal flushings well it will end one way or another\u2014\" The headaches and sore eyes continued, nevertheless, he worked through the method of instrumental contours and by the end of May had made a scale skeleton model of \"Bendradagh\" in 50 ft contour heights, and soon after cast a plaster model of it.

The Institute opened its library in rented cottage from 7:00 pm, 30 September 1842, with John Kitchen as librarian. By 1843 they could provide members with a selection of works by approved authors, and their president hoped the ongoing debates \"will be instructive and engender a well directed taste for reading.\""]}]}}
