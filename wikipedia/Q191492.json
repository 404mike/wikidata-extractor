He most notably played for West Ham United, captaining the club for more than ten years, and was the captain of the England national team that won the 1966 FIFA World Cup. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest defenders in the history of football, and was cited by Pel\u00e9 as the greatest defender that he had ever played against.Widely regarded as West Ham's greatest ever player, Moore played over 600 games for the club during a 16-year tenure, winning the FA Cup in 1963\u201364 and the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1964\u201365. During his time at the club he won the FWA Footballer of the Year in 1964 and the West Ham Player of the Year in 1961, 1963, 1968 and 1970. In August 2008, West Ham United officially retired his number 6 shirt, 15 years after his death.Moore was made captain of England in 1964, at age 23, going on to lift the World Cup trophy in 1966. He won a total of 108 caps for his country, which at the time of his international retirement in 1973 was a national record. This record was later broken by Peter Shilton. Moore's total of 108 caps continued as a record for an outfield player until 28 March 2009, when David Beckham gained his 109th cap. Moore is a member of the World Team of the 20th Century. A national team icon, a bronze statue of Moore stands at the entrance to Wembley Stadium.\nA composed central defender, Moore was best known for his reading of the game and ability to anticipate opposition movements, thereby distancing himself from the image of the hard-tackling, high-jumping defender. Receiving the BBC Sports Personality of the Year in 1966, he was the first footballer to win the award and he remained the only one for a further 24 years. Moore was given an OBE in the New Year Honours List. He was made an inaugural inductee of the English Football Hall of Fame in 2002 in recognition of his impact on the English game as a player and in the same year he was named in the BBC's list of the 100 Greatest Britons.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 12", "response": ["*1941 \u2013 Bobby Moore, English footballer and manager (d. 1993)"]}, {"page": "Bobby Charlton", "response": ["Charlton was both Manchester United's and England's long-time record goalscorer, and United's long-time record appearance maker, as well as briefly England's, until Bobby Moore overtook his 106 caps in 1973.

The team's efforts at acclimatisation were not helped when Bobby Moore was falsely accused of stealing the infamous \"Bogot\u00e1 Bracelet\".

He passed an extremely undemanding fitness test but suffered a relapse shortly before the game and Ramsey was forced to rest him and play Peter Bonetti in his place. Ramsey remarked that \"of all the players to lose, we had to lose him.\" Banks watched the game on television at the hotel as England lost a two-goal lead to be eliminated 3\u20132 after extra time; due to a time delay on the broadcast he switched the television off with England 2\u20130 in the lead as Bobby Moore returned to the hotel to break the news of the defeat.

Manager Ted Fenton first selected him for a senior game in a Southern Floodlit Cup tie with Fulham in December 1958. He turned professional at the club four months later, and was paid \u00a37 a week with a \u00a320 signing on fee. His first competitive appearance came in February 1960 when injuries forced Fenton's hand; Hurst put in an indifferent performance and the team lost 3\u20131. He made only two further appearances in the 1959\u201360 season, and realised that Bobby Moore was making better progress in the same position than he was. He played six times in the 1960\u201361 campaign and seriously considered turning his main focus to cricket. In April 1961 Ron Greenwood took over as manager, and drastically changed team training by putting a focus on footballing skill rather than physical fitness.", "Hurst and West Ham had a poor start to the 1963\u201364 season, and went on to finish in 14th place. However it was in the FA Cup where the team impressed.

West Ham won 3\u20131, with Hurst scoring the final goal of the game after being set up by Bobby Moore. West Ham faced Second Division Preston North End at Wembley in the 1964 FA Cup Final, and had to come from behind twice to win the match 3\u20132.

Hurst reached the German penalty box and fired a powerful shot in the expectation that it would sail over the crossbar and waste time as the match drew to a close; the ball instead struck a divot as it bounced in front of Hurst and the shot connected well enough to beat the goalkeeper and hit the net to end the game at 4\u20132 to England.
