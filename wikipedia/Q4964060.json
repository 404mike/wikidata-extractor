The Doors were the supporting act on the last week, and Morrison's influence on the Doors singer Jim Morrison was noted by John Densmore in his book Riders on the Storm. Brian Hinton relates how \"Jim Morrison learned quickly from his near namesake's stagecraft, his apparent recklessness, his air of subdued menace, the way he would improvise poetry to a rock beat, even his habit of crouching down by the bass drum during instrumental breaks.\"Hinton (1997), page 67. On the final night, the two Morrisons and the two bands jammed together on \"Gloria\". from Van Morrison website. Photo of both Morrisons on stage.

YeatsHinton (1997), page 12. and others such as Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth.Turner (1993), page 145 Biographer Brian Hinton believes \"like any great poet from Blake to Seamus Heaney he takes words back to their origins in magic ... Indeed, Morrison is returning poetry to its earliest roots \u2013 as in Homer or Old English epics like Beowulf or the Psalms or folk song \u2013 in all of which words and music combine to form a new reality.\" Another biographer John Collis believes Morrison's style of jazz singing and repeating phrases preclude his lyrics from being regarded as poetry or as Collis asserts: \"he is more likely to repeat a phrase like a mantra, or burst into scat singing. The words may often be prosaic, and so can hardly be poetry.\"Collis (1996), page 10.", "Morrison's music has been described by music journalist Alan Light as \"Celtic soul\", or what biographer Brian Hinton referred to as a new alchemy called \"Caledonian soul.\" Another biographer, Ritchie Yorke quoted Morrison as believing that he has \"the spirit of Caledonia in his soul and his music reflects it.\"Yorke (1975), page 159. According to Yorke, Morrison claimed to have discovered \"a certain quality of soul\" when he first visited Scotland (his Belfast ancestors were of Ulster Scots descent) and Morrison has said he believes there is some connection between soul music and Caledonia. Yorke said Morrison \"discovered several years after he first began composing music that some of his songs lent themselves to a unique major modal scale (without sevenths) which of course is the same scale as that used by bagpipe players and old Irish and Scottish folk music.\""]}, {"page": "Moondance", "response": ["Morrison's lyrics on Moondance deal with themes of spiritual renewal and redemption. It departed from Astral Weeks discursive, stream-of-consciousness narratives as the singer balanced his spiritual ideas with more worldly subject matter, which biographer Johnny Rogan felt offered the record a quality of \"earthiness\". As a counterpart to Astral Weeks, AllMusic critic Jason Ankeny believed it \"retains the previous album's deeply spiritual thrust but transcends its bleak, cathartic intensity\" by rejoicing in \"natural wonder\". According to Christgau, the essence of Morrison's spirit was, much like the African-American music that inspired him, \"mortal and immortal simultaneously: this is a man who gets stoned on a drink of water and urges us to turn up our radios all the way into the mystic.\" His \"giddy\" preoccupation with \"natural wonder\" on the album was a product of the new approach to composition and the mellow feel of his new band, Harrington said. In his opinion, the record's exuberant spirit and theme of self-affirmation were partly inspired by the singer having \"settled into a life of domestic bliss\". Musicologist Brian Hinton argued that Morrison was celebrating a \"natural alternative\" in his music after quitting soft drugs around this time because they had impeded his productivity."]}, {"page": "Astral Weeks", "response": ["\"The Way Young Lovers Do\" is described by Clinton Heylin as a \"lounge-jazz\" sound that \"still sticks out like Spumante at a champagne buffet\". In his review for Rolling Stone, Greil Marcus also spoke of the song as a \"poor jazz-flavored cut that, is uncomfortably out of place on this record\". Brian Hinton describes it as there being \"a Sinatra strut to Van's voice, a blues knowingness with Stax brass, and a string section which swirls where previously it drifted.\" He describes it as \"about growing up, an adolescent first kiss\".Hinton (1996), p. 97"]}, {"page": "Sandy Denny", "response": ["Beginning with What We Did on Our Holidays, the first of three albums she made with the band in the late 1960s, Denny is credited with encouraging Fairport Convention to explore the traditional British folk repertoire, and is thus regarded as a key figure in the development of British folk rock. She brought with her the traditional repertoire she had refined in the clubs, including \"A Sailor's Life\" featured on their second album together Unhalfbricking. Framing Denny's performance of this song with their own electric improvisations, her bandmates discovered what then proved to be the inspiration for an entire album, the influential Liege & Lief (1969).Brian Hinton and Geoff Wall, Ashley Hutchings: The Authorised Biography \u2013 The Guv\u2019nor and the Rise of Folk-Rock, 1945\u20131973.

The first was in sessions from September to November 1968, just after Astral Weeks was recorded. Morrison rearranged \"Domino\" frequently from 1968 to 1970, notably recording rap and harmony versions. For its release it was arranged in a moderate 4/4 tempo and features rhythm guitar. Horn overdubs were later added to the recording. Morrison ad libs between the end of the chorus and the start of the verses, when he shouts the words \"Dig it!\", as well as near the end with \"And the band\u00a0... one more time!\", which, according to biographer Peter Mills, helps bring out the theme of \"liveliness\" in both the song and the album as a whole. The song was considered by musicologist Brian Hinton as a tribute to pianist and singer-songwriter, Fats Domino. As with \"Domino\", Morrison first recorded \"If I Ever Needed Someone\" in late 1968; it is one of many blues-influenced tracks on the album.", "In the album closer, \"Street Choir\", Morrison repeats the questions, \"Why did you let me down / And now that things are better off / Why do you come around\". Because of these lyrics Heylin wrote that \"such songs [as \"Street Choir\"] were spawned by an increasing awareness of just how badly ripped off he had been\". Ken Brooks has said that the lyric \"Move On Up\" is another reference on the album to a Curtis Mayfield song. The track prominently features Keith Johnson's trumpet and Morrison's harmonica. Writer Brian Hinton described the lyrics as perversely bitter, while Jon Landau wrote that \"Street Choir\" was one of the \"two or three finest songs\" of Morrison's career because of its \"musical and poetic energy\".", "Warner Bros. Records scheduled His Band and the Street Choir for rush-release to sell over Christmas 1970, leaving little time to plan the packaging. These pressured conditions led the company to mistitle the promotional releases as His Band and Street Choir and prepare an incorrectly ordered track listing. At the end of \"I'll Be Your Lover, Too\" an unedited conversation is left on the finished record, which Peter Mills notes is an example of the album's rough edges. Janet Planet designed the album cover and wrote the sleeve notes, which sound \"a little desperate\", in the words of Brian Hinton, as she wrote, \"This is the album that you must sing with, dance to, you must find a place for these songs somewhere in your life.\"", "ZigZag magazine reviewer John Tobler felt, \"even if it's inferior to Moondance, it is still better than eighty per cent of the records you've got in your collection.\" Robert Christgau wrote in The Village Voice, \"A few humdrum cuts and an occasional minor lapse of taste make this a less compelling album than Moondance, which only means it wasn't one of the very best of 1970. The good cuts, especially 'Domino' and 'Blue Money,' are superb examples of Morrison's loose, allusive white r&b.\" Biographer Brian Hinton commented that His Band and the Street Choir is \"vaguely reminiscent of Bob Dylan's Nashville Skyline\". Singer-songwriter Elvis Costello identified His Band and the Street Choir as one of his 500 essential albums and \"Street Choir\" as one of his favorite songs. In 2006 Johnny Rogan called the songs on the album \"a severe disappointment when compared to the material on the previous two albums.\""]}, {"page": "Saint Dominic's Preview", "response": ["\"Listen to the Lion\" is an eleven-minute song that begins with a mellow opening and Morrison then improvises new singing methods, turning himself into a lion with growling, wailing and various other vocal techniques as the song progresses. It has been said to be, by both technique and emotion, \"a vocal performance that remains unparalleled by his contemporaries.\"Hage, The Words and Music of Van Morrison, pp. 65\u201369 Caledonia, one of Morrison's favourite symbols, is referred to \"during the coda when he works himself up into a trancelike gospel improvisation\": \"And we sailed and we sailed and we sailed and we sailed... way up to Caledonia.\" Brian Hinton described the song: \"We are back in Astral Weeks territory, a bass led shuffle and Van lost in his own poetic universe, but here his voice takes wilder risks; growling, a near death rattle, feral grunts and roars.\" The chorus chanting \"Listen to the Lion\" behind the singer is made up of three male voices, including Morrison, \"singing at himself\".Marcus, When That Rough God Goes Riding, p. 65"]}, {"page": "A Period of Transition", "response": ["\"You Gotta Make It Through the World\" is according to Morrison, \"a survival song\".  Dr. John felt that it had \"a real spiritual sound\". \"It Fills You Up\" is an attempt by the singer to explain the inspirational spirit that is often found in his music.  \"The Eternal Kansas City\"  is, according to Dr. John, \"the song that Van got the whole album hooked up around.  It was a real deep thing for him to focus on.  It goes from a real ethereal voice sound to a jazz introduction and then into a kind of chunky R&B.\" The song, \"Joyous Sound\" is described by Brian Hinton as \"more like the real Van as he starts to wail and the lyrics describe themselves.\" Morrison said of the track, \"Flamingos Fly\", \"I've done three versions in the studio.  I've done it slow, a ballad version.  I've done a mid-tempo version and I've done this version.  This is the version I like best for release.\"  \"Heavy Connection\" is said to be \"psychic stuff\" with the lyrics vague and secret but speaking of a love connection \"when you came into my dreams/like from a whisper to a scream.\"  The last song on the album is \"Cold Wind in August\".  Dr. John describes it as a \"cross current from forties to seventies music.  It's like where Ray Charles left off.  It's a real tear-jerker that gets back to the basics of music.\"Hinton. Celtic Crossroads, p.199 \"Flamingos Fly\" was covered by Sammy Hagar, a year before A Period of Transition was released, on his first solo album Nine on a Ten Scale.Hinton.

Morrison said it \"was actually a part of a poem I was writing and the poem and the song sort of merged.\"  The lyrics include images of Wordsworth and Coleridge \"smokin' up in Kendal\" (Brian Hinton says they are \"smokin' with poetry not spliffs\"). It ends with the music being brought down to nothing and the words, \"Can you feel the silence?\""]}, {"page": "No Guru, No Method, No Teacher", "response": ["\"Foreign Window\" is a song concerned with dealing with some sort of self-imposed therapy and having to go on no matter what.

Records in the United States. Its packaging featured a front cover conceptualized by Rudy Legname (later known as Rudi). It consists of a hand reaching up to a circle of cloud, containing a crescent shape, stars and a prismatic rainbow. The album was not released with a lyric sheet, and many of the first vinyl pressings were cut off-center, all because of production issues that resulted in a lack of quality control and \"shoddy packaging\", according to Morrison biographer Brian Hinton."]}, {"page": "Poetic Champions Compose", "response": ["Morrison originally intended the album to consist wholly of jazz instrumental works, but later said that \"when I did three numbers I thought, 'No, I don't wanna do that,' and changed my mind.\"Heylin, Can You Feel the Silence?, p.412 Nonetheless, each side of the album opens with an instrumental, \"Spanish Steps\" and \"Celtic Excavation\", and the album closes with another, \"Allow Me\".

Van Morrison in Q magazine said, \"People find it incredible when I tell them that people used to sing and play music in the street.

Yeats poem \"The Second Coming\" with its figure from the Apocalypse \"rough beast\".  Leo Green's saxophone follows Morrison's voice like a twin brother.  In \"Waiting Game\" he is \"the brother of the snake\" which Brian Hinton says refers to both his lost friend Jim Morrison (known for writing about \"The Lizard King\"), and the Garden of Eden. \"Piper at the Gates of Dawn\"  follows the children's book, The Wind in the Willows closely and Paddy Moloney plays uillean pipes with Phil Coulter on piano.
