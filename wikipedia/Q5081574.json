He sat in the House of Commons from 1835 to 1898, making him the longest-serving Member of Parliament (MP). He also holds the distinction of the oldest candidate to win a parliamentary seat, at 93.  He was a radical and reformer who often collaborated with John Bright and had a noteworthy effect in the leadership of the Anti-Corn Law League, until its repeal in 1846.  Lord Palmerston appointed him to the cabinet as president of the Poor-Law Board in 1859.  His Public Works (Manufacturing Districts) Act of 1863 opened job-creating schemes in public health projects.  He progressed numerous other reforms, most notably the Metropolitan Poor Law Act of 1867. Florence Nightingale helped him formulate the reform, in particular, ensure professionalisation of nursing as part of the poor law regime, the workhouses of which erected public infirmaries under an Act of the same year.  His political importance was overshadowed by his brother, the Earl of Clarendon, and undercut by the hostility of Gladstone.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
