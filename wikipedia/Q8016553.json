The committee of inquiry decided that the gun had been double-loaded, but this view was widely questioned, including by Sir William Palliser, designer of the Palliser shell used by these guns. Palliser's view instead was that the shot had been obstructed by a portion of the millboard disc rammed above the shell. Hydraulic power-ramming was thought to be implicated in the double loading as the telescopic hydraulic rammer had not made the double loading obvious, as a manual ramrod would have done. One piece of evidence supporting the double loading theory was the presence of an additional stud torn from a Palliser shell, found amongst the wreckage within the turret. Thunderer was then regarded as an unlucky ship and was placed in reserve at Malta in 1881 and had her machinery overhauled. Her armament was augmented with a pair of  torpedo launchers and a half-dozen 1-inch (25\u00a0mm) Nordenfelt guns on the hurricane deck. She was recommissioned in 1885 and remained with the Mediterranean Fleet until she was paid off at Chatham Dockyard.Parkes, pp. 201\u201302 The future King George V served aboard Thunderer in 1885\u201386.Phillips, p. 208"]}, {"page": "Taunton (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Sir William Palliser"]}, {"page": "Palliser", "response": ["* William Palliser (1830\u20131882), Irish-born politician and inventor, Member of Parliament"]}, {"page": "Palliser shot and shell", "response": ["Palliser shot is an early British armour-piercing artillery projectile, intended to pierce the armour protection of warships being developed in the second half of the 19th century, It was invented by Sir William Palliser, after whom it is named."]}, {"page": "West Kensington", "response": ["Another local landowner and developer in the 19th century was the Irish-born politician Sir William Palliser.

The widely adopted solution, invented in 1863 by William Palliser, consisted of enlarging the bore to accept a wrought iron tube (called the A tube) into which the rifling had been cut. The A tube was closed at the breech end by a wrought iron cup screwed into it.  Iron was removed from the outside of the original gun barrel near to the muzzle so that a cast iron collar could be screwed over it and provide a shoulder at the muzzle to hold the A tube in place. The A tube was also held by a plug screwed into the gun underneath its trunnions. The outside of the breech portion was turned on a lathe so that another wrought iron tube, called the B tube, could be slid over it to strengthen it."]}, {"page": "List of people from Waterford", "response": ["*William Palliser (1830\u20131882), politician, inventor"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1880 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Sir William Palliser"]}]}}
