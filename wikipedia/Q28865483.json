He then worked with the Royal Navy to devise a system, known as an anti-submarine indicator loop, for detecting submarines by detecting currents induced in a loop of wire on the sea floor.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alexander Mitchell", "response": ["* Alexander Crichton Mitchell (1864\u20131952), Scottish physicist"]}, {"page": "Anti-submarine indicator loop", "response": ["Independently from the BIR, in August 1915, a submerged cable was laid on the seabed of the Firth of Forth. The idea originated with the Scottish physicist Alexander Crichton Mitchell, who was helped by the Royal Navy at HMS Tarlair.Mitchell, A C. On the vertical force changes during the \"sudden commencement\" of a magnetic storm. Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh Vol. 45, no. 26 (1925) pp. 297-301. He had shown that the passage of a submarine past a cable formed an induction loop which induced a voltage of approximately a millivolt, detectable by a sensitive galvanometer. Voltages were also induced in the cable by random fluctuations in the Earth's magnetic field and electrical noise from the Glasgow tram lines. Mitchell installed an identical loop outside of the channel for vessels, the two loops were connected so that the random fluctuations cancelled each other out.  A rheostat was used to give the two loops identical resistances, so that no current flowed until a vessel approached.  Unfortunately his report to the BIR was misunderstood and his findings rejected as of no value.Walding, R 'Bragg and Mitchell's Antisubmarine Loop', Australian Physics, 46 (2009), 140-145. Available online at https://www.academia.edu/6720520/Bragg_and_Mitchell_s_Antisubmarine_Loop  Consequently, there was a hiatus in the installation of loops until their utility was demonstrated beyond question. With Bragg's leadership a number were installed.Walding 2009, pp. 140-145 Later in World War I the tiny induced voltages were amplified by vacuum tube  amplifiers.  Even with this assistance a long loop installed to monitor  traffic in the English Channel proved impractical."]}, {"page": "University College Thiruvananthapuram", "response": ["* Dr Alexander Crichton Mitchell D.Sc., F.R.S.E 1892\u20131909"]}, {"page": "Arthur Crichton Mitchell", "response": ["#REDIRECT Alexander Crichton Mitchell"]}]}}
