His regular position was as a goalkeeper. He was born in Fenton, Staffordshire. He played for Chesterton White Star, Northwich Victoria, and Manchester United.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hugh Edmonds", "response": ["In February 1911, he moved to Manchester United as cover for the injured Harry Moger. He made his debut in a 3\u20131 win at home to Bristol City on 11 February. With Edmonds in goal, Manchester United lost only two of their final 13 league matches and conceded just 12 goals as they went on to clinch their second league title by a single point over runners-up Aston Villa. He claimed his second piece of silverware with the club at the start of the following season as Manchester United beat Swindon Town 8\u20134 in the 1911 FA Charity Shield, and retained his place in the team for much of the 1911\u201312 season; aside from five appearances for Moger (one in a 3\u20131 win over Aston Villa on 25 November and four more at the end of the season) and two for Ezra Royals (against Liverpool on 23 March and Aston Villa on 30 March), Edmonds played in every match. However, the team suffered a slump in form compared to the previous season and finished in 13th place."]}]}}
