He has lived in Canada and Scotland.\nIn 1999 MacDonald wrote and self-published his first novel. DoubleZero, a Y2K-themed novel, was well received on the underground \u2018zine community in Toronto, being Broken Pencil magazine's Spring 2000 \"Book of the Issue\", and was sold in major bookstores across Canada. The review in Toronto's NOW magazine, written by Bert Archer, said \"Amid the dystopian clamour, a thoughtful, light, original and -- just for a change -- utopian look at the beginning of the new millennium.\"In 2006 MacDonald released his second and third novels, The Willies and Idea in Stone, under his own imprint: typesetting, printing and binding each copy himself  from a home studio in Scotland. His fourth novel Finitude which deals with the possibilities of future climate chaos was published under the same imprint in 2009. As an example of the growing subgenre of speculative fiction known as climate fiction or Cli-fi, Finitude has begun to appear as a text on university syllabi for courses examining climate change in fiction.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2006 in Scotland", "response": ["* Hamish MacDonald self-publishes The Willies and Idea in Stone."]}, {"page": "Hamish MacDonald", "response": ["Hamish MacDonald may refer to:", "*Hamish MacDonald (athlete) (born 1974), Australian Paralympian", "*Hamish MacDonald (author), Canadian born Scottish author and Indie publisher"]}]}}
