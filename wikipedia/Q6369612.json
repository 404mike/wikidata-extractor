Comedians Paul Riley and Mark Cox also appeared regularly on the show among other actors such as Gregor Fisher and Tom Urie.", "; The Lonely Shopkeeper (Karen Dunbar): A bored, friendless woman working in a corner shop who is \"stuck in this shop, day after day after day...\", and therefore constantly trying to be over-friendly with her customers, and invariably frightening them off. She often attempts to pry into customers' personal lives, and comments on their (occasionally embarrassing) purchases. In the final sketch, she had seemingly faked her death to get sympathy of those that attended her wake within the shop.", "; The Depressed Taxi Caller (Karen Dunbar): These sketches feature an extremely unlucky woman named Fiona working as a taxi controller, who is always shown crying down her headset to the drivers about her terrible life and how her new boyfriends keep dying in bizarre circumstances. She generally smokes many cigarettes and drinks large volumes of whisky throughout the sketch, in order to \"dull the pain.\"", "; Betty the Auld Slapper (Karen Dunbar): A female OAP, usually seen giving interviews to a \"teatime [radio] show\" about her memories from during the Second World War. These always end up with Betty describing her (numerous) sexual experiences in detail before being cut off by the show's exasperated host (Hemphill).

The baton was then passed to Sir Chris Hoy, who delivered it to President of the Commonwealth Games Federation Prince Imran and the Queen. The display of the message concealed within the baton was delayed by a difficulty in opening the device. The Games were launched in partnership with UNICEF, to save and change children's lives. The unique partnership aimed \"to use the power of sport to reach every child in Scotland and benefit children in every Commonwealth nation and territory.\" In the culmination of a groundbreaking partnership with UNICEF, the ceremony inspired millions to text donations to our shared \u2018Put Children First\u2019 campaign, which raised \u00a33.5 million on the night and more than \u00a35 million to date.
