Before playing for Villa he played for West Bromwich Albion and Walsall.\n\nA player of parts and a worthy follower of past Villa heroes. Scrupulously fair and honest in tackling, a willing worker, and an adept at finding openings for goal in big games. No place in the half-back line comes amiss to him. A quite, unostentatious player of the untiring order, he has done his share in raising the tone of football both on and off the field. 'Straight as a die', he is a general and deserved favourite.\nThe Villa News and Record 1 September 1906\nWilkes instantly experienced success at Villa Park, playing a bit part in the club's 1898\u201399 title success before establishing himself as a first team regular in their 1899\u20131900 title victory. He was less fortunate in the FA cup where he found himself part of a Villa side beaten in a famous cup upset by Southern League Millwall Athletic.He made five appearances for England, between March 1901 and May 1902, scoring the equalizing goal against Scotland in a 2\u20132 draw at Villa Park on 3 May 1902 \u2013 this was the replay of the match that was abandoned as a result of the first Ibrox disaster on 5 April 1902, in which 25 people died and 517 were injured.\nHe began his photographic career whilst still a player and he continued until his death. His son Albert Wilkes Junior continued the business until it was sold to leading photographic agency Colorsport in 1970.", "link_mentions": {}}}
