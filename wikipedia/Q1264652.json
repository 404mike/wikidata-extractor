In 1899 the German palaeobotanist Henry Potoni\u00e9 coined the term \"Cycadofilices\" (\"cycad-ferns\") for such fossils, suggesting that they were a group of non-seed plants intermediate between the ferns and cycads.  Shortly afterwards, the British palaeobotanists Frank Oliver and Dukinfield Henry Scott (with the assistance of Oliver's student at the time, Marie Stopes) made the critical discovery that some of these fronds (genus Lyginopteris) were associated with seeds (genus Lagenostoma) that had identical and very distinctive glandular hairs, and concluded that both fronds and seeds belonged to the same plant. Soon, additional evidence came to light suggesting that seeds were also attached to the Carboniferous fern-like fronds Dicksonites, Neuropteris and Aneimites.  Initially it was still thought that they were \"transitional fossils\" intermediate between the ferns and cycads, and especially in the English-speaking world they were referred to as \"seed ferns\" or \"pteridosperms\".  Today, despite being regarded by most palaeobotanists as only distantly related to ferns, these spurious names have nonetheless established themselves. Nowadays, four orders of Palaeozoic seed plants tend to be referred to as pteridosperms: Lyginopteridales, Medullosales, Callistophytales and Peltaspermales."]}, {"page": "Linnean Medal", "response": ["*1921: Dukinfield Henry Scott"]}, {"page": "Frederick Orpen Bower", "response": ["In 1880 he acquired a position as assistant lecturer in botany at University College, London under Thomas Huxley.
