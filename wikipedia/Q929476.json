Brian Ferneyhough says that, although the \"technical and speculative innovations\" of Klavierst\u00fccke I\u2013IV, Kreuzspiel and Kontra-Punkte escaped him on first encounter, they nevertheless produced a \"sharp emotion, the result of a beneficial shock engendered by their boldness\" and provided \"an important source of motivation (rather than of imitation) for my own investigations\". While still in school, he became fascinated upon hearing the British premi\u00e8re of Gruppen, and listened many times to the recording of this performance, while trying to penetrate its secrets\u2014how it always seemed to be about to explode, but managed nevertheless to escape unscathed in its core\u2014but scarcely managed to grasp it. Retrospectively, it is clear that from this confusion was born my interest for the formal questions which remain until today. Although it eventually evolved in a direction of its own, Ferneyhough's 1967 wind sextet, Prometheus, began as a wind quintet with cor anglais, stemming directly from an encounter with Stockhausen's Zeitma\u00dfe. With respect to Stockhausen's later work, he said, I have never subscribed (whatever the inevitable personal distance) to the thesis according to which the many transformations of vocabulary characterizing Stockhausen's development are the obvious sign of his inability to carry out the early vision of strict order that he had in his youth. On the contrary, it seems to me that the constant reconsideration of his premises has led to the maintenance of a remarkably tough thread of historical consciousness which will become clearer with time. ... I doubt that there has been a single composer of the intervening generation who, even if for a short time, did not see the world of music differently thanks to the work of Stockhausen. In a short essay describing Stockhausen's influence on his own work, Richard Barrett concludes that \"Stockhausen remains the composer whose next work I look forward most to hearing, apart from myself of course\" and names as works that have had particular impact on his musical thinking Mantra, Gruppen, Carr\u00e9, Klavierst\u00fcck X, Inori, and Jubil\u00e4um."]}, {"page": "Microtonal music", "response": ["* Richard Barrett (b. 1959)"]}, {"page": "Royal Conservatory of The Hague", "response": ["Jill Feldman, Dina Appeldoorn, Clarence Barlow, Richard Barrett, Konrad Boehmer, Frans Br\u00fcggen, Wim Henderickx, Ton Koopman, Yannis Kyriakides, Reinbert de Leeuw, Kenneth Montgomery, Ryo Terakado, Kathryn Cok, Eric Vloeimans, Luis Otavio Santos and Dorothea Winter."]}, {"page": "Vanitas", "response": ["*Composer Richard Barrett's Vanity, for orchestra, is greatly inspired by this movement."]}, {"page": "Contemporary classical music", "response": ["Though often atonal, highly abstract, and dissonant in sound, the \"New Complexity\" is most readily characterized by the use of techniques which require complex musical notation.
