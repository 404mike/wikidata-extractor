He is a right-handed batsman and a left-arm slow bowler. He has the distinction of being one of the youngest ever players for the Scottish cricket team. He has played 82 times for Scotland, including four first-class and nine List A matches. He was not selected for the Scotland squad at the 1999 Cricket World Cup, but did play for them in the cricket tournament at the 1998 Commonwealth Games.\nHis best bowling performance is 5 for 48 which he achieved in 1992 in Johannesburg. Though he is an opening batsman for his club side, he has a low batting average for the national side and is generally asked to bat as a tailender. Sheridan appeared in the ICC Trophy between 1997 and 2001.\nAs of 2016, he was working as a civil engineer.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cricket at the 1998 Commonwealth Games", "response": ["* Keith Sheridan"]}, {"page": "1997 ICC Trophy", "response": ["In the 3rd place play off, Scotland batted first, and scored 187 in 45 overs after rain delayed the start.
