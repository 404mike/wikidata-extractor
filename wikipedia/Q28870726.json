Manager Rob Page signed a new two-year contract in May 2015. However he needed to avoid a poor start to the season as chairman Norman Smurthwaite warned he was prepared to make \"ruthless decisions\" if the club were struggling by September. The first signings of the season were powerful former loanee defender Remie Streete from Newcastle United, and former Norwich City youth player Sam Kelly. Midfielder Sam Foley also joined the \"Valiants\" on a two-year contract, choosing to leave relegated Yeovil Town just after picking up Yeovil's Player of the Year award. Page further strengthened the defence and midfield by signing Walsall right-back Ben Purkiss and Crewe Alexandra defensive midfielder Anthony Grant. Page needed to find a cost-effective forward with the club both short on strikers following the departure of Tom Pope and Ben Williamson and with little funds available due to a large cut to the wage bill, and so brought in young Watford striker Uche Ikpeazu on loan, having been impressed by Ikpeazu's performances for Crewe last season. Another former Crewe favourite, A-Jay Leitch-Smith, was also signed after impressing Page during pre-season. The eighth and final summer signing was Ryan Inniss, who was confirmed as joining on a season long loan from Crystal Palace after being linked with a return to Vale Park for many weeks. On 6 August, Vale signed goalkeeper Jak Alnwick on a short-term deal; he was signed to compete with Sam Johnson for a first team place as Chris Neal was out injured at the start of the season.", "|align=\"left\"|MF||31||align=\"left\"| Billy Reeves", "| 6 November 2015 || MF ||  || Billy Reeves || Witton Albion || 6 February 2016 || ", "| 12 February 2016 || MF ||  || Billy Reeves || Hyde United || 12 March 2016 || "]}, {"page": "2016\u201317 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["Brown signed Vale's eighth goalkeeper of the season on 1 March after former Turkey youth international Deniz Mehmet agreed to a short-term contract.

Brown acted on 17 March by bringing in former Cameroon international defender Andr\u00e9 Bikey and re-signing Ryan Taylor on contracts running until the end of the season. Later that evening Taylor provided an assist and scored a goal as Vale claimed a crucial 2\u20131 home win over relegation rivals Shrewsbury Town. Vale had the chance to exit the relegation zone on 21 March, but put in a poor performance at the Ricoh Arena and conspired to become the only team to lose home and away to bottom club Coventry City that season.
