Three players, Ralph Blakemore, Alfred Mayo and Tom Wilson, made a single appearance during the season and would never play for the first team again. Robbins was the team's highest scorer during the campaign, netting 12 times in all competitions.

In total, 13 players scored at least one goal during the season."]}]}}
