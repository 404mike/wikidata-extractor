A centre-back, he began his professional career with Fulham after progressing through the club's youth academy. He made his senior debut in a League Cup match in 2000 but made just two further first team appearances for Fulham. He spent two spells on loan with Oldham Athletic in 2003 before joining Crystal Palace on loan after Oldham manager Iain Dowie moved between the two clubs. He joined Palace on a permanent basis soon after as they spent one season in the Premier League before establishing himself in the first team following their return to the Championship.\nIn 2008, he joined Charlton Athletic following the expiration of his contract where he was later appointed captain of the side but suffered relegation to League One during his only season at the club. He instead joined Cardiff City and was appointed captain on his arrival. He helped the side reach the play-offs in his first three seasons, suffering defeat each time, before they won promotion to the Premier League by winning the Championship in 2013. However, Hudson was dropped following promotion in favour of new signings and made only nine further appearances in over a year before departing for Huddersfield Town.\nHe again took over the captaincy soon after his arrival and made over 100 appearances for the club during a three-year spell, helping them win promotion to the Premier League in his final season. He announced his retirement from playing at the end of the 2016\u201317 season and was appointed manager of the club's under-23 squad. Hudson has been Huddersfield's caretaker manager on two occasions failing to win either of his two games in charge.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "March 30", "response": ["*1982 \u2013 Mark Hudson, English footballer"]}, {"page": "Craig Bellamy", "response": ["On 17 August 2010, Bellamy signed for Cardiff City on a season-long loan from Manchester City. Cardiff manager Dave Jones confirmed Bellamy would become team captain for the season with former captain Mark Hudson named club captain. Manchester City had been wary of selling Bellamy to a potential divisional rival and had suggested the idea of a move to Cardiff, paying a large percentage of his wages to make the move. He made his debut for Cardiff on 21 August in a 4\u20130 win over Doncaster Rovers, in which he scored from a  free kick. After playing the subsequent game against Portsmouth, Bellamy missed the next five games due to a buildup of fluid on his knee that required rest. He returned and scored in a 2\u20131 win against Barnsley on 2 October. Bellamy hoped to avoid further injury problems and hired Raymond Verheijen, his former fitness coach at Manchester City, to work with him during the season and paid Verheijen's wages himself. Bellamy scored in four consecutive home-league matches against Coventry, Leeds, Watford and Reading but rarely trained as much as the first team to rest his knee, which was swelling profusely after games. He scored the winning goal in the South Wales derby against Swansea City on 6 February 2011 with a long-range shot in the final minutes of the match; it was the first time Cardiff had won at their rival's ground since 1997."]}, {"page": "Dean Whitehead", "response": ["In June 2015, Whitehead signed for Championship club Huddersfield Town on a two-year contract. Upon joining the club, he was given a number four shirt ahead of the 2015\u201316 season. He made his debut in a 2\u20130 defeat against Hull City at the KC Stadium on 8 August. He captained Huddersfield Town for the first time on 11 August, in a 2\u20131 loss against Notts County. Whitehead quickly established himself in the first-team under the management of Chris Powell. He captained the side once again following  Mark Hudson's absence for five matches between 12 September and 3 October. Whitehead's performance saw him earned BWF Player of the Month for October and November. However, he suffered a knee injury during a 2\u20130 win over Birmingham City on 5 December and was sidelined for two months. A month later, on 23 January, Whitehead returned to the first-team from injury, coming on as a late substitute in a 2\u20131 loss against Brighton & Hove Albion. Since returning to the first-team, he regained his first-team place in the starting eleven for the rest of the season.

Back in the line-up as Crystal Palace's first choice goalkeeper, Speroni flourished and won his reputation back. During a 1\u20130 loss against Ipswich Town on 26 August 2007, he was given a yellow card in the 43rd minute after \"handling on the edge of his box\"; after the match, the opposition team felt that Speroni should have been sent\u2013off, which manager Taylor disagreed. In a follow\u2013up match against rivals, Charlton Athletic,  Speroni was at fault when he \"rushed out to deal with a hopeful long-ball in the 74th minute - only for substitute Svetoslav Todorov to nip in and score the only goal of the game\", in a 1\u20130 loss. After the match, Taylor said he maintain his backing for Speroni, saying he will bounce back. In a match against Sheffield United on 22 September 2007, Speroni was at fault once again when he conceded two goals, in a 3\u20132 win; leading to suggestions that Taylor could re\u2013sign Iain Turner, which he denied, though the possibly was not ruled out. Following this, Speroni managed to bounce back with impressive displays and helped the club go on a fifteen matches unbeaten run between 3 November 2007 and 28 January 2008. Manager Neil Warnock also praised his performance, describing him as looking sharp and bright, which teammate Mark Hudson agreed. Towards the end of the 2007\u201308 season, he helped Crystal Palace qualify for the Championship play\u2013offs. Speroni played in both legs of the Championship play\u2013offs against Bristol City, as the club lost 4\u20132 on aggregate. At the end of the 2007\u201308 season, he was an ever present goalkeeper, playing all forty\u2013eight league matches. With his contract expiring at the end of the 2007\u201308 season, Crystal Palace began talks with Speroni over a new contract. He signed a contract extension with the club on a three-year contract, keeping him until 2011. For his performance, Speroni won the club's \"Player of the Year\" award. Reflecting on his performance in the 2007\u201308 season, Your Local Guardian said: \"Julian Speroni had a tremendous campaign, increasing his authority and presence alongside his already technically excellent game. Time after time, Speroni has kept us in matches with some fine saves and it was a relief when he sorted out his contract.\""]}, {"page": "Kevin McNaughton", "response": ["In 2011\u201312, McNaughton was named as stand-in captain in Mark Hudson's absence starting on 22 November against Coventry City.

He took the number 37 shirt which he wore during his loan spell at Nottingham Forest at the end of the previous season. On 7 August, he was named as the new club captain by manager Mark Robins, replacing Peter Clarke, who left at the end of the previous season. He made his second debut for the Terriers in their 4\u20130 defeat by Bournemouth on 9 August.
