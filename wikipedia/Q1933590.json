After running his own successful design consultancy for several years, he devoted his time to painting and writing. In 1990, Mike Wilks was the subject of an award-winning documentary on BBC television. His original paintings and drawings, which have a surreal and dreamlike quality with an unsettling undertone, have been acquired by the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, as well as many private collections.\nHis first novel, Mirrorscape, is a fantasy adventure set in the land of Nem, a parallel world where the bizarre is commonplace and everyday logic is in abeyance. Two more Mirrorscape books have since been published. The three form the Mirrorscape Trilogy. The second book, Mirrorstorm, focuses on Mel, Wren and Ludo (the main characters) and their journey back into the Mirrorscape to save Nem once more- this time they face far greater troubles. The third book, Mirrorshade, published in late 2009, is the last in the trilogy, and is about the same three, but facing worse troubles than ever before.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Mike Wilks", "response": ["Mike Wilks is the name of:", "* Mike Wilks (basketball) (born 1979), NBA basketball player", "* Mike Wilks (author), author of The Ultimate Alphabet and Mirrorscape"]}, {"page": "Mike Wilks (Author)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Mike Wilks (author) "]}, {"page": "Wilks", "response": ["* Mike Wilks (author) (born 1947), English artist, illustrator and author", "* Mike Wilks (basketball) (born 1979), American basketball player"]}]}}
