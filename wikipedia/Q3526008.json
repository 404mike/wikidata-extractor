He played in three Tests for England against South Africa in 1927\u201328. He would have toured Australia in 1928\u201329 but his health broke down before the tour began.\nHowever, as a stock bowler for Nottinghamshire, Staples was an essential part of their successful team in the 1920s because his long spells of accurate medium-pace bowling allowed speedster Harold Larwood and the physically sensitive Tich Richmond to be more effective through not being overworked. Although on a relatively few occasions his off-break from round the wicket could be quite unplayable, Staples rarely obtained exceptional averages even in helpful summers but there is no doubt that without his ability to keep more penetrative bowlers fresh Nottinghamshire's bowling would have been much less formidable.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Harold Larwood", "response": ["From the age of five, Harold attended Kirkby Woodhouse school. Over the years this small village school produced, besides Larwood, four other international cricketers who became his contemporaries in the Nottinghamshire county side:  William \"Dodge\" Whysall, Sam Staples, Bill Voce and Joe Hardstaff junior. On leaving the school in 1917, when he was 13, Harold was employed at the local miners' cooperative store, before beginning work the following year at Annesley Colliery in charge of a team of pit ponies.   He had shown an early talent for cricket, and began to play for Nuncargate's second team in 1918. Playing against experienced adults, in his first season he took 76 wickets at an average of 4.9. By 1920 he was in the first team, alongside his father, playing in plimsolls because the family could not afford to buy him proper cricket boots.Hamilton, pp. 71\u201372"]}, {"page": "List of Test cricketers", "response": ["Sam Staples \u00b7"]}, {"page": "Sam Staples (cricketer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sam Staples"]}, {"page": "Staples (name)", "response": ["* Sam Staples (1892\u20131950), English cricketer"]}, {"page": "Charles Harris (cricketer)", "response": ["Harris was born in Underwood, Nottinghamshire, and first played for Nottinghamshire in 1928, but had no chance of a regular place in the side until 1931 when a motor accident deprived them of the services of Larwood, Sam Staples, and George Vernon Gunn for a month. Although he played no big innings, Harris batted so consistently that, aided by nine not outs, he averaged 50.20 in a very wet summer.

Nottinghamshire won the toss and elected to field first. Put into bat, Sussex made 259 all out in their first-innings, with Collins scoring 27 runs before he was the last man out, dismissed by Len Richmond. Nottinghamshire responded in their first-innings by making 294 all out, with Collins opening the bowling with Henry Roberts. Collins bowled eleven wicketless overs, conceding 33 runs. Sussex then made 169 all out in their second-innings, with Collins once again the last man out, dismissed this time for a duck by Sam Staples. The match ended as a draw.

Until they fell away somewhat in the late thirties, Notts were one of the most competitive teams and usually in contention. They won the title in 1929 and were runners-up in three other seasons. Noted batsmen were George Gunn, \"Dodge\" Whysall, Arthur Carr, Joe Hardstaff Jr, Charles Harris, Walter Keeton, Wilfred Payton and Willis Walker. Besides Larwood and Voce, Notts had good bowlers in Fred Barratt, Tom Richmond and Sam Staples.
