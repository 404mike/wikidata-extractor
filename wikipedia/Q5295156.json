J. McDowall. He decided that he would prefer a rural practice and accepted a position in July, based at 23 Kirkgate in Thirsk, Yorkshire, near the Yorkshire Dales and the North York Moors. The practice owner, Donald Sinclair, had enlisted in the Royal Air Force (RAF) and was soon to leave for training; he gave Wight all the practice's income in return for looking after it during his absence. (His brother, Brian Sinclair, was not yet a vet.) After Sinclair was discharged from the RAF four months later, he asked Wight to stay permanently with the practice, offering a salaried partnership which Wight accepted.", "Contrary to widespread belief, Wight's books are only partially autobiographical, with many of the stories only loosely based on real events or people. Most of the stories are set in the fictional town of Darrowby, which Wight described as a composite of Thirsk, its nearby market towns Richmond, Leyburn, and Middleham, and 'a fair chunk of my own imagination'. Wight anonymised the majority of his characters by renaming them: notably, he called Donald Sinclair and his brother Brian Siegfried and Tristan Farnon respectively, and used the name Helen Alderson for his wife Joan.", "When Wight's first book was published, Brian Sinclair \"was delighted to be captured as Tristan and remained enthusiastic about all Wight's books\". Donald Sinclair was offended by his portrayal and said, \"Alfred, this book is a real test of our friendship.\" (He never called Wight \"Alf\", mirrored in the books by Siegfried always referring to Herriot as \"James\" rather than \"Jim\".) Things calmed down, however, and the pair continued to work together until they retired. Wight's son stated in The Real James Herriot that Sinclair's character in the novels was considerably toned down, and that Sinclair was even more eccentric than the Herriot books portrayed.", "According to The New York Times, Donald Sinclair actually had more rough edges than the Siegfried character. \"Sinclair\u2019s real-life behaviour was much more eccentric.
