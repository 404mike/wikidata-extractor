But by the end it has transcended itself with great authority. At its core is private suffering, buried and yet painfully exposed. It uses all the tonal stops and tricks of diction at MacNeice's command.\" O'Neill and Reeves conclude that this poem \"addresses an issue of paramount importance to MacNeice and his contemporaries: how to write poetry in an age that demands so much, while remaining true to the self and to poetry, to the poetic self.\""]}, {"page": "List of people from Hampshire", "response": ["*Michael O'Neill, poet, was born in Aldershot"]}]}}
