Griffiths was the first player to be substituted in Hereford United's then-42 year existence in 1966.  Griffiths was a defender who made 250 appearances for the club. One of his most famous appearances was in the FA Cup match between Hereford United and Newcastle United, in which Griffiths played for 80 minutes with a broken leg.  Later, Griffiths played for Worcester City and Cheltenham Town.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Ricky George", "response": ["In January 1971, George was sold to Hereford United where he joined his former Hastings and Barnet teammate Billy Meadows. He took a while to find his feet at Edgar Street under manager John Charles but would soon become involved in arguably the greatest FA Cup shock of all time. Hereford met Newcastle United, of the First Division, in the Third Round at St James' Park and came away with a remarkable 2\u20132 draw. George was the substitute that day, played for the last 20 minutes and provided a cross that Meadows came within inches of converting. The replay at Edgar Street saw George named as the substitute again. When Malcolm Macdonald put Newcastle 1\u20130 up late in the game, George was brought on for the injured Roger Griffiths and played a key part in Hereford's triumph. He won possession on the left wing which ultimately led to Ronnie Radford's famous equalising goal. The game went into extra time and George's fresh legs paid dividends. Controlling a pass from Dudley Tyler on the edge of the area, he turned and shot into the bottom left hand corner of the goal, sparking a pitch invasion. Along with Ronnie Radford, George has become part of FA Cup folklore and his achievement is frequently referred to, particularly in the build-up to the FA Cup Third Round."]}, {"page": "Hereford United 2\u20131 Newcastle United", "response": ["As Newcastle turned up the pressure, Macdonald had a golden chance when he received a pass from Hibbitt and rounded Potter. But somehow he missed an open goal, much to the amusement of the Hereford supporters. He was to make up for this miss soon after when Viv Busby, on the Newcastle right, supplied a deep cross which Macdonald headed in at the far post to finally break the deadlock. With 8 minutes of normal time to go it seemed as if that would be the deciding goal, but Hereford responded by bringing on Ricky George for Roger Griffiths. The Hereford-born full back had broken his leg earlier in the match, but had played on through the pain.", "|DF ||2 || Roger Griffiths || || "]}, {"page": "Roger Griffiths", "response": ["Roger Griffiths (born 6 February 1961) is an English actor who has had several roles in television.
