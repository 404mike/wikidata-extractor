He was a DJ on Radio Luxembourg, and later on the BBC Light Programme, Radio One, and Radio Two.\nHe presented many popular programmes for the BBC, including the Top Ten Game produced by Johnny Beerling, a midweek show which toured the country inviting audiences of 200 to vote for their favourite discs of the week from 1965.  Each week David would play ten new releases, followed by the ten most popular songs from the previous week, together with a Second Chance Disc, which had previously been played but did not register enough votes to make the Top Ten.  The show ran until it was dropped in early 1966.\nAround 1958-1959 he was the host of Manchester-based Granada Television's quiz show Concentration and also hosted the children's quiz show Junior Criss Cross Quiz. In 1969 and 1970, Gell was the commentator for the United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest; he had previously provided the BBC Radio commentary for the 1965 contest.\nGell later presented another 'voting' show for the BBC on Radio Two, namely European Pop Jury, where teenagers from several European countries would sit in judgement of two songs from each participating nation. The programme aired monthly and would typically feature the UK, Ireland, Germany, Spain, Norway, Sweden and Finland.\nDavid had a toned down mid-Atlantic accent, and a warm, professional style, with strong audience rapport. Gell left EPJ and the BBC after his broadcast on 23 July 1977.\nBy 1978 David Gell had returned to broadcasting in his native Canada where he remained until retiring in the 2000s.\nAlthough no longer broadcasting, David is involved with his daughter Rosemary.

On its return, Green renamed it Record and Show Mirror, the majority of space devoted to show business. By the end of 1960 circulation had fallen to 18,000 and Decca Records, the main shareholder, became uneasy. In March 1961, Decca replaced Green with Jimmy Watson, a former Decca press officer. Watson changed the title to New Record Mirror and eliminated show business. Circulation rose, aided by an editorial team of Peter Jones, Ian Dove and Norman Jopling. He brought in freelance columnists James Asman, Benny Green and DJ David Gell to implement a chart coverage including jazz, country and pop music. This eventually included the official UK Top 50 singles, Top 30 LPs and Top 10 EPs, as compiled by Record Retailer. The paper also listed the USA Top 50 singles, compiled by Cash Box, and charts such as the Top 20 singles of five years ago and R&B releases."]}, {"page": "Harold Baim", "response": ["The travelogues are perhaps the best known and best remembered of Baim's output.
