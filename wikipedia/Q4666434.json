The Council had no punitive powers. Its only power was that of publicity, drawing attention to media bias in hopes of the media's taking steps to acknowledge and correct it. Some media outlets were more willing to cooperate with NNC than others. CBS News under president Richard Salant notably supported the Council, including Salant's serving as NNC chairman, but journalists within CBS itself, including Walter Cronkite, did not. Abe Rosenthal of The New York Times was said to have taken some pride in refusing to cooperate with the NNC, saying \"I am against regulation of the press, including self regulation except within each individual newspaper or broadcast station.\" The NNC heard a total of 242 formal complaints during its tenure."]}, {"page": "Abram Rosenthal", "response": ["#REDIRECT Abe Rosenthal"]}]}}
