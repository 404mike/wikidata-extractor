Abel Ferrara: The King of New York. Omnibus Press: 13 A few months later Go Video, the distributors of the already-controversial 1980 Italian film Cannibal Holocaust, in an effort to boost publicity and generate sales that ultimately backfired, wrote anonymously to Mary Whitehouse of the National Viewers' and Listeners' Association complaining about their own film. Whitehouse sparked off a public campaign and coined the term \"video nasty\". Amid the growing concern, The Sunday Times brought the issue to a wider audience in May 1982 with an article entitled \"How High Street Horror is Invading the Home\". Soon the Daily Mail began their own campaign against the distribution of these films. The exposure of \"nasties\" to children began to be blamed for the increase in violent crime amongst youths. The growing media frenzy only served to increase the demand for such material among adolescents. At the suggestion of the National Viewers' and Listeners' Association, the Conservative MP Graham Bright introduced a Private Member's Bill to the House of Commons in 1983. This was passed as the Video Recordings Act 1984 which came into effect on 1 September 1985."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1992 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Graham Bright"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1987 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Graham Bright"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1983 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Graham Bright"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1979 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Graham Bright"]}, {"page": "Parliamentary Private Secretary", "response": ["*Graham Bright: to John Major, 1990\u20131994"]}, {"page": "Splatter film", "response": ["The popularity of the splatter film in the 1970s was met with strong reactions in the US and the U.K. Roger Ebert in the U.S., and Member of Parliament Graham Bright in the U.K., led the charge to censor splatter films on home video with the film critic going after I Spit on Your Grave while the politician sponsored the Video Recordings Act, a system of censorship and certification for home video in the U.K., p.276 This resulted in the outright banning of many splatter films, which were deemed \"video nasties\" in the British press."]}, {"page": "Cambridgeshire Constabulary", "response": ["Prior to 2012, Cambridgeshire Constabulary was overseen by a police authority that comprised 17 members.
