Four teams dominated Welsh national selection at the time, and out of the 15-man team only William Towers and William Bowen of Swansea and Dan Griffiths of Llanelli had been selected. The match was played in Swansea, and the lack of local players may have contributed to a poor crowd, with gate receipts of only \u00a3120 recorded. The crowd's hostility impacted on the players, and debutant Norman Biggs was \"palpably nervous\" at the start of the match. Biggs, aged 18 years and 49 days, became the youngest Welsh international player\u00a0\u2013 a record he held until the debut of Tom Prydie in 2010.

In 1888 Griffiths was part of the Llanelli squad who faced the first touring Southern Hemisphere rugby team, the New Zealand Natives. Griffiths was constant in rushes against the Maoris,Billot (1972), pg 18. and the game was decided by a single long range dropped goal from Llanelli's Harry Bowen. Griffiths was later selected for the Welsh national team, partnered with Newport's Charlie Thomas, in a match against Ireland as part of the 1889 Home Nations Championship. The Welsh team on that day included four Llanelli players, Griffith's team-mates being Tom Morgan, Dan Griffiths and Ned Roberts, all four playing their final international match. The game was played at St. Helen's and the Wales team was captained for the first time by rugby superstar Arthur 'Monkey' Gould. Wales lost the game by two tries to nil and in the next game Griffiths was replaced by William Stadden, and never represented his country again."]}, {"page": "Tom Morgan (rugby union)", "response": ["Morgan was one of a small group of players from Llanelli Rugby Club, who gained international caps in the late 1880s, but played little more than a handful of games. Morgan played just a single game for his country, a home match at St. Helen's in Swansea, against Ireland as part of the 1889 Home Nations Championship. Among the Welsh team on that day were four Llanelli players, though none had been selected for the opening game of the tournament against Scotland. Morgan's club team-mates for that match included Giotto Griffiths, Ned Roberts and Dan Griffiths. This would be the last international game for all four players.

Roberts was not part of the 1888 Wales team that faced the touring New Zealand Natives, but Roberts also failed to make the Llanelli team that faced the same tourists three days prior. In the opening game of the 1889 Home Nations Championship the fullback position was filled by Cardiff's Hugh 'Sawdust' Hughes, but the next game saw Roberts retake his place at fullback. Roberts was one of four Llanelli players that were brought into the squad, but he, Giotto Griffiths, Dan Griffiths and Tom Morgan would never play another international game.
