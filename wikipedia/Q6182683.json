But in November 2012, after a solid start to the season, Meakin left to step up and take the reins at Isthmian League Premier Division side Wingate & Finchley. Former Northwood player Mark Burgess, who had a spell as player-caretaker manager after Mark Barnham's departure in 2010, was appointed as Meakin's successor on 14 November 2012. After several players joined Meakin at Wingate & Finchley, Burgess strengthened his own squad with the short-term loan signings of Brentford duo Terrell Miller and Sam Beale. Burgess then signed both Jerome Federico and George Nicholas on dual registration in early 2013, but was dealt a sizable blow as Northwood lost top scorer Spencer Bellotti to Wingate & Finchley in February 2013, teaming up with former manager Meakin in the process. Northwood finished the 2012/13 campaign in a solid position of 13th, six places and nine points worse than their finish in 2012."]}, {"page": "1992 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 14 May \u2013 Jerome Federico, footballer"]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Wycombe Wanderers F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|26||align=\"left\"|MF||align=\"left\"| Jerome Federico"]}, {"page": "2011\u201312 Stevenage F.C. season", "response": [" Trialists Jerome Federico and Robin Shroot also featured for Stevenage in the match as second-half substitutes.
