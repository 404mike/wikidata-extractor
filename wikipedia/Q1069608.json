Thomas Faed established his career with the interior cottage scene of The Mitherless Bairn (1855). The attention to the detail of everyday life and sentimentality of the characters has meant that these painters have been linked with the Kailyard School of Scottish writing, criticised for producing an over-simplified version of Scottish culture and history. His The Last of the Clan (1865), which depicts highlanders left behind by emigration, is one of the few contemporary artistic depictions of the impact of the Highland Clearances. Faed was probably the starting point for the treatment of the Scottish Cottage genre by later artists Hugh Cameron (1835\u20131918), George Paul Chalmers (1833\u201378) and William McTaggart (1835\u20131910).D. Macmillan, Scottish Art 1460\u20131990 (Edinburgh: Mainstream, 1990), , pp. 186\u20137. Both Chalmers and Cameron combined an influence from Wilkie with an awareness of contemporary Dutch and French painting, with low tones and subdued colour. For Chalmers this can be seen in works such as the interior scene of The Legend (1864\u201367) and for Cameron in the old lady entering a cottage in A Lonely Life. For McTaggart attempts to balance figures and landscape can be seen his depiction of children on a hillside in Spring (1864).M.

Members refer to the club being akin to John Dowie's College, an affectionate name for a tavern in the Old Town which had been demolished three decades earlier but which had a reputation as a meeting place for the artistic community. This implies they met in a bar, but is unclear which one.
