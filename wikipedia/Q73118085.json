He pioneered the introduction and early success of South Wales steam coal in the London and international markets and his coal contracts underpinned Lucy Thomas's reputation as \"the mother of the Welsh steam coal trade\".\nInsole is claimed to have been the first to supply the London market (1830), the international market (Malta, 1831), and the Royal Navy (1831) with South Wales steam coal. Insole was for many years the largest shipper of steam coal at Cardiff.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Taff Vale Railway", "response": ["In October 1835 a meeting of 'the Proprietors of Iron Works, Collieries, and others interested in the Minfral and other Property of the Vallies  of the Taff, Rhondda, Cynon, Bargoed, and other adjacent places, and the Trade of the Town of Merthyr Tydvil and Port of Cardiff' was held at the Castle Inn in Merthyr Tydfil, chaired by John Josiah Guest, the MP for Merthyr.

In 1856 the Old Pit mine was the site of a mining disaster in which 114 men and boys were killed. The official inquest into the deaths found that inadequate ventilation had caused a build up of gas which was ignited by the use of naked flames underground, and the inquest jury brought in an indictment of manslaughter against the mine manager and four officials. However, at the ensuing trial at the Spring Assizes in Swansea in 1857, the cases against two were dismissed, the judge directed the jury to discharge one of the others and advised them to acquit the remaining two, which they did. The Cymmer community seethed with rancour and the bitter feelings lasted for many years.

At that time, Rhondda was a remote, rural backwater. During his lifetime, Williams witnessed the transformation of the valley into a thriving industrial community. Williams received very little formal education and at the age of nine he went to work as a haulier at George Insole & Son's Cymmer Colliery. At the age of sixteen he was sent to a school in Cardiff and two years later became an apprentice carpenter at Pontypridd. After completing his training he returned to the Cymmer Pit to work as a carpenter in 1854\u20135. In 1855 he was married to Mary Evans, daughter of the Rev. Joshua Evans of Cymmer.

Thomas took over the running of her husband Robert's coal mine after his death in 1833. Unusual as it was at the time that a woman ran the business, more unusually she was also illiterate. Business documents held in the Glamorgan Archives show she signed only with an X. Much of Thomas' subsequent success as a businesswoman was embellished by Merthyr historian Charles Wilkins, who wrote one of the few articles on her life. It is now believed that George Insole, a Cardiff agent, was one of the chief architects of her success, though this does not diminish Thomas's position as one of the few women coal owners in industrial Britain. It is recorded that Lucy once attended the Coal Exchange in Cardiff only to be told she could not enter. She sent a male clerk in her employ into the Coal Exchange with a letter informing the establishment that \"My coal is equal to any mans, failure to grant entry will lead to my business lining another's pockets.\"", "In 1824, Robert Thomas took up an annual tenancy from Lord Plymouth for the opening and mining of a small coal level at Waun Wyllt, near Abercanaid, south of Merthyr. The contract forbade Robert Thomas from trading with the four local iron-works which were under the ownership of Lord Plymouth. Although little was expected from the level, it was the first to hit the \"Four Foot Seam\", a rich deposit of high quality steam coal. The mine initially sold its coal to local households in Merthyr and Cardiff, with a tramline being constructed from Thomas's level to the Glamorganshire Canal to allow transportation to Cardiff Docks. Robert shipped his coal along the canal to Merthyr from July 1828 and to Cardiff from February 1829 (in particular, Robert supplied Richard Biddle, a Cardiff trader, from that month). In November 1830, George Insole (in partnership with Biddle) had arranged the shipment of 414 tons of steam coal from Waun Wyllt to London.", "Robert Thomas died in 1833. Lucy Thomas was granted letters of administration for the estate (having co-signed a surety bond with her son William and George Insole). From that time, Insole's payments for the coal dispatched were paid to her. Through Insole, a contract was written with Messrs Wood and Company to supply the London-based coal merchants with a quantity of 3,000 tons of coal per year. These early deals with the London markets helped establish the reputation of Welsh coal and were the basis on which Thomas became known as \"the mother of the Welsh steam coal trade\". Although Thomas was credited with these ventures, it is now believed that much of the success was due to Insole. The embellishment of Thomas's achievements are today attributed to Merthyr historian Charles Wilkins, who wrote an account of Thomas in 1888. Wilkins had a penchant for imaginative touches and his account gives the impression of Thomas as an enterprising woman who looked to set up new markets, whereas evidence now suggests that this work was conducted by her agents. Further research has also shown that coal had been shipped to London from Wales before either of the Thomases began extracting coal from their level, with shipments from Llanelli and Swansea being exported to the capital as early as 1824.
