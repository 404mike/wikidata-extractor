The Grimshaw Club has been described by many as a secret society, however the Club has maintained that it is now fully open and transparent. It is affiliated with the Department of International Relations, yet its membership is open to all students of LSE. Every term, the Grimshaw Club hosts a multitude of high-level speakers, politicians, and ambassadors on the LSE campus and organises trips to embassies and other places in and around London. It also organises special Student Delegations for its members to visit and conduct research in hard-to-access places around the world, including Lebanon, Israel/Palestine, Ukraine, Iran, and Serbia. Its members have also represented the society at international conferences in New York, Berlin, and Shanghai. In 1971, the Grimshaw Club, together with F. S. Northedge, co-founded the peer-reviewed Millennium: Journal of International Studies which publishes articles on international relations three times a year. The Grimshaw Club is also one of the founding members of the Polite\u03caa Community, an international network of student societies which organises annual conferences to debate issues of global governance."]}, {"page": "List of people associated with the London School of Economics", "response": ["* F.
