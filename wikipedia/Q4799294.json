He was the co-partner in the firm Mewes & Davis, with Charles Mew\u00e8s. The firm designed the elevations and interior decoration of the London Ritz Hotel which introduced modern French comfort and luxury enabled by an innovative steel frame construction. In addition, the partnership took on numerous private commissions including Luton Hoo for Sir Julius Wernher, Coombe Court for Countess De Grey and Polesden Lacey for the Hon Mrs Ronald Greville. Prior to World War I, Davis worked on a number of ocean liners such as the Aquitania (1911\u201314); and after his military service he designed a number of banks in London. His last major commission was the Queen Mary (1935).\nIn 1949 he gave his recreations as golf and water-colour sketching.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Regent Street", "response": ["The architect Norman Shaw, then aged 73, was brought in to draw up proposals for the Circus and the Quadrant after early plans were considered unsatisfactory. His scheme was approved in principle but subject to indecision and dispute, both on property acquisition and retailers' demand for bigger display windows. Shaw's design for the Piccadilly Hotel was completed in 1908 with modifications, while the Quadrant was rebuilt by Blomfield, adapting Shaw's designs. The work started in 1923 and was completed by 1928. Significantly, no accommodation was built above any of the retail properties, contributing to the demise of the West End as a place of residence. A limited number of architects were responsible for the redesigned street, including Sir John James Burnet, Arthur Joseph Davis and Henry Tanner."]}, {"page": "1936 in architecture", "response": ["* May 27 \u2013  begins her maiden Atlantic crossing.
