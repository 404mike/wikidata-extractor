Her favorite author was Jean Ingelow and her favorite readings were A Legend of Bregenz and The Judas Tree.  Through writing she was able to gain approval from her family.  Writing was her outlet, and she wrote with an insightful perception about the realities of life.  For example, in her senior year of high school, she wrote a piece called, \"Lulu's Wedding (A True Story)\" in which she recalled the wedding of a family serving girl.  Instead of romanticizing the event, she revealed the true, unromantic, arranged marriage that Lulu went through because the man would take her, even though he was much older."]}, {"page": "Victorian era", "response": ["In the early 1800s, the market for children's literature was dominated by religious groups. Stories from this period often included strong a moral message. But it showed signs of growth and some writers decided to seize the opportunity. By the middle of the century, commercial publishers came to recognise the great potential of this market and signed deals with gifted authors to provide a plethora of reading materials to children. They also took advantage of innovations such as those that enable the printing of coloured illustrations. As the middle class boomed, people had more money to spend on entertaining their children. Moral messaging was de-emphasised in favor of fun. Classics like the tales of the Brothers Grimm and the fairy tales of Hans Christian Andersen made their way to the printing press. But it was Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll that proved to be the most popular, alongside the works of William Makepeace Thackeray, Charles Kingsley, Jean Ingelow, and George Macdonald. By the 1880s, juvenile fiction packed with action and adventure became commonplace. Fantasy did not have a monopoly on the market for children's literature, however. Tom Brown's School Days (1857) by Thomas Hughes was a noteworthy example of realistic writing and school stories while Black Beauty (1877) by Anna Sewell was the start of the blooming of animal tales. As a matter of fact, the market grew so large that most of the top writers of the era wrote at least one book for children. Children's magazines and poetry for children (especially the nonsensical variety) blossomed during the Victorian age."]}, {"page": "Lincolnshire", "response": ["* Jean Ingelow (1820\u20131897), poet"]}, {"page": "List of children's literature writers", "response": ["*Jean Ingelow (1820\u20131897) \u2013 Mopsa the Fairy"]}, {"page": "Boston, Lincolnshire", "response": ["* Boston was the birthplace of the 19th-century author and poet Jean Ingelow.", "140px|thumb|Jean Ingelow", "* Jean Ingelow (1820\u20131897) poet and novelist"]}, {"page": "Andrew Lang", "response": ["* Select Poems of Jean Ingelow (1908) editor"]}, {"page": "1898 in literature", "response": ["*July 20 \u2013 Jean Ingelow, English poet and novelist (born 1820)"]}, {"page": "1897 in literature", "response": ["*July 20 \u2013 Jean Ingelow, English novelist and poet (born 1820)"]}, {"page": "1869 in literature", "response": ["*Jean Ingelow \u2013 Mopsa the Fairy"]}, {"page": "1865 in literature", "response": ["*Jean Ingelow \u2013 Stories Told to a Child"]}, {"page": "1863 in literature", "response": ["*Jean Ingelow \u2013 \"The Prince's Dream\" (short story)"]}, {"page": "1820 in literature", "response": ["*March 17 \u2013 Jean Ingelow, English poet and novelist (died 1897)"]}, {"page": "1571 in literature", "response": ["**A tidal wave affects parts of Lincolnshire, England.
