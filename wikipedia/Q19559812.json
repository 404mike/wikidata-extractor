Both parents were from trading and artisan families in Cromarty. His father died in a shipwreck in 1807, and he was brought up by his mother and uncles. He was educated in a parish school where he reportedly showed a love of reading. At 17 he was apprenticed to a stonemason, and his work in quarries, together with walks along the local shoreline, led him to the study of geology. In 1829 he published a volume of poems, and soon afterwards became involved in political and religious controversies, first connected to the Reform Bill, and then with the division in the Church of Scotland which led to the Disruption of 1843.", "thumb|240px|The grave of Hugh Miller, Grange Cemetery", "His son Hugh Miller FRSE (1850-1896), who was six years old when his father killed himself, lies on his left side.", "The BP-operated Miller oilfield in the North Sea was named after Hugh Miller.
