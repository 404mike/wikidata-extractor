Throughout the video, there are crucifixes, angelic symbols, a skull reminiscent of Damien Hirst's famous sculpture For the Love of God and often Baphomet. During part of the music video, the music stops, and the audience sees producer Swizz Beatz with his back to them as he seemingly makes the symbol with his coat by raising his hands. Jay-Z appears wearing a leather jacket and sunglasses. There is a cameo appearance by Colin Bailey, better known as Drums of Death, who is known for his skull face paint. In the video, Bailey appears to be perplexed, confused, and/or mad. At approximately three minutes and thirty nine seconds into the video, there are two bullets on either side of a crucifix.
