The group's first single, \"What We Got (It's Hot)\", showcased a lively R&B-based dance sound, and led to the group touring with The Real Thing, Roy Ayers and Grover Washington Jr.. Nonetheless, follow-up single \"Sticks & Stones\" flopped and the band altered their musical style for their February 1981 single \"(You Know) You Can Do It\", which became their first UK hit. With these singles, the group became pioneers of the early 1980s Britfunk sound, alongside Imagination, Light of the World and other groups."]}]}}
