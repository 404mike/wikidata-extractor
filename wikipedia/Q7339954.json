Following three loan spells with Grimsby he joined the club on a permanent basis in 2009 before signing with Fleetwood Town two years later. He later played for Accrington Stanley before dropping into Non-League football in 2015 and has since turned out for Guiseley, Bradford Park Avenue, Spennymoor Town and Grantham Town.

He joined the club on an initial loan deal until 3 January and was Mike Newell's first signing as the new manager of the club. In his first game back he scored Grimsby's only goal in a 2\u20131 defeat against Darlington. It was announced in late December, Newell's desire to sign Kalala on a permanent basis along with fellow loanees Adam Proudlock and Rob Atkinson. On 9 January 2009, Kalala began to hold talks over a permanent switch back to the club. Newell had hoped the further acquisitions of fellow French speaking players Jean-Louis Akpa Akpro and Mickael Buscher would sway his decision to re-join the club permanently. However, due to the club's current low league position, Kalala snubbed a permanent contract, but did however extend his loan stay with the North East Lincolnshire club until the end of the season. Little under two months later, Kalala got injured, forcing him to spend the last two months of the season on the sidelines. He played 21 times in his loan spell, scoring twice. His final game for the club was on 11 March 2009, in a 2\u20131 defeat against Chesterfield."]}, {"page": "Justin Whittle", "response": ["Despite the club struggling in the league, Whittle was voted \"Player of The Season\" for his efforts and earned himself a 1-year contract extension. It was apparent from the start of the following season that Whittle was to play a smaller or less important role in the club's affairs. The number 6 shirt he had held since he arrived was stripped of him and he was listed as number 15 in the squad. Fitness and injury worries plagued Whittle and when fit, he was often named as a substitute playing second fiddle to the likes of Nick Fenton, Ryan Bennett and Rob Atkinson. As well as this Whittle was not used in the club's Wembley appearance in the Football League Trophy final in March. In April 2008 it was decided by the club that they would not offer Justin Whittle an extension to his contract and he left on good terms in May after playing some of his best football with the Mariners."]}, {"page": "Matthew Heywood", "response": ["On 25 June 2008, Heywood turned down a fresh contract at Griffin Park, and signed a two-year contract with Grimsby Town. He was named Grimsby's club captain for the 2008\u201309 season by his new manager Alan Buckley, but the Mariners began to struggle in the league, and Buckley was dismissed early on into the new campaign. Following increasingly worrying poor performances from Heywood, Buckley's replacement as manager, Mike Newell opted to re-sign former Grimsby centre back Rob Atkinson to replace Matt in defence. The club captaincy was also given to youngster Ryan Bennett. Heywood would only make 18 appearances for Grimsby in his first season and spent a good chunk of that sat on the substitutes bench. During the 2009\u201310 season, Heywood continued to struggle in the sense of finding any way into the first-team, and failed to even make the bench on a regular basis, even under the club's new manager Neil Woods. On 13 January 2010, Woods told Heywood, along with Danny Boshell, Barry Conlon and Jamie Clarke that they were free to leave the club in the January transfer window, this following Heywood only featuring once in the season, playing in a 4\u20130 away defeat against Port Vale in September 2009. On 1 February 2010, Heywood along with Clarke and Boshell were released from the club."]}, {"page": "Darran Kempson", "response": ["On 3 June 2010.

This was down to the fact that the new signing Matthew Heywood, who had also been designated the new club captain had fallen out of favour following several unconvincing performances, and Newell had preferred a youthful back pairing of Bennett and Rob Atkinson to the veteran duo of Heywood and Richard Hope. Bennett was ever present for the club during the 2008\u201309 season, and his consistently solid performances throughout a very difficult season for Grimsby saw Bennett win firstly the PFA Player of the Month for February, which would eventually be followed by several club accolades. He swept the board at the GTFC Player of the Year ceremony in May 2009, claiming the \"Supporters Player of the Year\" award, ~\"Supporters Young Player of the year\" as well as many other minor awards. Newell made repeated reference to Bennett's professionalism and maturity, and his unflappable playing style in particular was impressive for such a young defender, whilst his height made him an asset at set pieces. Also Bennett was described as comfortable on the ball."]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 Grimsby Town F.C. season", "response": ["| Rob Atkinson", "| Rob Atkinson", "|25||  Rob Atkinson || Barnsley || 21 || Loan", "|25||  Rob Atkinson || Barnsley || 21 || Free Transfer"]}, {"page": "2007\u201308 Grimsby Town F.C. season", "response": ["|25 ||  Rob Atkinson || Barnsley || 20 || Loan"]}, {"page": "Scott Garner", "response": ["On 12 May 2011 Garner and fellow Grimsby defender Rob Atkinson were called up for England C duty to play against Portugal on the 19th."]}, {"page": "2008 Football League Trophy Final", "response": ["|CB ||25||Rob Atkinson "]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Grimsby Town F.C. season", "response": ["They faced Stockport County in their next pre-season match and were beaten one-nil, they were without skipper Ryan Bennett, Rob Atkinson and Danny North, in a well worked play eight minutes into the second half, Poole slotted the ball under Grimsby's Nick Colgan.
