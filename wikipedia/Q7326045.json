Green also represented England at junior levels on several occasions.  He was born in Warrington, Cheshire.  For a number of years, Green has played for Cheshire side Grappenhall, occasionally alongside former teammates Steven Titchard and Neil Fairbrother.  He is the team's star batsman and never bowls, presumably because of an injury that may also have played its part in the early conclusion of his county career,", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Richard Green", "response": ["* Richard Green (actor) (born 1953), American actor", "* Richard Green or Grass Green (1939\u20132002), African American cartoonist", "* Richard Greene (1918\u20131985), British film and television actor", "* H.
