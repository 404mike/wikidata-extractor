Mansour also suggested that al-Sistani was not aware of contemporary problems in Iraq or of prevailing post-war conditions, and he alleged that Sistani's edicts were, largely, written and disseminated by aides. At another point, Mansour asked Khalsi whether the United States was using Iraqi politicians, and also al-Sistani, to promote Western interests in Iraq."]}, {"page": "List of talk show hosts", "response": ["| Ahmed Mansour ||  Egypt || Bela Hodod"]}, {"page": "Youssef Nada", "response": ["In an interview on al-Jazeera,Interview of Youssef Nada on Al Jazeera website Nada himself vehemently denied any such thing to have occurred An instance of al-Jazeera's regular talk program, Century Witness, presented by Ahmed Mansour; several interviews from 4 August 2002 until 29 September 2002 citing that well-known hatred between the individuals made such a meeting implausible.

Al-Julani mentioned that al-Nusra have no plans for attacking Western targets, and that their priority is focused on fighting the Syrian regime, Hezbollah, and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Al-Julani is credited with saying that the \"Nusra Front doesn\u2019t have any plans or directives to target the West. We received clear orders from Ayman al-Zawahiri not to use Syria as a launching pad to attack the U.S. or Europe in order to not sabotage the true mission against the regime. Maybe Al-Qaeda does that but not here in Syria. Assad forces are fighting us on one end, Hezbollah on another and ISIL on a third front. It is all about their mutual interests\"."]}]}}
