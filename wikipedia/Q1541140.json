They observed that some have described it as \"a conscious spoof of bad science fiction. On the other hand, it could just be bad science fiction.\" In The Television Companion (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker wrote that the setting was fleshed out but not developed enough. They also criticised the characters, acting, dialogue, and direction, though they praised Geoffrey Bayldon as Organon and Myra Frances as Adrasta. In 2011, Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times criticised the monster, but was positive towards Barry's direction and some of the \"vivid characters,\" though he noted the bandits and minor characters were lacking. DVD Talks John Sinnott gave The Creature from the Pit three and a half out of five stars. He described it as having \"the right mixture of humor and drama,\" although the monster was a let-down. While Sinnott praised Baker, he criticised Ward, saying she had not yet grown into the role of Romana. Cliff Chapman of Den of Geek was also more positive, giving it four out of five stars and highlighting the acting, dialogue, and visual quality aside from the realisation of Erato."]}, {"page": "Alison Steadman", "response": ["Steadman starred with Myra Frances in Girl, a 1974 BBC play in the Second City Firsts series, performing the first lesbian kiss on British television.\"Alison Steadman: Britain's lady-in-waiting\", The Sunday Times, 30 November 2008"]}, {"page": "LGBT rights in the United Kingdom", "response": ["Following the Sexual Offences Act 1967, BBC television representation increased.
