In his first season at The Dell he made 33 Southern League appearances and helped the \"Saints\" to reach the FA Cup Semi Finals where they went out to Wolverhampton Wanderers, beating First Division Everton en route. He remained with Southampton for four seasons during which the team struggled in a vain attempt to regain their former success. Johnston was a \"distinct individual; through all the heat and bustle of the game he was never seen without a blade of grass or some convenient substitute protruding from his mouth.\" He had a strange gait but was a natural leader and tended to coach the forwards while the game was in progress."]}, {"page": "Frank Costello (footballer)", "response": ["He made his professional debut on 14 September 1907, scoring in a 2\u20130 victory at Luton Town.

Described as \"a trifle slow, he was clever with the ball and had a habit of disconcerting the opposition by making for goal when he was expected to make a pass\".
