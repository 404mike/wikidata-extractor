Green began his career in 1956, playing in a skiffle trio \"The Wayfaring Strangers\" with Johnny Spence and Frank Farley, who came second in a bands competition to The Quarrymen. The trio then all joined Red-E-Lewis and the Redcaps, who became the Redcaps, backing Cuddly Dudley, when Reddy Lewis left. Spence, Farley and Green joined Johnny Kidd & the Pirates in 1962, but then Green left to join Billy J. Kramer with The Dakotas in 1964. His ability to play lead and rhythm guitar simultaneously influenced a number of British guitarists to follow, including Pete Townshend and Wilko Johnson, the original guitarist for Dr. Feelgood. Green's song \"Oyeh!\" was on Dr. Feelgood's debut album, Down by the Jetty; and a song he co-wrote, \"Going Back Home\" appeared on Dr. Feelgood's 1975 Malpractice and the live album, Stupidity (1976). Green was also a member of the band Shanghai, which released two albums, in 1974 and 1976, other members included, Chuck Bedford (vocals, harmonica, 1974\u20131975), Pete Kircher (drums, vocals), Mike Le Main (bass, keyboards, 1974\u20131975), Cliff Bennett of Cliff Bennett and the Rebel Rousers (vocals, 1975\u20131976), Brian Alterman (guitar, 1975\u20131976), Pat King (bass, 1975\u20131976)."]}, {"page": "Johnny Kidd & the Pirates", "response": ["A new Pirate trio was recruited.

Patto soon left and was replaced by Mick Green (lead guitar), who had also backed Dudley. The new line-up's first single with Kidd, \"A Shot Of Rhythm And Blues\" (coupled with \"I Can Tell\") managed to break Kidd's dry spell, entering the lower reaches of the chart toward the end of 1962. In retrospect this disc, which debuted Green's unique playing style incorporating alternating lead and rhythm guitar figures, can be viewed as the sonic bridge marking the transition of British rock and roll into British Beat."]}, {"page": "Oh Boy!

Ray would give a wonderful forced laugh after each joke.
