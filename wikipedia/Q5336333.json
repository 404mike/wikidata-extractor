He won two caps for the England national football team in 1914 and was part of the Burnley side which won the FA Cup against Liverpool in 1914. He served with the British Army in Salonika during the First World War, before returning to Burnley in 1919. He was forced to retire from professional football in November 1922 due to a serious illness and subsequently returned to his hometown of Southport to work as a schoolteacher.\nHe was the last surviving pre-World War I England international, dying some 65 years after senior football was suspended following the outbreak of World War I, although he was outlived by a number of pre-World War I players to have seen Football League action; including some who survived in the 1990s.\nEddie was inducted into the Southport FC Hall of Fame on 16 November 2019. Grandson Gary Mosscrop accepted the award on behalf of his family from club historian Michael Braham.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Southport", "response": ["* Eddie Mosscrop, footballer"]}, {"page": "Turf Moor", "response": ["The stadium was used for a game between the Football League XI and the Scottish Football League XI in 1914; the Scots beat their English counterparts 3\u20132. The Football League team included Burnley players Teddy Hodgson, Eddie Mosscrop and Tommy Boyle; the latter scored from a penalty kick. In 1922, Turf Moor hosted its only FA Cup semi-final, and in 1927, the ground staged its only senior international fixture when England played Wales. England B and England's junior sides have also played at the stadium on several occasions, at under-21, under-20 and schoolboy levels. Turf Moor was one of the venues for the 1983 UEFA European Under-18 Championship and hosted the group stage match between Czechoslovakia and West Germany.Simpson (2007), p. 581 The England women's team played their first match at Turf Moor in September 2003 against Australia, which was the stadium's first international women's game. The ground hosted several women's charity matches in the early 1920s; the first was in March 1920, when Dick Kerr's Ladies played Liverpool Ladies in aid of the National Association of Discharged Sailors and Soldiers.Simpson (2007), pp. 579\u2013581"]}, {"page": "1914 FA Cup Final", "response": ["|MF || || Eddie Mosscrop"]}, {"page": "Bert Freeman", "response": ["In 1912\u201313, Freeman at first struggled to maintain his form of the previous season, but in a run of ten straight League victories between November 1912 and January 1913 Freeman scored fifteen goals, representing an emphatic return to form. Haworth was by now building a team not just to gain promotion but to secure the club's place in the top division and, having already recruited Tommy Boyle from Barnsley the previous year to strengthen the defence, he signed winger Eddie Mosscrop in September 1912, followed by the signing of three players from Gainsborough Trinity in February (following an F.A. Cup tie between the two clubs), including goalkeeper Ronnie Sewell. These players were to form the core of the Burnley side over the next few years and all were future England internationals. By mid-February, Burnley were top of the table and Freeman scored twice to defeat First Division Middlesbrough in the third round of the cup to set up a tie at local rivals Blackburn Rovers, where a single goal from Boyle saw them through to a semi-final against Sunderland. A 0\u20130 draw on 29 March at Bramall Lane preceded a replay at St Andrew's which saw Burnley lose 3\u20132. The FA Cup run had distracted Burnley from the league, and they had slipped into second place. They were able to hold onto the runners-up position and Freeman was again the league's top scorer with 31 goals from 37 appearances as Burnley eventually secured their return to the top flight after an absence of 13 years, finishing second in the table behind Preston North End. The success of Freeman and Burnley led to calls for him to be selected again for England, but these were ignored by the England selectors who opted for George Elliott and then Harry Hampton at centre-forward, and Freeman's England career ended with three goals in five appearances of which four were won with one draw."]}, {"page": "Ernest Bradshaw", "response": ["Bradshaw was unable to properly break into the first team at Turf Moor and made only one league appearance in the 1911\u201312 season, covering for left-winger Jack Harris in the 1\u20130 win against Nottingham Forest on 10 February 1912. He started the first game of the following campaign, but despite the team beating Glossop 2\u20131 he was dropped for the next match along with Tommy Boyle, Jack Picken and Eddie Mosscrop. After almost seven months in the reserves, Bradshaw returned to the starting line-up for five of the last six fixtures of the season.

The first leg was won 6\u20132 at Turf Moor thanks to goals from Eddie Mosscrop, Joe Anderson, Benny Cross and a hat-trick from Bob Kelly, before strikes from Joe Anderson and James Lindsay gave Burnley a 2\u20130 win at Ewood Park. This success was followed by a 2\u20131 friendly victory over a Scottish Football League XI in a benefit match for Celtic winger Patsy Gallacher. Burnley also participated in the Lancashire Senior Cup; the league matches against Blackburn Rovers and Preston North End also counted as group stage matches in the competition. The team won all four of these games to qualify for the semi-finals, where they were drawn against Manchester City. The game on 9 May 1921 ended in a 0\u20132 defeat for Burnley, and their opponents went on to win the trophy that year.", "|align=\"left\"|Eddie Mosscrop"]}]}}
