On 28 April, the Lions were officially relegated to League One following Rotherham United's 2\u20131 win against Reading, however, Harris was confirmed as Millwall's permanent manager less than 24 hours later, with his assistant being his 2004 FA Cup Final teammate, David Livermore."]}, {"page": "David Knight (English footballer)", "response": ["Knight moved to Conference Premier side Histon in February 2010 on a one-and-a-half-year contract following a two-week trial. He made his debut in a 1\u20130 defeat to Rushden & Diamonds on 3 March 2010 and he finished the 2009\u201310 season with 12 appearances for Histon. Despite being told he had a future with Histon, Knight joined York City on a two-week trial in July with a view to signing on a season-long loan. Illness resulted in him missing York's pre-season friendly with Hull City although he later played one half of York's 2\u20130 defeat to Barnsley, with manager Martin Foyle saying he \"did well\". After playing in the 1\u20130 friendly victory over Morecambe Foyle said he was interested in signing Knight. He eventually signed for the club on 30 July. His debut came in a 2\u20131 victory over Forest Green Rovers on 22 January 2011 as Michael Ingham was serving a one-match suspension. This proved to be his only appearance for the club. With another year remaining on his Histon contract, he was unsure of his future at the club after returning, while player-manager David Livermore said he intended to transfer Knight from the club. He was handed a free transfer by the club and allowed to talk to other clubs."]}, {"page": "Omer Riza", "response": ["On 22 January 2010, he left Shrewsbury Town after struggling to break into the first team during the first half of the season, with Riza and the club coming to an agreement regarding paying off the rest of his contract.

Following the appointment of David Livermore as manager at Histon, Riza joined Histon on a non-contract basis and made his debut against Kettering Town in a Conference National fixture on 28 August. He scored his first goal for Histon when he scored a penalty in their league match against Hayes & Yeading United, which turned out to be the winning goal. Due to the financial cost of his wages, Histon released Riza in January 2012, giving him seven days notice to leave the club."]}, {"page": "2004 FA Cup Final", "response": ["Manchester United went 2\u20130 up 20 minutes into the second half, when Ryan Giggs went on a run down the right wing into the Millwall box only to be brought down by David Livermore. Referee Jeff Winter awarded a penalty for the foul and Ruud van Nistelrooy scored with a powerful shot into the top-corner to the goalkeeper's right. United now held a comfortable advantage and Millwall struggled to find a way back into the match. United's defence kept Neil Harris and Tim Cahill at bay, and the Red Devils eventually scored a third when Giggs went on a run down the left and crossed for Van Nistelrooy to tap in from three yards out. There were suggestions that Van Nistelrooy was offside at the moment of Giggs' pass, but television replays showed his feet were grounded in an onside position.", "|CM ||8 || David Livermore"]}, {"page": "Marvin Williams (footballer)", "response": ["Williams began his career at Millwall at the age of 9 and progressed through the club's youth system.

Williams scored his first professional goal on 2 January 2006, the winner in a 2\u20131 home victory against Derby County, controlling David Livermore's pass before beating Lee Camp in the Derby goal. Five days later, Williams signed his first professional contract with Millwall, just hours before the club's FA Cup tie against Premier League club Everton. Williams subsequently made his first start against Everton, scoring just before half-time in a 1\u20131 draw. He later described the goal as one of the highlights of his career. He scored his third goal for Millwall in the club's 2\u20131 victory against Luton Town at The Den on 4 March 2006. Williams' goal came in injury-time, one which was described as \"priceless\" due to Millwall's precarious league position.

Neither club made a breakthrough in the remainder of the match, which went to a penalty shoot-out. Luton's on-loan goalkeeper from Derby County, Lewis Price, saved from Jason Jarrett and Chris Birchall to take Luton into the final against Scunthorpe United on 5 April at Wembley Stadium.
