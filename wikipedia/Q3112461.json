Gregory immediately bought in Newcastle pair Warren Barton and Rob Lee, and recorded three wins and a creditable 2\u20132 draw with Manchester United in his first seven games. The third of these wins, 3\u20131 away to Bolton Wanderers looked like pointing towards survival, but it proved to be Derby's last win of the season as they proceeded to lose their next seven games on the trot, the sixth of which, 0\u20132 at Liverpool, confirmed relegation after a 6-year stay in the top flight.
