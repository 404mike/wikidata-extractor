Notably, the hated new Poor Law Amendment was passed in 1834, depriving working people of outdoor relief and driving the poor into workhouses, where families were separated. The massive wave of opposition to this measure in the north of England in the late 1830s made Chartism a mass movement.

The founders were  William Lovett, Francis Place and Henry Hetherington.  They were associated with Owenite socialism and the movement for general education. They published a People\u2019s Charter on 8 May 1838 calling for universal suffrage. The London Working Men's Association was aware of the unrest in the Canadas in early 1837, and themselves petitioned the British Parliament after a public meeting to protest the \"base proposals of the Whigs to destroy the principle of Universal Suffrage in the Canadas\". To implement the Chartist plan, they called a series of mass meetings across the country in the summer of 1838 to select delegates to a \"General Convention of the Industrious Classes\". After the General Convention of the Industrious Classes met in May 1839, their Charter petition was rejected by Parliament. This rejection led to the Newport Uprising of 1839 in Wales, suppressed by Sir Francis Bond Head's cousin, Sir Edmund Walker Head.  Rather than view each rebellion in isolation, the Newport Rising (1839), the two Canadian Rebellions (1837\u201338) and the subsequent American Patriot War (1838\u201339) can be seen to share a similar republican impetus. They should all be viewed in the context of the late-18th- and early-19th-century Atlantic revolutions that  took their inspiration from the republicanism of the American Revolution."]}, {"page": "Lovett (surname)", "response": ["*William Lovett (1800\u20131877), British activist"]}, {"page": "John Humffreys Parry", "response": ["In politics Parry was a Radical\u2014or advanced liberal\u2014and at the time of the first Chartist movement he sympathised with some of their moderate views, and knew many of their leaders: William Lovett mentioned assistance received from him. Parry was also one of the founders of the Complete Suffrage Association in 1842."]}, {"page": "Chartism in Wales", "response": ["Chartism originated in Wales in Carmarthen under the influence of Hugh Williams, a solicitor and radical reformer. Williams claimed he \"got up the first radical meeting in south Wales\" in the autumn of 1836 when he founded Carmarthen Working Men's Association. This followed on from the foundation the previous year of the London Working Men's Association by William Lovett and Henry Hetherington, Hetherington was a friend of Hugh Williams and is likely to have influenced his activities in south Wales. The People's Charter, embodying six points, was published in May 1838, with an address by Lovett and Hetherington. It became the focus of widespread meetings in support of its objectives throughout Britain. The People's Charter was later published in Welsh increasing the movement's appeal in Welsh-speaking areas. Chartism in Wales reached its climax in November 1839 with the Newport Rising and subsequent treason trial of Chartist leaders."]}]}}
