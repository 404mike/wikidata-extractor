The Miseries were written as a series of discussions between Mr Samuel Sensitive and Mr Timothy Testy, in which they catalogue the daily \"injuries, insults, disappointments and treacheries\" of everyday life.

In 1794, when he had finally received one, he was so impressed by it that he made his own rendering, William and Helen, in less than a day. Scott's version was passed from hand to hand, and was extremely well received. In 1796, three new English translations were published by William Robert Spencer, Henry James Pye and John Thomas Stanley. Translations by James Beresford and Dante Gabriel Rossetti were published in 1800 and 1844, respectively, and both have been hailed as the most faithful translations of B\u00fcrger's original work."]}, {"page": "Beresford (name)", "response": ["*James Beresford (disambiguation), several people including \u2013", "**James Beresford (writer) (1764\u20131840), British clergyman and writer", "**James Beresford (baseball) (born 1989), Australian baseball player", "**James Beresford (footballer), English footballer"]}, {"page": "James Beresford", "response": ["James Beresford may refer to:", "*James Beresford (writer) (1764\u20131840), British writer and clergyman", "*James Beresford (baseball) (born 1989), Australian baseball player", "*James Beresford (footballer) ( 1880), English footballer"]}, {"page": "An Aspirant", "response": ["#Redirect James Beresford (writer)"]}, {"page": "Ignato Secundo", "response": ["#Redirect James Beresford (writer)"]}, {"page": "Samuel Sensitive", "response": ["#Redirect James Beresford (writer)"]}, {"page": "Timothy Testy", "response": ["#Redirect James Beresford (writer)"]}]}}
