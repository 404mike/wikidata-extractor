After possessing the body of the Keeper, he acquires control over the Dark Matrix, the repository of all of the Time Lords' most evil impulses, and tries to use it to take revenge on the Doctor. To this end, he travels to London in 1888, taking on the identity of Jack the Ripper, and using the Ripper murders as sacrifices to power the Dark Matrix, believing that he can use and control the Matrix to grant himself a true existence independent of the Doctor. Once it has enough power, the Dark Matrix will be unleashed on the world, creating a dystopian nightmare and corrupting history forever. As an added bonus, the Valeyard has tracked down all thirteen incarnations of the Doctor, using the influence of the Dark Matrix to corrupt each Doctor into dark and twisted versions of themselves (notably resulting in the First Doctor murdering other Time Lords during his escape from Gallifrey, the Fourth Doctor destroying the Daleks at their creation, and the Fifth Doctor using bat's milk to cure himself from spectrox poisoning while leaving Peri to succumb to the toxin in his place), using their corrupted spirits to animate golems to do his work. However, the Seventh Doctor escapes the Valeyard's attack by sealing his conscious mind away from the assault in the TARDIS telepathic circuits, although this briefly leaves him as nothing more than an amnesic cardsharp who calls himself \"Johnny\". Having regained his memory after retrieving the circuits, the Doctor confronts the Valeyard (now calling himself \"the Ripper\" on the grounds that the name is more evocative) in a church where the Ripper has left his TARDIS, now reprogrammed into the appearance of the Doctor's tomb, causing his foe to lose control of the Dark Matrix, provoking it by revealing that the Dark Matrix is just as trapped under the Valeyard's control as it was on Gallifrey. The Valeyard is eventually killed by a lightning bolt being generated by his damaged TARDIS as it collapses while the Dark Matrix tries to escape, his body disappearing as the spirits of the other twelve Doctors seemingly depart in spectral versions of the TARDIS around the Seventh, and history is restored to normal."]}, {"page": "Telos Doctor Who novellas", "response": ["|Companion Piece || Robert Perry and Mike Tucker || Rev Colin Midlane || Allan Bednar || Seventh || Catherine Broome || December 2003"]}, {"page": "Past Doctor Adventures", "response": ["|5 || Illegal Alien || Mike Tucker and Robert Perry || 7th || Ace || October 1997", "|16 || Matrix || Mike Tucker and Robert Perry || 7th || Ace || October 1998", "|23 || Storm Harvest || Mike Tucker and Robert Perry || 7th || Ace || June 1999", "|60 || Loving the Alien || Mike Tucker and Robert Perry || 7th || Ace || May 2003"]}, {"page": "Jack the Ripper in fiction", "response": ["*Matrix (1998) by Mike Tucker and Robert Perry"]}, {"page": "Heritage (novel)", "response": ["* The story forms part of an ongoing story arc planned by Mike Tucker and Robert Perry, involving the apparent death of Ace.

However, the Virgin New Adventures established after the end of the original series that Ace's last name was McShane, and Tucker's change was interpreted as an attempt to remove the New Adventures from the nebulous Doctor Who canon.
