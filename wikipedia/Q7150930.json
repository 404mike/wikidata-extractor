His research ranges widely over the field of condensed matter physics, including soft matter, disordered systems, nanoscience and superconductivity. Goldbart is currently provost of Stony Brook University. He previously served as Dean of the College of Natural Sciences at The University of Texas at Austin, Dean of the College of Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology, and as the director of the Institute for Condensed Matter Theory.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign", "response": ["In 2007, the university-hosted research Institute for Condensed Matter Theory (ICMT) was launched, with the director Paul Goldbart and the chief scientist Anthony Leggett.

He received  a B.Sc. in physics from Hindu College, University of Delhi in  1984. He enrolled in the doctoral program in  physics at the State University of New York at Stony Brook and began working under the supervision of Steven Kivelson. Around 1988\u201389, Sondhi moved with his advisor to the University of California, Los Angeles, where he received his PhD in 1992. He spent three years as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (formally under the joint supervision of Gordon Baym, Eduardo Fradkin, Paul Goldbart, and Michael Stone at what is now the Institute for Condensed Matter Theory), before taking up an assistant professorship at Princeton in 1995. At Princeton, Sondhi was promoted to associate professor in 2001, and to professor of physics in 2005. He served as a Senior Fellow of the Princeton Center for Theoretical Science (which he co-founded) from 2006\u201308. Sondhi remained at Princeton until 2021, when he was appointed to the Wykeham Professorship at the University of Oxford, succeeding David Sherrington."]}, {"page": "Goldbart, Paul", "response": ["#redirectPaul Goldbart"]}]}}
