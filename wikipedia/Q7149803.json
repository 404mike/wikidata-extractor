Dicks planned to use Garland in a strike partnership with target man Paul Cheesley, but a severe injury to Cheesley meant that Garland had to play as the target man centre-forward despite his small stature. He initially struggled in the role, but Dicks had no other suitable replacements other than Tom Ritchie, who also was not a natural centre-forward. Despite a tough end-of-season schedule City managed to pick up enough to points to narrowly avoid relegation in 1976\u201377, with Garland scoring winning goals against Leeds United and Liverpool."]}, {"page": "Cheesley", "response": ["#REDIRECT Paul Cheesley"]}, {"page": "PFA Team of the Year (1970s)", "response": ["!scope=row|Paul Cheesley"]}, {"page": "Cheesley, Paul", "response": ["#redirectPaul Cheesley"]}, {"page": "Coventry City 2\u20132 Bristol City (1977)", "response": ["Bristol City had been promoted to the top flight from the Second Division in the 1975\u201376 season, finishing second behind Sunderland. They started the 1976\u201377 campaign with a surprise win against Arsenal at Highbury followed by a draw against Stoke City and a victory over Sunderland. The good start was tainted by a career-ending injury to striker Paul Cheesley against Stoke, and a  defeat against Manchester City marked the start of a dramatic fall down the table from second to twentieth between September and October. Lacking a quality forward, Bristol City failed to score goals and their slide down the table included a run of six defeats with only two goals scored. Their manager Alan Dicks was unable to find a striker on the transfer market, but his signing of veteran Leeds United defender Norman Hunter briefly revived the club's fortunes. Wins over Tottenham Hotspur and Norwich City took them briefly out of the relegation zone to 17th place, but Bristol City's form was poor after Christmas. Although they achieved a second win of the season against Arsenal, they suffered defeat to then-bottom-placed Sunderland at Roker Park, and a run of just one win in nine games up to early April left Bristol City themselves at the bottom of the table. A better run followed, including another win over Tottenham, and a surprise win over Liverpool at Ashton Gate in the penultimate game left Bristol City needing only a draw against Coventry to guarantee survival."]}]}}
