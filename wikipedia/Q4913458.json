Ahead of Burnley's first home match of the season against Everton at Turf Moor, Potts wrote in the club's matchday programme: \"We pride ourselves on being a footballing team and no club can be more eager to meet the demand for better play. That being so strongly ingrained in our intentions we confidently anticipate providing you with good displays\".Quelch (2015), p. 74 The team defeated Everton 5\u20132, with two goals from Connelly, and one each from Pilkington, Pointer and Robson. A 3\u20131 defeat at home against West Ham United followed, despite taking the lead through Connelly, before Everton were beaten 2\u20131 in the reverse fixture after being 1\u20130 down. Burnley's form remained inconsistent: a 4\u20131 away loss against Chelsea was followed by two 2\u20131 wins at home against Preston North End and West Bromwich Albion, after coming from behind on both occasions. McIlroy picked up an injury against West Brom, after he landed on his shoulder following a hard challenge from Maurice Setters.Quelch (2015), pp. 87\u201388 Potts had selected the same starting line-up for the first seven matches, but he made several changes to his side before the reverse fixture against local rivals Preston on 15 September: McIlroy was replaced by Billy White, while Bobby Seith had contacted giant urticaria and was replaced by Cummings, leaving the left-back position open for the 18-year old Elder to make his debut.Simpson (2007), p. 295 Burnley lost the fixture 1\u20130 but Elder played well against his opponent Tom Finney and remained in the starting line-up."]}]}}
