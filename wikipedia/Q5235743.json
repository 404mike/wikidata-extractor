He currently fronts the live coverage on Super Sunday and Monday Night Football.\nJones went to Stokesley Comprehensive School in North Yorkshire. He became a presenter on Sky Sports News in February 2003 after spending two seasons as a pitch-side reporter on Premiership Plus. Starting his journalistic career as a news reporter on the Derbyshire Times in Chesterfield, he joined Sky for the launch of Sky Sports News in 1998, presenting alongside Georgie Thompson for a number of years.  Jones presented The Football League on Sky Sports from the 2007\u201308 season until 2011. Jones started presenting live Premier League matches in 2010.\nStarting in 2012, Jones was announced as the host of The Footballers' Football Show, a programme which discusses the key football issues of the week. In June 2013, Sky Sports announced a brand new show for the 2013-14 season called Saturday Night Football, for their coverage of 5.30pm Saturday evening Premier League fixtures. The show was presented by Jones alongside Jamie Redknapp with an audience of football fans debating current football issues. The audience was later dropped but Jones and Redknapp continued to host the show until Sky lost the rights for the Saturday evening matches in 2016. After the departure of Ed Chamberlin to front ITV's coverage of Horse Racing, Jones became the main football presenter on Sky Sports in August 2016. Jones now presents the flagship Super Sunday and Monday Night Football programmes alongside pundits such as Jamie Carragher, Graeme Souness, Micah Richards and Gary Neville. When Sky Sports launched their new week nightly football discussion programme The Debate in August 2017, Jones hosted the first show.\nIn addition to this, Jones was heavily involved with Sky Sports' live UEFA Champions League coverage and has fronted numerous live England international matches.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Sunderland A.F.C.", "response": ["|Non Executive Director || David Jones"]}, {"page": "David Jones", "response": ["David Jones may refer to:", "* David Jones (jazz musician) (1888\u20131956), American jazz saxophonist", "* David Jones (drummer), Australian drummer", "* David Jones (director) (1934\u20132008), English stage, television and film director", "* David Jones (presenter), English sports broadcaster on Sky Sports since 1999", "* David Jones (artist-poet) (1895\u20131974), British modernist poet, writer, and artist", "* David Jones (programmer) (active in 1980s), former freelance computer game programmer", "* David Jones (video game developer) (born 1966), Scottish video game programmer and entrepreneur", "* David Jones (writer), creator of the television series Fireman Sam", "* David Jones (merchant) (1793\u20131873), Welsh-Australian department store founder", "* David Jones (advertising executive) (born 1966), English born businessman", "* David Jones (VC) (1892\u20131916), English recipient of the Victoria Cross", "* David Jones (Upper Canada politician) (1792\u20131870), lawyer, judge and political figure", "* David Jones (Carmarthenshire MP) (1810\u20131869), Welsh banker and Conservative Party politician", "* David Jones (Clwyd West MP) (born 1952), Conservative Party MP, former AM and Welsh Secretary", "* David Jones (New Zealand politician) (1873\u20131941), New Zealand politician", "* David Jones (Guernsey politician) (1949\u20132016), Minister of Housing in Guernsey, Channel Islands", "* David Jones (Llangan) (1736\u20131810), Welsh Church of England priest who was supportive of Methodism", "* David Jones (missionary) (1796\u20131841), Welsh missionary in Madagascar", "* David Jones (Dean of Llandaff) (1870\u20131949), Dean of Llandaff Cathedral", "* David Jones (archdeacon of Carmarthen) (1874\u20131950), Archdeacon of Carmarthen", "* David Jones (philosopher) (born 1950), American professor of philosophy ", "* David Jones (Browns owner), majority owner of the Cleveland Browns from 1953 to 1961", "* David Jones (Cardinals owner) (1883\u20131966), American football team owner for the Chicago Cardinals", "* David Jones (cornerback) (born 1985), American football player", "* David Jones (offensive lineman) (born 1961), American football player for the Washington Redskins", "* David Jones (safety) (born 1993), American football player;
