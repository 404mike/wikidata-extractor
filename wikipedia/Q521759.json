Lightfoot travelled from Chester to Scotland with the Welsh author Thomas Pennant and the Rev. J. Stewart; the journey led to an acclaimed book by Pennant, and provided most of the materials for Lightfoot's Flora Scotica (2 vols, 1777), which he published at his own expense.Jardine, 1833. pp.18\u201327 Apart from Banks and Solander, Lightfoot also knew many of the other founders of the Linnaean Society, including William Hudson, James Dickson, James Edward Smith, Gilbert White, John Sibthorpe and James Bolton; Lightfoot lived just long enough to see the society founded in 1788."]}, {"page": "James Dickson", "response": ["*James Dickson (Irish politician) (1850\u20131941), Liberal MP for Dungannon 1880\u20131885", "*James Dickson (New South Wales politician) (1813\u20131863), member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly", "*James Dickson (New Zealand politician) (1854\u20131937), Reform Party member", "*James Dickson (Scottish politician) (c. 1715\u20131771), MP for Lanark Burghs 1768\u20131771", "*James Dickson (Swedish politician) (1899\u20131980), MP for The Right 1941\u20131968", "*James Dickson (cricketer) (1887-1970), New Zealand cricketer", "*James Dickson (botanist) (1738\u20131822), Scottish botanist", "*James Dickson (merchant) (1784\u20131855), Scottish merchant and philanthropist in Gothenburg, Sweden", "*James Dickson (musician), member of New Zealand pop group The Chills", "*James Dickson was the name of one of the people killed during the 1990 Aramoana massacre", "*James Dickson Phillips Jr. (1922\u20132017), American judge"]}, {"page": "Myriostoma", "response": ["The species was first mentioned in the scientific literature by Samuel Doody in the second edition of John Ray's Synopsis methodica stirpium Britannicarum in 1696.

He found it growing in roadside banks and hedgerows among nettles in Suffolk and Norfolk. Nicaise Auguste Desvaux first defined and published the new genus Myriostoma in 1809, with the species renamed Myriostoma anglicum (an illegitimate renaming). Christian Hendrik Persoon had previously placed the species in Geastrum in 1801, while Samuel Frederick Gray would in 1821 describe the genus Polystoma for it.

It was later assigned to a host of genera before being moved to its current genus, Diploicia, by Abramo Bartolommeo Massalongo in 1852. It is the type species for the genus. Some mycologists assign this species (and all other members of the genus Diploicia) to the genus Diplotomma, but genetic analysis suggests that this would make Diplotomma a polyphyletic group, and that the Diploicia species are more appropriately assigned to a separate genus. There are two subspecies, D. c. canescens and D. c. australasica, which differ in the chemistry of their thallus. D. c. canescens contains canesolide and buellolide, while D. c. australasica does not."]}]}}
