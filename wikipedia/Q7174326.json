He was born at Kurseong, Darjeeling, India and died on the island of Jersey.\nThe son of a Darjeeling tea-planter and educated at Tonbridge School, Graham was a lower-order right-handed batsman and a right-arm bowler: his CricketArchive profile rates him as \"fast\", but the report in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack of his first first-class match in 1948 reads: \"Graham, from Burnham-on-Sea, bowled well at medium-pace\". In fact, that first game, a first-class friendly match between Glamorgan and Somerset at Rodney Parade, Newport, was Graham's most successful: he took four wickets in the match, including three for 47 in the Glamorgan first innings, and scored 33 at the end of Somerset's second innings. In five County Championship matches in the early part of the season, Graham never managed to surpass either the bowling figures or the highest score, and he took only three wickets in these games, all of them in the match against Gloucestershire, in which Gloucestershire made a total of 522 to win by an innings. He did not appear for Somerset in first-class matches after June 1948, though as late as 1953 he played a non-first-class game for the side against a Royal Air Force side that included Fred Trueman.His obituary in Wisden in 2001 states that he later became a tobacco farmer in Southern Rhodesia.Peter's older brother; Captain John Onslow Graham (8th Punjab Regiment), was killed leading a heroic charge during the Battle of Kampar during the Malaya Campaign in 1942.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Peter Graham", "response": ["Peter Graham is the name of:", "*Peter Graham (composer) (born 1958), British composer", "*Peter Graham (1939-2020), British writer, restaurant critic", "*Peter Graham (Conservative MPP) (1827\u20131877), British-born Ontario farmer and political figure, MPP for Frontenac", "*Peter Graham (Liberal MPP) (1821\u20131900), English-born Ontario farmer and political figure, MPP for Lambton East", "*Peter Graham (Manitoba politician)", "*Peter Graham (cricketer, born 1920) (1920\u20132000), Indian-born British cricketer", "*Peter Graham (cricketer, born 1954) (1954\u20132015), British cricketer", "*Peter Graham (footballer) (born 1947), British footballer", "*Peter Graham (fighter) (born 1975), Australian kickboxer, boxer and mixed martial artist", "*Peter Graham (rugby league), rugby league footballer of the 1990s", "*Sir Peter Graham (barrister) (1934\u20132019), retired First Parliamentary Council in the United Kingdom", "*Peter Graham (judge) (born 1940), Justice of the Federal Court of Australia", "*Peter Graham (New Zealand Mountaineer) (1881\u20131961), who together with Henrik Sillem made the first ascent of the West Ridge of Mount Cook", "*Peter Graham (British Army officer) (born 1937)", "*Peter Graham, of the League for a Workers' Republic", "*Peter Graham (writer) (8 December 1939 \u2013 6 July 2020) was a British writer"]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Peter Graham (1948) 6 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Peter Onslow Graham", "response": ["#REDIRECT Peter Graham (cricketer, born 1920)"]}, {"page": "Deaths in March 2000", "response": ["*Peter Graham, 79, British cricket player."]}]}}
