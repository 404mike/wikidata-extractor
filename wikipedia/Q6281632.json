He made his debut for Derbyshire in the 1909 season against Sussex in May when he made 6 and 14. Over the next four years he played about five games a year, but in the  1914 season he played 16 matches for the club. Cricket was interrupted by the First World War, and Bowden did not return to the first-class game until the 1921 season.  In that season he scored his first century of 108 against Gloucestershire. He played steadily in the 1922 season and in the 1923 season scored 114 against Somerset.  After good but uneventful seasons in 1924 and 1925, Bowden managed an average of 30.52 in the 1926 season, clocking up 1221 runs and making 106 against Warwickshire. He maintained form over the next three years and made his top score of 120 against Essex in the 1929 season when he partnered Harry Storer who made 209 to put on 322 for the first wicket.\nAs of 2009, this remains the record first-wicket stand for Derbyshire. In the 1930 season, which was his last, he played fewer matches and his average was down to 9.69\nBowden was a right-hand batsman and played 395 innings in 231 first-class matches with an average of 20.57.

In the 1922 season his best score was 99, but he managed 7 for 26 bowling against Northamptonshire. In the 1923 season he was just short of a century again with 94 and dropped in the bowling averages as well. His batting slumped to a top score on 18 in the 1924 season when he managed 5 for 27 against Lancashire. His showing in the 1925 season was also relatively indifferent whereas in the 1926 season he topped the batting table in a run feast including 132 against Somerset while he took 41 wickets including two five-wicket innings. In the 1927 season his batting form continued with two centuries against Nottinghamshire in separate matches and a best bowling of 6 for 47 together with another five wicket innings. He topped the batting scores again in the 1928 season with centuries against Gloucestershire and Kent, and though his bowling was less productive he was an effective stand in as wicket-keeper against MCC for an injured Harry Elliott. His most productive summer with the bat was the 1929 season, when he topped the batting table again with 1,652 first-class runs at 36.71, including four hundreds and seven fifties.
