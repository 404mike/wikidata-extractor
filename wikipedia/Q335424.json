He was perhaps the last of the line of scholar-missionaries, beginning with James Scarth Gale, Homer B. Hulbert, George Heber Jones and the Anglican bishop Mark Napier Trollope who laid the foundations of what is now known as Korean studies. Some years after he retired as an Anglican bishop, Rutt was one of several Anglicans received into the Roman Catholic Church in 1994. He was ordained a Roman Catholic priest the following year and spent the closing years of his life in Cornwall.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Knitting", "response": ["With the invention in 1589 of the stocking frame, an early form of knitting machine, knitting \"by hand\" became a craft used by country people with easy access to fiber.

Some stitch patterns are believed, erroneously, to have a traditional interpretation, often of religious significance. These interpretations were fabricated by Heinz Edgar Kiewe, a yarn shop owner who noticed a chance resemblance between Aran stitches and Celtic knotwork, and assumed that Aran knitting was at least as old as, if not older than, the knotwork it resembles. He wrote a book on his suppositions, The Sacred History of Knitting, which provides most of the mythology surrounding the Aran jumper. His thesis has, however, been thoroughly debunked by many historians of knitting, including Richard Rutt, Alice Starmore and Vawn Corrigan."]}, {"page": "List of converts to Catholicism", "response": ["* Richard Rutt: Catholic Monsignor, member of the House of Lords, served as a missionary to Korea and as Bishop of Daejon in the Anglican Church of Korea and the Suffragan Bishop of Turo in the Church of England, prominent Korean Studies Scholar"]}, {"page": "Gim Jeong-hui", "response": ["Gim Jeong-hui (\uae40\uc815\ud76c, \u91d1\u6b63\u559c,  born on the 3rd day of the 6th lunar month 1786,  died on the 10th day of the 10th lunar month 1856), also known as Kim Jeong-hui, was one of the most celebrated practitioners of calligraphy, epigraphists, and scholars of Korea\u2019s later Joseon period.Korea: A Historical and Cultural Dictionary ed.
