But no, parody still has a place and jokes do need to be written. This sharp new show did it rather well and was the most promising satirical arrival on our screens in a long time.\" In November 2018, the BBC's political presenter Andrew Neil described The Mash Report on Twitter as \"self-satisfied, self-adulatory, unchallenged left-wing propaganda\". Responding to a tweet about Geoff Norcott's appearances, he said it was \"hardly balance\" and would \"never happen on a politics show\". Neil characterised the series as a \"pathetic imitation\" of The Daily Show in the United States, describing the latter's former host Jon Stewart as \"left-wing but also intelligent\"."]}, {"page": "Norcott", "response": ["* Geoff Norcott (born 1976), English comedian."]}, {"page": "Sacha Lord", "response": ["In January 2020, Lord appeared on BBC Question Time, alongside Conservative Party chairman James Cleverly, Labour's Sarah Jones, National Farmers\u2019 Union president Minette Batters and stand-up comedian Geoff Norcott.
