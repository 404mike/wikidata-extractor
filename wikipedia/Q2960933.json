Between 1791 and 1794, she was active as a spy in Paris. She became known for her attempts of trying to aid the members of the former royal family to escape from prison. In 1793, she made repeated attempts to try to help former queen Marie Antoinette on one occasion by visiting her in prison dressed as a national guard with the plan of changing clothes with her. She also tried to free the former royal children from the Temple. Her activities had no success despite her spending considerable sums of her fortune on her missions. By historians, Atkyns had often been described as an eccentric who was not taken seriously.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Atkyns", "response": ["* Charlotte Atkyns (1757\u20131836), English actor and agent"]}, {"page": "Lady Atkyns", "response": ["#REDIRECT Charlotte Atkyns"]}, {"page": "Atkyns, Charlotte", "response": ["#redirectCharlotte Atkyns"]}]}}
