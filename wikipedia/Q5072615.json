Mrs Abbey encouraged her husband to secure more ambitious commissions, although with their marriage commencing when both were in their forties, the couple remained childless. After her husband's death, Gertrude was active in preserving her husband's legacy, writing about his work and giving her substantial collection and archive to Yale. Edwin had been a keen supporter of the newly founded British School at Rome (BSR), so, in his memory, she donated \u00a36000 to assist in building the artists' studio block and, in 1926, founded the Incorporated Edwin Austin Abbey Memorial Scholarships. The scholarships were established to enable British and American painters to pursue their practice. Recipients of Abbey funding \u2013 Scholars and, more recently, Fellows \u2013 devote their scholarship to working in the studios at the BSR, where there has, ever since, been at least one Abbey-funded artist in residence. Previous award holders include Stephen Farthing, Chantal Joffe and Spartacus Chetwynd. The Abbey Fellowships (formerly 'Awards') were established in their present form in 1990, and the Abbey studios also host the BSR's other Fine Art residencies, such as the Derek Hill Foundation Scholarship and the Sainsbury Scholarship in Painting and Drawing. A bust of Edwin Abbey, by Sir Thomas Brock, stands in the courtyard of the BSR. Edwin also left bequests of his works to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston and to the National Gallery in London."]}, {"page": "Royal Academy of Arts", "response": ["In 2011 Tracey Emin was appointed Professor of Drawing, and Fiona Rae was appointed Professor of Painting \u2013 the first women professors to be appointed in the history of the Academy.\"Tracey Emin to become Professor of Drawing at RA\"\"BBC News\" 14 December 2011 Emin was succeeded by Michael Landy, and then David Remfry in 2016 while Rae was succeeded by Chantal Joffe in January 2016.Royal Academy of Arts announces election of new Royal Academician, new professors for the Royal Academy Schools and Honorary Surveyor Royal Academy of Arts news release, dated 16 January 2016."]}, {"page": "List of British painters", "response": ["*Chantal Joffe (born 1969)"]}, {"page": "Saatchi Gallery", "response": ["Meanwhile, other shows with different themes were held in the gallery itself.
