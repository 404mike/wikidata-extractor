In 1969, Surrey employed their very first overseas player: the very popular Pakistani leg break bowler Intikhab Alam. In addition to Intikhab, the Surrey attack in their Championship-winning side possessed four current or future England Test cricketers in Geoff Arnold, Robin Jackman, Bob Willis and Pat Pocock. Edrich was subsequently appointed captain in 1973 and led Surrey to second position in the County Championship in his first year in charge and then secured Surrey their first limited overs silverware the following year with victory in the Benson and Hedges Cup. Edrich's replacement as captain, Roger Knight, led Surrey to NatWest Trophy glory at Lord's in 1982. Following Intikhab Alam, other overseas players to appear for the county included the talented New Zealand opening batsman Geoff Howarth and two extremely fearsome fast bowlers, the West Indian Sylvester Clarke and the young Pakistani Waqar Younis.", "*  Roger Knight"]}, {"page": "International cricket in South Africa from 1971 to 1981", "response": ["DH Robins' XI team squad comprised: Tony Brown; David Brown; Frank Hayes; Jackie Hampshire; Robin Hobbs; David Hughes; Robin Jackman; Roger Knight; John Lever; Peter Lewington;  Arnold Long; John Murray; Clive Radley; Mike Smith; David Turner; Peter Willey;  Bob Willis;"]}, {"page": "Cranleigh School", "response": ["* Roger Knight (cricketer)"]}, {"page": "European Cricket Council", "response": ["The ECC was the regional authority for Europe under the auspices of the worldwide governing authority of cricket,  the International Cricket Council (ICC).
