After this he became involved in children's television from the 1950s, working on BBC's Blue Peter for a few years before fronting a series of children's art programmes, including Vision On, Take Hart and Hartbeat.\nHis contributions to children's television include the design of the ship logo used by Blue Peter and the show's badges, and the animated character of Morph, who appeared beside him on his programmes following his introduction in the 1970s.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "January 18", "response": ["*2009 \u2013 Tony Hart, English painter and television host (b. 1925)"]}, {"page": "October 15", "response": ["*  1925   \u2013 Tony Hart, English painter and television host (d. 2009)"]}, {"page": "Stop motion", "response": ["At very much the same time in the UK, Peter Lord and David Sproxton formed Aardman Animations that would produce many commercials, TV series, short films and eventually also feature films.

In 1977 they started on a series of animated films, again using modelling clay, but this time made for a more adult audience. The soundtrack for Down and Out was recorded in a Salvation Army Hostel and Plasticine puppets were animated to dramatise the dialogue. A second film, also for the BBC followed in 1978.
