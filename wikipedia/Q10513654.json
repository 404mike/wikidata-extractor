Former director Walter Wheatley's loans to the club had taken its debts down to a manageable proportion, but after being installed as chairman (Blindell had died in January 1969), Wheatley carried on the austerity into the 1969\u201370 season. Manager Jimmy Sirrel once again had his hands tied in the transfer market, releasing experienced campaigners Denis Hunt, Pat Terry and Ron Foster and bringing in three attackers, two on free transfers (Bill Brown and Micky Cook) and one on trial (Roger Frude)."]}]}}
