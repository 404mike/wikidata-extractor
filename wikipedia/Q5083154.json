He was apprenticed to Doulton in Burslem at age fourteen as a modeller and designer, and trained by Charles Noke. Henry Doulton saw his potential and steered him to the Hanley Art School where he won a scholarship to the Royal College of Art in London. At the RCA he studied sculpture: his years there were from 1905 to 1910, including a travelling scholarship to visit Italy in 1909. In 1911 he became a member of the Royal British Society of Sculptors and married Nell (1892-1967). In 1912 he studied at the Camberwell School of Art.\n\nIn 1914 Vyse executed a frieze depicting potters and miners above the entrance to a new technical college in Stoke-on-Trent (now Staffordshire University).  The frieze is in Hollington sandstone, and shows the influence of the New Sculpture movement.\n\nDoulton produced designs by Vyse in the inter-war period, for example a figurine called \"Darling\".  However, Vyse is best-remembered for the thousands of pieces produced by a studio pottery at Cheyne Walk in Chelsea, which he started in 1919 with his wife. Here they produced figurines based on ordinary people seen in London. These slip-cast statuettes proved to be extremely popular and a number of women were employed to produce them. Their studio pottery also produced two other types of ware: revivalist oriental forms and glazes, and art deco hand-decorated functional stoneware.Vyse's neighbour, George Eumorfopoulos, had amassed a large collection of Chinese Sung, Korean and Persian pottery. These caught Vyse's interest, and he started experimenting in the Sung style. Nell, who had trained as a singer, had also studied German and French, enabling her to decipher 19th century works on early Chinese glazes and Charles to reproduce chun (an iron glaze used in Chinese celadon ware), tenmoku and T'zu-chou stoneware glazes. Their experiments with oriental glazes established that the blue in celadons was due to iron and not copper as had been thought. Their work was sold at Walker's Gallery in New Bond Street.\nThe Cheyne Walk studio was bombed in the blitz of 1940 obliging Vyse to teach at Farnham School of Art. His relationship with Nell also ended at this time, and she devoted herself to left-wing politics, having been a suffragette in her early years. When the war ended, he resumed making the character figurines with the assistance of one of the Farnham students, Barbara Waller. His annual exhibitions at Walker's were resumed from 1950 up to his retirement in 1963.Charles' and Nell's work is to be seen in the Victoria and Albert Museum, York City Art Gallery, Aberystwyth University and Stoke-on-Trent.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Royal Doulton figurines", "response": ["|Charles Vyse", "|Charles Vyse", "|Charles Vyse", "|Charles Vyse"]}, {"page": "George Eumorfopoulos", "response": ["Eumorfopoulos worked for a London firm established in 1819 - Ralli Brothers, of Greek origin, a firm of private bankers who were also importers of rape, rice, cotton and hemp from India. By the time he retired in August 1934 he had risen to the position of Vice President of the firm. Since 1922 he lived at 7 Chelsea Embankment in London, a townhouse he had converted into a museum. Eumorfopoulos was a respected Orientalist. In the early stages of his collecting activity he focused on European medieval and renaissance art and 18th century ceramics alongside Japanese art, but he soon diversified into early Chinese art, especially after 1906. He not only made use of the services of experts or agents, but also relied on his own rapidly growing experience in acquiring objects. His collection of Oriental art grew to an enormous size, obliging him to add a two-storey extension to the back of his Chelsea house. He founded the Oriental Ceramic Society and was its first president from 1921 until his death in 1939. He organised and funded the publication of eleven volumes illustrating and describing items from his collection during the 1920s and early 1930s. Free access to his collection and encouragement from him inspired his neighbours Nell and Charles Vyse to experiment with Oriental stoneware glazes.Amazon Books"]}, {"page": "Antiques Roadshow (series 29)", "response": ["\u2013 ceramic statue of woman and baby by Charles Vyse, 1931, for the Chelsea porcelain factory, \u00a31,500 "]}, {"page": "Pamela Ascherson", "response": ["Ascherson was born in London and attended Roedean School in Brighton. In 1939 she took painting lessons from Laura Knight and in 1940 she enrolled at the Farnham School of Art where she studied sculpture and pottery making under Charles Vyse. In 1941, Ascherson won a scholarship to the Royal College of Art but deferred her entrance to enlist in the Women's Royal Naval Service. She served in the WRNS from 1943 to 1945. She is listed on the Bletchley Park Roll of Honour as having been a bombe operator at an out-station in Stanmore. Ascherson eventually entered the Royal College of Art in 1945 and studied there for two years. By that time she had already had paintings accepted for display by the Royal Academy during the war and the Contemporary Art Society had acquired a terracotta work by her. In 1947 she married and moved to Provence in France and in 1948, as Pamela Rachet, wrote and illustrated a book, C'etait Heir - St Remy du Provence, on the region. Her first solo exhibition was held at the Berkeley Gallery in 1953. A series of paintings on racing cars made by Ascherson in the 1960s were acquired by the Donington Park Racing Museum.

After graduating, Drawbell worked as an assistant to Charles Vyse and worked with him in creating ceramic figures for Poole Pottery. She created animal and human figures, usually for private commissions, some of which were re-created in silver by the jewellery company Asprey. Drawbell was a regular exhibitor at the Royal Academy in London, showing a total of eighteen works there between 1943 and 1961. In 1961 she published Making Pottery Figures, a book on pottery methods and techniques. Drawbell was also a painter and had an exhibition of her paintings at the Zaydler Gallery in 1970.
