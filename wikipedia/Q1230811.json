However, the stress of public attention caused Paul to retreat into the background, while Barry went solo. Paul Ryan wrote Barry's 1968 hit \"Eloise\", the 1971 hit \"Who Put the Lights Out?\" for Dana and another of his songs, \"I Will Drink the Wine\", was a UK hit single for Frank Sinatra.In the 1970s, Ryan relocated to the United States and later left the music industry. In 1976, he released an album, Scorpio Rising. After returning to the UK in 1985, he earned his living from operating a chain of hairdressing salons.The gothic punk band the Damned reached number 3 in the UK Singles Chart in 1986, with their version of \"Eloise\".Ryan died of lung cancer in 1992 in London at the age of 44.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1992 in music", "response": ["* November 29 \u2013 Paul Ryan, singer, songwriter and record producer, 44 (cancer)"]}, {"page": "Dana Rosemary Scallon", "response": ["Scallon's debut album All Kinds of Everything, recorded at Decca Studios in West Hampstead, London, on the weekend of 25 April 1970, was released in June and included four tracks co-written by the singer, as well as a new recording of the album's title track. Her follow-up single was issued in September, but Jerry Lordan's \"I Will Follow You\" failed to chart. The song that put an end to her one-hit wonder status was found on the album Barry Ryan 3. \"Who Put the Lights Out\", written by Paul Ryan for his twin brother, was offered to her by their stepfather Harold Davison, the business partner of her agent Dick Katz. Her version, cut with Barry Ryan's producer Bill Landis, proved a strong comeback vehicle reaching #5 in Ireland. In the UK it became a #14 hit on 13 March 1971. There then followed three years of unsuccessful singles broken only by the Irish chart showing of \"Sunday Monday Tuesday\", a #4 hit in December 1973. This lack of success caused her agent to recommend she join the former head of Bell Records Dick Leahy on his new label, GTO Records."]}, {"page": "List of songs recorded by Frank Sinatra", "response": ["|I Will Drink the Wine||1970||Paul Ryan", "|Sunrise in the Morning||1970||Paul Ryan"]}, {"page": "Scorpio Rising", "response": ["*Scorpio Rising, a 1976 album by Paul Ryan"]}, {"page": "Barry Ryan (singer)", "response": ["Paul Ryan opted out of the stress of show business, and Barry continued as a solo artist, enabling his brother to stay out of the limelight and concentrate on writing songs.
