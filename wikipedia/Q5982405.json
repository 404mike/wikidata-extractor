After starting his career in non-League football with Bury Town, Miller moved into the Football League with Ipswich Town. He also spent time on loan in the lower divisions of the Football League at Boston United and Darlington, before joining Darlington on a permanent basis in 2008. He left that club in late 2011 and joined Grimsby Town soon afterwards.\nAs captain of Cambridge United he led the team to a second-place finish and F.A Trophy glory at Wembley. During the play-off final Miller received a ruptured Achilles' tendon  in the final minutes of the game, despite this he still lifted the trophy - whilst in a wheelchair - as Cambridge won 2\u20131 against Gateshead, sending the club into the Football League.\nThe injury ruled him out for the majority of the next season. After playing very few games he was released on a free transfer.\nAfter his time as captain at Cambridge United Miller became the club's Community Football Manager, while also playing on a part-time basis for Needham Market", "link_mentions": [{"page": "2006\u201307 Ipswich Town F.C. season", "response": ["| Ian Miller", "| Ian Miller", "| Ian Miller", "|align=\"left\"|  Ian Miller"]}, {"page": "Ian Miller", "response": ["Ian Miller may refer to:", "*Ian Miller (Australian footballer) (born 1949), Australian rules footballer", "*Ian Miller (footballer, born 1983), English footballer", "*Ian Miller (footballer, born 1955), Scottish footballer", "*Ian Miller (illustrator) (born 1946), British fantasy illustrator", "*Ian Miller, former member of the band Virgin Black", "*Ian Miller, Commandant (Chief Officer), of the City of London Police Special Constabulary", "*Ian Miller (basketball) (born 1991), American basketball player", "*Ian Miller (baseball), baseball player", "*Ian Miller, a character in the film My Big Fat Greek Wedding", "*Ian Miller, co-founder of Miller's Retail"]}, {"page": "2008 Football League Two play-off Final", "response": ["Rochdale faced Darlington in their play-off semi-final, with the first leg being held away at Balfour Webnet Arena on 10 May 2008.
