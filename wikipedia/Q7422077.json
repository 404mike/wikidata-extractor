Timothy Laugher, of Hackney (d. 1769), was her uncle, and she was a cousin of Joshua Tilt Bache.\nShe moved to Birmingham (before 1791, for she had attended the ministry of Joseph Priestley) and for many years kept the Islington School, in conjunction with a half-sister, Miss Penn. Another half-sister, Anna Penn, married the Rev. Lant Carpenter, LL.D. She was the author of the hymn See how he loved, which first appeared in the Exeter collection in 1812, compiled by Dr. Carpenter.
