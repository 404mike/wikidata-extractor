By 1985, the band consisted only of Rowland and long-standing members Helen O'Hara (violin) and Billy Adams (guitar). The band broke up in 1987, with Rowland becoming a solo artist. After two failed restart attempts, Dexys was reformed by Rowland in 2003 with new members, as well as a few returning members from the band's original lineup (known as Dexys Mark I). Dexys released their fourth album in 2012 and a fifth followed in 2016.", "As Dexys prepared to record their first album for Mercury, Rowland decided that he needed more proficient string players to achieve the sound he envisioned. He sent Speare to invite Bevington to join Dexys, which she agreed to do, and Rowland gave her the Irish-sounding stage name of Helen O'Hara. Rowland also asked her to recruit two other violinists; she brought fellow students Steve Shaw and Roger Huckle, whom Rowland renamed as Steve Brennan and Roger MacDuff, and Rowland named the violin section \"The Emerald Express\". However, the need to rearrange all the songs for both strings and horns left the brass section of Paterson and Maurice (and to a lesser extent Speare) feeling that their role in the band had diminished. Thus, just prior to the recording sessions, Paterson and Maurice quit.Record Mirror 3 July 1982 Rowland was able to persuade them to remain in Dexys long enough to record the next album .Richard White, Dexys Midnight Runners: Young Soul Rebels (2005), p. 121-22.  Shortly thereafter, Speare also joined their planned departure.", "In an interview with HitQuarters Gatfield later described the recording process as \"very long and painful\", and he left the group after a short tour of France and the UK. The album's most controversial feature was its use of conversational dialogue in the songs; Rowland said, \"The idea of a conversation in a song is interesting to me.\"  Commenting on this, O'Hara said that \"we had to keep going ahead with what we believed\" despite the length of time that the production took.Helen O'Hara interview, reprinted at Dexys' website", "On St. Patrick's Day (Thursday, 17 March) 2016, Dexys announced the release of their fifth studio album, Let the Record Show: Dexys Do Irish and Country Soul, which was subsequently released on 100%/Warner Music on 3 June 2016. The album features interpretations of Irish folk standards plus songs written by contemporary musicians.  The pre-release videos included on Dexys' Facebook page featured three band members: Rowland, Lucy Morgan, and Sean Read, whom Rowland described as the \"nucleus\" of the current version of Dexys. The album also includes guest violinist Helen O'Hara, recording with the band for the first time in 30 years. Rowland said that the idea for the album dated back to 1984\u201385, at which time the album would have been called Irish and featured only traditional Irish songs as interpreted by Dexys. O'Hara, in fact, had released such an album in 1998, entitled A Night in Ireland, which includes three of the same songs.  According to Rowland, \"the brief [has] expanded from solely consisting of Irish songs, to songs I've always loved and wanted to record\", such as \"You Wear It Well\", \"To Love Somebody\", and \"Both Sides, Now\".", "*Helen O'Hara \u2013 violin, backing vocals (1981\u20131987, 2016, 2021\u2013present)"]}, {"page": "1955 in music", "response": ["*January 3 \u2013 Helen O'Hara, British rock violinist (Dexys Midnight Runners)"]}, {"page": "The Blue Ox Babes", "response": ["The Blue Ox Babes were an English pop group, formed in early 1981 by the former Dexys Midnight Runners guitarist Kevin 'Al' Archer, together with his girlfriend Yasmin Saleh, guitarist Nick Bache and former Dexys keyboard player Andy Leek.
