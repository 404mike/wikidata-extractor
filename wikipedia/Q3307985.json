Among contemporaneous accounts, a 1901 estimate published in The Lancet, put the excess mortality, from \"starvation or to the diseases arising therefrom,\" in India in the decade between 1891 and 1901 to be 19 million.The effect of famines on the population of India, The Lancet, Vol. 157, No. 4059, 15 June 1901, pp. 1713\u20131714;;  The last estimate has been cited by scholar Mike Davis, who further interprets a number of sources, including Lancet, to estimate the total famine mortality in India between 1876 and 1902 to be between 12.2 million and 29.3 million. However, historian Vasant Kaiwar, interprets many of the same sources, but not the Lancet, to estimate the famine mortality for the period 1876\u20131900 to be between 11.2 million and 19.3 million. According to poverty and development scholar Dan Banik, it was felt after the famine that the Indian famine codes from the 1880s were inadequate, and a new famine commission, appointed after the famine, brought out a revised famine code in 1901. This code was used in one form or another for many decades of the 20th century."]}, {"page": "Crane (TV series)", "response": ["13. Man Without A Past.

Having tired of London, he transferred in 1949 to BBC's Western Region in Bristol; he and his family lived for a time in the house of the novelist L.P. Hartley. For eight years he produced a variety of programmes including poetry, cricket commentary and agriculture. Through this last topic he came to know the agronomist Sir George Stapledon and to develop an ecological outlook. From 1957 to 1962 he worked as a freelance producer and researched his biography of Stapledon, Prophet of the New Age (1962). As a result of his contacts with the environmental movement, he became Editorial Secretary to the Soil Association, where he worked closely with Michael Allaby and persuaded the economist E.F. Schumacher (a Soil Association member since the early 1950s) to play a more prominent role. Waller resigned in 1972 and was for many years an Associate Editor of The Ecologist. During the 1970s he lived in rural Norfolk, moving to Bath in the early 1980s. In his later years he undertook editorial work for the Commonwealth Human Ecology Council (CHEC), and returned to write a column for the Soil Association journal Living Earth. Waller moved to Richmond in the mid-1990s, then, following the death in 2000 of his third wife Sue Dowdall, moved into an Exeter nursing home.", "Waller worked as a Western Region producer of agricultural programmes, with figures such as A.G. Street, Ralph Wightman and Henry Williamson, coming to appreciate the importance of farming for a nation\u2019s social structure and economy. The grassland authority and plant breeder R.G. (Sir George) Stapledon influenced him in the 1950s as powerfully as John Macmurray had in the 1930s, with his concept of \u201chuman ecology\u201d: the study of humans in their total environment, including the natural world, society and the inner world of emotion and culture. Waller\u2019s work on Stapledon\u2019s biography brought him into contact with the organic husbandry movement, and during his time as editorial secretary of the Soil Association he sought to broaden the organisation\u2019s appeal to the younger generation of environmental activists concerned by the revelations of Rachel Carson\u2019s Silent Spring (1962). In the end, the ethos of the Association remained rather too squirearchical for him and he, along with Michael Allaby, found the radical atmosphere of The Ecologist more to his taste."]}, {"page": "Allaby, Michael", "response": ["#redirectMichael Allaby"]}, {"page": "Allaby", "response": ["* Michael Allaby (born 1933), English writer"]}]}}
