Singleton is a British neurogeneticist currently working in the USA. He was born in Guernsey, the Channel Islands in 1972, where he lived until he was 18 years old. His secondary education was conducted at the Guernsey Grammar School. He earned a first class degree in Applied Physiology from Sunderland University and his PhD in neuroscience from the University of Newcastle upon Tyne where he studied the genetics of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias at the Medical Research Council (MRC) Neurochemical Pathology Unit. He moved to the United States in 1999, where he began working at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida studying the genetic basis of Parkinson's disease, ataxia, and dystonia. He moved to the National Institutes of Health in 2001 to head the newly formed Molecular Genetics unit within the Laboratory of Neurogenetics. In 2006 he took over as Chief of the Laboratory of Neurogenetics and became an NIH Distinguished Investigator in the intramural program at the National Institute on Aging (NIA) in 2017. In 2020 he stepped down as the Chief of the Laboratory of Neurogenetics and became the Acting Director of the newly formed Center for Alzheimer's and Related Dementias at the NIA (CARD https://card.nih.gov/). In 2021 he became the Director of CARD.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "University of Sunderland", "response": ["* Andrew Singleton \u2013 British neurogeneticist currently working in the USA."]}, {"page": "List of people from Guernsey", "response": ["* Andrew Singleton (born 1972), human geneticist"]}, {"page": "Andrew Singleton, Genetics and Genome Scientist", "response": ["#REDIRECT Andrew Singleton"]}, {"page": "Singleton, Andrew", "response": ["#redirectAndrew Singleton"]}, {"page": "Dena G.
