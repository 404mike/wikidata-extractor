Around 1860 he joined two other Johnson's workers, Duncan McKechnie and Charles Wigg, in setting up the Old Quay Works in Runcorn to make soap and to extract copper by the Henderson wet process.  In 1865, when John & Thomas Johnson became registered under the Companies Act as the Runcorn Soap and Alkali Company, Mathieson invested in the company, buying 175 shares.  He left the Old Quay Works to set up his own business, Matheison and Company in Widnes, Lancashire in 1870.  His partners were Frederick Herbert Gossage, son of William Gossage, and Thomas Sutton Timmis, both of whom had been associated with Gossage's soap business.  Matheison and Company became one of the most important companies in Widnes.  Its main business was producing alkali by the Leblanc process and they also produced glycerine from soap waste from Gossage's.  Later Mathieson's third son, Thomas Train Mathieson, became a partner in the business.Neil's eldest son, Douglas Dugald (1861\u201386), an assistant manager at the works, was killed after being struck by a falling derrick.  In 1892 Mathieson obtained a charter in Saltville, Virginia to open an alkali plant, buying out the Holston Salt and Plaster Company.  His son Thomas Train Mathieson went to USA to supervise this business, the Mathieson Alkali Company, which was later to develop into the Mathieson Chemical Corporation.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Campbeltown", "response": ["*Neil Mathieson, chemist and businessman"]}, {"page": "Widnes", "response": ["Henry Deacon (1822\u20131876) was a chemist and industrialist who established a chemical factory in Widnes.

This was located on the north side of the Runcorn to Latchford Canal between the canal and the River Mersey.  The area was known as the Old Quay, and the factory was called the Old Quay Chemical Works.  Wigg was joined in the enterprise by Neil Mathieson, who had been the works manager for the Johnsons' business.  They soon abandoned making soap and alkali, and began to extract copper from pyrites ash.  In 1869 Wigg and Mathieson were joined by Duncan McKechnie.  McKechnie had been a foreman at Johnsons', where he had gained expertise in the extraction of copper.  However the partnership did not last, and in 1871 McKechnie left to form his own copper works in St Helens.  In 1873 Mathieson was named in an action by Sir\u00a0Richard Brooke of Norton Priory for \"damage to his trees and pastures form noxious emissions\".  Mathieson decided to leave the Old Quay factory and establish his own factory in Widnes on the other side of the Mersey."]}, {"page": "Duncan McKechnie", "response": ["Duncan McKechnie was born in 1831 as the illegitimate son of Duncan McGeachy, a farmer in Lailt, Kintyre, Scotland, and Helen Montgomery.  Duncan McKechnie (then McGeachy) lived as a baby with his mother and their family, and in 1841 when he was aged 10, he was living with his grandfather in Lailt.  During the next decade the family moved to Glasgow, and Duncan became an apprentice soap boiler with Neil Mathieson and Company. In 1858 he married Agnes Miller, and the following year their first child, Daniel, was born, followed by a daughter, Agnes, in 1861.  In that year Duncan McGeachy changed his surname to McKechnie, (the anglicised version of McGeachy).  Their third child, a daughter, was born in 1863, and in the following year the family moved to Runcorn, Cheshire, England.  By this time Neil Mathieson was working in Runcorn as works manager for John & Thomas Johnson, soap and alkali makers.  McKechnie was appointed as a foreman at the works, and lived for a short time with the Mathiesons in Heath House, Runcorn.  However, in 1865 the Johnson brothers ran into financial difficulties, and their business was floated as a public company, known as the Runcorn Soap and Alkali company.  McKechnie continued to work with this company, and during this time he gained experience in working with the extraction of copper from pyrites ash.", "In 1865 Charles Wigg established the Old Quay Chemical Works in Runcorn with Neil Mathieson as his partner.  Initially they intended to  manufacture soap and alkali, but soon changed to copper extraction, and McKechnie joined them as a partner in 1869.  However, he did not stay long with this company, leaving in 1871 to form his own copper extraction company in St\u00a0Helens.  His first factory was located by the side of the Sankey Canal.  By 1881 he had moved to a site to the southeast of the town, and was employing 70\u00a0workers.  The business continued to grow, and at the Jubilee Exhibition in Manchester in 1887, they had a stand where they demonstrated their products, which included copper, silver, lead, iron oxide, sulphuric acid, and copper sulphate.  The company had been the largest suppliers of copper sulphate to deal with the wine blight caused by the infestation of French vineyards by the fungus Phylloxera.  In 1890 the United Alkali Company was formed to protect the interests of the chemical firms using the Leblanc process to manufacture alkali.  McKechnie initially hesitated, but then sold his company to them in the following year for an estimated cost of \u00a3109,480 (), and he became a director of the company.  In this role he visited the United States with his son, Duncan junior, in 1894, and in 1907 he visited pyrites mines in Spain."]}]}}
