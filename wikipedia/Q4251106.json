The theft of an infant by a water fairy, the appearance of the hero at a tournament on three consecutive days in three different disguises, and the rescue of a queen or princess from an Otherworld prison are all features of a well-known and widespread tale, variants of which are found in numerous examples collected by Theodore Hersart de la Villemarqu\u00e9 in his Barzaz Breiz, by Emmanuel Cosquin in his Contes Lorrains, and by John Francis Campbell in his Tales of the West Highlands.

The formation of the Edinburgh Social Union in 1885, which included a number of significant figures in the Arts and Craft and Aesthetic movements, became part of an attempt to facilitate a revival in Scotland, similar to that taking place in contemporaneous Ireland, drawing on ancient myths and history to produce art in a modern idiom.Gardiner (2005), p. 170. Key figures were the philosopher, sociologist, town planner and writer Patrick Geddes (1854\u20131932), the architect and designer Robert Lorimer (1864\u20131929) and stained-glass artist Douglas Strachan (1875\u20131950). Geddes established an informal college of tenement flats for artists at Ramsay Garden on Castle Hill in Edinburgh in the 1890s. Among the figures involved with the movement were Anna Traquair (1852\u20131936), who was commissioned by the Union to paint murals in the Mortuary Chapel of the Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh, (1885\u201386 and 1896\u201398) and also worked in metal, illumination, illustration, embroidery, and book binding.MacDonald, (2000), pp. 155\u20136.

Norman Macleod (1783\u20131862) recalled seeing the Fairy Flag during his childhood around 1799 (see relevant section below). He described the flag as then having crosses wrought in gold thread, and several \"elf spots\" stitched upon it. N. Macleod recollected that when the flag was examined, bits were taken off it from time to time; so much so, that later in his life he did not believe the flag still existed. In August 1814, Sir Walter Scott visited Dunvegan Castle on the Isle of Skye, and wrote of the visit in his diary. One of several items he mentioned seeing was the Fairy Flag. Scott described it as \"a pennon of silk, with something like round red rowan-berries wrought upon it\". John Francis Campbell saw the flag in 1871, and described it as being \"made of yellow raw silk with figures and spots worked on it in red\". In 1927, Roderick Charles MacLeod described the flag as then being square and brown. He measured it as about  squared. He considered the flag to have originally been much larger; and remarked on its extreme fragility and the requirement for careful handling, if it should be handled at all. R. C. MacLeod noted N. Macleod's description of the flag, but observed that it now only contained the \"elf spots\"\u2014there was then no evidence of any crosses upon what remained of the flag. R. C.

In this tale, titled an t urisgeal aig na righre Righ na thuirabhinn agus righ nan Ailp, the King of Ailp and his kingdom were killed by the druids, leaving only a son and a daughter. His daughter was trained by the druids and gained skin green as moss. The son climbs a mountain name Bean ghloine with his father's sword and scepter. Another druid curses him into animal form (a grayhound). He abandons the items on the mountain and flees to his sister. The prince, then, must remain as a grayhound until a maiden agrees to marry him, and his sister nurses three children and receives a kiss from a king's son. Some time later, the King of the Urbhin, while at war with another king, loses his way into a thick mist and ends up at the greyhound's castle. He kicks up the former king's bones and the grayhound, for this affront, demands the king of Urbhin surrenders one of his daughters as ransom. The princess lives with the greyhound and discovers he is a human prince. They marry, and her sisters become jealous. The princess's brother also falls in love with the grayhound's sister, the green girl, after drinking a potion of \"mheadair Bhuidh\" (yellow mead) from her hand. The princess's sister conspire with a druid to dethrone the her sister and become the greyhound's queen: when the time comes to give birth, for three times the princess's child is taken form her by a green hand in a window, but each child cries and the mother takes the teardrops. The grayhound, now a human prince, announces he will marry the one who can retrieve his father's sword and scepter from the glass mountain. The princess accomplishes it, but her sisters steal the credit. Next, they must wash the bloodstained shirts that belonged to those slain by the druids. The princess also washes all but one, and stays three nights on the (now human) greyhound's bed. On the first two nights, he is asleep, but acknowlegdes his wife on the third night, and they return to the former kingdom of Ailp with the green girl (hs sister). The tale continues as the \"wicked druid\" Dubhmalurraidh changes one of the princess's sisters into her shape, to cast the king into confusion. However, the green sister produces her father's sword and scepter (retrieved by her sister-in-law) and her three nephews.Campbell, J. F. (1860). Popular Tales of the West Highlands. Vol. IV.
