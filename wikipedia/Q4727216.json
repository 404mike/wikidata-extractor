For his 1995 solo show at the Lisson Gallery he created False Ceiling a flock of books suspended by wire from the gallery\u2019s ceiling. For Art and Sacred Places in Winchester Cathedral he created Recall which speculated how the structure of the Cathedral might have been supported during its construction.  Wentworth is also interested in the bizarre coincidences of urban life. His ongoing series of photographs, Making Do and Getting By (1974 onwards), captures the provisional ways in which people modify their local environment.
