Earlier in 1925 Livingstone-Learmonth set a British record in the 220 yd hurdles, but Burghley has bettered it within three weeks. In the semifinals of the 1928 Olympics Livingstone-Learmonth set another British record, in the 400 m hurdles at 54.0 s, but it was crashed next day by Burghley in the final.
