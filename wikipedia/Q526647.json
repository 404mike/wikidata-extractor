Total 64 found the visuals better than Nintendo's Zelda game presented at the Expo, \"utilising the N64's hi-res mode and displaying some gorgeous textures\"; it additionally praised its \"highly imaginative\" four-player mode and Berri's levels. Journalist Andy McDermott appreciated the huge amount of content, in particular the multi-player modes, the two different gameplay styles in the single-player mode and the fact that Conker learns new moves and attacks as the game progress. Coverage wasn't without criticisms, however; McDermott disliked its \"Americanized\" writing that consisted of \"colonial-style comments\" and the \"infuriatingly happy music\", while Next Generation called its premise of a squirrel collecting acorns in \"stunningly unimaginative forests\" a rip-off of Ocean Software's 16-bit platform game Mr. Nutz (1993). The most frequent skepticism was its kid-friendliness, particularly its consumer interest after the release of others family-friendly platformers like Banjo-Kazooie (1998). All of this concerned Rare, a developer which had a history of making games like Conker, resulting in a game design overhaul."]}, {"page": "Mac Diarmada", "response": ["* Andy McDermott, author"]}, {"page": "Bantam Books", "response": ["* Andy McDermott"]}, {"page": "Atlantis in popular culture", "response": ["* The novel The Hunt For Atlantis by Andy McDermott revolves around the main character's searching for the last location of the survivors  of Atlantis using a recovered piece of Orichalcum."]}, {"page": "Black Flame (publisher)", "response": ["**Death of the Senses (Andy McDermott, 2006 )"]}, {"page": "Masud Rana", "response": ["|Based on The Hunt for Atlantis by Andy McDermott.
