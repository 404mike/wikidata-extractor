In one memorable match at Stoke City he saved two penalties, prompting chants of \"Myhill for England\" from the travelling fans. At the end of the season he was named as the club's Player of the Year, and was the highest-ranked goalkeeper in FourFourTwo magazine's list of the top 50 Football League players. He was rewarded with a new, improved contract running until June 2008. Myhill signed a new three-year contract with Hull in August 2007. He was part of the Hull City team which won promotion to the Premier League for the first time in May 2008, and along with teammates Ian Ashbee, Andy Dawson and Ryan France, joined an elite band of players to have taken their club up through four divisions.

However, Achterberg was declared fit for the following match against Millwall on 7 March 2004, and Howarth returned to the substitutes' bench. He did not play another match for Tranmere that season.

After conceding a goal scored by Ian Ashbee in the 34th minute, Howarth was injured in a challenge with Stuart Elliott, and was substituted at half-time. He was available for Tranmere's next match against Barnsley on 26 December 2004, and with Achterberg ruled out for the Christmas period with a knee injury, he started in a 1\u20131 home draw. This meant Howarth had a run of nine consecutive matches in goal for Tranmere, with an appearance against Oldham Athletic in the Football League Trophy Northern semi-final on 25 January 2005 being his last before Achterberg returned against Luton on 29 January.
