A breakaway from her previous album A Rose Is Still a Rose (1998) which had been recorded under the guidance of Clive Davis along with many famed hip hop producers and rappers, such as Lauryn Hill, Sean \"Puffy\" Combs, and Jermaine Dupri, Franklin collaborated with then-new Arista label head L.A.

This is the sound of a legend doing exactly as she pleases, which in Franklin's case means plenty of lite R&B ballads and underdone covers of overdone standards [...] Franklin's miracle of a voice remains essentially intact, though she is no longer the matter-of-fact belter of old, relying instead on either Christina Aguilera-style oversinging or a weird, marble-mouthed mumble. The Chicago Sun-Times remarked that on A Woman Falling Out of Love Franklin's \"in retreat. The songwriting is '70s, the production is '80s, the arrangements are pure '90s smooth jazz. Instead of a contemporary queen, we get an unsettling Eartha Kitt-enish cougar anthem, clumsy jazz-club scat singing, an icy reading of \"Theme from A Summer Place\" and an overthought gospel rendition of \"My Country 'Tis of Thee.\" [...] The album's two bright spots come late in the sequence, and they both feature the songwriting of the underappreciated Norman West.\"", "* Norman West - Background Vocals (8)"]}]}}
