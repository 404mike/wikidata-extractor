The following season, 1923\u201324, Rovers were selected for promotion back to the Football League for the first time since 1905. In their first match of the season Shaw managed to send his penalty kick into the stand, thus missing out on scoring their first return goal and failing to win the match. His last match for Doncaster was at Walsall on 26 January 1924, after which he transferred to Huddersfield Town to play in their first of three successive First Division Championship seasons.\nHe was the elder brother of Wilf Shaw, who also played full back for Doncaster Rovers, until he was killed in action in World War II.", "link_mentions": {}}}
