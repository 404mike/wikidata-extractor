The following season, 1923\u201324, Rovers were selected for promotion back to the Football League for the first time since 1905. In their first match of the season Shaw managed to send his penalty kick into the stand, thus missing out on scoring their first return goal and failing to win the match. His last match for Doncaster was at Walsall on 26 January 1924, after which he transferred to Huddersfield Town to play in their first of three successive First Division Championship seasons.\nHe was the elder brother of Wilf Shaw, who also played full back for Doncaster Rovers, until he was killed in action in World War II.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1931 FA Cup Final", "response": ["|Full-back ||George Shaw"]}, {"page": "1935 FA Cup Final", "response": ["| ||2 || George Shaw"]}, {"page": "George Shaw", "response": ["George Shaw may refer to:", "* George Shaw (biologist) (1751\u20131813), English botanist and zoologist", "* George Shaw (academic dress scholar) (1928\u20132006), biologist and British expert on academic dress", "* George Shaw (artist) (born 1966), English contemporary artist", "* George Shaw (Australian politician) (1913\u20131966), member of the Australian House of Representatives", "* George Shaw (civil servant), Lieutenant Governor of the British Crown Colony of Burma, 1913", "* George Shaw (composer), musician and film composer", "* George Shaw (Tasmanian politician) (born 1932), member of the Tasmanian Legislative Council", "* George Shaw (architect) (1810\u20131876), English architect", "* George Shaw (American football) (1933\u20131998), American football quarterback", "* George Shaw (cricketer, born 1839) (1839\u20131905), English cricketer", "* George Shaw (cricketer, born 1931) (1931\u20131984), Welsh cricketer", "* George Shaw (footballer, born 1877) (1877\u20131954), Australian rules footballer in the 1890s", "* George Shaw (footballer, born 1886) (1886\u20131971), Australian rules footballer in the 1910s", "* George Shaw (footballer, born 1899) (1899\u20131973), English football player", "* George Shaw (footballer, born 1969), Scottish football player & manager of Forfar", "* George Shaw (triple jumper) (1931\u20131988), American Olympic athlete", "* Slotch Shaw (George Shaw, 1865\u20131928), English footballer"]}, {"page": "1926\u201327 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["|George Shaw||||DF||5||0||0||0||5||0"]}, {"page": "1925\u201326 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["|George Shaw||||DF||4||0||0||0||4||0"]}, {"page": "1924\u201325 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["|George Shaw||||DF||11||0||0||0||11||0"]}, {"page": "1923\u201324 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["|George Shaw||||DF||9||0||0||0||9||0"]}, {"page": "List of Huddersfield Town A.F.C. players", "response": ["|George Shaw||||1924\u20131926||29||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||29||0"]}, {"page": "George Shaw (English footballer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Shaw (footballer, born 1899)"]}, {"page": "George Shaw (footballer born 1899)", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Shaw (footballer, born 1899)"]}]}}
