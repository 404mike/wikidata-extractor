He was educated at Clifton College, Bristol, and Corpus Christi College, Oxford, where he graduated in 1887, and he qualified as an architect in 1890. He subsequently worked as assistant to John Macvicar Anderson in London, attending the Royal Academy Schools and University College London, before returning to his father's office where he was made a partner in 1891. He continued the business after his father's death along with his much younger brother Hubert Worthington, who became a partner in 1913. Percy's son Thomas Scott Worthington later joined the partnership.In his early years he was interested in the Arts and Crafts movement and this was reflected in the Unitarian Chapel, Liverpool, which he designed with his father.  From 1904 he became more involved in the revival of classicism. He was awarded the gold medal of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1930 and was knighted in 1935.  He died at his home in Mobberley, Cheshire, in 1939.", "link_mentions": {}}}
