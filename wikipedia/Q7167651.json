He was educated at Clifton College, Bristol, and Corpus Christi College, Oxford, where he graduated in 1887, and he qualified as an architect in 1890. He subsequently worked as assistant to John Macvicar Anderson in London, attending the Royal Academy Schools and University College London, before returning to his father's office where he was made a partner in 1891. He continued the business after his father's death along with his much younger brother Hubert Worthington, who became a partner in 1913. Percy's son Thomas Scott Worthington later joined the partnership.In his early years he was interested in the Arts and Crafts movement and this was reflected in the Unitarian Chapel, Liverpool, which he designed with his father.  From 1904 he became more involved in the revival of classicism. He was awarded the gold medal of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1930 and was knighted in 1935.  He died at his home in Mobberley, Cheshire, in 1939.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Manchester Grammar School", "response": ["The main building was designed in 1929 by Francis Jones and Percy Worthington.

The external stonework was replaced between 1850 and 1870 in a restoration by J. S. Crowther, who also replaced the internal stonework of the nave walls and arcades with exact reproductions of the originals. The west tower was heightened in 1868 by J.P. Holden, who also replaced its external stonework. Basil Champneys added the vestry, canons' library and western porches in 1898; while Percy Worthington provided further accommodation to the South-east, originally as a choir school, but subsequently converted to offices.  Consequently, the cathedral gives the impression of being a 19th-century structure.", "The 1421 foundation statutes of the collegiate church provided for an endowed choir of lay clerks and singing boys; and these endowments were renewed when the college was refounded after the Reformation. However, although from the 17th century, there were two grammar schools close by - Manchester Grammar School and Chetham's Hospital School -  there was, until the 20th century no provision for a choir school; dedicated choir school premises only being constructed by Percy Worthington in 1934.  This school did not resume following war damage; so in 1969, when Chetham's School was refounded as a dedicated school of music, scholarships were established to enable boys aged 8\u201313 to serve the cathedral choir. These scholarships were subsequently modified in the 1970s, so as to support both girls' and boys' voices; the first statutory choir in the Church of England to make this change. There are now places for 20 choristers and 6 lay clerks."]}, {"page": "Albert Square, Manchester", "response": ["* the Abbey National building (c.1900), Grade II listed \u2013 Neoclassical Portland stone bank by Percy Worthington with semicircular front."]}, {"page": "Ullet Road Unitarian Church", "response": ["The predecessors of the congregation now worshipping in Ullet Road originated from a group of Presbyterians during the later part of the 17th\u00a0century, that is, in the immediate aftermath of the English Civil War.

In 1811 they moved to another new chapel in Renshaw Street, and by this time had become Unitarians, as many English Presbyterians did.  Despite some opposition, in 1894 the congregation decided to move to what was then a suburb of Liverpool.  The architects Thomas and Percy Worthington, Unitarians from Manchester, were commissioned to design the church and associated buildings.  The church opened in June 1899, followed by the hall and other associated buildings in 1902.", "To the east of the library is a cloister leading to the church hall.

The cloister contains memorials moved from the previous chapels.
