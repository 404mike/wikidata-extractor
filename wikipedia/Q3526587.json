An accumulator of runs rather than a stroke maker, he very occasionally allowed himself to bat more freely, and when he did he revealed himself as a particularly fine cutter. He scored centuries in four consecutive innings for Yorkshire in 1933.\nHe was a particularly fine close-in fieldsman, noted for taking catches off the bowling of Hedley Verity. The Yorkshire cricket journalist John Bapty said of Mitchell's fielding: \"His skill became such, and his fame mounted so that there were times when it was said he had missed a catch that never would have been accounted a chance had he not made it one.\"Mitchell's Test cricket career might have consisted of just three matches on the 1933-34 tour of India, when he performed without distinction in what was, in effect, an England second eleven. But an injury to Maurice Leyland just before the Headingley Test against South Africa in 1935 led to Mitchell being summoned, literally, from his back garden. With scores of 58 and 72, he retained his place for the final Test, and played once more, against India in 1936.\nHis first-class career lasted from 1922 to 1945. Mitchell was appointed county coach to Yorkshire after World War II, and remained in the job until 1970.He died in December 1976 in Bradford, Yorkshire, at the age of 74.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Fred Trueman", "response": ["In his autobiography, Trueman acknowledged his debt to Cyril Turner, \"a superb coach\", who taught him how to \"hold the ball properly\", enable it to swing both ways and how to follow through properly to complete his bowling action.As It Was, p. 34. Trueman played some matches for Sheffield United's Second XI team in the 1947 season and was then promoted to the first team so that he could play in the Yorkshire Council League.As It Was, p. 35.

In his first match, against Cambridge University, he was run out for a duck but scored an unbeaten 50 runs in his second match; he followed this with another half-century against Warwickshire on his County Championship debut.Howat, pp. 15\u201316. He played regularly for the rest of the season but to prevent his overexposure to Championship cricket, Yorkshire limited his appearances and returned him periodically to the second eleven.Howat, pp. 19\u201320. In matches for the first team, Hutton shared large first-wicket partnerships with Wilf BarberHowat, p. 16. and with Arthur Mitchell, before scoring his maiden first-class century in an innings of 196 against Worcestershire.Howat, p. 19.

Christopher Douglas judges that Jardine did very well to keep the team united and loyal on the Bodyline tour. He points out that team spirit was always excellent and the players showed great determination and resolve.Douglas, p. 161. Jardine particularly impressed Yorkshiremen who played under him, as they believed he thought about cricket in a similar way to their county colleagues. He became close to Herbert Sutcliffe during the Bodyline tour, even though Sutcliffe was sceptical about Jardine on the previous Australian tour in 1928\u201329. Hedley Verity was impressed by Jardine's tactical understanding and named his younger son Douglas after the captain.Hill, pp. 75, 79\u201380. Bill Bowes expressed approval of his leadership after initial misgivings,Bowes, pp. 100\u201301. and went on to call him England's greatest captain.

They had won the championship four times between 1922 and 1925 but had since then been overshadowed by their great rivals Lancashire who had won the title in each of the preceding three seasons. In 1929, Yorkshire and Lancashire tied on points as runners-up, the title going to Nottinghamshire. Yorkshire's team relied on the experience and leadership of the veterans Rhodes and Robinson and on the expertise of established professionals like Sutcliffe, his opening partner Percy Holmes, Leyland and bowler George Macaulay. Otherwise, the team consisted of up and coming players who were effectively on trial and there was competition for places. Bowes, for example, had Frank Dennis as his main rival for the role of pace bowler. Other aspiring players active in 1929 were Wilf Barber, Horace Fisher, Arthur Wood and Cyril Turner while Arthur Mitchell had gained his county cap the previous year. Waiting in the wings, however, was Hedley Verity who was then playing in the Lancashire League and made his Yorkshire debut in 1930."]}, {"page": "Harold Gimblett", "response": ["That Wisden assessment was made to look unduly modest within weeks of the start of the 1936 season. Regular opening batsman Jack Lee had been allowed to leave Somerset to become coach at Mill Hill School, and Gimblett was promoted to open the innings against the Indians in Somerset's first match of the season. He made 103 and then an unbeaten 46 as Somerset won the match by nine wickets after making the Indians follow on. In the very next match against Lancashire at Old Trafford, he did even better with 93 in the first innings and an unbeaten 160 in the second, when he held on with the Somerset tail-enders to deny Lancashire victory. That gave him fleetingly a season's batting average of more than 200, and he followed that up with a third century a week later against the admittedly weak Northamptonshire side. This form earned Gimblett selection for the Test trial match for the series against the Indian team, a match between North and South at Lord's that featured a mix of established Test players and up-and-coming young players. Gimblett failed in the match, scoring just four runs in his only innings.

Mitchell was a dour, serious man but the contrast with the cheerier Leyland made an effective partnership. Leyland also served as a representative of the paper manufacturers Thomas Owen.Hill, p. 186. In 1949, he was among the first group of former professional cricketers to be awarded honorary membership of the MCC. He continued as a respected coach of Yorkshire until illness forced his retirement in 1963. Suffering from Parkinson's disease, he maintained some connections with Yorkshire cricket and always tried to attend matches played at Harrogate. In recognition of his achievements, the Harrogate grounds erected new gates which were named in his honour.

A generally defensive batsman, he played carefully in the tradition of Yorkshire opening batsmen. Jim Kilburn said that Barber was \"small in stature but upright in style\".Hodgson, p. 123. He was a good batsman on the off side and had a very good defensive technique, while his strength on the leg side was noted on his Test debut. Although an opening batsman, he often went in lower down the batting order. He was more comfortable in normal circumstances than in a crisis and did not enjoy batting on difficult pitches. Bill Bowes called him the most correct and orthodox batsman he had seen, even more so than Len Hutton. Barber was a kind, modest man, who never believed that his contribution was good enough, even if he had scored a century.Bowes, p. 145. On his death, Wisden described him as having \"rendered admirable service.\"", "Barber's highest score was 255 against Surrey in 1935. In this innings, he opened the batting and shared three successive century partnerships. Barber also scored 248 against Kent in 1934. He had scored 73 in the first innings but Kent had built up a lead of 148 on the second day of the match. Barber, opening the batting with Len Hutton, scored 248 and shared a stand of 267 for the first wicket. As a result, Yorkshire drew the game. Barber shared in seven other century opening partnerships Yorkshire, four of them with Arthur Mitchell, and six other 200 partnerships. This included a stand of 346 in four and a half hours with Maurice Leyland, against Middlesex in 1932 which was a record for Yorkshire's second wicket. His fielding, generally done in the deep, was described by Wisden as \"first rate\". Bowes said that he once went for nearly three years without dropping a catch on the leg side boundary from his bowling.Bowes, p. 85."]}, {"page": "1939 English cricket season", "response": ["Yorkshire were captained by Brian Sellers, whose efforts earned him a place in Wisdens \"Five Cricketers of the Year\".

The bowling depended on Hedley Verity (165 wickets), Ellis Robinson (102), Bill Bowes (96) and Frank Smailes (49).  The wicket-keeper was Arthur Wood who completed 39 catches and 27 stumpings.

Otherwise the team was unchanged apart from representative calls and Yorkshire generally sent out Sutcliffe, Holmes, Leyland, Oldroyd, Kilner, Rhodes, Robinson, Lupton, Macaulay, Dolphin and Waddington in 1925.

As his career continued, Cutmore rose up the Essex batting line-up, even opening the innings on occasion; in 1927, he opened the batting in an away match against Gloucestershire at Greenbank and went on to make his career best score of 238 not out before Essex declared on 578/6. By the end of his career, Cutmore had settled near the top of the middle-order. His final appearance came on 17 June 1936, away to Yorkshire; with Essex batting second, Cutmore came in at number 3 and made 21 runs before being trapped LBW by Bill Bowes; in the second innings, he opened the batting, but this time made only 13 runs before he was caught by Arthur Mitchell off the bowling of Hedley Verity."]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1919\u20131939)", "response": ["* Arthur Mitchell (1933/34) : A.

Opposing batsmen always knew that they would face a formidable attack, not least the two all-time greats Wilfred Rhodes through the 1920s and his successor Hedley Verity in the thirties. Yorkshire also called upon England bowlers George Macaulay, Roy Kilner, Abe Waddington, Bill Bowes and Frank Smailes.
