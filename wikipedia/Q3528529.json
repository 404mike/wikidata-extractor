In 1890 he was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year. He toured Australia three times and North America once. Barnes was on the groundstaff at Lord's between 1895 and 1898 and umpired as required. He was landlord of the Angel Inn, Mansfield Woodhouse in the off-season. It is there that he died in March 1899.\nAlthough he played cricket professionally, this was only a summer occupation, and in the 1881 Census he listed his profession as a cotton weaver. His brother, Thomas, and nephew, James Barnes, both played first-class cricket.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "May 27", "response": ["*1852 \u2013 Billy Barnes, English cricketer (d. 1899)"]}, {"page": "1880 in sports", "response": ["* Most runs \u2013 Billy Barnes 1,220 @ 28.37 (HS 143)"]}, {"page": "1885 in sports", "response": ["* Most runs \u2013 Billy Barnes 520 @ 43.33 (HS 134)"]}, {"page": "1889 in sports", "response": ["* Wisden Nine Great Batsmen of the Year \u2013 Bobby Abel, Billy Barnes, Billy Gunn, Louis Hall, Robert Henderson, Maurice Read, Arthur Shrewsbury, Frank Sugg, Albert Ward "]}, {"page": "List of Test cricket records", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:left;\"| Billy Barnes || 793 || 51"]}, {"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["| colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|  Bobby Abel,  Billy Barnes,  Billy Gunn,  Louis Hall,  Robert Henderson,  Maurice Read,  Arthur Shrewsbury,  Frank Sugg,  Albert Ward"]}, {"page": "Arthur Shrewsbury", "response": ["In 1882 Shrewsbury scored his maiden first-class double century, the first double century by a Nottinghamshire cricketer, an innings of 207 at The OvalSurrey v Nottinghamshire 1882, Scorecard, CricketArchive, Retrieved on 18 October 2007 sharing in a stand of 289 with Billy Barnes, a first-class second wicket record.

In the Second Test at Lord's Shrewsbury demonstrated his ability on sticky wickets against top bowling: against a side containing Spofforth, the finest bowler of the era, he finished the rain-interrupted first day unbeaten on 91, and carried this to 164 in easier conditions on the second day. The second highest score in the match was 58 by Billy Barnes, and Australia lost by an innings. England completed a whitewash with another innings victory at The Oval.

In the three Tests against Australia, Briggs, Bobby Peel and Billy Barnes did so well that Lohmann had to do little bowling at the Oval and Old Trafford. However, he took eight wickets at Lord's and made his only Test fifty at the Oval. In 1889, Lohmann again took over 200 wickets (115 for 1485 runs in purely county matches) and took nine wickets in an innings for the first time against Sussex."]}, {"page": "Martin Hawke, 7th Baron Hawke", "response": ["In the two years when Hawke had private tuition at home, from summer 1879 to October 1881, he played for the York-based Yorkshire Gentlemen's Cricket Club, whose leading light was the Reverend Edmund Carter, a man whose influence would guide Hawke towards the captaincy of Yorkshire.Coldham, p. 35. In September 1881, Carter invited Hawke to the Scarborough Festival where he made his first-class debut for Yorkshire on 1 and 2 September, two weeks after his 21st birthday.Hodgson, p. 47. The match was Yorkshire v Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at North Marine Road and Hawke, who was bowled by Billy Barnes in both innings, scored 4 and 0. MCC won by an innings and 35 runs. A few days later, in another Festival match, Hawke played for Yorkshire against I Zingari and made a top score of 32 in Yorkshire's second innings as they were beaten by 159 runs.Coldham, p. 37.", "Hawke enjoyed a personal success in the second match of the 1883 season when he scored his maiden first-class century with 141 for Cambridge against C I Thornton's XI at Fenner's. He shared a third wicket partnership of 160 with Cambridge captain Charles Studd against a bowling attack that included Test players Billy Barnes, Ted Peate and George Ulyett. The match was drawn due to interruptions by rain after Thornton's XI scored 175 and 229; Cambridge replied with 317 and 44\u20133."]}, {"page": "History of Test cricket from 1884 to 1889", "response": ["The game itself started well for Australia, who were 190 for 4 when Percy McDonnell went for 124.

Billy Barnes scored 134, as they went on to get 369. In reply, Australia, who were missing Bannerman through injury, could only make 191. England won by 8 wickets. "]}, {"page": "J. J. Ferris", "response": ["Born in Sydney, Australia, Ferris made his first-class debut for New South Wales against Alfred Shaw's touring English team on his home ground in 1886/87. He took seven wickets in the match, including five in the second innings, and after several more good displays was selected for the first Test, also at Sydney. The England first innings was a disaster as they collapsed to what remains their lowest Test total of 45 all out, Ferris bowling unchanged with Charlie Turner, but despite his nine wickets in the game England, inspired by Billy Barnes' second-innings 6\u201328, scraped to a 13-run win."]}, {"page": "List of England Test cricketers", "response": ["The early years of Test cricket saw a number of tours to Australia. Most of these tours were professional in nature, and as the sea voyage was around 42 days and the tours lasted many months, the sides were selected as much on availability as on cricketing aptitude. As a result of this, coupled with there only being a small number of Tests being played, there are many early cricketers with Test records of only a few matches. The key players who had their Test debut during this period include the great professional all-rounders George Ulyett (11), who played 25 Tests, and Billy Barnes (21), who played 21. England's Champion cricketer WG Grace (24) first played Test cricket in 1880. Although Test match cricket had not been invented in his heyday of the late 1860s and 1870s, he continued playing into his fifties, finally retiring from Test cricket at the turn of the century. Shrewsbury (35) and Stoddart (56) go down amongst the great captains of the period, as well as two of the many cricketing suicides. Johnny Briggs (47), who, bedevilled by mental illness, died young, notched up the most Test caps of the earliest era of Test match cricket."]}, {"page": "Reginald Wood", "response": ["The son of John Wood, a Birkenhead merchant, and Montreal-born Elizabeth, he was educated at Charterhouse and played six matches for Lancashire County Cricket Club as an amateur before emigrating to Australia. In 1885, he played two matches as a professional for Victoria, and then, when Billy Barnes was ruled out of a number of matches in Alfred Shaw's tour of Australia in 1886-87 after Barnes hit a wall rather than Australian captain Percy McDonnell, whom he was aiming for, the Englishmen had to find a replacement quickly. Wood was found and played three matches for Shaw's XI, the second one of which was the Second Test. He did not bowl and batted at number ten, scoring 0 and 6 and after one final game with the touring Englishmen never played first-class cricket again."]}]}}
