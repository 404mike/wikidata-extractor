In the quarter-final against Australia, Robinson returned to the side as full back and played his part in a tense 12\u201310 victory over the Wallabies. In the semi-final victory over France, his 50th cap, he was given the honour of leading out the England team.

James Lang's late penalty attempt would have won them the game, and secured their place in the play-offs had it gone over, but it was inexplicably taken at least a metre behind where it had been awarded in the view of TV pundit and former player Austin Healy and ultimately fell under the crossbar by \"the distance Austin was talking about that they were marched back,\" according to fellow pundit and his former teammate Ben Kay."]}]}}
