Her focus is women's movements, and her central question is how they and the state influence each other. Interests and law are the categories under which she examines the changeable and shapeable relationship of the gender order and the state. She wants to bring back the state and the political subject into the thinking on modernisation, democratisation and development.\nMolyneux studied sociology at the University of Essex and is now Professor of Sociology and Director of the Institute of the Americas, University College London. Her research, as well the influential distinction between gender needs and interests, deals with such subjects as society and development, poverty and social inequality, and gender and politics in Latin America. She is also a consultant to several United Nations organisations, as well as to Oxfam and other NGOs. As co-founder in 1979 of the noted magazine Feminist Review and an editor of the magazine Economy and Society, she is involved in the further development of debates on theory.Molyneux was married to Fred Halliday, with whom she had a son, Alex.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of feminists", "response": ["|1940\u20131999||data-sort-value=\"Molyneux, Maxine\"|Maxine Molyneux||United Kingdom||1948||\u2013||||"]}, {"page": "Molyneux", "response": ["* Maxine Molyneux (born 1948), British sociologist and feminist"]}, {"page": "Fred Halliday", "response": ["Halliday was formerly married to Maxine Molyneux and they have one son, Alex.

Hassim particularly focuses on the tension between the ideologies of feminism and nationalism as motivators for the women's movement in the last several years of Apartheid and the first few years of democratic governance. Part of this tension stemmed from the perception that issues important to women specifically were distractions from the goal of dismantling the racist political system, even though women were a key constituency in the fight to build a new political regime. Hassim incorporates feminist scholarship from Africa, Latin America, Europe and the United States to demonstrate that the women's organizations she studies were not just feminist or nationalist but rather were both at the same time. Hassim also builds on work by Maxine Molyneux to study the autonomy of the women's movements in South African liberation activism, and particularly to understand the potential for women's activism to be co-opted by one of the other ideologies it followed or employed rhetoric from. Women's organizations and democracy in South Africa won the 2007 Victoria Schuck Award from the American Political Science Association, which is an annual prize granted to the author of the best book published in the previous year on the topic of on women and politics."]}]}}
