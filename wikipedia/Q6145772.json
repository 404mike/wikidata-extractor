He had a run of seven matches at left back early in the 1919\u201320 Football League season and made four more appearances later on, in each case covering for one or other of the regular backs, Fred Bullock and James Wood, as Huddersfield finished second in the table and were promoted to the First Division. The new season began in similar vein: with Wood injured, Rodgerson partnered Bullock in four matches, after which Huddersfield were top of the table, but as soon as Wood regained fitness Rodgerson lost his place. For much of the middle part of the season, Rodgerson was in the side, and he took his top-flight appearance total to 14. His last was on 12 February, and in March, he signed for Leeds United of the Second Division."]}, {"page": "1922\u201323 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["|James Wood||||DF||7||0||0||0||7||0"]}, {"page": "1921\u201322 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["|James Wood||||DF||36||0||9||0||45||0"]}, {"page": "1920\u201321 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["|James Wood||||DF||34||0||2||0||36||0"]}, {"page": "1919\u201320 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["|James Wood||||DF||39||0||6||0||45||0"]}, {"page": "1914\u201315 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season", "response": ["|James Wood||||DF||11||0||0||0||11||0"]}, {"page": "List of people with surname Wood", "response": ["* James Wood (disambiguation), several people", ":* James Wood (Canadian admiral) (born 1934), Canadian admiral", ":* James Wood (composer), composer, percussionist and conductor", ":* James Wood (critic) (born 1965), British literary critic and novelist", ":* James Wood (encyclopaedist) (1820\u20131901), British editor of The Nuttall Encyclopaedia", ":* James Wood (engineer), American engineer", ":* James Wood (governor) (1741\u20131813), Governor of Virginia and officer in the American Revolutionary War", ":* James Wood (musician) (born 1953), British composer and percussionist", ":* James Wood (New York politician) (1820\u20131892), New York politician and Union Army general", ":* James Wood (Irish politician) (1865\u20131936), Member of Parliament for East Down, 1902\u20131906", ":* James Wood (footballer) (1893\u2013?), professional footballer, who played for South Shields, Huddersfield Town and Blackpool", ":* James Wood (South African cricketer) (born 1985), South African cricketer, played for Durham UCCE", ":* James Wood (Lancashire cricketer) (1933\u20131977), English cricketer for Lancashire 1954\u201356", ":* James Wood (mathematician) (1760\u20131839), Dean of Ely 1820\u20131839", ":* James Wood (minister) (1672\u20131759), English Presbyterian minister", ":* James Wood Bush (c. 1844\u20131906), Hawaiian-American Civil War combatant", ":* Sir James Wood, 2nd Baronet (died 1738), Scottish officer of the Dutch States Army and later the British Army", ":* James Wood, Lord Irwin (born 1977), British courtesy peer", ":* Robert James Wood (1886\u20131954), Liberal party member of the Canadian House of Commons"]}, {"page": "List of Huddersfield Town A.F.C. players", "response": ["|James Wood||||1915\u20131922||127||0||17||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||144||0"]}, {"page": "1922 FA Charity Shield", "response": ["| ||2 || James Wood"]}]}}
