Stylistically her artwork was affiliated with surrealism.  In the late 1930s, Colquhoun was part of the British Surrealist Group before being expelled because she refused to renounce her association with occult groups.\nColquhoun was born in Shillong, Eastern Bengal and Assam, British India, but brought up in the United Kingdom.  After studying at the Slade School of Art, she lived briefly in Paris before moving back to London.  She spent the latter part of her life in Cornwall, where she died in 1988.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Surrealist techniques", "response": ["Entopic graphomania is a surrealist and automatic method of drawing in which dots are made at the sites of impurities in a blank sheet of paper, and lines are then made between the dots; these can be either \"curved lines... or straight lines.\".
