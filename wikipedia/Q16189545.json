It was also added to the developer's sale brochures and on cushions in show flats. As the paint faded, Urban Splash commissioned a neon sign in 2011 that was installed on the bridge directly over the words to make them permanent and visible at night, taking inspiration from the neon sign light artworks of Tracey Emin. The Thornbridge Brewery made an \"I Love You Will U Marry Me\" strawberry blonde ale, bottles of which were presented to buyers of flats. It was the inspiration for several musicians, including a 2012 song \"The I Love You bridge\" by The Crookes and a 2017 song \"I Love You, Will You Marry Me\" by Yungblud."]}]}}
