XCU was a memorandum dated 5 October 1946, and signed by then-Rear Admiral Harold Kinahan. In an admiralty document submitted as part of a United Kingdom memorial to the ICJ, there was a reference to XCU. As a result of this reference, Albania requested the ICJ order the production of XCU, a request which the Court accepted. The ICJ invoked Article 49 of its statute to order production of XCU. According to Anthony Carty, this support for Albania's claim came as a surprise, and Shawcross had not at that point examined the sailing orders. The document posed a problem for him: Shawcross believed it worked against the innocent passage argument. The consensus of the advisers was that XCU might be interpreted as evidence of hostility on part of the UK. The Admiralty argued that the Court should examine the actions of the flotilla on the day in question, rather than, as Carty describes, \"the confused and contradictory expressions of the British Administration through such documents as XCU\". Citing national security, the Agent for the United Kingdom refused to produce XCU. In its merits judgment, the Court generally accepted the Admiralty's argument, holding that the refusal could not lead to \"any conclusions differing from those to which the actual events gave rise\". In the decades following the case, XCU and related documents were declassified."]}, {"page": "Royal Naval College, Greenwich", "response": ["*Admiral Sir Harold Kinahan (1950\u20131952)"]}, {"page": "Kinahan", "response": ["*Harold Kinahan (1893-1980), British Royal Navy officer"]}]}}
