He suffered a nervous breakdown in 1843, recuperating over the next two years. In 1850 he started a photographic studio in Liverpool, known as Frith & Hayward.  A successful grocer, and later, printer, Frith fostered an interest in photography, becoming a founding member of the Liverpool Photographic Society in 1853. Frith sold his companies in 1855 in order to dedicate himself entirely to photography. He journeyed to the Middle East on three occasions, the first of which was a trip to Egypt in 1856 with very large cameras (16\" x 20\"). He used the collodion process, a major technical achievement in hot and dusty conditions. Photographs taken by Frith are held in the Conway Library of Art and Architecture at the Courtauld in London.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Postcard", "response": ["*Francis Frith"]}, {"page": "List of photographers", "response": ["* Francis Frith (1822\u20131898)"]}, {"page": "Chesterfield, Derbyshire", "response": ["*Francis Frith (1822\u20131898), photographer and liberal Quaker"]}, {"page": "John Sergeant (journalist)", "response": ["Sergeant presented Britain's First Photo Album about the pioneering photography of Francis Frith.

They competed with Francis Frith and George Washington Wilson, who were producing pictures of similar quality. Landscapes were available in a choice of sizes - cabinet, imperial and card. Stereoscopic and magic lantern slides views were also produced. Valentines called themselves 'photographic publishers' and reproduced a great variety of photographic goods as well as the postcards for which they are best known. Subjects concentrated on tourist sights in Scotland, then to England in 1882 and on to fashionable resorts abroad, including Norway, Jamaica, Tangiers, Morocco, Madeira and New Zealand before 1900."]}]}}
