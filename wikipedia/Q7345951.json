The Ju 87s bombed the station and 40 Bf 109s strafed it, killing the commander.Bungay 2000, p. 211. The operations block was hit, causing high casualties. The losses were disastrous for No. 53 Squadron RAF, which lost a number of Blenheims on the ground.Warner 2005, p. 258.

He scored his first aerial victory with them, sending an Albatros D.V down out of control on 12 August 1917. He was then posted to No. 8 Naval Squadron and flew the Sopwith Camel for his remaining ten victories. During December 1917, he teamed with Guy William Price to drive down DFW two-seater reconnaissance aircraft on three different days. Fighting solo, Day destroyed one enemy aircraft and drove down three others during January 1918. On 2 February 1918, he joined Robert J. O. Compston and three other RNAS pilots in destroying a German reconnaissance aircraft, and in driving down an Albatros D.V later in the day. On 5 February, he joined three other RNAS pilots in destroying a reconnaissance machine; that brought his total to one enemy aircraft destroyed solo, two more shared, and eight driven down out of control. He then dived on another German aircraft. Day's Camel came to pieces during the dive, plummeting him to his death.Franks (2003), p.23.
