He joined the Baptist missionaries in the Danish colony of Frederiksnagar in Serampore. One of his first contributions was to start schools for impoverished children where they were taught reading, writing, accounting and Christianity.  He opened the first theological university in Serampore offering divinity degrees, and campaigned to end the practice of sati.Carey is known as the \"father of modern missions.\"  His essay, An Enquiry into the Obligations of Christians to Use Means for the Conversion of the Heathens, led to the founding of the Baptist Missionary Society.  The Asiatic Society commended Carey for \u201chis eminent services in opening the stores of Indian literature to the knowledge of Europe and for his extensive acquaintance with the science, the natural history and botany of this country and his useful contributions, in every branch.\u201dHe translated the Hindu classic, the Ramayana, into English, and the Bible into Bengali, Oriya, Assamese, Marathi, Hindi and Sanskrit.

Carey's dictionary had fewer entries and Marathi words were in Devanagari. Translations of the Bible were first books to be printed in Marathi. These translations by William Carey, the American Marathi mission and the Scottish missionaries led to the development of a peculiar pidginized Marathi called \"Missionary Marathi\u201d in the early 1800s. The most comprehensive Marathi-English dictionary was compiled by Captain James Thomas Molesworth and Major Thomas Candy in 1831. The book is still in print nearly two centuries after its publication.", "The first Marathi translation of the New Testament was published in 1811 by the Serampore press of William Carey.

First Marathi periodical Dirghadarshan was started in 1840. ", "The Kadamba script and its variants have been historically used to write Marathi in the form of inscriptions on stones and copper plates. The Marathi version of Devanagari, called Balbodh, is similar to the Hindi Devanagari alphabet except for its use for certain words. Some words in Marathi preserve  the schwa, which has been omitted in other languages which use Devanagari. For example, the word '\u0930\u0902\u0917' (colour) is pronounced as 'ranga' in Marathi & 'rang' in other languages using Devanagari, and '\u0916\u0930\u0902' (true), despite the anuswara, is pronounced as 'khara'. The anuswara in this case is used to avoid schwa deletion in pronunciation; most other languages using Devanagari show schwa deletion in pronunciation despite the presence of schwa in the written spelling. From the 13th century until the beginning of British rule in 19th century, Marathi was written in the Modi script for administrative purposes but in Devanagari for literature. Since 1950 it has been written in the Balbodh style of Devanagari. Except for Father Stephen's Krista Purana in the Latin script in the 1600s, Marathi has mainly been printed in Devanagari because William Carey, the pioneer of printing in Indian languages, was only able to print in Devanagari. He later tried printing in Modi but by that time, Balbodh Devanagari had been accepted for printing.", "Marathi grammar shares similarities with other modern Indo-Aryan languages.

The ban which was extended to whole country is credited with bringing an end of the practice of Sati in India. It was first major social reform legislation done by the British in India  The most prominent campaigners to end  the practice of sati were led by British Christian evangelists, such as William Carey, and Hindu reformers such as Ram Mohan Roy. The opposition came from some conservative Hindus led by Radhakanta Deb and the Dharma Sabha who saw the ban as an interference in Hindu religious affairs and violation of George III's Statute 37. This statute had assured Hindus complete non-interference with their religion. This resulted in a challenge to the decision to ban Sati in the Privy Council but the ban was upheld with four out of the seven privy councillors supporting the ban. These were followed up with other legislation, countering what the British perceived to be interrelated issues involving violence against Hindu women, including: Hindu Widows' Remarriage Act, 1856, Female Infanticide Prevention Act, 1870, and Age of Consent Act, 1891.", "The first official British response to sati was in 1680 when the Agent of Madras Streynsham Master  intervened and prohibited the burning of a Hindu widow  in Madras Presidency  and attempts to limit or ban the practice had been made by individual British officers but without the backing of the East India Company as it followed a policy  of non-interference in Hindu religious affairs  and there was no legislation or ban against Sati. The first formal British ban was imposed in 1798, in the city of Calcutta only. The practice continued in surrounding regions. In the beginning of the 19th century, the evangelical church in Britain, and its members in India, started campaigns against sati. This activism came about during a period when British missionaries in India began focusing on promoting and establishing Christian educational systems as a distinctive contribution of theirs to the missionary enterprise as a whole. Leaders of these campaigns included William Carey and William Wilberforce. These movements put pressure on the company to ban the act. William Carey, and the other missionaries at Serampore conducted in 1803\u201304 a census on cases of sati for a region within a 30-mile radius of Calcutta, finding more than 300 such cases there. Carey's actual figures for the year 1803 was 275; for the months April\u2013October 1804, the missionaries arrived at the figure 115. For 1803 and 1804 statistics  More detailed on figures in  The missionaries also approached Hindu theologians, who opined that the practice was encouraged, rather than enjoined by the Hindu scriptures.", "The Principal campaigners against Sati were Christian and Hindu reformers such as William Carey and Ram Mohan Roy. In 1799 Carey, a Baptist missionary from England, first witnessed the burning of a widow on her husband's funeral pyre. Horrified by the practice, Carey and his coworkers Joshua Marshman and William Ward opposed sati from that point onward, lobbying for its abolishment. Known as the Serampore Trio, they published essays forcefully condemning the practice and presented an address against Sati to then Governor General of India, Lord Wellesley.", "Thus on Sunday morning of 4 December 1829 Lord Bentinck issued Regulation XVII declaring Sati to be illegal and punishable in criminal courts. It was presented to William Carey for translation. His response is recorded as follows: \u201cSpringing to his feet and throwing off his black coat he cried, 'No church for me to-day... If I delay an hour to translate and publish this, many a widow\u2019s life may be sacrificed,' he said. By evening the task was finished.\u201dSharma pp. 7\u20138."]}]}}
