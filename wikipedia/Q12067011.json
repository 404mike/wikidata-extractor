The porch is open, forming a narthex, and is supported on grey stone columns with foliated capitals. The tower is in two stages with angle buttresses and has a stair turret on its northwest. The lower stage is square with a west door and three stepped lancet windows on the north side. The upper stage is octagonal and contains four louvred lancet bell openings, between which are statues under trefoil-headed canopies. The statues are representations of Saint\u00a0Ambrose, Saint\u00a0Augustine, Saint\u00a0Gregory, and Saint\u00a0Jerome, the four Latin Fathers, by James Redfern. They were originally intended for the north porch of Bristol Cathedral but the dean said they were papist and they were rescued by Street. The spire is also octagonal, and contains lucarnes and quatrefoil windows in roundels, with a wrought iron cross on its summit. It is  high. The chancel has an apse and contains lancet windows; it also has a wrought iron cross on the summit of its roof.
