The late Metal Hammer journalist Detlef Dengler called Walkyier a \"great lyricist\" known for his multitude of words and \"brilliant puns. \"Yet Walkyier was never asked to write lyrics for other bands, \"unfortunately\" as he says. Author Paul Stenning has referred to Walkyier as a \"lyrical genius\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Newcastle upon Tyne", "response": ["Lindisfarne are a folk-rock group with a strong Tyneside connection.

Folk metal band Skyclad, often regarded as the first folk metal band, also formed in Newcastle after the break-up of Martin Walkyier thrash metal band, Sabbat. Andy Taylor, former lead guitarist of Duran Duran was born here in 1961. Brian Johnson was a member of local rock band Geordie before becoming the lead vocalist for Australian band AC/DC, with whom he'd release Back in Black, the 2nd best-selling studio album of all time, and the 4th biggest seller in the USA."]}, {"page": "Folk metal", "response": ["The English band Skyclad was formed in 1990 after vocalist Martin Walkyier left his previous band, Sabbat. Skyclad began as a thrash metal band but added violins from session musician Mike Evans on several tracks from their debut album, The Wayward Sons of Mother Earth, an effort described by Eduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic as \"ambitious\" and \"groundbreaking.\" The song \"The Widdershins Jig\" from the debut album has been acclaimed as \"particularly significant\" and \"a certain first in the realms of Metal\".

In contrast, the Portuguese band Moonspell had a brief tenure in the genre. Their first release was the 1994 Under the Moonspell EP with music that featured Lusitanian folk and Medieval influences. With the release of their debut album Wolfheart in the following year, the band made a transition into gothic metal and within a matter of years \"quickly evolved into one of the major players of the European goth-metal scene.\"", "Folk metal has been associated with paganism ever since its inception, when Martin Walkyier left his former band Sabbat to form Skyclad, in part because the band \"wasn't going to go far enough down the pagan, British way that we wanted to do it.\" Consequently, the lyrics of Skyclad have been known to deal with pagan matters. The band Cruachan was also founded by a self-described pagan, Keith Fay. For Ville Sorvali of Moonsorrow, the label \"pagan metal\" is preferred \"because that describes the ideological points in the music, but doesn\u2019t say anything about the music itself.\" Other bands that also prefer to use the term \"pagan metal\" as a self-description include Cruachan, Eluveitie, Obtest and Skyforger.
