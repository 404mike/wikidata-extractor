Here he completed a Donne sulla spiaggia di Porto d'Anzio (Girl on the Beach of Porto d'Anzio). He also became known as a landscape-painter of remarkable originality, and of great influence in the return to minute observation of nature. He painted, mainly rustic scenes involving herders and cattle. He was a major inspiration to the artists known as the Macchiaioli, and also had many English and American friends and followers, notably Elihu Vedder, Matthew Ridley Corbet (1850\u20131902) and his wife Edith Corbet, and Lord Carlisle, and was closely associated with Corot and the Barbizon school, whom he met while visiting Paris.. In 1853, he established a lifetime friendship with a young Frederick Leighton, who was then sojourning in Rome."]}, {"page": "1920 in art", "response": ["* date unknown \u2013 Edith Corbet, Australian-born British landscape painter (b. 1846)"]}, {"page": "List of Australian artists", "response": ["* Edith Corbet (1846\u20131920): landscape painter"]}, {"page": "Corbet (surname)", "response": ["* Edith Corbet n\u00e9e Edenborough (1846\u20131920), Victorian landscape painter"]}, {"page": "Edith Ridley Corbet", "response": ["#REDIRECT Edith Corbet"]}, {"page": "Joaqu\u00edn Clausell", "response": ["While he drew cartoons as a young student, his interest in painting was peaked when in Paris, attending an 1896 exhibition of Camille Pissarro, whose work impressed him. Clausell is generally considered to have been self-taught or described as a kind of genius by contemporary newspapers, although art historian Xavier Moyssen believes he might have had formal instruction. There are no records in art schools in Paris or Mexico City that indicate that he attended courses at these institutions nor do any of his personal documents or family accounts indicate such study. However, Moyssen believes that several works, copies of works by other painters, were probably done with Clausell in the role of student. These include a copy of a work by Edith Corbet, with Clausell dedicated on the back to Van Gogh, Cezanne and Monet, the oldest known work of the artist. He also did a copy of Alberto Fuster's \u201cRetrato de un mujer,\u201d a non-landscape piece, in 1902."]}, {"page": "Edith Edenborough", "response": ["#REDIRECT Edith Corbet"]}, {"page": "Edith Murch", "response": ["#REDIRECT Edith Corbet"]}, {"page": "List of Australian women artists", "response": ["*Edith Corbet (1846\u20131920), landscape painter"]}, {"page": "List of English women artists", "response": ["*Edith Corbet (1846\u20131920), painter"]}]}}
