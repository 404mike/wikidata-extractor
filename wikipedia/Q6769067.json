David Riley \"discussed a transfer\", but remained at the club despite being unhappy at starting the season from the bench. A weak defensive performance then cost them at home to Chester City, though Rudge was happy with the performance of Simon Mills, a midfielder who was learning a new position at right-back. A disciplined performance was enough to win a point away at Bury, with goalkeeper Mark Grew in impressive form. With Atkinson injured and Steve Harper out of form, Rudge tried unsuccessfully to bring in Liverpool's Steve Staunton and Bournemouth's Mark O'Connor on loan. The campaign though kicked into gear with \"a stunningly ruthless\" 6\u20131 thrashing of \"a by no means inadequate\" Cardiff City. They followed this up with a 5\u20130 mauling of a \"dreadful\" Chesterfield \u2013 Darren Beckford claiming a hat-trick \u2013 and moved to the top of the table. They ended September with a 1\u20130 win over Bristol City, as the Vale defence proved its effectiveness."]}, {"page": "1995\u201396 Gillingham F.C. season", "response": ["Pulis significantly rebuilt the team ahead of the new season, with eight new players joining the club.  Three new signings were announced at the same time as Scally's takeover and the appointment of Pulis: forward Leo Fortune-West joined from non-League club Stevenage Borough for a transfer fee of \u00a35,000, which was donated by Gillingham's official supporters' club from funds collected earlier in the year as part of its efforts to save the club, goalkeeper Jim Stannard was signed from Fulham, and Kevin Rattray arrived from non-League club Woking.  Subsequent signings included midfielder Mark O'Connor, who had previously played for the club between 1989 and 1993; he had played under Pulis's management at Bournemouth.  Midfielder Dave Martin joined from Bristol City on a free transfer and was immediately installed as the new club captain.  Simon Ratcliffe joined from Brentford, and shortly before the first match of the season, Mark Harris and Dominic Naylor arrived from Swansea City and Plymouth Argyle respectively.  The team prepared for the new season with a number of friendly matches, including one against Premier League club Chelsea, who sent a full-strength team including high-profile new signings  Ruud Gullit and Mark Hughes.  The match drew a crowd of over 10,000, with many more turned away, and provided a significant funding boost for the club.  Gillingham adopted a new first-choice kit featuring blue and black striped shirts; the second-choice shirts, to be worn in the event of a clash of colours with the opposition, were red and black.  The team were forced to wear the previous season's kit for the first four games, however, as the suppliers of the new kit failed to deliver it on time."]}, {"page": "1992\u201393 Gillingham F.C. season", "response": ["Top goalscorer Crown left the club at the end of the season and joined Dagenham & Redbridge of the Conference.  Aylott, who had played only one game since Christmas, also moved on, as did midfielder Mark O'Connor.  In July, Roeder resigned as manager to take the equivalent role at Watford of the First Division, one of the clubs for which he had played.  Watford were later fined  by the Football Association, the governing body of the sport in England, for making an illegal approach to Roeder.  Mike Flanagan was promoted from reserves and youth coach to become Gillingham's new manager.  In the 1993\u201394 season, he led Gillingham to a 16th-place finish in the Third Division."]}]}}
