After continuing at Pinner Girls, a team formed by Smith's father, she developed her skills at Wembley Ladies and made her senior debut in the 1994\u201395 season.

The album is the third soundtrack/film score by British composer Stuart Hancock.", "Mark Douglas of The Journal described it as \"It is an unashamedly enjoyable hour and a half.\" He added: \"Perhaps the film might have been beefed up by a few talking heads slots, which would have given the main protagonists an opportunity to expand on their roles in this particular passion play.\" Edward Porter of The Sunday Times said, \"Like many an England performance, it's the work of a team making the best of limited resources. Not only are there no interviews, but the footage of the game \u2014 and of all the other matches covered in the build-up \u2014 is patchy.\" Peter Martin of Twitch Film thought \"Much time and care was spent on the recreations, but they have an odd flavor, with the majority of them consisting of unnecessary inserts that stick out from the archival material like a series of sore thumbs.\" He added: \"Gary Oldman, who narrates, speaks in flat, even tones... It's a refreshing, realistic approach, but it's undermined by the recreations. I wonder if all that time and effort wouldn't have been better served by integrating modern-day interviews providing historical perspective, such as the interview with author Pete Davies that's included as one of the extras.\""]}]}}
