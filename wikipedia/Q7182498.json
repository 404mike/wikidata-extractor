In May 1985 he was to witness a nightmare when 56 spectators were killed in a horrendous stand fire while playing Bradford City. A brief spell at Leicester City followed before he joined Notts County in 1989. He would become a stalwart of the Magpies side, winning back-to-back promotions in 1990 and 1991, and remained at the club until his professional retirement in 1996.

Three executive boxes were also purchased from Newcastle United, whilst facilities were opened to the local community. Manager John Rudge made a \u00a340,000 offer for Bristol City's left-sided midfielder Alan Walsh, which was rejected. He also made inquiries for Nigel Gleghorn and Marc North. Ray Walker put in a transfer request, which was rejected. Rudge's first purchase of the season was Sunderland's left-sided midfielder Paul Atkinson, with a tribunal setting the fee at \u00a320,000; Rudge stated that he \"has the ability to produce the sort of crosses that win games\". His next target was a striker, though he had a \u00a370,000 bid for Hull City's Andy Saville rejected. Attempts to capture Imre Varadi, Wayne Biggins, Keith Bertschin, Andy Jones, and John Pearson all failed. Ian Moores began training with the club, but was not offered a contract. Despite interest from at least three other clubs (particularly Mansfield Town), Rudge signed Ron Futcher, Bradford City's top-scorer, for a \u00a335,000 fee. The veteran striker said \"I could have done better for myself elsewhere, but Vale have a lot more potential.\" Another new arrival was young Brighton & Hove Albion goalkeeper Trevor Wood on a free transfer. The Vale were unbeaten in their seven pre-season friendlies, beating second tier rivals Stoke City 1\u20130 in the process. They also recorded wins over Newcastle Town (6\u20131), Brandon (2\u20131), Spennymoor (3\u20130), and Kidderminster Harriers (4\u20130), and drew 2\u20132 with Walsall and 1\u20131 with Crewe Alexandra. Having failed to sign Phil Turner, Rudge felt the squad's one weakness was a lack of depth in defence."]}]}}
