After the conclave had begun, the Emperor Frederick had had the two cardinals brought from Naples to Tivoli.Ryccardus de S. Germano, Chronica, in Monumenta Germaniae Historica Scriptorum Tomus 19 (Hannoverae 1866), p. 381. However, when summoned to the Emperor's presence, rather than agree to the Emperor's conditions, Cardinal Giacomo da Pecorara proceeded to excommunicate the Emperor yet once again.  It was clear that the Cardinal would never cooperate, and he therefore remained in detention for two more years.  Cardinal Oddone di Monferrato, however, was allowed to join the election, though he was required to leave hostages in his place and to promise to return to the Emperor's custody, unless he himself was elected pope or the deadlock continued. Frederick did not expect, of course, that the cardinals would elect Cardinal Oddo as pope; Frederick's own friends in the Conclave could and would prevent that.  Nor did he want Cardinal Oddo to be elected.  His real opinion of the Cardinal is revealed in a letter he wrote after the Battle of Giglio:  as a Legate in England and France Oddo had conspired a good deal against the honor of the Emperor; he had raised a crowd of prelates to bring them to Rome to participate in Gregory IX's Council; in Genoa he had conspired against those Genoese who were supporters of Frederick; he had raised and armed a fleet to transport the prelates to Rome, and to reduce the Genoese.Constantin H\u00f6ffler, Albert von Beham und Regesten Papst Innocenz IV. (Stuttgart 1847), pp. 55-57: ...et Oddo de Todenengo, sancti Nycolai in carcere Tulliano diaconus cardinalis, qui diu legati fuerant in partibus transalpinis et contra honorem nostrum multipliciter machinati, praelatorum turba, quam dinumerare nemo poterat, pro celebrando Romae contra nos concilio e diversis provinciis convenerat, Januam venientes, et conspiratione facta cum Januensibus rebellibus nostris et armata ibidem copia galearum, cum quibus duci Romam et Januam reduci convenerant... Cardinal Oddo was to be an instrument to break the deadlock in the meeting.Francis Aidan Gasquet incorrectly states that Pecorara was released as well, stating also that Oddone (who had excommunicated the emperor from England and raised funds with which Gregory IX had waged war on the emperor) returned to Frederick II's custody before the conclusion of the election. See Gasquet, 1905, p. 199. Henderson also claims that the two prisoners attended the election and thereafter returned to custody together. See Henderson, 1894, p. 395; Henderson is wrong. Frederick II himself urged the cardinals to make a quick choice."]}, {"page": "Louis Casartelli", "response": ["On 28 August 1903 Louis was appointed Bishop of Salford but wrote to Rome begging to decline.
