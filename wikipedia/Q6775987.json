The act released several records over the next decade, published by varying small labels in the United Kingdom, U.S. and Japan without impacting any commercial charts. A single entitled 'Wonderfool' (1995) was first released, followed by a long-player entitled Fat Lot of Good (1996) carrying a commercially counterintuitive cover art image. The album was supported by the release of an E.P. titled 'Silver Lining', and the singles 'Black Pain' (1996), and 'Nothing's Sacred' (1996). Another L.P. entitled God's Wallop was recorded in London in the mid-1990s (before Andrews and Westwood quit London and returned to the U.S.), with Rat Scabies playing the drum tracks, produced by Martin Lee Stephenson, but it wasn't commercially released until 2001. A third LP, entitled All the Love in the World (2004), self-produced by Andrews, was recorded by the act at Studio Dee in Los Angeles with a session drummer, and was commercially released in the U.S."]}]}}
