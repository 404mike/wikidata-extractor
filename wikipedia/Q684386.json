By matching personal names in Carian characters with their counterparts in Egyptian hieroglyphs, John D. Ray, Diether Sch\u00fcrr, and Ignacio J. Adiego were able to unambiguously derive the phonetic value of most Carian signs. It turned out that not a single Carian consonant sign has the same phonetic value as in the Greek alphabet. By 1993 the so-called \"Ray-Sch\u00fcrr-Adiego System\" was generally accepted, and its basic correctness was confirmed in 1996 when in Kaunos (Caria) a new Greek-Carian bilingual was discovered, where the Carian names nicely matched their Greek counterparts.Adiego (2007), The Carian Language (Handbuch der Orientalistik), pp. 166-204."]}, {"page": "Pyramid of Unas", "response": ["Late Period monuments, colloquially called the \"Persian tombs\", thought to date to the reign of Amasis II, were discovered near the causeway. These include tombs built for Tjannehebu, Overseer of the Royal Navy; Psamtik, the Chief Physician; and Peteniese, Overseer of Confidential Documents. The Egyptologist John D. Ray explains that the site was chosen because it was readily accessible from both Memphis and the Nile Valley. Traces of Phoenician and Aramaic burials have been reported in the area directly south of Unas's causeway."]}, {"page": "Hakor", "response": ["In 1986, John D. Ray suggested that Hakor was Nepherites' heir, who ruled undisturbed until his Year 2 when he was deposed by Psammuthes. After another year, Hakor managed to retake his legitimate throne by overthrowing the usurper, and continued to date his reign since his first coronation date, simply pretending that this gap never occurred. The third pretender, Muthis, could be inserted within this struggle, but his role \u2013 assuming that he really did exist \u2013 is unknown. Ray's hypothesis is accepted by other Egyptologists such as Alan B. Lloyd and Toby Wilkinson."]}, {"page": "Psammuthes", "response": ["According to a hypothesis of the Egyptologist John D. Ray, upon the death of Nepherites I in 393 BC, the throne passed to his son and successor, which is likely to had been Hakor. However, it seems that in his Year 2 a usurper, Psammuthes (a hellenized form of the Egyptian name PasherienmutPeter Clayton, Chronicle of the Pharaohs, Thames and Hudson Ltd. 1994 p.203), seized power and deposed Hakor, while proclaiming himself pharaoh."]}, {"page": "Carian alphabets", "response": ["The British Egyptologist John D. Ray apparently worked independently from Kowalski; nevertheless he produced similar results (1981, 1983). He used Carian\u2013Egyptian bilingual inscriptions that had been neglected until then.

He was highly antagonistic to Frederic H. Wood, who claimed that a long-dead Egyptian princess spoke, in ancient Egyptian, through \"Rosemary\".  This form of \"speaking in tongues\" is known as xenoglossy. Rosemary's utterances were recorded phonetically and an Egyptologist, Mr. Hulme, claimed that Rosemary's speech conformed to the ancient Egyptian tongue, and could be translated into English.  In the June 1937, issue of the Journal of Egyptian Archaeology, Gunn claimed that Hulme had manipulated the transcriptions to fit his own expectations of what he imagined ancient Egyptian to sound like. A later examination by John D. Ray (then the Sir Herbert Thompson Professor of Egyptology at the University of Cambridge) confirmed \"there could be no mistaking Hulme's incompetence\". Furthermore, both Gunn and Ray pointed out that Rosemary's visions of camels as domestic transport were inconsistent, as camels were not used for transport in 18th Dynasty Egypt.  Wood's book on the subject, Egyptian Miracle, makes repeated derogatory references to Gunn, including \"Also, the passing of our opponent Battiscombe Gunn, in 1950, can be recorded with the comment, De mortuis nil nisi bonum.\""]}, {"page": "John Ray (disambiguation)", "response": ["*John D.
