After the 1958 Aldermaston march, the DAC stayed in the Aldermaston area to try to stop work at the Atomic Weapons Establishment. They picketed, met with trades unions, held factory gate meetings and canvassed in the surrounding villages.  As a result, five workers resigned from their jobs, three job applicants withdrew and five drivers refused to deliver to the establishment.Allen Lovell, \"Where Next for the Campaign?\" Universities and Left Review, No.6, Spring 1959\"Pat Arrowsmith recalls organising against Britain's Bomb\", Socialist Worker, 22 March 2008 The DAC then moved to Norfolk to campaign against the Thor nuclear missiles at an RAF base at North Pickenham, using similar methods to those they had used at Aldermaston. One worker left the base and others said they would do so if they could find other jobs. They then moved to Stevenage, Hertfordshire, to campaign against the de Havilland and English Electric factories, which made guided missiles.", "As long as it lasted, the DAC was effectively the direct-action wing of CND, whose leadership were either uncertain about direct action or opposed to it.  There was an overlap between supporters of CND and supporters of the DAC.  The sponsors of the DAC included the president of CND (Bertrand Russell), three members of CND's executive committee and other CND leaders.  Pat Arrowsmith, a pacifist and consistent supporter of direct action, was appointed assistant secretary of CND after the first Aldermaston March.
