He is best known for his television role as Gus Hedges, the jargon-speaking manager, from Drop the Dead Donkey. He also appeared in Casualty as Peter Hayes between 1995 and 1996 and as  Lazarus in the 2000 film The Miracle Maker.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency", "response": ["The first series began on 3 October 2007 and features Harry Enfield as Dirk, Billy Boyd as Richard, Olivia Colman as Janice, Jim Carter as Gilks, Andrew Sachs as Reg, Felicity Montagu as Susan, Robert Duncan as Gordon, Toby Longworth as the Monk, Michael Fenton Stevens as Michael, Andrew Secombe, Jon Glover, Jeffrey Holland, Wayne Forester and Tamsin Heatley."]}, {"page": "Old Harry's Game", "response": ["Andy Hamilton (Satan), James Grout (The Professor), Robert Duncan (Scumspawn), David Swift (God) and Michael Fenton Stevens had all worked together previously, in the UK television comedy series Drop the Dead Donkey between 1990 and 1998, which had been co-written by Hamilton. Both of the latter were written into the 1998 series by Hamilton when the run of Donkey ended that year. The majority of the guest and recurring actors also had roles in Drop the Dead Donkey, including Jasper Jacob (series one), Philip Pope (recurring), Nick Revell (recurring), Nigel Pegram, Penelope Nice (Deborah Whittingham, before being replaced by Felicity Montagu) and Geoffrey Whitehead (Roland).", "Other characters featured are Satan's minions. Satan's personal assistant and most venomous demon, Gary (Steve O'Donnell), was featured in the first series because Thomas was on his list of tormentees. Thomas later manipulates Gary and convinces him to rebel against Satan, with a distinct lack of success. Gary is mentioned only once in later series and his absence is never explained (although the implication is that he fell from favour due to his rebellion). Scumspawn (Robert Duncan), featured from the second series onwards, takes Gary's place, having applied (repeatedly) to become Satan's new personal assistant. Although Satan initially refuses, he later relents, and Scumspawn proves a surprisingly effective assistant. His subplots usually involve attempts to become a better demon (with help from Thomas). Much of the humour surrounding Scumspawn derives from his sensitive, caring and highly artistic personality, which is a constant irritant to Satan, who often complains that Scumspawn does not act very much like a demon.", "In mid-2012 the BBC announced a two-part special with an Olympic theme, both parts of which were recorded on 8 July 2012: with Andy Hamilton, Annette Crosbie, Robert Duncan and Jimmy Mulville all returning in their established roles."]}, {"page": "Drop the Dead Donkey", "response": ["* Gus Hedges (Robert Duncan) \u2013 Series One to Six\u2014 The unctuous Chief Executive of the company, yes-man to Sir Roysten Merchant and an unwavering supporter of then Conservative Prime Minister John Major is a management stereotype, complete with clich\u00e9s. He transforms GlobeLink from a serious news network to a ratings-chasing tabloid channel. He is notable for management jargon, such as, \"Are we cooking with napalm? You bet!\" In light of what he refers to as his \"hands-off\" role, he frequently prefaces his interference in editorial matters with the opening, \"Now, as you all know, I\u2019m not here...\" He is disliked and distrusted by the staff, who treat him with contempt. Outside the office, Gus is lonely. He has no real friends, and his occasional attempts to make friends at work fail, largely because of his insistence on behaving like an \"executive management module\". George appears to be the closest thing Gus has to a friend, but while Gus heavily leans on George for emotional support he shows no interest in reciprocating and frequently over-rides George's opinions and concerns. Some of these personality traits stem from his childhood; his older brother was his parents\u2019 favourite and Gus has terrible feelings of inadequacy. He is sexually inexperienced and fears advances from women. He is afraid of illness, and thoughts of his own mortality terrify him. Despite his executive position, he fears that he has not really achieved anything and will be quickly forgotten. Gus is alleged to have been based on Channel 4's controller at the time, Michael Grade, although the original idea was first pitched to the BBC, with Channel Four only picking up the series after the BBC refused to broadcast it. In series six it becomes clear that Gus has absolutely no life beyond GlobeLink and working for Sir Roysten and cannot come to terms with the station's closure. The final scene of the last episode sees a host of furniture-removal men clearing the fire-damaged office with Gus sitting miserably on his chair with a gloomy expression on his face."]}, {"page": "Michael Praed", "response": ["* Sir Robert Chiltern in Oscar Wilde's An Ideal Husband with Kate O'Mara, Carol Royle, Robert Duncan, Fenella Fielding, and Tony Britton, tour of Britain (2008)"]}, {"page": "Robert Duncan", "response": ["* Robert Duncan (poet) (1919\u20131988), American poet", "* Robert Duncan (writer) (born 1952), American music critic", "* Robert Duncan (actor) (born 1952), British TV actor", "* Robert Duncan (composer), Canadian composer", "* Robert Duncan (politician) (1850\u20131925), Unionist Party (Scotland) MP for Govan", "* Robert Duncan (physicist), American physicist", "*Robert Duncan of Robert Duncan and Company, a shipyard in the Port of Glasgow on the Clyde in Scotland", "*Robert Duncan (footballer) (1891\u20131984), Australian rules footballer", "*Robert Duncan (pilot) (1920\u20132013), flying ace", "*Robert Duncan (rower) (born 1931), Australian rower", "*Robert Duncan (bishop) (born 1948), Archbishop of the Anglican Church in North America", "*Robert Duncan Bell (1878\u20131953), Acting Governor of Bombay during the British Raj", "*Robert Duncan Luce, American mathematician and social scientist", "*Robert Duncan MacPherson, American mathematician at the Institute for Advanced Study and Princeton University", "*Robert Duncan McNeill (born 1964), American director, producer, and actor", "*Robert Duncan Milne (1844\u20131899), late-19th century San Francisco science fiction writer", "*Robert Duncan Sherrington, Australian politician", "*Robert Duncan Wilmot (1809\u20131891), Canadian politician and a Father of Confederation", "*Robert Duncan Wilmot Jr. (1837\u20131920), Canadian farmer, businessman and politician", "*Robert Duncanson (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "GamesMaster", "response": ["*Episode 16 \u2013 Christmas Special with Frank Bruno, Mike Doyle, Lorraine Chase, John Altman, Robin Askwith, Wayne Morris, Robert Duncan, Graham Bickley and Ray Meagher \u2013 23 December 1993 "]}, {"page": "List of fictional monarchs of real nations", "response": ["** Deceased historian Edith Barrington (played by Annette Crosbie) is forced to write a biography of Satan as part of a deal to no longer be billeted with her ex-son-in-law Thomas Crimp, the most vile human ever to have lived.
