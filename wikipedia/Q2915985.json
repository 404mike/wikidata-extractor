MacEoin (born 26 January 1949) is a British academic, scholar, and writer with a focus on Persian, Arabic, and Islamic studies. He has authored several academic books and articles, as well as many pieces of journalism. Since 2014 he has published a number of essays on current events with a Middle Eastern focus at the Gatestone Institute, of which he is a Senior Fellow. He was a Senior Editor from 2009 to 2010 at Middle East Quarterly, a publication of the American think tank Middle East Forum, where he is also a Fellow.From 2006-2015 MacEoin wrote a blog entitled A Liberal Defence of Israel, \"designed to correct the false impression that Israel is an illiberal, fascist, or apartheid state.\" In 2007 he authored a report entitled The Hijacking of British Islam, which garnered considerable criticism labeling him as a neo-conservative and accusations of forgery.As a novelist, MacEoin writes under the pen names Daniel Easterman and Jonathan Aycliffe. MacEoin is a former Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed and wrote in 2009 that he considers himself a secular humanist.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Matrix", "response": ["* The Matrix, a 1994 novel by Denis MacEoin as Jonathan Aycliffe"]}, {"page": "B\u00e1bism", "response": ["By 1848 the increased fervour of the B\u00e1b\u00eds and the clerical opposition had led to a number of confrontations between the B\u00e1b\u00eds and their government and clerical establishment. After the death of Mohammad Shah Qajar, the shah of Iran, a series of armed struggles and uprisings broke out in the country, including at Tabarsi. These confrontations all resulted in B\u00e1b\u00ed massacres; Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed authors give an estimate of 20,000 B\u00e1b\u00eds killed from 1844 to present, with most of the deaths occurring during the first 20 years. Former Professor of Islamic Studies Denis MacEoin studied documented deaths, both for individuals and for round figures, from B\u00e1b\u00ed, Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed, European, and Iranian sources, and confirmed at most two to three thousand. He stated that he could not find evidence for any higher figures. Supporters of the B\u00e1b\u00eds paint their struggle as basically defensive in nature; Shi\u02bbi writers on the other hand point to this period as proof of the subversive nature of B\u00e1b\u00edsm. MacEoin has pointed out that the B\u00e1b\u00eds did arm themselves, upon the B\u00e1b's instructions, and originally intended an uprising, but that their eventual clashes with state forces were defensive, and not considered an offensive jihad. In mid-1850 a new prime-minister, Amir Kabir, was convinced that the B\u00e1b\u00ed movement was a threat and ordered the execution of the B\u00e1b which was followed by the killings of many B\u00e1b\u00eds.", "The Archives Department at the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed World Centre currently holds about 190 Tablets of the B\u00e1b. Excerpts from several principal works have been published in an English language compilation of the B\u00e1b's writings: Selections from the Writings of the B\u00e1b, other publications include Prayers from the Bab: The Remembrance of God. Denis MacEoin, in his Sources for Early B\u0101b\u012b Doctrine and History, gives a description of many works; much of the following summary is derived from that source. In addition to major works, the B\u00e1b revealed numerous letters to his wife and followers, many prayers for various purposes, numerous commentaries on verses or chapters of the Qur\u02bcan, and many khutbihs or sermons (most of which were never delivered). Many of these have been lost; others have survived in compilations.", "Denis MacEoin, a former member of the Baha'i faith and now a critic, considers B\u00e1b\u00ed law as a \"mishmash of rules and regulations that at times are little more than mere whimsy, revolving around some of the Bab's own obsessions about cleanliness, polite behaviour, and elegance. It is a shari'a, but not in any practical sense. Certainly, it does not seem to be going anywhere...Here and there we find indications that the Bab had been impressed by Europeans and that he wanted his followers to emulate them.\" He further states: \"One comes away from the Bayan with a strong sense that very little of this is to be taken seriously. It is a form of a game, never actually intended to be put into practice, much in the same way that whole sections of the Bab's later books don't, in fact, mean anything very much, but are elaborate exercises in interesting things you can do with Arabic roots. Or the way so many of the Bab's early writings, described as tafsirs on this or that sura of the Qur\u02bcan, are really not commentaries at all.\" He further criticizes the Babi laws stating \"The average Babi could hardly hope to afford the three diamonds, four yellow rubies, six emeralds, and six red rubies that he was expected to give to the Babi Messiah, let alone find time to observe all the rules and regulations laid down in the book. For all that, the Babi shari'a made an impact.\""]}, {"page": "Black Standard", "response": ["*On 21 July 1848, under orders from the B\u00e1b, the B\u00e1b\u00ed leader Mull\u00e1 Husayn raised the Black Standard in Mashhad (in Iran's Khorasan Province) and began a march westwards.  The mission was most likely proclamatory but possibly also to rescue another B\u00e1b\u00ed leader, Qudd\u00fas, who was under house arrest in S\u00e1r\u00ed. After being rebuffed at the town of Barfurush, the group took up making defensive fortifications at the Shrine of Shaykh Tabarsi.  It is reported the Black Standard flew above the B\u00e1b\u00ed fortress until the end of the Battle of Fort Tabarsi. According to Denis MacEoin, the Babis under Boshru'i were on their mission of spreading Babism, \"by preaching if possible, by force if necessary.\""]}, {"page": "Azali", "response": ["Former-Baha'i and scholar of the B\u00e1bi faith, Denis MacEoin says:"]}, {"page": "Manifestation of God (Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith)", "response": ["In his book The Messiah of Shiraz, Denis MacEoin noted a possible discrepancy between the contemporary Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed understanding of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h's station as a Manifestation of God and that found in Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h's own works.
