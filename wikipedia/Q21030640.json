Response to Hoult's performance in Equals was relatively better; Peter Travers called him and his co-star Kristen Stewart \"quietly devastating\", and Katie Walsh, writing for Los Angeles Times, said the duo were \"finely matched both in their androgynous beauty and in their performances of a repressed humanity\". Despite doubts about his contract with the franchise, Hoult returned for the 2016 film X-Men: Apocalypse.
