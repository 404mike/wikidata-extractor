One of the rarest of these is the early jam session featuring him and Stones guitarist Keith Richards covering Robert Johnson's \"Little Queen of Spades\". Several early tracks were compiled on the twin album release, Jimmy Page: Session Man. He also recorded with Richards on guitar and vocals in Olympic Sound Studios on 15 October 1974. Along with Ric Grech on bass and Bruce Rowland on drums, a track called \"Scarlet\" was cut. Page reflected later in an interview with Rolling Stones Cameron Crowe: \"I did what could possibly be the next Stones B side. It was Ric Grech, Keith and me doing a number called \"Scarlet.\" I can't remember the drummer. It sounded very similar in style and mood to those Blonde on Blonde tracks. It was great, really good. We stayed up all night and went down to Island Studios where Keith put some reggae guitars over one section. I just put some solos on it, but it was eight in the morning of the next day before I did that. He took the tapes to Switzerland and someone found out about them. Richards told people that it was a track from my album\".", "thumb|upright|Jimmy Page performing onstage in 1977", "In 1994, Page and Robert Plant reunited as Page and Plant for an initial performance as part of MTV's \"Unplugged\" series.
