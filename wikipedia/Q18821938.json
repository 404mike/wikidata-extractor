Medlicott worked at the Board of Trade for the first year of the Second World War before being selected by Sir Keith Hancock to be a member of the Cabinet Office Historical Section. Medlicott published the results of his research in his two-volume work The Economic Blockade.From 1945 to 1953 he was Professor of History at the University College of the South-West and in 1953 he was elected to the Stevenson Chair of International History at the University of London. Medlicott succeeded in transforming it into the largest and most successful department of its type in Britain. In his works he sought to interpret twentieth-century international relations in relation to strategic and economic factors.In 1968 he was appointed to deliver the Creighton Lecture, published a year later as Britain and Germany: The Search for an Agreement. He was also secretary and president of the Historical Association for six years and was prominent in the Royal Institute of International Affairs.\nAfter a proposal from Donald Read, the Medlicott Medal was established in 1985 to recognise services to history.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Diplomatic history", "response": ["For the first half of the 20th century, most diplomatic history working within the narrow confines of the Primat der Aussenpolitik approach was very narrowly concerned with foreign-policy making elites with little reference to broader historical forces. The most notable exceptions to this tendency were A. J. P. Taylor and William Medlicott in Britain, Pierre Renouvin in France, and William L. Langer in the United States, who examined economic and domestic political forces."]}, {"page": "History of the Second World War", "response": ["*** Volume I, William Medlicott, 1952", "*** Volume II, William Medlicott, 1957"]}]}}
