She was sponsored by Virgin Trains West Coast and had a Class 390 Pendolino train named after her in September 2011.She competed for the Sale Harriers, the same club as former Great Britain athletes Diane Modahl and Darren Campbell.Irozuru began participating in athletics as a 14-year-old after she excelled at a youth athletics match by winning the 100 m, 200 m, 4 \u00d7 100 m and the long jump. This led to an invitation by Ian Wiltshire to start training at the City of Manchester Stadium before its conversion to a full football stadium. Her talent quickly shone through and in 2006 Irozuru won Silver at both the English Schools Championships and British Schools Championships competing against highly accomplished young jumpers.After establishing herself as an elite junior athlete, Irozuru moved to London to study for a law degree at University College London where she firstly worked with UK Athletics head long and triple jumps coach John Herbert who also coached Jade Johnson to the 2008 Summer Olympics. Her current coach is Larry Achike who helped her achieve 2012 National Indoor Long Jump Silver and Gold in her first senior international in Bratislava. On Saturday 9 June 2012 at the Georgi Pavlov International Athletics Meeting in Sofia, Bulgaria Irozuru jumped 6.80m in the sixth round, setting a new personal best and meeting the Olympic A Qualifying distance for the 2012 Summer Olympics. On the 24 June 2012 at the Aviva Olympic Trials & UK Championships in Birmingham she was disappointed to jump 6.48 which meant she had to compete at the 2012 European Athletics Championships in Helsinki, Finland.\nAfter retiring in 2016, she made a comeback in 2019, improving her personal best to 6.86 m, and reaching the final (placing seventh) at the World Championships in Doha.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Abigail Irozoru", "response": ["#redirect Abigail Irozuru"]}, {"page": "2012 European Athletics Championships \u2013 Women's long jump", "response": ["| 21 || B || align=\"left\" |  Abigail Irozuru ||align=left|  ||  || 4.22 || 6.19 || 6.19 ||"]}, {"page": "Athletics at the 2008 Commonwealth Youth Games", "response": ["| Abigail Irozuru ||5.92"]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 2012 European Athletics Championships", "response": ["|Abigail Irozuru"]}, {"page": "2008 World Junior Championships in Athletics \u2013 Women's long jump", "response": ["| 8 || align=left | Abigail Irozuru || align=left |  || 5.95(w: -0.1\u00a0m/s) || 6.16(w: -1.7\u00a0m/s) || x || 3.63(w: -2.0\u00a0m/s) || x || 5.97(w: -0.8\u00a0m/s) || 6.16 (w: -1.7\u00a0m/s)  || ", "| 8 || align=left | Abigail Irozuru || align=left |  || x || 6.04(w: -0.8\u00a0m/s) || 5.91(w: -1.7\u00a0m/s) || 6.04 (w: -0.8\u00a0m/s)  || q"]}, {"page": "2015 British Indoor Athletics Championships", "response": ["|Abigail Irozuru ||6.73 m"]}, {"page": "Athletics at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Qualification", "response": ["| Abigail IrozuruJazmin SawyersLorraine Ugen"]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 2020 Summer Olympics", "response": ["|align=left|Abigail Irozuru"]}, {"page": "2019 European Athletics Indoor Championships \u2013 Women's long jump", "response": ["| 8 || align=left|Abigail Irozuru || align=left| || 6.45 || 6.32 || 6.50 || 6.50 || q", "| 7 || align=left|Abigail Irozuru || align=left| || 6.41 || x || 6.50 || x || 6.37 || 6.35 ||  6.50 ||"]}, {"page": "Athletics at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's long jump", "response": ["| 8 || A || align=left|Abigail Irozuru || align=left| || 6.39 || 6.65 || 6.75 || 6.75 || , ", "| 11 || align=left|Abigail Irozuru || align=left| ||data-sort-value=1.00| X || 6.51 || 6.27 || || || || 6.51 ||"]}, {"page": "2019 in the sport of athletics", "response": ["** Women's Long Jump winner:  Abigail Irozuru"]}, {"page": "2019 British Indoor Athletics Championships", "response": ["|Abigail Irozuru || 6.35 m"]}, {"page": "2019 European Athletics Team Championships", "response": ["| Abigail Irozuru || 6.75 SB "]}, {"page": "2019 European Athletics Team Championships Super League", "response": ["| 2 || align=left|Abigail Irozuru || align=left| || 6.75w || 6.61 || x || 6.70 || 6.75w || SB || 11"]}, {"page": "Great Britain and Northern Ireland at the 2019 World Athletics Championships", "response": ["|style=text-align:left| Abigail Irozuru"]}, {"page": "2019 World Athletics Championships \u2013 Women's long jump", "response": ["On the first jump of the competition, Brume jumped 6.83m, then third up Maryna Bekh-Romanchuk came close to Brume with a 6.81m.
