Mila was a human prisoner of the Daleks, who experimented on her using bio-engineered viruses. As a result of these endeavours, she lost most of her memories and eventually became invisible and non-corporeal, as well as gaining other strange abilities. She escaped from the Daleks and sneaked on board the First Doctor's TARDIS, possibly during the events of The Chase. She remained in the TARDIS, unseen by anyone for centuries. She silently watched the Doctor, growing obsessed by his heroics and longing to be a real companion. During the Sixth Doctor's life, she met Charley Pollard, the only companion unprotected by the TARDIS' biological defences. Mila managed to transfer her afflictions to Charley, while simultaneously adopting Charley's physical form. She was then able to travel with the Doctor, pretending to be Charley, while the real Charley was left invisible and alone. Eventually Charley was cured by the Viyrans and Mila gave her life to save the Doctor. The Viyrans also altered the Sixth Doctor's memories so that he remembers his adventures with Charley as being with Mila's name and face, thus avoiding the potential temporal paradox of the Sixth Doctor meeting an older Charley before his eighth incarnation would save the younger one."]}, {"page": "List of British Jewish entertainers", "response": ["*Jess Robinson (born 1993), impressionist, comedian, singer and podcaster"]}, {"page": "Cyberman (audio drama series)", "response": ["* Janice Webb \u2013 Jess Robinson"]}, {"page": "Julian Dutton", "response": ["His children's sitcom Scoop for CBBC, which Dutton wrote and performed in, ran for 3 series of 39 episodes between 2009 & 2011, and the hit impressions show \"The Secret World,\" written with Bill Dare, in which Dutton performs alongside star impressionists Jon Culshaw, Lewis Macleod, Duncan Wisbey and Jess Robinson, ran for four series.
