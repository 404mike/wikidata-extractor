After 1991 he still contributed regularly to Motor Sport magazine, continuing a career that lasted eighty-one years. He also co-founded the Vintage Sports Car Club, and founded the Brooklands Society in 1967 among numerous contributions to the emerging vintage car scene. At his death he was considered the longest-serving journalist in the UK, having submitted his first article in 1930 and his last one just a week before his death.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Brooklands", "response": ["*Bill Boddy (motoring journalist)"]}, {"page": "Sleeper (car)", "response": ["In the February 1963  Motor Sport magazine editor Bill Boddy said \"the modifications carried out by Lotus have turned the Lotus Cortina into a 'Q' car par excellence\".

Noting the car had a reserve fuel tank, he declined to fill up before the journey.  Upon running out of petrol, he could not find the switch to activate the reserve.  After begging petrol from a passing lorry Boddy then encountered a motorcyclist who had crashed, and offered to help.  When asked, he told Boddy that his bike was a Brough Superior and asked what was, \"...the nice car in which you are giving me a lift.\"  When told it was a Brough Superior the motorcyclist was silent for the rest of the journey.  Boddy presumed this was incredulity that a famed motorcycle maker could also manufacture cars, and supposed that the motorcyclist presumed he was concussed."]}, {"page": "Chitty Bang Bang", "response": ["For its next outing, Chitty 1 was refitted, as a two-seater with a cowled radiator and a properly plumbed exhaust.
