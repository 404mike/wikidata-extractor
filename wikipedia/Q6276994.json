Despite losing their decisive final game of the season 1\u20130 to York City on 20 April, the Daggers secured their place in the Football League and avoided relegation to the Conference for a further season. Lewington was dropped for the game in favour of young goalkeeper Jordan Seabright. Lewington added a further 45 appearances to his tally across to 2012\u201313 season.", "In September 2013, Lewington hailed the impact that new goalkeeping coach Jim Stannard had made on his game. Stannard's arrival from Premier League side Southampton was welcomed after the Daggers went without a recognised goalkeeping coach for much of the 2012\u201313 season. A back injury in October kept Lewington out of first-team action during the middle of the month, allowing Jordan Seabright to step in.", "After keeping a clean sheet in the Daggers 1\u20130 win against high-flying Rochdale on 1 February 2014, Lewington was insistent that his side could haul themselves back into the hunt for the play-off positions. Lewington then played his final game for the club on 18 April as Dagenham grabbed their first-ever win at Torquay United, with the decisive goal coming from Medy Elito as Lewington earned himself another clean sheet. Jordan Seabright was given his chance to impress for the final few games of the season while both goalkeepers' contracts were due to expire at the end of the season. He made 45 appearances throughout the season for Dagenham."]}, {"page": "2012\u201313 Dagenham & Redbridge F.C. season", "response": ["!scope=\"row\"|Jordan Seabright"]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 Dagenham & Redbridge F.C. season", "response": ["!scope=\"row\"|Jordan Seabright"]}, {"page": "2014\u201315 in English football", "response": ["* 2 March 2015: Jordan Seabright, 20, former AFC Bournemouth and Dagenham & Redbridge goalkeeper.Jordan Seabright: Torquay keeper quits to become car salesman BBC Sport.
