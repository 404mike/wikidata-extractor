This success encouraged the Royal Thames Yacht Club in believing that the cup could be brought back home, and officially placed the first challenge in 1870. Ashbury entered Cambria in the NYYC Queen's Cup race in New York City on 8 August against a fleet of seventeen schooners, with time allowed based on their tonnage.

The difference alarmed the N.Y.Y.C., but they rectified the situation by handicapping the challenger. Although the N.Y.Y.C. successfully defended the Cup that year, the problem spurred them to rewrite the Deed. Once again the club officially returned the Cup to Schuyler. The third Deed is much longer and couched in legal terminology. The third Deed tightened the rules for challenging; for example, it stated explicitly that the challenger must not exceed the dimensions provided to the holder of the Cup. The new version of the rules created an uproar among many British yachtsmen, who claimed that the new rules made it impossible to challenge. No one challenged until six years later, when British railroad tycoon James Lloyd Ashbury set forth his first of two challenges."]}, {"page": "America's Cup Hall of Fame", "response": ["*James Lloyd Ashbury"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1874 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| James Lloyd Ashbury"]}, {"page": "Charles Cameron Shute", "response": ["In 1874 Shute was elected as one of Brighton's two members of parliament.
