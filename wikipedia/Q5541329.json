So I quickly told him I had plenty of ideas, and for my trouble I received a regular supply of work for the next six years.\" Anglo replaced the Captain Marvel family with almost identical characters, Marvelman, Young Marvelman, and Kid Marvelman.

Douglas Wolk observed: \"Moore has undisputably made it into the Hall of Fame: he's one of the pillars of English language comics, alongside Jack Kirby and Will Eisner and Harvey Kurtzman and not many others. He's also the grand exception in that hall, since the other pillars are artists \u2013 and more often than not, writer/artists. Moore is a writer almost exclusively, though his hyper detailed scripts always play to the strengths of the artists he works with. That makes him the chief monkey wrench in comics author theory. The main reason that almost nobody's willing to say that a single cartoonist is categorically superior to a writer/artist team is that such a rule would run smack into Moore's bibliography. In fact, a handful of cartoonists who almost always write the stories they draw have made exceptions for Moore \u2013 Jaime Hernandez, Mark Beyer and most memorably Eddie Campbell.\""]}, {"page": "George Khoury (writer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Khoury (author)"]}, {"page": "List of Saint Peter's University people", "response": ["* George Khoury, notable writer and interviewer in the field of comic books"]}, {"page": "Template talk:COI/Archive 1", "response": ["This template has been added to at least 3 articles I have edited, George Khoury (author), Loren Coleman and Comics Bulletin, but I am struggling to find a way to address this. In the first case the subject has edited the article but there are no WP:NPOV issues I can see - if there are no problems to fix it is going to be tricky demon starting that you have addressed concerns. The others need some work but as part of an ongoing process (and in most things causing concern weren't added by those users).", "So I'd like to see better documentation on this to stop its indiscriminate use - this is a large and serious template to use on an article (see the TfD discussion) and I think other avenues should be explored first (using NPOV tags and noting this with the notable Wikipedians tag on the talk page). If there are serious problems with a large part of the article that will require a while to fix then I can see this as being a legitimate use (similar to the under construction tag, as it shows work is ongoing and until then people should be cautious about the tone of the article) but it needs some kind of follow-up on the talk page.

I have seen numerous cases of people editing their own articles and I've checked their edits, flagged it on the talk page and dropped them a note on their talk page pointing them to WP:COI. 99% of such incidents like that can be fixed in this way. People have dropped Loren Coleman a note on COI User talk:Cryptozoo (which led him to following the guidelines and dropping references into the talk page - everyone wins) but no one has done anything similar for User talk:George Khoury.", ":The three articles you mention seem to have some neutrality problems: George Khoury (author), Loren Coleman and Comics Bulletin.

Outside views of an article subject are more helpful than a mere collection of their publications or interviews with them. Comics Bulletin seems to have a promotional tone, but that might be cured by shortening the article. If you agree that there is something here needing to be fixed, would you have some time to make these improvements?
