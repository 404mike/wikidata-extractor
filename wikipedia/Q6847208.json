Swan also set up the first of Batty's four Leeds goals in a boxing day clash with Manchester City at Maine Road. Though he was never consistently in the first eleven under Bremner, when new manager Howard Wilkinson was appointed in 1988\u201389 Swan fell out of the first team picture completely. He did not take to Wilkinson, and ended his first team chances at Leeds when he told Wilkinson's assistant, Mike Hennigan, that \"I don't want to play for you... I just don't like him [Wilkinson].\" Swan handed in seven written transfer requests in the first three months, though was given two games before his request was granted."]}]}}
