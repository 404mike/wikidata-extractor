He joined Port Vale on loan for the first half of the 2017\u201318 season and started the 2019\u201320 season on loan at Scottish club Livingston. After being released by Wednesday he signed with Grantham Town in October 2020, before returning to the English Football League with Oldham Athletic in August 2021.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Michael Brown (footballer, born 1977)", "response": ["Despite being relegated, Brown was confirmed as the club's permanent manager in May 2017. He released 13 players at the end of the 2016\u201317 season. His first summer signing was former two-time Player of the Year Tom Pope on a free transfer after he managed to secure his release from Bury. He went on to sign ten more players during the window: goalkeepers Rob Lainton and Sam Hornby, defenders Joe Davis, Antony Kay, Gavin Gunning, Lawrie Wilson and Graham Kelly, midfielders Michael Tonge, Cristian Monta\u00f1o, David Worrall and Harry Middleton, and striker Tyrone Barnett; he also signed youngsters Rekeil Pyke, Marcus Harness, Tyler Denton, Ben Whitfield, Jack Stobbs and Tom Anderson on loan. However Vale suffered their worst start to a season in 50 years at the beginning of the 2017\u201318 season, going a club record six games without scoring a goal as they sat bottom of the table in September following six consecutive league defeats. He was sacked on 16 September following a 1\u20131 home draw with second-from-bottom Forest Green Rovers. Speaking after his sacking, Brown said that it had been difficult for him to recruit quality players on \"a very tight budget... I think it was arguably \u00a31m under from when they had got promoted from that league the time previously\". Supporter website OneValeFan described this as \"a somewhat unlikely claim\" as the club had only exited administration in November 2012."]}, {"page": "Sheffield Wednesday F.C.

Two days later Brown signed 21-year old left-back Tyler Denton on a season-long loan from Leeds United. Adebayo Akinfenwa put Wycombe Wanderers ahead within two minutes of the opening home game of the season at Vale Park on 12 August, and by the 25-minute mark he had scored the opposition's final goal of a 3\u20132 defeat for the \"Valiants\". In the week following the defeat to Wycombe, both Anton Forrester and Danny Pugh were ruled out of action for three to four months, and Brown signed 20-year old Sheffield Wednesday winger Jack Stobbs on a season-long loan. The match at Chesterfield was declared \"Ernie Moss Day\" in tribute to the legend of both clubs, but another poor performance saw Vale slip to a 2\u20130 defeat to a side that had previously failed to pick up a point. Fans booed the team and turned on the manager, chanting 'You don't know what you're doing'. In the week building up to the local derby with Crewe Alexandra, Brown signed highly rated midfielder David Worrall. Worrall made his debut against Crewe, but it was midfield partner Michael Tonge who made the headlines for the wrong reasons, as he was sent off four minutes after Crewe's Chris Dagnall scored the only goal of the game on the half-hour mark; Brown said that Tonge was unlucky to be sent off and he was proud of his team's performance. On the final day before the summer transfer window closed, Brown signed Burnley centre-back Tom Anderson on a season-long loan and Doncaster Rovers central midfielder Harry Middleton on a free transfer.", "Vale opened the New Year with a 1\u20130 defeat at second-placed Notts County, and though Aspin was pleased with his players he was highly critical of the referee for his award of a late penalty, calling it \"a really bad decision\". Earlier in the day he made his second signing as manager, bringing in striker Dior Angus from non-league Redditch United. Meanwhile, Gavin Gunning left the club on the expiry of his contract, whilst Jack Stobbs, Rekeil Pyke and Tyler Denton returned to their parent clubs. In contrast, Whitfield's loan was extended until the end of the season. Gunning made his debut for Forest Green on 6 January, and kept a clean sheet as Rovers beat the Vale 1\u20130 with a goal from fellow d\u00e9butante Reuben Reid; Aspin apologized to supporters after the match for the team's performance. Aspin went on to allow Lawrie Wilson to join National League side Ebbsfleet United after the full-back failed to make the first-team under his tenure. He also agreed to terminate the contract of French midfielder Anthony de Freitas, whilst bringing in striker Donovan Wilson on loan from Wolverhampton Wanderers. Vale put in a poor performance at home to Yeovil, though did claim a 1\u20131 draw after Pope converted a late penalty. Aspin went on to sign midfielder Luke Hannant from Gateshead for an undisclosed fee, having previously signed the 24-year old from Team Northumbria in 2016. He also boosted the defensive numbers by bringing in centre-back Zak Jules on loan from Shrewsbury Town. Hannant made his debut at Accrington Stanley on 20 January, a game in which Vale led 2\u20130 at half-time only to lose 3\u20132; Aspin went on to criticise both the referee for failing to spot a handball for Accrington's equaliser and also his team for poor defending. Jules made his debut and Lainton returned to the starting eleven for the visit of Colchester on 27 January, and Vale managed to secure a 2\u20132 draw despite a poor performance thanks to a brace from Worrall. A surprise departure was then announced, as Anderson was recalled early from his loan spell by Burnley. Aspin responded quickly by signing former youth-team centre-back Charlie Raglan on loan from Oxford United, 21-year old defender Kyle Howkins on loan from West Bromwich Albion and 23-year old defender Callum Howe for an undisclosed fee from Lincoln City.", "|align=\"left\"|MF||34||align=\"left\"| Jack Stobbs", "| 17 August 2017 || RW ||  || Jack Stobbs || Sheffield Wednesday || 2 January 2018 || "]}, {"page": "2017\u201318 Sheffield Wednesday F.C. season", "response": ["| 16 February 2018 || MF ||  || Jack Stobbs || 2 1\u20442 years || June 2020 || "]}, {"page": "2019\u201320 Sheffield Wednesday F.C. season", "response": ["|20 August 2019 || RW ||  || Jack Stobbs ||  Livingston || 14 January 2020 || "]}, {"page": "2019\u201320 Livingston F.C. season", "response": ["| Jack Stobbs"]}, {"page": "2020\u201321 Sheffield Wednesday F.C. season", "response": ["| 1 July 2020 || RM ||  || Jack Stobbs ||  Grantham Town || Released || "]}]}}
