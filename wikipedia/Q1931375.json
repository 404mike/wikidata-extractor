With the club knocked out of the League Cup and struggling in the league, it was left to the FA Cup to keep the season alive. Having beaten Telford United and Winsford United they were drawn to play the previous season's First Division champions and Arsenal.

When he purchased the club they were in serious financial trouble, as well as being tarnished by a notorious hooligan element among their support. They were also struggling in the Football League Second Division, a stark contrast to their successful era from 1955 to 1971, when they had won a Football League First Division title, an FA Cup, Football League Cup and European Cup Winners' Cup. After narrowly escaping relegation to the Third Division in the 1982\u201383 season, Bates made the funds available to manager John Neal to sign players including Kerry Dixon, David Speedie, Pat Nevin, Mickey Thomas, Eddie Niedzwiecki and Nigel Spackman, who helped the club win promotion and re-establish themselves in the top-flight with consecutive top six finishes."]}, {"page": "Sammy McIlroy", "response": ["Stoke City paid Manchester United a club record fee of \u00a3350,000 for McIlroy on 2 February 1982. He arrived at Stoke with the club in deep relegation trouble in 1981\u201382 and he played in 18 matches as Stoke avoided the drop by two points. In 1982\u201383 Stoke had a solid midfield with McIlroy playing alongside former Manchester United team-mate Mickey Thomas, Mark Chamberlain and Paul Bracewell and the side finished in a mid-table position of 13th in 1982\u201383. However the 1983\u201384 season saw Stoke struggle again and McIlroy and the returning Alan Hudson helped Stoke stage a revival which saw they stay up by two points. In 1984\u201385 Stoke suffered an embarrassing relegation going down with a then record low points tally of 17 with McIlroy winning the player of the year award. He was handed a free transfer in the summer of 1985 and McIlroy went on to play at Manchester City in the 1985\u201386 season, Swedish club \u00d6rgryte IS in 1986, Bury from 1986 to 1989 and Preston North End from 1989 to 1991.

He then moved to Stoke City and Darlington, and retired after seeing his final club relegated to the Football Conference in 1989."]}, {"page": "Wichita Wings", "response": ["Big changes came to the front office and coaching staff in 1986. Francis Dale stepped down as commissioner of the MISL and the Wings' own Bill Kentling took his place. When Kentling went to the new league headquarters in New York City, it was decided that Roy Turner was the logical choice to replace him. Turner stepped down as head coach and was named President of the Wings. The changes continued when Frank Carney decided to step down as managing general partner. William \"Bill\" Oliver Jr. took his place at the top of the Wings' power structure. Replacing Turner as coach was an important and difficult task. The team convinced Scottish legend Charlie Cooke, the \"Bonnie Prince,\" to fill Turner's shoes. Cooke instituted an up-tempo style that emphasized defensive pressure. It wasn't always popular with the older veterans. In 1986-87, the Wings added the young forward Mark Kerlin from Arizona and the Welsh superstar Mickey Thomas of Chelsea and Manchester United fame. A rookie from California named Dale Ervine would have the biggest long-term impact. At the end of his eight years in Wichita, \"The Bruin\" would be second on the all-time goals scored list. The Wings would lose in the division semifinals to Tacoma in 1987 after finishing the season with a 27-25 record."]}, {"page": "XFM Manchester", "response": ["In August 2007, XFM Manchester acquired the rights from 105.4 Century FM to broadcast commentary from all Manchester United games, as an adjunct to the station's usual music programming, with commentary provided by presenters including Mickey Thomas.
