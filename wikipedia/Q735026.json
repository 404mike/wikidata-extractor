He described numerous species of birds and mammals from the Himalayas, and several birds were named after him by others such as Edward Blyth. He was a scholar of Newar Buddhism and wrote extensively on a range of topics relating to linguistics and religion. He was an opponent of the British proposal to introduce English as the official medium of instruction in Indian schools.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dhole", "response": ["Canis primaevus was a name proposed by Brian Houghton Hodgson in 1833 who thought that the dhole was a primitive Canis form and the progenitor of the domestic dog.

Before its significance was realised, Mount Everest was originally known as Peak \"B\" and later as Peak XV. In March 1856, Waugh wrote to the Royal Geographical Society to announce that the mountain was believed to be the highest in the world, and proposed that it be named \"after my illustrious predecessor\", as it was \"without any local name that we can discover\" \u2013 the \"native appellation, if it has any, will not very likely be ascertained before we are allowed to penetrate into Nepal\". There were in fact several native names among the Nepalese and Tibetans, but those areas were closed off to the British at the time and people living further to the south of the Himalayas did not have a specific name for the peak. In the decade after 1856, Waugh's proposal was widely debated by the Royal Geographical Society and similar bodies. Other scholars of India put forward native names that they believed to be correct, such as Brian Houghton Hodgson's \"Deva-dhunga\" and Hermann Schlagintweit's \"Gaurisankar\". Everest himself objected to his name being used, as \"the native of India\" could not pronounce it and it could not be easily written in Hindi.

A less widely recognized common English name is the feather-toed eagle.Ripley, S. D. (1982). Synopsis of the Birds of India and Pakistan. Like all eagles, it is in the family Accipitridae. Its feathered tarsus marks this species as a member of the subfamily Aquilinae. It is a confirmed breeding species in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent, from India, Nepal (hence the epithet nipalensis) through Bangladesh to Thailand, Taiwan, Vietnam and Japan, although its distribution could be wider still as breeding species.Ferguson-Lees, J., & Christie, D.

Princeton University Press, Princeton, N.J.  Like other Asian hawk-eagles, this species was earlier treated under the genera of Spizaetus but genetic studies have shown this group to be paraphyletic, resulting in the Old World members being placed in Nisaetus (Hodgson, 1836) and separated from the New World species.Helbig, A.J, Kocum, A., Seibold, I. & Braun, M.J.

Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his Systema Naturae for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the green imperial pigeon which he placed with all the other pigeons in the genus Columba. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name Columba aenea and cited Brisson's work. Brisson believed his specimen had come from the Maluku Islands but the species does not occur there and in 1918 the type locality was designated as the island of Flores in Indonesia.

Aquila is Latin for \"eagle\" while nipalensis means \"from Nepal\" based on the location where the type specimen was collected presumably while migrating. The steppe eagle is a member of the booted eagle subfamily within the Accipitridae family. The booted eagle clan are monophyletic and study of karyotypes has indicated that they likely have few to no close external relations within the overall extant accipitrid family.Li, Q., Lin, J., Li, S., Wang, Y., Li, W., & Zeng, Y.

The booted eagle subfamily all have feathers covering their legs and may be found to some extent on every continent that contains accipitrids. The genus Aquila is has been thought to traditionally composed of by large and fairly dark eagles that generally habituate to various open habitats. However, a significant division was determined to exist between superficially similar eagles such as the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) and its three extant and similar-looking close cousins, as well as three very different smaller and pale-bellied eagles (the Bonelli's, African hawk- and Cassin's hawk-eagles) and the species complex which contains the steppe eagle.Lerner, H.
