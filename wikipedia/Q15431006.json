She published, in seven volumes between 1948 and 1985, The History of the British Film; this examines, in exacting detail, film production in Britain from its origins in 1896 until 1939. She was awarded a Research Fellowship by Lucy Cavendish College, Cambridge, to facilitate her work on the later volumes of the series.Film critic Matthew Sweet has criticised Low's \"tyrannous influence\" on the writings of subsequent film historians.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Jazz Singer", "response": ["As the truly pivotal event, Crafton points to the national release of the film's sound version in early 1928\u2014he dates it to January, Block and Wilson to February 4. In March, Warners announced that The Jazz Singer was playing at a record 235 theaters (though many could still show it only silently). In May, a consortium including the leading Hollywood studios signed up with Western Electric's licensing division, ERPI, for sound conversion. In July, Warner Bros. released the first all-talking feature, Lights of New York, a musical crime melodrama. On September 27, The Jazz Singer became the first feature-length talking picture to be shown in Europe when it premiered at London's Piccadilly Theatre. The movie \"created a sensation\", according to British film historian Rachael Low. \"The Jazz Singer was a turning point [for the introduction of sound]. The Bioscope greeted it with, 'We are inclined to wonder why we ever called them Living Pictures.'\"Low (1997), p. 203. It premiered the same month in Berlin, but as a silent.

In Paris, The Jazz Singer had its sound premiere in January 1929 (Crisp [1997], p. 101). According to film historian Rachael Low, \"Many in the industry realized at once that a change to sound production was inevitable.\"Low (1997a), p. 191. On January 16, 1929, the first European feature film with a synchronized vocal performance and recorded score premiered: the German production Ich k\u00fcsse Ihre Hand, Madame (I Kiss Your Hand, Madame). Dialogueless, it contains only a few songs performed by Richard Tauber. The movie was made with the sound-on-film system controlled by the German-Dutch firm Tobis, corporate heirs to the Tri-Ergon concern. With an eye toward commanding the emerging European market for sound film, Tobis entered into a compact with its chief competitor, Klangfilm, a joint subsidiary of Germany's two leading electrical manufacturers. Early in 1929, Tobis and Klangfilm began comarketing their recording and playback technologies. As ERPI began to wire theaters around Europe, Tobis-Klangfilm claimed that the Western Electric system infringed on the Tri-Ergon patents, stalling the introduction of American technology in many places.Gomery (1980), pp. 28\u201330. Just as RCA had entered the movie business to maximize its recording system's value, Tobis also established its own production operations.See, e.g., Crisp (1997), pp. 103\u20134."]}, {"page": "Action for Slander", "response": ["The film was popular at its release and it was re-released several times during the 1940s.
