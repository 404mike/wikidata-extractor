There had been no resident clergyman for 150 years. He even took on temporarily the Rectory of nearby Londesborough (1823\u20131829) as \"warming-pan\" for his neighbour, William George Howard, 8th Earl of Carlisle, then a third son who was training for the Church, with the Rectory of Londesborough in mind.Sydney Smith by George W. E. Russell He had a farm of 300 acres (1.2\u00a0km2) to keep in order; a dilapidated rectory had to be rebuilt. All these things were attended to beside his contributions to the Edinburgh Review. \"If the chances of life ever enable me to emerge,\" he wrote to Lady Holland, \"I will show you I have not been wholly occupied by small and sordid pursuits\". He continued to speak in favour of Catholic emancipation, his eloquence being specially directed against those who maintained that a Roman Catholic could not be believed on his oath. \"I defy Dr Duignan\", he pleaded, addressing a meeting of clergy in 1823, \"in the full vigour of his incapacity, in the strongest access of that Protestant epilepsy with which he was so often convulsed, to have added a single security to the security of that oath\". One of his most vigorous and effective polemics was A Letter to the Electors upon the Catholic Question (1826).", "Smith's reputation among his contemporaries as a humourist and wit grew to such an extent that a number of the observations which are now attributed to him may be of doubtful provenance. Lord Houghton recorded that he never, except once, knew Smith to make a jest of any religious subject, \"and then he immediately withdrew his words, and seemed ashamed that he had uttered them\".George W. E. Russell, Collections & Recollections (revised edition, Smith Elder & Co, London, 1899), p. 179. To be set against that encomium is one of Smith's best-known lines, to the effect that his friend Henry Luttrell's idea of heaven was eating p\u00e2t\u00e9 de foie gras to the sound of trumpets.Hesketh Pearson, The Smith of Smiths (Hamish Hamilton, 1934), chapter 10."]}, {"page": "William Hepworth Thompson", "response": ["The quote \"We are none of us infallible, not even the youngest of us\" is attributed to Thompson and is recorded in Collections and Recollections by George W.

Thompson uttered these words while Master of Trinity at a College Meeting of the Fellowship on 30 March 1878. As noted above, this was a time of great reformation within the College, willingly supported by Thompson. Gerald Balfour, then a junior Fellow of the College, later politician and Chief Secretary for Ireland, proposed a revision of the College Statutes. The quote was, as Trevelyan puts it, \"directed in a kindly spirit at the reforming zeal of a group of junior Fellows\".
