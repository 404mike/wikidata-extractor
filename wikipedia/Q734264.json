Between 1993 and his semi retirement in December 2009, his BBC Radio 2 weekday breakfast programme Wake Up to Wogan regularly drew an estimated eight million listeners. He was believed to be the most listened-to radio broadcaster in Europe.Wogan was a leading media personality in Ireland and Britain from the late 1960s and was often referred to as a \"national treasure\". In addition to his weekday radio show, he was known for his work on television, including the BBC One chat show Wogan, presenting Children in Need, the game show Blankety Blank and Come Dancing.  He was the BBC's commentator for the Eurovision Song Contest from 1971 to 2008 (except in 1972 and 1979) and its host in 1998. From 2010 to 2015 he presented Weekend Wogan, a two-hour Sunday morning show on BBC Radio 2.In 2005, Wogan acquired British citizenship in addition to his Irish nationality and was therefore entitled to use the title \"Sir\" in front of his name when he was awarded a knighthood in the same year. He died from cancer, at his home in Taplow, Buckinghamshire, on 31 January 2016, aged 77.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 3", "response": ["*1938 \u2013 Terry Wogan, Irish radio and television host (d. 2016)"]}, {"page": "BBC Radio 1", "response": ["and a gaggle of others, some transferred from pirate stations, such as Keith Skues, Ed Stewart, Mike Raven, David Ryder, Jim Fisher, Jimmy Young, Dave Cash, Kenny Everett, Simon Dee, Terry Wogan, Duncan Johnson, Doug Crawford, Tommy Vance, Chris Denning, and Emperor Rosko.

The poor performance of the entries from more traditional Eurovision countries had subsequently been discussed in European national parliaments, and the developments in the voting was cited as among the reasons for the resignation of Terry Wogan as commentator for the UK, a role he had performed at every contest from 1980.
