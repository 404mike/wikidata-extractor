He was a member of The Crazy Gang, and part of a double act, Naughton and Gold with fellow Glaswegian Jimmy Gold. In 1955, he starred in the first Guinness television commercial, playing the zoo-keeper with a German seal. He died in London.\nHis daughter, Sally, was a pre-war actress on stage and with British-Gaumont films, appearing under the name Sally Stewart. As a 23-year-old she married in an Edinburgh solicitor's office in January 1939 to Peter Croft, 21-year-old British film actor, son of Ann Croft, actress.  Sally's daughter, Naughton's granddaughter, Sally-Anne Stapleford is a five-time British champion in figure skating in the ladies event and won the silver medal at the 1965 European Figure Skating Championships.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Crazy Gang (comedy group)", "response": ["The Crazy Gang were a group of British entertainers, formed in the early 1930s.

Essentially the gang comprised three double acts; Flanagan and Allen, Naughton and Gold, and Nervo and Knox (with some input from Gray). They had all had entertainment success before the Crazy Gang but not of the same magnitude. It was natural for them to get together as they shared a similar style of comedy and worked on the same bills at theatres."]}, {"page": "Naughton", "response": ["* Charlie Naughton (1886\u20131976), Scottish comedian, member of The Crazy Gang see also Naughton and Gold"]}, {"page": "Gasbags", "response": ["*Charlie Naughton as Charlie"]}, {"page": "1976 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 11 February \u2013 Charlie Naughton, actor (born 1886)"]}, {"page": "Sally-Anne Stapleford", "response": ["Her father was the ice hockey player Harvey Stapleford.
