Hooper won all three of his caps for England during the 1894 Home Nations Championship. After the events of the 1893 encounter with Wales, England decided to emulate the Welsh tactic and switched from three three-quarter players to four three-quarter players. Hooper came into the three-quarters at centre along with Samuel Morfitt, who was also making his team debut. The first match of the tournament was against Wales, and the Welsh played a messy and confused game, that despite winning most of the scrums were unable to utilise their backs properly.Griffiths (1982), pg 65. England won 24\u20133, with Hooper making a mark during the game, from which Ernest William Taylor scored a goal."]}, {"page": "Morfitt", "response": ["*Samuel Morfitt (1868\u20131954), English rugby player"]}]}}
