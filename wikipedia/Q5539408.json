He instantly turned around the club's fortunes, using a largely home-grown squad to push for promotion to the Second Division during the season, though an injury to Len Newcombe would ultimately contribute to a second-place finish. With an ageing squad, MacDonald third and sixth-place finished in 1958\u201359 and 1959\u201360, before toying with relegation during the 1960\u201361 season. The Brentford board's decision to shrink the playing squad (which included selling prolific twin forwards Jim Towers and George Francis) and to retain a number of players on a part-time basis contributed to the club's relegation at the end of the 1961\u201362 season."]}, {"page": "Jim Towers", "response": ["Born in Shepherd's Bush, Towers began his career as a schoolboy, playing for his local Gaumont cinema team. He frequently played against another boy, the Acton Odeon cinema team's George Francis, with whom Towers' future professional career would be intertwined. Towers, along with Francis, progressed through the Acton and Brentford & Chiswick school teams. Towers also had a try-out at Fulham before signing for the junior team at Second Division club Brentford in 1948, after being spotted by manager Alf Bew while playing for his local Shepherd's Bush schoolboys team versus Brentford in Boston Manor Park. Towers was offered a professional contract in 1951, prior to departing to undertake his National Service.", "After returning to Griffin Park in 1953 and signing another contract, Towers made his professional debut on 30 August 1954 as an outside forward and made a dream start, by scoring in a 2\u20132 Third Division South draw with Shrewsbury Town. He was soon moved back to his natural centre forward position by Bill Dodgin and made 37 appearances and scored 16 goals during the 1954\u201355 season as the Bees finished in mid-table. The Bees challenged for promotion during the 1955\u201356 season, but ultimately finished in sixth place, with Towers scoring 22 goals in 41 games. George Francis broke into the team in the following campaign and so began the most productive strike partnership in Brentford history, with one London evening newspaper dubbing the pair 'the Terrible Twins'. After a lean 1956\u201357 season (scoring 13 goals), Towers found his form again in the following campaign, scoring 29 goals in 36 games to set a new single-season post-war club goalscoring record. The season ended in disappointment after Brentford were edged off the top of the Third Division South by Brighton & Hove Albion.", "Towers dropped down to the Fourth Division to reunite with George Francis at Gillingham in January 1963. He showed good form (scoring six goals in just eight games), but had an agonising end to the season after the Gills missed out on promotion with a fifth-place finish. He departed the club in July 1963.", "Prior to signing for Brentford, Towers grew up a supporter of arch-rivals Fulham. He undertook his National Service alongside George Francis in Germany with the Royal Irish Fusiliers and he represented the British Army of the Rhine team. Towers was married to Betty, had three children and after his retirement from football, he worked for 25 years as a baggage handler for British Airways at London Heathrow Airport. He died in September 2010, after suffering with a serious illness."]}, {"page": "Johnny Rainford", "response": ["Rainford dropped down to the Second Division to sign for Brentford in October 1953 and was new manager Bill Dodgin's first signing for the club. He quickly established himself in the team and made 32 appearances during a disastrous 1953\u201354 season, which saw the Bees relegated to the Third Division South. Despite averaging just under 30 games a season, Rainford's career at Griffin Park didn't take off until the arrival of Malcolm McDonald as manager in May 1957. Playing at inside forward, he provided many assists for prolific strikers George Francis and Jim Towers and set a new club record for consecutive appearances, when he played 135 matches in a row between November 1957 and September 1960."]}, {"page": "Jack Holliday", "response": ["Holliday's goalscoring form in the First Division failed to meet the heights of previous seasons, but he still managed 13 goals from 38 appearances during the 1935\u201336 season, which culminated in Brentford's highest-ever league placing of fifth. Holliday was eventually converted into a Utility player by manager Curtis and stayed with the Bees throughout the remainder of the 1930s. He played his last professional game for the club on the final day of the 1938\u201339 season, a 2\u20130 defeat to Arsenal at Highbury. The breakout of the Second World War in September 1939 saw professional football suspended, but Holliday remained with the club through the war years and made his final appearance against Reading on the final day of the 1943\u201344 season. In seven years of competitive football with Brentford, Holliday scored 119 goals in 223 games. Only two players have surpassed Holliday's goalscoring record for the club (Jim Towers and George Francis) and his 9 hat-tricks in league matches is a club record."]}]}}
