Left by Bridges as an heirloom to his family, they were placed by his brother William, secretary of the stamp office, in the hands of Gibbons, a stationer and law-bookseller at the Middle Temple Gate, who circulated proposals for their publication by subscription, and engaged Samuel Jebb to edit them. Before many numbers had appeared Gibbons became bankrupt, and the manuscripts remaining in the hands of the editor, who had received no compensation for his labours, were at length secured by William Cartwright, M.P., of Aynho, for his native county, and a local committee was formed to accomplish the publication of the work. This was entrusted to the Rev. Peter Whalley, a master at Christ's Hospital. The first volume appeared in 1762, and the first part of the second in 1769; but delay arose after the death of Sir Thomas Cave, chairman of the committee, and the entire work was not published till 1791.The History and Antiquities of Northamptonshire.

Another source states that during his time in Carlisle he \"passed a great portion of his life\" studying Hebrew, becoming deeply familiar with rabbinical scholarship which, he believed, was sometimes better able than Christian sources to \"catch the rays of light\" emanating from the Bible. He was also a prodigious letter writer, engaging in scholarly exchanges with contemporary theologians including Isaac Milner, the eccentric and endlessly curious Dean of Carlisle and his brother, the church historian Joseph Milner. Other correspondents included Archdeacon William Paley, Archdeacon Robert Markham, Archdeacon Robert Nares, Bishop Beilby Porteus and Bishop Samuel Horsley. The scholarly content of Bennet's letters must have been substantive, since the analyses and critiques that he expressed found their way across the Atlantic, and in 1802 George Bennet was the recipient of an honorary Doctorate of Divinity from Harvard College in Massachusetts."]}, {"page": "John Russell Smith", "response": ["Among the books Smith published were Robert Nares's Glossary (edited by Thomas Wright and Halliwell-Phillipps), William Barnes's Dialect Poems and Grammar, Edward Johnston Vernon's Guide to the Anglo-Saxon Tongue, and Joseph Bosworth's Anglo-Saxon Dictionary, abridged.
