His songwriting partnership with Keith Richards is one of the most successful in history. Jagger's career has spanned over six decades, and he has been described as \"one of the most popular and influential frontmen in the history of rock & roll\". His distinctive voice and energetic live performances, along with Richards' guitar style, have been the Rolling Stones's trademark throughout the band's career. Jagger gained press notoriety for his romantic involvements and was often portrayed as a countercultural figure.\nJagger was born and grew up in Dartford, Kent. He studied at the London School of Economics before abandoning his studies to join the Rolling Stones. Jagger has written most of the Rolling Stones' songs together with Richards, and they continue to collaborate musically. In the late 1960s, Jagger starred in the films Performance (1970) and Ned Kelly (1970) to a mixed reception. In the 2000s, he co-founded a film production company, Jagged Films, and through them has produced a number of feature films, beginning with the 2001 historical drama Enigma.  He began a solo recording career in 1985, releasing his first album, She's the Boss and joined the electric supergroup SuperHeavy in 2009. Relationships with the Stones' members, particularly Richards, deteriorated during the 1980s, but Jagger has always found more success with the band than with his solo and side projects. Jagger has been married and divorced once, and has had several other relationships, resulting in eight children with five women.\nIn 1989, Jagger was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and in 2004 into the UK Music Hall of Fame with the Rolling Stones. As a member of the Rolling Stones, and as a solo artist, he reached number one on the UK and US singles charts with 13 singles, the top 10 with 32 singles and the top 40 with 70 singles. In 2003, he was knighted for his services to popular music.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Andy Warhol", "response": ["According to Bob Colacello, Warhol devoted much of his time to rounding up new, rich patrons for portrait commissions\u2014including Shah of Iran Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, his wife Empress Farah Pahlavi, his sister Princess Ashraf Pahlavi, Mick Jagger, Liza Minnelli, John Lennon, Diana Ross, and Brigitte Bardot.

Declaring that he would exit the pop music world \"to study mime at Sadler's Wells\", Bowie nevertheless remained with the Lower Third. His new manager, Ralph Horton, later instrumental in his transition to solo artist, helped secure him a contract with Pye Records. Publicist Tony Hatch signed Bowie on the basis that he wrote his own songs. Dissatisfied with Davy (and Davie) Jones, which in the mid-1960s invited confusion with Davy Jones of the Monkees, he took on the stage name David Bowie after the 19th-century American pioneer James Bowie and the knife he had popularised.

Bowie performed at Wembley Stadium in 1985 for Live Aid, a multi-venue benefit concert for Ethiopian famine relief. During the event, the video for a fundraising single was premiered, Bowie's duet with Mick Jagger. \"Dancing in the Street\" quickly went to number one on release.

It appears that Parsons was mostly apolitical, although he did refer to one of the younger African-American butlers in the Connor household as being \"like a brother\" to him in an interview. During this period Parsons became acquainted with Mick Jagger and Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones. Before Parsons' departure from the Byrds, he had accompanied the two Rolling Stones to Stonehenge (along with McGuinn and Hillman) in the English county of Wiltshire. Immediately after leaving the band, Parsons stayed at Richards' house and the pair developed a close friendship over the next few years, with Parsons reintroducing the guitarist to country music.

Very often, the instrument used in pop music is the headless tambourine or \"jingle ring\", lacking a drum head. The singer should, however, play the tambourine with the overall song arrangement in mind; in some cases, band members have purposely hidden the tambourine from an irresponsible lead singer who disregards the interplay of rhythm. On the other hand, skilled performers such as Jagger have brought a fine sense of timing to their tambourine playing. In the Rolling Stones' 1964 U.S. single of \"Time Is on My Side\", the less-known version, Jagger lays the tambourine on the front of the beat while Charlie Watts holds the snare to the back of the beat, which allows the longer decay time of the tambourine to synchronise with the snare at the end.

It reached No.\u00a02 in both the US and UK. The same year, Q magazine named the Rolling Stones one of the 50 Bands To See Before You Die, and the 2002\u20132003 Licks Tour gave people that chance. It included shows in small theatres.

During the break Keith Richards was hospitalised in New Zealand for cranial surgery after a fall from a tree on Fiji, where he had been on holiday. The incident led to a six-week delay in launching the European leg of the tour. In June 2006 it was reported that Ronnie Wood was continuing his alcohol abuse rehabilitation programme, but this did not affect the rearranged European tour schedule. Mick Jagger's throat problems forced the cancellation of two of the 21 shows scheduled for July\u2013September 2006. The Stones returned to North America for concerts in September 2006, and returned to Europe on 5 June 2007. By November 2006, the Bigger Bang tour had been declared the highest-grossing tour of all time.", "The Rolling Stones have sold over 240\u00a0million albums worldwide and have held over 48 tours of varying length, including three of the highest-grossing tours of all time: Bridges to Babylon Tour, Voodoo Lounge Tour, and A Bigger Bang Tour. In May 2013, Rolling Stone magazine declared them the \"most definitional band that rock & roll has produced\". The Telegraph has called Mick Jagger \"the Rolling Stone who changed music\". The band has been the subject of numerous documentaries and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by Pete Townshend in 1989. The Rolling Stones have inspired and mentored new generations of musical artists both as a band and individually. They are also credited with changing the \"whole business model of popular music\". The only artist to top the UK Album Charts in six different decades, they are tied with Elvis Presley and Robbie Williams for the second most Number 1 albums on the Official UK Chart, surpassed only by the Beatles. In 2002, CNN called the Stones \"far and away the most successful act in rock today\", adding, \"since 1989 alone, the band has generated more than $1.5 billion in gross revenues. That total includes sales of records, song rights, merchandising, sponsorship money, and touring. The Stones have made more money than U2, or Springsteen, or Michael Jackson, or Britney Spears, or the Who\u2013or whoever. Sure, Mick attended the London School of Economics, but his greatest talent, besides strutting and singing, is his ability to surround himself and the rest of the band with a group of very able executives.\"", "From small clubs and hotels in London with little room for Jagger to move around to selling out stadiums worldwide, Rolling Stones tours have changed significantly over the decades. The Stones' early setups were simple compared to what they became later in the band's career when elaborate stage designs, pyrotechnics and giant screens were used. By the time the Stones toured America in 1969, they began to fill large halls and arenas, such as The Forum in Inglewood, California. They were also using more equipment, including lighting rigs and better sound equipment than they had used in clubs. The 1969 tour is considered a \"great watershed tour\" by Mick Jagger because they \"started hanging the sound and therefore hanging the lights\". Attributing the birth of arena rock to the Stones 1969 US tour, The Guardian ranked it 19 on their list of the 50 key events in rock music history. Before this tour the loudest sound at large-capacity shows was often the crowd, so the Stones used lighting and sound systems that ensured they could be seen and heard in the biggest arenas. The Guardian commented that their \"combination of front-of-house excellence and behind the scenes savvy took the business of touring to an entirely new level.\" During the 1972 tour, the Stones developed a complex light show which included giant mirrors that bounced the light off them.", "* Mick Jaggerlead and backing vocals, harmonica, rhythm guitar, percussion, keyboards (1962\u2013present)"]}, {"page": "Woodstock", "response": ["* The Rolling Stones were invited but declined because Mick Jagger was in Australia filming Ned Kelly, and Keith Richards' girlfriend Anita Pallenberg had just given birth to their son Marlon."]}, {"page": "1943", "response": ["* July 26 \u2013 Mick Jagger, English rock singer (The Rolling Stones)"]}, {"page": "1970", "response": ["**Mick Jagger is fined \u00a3200 for possession of cannabis."]}, {"page": "Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon", "response": ["Reportedly, Margaret had her first extramarital affair in 1966, with her daughter's godfather Anthony Barton, a Bordeaux wine producer.Heald, p. 170; Warwick, p. 245 A year later she had a one-month liaison with Robin Douglas-Home, a nephew of former British Prime Minister Alec Douglas-Home.Heald, p. 170 Margaret claimed that her relationship with Douglas-Home was platonic, but her letters to him (which were later sold) were intimate.Warwick, pp. 245\u2013246 Douglas-Home, who suffered from depression, died by suicide 18 months after the split with Margaret.

Mercury's powerful, sustained note during the a cappella section came to be known as \"The Note Heard Round the World\". In reviewing Live Aid in 2005, one critic wrote, \"Those who compile lists of Great Rock Frontmen and award the top spots to Mick Jagger, Robert Plant, etc. all are guilty of a terrible oversight.

Johns had just worked on engineering Sticky Fingers and recommended the mobile studio. Guitarist and producer Jimmy Page later recalled: \"We needed the sort of facilities where we could have a cup of tea and wander around the garden and go in and do what we had to do.\" This relaxed, atmospheric environment at Headley Grange also provided other advantages for the band, as they were able to capture spontaneous performances immediately, with some tracks arising from the communal jamming.
