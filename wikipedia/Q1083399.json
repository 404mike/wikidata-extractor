The two boxers fought at catchweights of 10 stones, 10 pounds, or roughly 68\u00a0kg (150\u00a0lbs.), currently in the very light middleweight range.  Very little fighting occurred at Wooton, and when the police intervened after thirteen minutes, the fight was moved first to Bassett, then finally to Purfleet, Essex, near London.  The purse was an exceptional \u00a31000 to be split between the two boxers and the fighting ended at Purfleet after eighteen rounds taking two hours and ten minutes. In the final round, Mace landed a right handed lunge to the left of King's jaw that knocked him out.  Puglistica wrote that \"Goss was entirely overmatched in science, length, and weight\".\"Great Fight for \u00a31000 between Mace and Goss\", Sheffield and Rotterham Independent, Sheffield, England, pg. 3, 2 September 1863First location lasted only thirteen minutes before police intervened in \"The Fight Between Jem Mace and Goss\", The Morning Post, London, Greater London, pg. 7, 2 September 1863", "He regained the English heavyweight championship against Goss in a 21-round victory on 6 August 1866 between Purfleet, Essex, and Gravesend on the North bank of the Thames, twenty miles East of London. By one reliable account, the ring used was only sixteen feet square, eight square feet shorter than the regulation size. Mace was said to be suffering from a strained left foot or ankle.  In a close physical matching, Goss was nearly the same height, and only a few pounds lighter, at around 158 pounds.  Goss, though he had the vitality of a man nearly seven years younger, did not gain from the advantage, as Mace's experience, skill, and conditioning seemed to count for more than the wear he'd received from his years in the ring.  Mace deftly avoided Goss's strong rushes with a shift of his shoulders or a bob of his head, showing great flexibility and speed.  Mace could strike or counter quickly, particularly using his left, and often did so under Goss's defences, even in the early rounds where he scored early and with precision.  Mace, in the 14th through 20th rounds, got the better of Goss, frequently striking his left eye with his right fist.  At the end of the match in the 21st round, Mace remained strong, but Goss was groggy and weak.  Mace was said to have very few injuries, but Goss had been battered around the \"head, face, neck, and chest\", with loosened teeth and badly battered eyes.  In the final round, Goss's seconds threw up the sponge ending the fight when their boxer staggered in his attempt to land a blow on Mace, who defended himself by merely stepping aside.\"Slashing Fight Between Jem Mace and Joe Goss\", The Nottinghamshire Guardian, Nottingham, England, pg. 7, 10 August 1866Mace took the 14th through 16th in \"Fight for 400 between Mace and Goss\", Cheshire Observer, Chester, Chesire, England, pg. 2, 11 August 1866", "|style=\"text-align:left;\"| Joe Goss", "|style=\"text-align:left;\"| Joe Goss", "|style=\"text-align:left;\"| Joe Goss"]}, {"page": "Paddy Ryan", "response": ["Patrick \"Paddy\" Ryan (15 March 1851 \u2013 14 December 1900) was an Irish American boxer, and became the bare-knuckle American heavyweight champion on May 30, 1880, after he won the title from Joe Goss.  He retained the title until losing it to the exceptional John L. Sullivan on February 7, 1882.", "In the most significant win of his career, Ryan defeated bare-knuckle heavyweight championship Joe Goss on May 30, 1880, in Collier's Station, West Virginia.   In the 87th round, Goss was unable to continue and the contest was stopped after 90 minutes.  Ryan's final blow was a right that knocked out Goss. Up until that time, the fight was tight and well-contested.\"His Last Fight\", The Boston Globe, Boston, Massachusetts, pg. 5, 24 March 1885 Goss's seconds claimed a foul in the 87th, and with him being unable to continue, the judges awarded the bout to Ryan. His opponent appeared winded, but Ryan was terribly battered around the face and body. Ryan was nearly twenty pounds heavier and nearly six inches taller than Goss, a discrepancy which would have never been allowed in today's boxing, and may have made the difference in the match.\"Ryan Wins\", Harrisburgh Daily Independent, Harrisburgh, Pennsylvania, pg. 1, 2 June 1889Knocked out with a right in Pollock, Adam J, John L.

His advantage in reach was apparently offset by less sophisticated defensive skills and speed, and somewhat inferior conditioning. Sullivan's seconds were Billy Madden and Joe Goss. His umpire was James Shannon. There was a dispute over the selection of a referee which was finally settled by the appointment of two referees: Alexander Brewster of New Orleans and Jack Hardy of Vicksburg. Considered ancient for a modern boxer, the thirty-seven year old Ryan knew he was battered from his long career and admitted, \u201cI meant to have retired before, but you know how it is.

According to one account, Goss had a decided lead until the 34th round.  Goss's right and Allen's left were somewhat disabled in the fighting, which caused the judges to end the fight in the 35th round in a draw.\"Pugilism\", The Illustrated Police News, London, Greater, London, pg. 4, 9 March 1867.  According to one source, the purse was 400 English pounds per side.\"The Allen-Gallagher Fight\", St. Louis Globe, St. Louis, Missouri, pg. 4, 18 August 1869", "On 7 September 1876, Allen lost the Heavyweight championship of America to Joe Goss in 34 rounds in Boone County, Kentucky, taking one hour and fourteen minutes.  The first seven rounds were fought in Kenton County, Kentucky and ruled a draw.  Each side collected $5,000. Many considered the title Allen fought for a world and not just an American title, and most boxing historians today consider the title a heavyweight world title.  According to one source, a foul caused when Allen struck Goss when he was down in the 14th, turned the decision in favor of Goss.  Some dispute occurred as to whether the blow was deliberate.  Several newspaper accounts seemed to agree with Allen that he had the better of the fight and was winning when the foul occurred.Allen was winning against Goss in \"The Campaign Spirit\", The Spirit of Democracy, pg. 3, 12 September 1876 Allen claimed to have won the bout, and stated \"It seems to me that I cannot get fair play in this country, and I now say I will never again enter the ring\".
