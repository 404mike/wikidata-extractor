He scored 18 goals in 297 league and cup appearances in a 12-year career in the Football League.\nHe began his career with Liverpool in October 1986, but never made a first team appearance before he was sold on to Port Vale in February 1989 for a \u00a330,000 fee. He helped the \"Valiants\" to win promotion out of the third tier in 1989 and 1993\u201394. Known for his dribbling and jinking runs, he was nicknamed \"Jinking John Jeffers\" by Vale supporters. He was loaned out to Shrewsbury Town in January 1995, he was allowed to join Stockport County in November 1995. He helped the \"Hatters\" to win promotion out of the Second Division and to reach the semi-finals of the League Cup in 1996\u201397. In October 1997, he moved into non-league football with Hednesford Town, before retiring from professional football at the end of the season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Rudge", "response": ["The 1988\u201389 season was highly successful, and Rudge signed a new two-year contract after Port Vale beat Bristol Rovers in the play-off Final. For the first time in thirty two years, Vale were in the Second Division. A new club record was set in January 1989, as Rudge purchased classy defender Dean Glover from Middlesbrough for \u00a3200,000. The next month he added Liverpool winger John Jeffers to the squad for \u00a335,000, using the money he received from selling Steve Harper to Preston North End. To boost the side for the oncoming 1989\u201390 season, defender Neil Aspin was purchased from Leeds United for \u00a3150,000, Aspin would play over 300 games for Vale in the next ten years. \u00a3125,000 was splashed out on striker Nicky Cross, who would play around 150 games over the next five years. Vale fans were not used to such purchases, but compared to other teams in the division, the money spent was quite modest. Now on a par with rivals Stoke City, both league games ended as draws, though Stoke were relegated in bottom place."]}, {"page": "Jeffers", "response": ["* John Jeffers (born 1968), English footballer"]}, {"page": "John Joseph Jeffers", "response": ["#REDIRECT John Jeffers"]}, {"page": "1989 Football League Third Division play-off Final", "response": ["Port Vale's opponents for the play-off semi-final were Preston North End, managed by John Rudge's predecessor John McGrath, and the first leg was played on the plastic pitch at Deepdale in Preston on 22 May.

Preston's Nigel Jemson put the home side in front on 16 minutes, before Robbie Earle levelled the score at 1\u20131 after a John Jeffers cross was flicked on by Darren Beckford. There was a pitch invasion by the Preston fans after a fire erupted under the wooden slats of their stands.  Joan Walley, Member of parliament (MP) for the Stoke-on-Trent North constituency, called for an enquiry at Parliament, but none was made. The return leg was held at Vale Park three days later. Beckford opened the scoring on 11 minutes after latching on to a Ron Futcher flick on, only for Mark Patterson to again level the tie just two minutes later.

To help with his recovery from a serious injury, Ray Walker spent some time on loan at Cambridge United, and won back his first team place in the Vale starting eleven upon his return. Meanwhile, Tony Kelly arrived at the club from Bolton Wanderers, but after a brief spell moved on to Millwall. Vale's poor attack was highlighted in October, though the defence ensured three draws from five games. In November, Darren Hughes was allowed to leave the club for Northampton Town. Rudge decided to make another big signing, and bought winger Steve Guppy from Newcastle United for \u00a3225,000. On 5 November, Vale lost all their inhibitions in front of goal, beating Southend United 5\u20130 with five different scorers. However their draw with Swindon Town would prove to be the only point gained in December, as Vale were stuck in a relegation dogfight. John Jeffers spent January on loan at Shrewsbury Town. During this spell defender Kevin Scott arrived on loan from Tottenham Hotspur. The team gelled, forming a five-game unbeaten run based on just two goals conceded to shoot up the table. In March, midfielder Ian Bogie was signed from Leyton Orient for a \u00a350,000 fee. Potteries derby day finally came on 14 March, and 19,510 turned up at Vale Park to witness a 1\u20131 draw with Stoke City, Naylor scoring the Vale's goal. Five defeats in seven games followed, raising concerns of the drop. However the Vale were unbeaten in their final five games to ensure safety.

In November, Canadian international defender Randy Samuel signed after impressing on trial, but soon was sidelined with a serious knee injury. Meanwhile, John Jeffers left the club for Stockport County. The Vale turned a corner in December, and would remain one of the division's form sides until April, losing just two league games in a run of nineteen games, picking up eleven wins. One of these wins was against Stoke, who left Burslem on 12 March with a 1\u20130 defeat. To Stoke, Bogie lived up to his name, as he scored his second league goal of the campaign in front of a Vale Park crowd of 16,737.
