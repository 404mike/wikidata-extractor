He would make the animal insensible, effectively via almost suffocating it with carbon dioxide, then determine the effects of the gas by amputating one of its limbs. In 1824, Hickman submitted the results of his research to the Royal Society in a short treatise titled Letter on suspended animation: with the view of ascertaining its probable utility in surgical operations on human subjects. The response was an 1826 article in The Lancet titled \"Surgical Humbug\" that ruthlessly criticised his work. Hickman died four years later at age 30. Though he was unappreciated at the time of his death, his work has since been positively reappraised and he is now recognised as one of the fathers of anesthesia."]}, {"page": "Henry Hickman (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Henry Hill Hickman (1800\u20131830), physician"]}, {"page": "Inhalation sedation", "response": ["In 1824, Henry Hill Hickman used carbon dioxide to achieve a state of \"suspended animation\" in animals; successfully diminishing pain during the surgical procedure."]}]}}
