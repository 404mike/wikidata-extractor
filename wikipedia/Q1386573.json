In August 1894, he became Burnley's inaugural first team manager. In 1896\u201397, the team was relegated from the First Division after finishing bottom and losing the test matches, but they were promoted straight back up again the following season. Back in the top flight, Burnley finished third in 1898\u201399, the then best position in the club's history.In the summer of 1899, Bradshaw moved south to Second Division Woolwich Arsenal, and achieved promotion with them as well. He signed several influential players including Archie Cross, Percy Sands, Jimmy Jackson and Jimmy Ashcroft for Arsenal, and brought in a Scottish style of play with short passing and fluid movement into position. After several seasons of near-misses, Arsenal finished second in 1903-04 and won promotion to the First Division, for the first time in the club's history. Eighteen of the twenty Arsenal players in the squad had been Bradshaw's signings.However, he never oversaw Arsenal at the top, as he joined Southern League side Fulham in the summer of 1904, becoming the club's first professional manager. At Fulham, he won the Southern League title twice in succession, and won election to the Second Division at the end of 1906-07. In their first season at the top, Fulham finished fourth and reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup; however, they could not maintain their ascendance and only finished tenth the next season. Bradshaw continued to manage Fulham until his contract expired in 1909.Bradshaw declined to continue as Fulham manager and instead went on to become secretary of the Southern League, a post he held until his retirement in 1921. He died in 1924. His sons, Joe Bradshaw and William Bradshaw, played for Arsenal and Fulham under him, and Joe went on to follow in his father's footsteps and was manager of Fulham between 1926 and 1929.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Fulham F.C.", "response": ["|| Harry Bradshaw"]}, {"page": "Burnley F.C.", "response": ["Burnley-born Harry Bradshaw was Burnley's first manager and was the first to win a league title with the club, taking them to the top of the Second Division at the end of the 1897\u201398 season.Simpson (2007), p. 540 John Haworth was the first manager in the club's history to win a major honour, the FA Cup in 1914; under Haworth, Burnley also became champions of England for the first time in 1920\u201321.

He declared that Ninian Park had \"the making of the finest football ground in the country\" and allowed Cardiff City to join the Southern League's Second Division. Cardiff held two trial matches at the ground, the club's professional players competing against its amateur players in preparation for the opening match. The new ground was officially opened at 5:00\u00a0pm on 1 September 1910 with a friendly against Aston Villa, reigning champions of the Football League First Division, that attracted a crowd of around 7,000 people. The match began with a ceremonial kick-off performed by Lord Ninian and ended in a 2\u20131 defeat for Cardiff. Jack Evans became the first player to score for the club at the ground. The first competitive match played at Ninian Park was the opening match of the 1910\u201311 season, which took place three weeks later on 24 September 1910. The match ended in a 4\u20131 victory for Cardiff over Ton Pentre and attracted a crowd of around 8,000. In November, a larger timber stand that could hold up to 3,000 spectators was built at the Canton end of the ground. Several players who worked as labourers in their spare time helped to complete construction. The stand was extended three years later to cover the length of the pitch."]}, {"page": "Ernest Mangnall", "response": ["Born in Bolton, Lancashire, Mangnall played amateur football as a goalkeeper and was a director at Bolton Wanderers. He started his career in football management with Burnley in March 1900, when he was hired as the club's second official manager following the departure of Harry Bradshaw almost a year earlier. The side were struggling when he joined the club, and with just one month of the 1899\u20131900 season remaining, relegation to the Second Division seemed almost inevitable. Their relegation was confirmed on 28 April 1900 after a 4-0 defeat away at Nottingham Forest. He signed three players, Henry Collins, Jimmy Lindsay and George Lockhart, in the close season. The team achieved a third-placed finish in their first season in the Second Division and finished ninth the following year. The team's fortunes suffered a swift decline in the 1902\u201303 season, and Burnley finished bottom of the Football League and were forced to apply for re-election. Burnley were re-elected and Mangnall started the next campaign as manager, but he left the club in October 1903 to join Second Division rivals Manchester United."]}]}}
