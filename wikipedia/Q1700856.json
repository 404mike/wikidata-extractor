Those views, still generally familiar, assert that peace is to be found in a region controlled by competing geopolitical powers, none of which are strong enough to defeat the others.

Only in the 1890s were the first finds on Crete recognised and published, from a cave at Kamares.  These were found  by a local archaeologist who allowed the young John Myres to publish them; Myres had realized that they were the same ware as finds in Egypt published by Flinders Petrie.  For several decades analysis of Minoan pottery was essentially stylistic and typological, but in recent decades there has been a turn towards technical and socio-economic analysis.Knappet, Carl, in Cappel, 329-334"]}, {"page": "Robert Ranulph Marett", "response": ["Robert Ranulph Marett (13 June 1866\u00a0\u2013 18 February 1943) was a British ethnologist and a proponent of the British Evolutionary School of cultural anthropology.

Marett focused primarily on the anthropology of religion. Studying the evolutionary origin of religions, he modified Tylor's animistic theory to include the concept of mana.
