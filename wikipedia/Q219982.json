Rotblat worked on Tube Alloys and the Manhattan Project during World War II, but left the Los Alamos Laboratory on grounds of conscience after it became clear that Germany had ceased development of an atomic bomb in 1942. His work on nuclear fallout was a major contribution toward the ratification of the 1963 Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.  A signatory of the 1955 Russell\u2013Einstein Manifesto, he was secretary-general of the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs from their founding until 1973 and shared, with the Pugwash Conferences, the 1995 Nobel Peace Prize \"for efforts to diminish the part played by nuclear arms in international affairs and, in the longer run, to eliminate such arms.\"", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 31", "response": ["*2005 \u2013 Joseph Rotblat, Polish-English physicist and academic, Nobel Prize laureate (b. 1908)"]}, {"page": "Enola Gay", "response": ["The display of the Enola Gay without reference to the historical context of World War II, the Cold War, or the development and deployment of nuclear weapons aroused controversy.
