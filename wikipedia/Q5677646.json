So yes, he's very capable of hurting his dad.\"", "Speaking about his casting, James said: \"I'm delighted to be joining the cast of Hollyoaks, particularly as I'm part of a very topical and potentially explosive storyline. Ali is a very complex character and I'm thoroughly enjoying the opportunity to explore his darker side.
