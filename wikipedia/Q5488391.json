Many candidates, including Medlicott, described themselves as \"Conservative and National Liberal\", or other permutations of the two names.\nWhen the East Norfolk constituency was abolished for the 1950 general election, Medlicott was elected as Conservative and National Liberal MP for Central Norfolk. In November 1956 Medlicott was a firm opponent of the Eden government's decision to invade the Suez canal zone, but his stance was not supported by the Central Norfolk Conservative and National Liberal Association which passed a resolution dissociating themselves from the views of their MP.\nOn 1 May 1957 Medlicott announced that he would not contest the next election, writing to the association to tell them that he rejected their view that the Member of Parliament should do what party leaders tell him. In November 1957, Medlicott resigned the Conservative whip. He was invited to be the Liberal Party candidate for the constituency but declined, and in November 1958 he applied to receive the Conservative whip again (which was granted). Medlicott duly retired from the House of Commons at the 1959 election. He re-joined the Liberal Party, however, he did not stand again for election. From 1969 he served as the Liberal Party's National Treasurer.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1945 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Frank Medlicott"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1950 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Frank Medlicott"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1951 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Brig.
