Duxbury became a semi-regular in the first team over the next couple of seasons, although \u2013 due to the form of first-choice full backs John Gidman and Arthur Albiston \u2013 he spent most of his time playing at centre back; it was not until towards the end of the 1981\u201382 season that Duxbury began to play in his favoured right back position. The following season, he won his first FA Cup medal with Manchester United, playing in both matches of the 1983 final against Brighton & Hove Albion. Another FA Cup medal followed in 1985, after Duxbury came on as a substitute for Arthur Albiston. He continued at Manchester United for another five years, but he found his first-team opportunities increasingly limited as he began to play more reserve matches.
