There, he would get to know a number of the artists living in the city at the time, including the sculptor August Suter, and the painter Frank Budgen,  and often used time with them as material for Ulysses.  He also made the acquaintance of the writer Stefan Zweig, who organized the premiere of Exiles in Munich in August 1919. He would continue to develop his understanding of music, learning music theory from Philipp Jarnach, working to stage music with Otto Luening, and making the acquaintance of Ferruccio Busoni.

Namely the supposed windows of the village church gradually lit up by the dawn, the windows, i.e., representing on one side the meeting of St Patrick (Japanese) & the (Chinese) Archdruid Bulkely (this by the way is all about colour) & the legend of the progressive isolation of St Kevin, the third being St Lawrence O\u2019Toole, patron saint of Dublin; buried in Eu in Normandy.\" quoted in McHugh, Annotations to Finnegans Wake: Third Edition, p.613 ALP is given the final word, as the book closes on a version of her LetterJoyce 1939, pp. 615\u2013619 ; critics disagree on whether this is the definitive version of The Letter which has been discussed throughout, or merely another variation of it and her final long monologue, in which she tries to wake her sleeping husband, declaring \"Rise up, man of the hooths, you have slept so long!\",Joyce 1939, p. 619  and remembers a walk they once took, and hopes for its re-occurrence.

In a letter to Max Eastman, for example, Joyce suggested that his decision to employ such a unique and complex language was a direct result from his attempts to represent the night:  In writing of the night I really could not, I felt I could not, use words in their ordinary connections. Used that way they do not express how things are in the night, in the different stages \u2013 the conscious, then semi-conscious, then unconscious. I found that it could not be done with words in their ordinary relations and connections. When morning comes of course everything will be clear again [...] I'll give them back their English language. I'm not destroying it for good.Ellman, James Joyce, p.546 Joyce is also reported as having told Arthur Power that \"what is clear and concise can't deal with reality, for to be real is to be surrounded by mystery.\"Cage, John. X: writings '79\u2013'82, p.54 On the subject of the vast number of puns employed in the work Joyce argued to Frank Budgen that \"after all, the Holy Roman Catholic Apostolic Church was built on a pun. It ought to be good enough for me\", and to the objection of triviality he replied \"Yes. Some of the means I use are trivial \u2013 and some are quadrivial.\" A great many of the book's puns are etymological in nature. Sources tell us that Joyce relished delving into the history and the changing meanings of words, his primary source being An Etymological Dictionary of the English Language by the Rev. Walter W. Skeat (Oxford, at the Clarendon Press; 1879). For example, one of the first entries in Skeat is for the letter A, which begins: \"...(1) adown; (2) afoot; (3) along; (4) arise; (5) achieve; (6) avert; (7) amend; (8) alas; (9) abyss...\" Further in the entry, Skeat writes: \"These prefixes are discussed at greater length under the headings Of, On, Along, Arise...Alas, Aware, Avast...\" It seems likely that these strings of words prompted Joyce to finish the Wake with a sentence fragment that included the words: \"...a way a lone a last a loved a long...\"Wawrzycka, J., \"'Mute chime and mute peal': Notes on Translating Silences in Chamber Music\", in Wawrzycka & Zanotti, S., eds., James Joyce's Silences (London: Bloomsbury, 2018), 272ff.", "One of the sources Joyce drew from is the Ancient Egyptian story of Osiris, and the Egyptian Book of the Dead, a collection of spells and invocations. Bishop asserts that \"it is impossible to overlook the vital presence of the Book of the Dead in Finnegans Wake, which refers to ancient Egypt in countless tags and allusions.\"Bishop, Joyce's Book of the Dark, p. 86 Joyce uses the Book of the Dead in Finnegans Wake, \"because it is a collection of the incantations for the resurrection and rebirth of the dead on the burial\".Ito, E., \"In the buginning is the woid\", in Joycean Japan, Nr. 13 (James Joyce Society of Japan), June 16, 2002. At one of their final meetings, Joyce suggested to Frank Budgen that he write an article about Finnegans Wake, entitling it \"James Joyce's Book of the Dead\". Budgen followed Joyce's advice with his paper \"Joyce's Chapters of Going Forth by Day\", highlighting many of the allusions to Egyptian mythology in the book.Budgen, Frank.
