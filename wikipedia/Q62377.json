Their process was known as the Siemens\u2013Martin process, and the furnace as an \"open-hearth\" furnace. Most open hearth furnaces were closed by the early 1990s, not least because of their slow operation, being replaced by the basic oxygen furnace or electric arc furnace.Philippe Mioche, \u00ab Et l'acier cr\u00e9a l'Europe \u00bb, Mat\u00e9riaux pour l'histoire de notre temps, vol. 47, 1997, p. 29-36", "Sir Carl Wilhelm Siemens developed the Siemens regenerative furnace in the 1850s, and claimed in 1857 to be recovering enough heat to save 70\u201380% of the fuel.  This furnace operates at a high temperature by using regenerative preheating of fuel and air for combustion. In regenerative preheating, the exhaust gases from the furnace are pumped into a chamber containing bricks, where heat is transferred from the gases to the bricks. The flow of the furnace is then reversed so that fuel and air pass through the chamber and are heated by the bricks. Through this method, an open-hearth furnace can reach temperatures high enough to melt steel, but Siemens did not initially use it for that.Basic Open Hearth Steelmaking, with Supplement on Oxygen in Steelmaking, third edition (The Seely W.
