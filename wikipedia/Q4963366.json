He scored his first career hat-trick in January 1968 in an 8\u20130 win over Ebbw Vale in the Welsh Cup, and went on to form one of the most prolific partnerships in the club's history alongside Brian Clark.

Two local Bristol boys Brian Clark and Roger \"Lou\" Peters who had both made their debuts in the final game v Brentford in 1961\u201362 were given increased chances at inside right and outside left respectively. Overall the forward line was consistent with the previous season. Jimmy Rogers scored only four goals in his final season with the \"Robins\" on the right wing. Alex Tait scored 13 goals from centre forward while \"Shadow\" Wiliams netted 21 goals from inside left. Jantzen Derrick also scored four goals from the left wing.

Bristol City played only home games between the away defeats in league matches at Millwall on 15 December and at Swindon Town on 2 March. The backlog in fixtures led to Bristol City playing 8 matches in April and 4 in May a total of 12 games in 43 days at the end of the season. Atyeo only played in three of these backlog fixtures with Tait switching from right wing to centre forward. Bristol City scored 100 league goals but conceded 92 during the season.

In a season of goals all five of the regular forward line reached double figures for goals. Both wingers Alex Tait and Jantzen Derrick scored ten goals, while inside forwards Clark netted 23 times and Williams scored 19 goals.

Atyeo scored 23 goals but made fewer appearances playing in only 38 matches. Atyeo began the season at centre forward flanked by inside forwards Clark and \"Shadow\" Williams. Williams was replaced for a spell in mid season by young Gerry Sharpe and then Williams was sold for \u00a311,000 to Rotherham United.
