In the contemporary report of the first day's play in the match in The Times newspaper, the day finished with Kent's first innings completed and Somerset at 30 for three wickets, and among the Somerset players yet to bat was John Challen. In the report of the second day's play in the following day's newspaper, when Somerset's first innings had been completed, Challen is not in the team and \"Mr H. E. Winter\" is the No 11 batsman, having made an unbeaten 24. Winter made 0 in the second innings and also bowled a single (four-ball) over which went for nine runs. The authoritative CricketArchive website in its record of this match makes no mention of Challen.", "link_mentions": []}}
