He made his debut for Newport on 28 January 2017 in a 3\u20131 home win versus Hartlepool United. Rose was sent off in the 3\u20132 away defeat at Cambridge United on 18 February 2017, for what seemed to be a foul on Luke Berry in the box in stoppage time; Rose, annoyed at the decision, knocked the card out of referee Trevor Kettle's hand. Joe Day saved George Maris' spot kick, but Mark Roberts bundled home the rebound. Rose faced an automatic one-match ban, but two days later this was overturned on appeal. Rose was later handed a five-match ban and charged by the FA with misconduct; he was also fined \u00a31,000 and Newport were fined \u00a32,500 for failing to control one of their players."]}, {"page": "Maris (surname)", "response": ["*George Maris (born 1996), English football midfielder"]}, {"page": "2015\u201316 Barnsley F.C. season", "response": ["| 22 September 2015 || CF ||  || George Maris || Guiseley || 24 October 2015 || ", "| 1 February 2016 || CF ||  || George Maris || Lincoln City || End of Season || "]}, {"page": "2016\u201317 Cambridge United F.C. season", "response": ["|18||George Maris||AM||||Sheffield||||0||0||Barnsley||3 June 2016||Free||30 June 2017", "| 1 July 2016 || AM ||  || George Maris || Barnsley || Free transfer || "]}, {"page": "2016\u201317 Barnsley F.C. season", "response": ["|1 July 2016 || CF ||  || George Maris || Cambridge United  || Released || "]}, {"page": "2017\u201318 Cambridge United F.C. season", "response": ["|18||George Maris||FW||||Sheffield||6 March 1996||21||23||4||Barnsley||3 June 2016||Free||30 June 2019", "|George Maris"]}]}}
