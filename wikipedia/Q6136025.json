Born in Cradley Heath, Staffordshire, Higgins played local football for Stourbridge before joining Small Heath in 1897. A centre forward, he made his debut in the Second Division on 2 April 1898 in a 2\u20131 win at Luton Town. He kept his place for the remaining five games of the 1897\u201398 season, and scored three goals, but when the club signed Bob McRoberts he decided his future lay back in non-league football.", "link_mentions": {}}}
