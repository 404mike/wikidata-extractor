They soon opened the scoring, James Higgins reacting to a shot parried by the goalkeeper, but by half time the home team had regained the lead. On change of ends, Newton Heath had much of the play, and eventually increased their lead through a Matthew Gillespie tap-in.

On a wet pitch at Manchester City's Hyde Road ground, the scoring alternated. Clutterbuck, back in goal after two games out, got a hand to Billy Meredith's shot but failed to stop it, Abbott equalised, then Stockport Smith converted a penalty awarded for handball. Leake scored from distance, then Clutterbuck parried a Meredith shot to Smith's feet. In the second half, the surface became increasingly slippery, the play correspondingly scrappy, and Michael Good tied the scores from a free kick.\"Manchester City v. Small Heath\".
