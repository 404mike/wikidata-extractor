After three successive top half finishes, City were placed in the new Division Three in 1958\u201359. Bradford spent just three seasons in Division Three, but during their relegation season in 1960\u201361, they upset Division One side Manchester United in the inaugural season of the League Cup. With 34\u00a0goals from David Layne, City nearly earned an instant promotion the following season 1961\u201362, but it did also include a record 9\u20131 defeat to Colchester United. Layne left for Sheffield Wednesday, and without him City finished second from bottom of the league and had to apply for re-election. Bradford City just failed to win promotion in 1963\u201364, winning more games than any other team in the division that season, twenty five, with Rodney Green top scoring with 29 league goals. There followed three difficult seasons during which time manager Grenville Hair died following a heart attack in training, City returned to Division Three getting promoted in 1968\u201369. City's stay in Division Three lasted just three years, when they finished bottom in 1971\u201372.
