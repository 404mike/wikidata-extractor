He was educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford. He entered Parliament for Nottinghamshire North in an 1872 by-election, a seat he held until 1885 when the constituency was abolished. He succeeded his father in the viscountcy in 1876 but as this was an Irish peerage he did not have to resign his seat in the House of Commons. On 4 July 1887 Galway was created Baron Monckton, of Serlby in the County of Nottingham, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, which entitled him to an automatic seat in the House of Lords. He later served as an Aide-de-Camp to Queen Victoria from 1897 to 1901, to Edward VII from 1901 to 1910 and to George V from 1910 to 1920. He was also involved in local affairs and served as a Justice of the Peace and Deputy Lieutenant for Nottinghamshire and as Chairman and Alderman of the Nottinghamshire County Council."]}, {"page": "Monckton", "response": ["* George Monckton-Arundell, 6th Viscount Galway (1805\u20131876)"]}, {"page": "George Monckton-Arundell", "response": ["*George Monckton-Arundell, 6th Viscount Galway (1805 \u2013 1876), Anglo-Irish Conservative politician"]}]}}
