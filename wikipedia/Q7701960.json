It records the appointment (AD 47) of the Curators of the banks and the channel of the river Tiber, one of whom was Sergius. Since Paul's journey to Cyprus is usually dated to the first half of the 40s (and some scholars date his visit even earlier), it is thought Sergius may have first served three years as Proconsul at Cyprus, then returned to Rome, where he was appointed curator.However, Jack P. Lewis, Historical Backgrounds of Bible History (Grand Rapids: Baker Book House, 1971), 153, suggests that Sergius held the curatorship of the Tiber before going to Cyprus. Another inscription was discovered in 1887 at Soli, Cyprus, by Luigi Palma di Cesnola which mentions a proconsul Paulus. This inscription was dated to the middle of the first century by D.G. Hogarth. Terence Mitford noted that based on epigraphic grounds the inscription cannot be dated earlier than this and is probably considerably later.Mitford, \"Some Published Inscriptions\", p. 205 As he is not greeted in Paul's Epistle to the Romans, it is possible he died before it was written."]}, {"page": "1905 in archaeology", "response": ["* May 11 \u2013 Terence Mitford, Japanese-born British archaeologist of the Near East (died 1978)."]}, {"page": "1978 in archaeology", "response": ["* November 8 - Terence Mitford, British archaeologist of the Near East (born 1905)."]}, {"page": "Terence Bruce-Mitford", "response": ["#REDIRECT Terence Mitford"]}, {"page": "Terence Bruce Mitford", "response": ["#REDIRECT Terence Mitford"]}, {"page": "George Ewart Bean", "response": ["He was a friend of the Oxford-educated classicist Terence Mitford, and together they undertook numerous journeys into the Turkish interior.

According to the British Museum it is from the 1st century BC. James R. Russell suggests that it was probably cast in western Asia Minor in the 2nd\u20131st centuries BC. Vrej Nersessian writes that it was probably created in Asia Minor in the mid-4th century BC. Terence Mitford argued, based on its style, that it is a work of the \"late Hellenistic or early Roman period\". He cites Reynold Higgins, who suggested that \"it may be a cast from a mould made in c. 150 B.C., whether a Greek or Hellenistic original, or a Roman copy.\" Brunilde Sismondo Ridgway writes that it is dated no earlier than the Augustan period. Babken Arakelian argued, based on a stylistic analysis, that the head is similar to statues created in Asia Minor in the 2nd century BC.", "The British Museum's website describes the work as a \"bronze head from a cult statue of Anahita in the guise of Aphrodite or Artemis.\" The Armenian scholar Mardiros Ananikian wrote in The Mythology of All Races (1925) that it is a \"Greek work (probably Aphrodite), found at Satala, worshiped by the Armenians.\" James R. Russell described it as \"of the Greek Aphrodite type [...] believed to be from a statue of Anahit but more probably from a Roman temple\". Zhores Khachatryan, a leading Armenian archaeologist of the Hellenistic period, stated that \"the Armenian origin of the statue still has to be proven\". He believes that \"it is more possible that it may be the statue of a Roman pagan goddess\" as it was found near the site of a Roman camp inhabited during the time period of its assumed creation. Khachatryan had no doubt that it is a replica of Aphrodite of Knidos. Dyfri Williams wrote that it comes from a Greek cult statue, \"probably made in a Greek city in Turkey\" and found at Satala (in Armenia Minor). Terence Mitford suggests that it is \"normally assigned to Aphrodite\" and an identification as Anaitis (Anahita) is \"wholly implausible\". Babken Arakelyan found Artemis to be a more probable subject of the statue than Aphrodite."]}, {"page": "Ino Nicolaou", "response": ["*Terence Mitford"]}]}}
