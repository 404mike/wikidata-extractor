She opined that Liv did not want to carry out the prank, but Gabby's \"nasty streak\" makes her character feel pressured to please Gabby and fit in. Since Gabby feels guilty for Liv's involvement, she takes the blame, which Steele noted has \"quite the effect\" on Liv. Liv's struggle with guilt causes her to drink more alcohol than usual, as she feels responsible for a \"massive betrayal\". A member of the Dingle family informs the police of Liv's involvement, and she is questioned by the police, and Liv then admits to spiking Lisa's drink. Miller explained that Aaron becomes terrified that Liv will be imprisoned, especially due to her asexuality.

Due to her anxiety, Liv is not able to make an apology; since Gabby has apologised, it \"paints Liv in a bad light\". Duncan Lindsay, writing for the Metro, stated that since Liv is secretly battling with an alcohol dependency, it would be difficult for her to cope in prison."]}]}}
