The band was formed by Mike Badger in 1983 and Mavers joined the next year, although for most of the group's history, the frequently changing line-up revolved around the core duo of Lee Mavers (vocals, guitar) and John Power (bass, backing vocals) along with numerous other guitarists and drummers including Paul Hemmings, John \"Timmo\" Timson, Peter \"Cammy\" Cammell, Iain Templeton, John \"Boo\" Byrne, Chris Sharrock, Barry Sutton and Neil Mavers.", "After the departure of Badger in late 1986, the band signed to Go! Discs in 1987 and started recording their debut album. Following the release of singles \"Way Out\" (1987), \"There She Goes\" (1988) and \"Timeless Melody\" (1990) and having aborted several recording sessions with different producers, the band released their debut album The La's in 1990 to critical acclaim and modest commercial success.

The band existed briefly as an arthouse/skiffle-type outfit with a few tracks released on local compilations. Lee Mavers joined in 1984 as rhythm guitarist, eventually gaining songwriting prominence and emerging as the band's enduring figurehead. Bernie Nolan,  accomplished musician formerly of The Falcons, The Russian Rockabillys and The Swampmen was the original bassist.

After three concerts, Miniski was replaced as drummer by roadie Jim \"Jasper\" Fearon, who was Mavers' school friend and one time bass player for the La's. The set lists were mostly the same as in the late 1980s, although certain encores contained some previously unheard songs such as \"Gimme the Blues\" and \"Sorry\". Since the reunion gigs it has been rumoured that Mavers has continued working on the La's' elusive second album.
