Being Human was a show with a low budget and people responsible for other, bigger productions would notice the actors. They wanted to prepare themselves for the inevitability of Tovey leaving the series. Introducing another werewolf character before Tovey thought of leaving the show would help to move that character in. When Tovey actually left the show the production team decided that Tom should be one of the main characters in the new series, taking over Russell's role. It helped that the dynamic between Socha, Crichlow (Annie Sawyer) and Molony (Hal Yorke) was good. At first When Socha got the main role he was nervous about being compared to his predecessor Russell Tovey. It helped that Tom was a completely different character from Tovey\u2019s George. In an interview with Young Hollywood at 21 November 2013 Socha said that playing Tom was a challenge for him because Tom is very different from himself, but he really enjoyed it.
