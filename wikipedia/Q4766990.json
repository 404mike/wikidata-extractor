Prince had to sign away all publishing rights to the songs on the album to Warner Bros. as part of the deal to do the soundtrack."]}, {"page": "Batman (album)", "response": ["The album was recorded in six weeks, from mid February to late March 1989, and Prince used three tracks recorded earlier: \"Electric Chair\", \"Scandalous!\", and \"Vicki Waiting\" (originally known as \"Anna Waiting\", named for his then girlfriend Anna Fantastic). Originally, the songs \"1999\" and \"Baby I'm a Star\" from earlier albums were slated to be used in the film, but Prince instead recorded an entire album's worth of material with Batman samples and lyrics. In a 2001 Rolling Stone interview, Prince revealed that the project was initially supposed to be a collaboration between himself and Michael Jackson: \"Did you know that the album was supposed to be a duet between Michael Jackson and me? He as Batman, me as the Joker?\" Prince would have sung funk songs for the villains, while Michael Jackson would have sung ballads for the heroes. This never came to fruition as Jackson was busy with his Bad World Tour and already signed with Epic Records (the label he had been with since 1975), while the film was a Warner Bros. production. The album was performed entirely by Prince, with a few exceptions: Sheena Easton duets with Prince on \"The Arms of Orion\", \"Trust\" features a sampled horn part by Eric Leeds and Atlanta Bliss, and \"The Future\" features strings by Clare Fischer sampled from the then unreleased 1986 track \"Crystal Ball\" and samples of the Sounds of Blackness choir. \"Batdance\" includes a sample of Prince's technician Matthew Larson, and \"Partyman\" features the vocal performance of then girlfriend Anna Garcia (credited as Anna Fantastic). All dialogue sampled on Prince's Batman album is taken directly from a workprint of Batman and therefore lacks ADR and foley. This is especially noticeable in the beginning of the first track, \"The Future\", with dialogue of Michael Keaton speaking as Batman."]}, {"page": "Sylvia Young Theatre School", "response": ["*Anna Fantastic"]}, {"page": "Partyman", "response": ["The song became the only Batman single to perform better in the UK, where it peaked at number 14, than in the US, where it peaked at number 18. The upbeat and humorous number features horn samples and Prince's sped-up \"Camille\" vocals, as well as a vocal performance by Anna Fantastic. The 12\" single extends the song to about six minutes in length (labeled as the \"Video Mix\"), and features the B-side \"Feel U Up\", a previously unreleased Camille track which would later be available on The Hits/The B-Sides compilation. \"Feel U Up\" was originally cut in 1981, but re-recorded in 1986 for the Camille album. Despite being intended for a totally different project, the horn arrangement and vocal style complement \"Partyman\" perfectly. The 12\" single also included a \"Purple Party Mix\", which starts with a string of samples from Prince's earlier hits and contains different lyrics. A track identified as a \"music mix\" is an instrumental of the \"Purple Party Mix\"."]}, {"page": "Anna Garcia", "response": ["#REDIRECT Anna Fantastic"]}, {"page": "Anna fantastic", "response": ["#REDIRECT Anna Fantastic "]}, {"page": "Ronnie \u2013 Talk To Russia!", "response": ["#redirect Anna Fantastic"]}, {"page": "Sheree", "response": ["*Sheree, an artist name of Anna Fantastic"]}, {"page": "Ronnie - Talk To Russia!", "response": ["#REDIRECT Anna Fantastic"]}]}}
