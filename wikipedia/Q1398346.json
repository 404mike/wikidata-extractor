Former Scotland and Lions full-back Andy Irvine was appointed as tour manager in 2010. Wales head coach Warren Gatland was the Lions' head coach, and their tour captain was Sam Warburton. The tour started in Hong Kong with a match against the Barbarians before moving on to Australia for the main tour featuring six provincial matches and three tests. The Lions won all but one non-test matches, losing to the Brumbies 14\u201312 on 18 June. The first test was followed shortly after this, which saw the Lions go 1-up over Australia winning 23\u201321. Australia did have a chance to take the win in the final moments of the game, but a missed penalty by Kurtley Beale saw the Lions take the win. The Wallabies drew the series in the second test winning 16\u201315, though the Lions had a chance to steal the win had it not been because of a missed penalty by Leigh Halfpenny. With tour captain Warburton out of the final test due to injury, Alun Wyn Jones took over the captaincy in the final test in Sydney. The final test was won by the Lions in what was a record win, winning 41\u201316 to earn their first series win since 1997 and their first over Australia since 1989.", "| Leigh Halfpenny, 49", "|align=\"left\"| Leigh Halfpenny"]}, {"page": "December 22", "response": ["*1988 \u2013 Leigh Halfpenny, Welsh rugby player"]}, {"page": "Six Nations Championship", "response": ["| Leigh Halfpenny"]}, {"page": "Gorseinon", "response": ["*Leigh Halfpenny, Welsh International Rugby Union and British and Irish Lions player"]}, {"page": "Cardiff Rugby", "response": ["Confirmed departures include Leigh Halfpenny, Harry Robinson, Chris Czekaj, Bradley Davies, Robin Copeland and Andries Pretorius.", "|Leigh Halfpenny"]}, {"page": "Scarlets", "response": ["*  Leigh Halfpenny"]}, {"page": "Munster Rugby", "response": ["Munster opened their 2020\u201321 Pro14 season with a 30\u201327 away win against Scarlets on 3 October 2020.
