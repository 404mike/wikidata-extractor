He was known to Somerset cricket fans as 'Dasher' due to his \"pace over the ground\", and he was also known for an unorthodox stroke called the 'Chewton carve' or 'Chewton chop', a stroke that cut the ball away between the slips and the covers. Denning was a left-handed top order (often opening) batsman and scored 1,000 runs in a season on six occasions.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Chewton Mendip", "response": ["* Peter Denning (cricketer)"]}, {"page": "Peter Denning", "response": ["Peter Denning may refer to:", "* Peter Denning (cricketer) (1949\u20132007), cricketer for Somerset County Cricket Club"]}, {"page": "Australian cricket team in England in 1977", "response": ["In contrast to the Australians poor start, the Somerset openers eased past 50, before Peter Denning was caught behind off Geoff Dymock for 39.

His highest batting average came in 2000, when he scored 775 runs at 40.78. He was boosted that season by an early-season tally of 160 against Oxford Universities, as part of a 305-run partnership with Peter Bowler for the fourth wicket. The partnership was only five runs less than Somerset's record for the fourth wicket, made in 1980 by Peter Denning and Ian Botham. His performances in the County Championship were less impressive than his overall first-class record in 2000; he averaged below thirty in the competition, and only reached a century once, against Lancashire. In 2001, Burns reached his highest first-class score, and only double-century, scoring 221 against Yorkshire at the Recreation Ground in Bath. The total, made on what Wisden described as the \"benignest of pitches\", included 28 fours and 1 six, and took seven and three-quarter hours. The match finished as a high-scoring draw, with over 1,000 runs being scored. Burns' score is the highest by a Somerset batsman at the Recreation Ground during a first-class match, although three players have scored more playing against Somerset at the ground; Reggie Spooner scored 240 runs in 1906, Mike Gatting got 258 in 1984 and Warwick Armstrong scored an unbeaten 303 for Australia in 1905. Burns also scored his second century in List A cricket during 2001, striking 101 not out against Northamptonshire from 112 balls. When Somerset captain Jamie Cox broke his thumb, Burns took charge of the team for six matches in June and July 2001, a role he reprised for eight matches the following season. In 2001, Somerset recorded one of the best seasons in their history: they finished second in the County Championship, their highest ever position, and won the Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy."]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Peter Denning (1969\u20131984) 269 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Deaths in July 2007", "response": ["*Peter Denning, 57, British cricketer (Somerset), cancer."]}, {"page": "John Roberts (Somerset cricketer)", "response": ["A right-handed tail-end batsman and a left-arm medium pace bowler, Roberts was one of several young players brought in by Somerset in the 1969 season \u2013 others included Brian Rose and Peter Denning \u2013 as the team set out to rebuild after the departure of much of the successful side of the 1960s. Roberts played in six County Championship matches, with his best bowling performance being four for 38 runs against Yorkshire at Headingley, the match in which Greg Chappell also achieved his career-best bowling performance. Roberts had more success in one-day cricket, playing in nine of Somerset's games in the inaugural season of the Sunday league competition; his best performance was four for 18 against Sussex, the match being played at Torquay, the first \"home\" fixture outside Somerset since the county club was founded, also at Torquay, in 1875."]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players with 100 or more first-class or List A appearances", "response": ["Englishmen Peter Denning and Graham Rose, jointly hold the record for most List A appearances for Somerset, while Marcus Trescothick holds the record for the most runs in one-day cricket for Somerset, with 7,374 from his twenty-one years with the county.

The conditions favoured batting first, but had Somerset won the toss they would most likely have chosen to bat second, given their success in chasing throughout the season. Northamptonshire captain Jim Watts opted to field, giving Somerset the benefit of batting first.Marks (1984), pp. 69\u201370. Somerset's opening batsmen began quickly, taking the score to 34 before Peter Denning was caught by the wicket-keeper George Sharp off the bowling of Sarfraz Nawaz. His wicket in the seventh over brought in Viv Richards.Marks (1984), p. 70. Before going out to bat, Richards focussed his mind on the fact that \"it wasn't a day for daring, carefree sixes. It was a day for maturity\". Rose played a patient innings for his 41 runs, before being bowled by Watts, leaving Somerset 95/2. At the other end, Richards was playing what David Foot described as \"a controlled gem\".Foot (1986), p. 198. He remained at the wicket until the final over, scoring 117 runs in a chanceless innings. His boundaries were scored predominantly from straight drives and leg hits, powerfully struck. Ian Botham played aggressively when he came in at number five, scoring 27 runs off 17 deliveries, and Joel Garner played similarly when he batted towards the end of the innings, adding 24 runs to the total. Somerset batted through their full allocation of overs, finishing on 269/8. Of the Northamptonshire bowlers, Watts was the most economical, conceding 34 runs off his 12 overs. Tim Lamb conceded the most, allowing 70 runs to be scored from his 12. The wickets were shared by the bowlers; Watts, Lamb and Griffiths took two each, while Sarfraz Nawaz and Peter Willey claimed one apiece.
