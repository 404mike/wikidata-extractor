Broun studied in Edinburgh University and worked at the observatory in Makerstoun from 1842 to 1849 before moving to India to work in the Kingdom of Travancore. He continued his studies on geo-magnetism in India and was involved in setting up observatories there apart from managing the Napier Museum in Trivandrum. One of the fundamental discoveries he made was that the Earth loses or gains magnetic intensity not locally, but as a whole. He also found that solar activity causes magnetic disturbances.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dumfries", "response": ["Thomas Peter Anderson Stuart left Dumfries to go on and found the University of Sydney Medical School.

He appears to have prepared a dictionary of English and Malayalam which is briefly mentioned by Reverend B. Bailey in his 1849 dictionary, and promoted the idea of a museum that was to become the Trivandrum Museum (now Napier Museum). The idea for the museum originated in 1843 when he wrote a memorandum to the Madras Government that local museums would aid natives in gaining practical knowledge while also helping to preserve antiquities from the region. The idea was approved in 1854 and a museum was set up in 1857. He also donated his own collection of geological specimens to this museum. About 3000 visitors were recorded in the first year of which 10% were women. The museum project was aided by John Allan Broun, an astronomer and geologist who also maintained careful meteorological records around Trivandrum. Cullen was however critical of the magnetic observations at the observatory as conducted by John Caldecott. Christian missionaries in the region found Cullen to support local culture and disapproving of missionary activities to the point that some claimed that he had become a Hindu (\"thoroughly Hindooized by an uninterrupted residence of nearly fifty years in India\"). Cullen wrote regularly in the Madras journal of literature and science and took part in discussions on a range of topics. He made a critical commentary on an enquiry into the idea that the destruction of forests was leading to a reduction in rainfall. His notes on the topic which were compiled by Edward Balfour questioned the premise and pointed out the lack of precise data (\"facts\") in the claims (\"opinions\") made by Alexander von Humboldt on deforestation leading to desiccation.  Cullen was greatly interested in applying science to economic pursuits and his interest in geology led to the discovery of graphite deposits in Kerala. Cullen also helped obtain specimens for museums in Britain. William Henry Sykes requested him to send samples of Roman gold coins discovered in 1851 at a village on a hill about ten miles east of Cannanore. These gold coins were deposited in the Museum of the East India Company.Parliamentary discussions 10 June 1864 Cullen was responsible for the introduction of tea cultivation in the Ashambu and Velimala hills.
