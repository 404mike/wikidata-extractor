McKinsey and Alfred Tarski was also a semantics for modal logic. Inspired by Paul Joseph Cohen\u2019s notion of forcing and Evert Willem Beth's semantics for intuitionistic logic, on the basis of the Heyting arithmetic and Ja\u015bkowski's formulation of the intuitionistic propositional calculus, he proposed the model theory for the intuitionistic logic of constant domains (CD) and found a modal formula which is valid in all partially ordered frames with descending chain condition but not in all topological spaces. Because the logic resulting from this semantics includes the intuitionistically unprovable Grzegorczyk's schema \\forall x(A\\lor B(x))\\rightarrow A\\lor \\forall x B(x), where x is not free in a sentence A, it is stronger than intuitionistic predicate logic. He proposed the semantics as a 'philosophically plausible formal interpretation of intuitionistic logic' independently of the near-contemporary work by an American philosopher and logician Saul Aaron Kripke, observed that his semantics validates the schema and modified the forcing relation for disjunctions and existential formulas to give an exact interpretation for intuitionistic predicate logic. Sabine Koppelberg n\u00e9e G\u00f6rnemann first in her doctoral dissertation of 1969 proved completeness of a calculus related to Grzegorczyk's semantics by both Kripke's tableau method and an algebraic method which made use of a language with the logical symbols (\\land, \\lor, \\neg, \\rightarrow, \\exist, \\forall), and then in 1971, with independent results by Dieter Klemke in 1970\u20131971 and Dov Gabbay in 1969, proved that addition of the scheme to intuitionistic predicate logic is sufficient to axiomatize Grzegorczyk's logic. Grzegorczyk's model theory has a \ufb01xed constant domain and represents a static ontology, whereas Kripke's model theory involves a quasi-ordered set of classical models, where the domains can expand along the quasi-ordering, and represents an expanding ontology with new objects created in a growth of knowledge. In other words, Grzegorczyk's semantics for the intuitionistic predicate logic is the class of predicate Kripke's models which have constant domain function. From the point of view of non-classical logics, with a help of the necessity operator \\Box sometimes denoted by \\bigtriangleup, he proposed to consider \\Box(\\Box(A \\Rightarrow \\Box A)\\Rightarrow A)\\Rightarrow A what was later called the Grzegorczyk formula/axiom, which, although that is not valid in the Lewis normal modal logic S4, when added as a new axiom schema to S4, which can be equipped into the Lindenbaum\u2013Tarski algebra, gives the intuitionistic logic which can be translated into the S4 calculus by virtue of G\u00f6del's interpretation of an intuitionistic logic via provability operator. In particular, Krister Segerberg was the first who proposed for this emerging specific system of a modal logic the name Grzegorczyk's logic and the symbol S4Grz or S4.Grz, whereas George Boolos contributed the foundational investigation of Grzegorczyk's schema in the context of proof theory and arithmetic."]}, {"page": "Journal of Logic and Computation", "response": ["The Journal of Logic and Computation is a peer-reviewed academic journal focused on logic and computing.
