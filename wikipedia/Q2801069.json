Although he designed a large number of buildings during a long career, he is best known for his role overseeing the Art Deco designs of the Odeon Cinemas for Oscar Deutsch in the 1930s. Influenced by the work of Erich Mendelsohn and Hans Poelzig \u2013 the Odeons \"taught Britain to love modern architecture\" and form \"a body of work which, with London Underground stations, denotes the Thirties like nothing else\".", "link_mentions": {}}}
