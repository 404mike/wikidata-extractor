The spire was too heavy for the tower, and Moseley's design resulted in structural damage developing.  The spire had to be shortened and capped, but this did not help.  Charles Lang Huggins , a relative of Benjamin Hall, paid for the building to be rebuilt to a design by architect George Fellowes Prynne.  Huggins supplied stone quarried from his own land at Hadlow Grange.  Fellowes Prynne studied architecture in Canada and later worked with George Edmund Street.  He was responsible for St Wilfrid's Church at Bognor Regis and the fittings (especially reredoses) of many other churches in Sussex.  There is uncertainty over how extensive his work at St Mark's Church was, and whether it can be considered a mere remodelling or a complete reconstruction.  The chancel is entirely new, as are the aisles of the nave; the nave retains its original stonework and size, but the tracery in the lancet windows and the arcades at the east and west ends are probably Fellowes Prynne's; the tower and spire were renewed, although their appearance is little changed; and a \"pert bellcote\" (in Nikolaus Pevsner's words) was added on the east end of the roof.  Another innovation was electric lighting.  Charles Lang Huggins employed the Miller and Selmes firm of Eastbourne to build the church.  One of their workers added his mark on the spire by deliberately erecting the weather vane upside down; he was sacked for this attempt at humour.

Simple Norman-era and early medieval buildings include those at Ford, Burpham (whose cruciform design is uncommon in the area), Tortington and Pagham.  Another period of churchbuilding started in the 19th century in response to increasing urbanisation.  In Bognor Regis, a church dedicated to St John the Baptist was built speculatively in 1821; it was pulled down in favour of Arthur Blomfield's large, \"uninspired\" replacement of 1886. This was in turn demolished in 1972, and the town's main Anglican church is now St Wilfrid's, a stone Gothic Revival building of 1910 by George Fellowes Prynne.
