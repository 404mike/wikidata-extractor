Early criminologies, pejoratively referred to as 'left idealist' by Jock Young 1979, were never really popular in the United States, where critical criminology departments at some universities were closed for political reasons (Rock 1997).  These early criminologies were called into question by the introduction of mass self-report victim surveys (Hough & Mayhew 1983) that showed that victimisation was intra-class rather than inter-class.  Thus notions that crimes like robbery were somehow primitive forms of wealth redistribution were shown to be false.  Further attacks emanated from feminists who maintained that the victimisation of women was no mean business and that left idealists' concentration on the crimes of the working classes that could be seen as politically motivated ignored crimes such as rape, domestic violence, or child abuse (Smart 1977).  Furthermore, it was claimed, left idealists neglected the comparative aspect of the study of crime, in that they ignored the significant quantities of crime in socialist societies, and ignored the low crime levels in capitalist societies like Switzerland and Japan (Incardi 1980)."]}, {"page": "Jack Young", "response": ["*Jock Young (1942\u20132013), British criminologist"]}, {"page": "Left realism", "response": ["Writing years later, Jock Young summed up Critical criminology's criticism of establishment criminology by saying", "Left Realism set down a marker in the United Kingdom with the work of Lea and Young (1984)Hopkins Burke, R.

For example, Steven Spitzer utilized the theory of bourgeois control over social junk and social dynamite; and George Rusche was known to present analysis of different punishments correlated to the social capacity and infrastructure for labor. He theorized that throughout history, when more labor is needed, the severity of punishments decreases and the tolerance for deviant behavior increases. Jock Young, another Marxist writer, presented the idea that the modern world did not approve of diversity, but was not afraid of social conflict. The late modern world, however, is very tolerant of diversity. However, it is extremely afraid of social conflicts, which is an explanation given for the political correctness movement. The late modern society easily accepts difference, but it labels those that it does not want as deviant and relentlessly punishes and persecutes."]}, {"page": "Jock (given name)", "response": ["* Jock Young (canoeist), British slalom canoeist, 1981 world champion in the C-2 team event", "* Jock Young (1942\u20132013), British sociologist and criminologist"]}, {"page": "White Irish", "response": ["In a 1995 study, sociologist Jock Young found that of 1000 randomly selected residents of Finsbury Park when were asked if they had been stopped by the police over the past year, the White Irish population was disproportionately large with 14.3%, in contrast to 12.8% of Afro-Caribbean and 5.8% of White British people.
