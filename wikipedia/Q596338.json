In that paper, he established the distinction between the Austronesian and Papuan languages of New Guinea. Although he never held an academic position, and was employed throughout his working life as a school teacher, S. H. Ray was an energetic fieldworker, and participated in a number of expeditions.\nHis first fieldwork was carried out as part of A. C. Haddon's 1898 Torres Straits Expedition along with W. H. R. Rivers, C. G. Seligman and Anthony Wilkin. At the time Ray was a primary school teacher, who had already made a study of two Torres Straits languages on the basis of missionary publications and data supplied by Haddon.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Papuan languages", "response": ["The Papuan languages are the non-Austronesian and non-Australian languages spoken on the western Pacific island of New Guinea, and neighbouring islands, by around 4 million people. It is a strictly geographical grouping, and does not imply a genetic relationship. The concept of Papuan peoples as distinct from Austronesian-speaking Melanesians was first suggested and named by Sidney Herbert Ray in 1892."]}, {"page": "Auld Lang Syne", "response": ["The first recording of the song was made on wax cylinder in 1898 by the Englishmen Charles Samuel Myers and Alfred Cort Hadden, who sang it in a demonstration of the new technology whilst on an expedition to record Aboriginal Australian music with figures including Charles Seligman, W.

However, there was growing evidence of their linguistic relationship to Malayo-Polynesian languages, notably from studies on the Melanesian languages by Georg von der Gabelentz, Robert Henry Codrington and Sidney Herbert Ray. Codrington coined and used the term \"Ocean\" language family rather than \"Malayo-Polynesian\" in 1891, in opposition to the exclusion of Melanesian and Micronesian languages. This was adopted by Ray who defined the \"Oceanic\" language family as encompassing the languages of Southeast Asia and Madagascar, Micronesia, Melanesia, and Polynesia."]}, {"page": "Marind\u2013Yaqai languages", "response": ["The Marind languages were partially identified by Sidney Herbert Ray and JHP Murray in 1918; the family was filled out by JHMC Boelaars in 1950.

For the most part, Malcolm Ross's (2005) Madang family includes the same languages as Z'graggen Madang\u2013Adelbert Range, but the internal classification is different in several respects, such as the dissolution of the Brahman branch."]}, {"page": "Sidney H.
