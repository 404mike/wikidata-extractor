He made 9 and 2 as Somerset were beaten by an innings, the match finishing soon after lunch on the second day. He did not bowl in the match.\nRowdon was recorded at his birth and in the Wisden report of his single first-class appearance as \"Rowden\", but according to a website covering the Rowden family, \"George Henry Rowdon\" was born in Midsomer Norton in 1914, died in 1987, and this has subsequently been adopted as the more correct version of his name by CricketArchive.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Midsomer Norton", "response": ["* George Rowdon (1914\u20131987), cricketer for Somerset"]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* George Rowdon (1936) 1 match CA"]}, {"page": "George Rowden", "response": ["#REDIRECT George Rowdon"]}, {"page": "Rowdon", "response": ["*George Rowdon (1914\u20131987), British cricketer"]}, {"page": "Rowdon, George", "response": ["#redirectGeorge Rowdon"]}]}}
