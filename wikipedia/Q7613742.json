It came as a shock to many when the Conservatives won a majority, but the 'triumphalism' perceived by some observers of a Labour Party rally in Sheffield (together with Kinnock's performance on the podium) may have helped put floating voters off.\"Key Issues in the 1992 Campaign\", BBC News, Politics '97 Although internal polls suggested no impact, while public polls suggested a decline in support had already occurred, most of those directly involved in the campaign believe that the rally only came to widespread attention after the electoral defeat itself, with Kinnock himself changing his mind to a rejection of its negative impact over time.Compare Michael Leapman \"'Rush of blood' was Kinnock's downfall\", The Independent, 26 November 1995 with Alyssa McDonald \"The NS Interview: Neil Kinnock\", New Statesman, 29 April 2010 In an essay exploring why Kinnock never became Prime Minister, Steve Richards notes that the impact of the rally on the 1992 election \"acquired a mythological status as fatal event\" after Labour's defeat.
