Born in Stevenston, he played for Annbank, Newton Heath and Fairfield.\nVance was part of the Annbank side that won the Scottish Qualifying Cup in 1895, beating East Stirlingshire in the final. He was one of several Annbank players signed by Newton Heath in the 1890s, moving to Manchester in January 1896 as cover for the injured Joe Cassidy. He made his debut for the club in a league game at home to Leicester Fosse on 3 February 1896, starting at inside left in a 2\u20130 win. Despite scoring Newton Heath's only goal in their next game \u2013 a 4\u20131 defeat away to Burton Swifts on 8 February \u2013 he then missed both matches of the FA Cup second round tie against Derby County, as well as a 2\u20131 league defeat at home to Burton Wanderers, before returning to the side for the final eight games of the 1895\u201396 season.Cassidy's return from injury and the signings of Rimmer Brown and Matthew Gillespie meant Vance only made one more appearance for Newton Heath \u2013 a 3\u20130 win over Burton Wanderers on 24 October 1896 \u2013 and he was allowed to move to Lancashire League side Fairfield in December 1896, where he joined up with fellow former Annbank players Tommy and David Fitzsimmons. However, he spent just three months there before returning to Annbank.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "James Vance", "response": ["James Vance may refer to:", "* James Vance (comics) (1953\u20132017), American comic book writer", "* James Vance (footballer) (1877\u2013?), Scottish footballer", "* James Vance (1965\u20131988), catalyst for the Judas Priest subliminal message trial in 1990"]}]}}
