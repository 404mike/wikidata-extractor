The statues were placed in a small enclosure in the central courtyard directly in front of the main gatehouse.  The statues are based on a tale by Sir Walter Scott and depict Scott talking to Old Mortality, an elderly man who traveled through the Scottish Highlands re-carving weathered tombstones, along with his pony.  A plaster bust of the artist, James Thom, was added to the display in 1872.  The owners of the cemetery intended to equate the mission of Old Mortality with their own - to keep the cemetery in perpetual care so future generations may remember the deceased."]}, {"page": "J. C.
