He grew up in Kidderminster, Worcestershire and graduated in 1989 in English and Drama from Westfield College, University of London.\nHe was the co-author of the Rough Guide to Wales, and has also written books on four British cities, and on the gay scenes of Scotland, Ireland and Northern England. In addition, Parker has worked as a stand-up comedian.\nAfter moving to Wales in spring 2000, he became involved in television, writing and presenting a one-off Saint David's Day special for HTV Wales in 2002. This led to him being commissioned to write and present two series of Coast to Coast, where Parker took twelve journeys in different boats around the Welsh coast. He made four series of Great Welsh Roads for HTV Wales, which saw Parker and his dog tour the country in a camper van.\nSince 2007, he has concentrated on writing narrative non-fiction books that start from a profound sense of place. Author and Broadcaster Horatio Clare said of him, \"A kind of mini-biography of the British psyche emerges from Parker's work, its learning lightly worn and its tales well told, full of interest and incident.\" His 2009 book Map Addict became a bestseller; reviewed in The Daily Telegraph as \"this excellent book on the pleasures of maps and navigation, which is also a withering attack on the infantilisation of the satnav age.\"\nHis 2019 book On the Red Hill won the non-fiction Wales Book of the Year for 2020, and was Highly Commended (\"An extraordinary memoir that stood out amongst our strongest shortlist to date\") for the 2020 Wainwright Prize for UK nature writing.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Michael Parker", "response": ["Michael Parker or Mike Parker may refer to:", "*Mike Parker (reporter) (1943\u20132018), Chicago television reporter", "*Mike Parker (writer) (born 1967), British travel writer", "*Mike Parker (typographer) (1929\u20132014), American typographer and type designer", "*Mike Parker (hurdler) (born 1938), British hurdler", "*Mike Parker (American football) (born 1975), American football linebacker", "*Mike Parker (EastEnders), a former character in the British soap opera EastEnders"]}, {"page": "Huw Thomas (Welsh politician)", "response": ["During the election his was highly critical of his Plaid Cymru rival Mike Parker over Parker's remarks made in 2001 about English people coming to live in Wales which he described as parts of Wales of being inhabited by \"gun-toting Final Solution crackpots\" and likened English incomers [to Mid Wales] as Nazis. Thomas said: \"There should be no place in our politics or our society for such divisive and hateful language.\""]}]}}
