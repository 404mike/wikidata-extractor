The PROBE series ran for an additional three stories; all four were written by Mark Gatiss, who found more widespread fame as a member of the League of Gentlemen, later going on to write episodes for the revived series. The potentially-confusing mixture of Caroline John reprising her Doctor Who role with other recognisable Who stars playing different characters worked against the series, as did the way that Liz Shaw often seemed to be herself a different character from the Doctor Who original. (The latter problem may have been exacerbated by the fact that, although BBV had obtained permission to use Liz Shaw, they had no rights relating to Doctor Who itself - which meant that no explicit reference could be made to any other aspect of Doctor Who, including the events of the stories in which Liz had appeared.)", "A new PROBE film was released 15 April 2015 with Hazel Burrows taking over from Caroline John as Liz Shaw."]}, {"page": "Dimensions in Time", "response": ["*This is the last appearance on television of Caroline John as Liz Shaw (John died in 2012) and Deborah Watling as Victoria Waterfield (Watling died in 2017)."]}, {"page": "The Stranger (video series)", "response": ["| Colin Baker, Caroline John, David Troughton and Nicholas Briggs"]}, {"page": "Spearhead from Space", "response": ["In the serial, which is set in Essex and London, the alien time traveller the Third Doctor (Jon Pertwee), now exiled to Earth by the Time Lords, joins Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart (Nicholas Courtney) of UNIT and the scientist Liz Shaw (Caroline John) to stop the incorporeal intelligence the Nestenes from colonising the planet through their use of the Autons, plastic killers which act as human duplicates and shop-window mannequins.", "The serial introduced Pertwee as the Doctor and was the first to feature the Autons.
