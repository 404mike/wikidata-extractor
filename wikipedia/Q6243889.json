In his third spell, he guided them to consecutive promotions and entry to the Scottish Premier League in 2002, while also leading them to the semi-finals of the Scottish Cup in the same year. He also had spells as manager of Hamilton Academical (twice, winning the First Division in 1986) and Falkirk.\nLambie was known for his eccentricity, cigar smoking and fondness for pigeons. An occasion when he instructed for a concussed player to be told he was Pel\u00e9 and sent back onto the pitch is one of the most famous quotes in British football.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Whitburn, West Lothian", "response": ["*John Lambie (1941\u20132018) - played for Falkirk and manager of Hamilton and Partick Thistle."]}, {"page": "2002\u201303 Scottish Premier League", "response": ["| John Lambie", "| John Lambie (Partick Thistle)"]}, {"page": "Ian Cameron (footballer, born 1966)", "response": ["Manager John Lambie signed Cameron for Partick Thistle on the eve of the 1992\u201393 season, the club's first campaign back in the Premier Division; he missed just two games, scoring five times from midfield, as Thistle defied predictions to remain in the top tier.

With just 40 seconds remaining it looked as if Cameron's second half penalty would keep his team in the Premier Division for another season, but fate decreed otherwise. He joined Hibernian that summer, but again found playing opportunities limited in his single year at Easter Road."]}]}}
