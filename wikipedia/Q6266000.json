Soon after his arrival, a second live episode aired to celebrate ITV1's 50th anniversary. The episode saw a desperate father hold several officers hostage at gunpoint after being angered by a teenage joyrider who killed his son in a car crash avoiding a charge of death by dangerous driving; a car crash and an explosion aired as live stunts in the 2005 episode.", "Following his arrival in 2005, Johnathan Young reduced the amount of personal and sensational storylines and shifted the programme's focus to more crime-based stories. Similar to Richard Handford in the late 90s and early 2000s, Young's plots were a mix of crime-based policing drama and personal issues, although they normally stemmed from policing, such as DC Zain Nadir falling for his target Kristen Shaw whilst working undercover with a gang of drug runners. Episode titles were reintroduced beginning with Episode #490, Sweet Revenge, broadcast on 21 March 2007. A spokesperson for the programme commented on how the titles summed up the 'essence' of an episode. The return of episode titles followed a title sequence change on January 3, 2007, paying homage to the original 1984 titles by featuring shots of London, interspersed with police work and shots of Sun Hill Police Station; the break bumpers and music were also updated. By that time the serial format was largely dropped and stories became more self-contained, with those that were serialised broadcast over two or three episode blocks. Young also axed a number of fringe characters such as civilian staff and non-police officer characters, while those he felt lacked the longevity required for the series including PC Steve Hunter, DC Suzie Sim and Superintendent Adam Okaro. However, the decision to axe PC Reg Hollis after 24 years in 2008 proved highly controversial, and led the character's devastated actor Jeff Stewart to attempt suicide. 2008 also saw the series celebrate its 25th anniversary with Proof of Life, a crossover with German drama Leipzig Homicide."]}, {"page": "The Bill (series 21)", "response": ["This series saw the programme change executive producers for the final time, Paul Marquess, quitting after three and a half years in charge; his replacement Johnathan Young, who produced The Bill spinoff Murder Investigation Team, remained in charge until the series was cancelled in 2010.

Under new producer Johnathan Young, this series saw the programme begin to step away from the serialised format, and return much of the focus to the actual policing aspect of the programme, removing the more 'soap' feel previously introduced by Paul Marquess. Most episodes consisted of two parallel stories running at the same time, much like the initial transition to hour-long episodes in 1998. However, some episodes feature entirely on one story, beginning the move back to single-themed episodes as part of a plan to completely remove serialisation - which did not take place until 2007. The series also saw a large portion of cast changes in the first few months, with a number of characters previously introduced by Marquess being axed to make way for new blood - many of them support staff and non-police officer characters. Young believed that several of the characters introduced by Marquess did not have the longevity of the more well-known characters in the show, and thus decided to give a number of highly recommended up-and-coming actors roles on the show, such as Kidulthood star Aml Ameen."]}, {"page": "The Bill", "response": ["In 2005, Johnathan Young took over as executive producer.
