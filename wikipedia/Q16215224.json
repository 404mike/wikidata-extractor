Malcolm Boyle - who wrote the Nebulous theme and edited the pilot - had written an entire original score for the show. However, due to BBC radio budget limitations, this was not used in the completed series. Nicholas Briggs had also originally created a very deep, realistic soundscape, similar to those he had created for the Big Finish Productions Doctor Who audioplays, but was advised that \"it's likely the listener will have distractions and will not listen to it more than once; therefore, the soundscape must be totally accessible from any point in the episode\", toning down the sound effects to match the series' comic nature.", "*Julia Dalkin \u2013 Nebulous's mother, Gemini (KENT's resident supercomputer)"]}, {"page": "Phantasmagoria (audio drama)", "response": ["*Hannah Fry \u2014 Julia Dalkin"]}, {"page": "List of Nebulous characters", "response": ["Gemini, played by Julia Dalkin, is the AI of KENT and the narrator of the title sequence and the ending credits. Although supposed to have the combined intelligence of three Oxford dons and a supply teacher, Gemini has failed a number of times, at one point switching off KENT's oxygen supply. The name suggests that there is a counterpart somewhere, but the only reference to this counterpart so far has been a brief comment about Gemini's evil twin, who was once sent to KENT on a weekend exchange program that the team prefer not to think about. (The character was originally called Gemini as it was intended to have two personalities and two voices; one male and one female. Whilst the idea was dropped, the name remained)", "Played by Matt Wolf and Julia Dalkin, Nebulous's parents appear only in flashbacks (although a shape-shifting alien recently posed as Nebulous's father while trying to escape a prison ship); in each episode Nebulous has a flashback to his childhood, in which his parents wanted him to become a clown and ignored such major scientific discoveries as his cure for blindness. Nebulous commonly awakes from these flashbacks saying \"I shall not clown\". To date, only Nebulous's former fianc\u00e9e Erica Flazenby has demonstrated an awareness that Nebulous has these flashbacks, as he commonly attempts to pass them off with such comments as \"Haven't you ever seen a man collapse before?\" without admitting that he has a problem. The evidence would also suggest that only Erica is actually aware of Nebulous's difficult relationship with his parents; although Paula is aware of Nebulous's childhood in the circus after a time-travelling experience took them back to the Professor's childhood, and Harry mentioned that Nebulous's old reputation was based on the inspirational idea of him going from a clown to become a scientific genius, neither of them appear to be aware of the full details of what his life was like as he grew up. It was revealed that they had two other children, Spiffo and Mofo Nebulous, with the Nebulous we know being \"Boffo\", but Mofo was killed by Spiffo during a knife-throwing \"trick\" while they were children and Spiffo was later sentenced to an infinite life sentence in Biros Optimum Security Prison (How the parents reacted to this is unknown). Subsequent episodes revealed that they eventually disowned Nebulous due to his continued interest in the sciences, and he apparently has never seen them since"]}, {"page": "The Worst Journey in the World (TV programme)", "response": ["*Julia Dalkin as Angela Turner"]}, {"page": "List of EastEnders characters (2009)", "response": ["| Julia Dalkin "]}]}}
