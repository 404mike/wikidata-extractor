The two-hour programme is divided into one-hour \"sides\" (called Side 1 and Side 2) and the names of those listeners whose requests are to be played used to be announced at the start of each \"side\"; now the names of the artists requested are announced instead.

Later, \"SOTS\" baseball caps and \"SOTS\" sweat shirts were given to successful requesters but, as of 2009, this practice ceased. Although the playlist was almost entirely restricted to music recorded in the 1960s, space was found for a time for so-called \"roots\" records from the 1950s, while recordings from that or earlier decades that re-entered the sales charts in the 1960s were also eligible.
