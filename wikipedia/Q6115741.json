He helped Huddersfield Town to promotion to the First Division, and played more than 150 matches in the Football League for the club. After his playing career finished, he spent more than 25 years with Notts County, in a variety of roles including coach, trainer, caretaker manager and scout.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tommy Lawton", "response": ["An Arsenal director helped Lawton to secure the position of the player-manager at Southern League side Kettering Town. He took up the role at the club on wages of \u00a31,500 a year in the summer of 1956. At the helm he thereafter signed several footballers such as Jim Standen of Arsenal, Amos Moss of Aston Villa, Jack Wheeler who played for Huddersfield Town and Brentford's Jack Goodwin. He was also successful in bringing to Kettering Fulham's Bob Thomas, Harry McDonald who was previously with Crystal Palace and Sunderland's Geoff Toseland. During his debut season as manager, 1956\u20131957, Kettering found themselves ten points clear at the top of the table by Christmas. As a result of this success, in January 1956 he turned down an approach from Notts County. Lawton then went on to foster Kettering towards their winning of the league title in 1956\u201357 by eight points. Out of Kettering's 106 league goals, Lawton scored 15."]}, {"page": "Andy Beattie", "response": ["Under Andy Beattie, Huddersfield Town performed strongly in Division Two; during 1952\u201353 Town and Sheffield United left the rest behind with United eventually pipping Town for the title by two points as both Yorkshire clubs gained promotion. Along the way Huddersfield had also recorded an 8\u20132 thrashing of Everton, a 6\u20130 beating of Barnsley, and 5\u20130 wins over Lincoln City and Southampton. The entire defence of Jack Wheeler, Ron Staniforth, Laurie Kelly, Bill McGarry, Don McEvoy and Len Quested played in every fixture, as did winger Vic Metcalfe, while 30-goal top scoring centre forward Jimmy Glazzard missed only one match as Town gained an immediate return to the top flight."]}, {"page": "Meadow Lane", "response": ["thumb|right| Jimmy Sirrel & Jack Wheeler statue at Meadow Lane", "Outside the stadium on Meadow Lane is a bronze statue of Jimmy Sirrel and coach Jack Wheeler.

His first season in charge of the Magpies ended with a respectable seventh-place finish after several seasons of struggle on the pitch and financial woes off it."]}, {"page": "Bill McGarry", "response": ["\"Terriers\" manager George Stephenson bought McGarry to play in a defensive partnership with Laurie Kelly. He built a reputation as a tough-tackling, sturdy wing-half, and featured ten times towards the end of the 1950\u201351 season. He then scored twice in 43 games in 1951\u201352, as Huddersfield suffered relegation. New boss Andy Beattie led the club to immediate promotion out of the Second Division with a second-place finish in 1952\u201353. McGarry played all 44 games, in an extremely settled defence that featured himself, Kelly, Don McEvoy, Len Quested, Ron Staniforth, and goalkeeper Jack Wheeler; remarkably, the six men played every minute of the campaign, and had the best defensive record in the Football League with just 33 goals conceded in 42 league games. Town's solid defence then helped them to finish third in the top-flight in 1953\u201354, just six points behind champions Wolverhampton Wanderers; McGarry was again an ever-present, scoring four goals in 43 appearances. He then scored once in 38 games in 1954\u201355, as Town posted a 12th-place finish. He then scored four goals in 41 games in 1955\u201356, as their once solid defence leaked goals and cost them relegation as they finished below 20th place Aston Villa on goal average. Bill Shankly took charge at Leeds Road in November 1956, and took the club to 12th in the Second Division in 1956\u201357; he kept faith with McGarry, who scored twice in 36 appearances. He scored six goals in 36 games in 1957\u201358, as Huddersfield rose slightly to ninth place. His goal tally included a successfully converted penalty in the 7\u20136 defeat to Charlton Athletic at The Valley on 21 December; ten-man Charlton came back from 5\u20131 down in what The Guardian described as \"the most remarkable comeback in football history\". They then dropped down to 14th in 1958\u201359, with McGarry scoring four goals in 32 games. He scored once in 38 games in 1959\u201360; Town posted a sixth-place finish under new boss Eddie Boot, who took charge after Shankly left the club to manage Liverpool. McGarry scored once in 20 appearances in 1960\u201361, as Town dropped down to 20th place."]}, {"page": "1919 in association football", "response": ["* July 13 \u2013 Jack Wheeler, American professional footballer (died 2009)"]}]}}
