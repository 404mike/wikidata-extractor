Singer-songwriter YUNGBLUD, originating from Doncaster, preserves a strong Yorkshire accent. Louis Tomlinson, who was a member of One Direction, is from Yorkshire and in his solo music his accent is often heard. Joe Elliott and Rick Savage, vocalist and bassist of Def Leppard; Alex Turner, vocalist of the Arctic Monkeys; Jon McClure, of Reverend and The Makers; Jon Windle, of Little Man Tate; Jarvis Cocker, vocalist of Pulp; and Joe Carnall, of Milburn and Phil Oakey of The Human League are all known for their Sheffield accents, whilst The Cribs, who are from Netherton, sing in a Wakefield accent. The Kaiser Chiefs originate in Leeds, as does the Brett Domino Trio, the musical project of comedian Rod J. Madin. Graham Fellows, in his persona as John Shuttleworth, uses his Sheffield accent, though his first public prominence was as cockney Jilted John. Toddla T, a DJ on BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra, has a strong Sheffield accent and often uses the phrase \"big up thysen\" (an adaptation into Yorkshire dialect of the slang term \"big up yourself\" which is most often used in the music and pop culture of the Jamaican diaspora). Similarly, grime crews such as Scumfam use a modern Sheffield accent, which still includes some dialect words."]}, {"page": "McFly", "response": ["McFly have been cited as having influenced a number of high-profile musicians in various different ways. Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson of One Direction, have credited McFly as the opening act of the first concert they had ever attended. Speaking about meeting with the group, Jones said \"it turned out that Niall and Louis were at one of our first ever shows. And they were all like, 'we copied your haircuts, and you made us want to play guitar', which is really amazing to hear. They're the biggest band in the world right now. And their favourite band was us! We influenced them. It's really strange, because you feel like a veteran!\". Reviews for One Direction's debut album Up All Night had credited McFly as a notable influence, and Horan stated the group were very happy to have such a comparison noted. McFly had contributed song-writing to the first three studio albums that the group released. The group's debut featured the Fletcher-penned track I Want, while the group's 2nd album Take Me Home featured the song I Would penned by Fletcher, Jones and Poynter. Deluxe editions of the album also featured Irresistible, a track penned by all 5 members of One Direction alongside Fletcher, Jones and Poynter. This track marked the first time Jones was credited as the producer of any McFly-penned song for the group, with this trait continuing for later songs. Horan has since established a professional relationship with McFly, co-writing a number of album tracks for One Direction with Fletcher, Jones and Poynter, including the song Don't Forget Where You Belong from their 3rd album Midnight Memories, having previously credited them for teaching the group songwriting techniques."]}, {"page": "Bessacarr", "response": ["*Louis Tomlinson, singer (One Direction)"]}, {"page": "Ryman Auditorium", "response": ["*On February 8, 2022, Louis Tomlinson ist set to perform at the Ryman as part of his tour, the Louis Tomlinson World Tour."]}, {"page": "Charity record", "response": ["|\"Artists for Grenfell\": Angel, Anne-Marie, Bastille, Brian May, Carl Bar\u00e2t, Craig David, Deno, Donae'o, Dua Lipa, Ella Eyre, Ella Henderson, Emeli Sand\u00e9, Fleur East, Gareth Malone's All Star Choir, Geri Halliwell, Gregory Porter, James Arthur, James Blunt, Jessie J, Jessie Ware, John Newman, Jon McClure, Jorja Smith, Kelly Jones, Labrinth, Leona Lewis, Liam Payne, London Community Gospel Choir, Louis Tomlinson, Louisa Johnson, Matt Goss, Matt Terry, Mr Eazi, Nathan Skyes, Nile Rodgers, Omar, Paloma Faith, Pixie Lott, Ray BLK, RAYE, Rita Ora, Robbie Williams, Shakka, Stormzy, The Who, Tokio Myers, Tom Grennan, Tony Hadley, Tulisa, WSTRN"]}, {"page": "Steve Brookstein", "response": ["In December 2009, when a Facebook campaign was launched to stop The X Factor winner from achieving the coveted Christmas number 1 spot, Brookstein backed the campaign to see Rage Against the Machine's \"Killing in the Name\" reach the top of the chart,Kerrang!
