However, during the reign of his son and successor King Henry VIII (1509\u20131547) William Courtenay was gradually forgiven. His lands were restored as far as was possible, and by letters patent of 10 May 1511 he was created Earl of Devon with remainder to the heirs of his body.

William Courtenay (d.1859) persuaded the House of Lords that \"heir male\" in the last 1553 creation of the title had meant \"heir male collateral\", and that his cousin the 3rd Viscount was therefore also 9th Earl of Devon, and his ancestors the Courtenays of Powderham had been de jure Earls of Devon from 1556.
