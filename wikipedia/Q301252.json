His influential book The Future of Socialism (1956) argued against many Marxist notions and the traditional Labour Party doctrine that expanding public ownership was essential to make socialism work, arguing instead for prioritising the end of poverty and improving public services. He offered positive alternatives to both the right-wing and left-wing of the Labour Party.\nHaving served as Member of Parliament (MP) for South Gloucestershire from 1950 to 1955, Crosland returned to Parliament for Great Grimsby (1959\u20131977). During Harold Wilson's governments of 1964\u20131970 he served as Economic Secretary to the Treasury (1964), then Minister of State for Economic Affairs (1964\u20131965). Entering the Cabinet as Secretary of State for Education and Science (1965\u20131967), he led the Labour campaign to replace grammar schools with comprehensive schools that did not use the eleven-plus for the selection of pupils. He later served as President of the Board of Trade (1967\u20131969), then Secretary of State for Local Government and Regional Planning (1969\u20131970).\nWhen Labour returned to power he served as Secretary of State for the Environment (1974\u20131976) and briefly as Foreign Secretary (1976\u20131977). In that role he promoted d\u00e9tente with the Soviet Union. He died suddenly in February 1977 of a cerebral haemorrhage, aged 58.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Capitalism", "response": ["Contemporary capitalist societies developed in the West from 1950 to the present and this type of system continues to expand throughout different regions of the world\u2014relevant examples started in the United States after the 1950s, France after the 1960s, Spain after the 1970s, Poland after 2015, and others.

Jenkins was principal sponsor, in 1959, of the bill which became the liberalising Obscene Publications Act, responsible for establishing the \"liable to deprave and corrupt\" criterion as a basis for a prosecution of suspect material and for specifying literary merit as a possible defence.Campbell, Roy Jenkins: A Well-Rounded Life, pp. 182\u2013186.", "Jenkins opposed Michael Foot's attempts to grant pickets the right to stop lorries during strikes and he was dismayed by Anthony Crosland's decision to grant an amnesty to the 11 Labour councillors at Clay Cross who had been surcharged for refusing to increase council rents in accordance with the Conservatives' Housing Finance Act 1972.Campbell, Roy Jenkins: A Well-Rounded Life, p. 432. After two trade unionists, Ricky Tomlinson and Des Warren (known as the \"Shrewsbury Two\"), were imprisoned for intimidation and affray for their part in a strike, Jenkins refused to accede to demands from the labour movement that they should be released. This demonstrated Jenkins' increasing estrangement from much of the labour movement and for a time he was heckled in public by people chanting \"Free the Two\".Campbell, Roy Jenkins: A Well-Rounded Life, p. 433. Jenkins also unsuccessfully tried to persuade the Cabinet to adopt electoral reform in the form of proportional representation and to have the Official Secrets Act 1911 liberalised to facilitate more open government.Campbell, Roy Jenkins: A Well-Rounded Life, pp. 434\u2013435, p. 467.", "Jenkins had wanted to become Foreign Secretary, but Foot warned Callaghan that the party would not accept the pro-European Jenkins as Foreign Secretary.

The Labour government nationalised industries including mines, gas, coal, electricity, rail, iron, steel and the Bank of England. British Petroleum was officially nationalised in 1951. Anthony Crosland said that in 1956 25% of British industry was nationalised and that public employees, including those in nationalised industries, constituted a similar proportion of the country's workers.Crosland, Anthony, The Future of Socialism, pp. 9, 89.

Democratic socialism is difficult to define and groups of scholars have radically different definitions for the term. Some definitions simply refer to all forms of socialism that follow an electoral, reformist or evolutionary path to socialism rather than a revolutionary one.This definition is captured in this statement by Anthony Crosland, who \"argued that the socialisms of the pre-war world (not just that of the Marxists, but of the democratic socialists too) were now increasingly irrelevant\".  Other texts which use the terms democratic socialism in this way include Malcolm Hamilton Democratic Socialism in Britain and Sweden (St Martin's Press 1989). According to Christopher Pierson, \"[i]f the contrast which 1989 highlights is not that between socialism in the East and liberal democracy in the West, the latter must be recognized to have been shaped, reformed and compromised by a century of social democratic pressure\". Pierson further claims that \"social democratic and socialist parties within the constitutional arena in the West have almost always been involved in a politics of compromise with existing capitalist institutions (to whatever far distant prize its eyes might from time to time have been lifted)\". For Pierson, \"if advocates of the death of socialism accept that social democrats belong within the socialist camp, as I think they must, then the contrast between socialism (in all its variants) and liberal democracy must collapse. For actually existing liberal democracy is, in substantial part, a product of socialist (social democratic) forces\".Pierson, Christopher (1995). Socialism After Communism: The New Market Socialism.

The American Revolution's \"No taxation without representation\" slogan implied this view. For traditional conservatives, the payment of taxation is justified as part of the general obligations of citizens to obey the law and support established institutions. The conservative position is encapsulated in perhaps the most famous adage of public finance, \"An old tax is a good tax\". Conservatives advocate the \"fundamental conservative premise that no one should be excused from paying for government, lest they come to believe that government is costless to them with the certain consequence that they will demand more government 'services'.\" Social democrats generally favor higher levels of taxation to fund public provision of a wide range of services such as universal health care and education, as well as the provision of a range of welfare benefits.Ruiz del Portal, X. 2009. \"A general principal\u2013agent setting with non-differentiable mechanisms: Some examples.\" Mathematical Social Sciences 57, no. 2: 262\u201378. Academic Search Premier, EBSCOhost. As argued by Anthony Crosland and others, the capacity to tax income from capital is a central element of the social democratic case for a mixed economy as against Marxist arguments for comprehensive public ownership of capital. American libertarians recommend a minimal level of taxation in order to maximize the protection of liberty."]}, {"page": "Harold Wilson", "response": ["The Labour Party held an election to replace Wilson as leader of the Party (and therefore prime minister).

He was Parliamentary Adviser to the Police Federation from 1955 to 1960 when he negotiated an increase in police pay with then-General Secretary Arthur Charles Evans. He ran for the Deputy Leadership of the party in 1960 as an opponent of unilateral nuclear disarmament, and despite the other candidate of the Labour right (George Brown) agreeing with him on this policy, he forced Brown to a second vote. In November 1961, Callaghan became Shadow Chancellor. When Hugh Gaitskell died in January 1963, Callaghan ran to succeed him, but came third in the leadership contest, which was won by Harold Wilson.

By 1914 and the start of World War I Germany had developed a mixed economy with government co-ownership of infrastructure and industry along with a comprehensive social welfare system. After the 1929 stock crash and subsequent Great Depression threw much of the global economy into a severe economic decline, British economists such as John Maynard Keynes began to advocate for economic theories which argued for more government intervention in the economy. Harold Macmillan, a conservative politician in the British Tory Party also began to advocate for a mixed economy in his books Reconstruction (1933) and The Middle Way (1938). Supporters of the mixed economy, included R. H. Tawney, Anthony Crosland and Andrew Shonfield who were mostly associated with the Labour Party. During the post-war period and coinciding Golden Age of Capitalism, there was general worldwide rejection of laissez-faire economics as capitalist countries embraced mixed-economies founded on economic planning, intervention, and welfare."]}, {"page": "Aneurin Bevan", "response": ["Bevan's last decade saw his political position weaken year by year as he failed to find a winning issue that would make use of his skills.
