Rangers have since explored options to increase capacity. After opening the Bar 72 area in 2006, chief executive Martin Bain said that the scheme could be replicated in the Copland Stand. A report in the Daily Record in April 2007 claimed that Rangers were planning to increase capacity to 57,000, principally by removing the JumboTron screens and lowering the pitch to accommodate more seating. These plans were said to be dependent for finance upon improved performance by the team. In January 2008, Rangers announced that they were investigating three options to further develop Ibrox. One of the proposals would have resulted in a capacity of 70,000, by replacing three of the stands with a bowl-type structure. These plans were shelved by October 2008, however, due to the late-2000s financial crisis."]}, {"page": "Simon Grayson", "response": ["Chief executive, Martin Bain, released a statement stating: \"Simon and his team have worked tirelessly to achieve the best for the football club during their time here.

In order for us to improve upon our current position we believe a fundamental change is necessary\"."]}, {"page": "2008 UEFA Cup Final riots", "response": ["Rangers' chief executive Martin Bain described the scenes as \"dreadful\" but claimed that the violent scenes \"were caused by supporters that don't normally attach themselves to our support\". He also stated that the club was \"in general, absolutely delighted with the behaviour of our supporters.\" The following day the Prime Minister Gordon Brown condemned the rioting as \"a disgrace\". Scottish Conservative leader, Annabel Goldie, said she was \"absolutely appalled\" by the footage, condemning the behaviour as \"horrific and inexcusable\".", "Rangers were drawn alongside Manchester United in the same group for the 2010\u201311 UEFA Champions League group stage, with the opening game in Manchester on 14 September 2010, with a reverse fixture in Glasgow on 24 November. The draw raised security concerns, in particular regarding the potential for possible reprisals, and the prospect of a large number of ticketless fans arriving in Manchester. United's chief executive David Gill played down the potential for trouble, emphasising instead the connection the two clubs had in both the current club managers in Alex Ferguson of United and Walter Smith of Rangers. The Rangers chief executive Martin Bain also dismissed concerns, highlighting the club's good relations, and prior Champions League meeting in 2003."]}, {"page": "George Adams (footballer, born 1950)", "response": ["Adams left Motherwell in 2003 to become director of youth football at Rangers.
