However, he lost to the Conservative Anthony Beaumont-Dark at the 1979 general election.\nOn the first day of the October Labour Party conference of that year, Litterick gave a speech criticising James Callaghan (who remained Labour leader despite having lost the Prime Ministry).  Waving a clutch of policy papers which he claimed Callaghan had vetoed, he quoted from a popular television series featuring Jimmy Savile: \"\"Jim will fix it\", they said.  Ay, he fixed it.  He fixed all of us.  He fixed me in particular.\"  Delegates roared with approval and Tony Benn described it as a \"courageous speech\".\nLitterick died in 1981 aged 51.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1979 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Tom Litterick"]}, {"page": "October 1974 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Tom Litterick"]}, {"page": "Birmingham Selly Oak (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Tom Litterick"]}, {"page": "Anthony Beaumont-Dark", "response": ["He defeated Tom Litterick of the Labour Party in 1979, and served as a backbencher until his defeat in the 1992 general election by Dr Lynne Jones, the Labour candidate.
