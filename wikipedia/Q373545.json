He persevered in building the team, strengthening his attacking lineup with the signings of David Jack in 1928, and Alex James and Cliff Bastin in 1929. As at his previous clubs, Chapman worked on improving the defence, notably through the signings of Herbie Roberts and Eddie Hapgood at centre half and left back respectively.Soar & Tyler, p. 50", "Chapman's tactics of fast-moving play meant the wing half line of John and Jones were now pushed in to cover central midfield, pivoting around the halfway line so that they could drop back to defend when necessary. Chapman was equally committed to a strong defence, saying that maintenance of a back line was \"the rock bottom of football\".Soar & Tyler, pp. 15\u201317 Arsenal's defence were told to play deep and, with the support of the wing halves, fall back into their own penalty area when the opposition had the ball; this allowed the opposition plenty of possession in Arsenal's half, until they reached the 18-yard line and faced a massed defence.Say, p. 76 Once Arsenal regained the ball \u2013 usually through the centre half Herbie Roberts \u2013 the ball would be quickly passed forward and the wing halves would push up to support the attackers, meaning Arsenal could quickly commit as many as seven men forward as a unit to rapidly attack and try to score."]}, {"page": "Bernard Joy", "response": ["Joy continued to play for Arsenal, mainly deputising for the Gunners' established centre-half Herbie Roberts.

In 1926\u201327, Arsenal reached their first FA Cup final, only to lose 1\u20130 to Cardiff City, after Arsenal's goalkeeper Dan Lewis let a harmless-looking shot slip through his arms and into the net; it was the only occasion in history that the FA Cup has been won by a club from outside England.", "Arsenal's dominance of the decade was sealed with a second FA Cup in 1935\u201336, winning 1\u20130 against Sheffield United with a goal from Drake. Arsenal faded in the League somewhat after the 1934\u201335 title, and were weakened by the retirement of Alex James and the club's inability to replace him, as well as long-term injuries to several other key players such as Herbie Roberts and Joe Hulme.
