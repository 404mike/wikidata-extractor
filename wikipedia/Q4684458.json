George Cheesman junior was again commissioned to design the church, which was dedicated to St John the Evangelist.

The area was so impoverished that Wagner arranged for an endowment fund to be set up, as its worshippers would not be able to support the church financially.  This raised nearly \u00a33,000.  Construction cost \u00a35,212.7s.11d., and the church opened for worship on 28 January 1840.  Wagner and his family contributed much towards it: he gave \u00a3200 himself, his wife and father-in-law donated \u00a3118.10s. and \u00a3265 respectively, and his mother, sister and brother George gave \u00a360 between them.

The Commissioners for Building New Churches and the Society for the Building and Enlargement of Churches gave \u00a31,500 between them as well.
