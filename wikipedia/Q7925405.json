Through Hodge, the daughter of a baronet, Bindon gained access to British aristocratic circles, which culminated with his meeting Princess Margaret in the late 1960s, at her home on Mustique in the Caribbean.", "In 1968, he met Vicki Hodge, a baronet's daughter turned model and actress, who introduced him to British aristocracy. However, he had been previously invited to the Caribbean island resort of Mustique, where Bindon claimed to have had sex with Princess Margaret. A biographer of the Princess, Noel Botham, firmly believed Bindon had an affair with her.  Returning to Mustique for a second time in 1969, he took girlfriend Hodge with him. The princess later publicly denied meeting Bindon (despite pictures of them next to one another) and was reportedly unimpressed to hear stories of their sexual encounters in the press. During this time Bindon gained the nickname \"Big John\", due to the reported size of his penis. Apparently demonstrated on multiple occasions over decades, when inebriated, Bindon was able to hang five half-pint beer glasses from his manhood.", "In 2002, a Carlton Television documentary of Bindon's life entitled Real Crime: Starring John Bindon was screened in the UK on ITV.
