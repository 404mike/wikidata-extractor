When in 1841 the Christian Remembrancer was set up, he was made co-editor with Francis Garden. In 1844, when it became a quarterly, James Bowling Mozley for a short time succeeded Garden, but during a large part of the life of the paper, which ended in 1868, Scott was sole editor. He felt deeply the conversion of John Henry Newman to Catholicism, though personally unacquainted with him. Scott took a leading part in the agitation following the Gorham judgment.

In 1846 he joined Edward Pusey and his associates in their efforts to prevent the ordination at St Paul's Cathedral of Samuel Gobat, the Lutheran bishop-elect of Jerusalem. Ten years later he was, with Pusey, John Keble, and others, one of the eighteen clergy who signed the protest against Archbishop John Bird Sumner's condemnation of Archdeacon George Anthony Denison.
