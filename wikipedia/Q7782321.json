(1856 \u2013 6 June 1934 Muswell Hill, London), was a pioneer British assyriologist.\nPinches was originally employed in father's business as a die-sinker, but, following an amateur interest in cuneiform inscriptions, joined the staff of the British Museum in 1878, working there as assistant then curator till retirement in 1900. He was lecturer in Assyriology at University College London and in the University of Liverpool till 1932 or 1933, and died in 1934.During his tenure at the Egyptian and Assyrian Department, British Museum, he gave assistance to scholars including Abraham Sachs and taught at London University. It was largely due to his \"painstaking work\" during his time as assistant keeper at the British Museum between 1895 and 1900, that many pieces acquired by the museum were joined together again. He also translated some Babylonian tablets which related to the Battle of the Vale of Siddim and was one of the editors of The Babylonian and Oriental Record from 1886. In 1890, Pinches discovered and published the correct reading of the name of Gilgamesh, instead of Izdubar.Pinches died in 1934 and \"bequeathed much of his large personal collection of cuneiform tablets\" to a favorite student, Archibald Cecil Chappelow.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Babylonian Chronicles", "response": ["The chronicles are thought to have been transferred to the British Museum after 19th century excavations in Babylon, and subsequently left undeciphered in the archives for decades.

This identification of the Gutians as fair haired first came to light when Julius Oppert (1877) published a set of tablets he had discovered which described Gutian (and Subarian) slaves as namrum or namr\u00fbtum, one of its many meanings being \"light colored\".Gelb, 1944, p. 43Gelb, 1944, p. 88 - further translates a tablet passage as \"a light (-coloured) slave girl who is pleasing to your eye.\" This racial character of the Gutians as light skinned cannot be equated to being blond.
