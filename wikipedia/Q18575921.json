Russells of Exeter began a coach service along it, though they quickly reverted to the older coaching route further south (now part of the A30). Along with engineer Goldsworthy Gurney, Hanning attempted to design a steam-powered coach that could be run along the New Direct Road. After an experimental round trip to Bath, he invested \u00a310,000 in steam carriages. Sir Charles Dance bought three carriages for trips between Cheltenham and Gloucester, but traditional horse-operated stagecoach operators sabotaged the route and Hanning's carriages did not gain widespread adoption. Nevertheless, the New Direct Road became increasingly used as a coaching route between London and Exeter in the 1820s. Ann Nelson's \"Exeter Telegraph\", a coach from London to Devon via the New Direct Road, could travel from Piccadilly to Devonport in a little over 21 hours. It remained a popular coaching route until the arrival of railways in the 1840s."]}, {"page": "Bagshot", "response": ["In Elizabethan times (late 16th century) Bagshot prospered due to its position on the main London to the West Country road (The Great South West Road, now classified as the A30). As with many villages on main coaching routes, Bagshot developed services, inns for the stagecoach passengers, and stables to provide the coaches with fresh horses. Ann Nelson's \"Exeter Telegraph\" would stop for 20 minutes at Bagshot on its 17 hour journey to Devon."]}, {"page": "Ann Nelson (disambiguation)", "response": ["* Ann Nelson (coach operator) (1772\u20131852), coach operator and London publican", "* Ann Nelson (1958\u20132019), particle physicist at the University of Washington", "* Ann Nelson (actress), played Mrs. Gertrude Berg on the television series Fame"]}]}}
