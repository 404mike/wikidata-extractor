In 1983 Alex Maskey was elected to Belfast City Council, the first Sinn F\u00e9in member to sit on that body. Sinn F\u00e9in polled over 100,000 votes in the Westminster elections that year, and Adams won the West Belfast seat that had been held by the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP). By 1985 it had fifty-nine seats on seventeen of the twenty-six Northern Ireland councils, including seven on Belfast City Council.Murray and Tonge (2005), p. 155.", "On 27 February 2005, a demonstration against the murder of Robert McCartney on 30 January 2005 was held in east Belfast. Alex Maskey, a former Sinn F\u00e9in Lord Mayor of Belfast, was told by relatives of McCartney to \"hand over the 12\" IRA members involved. The McCartney family, although formerly Sinn F\u00e9in voters themselves, urged witnesses to the crime to contact the PSNI. Three IRA men were expelled from the organisation, and a man was charged with McCartney's murder.", "By the beginning of 1985, Sinn F\u00e9in had won its first representation on local councils, owing to three by-election wins in Omagh (Seamus Kerr, May 1983) and Belfast (Alex Maskey in June 1983 and Sean McKnight in March 1984). Three sitting councillors also defected to Sinn F\u00e9in in Dungannon, Fermanagh and Derry (the last defecting from the SDLP).The three were S. Cassidy (Dungannon), J. J. McCusker (Fermanagh) and W. McCartney (Derry). Sinn F\u00e9in succeeded in winning 59 seats in the 1985 local government elections, after it had predicted winning only 40 seats. However, the results continued to show a decline from the peak of 1983, as the party won 75,686 votes (11.8%). The party failed to gain any seats in the 1986 by-elections caused by the resignation of unionist MPs in protest at the Anglo-Irish Agreement. While this was partly due to an electoral pact between unionist candidates, the SF vote fell in the four constituencies they contested."]}, {"page": "Gerry Adams", "response": ["On 30 April 2014, Adams was arrested by detectives from the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) Serious Crime Branch, under the Terrorism Act 2000, in connection with the murder of Jean McConville in 1972. He had previously voluntarily arranged to be interviewed by police regarding the matter, and maintained he had no involvement. Fellow Sinn F\u00e9in politician Alex Maskey claimed that the timing of the arrest, \"three weeks into an election\", was evidence of a \"political agenda [...] a negative agenda\" by the PSNI.

Some of the relatives of the bombing victims criticised the decision, saying that an international public inquiry covering both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland should have been established instead. The review was to determine whether enough evidence exists for further prosecutions. and to investigate the possible perjury of two police witnesses made during Hoey's trial. Sinn F\u00e9in member of the Policing Board Alex Maskey stated that, \"Sinn F\u00e9in fully supports the families' right to call for a full cross-border independent inquiry while the Policing Board has its clear and legal obligation to scrutinise the police handling of the investigations ...
