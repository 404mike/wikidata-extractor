It features Temper Temper's Melanie Williams on vocals. In the accompanying music video, Jimi Goodwin plays bass, Jez Williams plays keyboards and percussion, and Andy Williams plays keytar. The song was the act's biggest single, reaching number three on the UK Singles Chart, number one on the UK Dance Singles Chart and becoming one of many dance singles in 1993 to cross over into mainstream popularity in the UK.

One day Andy won a record there. They brought it home and played it, but didn't like it. The record was put away. In 1991, after Sub Sub had a hit with \"Space Face\" they wanted to make a follow-up to it. They spent time searching for the right sample they could use in the new song. Then Jez put the forgotten record from the fair on. It was \"Good Morning Starshine\" by Revelation. Jimi learned to play the bassline on a Roland Juno-106 keyboard, and the whole track came together quickly.  There is also another well-known sample on there, but it has never been officially known what it is, only that it is a sound, rather than a song. The band had only done instrumental and wanted to find someone to sing lyrics to their melody. Jimi's best friend, Joe Roberts, was dating singer Melanie Williams from the soul band Temper Temper at that time. They contacted her and she thought it was perfect. Williams also wrote the third verse for the song. The track was then recorded at Revolution Studios in Manchester. Sub Sub's manager Dave Rofe, Rob's Records' Pete Robinson and North South's promoter Karen Hampton were targeting BBC Radio 1 and taste-making DJ Pete Tong to give the song a listen. He got right behind it and it spread like wildfire through Radio 1. The band and Williams also performed the song on the British music chart television programme Top of the Pops after they was the highest new entry at number ten on the UK Singles Chart.
