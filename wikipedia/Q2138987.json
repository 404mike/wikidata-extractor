His work, featuring letters cut from newspaper headlines in the style of a ransom note, came close to defining the image of punk rock, particularly in the UK. His best known works include the Sex Pistols album Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols and the singles \"Anarchy in the UK\", \"God Save The Queen\" (based on a Cecil Beaton photograph of Queen Elizabeth II, with an added safety pin through her nose and swastikas in her eyes, described by Sean O'Hagan of The Observer as \"the single most iconic image of the punk era\"), \"Pretty Vacant\" and \"Holidays in the Sun\".\nHe was educated at John Ruskin Grammar School in Croydon. With Malcolm McLaren, he took part in a sit-in at Croydon Art School.Reid produced a series of screen prints in 1997, the twentieth anniversary of the birth of punk rock. Ten years later on the thirtieth anniversary of the release of God \"Save the Queen,\" Reid produced a new print entitled \"Never Trust a Punk,\" based on his original design which was exhibited at London Art Fair in the Islington area of the city \" \". Reid has also produced artwork for the world music fusion band Afro Celt Sound System.\nJamie Reid created the ransom-note look used with the Sex Pistols graphics while he was designing Suburban Press, a radical political magazine he ran for five years.\nHis exhibitions include Peace is Tough at The Arches in Glasgow, and at the Microzine Gallery in Liverpool, where he now lives. Since 2004, Reid has been exhibiting and publishing prints with the Aquarium Gallery, where a career retrospective, May Day, May Day, was held in May 2007. He now exhibits and publishes work at Steve Lowe's new project space the L-13 Light Industrial Workshop in Clerkenwell, London.\nIn 2009 following allegations Damien Hirst was to sue a student for copyright infringement, Reid called him a \"hypocritical and greedy art bully\" and in collaboration with Jimmy Cauty produced his For the Love of Disruptive Strategies and Utopian Visions in Contemporary Art and Culture image as a pastiche replacing the God Save The Queen with God Save Damien Hirst.He is also represented by John Marchant Gallery who look after Reid's extensive archive.\nIn October 2010, US activist David Jacobs \u2013 founder of the early 1970s Situationist group Point-Blank! \u2013 challenged claims that Reid created the \"Nowhere Buses\" graphic which appeared on the sleeve to the Sex Pistols' 1977 single Pretty Vacant and has subsequently been used many times for limited edition prints. Jacobs said that he originated the design, which first appeared in a pamphlet as part of a protest about mass transit in San Francisco in 1973.Reid has also been involved in direct action campaigns on issues including the poll tax, Clause 28 and the Criminal Justice Bill.His former partner was actress Margi Clarke, with whom he had a daughter, Rowan.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Punk rock", "response": ["In October 1976, the Damned released the first UK punk rock band single, \"New Rose\".Griffin, Jeff, \"The Damned \", BBC.co.uk.

The cut-up lettering (like that used in the notes left by kidnappers or terrorists) employed to create the classic Sex Pistols logo and many subsequent designs for the band was actually introduced by McLaren's friend Helen Wallington-Lloyd.Robb, John, Punk Rock, p. 86; Savage, Jon, England's Dreaming, p. 201; Strongman, Phil, Pretty Vacant, p. 111. \"We used to talk to John [Lydon] a lot about the Situationists,\" Reid later said. \"The Sex Pistols seemed the perfect vehicle to communicate ideas directly to people who weren't getting the message from left-wing politics.\"Savage, Jon, England's Dreaming, pp. 204\u2013205. McLaren was also arranging for the band's first photo sessions.Savage, Jon, England's Dreaming, p. 151. As described by music historian Jon Savage, \"With his green hair, hunched stance and ragged look, [Lydon] looked like a cross between Uriah Heep and Richard Hell.\"Savage, Jon, England's Dreaming, p. 114.

On their off night in between, the Pistols (despite Lydon's later professed disdain) showed up for a Ramones gig at Dingwalls, like virtually everyone else at the heart of the London punk scene.Robb, John, Punk Rock, pp. 199\u2013201. During a return Manchester engagement, 20 July, the Pistols premiered a new song, \"Anarchy in the U.K.\", reflecting elements of the radical ideologies to which Rotten was being exposed. According to Jon Savage, \"there seems little doubt that Lydon was fed material by Vivienne Westwood and Jamie Reid, which he then converted into his own lyric.\"Savage, Jon, England's Dreaming, p. 204. \"Anarchy in the U.K.\" was among the seven originals recorded in another demo session that month, this one overseen by the band's sound engineer, Dave Goodman.Strongman, Phil, Pretty Vacant, pp. 118\u2013119; Savage, Jon, England's Dreaming, p. 205. McLaren organized a major event for 29 August at the Screen on the Green in London's Islington district: the Buzzcocks and The Clash opened for the Sex Pistols in punk's \"first metropolitan test of strength\".Savage, Jon, England's Dreaming, pp. 207\u2013209; Robb, John, Punk Rock, pp. 212\u2013215. Quote: Savage, Jon, England's Dreaming, p. 207. Three days later, the band were in Manchester to tape what was their first television appearance, for Tony Wilson's So It Goes. Scheduled to perform just one song, \"Anarchy in the U.K.\", the band ran straight through another two numbers as pandemonium broke out in the control room.Strongman, Phil, Pretty Vacant, pp. 126\u2013129.", "\"Anarchy in the U.K.\" was not the first British punk single, pipped by The Damned's \"New Rose\". \"We Vibrate\" had also appeared from The Vibrators, a pub rock band formed early in 1976 that had become associated with punk\u2014though, according to Jon Savage \"with their long hair and mildly risqu\u00e9 name, the Vibrators were passers-by as far as punk taste-makers were concerned.\"Savage, Jon, England's Dreaming, pp. 221. Unlike those songs, whose lyrical content was comfortably within rock 'n' roll traditions, \"Anarchy in the U.K.\" linked punk to a newly politicised attitude\u2014the Pistols' stance was aggrieved, euphoric and nihilistic, all at the same time. Rotten's howls of \"I am an anti-Christ\" and \"Destroy!\" repurposed rock as an ideological weapon.Hatch, David, and Stephen Millward, From Blues to Rock, pp. 168, 170. The single's packaging and visual promotion also broke new ground. Reid and McLaren came up with the notion of selling the record in a completely wordless, featureless black sleeve.Savage, Jon, England's Dreaming, pp. 253. The primary image associated with the single was Reid's \"anarchy flag\" poster: A ripped up and partly safety-pinned back together Union Flag, with the song and band names clipped along the edges of a gaping hole in the middle. This and other images created by Reid for the Sex Pistols quickly became punk icons.Pardo, Alona, \"Jamie Reid\", p. 245.", "Vicious debuted with the band at London's Notre Dame Hall on 28 March.Gimarc, George, Punk Diary, pp. 59\u201360. In May, the band signed with Virgin Records, their third new label in little more than half a year. This was around the time that Lydon personally enlisted Dennis Morris as the band's official photographer, with Morris being constantly by their side for around 7 months. Virgin was more than ready to release \"God Save the Queen\", but new obstacles arose. Workers at the pressing plant laid down their tools in protest at the song's content. Jamie Reid's now famous cover, showing Queen Elizabeth II with her features obscured by the song and band names in cutout letters, offended the sleeve's plate makers.Savage, Jon, England's Dreaming, pp. 347, 349; Robb, John, Punk Rock, p. 348. After much talk, production resumed and the record was finally released on 27 May.Gimarc, George, Punk Diary, p. 70; Savage, Jon, England's Dreaming, p. 349.", "Attacks on punk fans rose and in mid-June Rotten was assaulted by a knife-wielding gang outside Islington's Pegasus pub, causing tendon damage to his left arm. Jamie Reid and Paul Cook were beaten up in other incidents; three days after the Pegasus assault, Rotten was attacked again.Savage, Jon, England's Dreaming, pp. 365\u2013366. According to Cook, after the God Save The Queen single and the Bill Grundy incident, the Pistols were public enemy number one, and there was a rivalry between gangs of rockabillies or Teddie Boys and the punks which resulted in many fights. A tour of Scandinavia, planned to start at the end of the month, was delayed until mid-July. In Oslo, Lydon posed for photographs by making the Nazi salute while wearing a sweater with a Swastika. During the tour, a Swedish interviewer told Jones that \"a lot of people\" regarded the band as McLaren's \"creation\". Jones replied, \"He's our manager, that's all. He's got nothing to do with the music or the image...he's just a good manager.\" In another interview, Rotten professed bafflement at the furore surrounding the group: \"I don't understand it. All we're trying to do is destroy everything.\"Rockwell, John (7 August 1977), \"The Sex Pistols: A Fired-Up Rock Band\", New York Times. At the end of August came SPOTS\u2014Sex Pistols on Tour Secretly, a surreptitious UK tour with the band playing under pseudonyms to avoid cancellation.Savage, Jon, England's Dreaming, pp. 390\u2013392.", "Along with their abundant musical influence, the Sex Pistols' cultural reverberations are evident elsewhere. Jamie Reid's work for the band is regarded as among the most important graphic design of the 1970s and still influences the field in the 21st century.Raimes, Jonathan et al., Retro Graphics, p. 164; \"Jamie Reid: The Art of Punk\" (June 2004), Computer Arts , pp. 46\u201348. By the age of twenty-one, Sid Vicious was already a \"t-shirt-selling icon\".Strongman, Phil, Pretty Vacant, p. 235. While the manner of his death signified for many the inevitable failure of punk's social ambitions, it cemented his image as an archetype of doomed youth.Savage, Jon, England's Dreaming, p. 530. British punk fashion, still widely influential, is now customarily credited to Westwood and McLaren; as Johnny Rotten, Lydon had a lasting effect as well, especially through his bricolage approach to personal style: he \"would wear a velvet collared drape jacket (ted) festooned with safety pins (Jackie Curtis through the New York punk scene), massive pin-stripe pegs (modernist), a pin-collar Wemblex (mod) customised into an Anarchy shirt (punk) and brothel creepers (ted).\"Douglas, Mark, \"Fashions, Youth\", pp. 188\u2013189. Quote: Jon Savage, in Mulholland, Neil, The Cultural Devolution, p. 72. Christopher Nolan, director of the Batman movie The Dark Knight, has said that Rotten inspired the characterization of The Joker, played by Heath Ledger. According to Nolan, \"We very much took the view in looking at the character of the Joker that what's strong about him is this idea of anarchy. This commitment to anarchy, this commitment to chaos.\" ", "Lydon, in turn, dismissed McLaren's influence: \"We made our own scandal just by being ourselves. Maybe it was that he knew he was redundant, so he overcompensated. All the talk about the French Situationists being associated with punk is bollocks. It's nonsense!\"Lydon, John, Rotten, p. 3. Cook concurs: \"Situationism had nothing to do with us. The Jamie Reids and Malcolms were excited because we were the real thing. I suppose we were what they were dreaming of.\"Lydon, John, Rotten, p. 186. According to Lydon, \"If we had an aim, it was to force our own, working-class opinions into the mainstream, which was unheard of in pop music at the time.\"", "According to Pistols tour manager Noel Monk and journalist Jimmy Guterman, Lydon was much more than \"the band's mouthpiece. He's its raging brain. McLaren or his friend Jamie Reid might drop a word like 'anarchy' or 'vacant' that Rotten seizes upon and turns into a manifesto, but McLaren is not the Svengali to Rotten he'd like to be perceived as. McLaren thought he was working with a tabula rasa, but he soon found out that Rotten has ideas of his own\".Monk, Noel, and Jimmy Guterman, 12 Days on the Road, pp. 76\u201377. On the other hand, there is little disagreement about McLaren's marketing talent and his crucial role in making the band a subcultural phenomenon soon after its debut.Monk, Noel, and Jimmy Guterman, 12 Days on the Road, p. 77. Temple adds that \"he catalyzed so many people's heads. He had so many just extraordinary ideas\".Temple, Julien, \"Commentary\", 37:03\u201337:09.

Crass and the Poison Girls funded the rented Wapping Autonomy Centre with a benefit single and this then inspired other squatted self-managed social centres in London such as the Ambulance Station on Old Kent Road, Centro Iberico, Molly's Caf\u00e9 on Upper Street and the Bingo Hall opposite Highbury & Islington station (now the Garage).

Characteristics associated with punk art is the usage of black or gray colors, and letters cut out from newspapers and magazines: a device previously associated with Dada collage and kidnap ransom notes. A prominent example of that style is the cover of the Sex Pistols' Never Mind the Bollocks album designed by Jamie Reid. Images and figures are also sometimes cut and pasted from magazines and newspapers to create a collage."]}, {"page": "Syd Barrett", "response": ["In August 1974, Jenner persuaded Barrett to return to Abbey Road Studios in hope of recording another album. According to John Leckie, who engineered these sessions, even at this point Syd still \"looked like he did when he was younger\u00a0... long haired\". The sessions lasted three days and consisted of blues rhythm tracks with tentative and disjointed guitar overdubs. Barrett recorded eleven tracks, the only one of which to be titled was \"If You Go, Don't Be Slow\". Once again, Barrett withdrew from the music industry, but this time for good. He sold the rights to his solo albums back to the record label and moved into a London hotel. During this period, several attempts to employ him as a record producer (including one by Jamie Reid on behalf of the Sex Pistols, and another by the Damned, who wanted him to produce their second album) were fruitless."]}, {"page": "Some Product: Carri on Sex Pistols", "response": ["The artwork was done by artist Jamie Reid."]}, {"page": "History of the punk subculture", "response": ["A number of philosophical and artistic movements were influences on and precursors to the punk movement.  The most overt is anarchism, especially its artistic inceptions.  The cultural critique and strategies for revolutionary action offered by the Situationist International in the 1950s and 1960s were an influence on the vanguard of the British punk movement, particularly the Sex Pistols.  Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren consciously embraced situationist ideas, which are also reflected in the clothing designed for the band by Vivienne Westwood and the visual artwork of the Situationist-affiliated Jamie Reid, who designed many of the band's graphics. Nihilism also had a hand in the development of punk's careless, humorous, and sometimes bleak character. Marxism gave punk some of its revolutionary zeal."]}, {"page": "Deny (album)", "response": ["The album is made up of completely original Ex Pistols songs, and most tracks that had been previously included on other releases are re-recorded on this album. Most copies came complete with a two-sided printed sheet that was also produced by Dave Goodman: a mish-mash of lyrics in a typical Jamie Reid style, and a background made up of various phrases that play on the 'fake Pistols' theme of the band (for example: \"Never Trust a Yuppie\", \"Hash From Chaos\" and \"Never Mind The Ollocks Here's The Ex Pistols\", as opposed to \"Never Trust a Hippy, \"Cash From Chaos\" and \"Never Mind The Bollocks Here's The Sex Pistols\")."]}, {"page": "Croydon College", "response": ["In June 1968, there was a six-day student protest that included Robin Scott, Malcolm McLaren, and Jamie Reid (all students at the time).Bromberg, Craig.

The group became victims of label upheaval upon the record's release, and as with its predecessor, it proved commercially unsuccessful and failed to chart. On the UK Singles Chart, \"Come Taste My Mind\", which featured a remix by Jamie Reid on the B-side, peaked at number 80 in February 1998, and \"Universal Plan\", which was released in May to coincide with the album and tour, reached number 91 the following month. Despite its poor sales, Tonight You Are the Special One received critical acclaim. Roy Wilkinson of Select felt that the band were able to \"capture more of Britain than most bands manage in their whole careers.\" Though commenting that the group should be as admired for their presence as their recordings, he concluded that \"the Brutus should be cherished by all.\" The magazine later ranked it at number 28 in their list of the year's best albums. Fiona Shepherd of The List praised the album's glam rock riffs, intense rhythms and provocative vocals, and felt that Earl Brutus' \"total lack of self-consciousness about their glam racket, influences and appearances\" was comparable to Rocket from the Crypt."]}, {"page": "List of people from the London Borough of Croydon", "response": ["* Jamie Reid (1947\u2013), situationist, artist, graphic designer "]}, {"page": "Brixton Artists Collective", "response": ["The gallery was a place for those unable to access mainstream spaces to show their work.
