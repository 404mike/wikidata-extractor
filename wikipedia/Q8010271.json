A portrait of the son (watercolours on ivory) by the Italian painter Gustavo Lazzarini, was acquired in 1972 by the Preservation Society of Newport County in the United States of America (Ref. RI010048)  from a very large family of fifteen children- seven sons and eight daughters.Agnew\u2019s Protestant Exiles from France, Chiefly in the Reign of Louis XIV: Or, The Huguenot Refugees and Their Descendants in Great Britain and Ireland(Turnbull & Spears, 1886), vol. 2, p.392. His mother was Anna Norris (1728\u20131816), only daughter of John Norris, of Witton, in the same county, and sister to John Norris, founder of the Norrisian professorship at Cambridge. The Aufr\u00e8re family were of noble French lineage, and proud Protestant Huguenots who had left France on the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685. As the eldest child, his parents had in mind a legal career for their son, and he was admitted to Gray\u2019s Inn in 1773 as a fifteen-year-old.\"Jan 28. [1773] Anthony Aufrere, son of Anthony.A., of Hovetone St. Peter, Norfolk, Esq.\"The Register of Admissions to Gray's Inn, 1521\u20131889 (London, 1889), p.387. Not much is known about his early life but he appears to have got into serious financial difficulties and his friend, the Reverend William Gunn (1750\u20131841), rector of Sloley, Norfolk, helped him out in 1781 with his debts. Aufr\u00e8re was called to the Bar in February 1782.\"Last week the Honourable Society of Gray\u2019s Inn, called Jeremiah Church, John Matthews Grimwood, and Anthony Aufrere, Esquires, to the Degree of Barristers at Law.\" St. James's Chronicle or the British Evening Post (London, England), 14 February 1782 \u2013 16 February 1782; Issue 3268. Details pertaining to Inn practice and if Aufr\u00e8re was allowed chambers remains unclear. Three years later a friend of Gunn's wrote to him in 1785 \"Anthony has given up the law and is now at Boulogne\".Norfolk Register Office: WGN 1/1/78 Jacob Preston to William Gunn, 26 Apr 1785 In what appears to have been an attempt to flee his creditors, he went abroad. He met up with his friend Gunn in Pisa, Italy, who was on a Grand Tour, and they both continued to Florence. According to Riviere, Gunn's biographer, Aufr\u00e8re later settled in Florence in 1785. The American royalist Thomas Hall (1750\u20131824), chaplain to the British factory at Leghorn (Livorno), also an antiquary, wrote to Gunn in October 1785 about \"news of Aufr\u00e8re who lives at Pisa\".NRO WGN 1/1/82 10 Oct 1785 T. Hall, Leghorn, to William Gunn, Neatishead Riviere writes of \"Aufrere\u2019s old lodgings by the centre bridge\" presumably he lived in the Via Borgo Stretto by the Ponte di mezzo over the Arno river.  This proximity would explain part of Aufr\u00e8re\u2019s \"Queries sent me by Mr. Gunn; with my answers (1786)\", first published by Riviere in 1965, consisting of some 25 questions and answers on different Italian topics, ranging from the origin of the sham battle the Gioco del Ponte in Pisa to the Linnean name of the fish (Argentina Sphyrana) used in making false pearls at Rome.Michael Riviere, MA., \"The Rev. William Gunn B.D., A Norfolk Parson on the Grand Tour\", in: Norfolk Archaeology, or miscellaneous tracts relating to the antiquities of the County of Norfolk, vol. XXXIII, 1965, Part III, pp.351-378, & Part IV, pp.379-398; Riviere is extremely prejudiced towards Aufr\u00e8re in his account here. In January 1786 Aufr\u00e8re travelled to Naples, and he said himself that he visited Rome for the first time in the winter of 1786, as he recalled seeing Charlotte Stuart, Duchess of Albany there.Viator A to Mr. Urban, 23 Aug., Gentleman\u2019s Magazine, Bd. 67, 1797, Pt. 2, p.1000 In 1787 it was reported that he was back in Florence, and in the same year he was also in Geneva, where he studied with the celebrated language teacher Monsieur de Rodon.We presume that he may have studied German in Geneva. Aufr\u00e8re also speaks highly of his cousin, Philip DuVal Aufr\u00e8re (died London 14 March 1808), who died at the age of 76, as \"my kind friend and benefactor\"(Genealogical Notes, op cit. p.,56); the son of his father\u2019s sister Marieanne Aufr\u00e8re. \"He was educated at Westminster, Cambridge and G\u00f6ttingen, took orders, was Subpreceptor to some of the Royal family of England and at the time of his death was Dr of Divinity, Canon of Windsor, and Vicar of Twickenham.\" His father was Dr Philip DuVal Aufr\u00e8re, a French refugee physician, who had studied under Herman Boerhaave, and was first Physician to the Dowager Princess of Wales, Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg (1719\u20131772) mother of King George the Third.", "Aufr\u00e8re returned to England early 1791 and set about preparations for his marriage. At St George's, Hanover Square, in the fashionable London district of Mayfair, on 19 February he married Countess of the Empire, Marianne Matilda Lockhart (10 October 1774 \u2013 14 September 1850), the only surviving daughter of General James Lockhart, of Lee and Carnwath in Lanarkshire, Scotland, who had been a general in the service of Empress Maria Theresa. The Empress had raised him to the dignity of a Baron of the Holy Roman Empire and had decorated him with military orders.  In his later years he had been attached to the household of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, and Lockhart had died in Pisa on 6 February 1790.His actual tomb is at Dryden, Scotland, and has the following inscription: 'James Lockhart Wishart, of Lee and Carnwath, Lord of the Bedchamber to his Imperial Majesty Joseph the Second, Emperor of Germany, Knight of the Order of Maria Teresa, Count of the Holy Roman Empire, and General of the Imperial, Royal, and Apostolical Armies, died at Pisa, in Italy, VIth February,  MDCCXC, in the LXIVth year of his age.' Marianne is also buried there. Aufr\u00e8re and Marianne had almost certainly met in Pisa in 1785 as his friend William Gunn had already been introduced to father and daughter and, as he wrote somewhat begrudgingly, it was expected of him to spend the evenings at the houses of the three English families there.Riviere (1965), op.cit. ", "After the marriage the Aufr\u00e8re family chose to live abroad in Heidelberg, Germany, possibly for financial reasons, and in the following year their daughter Louisa Anna Matilda (17 November 1792 \u2013 1868) was also born there. There is a letter of Aufr\u00e8re's to Gunn from Heidelberg dated 1 May 1793 but it is claimed that they had later moved to Mannheim, as his friend William Gunn and his family \u2013 returning from his second Grand Tour \u2013 met up with him there on 26 September, where they hired a barge and went sailing down the Rhine. In 1794 a son George Anthony (18 June 1794 \u2013 6 May 1881) was born.The daughter Louisa Anna Matilda later married in 1818 George Barclay (1790\u20131869), Esq., a merchant of New York, by whom she had a daughter Matilda Antonia Barclay (born in New York 7 December 1824 \u2013 1888) she married Francis Robert Rives (1822\u20131891) their son George Lockhart Rives later published the Genealogical Notes; and George Anthony married at Hamburg in 1828 Caroline Wehrtmann (died 1885), the second daughter of a Hamburg merchant, John Michael Wehrtmann, of Hamburg and of Osterrade in the Duchy of Holstein.
