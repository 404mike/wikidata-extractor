In the meantime, the rest of the party evaded a German patrol by moving to Patsos, just two hours away from Pantanassa.

Moss and Leigh Fermor rendezvoused with the rest of the abduction team at the hamlet of Karines and advanced to Fotinou and then Vilandredo. Once a 200-man German column came to Argygoupoli just an hour's distance from Vilandredo, Dennis Ciclitira and a band of ELAS fighters assisted the team in avoiding their pursuers. When the team reached Asi Gonia, a runner told them that a boat was going to pick them up at Rodakino beach on the night of 14 May. The Rodakiniot guerillas accompanied the team on their final trek. The team, Kreipe, two German prisoners of war and a sick Soviet prisoner of war boarded the SBS boats at 10:00\u00a0pm, concluding their mission by landing at Mersa Matruh in Egypt.
