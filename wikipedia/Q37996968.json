The first week of the January transfer window saw a high turnover of players with the loans of Sid Nelson, Olufela Olomola and Matt Worthington expiring while the loan of Keston Davies was terminated after he had failed to break into the Yeovil side. The four loans were replaced with Liverpool defender Corey Whelan, Barnsley midfielder Jared Bird, Middlesbrough attacking midfielder Lewis Wing and Southampton striker Marcus Barnes all joining the club on loan until the end of the season from their respective clubs. On 6 January, Yeovil faced League One side Bradford City in the third round of the FA Cup. Despite being the lowest ranked team left in the competition, Yeovil won the match 2\u20130 with a goal from Marcus Barnes on his debut and a third of the season from Jordan Green enough to see Yeovil through to the fourth round for only the fourth time in their history. Yeovil then faced Forest Green Rovers in the third round of the EFL Trophy, and secured back-to-back 2\u20130 wins with goals from Nathan and Connor Smith enough to secure qualification to the quarter-finals of the competition. Having established himself in the Yeovil team, attacker Jordan Green was rewarded with a new contract until the summer of 2019, while defender Tom James also signed an improved contract. On 13 January, Yeovil drew 1\u20131 away at relegation rivals Port Vale, with Fran\u00e7ois Zoko scoring his tenth goal of the season to give the Glovers the lead but they conceded in the final five minutes to drop two points. The following week saw the club confirm that they had received a \"substantial bid\" for winger Otis Khan which had met a release clause in his contract, and that there had also been interest in defender Omar Sowunmi. On 20 January, Yeovil faced Chesterfield in a relegation six-pointer, after falling behind against the run of play Lewis Wing equalised with a 25-yard looping shot, his first goal for the club. In the final minute of injury time after Otis Khan appeared to have his shirt pulled he stopped playing allowing Chestefield to go up the other end to score a late winner with Khan then being sent off for shoving referee Kevin Johnson. Yeovil appealed the decision to send the midfielder off, but the appeal was deemed frivolous and Khan's ban was subsequently extended to five matches.", "On 26 January, Yeovil faced Manchester United in the fourth round of the FA Cup in front of a sell out crowd of 9,195. Prior to the game Yeovil announced the signing of Alex Fisher on a free transfer from Scottish Premiership side Motherwell, with the striker signing an 18-month contract. The Glovers started the game brightly, but conceded just before half-time with Marcus Rashford giving the Premier League side the lead. During half-time the club confirmed the signing of Yeovil-born forward Ryan Seager on loan from Southampton until the end of the season. Ander Herrera extended Manchester United's lead after an hour before the superior quality of the Prmeier League side saw the Glovers concede two late goals to be knocked out of the FA Cup with a 4\u20130 defeat. The following day, the club confirmed their third signing of the weekend with West Bromwich Albion defender Shaun Donnellan, nephew of former Yeovil midfielder Gary, signing on an 18-month contract. Yeovil ended the month with a 3\u20130 victory over Grimsby Town with the visitors having been reduced to nine men, the Glovers ran out comfortable winners with goals from Lewis Wing, Rhys Browne and Jake Gray."]}, {"page": "2017\u201318 Middlesbrough F.C. season", "response": ["| 1 July 2017 || AM ||  || Lewis Wing || Shildon || Free || ", "|align=\"left\"| Lewis Wing"]}]}}
