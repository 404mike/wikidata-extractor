The Councils of the Church, The Byzantine legacy in the Orthodox Church by John Meyendorff \u2013 1982 where the Greek language was widely spoken and used for most theological writings. The empire's capital, Constantinople, was an early important center of Christianity, and its liturgical practices, traditions, and doctrines were gradually adopted throughout Eastern Orthodoxy, still providing the basic patterns of contemporary Orthodoxy.Hugh Wybrew, The Orthodox Liturgy: The Development of the Eucharistic Liturgy in the Byzantine Rite \u2013 1990The Christian Churches of the East, Vol. II: Churches Not in Communion with Rome, by Donald Attwater \u2013 1962J Meyendorff, Byzantine Theology: Historical Trends and Doctrinal Themes (1987) Thus, Eastern Orthodox came to be called \"Greek\" Orthodox in the same way that the Western Christians came to be called \"Roman\" Catholic.

Attila was allegedly so impressed with Lupus that he spared the city. Attila went on to lose the Battle of Ch\u00e2lons.

Donald Attwater writes that the tale of Lupus and Attila is hagiographical rather than historical.Attwater, Donald. The Penguin Dictionary of Saints,(1945) Reprint: 1981, p. 223.

The Maronite Church, however, rejects the assertions that the Maronites were ever monothelites and broke communion with Rome; and the question remains a matter of controversy.

Robert W. Crawford concluded the same, pointing out that the heretic \"Maro\" mentioned in the Annals, which William of Tyre considers as the namesake of the Maronites, was a Nestorian from Edessa and couldn't have been Maron or John Maron. However, Donald Attwater, 20th Century historian of Eastern Christianity, affirmed the view that Maronites broke communion with Rome over monothelitism, however briefly."]}]}}
