He funded schooling at the Press and the endowment of St. Barnabas Church in Oxford.Harry Carter, Wolvercote Mill ch. 4 (second edition, Oxford, 1974) Combe's wealth also extended to becoming the first patron of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, and he and his wife Martha bought most of the group's early work, including The Light of the World by William Holman Hunt.Jeremy Maas, Holman Hunt and the Light of the World (Scholar Press, 1974) Combe showed little interest, however, in producing fine printed work at the Press.Sutcliffe p. 6 The most well-known text associated with his print shop was the flawed first edition of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, printed by Oxford at the expense of its author Lewis Carroll (Charles Lutwidge Dodgson) in 1865.Sutcliffe p. 36"]}, {"page": "Times New Roman", "response": ["Morison described the companion italic as also being influenced by the typefaces created by the Didot family in the late 18th and early 19th centuries: a \"rationalistic italic that owed nothing to the tradition of the sixteenth or seventeenth centuries. It has, indeed, more in common with the eighteenth century.\" Morison had several years earlier attracted attention for promoting the radical idea that italics in book printing were too disruptive to the flow of text, and should be phased out. He rapidly came to concede that the idea was impractical, and later wryly commented to historian Harry Carter that Times' italic \"owes more to Didot than dogma.\" Morison wrote in a personal letter of Times New Roman's mixed heritage that it \"has the merit of not looking as if it had been designed by somebody in particular.\"", "A number of early reviews of Times New Roman were published in Morison's lifetime that discussed aspects of its design. Most were appreciative (Morison was an influential figure in publishing) but several noted that it did not follow conventional expectations of newspaper typeface design. One article that discussed its design was Optical Scale in Typefounding, written by Harry Carter and published in 1937, which discussed the differences between small and large-size typeface designs. He commented \"The small sizes of Plantin embody what are supposed to be the requirements of a good small type [but] Times Roman, which most people find the easiest to read of small text-types, runs counter to some of them...[Morison] avoided blunt serifs and thickened hairlines because he found they wore down more noticeably than sharper-cut features.\""]}, {"page": "Serif", "response": ["* Harry Carter, A View of Early Typography: Up to about 1600 (London: Hyphen Press, 2002)."]}, {"page": "Garamond", "response": ["Plantin's collection of original Garamond punches and matrices survives at the Plantin-Moretus Museum in Antwerp, together with many other typefaces collected by Plantin from other typefounders of the period.

The capital letters were upright capitals on the model of Roman square capitals, shorter than the ascending lower-case italic letters, and were used at the start of each line followed by a clear space before the first lower-case letter. While modern italics are often more condensed than roman types, historian Harry Carter describes Manutius' italic as about the same width as roman type. To replicate handwriting, Griffo cut at least sixty-five tied letters (ligatures) in the Aldine Dante and Virgil of 1501.

He also suggested that some condensed typefaces made by Kis and sold to the Ducal printing establishment in Florence might have made for a more authentic model. Printing historian James Mosley's review of Morison's memoir, A Tally of Types, described the original metal type as \"crudely drawn\" compared with some earlier Monotype designs, and suggested that this was due to a change in works management at Monotype with the retirement of head engineer Frank Hinman Pierpont."]}, {"page": "Joan Micha\u00ebl Fleischman", "response": ["Fleischman was unable to continue the type foundry on his own, and Rudolf Wetstein ran the business for him, while he continued to work for him as a punchcutter.

Ensched\u00e9, which remained operational until 1990. Fleischman continued to live in Amsterdam and made fonts for Ensched\u00e9 as well as other Amsterdam businesses.
