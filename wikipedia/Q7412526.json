Collected from the few remaining documents which have escaped the ravages of time, as well as from actual observation (Longmans, London, 1810). Initially it had not been unusual for religious houses in possession of rectories also to assume the capability to collect tithe and glebe income for themselves, but this practice was banned by the decrees of the Lateran Council of 1215. Thereafter, over the mediaeval period, monasteries and priories continually sought papal exemption from the Council's decrees, so as to appropriate the income of rectoral benefices to their own use. However, from the thirteenth century onwards, diocesan bishops successfully established the principle that only the glebe and \"greater tithes\" of grain, hay and wood could be appropriated by monastic patrons in this manner; the \"lesser tithes\" had to remain within the parochial benefice; the incumbent of which thenceforward carried the title of \"vicar\"; David Knowles, The Religious Orders in England, Vol II (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1955), p.290. and any remaining priests of the clas and their abod were presumably expelled. If one accepts the evidence of the inquisition taken before Rhys ap Gruffydd, lieutenant of the Justiciar, at Llanfihangel Genau'r Glyn, 1 September 1326 (which conflicts with Gerald's account), as early as 1212 there were apparently only two monks (from St Peter's, Gloucester) in residence.Frank Lewis, \"The history of Llanbadarn Fawr, Cardiganshire in the later middle ages\" (1938) 13 Transaction and archaeological record: Cardiganshire Antiquarian Society 15\u201340 at pp. 17\u201318. However, it is difficult to see how they can have remained, in light of Welsh control of the area; possibly they had only arrived in 1211; we don't know whether there was a priest resident (one of the monks might have been a priest).", "Whenever it occurred, the long succession of monks and priests living a corporate (not necessarily monastic) life in the clas, priory and finally college of priests was finally at an end, after many hundreds of years. However, as Nora K. Chadwick has observed: \"clerics of Llanbadarn seem to have retained their vitality and intellectual activity down to the fifteenth century\". In 1508 a visitation of Vale Royal Abbey by the Abbot of Dore referred to the church and lordship of Llanbadarn Fawr,\"State of the monastery of Vale Royal (Cheshire) at the visitation by the Abbot of Dore (Herefordshire), 16 March 1508/9\" (National Archives, E 135/3/16). Dore was the mother house of Vale Royal. The term \"Lordship\" is probably to be taken to refer to the manor of Llanbadarn Fawr, later held by both the Pryses of Gogerddan and the Powells of Nanteos. By the early nineteenth century the name of the manor had been corrupted from Llanbadarn Fawr to Y Vaenor. There are other manors in the parish, including a small manor of Rhydonnen, and Crown manors such as Creuddyn; Sir Samuel Rush Meyrick, The History and Antiquities of the county of Cardigan.

By 1660 the tithes belonged to Roger Palmer (1634\u20131705), who became earl of Castlemaine by virtue of his wife Barbara (n\u00e9e Villiers) being the mistress of Charles II. Since Castlemaine did not acknowledge Barbara's five children by Charles (and perhaps other lovers) the tithes of Llanbadarn passed to his nephew James. His daughter Catherine married Giles Chichester of Arlington Court, Devon. They were both Catholics, which forced them to pay heavy taxes.This section owes much to Gerald Morgan; Gerald Morgan, Ceredigion: A wealth of History (Gower, Llandysul, 2005). See Sir Alexander Bruce Palmer Chichester, Bart., History of the Family of Chichester from AD 1086 to 1870 (printed for the author, J.C. Hotten, 1871). Not all subsequent members of the Chichester family were absentees, however; Sir John Chichester, 1st Baronet, of Arlington Court, was High Sheriff of Cardiganshire in 1831, when he was living in Llanbadarn Fawr. But the income was lost to the church.In the time of King James I, in \"Sir Richard Price, Knt. v.

The Pryses appear to have acquired an interest in the manor by 1640, as in that year Richard Pryse and Lewis Evans (the same to whom was assigned the manor in 1635), by deed poll, released the equity of redemption in a mortgage on the manor; Calendar of Deeds and Documents, D.D.111, p. 26.

Whether it actually came from the Abbey is uncertain.According to Meyrick the style is similar to one which was in vogue in the beginning of the twelfth century, and an example may be seen in Llandaff Cathedral, erected by Bishop Urban in 1120. A similar piece was found in Abbey Cwmhir; Sir Samuel Rush Meyrick, History and Antiquities of the County of Cardigan. Collected from the few remaining documents which have escaped the ravages of time, as well as from actual observation (Longmans, London, 1810). A more probable date is thirteenth century, given its syle. Strata Florida Abbey was founded in 1164 and was consecrated in 1201.The name Strata Florida is a corruption of the Welsh Ystrad Fflur, and has a double meaning; \"Valley of (the river of) Flowers\". Ystrad corrupts into \"Strata\", while Fflur (\"Flowers\") is also the name of the nearby river. The arch is exceptionally ornate, indeed the finest such work in the county. It has three deeply moulded shafts each triple-roll with keel to centre roll and stiff-leaf capitals and matching triple mouldings to the pointed arch, with hoodmould. There is no evidence, archaeological or documentary, that it came from Strata Florida, or indeed anywhere else.", "There were still fine mediaeval screens in the church in 1810, possibly lost when repairs were done in 1813\u201316; they were gone by 1862.Thomas Lloyd, Julian Orbach and Robert Scourfield, Carmarthenshire and Ceredigion Pevsner architectural guides, Volume 6 of The buildings of Wales (Yale University Press, London and New Haven, 2006), p. 496. According to the History and Antiquities of the County of Cardigan (1810) by Sir Samuel Rush Meyrick: The chancel and north transept are separated from the rest of the church by light and elegant carved screens, which, from the elaborate workmanship they display, were probably erected about the time of Henry the Seventh.

The whole churchyard and church is surrounded by what was once a typical sign of an early Celtic church; an oval formation of trees.Some of the trees are certified as being over 500 years old. There are also indications which suggest the remains of an early pond, probably for keeping fish for the priests and monks who once lived there. There is no visible trace of any conventual buildings (which would probably have been mostly relatively slight wooden structures, and never extensive). In the early nineteenth century Meyrick does however record the survival of what appeared to be stone monastic or church buildings.\"On the north side of the church the buildings were, probably, a part of the old monastery, a pointed arch, and other circumstances in them, indicating great antiquity\"; Sir Samuel Rush Meyrick, The History and Antiquities of the county of Cardigan.

Though generally remaining true to their spirit, he reduces the role of the supernatural in these stories.  The narrative structure of Elphin is based on three ancient tales: the inundation of Gwythno's kingdom through the negligence of Seithenyn, the birth and prophecies of Taliesin, and the abduction of Gwenyvar by Melvas.  The first of these tales is told in a poem in the Black Book of Carmarthen, but was also available to Peacock in two English language sources, Samuel Rush Meyrick's History and Antiquities of Cardigan (1806) and T. J. Llewelyn Prichard's poem The Land Beneath the Sea (1824).  The Taliesin story is told in the Hanes Taliesin.

Peacock's version of the story of Arthur, Gwenyvar and Melvas derives ultimately from the 12th-century Latin Vita Gildae by Caradoc of Llancarfan, probably via Joseph Ritson's Life of King Arthur (1825).  The poems scattered through Elphin are for the most part translated or imitated from originals published in Owen Jones's Myvyrian Archaiology (1801\u20131807).  The Welsh triads Peacock quoted were available to him in translation in a journal called The Cambro-Briton (1819\u20131822), one of the major sources of his novella.  The extended description of Caerleon owes much to Richard Colt Hoare's 1806 translation of Gerald of Wales's Itinerarium Cambriae and Descriptio Cambriae, but other topographical descriptions draw on Thomas Evans's Cambrian Itinerary and, probably, on Peacock's own memories of his various Welsh holidays."]}, {"page": "Meyrick", "response": ["* Samuel Rush Meyrick (1783\u20131848), English inventor"]}, {"page": "Goodrich Court", "response": ["Goodrich Court, Goodrich, Herefordshire, England was a 19th-century, neo-gothic castle built by the antiquarian Sir Samuel Rush Meyrick in 1828.
