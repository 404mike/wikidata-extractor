He was particularly interested in ornithology and entomology.\nHe made his first expedition to Japan in 1864, and the ornithological results were published in the Ibis. Later he collected birds in Peru, in Amazonia, and in British Guiana, \nwhere he resided mostly. \nAmong his bird discoveries are: Oreonympha nobilis Gould, Lophornis pavoninus Salvin, Hylocharis guianensis Boucard, Uranomitra whitelyi Boucard, Amazilia cupreicauda Salvin Aglaeactis caumatonata Gould, Iolaema whitelyana Gould, Hemistephania guianensis Boucard, Milornis rupuninii Boucard and Eretnita whitelyi Boucard. \nBesides bird skins he also made large collections of insects, chiefly Coleoptera and Lepidoptera, among which were many new species.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bearded mountaineer", "response": ["The ornithologist John Gould described the species in 1869, from a specimen collected by Henry Whitely at Tinta District, and placed it in its own genus Oreonympha. He recognised a kinship with Oxypogon and Ramphomicron. A study of mitochondrial DNA of hummingbirds shows it to be most closely related to the bearded helmetcrest (Oxypogon guerinii) and the rufous-capped thornbill (Chalcostigma ruficeps). The other member of the genus Chalcostigma lay outside the group, suggesting the genus might need revising in the future. Two subspecies are recognised - the more widespread nominate subspecies nobilis has a blue eyebrow, while the more restricted albolimbata has white."]}, {"page": "List of natural history dealers", "response": ["*Henry Whitely"]}, {"page": "Henry Whitely", "response": ["Henry Whitely was a businessman, railroad executive, and Federalist politician from the U.S. state of Delaware."]}, {"page": "1885 in birding and ornithology", "response": ["*Osbert Salvin A List of the Birds obtained by Mr. Henry Whitely in British Guiana.Ibis 1885 3 (5) :291-306 online"]}]}}
