He won Blues both before and after the First World War and proved his all round sporting talent by also gaining Blues in hockey and rugby.  He made his debut for Kent in 1919, winning his cap in 1920, and played for the county until 1927.  He turned down an invitation to tour Australia in 1920/21 but played for the amateur team led by Archie MacLaren which defeated the Australians in 1921.\nHe also appeared in matches for Marylebone Cricket Club from 1924 to 1932, and, with a smattering of matches for L Robinson's XI (1913-1921), the Gentlemen (1920-1932), South of England (1920), Free Foresters (1921-1928), England XI (1921),  CI Thornton's XI (1921), The Rest of England (1923) and HDG Leveson-Gower's XI (1936) made 101 first-class appearances in all.  A right-handed lower order batsman, promoted on occasion to open. his only first-class century, 128, came against Free Foresters.\nHis three tests were played against the touring South Africans in 1924.   The first was the remarkable match at Edgbaston in June which saw South Africa bowled out for just 30 in reply to England's imposing 438.  The tourists rallied in their second innings, posting 390, to lose by an innings and 18 runs in the three day match.  Batting at number 10, Wood contributed just a single on debut before being bowled by Parker, and caught Dave Nourse from the bowling of Arthur Gilligan when South Africa followed on.   England won the second Test at Lords by exactly the same margin, thanks to a double century by Jack Hobbs and centuries from Sutcliffe and Woolley.  Wood caught South Africa's captain Herbie Taylor for 4, again from the bowling of Gilligan.  Wood's last Test match was the third in the series, played at Headingley in July, which England again won in convincing style.   Although run out for just 6, Wood took 3 catches and completed a stumping as England ran out winners by 9 wickets.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Wood", "response": ["George Wood may refer to:", "* George Wood (British Army officer) (1898\u20131982), during World War II", "* George Wood (died 1558), MP for Flintshire", "* George Wood (judge) (1743\u20131824), English lawyer and politician", "* George Wood (Canadian politician) (1888\u20131966), member of Parliament, Brant, Ontario", "* George Wood (New Zealand politician) (born 1946), former mayor of North Shore City, Auckland, New Zealand", "* George Wood (baseball) (1858\u20131924), left fielder in Major League Baseball, 1880\u20131892", "* George Wood (Somerset cricketer) (1865\u20131948), first-class cricketer who played three matches in 1893 and 1894", "* George Wood (Yorkshire cricketer) (1862\u20131948), first-class cricketer who played two matches for Yorkshire", "* George Wood (cricketer, born 1893) (1893\u20131971), English cricketer", "* George Wood (footballer) (born 1952), Scottish footballer", "* George Wood (gymnast) (born 1999), British acrobatic gymnast", "* Wee Georgie Wood (1894\u20131979), stage name of George Wood Bamlett, English actor", "* George Wood (actor) (born 1981), English actor", "* George Wood (Radio Sweden) (born 1949), American journalist", "* George Wood, founder of Wawa Food Markets", "*George Woods (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "Kent County Cricket Club", "response": ["Other than Ames and Knott, Kent has produced a number of other top class wicket-keepers.Billings keen to match the Kent keeper kings, Canterbury Times, 2014-04-17.
