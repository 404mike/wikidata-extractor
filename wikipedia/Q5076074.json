At the time, (1831) he became the Champion of the Thames which was effectively the Champion of England although the Tyne scullers might have disagreed. See Also English Sculling Championship. After the English title gained the world status in 1876, earlier winners were retrospectively given the World Champion Title.\nCampbell was born in 1805 at Lambeth. During his racing career he was stated to be 5 ft 7 in tall, and weighed 11 st 7 lb. His races included pair and four oar events as well as single sculls.", "link_mentions": {}}}
