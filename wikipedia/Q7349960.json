At the end of January, his protestations that he had been misunderstood led to his being re-employed from 1 March 1866.Brown 2003, p. 47.

Both the Controller Vice-Admiral Sir Robert Spencer Robinson and the Chief Constructor Edward James Reed raised serious concerns. Robinson noted that the low freeboard could cause flooding issues on the gun deck, and Reed criticised the design in 1866 both for being too heavy and for having too high a centre of gravity. On the latter, Reed noted that it would cause issues \"especially as it is proposed to spread a large surface of canvas upon the Captain\".Hawkey, Arthur: HMS Captain. G.
