He was born at Tonge Moor, Bolton, Lancashire, England.Tattersall had an unusual style, quite different from the orthodox Jim Laker, who kept him out of a Test place for most of his career. Tattersall held his index finger around the seam of the ball and this allowed him to bowl a carefully disguised away-swinger to supplement his sharp off-break. He was rather faster than Laker, and this served to increase his penetration on the many wet wickets of his home county. Of small account as a batsman, he did nonetheless help Reg Simpson in a tenth wicket stand of 74 which helped to give England its first victory over Australia since their record win at The Oval in 1938.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 17", "response": ["*1922 \u2013 Roy Tattersall, English cricketer (d. 2011)"]}, {"page": "Lancashire County Cricket Club", "response": ["When play began in 1946, after World War II, things started badly for Lancashire when the captain and veteran player, Jack Iddon, was killed in a car accident just before the start of the season.

As he developed greater strength, he increased his pace from fast-medium to genuine fast. He took 97 wickets at the good low average of 15.11 in 1951 and played in two of the Tests against South Africa, taking four wickets in all.

Playfair noted that Lancashire had slipped from third to tenth in the championship but blamed the weather which ruined eleven of their matches.

Berry was known for flight and spin, but was also inclined to be more expensive than Hilton. Nonetheless, it was Berry who was picked for the 1950\u201351 Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) tour to Australia and New Zealand under Freddie Brown.

That season, however, he took 66 wickets for less than eighteen runs apiece, and formed a remarkable trio of spinners with Roy Tattersall and Malcolm Hilton. In 1957, however, Greenhough seemed to lack spin and in 1958 played only eight games out of twenty eight for the first eleven. It was thus a surprise that, in the dry summer of 1959, Greenhough was able to not only displace both Tattersall and Hilton, but even leap into the Test side against India. Although he did well even when India's lack of batting prowess was taken into account, Greenhough was soon reported for persistently running down the pitch during his follow-through.Preston, Norman (editor); Wisden Cricketers\u2019 Almanac; Ninety-Seventh Edition (1960); p. 448 Once Greenhough corrected this problem he bowled as well as before.

In this they were not helped by the hole left in English cricket by the Second World War, but only three players (Godfrey Evans, Trevor Bailey and Reg Simpson) were aged between 26 and 31 and could be said to be at their prime; nine of the players were 32 or more and six 26 or less.p70, Swanton The captain Freddie Brown had last toured Australia in 1932-33 with Douglas Jardine and Len Hutton, Cyril Washbrook, Denis Compton, Doug Wright, Alec Bedser and Godfrey Evans in 1946-47 under Wally Hammond; the rest of the team had never travelled down under. Bill Edrich who had made a gutsy 462 runs (46.20) in 1946-47 and would tour Australia again in 1954-55, but was out of favour at Lord's (he was being divorced, and such things counted in the 1950s) and had had an injury-struck season. The two biggest wicket-takers of 1950 were the top spinners Jim Laker and Johnny Wardle.p69, Swanton Laker had taken an astounding 8/2 in the 1950 Bradford Test Trial, but his brand of off-spin was deemed too slow for the hard Australian pitches and he was not chosen for the 1954-55 tour either.p146, Andrew Ward, Cricket's Strangest Matches, Robson Books, 2001 In the 1956 Ashes series he took 46 wickets (9.60) including 19/90 at Old Trafford and when he finally toured Australia in 1958-59 he took 15 wickets (21.20). The Yorkshireman Johnny Wardle was also left behind, but would finish with 102 Test wickets (20.39) with his combination of Slow Left Arm bowling and Chinamen. To be fair to the selectors Laker had only taken 32 Test wickets (37.34) at the time and Wardle just 2 (56.50). The MCC were committed to a youth policy that consistently failed them. In 1950 they relied overly on young undergraduates from Cambridge University and had lost 3-1 to the West Indies as a result. A continuation of this policy was unlikely to succeed in Australia, but John Dewes, David Sheppard and John Warr were chosen for the tour along with the young professionals Brian Close, Gilbert Parkhouse and Bob Berry. They all failed when faced with real class and only served to increase the burden on the senior players. Remembering his torrid time in 1946-47 Cyril Washbrook declined to tour when selected, but was later flown out with Roy Tattersall and Brian Statham. Washbrook's fears were full realised, Tattersall failed and Statham would not make his Test debut until the party reached New Zealand. Freddie Brown was the selector's third choice to lead the tour, after Norman Yardley of Yorkshire and George Mann of Middlesex both declined the job and he was only chosen as Lord's was determined to have an amateur captain. It was a thankless job as even with the retirement of the great Don Bradman it was clear that Australia were the stronger team and would be hard to beat on their own ground. They had defeated Wally Hammond 3-0 in 1946-47 and Yardley 4-0 in 1948 and England had not won a Test against them in twelve years.pp22-26, pp214-228, Fingletonp402, Colin Frith, Pageant of Cricket, Macmillan Company of Australia, 1987pp9-12, O'Reilly", "Alec Bedser dominated the England bowling (and the Australian batsmen) as much as Len Hutton did the batting and by the end of the tour the Australians rated him the best new-ball bowler in the world.p13, Kay He sent down almost twice as many overs as anybody else in the Tests and took 30 wickets (16.06), including 10/105 in England's final victory at Melbourne. Bedser carried the England bowling on his broad back against in the 1940s and 1950s with a long list of short-term new-ball partners. His huge hands and powerful shoulders allowed him to bowl a lethal combination of in-swingers and leg-cutters off a short run-up and only Keith Miller - briefly - was able to cut loose from his control. In 1950-51 series he did have the support of his captain Freddie Brown, another big medium paced bowler, who surprised everybody by taking 18 wickets (21.61) despite celebrating his 40th birthday on the tour. There was also Trevor Bailey who took 14 wickets (14.14) with his naggingly accurate out-swingers that mirrored his monotonous batting as he settled on containing batsmen, but could be dangerous in the right conditions. After these three the quality of the England bowling dropped dramatically, for which the selectors must bear the brunt of the blame. Doug Wright was a mercurial leg-spinner who the MCC liked sent on tour instead of Jim Laker because he was more suited to the harder wickets abroad. He was potential match-winner, but he liked to buy his wickets and asking him to bowl was always a gamble as he could equally snap up a few quick wickets, concede a slew of runs, or both.pp22-23, Kay Eric Hollies bowled one of the most famous balls in cricket when his googly dismissed Don Bradman for a duck in his last Test innings, but the Warwickshire leg-spinner was not a great turner of the ball, instead relying on line and length.

John Warr quickly proved himself to be the worst player in the team, he took only one test wicket - for 281 runs - when Ian Johnson walked after the umpire declined to give him out, an almost unheard of practice in Australia at the time. He improved his game during the tour, but was never more than a decent county bowler.pp21-22, Kay Let loose from the hard life at Yorkshire and the Army Brian Close was undisciplined and failed on a tour for which he should not have been chosen."]}, {"page": "1952 English cricket season", "response": [" || Roy Tattersall ||align=\"right\"| 6995 ||align=\"right\"| 409 ||align=\"right\"| 2586 ||align=\"right\"| 146 || 17.71"]}, {"page": "1953 English cricket season", "response": [" || Roy Tattersall ||align=\"right\"| 7086 ||align=\"right\"| 348 ||align=\"right\"| 2974 ||align=\"right\"| 164 || 18.13"]}, {"page": "Playfair Cricket Annual", "response": ["* 1951: Godfrey Evans, Laurie Fishlock, Ken Grieves, Gilbert Parkhouse, Sonny Ramadhin, David Sheppard, Roy Tattersall, Alf Valentine, Everton Weekes, Frank Worrell, Doug Wright"]}, {"page": "Jim Hilton", "response": ["The younger brother of England and Lancashire bowler Malcolm Hilton, Jim Hilton was a lower-order right-handed batsman and a right-arm off-break bowler.

Having livened up the crowd the bowlers had a tough day as the Adelaide Oval was up to its usual standards. Arthur Morris batted a very careful and composed innings, the highest of his Test career as he laid his reputation as \"Bedser's Bunny\" to rest.

Thereafter wickets fell sharply, the last five falling for 14 runs, and the innings ended when he was bowled by Roy Tattersall (3/95). The young Lancashire off-spinner had an impressive debut which justified his selection even though he had to borrow E.W. Swanton's boots because his feet had swollen on the flight. He began by conceding only 5 runs from his first 6 overs and spun the ball so much that it floated across the wicket before turning on the unhelpful wicket. He dismissed fellow debutant Jim Burke with a ball that he bowled at the leg stump so that Burke went down on one knee to sweep it, but it floated over the wicket and knocked over the off-stump. He also bowled Don Tallon, getting his three wickets without any help from the fielders.

Doug Wright took 4/99 and only Morris, a noted player of spinners, was able to master him, but John Warr (0/63) could still not take a wicket.pp174-178, Fingletonpp200-205, Kaypp103-107, O'Reilly", "England's innings \u2013 like Australia's \u2013 revolved around their opener, in this case Len Hutton, who became the second Englishman to carry his bat through an innings against Australia, the other being Bobby Abel's 132 not out at Sydney in 1891\u201392. Hutton made 156 not out in England's 272, hit 11 fours and nobody else made 30. Ray Lindwall (3/51) dismissed Cyril Washbrook for 2 when the pedestrian Jack Iverson took a high, leaping catch when the batsmen heaved the ball to the leg-side. The spinners were soon on and Hutton hit Ian Johnson for two boundaries. He went two yards down the wicket and was almost stumped by Don Tallon for 34, but he nicked the ball and the deflection made Tallon miss both the catch and the stumping. Reg Simpson was the second highest scorer with 29 and together they added 83 for the second wicket before Simpson was bowled by the left-arm bowler Bill Johnston and England finished the day 96/2. The following morning Lindwall and Miller argued with Tallon that he ought to stand three yards closer to the stumps as the pitch was so slow. He refused and Lindwall bowled at a reduced pace, so nudged by Miller Tallon moved up for the third ball, which nicked Denis Compton's bat and the keeper took the catch low off the ground. Had he remained back Tallon could not have made the catch. The other England batsmen made a steady procession to and from the wicket as Bill Johnston (3/68) and Iverson (3/58) worked their way through the order as Hutton batted serenely on, now untouchable by any of the bowlers. David Sheppard almost ran Hutton out when he rushed down the wicket to get off the mark, Godfrey Evans tried to do the same, but Hutton wisely ignored him and the keeper scrambled back before his wicket was wrecked by Lindwall. Freddie Brown was caught leg before by Miller (1/30), who immediately appealed and Umpire Cocks gave him out, then the ball rolled back onto his stumps and knocked off a bail, so he ended up being bowled. Debutant Roy Tattersall was crowded by the Australian fielders and was caught by Neil Harvey off Iverson for a duck. John Warr was bowled for another duck by Bill Johnston. Doug Wright came in at 219/9 and held off the Australian attack for over an hour as he and Hutton added 53 for the last wicket, resembling their last stand at Brisbane. Lindwall wasn't recalled to the attack until after 5 o'clock and promptly caught the Kent spinner leg before wicket for 14. England were out for 272, 99 runs behind Australia and Hutton was applauded off the field by the Australian team.pp174-183, Fingletonpp205-207, Kaypp107-114, O'Reilly", "Australia now had three and a half days to set England an unreachable target and bowl them out. Ken Archer ran a four off Alec Bedser in the first over and Arthur Morris struck two boundaries off Doug Wright when he replaced John Warr in the sixth over. Archer called Morris for a run off Bedser, but they both hesitated in the middle and Morris was run out for 16 by a left-handed throw from David Sheppard. Lindsay Hassett was almost bowled first ball, but survived and Australia were 34/1 at stumps. Archer (32) and Hassett (31) returned in the morning to take the score along to 95/3, but it was Neil Harvey (68), Keith Miller (99) and debutant Jim Burke (101 not out) who put the match beyond doubt. Harvey and Miller ran the bowling ragged and added 99 for the fourth wicket until Harvey was bowled by Brown (1/14) and Miller chopped a ball from Wright onto his stumps. Doug Wright (2/109) and Roy Tattersall (1/116) were heavily punished and Bedser (0/62) was wicketless. Australia ended the fourth day 384 runs ahead and that evening Freddie Brown and Brigadier Green were hospitalised after a car crash returning from dinner with Sir Willoughby Norrie, the Governor of South Australia. A car had pulled out suddenly from a side street and Brown swerved into a post for holding electric tram lines. Brown left the hospital early in the morning, but was unfit to play and vice-captain Denis Compton became the first professional captain to lead England since Jack Hobbs when Arthur Carr was injured in 1924\u201325.p185, O'Reilly He was unable to prevent Jim Burke from making a Test century on debut, the ninth Australian to do so (compared to 10 Englishmen at the time). John Warr took his first and only Test wicket when Ian Johnson cut the ball to Evans, who knocked it up on the first attempt then ran forward to catch it on the rebound. Umpire Cocks took so long to make a decision that Johnson walked (almost unheard in Australia) to give the long-suffering Warr his first Test wicket and a bowling average of 281.00, the highest by an England bowler. The 12th man Sam Loxton was sent out by Hassett to tell Burke that he could take all the time he wanted over his hundred and the dour stock clerk reached his target after 245\u00a0minutes at the crease. Hassett then declared at 403/8 to give England a day and a half to make 503 to win.pp183-187, Fingletonpp207-208, Kaypp114-118, O'Reilly", "No team has ever made 500 runs to win a Test, though Len Hutton and Doug Wright had played in the Timeless Test when England made 654/5 chasing 696 to win, but drew the match because they had to catch their boat home. Realistically England could only hope to draw and Len Hutton (45) and Cyril Washbrook (31) added 74 for the first wicket, the highest opening stand of the series. Bill Johnston (4/73) removed them both, Hutton taken by Sam Loxton at short-leg (substituting for Iverson, who twisted his ankle on the ball), who also caught Denis Compton for a duck. In between he had Washbrook lbw and England entered the last day on 114/3. Reg Simpson (61) and David Sheppard (41) batted out the morning in a stand of 91 that lasted 157\u00a0minutes. He was also out to Johnston, caught Burke and Miller (3/27) snapped up Godfrey Evans, Alec Bedser and Sheppard for 7 runs to leave them 228/7. Ian Johnson (2/63) had Roy Tattersall caught by Arthur Morris then bowled John Warr without a run being added and as Freddie Brown was absent injured England were out one hour and forty minutes from stumps on the sixth and last day.pp187-188, Fingletonpp208-209, Kaypp118-121, O'Reilly", "Jim Burke provided the customary early wicket to fall, caught by Roy Tattersall at forward short-leg off Alec Bedser after he swopped ends with Trevor Bailey.

They were barracked heavily by the small crowd of 7,000 (in a stadium capable of holding 80,000) who wanted them to make way for the strokemakers Neil Harvey and Keith Miller. Their quality only became apparent when Morris was lbw to Brown at 111/2, closely followed by Harvey caught behind on 114/3 and Miller caught-and-bowled on 123/4 to give the England captain a spell of 3/0. The crowd increased to 20,000 as news of the England success traveled during the day and people came into see the fun. Hassett continued to hold the innings together, but Bedser worked his way through the line-up, bowling Graeme Hole and catching Ian Johnson lbw. Len Hutton took an excellent catch off Brown to dismiss the Australian captain 8 runs short of his century and another off Bedser to dispose of Don Tallon. Ray Lindwall (21) and Bill Johnston (12 not out) led a small fight back to get Australia from 187/8 to 206/8 at stumps and not for the first time England had the advantage on the first day. The injury-prone Trevor Bailey had fallen heavily when bowling and an X-ray over the weekend found that he had chipped a bone in his foot, but he came back to play. The second day was lost to heavy rain and fears of another Brisbane-like sticky rose, but the pitch dried out on the Sunday and flattened out nicely when pressed by the big electric roller on the Monday. Bedser (5/46) had Lindwall caught by Compton in second slip and Brown (5/49) had Iverson caught by Washbrook in the covers and the Australian innings closed on 217. It was Brown's best bowling and his only five-wicket haul in Tests.pp190-196, Fingletonpp221-225, Kaypp130-134, O'Reilly", "The old firm of Hutton and Washbrook opened for England and added 40 runs in 32\u00a0minutes for the first wicket before Washbrook tickled a ball from Keith Miller into the gloves of Don Tallon. Brown thought that if the Australian bowling was attacked they would buckle under and England would get more runs, in any case Hutton hit 8 boundaries in his 79 and added 131 runs with Reg Simpson in 142\u00a0minutes, the only century stand of the series for England . With Hutton in fine form the Notts opener was able to play himself in and at 171/1 the English batsmen were in finally in control. In desperation Hassett brought on debutant Graeme Hole to try out his off-spinners and to everyone's surprise his fourth ball clean bowled the England opener and the Australian bowling attack took an interest in affairs again. Lindwall (3/77) and Miller (4/76) bowled with greater speed and hostility than at any time in the series and by stumps England were 218/6 with Compton, Sheppard, Brown and Evans all gone and Simpson (80 not out) left with Alec Bedser (3 not out). Lindwall bowled Bedser for 11 and Jack Iverson (2/40) disposed of Trevor Bailey and Doug Wright to bring last man Roy Tattersall in at 246/9 with England just 18 runs ahead. With Simpson on 92 the main concern was whether he would reach 100 on this his 31st birthday, but this was soon resolved when he hit 11 runs off his next over from Miller. Hassett spread out the field to allow Simpson to take singles so they could concentrate on Tattersall, who was surrounded with close fielders. The young Lancastrian kept a straight bat and Simpson cracked 6 fours as they hit 50 runs in the 34\u00a0minutes before lunch. Miller bowled Tattersall for 10 after the break and Simpson was left on 156 not out, his highest score in Tests and his greatest Test innings. Their stand added 74 runs in 55\u00a0minutes and took England to 320, their only score of the series over 300, and a lead of 103 runs.pp196-202, Fingletonp225-230, Kaypp134-143, O'Reilly"]}, {"page": "MCC tour of Australia in 1950\u201351", "response": ["I suppose the day is not far distant when the players will also fly out to Australia, and this can be done in a week or even less, as evidenced by the experiences of Cyril Washbrook, Roy Tattersall and Brian Statham, who left home one week and were in Australia the next.", "Brian Statham and Roy Tattersall had just arrived from snowbound Lancashire and were thrown into this minor game to get their first cricket since September.
