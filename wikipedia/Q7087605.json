In the book, Bellamy said he suffered severe bouts of depression, particularly when he was unable to play football for long periods due to injury. He wrote, \"There would be weeks, sometimes months, when I couldn't get myself out of it\". These periods often coincided with periods of binge drinking; after Cardiff's defeat to Reading in the playoff semi-final, Bellamy went on a \"two-day drinking binge\". In 2013, he failed to declare himself as the driver of a car that was caught by a speed camera and received a driving ban. In March 2019, he was banned from driving again for 18 months after being found to be over the permitted alcohol limit while driving in Cardiff earlier that month. Bellamy is an advocate of mixed martial arts and has sponsored some of the fighters who train at Tillery Combat, a gym in Abertillery, Wales, providing them with supplements, kit and management advice through his company Shin2Chin.
