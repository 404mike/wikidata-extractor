He started his career at Derby County in 1998, but instead made his name at Port Vale following his transfer to Vale Park in 2000. He made 140 appearances in four years, scoring 36 goals in all competitions, and lifting the Football League Trophy in 2001. He spent the 2004\u201305 season with Stockport County, before signing with Bradford City in 2005. He spent two years at Bradford, making 95 a total of appearances. He signed with Carlisle United in 2007, and went on to pick up a Football League Trophy runners-up medal with the club in 2010. After four years with Carlisle, he joined Darlington in 2011, breaking his run of ten consecutive seasons in the third tier of English football. With Darlington he lifted the FA Trophy in 2011, before his contract was terminated in January 2012. He was re-signed to Darlington on a non-contract basis until the club folded in the summer of 2012.

He was replaced by former player Brian Horton, who spent big to secure the club's second consecutive final-day escape from relegation. There was no avoiding relegation in 1999\u20132000, though, as they were some thirteen points short of safety. Horton led the club to League Trophy success in 2001, as Marc Bridge-Wilkinson and Steve Brooker scored the goals to secure a 2\u20131 victory over Brentford in the final at the Millennium Stadium.

Following the end of the season, Foyle aimed to keep players at the club, but eventually lost top scorer Stephen McPhee and midfielder Marc Bridge-Wilkinson. The club also had to make massive cut backs due to having just come out of administration and when Steve Brooker (a player signed by Horton on Foyle's recommendation) was sold to Bristol City any chance of a play-off push was unlikely. Vale eventually finished 17th in a frustrating season where many players suffered injuries leaving the squad threadbare on more than one occasion. The next two seasons saw an increase in the playing budget as Vale got their house in order after administration and Foyle steered the side to 13th and 12th-place finishes in League One. Two cup runs to the 4th round of the FA Cup in 2005\u201306 and 4th round of the League Cup in 2006\u201307, coupled with the selling of players such as Chris Birchall and Billy Paynter saw the club make a profit on the financial front.

Two weeks later he scored his first Bradford goals by netting twice against his former club Crewe in a 3\u20130 Bradford victory.
