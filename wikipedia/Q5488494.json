His first international selection came in the form of a last-minute call-up when Frank Monk and Vivian Woodward dropped out of the England Amateur XI's visit to mainland Europe in March 1911. Healey made his debut against the French national team at the Stade de Paris, opening the scoring as his team won 3\u20130, and scored again a couple of days later against Switzerland in a 4\u20131 win. His next involvement at international level was nearly a year later, against the Wales Amateur XI at the ground of his former club, Bishop Auckland, in February 1912. He was involved in the buildup to the second goal, scored by Sydney Sanders, and scored the third himself as England won 3\u20130. He was selected as a reserve for matches at home to the Netherlands and away to Belgium in March and April, but did not make his next, and what turned out to be final, appearance until November against Belgium, in which he scored the second of England's four goals. He had to withdraw from the selection to face Wales in February 1913, and was an unused reserve for the visits to Germany and Belgium in March and to Wales the following February."]}]}}
