He attended school in Germany and Switzerland, had a brief internship at the New York Stock Exchange, then enrolled at Christ Church, Oxford University, where he studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE) earning a third class honours degree. He was a member of the exclusive Piers Gaveston Society, \"noted for its predilection for rubber wear and whips, which he embellished with his androgynous apparel and lipstick\" as well as the prohibitively expensive Bullingdon Club, known for its members' wealth and destructive binges, alongside friends like Darius Guppy. Confessing that he did not enjoy the typical social life in Oxford, he and his friends escaped to the wild, fashionable parties in London on the weekends or whenever possible. He reportedly drank heavily at night and took amphetamines by day to concentrate on his studies."]}, {"page": "List of British Iranians", "response": ["* Darius Guppy convicted fraudster, writer"]}, {"page": "List of University of Oxford people in business", "response": ["*Darius Guppy (Magdalen)"]}, {"page": "Boris Johnson", "response": ["Johnson gained a King's Scholarship to study at Eton College, a boarding school near Windsor in Berkshire. Arriving in the autumn term of 1977, he began using his middle name Boris rather than his first name Alexander, and developed \"the eccentric English persona\" for which he became famous. He abandoned his mother's Catholicism and became an Anglican, joining the Church of England. School reports complained about his idleness, complacency and lateness, but he was popular and well known at Eton. His friends were largely from the wealthy upper-middle and upper classes, his best friends then being Darius Guppy and Charles Spencer, both of whom later accompanied him to the University of Oxford and remained friends into adulthood. Johnson excelled in English and the Classics, winning prizes in both, and became secretary of the school debating society, and editor of the school newspaper, The Eton College Chronicle. In late 1981, he was elected a member of Pop, the small, self-selecting elite and glamorous group of prefects. Later in Johnson's career it was a point of rivalry with David Cameron, who had failed to enter Pop. On leaving Eton, Johnson went on a gap year to Australia, where he taught English and Latin at Timbertop, an Outward Bound-inspired campus of Geelong Grammar, an elite independent boarding school.", "Scandal erupted in June 1995 when a recording of a 1990 telephone conversation between Johnson and his friend Darius Guppy was made public. In the conversation, Guppy said that his criminal activities involving insurance fraud were being investigated by News of the World journalist Stuart Collier, and he asked Johnson to provide him with Collier's private address, seeking to have the latter beaten to the extent of \"a couple of black eyes and a cracked rib or something like that\". Johnson agreed to supply the information, although he expressed concern that he would be associated with the attack. When the phone conversation was published in 1995, Johnson stated that ultimately he had not obliged Guppy's request. Hastings reprimanded Johnson but did not dismiss him."]}, {"page": "Hooman Majd", "response": ["Madj aunt is musician Shusha Guppy, and his cousin is convicted fraudster Darius Guppy."]}, {"page": "HM Prison Sudbury", "response": ["* Darius Guppy, an Anglo-Iranian businessman, convicted of insurance fraud"]}, {"page": "Nicholas Davies (journalist)", "response": ["*Roll of the Dice (1996), Darius Guppy with Nicholas Davies"]}, {"page": "Darius (given name)", "response": ["*Darius Guppy (born 1964), Anglo\u2013Iranian businessman"]}, {"page": "List of alumni of Magdalen College, Oxford", "response": ["* Darius Guppy, British-Iranian businessman"]}, {"page": "Guppy (surname)", "response": ["* Darius Guppy, public school fraudster"]}]}}
