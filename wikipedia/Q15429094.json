The Caribbean islands were colonised under the authority or the direct instruction of a number of European monarchs, mostly English, Dutch, or Spanish, throughout the first half of the 17th century. By 1681, however, when the Turks and Caicos Islands were settled by Britons, all of the above-mentioned islands were under the control of Charles II of England, Scotland, and Ireland. Colonies were merged and split through various reorganizations of the Crown's Caribbean regions, until 19 December 1980, the date that Anguilla became a British Crown territory in its own right. The monarch is represented in these jurisdictions by: the Governor of Anguilla, Tim Foy; the Governor of Bermuda, John Rankin; the Governor of the British Virgin Islands, Gus Jaspert; the Governor of the Cayman Islands, Helen Kilpatrick; the Governor of Montserrat, Andrew Pearce; and the Governor of the Turks and Caicos Islands, John Freeman."]}, {"page": "List of viceregal representatives of Elizabeth II", "response": ["| data-sort-value=\"Rankin, John\" | John Rankin"]}, {"page": "List of High Commissioners of the United Kingdom to Sri Lanka", "response": ["* 2011\u20132015: John Rankin"]}, {"page": "List of Consuls-General of the United Kingdom in Boston", "response": ["* 2003\u20132007: John Rankin"]}, {"page": "Cabinet of the British Virgin Islands", "response": ["| John Rankin"]}, {"page": "List of state leaders in 2016", "response": ["**#John Rankin, Governor of Bermuda (2016\u2013present)"]}, {"page": "List of state leaders in 2017", "response": ["**Governor\u00a0\u2013 John Rankin, Governor of Bermuda (2016\u20132020)"]}]}}
