Many of the leading parts in his plays were written especially for Maria Gibbs (n\u00e9e Logan), whom he married at Clerkenwell in June 1836, after the death of his first wife in January that year.Terry Jenkins, 'The true facts of Colonel John George Nathaniel Gibbes' in Traces; uncovering Australia's past, No. 13 (Melbourne, December 2020)."]}, {"page": "Lebo M.", "response": ["In Los Angeles, he struggled to make ends meet, working odd jobs to survive while studying at Los Angeles City College. He performed sometimes at Memory Lane, a nightclub owned by Maria Gibbs. Morake was asked to help find a choir for the Oscars, so that they could perform music from 1987's Cry Freedom, a film about South Africa that was nominated for multiple Academy Awards, including one for Best Original Song. He made further strides in his music career when by chance, he ran into childhood friend Solly Letwaba, who was the bassist for Johnny Clegg. Letwaba introduced Morake to Clegg's producer, Hilton Rosenthal, who employed Morake as an intern and gofer for his production studio. Rosenthal was the music supervisor on the film The Power of One, and through him, Morake met the film's composer, Hans Zimmer. After being asked about some ideas for the film's soundtrack, Morake ended up co-writing and co-producing the music for The Power of One with Zimmer, helping to arrange the choruses. Morake used his knowledge of African rhythms to compose the soundtracks to other films, such as Congo (1995), Outbreak (1995), and Born to be Wild (1995). He decided to return to South Africa in the early 1990s, after the end of apartheid."]}, {"page": "John Palmer (actor)", "response": ["In 1785 Palmer, yielding to his own ambition and the counsel of friends, began to build the Royalty Theatre in Wellclose Square. Deaf to remonstrances, he persisted in his task, though the only licenses, wholly ineffectual, which he could obtain were those of the governor of the Tower and the magistrates of the adjoining district. This building he opened, 20 June 1787, with a performance of As you like it, in which he was Jaques to the Rosalind of Mrs. Belfille, and Miss in her Teens, in which he was Flash to the Miss Biddy of Maria Gibbs. The contest for places was violent. Apprehensive of an interference on the part of the authorities, he gave the representation for the benefit of the London Hospital. At the close Palmer read an address by Arthur Murphy, and said that performances would be suspended for the present. On 3 July the theatre was reopened for the performance of pantomimes and irregular pieces. Though backed up by friends, some of them of influence and wealth, Palmer was never able to conquer the opposition of the managers of the patent houses. A pamphlet warfare began with A Review of the present Contest between the Managers of the Winter Theatres, the Little Theatre in the Haymarket, and the Royalty Theatre in Wellclose Square, &c., 8vo, 1787. This, written in favour of Palmer, was answered anonymously by George Colman in A very plain State of the Case, or the Royalty Theatre versus the Theatres Royal, &c., 8vo, 1787. In the same year appeared Royal and Royalty Theatres (by Isaac Jackman), Letter to the Author of the Burletta called \"Hero and Leander,\" The Trial of John Palmer for opening the Royalty Theatre, tried in the Olympian Shades, and The Trial of Mr. John Palmer, Comedian and Manager of the Royalty Theatre, &c. In 1788 appeared The Eastern Theatre Erected, an heroic \"comic poem\", the hero of which is called Palmerio, and Case of the Renters of the Royalty Theatre. The polemic was continued after the death of Palmer, a list of the various pamphlets to which it gave rise being supplied in Mr. Robert Lowe's Bibliographical Account of Theatrical Literature. Improvident and practically penniless through life, Palmer ascribed to the treatment he received in connection with this speculation, in which nothing of his own was embarked, his subsequent imprisonment for debt and the general collapse of his fortunes."]}, {"page": "John George Nathaniel Gibbes", "response": ["In 2020 the theatre historian Terry Jenkins noted that Gibbes, his wife and son, were mentioned in the will of Mary or Maria Gibbs, the mistress of George Colman the Younger, who was born Mary Logan but when acting from the Spring of 1787 onwards called herself Mary or Maria Gibbs. She left her gold watch to her son Colonel Gibbes, her diamond snake ring to his wife Elizabeth, and her best gold chain to her grandson George Harvey Gibbes.Terry Jenkins, 'The true facts of Colonel John George Nathaniel Gibbes' in Traces: uncovering Australia's past, no. 13 (Melbourne, December 2020).
