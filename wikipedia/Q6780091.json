She founded and led an escape and evasion organization, the Marie-Claire Line, helping Allied airmen and soldiers escape from Nazi-occupied France. The airmen were survivors of military airplanes shot down over occupied Europe. During the course of the war, Lindell was run over by an automobile, shot in the head, imprisoned twice, and captured and sent to Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp.  Her son Maurice was captured and tortured. Her son Octave (Oky), also captured, disappeared and presumably died in a German concentration camp.\nOutspoken, controversial, and imperious, Lindell was called a \"false heroine\" by one critic, but she is credited with helping about 100 allied airmen escape from France. At Ravensbr\u00fcck she was the self-appointed leader of the British and American women imprisoned in the camp and as a nurse helped some of them survive. She advocated successfully for the release of 47 American and British women to the Swedish Red Cross in the closing days of World War II.\nLindell was awarded the Croix de Guerre twice, once for her work in World War I and once for World War II.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Nacht und Nebel", "response": ["*Mary Lindell (Comtesse de Milleville)"]}, {"page": "Judy Davis", "response": ["Davis had a cameo in Woody Allen's Alice (1990), her first appearance in an Allen-directed film. The following year, she was featured in Joel Coen's Barton Fink, which won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, and in David Cronenberg's adaptation of the hallucinogenic novel Naked Lunch. She returned to E.M. Forster territory in Where Angels Fear to Tread and won an Independent Spirit Award for her work as mannish woman author George Sand in Impromptu, a romantic period drama with Hugh Grant as her consumptive lover, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin. Davis was especially lauded for her performance as Sand, and Hal Hinson of The Washington Post wrote, \"Judy Davis makes her entrances as if she were straddling a cyclone. She doesn't just walk in, she blows in on a torrent of extravagant self-assurance and wild temperament. Sand, who's the locus of this blissfully high-spirited romp about the circle of writers and musicians in 1830s Paris, never does anything halfway; her life is an experiment in full-throttle, passionate immersion, and that's why Davis is the ideal actress for the part. She's the most atmospheric of actors, perhaps the only one around capable of streaking the screen with lightning.\" She earned an Emmy nomination and her first Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Miniseries or Television Film for her portrayal of a real-life Second World War heroine Mary Lindell in the CBS Hallmark Hall of Fame presentation One Against the Wind.
