The Botanic Gardens were established on the Science Site in 1925. Important appointments at this time included Arthur Holmes, pioneer of geochronology and plate tectonics, as professor of geology and climatologist Gordon Manley, who established the Durham temperature series (based on meteorological observations at Durham Observatory and other sources) back to 1801 and the Central England temperature series dating back to 1659, as head of Geography.

Vaughan Lewis, Gordon Manley and Ronald Peel. Professor  Frank Debenham, and Dr Jean Mitchell provided much encouragement and in the next three years Jean herself led small parties of students to Norway. Subsequently, she joined several University glaciological expeditions. The aim of the first of these in 1951, organised by Lewis and John McCall, an American research student, was for undergraduate labour to excavate a tunnel into Vesl-Skautbreen, a cirque glacier, to investigate its structure and flow characteristics. The effort was successful in reaching the headwall of the glacier and thereby provided graduates in geography, geology and mineralogy with the opportunity to make observations which laid the basis for post-war British glaciological research. Grove examined the banding on and in Veslskautbreen and Veslgjuvbreen and gained her PhD in 1956 for this work \u2013 'A study of aspects of the physiography of certain glaciers in Norway'. She produced two chapters in the 'Investigations on Norwegian Cirque Glaciers' (Royal Geographical Society Research Series: number 4, 1960) edited by Lewis, which brought together this innovative work, and published three other papers on the nature of these glaciers.", "From 1951-53 she lectured at Bedford College, London, under Gordon Manley.

He assisted with the surveying in Norway. They married in 1954 and settled in Cambridge. In 1963, with their young family, they spent 6 months in Ghana teaching at Legon University.", "Jean Grove's research continued to involve glaciers but increasingly it turned towards a subject, then somewhat neglected, namely historical climatology, following in the footsteps of Gordon Manley and Hubert Lamb. It was known that glaciers in the Alps had extended well beyond their present limits, leaving behind moraines dating from roughly 1600CE to 1900CE, the period known as the 'Little Ice Age'. Jean sought 'proxy' data for the instrumental climatic record in the Alps and elsewhere. She and Arthur Battagel, a relation by marriage, made use of the information about climatic and glacial damage to farmland in Norway provided by land tax records. It remained unclear whether the Little Ice Age was globally synchronous and so she proceeded to collect information from the field and from archives in many parts of the world. In 1988 her magnum opus, 'The Little Ice Age', was published (Methuen).  This provided the first comprehensive study of the phenomenon.  A second edition, edited by Dick Grove, was published in 2004."]}, {"page": "List of alumni of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge", "response": ["*Gordon Manley \u2013 climatologist"]}]}}
