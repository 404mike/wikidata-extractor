The team used redshift surveys and spectroscopy to observe and estimate the distribution of luminous and dark matter in a sample of galaxies and found that Earth's galaxy, the Milky Way, is inside of a large void named the KBC Void for the research team. As of 2017, the KBC Void is the largest-known void with a diameter of approximately 2 billion light-years. In that same year, Barger's former student Benjamin Hoscheit presented the results of their follow-up study, in which Hoscheit used the linear kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect to measure galaxy clusters' motions and confirm the existence of the spherical-shaped KBC Void, which is surrounded by a shell of galaxies, stars and other cosmic materials."]}, {"page": "HCM-6A", "response": ["HCM-6A is an LAE galaxy that was found in 2002 by Esther Hu and Lennox Cowie "]}, {"page": "Cowie (surname)", "response": ["*Lennox Cowie, Scottish astronomer"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society A, B, C", "response": ["| Lennox Cowie||27/05/2004||"]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal Society elected in 2004", "response": ["*Lennox Cowie"]}]}}
