Said policies often include the promotion of international trade as well as international law. Influenced by the thinking of Kant, the approach to international relations envisions a strong sense of morality as creating a more just world. Specific foreign policy scholars identified with the school of idealism include S. H. Bailey, Philip Noel-Baker, David Mitrany, and Alfred Zimmern in the U.K. as well as Parker T.

Neofunctionalism is simultaneously a theory and a strategy of regional integration, building on the work of David Mitrany. Neofunctionalists focused their attention solely on the immediate process of integration among states (regional integration). Initially, states integrate in limited functional or economic areas. Thereafter, partially integrated states experience increasing momentum for further rounds of integration in related areas. This \"invisible hand\" of integration phenomenon was termed \"spill-over.\" by the neofunctionalist school. This was most apparent in the study of euthanasia. Although integration can be resisted, it becomes harder to stop integration's reach as it progresses."]}, {"page": "Romanians in the United Kingdom", "response": ["*David Mitrany, scholar"]}, {"page": "International Agrarian Bureau", "response": ["The notion of a Green International centered on anti-fascist policies was embraced in 1939 by the HSS' Vladko Ma\u010dek, who proposed that such an \"agrarian autarky\", if properly armed by Britain and France, could function as a bulwark against Nazi Germany. A Croat autonomist, Ma\u010dek also believed that any such arming needed to be conditioned by a Croat\u2013Yugoslav settlement.M. de Loince, \"M.

The IAB was partly reconstructed as the Fabian Society's East European Discussion Group, frequented by the likes of Milan Gavrilovi\u0107, Jerzy Kuncewicz, and David Mitrany. This initiative produced in July 1942 an International Agrarian Conference, overseen by Chatham House, during which delegates formally pledged themselves to the Atlantic Charter, while restating support for cooperative farming and introducing calls for a planned economy.Cabo, p. 305", "According to IPU communiques, the cases of Petkov, Maniu and B\u00e9la Kov\u00e1cs showed that \"peasant movements are main obstacles in the path of Soviet imperialism.\" The Greens also criticized the Bulgarian regime for its reclamation of Stamboliyski as a cult figure, noting that such practices glossed over his anti-communism.Cabo, p. 314 The Greens' agenda was mainly focused on criticizing Western politicians who talked of deescalating tensions with the Soviet Union, referring to such an agenda as \"appeasement\".Cabo, pp. 318\u2013319 Miko\u0142ajczyk took on the mission of reminding Westerners about historical issues that the Soviet government had either obscured or denied, including the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact and the Katyn massacre, while Nagy popularized \"totalitarianism\" as an umbrella term for both fascism and communism.Cabo, pp. 321\u2013322 David Mitrany and other IPU intellectuals dedicated much study to Marxism's take on agrarian questions, concluding that peasants and Marxists were forever incompatible. This development, Cabo argues, signaled that the Greens were no longer searching for a \"Third Way\", but rather folded into a standard capitalist vision; the IPU reserved some praise for Nordic agrarianism and highlighted the progress of mechanized agriculture in the West, but refrained from advancing any specific model for future development.Cabo, pp. 316\u2013321"]}, {"page": "D.
