There was a familiar feeling to the squad with Dick Hope and Fred McCarthy the only players to come from outside the local area. Two departures in 1914 were William Smith whose long term leg injury got the better of him and skipper Ernest Mullineux. An impressive start was made to the 1914\u201315 season and a draw against Brentford on Christmas Day was only the third point Stoke had dropped. Stoke went on to comfortably claim the league title. There was also the emergence of Arthur Watkin who top scored with 24 league goals.", "|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Fred McCarthy"]}, {"page": "Fred McCarthy", "response": ["Fred McCarthy may refer to:", "*Fred McCarthy (cartoonist) (1918\u20132009), American cartoonist", "*Fred McCarthy (footballer) (1890\u2013?), English footballer", "*Fred McCarthy (archaeologist) (1905\u20131997), Australian archaeologist and anthropologist"]}]}}
