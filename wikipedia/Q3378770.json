Born in Cardiff, he began his career with his hometown club Cardiff City, joining the side as an apprentice in 1969. He made his professional debut for the club in October 1972, winning his first honours the same season by helping the side win the Welsh Cup. He suffered relegation with Cardiff in 1975 but helped the side win promotion back to the Second Division at the first attempt, scoring 10 goals during the season.\nDwyer remained a mainstay of the side for more than a decade, becoming known by the nickname \"Joe\" due to his perceived resemblance to Joe Royle. He was nearly released by manager Len Ashurst in 1982 following a serious knee injury. He returned to the first team, winning promotion in the 1982\u201383 season and was ever present during the 1983\u201384 campaign.\nHe set a new club record for Football League appearances the following year, overtaking Tom Farquharson's long standing record. Dwyer left the club in 1985 after falling out with manager Alan Durban. He made 575 appearances in all competitions for the club, scoring 51 times during a 13-year spell. He made his international debut for Wales in April 1978 and gained ten caps over the following year, scoring twice. He won his last cap in October 1979.\nHe finished his playing career with a brief loan spell at Fourth Division side Rochdale where he made 15 appearances, scoring once. He retired from playing in 1985 and joined the South Wales Police. He served with the force for 15 years before resigning after an incident of drink-driving. He later became a freelance legal representative.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Barry Town United F.C.", "response": ["|DF|| Phil Dwyer"]}, {"page": "Robin Friday", "response": ["After winning the title of \"Player of the Millennium\" from Reading in 1999, he was voted the top \"all-time cult hero\" for both Reading and Cardiff in a 2004 BBC poll; with similar polls taking place at each Premier League and Football League club, he was the only player to appear in the top three for two different sides. In 2007, a poll of fans run by Reading resulted in his once more being named the club's best ever. Later that year, when the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) canvassed Reading supporters for their all-time favourite, Friday won again. In a parallel PFA survey, Cardiff fans chose one of Friday's former teammates, Wales international defender Phil Dwyer.

Their troubles continued as they were relegated to the Third Division South for the first time in their history soon after. In 1932, he nearly left the financially stricken club to join Hull City after a transfer offer was accepted. Cardiff planned to replace him with backup goalkeeper Len Evans, only for Evans to leave himself before the deal was completed. A board meeting was hastily arranged during which Farquharson agreed to remain with Cardiff, where he played for a further three years before retiring in 1935. In his book, The Who's Who of Cardiff City, Dean Hayes describes Farquharson as \"without doubt [...] the greatest goalkeeper in the history of the club.\" He played in 445 matches in the Football League, a club record which stood until 1985 when it was surpassed by Phil Dwyer.
