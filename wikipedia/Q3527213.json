For the 1888\u201389 season, the English team were asked to award it to the team which had excelled most against them. They chose Kimberley. In 1889\u201390, the competition proper began with a challenge by Transvaal to Kimberley.

The MCC had brought a strong team, including eight professionals, and on winning the toss they elected to bat.

Frank Hearne then joined Gunn at the crease, and the pair continued the MCC's dominance, adding a further 130 runs. Another run out, again due to the fielding of Newton, brought Gunn's innings to an end, after the MCC batsman had scored 188 runs. Wickets then began to fall more frequently; Roe collected three, while Fothergill and Winter had two apiece, and the MCC were eventually all out for 506 on the second morning. In their response, Somerset lost the early wickets of Sainsbury and Newton, but then a partnership between Fowler and Roe took the score up to 181, during which Fowler reached his century, coming in just 55 minutes. Once that partnership was ended with the dismissal of Roe, Somerset regularly lost wickets. Fowler was caught in the slips for 139, which had included three sixes, and Somerset ended their innings on 286. They followed on, and lost five early wickets before a partnership between Francis Terry, who scored 77 runs, and Fothergill steadied the innings and help Somerset secure a draw."]}, {"page": "List of cricketers who have played for two international teams", "response": ["Billy Midwinter was the first cricketer to play for two nations during his career, playing two Test matches for Australia in 1877 before appearing for England in four Tests in 1881-82.
