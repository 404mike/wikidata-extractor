Keane immediately gave an interview to leading sports journalist Tom Humphries, of the Irish Times newspaper, where he expressed his unhappiness with the facilities in Saipan and listed the events and concerns which had led him to leave the team temporarily. McCarthy took offence at Keane's interview and decided to confront Keane over the article in front of the entire squad and coaching staff. Keane refused to relent, saying that he had told the newspaper what he considered to be the truth and that the Irish fans deserved to know what was going on inside the camp. He then unleashed a stinging verbal tirade against McCarthy: \"Mick, you're a liar... you're a fucking wanker. I didn't rate you as a player, I don't rate you as a manager, and I don't rate you as a person. You're a fucking wanker and you can stick your World Cup up your arse. The only reason I have any dealings with you is that somehow you are the manager of my country! You can stick it up your bollocks.\" Niall Quinn observed in his autobiography that \"Roy Keane's 10-minute oration [against Mick McCarthy, above] ... was clinical, fierce, earth-shattering to the person on the end of it and it ultimately caused a huge controversy in Irish society.\" But at the same time, he was also critical of Keane's stance, saying that, \"[He] left us in Saipan, not the other way round.

This article included details and references to the preparations that had been set in place for the Irish team.

Granagh-Ballingarry are the product of a merger in the late '70s but Ballingarry's record of success stretches back to the late 1920s and early '30s. St Vincent's are another amalgamation job, the Dublin giants Marino having thrown in their lot with the local GAA club a few years ago. St Vincent's escaped Leinster after years of trying this year and the method used was quick ground hurling. Pulling on the ball before it had time to nestle in the turf. They got to Limerick yesterday to find that the elements had conspired against them. The pitch was so heavy and sodden that it was a wonder the game was played at all. With the ball steadfastly refusing to move along the grass the home team produced the style of play designed to maximise home advantage. Jean Cullinane and Eileen O'Brien launched scores on the run from 30 and 40 yards out respectively. The confident execution put an end to all arguments.
