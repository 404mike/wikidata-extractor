Before ordination, he  spent a year teaching in north-west Uganda and worked as a research and development chemist with Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) in Manchester for nearly two years. He served in Sheffield, London, Bath and Yeovil before his appointment in 1995 as Archdeacon of Halifax.

As acting bishop, Inwood attracted media attention in June 2014 for revoking the permission to officiate of a gay priest, Jeremy Pemberton, who had legally married his partner in spite of a pastoral statement issued by the church's bishops. In August 2014, Pemberton had an offer of work at Sherwood Forest Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust withdrawn following Inwood's refusal to grant the relevant licence.Inwood was the co-author of Moved by Steam: Beside the tracks and on the trains 1962-67 with Mike Smith (Kettering, 2009 ISBN 978-1-85794-323-8).
