Surrounded on three sides by the sea amid fertile fishing grounds, Cornwall naturally has fresh seafood readily available; Newlyn is the largest fishing port in the UK by value of fish landed, and is known for its wide range of restaurants. Television chef Rick Stein has long operated a fish restaurant in Padstow for this reason, and Jamie Oliver chose to open his second restaurant, Fifteen, in Watergate Bay near Newquay. MasterChef host and founder of Smiths of Smithfield, John Torode, in 2007 purchased Seiners in Perranporth. One famous local fish dish is Stargazy pie, a fish-based pie in which the heads of the fish stick through the piecrust, as though \"star-gazing\". The pie is cooked as part of traditional celebrations for Tom Bawcock's Eve, but is not generally eaten at any other time."]}, {"page": "Padstow", "response": ["thumb|Rick Stein's Seafood Restaurant, Padstow", "Traditionally a fishing port, Padstow is now a popular tourist destination. Although some of its former fishing fleet remains, it is mainly a yachting haven on a dramatic coastline with few easily navigable harbours. The influence of restaurateur Rick Stein can be seen in the port, and tourists travel from long distances to eat at his restaurant and caf\u00e9s.

His father, Shaun O'Riordan, starred as Eddie Larkin in the sitcom The Larkins, which aired on British television between 1958 and 1960. Jules is the nephew of celebrity chef Rick Stein.

Inshore fishing, particularly for crustaceans and line fish, takes place along the coast. Lobsters, brown and velvet crabs are important to the local fishery. From May to August, salmon is found in the Esk, and small open boats are licensed to net these off the harbour entrance. There are around 40 licensed angling party boats. The commercial catch is no longer herring but has been replaced by cod, haddock, and other fish caught within  of the coast. A fish market on the quayside operates as need arises. The ready supply of fresh fish has resulted in an abundance of \"chippies\" in the town, including the Magpie Cafe which Rick Stein has described as the best fish and chip shop in Britain."]}, {"page": "List of University of Oxford people", "response": ["*Rick Stein (New College)"]}, {"page": "List of individual dogs", "response": ["* Chalky, a Jack Russell Terrier belonging to English chef and presenter Rick Stein"]}, {"page": "Canal du Midi", "response": ["It attracts more and more river tourism, including sailing on chartered boats, restaurant-boats, or hotel barges such as the Anjodi.

The canal was featured prominently in the BBC television series Rick Stein's French Odyssey (2005), further publicising the canal to a British audience. Busier than the Seine, the canal alone accounts for one-fifth of French river tourism and 80% of passengers are foreigners, primarily Germans, Swiss and British. There are approximately 10,000 boat passages per year through the Fons\u00e9ranes locks, with the most traffic at the Argens lock with 11,000 boats carrying an average of five passengers.

He acknowledged Hector Berlioz as an influence, alongside Gustav Mahler, B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k and jazz. Several commentators have drawn a comparison with Jean Sibelius. Arnold's most significant works are generally considered to be his nine symphonies. He also wrote a number of concertos, including one for guitar for Julian Bream, one for cello for Julian Lloyd Webber, two for clarinet for Frederick Thurston and Benny Goodman, one for harmonica for Larry Adler and one \u2013 enthusiastically welcomed at its premiere during the 1969 Proms \u2013 for three hands on two pianos for the husband-and-wife team of Cyril Smith and Phyllis Sellick. His sets of dances \u2013 comprising two sets of English Dances (Opp. 27 and 33), along with one set each of Scottish Dances (Op. 59), Cornish Dances (Op. 91), Irish Dances (Op. 126), and Welsh Dances (Op. 138) \u2014 are mainly in a lighter vein and are popular both in their original orchestral guise and in later wind and brass band arrangements. The English Dances also form the basis for Kenneth MacMillan's short ballet Solitaire, and one of them has been used as the theme music for the British television programme What the Papers Say (the Cornish Dances has provided the theme music for the television programmes of the cook Rick Stein). Arnold also wrote some highly successful concert overtures,Cooke, Mervyn (2005). Malcolm Arnold: Concert Overtures  (PDF). Chandos Records. Retrieved 2011-07-03. including Beckus the Dandipratt (an important stepping stone in his early career), the strikingly scored Tam o' Shanter (based on the famous Robert Burns poem), the rollicking A Grand Grand Overture (written for a Hoffnung Festival and featuring three vacuum cleaners and a floor polisher, all in turn polished off by a firing squad in a mock 1812 manner), and the dramatic Peterloo Overture (commissioned by the Trades Union Congress to commemorate the historic massacre of protesting workers in Manchester). Another popular short work is his Divertimento for Flute, Oboe and Clarinet (Op. 37). Arnold is also known for his relatively large number of compositions and arrangements of his own compositions for brass band. In 1954, Beckus the Dandipratt was given a radio studio performance by the BBC Symphony Orchestra under Leopold Stokowski, who was thanked by the composer for his \"wonderful performance.\""]}]}}
