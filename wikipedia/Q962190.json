She was the wife of King Beorhtric of Wessex, and according to Asser's Life of Alfred the Great she killed her husband by poison while attempting to poison another. She fled to Francia, where she is said to have been offered the chance of marrying Charlemagne, but ruined the opportunity. Instead she was appointed as the abbess of a convent. Here she is said to have fornicated with an English exile.

The son of Thingfrith and a descendant of Eowa, Offa came to the throne after a period of civil war following the assassination of \u00c6thelbald. Offa defeated the other claimant, Beornred. In the early years of Offa's reign, it is likely that he consolidated his control of Midland peoples such as the Hwicce and the Magons\u00e6te. Taking advantage of instability in the kingdom of Kent to establish himself as overlord, Offa also controlled Sussex by 771, though his authority did not remain unchallenged in either territory. In the 780s he extended Mercian Supremacy over most of southern England, allying with Beorhtric of Wessex, who married Offa's daughter Eadburh, and regained complete control of the southeast. He also became the overlord of East Anglia and had King \u00c6thelberht II of East Anglia beheaded in 794, perhaps for rebelling against him.", "Offa's wife was Cynethryth, whose ancestry is unknown. The couple had a son, Ecgfrith, and at least three daughters: \u00c6lffl\u00e6d, Eadburh and \u00c6thelburh.Kelly, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography It has been speculated that \u00c6thelburh was the abbess who was a kinswoman of King Ealdred of the Hwicce, but there are other prominent women named \u00c6thelburh during that period.", "To the south of Mercia, Cynewulf came to the throne of Wessex in 757 and recovered much of the border territory that \u00c6thelbald had conquered from the West Saxons. Offa won an important victory over Cynewulf at the Battle of Bensington (in Oxfordshire) in 779, reconquering some of the land along the Thames.Stenton, Anglo-Saxon England, p.\u00a0209. No indisputably authentic charters from before this date show Cynewulf in Offa's entourage, and there is no evidence that Offa ever became Cynewulf's overlord. In 786, after the murder of Cynewulf, Offa may have intervened to place Beorhtric on the West Saxon throne. Even if Offa did not assist Beorhtric's claim, it seems likely that Beorhtric to some extent recognised Offa as his overlord shortly thereafter.Yorke, Kings and Kingdoms, p.\u00a0141. Offa's currency was used across the West Saxon kingdom, and Beorhtric had his own coins minted only after Offa's death.Blackburn & Grierson, Early Medieval Coinage, pp.\u00a0281\u2013282. In 789, Beorhtric married Eadburh, a daughter of Offa; the Chronicle records that the two kings combined to exile Egbert to Francia for \"three years\", adding that \"Beorhtric helped Offa because he had his daughter as his queen\".Swanton, Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, p.\u00a062. Some historians believe that the Chronicles \"three years\" is an error, and should read \"thirteen years\", which would mean Egbert's exile lasted from 789 to 802, but this reading is disputed.E.g. Fletcher assumes that Egbert spent essentially all Beorhtric's reign in Francia; see Fletcher, Who's Who, p. 114. Similarly, Swanton annotates \"3 years\" with \"in fact thirteen years\u00a0... this error is common to all MSS.\" See note 12 in Swanton, Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, pp. 62\u201363. On the other hand, Stenton accepts the figure as three: see Stenton, Anglo-Saxon England, p. 220. Stenton adds in a footnote that \"it is very dangerous to reject a reading which is so well attested\". Eadburh is mentioned by Asser, a 9th-century monk who wrote a biography of Alfred the Great: Asser says that Eadburh had \"power throughout almost the entire kingdom\", and that she \"began to behave like a tyrant after the manner of her father\".Keynes & Lapidge, Alfred the Great, p.\u00a071. Whatever power she had in Wessex was no doubt connected with her father's overlordship.Yorke, Kings and Kingdoms, p.\u00a0147."]}, {"page": "Asser", "response": ["Thereafter Asser seems to have divided his time between Wales and Alfred's court. Asser gives no information about his time in Wales, but mentions various places that he visited in England, including the battlefield at Ashdown, Cynuit (Countisbury), and Athelney. It is evident from Asser's account that he spent a good deal of time with Alfred: he recounts meeting Alfred's mother-in-law, Eadburh (who is not the same Eadburh who died as a beggar in Pavia), on many occasions; and says that he has often seen Alfred hunting.", "In addition to being the primary source for Alfred's life, Asser's work is also a source for other historical periods, where he adds material to his translation of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. For example, he tells a story about Eadburh, the daughter of Offa. Eadburh married Beorhtric, king of the West Saxons. Asser describes her as behaving \"like a tyrant\" and ultimately accidentally poisoning Beorhtric in an attempt to murder someone else. He finishes by describing her death as a beggar in Pavia.Keynes and Lapidge, Alfred the Great, pp. 71\u201372. This Eadburh is not the same as Alfred's mother-in-law, also named Eadburh, whom Asser mentions elsewhere."]}, {"page": "Coenwulf of Mercia", "response": ["For most of the 8th century, Mercia was dominant among the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms south of the river Humber. \u00c6thelbald, who came to the throne in 716, had established himself as the overlord of the southern Anglo-Saxons by 731.Simon Keynes, \"Mercia\", in Lapidge et al., Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England, p.\u00a0306. He was assassinated in 757, and was briefly succeeded by Beornred, but within a year Offa ousted Beornred and took the throne for himself. Offa's daughter Eadburh married Beorhtric of Wessex in 789, and Beorhtric became an ally thereafter.Stenton, Anglo-Saxon England, p.\u00a0210.

Cwoenthryth subsequently was engaged in a long dispute with Archbishop Wulfred over her rights to the monastery. Coenwulf also had a son, Cynehelm, who later became known as a saint, with a cult dating from at least the 970s.Thacker, \"Kings, Saints and Monasteries\", p.\u00a08.

No doubt her story was embellished and exaggerated in the interests of later propaganda in Wessex against both Mercia and Beortrick, and to justify the limited role of royal wives.
