This growth changed the character of the railway and had a profound influence upon its motive power policy and passenger train services. In the 1870s and 1880s it led to the building of new standard tank engine classes such as the Terrier and D1 classes under William Stroudley. R. J. Billinton replaced these with the D3, E3, E4, and E5 classes designed for London suburban services, during the 1890s. When steam locomotives became unable to cope with the increased suburban traffic and competition from electric trams in the early 20th century, it resulted in the electrification of the London suburban network.", "Stroudley's successor R. J. Billinton continued the process of standardisation of locomotive parts until his death in 1904, thereby reducing maintenance costs. He introduced eight-wheeled designs in the form of  express locomotives of the B4 class and the D3) class , for use on London suburban services. He also introduced a very successful and versatile series of four  tank engine classes with radial axles for both passenger and freight duties.

The radial axlebox worked in a corresponding curved hornblock the centre of which was struck near the middle of the chassis. The device was originally invented in 1863 by William Bridges Adams (no relation) and could be applied to a leading or trailing axle but was generally preferred for the latter. Many other engineers used it, including Webb, R. J. Billinton, H. G. Ivatt, and D.E. Marsh.

They were designed by R. J. Billinton and built at Brighton works from 1895 to 1897.  They proved to be reliable locomotives but barely adequate for the heaviest trains and acquired the nickname Grasshoppers.  As a result the B3 class was developed from the B2, and the B2X class was later rebuilt from these locomotives with larger boilers.", "When R. J. Billinton took over as chief mechanical engineer of the LB&SCR in 1890, following the sudden death of William Stroudley, the London to Brighton trains were adequately served by Stroudley's Gladstone class but the lighter Portsmouth expresses were beginning to struggle behind his G class singles. Billinton therefore designed a small 4-4-0, specifically for these services. However, during the course of 1892-1893 the London-to-Brighton trains began to increase in weight, and the board of governors of the railway agreed to invest money in larger turntables and so Billinton was able to enlarge his design further to make them more generally useful."]}, {"page": "Radial axle", "response": ["Radial axles were also used in locomotives designed by  F.W. Webb of the London and North Western Railway, and by William Stroudley and R. J. Billinton of the London Brighton and South Coast Railway. Webb's form of radial axle used a cannon box bearing where the two axle bearings are carried in a single curved casting, the 'cannon box', which can slide sideways in a circular track. David Joy, designer of the eponymous valvegear, described encountering these axleboxes on Webb's Precedent class. The earlier Adams design had relied on the axle and thrust-faces within the axle bearings to keep the hornblocks in position."]}]}}
