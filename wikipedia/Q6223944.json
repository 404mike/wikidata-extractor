That was his only first-class run, and his only contribution to the game, but it was a heroic innings as he was last man in,  and helped Joseph Rowbotham take the score from 76 for 9, to the 91 they needed to complete a one wicket win.\nBurman, who was born in Bramham cum Oglethorpe, near Wetherby, Yorkshire, England, also umpired the Roses match at Old Trafford in 1875.\nHe died aged 61, in May 1900 in Halton, Leeds.", "link_mentions": {}}}
