Bald, with a fake moustache, Finlayson had many trademark comic mannerisms and is known for his squinting, outraged, \"double take and fade away\" head reaction, and characteristic expression \"d'ooooooh\", and as the best remembered comic foil of Laurel and Hardy.\nFinlayson was known by a variety of nicknames. According to Laurel and Hardy scholar Randy Skretvedt, he \"called himself Jimmy, was known around the lot as Jim and is usually referred to today as 'Fin'\" \u2013 perhaps because he played a character called Fin in Our Relations and one named Mickey Finn in Way Out West, or most likely, just as a truncated version of his surname.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Homer Simpson", "response": ["Homer's main and most famous catchphrase, the annoyed grunt \"D'oh!\", is typically uttered when he injures himself, realizes that he has done something stupid, or when something bad has happened or is about to happen to him. During the voice recording session for a Tracey Ullman Show short, Homer was required to utter what was written in the script as an \"annoyed grunt\". Dan Castellaneta rendered it as a drawn out \"d'ooooooh\". This was inspired by Jimmy Finlayson, the mustachioed Scottish actor who appeared in 33 Laurel and Hardy films. Finlayson had used the term as a minced oath to stand in for the word \"Damn!\" Matt Groening felt that it would better suit the timing of animation if it were spoken faster. Castellaneta then shortened it to a quickly uttered \"D'oh!\" The first intentional use of D'oh! occurred in the Ullman short \"The Krusty the Clown Show\" (1989), and its first usage in the series was in the series premiere, \"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\"."]}, {"page": "D'oh!", "response": ["During the voice recording session for a Tracey Ullman Show short, Homer was required to utter what was written in the script as an \"annoyed grunt\". Dan Castellaneta rendered it as a drawn out \"d'ooooooh\". This was inspired by Jimmy Finlayson, the mustachioed Scottish actor who appeared in 33 Laurel and Hardy films, from the pre-sound era up to 1940. Finlayson had used the term as a minced oath for suggesting the word \"damn!\" without actually saying it. Matt Groening felt that it would better suit the timing of animation if it were spoken faster.

It is typically represented in the show's script as \"(annoyed grunt)\", and is so spelled out in the official titles of several episodes. Some episodes feature variations of the word such as \"Bart of Darkness\" (season six, 1994), where Homer says \"D'oheth\" after an Amish farmer points out to him that he has built a barn instead of the swimming pool he was intending; \"Thirty Minutes over Tokyo\" (season ten, 1999), where Homer says \"d'oh\" in Japanese (with English subtitles, the spoken phrase being \"shimatta baka ni\", literally \"damn folly\"); or The Simpsons Movie (2007) where Homer shouts \"d'oooohme!\" after the EPA seals the Simpsons' hometown, Springfield, in a giant dome. The spelling is made official in \"Jaws Wired Shut\" (season thirteen, 2002), in which Homer, unable to open his mouth due to his dislodged jaw being placed in a brace, writes the word on a whiteboard during a conversation with Marge."]}, {"page": "Hats Off (1927 film)", "response": ["*Jimmy Finlayson \u2013 Proprietor, Kwickway Washing Machine Co."]}, {"page": "Saps at Sea", "response": ["Stan and Ollie work in a horn factory, where Hardy is already under stress from all the incessant noise. The episode begins with a worker getting carted out (Eddie Borden) after having gone insane and is the latest casualty of the work environment, the \"fourth one this week\" according to a watching police officer. Ollie is sent home after developing \"hornophobia\", which results in his going crazy each time he hears horns or horn-based musical instruments. A physician (Jimmy Finlayson) is called to treat Ollie and, warning Ollie that he could develop a more serious condition, \"hornomania,\" prescribes a relaxing boat trip and goat's milk. Ollie dismisses the idea because he is afraid to sail on the ocean, but Stan offers an alternative: they will simply rent a boat and keep it attached to the dock, getting all the sea air they can while never actually going out to sea. A running gag in the episode is when one of the boys tries to turn on the taps and gas hobs, only for the one opposite to go on instead due to the janitor being cross-eyed, which results in Stan destroying half the kitchen area with a gas explosion and Ollie vowing to find the janitor and give him a very large piece of his mind. On the way down, Ollie is accosted by his Scottish neighbor who inquires as to whether he is having trouble with his apartment, then drags him into hers when he confirms it to be all \"topsy-turvy\". She shows him what happened when she turned on her radio that morning (causing her fridge to loudly blare music when opened, while the radio itself is covered in an indiscernible white substance), causing Ollie to give the janitor a piece of her mind as well. When Stan's trombone teacher (Eddie Conrad) arrives and Ollie, returning from a fight with the janitor (Ben Turpin), hears the music, goes berserk and throws the teacher out, he knows he should take that advice. Phoning the hotel manager to complain why that teacher was allowed in, Hardy is accidentally knocked out the window and into the street."]}, {"page": "The Bohemian Girl (1936 film)", "response": ["Twelve years later, the Gypsies return to Arnheim's estate. When grown-up Arline (Jacqueline Wells) accidentally trespasses in Arnheim's garden, she recognises the place and Arnheim's voice, but is arrested by a constable (Jimmy Finlayson) and sentenced to a lashing. Stan and Oliver try to save her, but Stan is too drunk and both are arrested.  Just as Arline is stripped in order to be lashed, she is rescued in time by Arnheim, who recognises a medallion she wears and a family birthmark, and both try to rescue Stan and Oliver. It is too late though: Laurel and Hardy had already been worked over in the torture chamber: Hardy emerges stretched to a height of eight feet, while Stan has been crushed to only a few feet tall and the constable just stands yelling and moaning."]}, {"page": "Bonnie Scotland", "response": ["In the boarding house, Laurel swaps their overcoats for a large fish for dinner. In quick succession the fish \"shrizzles\" to about 1/10 its size, Hardy's pants are burnt and ruined, and an attempt to hide the still-hot stove results in the landlady throwing the two out and confiscating their luggage for non-payment of rent. Receiving an ad for a tailor's offer of a new suit, Laurel and Hardy accidentally go to the wrong floor and join a Scottish regiment of the British Army and travel to India, where they frequently run afoul of their Sergeant Major (Jimmy Finlayson), and help their friend Alan (William Janney) reunite with his love (and Laurel's cousin) Lorna McLaurel (June Lang)."]}]}}
