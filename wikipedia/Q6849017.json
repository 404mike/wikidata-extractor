His early cricket was played at Amersham Hill C.C. and then Chesham C.C. where he benefitted from being coached by Alf Pope the ex-Derbyshire bowler.  Before moving to Trent Bridge Taylor played Minor County Cricket for Buckinghamshire. Whilst qualifying by residence for Nottinghamshire he enjoyed a successful season in 1963 with Spen Victoria C.C. in the Bradford League.Archived 3 September 2007 at the Wayback Machine</ref>\nTaylor was a right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium pace bowler.  He made his first-class debut for Nottinghamshire in 1964 and played there until 1972, when he was not offered a new contract, despite playing in 230 matches with a batting average of 18.01 and 522 wickets at 27.88. In that final season, he played in a Gillette Cup match against Hampshire at Trent Bridge, taking 2\u201339 in 12 overs and top-scoring with 58, and when they learned of his release, Hampshire signed him. He had an immediate impact, for in 1973 he took 64 first-class wickets at 21.71, and scored 507 runs at 24.14, to help his new county to their second title. His bowling figures were even better in 1974 when they were foiled by the weather in the search for a second successive Championship, and through the 1970s he proved himself one of the best of Hampshire's signings from another county. In addition to his fine medium-pace bowling he scored his first century for the county in 1977, and there was another in 1978. In that season, age 35, he was a member of the Hampshire side that won the Sunday League, as he had been in 1975. He retired at the end of the 1980 season and became Hampshire's Assistant Secretary and then Marketing Manager, not least during the demanding 1990s in the move to the Rose Bowl. He took 308 first-class wickets for Hampshire at 24.21, plus 162 limited-overs wickets at 25.70 and an economy rate below four runs per over. His best bowling was 7-23 v his former county Nottinghamshire at Basingstoke in 1977. He retired from the office in 2002, after 30 years with his 'new' county.\nAcross 11 English Winters from 1966-1979 (two in the UK), he coached three seasons for the Transvaal Cricket Union ( now Gauteng ) and eight for Jeppe High Schools for Boys, both based in Johannesburg.\nHe also played one season for Pilkington Glass C.C in Springs, and five seasons for E.R.P.M. East\nRand Propriety Mines in Boksburg (Winners of the Harlequin Cup 1974/75).\nBoth these clubs were situated in what was the Northern Transvaal and he played one match for NT in the List A Datsun Shield v Rhodesia.\n<Dave Allen 'Hampshire County Cricketers' Moyhill 2018>\nMike Taylor is the twin brother of Derek Taylor, the Somerset wicket-keeper.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hampshire County Cricket Club", "response": ["Again, however, Hampshire were disappointing until Barry Richards joined the county in 1968, when they rose from tenth to fifth in the Championship and established themselves as a power in limited-overs cricket. Bob Cottam was the second-highest first-class wicket-taker in 1968 and the highest in 1969, but did not maintain this excellence before joining Northamptonshire and in 1970 and 1971 Hampshire fell to mid-table. In the 1973 County Championship Hampshire won the County Championship for a second time, winning the competition by 31 points from Surrey. The club won 10 of their 20 matches and drew the other 10. During this season they were led by Richard Gilliat with Gordon Greenidge scoring the most runs for the club with 1,620. Bob Herman and Mike Taylor both took 63 wickets. This remains Hampshire's last success in the tournament.  In 1979 West Indian Malcolm Marshall, widely regarded as one of the best bowlers to grace the game joined the club. This was to be the start of a 14-year stay with the club. During that time Marshall would go on to take 824 first-class wickets at an average of 18.64 and 239 wickets at 24.88 in one-day cricket. 1984 also saw the last game of Venezuelan captain Nick Pocock (Maracaibo, 1951) and the arrival of another West Indian, Cardigan Connor who would spend 14 years with the club. Regarded as one of the best players not to play Test cricket, Connor took 614 first-class wickets for Hampshire at an average of 31.74 and 411 wickets at 25.07 in one-day cricket.  In 1985 Hampshire finished second in the County Championship, finishing 18 points behind winners Middlesex. Chris Smith led the way with the bat, scoring 1,720 runs. and was well backed up by the bowling of Malcolm Marshall who took 95 wickets at the impressive average of 17.68.  Later in, 1988 the club won the Benson & Hedges Cup by beating Derbyshire by 7 wickets at Lord's, largely thanks to a five wicket haul by Stephen Jefferies. The 1990s brought about further success in the first half of the decade, and later struggles in the latter half. In the 1991 County Championship season Hampshire won the NatWest Trophy, defeating Surrey by 4 wickets, with Shaun Udal claiming the man of the match award. This was the clubs first one day honour in this competition. Hampshire again repeated their 1988 success in the Benson & Hedges Cup by winning the 1992 competition. In the final at Lord's they beat Kent by 41 runs, including 90 runs from Robin Smith and three wickets each from Malcolm Marshall and Shaun Udal.  This marked Hampshire's second success in the competition. In 1996 Malcolm Marshall returned to coach the club. In 1997 work begun on Hampshire's long-awaited new ground. The realisation of this move almost led the club to financial ruin, as encouragement from financial partners Sport England and the hiring of architect Sir Michael Hopkins had led the then part-time voluntary committee running the club to lose control of the budget."]}, {"page": "Mike Taylor", "response": ["Mike Taylor may refer to:", "* Mike Taylor (musician) (1938\u20131969), British jazz pianist and songwriter", "* Mike Taylor (guitarist) (1948\u20132010), American songwriter and archaeologist", "* Mike Taylor (racing driver) (1934\u20132017), Formula One driver", "* Mike Taylor (cricketer, born 1942), English cricketer", "* Mike Taylor (cricketer, born 1944), English cricketer", "* Mike Taylor (offensive tackle) (born 1945), American football offensive tackle", "* Mike Taylor (linebacker, born 1949), American football linebacker", "* Mike Taylor (linebacker, born 1989), Wisconsin Badgers linebacker", "* Mike Taylor (basketball coach) (born 1972), American basketball coach", "* Mike Taylor (basketball) (born 1986), American basketball guard", "* Mike Taylor (swimmer) (born 1964), British multiple sclerosis activist", "* Mike Taylor (Montana politician) (born 1941), American politician", "* Mike Taylor (public servant), Australian"]}, {"page": "Derek Taylor (cricketer)", "response": ["Taylor's twin brother Mike Taylor played for Nottinghamshire and Hampshire."]}, {"page": "Alf Pope", "response": ["Pope umpired one first-class match in 1951.
