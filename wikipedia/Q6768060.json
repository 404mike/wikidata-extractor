He was arrested after an eight-day nationwide manhunt involving more than 500 police officers and twelve police forces, during which time he was Britain's \"most wanted man\".Police discovered notes written by Hobson that showed the murders were premeditated and well-planned, including a 'to-do' note detailing how he planned to lure his girlfriend's twin sister to his flat and a shopping list for \"big bin liners\", tape, tie-wraps, fly spray and air freshener. Against his girlfriend's sister's name he had written \"use and abuse at will.\" The list of planned victims also included his girlfriend's parents and the parents of his ex-wife.Hobson was tried for the murders in April 2005. Pleading guilty, he was sentenced to four terms of life imprisonment with a recommendation that he should never be released. This was one of the first times that such a recommendation had been made for someone who had admitted their crime at the first opportunity.
