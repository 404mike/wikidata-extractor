More cotton mills were built close to the Hindsford and Shakerley Brooks which provided water for steam power. In 1823, after a strike for increased wages and lockout by the millowners at New Mills, owned by J & G Jones in Factory Street, the workforce was sacked and new hands hired to replace them. The scab labourers, knobsticks had to be protected from assault by the dismissed workers. Joseph Wilson built Hope Mill in James Street. By 1838 James Burton owned most of the town's mills. He lived in Charles Street surrounded by his workers' houses. His company owned 74\u00a0cottages and 57\u00a0cellars, a house in Elliot Street and the King's Arms public house. Burton died in 1868. In 1883 a fire at Burton's mills caused \u00a315,000 damage (equivalent to \u00a3 in ) and by 1920 his mills were demolished. Caleb Wright owned Barnfield Mills which had a workforce of about 800. The last of his mills, Barnfield No 6 on Shuttle Street, was built in 1894 on the site of Resolution Mill which was destroyed by fire in 1891. Barnfield No 6 was a concrete-floored multi-storey mill for spinning, powered by an external engine house via a rope race. The mill was demolished in the 1990s and the site is occupied by a supermarket.", "Under the terms of the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 the townships formed part of the Leigh Poor Law Union comprising an area covering the whole of the ancient parish of Leigh and part of Winwick, established on 26 January 1837. A workhouse in Tyldesley was replaced by Leigh Union workhouse at Atherleigh in the 1850s. Tyldesley was constituted a civil parish in 1866. In 1863 the Local Government Act 1858 was adopted and the township was governed by a local board of health. The first Tyldesley Local Board was formed after elections on 24 October 1863. Among those elected were mill owners, Caleb Wright and Oliver Burton, and colliery owners, William Ramsden and George Green, a mixture of Tories and Liberals. The Local Board took over the gas works in 1865, built the first swimming baths and opened Tyldesley Cemetery in 1876 and built sewage works at Morleys Hall in Astley in 1884. The local board offices were in Lower Elliot Street, where it had a fire station and depot. Under the Public Health Act 1875 the local board gained additional powers as an urban sanitary district and under the Local Government Act 1894 Tyldesley-with-Shakerley became an urban district with an elected council. Tyldesley Town Hall, originally the township's Liberal Club, opened in 1881, and was taken over by Tyldesley Urban District Council as its headquarters in 1924. Tyldesley UDC opened Tyldesley Park in 1902, the Carnegie Library officially opened in 1909, and after World War I council housing was built at Sale Lane and Mosley Common and after World War II in Shakerley.", "The idea for a public swimming baths came from millowner, Caleb Wright. The local board built the baths in Union Street at a cost of \u00a31,300 (\u00a3 in ) and they opened to great celebrations in 1876. Tyldesley Swimming Club was formed as soon as the baths opened. Two members of Tyldesley Swimming and Water Polo Club represented Great Britain in Olympic Games. Addin Tyldesley, competed in the 1908 Summer Olympics in London and Duncan Cleworth competed in the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal. The baths closed on health grounds in 1960 and the closed Majestic Cinema on Castle Street was converted into public baths in 1964. The pool is now the Pelican Centre."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1892 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Caleb Wright "]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1886 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Caleb Wright"]}, {"page": "United Kingdom general election records", "response": ["*Caleb Wright, 1885: 75"]}, {"page": "List of people from Wigan", "response": ["*Caleb Wright (18101898), Member of Parliament and mill owner who built Barnfield Mills in Tyldesley"]}, {"page": "Tyldesley Loopline", "response": ["Coal, and the many collieries that were being developed in the area, was the chief motivation for building a railway in the area and the railway's supporters included many local colliery owners and industrialists.
