He was chairman of Harland and Wolff, shipbuilders, between 1895 and 1924, and also served as Lord Mayor of Belfast between 1896 and 1898. He was ennobled as Baron Pirrie in 1906, appointed a Knight of the Order of St Patrick in 1908 and made Viscount Pirrie in 1921. In the months leading up to the 1912 Titanic disaster, Lord Pirrie was questioned about the number of life boats aboard the Olympic-class ships. He responded that the great ships were unsinkable and the rafts were to save others. This would haunt him forever. In Belfast he was, on other grounds, already a controversial figure: a Protestant employer associated as a leading Liberal with a policy of Home Rule for Ireland.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "June 7", "response": ["*1924 \u2013 William Pirrie, 1st Viscount Pirrie, Irish businessman and politician, Lord Mayor of Belfast (b. 1847)"]}, {"page": "May 31", "response": ["*1847 \u2013 William Pirrie, 1st Viscount Pirrie, Canadian-Irish businessman and politician, Lord Mayor of Belfast (d. 1924) "]}, {"page": "William James Pirrie, Viscount Pirrie", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Pirrie, 1st Viscount Pirrie"]}, {"page": "Lord Pirrie", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Pirrie, 1st Viscount Pirrie"]}, {"page": "William Pirrie, Viscount Pirrie", "response": ["#redirect William Pirrie, 1st Viscount Pirrie"]}, {"page": "Lord pirrie", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Pirrie, 1st Viscount Pirrie"]}, {"page": "William Pirrie", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Pirrie, 1st Viscount Pirrie"]}, {"page": "1924 in Ireland", "response": ["*6 June \u2013 William Pirrie, 1st Viscount Pirrie, shipbuilder and businessman (born 1847 in Canada; died at sea)."]}, {"page": "List of people from Belfast", "response": ["* William Pirrie, 1st Viscount Pirrie, shipbuilder and politician"]}, {"page": "Viscount Pirrie", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Pirrie, 1st Viscount Pirrie"]}, {"page": "Baron Pirrie", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Pirrie, 1st Viscount Pirrie"]}, {"page": "Belfast City Cemetery", "response": ["* William Pirrie, 1st Viscount Pirrie"]}, {"page": "William Pirrie, 1st Baron Pirrie", "response": ["#Redirect William Pirrie, 1st Viscount Pirrie"]}, {"page": "William James Pirrie", "response": ["#REDIRECT William Pirrie, 1st Viscount Pirrie"]}, {"page": "1924 in Northern Ireland", "response": ["*6 June \u2013 William Pirrie, 1st Viscount Pirrie, shipbuilder and businessman (born 1847)."]}, {"page": "Witley Park", "response": ["The remnants of Lea Park were sold to William Pirrie, 1st Viscount Pirrie, notable for his role in the building of RMS Titanic.

The estate was renamed from Lea Park to Witley Park by the Leigh family, later owners, perhaps to avoid the confusion with Lea/Leigh. Witley Park House, a Modern movement home designed by Patrick Gwynne,RIBA photographs was built elsewhere on the estate in 1961.  The landscaped park remained.
