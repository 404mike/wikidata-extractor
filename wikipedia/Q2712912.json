After World War II, Thuringia became part of Soviet-controlled East Germany; Lange went across the border to West Germany, where he studied art before moving to the United States in 1951. Upon arriving in the United States, Lange worked in advertising. During the Korean War, Lange worked for the U.S. military, illustrating flying manuals.Subsequently, he began working at the Army Ballistic Missile Agency and then headed the future projects section at NASA, working on spacecraft designs alongside Wernher von Braun. Whilst at NASA, Lange met the author Arthur C. Clarke, who introduced him to the film director Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick offered Lange a job at his production company, using his astronautical design experience to produce authentic prop and set designs for a project Kubrick and Clarke were working on entitled Journey to the Stars. The project was renamed as 2001: A Space Odyssey (released in 1968), and the film's design team, including Lange, were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Art Direction. Although 2001 lost to Oliver!, Lange and his team did win the BAFTA Award for Best Production Design in that year.\nAlthough best known for 2001, Lange worked on a number of well-known films during his career. He was art director for the James Bond film Moonraker, and an astronautical consultant on Superman II. He worked on the three first Star Wars films, as an art director and set decorator for The Empire Strikes Back (for which he was again nominated for the Art Direction Oscar) and Return of the Jedi respectively; he also worked on the original Star Wars, although his work was uncredited. He worked as a production designer on two films for the Jim Henson Company: The Great Muppet Caper (1981) and The Dark Crystal (1982). He was also production designer for the last Monty Python film Monty Python's The Meaning of Life.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Academy Award for Best Production Design", "response": ["| Anthony Masters, Harry Lange and Ernest Archer", "| Norman Reynolds, Leslie Dilley, Harry Lange and Alan Tomkins"]}, {"page": "Eisenach", "response": ["*Harry Lange (film designer) (1930\u20132008)"]}, {"page": "Moon landing conspiracy theories", "response": ["Filmmaker Stanley Kubrick is accused of having produced much of the footage for Apollos 11 and 12, presumably because he had just directed 2001: A Space Odyssey, which is partly set on the Moon and featured advanced special effects. It has been claimed that when 2001 was in post-production in early 1968, NASA secretly approached Kubrick to direct the first three Moon landings. The launch and splashdown would be real but the spacecraft would stay in Earth orbit and fake footage broadcast as \"live from the Moon.\" No evidence was offered for this theory, which overlooks many facts. For example, 2001 was released before the first Apollo landing and Kubrick's depiction of the Moon's surface differs greatly from its appearance in the Apollo footage. The movement of characters on the Moon in 2001 differs from that of the filmed movement of Apollo astronauts, and does not resemble an environment with 1/6 the gravity of Earth. Several scenes in 2001 show dust billowing as spacecraft landed, something that would not happen in the vacuum environment of the Moon. Kubrick did hire Frederick Ordway and Harry Lange, both of whom had worked for NASA and major aerospace contractors, to work with him on 2001. Kubrick also used some 50\u00a0mm f/0.7 lenses that were left over from a batch made by Zeiss for NASA. However, Kubrick only got this lens for Barry Lyndon (1975). The lens was originally a still photo lens and needed changes to be used for motion filming."]}, {"page": "2008 in film", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 22 || Harry Lange || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 77 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| Germany || style=\"text-align:center;\"| Production Designer || "]}, {"page": "41st Academy Awards", "response": ["**2001: A Space Odyssey\u00a0\u2013 Art Direction and Set Decoration: Anthony Masters, Harry Lange and Ernest Archer"]}, {"page": "53rd Academy Awards", "response": ["**The Empire Strikes Back \u2013 Art Direction: Norman Reynolds, Leslie Dilley, Harry Lange and Alan Tomkins; Set Decoration: Michael Ford"]}, {"page": "BAFTA Award for Best Production Design", "response": ["| style=\"background:#ccc;\"| 2001: A Space Odyssey || style=\"background:#ccc;\"| Ernest Archer, Harry Lange, and Anthony Masters"]}, {"page": "Norman Reynolds", "response": ["*1981 Academy Award for Best Production Design - The Empire Strikes Back (shared with Leslie Dilley, Harry Lange, Alan Tomkins and Michael D.
