The story is told that his birthplace was said to be Wellington, without mentioning that it was not the Somerset market town but the city in New Zealand; in fact, this was how Somerset had skirted the regulations for Peter Randall Johnson before World War I.Francis, p. 44."]}, {"page": "Randy Johnson (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Peter Randall Johnson (1880\u20131956), British cricketer"]}, {"page": "Marylebone Cricket Club cricket team in New Zealand in 1906\u201307", "response": ["*Peter Randall Johnson"]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* Peter Randall Johnson (1901\u20131927) 229 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Reggie Ingle", "response": ["From 1927, Ingle played regularly for Somerset for 11 seasons, never appearing in less than 21 games a year.

He put on 189 for the first wicket with the dashing Peter Randall Johnson, who made 123 of the runs; Rippon was, by implication in Wisden's report, much slower, though his runs came in 190 minutes. His highest innings was 133 against Worcestershire at the Knowle ground in 1927, the runs being made out of 314 runs while he was at the wicket: he \"wore down the attack\", wrote Wisden, and \"showed such patience in waiting for the right ball to hit that he did not give a chance\".
