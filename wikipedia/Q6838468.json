A caf\u00e9 racer is a motorcycle that has been modified for speed and good handling rather than for comfort.The Caf\u00e9 Racer Phenomenon (Those were the days...), Alastair Walker. Veloce Publishing 2009.  Features include: a single racing seat, low handlebars (such as ace bars or one-sided clip-ons mounted directly onto the front forks for control and aerodynamics), large racing petrol tanks (aluminium ones were often polished and left unpainted), swept-back exhaust pipes, rear-set footpegs (to give better clearance while cornering at high speeds) with or without half or full race fairings.Reg Everett and Mick Walker. Rocker to Racer.  Breedon Books. 2010. ", "The term cafe racers is now also used to describe motorcycle riders who prefer vintage British, Italian or Japanese motorbikes from the 1950s to late 1970s. These modern caf\u00e9 racers do not resemble the rockers of earlier decades, and they dress in a more modern and comfortable style, with only a hint of likeness to the rocker style, nor do they share the passion for 50s rock'n'roll. These modern caf\u00e9 racers have taken elements of the American greaser, British rocker, and modern motorcycle rider styles to create a look of their own.Clay, Mike.

Rockers also transformed rock and roll dancing into a more violent, individualistic form beyond the control of dance hall management. They were generally reviled by the British motorcycle industry and general enthusiasts as being as an embarrassment and bad for the industry and the sport.The Bsa Gold Star, Mick Walker.
