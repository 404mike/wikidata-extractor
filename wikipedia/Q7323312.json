According to Johnston, the mini-series Vigilante, which was supposed to be Wright's writing debut in the DC Universe, was already causing internal concern at the company due to the direction and tone of the title, as the titular character eschewed taking down street criminals or organized crime in favor of corporate criminals, and the controversy made it easier to take Wright off the book. Wright responded by stating that the quality of his work was not an issue. Meanwhile, Seven Stories Press, the publisher of You Back the Attack, removed Wright's introduction from the subsequent printings of the book and cancelled its follow-up volume, If You're Not a Terrorist... Then Stop Asking Questions, but eventually published the third collection of his poster work in 2006. That same year, the Vigilante mini-series, which was never officially confirmed as cancelled, was published with a new creative team and plotline. In a 2012 interview, Wright stated that following the controversy, he was privately told by the representatives of Marvel and DC that he has been blacklisted at both companies."]}, {"page": "Oni Press", "response": ["Oni Press used the term \"real mainstream,\" coined by Stephen Holland of the UK comic shop Page 45, to suggest that the subject matter it publishes is more in line with the popular genres of other media, such as thrillers, romances and realistic drama.
