It is believed that Pott's standard of living was a contributor to the rise of the surgeon within social standings.", "Percivall Pott's dedication to his patients and standard of care garnered Pott high praise and fame. He is generally regarded as one of the two greatest surgeons of the 18th century along with his student John Hunter. In 1786, he was honoured as the first Honorary Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. Shortly after, he retired in 1787 and was named a governor of St. Bartholomew's Hospital.", "Percivall Pott has influenced medicine and modern understanding of diseases. Many diseases today are his namesake including: Pott's fracture, Pott's disease of the spine, and Pott's puffy tumor. One disease which does not, yet is important to Pott's legacy is chimney sweeper's carcinoma. Pott quickly recognised the association between carcinoma and chimney sweeps and published his findings in a piece titled \"Chirurgical Observations relative to\u2026the cancer of the scrotum.\"  From  p. 67:  \"The disease, in these people [i.e., chimney sweeps], seems to derive its origin from a lodgment of soot in the rugae of the scrotum, \u2026 \" He wrote that the disease was, \" peculiar to a certain sort of people [ and ] which has not at least to my knowledge, been publicly noticed \u2013 I mean the chimney-sweepers \u2019 cancer.

Pott was viewed as a mentor and even allowed other physicians and surgeons to live with him while under his guidance. Despite the surgical trends of his time, Pott did not agree with severe treatments and heroic medicine but rather preferred gentler forms. Percivall Pott's son-in-law, James Earle, described Pott's surgery as being \"divested of great part of its horrors, became, comparatively, a pleasing study.\"", "Percivall Pott's work influenced a wave of researcher and change in public policies. After his initial publication, more clinical cases began to emerge rapidly over the following years. This triggered a series of \"Chimney Sweepers' Acts\" which aimed to protect chimney sweepers. These facilitated the formation of societies like the \"Society for Superseding the Necessity of Climbing Boys, by Encouraging a New Method of Sweeping Chimneys and for Improving the Condition of Children and Others Employed by Chimney Sweepers\" in 1803 which included the likes of Dukes, Earls, and Royal Patrons.", "* Dobson, J., 'Percivall Pott' in Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, vol. 50 (1972), pp.\u00a054\u201365", "* History of Surgeons \u2013 Percivall Pott. surgeons.org.uk England", "* Article on Percivall Pott in Who Named It", "* Sir Percivall Pott.
