He was born in Liverpool, and educated at Oscott College in Birmingham.  He was articled to E. W. Pugin in London, then became an assistant to John Douglas in Chester.  He travelled abroad in France and Belgium, and had started to practice independently in Liverpool by 1867, initially having offices in Derby Buildings, Fenwick Street.  Between 1880 and 1914, his offices were in Union Buildings, Cook Street, Liverpool.  In 1905 Kirkby took his two sons, Francis Joseph and Edmund Bertram, into partnership.  He retired in 1917, and died in 1920.  His practice continued after his death, until it merged with Matthews and Goodman in 2011.Most of Kirby's works were in Northwest England, with occasional examples in North Wales, Staffordshire, Shropshire, and elsewhere.  He was an architect to the Roman Catholic Church, and most of his ecclesiastical works were for this denomination.  His most notable work in this genre is the Sodality Chapel for St Francis Xavier's Church, Liverpool. In 1869 he designed Sacred Heart Church in Hindsford which Pevsner described as a \"pretty church\".  His Anglican churches include St Michael and All Angels, Little Leigh, and St Cross, Appleton Thorn.  He also designed and carried out work on commercial and domestic properties, including Dee House, Chester.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Eleanor cross", "response": ["*The Queen Victoria Monument, Birkenhead, Wirral, Merseyside, designed by Edmund Kirby, was unveiled in 1905.

The foundation stone was laid in 1842 and Joseph John Scoles was appointed as architect. Scoles went on to design the Church of the Immaculate Conception, Farm Street in London, St Ignatius Church in Preston, and was the father of Ignatius Scoles, SJ, who designed St Wilfrid's Church also in Preston. The church opened on 4 December 1848. The spire was added in 1883. The church had been designed to hold 1,000\u00a0people but this proved to be insufficient for the congregation and in 1888 an additional chapel, the Sodality Chapel designed by Edmund Kirby, was opened. In 1898 the wall dividing the Sodality Chapel from the main part of the church was demolished.", "The high altar and reredos are in white Caen limestone and include arcades and pinnacles; they were designed by S.\u00a0J.\u00a0Nicholl.

The pulpit is made of Caen stone and an elaborate font is situated at the west end of the nave below the organ loft.

With the growing popularity of sea bathing from the mid eighteenth century onwards, the existing small settlement of fishing families grew into the seaside resort of Hoylake. This development was very much the work of the major landowning family, the Stanleys. The Stanleys constructed Hoylake's first hotel (called \"The Royal\") in 1792, on what is now Stanley Road, Hoylake. Close by, they established a racecourse on the land now occupied by the golf links of the Royal Liverpool Golf Club. The growing population suggested the construction of a church for the area and in 1833 Holy Trinity Church was opened on what is now Trinity Road, Hoylake. In 1860, Hoylake became a separate parish from West Kirby. In the years following the creation of the parish, the local population grew rapidly. This was largely due to the opening of the railway line in 1866 connecting Hoylake to Birkenhead and later Liverpool. The growing population of Hoylake meant that by the 1890s, Holy Trinity Church was too small to accommodate all the worshipers.
