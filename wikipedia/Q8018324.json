He was also a member of the landed gentry. He was a Member of the British parliament for Dundalk in 1835\u20131837 and for Rochdale in 1841\u20131852. He was High Sheriff of Down for 1811.\nIn 1848 with James MacKnight, editor of the liberal Londonderry Standard, Crawford formed the Tenant Right Association supported by a group of radical Presbyterian ministers. He also supported MaKnight in forming, with Charles Gavan Duffy, editor of the Young Ireland paper The Nation, the all-Ireland Tenant Right League.He was the father of James Sharman Crawford, one of the Members of the British parliament for Down, 1874-1878, Arthur Sharman Crawford, unsuccessful candidate for Down in 1884 and John Sharman Crawford, unsuccessful candidate for Down in 1880 His daughter was Mabel Sharman Crawford, adventurer, feminist and writer.\nHe died at Crawfordsburn.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland", "response": ["Irish demands ranged from the \"repeal\" of O'Connell, the \"federal scheme\" of William Sharman Crawford (actually devolution, not federalism as such), to the Home Rule League of Isaac Butt.

In Monaghan, the Rev. David Bell was to find that of his 100 Presbyterian congregants who had signed the requisition asking John Gray to stand in their constituency only 11 voted for him.

For all eleven accused in the death of fourteen constables in the Carrickshock incident, O'Connell helped secure acquittals. Yet fearful of embarrassing his Whig allies, in 1838 he rejected the call of the Protestant tenant-righter William Sharman Crawford for the complete elimination of the Church of Ireland levy. O'Connell accepted the Tithe Commutation Act. This did effectively exempt the majority of cultivators\u2014those who held land at will or from year to year\u2014from the charge, while offering those still liable relief: a 25 percent reduction and a forgiveness of arrears. On the other hand, it transferred the onus for its collection from the church minister to the landlord who had the authority to evict and a still unchecked freedom to appropriate any and all tenant surpluses through increased rent.", "In what Duffy hailed as a \"League of North and South\" in 1852 tenant protection societies helped return 50 MPs.
