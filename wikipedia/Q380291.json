It is further claimed that English soldiers who provided support in Antwerp against the Spanish in 1585, during the Eighty Years' War, were already drinking jenever for its calming effects before battle, from which the term Dutch courage is believed to have originated. According to some unconfirmed accounts, gin originated in Italy."]}, {"page": "March 17", "response": ["*1640  \u2013 Philip Massinger, English playwright (b. 1583)"]}, {"page": "November 24", "response": ["*  1583   \u2013 Philip Massinger, English dramatist (d. 1640)"]}, {"page": "1640", "response": ["* March 17 \u2013 Philip Massinger, English dramatist (b. 1583)"]}, {"page": "1620s", "response": ["* Philip Massinger of England (1583\u20131640), playwright"]}, {"page": "1583", "response": ["** Philip Massinger, English dramatist (d. 1640)"]}, {"page": "English Renaissance theatre", "response": ["The profession of dramatist was challenging and far from lucrative. Entries in Philip Henslowe's Diary show that in the years around 1600 Henslowe paid as little as \u00a36 or \u00a37 per play. This was probably at the low end of the range, though even the best writers could not demand too much more. A playwright, working alone, could generally produce two plays a year at most. In the 1630s Richard Brome signed a contract with the Salisbury Court Theatre to supply three plays a year, but found himself unable to meet the workload. Shakespeare produced fewer than 40 solo plays in a career that spanned more than two decades: he was financially successful because he was an actor and, most importantly, a shareholder in the company for which he acted and in the theatres they used. Ben Jonson achieved success as a purveyor of Court masques, and was talented at playing the patronage game that was an important part of the social and economic life of the era. Those who were purely playwrights fared far less well: the biographies of early figures like George Peele and Robert Greene, and later ones like Brome and Philip Massinger, are marked by financial uncertainty, struggle, and poverty.", "  bar:Massinger   text:Philip Massinger", "*Philip Massinger"]}, {"page": "Rollo", "response": ["Rollo is the subject of the 17th-century play Rollo Duke of Normandy, written by John Fletcher, Philip Massinger, Ben Jonson, and George Chapman."]}, {"page": "Cunt", "response": ["Cunny was probably derived from a pun on coney, meaning \"rabbit\", rather as pussy is connected to the same term for a cat.
