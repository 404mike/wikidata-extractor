He joined Manchester United in May 1919, and made his debut for the club in the first Manchester derby on 11 October 1919, as a replacement for Lal Hilditch, who was away on international duty. Able to play in all three half-back positions, he was a utility player for the club. He helped United gain promotion to the First Division in the 1924-25 season. However, he suffered a knee injury for most of the next season, and needed to undergo an operation. In 1925-26, he played at centre-half regularly, sharing the position with Frank Barson.
