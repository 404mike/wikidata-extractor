He co-founded audio publisher Talking Music in 2012, publishing books on Eminem, Jimi Hendrix, The Beatles, Glam rock, Acid house, Adele, The Clash and others, written and read by authors such as Charles Shaar Murray, Jane Bussmann and Barney Hoskyns. In 2018, he was commissioned by the Imperial War Museum/14-18 NOW to explore the role of Ireland's borderland communities in the First World War for The Art of Border Living, featuring BBC documentaries and commissioned short story podcasts from Irish authors. With co-writer Patrick Marber, Curran created Bunk Bed (radio programme), a series of bizarre late-night conversations recorded in beds and in the dark, featuring music, archive speech and occasional guests such as Cate Blanchett and Benjamin Zephaniah. First broadcast in April 2014 on BBC Radio 4, Series 9 was aired in January 2022 with guest Harry Shearer.
