Hulme failed to win promotion for the club, although Spurs managed to stay in the top half of the Second Division for the three seasons he was manager, and they reached the semi-final of the FA Cup in 1948. Players who joined the squad under Hulme include Eddie Baily, Len Duquemin, Harry Clarke and Charlie Withers.  Football was popular in the post-war era, and although in the three post-war seasons during which Spurs languished in the Second Division, some games still drew large crowds, particularly for cup ties. Hulme was sacked after he refused a suggestion to resign following an illness in March 1949."]}, {"page": "Harry Clarke (footballer born 1923)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Harry Clarke (footballer, born 1923)"]}]}}
