Hearne or Old Jack Hearne to avoid confusion with J. W. Hearne to whom he was distantly related) was a Middlesex and England medium-fast bowler. His aggregate of 3061 first-class wickets is the greatest for any bowler of medium pace or above, and his 257 wickets in 1896 is the tenth highest total on record. In 1891, 1896, 1898, 1904 and 1910 Hearne headed the first-class bowling averages.\nIn his heyday he was a truly great bowler able to gain vigorous off-break from even the most docile wickets. Hearne was also able to vary his pace and bowl a fast ball that swerved at a time when the skill was not well known. He had a long run for the time and a classic, full-on, high action that gave him higher bounce on hard, very fast wickets than most bowlers of the 1890s. His ability to thrive on hard work was seen in the dry summer of 1896 when he bowled over 10,000 balls \u2013 a feat performed previously only by Alfred Shaw, whilst in 1898 Hearne bowled over 9000 balls in a wetter summer.\nHe was a dependable field near the wicket at a time when catching was the most vital part of fielding, and could occasionally prove a useful batsman in a crisis.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "April 17", "response": ["*1944 \u2013 J.

He made his Test debut in the five-match series against Australia, playing in three of the five Tests; his first Test coincided with W. G. Grace's last. As well as Grace, his teammates included C. B. Fry, K. S. Ranjitsinhji, and George Hirst. Rhodes opened the English bowling and took four wickets for 58 in an Australian total of 252; his first Test wicket was Monty Noble (whose wicket he took again in the second innings). He was described by Wisden as bowling \"steady and well\" on the first day. Rhodes took three wickets in the second Test, but the selectors omitted him from the third match, a decision Wisden believed was mistaken. He did not play again until the final Test, and he finished with 13 wickets in the series, equal with J. T. Hearne as England's leading Test wicket-taker for the summer. Rhodes was also selected to represent the Players against the Gentlemen at Lord's for the first time that season, although W. G. Grace and C. B.

This was contrary to most wicket-keepers of the time, who had gradually started standing further and further away from the wickets to give themselves more time to react to take catches. At the end of the 1901 tour, Halliwell played three additional matches. He played one match for London County, before appearing for his county of birth, Middlesex, in a county match against Essex. In this match, he took two catches and a stumping, all off the bowling of J. T. Hearne, and according to Wisden, he \"was seen at quite his best\".
