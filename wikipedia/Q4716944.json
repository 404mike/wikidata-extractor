Starting in 2000, he worked in the accident and emergency department in the Newtownards and then the Ulster Hospital as a clerical officer. \nA Democratic Unionist Party politician, he was first elected to North Down Borough Council in 2001 and left Council in December 2013.\nHe was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly in 2003 for the constituency of North Down and returned again in 2007, 2011, 2016 and again in 2017 where he topped the poll for North Down increasing his vote each Election. Easton stood in the 2017 Westminster election and polled 14,940 votes, nearly unseating the siting MP. In the 2019 Westminster election he stood once again in the constituency but was defeated by Stephen Farry of the Alliance Party.\nEaston is opposed to a border poll and has said those politically backing a backstop through Brexit could potentially lead to a border poll and is a threat to the Union, which must be opposed. Easton is also opposed to the Northern Ireland protocol.\nEaston supported a bill to help those with autism, saying, \"Of all the legislation that the Assembly has passed, this Bill means most to me. It is the one that I will probably remember best from the past four years, and I hope that I have helped to play a small part in moving it forward.\"Married, he is a member of the Orange Order and the Church of Ireland.
