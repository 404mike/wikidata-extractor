The German attack followed a hurricane bombardment and was covered by morning mist, and quickly overran the defences of the division's Forward Zone.Middlebrook, pp. 91, 192\u20133, 232\u20134. 2/4th Leicesters had only just come out of the line after 24 hours of continuous trench duty. It was sent straight back up to assist in the defence of Ecoust, but the leading company found that the village had already fallen, and was unable to do more than cover the retreat of the gunners of a field battery which had removed the breechblocks of their guns before being overrun. The battalion could get no further forward than the rear of the Battle Zone. Here the 'line' was no more than a yet-to-be-dug trench marked out with the turf removed and no barbed wire. The men extended along the line but were completely exposed in the open. An officer stood in the \u00c9coust road, stopping stragglers and directing them to join the Leicesters. Under the inspiring leadership of their CO, Lt-Col Sir Iain Colquhoun, 7th Baronet, and Regimental Sergeant-Major 'African Joe' Withers, the battalion held off the Germans for the rest of the day, with modest casualties of 12 killed and 18 wounded.Middlebrook, pp. 251\u20132.Edmonds, 1918, Vol I, pp. 228\u201334.", "* Sir Iain Colquhoun, 7th Baronet, Distinguished Service Order and Bar, from the Scots Guards, was Commanding Officer of 2/4th Battalion in 1918."]}]}}
