Soon after the departure, Beggs commented, \"It was a business decision and not one we took lightly. He wanted the band to go in a different direction to the rest of us. Eventually, we realised we were on a different planet to Limahl.\" Beggs also stated that the band harboured no ill-will towards Limahl, and blamed the press for sensationalising the matter.
