She was a gifted, well-educated musician with a beautiful voice and knew five languages. She gave Sunday concerts at her father's house, but her ambition was to become a professional actress, and despite fatherly disapproval, left home to go on the stage. She and Thicknesse had a son, Captain John Thicknesse.For more on Thicknesse see:  RN (c. 1763\u20131846). The couple spent time travelling in Europe. In later life he lived in the Royal Crescent, Bath, in a house he then let out and sold. He moved to another, St Catherine's Hermitage, and landscaped the grounds to create a \"hermit's cell\" for himself."]}, {"page": "The French Line", "response": ["|Anne Ford||Paris model"]}, {"page": "Ann Ford", "response": ["#REDIRECT Anne Ford"]}, {"page": "Richard Pockrich (inventor)", "response": ["The instrument was adopted by Gluck, who presented it on 23 April 1746 as \"a concerto on 26 drinking-glasses tuned with Spring water\", and performances were popular for half a century.

Officials from the National Portrait Gallery hailed the painting as a \"portrait of the '80s\" at its unveiling. Contemporary commentary focused on the depiction of Diana in trousers, then a novelty for a female member of the British royal family. In his book Eyewitnessing: The Uses of Images as Historical Evidence, Peter Burke describes the crossing of Diana's legs as taken as 'normal' in contrast to the shocked reaction of people to Thomas Gainsborough's 1760 portrait of the musician and singer Anne Ford."]}]}}
