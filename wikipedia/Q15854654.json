He was a Fellow of King's from 1897; and a Tutor at Fitzwilliam House, Cambridge from 1898 to 1907. He was also University Lecturer in History and Director of Scandinavian Studies; and Censor of Fitzwilliam House, Cambridge from 1907 to 1924.He was extremely helpful in the admission of Subhas Chandra Bose in Cambridge, and his efforts prevented the loss of a term for Bose due to the delay in his admission. Subhas Bose also consulted him before he resigned from the Indian Civil Service. Reddaway heartily approved of his ideas, although surprised. Agreeing with Bose, he said that he preferred a journalistic career to a monotonous one like the Civil Service.", "link_mentions": []}}
