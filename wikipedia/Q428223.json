He developed a compelling image as the charismatic rock-and-roll front man, similar to those of contemporaries such as Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones, Roger Daltrey of the Who, Jim Morrison of the Doors, and Freddie Mercury of Queen. With his mane of long blonde curly hair and powerful, bare-chested appearance, Plant helped to create the \"god of rock and roll\" or \"rock god\" archetype. Although Led Zeppelin dissolved in 1980, Plant has occasionally collaborated with Jimmy Page on various projects in later years, including Page and Plant, and the short-lived supergroup The Honeydrippers (with Jeff Beck).\nA powerful and wide vocal range (particularly evident in his high-registered vocals) has given Plant a successful singing career spanning more than 50 years. In 2008, Rolling Stone editors ranked him number 15 on their list of the 100 best singers of all time. In 2011, Rolling Stone readers ranked Plant the greatest of all lead singers. In 2006, Hit Parader magazine named Plant the \"Greatest Metal Vocalist of All Time\".

During the appearance, they re-emphasised that they intended never to officially reunite, citing the opinion of Robert Plant that the re-formed Led Zeppelin was more like a cover band of itself than the original band.

Jimmy Page uses a double dropped D guitar tuning similar to the alternative tunings Mitchell uses. The Sonic Youth song \"Hey Joni\" is named for Mitchell.

The group consisted of vocalist Robert Plant, guitarist Jimmy Page, bassist/keyboardist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. With a heavy, guitar-driven sound, they are cited as one of the progenitors of hard rock and heavy metal, although their style drew from a variety of influences, including blues and folk music. Led Zeppelin have been credited as significantly impacting the nature of the music industry, particularly in the development of album-oriented rock (AOR) and stadium rock.", "The Yardbirds played their final gig in July 1968 at Luton College of Technology in Bedfordshire. They were still committed to several concerts in Scandinavia, so drummer Jim McCarty and vocalist Keith Relf authorised Page and bassist Chris Dreja to use the Yardbirds' name to fulfill the band's obligations. Page and Dreja began putting a new line-up together. Page's first choice for the lead singer was Terry Reid, but Reid declined the offer and suggested Robert Plant, a singer for the Band of Joy and Hobbstweedle. Plant eventually accepted the position, recommending former Band of Joy drummer John Bonham.

This is said to be the beginning of a rift between the band members, as Jones was not even told of the reunion.", "According to musicologist Robert Walser, \"Led Zeppelin's sound was marked by speed and power, unusual rhythmic patterns, contrasting terraced dynamics, singer Robert Plant's wailing vocals, and guitarist Jimmy Page's heavily distorted crunch\". These elements mean that they are often cited as one of the originators of hard rock and heavy metal and they have been described as the \"definitive heavy metal band\", although the band members have often eschewed the label. Part of this reputation depends on the band's use of distorted guitar riffs on songs like \"Whole Lotta Love\" and \"The Wanton Song\". Often riffs were not doubled by guitar, bass and drums exactly, but instead there were melodic or rhythmic variations; as in \"Black Dog\", where three different time signatures are used. Page's guitar playing incorporated elements of the blues scale with those of eastern music. Plant's use of high-pitched shrieks has been compared to Janis Joplin's vocal technique. Robert Christgau found him integral to the group's heavy \"power blues\" aesthetic, functioning as a \"mechanical effect\" similarly to Page's guitar parts. While noting Plant \"hints at real feeling\" on some of their acoustic songs, Christgau believed he abandoned traditional blues singing's emphasis on emotional projection in favor of vocal precision and dynamics: \"Whether he is mouthing sexist blues cliches or running through one of the band's half-audible, half-comprehensible ... lyrics about chivalry or the counter-culture, his voice is devoid of feeling. Like the tenors and baritones of yore, he wants his voice to be an instrument\u2014specifically, an electric guitar.\" Bonham's drumming was noted for its power, his rapid rolls and his fast beats on a single bass drum; while Jones' basslines have been described as melodic and his keyboard playing added a classical touch to the band's sound.", "* Robert Plant \u2013 lead vocals, harmonica (1968\u20131980, 1985, 1988, 1995, 2007)"]}, {"page": "Lead Belly", "response": ["In 2015, in celebration of Lead Belly's 125th birthday, several events were held.

In late 1938 John Hammond sought him out for a concert at Carnegie Hall, From Spirituals to Swing, only to discover that Johnson had died.

Musicologist Alan Lomax went to Mississippi in 1941 to record Johnson, also not knowing of his death. Law, who by then worked for Columbia Records, assembled a collection of Johnson's recordings titled King of the Delta Blues Singers that was released by Columbia in 1961. It is widely credited with finally bringing Johnson's  work to a wider audience. The album would become influential, especially on the nascent British blues movement; Eric Clapton has called Johnson \"the most important blues singer that ever lived.\" Musicians such as Bob Dylan, Keith Richards, and Robert Plant have cited both Johnson's lyrics and musicianship as key influences on their own work.

Plant had spent holidays there with his family.", "\"Gallows Pole\" is an updated arrangement of a traditional folk song called \"The Maid Freed from the Gallows\", inspired by a version recorded by Fred Gerlach. Page played a variety of acoustic and electric guitars and banjo, while Jones played mandolin as well as bass. It was reworked by Page and Plant for their 1994 album No Quarter: Jimmy Page and Robert Plant Unledded.", "A positive review came from Robert Christgau, who originally assigned it an A-minus grade and wrote in his \"Consumer Guide\" review for The Village Voice: \"I have always approved theoretically of Led Zep's concept, and now the group has finally whipped it into shape. It's amazing to realize that Robert Plant's vocals can convey that same overbearing power when Page plays acoustic, as he does to great effect on several cuts here. No drum solos, either. Heavy.\"", "*Robert Plant\u00a0\u2013 vocals"]}, {"page": "Led Zeppelin IV", "response": ["\"Black Dog\" was named after a dog that hung around Headley Grange during recording. The riff was written by Page and Jones, while the a cappella section was influenced by Fleetwood Mac's \"Oh Well\". Vocalist Robert Plant wrote the lyrics, and later sang portions of the song during solo concerts. The guitar solos on the outro were recorded directly into the desk, without using an amplifier.", "\"Four Sticks\" took its title from Bonham playing the drum pattern that runs throughout the song with four drum sticks, and Jones played analog synth. The track was difficult to record compared to the other material on the album, requiring numerous takes. It was played live only once by Led Zeppelin, and re-recorded with the Bombay Symphony Orchestra in 1972. It was reworked for Page and Plant's 1994 album No Quarter: Jimmy Page and Robert Plant Unledded.", "\"When the Levee Breaks\" comes from a blues song recorded by Memphis Minnie and Kansas Joe McCoy in 1929. The track opens with Bonham's heavy unaccompanied drumming, which was recorded in the lobby of Headley Grange using two Beyerdynamic M 160 microphones which were hung up a flight of stairs; output from these were passed to a limiter. A Binson Echorec, a delay effects unit, was also used. Page recalled he had tried to record the track at early sessions, but it had sounded flat. The unusual locations around the lobby gave the ideal ambience for the drum sound. This introduction was later extensively sampled for hip hop music in the 1980s.

Several songs subsequently became fixtures in the group's live set, including \"The Song Remains the Same\", \"The Rain Song\" and \"No Quarter\".

While mocking the solemnity of \"No Quarter\" and finding some tracks derivative of previous albums, he found side one \"solid led\" with \"sprung rhythm\" and a \"James Brown tribute/parody/ripoff\" in \"The Crunge\" that complements the second side's \"two amazing, well, dance tracks\" in \"Dancing Dayss \"transmogrified shuffle\" and the reggae of \"D'yer Mak'er\". \"Throughout the record, the band's playing is excellent,\" wrote AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine, \"making the eclecticism of Page and Robert Plant's songwriting sound coherent and natural.\"", "*Robert Plant\u00a0\u2013 lead vocals"]}, {"page": "Physical Graffiti", "response": ["The group reconvened at Headley Grange in January and February 1974, where they recorded eight tracks engineered by Ron Nevison. Lead singer Robert Plant later referred to these eight tracks as \"the belters\", including \"off-the-wall stuff that turned out really nice\". As with previous sessions at Headley Grange, the informal atmosphere allowed the group to improvise and develop material while recording. Sometimes the group would rehearse or record a track several times, discuss what went wrong or what could be improved and then realised they had worked out an alternative arrangement for it which was better. Bonham was a driving force at the sessions, regularly suggesting ideas or the best ways in which a complicated arrangement could be played successfully. This led to him getting a lead songwriting credit on several tracks.", "NMEs Nick Kent reviewed the album three months before it was released. He speculated it could be the group's best work to date, saying \"the album's tonal density is absolutely the toughest, most downright brutal I've heard all year\". In March 1975, Billboard magazine's reviewer wrote: \"[Physical Graffiti] is a tour de force through a number of musical styles, from straight rock to blues to folky acoustic to orchestral sounds.\" Similarly, Jim Miller stated in Rolling Stone that the double album was \"the band's Tommy, Beggar's Banquet and Sgt. Pepper rolled into one: Physical Graffiti is Led Zeppelin's bid for artistic respectability\". Village Voice critic Robert Christgau was less impressed, writing that except for side two, the material often wanders into \"wide tracks, misconceived opi, and so forth\", and \"after a while Robert Plant begins to grate\".", "*Robert Plant\u00a0\u2013 vocals, harmonica"]}, {"page": "Presence (album)", "response": ["The album was written and recorded in the last months of 1975, during a difficult time in the band's history. Singer Robert Plant was recuperating from serious injuries he had sustained earlier that year in a car accident; this led to tours being cancelled and the band booking studio time to record Presence instead. The entire album was completed in a few weeks, with guitarist and producer Jimmy Page putting in several long shifts to complete recording and mixing.

In an interview from 1997, Jones said that the reason he didn't wear the same stage clothes was that he asked the crew if they would be filming on those nights and was told no. \"I'd think 'not to worry, I'll save the shirt I wore the previous night for the next filming'.
