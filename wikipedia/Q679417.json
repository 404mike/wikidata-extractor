As the University of Wales Dictionary notes \"according to tradition, Syr Dafydd Gam (Dafydd ap Llewelyn ap Hywel Fychan) was one-eyed or cross-eyed\". Regarded  by Welsh nationalists as a traitor, Gam is regarded as a hero in England; his reputation has waxed and waned with those of his enemy Owain Glynd\u0175r and his ally King Henry V.", "link_mentions": {}}}
