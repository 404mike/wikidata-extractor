This inconsistency was later explained in the episode \"The Timeless Children\", with the Doctor having had many previous incarnations before Hartnell's, however, the Doctor's memories of these had been erased by the secret Time Lord organization known as the Division.

After their meeting in early 1974, Stewart devised a storyline for a six-part adventure called The Secret of Loch Ness. Stewart felt that Scotland's legendary Loch Ness Monster would make an ideal basis for a story because there were so few details about the mythical creature. Although at first focusing on the Loch Ness Monster itself, Holmes encouraged Stewart to concentrate more on the Zygons, the shape-shifting aliens of the story. As the story evolved, it was known variously as The Loch, The Secret of the Loch, The Loch Ness Monster, The Zygons and finally Terror of the Zygons."]}, {"page": "Christopher H. Bidmead", "response": ["In 1979, Robert Banks Stewart recommended him for the post of script editor on Doctor Who. Bidmead was primarily responsible for a \"back to basics\" approach for his yearlong tenure on Doctor Who, attempting to curb the more playful and fantasy oriented approach of his predecessor Douglas Adams in favour of a more naturalistic and scientific style of presentation. Most noticeable in the more serious portrayal of Tom Baker's Doctor, this approach proved controversial and ratings suffered, although this has been attributed to the tough timeslot for Bidmead's season which saw the show competing against Buck Rogers in the 25th Century on ITV. Very much a product of its time, Bidmead's writings for Doctor Who demonstrate an increasing awareness of computer technology, typified by his complex serial Logopolis which served to write out the Fourth Doctor. After a year as script editor he returned to freelance work. This included writing two more Doctor Who serials for Peter Davison's Doctor (Castrovalva and Frontios) as well as producing novelisations of all three of these Doctor Who stories."]}, {"page": "List of actors who have played the Doctor", "response": ["|Robert Banks Stewart"]}, {"page": "List of Bergerac episodes", "response": ["| Robert Banks Stewart", "| Robert Banks Stewart", "| Robert Banks Stewart, Peter Miller", "| Robert Banks Stewart, Robert Holmes", "| Robert Banks Stewart, Leslie Darbon", "| Robert Banks Stewart", "| Robert Banks Stewart"]}, {"page": "List of Doctor Who writers", "response": ["| Bob Holmes was the most prolific writer of the classic era.

The pods when opened are attracted to flesh and are able to infect and mingle their DNA with that of the host, taking over their body and slowly transforming them into a Krynoid. The species can also exert a form of telepathic control over other plant life in the surrounding area, making it suddenly dangerous and deadly to animal-kind. In the later stages of development the Krynoid can also control the vocal cords of its victims and can make itself telepathically sympathetic to humans. Fully grown Krynoids are many meters high and can then release hordes of seed pairs for further colonisation."]}]}}
