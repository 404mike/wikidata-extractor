Jones  (born 1 June 1944) is a British computer scientist, specializing in research into formal methods. He undertook a late DPhil at the Oxford University Computing Laboratory (now the Oxford University Department of Computer Science) under Tony Hoare, awarded in 1981. Jones' thesis proposed an extension to Hoare logic for handling concurrent programs, rely/guarantee.Prior to his DPhil, Jones worked for IBM, between the Hursley and Vienna Laboratories. In Vienna, Jones worked with Peter Lucas, Dines Bj\u00f8rner and others on the Vienna Development Method (VDM), originally as a method for specifying the formal semantics of programming languages, and subsequently for specifying and verifying programs.Cliff Jones was a professor at the Victoria University of Manchester in the 1980s and early 1990s, worked in industry at Harlequin for a period, and is now a Professor of Computing Science at Newcastle University. He has been Editor-in-Chief of the Formal Aspects of Computing journal.As well as formal methods, Jones also has interests in interdisciplinary aspects of computer science and the history of computer science.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of computer scientists", "response": ["* Cliff Jones \u2013 Vienna Development Method (VDM)"]}, {"page": "Vienna Development Method", "response": ["The \"English School\" derived from work by Cliff Jones on the aspects of VDM not specifically related to language definition and compiler design (Jones 1980, 1990).

Functionality is typically described through operations which may have side-effects on the state and which are mostly specified implicitly using a precondition and postcondition. The \"Danish School\" (Bj\u00f8rner et al. 1982) has tended to stress a constructive approach with explicit operational specification used to a greater extent. Work in the Danish school led to the first European validated Ada compiler."]}, {"page": "Refinement (computing)", "response": ["The term reification is also sometimes used (coined by Cliff Jones).
