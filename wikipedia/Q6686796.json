Foyle also signed defender Clayton Fortune on a season long loan for a second time, this time from Leyton Orient. Heading into December with just three wins in fifteen league games, they won their first four games, with Constantine hitting five of Vale's nine goals. In January, Foyle splashed out \u00a330,000 on Crewe Alexandra striker Luke Rodgers. He also signed former teammate Paul Musselwhite as an emergency back-up goalkeeper following an injury to Mark Goodlad, as well as Cardiff City midfielder Malvin Kamara. He also turned down an offer from Barnsley of \u00a3200,000 (plus Marc Richards) for Constantine, who claimed to be happy at Vale Park.
