He was baptised at St James's Church, Piccadilly, on 20 February 1743, Old Style.George Suttor, ed., Joseph Banks, Memoirs Historical and Scientific of the Right Hon. Sir Joseph Banks (Parramatta: E.

He arranged that a large number of useful trees and plants should be sent out in the supply ship , which was unfortunately wrecked, as well as other ships; many of these were supplied by Hugh Ronalds from his nursery in Brentford. Every vessel that came from New South Wales brought plants or animals or geological and other specimens to Banks. He was continually called on for help in developing the agriculture and trade of the colony, and his influence was used in connection with the sending out of early free settlers, one of whom, a young gardener George Suttor, later wrote a memoir of Banks. The three earliest governors of the colony, Arthur Phillip, John Hunter, and Philip Gidley King, were in continual correspondence with him. Banks produced a significant body of papers, including one of the earliest Aboriginal Australian words lists compiled by a European. Bligh was also appointed governor of New South Wales on Banks's recommendation. Banks followed the explorations of Matthew Flinders, George Bass, and Lieutenant James Grant, and among his paid helpers were George Caley, Robert Brown, and Allan Cunningham."]}, {"page": "Wiradjuri", "response": ["Wiradjuri territory was first penetrated by European colonists in 1813. In 1822 George Suttor took up an extensive lot of land, later known as Brucedale Station, after Wiradjuri guides showed him an area with ample water sources. Suttor learnt their language, and befriended Windradyne, nicknamed \"Saturday\", and attributed conflict to the harshness of white behaviour, since the Wiradjuri were in his view, fond of white people. Clashes between European settlers however multiplied as the influx of whites increased, and became known as the Bathurst Wars. The occupation of their lands and their cultivation began to cause famine among the Wiradjuri, who had a different notion of what constituted property.   In the 1850s there were still corroborees around Mudgee but there were fewer clashes."]}, {"page": "Elizabeth Farm", "response": ["John Macarthur brought olive trees (Olea europaea cv.) to Sydney in 1805 and again in 1817. Although George Suttor had introduced olives to Australia earlier, in 1800 among a collection of plants from Sir Joseph Banks, these appear not to have survived. Macarthur's olives did. John, in exile in London over his involvement with the overthrow of Governor William Bligh, sensed the mood of the British administration - who were encouraged by Suttor's reports that New South Wales had potential for horticulture due to the local climate. Macarthur set off in 1815 on a tour of France and Switzerland to study \"the whole practice of the culture of the vine and the olive, and the making of the wine and the oil.\" By May 1816 he was back in London with a collection of vines and olives for shipment to Australia. He was certain that these would impress Lord Bathurst, secretary of state for the colonies, and assist his return to Australia, but it took a year to get the go-ahead. He arrived in September 1817 with a cargo of \"useful plants\" including two olives from Provence."]}, {"page": "Francis Bathurst Suttor", "response": ["Suttor was born in Bathurst, New South Wales, the son of pastoralist William Henry Suttor and his wife, Charlotte Augusta Anne n\u00e9e Francis. Francis Bathurst Suttor was a grandson of George Suttor. F. B. Suttor was educated at The King's School, Parramatta, and from age 19 managed his father's properties near Bathurst. He took up the properties Redbank and Katella near Wellington, New South Wales in 1863, and later Bradwardine at Bathurst. In July 1863 Suttor married Emily Jane (1841\u20131911), daughter of Thomas Jarman Hawkins (1909-1885) of Walmer, Bathurst. Suttor made a study of sheep-breeding; in 1868 he bought 100 merino ewes from C. C. Cox of Brombee and the use of the sire Brombee Pet for two months; Suttor maintained the high standards of Mudgee sheep. With ewes bought from James Alexander Gibson Suttor founded a stud of Tasmanian merinos at Bradwardine that were successful in shows. From a Cleveland Bay sire, Suttor also bred a superior type of horse for coaches which were extensively used in Australia at the time."]}, {"page": "List of people legally executed in Australia", "response": ["* Russell Crawford \u2013 8 December 1832 \u2013 Hanged at Sydney for highway robbery of George Suttor on the Windsor Road."]}, {"page": "Windradyne", "response": ["Windradyne's date of birth is unknown, but on his death in 1829 his obituary in The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser\u2014thought to be by his settler friend George Suttor from 'Brucedale Station' north of Bathurst\u2014stated \"His age did not, I think, exceed 30 years\", thus putting his year of birth at approximately 1800.
