Between January 2010 to December 2018 he was the presenter of Simon Mayo Drivetime on BBC Radio 2, for the final six months with co-hostess Jo Whiley. Since March 2021, Simon Mayo Drivetime has returned on Greatest Hits Radio.\nIn 2008, Mayo was recognised as the \"Radio Broadcaster of the Year\"  at the 34th annual Broadcasting Press Guild Awards, and the \"Speech Broadcaster of the Year\" at the Sony Radio Academy Awards, receiving the latter for his \"ability to paint colourful pictures of location and event and his ability to bring the very best out of his guests, encouraging conversation and interaction between them while skilfully nudging and controlling them\" and for being  \"a master of light and shade, handling serious and lighter issues with aplomb.\"Mayo is also a published author.

In 1976 Idle directed music videos for George Harrison songs \"This Song\" and \"Crackerbox Palace\", the latter of which also featured cameo appearances from Neil Innes and John Cleese. Idle has had success with Python songs: \"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life\" went to no. 3 in the UK singles chart in 1991. The song had been revived by Simon Mayo on BBC Radio 1, and was consequently released as a single that year. The theatrical phenomenon of the Python musical Spamalot has made Idle the most financially successful of the troupe after Python. Written by Idle (and featuring a pre-recorded cameo of Cleese as the voice of God), it has proved to be an enormous hit on Broadway, London's West End and Las Vegas. This was followed by Not the Messiah, which revises The Life of Brian as an oratorio.

In 1989, Idle co-wrote and sang the theme tune to the popular British sitcom One Foot in the Grave and although the series became immensely popular, the song did poorly in the charts. However, when \"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life\" was adopted as a football chant in the late 1980s, Idle's then neighbour Gary Lineker suggested Idle re-record and release the popular track. With help from Radio 1 breakfast show host Simon Mayo, who gave the song regular airplay and also used the chorus within a jingle, it became a hit, some 12 years after the song's original appearance in Life of Brian, reaching number 3 in the UK charts and landing Idle a set on Top of the Pops in October 1991. The following month Idle, accompanied by opera singer Ann Howard, sang the song at the Royal Variety Performance. He recorded a special version for Mayo's own use on air (\"Come on Simon, get another song on now; why don't you put on a nice Cliff Richard record?\") and changed the line \"life's a piece of shit\" to \"life's a piece of spit\" in order to get daytime airplay on radio.

One scene features a large, impromptu dance-off with the alien (dressed in a teddy bear costume), a football team, Ronald McDonald, and various other people inside and outside of a McDonald's restaurant. Leonard Maltin described the film as being \"more like a TV commercial than a movie\", and Marjorie Baumgarten of the Austin Chronicle called it a \"shameless E.T. knockoff\".
