LA Reid stated during an interview with VH1: \"We called her the first lady of LaFace. She was our Diva. Clive had Whitney, Tommy had Mariah and we had Toni.\" BBC called the album \"spiritedly, mature soul at its best \u2013 and just urban enough to make it the bedroom album for the hip hop generation.\" Over the span of her career Braxton has sold over 70 million records, including 40 million albums, worldwide. Her hit \"Un-Break My Heart\", the Diane Warren-penned ballad, spent 11-weeks at number 1. Bob McCann, author of Encyclopedia of African American Actresses in Film and Television (2010), considered it \"simply one of the most haunting R&B records ever made.\" Reviewer Mark Edward Nero named it one of the best R&B break-up songs and considered it Braxton's \"finest moment\". He further commented, \"damn, this song is so sad it can make people cry for hours at a time.\"  Braxton is a recipient of seven Grammy Awards, seven American Music Awards, and nine Billboard Music Awards. She has been cited as an influence by various artists, such as Beyonc\u00e9, Tamar Braxton, Billie Godfrey, Kelly Clarkson, Leela James, Keyshia Cole, Teyana Taylor, Kehlani and Anja Nissen."]}, {"page": "Elegantly Wasted", "response": ["* Billie Godfrey and Caroline MacKendrick \u2013 backing vocals on \"I'm Just A Man\""]}, {"page": "British Electric Foundation", "response": ["In March 2007 B.E.F. made their first live performance, as part of the line-up for the Tribute to Billy MacKenzie Concert held at Shepherds Bush Empire, London, in memory of their three-time guest vocalist, and in aid of Sound Seekers.

Godfrey sings entirely in Japanese despite not being a native Japanese speaker - something no other western artist has so far achieved.Scorccio Records It was released in Japan but also sold in the UK and US as an import.Discogs - Billie Godfrey The concept for the album was conceived and produced by Mark Summers for his music label Scorccio Records (now known as Scorccio Sample Replays). His vision was to produce Pop and R&B songs for the Japanese market, to be sung in Japanese - but sung by a native English vocalist. The English written songs were all translated into Japanese by musician Emiko Kawakami, following this Summers and Godfrey booked 5 days at a West London studio to record all the vocals for the album. Within the first hour of recording, it soon became apparent how difficult it was for anyone non-Japanese to read the translated text and sing it fluently. Mark Summers then quickly devised a phonetic technique for Billie Godfrey - to be able to sing as if she was fluent in Japanese, which most listeners in Japan believed she truly was."]}, {"page": "Naked as Advertised", "response": ["#\"Temptation\" (featuring Billie Godfrey) \u2013 3:47"]}, {"page": "Music of Quality and Distinction Volume Three", "response": ["| 14. || \"Smalltown Boy\" || Billie Godfrey || 7.40"]}, {"page": "Totally Driven", "response": ["*Billie Godfrey, Emma Robbins \u2013 backing vocals"]}, {"page": "Clik!
