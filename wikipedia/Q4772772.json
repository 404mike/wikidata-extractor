The fourth son of the Rev. Charles Wolley-Dod, of Edge Hall, Cheshire, an assistant master at Eton, and his wife Frances Lucy Pelly, he trained at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, was commissioned to the Royal Artillery in 1881 and retired as a major in 1901. In the First World War he was remobilized and served as lieutenant colonel. \nHe collected plants in South Africa, Gibraltar, California and extensively in the United Kingdom. He donated his collection of several thousand South African specimens to the British Museum, to which he also bequeathed his herbarium.  \nHe married firstly, in 1888, Agnes Gardyne Macintosh (died 29 Oct 1917), who bore him a daughter, Mabel Florence (born 1889); he married secondly, on 4 April 1922, Eileen Griffin.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of botanists", "response": ["*Anthony Hurt Wolley-Dod"]}, {"page": "List of authors of South African botanical taxa", "response": ["*Anthony Hurt Wolley-Dod (1861\u20131948) S ........

He named it Aster aethiopicus. Henri Cassini in 1817 described Agathaea microphylla. In 1822, Kurt Polycarp Joachim Sprengel described Cineraria trachyphylla. In 1832, Christian Friedrich Lessing described Aster ecklonis. He also described Aster capensis, based on a herbarium sheet that contains one twig of Felicia aethiopica and two twigs of F. amelloides, and this has since created much confusion. Cassini\u2019s taxon was reassigned to the genus Cineraria by Jens Vahl, who created the combination C. microphylla in 1836. Carl Heinrich 'Bipontinus' Schultz described a slightly different plant in 1843, calling it Agathaea kraussii, but he demoted it a year later to Agathaea amelloides \u03b2 kraussii. In 1865, William Henry Harvey, reassigned Schultz\u2019 taxon to Aster, creating A. kraussii, but he also described Aster aethiopicus var. glandulosus. Bolus and Anthony Hurt Wolley-Dod assign the species to the genus Felicia in 1950, creating the combination Felicia aethiopica. J\u00fcrke Grau in his 1973 Revision of the genus Felicia (Asteraceae), considered tall these names synonymous, except for Aster ecklonis Less., that he considered a subspecies, calling it F. aethiopica subsp. ecklonis.

This name was later associated with Felicia amelloides. It was first described by William Aiton in his Hortus Kewensis of 1789 and he named it Aster cymbalariae. Nees von Esenbeck reassigned it in 1833, calling it Munichia cymbalariae. \u00c9tienne Pierre Ventenat described Cineraria hirsuta in 1803, and this was reassigned in 1836 by Augustin Pyramus de Candolle as Munichia hirsuta, and in 1865 by William Henry Harvey as Aster hirsutus, who also recognised A. cymbalariae with vars. cymbalariae and ionops. In 1822, Henri Cassini described Felicia brachyglossa, which was reassigned by himself in 1825, creating the name Munychia brachyglossa. In 1836, De Candole had distinguished Munichia cymbalariae \u03b2 microcephala. Harry Bolus and Anthony Hurt Wolley-Dod made the correct combination Felica cymbalariae in 1950. In 1973, J\u00fcrke Grau considered these names synonymous, agreed with Harvey's variety, but raised it to subspecies level, and so created Felicia cymbalariae subsp. ionops.

In 1833, Nees von Esenbeck thought that its should be moved to another genus and he made the combination Agathaea elongata.  Aster elongatus var. thunbergii was distinguished by William Henry Harvey in 1865. Karl August Otto Hoffmann reassigned Thunberg's species and made the combination Felicia namaquana in 1905. Harry Bolus and Anthony Hurt Wolley-Dod were not aware of Hoffmann's combination and claimed it for themselves in 1950. In 1973 J\u00fcrke Grau considered all of these name synonymous.

One year later, followed by Nees von Esenbeck, who called it Detridium bergerianum. In 1836, Augustin Pyramus de Candolle again reassigned it, making the combination Agathaea bergeriana.
