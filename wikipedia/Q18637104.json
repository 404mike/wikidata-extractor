He spent the first half of the 2012\u201313 season on loan at Barrow, and had a brief stay on loan at Hyde in the second half of the campaign. He joined FC Halifax Town and Lincoln City on loan in November 2013 and September 2014 respectively, before making his debut in the English Football League on loan at Carlisle United in November 2014. He spent the second half of the 2015\u201316 season and the whole of the 2016\u201317 campaign on loan at Chesterfield. He joined Port Vale on loan for the first half of the 2017\u201318 season, and then was loaned to Doncaster Rovers for the second half of the season, before he joined Doncaster Rovers permanently in May 2018.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Michael Brown (footballer, born 1977)", "response": ["Despite being relegated, Brown was confirmed as the club's permanent manager in May 2017. He released 13 players at the end of the 2016\u201317 season. His first summer signing was former two-time Player of the Year Tom Pope on a free transfer after he managed to secure his release from Bury. He went on to sign ten more players during the window: goalkeepers Rob Lainton and Sam Hornby, defenders Joe Davis, Antony Kay, Gavin Gunning, Lawrie Wilson and Graham Kelly, midfielders Michael Tonge, Cristian Monta\u00f1o, David Worrall and Harry Middleton, and striker Tyrone Barnett; he also signed youngsters Rekeil Pyke, Marcus Harness, Tyler Denton, Ben Whitfield, Jack Stobbs and Tom Anderson on loan. However Vale suffered their worst start to a season in 50 years at the beginning of the 2017\u201318 season, going a club record six games without scoring a goal as they sat bottom of the table in September following six consecutive league defeats. He was sacked on 16 September following a 1\u20131 home draw with second-from-bottom Forest Green Rovers. Speaking after his sacking, Brown said that it had been difficult for him to recruit quality players on \"a very tight budget... I think it was arguably \u00a31m under from when they had got promoted from that league the time previously\". Supporter website OneValeFan described this as \"a somewhat unlikely claim\" as the club had only exited administration in November 2012."]}, {"page": "Tom Anderson (disambiguation)", "response": ["Tom Anderson (born 1970) is an entrepreneur and co-founder of MySpace.", "Tom Anderson may also refer to:", "*Tom Anderson Jr. (1885\u20131915), Scottish-American golfer", "*Tom Anderson (fiddler) (1910\u20131991), fiddler, composer, folklorist and teacher", "*Tom Anderson (politician) (born 1967), former member of the Alaska State Legislature", "*Tom Anderson (footballer) (born 1993), English footballer for Doncaster Rovers", "*Tom Anderson (The Matrix) or Neo, a character from The Matrix", "*Tom Anderson, a character in Beavis and Butt-Head", "*Tom Anderson Guitarworks, American manufacturer of guitars and guitar pickups"]}, {"page": "Neil Aspin", "response": ["In the January transfer window Aspin allowed two departures, plus Gavin Gunning left the club after rejecting a contract offer and centre-back Tom Anderson was recalled from his loan; incoming were non-league players Dior Angus, Luke Hannant and Callum Howe, as well as loanees Donovan Wilson, Zak Jules, Charlie Raglan and Kyle Howkins. Aspin remarked that the four centre-backs brought in did not cost the club much financially, and that he would have liked to have strengthened in other areas \"but for one reason or another it just hasn't happened\". However he managed to convert Cristian Monta\u00f1o from a winger to a left-back and Antony Kay from a centre-half to a central midfielder, and guided the club to safety with two games to spare. Vale ended the campaign in 20th-place \u2013 the joint-lowest finish in the club's history \u2013 with just one point above the relegation zone, having been out of the relegation zone on goal difference upon Aspin's arrival at the club."]}, {"page": "Charlie Raglan", "response": ["He ruptured two ligaments on the eve of the new season and was ruled out of action for three months. His injury left him unable to feature under manager Pep Clotet, and with the arrival of Robert Dickie caretaker-manager Derek Fazackerley felt that he had enough cover at centre-back to allow Raglan to look for game time elsewhere. On 30 January 2018, he re-joined former club Port Vale in League Two on loan until the end of the 2017\u201318 season; manager Neil Aspin had quickly needed a centre-back to replace the recalled loanee Tom Anderson. He made an excellent debut by helping the \"Valiants\" to keep a clean sheet in a 0\u20130 draw with Morecambe at Vale Park on 4 February. However he was dropped after a poor performance in a 5\u20131 defeat to Cheltenham Town six days later, before making a good impression upon his return to the team four weeks later in place of the injured Kyle Howkins."]}, {"page": "2015\u201316 Chesterfield F.C. season", "response": ["|1 February 2016||DF||||Tom Anderson||Burnley||End of season||"]}, {"page": "James Gibbons (footballer)", "response": ["He did not make a first-team appearance under manager Michael Brown, but was selected by caretaker-managers David Kelly and Chris Morgan for his EFL League Two debut on 23 September 2017, and was sent off after receiving two yellow cards during what ended as a 1\u20131 draw at Yeovil Town. New manager Neil Aspin said that \"I don't look at him as a young lad, I just look at him as a player. He is a player who deserves to be playing and I am happy with him.\" He signed a two-year contract extension in November to keep him at the club until 2020. He was sent off for the second time in his career on 12 December, again away at Yeovil, for committing a dangerous challenge; he was handed a four match suspension. However Aspin heavily criticised referee Gavin Ward, and said \"there is no criticism from me [for Gibbons] in this instance because he is a competitive player and we want to keep that\". Gibbons returned to the starting eleven after serving his suspension, and though the defensive line-up changed due to the departures of Gavin Gunning and Tom Anderson he refused to accept any excuses for what he admitted was a decline in the team's form and his own personal performances.

Two days later Brown signed 21-year old left-back Tyler Denton on a season-long loan from Leeds United. Adebayo Akinfenwa put Wycombe Wanderers ahead within two minutes of the opening home game of the season at Vale Park on 12 August, and by the 25-minute mark he had scored the opposition's final goal of a 3\u20132 defeat for the \"Valiants\". In the week following the defeat to Wycombe, both Anton Forrester and Danny Pugh were ruled out of action for three to four months, and Brown signed 20-year old Sheffield Wednesday winger Jack Stobbs on a season-long loan. The match at Chesterfield was declared \"Ernie Moss Day\" in tribute to the legend of both clubs, but another poor performance saw Vale slip to a 2\u20130 defeat to a side that had previously failed to pick up a point. Fans booed the team and turned on the manager, chanting 'You don't know what you're doing'. In the week building up to the local derby with Crewe Alexandra, Brown signed highly rated midfielder David Worrall. Worrall made his debut against Crewe, but it was midfield partner Michael Tonge who made the headlines for the wrong reasons, as he was sent off four minutes after Crewe's Chris Dagnall scored the only goal of the game on the half-hour mark; Brown said that Tonge was unlucky to be sent off and he was proud of his team's performance.
