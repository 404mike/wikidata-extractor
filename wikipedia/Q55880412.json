In the third minute, a corner from James Ward-Prowse found Stuart Armstrong on the edge of the box, and the Scotsman powered a half-volley past Bernd Leno. However, Arsenal was able to capitalize on the absences of both of the Saints' usual starting full-backs, those being left-back Ryan Bertrand (serving a one-match ban due to yellow card accumulation) and right-back Kyle Walker-Peters (out due to a quadriceps injury). A few minutes after the Saints' opening goal, Granit Xhaka cut a pass between Saints defenders Yan Valery and Jan Bednarek to find Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9, who held off Valery and fired past Alex McCarthy to the far post to level the score. In the thirty-ninth minute, Alexandre Lacazette played a pass to Bukayo Saka, who managed to get past Jake Vokins. McCarthy rushed outside of his penalty box to confront Saka before pulling back to avoid committing a foul, but the Southampton goalkeeper's mistake allowed Saka to easily get around him and tap in a second goal for the Gunners. In the second half, Arsenal sought to extend their lead and close out the game. A high floating pass from C\u00e9dric found Saka across the field in the seventy-second minute, and this time, Saka turned provider for Lacazette. A first time low cross from Saka found the French striker, who ran between and past Southampton center-backs Bednarek and Jack Stephens to tap in Arsenal's third goal. Despite a threatening free kick from Ward-Prowse late in the game that forced Leno to parry it away, Arsenal hung on for the 3\u20131 win, which saw Arsenal return to the top ten for the first time all season since Matchday 7 at the beginning of November."]}, {"page": "2020\u201321 Southampton F.C. season", "response": ["| Jake Vokins", "|align=\"left\"|Jake Vokins"]}, {"page": "2021\u201322 Ross County F.C. season", "response": ["| Jake Vokins"]}, {"page": "2021\u201322 Southampton F.C. season", "response": ["| Jake Vokins"]}]}}
