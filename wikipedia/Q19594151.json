He helped Bishop Auckland win two Northern League titles and to reach the 1911 Amateur Cup Final, and also played non-league football for Stockton. He signed amateur forms with Football League club Sunderland in 1910, for whom he played three times and scored twice in the First Division. He won four caps for the England amateur team. Returning to Darlington F.C. in 1912, Healey was the club's top scorer as they won the 1912\u201313 North-Eastern League title, and was a member of the Amateur XI that opposed a team of professionals in the 1913 FA Charity Shield. In 1914, he turned professional with Middlesbrough, but played only four times, scoring twice. After the First World War, he returned to Darlington. He captained the team to the North-Eastern League title in 1921 and made 17 appearances in the Third Division North in the club's first two seasons in the Football League.\nAs a cricketer, he played a few matches for Durham in the Minor Counties Championship, and had a long association with Darlington Cricket Club, as player, captain and president.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1913 FA Charity Shield", "response": ["Hampton completed his hat-trick after five minutes of the second half, but then the Amateurs took control. Sam Hardy kept out shots from Dick Healey, Ivan Sharpe and Herbert Farnfield before being beaten twice in five minutes. After a \"great shot\" from Preston North End winger George Barlow, the Amateurs' second was touched in by Farnfield after a move involving four players brought the ball all the way down the field. It was, according to the pseudonymous 'Reflector', writing in the Mirror, \"easily the best of the match.\" Confusion between goalkeeper Ronald Brebner and full-back Thomas Burn presented Hampton with his fourth, and Holley completed the scoring late on.", "The Mirror highlighted the performance of Walden, who was involved in three of the Professionals' goals and who outplayed the defence on his side of the field, centre-half Joe McCall, and replacement left-back Womack; Peacock at centre half, Dick Healey at inside right, and centre-forward Woodward were the pick of the Amateurs. The Manchester Guardian thought the Professional team \"an evenly-balanced side, strong in every particular\" who \"played a fast game without a suggestion of foul methods\". Its reporter agreed that the Amateur wing halves were weak, which combined with the absence of Hunt put undue pressure on backs and goalkeeper, although the conclusion that it was \"rather remarkable that the scoring did not reach double figures\", was in clear contrast to the Mirror opinion that the five-goal difference flattered the winners.", "|Forward|| Dick Healey||Darlington"]}, {"page": "Ernie Young (footballer, born 1893)", "response": ["He was in competition with at least six other men for Darlington's centre-forward position, including Bill Hooper, normally an inside right, who had been the club's top scorer in 1921\u201322, and the veteran Dick Healey.
