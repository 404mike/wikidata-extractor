He entered the motor industry through his company Speedex Castings and Accessories Ltd., based in Luton, that manufactured and sold tuning parts for Austin Sevens, based on Marsh's successful Speedex750 racing special. Marsh is perhaps best known as a co-founder of the sports-car manufacturer Marcos, the name being derived from a contraction of his and fellow founder Frank Costin's surnames. Founded in 1959, the company was continued by Jem's son Chris Marsh, until it was taken over by Canadian Tony Stellinga, and continued to produce automobiles until 2008 when it ceased production.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Marcos Engineering", "response": ["Marcos Engineering was a British sports car manufacturer. The name derives from the surnames of founders Jem Marsh and Frank Costin.", "Marcos was founded in Dolgellau, North Wales, in 1959, by Speedex cars' Jem Marsh with aerodynamicist Frank Costin. Costin had earlier worked on the de Havilland Mosquito fighter-bombers and from there he got the idea to use plywood for the chassis. The company moved to a converted mill in Bradford on Avon, Wiltshire, in 1963; in 1971 they relocated to a \u00a3125,000 purpose-built factory at nearby Westbury.", "Jem Marsh resurrected the Marcos brand in 1981, offering the previous GT cars as kits. Engine options included Ford's 3.0 Essex V6, 2.8 Cologne V6, 1600 Crossflow, 2.0 Pinto and 2.0 V4s, plus Triumph's 2.0 and 2.5 straight sixes. About 130 kits were sold up to 1989.", "In 2002, after a break in production caused by bankruptcy, a new company (Marcos Engineering Ltd) was launched with Jem Marsh as vice-chairman, and with the financial backing of Canadian Tony Stelliga, to manufacture the Marcasite TS250 with a 2.5-litre  Ford V6 followed in 2003 by the 5-litre Rover V8-powered TS500. The 2002 price of the TS250 was \u00a329,744 +VAT, with options such as air-conditioning (\u00a31634), full leather interior (\u00a31626) and Hydratrak differential (\u00a3360). Other unpriced options included an elm or walnut veneer dashboard, and a newly designed hard top.", "A new mid engine prototype was launched in 2013. The cars design was a major move away from the original front engined designs, but Jem Marsh, one of the original founders of Marcos, was consulted during the development process and both he and Dennis Adams, designer of the Marcos Coupe, gave it their approval. Jem Marsh also commented that he\u2019d had intentions of developing a mid engine car and that this was a step in the right direction in ensuring that the cars would appeal to a modern generation of enthusiasts. The car has since been refined and undergone a few design changes in light of further testing.", "Marcos started out with race cars, with the first Xylon cars being built specifically for the 750 motor club races. Among the drivers were Jackie Stewart, Bill Moss, John Sutton, Jack Gates, John Mitchell and Jackie Oliver, as well as Jem Marsh. The young Jackie Stewart achieved 4 victories in 1961, while Bill Moss managed 9 victories in 10 starts. John Sutton won the 1961 Autosport Championship, and together with Jack Gates and John Mitchell, Marcos won the team prize.", "The Gullwing in turn evolved into the GT Fastback, also known as the 'Breadvan'. All 18 fastbacks made in 1963 went into racing, and like the Xylon and Gullwing they were FIA homologated in the GT category. However, without the gull wing doors, the fastbacks were awkward to get in and out of. Drivers included Jackie Oliver, Terry Sanger, and Derek Bell, and Jem Marsh of course. The sales brochure for the Fastback included options for 5 speed gearbox (Hewland), dry sump, 997cc (84 to 88 bhp) and 1148cc (102 to 104\u00a0bhp) full race engines, light alloy bellhousing, 72-litre fuel tank (for endurance racing), lightweight alloy oil cooler, and perspex windscreen (saving 15\u00a0lbs).", "In October 1993 Marcos unveiled its new competition car and announced a return to GT racing, including Le Mans. Based on the Mantara, the cars were designated LM400, LM500 and LM600. After some successes in the British GT championship in 1994, Marcos won it in 1995, 1996 and 2000. Two cars also competed at Le Mans in 1995. Both suffered electrical faults, one retiring and the other (driven by David Leslie, Fran\u00e7ois Migault, and Jem Marsh's son Chris) finishing second to last, having completed 114 laps fewer than the winning McLaren F1 GTR as its electrical problem stranded it on the Mulsanne Straight for two hours soon after the start."]}, {"page": "Frank Costin", "response": ["Later, Costin used his aeronautical knowledge to design and build a chassis from plywood.  This led to a lightweight, stiff structure, which he could then clothe with an efficient, aerodynamic body, a huge advantage in the low-capacity sports car racing of the immediate postwar period. He was also involved in a number of road car projects for various manufacturers including Lister and Lotus, where he contributed to the early aerodynamic designs; Marcos, which he co-founded with Speedex Cars' Jem Marsh (MARsh and COStin); and racecar chassis for Maserati, Lotus, and DTV. He also designed the Costin Amigo, the TMC Costin, and the Costin Sports Roadster.  He also created an ultra-light glider with Keith Duckworth, an old friend and his brother's business partner."]}, {"page": "Costin Amigo", "response": ["The car's chassis is often described as a wooden monocoque. This was not the first such structure designed and built by Costin. In 1959 he had partnered with Jem Marsh to start Marcos Engineering and produce the timber chassis Marcos GT Xylon that debuted in 1959. In 1965 the Costin-Nathan sports racer was launched, funded by Roger Nathan. And in 1967 the Costin-Harris Protos open wheel car started to be raced by Ron Harris Racing in Formula Two (F2) events, as well as one appearance in Formula One (F1) at the 1967 German Grand Prix joint F1/F2 event at the N\u00fcrburgring.
