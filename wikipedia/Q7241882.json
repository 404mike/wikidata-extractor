A club record was broken just before Christmas as Brown's team achieved nine wins in succession.  A 2\u20130 win over Sutton United, with both goals coming from Billy Bricknell, broke the long-standing record which subsequently put them amongst the title contenders but poor runs of form were to follow.  Ebbsfleet eventually reached the playoffs, helped by goalkeeper Preston Edwards keeping eleven clean sheets at Stonebridge Road over the course of the season. The playoff semi-final first leg against Bromley at Stonebridge Road ended in a 4\u20130 win for the Fleet. Despite Bromley winning the second leg, Brown's side won 4\u20131 on aggregate. The playoff final was against Dover Athletic at Stonebridge Road in front of a 4,200 crowd.  Dover dominated the encounter, winning 1\u20130 with a goal early in the second half from former Ebbsfleet striker Nathan Elder."]}, {"page": "Chris Carruthers", "response": ["He signed for Conference Premier club Oxford United on 4 July 2008, with manager Darren Patterson describing him as \"another great pro who has bags of experience considering his age\".

Manager Chris Wilder said in June 2009 that Carruthers was not part of his plans. He joined Oxford's fellow Conference Premier club Crawley Town on 28 August on a one-month loan, having made one appearance for Oxford up to that point in 2009\u201310. He made his debut as a substitute on 21 minutes in a 1\u20131 home draw with Grays on 29 August, nearly scoring after 11 minutes of being on the field after forcing a save from goalkeeper Preston Edwards, and this was followed by his first start in a 3\u20130 defeat away to Luton Town on 1 September. His first goal came with the opener in a 2\u20130 home victory against Histon on 8 September with an \"unstoppable shot into the top right corner\".
