Winger Guly do Prado scored twice, before Adam Lallana and substitute Lee Barnard topped off the match with goals in the second half. Thanks to results elsewhere in the league, the result sent the club to the automatic promotion places for the first time in the season. Just two days later, the Saints travelled to play the return match against Dagenham & Redbridge, after beating the side 4\u20130 in November. After a goalless first half and numerous Saints chances, the visiting club broke the deadlock less than two minutes after the break, when Adam Lallana scored his eighth of the season with an overhead kick. Guly do Prado made it 2\u20130 after 75 minutes, before Josh Scott headered in a goal for the home side in the last ten minutes. Dagenham were unable to make the goal count for anything, however, as striker Rickie Lambert finished the game off with a goal in the last minute to keep Saints in the automatic promotion places. On 11 January Southampton closed the gap on League leaders Brighton by thrashing Oldham Athletic 6\u20130 at Boundary Park. The scoring started early, as winger Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain scored within nine minutes before Adam Lallana made it two shortly before half time. In the second half though, the Saints made their advantage really count, converting a further four chances with Guly do Prado, Richard Chaplow, Rickie Lambert and substitute Lee Barnard adding to their season tallies to increase the pressure at the top of League One. Southampton's winning run came to an end on 15 January, as the match with Notts County ended goalless. The Saints had the majority of possession throughout the game, Jos\u00e9 Fonte was denied a goal in the second half as his header was cleared off the line, and in the last minute Ryan Dickson cleared a County effort off the line to leave the match goalless. The misfortune continued when Southampton lost 2\u20130 to Tranmere Rovers in the return game at Prenton Park. The first half was dominated by the struggling home side, and marked by a goal for midfielder John Welsh following a miscommunication between Saints goalkeeper Kelvin Davis and defender Jos\u00e9 Fonte. The visiting team continued to struggle in the second half, and under-performances from players such as Rickie Lambert, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Guly do Prado meant that Rovers doubled their lead thanks to a goal from Dale Jennings, sending the Saints down to fourth below local rivals Bournemouth following their win over league leaders Brighton."]}, {"page": "2010 Football League Two play-off Final", "response": ["Dagenham & Redbridge's opponents in their play-off semi-final were Morecambe with the first match of the two-legged tie taking place on 16 May 2010 at Victoria Road in Dagenham.

Scott then scored a 19-minute hat-trick to make it 4\u20130 with more than half an hour remaining.  Benson scored his second and Dagenham's fifth midway through the second half; before Scott scored his fourth three minutes later.  The match ended 6\u20130 and Dagenham became the first team to score more than five goals in the first leg of a league play-off semi-final.  The second leg took place four days later at Christie Park in Morecambe.  After a goalless first half, Mark Duffy's volley from close range made it 1\u20130 to Morecambe in the 81st minute before Benson headed in an equaliser four minutes later.
