She judged alongside Cowell, Walsh (who replaced Nick Grimshaw) and Scherzinger (who replaced Rita Ora). She once again mentored the Over 25s category, choosing Saara Aalto, Relley C and Honey G as her final three contestants. Aalto went on to become the series' runner-up. Although initially casting doubt on returning for another series due to her commitments with The Talk, Osbourne returned to The X Factor for the fourteenth series. This time she again mentored the Girls category; her last act Grace Davies finished as the runner-up. Osbourne was initially confirmed to return for the fifteenth series as the fifth judge during the live shows portion of the competition but later declined the offer to return, feeling she wasn't needed on the panel and was replaced by Ayda Field."]}, {"page": "Dr Challoner's High School", "response": ["*Anna Gilford (performs under the name Honey G), The X Factor contestant"]}, {"page": "List of people associated with University College London", "response": ["* Honey G, Rap music artist, X Factor 2016 Debut"]}, {"page": "List of gay, lesbian or bisexual people: H", "response": ["| Honey G (rapper)"]}, {"page": "List of music artists and bands from England", "response": ["**Honey G (rapper) "]}]}}
