With the national cup finals being spread around those locations during the 1990s due to reconstruction work, this gave McCluskey the unique distinction of having refereed such matches at all three venues.McCluskey also oversaw the second leg of the 1994 UEFA Cup Final between Inter Milan and Casino Salzburg, and altogether took charge of more than 50 FIFA and UEFA matches.To celebrate his career, the Scottish Football Association awarded McCluskey a Scottish Cup Final game for his swansong. He presided over the 2000 Scottish Cup Final, in which Rangers beat Aberdeen 4\u20130 at Hampden.McCluskey, who worked as a surveyor in Ayrshire in addition to refereeing, died on 14 November 2013  in Ayr, aged 63.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1991 FIFA Women's World Cup", "response": ["| Jim McCluskey (Scotland)"]}, {"page": "Diving (association football)", "response": ["In 2011, Rangers player Sone Aluko was banned for two games for simulation by the Scottish FA. During a game against Dunfermline Athletic, Aluko won a penalty which was converted by Nikica Jelavi\u0107 and which proved to be the decisive goal. Dunfermline manager Jim McIntyre claimed it was \"never a penalty\" as there was no contact, and that Aluko was \"obviously trying to get his team into a lead\". Former referee Kenny Clark said that, while there was contact, it was \"not enough to cause a man to spill a pint in a pub far less to fall over\". After a club appeal had failed, Rangers manager Ally McCoist said he was \"shocked and extremely angry\" at the decision of the panel, which included former referee Jim McCluskey, who McCoist was critical of in particular, saying \"his decision making hasn't improved any since he stopped refereeing\"."]}, {"page": "McCluskey", "response": ["*Jim McCluskey (1950\u20132013), Scottish football referee"]}, {"page": "1999 Scottish Challenge Cup Final", "response": ["Only one minute into the second half, Alloa player Derek Clark committed a foul on Dennis Wyness in the penalty box and Inverness were awarded a penalty kick. Inverness midfielder Paul Sheerin took the penalty kick in the 46th minute and equalised the score to 2\u20132. One minute after the penalty, Alloa restored their lead when Cameron dispossessed the ball from defender Mike Teasdale and scored to take a 3\u20132 lead after 47 minutes. Referee Jim McCluskey awarded Inverness their second penalty kick of the game ten minutes later when Alloa defender David Beaton handled the ball in the box and Sheerin again equalised the scoreline at 3\u20133. Between the 65th and 67th minute, Alloa made the first substitutions of the game: Mark Wilson and Gary Clark were replaced by Gregor McKechnie and Max Christie respectively. Five minutes later, Inverness substituted defender Stuart Golabek with Kevin Byers. After the equalising goal, Inverness players Sheerin and Charlie Christie started to dominate the midfield area of the pitch and Christie and Xausa both had chances to win the match for Inverness. Alloa managed to keep the score at 3\u20133 for the rest of the match until the full-time whistle to force the game into extra time.", "Jim McCluskey, the referee of the game, retired a year after the final and when reflecting on his time as a referee, mentioned the game was one of the highlights of his career saying: \"It was an unbelievable game of football between two teams who were appearing in their first major cup final and they both just went for it. I was proud to have refereed it.\""]}]}}
