He was also guilty of extravagance and poor management of his finances.Harrison, Austin (1906). \"George Gissing,\" The Nineteenth Century and After, Vol. LX, pp. 453\u2013463.Swinnerton, p. 28."]}, {"page": "Richard Barham Middleton", "response": ["His work was also published by Austin Harrison in The English Review, and he wrote book reviews for The Academy.Henry Savage (1922) Richard Middleton: The Man And His Work, Cecil Palmer, London."]}, {"page": "List of Old Harrovians", "response": ["*Austin Harrison (1873\u20131928), British journalist and editor of The English Review (1909\u20131923)Harrow, 1800\u20131911, p. 660"]}, {"page": "Austin (given name)", "response": ["*Austin Harrison (1873\u20131928), British journalist"]}, {"page": "George Makgill", "response": ["Makgill's novels were often colonial adventure stories; he also wrote for Austin Harrison's English Review on the Anti-German Union (December 1915 and February 1916) and on imperial reconstruction (April 1917)."]}, {"page": "The English Review", "response": ["With the magazine struggling, Hueffer sold the magazine after publishing twelve issues to Alfred Mond.

In 1908, he left Reuters to join the Daily Mail, filing stories from Paris and covering the Portuguese revolution of 1910. He was in the Balkans at the outbreak of World War I and became one of the first accredited war correspondents in March 1915. William Beach Thomas had been reporting the war for the Daily Mail in the period before official accreditations were granted.
