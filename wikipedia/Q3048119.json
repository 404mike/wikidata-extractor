The main function was to produce professional engineers through the engineering college, which would consist of college and school. Morel together with Yozo Yamao, head of the institution, endeavoured to find proper teaching staff through their connections, while construction work of the college school was commended by surveyors of the Public Works in the end of 1871. After Morel passed away, Yamao consulted with Hugh Matheson, who found teaching staff through his connection with Lewis Gordon, William Rankine and William Thompson. The principal appointed by Rankine was Henry Dyer, a 25-year-old scholar who just finished his engineering education in the University of Glasgow."]}, {"page": "Edmund Morel", "response": ["Edmund Morel may refer to:", "* Edmund Morel (railway engineer) (1840\u20131871), British railway civil engineer"]}, {"page": "Yamao Y\u014dz\u014d", "response": ["Soon after the Meiji Restoration took place, Yamao returned to Japan and joined the new Meiji government.

As Morel emphasised importance of engineers education and Colin Alexander McVean advised Yamao to set up survey department, Yamao successfully added these two departments into the new ministry in September 1871. After Morel passed away in October 1871, Yamao had to find new advisor for establishment of the engineering college, and eventually contacted Hugh Matheson again through good offices of McVean.Hideo Izumida: Reconsideration of Foundation of the Imperial College of Engineering, Transaction of Architectural Institute of Japan, 2017. Matheson kindly arranged appointment of teaching staff for the college lead by Henry Dyer through his connection with Lewis Gordon - William Rankine - William Thomson. Before arriving to Japan in June 1873, Dyer arranged calendar and syllabus for the engineering college on the board, which was accepted by Yamao without any revision. Yamao successfully established the college, which was officially renamed the Imperial College of Engineering in 1877.

Main function of the Engineering Institution was to manage the Imperial College of Engineering (the predecessor of the Tokyo Imperial University College of Engineering). One of the key roles of the ministry was locating, and if necessary, reverse engineering overseas technology. For example, in 1877, only a year after the invention of the telephone, engineers employed by the ministry had obtained examples and were attempting to create a domestic version.Nelson.
