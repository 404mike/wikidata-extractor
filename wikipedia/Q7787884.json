He is most notable for his discovery of new plant and animal species from South America in the Andes of Chile, Peru, and Bolivia, as well as in California. He was elected a Fellow of the Linnean Society in 1844. He collected at various times (after 1856) in the Santa Cruz Mountains. The specimens he collected were sent back to Europe for identification.\nBridges emigrated to California in 1856, the specimens collected during this period up to his 1865 death were presented to the National Herbarium at Washington by his widow. His father-in-law was Hugh Cuming.Bridges is reported to have been very excited about the prospect of discovering new species, writing in a letter dated 1858  from California to William Jackson Hooker at Kew Gardens:\n\n\"I can scarcely describe to you how pleasing and gratifying it has been to me to learn that in my collections you have found some new and rare plants--I was partially under the impression that from the labours of Douglas, Hartweg, Jeffrey, Lobb and other travelers from Europe with the many United States Exploring Expeditions that little or nothing remained to be discovered and only gleanings were left to those of us of the present day.\"As a result of his collecting, several new species were named after him, including:\n\nOctodon bridgesii Bridges's degu\nCopiapoa bridgesii Copiapoa de Bridges\nPenstemon bridgesii\nPomacea bridgesii Spike-topped apple snail", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Spot-winged falconet", "response": ["The holotype specimen of Harpagus curcumcinctus Kaup (Proc.

Greene would help Bridges to package the seeds he had collected for dispatch to Kew Gardens.Jepson, W.L. (1933). \"California botanical explorers; Thomas Bridges\". Madro\u00f1o, Vol. 2, No. 4, pp 84\u201388. When Greene took up residence at his house in Monterey, he set about developing the extensive gardens there. By the end of his life, the gardens contained one of the state's largest private collections of trees and shrubs\u2014over 400 varieties\u2014all of which Greene had marked and scientifically classified. He also took a keen interest in the Monterey Cypress grove at Cypress Point on the outskirts of Monterey. In 1929 he wrote a brief article on the history of the grove for the journal of the California Botanical Society in which he lamented that his efforts to have the grove declared a National Monument had been unsuccessful. He had personally counted and categorized the 10,500 cypress trees there.Greene, Harry Asland (March 1929). \"Historical Note on the Monterey Cypress at Cypress Point\".
