He is most notable for his discovery of new plant and animal species from South America in the Andes, and California. The specimens he collected were sent back to Europe for identification.\nBridges emigrated to California in 1856, the specimens collected during this period up to his 1865 death were presented to the National Herbarium at Washington by his widow.He is reported to have been very excited about the prospect of discovering new species, writing in a letter dated 1858  from California to William Jackson Hooker at Kew Gardens:\n\n\"I can scarcely describe to you how pleasing and gratifying it has been to me to learn that in my collections you have found some new and rare plants--I was partially under the impression that from the labours of Douglas, Hartweg, Jeffrey, Lobb and other travelers from Europe with the many United States Exploring Expeditions that little or nothing remained to be discovered and only gleanings were left to those of us of the present day.\"As a result of his collecting, several new species were named after him, including:\n\nOctodon bridgesii Bridges's degu\nCopiapoa bridgesii Copiapoa de Bridges\nPenstemon bridgesii\nPomacea bridgesii Spike-topped apple snail", "link_mentions": {}}}
