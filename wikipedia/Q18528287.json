She joined the London Society for Women's Suffrage but she did not get involved. By 1908 her father had retired and they moved to the Lake District where Marshall and her mother joined the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (NUWSS) and created the Keswick branch. Marshall was demonstrating what became best practice by establishing a stall in Keswick market to sell suffrage literature and raise awareness. In 1911, she joined the core group at the heart of the NUWSS working with Kathleen Courtney who had been elected honorary secretary. Catherine led the press department and represented the group at a meeting in Stockholm. When Edith Palliser was ill she took over as parliamentary secretary skilfully inspiring local groups to lobby their M.P.s whilst she applied direct pressure to key figures. Palliser resigned and Marshall took on her role. The NUWSS was effectively led by Courtney and Marshall. Marshall was involved with senior Liberal party politicians who claimed to support women's suffrage but in effect did little.

The women spoke on why women needed and deserved the vote whilst attempting to discredit opponents' arguments. They stressed their non militancy, non party and law abiding credentials to address a degree of fear by women of becoming identified with the \"shrieking sisterhood\" (WSPU). Locally there were immediate and legitimate reasons for unease and fear.  When Margaret Robertson spoke at a National Union of Teachers Association meeting in Leigh, some male members in the audience \"moodily twirled their moustaches and gazed at the floor\" and the chairman \"kept a few from that energy of opposition that often ends in blows\".Leigh Journal 6 November 1911 Wigan Archives Leigh Town Hall  This latent aggression on occasion resulted in violence, and in one instance was condoned by the local press.
