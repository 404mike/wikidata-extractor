Bain contributes vocals and plays guitar, synthesizer and keyboard for her music. As a teenager, Bain decided to pursue a career in music, having been taught music by her father during childhood. She began writing music under the moniker the Japanese House in 2012, after being introduced to Matty Healy of the 1975, who offered to help produce her music under the label Dirty Hit. She first rose to prominence after the release of her first single, \"Still\", which was a critical success and premiered on BBC Radio 1 presented by Zane Lowe.\nBain's androgynous vocals, heavy use of production, and elusive media presence fuelled fan speculation about her gender and identity after her first few singles were released. In 2015, Bain released her debut EP Pools to Bathe In and the follow-up EP Clean. These first two EPs were rooted in indie pop and synth-pop, and included experimentation with genres such as dream pop, folktronica, and electropop. She toured with Dirty Hit labelmates the 1975 and Wolf Alice in 2015 and 2016 before headlining tours of her own.\nHer third EP, Swim Against the Tide (2016) was influenced by 80s synthpop and technopop. Her fourth EP, Saw You in a Dream (2017) saw her continued experimentation with different genres of electronica and rock. Bain co-produced her first full-length album Good at Falling (2019) with George Daniel and American record producer BJ Burton. Her fifth EP, The LA Sessions (2019), featured live recordings of reimagined tracks from Good at Falling and Saw You in a Dream.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Buckinghamshire", "response": ["* Amber Bain, musician, known as The Japanese House"]}, {"page": "1995 in music", "response": ["*July 13 \u2013 The Japanese House, aka Amber Bain, an English singer-songwriter, musician, multi-instrumentalist "]}, {"page": "Falls Festival", "response": ["* The Japanese House (UK)"]}, {"page": "Reading and Leeds Festivals line-ups", "response": ["*The Japanese House", "*The Japanese House", "*The Japanese House"]}, {"page": "List of songs based on a film", "response": ["* \"Leon\" by The Japanese House about L\u00e9on: The Professional as a tribute for L\u00e9on Montana"]}, {"page": "Latitude Festival", "response": ["<BR>The Japanese House"]}, {"page": "Landslide (Fleetwood Mac song)", "response": ["* The Japanese House recorded a cover of this song for Spotify Singles, released 26 July 2017."]}, {"page": "List of NME covers", "response": ["*22/02/19 The Japanese House"]}, {"page": "List of musicians who play left-handed", "response": ["*Amber Bain (The Japanese House)"]}, {"page": "List of gay, lesbian or bisexual people: Ba\u2013Bh", "response": ["| Amber Mary Bain (The Japanese House)"]}, {"page": "Blissfields", "response": ["In an announcement video in January 2017, it was revealed that Metronomy would be headlining the Saturday night, later confirming The Cinematic Orchestra and DJ Yoda performing his Stranger Things mixtape would be the Friday and Thursday nights.
