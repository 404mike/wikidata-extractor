In a match against Yeovil Town in the League Cup, Digard scored a 30-yard goal and the score ended up 5\u20131 to Middlesbrough. After another substitute appearance in the 2\u20131 away defeat to Liverpool, he, once again, came off the bench in the 2\u20131 home win against Stoke City, which his misfire shot turned into an assist, with the ball falling to Tuncay to score the winner. During a 2\u20131 loss against Portsmouth on 13 September 2008, Digard suffered a knee injury and had to be substituted in the 70th minute. But he quickly returned to training shortly after. Since joining the club, Digard was involved in the first team for the side, playing in the midfield position. However, in mid\u2013December, he suffered a groin injury that kept him for almost a month.

After a serving three match suspension, he made his return on 7 February 2009, starting the match before being substituted in the 60th minute, in a 1\u20130 loss against Manchester City.

During the same month, Digard insisted in an interview that he had no regrets about his move to Middlesbrough, havingsettled at Middlesbrough. Following the three-month injury lay-off, Digard returned to the team squad as an unused substitute in a 0\u20130 draw against Fulham on 18 April 2009.
