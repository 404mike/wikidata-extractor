He was an authority on the history of architecture and particularly on British vernacular architecture. \nHe was born in Lowton and attended Bury High School, before studying architecture under Reginald Cordingley at the University of Manchester. After a two-year stint with the British Army, Brunskill was appointed to a London County Council commission of architects. He left that position to teach at his alma mater, then spent a year at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as a Commonwealth Fund fellow. He joined Williams Deacon's Bank in 1957, and oversaw the maintenance of 250 branch offices, designing twenty new buildings. Brunskill returned to Manchester as reader in 1960.\nBrunskill contributed significantly to assessing the date, extent and impact of the Great Rebuilding of England. Brunskill accepted that for much of England W. G. Hoskins's thesis that the Great Rebuilding spanned the period from 1570 to 1640. But Brunskill contended that the period varied both by region and by social class: starting in South East England and among the higher-income social classes, and then spreading both geographically west and north and socially to lower-income classes.In 1990 Brunskill was awarded an OBE for services to conservation. He was married to Miriam Allsopp, with whom he had two daughters, from 1960 until his death in 2015.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Vernacular architecture", "response": ["Although vernacular architecture might be designed by people who do have some training in design, in 1971 Ronald Brunskill nonetheless defined vernacular architecture as:"]}, {"page": "Wilmslow", "response": ["* Ronald Brunskill (1929 \u2013 2015) architectural historian"]}, {"page": "Connected farm", "response": ["Connected structures have existed in England and Wales for centuries. The architectural historian Ronald Brunskill identified four key types of connected farm structures found in England and Wales. The longhouse is generally two connected buildings which result from the addition of more and more partitions, thus subdividing the structure, or from the outright construction of a new building adjacent to the original. Longhouses usually have cross passages, and communication flows freely through the structures. The laithe house confines the family and the farm building under the same roof. However, there are no cross passages and no intercommunication between structures. Typical configurations include farm buildings used for both livestock and grain/hay storage. The bastle house is an arrangement which places the living quarters above the farm building and, usually, the farm animals. This type of connected farm was common as a defensive arrangement; living quarters were located high above for security reasons. In what Brunskill called the \"simply connected arrangement\" the domestic structure is connected to any type of farm building."]}, {"page": "Bank barn", "response": ["The architectural historian Ronald Brunskill states that, although the British examples are older, the term \"bank barn\" is an imported term \"to describe a type of farm building which is so common in certain parts of Britain that it has developed no descriptive term of its own\"."]}, {"page": "Great Rebuilding", "response": ["The precise time period, extent and impact of \"The Great Rebuilding\" is contested.
