She reacted badly to her eccentric, unloving parents and lived much of her life with her governess. She never married but became passionately attached to Russian painter Pavel Tchelitchew, and her home was always open to London's poetic circle, to whom she was generous and helpful.\nSitwell published poetry continuously from 1913, some of it abstract and set to music. With her dramatic style and exotic costumes, she was sometimes labelled a poseur, but her work was praised for its solid technique and painstaking craftsmanship. She was a recipient of the Benson Medal.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "December 9", "response": ["*1964 \u2013 Edith Sitwell, English poet and critic (b. 1887)"]}, {"page": "Dylan Thomas", "response": ["Thomas was a teenager when many of the poems for which he became famous were published: \"And death shall have no dominion\", \"Before I Knocked\" and \"The Force That Through the Green Fuse Drives the Flower\". \"And death shall have no dominion\" appeared in the New English Weekly in May 1933. When \"Light breaks where no sun shines\" appeared in The Listener in 1934, it caught the attention of three senior figures in literary London, T. S. Eliot, Geoffrey Grigson and Stephen Spender.Ferris (1989), p. 91Ferris (1989), p. 102 They contacted Thomas and his first poetry volume, 18 Poems, was published in December 1934. 18 Poems was noted for its visionary qualities which led to critic Desmond Hawkins writing that the work was \"the sort of bomb that bursts no more than once in three years\". The volume was critically acclaimed and won a contest run by the Sunday Referee, netting him new admirers from the London poetry world, including Edith Sitwell and Edwin Muir. The anthology was published by Fortune Press, in part a vanity publisher that did not pay its writers and expected them to buy a certain number of copies themselves.  A similar arrangement was used by other new authors including Philip Larkin. In September 1935, Thomas met Vernon Watkins, thus beginning a lifelong friendship. Thomas introduced Watkins, working at Lloyds Bank at the time, to his friends, now known as The Kardomah Gang. In those days, Thomas used to frequent the cinema on Mondays with Tom Warner who, like Watkins, had recently suffered a nervous breakdown. After these trips, Warner would bring Thomas back for supper with his aunt. On one occasion, when she served him a boiled egg, she had to cut its top off for him, as Thomas did not know how to do this. This was because his mother had done it for him all his life, an example of her coddling him. Years later, his wife Caitlin would still have to prepare his eggs for him. In December 1935 Thomas contributed the poem \"The Hand That Signed the Paper\" to Issue 18 of the bi-monthly New Verse. In 1936, his next collection Twenty-five Poems, published by J. M. Dent, also received much critical praise. In all, he wrote half his poems while living at Cwmdonkin Drive before moving to London.

After the 1976 Aldeburgh Festival, Britten and Pears travelled to Norway, where Britten began writing Praise We Great Men, for voices and orchestra based on a poem by Edith Sitwell. He returned to Aldeburgh in August, and wrote Welcome Ode for children's choir and orchestra. In November, Britten realised that he could no longer compose. On his 63rd birthday, 22 November, at his request Rita Thomson organised a champagne party and invited his friends and his sisters Barbara and Beth, to say their goodbyes to the dying composer. When Rostropovich made his farewell visit a few days later, Britten gave him what he had written of Praise We Great Men.", "Smaller-scale works for accompanied voice include the five Canticles, composed between 1947 and 1974. They are written for a variety of voices (tenor in all five; counter-tenor or alto in II and IV and baritone in IV) and accompaniments (piano in I to IV, horn in III and harp in V).\"Canticle I\" , \"Canticle II\" , \"Canticle III\" , \"Canticle IV\" , and \"Canticle V\" , Britten-Pears Foundation, accessed 30 June 2013 The first is a setting of Francis Quarles's 17th-century poem \"A Divine Rapture\", and according to Britten was modelled on Purcell's Divine Hymns. Matthews describes it as one of the composer's most serene works, which \"ends in a mood of untroubled happiness that would soon become rare in Britten's music\". The second Canticle was written in 1952, between Billy Budd and Gloriana, on the theme of Abraham's obedience to Divine Authority in the proffered sacrifice of his son Isaac.  \"Canticle III\" from 1954 is a setting of Edith Sitwell's wartime poem \"Still Falls the Rain\", composed just after The Turn of the Screw with which it is structurally and stylistically associated. The twelve-note cycle in the first five bars of the piano part of the Canticle introduced a feature that became thereafter a regular part of Britten's compositional technique. The fourth Canticle, premiered in 1971 is based on T. S. Eliot's poem \"Journey of the Magi\". It is musically close to The Burning Fiery Furnace of 1966; Matthews refers to it as a \"companion piece\" to the earlier work. The final Canticle was another Eliot setting, his juvenile poem \"Death of Saint Narcissus\". Although Britten had little idea of what the poem was about, the musicologist Arnold Whittall finds the text \"almost frighteningly apt\u00a0... for a composer conscious of his own sickness\". Matthews sees Narcissus as \"another figure from [Britten's] magic world of dreams and ideal beauty\"."]}, {"page": "List of poets", "response": ["*Edith Sitwell (1887\u20131964), English poet and critic; eldest of three literary Sitwells"]}, {"page": "Sgt.

On leaving the university, he was taken up by the literary Sitwell siblings, who provided him with a home and a cultural education. His earliest work of note was a collaboration with Edith Sitwell, Fa\u00e7ade, which at first brought him notoriety as a modernist, but later became a popular ballet score.", "In 1923, in collaboration with Edith Sitwell, Walton had his first great success, though at first it was a succ\u00e8s de scandale. Fa\u00e7ade was first performed in public at the Aeolian Hall, London, on 12 June. The work consisted of Edith's verses, which she recited through a megaphone from behind a screen, while Walton conducted an ensemble of six players in his accompanying music. The press was generally condemnatory. Walton's biographer Michael Kennedy cites as typical a contemporary headline: \"Drivel That They Paid to Hear\". The Daily Express loathed the work, but admitted that it was naggingly memorable.\"Poetry Through a Megaphone\", The Daily Express, 13 June 1923, p. 7 The Manchester Guardian wrote of \"relentless cacophony\".\"Futuristic Music and Poetry\", The Manchester Guardian, 13 June 1923, p. 3 The Observer condemned the verses and dismissed Walton's music as \"harmless\".\"Music of the Week\", The Observer, 17 June 1923, p. 10 In The Illustrated London News, Dent was much more appreciative: \"The audience was at first inclined to treat the whole thing as an absurd joke, but there is always a surprisingly serious element in Miss Sitwell's poetry and Mr Walton's music ... which soon induced the audience to listen with breathless attention.\"\"The World of Music\", The Illustrated London News, 23 June 1923, p. 1122 In The Sunday Times, Ernest Newman said of Walton, \"as a musical joker he is a jewel of the first water\".Kennedy, p. 31", "From the days of 78\u00a0rpm discs, when relatively little modern music was being put on record, Walton was favoured by the record companies. In 1929 the small, new Decca company recorded eleven movements from Fa\u00e7ade, with the composer conducting a chamber ensemble, with the speakers Edith Sitwell and Walton's friend and colleague Constant Lambert.       In the 1930s, Walton also had two of his major orchestral works on disc, both on Decca, the First Symphony recorded by Harty and the London Symphony Orchestra, and the Viola Concerto with Frederick Riddle and the LSO conducted by the composer.Greenfield, Edward. \"Sir William Walton (1902\u20131983)\", Gramophone, May 1983, p. 18 In the 1940s Walton moved from Decca to its older, larger rival, EMI. The EMI producer Walter Legge arranged a series of recordings of Walton's major works and many minor ones over the next twenty years; a rival composer expressed the view that if Walton had an attack of flatulence (he used an earthier expression), Walter Legge would record it.Greenfield, Edward. \"The Music of William Walton\", Gramophone, October 1994, p. 92"]}, {"page": "Symbolism (arts)", "response": ["* Edith Sitwell (1887\u20131964)"]}, {"page": "The Road to Wigan Pier", "response": ["In general, early reviewers of The Road to Wigan Pier praised Orwell's depiction of the working class in Part I.
