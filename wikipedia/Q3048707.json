After his death Ruskin's works were collected in the 39-volume \"Library Edition\", completed in 1912 by his friends Edward Tyas Cook and Alexander Wedderburn. The range and quantity of Ruskin's writing, and its complex, allusive and associative method of expression, cause certain difficulties. In 1898, John A. Hobson observed that in attempting to summarise Ruskin's thought, and by extracting passages from across his work, \"the spell of his eloquence is broken\".J. A. Hobson, John Ruskin: Social Reformer (J. Nisbet & Co., 1898), p. viii. Clive Wilmer has written, further, that, \"The anthologising of short purple passages, removed from their intended contexts [... is] something which Ruskin himself detested and which has bedevilled his reputation from the start.\"Clive Wilmer (ed.), Unto This Last and Other Writings (Penguin, 1985), pp. 36\u201337.

Strachey regarded Nightingale as an intense, driven woman who was both personally intolerable and admirable in her achievements.Florence Nightingale, Monica E. Baly and H. C. G.

The German and American press questioned the veracity of many stories, and the fact that the British Press Bureau did not censor the stories put the British government in a delicate position. The Bryce Committee was eventually appointed in December 1914 to investigate. Bryce was considered highly suitable to lead the effort because of his prewar pro-German attitudes and his good reputation in the United States, where he had served as Britain's ambassador, as well as his legal expertise."]}, {"page": "List of people from Brighton and Hove", "response": ["*Edward Tyas Cook, journalist, editor, man of letters, born in Brighton in 1857"]}, {"page": "The Westminster Gazette", "response": ["* 1893: Edward Tyas Cook"]}, {"page": "The Daily News (UK)", "response": [":1896: Edward Tyas Cook"]}, {"page": "Sir Edward Tyas Cook", "response": ["#REDIRECT Edward Tyas Cook"]}, {"page": "Tyas", "response": ["* Edward Tyas Cook (1857\u20131919), English journalist, biographer, and man of letters"]}, {"page": "Edward Cook", "response": ["*Edward Tyas Cook (1857\u20131919), English journalist, biographer, and man of letters"]}, {"page": "List of book-based war films (1775\u20131898 wars)", "response": ["|Florence Nightingale || 1915 || Maurice Elvey || UK || The Life of Florence Nightingale || Edward Tyas Cook || 1913 || Non-fiction"]}, {"page": "J.
