Robson had served in the First World War with the Seaforth Highlanders; after returning home he played for local side Vale of Leithen. In November 1921, Robson was signed by Arsenal for \u00a35, and initially was the club's third-choice goalkeeper behind Ernest Williamson and Stephen Dunn. With little experience and his lack of height, he was never expected to be thrust into the first team, but after first Williamson and then Dunn suffered poor form, Robson made his debut for Arsenal against Bolton Wanderers on 26 December 1922. Arsenal won 5-0 and Robson kept his place.\nRobson played for the rest of the 1922\u201323 season, keeping twelve clean sheets in twenty matches, and he became an ever-present in the Arsenal side for the next season and a half; Arsenal were by no means a top side at this time, flirting dangerously with relegation in 1924 and 1925, but Robson's athletic keeping helped keep them up. However, after Welsh international Dan Lewis joined Arsenal in late 1924, Robson had to share goalkeeping duties with him.\nRobson started the 1925\u201326 season as first-choice but after new Arsenal manager Herbert Chapman signed Bill Harper in November 1925, Robson's days at Arsenal were numbered. He made his last first-team appearance in a 5\u20132 win against Manchester City on 7 November 1925. After spending the rest of the season in the reserves, Robson left Arsenal in August 1926 for Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic. In all, he played 101 matches for Arsenal.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dan Lewis (footballer)", "response": ["After Herbert Chapman arrived as Arsenal manager in 1925, Lewis shared goalkeeping duties with Jock Robson and Bill Harper, but Lewis gradually became the club's No. 1, particularly after Robson and Harper left in 1926 and 1927 respectively. He won his first cap for Wales in a 3\u20133 draw against England on 12 February 1927.

However, by this time his Arsenal place was under threat; after conceding fourteen goals first in five matches during 1922\u201323 he had been dropped in favour of Dunn, and later Jock Robson. In June 1923 he left Arsenal for free to go to Norwich City. In all he played 113 official first-class matches for Arsenal, in addition to his unofficial wartime matches."]}, {"page": "Bill Harper (footballer, born 1897)", "response": ["In November 1925 Harper became one of Arsenal manager Herbert Chapman's first signings, joining the club for \u00a34,000, then a record fee for a goalkeeper.

Harper finished 1925\u201326 and started 1926\u201327 as Arsenal's first choice keeper, but Chapman blamed Harper for a 4\u20132 defeat in a North London derby against Tottenham Hotspur on 18 December 1926 and ruthlessly dropped him in favour of Dan Lewis."]}, {"page": "John Moody (footballer)", "response": ["Moody was born in Heeley, Sheffield and first played in local football in the Sheffield Amateur League.
