Sargent", "response": ["In about 1887 Sargent, who was running a theatrical agency in London, signed an English amateur actress called, Emily Jane Vertue Churchill-Jodrell (1850-1895).  She had family connections to the aristocracy, her grandfather being Sir Richard Paul Jodrell, 2nd Baronet Lombe, of Great Melton, co. Norfolk.  A tour was planned for her in England starting in Liverpool with her own company, managed by Sargent and Sidney Herberte-Basing.  Her publicity claimed that she would be taking part in a world tour that included America and Australia.  She and Sargent arrived in America in 1888 but success eluded them.  They returned to England, where Churchill-Jordell took a lease on the Novelty Theatre, Great Queen Street in London, with Sargent as her manager.  It was renamed the Jodrell Theatre and opened on October 22, 1888, but in February 1889 had closed with financial losses.  Their next venture together was a form of variety theatre called Cagliostromantheon in Waterloo House, Pall, Mall, London.  Sargent was the proprietor on this occasion, with Churchill-Jodrell appearing on the bill with a monologue written for her by Sargent and others.  Within a few months the undertaking had failed, and bankruptcy proceedings were brought against him in August 1891.  One of the actors who had not been paid, Arthur Playfair, tried to sue Churchill-Jodrell for his loss, claiming that she was Sargent's business partner and, therefore, liable.  She told the court that she had lent Sargent the money (\u00a31300), but later paid him an addition \u00a3500 to be released from any partnership agreement.  At the later bankruptcy hearing it transpired that Sargent and Churchill-Jodrell lived at the same address in London, she had paid for a recent vacation they took together in Monte Carlo and had lent him the diamond rings that he wore."]}, {"page": "Faith Compton Mackenzie", "response": ["Between 1901 and 1905 she was an actress, under the stage name \"Faith Reynolds\", in Sir Charles Hawtrey's company, appearing in London and New York, initially in his production of A Message from Mars.
