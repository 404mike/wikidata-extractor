After the match, Manager Neil Harris said: \"What Jimmy's got is the ability to make a forward run at the right time. I'm always on at Jim \u2013 and I\u2019ve known him a long time \u2013 about finishing, finishing, finishing. The way we play and the form we\u2019ve been in over the last 10 months our midfield players should be scoring goals. Jimmy had three really good opportunities last week (against Nottingham Forest) that could have won us the game comfortably, and he didn't take them. So I'm really pleased that he scored.\" However, he found himself competing in the midfield position against Shaun Williams, Ben Thompson. This resulted him dropped into the substitute bench for the most of the 2016\u201317 season and to get playing time, Abdou played for the club's reserve side. Despite this, Abdou made first team starts on several occasions throughout the season. Towards the end of the 2016\u201317 season, he was the last four starts for the side, including playing in both legs against Scunthorpe United in the League One play-offs and won 3\u20132 on aggregate. Abdou started in the League One play-off Final, as he helped the side beat Bradford City 1\u20130 to see the side promoted to the Championship. At the end of the 2016\u201317 season, Abdou went on to make twenty\u2013two appearances and scoring once for the side. Following this, he signed a one\u2013year contract with the club."]}, {"page": "2016 Football League One play-off Final", "response": ["No changes were made by either side during the break and Barnsley kicked off the second half.  Millwall dominated the early stages of the second half but in the 56th minute, Hamill's double-chance was saved by Archer.  Three minutes later, Gregory's chance was collected by Adam Davies before Hammill's 63rd minute strike was easily saved by Archer.  Marc Roberts was then booked in the 63rd minute for a challenge on Gregory.  Morison then went round the Barnsley goalkeeper and although his cross found O'Brien, the resulting shot was saved by Davies.  In the 74th minute, Lloyd Isgrove extended Barnsley's lead.  A corner from Hourihane was missed by Archer and Isgrove headed into the Millwall goal.  Two minutes later, Fred Onyedinma was brought on for Ben Thompson, and in the 82nd minute, Edwards was replaced by Shaun Williams.  Isgrove was then substituted by Marley Watkins before O'Brien's pass to Taylor ended in the latter's shot being saved by Davies.
