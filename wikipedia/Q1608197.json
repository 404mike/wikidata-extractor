He became a well-known cycling journalist and later founded the Motor Review.Duncan was recruited by H. J.

After Lawson's death, Herbert Osbaldeston Duncan, former Commercial Manager of his British Motor Syndicate, described him thus: \"He was neither a greedy man nor an egoist. On the contrary he was always fair and extremely generous. He paid largely and was most liberal in the golden days of his success. A cheque was always ready to be handed over with a kindly smile to friends who assisted him with his dealings or company-promoting schemes. Lawson was a clever man. Perhaps his greatest misfortune was in not being supported properly in his business by others equally intelligent.\"  (Duncan, Herbert Osbaldeston  The World on Wheels, thrilling true tales of the Cycle & Automobile Industry, vol 2.
