In 1953, his colleague James Robertson produced a short and controversial documentary film, titled A Two-Year-Old Goes to Hospital, demonstrating the almost-immediate effects of maternal separation. Bowlby's report, coupled with Robertson's film, demonstrated the importance of the primary caregiver in human and non-human primate development. Bowlby de-emphasized the mother's role in feeding as a basis for the development of a strong mother\u2013child relationship, but his conclusions generated much debate. It was the debate concerning the reasons behind the demonstrated need for maternal care that Harlow addressed in his studies with surrogates. Physical contact with infants was considered harmful to their development, and this view led to sterile, contact-less nurseries across the country. Bowlby disagreed, claiming that the mother provides much more than food to the infant, including a unique bond that positively influences the child's development and mental health."]}, {"page": "Attachment theory", "response": ["Bowlby's contemporary Ren\u00e9 Spitz observed separated children's grief, proposing that \"psychotoxic\" results were brought about by inappropriate experiences of early care.

This film was instrumental in a campaign to alter hospital restrictions on visiting by parents. In 1952 when he and Robertson presented their film A Two Year Old Goes to Hospital to the British Psychoanalytical Society, psychoanalysts did not accept that a child would mourn or experience grief on separation but instead saw the child's distress as caused by elements of unconscious fantasies (in the film because the mother was pregnant).

Before this movement, visiting by parents was usually restricted and sometimes forbidden in certain hospitals.

Robertson focused his research on separation of mother and child due to hospital admission.", "The report was commissioned on 12 June 1956. Sir Harry Platt, who was a former president of the Royal College of Surgeons of England was chosen to be Chairman of the committee. The committee met 20 times to take evidence from both sides of the debate in a manner that was scrupulously fair. Both parents and health professionals as well as children's organisations including charities gave evidence. The Association of British Paediatric Nurses provided evidence to the contrary, arguing for the status quo, that frequent visitors bought infection into the ward. Both James Robertson and John Bowlby also provided evidence. James Robertson appeared in front of the committee with Dermod MacCarthy to show his film A Two-Year-Old Goes to Hospital, but upon requesting the BBC to show the film nationally, were refused, as the BBC had consulted medical opinion, which agreed that the film would cause anxiety to parents. However, the evidence provided by James and Joyce Robertson was extremely influential to the final recommendations of the report. The final report was sent to Lord Cohen of Birkenhead, Chair of the Central Health Services Council on 28 October 1958.", "During the twenty years after the Platt Report, parents wanting to visit their sick child who were formerly excluded, moved to parents being tolerated by the medical community when they wanted to visit their sick child and this was a break from what could be considered tradition and a move towards a more humanitarian viewpoint. James Robertson continued to research the problem and to share his findings. He wrote four influential articles for The Observer and The Guardian newspapers to disseminate his ideas, and the issue started to gain traction. In 1961, the BBC agreed to show excerpts of A Two-Year-Old Goes to Hospital and his other films  and Robertson gave an live introduction to the films and asked parents to submit their experiences of hospital care to him.

In the late 1940s Robertson worked with Anna Freud first at the Well Baby Clinic and later in the Hampstead Child Therapy Clinic. She was later joined by her husband James Robertson.  In 1965, both of them moved to the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations to work with John Bowlby on the Young Children in Brief Separation project and the development of attachment theory. This was to research the mental state and psychological development of children who underwent brief separation from their parents. Later in her career, Robertson worked with her husband  to produce a series of celebrated documentary films that highlighted the reaction of small children who were separated from their parents. These were shown in hospitals, foster care and state run hospitals. Later she was known for promoting the idea of foster care instead of residential nurseries. ", "Robertson came from a large working-class family in London. Robertson left Grammar school in 1933 when she was 14 and enrolled for evening classes at the Workers' Educational Association. In 1939, Joyce met her husband John Robertson in Birmingham while he was studying the humanities at the Fircroft College for the Higher Education of Working Men and she was studying at the Hillcroft college for working women. During World War II, both Joyce and her James Robertson were  conscientious objectors. In late 1940 both Joyce and her husband were working at the Pacifist Service Unit, in East London with the victims of the bombing.", "In January 1941, Robertson as a student went to work with Anna Freud and Dorothy Burlingham in Hampstead to look after babies. Freud and Burlingham at the time were offering shelter to women with families who had been bombed out. Knowing that Robertson came from a large family and as she was the only Briton in the war nurseries, Freud employed her and asked her to research the different methods of childcare and to determine if there was types of practices in use and write detailed observations on pieces of card. A few weeks later, James Robertson was employed by Freud as a boilerman,  fire watcher and handyman. At that time, James Robertson was courting Joyce Robertson and it was through her that James met Freud.", "She didn't return to work with Freud until 1957, when her second daughter started primary school. She worked initially in the Well Baby Clinic. At the clinic, she started the first parent-toddler group. Joyce understood that the parents would need help in understanding their infant's new development stage, once they moved out of the clinic. Later she moved to kindergarten of the Hampstead Child Therapy Clinic. In 1948, her husband James Robertson joined the Tavistock Clinic to make observations of the behaviour of small children.", "The Robertsons started their work by conducting a comprehensive research review, similar to the type of review that Yarrow conducted. Their purpose in the project was to study the influence of variables including age, level of maturity and object constancy, previous parent-child relationships and quality of substitute care on responses of young children to separation from their mother, all to illustrate optimal substitute care. The subjects that were to be selected were to be aged between 1.5 and 2.5 years and be healthy, loved and never been out of their mothers care. The methods to use involved non-statistical naturalist observations throughout day, when they are away with the use of checklists along with tape recordings. During the 1950s, James Robertson had used a 16mm movie camera to study the reactions of young children who were being admitted to hospital for treatment, and planned to film, Cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 recordings of around 20 minutes every day, that could be studied later.", "The findings from the project which ran from 1965 to 1976 were contrary to much of the published literature. Separation per se did not cause acute stress and despair, but rather anxiety that could be kept to a minimum and development allowed to continue. Data indicated that 1  year olds make a complete transfer to the caretaker, while 2  year olds are more ambivalent. The institutionalized child displayed evidence of trauma and cumulative stresses after six years. Their 1971 paper Young Children in Brief Separation, A Fresh Look was also published in the journal, The Psychoanalytic Study of the Child. In the summary section, the Robertsons concluded that Bowlby had overgeneralised James Robertson earlier findings of how children respond in institutional settings. They concluded by stating:", "* Robertson Films, a site giving details of Joyce and James Robertson's work"]}]}}
