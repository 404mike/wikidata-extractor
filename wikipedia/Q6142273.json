His sensitive observations and brilliant observations made history, and the courage with which he disseminated \u2013 often in the face of ignorant and prejudiced criticism \u2013 what were then very unpopular findings, was legendary.  He will always be remembered as the man who revolutionised children's hospitals, though he accomplished much else besides.
