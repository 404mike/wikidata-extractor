His younger brother Rory Boulding also joined Mansfield at the same time. His first game back at Mansfield was on the opening day of the 2006\u201307 season in a 2\u20132 draw with Shrewsbury Town, before he scored in the following game as Mansfield defeated Milton Keynes Dons 2\u20131. At the end of September he was sidelined by a knee injury, which kept him out of the side for a month, and in January 2007 he was angry after he was dropped to the substitutes' bench in favour of fellow strikers Barry Conlon and Martin Gritton for a game against Hereford United. Mansfield won the game 3\u20131 with Boulding coming on to score one of the goals.

Two weeks after pre-season training started, City played their first friendly when they lost 3\u20131 to Farsley Celtic, the only City goal coming from a Barry Conlon penalty. City's side included several trialists, including goalkeeper Nick Colgan, Korey Nix (brother of City midfielder Kyle) and Rory Boulding. Rory's elder brother Michael, who had also been training with City, was unable to play because of an injury. The second pre-season came three days later, when City defeated Bradford rivals Bradford Park Avenue 3\u20131, selecting a squad which included a number of youth team players. City's third friendly was a 2\u20131 defeat by another West Yorkshire non-league side, Guiseley, who featured former Bradford player David Brown on trial. City embarked on a short tour of Scotland, where they defeated Dundee 1\u20130 but lost 4\u20130 to Motherwell. During the tour, the club signed brothers Michael and Rory Boulding on free transfers. Upon their return to England, City lost their next friendly 2\u20131 to Burnley. Following his form in several trial games, including a string of saves against Burnley, goalkeeper Rhys Evans, who had played on loan the previous season with City, became City's latest signing on 1 August 2008. Three days later, City's next friendly resulted in a 1\u20130 victory against League One side Oldham Athletic. The final pre-season friendly was played behind closed doors, when City lost 2\u20130 to Sheffield Wednesday with a team made up of juniors and reserve players.
