In 1942, he became general secretary of the CSCA after his predecessor, William Brown, was elected to Parliament.White was known as a communist sympathiser, and although he never joined the Communist Party of Great Britain, he served on the editorial board of the Daily Worker from 1946.  Brown was highly critical of this, and campaigned for the CSCA to ban communists from holding office.  This was not successful, and White became known as a skillful and impartial leader.  In 1954, he was offered general secretaryship of the Civil Service Whitley Council, the leading post in civil service trade unionism.  However, he died suddenly in May 1955, before he could take up the role.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "POA (trade union)", "response": ["The above situation began to change in 1936, when a group of prison officers, including Harley Cronin, who had become weary of the failure of Representative Boards to win concessions were elected to the Central Board. One of the first moves of this group was to procure the services of William Brown and Len White of the Civil Service Clerical Association to help them negotiate with the Prisons Service through a series of secret meetings. The Central Board members made a formal demand to the Home Secretary, Sir Samuel Hoare, that Prison Officers should have the right to appeal to an Independent Arbitration Board against employers' decisions and to have access to outside assistance in doing so. These demands were recognised and Brown and White, began formally pushing for the right to use the Civil Service Arbitration Tribunal, which was also conceded. In celebration of winning these demands prison officers held a meeting on 5 April 1938 at the Blue Gliss Hall in Acton."]}, {"page": "Len White", "response": ["Len White's brother Jack White was also a professional footballer playing centre half for Aldershot and Bristol City before managing non league Cambridge City and Wellington Town."]}, {"page": "Civil and Public Services Association", "response": [":1942: Len White"]}, {"page": "Leonard White", "response": ["* Len White (trade unionist) (died 1955), British trade union leader"]}, {"page": "George Green (trade unionist)", "response": ["Green served for some years as the deputy general secretary of the Civil Service Clerical Association (CSCA).

This alliance proved far more enduring."]}]}}
