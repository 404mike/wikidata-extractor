In the 50th minute, the score was levelled by Quinn.  He evaded Youds to head a Summerbee corner between the near post and Mark Bowen, making it 1\u20131.  Kinsella then came close to scoring from a free kick and Quinn missed a good chance, shooting over the crossbar, before Phillips put Sunderland ahead in the 58th minute.   Having been put through by Clark, he lobbed Ili\u0107 to make it 2\u20131.  Charlton made their first change of the game minutes later, Heaney being replaced by Steve Jones.  In the 71st minute, Richard Rufus passed to Mendonca, who took two touches and struck the ball into the Sunderland goal, levelling the match once again.  Two minutes later, Quinn put Sunderland ahead: after controlling a deep cross from Clark using his chest, the Sunderland forward struck the ball past Ili\u0107, making it 3\u20132.  Phillips was then replaced by Danny Dichio who quickly missed a chance by electing to attempt a volley rather than a diving header from a Summerbee cross. Mendonca was then prevented from scoring twice by the Sunderland defence, before Rufus brought the game level once again.  P\u00e9rez missed an attempted clearance on a Robinson corner, having been blocked by Bright, and Rufus was left unmarked to score his first Charlton goal in 165 appearances for the club, and make it 3\u20133 with five minutes remaining.
