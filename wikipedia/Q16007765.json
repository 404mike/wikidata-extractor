He was born in Northampton. His father was Head of the Boot and Shoe Department of Leicester College of Technology.\nBrookes trained in Silversmithing at the Chipping Campden Guild of Handicrafts. He was an accomplished artist but became both an inspirational teacher and accomplished administrator. In 1922 he was appointed as a part-time teacher of sculpture in the Oxford City School of Arts and Craft.\nIn 1934 the technical and art schools were merged as the Schools of Technology Art and Commerce. John Henry Brookes was the first principal. There were 10 full-time staff and 1,284 students. By 1946 the Schools were in 19 sites around the city and John Henry Brookes had of necessity become an accomplished cyclist.\nWith the spread of the Schools around the town there was a great desire to move them all onto one site. The Morrells brewing family offered 33 acres at the top of Headington Hill and plans were drawn up. Unfortunately the City Council turned them down. There was a great public protest and a citizens meeting was held in a packed Town Hall. Eventually the plans were approved. The foundation stone was laid by Lord Nuffield.\nJohn Henry Brookes encouraged printing as a discipline in the college and also had many of his own drawings published.  For many years his pen and ink drawings were a regular feature of the Oxford Times.\nHe was very much involved in the Oxford community and was on many committees especially those concerned with young people. He served as a magistrate for many years and when he retired from the college he became one of the directors of the Oxford Playhouse.\nBuilt on John Henry Brookes's solid foundations the Schools of Technology Art and Commerce evolved into Oxford College of Technology, Oxford Polytechnic, and finally into Oxford Brookes University.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Brookes", "response": ["John Brookes may refer to:", "*John Brookes (East India Company), 17th century commander of first British vessel to come within sight of the Australian continent", "*Sir John Brookes, 1st Baronet (died 1691), English MP", "*John Brookes (footballer, born 1927) (1927\u20132018), English football midfielder", "*John Brookes (footballer, born 1945), English football forward", "*John Brookes (landscape designer) (1933\u20132018), British garden and landscape designer"]}]}}
