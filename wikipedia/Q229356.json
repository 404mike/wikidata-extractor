Morrissey's songwriting was influenced by punk rock and post-punk bands such as New York Dolls, the Cramps, the Specials and the Cult, along with 1960s girl groups and singers such as Dusty Springfield, Sandie Shaw, Marianne Faithfull and Timi Yuro. Morrissey's lyrics, while superficially depressing, were often full of mordant humour; John Peel remarked that the Smiths were one of the few bands capable of making him laugh out loud. Influenced by his childhood interest in the social realism of 1960s \"kitchen sink\" television plays, Morrissey wrote about ordinary people and their experiences with despair, rejection and death. While \"songs such as 'Still Ill' sealed his role as spokesman for disaffected youth\", Morrissey's \"manic-depressive rants\" and his \"'woe-is-me' posture inspired some hostile critics to dismiss the Smiths as 'miserabilists.'\""]}, {"page": "Eurovision Song Contest 1968", "response": ["The Eurovision Song Contest 1968 was the 13th edition of the annual Eurovision Song Contest.

The dramatic and emotive \"I Just Don't Know What to Do with Myself\" set the standard for much of her later material.
