He was a founding member of the Cult. He also played and recorded with Theatre of Hate, Sex Gang Children, the Baby Snakes, the Gun Club and DeLuca.\nHe appeared on Top of the Pops for the first time with Theatre of Hate in 1982, playing their Top 40 single \"Do You Believe in the West World\".He played on Sex Gang's 1983 single \"Mauritia Mayer\", then switched places with Death Cult's drummer Ray Mondo that September.\nHis biggest hit was \"She Sells Sanctuary\" by the Cult from their Love album. Recorded in March 1985, the song was released as their fourth single and hit No. 15 in the UK Singles Chart. It re-entered the charts at No. 56 in September 1986, spending 14 consecutive weeks on the charts. The song was later voted No. 18 in VH1's Indie 100. Preston refused to accept being put on wages after the song became a hit, and his bandmates believed him to be unreliable due to his use of drugs; these matters led to his departure from the band in June 1985.After the Cult, Preston worked with Nile Rodgers in New York. He also played in the band DeLuca with Albie DeLuca (Gene Loves Jezebel) and Gary McDowell (Modern English).In 1990, he joined Irish rock band the Baby Snakes, but soon afterward was sent to prison for armed robbery. After his release, he also performed with the Gun Club.Preston died of a drug overdose on 1 April 1992, three days before his 29th birthday.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Cult", "response": ["In April 1983, Astbury teamed up with guitarist Billy Duffy and formed the band \"Death Cult\". Duffy had been in the Nosebleeds (along with Morrissey), Lonesome No More and then Theatre of Hate. In addition to Astbury and Duffy, the band also included Jamie Stewart (bass) and Raymond Taylor Smith (later known as Ray Mondo) (drums), both from the Harrow, London based post-punk band, Ritual. Death Cult made their live debut in Oslo, Norway on 25 July 1983 and also released the Death Cult EP in the same month, then toured through mainland Europe and Scotland. In September 1983, Mondo was deported to his home country of Sierra Leone and replaced by Nigel Preston, formerly of Theatre of Hate. The single \"Gods Zoo\" was released in October 1983. Another European tour, with UK dates, followed that autumn. To tone down their name's gothic connotations and gain broader appeal, the band changed its name to \"the Cult\" in January 1984 before appearing on the (UK) Channel 4 television show, The Tube.", "A world tour followed with backing from drummer Michael Lee (Page & Plant, Little Angels), bassist Kinley \"Barney\" Wolfe (Lord Tracy, Black Oak Arkansas), and keyboardist John Sinclair (Ozzy Osbourne, Uriah Heep) returning one last time, and the Gathering of the Tribes moved to the UK. Here artists such as Pearl Jam performed. The warm-up gig to the show, in a small nightclub, was dedicated to the memory of Nigel Preston, who had died a few weeks earlier at the age of 28. Following the release of the single \"The Witch\" (#9 in Australia) and the performance of a song for the 1992 Buffy the Vampire Slayer movie soundtrack entitled \"Zap City\", produced by Steve Brown and originally a B-side to \"Lil' Devil\", two volumes of remixes of \"She Sells Sanctuary\", called Sanctuary Mixes MCMXCIII, volumes one and two, and in support of Pure Cult: for Rockers, Ravers, Lovers, and Sinners, a greatest hits compilation which debuted at No.\u00a01 on the British charts and later went to number one in Portugal, Astbury and Duffy fired the \"backing band\" and recruited Craig Adams (the Mission) and Scott Garrett for performances across Europe in 1993, with some shows featuring Mike Dimkich on rhythm guitar. This tour marked the first time the band performed in Turkey, Greece, and the Slovak Republic.", "With the same line-up still in place, the band released The Cult in October 1994, produced by Bob Rock. The self-titled album is commonly referred to as the \"Black Sheep\" album by fans of the group, due to the image of a black sheep on the front cover.

The recording was edited to include the introduction with the effects, whereas earlier versions started the song more abruptly. Duffy says he found a violin bow lying around the studio and started playing the guitar with it \"like Jimmy Page\" to amuse singer Ian Astbury, hit every effects pedal he had \"to make it sound weirder\", and then played the middle section of the song. \"And we decided to start the song with that mystical sound.
