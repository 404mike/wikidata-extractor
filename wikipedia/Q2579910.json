One of William Mayne's earlier novels, it shares several features with his other books of the period.

It followed Mayne's The World Upside Down (1954) in being partly set in Vendale, also the scene of Earthfasts (1966) which is known for its TV adaptation. The emphasis on the geographical setting, as seen through the eyes of a child, is also typical of Mayne's style. It has been said that his stories grow inevitably out of their settings.Treasure Seekers and Borrowers, Marcus Crouch, Library Association, 1962, p. 120.
