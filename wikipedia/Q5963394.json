Illustrations of the fable have consequently depicted the gullible audience surrounding the frog as it takes its stance on the edge of the marsh, generally with the fox sitting off to one side. In Heinrich Steinh\u00f6wel's edition (1478) the listeners include nothing more exotic than a rat, a rabbit and a hedgehog, but Henry Walker Herrick (1869) and Ernest Griset (1874) furnish a more varied menagerie. Francis Barlow concentrates largely on an audience of domestic animals but places a squirrel and a monkey in the overhanging branches of a tree, where Samuel Croxall's illustrator and Thomas Bewick (1818) confine themselves to deer and farm beasts. The frog addresses these from the bank or, in the case of Samuel Howitt (1810, see above), from a marshy tussock. Later artists portray the frog as a huckster performing in front of a cluster of bystanders, as in the case of J. M. Cond\u00e9 (1905), Arthur Rackham (1912), John Vernon Lord (1989) and Arlene Graston (2016).
