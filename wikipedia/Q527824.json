In 1828 Lax appended An easy method of correcting the lunar distance, on account of the spheroidal figure of the earth to the Nautical Almanac. After the Board was dissolved in 1828 Lax unsuccessfully attempted to convince George Biddell Airy to aid in a campaign for its restoration. In 1834 a new edition of his nautical tables was published posthumously. Eva Germaine Rimington Taylor later concluded that all of Lax's works were \"of value to the art of navigation\"."]}, {"page": "List of people associated with Royal Holloway, University of London", "response": ["* Eva Germaine Rimington Taylor (1871\u20131966), English geographer, historian of science"]}, {"page": "E.G.R.
