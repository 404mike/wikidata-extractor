However, the field was very crowded with the likes of John Hoppner, William Owen, Thomas Lawrence and Martin Archer Shee competing for business; consequently, from 1796 to 1800, his exhibited works were chiefly portraits of gentlemen and ladies, often nameless in the catalogue and of no great importance, historically speaking.", "In 1804 he was elected an associate of the Royal Academy, together with his rival, William Owen. About the same time he moved to 8 George Street, Hanover Square, London, formerly the residence of Henry Tresham, R.A., where he lived for the rest of his life. He became a royal academician in 1808, and presented as his diploma work \"Venus and Adonis\" (exhibited the same year), perhaps the best of his creative subjects, apart from \"Expulsion from Paradise\". Meanwhile, he rose steadily in public favour, and in 1806, painted the Prince of Wales, the Marchioness of Stafford, the \"Marquess of Stafford's Family\", and Lord Thurlow. In 1807 he sent to the Royal Academy the well-known portrait of William Blake, now in the National Portrait Gallery, London, which was engraved in line by Luigi Schiavonetti, and later etched by William Bell Scott."]}, {"page": "William Owen", "response": ["William Owen may refer to:", "*William Owen (Oxford MP) (c. 1540\u20131580), MP for Oxford", "*Sir William Owen (Shrewsbury MP), MP for Shrewsbury, 1625\u20131628", "*Sir William Owen, 4th Baronet (c. 1697\u20131781), British Member of Parliament for Pembroke and Pembrokeshire", "*William Owen (Australian politician) (1815\u20131869), businessman and politician in South Australia, prominent Total Abstainer", "*William Owen (Wisconsin politician, born 1825) (1825\u20131894), member of the Wisconsin State Assembly", "*William Owen (footballer, born 1862) (1862\u2013?), Chirk F.C. and Wales international footballer", "*William Owen (footballer, born 1884) (1884\u20131945), footballer who played for Stoke", "*William Owen (footballer, born 1906) (1906\u2013?), English football goalkeeper with Birmingham, Fulham and Coventry City", "*William Owen (priest) (died 1680), Welsh Anglican priest", "*William Owen (Royal Navy officer, born 1737) (1737\u20131778), British Royal Navy officer and settler of Campobello Island, Canada", "*William Owen (painter) (1769\u20131825), British portrait painter", "*William Owen (composer) (1814\u20131893), Welsh composer of hymn tunes, including Bryn Calfaria", "*Sir William Owen (New South Wales judge)  (1834\u20131912), Justice of the Supreme Court of New South Wales", "*William Owen (trade unionist) (1844\u20131912), English trade unionist, journalist and political activist", "*William Owen (architect) (1846\u20131910), English architect", "*Sir William Owen (judge) (1899\u20131972), Justice of the High Court of Australia, grandson of Sir William Owen of the Supreme Court of New South Wales", "*William Owens (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "Brocton Hall", "response": ["In about 1815 the famous artist William Owen was commissioned to paint members of both the Chetwynd and Sparrow families.
