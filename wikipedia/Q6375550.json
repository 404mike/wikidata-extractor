The letter, which claimed that Labour policies on austerity and the breaking of ties with trades unions amounted to a \"final betrayal of the working-class people it was founded to represent\", stated that Left Unity would be launched at a \"founding conference\" in London on 30 November 2013 and would provide, as an \"alternative\" to Labour, \"a party that is socialist, environmentalist, feminist and opposed to all forms of discrimination\".

It did, however, stress that the UK would not use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against any non-nuclear weapon party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons 1968, but only if the state is not in \"material breach\" of the Treaty's obligations. The shift in language comes after the UK lifted the cap on the number of Trident nuclear warheads it can stockpile by 40% from 180 to 260 warheads \"in recognition of the evolving security environment\". The UK has also stated it would no longer declare how many deployable warheads it has in a new policy of deliberate ambiguity. The move is intended to cement the UK's status as a nuclear power and a US defence ally. Labour Party Leader Keir Starmer, although supporting nuclear deterrence, criticised the new policy and questioned why Prime Minister Boris Johnson believed that increasing the stockpile was necessary. Kate Hudson of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament warned against the start of a \"new nuclear arms race\"."]}]}}
