Many positivists looked to Shelley and Keats as examples of free thinking and in 1876 Buxton Forman published an edition of the Poetical Works of Shelley, followed in 1880 by Shelley's Prose Works. In 1878 he edited the Letters of John Keats to Fanny Brawne, and in 1883 the Poetical Works and Other Writings of John Keats which ran to five volumes. He proved a gifted textual editor although the criticism he printed included much that is trivial.Dictionary of National Biography, Harry Buxton Forman (1842\u20131917) He also contributed to the study of Shelley with an uncompleted Shelley Library that included a number of first editions and rare writings (as well as a number of his own passed-off forgeries).
