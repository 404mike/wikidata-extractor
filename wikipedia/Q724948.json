He lacks the ability to form new memories, and also cannot recall aspects of his past memories, frequently believing that he has only recently awoken from a comatose state. In educational psychology contexts, Wearing's dual retrograde-anterograde amnesia phenomenon is often referred to as \"30-second Clive\" in reference to his 30-second episodic memory capacity.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Psychology", "response": ["Psychologists generally consider biology the substrate of thought and feeling, and therefore an important area of study. Behaviorial neuroscience, also known as biological psychology, involves the application of biological principles to the study of physiological and genetic mechanisms underlying behavior in humans and other animals. The allied field of comparative psychology is the scientific study of the behavior and mental processes of non-human animals.Michela Gallagher & Randy J. Nelson, \"Volume Preface\", in Weiner (ed.), Handbook of Psychology (2003), Volume 3: Biological Psychology. A leading question in behavioral neuroscience has been whether and how mental functions are localized in the brain. From Phineas Gage to H.M. and Clive Wearing, individual people with mental deficits traceable to physical brain damage have inspired new discoveries in this area.Richard F. Thompson & Stuart M. Zola, \"Biological Psychology\", in Weiner (ed.), Handbook of Psychology (2003), Volume 1: History of Psychology. Modern behavioral neuroscience could be said to originate in the 1870s, when in France Paul Broca traced production of speech to the left frontal gyrus, thereby also demonstrating hemispheric lateralization of brain function. Soon after, Carl Wernicke identified a related area necessary for the understanding of speech."]}, {"page": "Short-term memory", "response": ["* Clive Wearing"]}, {"page": "Henry Molaison", "response": ["* Clive Wearing, whose amnesia appeared after an infection"]}, {"page": "Anterograde amnesia", "response": ["A similar case involved Clive Wearing, an accomplished musicologist who contracted a cold sore virus that attacked his brain, causing herpes simplex encephalitis. As a result, Wearing developed both anterograde and retrograde amnesia, so he has little memory of what happened before the virus struck him in 1985, and cannot learn new declarative knowledge after the virus struck him either. As a result of anterograde amnesia, Wearing repeatedly \"wakes up\" every day usually in 30-second intervals.  He has a history of repeatedly recording these moments of waking up in his journal (e.g., On Sept 2, 2013, I woke up, etc. etc.) and crossing out prior entries, as if the other moments of waking up were not real.  His episodic memory is nonfunctional (so he does not consciously recall having woken up 30 seconds prior).  Clive is often elated to see his wife, as if he has not seen her for a while.  Despite this, however, Wearing maintained his ability to play the piano and conduct choirs. This case is significant because it demonstrates declarative and procedural memory are separate. Therefore, despite anterograde amnesia preventing Wearing from learning new bits of information that can be explained in words (declarative memory), and also preventing him from storing new memories of events or episodes (also part of declarative memory), he has little trouble in retaining his musical abilities (procedural memory), though he has no conscious memory of having learned music."]}, {"page": "Muscle memory", "response": ["A recent issue in motor memory is whether or not it consolidates in a manner similar to declarative memory, a process that involves an initial fragile learning period that eventually becomes stable and less susceptible to damage over time. An example of stable motor memory consolidation in a patient with brain damage is the case of Clive Wearing. Clive has severe anterograde and retrograde amnesia owing to damage in his temporal lobes, frontal lobes, and hippocampi, which prevents him from storing any new memories and making him aware of only the present moment. However, Clive still retains access to his procedural memories, to be specific, the motor memories involved in playing the piano. This could be because motor memory is demonstrated through savings over several trials of learning, whereas declarative memory is demonstrated through recall of a single item.  This suggests that lesions in certain brain areas normally associated with declarative memory would not affect motor memory for a well-learned skill."]}, {"page": "Serial-position effect", "response": ["* Clive Wearing"]}]}}
