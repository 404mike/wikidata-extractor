It is believed to be from the 17th century and has been attributed to the Mughal painter Ustad Mansur. The bird depicted probably lived in the menagerie of the Mughal Emperor Jahangir, located in Surat, where the English traveller Peter Mundy also claimed to have seen two dodos sometime between 1628 and 1633.

In 1610, by which time most Dutch and English ships visited the island on their home voyage, Fran\u00e7ois Pyrard de Laval deplored the deterioration since his last visit in 1601, describing damage to the chapel and destruction of fruit trees by cutting down trees to pick the fruit.

The Mongolian Khan donated to Tsar Michael I four poods (65\u201370\u00a0kg) of tea in 1638. According to Jeremiah Curtin,Jeremiah Curtin, A Journey to Southern Siberia, 1909, chapter one it was possibly in 1636Basil Dymytryshyn, Russia's Conquest of Siberia: A Documentary Record, 1985, volume one, document 48 (he was an envoy that year, but the tea may have been given on a later visit to the Khan) that Vassili Starkov was sent as envoy to the Altyn Khan. As a gift to the tsar, he was given 250 pounds of tea. Starkov at first refused, seeing no use for a load of dead leaves, but the Khan insisted. Thus was tea introduced to Russia. In 1679, Russia concluded a treaty on regular tea supplies from China via camel caravan in exchange for furs. It is today considered the de facto national beverage. The first record of tea in English came from a letter written by Richard Wickham, who ran an East India Company office in Japan, writing to a merchant in Macao requesting \"the best sort of chaw\" in 1615. Peter Mundy, a traveller and merchant who came across tea in Fujian in 1637, wrote, \"chaa \u2013 only water with a kind of herb boyled in it\".Peter Mundy Merchant Adventurer, 2011, ed. R.E. Pritchard, Bodleian Libraries, Oxford Tea was sold in a coffee house in London in 1657, Samuel Pepys tasted tea in 1660, and Catherine of Braganza took the tea-drinking habit to the English court when she married Charles II in 1662. Tea, however, was not widely consumed in the British Isles until the 18th century and remained expensive until the latter part of that period. English drinkers preferred to add sugar and milk to black tea, and black tea overtook green tea in popularity in the 1720s. Tea smuggling during the 18th century led to the general public being able to afford and consume tea. The British government removed the tax on tea, thereby eliminating the smuggling trade, by 1785. In Britain and Ireland, tea was initially consumed as a luxury item on special occasions, such as religious festivals, wakes, and domestic work gatherings. The price of tea in Europe fell steadily during the 19th century, especially after Indian tea began to arrive in large quantities; by the late 19th century tea had become an everyday beverage for all levels of society. The popularity of tea played a role in historical events \u2013 the Tea Act of 1773 provoked the Boston Tea Party that escalated into the American Revolution. The need to address the issue of British trade deficit because of the trade in tea resulted in the Opium Wars. The Qing Kangxi Emperor had banned foreign products from being sold in China, decreeing in 1685 that all goods bought from China must be paid for in silver coin or bullion. Traders from other nations then sought to find another product, in this case opium, to sell to China to earn back the silver they were required to pay for tea and other commodities. The subsequent attempts by the Chinese Government to curtail the trade in opium led to war."]}, {"page": "Ferris wheel", "response": ["The travels of Peter Mundy in Europe and Asia, 1608\u20131667 describes and illustrates \"severall Sorts of Swinginge used in their Publique rejoyceings att their Feast of Biram\" on 17 May 1620 at Philippopolis in the Ottoman Balkans.

The painting of the dodo is among the rare few that were depicted in colour and is a very important source for zoologists. It is thought that the dodo was brought through Surat to Jehangir's court via Portuguese-controlled Goa and the painting of it was discovered in the Hermitage at St. Petersburg and although unsigned has been thought to be the work of Mansur or a close contemporary.Das, A.K. 1974. \"Ustad Mansur\", Lalit Kala 17:32-39.Rangarajan, M.

The same year, tea was listed as an item in the price list in a London coffee house, and the first advertisement for tea appeared in 1658.   In 1660 Samuel Pepys recorded in his diary: \"I did send for a cup of tee (a China drink) of which I never had drank before.\" It is probable that early imports were smuggled via Amsterdam or through sailors arriving on eastern boats. The marriage of King Charles II in 1662 to the Portuguese princess Catherine of Braganza brought the tea drinking habit to court. Official trade of tea began in 1664 with an import of only two pound two ounces for presentation to the king, which grew to 24 million pounds per year by 1801."]}, {"page": "History of Patna", "response": ["The British started with a factory in Patna in 1620 for the purchase and storage of calico and silk.

This perhaps encouraged by their Chinese husbands as this style of clothing was considered appropriate and not that different from Chinese style clothing. The Malaccan-Portuguese explorer, Manuel Godinho de Er\u00e9dia, even suggests that the wearing of cabayas (plural of cabaya) were brought to Southeast Asia by Arab and Egyptian merchants as early as 1618. Peter Mundy, a British writer who visited Goa in the 1630s, also stated that women in Malacca dressed similar to women in Goa. The influences of the Portuguese and Indian can be observed by the kebaya worn in Malacca, thus the possibilities that the term \"cabaya\" and the wearing of the dress was introduced to Malacca by the Portuguese or Portuguese Eurasians from India is higher than by the Arabs or Chinese."]}, {"page": "Old Bridge, Svilengrad", "response": ["The English traveler Peter Mundy crossed the bridge on 14 May 1620, by when the neighbouring town was already known as \"Mustapha Pasha Cupreesee\" (Mustapha Pasha's Bridge):"]}, {"page": "Red rail", "response": ["In the 1860s, the travel journal of the Dutch East India Company ship Gelderland (1601\u20131603) was rediscovered, which contains good sketches of several now-extinct Mauritian birds attributed to the artist Joris Laerle, including an unlabelled red rail.
