A composed central defender, Moore was admired for his reading of the game and ability to anticipate opposition movements, thereby distancing himself from the image of the hard-tackling, high-jumping defender. Moore's ability to head the ball or keep up with the pace was average at best, but the way he read the game, marshalled his team and timed his tackles marked him out as world class. Moore was sent off once over the course of his West Ham career, for a foul on Dave Wagstaffe in the final moment of a match against Manchester City in November 1961. The referee had simultaneously blown his whistle for the offence and for full-time. As red cards were not issued at that time, the dismissal did not become apparent until after the match."]}, {"page": "List of footballers in England by number of league appearances", "response": ["!scope=row data-sort-value=\"Wagstaffe, Dave\"|Dave Wagstaffe"]}, {"page": "David Wagstaffe", "response": ["#REDIRECT Dave Wagstaffe"]}, {"page": "2013 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Dave Wagstaffe, 70, footballer (Wolverhampton Wanderers, Manchester City, Blackburn Rovers)."]}, {"page": "2013\u201314 in English football", "response": ["* 6 August 2013: Dave Wagstaffe, 70, former Manchester City, Wolverhampton Wanderers, Blackburn Rovers and Blackpool winger."]}, {"page": "Deaths in August 2013", "response": ["* Dave Wagstaffe, 70, English footballer (Wolverhampton Wanderers, Manchester City, Blackburn Rovers).Dave Wagstaffe: Former Wolves winger dies aged 70"]}, {"page": "USA Final 1967", "response": ["| FW ||11||  Dave Wagstaffe"]}]}}
