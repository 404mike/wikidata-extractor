William Hague and Michael Howard campaigned on traditionalist grounds in the 2001 and 2005 general elections respectively, and 2001 also saw the election of traditionalist Iain Duncan Smith as party leader. In the current parliament, modernising forces are represented by MPs such as Neil O'Brien, who has argued that the party needs to renew its policies and image, and is said to be inspired by Macron's centrist politics. Ruth Davidson is also seen as a reforming figure, as is the Minister for Women and Equalities and Minister for Levelling up Communities, Kemi Badenoch. Many of the original 'traditionalists' remain influential, though Duncan Smith\u2019s influence in terms of Commons contributions has waned. Many 'traditionalist' backbenchers such as Christopher Chope, Peter Bone and Jacob Rees-Mogg command significant media attention for their use of fillibustering and frequent interjections, and so remain influential forces in the Commons, though they cannot be taken to represent all 'traditionalist' Conservatives."]}, {"page": "Greenhead College", "response": ["*Neil O'Brien OBE, Conservative MP."]}, {"page": "Harborough (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["Harborough () is a constituency covering the south east of Leicestershire represented in the House of Commons of the UK Parliament since 2017 by Neil O'Brien of the Conservative Party.", "| Neil O'Brien"]}, {"page": "List of Parliamentary constituencies in Leicestershire and Rutland", "response": ["|Neil O'Brien\u2020"]}, {"page": "Policy Exchange", "response": ["In May 2007, Boles was succeeded as director by Anthony Browne, a journalist and political correspondent for The Times.
