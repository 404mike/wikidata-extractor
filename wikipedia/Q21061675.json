Almost a whole new XI was signed, which included goalkeeper Tommy Spicer, full back David Robson, half backs Bill Regan, Bob Stormont, Charlie McEleny and three new forwards. Half back Ralph McElhaney and forwards E. Andrews, Roddy McLeod and Peter Turnbull, all lynchpins of the promotion team, would play a part in the upcoming season. In late August, the club was registered as a limited liability company."]}, {"page": "1903\u201304 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["Directly after the end of the dire 1902\u201303 season, the Brentford committee decided to act and appoint a first team manager.White, p. 81-82. Dick Molyneux became the first official manager in the club's history and arrived at York Road having served as manager at Everton for 12 years, with a CV boasting one Football League First Division championship and two FA Cup runners-up medals. One of the first major changes Molyneux enacted was to request that the board raise funds to pay adequate summer wages for the playing squad, which would put an end to the failures of previous seasons, when the board waited until almost before the beginning of the season to transfer players in, so as to cut down on off-season wages. Due to the majority of clubs conducting their transfer business shortly after the end of the season, the tactic meant that Brentford were always short on transfer options, when conducting business close to the beginning of the following season. The board raised \u00a3330 in donations (equivalent to \u00a3 in ) and Molyneux set about building a 16-man all-professional squad which could compete in the Southern League First Division. Of the previous season's squad, only goalkeeper Tommy Spicer, inside left Percy Turner and outside left Tosher Underwood were retained and by early June 1903, Molyneux had signed an almost entirely new XI. Brentford's colours were changed for the first time since the mid-1890s, with the old claret and blue replaced by a kit consisting of gold shirts with blue stripes, white shorts and black socks."]}, {"page": "1905\u201306 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["After two successive mid-table seasons in the Southern League First Division and some positive showings in the FA Cup, Brentford manager Dick Molyneux was able to keep the majority of his full back and half back lines together for the 1905\u201306 season.White, p. 85-87. He brought goalkeeper Tommy Spicer back from Leyton as cover for Walter Whittaker and cleared out the forward line, making six new additions, with five of the players possessing Football League experience \u2013 Walter Cookson, Fred Corbett, Willie Cross, Jack Dewhurst and Jimmy Hartley."]}, {"page": "Arthur Howes (footballer)", "response": ["Howes was born in 1876 in Leicester, and played local football for the Waverley club before signing for Second Division club Leicester Fosse in September 1896. He played 12 league matches before moving on to Reading of the Southern League, and after a trial with Football League club Lincoln City, rejoined Leicester Fosse for another three appearances. He returned to the Southern League with Brighton United in 1899, where Tommy Spicer was first-choice goalkeeper. The club folded midway through the campaign, and Howes then went to Scotland where he played for Dumbarton and then Dundee, for whom he missed only one match in the 1901\u201302 Division One season. Returning to the Southern League, Howes then spent two seasons with Brighton & Hove Albion. In the first, he and Squire Whitehurst were both used in goal as Albion gained promotion to the Southern League First Division, but he missed only one match in his second. He then joined another Southern League club, Queens Park Rangers, where he spent three seasons, made 49 Southern League appearances, and retired through injury at the end of the 1906\u201307 campaign."]}]}}
