He represented Yorkshire in the domestic arena. \nVaughan was a right-handed opening batsman, who forged a successful England partnership with Marcus Trescothick, though he often batted in the middle order for England. He was ranked one of the best batsmen in the world following the 2002/03 Ashes, in which he scored 633 runs, including three centuries.\nVaughan captained England in 51 Tests, winning 26 (a national record) and losing 11; England won all seven home Tests of the 2004 summer under Vaughan, and the pinnacle of his captaincy career came with a 2\u20131 victory in the 2005 Ashes, England's first Ashes victory in 18 years (since 1986/87). However, a recurring knee injury, his decision to move down the batting order to accommodate other opening batsmen (Andrew Strauss and Alastair Cook) and the pressures of captaincy took their toll on Vaughan's batting during the latter part of his career: in Tests, he averaged 50.95 when not captain, and 36.02 as captain.
