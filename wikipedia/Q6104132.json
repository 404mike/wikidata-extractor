After finding differing levels of commercial success with the albums Some People (1985) and Belouis Some (1987), Belouis Some decided to form a band. In 1989 he formed The Big Broadcast, and the band toured the UK playing small venues and clubs. However the group never made any recorded releases. Living Your Life was recorded after a long absence. The album, as described by Allmusic, blended contemporary pop with harder-edged techno. The album was produced for Kickstart Music Ltd, and recorded at Marcus Recording Studios in London, between February\u2013April 1993. It was mastered at Transfermation, and produced in London by Geoff Dugmore and Nigel Butler (although \"Sometimes\" and \"Total Control\" were both produced by Robin Goodfellow). Some musicians appearing on the album included Karl Hyde, Steve Barnacle, Peter Oxendale, and J.J. Belle.", "* J.J. Belle \u2013 guitars (tracks 2, 9)"]}]}}
