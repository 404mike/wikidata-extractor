The son of a Spanish father and Irish mother, Fedora was driven as much by a need to avenge the death of his parents as by patriotism or loyalty to British Intelligence. The debonair Fedora was always a tough and competent agent, and his first adventures were written in a more light-hearted manner than the latter ones.
