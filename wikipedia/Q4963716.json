He played at right back.\nBorn in Wordsley, Staffordshire, Farmer joined Birmingham City in 1950 as an amateur when he was 17. He turned professional in 1954 and made his first-team debut in 1956, but was used only as cover when Jeff Hall or Ken Green were injured or on international duty. He became a first-team regular following Hall's death in 1959, but lost his place to new signing Stan Lynn some two-and-a-half years later. He left the club in January 1962 having made 145 appearances in all competitions, of which 117 were in the First Division. He also played 17 games in European competition, appearing in the 1960 and 1961 finals of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. He went on to play 132 league games for Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic, including playing many games as team captain. He later worked as a scout for Aston Villa and AFC Bournemouth.Farmer died in hospital on 1 June 2014 at the age of 80.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1960 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final", "response": ["|RB||2|| Brian Farmer", "That reporter congratulated Lucien van Nuffel on his firmness in punishing Birmingham's dangerous play; in the last 15 minutes, some wild tackling had brought cautions for Brian Farmer and Johnny Watts.

In the second leg, watched by 60,000 spectators, Roma won by two goals to nil\u00a0\u2013 an own goal when an attempted clearance rebounded off Brian Farmer's shin, and a shot from distance by Paolo Pestrin very late in the game while Birmingham's players were all upfield attacking\u00a0\u2013 in the Stadio Olimpico to win their first and, , only trophy in European competition.", "The potentially explosive \"mixture of Blues' uncompromising tackling and the blocking and pushing of the Italians\" was highlighted when Roma's manager reacted to full-back Brian Farmer pulling Menichelli down by running onto the pitch to protest. Under a weaker referee than the Scotsman Bobby Davidson, the \"match of high tension and frayed nerves\" might have got out of control.", "|RB||2|| Brian Farmer", "In the first few minutes of the match, Roma failed to convert three clear chances. After ten minutes, manager Carniglia ran  onto the pitch to confront Birmingham captain Bloomfield, who was bending over an injured Roma player. Following an incident between Bryan Orritt and Giampaolo Menichelli, blows were exchanged among the players, and Carniglia had to be restrained by Roma officials from joining in. This time, Birmingham manager Gil Merrick followed Carniglia onto the pitch, feeling he \"had to be there to try and cool things down\". Play continued, albeit still marred by a lack of discipline. As in the first leg, Birmingham's physical approach provoked reactions from the Roma players. Menichelli was carried off injured after an incident with Brian Farmer, Lojacono raised his hands to the referee, who took no action, and the game reached the interval still goalless, which La Stampa thought a fair reflection of the half.", "|RB||2|| Brian Farmer"]}, {"page": "Pat Wright (footballer)", "response": ["Wright was born in Oldbury, Worcestershire, and turned professional with Birmingham City in 1959.
