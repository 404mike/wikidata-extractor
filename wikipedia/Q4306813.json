With his advisor Mark Jerrum, Sinclair investigated the mixing behaviour of Markov chains to construct approximation algorithms for counting problems such as the computing the permanent, with applications in diverse fields such as matching algorithms, geometric algorithms, mathematical programming, statistics, physics-inspired applications and dynamical systems. This work has been highly influential in theoretical computer science and was recognised with the G\u00f6del Prize in 1996. A refinement of these methods led to a fully polynomial time randomised approximation algorithm for computing the permanent, for which Sinclair and his co-authors received the Fulkerson Prize in 2006.Sinclair's initial forms part of the name of the GNRS conjecture on metric embeddings of minor-closed graph families.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Alistair", "response": ["* Alistair Sinclair, computer scientist"]}, {"page": "G\u00f6del Prize", "response": ["|1996 ||Mark Jerrum and Alistair Sinclair || for work on Markov chains and the approximation of the permanent of a matrix || 1989, 1989"]}, {"page": "School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh", "response": ["*Alistair Sinclair, now professor at University of California, Berkeley"]}, {"page": "Fulkerson Prize", "response": ["** Mark Jerrum, Alistair Sinclair and Eric Vigoda, for approximating the permanent.Mark Jerrum, Alistair Sinclair and Eric Vigoda, \"A polynomial-time approximation algorithm for the permanent of a matrix with nonnegative entries,\" Journal of the ACM, 51 (4): 671\u2013697, 2004."]}, {"page": "Dana Randall", "response": ["Randall was born in Queens, New York.

Formally, the conductance of a graph is defined as the minimum over all sets S of the capacity of S divided by the ergodic flow out of S.  Alistair Sinclair showed that conductance is closely tied to mixing time in ergodic reversible Markov chains.  We can also view conductance in a more probabilistic way, as the minimal probability of leaving a small set of nodes given that we started in that set to begin with.  Writing \\Phi_S for the conditional probability of leaving a set of nodes S given that we were in that set to begin with, the conductance is the minimal \\Phi_S over sets S that have a total stationary probability of at most 1/2.
