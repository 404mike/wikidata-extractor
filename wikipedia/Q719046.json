He is best known as the owner of the classical music blog, Slipped Disc, where he frequently publishes articles. Unlike other writers on music, Lebrecht rarely reviews concerts or recordings, preferring to report on the people and organizations who engage in classical music. Described by Gilbert Kaplan as \"surely the most controversial and arguably the most influential journalist covering classical music\", his writings have been praised as entertaining and revealing, while others have accused them of sensationalism and criticized the frequent errors in them.\nHe was a columnist for The Daily Telegraph from 1994 to 2002, and assistant editor of the London Evening Standard from 2002 to 2009.  On BBC Radio 3, Lebrecht presented lebrecht.live beginning in 2000, and The Lebrecht Interview from 2006 to 2016. He also writes a column for the magazine Standpoint. \nIn additions to writings on the classical music industry, Lebrecht has written 12 books on music. His novels include The Song of Names (2001) and The Game of Opposites: A Novel (2009); the former won a 2002 Whitbread Award and was adapted into a film of the same name directed by Fran\u00e7ois Girard.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "July 11", "response": ["*  1947   \u2013 Norman Lebrecht, English author and critic"]}, {"page": "Pierre Boulez", "response": ["In its obituary, The New York Times reported that \"about his private life he remained tightly guarded\". Boulez acknowledged to Joan Peyser that there was a passionate affair in 1946, described as \"intense and tormented\" and which Peyser suggested was the trigger for the \"wild, courageous works\" of that period.Peyser (1976), 33\u201334 and 113. After Boulez's death, his sister Jeanne told the biographer Christian Merlin that the affair was with the actress Maria Casar\u00e8s, but Merlin concludes that there is little evidence to support this.Merlin, 42\u201344.

This perception was strongly expressed by Derek Puffett, who argued that the decline followed Tippett's abandonment of myth\u2014seen as the key to the success of The Midsummer Marriage and King Priam\u2014and stemmed from his increasingly futile efforts to universalise his private agonies and express them musically. Despite his admiration for the early works, Puffett consigned Tippett \"to the ranks of those noble but tragic composers who have lived beyond their time\". The  critic Norman Lebrecht, writing in 2005, dismissed almost all Tippett's output, labelling him \"a composer to forget\". With the forthcoming centenary celebrations in mind, Lebrecht wrote: \"I cannot begin to assess the damage to British music that will ensue from the coming year's purblind promotion of a composer who failed so insistently to observe the rules of his craft\"."]}, {"page": "Vienna Philharmonic", "response": ["The Vienna Philharmonic was for decades accused of withholding or suppressing information about its connections in the mid-20th century to the Nazi Party.Georgina Prodhan, \"Vienna Philharmonic lifts lid on Nazi history\", Reuters, 9 March 2013 The first orchestral representative to discuss the issue was Clemens Hellsberg (also trained as a musicologist), when he wrote the orchestra's official sesquicentennial history, Demokratie der K\u00f6nige (Democracy of Kings).Clemens Hellsberg, Demokratie der K\u00f6nige \u2013 Die Geschichte der Wiener Philharmoniker, Zurich, Schweizer Verlagshaus; Wien, Kremayr & Scheriau; Mainz, Musikverlag Schott; 1992, p. 464 In it he determined that at the end of World War II 47% of orchestra members belonged to the Nazi Party or affiliates (the total number is now known to be 49%), that upon the Anschluss thirteen Jewish players were fired, that six of them were murdered (the number is now known to be seven), and \"that the VPO once gave a concert in an SS barracks.\"Norman Lebrecht, \"Beautiful music does not drown out shameful history of the past\", The Jewish Chronicle Online, 15 March 2013 But more remained to be investigated and made public, and access to relevant material in the orchestra's archives was highly restricted.
