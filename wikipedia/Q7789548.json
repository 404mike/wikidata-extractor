", "At the entrance to the bay, Capt Thomas Fellowes on the frigate Dartmouth had been detailed, with six smaller vessels (2 brigs and 4 schooners) to keep watch on the group of Ottoman corvettes and fireships on the left flank of the Ottoman line. As the Allied ships continued moving into the bay, Fellowes noticed that an Ottoman crew was preparing a fireship and sent a boat to instruct them to desist. The Ottomans fired on the boat and lighted the fireship. Fellowes sent a cutter to tow the fireship to a safe distance, but the Ottomans fired on the cutter, inflicting casualties. Fellowes opened musket fire on the fireship crew to cover his men. At this point the French flagship Sir\u00e8ne, which was just then entering the bay on the tail of the British-French line, opened fire with muskets to support Dartmouth. An Ottoman corvette then attacked Sir\u00e8ne with its guns. This chain reaction spread along the line, so that within a short time, there was general engagement.Codrington's report reproduced in James (1837) VI. 486\u201388; Dakin (1973)"]}, {"page": "Order of Saint Anna", "response": ["*Thomas Fellowes (Royal Navy officer, born 1778)"]}, {"page": "James Fellowes (physician)", "response": ["Fellowes was born in Edinburgh the third son of William Fellowes, physician-extraordinary to the prince regent - he was elder brother to the naval captain Thomas Fellowes.
