His reputation rests not as much on his ability to win and exploit field battles as it does on his expertise as a siege commander, military organizer, and innovator. Of his two great adversaries, Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma, and Ambrogio Spinola, he cautiously never allowed himself to be brought to battle with Parma and did not follow up chances to offer Spinola battle with forces in his favour on the Yssel in 1606. He was, however, dealt a defeat by the Spanish general at the battle of M\u00fclheim in October 1605.Esteban Estr\u00edgana, Alicia: Preparing the Ground: The Cession of the Netherland's Sovereignty in 1598 and the Failure of its Peace-Making Objective, 1607\u20131609.

Based on his preference for sieges and small-scale actions, historian David Trim states that it is difficult to reach a verdict on his ability as a tactician.Messenger, Charles (ed.): Reader's Guide to Military History. New York: Routledge, 2013. , p. 825. Jonathan Israel notes that on one of the rare occasions when he did have to fight a major battle in the open \u2013 the 1600 Battle of Nieuwpoort \u2013 it did end with a Dutch victory, but this outcome was highly risky, and Maurice took care to extricate his army and avoid a second such battle.Jonathan I.
