However, after a year away from the track and the birth of his first child he decided to return to racing, stating in an interview in September 2017 that the break had \"refreshed\" him. Kenny made his comeback at a round of the Revolution series at Manchester Velodrome in January 2018, setting the fastest time in sprint qualifying ahead of a field that included rival Gr\u00e9gory Baug\u00e9 and placing second in the sprint and keirin competitions. He returned to international championship competition at the 2018 UCI Track Cycling World Championships in Apeldoorn, where he was part of the silver medal-winning squad in the team sprint alongside Hindes, Jack Carlin, Ryan Owens and Joseph Truman, earning Team GB's first team sprint medal at the World Championships since 2011.
