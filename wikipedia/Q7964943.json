It launched a weekly newspaper, The Performer, and in early 1907 staged its first industrial action, which became known as the Music Hall Strike.  After some members were locked out of theatres controlled by Walter Gibbons, twenty-two London theatres were picketed, with around half of the VAF members standing on picket lines.  It raised funds by organising a performance at the Scala Theatre, its members working without pay.  It agreed to arbitration, chaired by George Askwith, and this proved a success for the union, which reached national agreements on codes of conduct, contracts and dispute resolution."]}, {"page": "Walter Gibbons (singer)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Walter Gibbons (theatre owner)"]}]}}
