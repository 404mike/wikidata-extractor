Their design for the Happy Mondays' Madchester Rave On E.P. in late 1989 became the iconic logo for the movement. Their work came to represent the movement so clearly that Factory Records owner and radio presenter Tony Wilson said, \"The second half of the Factory story is best summed up by the painterly eccentricity of Central Station.\" Speaking about Manchester in the 1980s and 1990s, Karen Jackson said, \"At some point you need an incubator and a home for all this energy, which for us became Factory Records, Dry Bar and The Ha\u00e7ienda.
