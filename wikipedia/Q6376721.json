In 1932, Gibson played one of the friends of the character D'Recamier (Pearl Argyle) in the Frederick Ashton ballet \"Magic Nights\".\n\nGibson was discovered by C. B. Cochran, who made her one of Cochran's Young Ladies. On 30 November 1933, she played Ena Hawkins in a production of Mr. Whittington at the Alhambra Theatre, Glasgow, starring alongside Jack Buchanan. A review published in The Stage in December 1933 said that Gibson \"looks pretty in the part of Ena and performs some very neat dancing\". The show went on tour and included some weeks at the London Hippodrome Theatre. This led to a film contract.\nGibson died in Paddington, London in 1974.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of British films of 1937", "response": ["|Cross My Heart||Bernard Mainwaring||Kathleen Gibson, Kenne Duncan||Drama||"]}, {"page": "List of British films of 1936", "response": ["|Born That Way||Randall Faye||Elliott Mason, Kathleen Gibson||Comedy||"]}, {"page": "List of lost films", "response": ["|rowspan=\"2\" | 1939 ||The Good Old Days || Roy William Neill || Max Miller, Hal Walters, Kathleen Gibson || On the BFI 75 Most Wanted list of lost films ||"]}, {"page": "The High Command", "response": ["*Kathleen Gibson as Belinda"]}, {"page": "Mr Stringfellow Says No", "response": ["* Kathleen Gibson as Miss Piper"]}, {"page": "Riding High (1937 film)", "response": ["Riding High is a 1937 British comedy film directed by David MacDonald and starring Claude Dampier, John Garrick, Kathleen Gibson and Helen Haye.
