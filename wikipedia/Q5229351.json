After a 0\u20130 draw at full-time, the match went into extra time, and York took the lead through a Gary Swann goal. However, Dave McKearney scored a penalty kick after Steve Tutill was adjudged to have handled the ball a minute before the end of time so the match had to be resolved in a penalty shootout. York won the shoot-out 5\u20133, with Gareth Whalley's spot kick being saved by York City's goalkeeper Dean Kiely.", "The match kicked off around 2:30p.m. on 29 May 1993 at Wembley Stadium in front of a crowd of 22,416.  Dave McKearney saw an early chance to score go wide of the York goal before Crewe goalkeeper Mark Smith held a shot from Jon McCarthy.  Steve Walters then struck a shot after interplay between Naylor and Ward, but Kiely caught the ball.  Mark Smith then caught a header from Ian Blackstone following a cross from Paul Atkin, before denying a cross-cum-shot from Barnes.   A mistake from Crewe's Neil Lennon allowed Tony Canham to shoot from the edge of the penalty area but the attempt went over the crossbar.  Swann then struck the ball over the Crewe goal before York's Wayne Hall prevented Ward from shooting.  Towards the end of the first half, Crewe's Shaun Smith's  strike went wide of the goal before Barnes struck an off-target shot.  The half ended 0\u20130.", "|RB ||2 ||Dave McKearney"]}, {"page": "McKearney", "response": ["*Dave McKearney (born 1968), English footballer"]}]}}
