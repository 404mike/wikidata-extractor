He is the William M. and Sara B. Warren Professor of the Humanities at Boston University (US), co-director of the Editorial Institute at Boston University, and was Professor of Poetry at the University of Oxford (UK) from 2004 to 2009.  In 2008, he served as president of the Association of Literary Scholars and Critics.\nHe is known as a champion of Victorian poetry; an enthusiast of Bob Dylan, whose lyrics he has analysed at book length; a trenchant reviewer of writers he considers pretentious (Marshall McLuhan, Christopher Norris, Geoffrey Hartman, Stanley Fish); and a warm reviewer of those he thinks humane or humorous (F. R. Leavis, W. K. Wimsatt, Christina Stead). Hugh Kenner praised his \"intent eloquence\", and Geoffrey Hill his \"unrivalled critical intelligence\". W. H. Auden described Ricks as \"exactly the kind of critic every poet dreams of finding\". John Carey calls him the \"greatest living critic\".\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gerard Manley Hopkins", "response": ["Christopher Ricks notes that Hopkins engaged in a number of penitential practices, \"but all of these self-inflictions were not self-inflictions to him, and they are his business \u2013 or are his understanding of what it was for him to be about his Father's business.\" Ricks takes issue with Martin's apparent lack of appreciation of the importance of the role of Hopkins's religious commitment to his writing, and cautions against assigning a priority of influence to any sexual instincts over other factors such as Hopkins's estrangement from his family. Biographer Paul Mariani finds in Hopkins poems \"an irreconcilable tension \u2013 on the one hand, the selflessness demanded by Jesuit discipline; on the other, the seeming self-indulgence of poetic creation.\""]}, {"page": "John Milton", "response": ["In 1732, the classical scholar Richard Bentley offered a corrected version of Paradise Lost.

Dismissing this view, Eliot commented in 1931, \"When I wrote a poem called The Waste Land, some of the more approving critics said that I had expressed \u2018the disillusion of a generation\u2019, which is nonsense.

For example, some lyrics can be considered a form of social commentary. Lyrics often contain political, social, and economic themes\u2014as well as aesthetic elements\u2014and so can communicate culturally significant messages. These messages can be explicit, or implied through metaphor or symbolism. Lyrics can also be analyzed with respect to the sense of unity (or lack of unity) it has with its supporting music. Analysis based on tonality and contrast are particular examples. Former Oxford Professor of Poetry Christopher Ricks famously published Dylan's Visions of Sin, an in-depth and characteristically Ricksian analysis of the lyrics of Bob Dylan; Ricks gives the caveat that to have studied the poetry of the lyrics in tandem with the music would have made for a much more complicated critical feat."]}, {"page": "Philip Larkin", "response": ["When The Whitsun Weddings was released, Alvarez continued his attacks in a review in The Observer, complaining of the \"drab circumspection\" of Larkin's \"commonplace\" subject-matter.
