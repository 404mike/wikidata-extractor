He spent further sums, but had again, for political reasons, to close in 1803. In 1807 Richard Brinsley Sheridan invited Jones to purchase a share in the Drury Lane Theatre, and to manage the house on a salary and percentage of profits: the scheme was defeated by the fire that burned down Drury Lane, 24 February 1809. Jones sold in 1808 shares in the Crow Street Theatre to John Crampton and Edward Tuite Dalton. Crampton undertook the management, but fared badly, and Jones had to resume the reins within six months. He once more withdrew from the management in 1814: a series of disturbances had culminated in a riot, in which the theatre was wrecked, and Jones laid the blame on the Tory government."]}, {"page": "Thomas Bellamy (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Thomas Ludford Bellamy (1770\u20131843), English singer"]}]}}
