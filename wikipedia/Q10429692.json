An injury crisis, including the loss of regular keeper Phil Joslin, left Torquay without a goalkeeper for the match at Plainmoor against Walsall in April 1948 and, although a midfielder, Casley played in goal and helped Torquay to a 3\u20132 victory, which in turn meant that they would not finish at the foot of the league. Casley never played for Torquay's league team again, in any position, joining Headington United (later to become Oxford United) in 1949 as their first professional player. Casley played his first game for Headington in goal, but reverted to the outfield thereafter, and scored the club's first hat-trick in the Southern League in his third game. He retired as a first-team player in 1951, but remained with the club, stepping down as chief scout only in 2002, aged 75, after 53 years' association with the club. He died on 31 May 2014 from natural causes at the age of 88.Obituary from Oxford Mail "]}, {"page": "Phil Joslin", "response": ["Phil Joslin may refer to:", "* Phil Joslin (footballer) (1916\u20131980), English footballer", "* Phil Joslin (referee) (born 1959), English football referee"]}, {"page": "Joslin (surname)", "response": ["*Phil Joslin (footballer) (1916\u20131980), English professional footballer ", "*Phil Joslin (referee) (born 1959), English association football referee"]}, {"page": "Roger Ashton (footballer)", "response": ["Ashton began his career with Wrexham following the return of The Football League at the end of World War II.

(1899\u20131962)", "response": ["Following the return of the Football League Cardiff chairman Sir Herbert Merrett established close links with Torquay United after being a regular visitor to a hotel owned by the Torquay chairman. The arrangement saw any players Cardiff thought not good enough would be offered to Torquay and Cardiff would get first refusal on any players who were thought good enough to make it in higher leagues. A number of players joined Cardiff from Torquay, the most successful being goalkeeper Phil Joslin, winger Mike Tiddy and forward Tommy Northcott. However the relationship became sour after Cardiff allowed Harry Parfitt to join the Devon based side in the understanding they could have him back when required. In 1954 Cardiff offered \u00a32500 to bring him back but Torquay demanded \u00a35000. Despite the Torquay chairman willing to let him return to Cardiff for \u00a32500 several members of the club's board decided to block the move until a higher price was agreed. Cardiff eventually paid the \u00a35000 asking price but subsequently broke off ties with Torquay."]}]}}
