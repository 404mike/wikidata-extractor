Other themes included childhood poverty (\"Ten Out of Ten\"), the then-current AIDS epidemic (\"Shocked\"), and past relationships (\"I Owe You Nothing\"). One of the album's more serious lyrical subjects was the closing ballad \"Cat Among the Pigeons\", which Watkins stated was about a friend who had struggled to cope with the early death of their father, and as a result had embarked on tempestuous and doomed relationships. Watkins also admitted that his original, more explicit lyric for \"When Will I Be Famous?\", a song that had been created for his own short-lived band the Hudsons, had been written as a conversation between two gay men: a young man desperate for fame and attention, and an older, more experienced man giving his advice.
