He is well known for his 1983 cover version of \"Always Something There to Remind Me\". He achieved further hits also writing his own songs, including \"Promises Promises\" which also made it to the higher reaches of the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 record chart.\nByrne's music partner Rob Fisher later became a part of Climie Fisher, alongside another singer, Simon Climie. Fisher died in 1999, following surgery. Both friends were formerly a part of the short-lived group Neon, with Roland Orzabal and Curt Smith of Tears for Fears fame.\nByrne is also known for an electronica recording of The Rolling Stones' track, \"Paint It Black\". He also wrote \"I Am the Cute One\" for the Olsen twins' video, \"Our First Video\".\nByrne released a solo album The Real Illusion in 2001, which featured some of the last tracks he wrote with Fisher for a proposed third Naked Eyes album. In 2005, Byrne reformed Naked Eyes and released Fumbling with the Covers (2007) an album of acoustic hits, including reworkings of the band's \"Promises, Promises\", \"When the Lights Go Out\" and \"Always Something There to Remind Me\".
