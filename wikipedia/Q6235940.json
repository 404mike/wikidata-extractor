Graham (1915, in Belfast, Ireland \u2013 29 December 1997) was an important Irish Republican Army (IRA) activist in the 1940s.\nHe was a member of a Protestant group (including George Gilmore and George Plant) who joined the IRA, and for a time in the 1940s they formed a company of the IRA in Belfast. He rose to become Belfast Commander and Northern Director of Intelligence.  \nGraham was jailed during the IRA \"Border Campaign\" of 1956-62. While in prison, he learned Irish, and started one of the first Irish language newspapers in Belfast (which is now discontinued). In the late 1970s, a book was written about him, in which the author used a code name, John Gray, instead of John Graham. \nHe was a communicant of the Church of Ireland and opposed any romanisation of that church. As a member of the select vestry of St Mary's on the Crumlin Road in Belfast, Graham resisted the placing of an image of the Virgin Mary in the church.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Graham", "response": ["*John Graham (painter) (1754\u20131817), Scottish painter and teacher of art", "*John Graham (producer) (fl. 2000s), British music producer", "*John Graham, Earl of Menteith (died 1346), Scottish soldier", "*John Graham (pirate) (fl. 1683\u20131686), English pirate active off New England", "*John Graham (British Army officer, born 1778) (1778\u20131821), founder of Grahamstown, South Africa", "*John Graham (British Army officer, born 1923) (1923\u20132012)", "*John Graham, 4th Earl of Menteith (c.1529\u2013c.1565), Scottish nobleman", "*John Graham, 6th Earl of Menteith (c.1571\u2013c.1598), Scottish nobleman", "*John Graham, 3rd Earl of Montrose (1548\u20131608), Scottish peer", "*John Graham, 4th Earl of Montrose (died 1626), Scottish peer", "*John Graham, 1st Viscount Dundee (1648\u20131689), Scottish nobleman and soldier", "*John Graham (died 1755), Scottish politician, MP for Stirlingshire 1722\u201327", "*John Graham (Irish republican) (1915\u20131997), Irish republican", "*Sir John Graham, 4th Baronet (1926\u20132019), British diplomat who was ambassador to Iraq, Iran and NATO", "*John Graham (loyalist) (born c.1945), Ulster loyalist figure", "*John Graham (diplomat) (1774\u20131820), American acting Secretary of State", "*John Graham (New Zealand politician) (1843\u20131926), New Zealand politician", "*John Graham (Manitoba politician) (1864\u20131951), politician in Manitoba, Canada", "*John Graham (Australian politician), member of the New South Wales Legislative Council", "*John Graham (Nunavut politician), politician in Nunavut, Canada", "*John Graham (clergyman) (1774\u20131844), champion of Protestantism in Ireland", "*John Graham (bishop) (1794\u20131865), bishop of Chester, 1845\u20131865", "* Alex Graham (footballer) (1889\u20131972), sometimes identified as John Graham, Scottish footballer for Arsenal, Brentford, Scotland", "* John Graham (forward) (1873\u2013?), English footballer who played as a forward for Newton Heath (Manchester United)", "* John Graham (full back) (1873\u20131925), English footballer for Millwall, Arsenal, Fulham", "* John Graham (footballer, born 1926), English footballer for Aston Villa, Wrexham, Rochdale, and Bradford City", "* John Graham Jr. (golfer) (1877\u20131915), Scottish amateur golfer", "* John Graham (rugby union) (1935\u20132017), New Zealand player, administrator, and educator", "* John Graham (long-distance runner) (born 1956), Scottish marathon runner", "* John Graham (hurdler) (born 1965), Canadian track and field athlete", "* John Graham (racing driver) (born 1966), Canadian", "* John Graham (cricketer) (born 1978), English cricketer", "* John Graham, Sr. (1873\u20131955), architect and founder of John Graham & Company", "* John Graham, Jr. (architect) (1908\u20131991)", "* John Graham (journalist) (1926\u20131974), British political journalist and editor", "* John Graham (Canadian activist) (born 1954), First Nations and AIM activist who murdered opponent", "* John Graham (policy analyst) (born 1956)", "* John Graham (economist) (born 1961), American economist and professor"]}, {"page": "1997 in Ireland", "response": ["* 29 December \u2013 John Graham, Irish Republican Army activist in the 1940s (born 1915)."]}, {"page": "1915 in Ireland", "response": ["*:*John Graham, Irish Republican Army activist in the 1940s (died 1997)."]}, {"page": "Odd Man Out", "response": ["F.L.
