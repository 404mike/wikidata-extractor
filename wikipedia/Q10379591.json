During the 2004\u201305 season, his first year at Blundell Park Jones struggled to cement his place in the first team, and was often overlooked in favour of Terrell Forbes and Justin Whittle. Jones made his debut on the opening day of the season in a 1\u20130 away defeat against Darlington. During the 2005\u201306 season Jones moved on to play a central role in the team in his second season. The club made a strong start to the season in both league and cup which included a 1\u20130 victory over Tottenham Hotspur in the League Cup second round during September 2005. It was following this match that Jones who impressed at centre half was carried off the pitch by Grimsby fans. The club failed to gain automatic promotion from League Two on the final day of the season and had to settle for the play-offs. Despite beating local rivals Lincoln City in the semi-final Grimsby lost the final 1\u20130 to Cheltenham Town. Following the club's failure to secure promotion Jones was one of several key players who departed the club in the summer of 2006 with the club agreeing a deal to sell Jones to Scottish Premier League club Hibernian."]}, {"page": "Ben Futcher", "response": ["This time he signed with promotion challenging Grimsby Town, who bolstered their squad as well with the signing of Curtis Woodhouse for the final promotion push. Futcher found it rather hard to break into the Grimsby side and often had to play second fiddle to Justin Whittle and Rob Jones. The Mariners, missed out on automatic promotion on the last day of the season, and this set them up with a Play-off semi final tie against Ben's former team, Lincoln City, who were now in the play-off's for the fourth season running. After a 1\u20130 Grimsby victory at Sincil Bank, Futcher scored in a 2\u20131 win in the leg at Blundell Park to send Grimsby into the final at Cardiff. The Mariners however failed to earn promotion, losing to Cheltenham Town in the final, thus meaning Futcher had now been on the losing team in a League Two play-off final, 3 times in the past 4 seasons."]}, {"page": "Tom Newey", "response": ["Newey signed a one-year contract with Grimsby Town in June 2005 and was one of the first new signings under Grimsby's new boss at the time, Russell Slade. He made 43 league and cup appearances for Grimsby in the 2005\u201306 season as Grimsby challenged for promotion only to lose out in the play-off final. Newey managed to keep down a regular spot at left back, despite having stiff competition from veteran Gary Croft. Slade departed Blundell Park at the end of the season, but new manager Graham Rodger convinced Newey to sign a new three-year contract with the club in the summer of 2006. Grimsby struggled in the new season, and Rodger was replaced by Alan Buckley. Newey continued to keep his place and he made a further 46 league and cup appearances in the 2006\u201307 season. In the 2007\u201308 campaign, Newey became the club's interim captain as veteran Justin Whittle spent the majority of the campaign on the substitute bench. That season, he was part of the squad that reached the final of the Football League Trophy at Wembley Stadium.

He slotted in at centre half along with Justin Whittle, as the season progressed manager Rodger was replaced by Alan Buckley but he continued to feature as a regular. On the final day of the season he had the distinction of scoring the last ever goal at Shrewsbury Town's Gay Meadow stadium.
