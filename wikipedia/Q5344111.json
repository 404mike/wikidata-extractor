He was the nephew of Lord Kingsdown.He was elected to the House of Commons as a Member of Parliament (MP) for East Kent at a by-election in May 1868, after the sitting Conservative MP Sir Brook Bridges had been ennobled as Baron FitzWalter.  Leigh Pemberton was re-elected at the general election in November 1868, and held the seat until the East Kent constituency was abolished at the 1885 general election. In 1898 he was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath.He was elected as chairman of Borden School Trust during its conception in 1875. Even when he left the Board and missed several meetings, he was immediately elected Chairman when he resumed attendance and all continued as though nothing had happened.Leigh Pemberton married Matilda Catherine Emma Noel, daughter of Reverend Francis James Noel, in 1849. She died in January 1906. Leigh Pemberton died in January 1910, aged 86.

A small booklet from the Redundant Churches Fund tells us that the population in 1865 was only 96 so a benefactor was essential. He supported the building of a new church on the site of the tumbledown mediaeval church that stood where today's nave stands. The church is a rare example of the work of Edward Welby Pugin, a noted ecclesiastical architect in Britain. Lord Kingsdown died at his seat, Torry Hill, near Sittingbourne, Kent, on 7 October 1867, aged 74. He never married, and his title died with him. Torry Hill stayed in the family, later known as the Leigh-Pembertons. Torry Hill was rebuilt to a Georgian design in the 1960s and only a Victorian gate-house remains on the estate. Lord Kingsdown's nephew Sir Edward Leigh Pemberton was the ancestor of Robin Leigh-Pemberton, who was created a life peer as Baron Kingsdown in 1993."]}, {"page": "Borden Grammar School", "response": ["In 1979, a new teaching block, the Hardy Block (named for the school's fifth headmaster, George Hardy), was opened by Commander John Bostock, DSC, RN, chairman of governors.
