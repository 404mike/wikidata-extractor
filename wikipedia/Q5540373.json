The batting was occasionally good and top of the county's averages was wicketkeeper Neil McCorkell who scored 1,539 championship runs and claimed 49 victims. Neville Rogers and Johnny Arnold played some good innings to both comfortably exceed 1,000 runs. Eagar and Gerry Hill both reached 1,000 with low averages and the all-rounder Jim Bailey, who took 53 wickets, fell just short of 1,000 runs. Playfair considered \"the steady and loyal George Heath\" to be the best of the bowlers who included Bailey, Hill, Victor Ransom, Lofty Herman and the injury-plagued Charles Knott. Other players included Gilbert Dawson, Thomas Dean, Arthur Holt, Alan Shirreff and future stalwart Leo Harrison.Playfair, pp. 110\u2013111."]}, {"page": "George Heath", "response": ["George Heath may refer to:", "* George Heath (priest) (1745\u20131822), Headmaster of Eton School", "* George Heath (racing driver) (1862\u20131943), American racing driver", "* George Heath (cricketer) (1913\u20131994), English cricketer", "* George Heath (cinematographer), Australian cinematographer"]}]}}
