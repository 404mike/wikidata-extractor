Born in Ireland, she migrated to England at the age of four, becoming a well-known British writer and contributor to nineteenth-century thought on a range of subjects including early feminism, art history (particularly sacred art), travel, Shakespeare, poets, and German culture.  Jameson was connected to some of the most prominent names of the period including Fanny Kemble, Elizabeth Barrett-Browning and Robert Browning, Harriet Martineau, Ottilie von Goethe (the daughter-in-law of Goethe), Lady Byron, Charles and Elizabeth Eastlake, and Barbara Leigh Smith Bodichon.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "May 17", "response": ["*1794 \u2013 Anna Brownell Jameson, Irish-English author (d. 1860)"]}, {"page": "1860", "response": ["* March 17 \u2013 Anna Brownell Jameson, British author (b. 1794)"]}, {"page": "1794", "response": ["* May 17 \u2013 Anna Brownell Jameson, British writer (d. 1860)"]}, {"page": "List of Canadian writers", "response": ["| scope=\"row\" | Anna Brownell Jameson"]}, {"page": "Sandro Botticelli", "response": ["The first nineteenth-century art historian to be enthusiastic about Botticelli's Sistine frescoes was Alexis-Fran\u00e7ois Rio; Anna Brownell Jameson and Charles Eastlake were alerted to Botticelli as well, and works by his hand began to appear in German collections.

Hypatia was a Greek mathematician, astronomer, and philosopher, who was murdered by a Christian mob after being accused of exacerbating a conflict between two prominent figures in Alexandria, the governor, Orestes, and the bishop, Cyril. The idea that Catherine's life was either based on or became confused with the life of the pagan Hypatia has become a popular theory among modern scholars since. However, while Christine Walsh accepts the many parallels between Catherine and Hypatia, she does not believe there is any evidence for or against the idea that Catherine was created based on Hypatia.

Also, she dreamed of being on a high hill, which was surrounded by water, and from which she beheld many canoes full of Indians, coming to her and paying her homage; after this, she felt as if she was being carried up into the heavens, and as she looked down on the earth, she perceived it was on fire and said to herself, \"All my relations will be burned!\", but a voice answered and said, \"No, they will not be destroyed, they will be saved!\", and she knew it was a spirit, because the voice was not human. She fasted for ten days, during which time her grandmother brought her at intervals some water. When satisfied that she had obtained a guardian spirit in the white stranger who haunted her dreams, she returned to her father's lodge\". Jameson also noted that Ozhaguscodaywayquay was considered to be a strong woman as \"in her youth she hunted and was accounted the surest eye and fleetest foot among the women of her tribe\", which was an accomplishment for a woman as for the Ojibwe, hunting was usually a masculine form of activity."]}, {"page": "North American fur trade", "response": ["In 1793 Oshahgushkodanaqua, an Ojibwe woman from the far western end of Lake Superior, married  John Johnston, a British fur trader based in Sault Ste.
