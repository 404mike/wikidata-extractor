An obituary in The Telegraph characterised her as \"the blue-eyed English rose with the china-white skin and cupid lips who epitomised the sensuality of the swinging sixties\", who later \"proved that she was a real actor of extraordinary emotional range\".York's early films included The Greengage Summer (1961) and Freud (1962). She received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for They Shoot Horses, Don't They? She also won the 1972 Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actress for Images.

Leone was initially dissatisfied with his performance in that he played his character as a serious, Zapata-like figure. As a result, tension grew between Steiger and Leone, including one incident that ended with Steiger walking off during the filming of the scene where Juan's stagecoach is destroyed. After the film's completion, Leone and Steiger were content with the final result, and Steiger praised Leone for his skills as a director. Steiger auditioned for the role of Michael Corleone in Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather (1972), a film adaptation of Italian American author Mario Puzo's 1969 novel of the same name, but Puzo felt that Steiger was too old for the part and rejected him."]}, {"page": "Michelle Pfeiffer", "response": ["Pfeiffer made her acting debut in 1978, in a one-episode appearance of Fantasy Island.
