He became a fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) on 13 May 1920 and finally retired in 1924.

In March 1927, LennardJones was appointed Professor of Theoretical physics, a chair being created for him, with Dent becoming his research assistant in theoretical physics.

Arthur Tyndall noted his preference for the setup of the new edition and wrote that \"if there are any mistakes or omissions in it, the reviewer was too immersed in the atmosphere of the book to notice them\". Tyndall recommended the book for teachers who are looking to develop students' interest in the historical background of optics and electricity, as he believes a lot of the content can be directly incorporated into lectures and that students can be advised to read parts of the book in their undergraduate studies. In a second 1951 review, William McCrea stated that Whittaker had succeeded, \"possibly more than any other historian of science\", in imparting \"a comprehensive and authentic impression of that wherein the great pioneers were truly great\", which allowing the reader to \"see their work, with its lack of precedence, against the background of strangely assorted experimental data and of contemporary conflicting general physical concepts\" and \"to see how they yet contributed each his share to what we are bound to recognize as permanent progress\". McCrea praised the book by saying \"[n]o better factual account exists to show how hardly won this progress has been.\" In a second review, published in 1952, McCrea stated \"[o]ut of the riches of his mathematical and historical scholarship, Sir Edmund Whittaker has given us a very great book.\" In his review, Julius Miller claimed that the book was beyond review, saying it sufficed to note that \"it is the work of a foremost scholar of this century and the last\u2014a physicist, philosopher, mathematician.\" Miller noted that while it is primarily a history book, it is also \"philosophy, physics, and mathematics of the first temper\" and that it gives an \"elegant penetrating examination of The Classical Theories\". He also noted that although it is \"heavy reading\", the work is \"delightfully clear\" and that the \"documentation is astonishing\"."]}, {"page": "Bibliography of E. T. Whittaker", "response": ["Whittaker published an extended and revised edition of his Theories of Aether in two volumes, with volume one in 1951 and the second in 1953. Notwithstanding a notorious controversy on Whitaker's views on the history of special relativity, covered in volume two of the second edition, the books are considered authoritative references on the history of classical electromagnetism as well as classic books in the history of physics. The first volume, subtitled the classical theories, serves as a revised and updated edition of the original 1910 book. p. 294 Among others, Arthur Mannering Tyndall, Carl Eckart, Victor Lenzen, William Hunter McCrea, Julius Sumner Miller, John Lighton Synge, and Stephen Toulmin reviewed the book. The second volume extended this work covering the years 1900 to 1926, including the early development of special relativity, general relativity, old quantum theory, and quantum mechanics. Among others, Max Born, Freeman Dyson, Rolf Hagedorn, and Percy Williams Bridgman reviewed the book. Whittaker's role in the relativity priority dispute centres on chapter two of the second volume, where he claims that Lorentz and Poincare had developed the theory of relativity before Einstein. Due to the controversy this sparked, the second volume is cited far less than the first volume and first edition, except in connection with the priority dispute."]}]}}
