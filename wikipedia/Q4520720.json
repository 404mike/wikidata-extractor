He was named Walter after his great-great-grandfather, who gained a fortune for a plow he had invented.  However, to his friends and family he was always called \"Lynnwood\" or Lynn.  His father was Arlington I. Farnam, a farmer and inventor who also was an amateur musician of no particular talent.  His mother, Bertha Curtis n\u00e9e Wood, was a highly skilled musician with a noted ability for memorization.  He was raised on a farm in Dunham, Quebec, where both his parents had deep family ties, with the obligatory farm chores.  His first musical instructor was his mother, and then from two teachers at Dunham Ladies College.  Farnam gave credit to one of these teachers, George W. Cornish, as giving him the foundation for technical ability for which he became famous.  The first verifiable public performance took place at the age of ten.  He began giving piano lessons of his own by the age of eleven.  In 1900 he was awarded the Montreal Scholarship, enabling him to attend the Royal College of Music for three years studying under James Higgs, W. S. Hoyte, F. A. Sewell, Herbert Sharpe and Franklin Taylor.  He had spent three months in intense preparation for the scholarship exam, but the day of the examination and performance left him nervous.  His father relieved his nerves with encouragement and by massaging Lynnwood's fingers, for which Lynnwood expressed gratitude.  Because he excelled in his studies he earned an addition year of tuition at the Royal College."]}]}}
