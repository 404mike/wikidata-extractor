Frustrated by the lack of progress on voting rights, in 1907, she became an active member of the more radical WSPU. On 18 November 1910, Anderson joined her mother, Emmeline Pankhurst, Alfred Caldecott, Hertha Ayrton, Mrs Elmy, Hilda Brackenbury, Princess Sophia Duleep Singh, and 300 women to petition Prime Minister Asquith for voting rights. The protest became known as Black Friday, due to the violence and sexual assault the protesters faced from the police and male bystanders. More than one hundred women were arrested, including Anderson, but all were released without charge. In 1912, she was imprisoned in Holloway, briefly, for her suffragette activities which included breaking a window by throwing a brick. In 1914, Anderson joined Agnes Harben and the new group of women and men: H. J. Gillespie, Gerald Gould, Bessie Lansbury and George Lansbury, Mary Neal, Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence, Julia Scurr and John Scurr, Evelyn Sharp, and Edith Ayrton, Louise Eates and Lena Ashwell  in starting the United Suffragists which grew to have branches in London, Liverpool, Edinburgh and Glasgow."]}, {"page": "List of members of London County Council 1919\u20131937", "response": ["| Julia Scurr (resigned 17 February 1926)"]}, {"page": "Nellie Cressall", "response": ["She stated later,I had been thinking for some time of the unequal rights of men and women. I could not agree that men should be the sole parent, that a mother could not even say whether her child should be vaccinated or not \u2013 or that women should receive half pay and many other things as well. I thought that here is something I can dedicate myself to help in some way to put things right.She joined Sylvia Pankhurst, Keir Hardie, Julia Scurr, Millie Lansbury and George Lansbury in establishing the East London Federation of Suffragettes (ELF) \u2013 an organisation that combined socialism with a demand for women's suffrage. The group also began production of a weekly paper for working-class women called The Women's Dreadnought.", "It was around this time that Nellie could frequently be heard speaking at meetings at the East India Dock gates next to the entrance to Blackwall Tunnel. In November 1919 Nellie and George were elected to Poplar Council (the Labour Party had won 39 of the 42 council seats). In 1921 she was one of Poplar councillors sent to prison for refusing to follow a court order demanding they implement what they regarded as an unfair form of taxation. She was sent to Holloway prison on 1 September 1921, along with Susan Lawrence, Julia Scurr, Minnie Lansbury and Jennie Mackay. Nellie was six months pregnant at the time, with her future son Samuel, but nevertheless was left for 24 hours alone in her cell.  Among those who had to make special arrangements were George and Nellie Cressall, both of whom had been committed to prison. The Cressalls had five sons between the ages of seven and seventeen, and Nellie, who was thirty-eight, was expecting her sixth. They arranged that the youngest should be cared for by their grandmother, while two of the boys joined the group of children taken to Kent.Nellie Cressall \u2026 had a particularly gruelling experience. In view of her condition she was immediately put into a cell in the hospital wing. But she was then, apparently, forgotten about for twenty-four hours. When others were let out for exercise, she was ignored and remained locked up. She heard the persistent sound of screaming, and while she was there a woman in a nearby cell committed suicide.She later said:Think of it, you mothers, young girls taken from a life of freedom and locked up in cells with doors as thick as a pawnbroker\u2019s safe.Imprisoning a heavily-pregnant councillor was a serious mistake on the behalf of the government; public support for Nellie grew and her incarceration became an embarrassment. Just over two weeks after her imprisonment, she was released on health grounds. Nellie, however, refused to go unless her fellow councillors were also released \u2013 she was also very suspicious of a document that the authorities asked her to sign, in case it in some way caused her colleagues further problems. In the end, it was LCC Labour group leader, Harry Gosling, who convinced her to leave, on 21 September 1921, close to three weeks after she had been locked up. The Poplar Rates Rebellion was successful with the government and the London County Council backing down. The rest of the imprisoned councillors were released on 12 October 1921."]}, {"page": "United Suffragists", "response": ["Founder members of the United Suffragists included Louisa Garrett Anderson, H.

Despite her long support working all over the country, four imprisonments and hunger strike, Phillips had to advertise her own services in 'situations wanted' in The Suffragette.  She moved to London's East End, living in Canning Town and immediately went to work with Nora Smyth for Sylvia Pankhurst's rival East London Federation of Suffragettes, with Pankhurst, Keir Hardie, Julia Scurr, Millie Lansbury, Eveline Haverfield, Nellie Cressall and George Lansbury. Phillips continued to promote socialism and wrote for The Women's Dreadnought weekly for working women. She became the full time paid organiser for the federation working with May Billinghurst. In 1916 she was working for the New Constitutional Society for Women's Suffrage who did not support (or decry) militancy."]}, {"page": "Scurr", "response": ["* Julia Scurr (1871\u20131927), British politician."]}, {"page": "Daisy Parsons", "response": ["Parsons was inspired by Minnie Baldock in Canning Town and so she joined Sylvia Pankhurst's East London Federation of Suffragettes and became the secretary of the branch in South West Ham. In 1914 Sylvia Pankhurst went on hunger strike and refused to stop until the Prime minister received women so that they could present their case for the vote. Asquith agreed and Parsons was able to tell him of her problems as she was one of the six women chosen including Jessie Payne, led by Mrs Julia Scurr. She told Asquith that she gave birth to children but she had little say in deciding \"what is good for them.\" During world war one the East London Federation of Suffragettes opened a baby clinic and Parsons was the manager.

They described to Asquith their experiences of the life of women in East London, and what the vote meant to them.  Jessie was the last to speak. In support of votes for all, she cited the injustice of women being denied a say in law making, despite being pivotal in the home, and railed against the forthcoming Mental Deficiency Bill which, she said, would be passed by people who have had no dealings in caring for the mentally ill and would not understand their needs: The Elementary Education (defective and epileptic children) Bill would allow local education authorities to take from their parents without consent any child over seven whom they deemed to be \u2018mentally defective\u2019 and to send them to institutions. Mrs Payne explained to Asquith that when their young daughter had become unmanageable she and her husband had 'felt compelled to take her to the workhouse' but when she visited and questioned the standard of care, she was told by a doctor that a mother had no voice in the matter, only the father could affect change."]}, {"page": "Mile End (London County Council constituency)", "response": ["| Julia Scurr"]}, {"page": "Agnes Harben", "response": ["On 13 February 1914, Harben became one of the  founder committee members of the United Suffragists which brought together militant and non-militant women and included men, like her husband, along with Louisa Garrett Anderson, H.
