FitzGeorge was the only daughter and child of Rear Admiral Sir Adolphus FitzGeorge and his wife Sophia Jane Holden FitzGeorge.\nBorn in Athens while her father was serving with the Mediterranean Fleet, FitzGeorge was a goddaughter of Queen Olga of Greece and her great aunt Mary Adelaide, Duchess of Teck. During her childhood, FitzGeorge's parents allowed her to perform in plays for charitable events despite the misgivings of her great-grandmother Augusta, Duchess of Cambridge, and her grandfather, the Duke of Cambridge.\nFitzGeorge was married first to Charles Edward Archibald Watkin Hamilton (later Sir Archibald Hamilton, 5th Baronet) in 1897. FitzGeorge was known for her lavish lifestyle, and she continued her extravagant behavior throughout the course of this marriage, which increased her husband's debts and caused marital strife when Hamilton attempted to limit her expenditures. In order to achieve financial independence, FitzGeorge established a manicure and beauty salon on New Bond Street in London despite its annoyance to both the Hamilton family and the British royal family. FitzGeorge's first marriage, which ended in a highly-publicized divorce in 1902, produced two children: a son, George Edward Archibald Augustus FitzGeorge Hamilton, in 1898 and an unnamed daughter who died shortly after her birth. FitzGeorge's son died in 1918 while serving with the Grenadier Guards in France during World War I.\nFitzGeorge married lawyer Robert Charlton Lane in 1905, and the couple had a daughter, Mary Alice Olga Sofia Jane Lane Hohler Scrivener, in 1919. In 1908 FitzGeorge made headlines for her alleged affair with Arthur Clark Kennedy and was named in his divorce proceedings with his second wife. FitzGeorge died of an embolism at age 51 in Rouen, France, in 1928 and was interred at her Glebe Manor estate in Warblington, Hampshire. In her will, she bequeathed \u00a31,000 to Winchester College for the establishment of the George FitzGeorge Hamilton Fund to assist in the education of the children of Wykehamists who died in World War I. FitzGeorge's daughter Jane, who later married British ambassador Ronald Stratford Scrivener, died in 2014.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
