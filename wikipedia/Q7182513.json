Meades also noticed that White had \"tempered\" the sauces served with meat and fish, referring to their previous versions as \"assault courses\". He praised a new roasted salmon and tapenade dish, calling it \"of breathtaking quality\", and the work of pastry chef Roger Pizey. Meades later listed The Restaurant as the second best in the country at the end of 1994, placed only behind Phil Vickery, having recently taken over from Gary Rhodes, at the Castle Hotel, Taunton. He gave both restaurants an equal nine stars out of ten. When celebrity chef Keith Floyd listed his five favourite restaurants for The Guardian in September 1994, he included The Restaurant in third place, saying \"The food is exquisite. He's a difficult bastard, but I like him. He came through le Gavroche, through Albert Roux, and he's developed on from there. Along with Albert, I think he's one of the finest cooks in the country.
