After the murder, Bree receives a blackmail letter from an unknown person similar to the one Mary Alice had received in the first season.

This version was originally a thief and conman employed by a cabal called the Men of Tears in the 1800s. Swift acquired the Black Diamond for their plot to summon and bind Eclipso to their will, but they betrayed Swift by attempting to use him as a sacrifice. Unbeknownst to the Men of Tears however, the Black Diamond Swift gave them was a forgery and Eclipso was already bound to the real version, which led to the ritual being botched and a doorway to the Shadowlands being opened. The resulting energy that emerged entered Swift and granted him his powers. By the end of the 20th century, Swift aligned himself with the Injustice Society of America (ISA) as part of a \"temporary arrangement\" despite viewing its leader Icicle as insane. In the pilot episode, Swift joined the ISA in attacking the Justice Society of America (JSA), during which he pretended to fight and attempted to save Doctor Mid-Nite, but accidentally lost him in the Shadowlands. In the episode \"Wildcat\", Icicle and Dragon King discuss how Swift had betrayed the ISA in an unknown fashion. In the episode \"Stars and S.T.R.I.P.E.\" Pt. 2, an unimpressed Swift watches a news report discussing the aftermath of his former group's failed attack on the Midwestern United States from the abandoned ISA hideout. In season two, Swift arrives in Blue Valley to find the Black Diamond. After being confronted by Stargirl's JSA, Swift reveals his reasons for being with the ISA, denies killing Mid-Nite, and demands to be left alone, claiming he will leave peacefully once he gets what he wants. While a battle ensues, Swift subdues the heroes before escaping. In a later confrontation, he reveals to Stargirl that Eclipso murdered Mid-Nite's daughter Rebecca. After receiving help from Stargirl's mother, Barbara Whitmore, Swift intervenes during a fight between the JSA and Injustice Unlimited in an attempt to destroy the Black Diamond. However, Stargirl inadvertently breaks it and frees Eclipso, who forces Swift to flee. Eventually, Swift resurfaces to aid Stargirl in reconstructing the Black Diamond, claiming it can be used to trap Eclipso once more. He later reveals his deception, using the diamond to strengthen his powers and summon Eclipso, who sends Stargirl to the Shadowlands. Subsequently, Swift seeks a darkened theater to recuperate. However, Barbara and her husband Pat Dugan find and convince him to open a portal to the Shadowlands so that Stargirl, Mid-Nite, and Cindy Burman can escape. The effort seemingly kills Swift, who dissipates in a cloud of dark energy, but he later returns to help the JSA defeat Eclipso."]}, {"page": "The Kraken Wakes", "response": ["| Michael Watson || Robert Beatty || Jonathan Cake || Paul Higgins"]}, {"page": "Theatre World Award", "response": ["*Jonathan Cake \u2013  Medea"]}, {"page": "Julianne Nicholson", "response": ["In 2004, she married British actor Jonathan Cake in Italy; they met playing a couple on an unaired HBO pilot called Marriage.
