Dinanga's loan agreement with Hartlepool was subsequently cut short in December 2018. He signed an 18-month contract to rejoin AFC Telford United, this time on a permanent basis, on 4 January 2019. Telford manager Gavin Cowan stated the club had secured his signing ahead of a number of other teams. The agreement was made just in time to ensure he was eligible to play the following day, making his second debut for the club in a 2\u20131 victory against Spennymoor Town. He scored twice in 15 appearances, of which eight were as a substitute, during the remainder of the 2018\u201319 season. Dinanga scored five goals during the first half of the 2019\u201320 season, including scoring a second-half hat-trick in a 3\u20132 comeback victory away at Darlington on 30 November 2019. He ended the season by scoring seven goals in his last eight games, stating he had benefited from the service from wingers Ryan Barnett and Brendon Daniels. Dinanga scored twelve goals in 31 appearances during the season."]}, {"page": "2021\u201322 Shrewsbury Town F.C. season", "response": ["| 30 June 2021 || AM ||  || Ryan Barnett ||  Solihull Moors || Released || "]}]}}
