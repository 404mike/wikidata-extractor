He formed the band Instigators with his school friend Simon Mooney (guitar). After Simon Bridgewater (vocals) and Simon Elsey (bass) joined they made some demo recordings at Lion Studios in Leeds. These collected demos became the first release on Hammy's then cassette only label, Peaceville Tapes in 1983.\nAs the tape label became successful it became obvious that a move into vinyl releasing was the next logical step and following his departure from the Instigators in 1985 he worked on making the label a profession, inaugurating the record label proper on 27 December 1986.\nIn 1987 he released a four-track 7\" flexi-disc single, entitled \"Will Evil Win?\", followed by hard vinyl 7\" singles by Deviated Instinct and Atavistic.\nIn 1988 he released the first album on the label, a compilation called A Vile Peace featuring Chumbawamba, Sore Throat (whom he joined as drummer from 1988-1990), Axegrinder, Electro Hippies, Doom, Deviated Instinct, Hellbastard, and many more. Expanding the label into a full-time operation, he continued to release albums by Electro Hippies, Deviated Instinct, and Doom. He then ventured into metal for the first time with Toranaga. As the label grew, he signed more professional acts like Autopsy, Paradise Lost, My Dying Bride, Anathema, Darkthrone, At the Gates, Vital Remains, and many others throughout the early 1990s.Coincidentally, he also ran Vile Music, which from 1988 onwards was a music publishing company and held the rights to the releases of every band signed to Peaceville. Eventually, in 1997, the publishing was spun out of the label as a separate entity and signed to Zomba for worldwide administration.\nHammy continued to run both Peaceville Records and Vile Music Publishing until 2006, when he sold his holding in the record label to concentrate solely on the publishing company.\nIn December 2016, to coincide with the 30th anniversary of the founding of the record label proper, he released his memoirs, entitled Peaceville Life. This was released through his 'Hell Segundo' imprint which was launched at the same time. In August 2019 it was reissued by UK publishing house Cult Never Dies As of March 2021, Paul was diagnosed with hereditary dilated cardiomyopathy.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Joel McIver", "response": ["*A Peaceville Life by Paul \"Hammy\" Halmshaw (2016)"]}, {"page": "Sore Throat (grindcore band)", "response": ["The band's first release was the Aural Butchery demo in 1987, and like other early releases such as the 42 track Death to Capitalist Hardcore EP (1988) and the Noise Annoys demo (1988) consisted largely of raw, sub-one minute blast of grindcore noise; Death to Capitalist Hardcore was later ranked number 14 in Terrorizer Magazine's list of essential European grindcore albums.Hoare, James (2009). \"Essential Albums|Europe\", Terrorizer Magazine 180, p. 55. A line-up change resulted in Paul \"Hammy\" Halmshaw taking over on drums and after signing to the Meantime label in 1988, Sore Throat released their debut album, Unhindered by Talent, which continued the trend, albeit with a number of more traditional, Discharge-style numbers. Their second album, Disgrace to the Corpse of Sid on Earache, showed even more diversity, incorporating distortion, blast beats, screams and grunts, and sound samples. It featured 101 tracks in total. However, whilst the A side of the album consisted of the band's patented noisecore, the B side contained more doom-inspired crust punk, along the lines of Amebix.

The label was founded by Paul \"Hammy\" Halmshaw (of the bands Instigators and Civilised Society) in Dewsbury, England in 1987, who was also a one-time drummer of Sore Throat. Originally a tape label releasing anarcho punk, the releases moved towards metal through crust punk and similar forms of metal-influenced English hardcore punk.

The band's drummer, Paul \"Hammy\" Halmshaw, founded Peaceville Records in 1983, which began releasing material by crust, hardcore and anarcho bands, before soon beginning to put out metal releases. In the 1990s, it released material for the pioneering gothic metal and death doom bands Paradise Lost, My Dying Bride and Anathema. Anti System from Bradford were also a notable band roughly contemporary to Sore Throat."]}]}}
