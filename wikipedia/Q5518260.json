Her most remarkable affair, about which she later wrote a book, was \"a fleeting, and distinctly odd\" relationship with Hakim Jamal, an American Black radical who asserted he was God and was a cousin of Malcolm X.

The robbery rattles many important underworld figures who had used the bank, including Lew Vogel, who kept a ledger of police payoffs inside.  He notifies a furious Michael X in Trinidad, who correctly suspects Gale Benson\u2014 the lover of his associate Hakim Jamal\u2014of spying for MI5, and subsequently murders her. Vogel decides that Dave\u2019s presence outside that particular bank was not a coincidence, and has him kidnapped and tortured for information by sand blasting an ankle and one of his legs. Dave gives in, and Lew has Gerald Pyke and Nick Burton \u2014 two corrupt policemen working on his payroll, kidnap Eddie at Terry's garage. Meanwhile, Terry discovers explicit photographs of important government officials among their loot and uses them to secure passports and new identities for the gang.", "It is later revealed Vogel's ledger eventually causes Scotland Yard to undergo a major corruption purge in the police force.
