Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers (1988) picks the story up ten years after the events of Halloween II. Michael (George P. Wilbur) is revealed to have been in a comatose state since the explosion. Michael wakes from his coma when he learns Laurie Strode has died in a car accident but has a nine-year-old daughter, Jamie Lloyd (Danielle Harris). Returning to Haddonfield, he causes a citywide blackout and massacres the town's police force before being shot by the state police and falling down a mine shaft. Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers (1989) begins immediately after the fourth film ends, with Michael Myers (Donald L. Shanks) escaping the mine shaft and being nursed back to health by a local hermit. The next year, Michael kills the hermit and returns to Haddonfield to find Jamie (Harris) again, chasing her through his childhood home in a trap set up by Loomis (Pleasence). Michael is eventually subdued by Loomis and taken to the local police station, but a mysterious \"Man in Black\" attacks the police station, kills the officers, and frees him. Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers (1995) takes place six years after the events of The Revenge of Michael Myers; both Jamie (J. C. Brandy) and Michael (Wilbur) have disappeared from Haddonfield. Jamie has been kidnapped and impregnated by the Cult of Thorn, led by Dr. Terence Wynn (Mitchell Ryan), Loomis' friend and colleague from Smith's Grove. Wynn is revealed to have been manipulating Michael all along and was his mysterious savior in Halloween 5. Michael attacks Jamie, but not before she hides her infant, who is discovered and taken in by Tommy Doyle (Paul Rudd). While trying to protect the baby from Michael and Wynn, Tommy learns that the cult may be the cause of Michael's obsession with killing his entire family, in addition to his seemingly supernatural abilities. Michael ultimately turns against the cult and is finally subdued by Tommy, who injects him with large quantities of tranquilizers inside the Smith's Grove Sanitarium. The film ends with Michael's mask lying on the floor of the lab room and Loomis screaming in the background, leaving the fate of both men unknown."]}, {"page": "Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers", "response": ["* J.

Brandy had conversations with Daniel Farrands about John Carpenter and The Fog and recalled \"knowing I was stepping into a part that people were so attached to with another actor, and that\u2019s not easy\". Brandy went into hypothermia during the filming of her character's escape scene, as there was a snow storm that caused shooting to cease multiple times. Reshoots for the film took place in Los Angeles, California in the summer of 1995. Brandy described the cast as being \"pretty bummed about the reshoots\" and believed it was possible for someone to easily recognize which scenes were added later, citing their lack of lighting and depth. The reshoots altered Jamie's death from being killed with a silencer pistol in a hospital to her being impaled in a barn. Brandy preferred the original because \"it was unnatural to have that line they gave me in the barn and it felt really forced, with blades going through my stomach\", though she admitted to understanding the altered scene's appeal for its gore and special effects.
