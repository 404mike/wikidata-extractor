He was educated at the grammar school in Bala where his contemporaries included Robert Thomas Jenkins.  He then studied classics followed by theology at Jesus College, Oxford.  He was then married in 1903 and was ordained as a minister in the Presbyterian Church of Wales in 1905, serving first in Aberdyfi before moving to Liverpool in 1906 and Cardiff in 1913.  Whilst in Cardiff, he was heavily involved in fundraising for the church, and eventually resigned in 1938 to become the full-time secretary of the Sustentation Fund for South Wales, later of the Fund for the whole denomination, in which capacity he ensured that the church and its ministers were on a firmer financial basis than before. He also campaigned at a national level on behalf of the people of south Wales, leading a group to London in 1932 to see the Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin about the poverty of the valleys.  He was awarded an honorary doctorate of divinity by the University of Wales in 1954.

An electronic version of a publication by the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion", "Robert Thomas Jenkins noted that Willis-Bund wrote extensively about the history of the church in Wales but that some of his views were not generally held to be those of other academics writing in the field. Jenkins commented on his editing of the Black Book of St. Davids in 1902 for the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion: '...the work was but indifferently done', and mentioned another of Willis-Bund's books, The Celtic Church of Wales, 1897, which propounded a theory of his own and was, Jenkins states, judged by Louis Gougaud to be \"dubious and prejudiced,\" and by Sir J. E. Lloyd to be \"very haphazard\".Biograph on Louis Gougaud Additionally, Gougaud observed that Willis-Bund's views (along with those of Rice Rees), were 'widely different' from 'those adopted by present-day historians on the relation of ancient Celtic Christianity to the See of Peter',The Month, vol. 169, p. 158 and Lloyd further stated that the work was a 'book of original, but highly disputable, views.'J. E.

The book was considered a 'detailed' 'study of the institutions of ancient Welsh Christianity'.Church Quarterly Review, vol. 45, 1898, p. 151 Willis-Bund was referred to by the Welsh politician Clement Edwards in a 1914 House of Commons debate on the Established Church in Wales as 'a great authority... one of the greatest authorities on the history of the old Welsh Church'. Sir Arthur Griffith-Boscawen, however, in response, observed that Willis-Bund 'never got any support for the theory' in question, regarding the origins of tithing.https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/1914-04-20/debates/40d7a68c-a73f-46ee-aa9b-0392ffeee796/EstablishedChurch(Wales)Bill"]}]}}
