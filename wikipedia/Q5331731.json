In his Peak Scenery (1824), Ebenezer Rhodes charges that by the start of the 19th century many former gravestones of plague victims had been pulled up to floor houses and barns and that ploughing was allowed to encroach on the Riley Graves (pp.\u00a034\u20135); that the lime trees planted on either side of Mrs Mompesson's grave had been cut down for timber (39\u201340); that the missing piece from the shaft of the Saxon Cross had been broken up for domestic use (p.\u00a044); and that in general the profit of the living was put before respect for the dead (46\u20137).", "Eyam Museum was opened in 1994 and, besides its focus on the plague, includes exhibits on the village's local history in general. Among the art exhibits there are painted copies from different eras of a print (taken from a drawing by Francis Chantrey) in Ebenezer Rhodes' Peak Scenery (1818). These depict the sweep of the road by the 'plague cottages' where the first victims died, with the church tower beyond. The local amateur John Platt painted in naive style and is represented by depictions of the Riley Graves (1871) and the old windmill (1874)."]}, {"page": "Master Cutler", "response": ["*1808 Ebenezer Rhodes"]}, {"page": "William Bernard Cooke", "response": ["of the Tamar\" and \"Plymouth\", and in 1819 five plates of \"Views in Sussex\" which were published with explanatory notices by R.

In addition, two accounts of him are given in 19th century works dealing with Eyam, Ebenezer Rhodes' Peak Scenery and William Wood's The History and Antiquities of Eyam. The account of him given in a past edition of the Dictionary of National Biography is vague and conjectural.", "Very soon after his appointment, Cunningham mentions being engaged in literary pursuits and even showed the Rector and his daughter (who was the same age as himself) some of his poems. At the time he was first venturing on publication in 1783, he encountered the labouring-class poet William Newton and introduced him to Anna Seward. She too encouraged his writing and sent a poem of Newton's, addressed \u201cTo the Rev. Peter Cunningham, author of Britannia\u2019s Naval Triumph\u201d, to The Gentleman\u2019s Magazine (March 1785). As well as expressing gratitude for Cunningham\u2019s friendship, it takes up the patriotic theme of the poem and ends with the hope that he will \u201cStill with thy pen thy country\u2019s cause defend, Her warmest patriot and her firmest friend.\u201dThe poem also appeared in the Scots Magazine, vol. 47, p.90 The patriotism did continue and Cunningham showed particular loyalty to the royal family as defenders of the Church of England. He wrote an ode that was sung during celebrations in Chesterfield of the 1788 centenary of the 'Glorious Revolution'Quoted by Ebenezer Rhodes, p.291 and in the following year published A sermon preached at Eyam, Derbyshire, on Thursday the 23d of April, 1789, being the day appointed for a general thanksgiving for His Majesty's happy recovery.", "In his letter to the Reverend Thomas Wilson written in 1788,p.137-40 Cunningham referred to \u2018the former variegated and adversely shaded part of my life\u2019 before taking the curacy at Eyam, which replicates his mention of earlier misfortune and hardship in his first letter to Seward. But now, he continues, \u2018I have thoroughly reconciled myself to the obscurity and sequestered nature of my situation\u2019. After the publication of The Naval Triumph, George Rodney had offered to help find him a situation in Ireland but he had refused this, as he did initially an offer of the chaplaincy to the British factory at Smyrna so long as there was still the possibility of staying on at Eyam after Seward gave up the rectorship. Forced at last to accept the chaplaincy, he left for Smyrna in 1790 and in order to meet expenses had to sell his books and other possessions. During the years he spent in Turkey he nearly lost his life in a shipwreck, and then in a fire on land which destroyed all his papers. Reduced once more to the utmost poverty, he set out to walk back to Britain across Turkish territory, until he discovered a timely gift of money left in a book of poems with which he had been presented on leaving.Ebenezer Rhodes, pp.53-5", "Cunningham published several poems anonymously, often combining topography with political themes. Their style was characterised by Ebenezer Rhodes as \"elegant and tasteful in expression\u2026but cold in feeling. His lines, though generally graceful, and not unfrequently polished to excellence, are occasionally cumbrous and sluggish from an excess of epithet\u2026As a poet he had many beauties, checkered with a considerable proportion of defect.\"Eliot, p.48 Their procession of allegorical abstractions and Latinate poeticisms was complained of as hindering his meaning. \u201cEverything is buried in gloom and obscurity. In other words, we are presented with a great deal of pompous and high-sounding language which leaves no distinct impression on our minds.\u201dThe Monthly Review vol. 81, p.280", "*Ebenezer Rhodes, Peak Scenery, London 1824, pp.\u00a047\u201355"]}]}}
