For instance in the 1870s and 1880s John Gilbert Baker considerably reorganised Hippeastrum. In 1878 he described nine sections of the genus, but by 1888 he included seven subgenera, namely (number of species in parentheses) Habranthus (10), Phycella (3), Rhodophiala (5), Macropododastrum (1), Omphalissa (6), Aschamia (10) and Lais (3), some of which have since been treated as separate genera (Habranthus, Rhodophiala). Baker both reduced the original number of species of Herbert, but also enlarged the genus by adding in other genera such as Habranthus, Phycella, Rhodophiala and Rhodolirion (also called Rhodolirium, and subsequently moved to Rhodophilia), which he included as separate sections of Hippeastrum. In addition, he included many new species being discovered in South America, particularly Chile. His 1878 classification included 47 species, reduced to 38 by 1888."]}, {"page": "William Jackson Hooker", "response": ["He was engaged on the Synopsis filicum with the botanist John Gilbert Baker when he contracted a throat infection then epidemic at Kew.

The bark is dark and has many distinctive, deep fissures. The leaves are shiny and leathery in appearance with a slightly scalloped edge; they turn bright red with age. Leaves are up to  in length. The small white flowers are difficult to see amongst the dense foliage; male and bisexual flowers are carried on the drooping inflorescence. The generic name Medusagyne was given to the plant by John Gilbert Baker who thought that the gynoecium of the flower resembles the head of Medusa from Greek mythology. Baker did not have the dehisced fruit, which resembles a larval hydrozoan or jellyfish, so he did not base the generic name on this resemblance; the vernacular name, jellyfish tree, was applied later possibly based on the appearance of the dehisced fruit and the coincidence that the word medusa is also used to describe the free-floating umbrella-shaped form of jellyfish.Robertson, Ann, Rosemary Wise, and Frank White. 1989. Medusagyne oppositifolia. Curtis's Botanical Magazine, 6: 166\u2013171. doi: 10.1111/j.1467-8748.1989.tb00650.x This plant exhibits many adaptations to dry climate, strange on a moist archipelago.

In 1895 he revised his classification of Yucca, to four equal groups, of which Hesperoyucca was one. In 1876, John Gilbert Baker gave it the rank of subgenus; in 1892 he noted that it \"had better be kept as a genus distinct from Yucca\" (but actually retained the name Y. whippleii [sic])."]}, {"page": "Melanophylla", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by John Gilbert Baker"]}, {"page": "Victoria Medal of Honour", "response": ["*John Gilbert Baker (1834\u20131920)"]}, {"page": "Gilbert Baker", "response": ["* Edmund Gilbert Baker (1864\u20131949), English plant collector and botanist; son of John Gilbert Baker", "* John Gilbert Baker (1834\u20131920), English botanist"]}, {"page": "Lilium ledebourii", "response": ["Category:Taxa named by John Gilbert Baker"]}]}}
