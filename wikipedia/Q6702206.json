By the end of the week, McCall made his first transfer of the summer when he signed goalkeeper Jonathan McLaughlin from non-league Harrogate Town. It was not until the end of the month that he added his second signing, when midfielder Chris Brandon, a former club trainee, joined from Huddersfield Town on a free transfer. Defender Paul Arnison, who had been released by Carlisle United in May, became the club's third summer transfer, when he signed a two-year contract on 18 June 2008.

Barry Conlon scored two of the goals in just his fourth league start of the season, with Peter Thorne scoring City's other goal in a 3\u20133 draw. The first round of the FA Cup saw City drawn against Milton Keynes Dons, who had won promotion to League One the previous season. However, City pulled off an upset with a 2\u20131 victory at stadium:mk with goals from Daley and Lee. The following week's return to league action saw City against Wycombe Wanderers, who were second in the league and had the only remaining undefeated league record in the country. A second half goal from Lewis Hunt gave Wycombe a 1\u20130 victory. Full back Luke O'Brien scored his first senior goal in City's next league game as City defeated Rotherham United 2\u20130 in their first game at the Don Valley Stadium, Rotherham's temporary home. Nicky Law's first goal of his second spell completed the scoring. A second half penalty from Conlon three days later against Chesterfield gave City back-to-back victories and their second 3\u20132 of the season after being 2\u20130 down. First half goals from Graeme Lee and Michael Boulding had started the comeback in the first half before Chesterfield were reduced to ten men when Alan Goodall was sent off for committing the foul which led to Conlon's penalty. Winger Omar Daley was injured in the game, becoming the latest midfielder to be sidelined.
