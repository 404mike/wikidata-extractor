Even before the company's opening performance, four prominent Northern Irish writers were invited to join the project \u2014 Seamus Deane, David Hammond, Seamus Heaney, and Tom Paulin; they would eventually become Field Day's board of directors. (Thomas Kilroy, the only member born in the Republic, joined the board in 1988). All of the members of Field Day agreed that art and culture had a crucial role to play in the resolution of what had come to be known as \"the Troubles\":", "The first set of three pamphlets were written by directors of the Field Day Company \u2013 Tom Paulin, Seamus Heaney and Seamus Deane.  The pamphlets were largely responsible for entering Field Day into the political debate whose calcified terms the project had originally wanted to explode.  With Tom Paulin's Riot Act (1984) the division between critic and artist began to crumble, the politics of the pamphlets were finding their way into the plays (Richtarik 242).", "In the 1990 introduction to Nationalism, Colonialism, and Literature \u2014 a collection of three Field Day Pamphlets by Terry Eagleton, Fredric Jameson and Edward Said \u2014 Deane writes: \"Field Day's analysis of the (Northern Irish) situation derives from the conviction that it is, above all, a colonial crisis\" (Eagleton 6).  In this essay Deane calls for a re-engagement with the concept of nationalism, and positions Field Day in a squarely antithetical position to those he refers to as revisionist historians and critics, whose chief aim is \"to demolish the nationalist mythology\" (6).  The categories of revisionist and anti-revisionist were all too easily superimposed onto the categories of unionist and nationalist, and the space between them, created by the production of Translations, was closing fast. For some, Seamus Deane had become the de facto spokesman, and Field Day became increasingly associated with republican politics and post-colonial theory.", "In 2005, Field Day Publications was launched in association with the Dublin school of the Keough-Naughton Institute for Irish Studies at the University of Notre Dame, Indiana.  With Seamus Deane as General Editor, the company's first publication was Field Day Review 1, an annual journal primarily concerned with Irish literary and political culture, but in an international context. To critical acclaim, Field Day Review has published essays and interviews by numerous eminent academics, including Benedict Anderson, Giovanni Arrighi, Tariq Ali, Terry Eagleton, Seamus Deane, Pascale Casanova, Alan Ahearne, Kevin Whelan, David Lloyd, Brendan O'Leary, Luke Gibbons, and Joe Cleary.  Field Day Review 10 was published in October 2014.", "In 1990 Field Day Published the three-volume Field Day Anthology of Irish Writing, edited by Seamus Deane.  The project, according to Deane, was nothing less than an \"act of definition\", one which he hoped would be inclusive and representative of the plurality of Irish identity:  \"There is a story here, a meta-narrative, which is, we believe, hospitable to all the micro-narratives that, from time to time, have achieved prominence as the official version of the true history, political and literary, of the island's past and present\".  The Anthology was immediately attacked by Field Day's critics as politically biased. The anthology's most conspicuous flaw, however, was the paucity of women writers. In response to the accusations that Field Day had elided the female voice, a new all-female board of editors issued two additional volumes, which exceeded the first three in length.", "===Journalism, Podcasting, and Annual Seamus Deane Lecture===", "The annual Seamus Deane Lecture was inaugurated in 2015 with a lecture by Deane himself.
