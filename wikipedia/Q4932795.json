After a brief spell at Glentoran, it was Irish League rivals Linfield who bought him out of his army contract and took him on as a player. Hill spent three successful seasons with the Belfast club, winning two Irish Cup and two League Champions medals with them.On February 1893, Hill arrived at Sheffield United, scoring on his debut as a trialist and prompting United to sign him permanently. He soon established himself in United's first team and played in the 1893 test\u2013match victory that saw them promoted to the First Division. Hill was a regular in the side for the following two seasons and despite starting the 1895\u201396 season as a first-choice striker, he was surprisingly transferred to Ardwick in November 1895 along with Joe Davies and Hugh Morris.After two years at Ardwick, Hill spent a brief period with Watford St. Marys in 1898, before joining Millwall (1898\u201399) and then Brighton United (1899\u20131900). Then, Hill returned to his native Scotland to play for Dundee and finished his career with his home town club Forfar Athletic.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bobby Hill", "response": ["Bobby Hill or Bob Hill may refer to:", "* Bob Hill (footballer) (18671938), Scottish footballer", "* Bob Hill (American football) (born 1891), American football player", "* Bob Hill (politician) (born 1940), Jersey politician and human rights campaigner", "* Bob Hill (born 1948), American basketball coach", "* Bob Hill (racing driver), American race car driver, see List of ARCA drivers", "* All pages with titles containing \"Bob Hill\""]}, {"page": "List of Sheffield United F.C. seasons", "response": ["|Bob Hill"]}, {"page": "Hugh Morris (footballer, born 1872)", "response": ["Morris was first spotted by Ardwick when playing for Chirk in the Welsh cup and the Manchester side duly signed him in 1891.

The following season Ardwick were admitted to the newly formed Football League Second Division and Morris played in the club's first ever Football League fixture, scoring twice as Ardwick beat Bootle 7\u20130. Morris continued to play regularly for Ardwick before he was transferred to Sheffield United, then of the First Division in December 1893. He became a regular in United's first team for the following 18 months, having rejected an offer to play in the United States in 1894, and made 39 league appearances, scoring nine goals for the Yorkshire club.  In September 1895 Morris was suspended for \"lodging in a public house\" (the club was run on strict Methodist lines at the time and this was against the terms of his contract), before being transferred back to Ardwick, now renamed Manchester City, in the following November along with Joe Davies and Bob Hill. Returning to Hyde Road, Morris made 20 appearances in his second spell at the Manchester club, before moving to Grimsby Town in May 1896 where he played for a further season.
