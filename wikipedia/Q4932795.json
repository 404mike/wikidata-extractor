After a brief spell at Glentoran, it was Irish League rivals Linfield who bought him out of his army contract and took him on as a player. Hill spent three successful seasons with the Belfast club, winning two Irish Cup and two League Champions medals with them.On February 1893, Hill arrived at Sheffield United, scoring on his debut as a trialist and prompting United to sign him permanently. He soon established himself in United's first team and played in the 1893 test\u2013match victory that saw them promoted to the First Division. Hill was a regular in the side for the following two seasons and despite starting the 1895\u201396 season as a first-choice striker, he was surprisingly transferred to Ardwick in November 1895 along with Joe Davies and Hugh Morris.After two years at Ardwick, Hill spent a brief period with Watford St. Marys in 1898, before joining Millwall (1898\u201399) and then Brighton United (1899\u20131900). Then, Hill returned to his native Scotland to play for Dundee and finished his career with his home town club Forfar Athletic.", "link_mentions": {}}}
