After 60 minutes of the game, Sheffield Wednesday were 2\u20130 up, but Ian Marshall pulled a goal back, then Paul Bernard equalised with less than ten minutes to play.  By this point, West Ham were losing. In time added on, Andy Barlow went down in the box and the referee awarded a penalty.  Neil Redfearn stepped up to convert it and a mass pitch invasion followed, as it had been confirmed that West Ham had lost 2\u20131 at home to Notts County. In gaining promotion to the top flight, Oldham Athletic were forced to have the plastic pitch removed because of league rules.  They stayed in the top division for three seasons (1991\u201392, 1992\u201393 and 1993\u201394) before being relegated, and after three disappointing seasons in the second tier were relegated again in 1997.
