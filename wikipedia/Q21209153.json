Much of his social interaction came at the museum and library; once offered several months' leave by the keeper of manuscripts Daniel Waley to work on a Yates Thompson manuscript catalogue, which Turner thought could be his magnum opus, he nevertheless declined, lest he sacrifice his daily interactions with colleagues."]}, {"page": "Waley, Daniel", "response": ["#redirectDaniel Waley"]}, {"page": "Daniel Philip Waley", "response": ["#REDIRECT Daniel Waley"]}, {"page": "Nicolai Rubinstein", "response": ["* Daniel Waley, \"Rubinstein, Nicolai, 1911\u20132002\", Proceedings of the British Academy, vol. 124 (2004), pp.\u00a0313\u2013330."]}]}}
