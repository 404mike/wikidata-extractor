He also studied the motion of the planets and calculated the orbits of Trojan asteroids.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "New moon", "response": ["The most commonly used was the Brown Lunation Number (BLN), which defines lunation 1 as beginning at the first new moon of 1923, the year when Ernest William Brown's lunar theory was introduced in the American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac.
