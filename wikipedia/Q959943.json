He understood the original language of many sacred texts, e.g., Hindu (Sanskit), Buddhist (Pali), Islamic (Arabic). Earlier, starting in World War II, he had served as an intelligence officer in Iran. At Oxford University his first writings had been on the Zoroastrian religion and its texts. Appointed Spalding Professor, his books addressed such subjects as mystical experience (articulating a widely cited typology), Hinduism, comparative religion, Christianity and other religions, and ethics. He translated the Bhagavad-Gita, providing an extensive commentary based on Hindu tradition and sources. His last books addressed similar issues in popular culture, which led to his talks on the BBC. He published under the name R. C. Zaehner.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Doors of Perception", "response": ["The Doors of Perception provoked strong reactions for its evaluation of psychedelic drugs as facilitators of mystical insight with great potential benefits for science, art, and religion. While many found the argument compelling, others including writer Thomas Mann, Vedantic monk Swami Prabhavananda, philosopher Martin Buber and scholar Robert Charles Zaehner countered that the effects of mescaline are subjective and should not be conflated with objective religious mysticism. Huxley himself continued to take psychedelics for the rest of his life, and the understanding he gained from them influenced his 1962 final novel Island.", "==== Robert Charles Zaehner ====", "Robert Charles Zaehner, a professor at Oxford University, formed one of the fullest and earliest critiques of The Doors of Perception from a religious and philosophical perspective. In 1954, Zaehner published an article called The Menace of Mescaline, in which he asserted that \"artificial interference with consciousness\" could have nothing to do with the Christian \"Beatific Vision\".Richards, William A. \"Entheogens in the Study of Religious Experiences: Current Status\", Journal of Religion and Health, Vol. 44, No. 4 (Winter, 2005), pp. 377\u2013389 Zaehner expanded on these criticisms in his book Mysticism Sacred and Profane (1957), which also acts as a theistic riposte to what he sees as the monism of Huxley's The Perennial Philosophy. Although he acknowledged the importance of The Doors of Perception as a challenge to people interested in religious experience,Zaehner, RC (1957) Mysticism Sacred and Profane, Clarendon Press, p. 3 he pointed out what he saw as inconsistencies and self-contradictions.Zaehner p. 25 Zaehner concludes that Huxley's apprehensions under mescaline are affected by his deep familiarity with Vedanta and Mahayana Buddhism. So the experience may not be the same for others who take the drug and do not have this background, although they will undoubtedly experience a transformation of sensation.Zaehner p. 3 Zaehner himself was a convert to Catholicism."]}, {"page": "Magi", "response": ["Better preserved are the descriptions of the mid-5th century BCE Herodotus, who in his portrayal of the Iranian expatriates living in Asia Minor uses the term \"magi\" in two different senses. In the first sense (Histories 1.101), Herodotus speaks of the magi as one of the tribes/peoples (ethnous) of the Medes. In another sense (1.132), Herodotus uses the term \"magi\" to generically refer to a \"sacerdotal caste\", but \"whose ethnic origin is never again so much as mentioned.\". According to Robert Charles Zaehner, in other accounts, \"we hear of Magi not only in Persia, Parthia, Bactria, Chorasmia, Aria, Media, and among the Sakas, but also in non-Iranian lands like Samaria, Ethiopia, and Egypt. Their influence was also widespread throughout Asia Minor. It is, therefore, quite likely that the sacerdotal caste of the Magi was distinct from the Median tribe of the same name.\""]}, {"page": "Catechism", "response": ["In Zoroastrianism there is the \"\u010c\u012aDAG ANDARZ \u012a P\u014cRY\u014cTK\u0112\u0160\u0100N\" also known as \"Pand-n\u0101mag \u012b Zardu\u0161t\" (Book of the counsels of Zoroaster), which is a post-Sasanian compendium of apothegms intended to instruct every Zoroastrian male, upon his attaining the age of fifteen years, in fundamental religious and ethical principles, as well as in the daily duties incumbent upon him.
