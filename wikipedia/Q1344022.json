The union officials were later cleared of any wrongdoing. It was later claimed that key evidence thought to have been retracted had not been withdrawn, prompting several Falkirk councillors to urge Miliband to publish details of the party's internal inquiry or to hold a fresh investigation. On the 4 November edition of Good Morning Scotland, Lamont said there was a case for a fresh inquiry, but that Labour does not publish details of its internal investigations. Later the same day, Labour said that it would not be reopening the investigation. Miliband subsequently said that a new investigation was unnecessary. On 8 December the former MSP Karen Whitefield was selected to contest the seat. The report into Labour's inquiry was leaked to the media in February 2014, and concluded there was \"no doubt\" that Unite had attempted to manipulate the selection process."]}, {"page": "Airdrie and Shotts (Scottish Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Karen Whitefield"]}, {"page": "Central Scotland (Scottish Parliament electoral region)", "response": ["| rowspan=\"3\"| Karen Whitefield(Labour)"]}]}}
