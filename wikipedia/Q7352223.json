Deriving its modern usage from the French solidarit\u00e9 meaning \"communion of interests and responsibilities\" or \"mutual responsibility,\" the concept of solidarity was championed by \u00c9mile Durkheim in his De la division du travail social: \u00e9tude sur l'organisation des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s sup\u00e9rieures (The Division of Labor in Society, 1893). There, Durkheim envisions solidarit\u00e9 as a kind of human fraternity dependent upon the existence of personal bonds, which are needed for the realization of common goals or ideals within groups. Unlike justice, which tends to focus on rules and principles without specific references to personal bonds, solidarity requires an acknowledgement of subjective ties; it involves a degree of sentiment de camaraderie, or fellow feeling, which is shared by subjects within or between groups. Durkheim was part of numerous Judeo-Christian ethical and political systems that responded to the Industrial Revolution at the close of the 19th century. Arp tries to extend Attfield's notion of solidarity and show how, in addition to the Judeo-Christian tradition, solidarity as an ethical principle may be found in Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Confucianism, Daoism, Islam, as well as in certain traditional African religions, and Native American religions and among the religions of Indigenous Australians. It is through the ubiquitousness of solidarity, then, that issues having to do with local, national, and global forms of environmental justice (for example, poverty, human rights deprivation, environmental racism) may be confronted. Religious beliefs are part of the very fabric of human existence, so if a religious-based ethical sentiment can be harnessed\u2014as one finds in solidarity\u2014and used as a motivator for confronting environmental injustice, then it is more likely to be enduring. So claims Arp."]}, {"page": "Clare Palmer", "response": ["Palmer first sets forth a process ethic. The ethic she presents is similar to John Stuart Mill's utilitarianism, but while Mill's approach locates value in pleasure, Palmer's process ethic locates value in \"richness\" of experience. She then compares this ethic to several dominant schools in environmental ethics: \"individualist consequentialism\" (as championed by Peter Singer, Donald VanDeVeer and Robin Attfield), \"individualist deontological environmental ethics\" (including the diverse positions presented by Albert Schweitzer, Kenneth Goodpastor, Tom Regan and Paul W. Taylor), \"collectivist environmental ethics\" (including those thinkers who advocate doing what is best for nature as a whole, such as Aldo Leopold and Callicott in his earlier work) and deep ecology."]}, {"page": "Attfield", "response": ["*Robin Attfield, British academic"]}]}}
