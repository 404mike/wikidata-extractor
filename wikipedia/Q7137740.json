He had stood as a Coalition Conservative, and like others holding the \"coalition coupon\", he defeated the sitting Liberal Party MP Herbert Samuel.\nGoff was re-elected in  1922, but the constituency remained a 3-way marginal seat, with Liberal, Conservative and Labour Party candidates all polling over 27% of the votes throughout the 1920s, and he lost in 1923 to the Liberal candidate Sir Charles Walter Starmer.  Goff regained the seat at the 1924 general election, but was defeated again at the 1929 election, this time by the Labour candidate William Thomas Mansfield.\nGoff did not stand again in Cleveland, but at the 1931 election he was elected as MP for Chatham in Kent. He stood down from Parliament at the 1935 general election.He was appointed as a King's Counsel in 1925, and made a baronet on 3 March 1936, 'of Goffs Oak, in the County of Hertford'.

When MacDonald formed the National Government, Stanley Baldwin and the Conservatives joined it; most Labour members, including Oliver Baldwin, did not. The 1931 general election resulted in a landslide win for the National Government and a disaster for Labour. Baldwin was among the casualties, defeated by a Conservative candidate, Sir Park Goff, who won by 19,991 votes to Baldwin's 10,837 at Chatham.\"The General Election\", The Times, 28 October 1931, p. 6 Baldwin returned to journalism. In Walker's view, he was better known as a journalist than as a politician, writing anti-fascist articles in the usually pro-appeasement Rothermere press during the 1930s. He also wrote what the reviewer Andrew Lycett calls \"a curious novel called The Coming of Aissa, which emphasised the socialistic leanings of Jesus within an agnostic, Asian, neoplatonic context.\""]}, {"page": "Imperial Society of Knights Bachelor", "response": ["# Sir Park Goff, Bt, KC (1921\u20131939)"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1918 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Sir Park Goff"]}, {"page": "Cleveland (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Sir Park Goff", "| Sir Park Goff", "*Unionist: Park Goff"]}, {"page": "Chatham (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["|| 1931 || Sir Park Goff || Conservative"]}, {"page": "Records of members of parliament of the United Kingdom", "response": [":Park Goff, 1924, 1931"]}, {"page": "List of Conservative Party MPs (UK)", "response": ["*Sir Park Goff"]}, {"page": "Charles Starmer", "response": ["Starmer was first elected a member of the Darlington Town Council in 1903, becoming an Alderman in 1915.
