He had stood as a Coalition Conservative, and like others holding the \"coalition coupon\", he defeated the sitting Liberal Party MP Herbert Samuel.\nGoff was re-elected in  1922, but the constituency remained a 3-way marginal seat, with Liberal, Conservative and Labour Party candidates all polling over 27% of the votes throughout the 1920s, and he lost in 1923 to the Liberal candidate Sir Charles Walter Starmer.  Goff regained the seat at the 1924 general election, but was defeated again at the 1929 election, this time by the Labour candidate William Thomas Mansfield.\nGoff did not stand again in Cleveland, but at the 1931 election he was elected as MP for Chatham in Kent. He stood down from Parliament at the 1935 general election.He was appointed as a King's Counsel in 1925, and made a baronet on 3 March 1936, 'of Goffs Oak, in the County of Hertford'. The title became extinct on his death in 1939, aged 68.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
