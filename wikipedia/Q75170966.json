He developed a new form of dry battery that enabled him to build, in 1888, an electric bus that he ran successfully for at least 3,000 miles (4,800 km).  In March 1894 he built an electric parcel van that was used in central London and later developed electric private cars.  Bersey also developed an electric cab design, 75 of which were built and used by the London Electrical Cab Company to run a service between 1897 and 1899.  They were not financially successful owing to noise and vibration leading to excessive damage to tyres and batteries.  In his later career Bersey developed designs for internal combustion engine cars and during the First World War served with the Royal Flying Corps and Royal Air Force.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hackney carriage", "response": ["Electric hackney carriages appeared before the introduction of the internal combustion engine to vehicles for hire in 1897. In fact there was even London Electrical Cab Company: the cabs were informally called Berseys after the manager who designed them, Walter Bersey. Another nickname was Hummingbirds from the sound that they made. In August 1897, 25 were introduced, and by 1898, there were 50 more. During the early 20th century, cars generally replaced horse-drawn models. In 1910, the number of motor cabs on London streets outnumbered horse-drawn growlers and hansoms for the first time. At the time of the outbreak of World War I, the ratio was seven to one in favor of motorized cabs. The last horse-drawn hackney carriage ceased service in London in 1947."]}, {"page": "History of the electric vehicle", "response": ["Electric battery-powered taxis became available at the end of the 19th century.

In London, Walter Bersey's electric cabs were the first self-propelled vehicles for hire at a time when cabs were horse-drawn. In New York City, a fleet of twelve hansom cabs and one brougham, based on the design of the Electrobat II, were part of a project funded in part by the Electric Storage Battery Company of Philadelphia. During the 20th century, the main manufacturers of electric vehicles in the US included Anthony Electric, Baker, Columbia, Anderson, Edison, Riker, Milburn, Bailey Electric, and Detroit Electric. Their electric vehicles were quieter than gasoline-powered, and did not require gear changes."]}, {"page": "Taxi", "response": ["Electric battery-powered taxis became available at the end of the 19th century.

Developed by Walter Bersey the vehicles reportedly had a top speed of  and could carry two passengers.  An initial service of 12 cabs began on 19 August 1897 and a total of 77 were built, with a maximum of 75 in service at once.  They were initially popular and were nicknamed \"hummingbirds\" for the sound they made and their distinctive livery.  The vehicles suffered badly from wear in service owing to their heavy weight.  This damaged the batteries and tyres, which were expensive to replace, and made their operation unprofitable.  The cabs were withdrawn in August 1899 and electric cabs did not return to the streets of London until the Nissan Dynamo was introduced in October 2019.", "The Bersey cab was designed by Walter Bersey, an electrical engineer who had earlier constructed an electric powered bus and van as well as private cars.  The cab was driven by a Johnson-Lundell electric motor described variously as 3.5 or 8 horsepower or 2.2 kilowatts.  Power was supplied by a bank of 40 grid-plate traction batteries with a total capacity of 170 ampere hours (assuming a 30 ampere demand).  The batteries weighed 14 hundredweight () and, being delicate, were hung underneath the chassis on springs.  Before going into service the batteries went through testing on Bersey's \"shaking machine\" to ensure they would stand up to the rigours of use."]}, {"page": "Walter Charles Bersey", "response": ["#redirectWalter Bersey"]}]}}
