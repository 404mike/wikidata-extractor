He developed a new form of dry battery that enabled him to build, in 1888, an electric bus that he ran successfully for at least 3,000 miles (4,800 km).  In March 1894 he built an electric parcel van that was used in central London and later developed electric private cars.  Bersey also developed an electric cab design, 75 of which were built and used by the London Electrical Cab Company to run a service between 1897 and 1899.  They were not financially successful owing to noise and vibration leading to excessive damage to tyres and batteries.  In his later career Bersey developed designs for internal combustion engine cars and during the First World War served with the Royal Flying Corps and Royal Air Force.", "link_mentions": {}}}
