While the other boys in the group tried other activities, he stayed in the table tennis hall, where that he received coaching from Harry Venner, who was the resident coach and an England international at the time. Because he showed a lot of enthusiasm for the game and because of his rapid progress in learning how to play, Venner nominated him for 'Boy of the week' prize, a competition that was sponsored by the News of the World newspaper. Winning this prize meant that he could return later in the summer season for a free week's holiday to receive more coaching. This also gave him the opportunity to be coached by the England No. 1 at the time, Ian Harrison of Gloucestershire. The following year, Barnes again went on holiday with his family to Butlin's, at their Bognor Regis holiday camp. Despite having to compete with the two top England junior boys at the time, Maurice Billington of Warwickshire and Brian Hill from Lincolnshire, he was once again awarded the coveted News of the World 'Boy of the Week' prize, presented by Johnny Leach, the former table tennis World champion."]}, {"page": "Table Tennis England", "response": ["| Ian Harrison"]}, {"page": "List of England players at the World Team Table Tennis Championships", "response": ["|Viktor Barna (npc), Richard Bergmann, Ian Harrison, Brian Kennedy, Johnny Leach, Alan Rhodes", "|Viktor Barna (npc), Ian Harrison, Jeff Ingber, Brian Kennedy, Johnny Leach, Michael Thornhill", "|Ron Crayden (npc), Ian Harrison, Jeff Ingber, Johnny Leach, Bryan Merrett", "|Ron Crayden (npc), Chester Barnes, David Creamer, Ian Harrison, Bryan Merrett", "|Johnny Leach (npc), Chester Barnes, Denis Neale, Ian Harrison, Brian Wright", "|Johnny Leach (npc), Chester Barnes, Denis Neale, Stuart Gibbs, Ian Harrison"]}, {"page": "Michael Thornhill (table tennis)", "response": ["He competed at the 1951 World Table Tennis Championships with Ron Crayden, Brian Kennedy, Johnny Leach and Aubrey Simons and 1959 World Table Tennis Championships in the Swaythling Cup (men's team event) with Ian Harrison, Jeff Ingber, Kennedy and Leach for England."]}, {"page": "David Creamer", "response": ["Creamer represented England at the 1963 World Table Tennis Championships in the Swaythling Cup (men's team event) with Chester Barnes,  Ian Harrison and Bryan Merrett.
