He continued in the same vein, finishing with an outstanding debut innings return of 8\u201370, although he was less successful (2\u201369) in the second innings and Worcestershire were defeated by 11 runs thanks to 6\u201319 from John Brown. \nWilson enjoyed a fine first season in first-class cricket, finishing with 92 wickets at 22.46, including 8\u201346 in Worcestershire's first win, against Oxford University and eight wickets in the match in their first Championship win, against Leicestershire in late July. He also played twice against the touring Australians: once for an England XI, when he took only one wicket (that of Victor Trumper), and once for a Midland Counties side, for whom he was more successful and picked up five wickets in the game.\nIn 1900, Wilson passed 100 wickets for the first time, a feat he was to repeat in 1901 and 1902, his best being 122 wickets in 1901. The 1900 season also saw him make his highest score of 78 against London County, batting at number 11 and adding 97 for the last wicket with Albert Bird; while in 1901, he played in a Rest of England side against Yorkshire, a game in which Gilbert Jessop scored 233 for the Rest of England in about two and a half hours. In these three summers combined, Wilson took five or more wickets in an innings on 30 occasions.\nFrom 1903 onwards, Wilson's effectiveness steadily declined; indeed, after 1901, he took fewer wickets each summer until his retirement five years later. However, he remained good enough to be selected for the Players of the South against Gentlemen of the South in 1903, while the following year he achieved career-best innings figures of 9\u201375 against Oxford University.\nIn 1906 Wilson's season's bowling average, which with the exception of 1904 had remained in the low twenties throughout his career, ballooned to 36.09, and at the end of that season he retired from first-class cricket. He died in Abbots Langley, Hertfordshire, just over a month short of his 85th birthday.\nHis son, George Clifford Wilson, played 70 times for Worcestershire between 1924 and 1926.", "link_mentions": {}}}
