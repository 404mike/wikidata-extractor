Sixty years after the scandal the official biographer of King George V, Harold Nicolson, was told by Lord Goddard, who was a twelve-year-old schoolboy at the time of the scandal, that Prince Albert Victor \"had been involved in a male brothel scene, and that a solicitor had to commit perjury to clear him. The solicitor was struck off the rolls for his offence, but was thereafter reinstated.\"Lees-Milne, p. 231. In fact, none of the lawyers involved in the case was convicted of perjury or struck off at the time, indeed most had very distinguished careers. However, Arthur Newton was struck off for 12 months for professional misconduct in 1910 after falsifying letters from another of his clients\u2014the notorious murderer Harvey Crippen.Cook, pp. 284\u2013285. In 1913, he was struck off indefinitely and sentenced to three years' imprisonment for obtaining money by false pretences.Cook, pp. 285\u2013286, and Hyde, The Cleveland Street Scandal, p. 253. Newton may have invented and spread the rumours about Prince Albert Victor in an attempt to protect his clients from prosecution by forcing a cover-up.Prince Eddy: The King We Never Had. Channel 4. Accessed 1 May 2010. State papers on the case in the Public Record Office, released to the public in the 1970s, provide no information on the prince's involvement other than Newton's threat to implicate him.Cook, pp. 172\u2013173. Hamilton Cuffe wrote to the Director of Public Prosecutions, Sir Augustus Stephenson, \"I am told that Newton has boasted that if we go on a very distinguished person will be involved (PAV). I don't mean to say that I for one instant credit it\u2014but in such circumstances as this one never knows what may be said, be concocted or be true.\"Hyde, The Cleveland Street Scandal, p. 55.

When Prince Albert Victor's name appeared in the American press, the New York Herald published an anonymous letter, almost certainly written by Charles Hall, saying \"there is not, and never was, the slightest excuse for mentioning the name of Prince Albert Victor.\"Hyde, The Cleveland Street Scandal, p. 129. Biographers who believe the rumours suppose that Prince Albert Victor was bisexual,Aronson, pp. 116\u2013120, 170, 217. but this is strongly contested by others who refer to him as \"ardently heterosexual\" and his involvement in the rumours as \"somewhat unfair\".Bradford, p. 10."]}, {"page": "Royal Archives", "response": ["Reginald Brett, 2nd Viscount Esher was the first appointment as Keeper of the Royal Archives."]}, {"page": "Constables and Governors of Windsor Castle", "response": ["| Reginald Brett, 2nd Viscount Esher || 1928 || 1930 || "]}, {"page": "Brett", "response": ["* Reginald Brett, 2nd Viscount Esher (1852\u20131930), British politician"]}, {"page": "Regy Brett", "response": ["#REDIRECT Reginald Brett, 2nd Viscount Esher"]}, {"page": "Reginald Baliol Brett", "response": ["#REDIRECT Reginald Brett, 2nd Viscount Esher"]}, {"page": "1930 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 22 January \u2013 Reginald Brett, 2nd Viscount Esher, politician and courtier (born 1852)"]}, {"page": "1852 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 30 June \u2013 Reginald Brett, 2nd Viscount Esher, politician and courtier (died 1930)"]}]}}
