He played first-class cricket for the Marylebone Cricket Club and Sussex between 1844 and 1861, as well as numerous other invitational and representative teams including an England XI and a pre-county Middlesex. A right-handed bat, Haygarth played 136 games now regarded as first-class, scoring 3,042 runs and taking 19 wickets with his part-time bowling. He was educated at Harrow, which had established a rich tradition as a proving ground for cricketers. He served on many MCC committees and was elected a life member in 1864.Outside his playing career, Haygarth was a noted cricket writer and historian. He spent over sixty years compiling information and statistics. Of particular note was his compilation: Frederick Lillywhite's Cricket Scores and Biographies, published in 15 volumes between 1862 and 1879.\n\n", "link_mentions": {}}}
