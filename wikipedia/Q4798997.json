He played first-class cricket for the Marylebone Cricket Club and Sussex between 1844 and 1861, as well as numerous other invitational and representative teams including an England XI and a pre-county Middlesex. A right-handed bat, Haygarth played 136 games now regarded as first-class, scoring 3,042 runs and taking 19 wickets with his part-time bowling. He was educated at Harrow, which had established a rich tradition as a proving ground for cricketers. He served on many MCC committees and was elected a life member in 1864.Outside his playing career, Haygarth was a noted cricket writer and historian. He spent over sixty years compiling information and statistics. Of particular note was his compilation: Frederick Lillywhite's Cricket Scores and Biographies, published in 15 volumes between 1862 and 1879.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Charles Greville (diarist)", "response": ["* Arthur Haygarth, Scores & Biographies, Volumes 1\u201311 (1744\u20131870), Lillywhite, 1862\u201372"]}, {"page": "Marylebone Cricket Club", "response": ["The origin of MCC was as a gentlemen's club that had flourished through most of the 18th century, including, at least in part, an existence as the original London Cricket Club, which had played at the Artillery Ground through the middle years of the century. Many of its members became involved with the Hambledon Club through the 1770s and then, in the early 1780s, had returned to the London area where the White Conduit Club had begun in Islington. It is not known for certain when the White Conduit was founded but it seems to have been after 1780 and certainly by 1785. According to Sir Pelham Warner, it was formed in 1782 as an offshoot from a West End convivial club called the Je-ne-sais-quoi, some of whose members frequented the White Conduit House in Islington and played matches on the neighbouring White Conduit Fields, which had been a prominent venue for cricket in the 1720s.Warner, p. 17.

Scorecards began to be kept on a regular basis from 1772; since then, an increasingly clear picture has emerged of the sport's development.Arthur Haygarth, Scores & Biographies, Volume 1 (1744\u20131826), Lillywhite, 1862"]}, {"page": "County Championship", "response": ["It was in the 1870s that newspapers began to print tables of inter-county results and then proclaim a champion on the basis of their chosen criteria.

This was a method that, in a modified form, permeated through to the official championship when one point was awarded for a win but one was deducted for a defeat. It was discontinued after 1909 as it was deemed to be inherently unsatisfactory and a points per win method replaced it in 1910."]}, {"page": "Forms of cricket", "response": ["The origin of the term \"first-class cricket\" is unknown but, along with other terms, it was used loosely for top-class eleven-a-side matches before it acquired its official status in 1894 (see above). Subsequently, at a meeting of the Imperial Cricket Conference (ICC) in May 1947, it was formally defined on a global basis. A key omission of both the MCC and ICC rulings was any attempt to define first-class cricket retrospectively and it was stipulated in the ICC ruling that the definition \"will not have retrospective effect\".Wisden 1948, p. 813. Many historians and statisticians have subjectively classified chosen pre-1895 matches as first-class but these are unofficial ratings and differences of opinion among the experts has led to variations in published cricket statistics. The main problem with \"first-class cricket\" is that it can be a misleading concept as it is essentially statistical and may typically ignore the historical aspect of a match if statistical information is missing, as is invariably the case with matches played up to 1825. Nevertheless, the recognition of any match as first-class by a substantial source qualifies it as such and it follows that the teams, venues and players involved in such matches before 1895 are the equivalent of first-class teams, venues and players since 1895. Substantial sources interested in 18th and 19th century cricket include Arthur Haygarth, F. S. Ashley-Cooper, H. T. Waghorn, G. B. Buckley, H. S. Altham, Roy Webber, John Arlott, Bill Frindall, the ACS and various internet sites (see Historical sources). Writing in 1951, Roy Webber drew a line between what is important historically and what should form part of the statistical record when he argued that the majority of matches prior to 1864 (i.e., the year in which overarm bowling was legalized) \"cannot be regarded as (statistically) first-class\" and their records are used \"for their historical associations\".Webber, pp. 9\u201310."]}, {"page": "Hit the ball twice", "response": ["The first definite record of a batsman being dismissed for hitting the ball twice occurred in the Hampshire v Kent match at Windmill Down on 13\u201315 July 1786.

The authorities include writers Harry Altham, John Arlott, Derek Birley, Arthur Haygarth, David Underdown, Roy Webber and Peter Wynne-Thomas. Their consensus view is that the only thing that can definitely be said about the origin of cricket is that its earliest record is in a late 16th-century court case in Surrey which proves it was played by children in southeast England in the middle of that century.Birley, p. 5.Major, p. 17.Underdown, p. 3. There have been alternative theories of origin but these have been dismissed or ignored by authorities. For example, the writer Andrew Lang claimed in 1912 that cricket evolved from a bat-and-ball game which may have been played in D\u00e1l Riata as early as the 6th century and this claim has been dismissed, by Anthony Bateman among others, in terms of \"Lang's idiosyncratic belief in the Celtic origin of cricket\". It is true that cricket is one of many bat-and-ball sports existing worldwide which have no known origin. Others are the definitely Celtic sports of hurling and shinty. Golf and hockey are other British ball games involving a club or stick while croquet was apparently imported from France and globally there are games such as Sweden's br\u00e4nnboll, Italy's lippa, India's gilli-danda, Finland's pes\u00e4pallo and Samoa's kilikiti. However, it is generally believed that cricket essentially belongs to the same family of bat-and-ball games as stoolball, rounders and baseball but whether it evolved from any of these, or vice versa, cannot be determined.Altham, p. 20. There is a 1523 reference to stoolball at a designated field in Oxfordshire; this may then have been a generic term for any game in which a ball is somehow hit with a bat or stick. 18th century references to stoolball in conjunction with cricket clearly indicate that it was a separate activity.McCann, pp. 37, 121 & 126."]}, {"page": "Billy Beldham", "response": ["In The Cricketers of My Time, Nyren eulogised Beldham's batting prowess: \"...(he was) safer than the Bank\"; \"...he would get at the balls and hit them away in gallant style.
