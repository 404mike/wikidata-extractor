Pat O'Malley. He also appeared on the Broadway stage in Ten Little Indians (1944) and Dial M for Murder (1954).The New York Times drama critic Theodore Goldsmith praised O'Malley's performance in Ten Little Indians, calling him \"a rara avis, a comedian who does not gauge the success of his efforts by the number of laughs he induces at each performance\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "February 27", "response": ["*  1985   \u2013 J.

The first episode involved the nearly 70-year-old Burns watching his younger neighbor's activities with amusement, just as he would watch the Burns and Allen television show while it was unfolding to get a jump on what Gracie was up to in its final two seasons. Again as in the Burns and Allen television show, George frequently broke the fourth wall by commenting directly to viewers. The series only lasted a year.

After winning the role of Bert, Van Dyke lobbied to also play the senior Mr. Dawes, but Disney originally felt he was too young for the part. Van Dyke eventually won Disney over after a screen test. Although he is fondly remembered for this film, Van Dyke's attempt at a Cockney accent is regarded as one of the worst film accents in history, cited as an example by actors since as something that they wish to avoid. In a 2003 poll by Empire magazine of the worst film accents of all time, he came in second. Van Dyke claims that his accent coach was the English (of Irish extraction) J. Pat O'Malley, who \"didn't do an accent any better than I did\". In 2017, Van Dyke was selected to receive an award for television excellence from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA), at which time he said \"I appreciate this opportunity to apologise to the members of BAFTA for inflicting on them the most atrocious cockney accent in the history of cinema.\" A chief executive of BAFTA responded, \"We look forward to his acceptance speech in whatever accent he chooses on the night.

Dunning writes that \"Cooper's pet hate was of 'acting' and he wanted [each story] related with a deadpan sense of 'here's how it happened.'\" Chappell usually took a conversational tone, relating the stories slowly and casually; he frequently played a specialist worker, giving Cooper a chance to add background details from his own earlier jobs as a soldier, gandy dancer or oil platform worker. Though supporting players were sparse, a group of New York radio veterans were heard on a frequent basis: as female characters, in male bit parts, or as the supernatural or otherworldly beings the ordinary Chappell character encounters. Most notably, radio star Claudia Morgan (longtime voice of Nora Charles on The Adventures of the Thin Man, and not coincidentally, Ernest Chappell's wife) was an occasional female lead, usually in tragic romances, and was heard in the final show (the appropriately titled \"Quiet, Please,\" a meditation on war and peace). In one lost show, \"Three Sides to a Story,\" Morgan's father Ralph Morgan was also a guest.\"Three Sides to a Story\" script. J. Pat O'Malley, later a familiar TV character actor, was another frequent voice, heard in more than a dozen shows throughout the run, beginning with the first broadcast \"Nothing Behind the Door.\"  He played foreman Ted in \"The Thing on the Fourbleboard\" and was often used in parts requiring Irish or Scottish accents.

David Bailey was originally cast as Mowgli, but his voice changed during production, leading Bailey to not fit the \"young innocence of Mowgli's character\" at which the producers were aiming. Thus director Wolfgang Reitherman cast his son Bruce, who had just voiced Christopher Robin in Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree. The animators shot footage of Bruce as a guide for the character's performance.
