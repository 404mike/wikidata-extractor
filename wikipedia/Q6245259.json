He reports the case of a Sheffield University student who had a measured IQ of 126 and passed a Mathematics Degree but who had hardly any discernible brain matter at all since his cortex was extremely reduced by hydrocephalus. The article led to the broadcast of a Yorkshire Television documentary of the same title, though it was about a different patient who had normal brain mass distributed in an unusual way in a very large skull.The skull had been enlarged by pressure from the hydrocephalus fluid. Her brain was thinly spread, but occupied her entire braincase, and its thickness was such that she had a brain volume of approximately 200 cm3. The woman had been told all her life that she had only 15% of normal brain mass, but those who told her this had not taken the form of her cranium into account.  Explanations were proposed for the first student's situation, with reviewers noting that Lorber's scans evidenced that the subject's brain mass was not absent, but compacted into the small space available, possibly compressed to a greater density than regular brain tissue."]}, {"page": "Lorber", "response": ["*John Lorber (1915\u20131996), ex-professor of paediatrics at the University of Sheffield"]}, {"page": "Robert Zachary", "response": ["Zachary was an expert on neonatal surgery, and campaigned for all surgery on newborns to be done by specifically trained paediatric surgeons. He developed an international reputation for his expertise on surgical management of spina bifida and hydrocephalus, and founded the Society for Research into Hydrocephalus and Spina Bifida. With paediatrician John Lorber and orthopaedic surgeon John Sharrard, Zachary showed that if babies with spina bifida were operated on within hours of birth, the survival rate could be improved from less than 10% to almost 90%. Zachary suffered from severe scoliosis and wrote of his connection with spina bifida patients: \"In my own small way I feel a common bond with all those who have spina bifida when I say, 'We who were born with a deformed spine...'\""]}, {"page": "Lorber, John", "response": ["#redirectJohn Lorber"]}]}}
