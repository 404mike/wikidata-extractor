His work was included in the first anthology of Imagist poetry, Des Imagistes, which was edited by Ezra Pound and published in 1914. He was a first cousin once removed of Edward Upward. His parents were George and Mary Upward, and he was survived by an elder sister (Mary) Edith Upward.Upward was brought up as a member of the Plymouth Brethren and trained as a lawyer at the Royal University of Dublin (now University College Dublin). While living in Dublin, he wrote a pamphlet in favour of Irish Home Rule.\nUpward later worked for the British Foreign Office in Kenya as a judge. Back in Britain, he defended Havelock Wilson and other labour leaders and ran for election as a Lib-Lab candidate, taking 659 votes in Merthyr at the 1895 general election.He wrote two books of poetry, Songs of Ziklag (1888) and Scented Leaves from a Chinese Jar. He also published a translation Sayings of Confucious and a volume of autobiography, Some Personalities (1921).\nUpward wrote a number of now-forgotten novels: The Prince of Balkistan (1895), A Crown of Straw (1896), A Bride's Madness (1897), The Accused Princess (1900) (source: Duncan, p. xii), \"''The International Spy: Being a Secret History of the Russo-Japanese War\" (1905), and Athelstane Ford. His 1910 novel \"The Discovery of the Dead\" is a collected fantasy (listed in Bleiler) dealing with the emerging science of Necrology.\nHis 1913 book The Divine Mystery is an anthropological study of Christian mythology.\nIn 1908, Upward self-published a book (originally written in 1901) which he apparently thought would be Nobel Prize material: The New Word. This book is today known as the first citation of the word \"Scientology\", however there was no delineation in this book of its definition by Upward. It is unknown whether L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of the Scientology-organization, knew of this book.\nIn 1917 the British Museum refused to take Upwards' manuscripts, \"on the grounds that the writer was still alive,\" and Upward burned them (source: Duncan, p. xi).\nHe shot himself in November 1926. Ezra Pound would a decade later satirically remark that this was due to his disappointment after hearing of George Bernard Shaw's Nobel Prize award which Shaw won in 1925.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of English-language poets", "response": ["*Allen Upward (1863\u20131926, E)"]}, {"page": "Ezra Pound", "response": ["The appearance of Des Imagistes, An Anthology (1914), edited by Pound, \"confirmed the importance\" of Imagisme, according to Ira Nadel.Nadel (2001), 2 Published in the American magazine The Glebe in February 1914 and the following month as a book, it was the first of five Imagist anthologies and the only one to contain work by Pound.Thacker (2018), 3 It included ten poems by Richard Aldington, seven by H.

Until then they were accepted as Bulgarians, but after the aggravation of the Bulgarian-Greek relations on the Macedonian question,  it was proved that the Macedonian Slavs were in fact Greeks, and that their language was not Bulgarian. The name Bulgarians also was taken out of use for them. At the time, the Greek researchers claimed that the Slavophones were simply Slavicized Greeks. This idea suggests that the Macedonian Slavs had lost their original Greek language and culture over the centuries, and it was time to them to return to their Hellenic roots. For the Greek audience the Macedonian Slavs were in historical aspect Ancient Macedonians (i.e. Greeks), not related to the Bulgarians. They were labelled as Bulgarian-speaking Greeks and even Slavic-speaking \"Macedonians\". For more see:  Tchavdar Marinov, \"Famous Macedonia, the Land of Alexander: Macedonian Identity at the Crossroads of Greek, Bulgarian and Serbian Nationalism\", In: Entangled Histories of the Balkans - Volume One, pp: 290\u2013291. Per Stamatiou, Karev presented himself as a voulgarofron, (i.e. Bulgarophile),The term means someone with pro-Bulgarian convictions. For its English translation see Philip Carabott, \"The Politics of Constructing the Ethnic 'Other': The Greek State and Its Slav-speaking Citizens, ca. 1912 - ca. 1949\", p. 151, Anastasia Karakasidou, \"The Slavo-Macedonian 'non-minority'\", p. 129, 153, n. 26 and Nada Boshkovska, Yugoslavia and Macedonia Before Tito: Between Repression and Integration (London/New York: I. B. Tauris, 2017), p. 8. and replied he was a Macedonian.Stamatis Stamatiou, From Bitola. Interview with a member of the Committee. In response to an ironic question by Stamatiou, Karev also claimed to be a \"direct descendant of Alexander the Great\".Tassos Kostopoulos compares Stamatiou's distrust towards Karev's self-presentation with the profession of a \"purely Macedonian consciousness\" of the Bulgarian Army colonel Anastas Yankov during his short passage through Greece on his way back from Macedonia to Bulgaria in December 1902, after the failed Gorna Dzhumaya Uprising, which, contrary to Karev's, was received cordially by Greek nationalists and taken at face value even by the most Slavophobe Greek newspapers. See Tassos Kostopoulos, Faire la police dans un pays etranger, pp. 5-6, n. 21. The opinion of Tasos contradicts the memoirs of Yankov where he describes his meetings with Greek nationalists, criticizing their fanaticism and anti-Bulgarian sentiments, and emphasizing his struggle for an autonomous Macedonia with freedom for all nationalities there. Yankov, refused any contacts with Greek reporters, describing them as spies and agents of the secret police. Per Tchavdar Marinov the manifesto issued by Anastas Yankov during the Gorna Dzhumaya Uprising promulgated only a specific \u201clocal Macedonian\u201d patriotism, a phenomenon that was described at the beginning of the twentieth century by foreign observers such as Henry Noel Brailsford and Allen Upward. They likewise noted the legend that Alexander the Great and Aristotle were \u201cBulgarians.\u201d Obviously, by the late Ottoman period, the ancient glory of the region was exploited for self-legitimation by groups with different loyalties\u2014Greek as well as Bulgarian. It was also generating a new identity that, during that period, was still not necessarily exclusive vis-\u00e0-vis Greek or Bulgarian national belonging. Marinov claims that people as Yankov, although Bulgarians by national identification and Macedonian supranationalist by political conviction, began to promote rarely the prognostics of some different ethnicity, which after the First World War were transformed into definitive Macedonian nationalism.

Tchavdar Marinov, \"Famous Macedonia, the Land of Alexander: Macedonian Identity at the Crossroads of Greek, Bulgarian and Serbian Nationalism\", In: Entangled Histories of the Balkans - Volume One, pp: 293\u2013294; 304.Per Eleftheria Vambakovska, the interview, contains contradictory claims and actually begins with an illogical claim. Karev asserts he is a Bulgarian-minded (\"Bulgarophron\"), and on the first question of the reporter: \"Are you a Macedonian\", he answers with \"yes\". The reporter and the Greek audience then, regarded Macedonia as a Greek territory and hence the people living here, according to them, must be Greeks and descendants of Alexander the Great. That's why he was so persistently trying to persuade Karev, that he is Macedonian, i.e. Greek. And if he was not a Greek, then he is \"Voulgarophron\", \"Bulgarized Macedonian\", etc. Otherwise, it is easy to see that the interview was adopted for the Greek readers in 1903. The interview begins with a question \"are you a Macedonian\"? that means Karev's ethnic origin was more important for the interviewer \u2013 whether he is a \"Macedonian\", which to the Greeks was a synonymous of a \"Greek\". Otherwise, to the Greeks \"Bulgarian-minded\" was not so important \u2013 the conviction is acquirable and it can by changed. \"Bulgarophron\", literally translated would mean \u2013 a man who thinks like all the Bulgarians. Per Macedonian prof. Ivan Katardzhiev the Macedonian separatism of some left-wing revolutionaries then was yet only political phenomenon, but without ethnic character and they all identified ethnically as Bulgarians. On the other hand, Dalibor Jovanovski, who surmises the interview was conducted by Ion Dragoumis, the Greek deputy consul at Bitola, states that \"[i]n the interview, Karev stressed that he is Macedonian, not Bulgarian\".

In 1898, the historian William Miller argued about Gladstone's proclamation and his motto, that this idea is not practical because there was no Macedonian nation and the whole difficulty in this country is that it is a mixture of different warring nationalities. By that reason per Allen Upward that phrase could not have been used by anybody, who had a first hand knowledge of that country.Allen Upward, The East End of Europe, 1908: The Report of an Unofficial Mission to the European Provinces of Turkey on the Eve of the Revolution, pp. pp. 25-27."]}]}}
