The signing of defender Martin McDonnell led to a temporary improvement, but another poor run in the new year left the club facing relegation. Once again, the club had to spend their way out of danger; the signing of Bryn Allen and Ken Chisholm inspired a successful last eight games and a mid-table finish. By contrast, the following season started very well and the club were top of Division Two table at Christmas. They made several expensive signings, including full-back Terry Springthorpe and striker Tommy Briggs, but these players had no impact at the club and a run of poor performance in the new year ended their promotion hopes. Despite a reasonable start to the 1951\u201352 season, this poor form resumed from September as an ageing City team \u2013 the average was 31 years \u2013 faced almost certain relegation by February.
