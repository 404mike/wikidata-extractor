In more recent times, Paul Tait scored the first golden goal to decide a Wembley cup final, against Carlisle United in the 1995 Football League Trophy. Geoff Horsfield scored the extra-time equaliser that took the 2002 First Division play-off final into a shootout; Paul Devlin and Stan Lazaridis converted their spot-kicks as Birmingham were promoted to the Premier League for the first time. Seven men listed here, including captain Stephen Carr and goalscorer Nikola \u017digi\u0107, took the field as Birmingham won the 2011 League Cup; another two were unused substitutes.

Others from the Football Alliance side included the versatile Bernard Pumfrey and George Short, and the long-serving Charlie Simms, who was by 1892 employed as the first-team trainer, but retained his playing registration for emergencies. Among the newcomers were back Fred Jones from Newton Heath, forward Harry Edwards, signed from Singer's of Coventry,Matthews, Complete Record, pp. 124, 141. and centre-forward Frank Mobley, who joined soon after the start of the season, also from Singer's.

The visit to Sheffield United proved less productive. The home side opened the scoring early on, and \"only good half-back and back play by the visitors prevented the United greatly increasing the lead\". In the second half, with \"a brilliant sun shining in the faces of their opponents\", the play was more even, and Jack Hallam came close to equalising, but Sheffield United made the score 2\u20130 three minutes from time, when Harry Hammond ran through the Small Heath defence and scored with a \"magnificent shot\".", "Small Heath fielded eight of their regular starting eleven in a friendly against First Division Nottingham Forest. A close and exciting game, which featured \"both goal-keepers displaying wonderful cleverness and resource\", was won by Forest with a late goal. In their first competitive fixture of the month, the quarter-final of the Birmingham Cup, they beat Wednesbury Old Athletic, a team from the Birmingham & District League, by five goals to nil in a match \"characterised by a good deal of rough play\". A \"fairly strong\" team suffered a rare home defeat in a friendly against Middlesbrough of the Northern League. Jack Hallam appeared to score in the first half, but the referee disallowed the goal, having spotted that Hallam had knocked the ball in with hand rather than head, and Middlesbrough went on to score twice without reply in the second period.", "Small Heath went through the season unbeaten at Coventry Road. In the League, they scored 90 goals, at a rate of more than 4 goals per game, and all five first-choice forwards reached double figures. The leading scorer was Fred Wheldon, with 25 goals from the 22 League fixtures and 1 in the test match, a total which made him the top scorer for the Second Division.

Former Small Heath full-back Tom Bayley was one of several newcomers for the hosts, but their visitors had few changes in personnel. Teddy Jolley came in at full-back, and replacing Billy Walton was Jack Lee, who \"dribbles cleverly, and is a very dangerous forward round goal\". In the presence of 4,000 spectators, Lee scored twice as Small Heath won 3\u20131. Fred Wheldon opened the scoring for Small Heath in the first 30\u00a0seconds of their next match, at home to Rotherham Town; 15\u00a0minutes later the visitors were 3\u20132 ahead, but by half-time the home side had regained the lead. Unsurprisingly the tempo dropped in the second half, but a game played in a \"friendly and sportsmanlike spirit\" was marred towards the end by Rotherham forward Alf Pickering suffering a fracture of his right leg just below the knee in an accidental collision with Bernard Pumfrey, \"the snap of the bone being heard all round the ground\". Initial reports suggested the break was such that he was \"almost certain\" never to play football again. This was followed by a comfortable 6\u20131 defeat of Burton Swifts, in which Jolley moved to inside right in Jack Hallam's absence through illness, giving Gilbert Smith his debut at full back.", "Changes were made for the visit of Middlesbrough Ironopolis, Arthur Littleford, Charles Izon and Bernard Pumfrey coming in for Smith, Mobley and Jack Hallam. The half-backs were again the backbone of the team, and Wheldon, who produced \"a brilliant exposition of dodging and shooting\", scored the winning goal five minutes from time in what the Standard's reporter described as a \"rattling good game\". Fred Speller was reported to have \"not been seen in such form since his leg was broken last year\" in a Boxing Day friendly with top amateur club Marlow, the club from which he signed for Small Heath. Their last League match of 1893, a comfortable 6\u20130 victory against Lincoln City, took them into the new year in second place in the division, three points ahead of Notts County but two points behind Liverpool, who had played two fewer matches. Pumfrey strengthened the defence, George Hollis was as usual secure in goal, and the forwards, with the returning Mobley and the introduction of reserve-team player Walter Jackson, \"showed better combination and greater dash than they have recently done\".", "Against Stoke in the United Counties League, Jack Hallam opened the scoring after a fine passing move as Small Heath won 3\u20130. In the return fixture, Charles Partridge's \"magnificent performance\" in goal kept the score down to a 2\u20131 defeat, as Small Heath finished third in the four-team division.", "The Leicester Chronicle felt that Darwen would have to \"play up\" to stand much chance against Small Heath, who had \"a smarter set of forwards than can be found amongst most of the first division teams\", and pointed out that Small Heath were the only team in either division to have scored 100 goals during the season. The players prepared for the test match at Droitwich Spa, where the saturated salt water of the Brine Baths provided relief for tired muscles. The match, played at Stoke's Victoria Ground, was an exciting one. Darwen had much the best of the first half, but failed to take their chances. Small Heath were restricted to rare attacks, but were dangerous on the break, and opened the scoring through Jack Hallam. Darwen equalised before the interval, and continued their dominance until superior fitness told. With six minutes left, Small Heath took the lead, the goal variously attributed to Wheldon or an Orr own goal, after which Darwen lost heart and Tommy Hands scored again four minutes later. The Daily Post suggested that \"one would scarcely believe that they were the same five forwards who have so often delighted the spectators with their play at Coventry Road\", but \"to every man [of the defence] great praise is due for so ably checking the opposing forwards\". The Nottinghamshire Guardian was less critical of the forwards, but took the view that Small Heath were fortunate to catch Darwen \"in a very crippled condition\", and that goalkeeper Chris Charsley had done the club a considerable service in making himself available for such a vital game."]}, {"page": "1894\u201395 Small Heath F.C. season", "response": ["Small Heath's First Division campaign began on Saturday 1\u00a0September with a visit to local rivals and League champions Aston Villa, which turned out rather closer than predicted.

The Birmingham Daily Post picked out Hallam and Caesar Jenkyns for praise, was disappointed by Fred Wheldon, \"usually the bright particular star of the front rank\", and suggested that Jack Oliver would be a success \"when he has lost a little superfluous flesh\".", "In contrast, Small Heath put on \"a very indifferent display\" in losing 4\u20131 at West Bromwich Albion. They scored twice, very much against the run of play, to come back from 2\u20130 down to beat Stoke 4\u20132, and their good fortune continued at Bolton Wanderers.

Unfortunately for the charities, the weather was poor and the attendance low, but those spectators present saw an exciting game. Wheldon scored first with a fierce shot that entered the net off the goalkeeper and the underside of the bar, then Bob Chatt equalised from a free kick and Charlie Athersmith outpaced Oliver and his parried shot was forced over the line. Mobley tied the scores with a long shot, but in the second half with the wind behind them, Villa scored three times to Jack Hallam's one to take the match 5\u20133."]}, {"page": "1895\u201396 Small Heath F.C. season", "response": ["With Joe Fall still unavailable because of an injury sustained in pre-season training, Charles Partridge was replaced in goal by reserve Jim Roach, who made an eventful debut at local rivals Aston Villa.

On change of ends, the balance of play tilted towards the visitors, but the match still finished 7\u20133. Fall returned to fitness for Small Heath's third defeat of the season, at home to Stoke in a game characterised by excessive foul play.

The committee experimented with their team selection for the first Alliance match of the season, at home to Burton Swifts, Fred Speller moving up from full back to partner Jack Hallam on the right side of the forward line. Small Heath took an early lead through a combination of Frederick Wilkes and Hallam, but Burton, showing more skill than the home forwards, equalised in the first half. After the interval, Hallam scored after Wilkes' shot was parried, then Wilkes himself made the final score 3\u20131.The Alliance. Small Heath v. Burton. Birmingham Daily Post. p. 7. 7 September 1891.
