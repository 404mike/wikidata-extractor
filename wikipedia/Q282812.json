He also was on the books at Premier League teams Tottenham Hotspur, Wigan Athletic and Fulham but failed to make an appearance for either. He spent the rest of his career in the Football League with Grimsby Town, Wolverhampton Wanderers, Portsmouth, Bradford City and Brighton & Hove Albion as well as with Non-league sides Edgware Town and North Greenford United He played in Wimbledon's 1988 FA Cup victory, during which he became the first goalkeeper to save a penalty in an FA Cup final and the first goalkeeper since 1875 to lift the cup as captain of the winning team. He made two appearances for the England national football team. On 10 May 2015, Beasant became the oldest individual to be selected in the squad for a match in Football League history while representing Stevenage as a substitute against Southend United in the League Two Play-Off semi-final second leg, at the age of 56.\nSince retiring, Beasant has worked as a goalkeeping coach for Fulham, Norhern Ireland, the Glenn Hoddle Academy, Bristol Rovers, Stevenage and Reading.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1990 FIFA World Cup", "response": ["Squads for the 1990 World Cup consisted of 22 players, as for the previous tournament in 1986.

Membership of WOPA is open to all former Wimbledon F.C. and AFC Wimbledon players and managers. Among the sixty founding members were Glenn Mulcaire, who scored AFC Wimbledon's first ever goal in 2002 and Kevin Cooper, who remains the club's all-time highest goal scorer with 107 goals between August 2002 and May 2004, as well as retaining the title for the most goals scored in a season with 66 during 2003\u201304.

Taylor immediately went into the first-team, replacing Dave Beasant, and made his debut on 11 January in a 1\u20130 victory at Middlesbrough. During his first season at Southampton, the team struggled near the foot of the table, missing relegation by one point, having been in last place with five matches to play.Holley & Chalk, In That Number. p.\u00a0250."]}, {"page": "Bruce Grobbelaar", "response": ["Grobbelaar left Liverpool in mid-1994, transferring on a free to Southampton. He made his debut on 20 August 1994 in the 1\u20131 league draw with Blackburn Rovers at The Dell. He spent two seasons with the Saints competing with another goalkeeper with a reputation for eccentricity, Dave Beasant.  Despite the fuss caused by the match-fixing allegations (see below), manager Alan Ball maintained faith in him, and he kept his place in the team for most of the 1994\u201395 season."]}, {"page": "Wimbledon F.C.", "response": ["Many observers tipped Wimbledon to go straight back down in 1986\u201387, but after losing the first game of the season away at Manchester City, Wimbledon won the next four games to perch atop the league table on 1 September. Wimbledon eventually finished sixth, before Dave Bassett moved on to Watford. His successor was Bristol Rovers manager Bobby Gould. Dubbed \"The Crazy Gang\" because of the eccentric behaviour of its players, fans and chairman, Sam Hammam, the club's greatest moment came in 1988 when, very much against expectation, the team won the FA Cup, beating overwhelming favourites Liverpool 1\u20130 with a goal from Lawrie Sanchez. 37,000 Wimbledon fans witnessed captain Dave Beasant becoming the first goalkeeper to save a penalty in an FA Cup final, stopping John Aldridge's shot. The only downside of this triumph was the fact that the club would not be able to compete in the European Cup Winners' Cup, as the ban on English teams from European competition following the Heysel Stadium Disaster was still in operation at this time."]}, {"page": "Corner kick", "response": ["In a 1983\u201384 English Third Division match, Millwall were incorrectly credited with a goal against Wimbledon rather than a corner, when Wally Downes' free-kick backpass eluded an off-guard Dave Beasant. In a 2002\u201303 FA Premier League match, Birmingham City scored when Olof Mellberg's throw-in backpass was missed by Aston Villa goalkeeper Peter Enckelman, who reacted with dismay but later claimed he had made no contact and the goal should not have been awarded. His reaction may have persuaded referee David Elleray that Enckelman had grazed the ball; manager Graham Taylor suggested it showed he was unaware of the corner rule, a charge Enckelman denied."]}, {"page": "Mark Crossley", "response": ["He was granted a testimonial match during the 1999\u20132000 season by Nottingham Forest, which was played in front of 15,000 supporters. During that season, Crossley found himself on the bench numerous times, playing second choice 'keeper to Dave Beasant. He was finally released from Forest, in 2000 as the club's financial troubles required them to reduce the wage bill."]}, {"page": "Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi", "response": ["Following impressive performances for both club and country, he moved to English club Portsmouth, signing for a club record \u00a31.8m. However, he struggled to adapt to life in the English Football League, and struggled with the physical side of the First Division, notably in a 3\u20131 away defeat to Grimsby Town. Kawaguchi lost his place to veteran Dave Beasant after being held responsible for Portsmouth's 4\u20131 home defeat to underdogs Leyton Orient in the FA Cup. Despite his poor performances for Pompey he remained something of a cult hero with the fans, on account of his cheerful demeanour, and his insistence that he would work hard to regain his place. After a season of playing reserve team football, he made his final appearance for Portsmouth in the final game of the 2002\u201303 Football League First Division championship winning season, coming on at half time to a standing ovation in the 5\u20130 win against Bradford City."]}, {"page": "John Aldridge", "response": ["Aldridge scored both goals in the club's FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest, including a memorable volley from an outstanding team move. He was also an efficient penalty-taker, but a predictable one too, which led to his season and that of Liverpool ending in a loss. With Wimbledon 1\u20130 up in the final at Wembley, midway through the second half, Liverpool were awarded a spot kick when Aldridge himself was fouled. Wimbledon goalkeeper Dave Beasant had anticipated that Aldridge would strike any penalty given in the FA Cup final to his left as Aldridge had gone that way with every one of his kicks that season, never failing to score. Aldridge did, as predicted, place the penalty to Beasant's left, and the keeper sprang across to save it. He became the first keeper to save a penalty in the FA Cup final at Wembley. Aldridge's failure was his first penalty miss for Liverpool. He was substituted shortly afterwards as Liverpool lost 1\u20130."]}, {"page": "Georgi Kinkladze", "response": ["Manchester City's form was poor during the 1995\u201396 season. The team failed to win a single league game in the first three months of the season, but Kinkladze quickly became a popular figure. Kinkladze's first goal for the club occurred in a 1\u20130 win against Aston Villa, following a one-two with Niall Quinn. Kinkladze was initially homesick, as he was living in a hotel and spoke little English.Blue Moon Rising, p. 97. In an effort to resolve his homesickness, his mother moved to Manchester to provide him with familiar food. By the time Manchester City travelled to Middlesbrough on 9 December 1995, press and supporters regarded Kinkladze as the star player of the Manchester City side.Blue Moon Rising, p. 101. \"With Rosler badly out-of-sorts, it was Kinkladze who quickly became a terrace hero, an icon for fans who needed something to grasp on to.\" The match against Middlesbrough was billed as a contest between Kinkladze and the Brazilian playmaker Juninho. Kinkladze scored the opening goal with a solo effort, but the match ended 4\u20131 to Middlesbrough. However, the Middlesbrough fans subsequently voted Kinkladze the \"Best Opposing Player of the Season\".Kinkladze: The Perfect 10?, pp. 59\u201360. On 16 March 1996, Kinkladze scored a particularly spectacular goal in a 2\u20131 win against Southampton. Kinkladze beat five players before chipping the ball over Southampton goalkeeper Dave Beasant. The goal won BBC programme Match of the Day's \"Goal of the Month\", and placed second in the programme's \"Goal of the Season\" competition."]}, {"page": "Lawrie Sanchez", "response": ["His most famous moment as a player came in 1988, when he scored with a header the goal that won Wimbledon the FA Cup in 1988 against Liverpool. It was not an easy game, as Peter Beardsley had found the net 10 minutes before Sanchez scored, only to have his goal disallowed. Liverpool came close to jeopardising Wimbledon's dream again in the second half when they were awarded a penalty, only for John Aldridge's shot to be saved by Dons goalkeeper Dave Beasant."]}, {"page": "Crazy Gang (football)", "response": ["The name originated in the immediate aftermath of Wimbledon's 1988 FA Cup final victory over Liverpool, when BBC commentator John Motson declared that \"the crazy gang has beaten the culture club\". Most closely associated with the team of that period, notable members included Vinnie Jones, Dennis Wise, Dave Beasant, John Fashanu and Lawrie Sanchez. Under the management of Dave Bassett, they climbed from the Fourth Division to the First Division in four seasons leading up to 1986 without ever changing their straightforward playing style."]}]}}
