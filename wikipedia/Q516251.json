The band considered several possible replacements, including Aynsley Dunbar (who was playing with Frank Zappa at the time), and decided on former Plastic Ono Band drummer Alan White, a friend of Anderson and Offord who had once sat in with the band weeks before Bruford's departure. White learned the band's repertoire in three days before embarking on their 1972\u20131973 tour. By this point, Yes were beginning to enjoy worldwide commercial and critical success.

While never producing a hit of their own, the band has been influential as an incubator for British rock and blues musicians. Many of the best known bands to come out of Britain in the 1960s and 1970s had members that came through the Bluesbreakers at one time, forming the foundation of British blues music that is still played heavily on classic rock radio.  Among those with a tenure in the Bluesbreakers are Eric Clapton and Jack Bruce (both later of Cream), Peter Green, Mick Fleetwood, and John McVie (the three of whom would form Fleetwood Mac), Mick Taylor (the Rolling Stones), Aynsley Dunbar (Frank Zappa and The Mothers of Invention), Jon Hiseman, Dick Heckstall-Smith and Tony Reeves (these three would form Colosseum), and numerous others.

After the tour ended, Cozy Powell parted ways with the band. According to Coverdale, the relationship between him and Powell had deteriorated increasingly over the course of the tour. After the final show, Coverdale flew to Los Angeles to meet with Geffen Records to inform them that he was letting the rest of the band go. Coverdale claims that he was persuaded to keep Sykes involved (as Geffen felt they had a \"strong image together\"), while he changed his mind about Murray. Powell, meanwhile, was fired. Conversely, Neil Murray insists that Powell left over money disputes. In any case, Coverdale and Sykes then retreated to the South of France in early 1985 to begin writing the band's next album. The sessions proved fruitful and they were later joined by Murray, who helped with the arrangements. The new material saw Whitesnake moving further away from their bluesier roots in favour of a more American hard rock sound. John Kalodner also convinced Coverdale to re-record two songs from the Saints & Sinners album, \"Here I Go Again\" and \"Crying in the Rain\", which he thought had great potential with better production and arranging. With new material ready, the band then began searching for a new drummer. A reported sixty drummers auditioned for the group, with prolific session drummer Aynsley Dunbar eventually being chosen. Former Ozzy Osbourne drummer Tommy Aldridge was also offered the spot, but the two parties couldn't come to a satisfactory agreement. Drummer Carmine Appice also claims to have turned down the spot due to commitments with his own band King Kobra at the time. Incidentally, Appice would later join Sykes in Blue Murder.", "By the time the album was finished, Coverdale was left as the sole remaining member of Whitesnake. Coverdale has maintained that as he was recovering from surgery, Sykes and Mike Stone began conspiring against him by booking studio time and making decisions without his involvement. Stone allegedly suggested bringing in someone else to record Coverdale's vocals. Sykes, meanwhile, has claimed that he and the other band members were systematically fired as soon as they finished recording their respective parts. Neil Murray claimed that Sykes wanted more control over the band, which ultimately led to his departure. Adrian Vandenberg recalled in an interview with Eddie Trunk how Sykes came to the studio to confront Coverdale after being informed he was out of the band. According to Murray, he and Aynsley Dunbar stopped receiving their wages in April 1986, at which point Dunbar immediately left the group. Murray was still officially a member of Whitesnake until January 1987, when he heard Coverdale was putting together a new line-up. With the help of John Kalodner, Coverdale recruited Adrian Vandenberg and Tommy Aldridge, as well as guitarist Vivian Campbell (formerly of Dio) and bassist Rudy Sarzo (formerly of Quiet Riot). This new line-up would appear in all the promotional materials for the forthcoming album. Whitesnake also adopted a new look, akin to glam metal bands of the time, in order to appeal more to American audiences. When asked about the band's makeover, Coverdale responded: \"I'm competing with people like Jon Bon Jovi. I've gotta look the part.\" Due to the prolonged recording process, Coverdale claims to have been three million dollars in debt at the time of the album's release."]}, {"page": "Ronnie James Dio", "response": ["After divorcing Berardi, in 1978 he married Wendy Walters (born 1945), ex-wife of drummer Aynsley Dunbar (m. 1966) and guitarist Ricardo Gaxiola (m. 1972, div. 1977), who also served as his manager.
