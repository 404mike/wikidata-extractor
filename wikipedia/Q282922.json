Back learned of the river from local guides, and throughout his memoir of the expedition he referred to the river as the \"Thlew-ee-cho-dezeth\", which he translated as \"Great Fish River\". Later 19th-century explorers habitually referred to the river as \"Back's Great Fish River\", but gradually this was shortened to \"Back River\" over time."]}, {"page": "List of explorers", "response": ["| George Back"]}]}}
