He was born in Laisterdyke, Bradford. He wrote 39 books using the name W. Riley, mostly fiction and mostly published by Herbert Jenkins Ltd.\n\nAfter an education at Bradford Grammar School he entered his father's business in textiles, but two years later the firm diversified and William led the innovative new business in the sale of magic lantern slides and equipment. The business was successful until 1914, when, with the onset of World War I, it failed: Riley then developed a second career as a writer, having already published Windyridge.:\u200a50\u201351,\u200a108\u2013109\u200aHis first novel Windyridge was written as a series of weekly chapters, in the winter of early 1911, to entertain his wife and two friends, the Bolton sisters, whose parents and third sister had all recently died. He quotes himself as saying \"I tell you what I'll do, I'll write a story and read each chapter to you as I go along, week by week. It may help to keep us from brooding\".:\u200a98\u200a The story is set in the village of Hawksworth near Baildon. He completed the tale in early 1912, having paused in his writing over the summer, and was persuaded to submit it for publication. He agreed to send it to just one publishing house, and chose this by writing on slips of paper the names of three established houses and the novice publisher Herbert Jenkins. It was this last slip which he selected, and Jenkins agreed to publish the book, as his firm's first publication.:\u200a101\u20132\u200aIn 1919 he moved to Silverdale, Lancashire for the sake of his wife's health, and named his house Windyridge after his novel.  In his autobiography, Sunset Reflections (1957), he recalls tales of life in Silverdale, where amongst other activities he was chair of the Building Committee for the Gaskell Memorial Hall.:\u200a154\u2013158\u200aBradford University Library's Special Collections department holds an archive of Willie Riley's manuscripts and other papers and a collection of his books.His death was recorded in obituaries in The Times and other local and national newspapers. He was buried in the village graveyard at Silverdale, along with his first wife Clara.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1912 in literature", "response": ["*Willie Riley \u2013 Windyridge"]}, {"page": "Silverdale, Lancashire", "response": ["* The Yorkshire-born English novelist Willie Riley (1866 - 1961) moved to Silverdale in 1919 and named his house Windyridge, the title of his first novel."]}, {"page": "William Riley", "response": ["William, Bill, Billy, or Willie Riley may refer to:", "*Willie Riley (1866\u20131961), British author"]}, {"page": "Windy Ridge", "response": ["*Windyridge, a 1912 novel by Willie Riley"]}, {"page": "Bradford", "response": ["Bradford features under the name of \"Broadbeck\" in the best-selling 1912 novel Windyridge by Bradford novelist Willie Riley."]}, {"page": "Herbert George Jenkins", "response": ["In 1912 Jenkins founded his own publishing company: Herbert Jenkins Limited. Its offices were in a narrow, 19th-century building with five floors in Duke of York Street, just off Jermyn Street in London. It was a successful business from the start because of Jenkins' unique ability (at the time) to cater for the ever-changing public taste. He also had a good eye for new talent, not being discouraged if a manuscript had been rejected by other publishers. His publicity methods were innovative, too; with arresting advertisements and dust jackets, and a monthly publication called Wireless, which was widely circulated among his readers. Jenkins' first publication was Willie Riley's first novel Windyridge, and the firm went on to publish most of Riley's 39 books, ending with The Man and the Mountain in 1961, the year of Riley's death. In 1915 Jenkins published  A. S. Neill's first book, A Dominie's Log, launching his career as a famous teacher and writer of books on education. Herbert Jenkins Ltd published many of P. G.
