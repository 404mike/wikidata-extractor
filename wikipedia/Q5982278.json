He then joined Rangers in 1973 where, for reasons not fully known they decided to play him as more of a midfielder rather than striker as he had been with Pollok, meaning he never replicated his high scoring at senior level. A two-year stay at Dundee followed in 1977 before brief spells with Berwick Rangers and Albion Rovers.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1973\u201374 Rangers F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\" | Ian McDougall"]}, {"page": "1974\u201375 Rangers F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\" | Ian McDougall"]}, {"page": "1975\u201376 Rangers F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\" | Ian McDougall"]}, {"page": "1976\u201377 Rangers F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\" | Ian McDougall"]}, {"page": "Ian McDougall", "response": ["Ian McDougall may refer to:", "* Ian McDougall (geologist) (1935\u20132018), Australian scientist", "* Ian McDougall (musician) (born 1938), Canadian composer and trombonist", "* Ian McDougall (producer) (1945\u20132010), Canadian television producer", "* Ian McDougall (footballer) (born 1954), Scottish footballer", "* Ian McDougall (architect), Australian architect"]}]}}
