It was he who articulated the notion that human beings hardly ever speak in explicit terms among each other about their deepest emotions, that the great, tragic, climactic moments are often happening beneath outwardly trivial conversation.\" Martin Esslin, from Text and Subtext in Shavian Drama, in 1922: Shaw and the last Hundred Years, ed. Bernard. F. Dukore, Penn State Press, 1994, , 200. The Group Theatre, in particular, developed the subtextual approach to drama, influencing generations of American playwrights, screenwriters, and actors, including Clifford Odets, Elia Kazan and, in particular, Lee Strasberg. In turn, Strasberg's Actors Studio and the \"Method\" acting approach influenced many actors, including Marlon Brando and Robert De Niro, though by then the Chekhov tradition may have been distorted by a preoccupation with realism.\"Lee Strasberg became in my opinion a victim of the traditional idea of Chekhovian theatre\u00a0... [he left] no room for Chekhov's imagery.\" Georgii Tostonogov on Strasberg's production of Three Sisters in The Drama Review (winter 1968), quoted by Styan, 121.

Esslin noted that many of these playwrights demonstrated the philosophy better than did the plays by Sartre and Camus. Though most of such playwrights, subsequently labeled \"Absurdist\" (based on Esslin's book), denied affiliations with existentialism and were often staunchly anti-philosophical (for example Ionesco often claimed he identified more with 'Pataphysics or with Surrealism than with existentialism), the playwrights are often linked to existentialism based on Esslin's observation.Kernan, Alvin B.

The Absurd in these plays takes the form of man's reaction to a world apparently without meaning, and/or man as a puppet controlled or menaced by invisible outside forces. Though the term is applied to a wide range of plays, some characteristics coincide in many of the plays: broad comedy, often similar to vaudeville, mixed with horrific or tragic images; characters caught in hopeless situations forced to do repetitive or meaningless actions; dialogue full of clich\u00e9s, wordplay, and nonsense; plots that are cyclical or absurdly expansive; either a parody or dismissal of realism and the concept of the \"well-made play\"."]}, {"page": "Samuel Beckett", "response": ["Beckett's multi-faceted work offers a bleak, tragi-comic outlook on existence and experience, often coupled with black comedy and nonsense.

These plays\u2014which are often considered, rightly or wrongly, to have been instrumental in the so-called \"Theatre of the Absurd\"\u2014deal in a darkly humorous way with themes similar to those of the roughly contemporary existentialist thinkers. The term \"Theatre of the Absurd\" was coined by Martin Esslin in a book of the same name; Beckett and Godot were centrepieces of the book. Esslin argued these plays were the fulfilment of Albert Camus's concept of \"the absurd\";Esslin (1969). this is one reason Beckett is often falsely labelled as an existentialist (this is based on the assumption that Camus was an existentialist, though he in fact broke off from the existentialist movement and founded his own philosophy).

Lucky speaks only once in the play and it is in response to Pozzo's order to \"think\" for Estragon and Vladimir. Pozzo and Lucky have been together for sixty years. The ostensibly abstract philosophical meanderings supplied to the audience by Lucky during his speech has been described as \"a flood of completely meaningless gibberish\" by Martin Esslin in his essay, \"The Theatre of the Absurd\". Esslin suggests that this seemingly involuntary, philosophical spouting is an example of the actor's working \"against the dialogue rather than with it\", providing grounds for Esslin's claims that the \"fervor of delivery\" in the play, must \"stand in a dialectical contrast to the pointlessness of the meaning of the lines\". Beckett's advice to the American director Alan Schneider was: \"[Pozzo] is a hypomaniac and the only way to play him is to play him mad.\"", "Martin Esslin, in his The Theatre of the Absurd (1960), argued that Waiting for Godot was part of a broader literary movement that he called the Theatre of the Absurd, a form of theatre that stemmed from the absurdist philosophy of Albert Camus. Absurdism itself is a branch of the traditional assertions of existentialism, pioneered by S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, and posits that, while inherent meaning might very well exist in the universe, human beings are incapable of finding it due to some form of mental or philosophical limitation. Thus, humanity is doomed to be faced with the Absurd, or the absolute absurdity of the existence in lack of intrinsic purpose.Ball, J.

He had close ties with modernism because of his friendship with James Joyce; however, his work helped shape the development of literature away from modernism. Joyce, one of the exemplars of modernism, celebrated the possibility of language; Beckett had a revelation in 1945 that, in order to escape the shadow of Joyce, he must focus on the poverty of language and man as a failure.
