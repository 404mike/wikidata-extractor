Yei, encouraged by the success of a popular Japanese fairy tale series like those of Hasegawa Takejir\u014d, began to write down smaller stories and to translate Japanese fairy tales. Some of these were accepted for publication by English magazines, including The Wide World Magazine, The Girl's Realm of London, and its sister magazine, The Lady's Realm between 1900 to 1902. Her first major work, The Japanese Fairy Book (1903-1908) were published in October 1903, reprinted in 1904, 1906 & 1908, published in London by Kelly & Walsh. As a collection of Japanese fairy tales were not translated from formal Japanese language, but were reworded by her in everyday language for children, ensuring their popularity in Anglophone countries. In 1908 Kelly & Walsh published Buddha's Crystal and Other Fairy Stories, followed in 1909 by Warriors of Old Japan and Other Stories at Constable in London with an introduction by John Harington Gubbins.

In August Vice-Admiral Sir Gerard Noel, Commander-in-Chief of the China Station, wrote to Sir Claude Maxwell MacDonald, the first British ambassador to Japan, seeking the services of a \u2018suitable and reliable Instructor in the Japanese language for service with the British China Squadron\u2019, possibly a \u2018suitable retired Japanese Naval Officer, who has perhaps been wounded in the war and would be glad of a little financial assistance\u2019. In February 1905, Macdonald replied to Noel to say that Baron Komura Jutar\u014d, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, had been unable to find a suitable person.The National Archives, ADM 1/7728: Admiralty Circular Letter (printed) of 10 June 1904 (7200/1904); Noel to MacDonald, 5 August 1904; MacDonald to Noel, 11 February 1905. By this time Tuck was living in Japan and studying the language full-time, although he was finding the expenses involved much greater than he had expected.The National Archives, ADM 1/7728: Tuck to Captain Stoppard, 18 January 1905; Gubbins to MacDonald, 10 January 1904 [sic: 1905]. Later in 1905 Sir Claude  MacDonald instructed John Harington Gubbins, who had been Japanese Secretary in the British Legation for many years and had a good command of Japanese, to examine Tuck on his knowledge of Japanese. Gubbins reported in September that Tuck had gained full marks in colloquial and more than 75% for each of the two written papers, and that he had a good knowledge of Chinese characters. \u2018A little further study of newspapers, and a course of instruction in what is known as official dispatch style, would, I think, enable Mr. Tuck to attain the standard required for interpreters in the Japan Consular Service', he concluded. In December Tuck received a certificate stating that he had passed the examination for Interpreter in Japanese and a few days later received appointment as Interpreter in Japanese on HMS King Alfred.Tuck Papers 2/5. In February 1906 Vice-Admiral Noel wrote to Tuck and forwarded to him extracts from an Admiralty letter dated 25 October 1905, which stated that \u2018it would be a convenience if the services of Mr. Oswald Tuck could be utilized in connection with the instruction in the Japanese language of Naval Officers on the China Station, having regard to his special qualifications for such work\u2019. And in 1907 the Admiralty wrote to express their appreciation for Tuck's translation of a diary by a Russian officer serving  on the Russian battleship Oryol.Tuck Papers 2/5. It was clear that Tuck's command of Japanese was now appreciated by the Admiralty."]}]}}
