A significant strength of the collection are British coins from all ages, which have benefited from the ancient law of Treasure Trove.  This has enabled the museum to purchase important hoards of gold and silver coins, many of which were buried during periods of crisis or upheaval. There are approximately 9,000 coins, medals and banknotes on display around the British Museum.

In consequence Edward Hawkins, Provost of Oriel, declined to admit him as a college tutor, and he therefore accepted a curacy at Alphington, a parish recently separated from that of Ottery St Mary, the home of his family, where his father had built for him a house and school.

Along with Copleston he contributed to the \"liberal Tory\" strand of the debate on the poor laws. Davidson, with Coplestone and Whately, formed a group in the Noetics of political economists in the sense of Robert Malthus."]}, {"page": "Albany James Christie", "response": ["Initially Christie was in favour with the Noetics at Oriel. Over the summer 1838 he was occupied with editorial work on the Library of the Fathers, an Oxford Movement project of E. B. Pusey. This was in a house in St Aldate's, Oxford, shared with James Mozley and Mark Pattison, as well as his brother. As a Fellow Christie worked on the church history of Claude Fleury, with John Henry Newman. Then in 1843 he turned to Ambrose and his work De virginitate, which with other factors aroused suspicion that he had Catholic sympathies. Edward Hawkins, Provost of Oriel, acted on the disquiet of others to put pressure on Christie, often absent from the college. By 1844 it was made clear to Christie that he would not have a recommendation from Hawkins to take Anglican orders. He failed to take deacon's orders from the Bishop of Oxford, for that reason, a decision by Hawkins connected with Tractarian opposition to Renn Hampden. He began to look at a medical career."]}, {"page": "Timeline of Oxford", "response": ["** 14 March: J. H.
