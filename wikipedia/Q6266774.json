The first came when Llu\u00eds Coll's corner was headed home by Eulogio Mart\u00ednez, and a neat move was finished off by Zolt\u00e1n Czibor who received a  lofted pass on the edge of the penalty area, swivelled, and shot home for the second. Despite numerous corners, there was no further score in the first half, and prompted by the \"tireless\" Johnny Gordon, Birmingham had attempted to combat Barcelona in midfield. But shortly after the interval, Barcelona attacked down the right and Mart\u00ednez passed to Czibor whose second goal killed the game. Gordon Astall had two chances at goal, the former going wide and the latter being deflected in spectacular fashion by Ramallets, before another attack down the right flank allowed Mart\u00ednez to feed Coll, whose \"fierce right-foot drive through a crowd of players\" gave Barcelona a four-goal lead. With little time left, Peter Murphy, making his last appearance for Birmingham, counter-attacked down the left and sent a long cross-field pass towards Hooper, whose mobility helped him beat Ramallets to the ball and score with a header.", "|IR||8|| Johnny Gordon"]}, {"page": "1961 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final", "response": ["Birmingham played Hungarians \u00dajpesti D\u00f3zsa in the first round, with the first leg to be played at home. \u00dajpest twice took the lead, equalised by a Johnny Gordon header and Gordon Astall's shot. Birmingham's repeated attacks broke down near goal, until after 83 minutes Gordon headed home an Astall corner. In the away leg, \u00dajpest took a one-goal lead after an hour, that tied the scores on aggregate, before Gordon was sent off. This left Birmingham facing \"tough opposition and downright one-sided refereeing\" without their centre-forward.
