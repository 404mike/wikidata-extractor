Early on, they scored a worldwide hit with the song \"United We Stand\". By 1973 the concept had run its course and Hiller formed a definite four-member line-up consisting of Martin Lee, Lee Sheriden, Nicky Stevens and Sandra Stevens. This version of the group went on to score many hits around the world in the mid to late 1970s including \"Kiss Me Kiss Your Baby\", \"Angelo\", \"Oh Boy (The Mood I'm In)\" and \"Figaro\". They achieved perhaps their biggest success in their native UK with three number one singles and four top twenty albums. The group under this line-up still continues, performing shows throughout Europe. Altogether, they have released 16 studio albums, with worldwide sales topping 15 million records.", "Keen to keep the established name alive, Hiller set about putting a new line up together. In 1972 he got together a trio of session singers, Martin Lee, Nicky Stevens and Lee Sheriden.", "In 1990, Martin Lee got together with songwriters Paul Curtis and David Kane to compose a musical based on The Butterfly Children books by Angela and Pat Mills. The musical had its world premiere at the Mitchell Theatre in Glasgow, to open the 1990 Glasgow City of Culture and ran for a month and was performed by the Mitchell Theatre for Youth. Just three months later, the show transferred to the larger Kings Theatre in Glasgow and ran for two weeks. The show transferred in late 1992 to London's West End. Brotherhood of Man recorded the songs themselves and the nineteen track collection, available on cassette only, was available to buy at the theatre. The album was never commercially released, although some tracks did make it onto tie-in cassettes to go with the books a few years later. The Butterfly Children, essentially a children's show, featured many differing styles of music from rap to rock and country and western to the more familiar pop the group were known for. The show's run ended after a short season, and has not been performed since.", "* Martin Lee (1972\u2013present)", "   bar:Lee                 text:\"Martin Lee\""]}, {"page": "United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest 1976", "response": ["| align=\"left\" | Tony Hiller, Lee Sheriden & Martin Lee"]}, {"page": "United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest 1983", "response": ["Of the entries, songwriters Tony Hiller, Martin Lee and Paul Curtis had had songs in the Eurovision final before.

His group featured former New Seekers singer Kathy Ann Rae and former entrant Lance Aston (of Prima Donna). When the Kissing Stops, written by Martin Lee and Barry Upton of Brotherhood of Man together with their longtime writing partner Tony Hiller (who had co-written Save Your Kisses For Me with Lee), was originally intended for the group themselves, but they decided it would be best not to risk losing and thus not to take part; although all four members of the group attended the broadcast. The group did go on to record the song however and it featured on their album Lightning Flash. The writers of Keeping Our Love Alive, Doug Flett and Guy Fletcher had written many previous UK finalists, including the 1973 winner Power to All Our Friends.
