His debut was inauspicious, playing in the 7\u20132 defeat by Liverpool. He suffered both relegation and promotion with the club, and in 1936 was made captain of the team by manager Charles Foweraker. In total he played 306 games for the club, scoring 23 times.\nOn 8 April 1939, with World War II seemingly inevitable, Goslin stood in front of a microphone in the middle of Burnden Park and told the assembled crowd that after the game the Bolton team would make their way to the local Territorial Army hall to sign up. When Germany invaded Poland, the cessation of official football games was immediate but local games were allowed and, subject to leave, Goslin played in four games for Bolton as well as guesting for Chelsea and Norwich City when posted temporarily in the south of England and East Anglia. He was also selected for an unofficial international for England against Scotland.\nThe majority of the team were posted to the 53rd (Bolton) Field Regiment and Goslin, now promoted to sergeant, and the other players saw action in France leading up to the withdrawals at Dunkirk. Back in England Goslin was commissioned Lieutenant for his actions in the withdrawal. The regiment were sent to East Anglia to patrol potential enemy landing sites and Goslin was again selected for England, again to play Scotland, twice, as well as Wales.\nIn the summer of 1942 the regiment set sail for Egypt and took part in the defence of Alam el Halfa. With victory in the campaign, the regiment were sent to Kirkurk and then Kifri, where various members of the Bolton team, including Goslin, played for the British Army against the Polish Army in a 4\u20132 victory.\nThe 53rd Regiment then joined in the invasion of Italy, making their way from Taranto to Foggia without much trouble. They then took part in the battle to take control of the River Sangro crossing. Fighting took place for over a month and a number of Goslin's fellow Bolton players were removed. On 14 December 1943, a mortar bomb exploded in the tree under which Goslin had made his observation point. He was hit in the back by shrapnel and wood and mortally wounded although he fought for life for a few more days. He left a wife and two children, one of whom, his son Bob, became a senior figure in the Bolton police as well as in South Yorkshire and Cambridgeshire. He died in August 2008.As a mark of respect, the Bolton players lined up before the centre stand of Burnden Park for a minute's silence and wearing black armbands before their New Year's Day War League game. Goslin and Walter Sidebottom were the only team members to die during the war. Goslin is buried at the Sangro River War Cemetery.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bolton Wanderers F.C.", "response": ["From 1935 to 1964, Bolton enjoyed an uninterrupted stay in the top flight\u00a0\u2013 regarded by fans as a golden era\u00a0\u2013 spearheaded in the 1950s by Nat Lofthouse.

He had been working as a miner while playing amateur football but in 1931 he was spotted by a scout from Bolton Wanderers. The scout had originally travelled to the match to watch another player but quickly moved to sign up Nicholson. He made his debut in a 2\u20132 draw with Liverpool in September 1931 and was a regular for the club until he was displaced by Harry Goslin. He spent time in the clubs reserves and jumped at the chance to play first team football again when he signed for Cardiff City in 1936. He was one of seven new signings made by the club in an attempt to steady the club which had been in decline for several years. He remained with the club for three years before signing for Oldham Athletic in 1939, however the outbreak of World War II soon after meant he never made an appearance for the club."]}, {"page": "Harry Gosling", "response": ["Harry Gosling CH (9 June 1861 \u2013 24 October 1930) was a British Labour Party politician and trade union leader.", "For the last six years of his life Gosling was in poor health.

Before the war, Junak was a team sponsored by the Polish Army, and in late 1939, members of the club created the White Couriers - a boyscouting organization, which smuggled hundreds of persons from the area of Lwow to Hungary, across the newly created Soviet-Hungarian border in the Carpathians. One of the couriers was Stanis\u0142aw Gerula, goalkeeper of Junak. Most of players of Junak, who at the same time were soldiers, left Drohobycz in the night of September 11/12, 1939. A few days later they reached Hungary, where Colonel Mieczys\u0142aw Mlotek, manager of Junak, decided to recreate the team. Junak played several games both in Hungary, and Yugoslavia, among top players there were Antoni Komendo-Borowski (previously of Jagiellonia Bia\u0142ystok and Pogo\u0144 Lw\u00f3w) and Henryk Kidacki. In the second half of 1940, all players together with management moved to Tel Aviv, where several games were organized. In 1942, Junak, known as The Team of Polish Army in the East, was in Iraq.
