In a career spanning more than 50 years, Spedding is best known for his studio session work. By the early 1970s, he had become one of the most sought-after session guitarists in England. Spedding has played on and produced many albums and singles. He has also been a member of eleven rock bands: the Battered Ornaments, Frank Ricotti Quartet, King Mob, Mike Batt and Friends, Necessaries, Nucleus, Ricky Norton, Sharks, Trigger, and The Wombles. In May 1976, Spedding also produced the very first Sex Pistols recordings. AllMusic has described Spedding as \"one of the UK's most versatile session guitarists, [he] has had a long career on two continents that saw him tackle nearly every style of rock and roll ...\".\nSpedding, a long-time friend of Chrissie Hynde, was a regular concert feature artist with The Pretenders on their US tour in March/April 1980. He appeared regularly during the band's encores, playing the guitar solos on their version of The Kinks song \"Stop Your Sobbing\".As well as his celebrated work as a session musician, Spedding pursued a solo career, releasing his debut album Songs Without Words in 1970. Since then, he has released fourteen studio albums, and two live albums. His only solo hit was 1975's \"Motor Bikin'\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "June 17", "response": ["*  1944   \u2013 Chris Spedding, English singer-songwriter and guitarist "]}, {"page": "Sex Pistols", "response": ["On 23 April, as well, the debut album by the leading punk rock band in the New York scene, the Ramones, was released.

Richards says he focuses on chords and rhythms, avoiding flamboyant and competitive virtuosity and trying not to be the \"fastest gun in the west\". Richards prefers teaming with at least one other guitarist and has almost never toured without one. Chuck Berry has been an inspiration for Richards, and, with Jagger, he introduced Berry's songs to the Rolling Stones' early repertoire. In the late 1960s Brian Jones's declining contributions led Richards to record all guitar parts on many tracks, including slide guitar. Jones's replacement, Mick Taylor, played guitar with the Rolling Stones from 1969 to 1974. Taylor's virtuosity on lead guitar led to a pronounced separation between lead and rhythm guitar roles, most notably onstage. In 1975 Taylor was replaced by Wood, whose arrival marked a return to a guitar interplay Richards called \"the ancient art of weaving\", which he and Jones had gleaned from Chicago blues."]}, {"page": "1944 in music", "response": ["*June 17 \u2013 Chris Spedding, guitarist and songwriter"]}, {"page": "Thin Lizzy", "response": ["Lynott replaced Robertson with Gary Moore again, and around this time the band loosely joined forces with Steve Jones and Paul Cook of the Sex Pistols, and also with Chris Spedding and Jimmy Bain, to form The Greedy Bastards, who played a small number of gigs playing a varied selection of songs.

A showpiece of his concerts from the era was his radically transformed cover of Elvis Presley's \"Heartbreak Hotel,\" initially performed by Cale on Slow Dazzle and the live album 1 June 1974, recorded with Kevin Ayers, Nico and Eno. Both \"Leaving It Up to You\" and \"Fear Is a Man's Best Friend\" (from Fear) begin as relatively conventional songs that gradually grow more paranoid in tone before breaking down into what critic Dave Thompson calls \"a morass of discordance and screaming\"."]}, {"page": "Rockabilly", "response": ["Robert Gordon emerged from late 1970s CBGB punk act Tuff Darts to reinvent himself as a rockabilly revival solo artist.

Also festering at CBGB's punk environs were The Cramps, who combined primitive and wild rockabilly sounds with lyrics inspired by old drive-in horror movies in songs like \"Human Fly\" and \"I Was a Teenage Werewolf\". Lead singer Lux Interior's energetic and unpredictable live shows attracted a fervent cult audience.  Their \"psychobilly\" music influenced The Meteors and Reverend Horton Heat.

Tim Polecat and Boz Boorer started playing together in 1976, then hooked up with Phil Bloomberg and Chris Hawkes at the end of 1977.
