Llywelyn built up marriage alliances with several of the Marcher families. One daughter, Gwladus Ddu, (\"Gwladus the Dark\") was already married to Reginald de Braose of Brecon and Abergavenny, but with Reginald an unreliable ally Llywelyn married another daughter, Marared, to John de Braose of Gower, Reginald's nephew.
