Mervyn, who was probably best known for his role as the Bishop of St. Ogg's in All Gas and Gaiters, first appeared as Chief Inspector Rose in The Odd Man (1962). Lewis played his live-in secretary, Miss Drusilla Lamb. Drusilla was employed ostensibly to help Rose with his memoirs, although work on these was repeatedly delayed by his getting involved in unofficial investigative work.In his use of \"influential\" to describe Mr. Rose, Purser (Halliwell, supra) went so far as to draw a comparison with the American series Ironside, which began in 1967 with Raymond Burr as a former San Francisco police chief assisted by three young officers, including Barbara Anderson as the fashionable and well-heeled Eve Whitfield. A year earlier, in the BBC's Adam Adamant Lives!, Gerald Harper as Adamant had, like Rose, a young female assistant (Juliet Harmer as Georgina Jones) and a manservant (Jack May). Though set thirty or so years earlier, the most similar role on British television to that of Drusilla Lamb was probably that of Miss Lemon (Pauline Moran) in the adaptations of Agatha Christie's Poirot novels starring David Suchet (LWT/ITV, 1989\u2013)."]}]}}
