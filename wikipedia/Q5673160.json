Formed in 1896, the club played in the Northamptonshire League (subsequently to become the United Counties League), the Kettering & District Combination League, and more recently the Northants Central Combination League. In the last years of the 20th century, the club was forced to fold, and played for a while under the name Walgrave Royal Oak. After a gap of some 12 years, Walgrave Amber FC was reformed by David Rhodes. It formally re-affiliated with the Northants FA in 2007 and re-joined the Northants Combination League in time for the start of the 2008/9 season. The club's original nickname, The Pipe Stems, has only recently been unearthed. Several Amber players have gone on to play professional football at the highest level, most notably Harry Walden who starred in Northampton Town's rise from Division 4 obscurity to Division 1 between 1963 and 1966."]}, {"page": "2018\u201319 in English football", "response": ["* 23 September 2018: Harry Walden, 77, Luton Town and Northampton Town midfielder."]}, {"page": "2018 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["**Harry Walden, 77, English footballer (Luton Town, Northampton Town)"]}, {"page": "Deaths in September 2018", "response": ["*Harry Walden, 77, English footballer (Luton Town, Northampton Town).Club News Harry Walden"]}, {"page": "Walden (name)", "response": ["* Harry Walden (b. 1940), English professional footballer"]}, {"page": "1965\u201366 Northampton Town F.C. season", "response": ["|Harry Walden||OF||||Walgrave||||58||1||Luton Town||June 1964||", "| OF || style=\"text-align:left;\" |  Harry Walden"]}, {"page": "1964\u201365 Northampton Town F.C. season", "response": ["|Harry Walden||OF||||Walgrave||||39||1||Luton Town||June 1964||", "| OF || style=\"text-align:left;\" |  Harry Walden"]}, {"page": "1966\u201367 Northampton Town F.C. season", "response": ["|Harry Walden||OF||||Walgrave||||76||3||Luton Town||June 1964||", "| OF || style=\"text-align:left;\" |  Harry Walden"]}]}}
