His father was Kenneth Alfred Thomas Pinnock, a publisher, and his mother, Joyce Edith, n\u00e9e Muggleton, was an amateur singer. In Canterbury, the Pinnock family lived near the pianist Ronald Smith, from whose sister Pinnock  had piano lessons. He became a chorister at Canterbury Cathedral when he was seven, attending the choir school from 1956 to 1961 and subsequently Simon Langton Grammar School for Boys.Page, Anne Of Choristers, ancient and modern,  Canterbury, St Edmund\u2019s Junior School . Retrieved 16 February 2010. After receiving instruction in piano and organ, he served as a church organist; by the time he was 15, he began to play the harpsichord. At age 19, he won a Foundation Scholarship to the Royal College of Music to study organ and he also studied harpsichord, winning prizes for performance on both instruments. His teachers were Ralph Downes and Millicent Silver.Noted in the biography in the liner notes of his recording 16th Century English Keyboard Music, CRD records.

From the late 1960s onwards, led by Raymond Lewenthal and Ronald Smith, many pianists have recorded his music and brought it back into the repertoire.", "Alkan's return to the concert platform in 1844 was greeted with enthusiasm by critics, who noted the \"admirable perfection\" of his technique, and lauded him as \"a model of science and inspiration\", a \"sensation\" and an \"explosion\".Fran\u00e7ois-Sappey (1991), 31\u20133. They also commented on the attending celebrities including Liszt, Chopin, Sand and Dumas. In the same year he published his piano \u00e9tude Le chemin de fer, which critics, following Ronald Smith, believe to be the first representation in music of a steam engine.Smith (2000) II, 157. Between 1844 and 1848 Alkan produced a series of virtuoso pieces, the 25 Pr\u00e9ludes Op.\u00a031 for piano or organ, and the sonata Op.\u00a033 Les quatre \u00e2ges.Smith (2000) II, 261\u20132. Following an Alkan recital in 1848, the composer Giacomo Meyerbeer was so impressed that he invited the pianist, whom he considered \"a most remarkable artist\", to prepare the piano arrangement of the overture to his forthcoming opera, Le proph\u00e8te. Meyerbeer heard and approved Alkan's arrangement of the overture for four hands (which Alkan played with his brother Napol\u00e9on) in 1849; published in 1850, it is the only record of the overture, which was scrapped during rehearsals at the Op\u00e9ra.Conway (2012), 229, which cites (n. 102) and translates relevant extracts from Meyerbeer (1960\u20132006).", "Hugh MacDonald writes that \"Alkan's enigmatic character is reflected in his music \u2013 he dressed in a severe, old-fashioned, somewhat clerical manner \u2013 only in black \u2013 discouraged visitors and went out rarely \u2013 he had few friends \u2013 was nervous in public and was pathologically worried about his health, even though it was good\". Ronald Smith writes that \"Alkan's characteristics, exacerbated no doubt by his isolation, are carried to the edge of fanaticism, and at the heart of Alkan's creativity there is also fierce obsessional control; his obsession with a specific idea can border on the pathological.\"Burstein (2006)", "Moreover, in terms of structure, Alkan in his compositions sticks to traditional musical forms, although he often took them to extremes, as he did with piano technique. The study Op.\u00a039, no. 8 (the first movement of the Concerto for solo piano) takes almost half an hour in performance. Describing this \"gigantic\" piece, Ronald Smith comments that it convinces for the same reasons as does the music of the classical masters; \"the underlying unity of its principal themes, and a key structure that is basically simple and sound.\"Smith (2000) II, 128, 134.", "Alkan's earliest works indicate, according to Smith, that in his early teens he \"was a formidable musician but as yet\u00a0... industrious rather than\u00a0... creative\".Smith (2000) II, 1. Only with his 12 Caprices (Opp.12\u201313 and 15\u201316, 1837) did his compositions begin to attract serious critical attention. The Op. 15 set, Souvenirs: Trois morceaux dans le genre path\u00e9tique, dedicated to Liszt, contains Le vent (The Wind), which was at one time the only piece by the composer to figure regularly in recitals. These works, however, did not meet with the approval of Robert Schumann, who wrote: \"One is startled by such false, such unnatural art\u00a0... the last [piece, titled Morte (Death), is] a crabbed waste, overgrown with brush and weeds\u00a0... nothing is to be found but black on black\".Schumann (1880), 317, cited in Conway (2012), 226. Ronald Smith, however, finds in this latter work, which cites the Dies Irae theme also used by Berlioz, Liszt and others, foreshadowings of Maurice Ravel, Modest Mussorgsky and Charles Ives.Smith (2000) II, 21\u20132. Schumann did, however, respond positively to the pieces of Les mois (originally part published as Op.\u00a08 in 1838, later published as a complete set in 1840 as Op. 74): \"[Here] we find such an excellent jest on operatic music in no.\u00a06 [L'Op\u00e9ra] that a better one could scarcely be imagined\u00a0... The composer\u00a0... well understands the rarer effects of his instrument.\"Schumann (1880), 486, cited in Conway (2012), 227. Alkan's technical mastery of the keyboard was asserted by the publication in 1838 of the Trois grandes \u00e9tudes (originally without opus number, later republished as Op.\u00a076), the first for the left hand alone, the second for the right hand alone, the third for both hands; and all of great difficulty, described by Smith as \"a peak of pianistic transcendentalism\".Smith (2000) II, 90. This is perhaps the earliest example of writing for a single hand as \"an entity in its own right, capable of covering all registers of the piano, of rendering itself as accompanied soloist or polyphonist.\"Fran\u00e7ois-Sappey and Luguenot (2013), 25 (translated from the original French).", "For much of the 20th century, Alkan's work remained in obscurity, but from the 1960s onwards it was steadily revived.

However, the publication of the 'Grande sonate' was unfortunate in its timing; in early 1848 the revolution emptied the capital of musical life, and Alkan's failure to obtain a professorship at the Paris Conservatoire later in the year led to his withdrawal from the concert scene.
