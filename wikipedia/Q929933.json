Clochemerle is a stark contrast to the usual kind of bleak and somewhat fatalistic Galton & Simpson comedies. The tone is a gentle departure from  the doom and gloom  and dark comedy of their Steptoe and Son and Hancock's Half Hour. Filmed on location in the charming village of Colombier-le-Vieux, in the department of Ard\u00e8che, south of Lyon, France, it starred Roy Dotrice, Wendy Hiller, Cyril Cusack, Kenneth Griffith, Cyd Hayman, Bernard Bresslaw, Hugh Griffith, Micheline Presle, Madeline Smith, Christian Roberts, Nigel Green, Wolfe Morris and Gordon Rollings, with narration by Peter Ustinov.
