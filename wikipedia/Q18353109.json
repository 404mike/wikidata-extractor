The story now included a childhood memory of a family visit to Ladybower Reservoir, during the drought of 1976, when the eight-year-old Bramwell saw a ghostly church spire rising from the water. The memory was described by Mathew Clayton in Caught by the River: 'Bramwell, watching from the family\u2019s Hillman Hunter, describes it as a \u2018drowning god coming up for air'. It symbolises Bramwell\u2019s world view perfectly \u2014 one where the conventional (a family day out in the Hillman Hunter) exists happily side-by-side with the unconventional (Excalibur!).' The show, performed by candlelight, mixed 'music, archive film, narration, ritual and animation.'David Clarke, 'Beneath the dark and lonely waters', The Fortean Times, May 2021, p58-59 Bramwell then toured the show, taking it to Sheffield, Doncaster, Liverpool, London and various festivals. Each performance concluded with a Q&A focusing on the stories and history of the local river. So, in Liverpool, Bramwell was joined by the poet Eleanor Rees talking about the folklore surrounding the River Mersey.The Cult of Water, Liverpool Arts Lab listing, 23 November 2018 In London, the folklorist Chris Roberts talked about the capital's lost rivers."]}]}}
