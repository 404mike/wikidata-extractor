He was one of the first to bring a distinct personality to the accompanist's role. He toured extensively to all continents and appeared at music festivals such as Salzburg and Edinburgh.  His career lasted over 60 years.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "William Primrose", "response": ["On the urging of the accompanist Ivor Newton, Primrose moved to Belgium to study under Eug\u00e8ne Ysa\u00ffe. from 1926 to 1929.

Gildesgame, 41 Clifton Hill, South Hampstead, where the guests included Sir Henry Wood.The Times 12 March 1938 After giving a private recital at the home of Sir Philip Sassoon, Hassid made his public debut at a recital with Gerald Moore in the Wigmore Hall on 3 April 1940, billed as the \"Polish Boy Violinist\",Margaret Campbell: The Great Violinists (1980) playing works by Corelli (La Follia variations), Debussy, Schubert (Sonata in G), Bach (adagio and fugue from one of the unaccompanied sonatas), Paganini (I palpiti) and others. The next day The Times wrote Hassid \"showed imagination and musical insight\" and that \"his performance created a strong impression.\" Many years later Moore commented that Hassid was \"the greatest instrumental genius I've ever partnered. I don't know how to explain his incandescence. He had technical perfection, marvellous intonation, glorious tone \u2013 but there was something above that which was quite incredible, a metaphysical quality. Sadly he had an unhappy love affair which literally drove him mad. But then maybe the unrest inside him made him play so fantastically.\" (Interview in The Gramophone, April 1973.)", "Fred Gaisberg of EMI arranged for a test recording of Elgar's La Capricieuse (Op. 17) with accompanist Ivor Newton at the Abbey Road Studios on 9 January 1939 when Hassid had just turned 15; and then Walter Legge produced a further eight recordings on 12 and 28 June and 29 November 1940, this time accompanied by Gerald Moore. The delay was due to Hassid's agent Harold Holt, who thought he should continue his studies for another year. Some who heard Hassid perform live say that the records do not show him at his best. Even so, his performances of Joseph Achron's Hebrew Melody, Sarasate's Zapateado and Kreisler's Caprice viennois in particular are superb and show virtuosity of the highest order in expressive phrasing. To quote from Bryan Crimp's note with the Testament CD: \"The moment Hassid puts bow to string he beguiles the ear via a captivating and uniquely individual sound ... a peerless technique and an arresting and frequently original interpretative approach. His technical security and cleanness of attack are awesome, his tone at once vibrant, virile and indescribably pure and sweet.\" Hassid apparently thought that his vibrato sounded too fast on record, but this is probably just a matter of taste."]}, {"page": "York Bowen", "response": ["In 1912 Bowen married Sylvia Dalton, a singer and the daughter of a Somerset vicar.
