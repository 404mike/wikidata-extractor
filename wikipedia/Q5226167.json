He also coached his country's under-21 side. After McDonald was appointed manager of Glentoran, he started to bring in new faces. He signed Dungannon Swifts winger David Scullion along with Rory Hamill. McDonald also brought in young promising players, including Daryl Fordyce, Philip Carson, Matty Burrows, and Shane McCabe. He also added goalkeeper Michael Dougherty as backup to Elliott Morris, and brought in Hearts defender Johnny Taylor. In his first full season as manager of the East Belfast club, McDonald led Glentoran to win the County Antrim Shield over Crusaders. In McDonald's second season, he led the club to become Irish Premiership champions after four years. During his second season McDonald continued to bring in new faces, after selling Michael Dougherty, McDonald brought in Dundela keeper James Taylor. In his third season in charge McDonald started by signing former Northern Ireland international Keith Gillespie and Newry City player Richard Clarke. But Glentoran went on a losing streak, and after a 6\u20130 home defeat to Coleraine, fans turned against McDonald and calling for him to resign. McDonald stayed on until his side lost 2\u20130 to Dungannon Swifts F.C. and McDonald resigned after the game."]}, {"page": "Robert Garrett (footballer)", "response": ["On 16 April 2013 Garrett followed fellow Linfield men Daryl Fordyce and Albert Watson joining "]}, {"page": "1987 in Northern Ireland", "response": ["*2 January - Daryl Fordyce, footballer."]}, {"page": "2009 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualification Group 9", "response": ["*: Daryl Fordyce, Thomas Stewart"]}, {"page": "2008 Setanta Sports Cup", "response": ["*  Daryl Fordyce (Glentoran)"]}, {"page": "Canadian Championship", "response": ["| Daryl Fordyce || FC Edmonton"]}, {"page": "Albert Watson (footballer, born 1985)", "response": ["On 18 January 2013, it was announced that Watson, along with teammate Daryl Fordyce would not return to Linfield the following season, instead seeking new playing opportunities in Canada.
