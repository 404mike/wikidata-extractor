Douglas Castle was burnt by the Highland armies of Bonnie Prince Charlie in the Jacobite rising of 1745. Douglas Castle was again burnt down in 1755, and the Duke commenced work on a new edifice designed by Robert Adam. Building work ceased on the Duke's death in 1761, and with it his Dukedom became extinct. The Marquisate of Douglas and Earldom of Angus devolved to James Hamilton, 7th Duke of Hamilton, the senior male-line descendant of William Douglas, 1st Marquess of Douglas, his great-great-great grandfather, by the way of his son, Lord William Douglas, 1st Earl of Selkirk, whom upon his marriage to Anne Hamilton, 3rd Duchess of Hamilton, became William Hamilton, Duke of Hamilton, the adoption of the surname Hamilton being one of the conditions to inheriting the Dukedom. His descendants would later add Douglas back to the surname and become the Douglas-Hamilton branch."]}, {"page": "Liverpool ministry", "response": ["| Lord William Douglas"]}, {"page": "William Robert Keith Douglas", "response": ["#REDIRECT Lord William Douglas"]}, {"page": "Lord William Robert Keith Douglas", "response": ["#REDIRECT Lord William Douglas"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1812 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Lord William Douglas "]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1818 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Lord William Douglas "]}, {"page": "Catherine Edward", "response": ["She worked as a governess for the Reverend Principal Nicoll and then took a similar role for Lord William Douglas, leaving that employment at the end of 1843."]}]}}
