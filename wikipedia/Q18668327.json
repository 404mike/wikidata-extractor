This was to cover the fact that Munio, dissolute and violent, made an earlier appearance in an affair involving a monastery of Dominican nuns in the small provincial city of his hometown of Zamora, which had occasioned a canonical visitation by the Bishop of Zamora in 1279. The community of Dominican nuns was split into factions, and the Dominican friars were behaving like characters from the Decameron. The resulting depositions survive, to form the basis of a highly readable history by Peter Linehan (1997) that lays open more than just the social history of Dominican friars and nuns in 13th-century Castile. Following Munio, his friends and his enemies, from Zamora to the papal court over a twenty-year period, Linehan shows how events in a Castilian monastery could influence high politics in the medieval Church.", "*Mary Laven's detailed review of Peter Linehan, The Ladies of Zamora 1997", "*Peter Linehan article in History Today March 1997."]}, {"page": "St Benedict's School, Ealing", "response": ["* Peter Linehan, ,Faculty of History University of Cambridge website Accessed 30 January 2021 scholar of medieval Iberia, Fellow, Tutor, and Dean of St John's College, Cambridge"]}, {"page": "Walter Ullmann", "response": ["* Brian Tierney and Peter Linehan (eds.), Authority and Power: Studies on Medieval Law and Government Presented to Walter Ullmann on his seventieth birthday (Cambridge University Press, 1980).

He was a moderator from 1789 to 1791 which entailed him presiding over oral examinations which were then necessary for the B.A. to be awarded. As a moderator Lax was responsible for the introduction of \"very high flown compliments, and at the same time extending the disputations to double the usual length, which was around one hour and ten minutes\" which \"sent a ripple through tradition\" according to Greg Dening. Dening argues that this was, \"Lax's way of getting into the act and making Acts flourish\".
