A fragment from a poem, presumed to be by Pindar, mentions Persephone accepting \"requital for ancient wrong\", from the dead, which might be a reference to humans' inherited responsibility for the Titan's killing of Dionysus.Pindar , fr. 133 Bergk, apud Plato, Meno 81bc  (= fr. 127 Bowra); This interpretation, first proposed by H. J. Rose, is discussed by Linforth, pp. 345\u2013350, who while raising several objections and giving other possible explanations, concludes by saying \"but after all, and in spite of these objections, one must acknowledge that there is a high degree of probability in Rose's interpretation.\" Others have agreed: Dodds, pp. 155\u2013156, says the line is \"most naturally explained as referring to human responsibility for the slaying of Dionysus\", Burkert, p. 298, says this \"ancient grief\" of Persephone \"can only be the death of her child Dionysos\"; Parker 2002,  p. 496 says \"No myth is known which really explains the allusion except that of the murder of Persephone's son Dionysus by man's ancestors\". However, West 1983, p. 110 n. 82,  Seaford,  pp. 7\u20138, who sees \"difficulties\" in Rose's interpretation\", and Edmonds 1999, pp. 47\u201349, who rejects Rose's reading, all offer different interpretations. Plato, in presenting a succession of stages whereby, because of excessive liberty, men degenerate from reverence for the law, to lawlessness, describes the last stage where \"men display and reproduce the character of the Titans of story\".Plato, Laws 3.701bc (= Orphic fr. 9 Kern). This Platonic passage is often taken as referring to the anthropogony, however, whether men are supposed by Plato to \"display and reproduce\" this lawless character because of their Titanic heritage, or by simple imitation, is unclear.Linforth, pp. 339\u2013345; Edmonds 1999, pp. 43\u201344; Edmonds 2013, pp. 326\u2013334. Xenocrates' reference to the Titans (and perhaps Dionysus) to explain Plato's use of the word \"custody\" (\u03c6\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd\u03c1\u03b1), has also been seen as possible evidence of a pre-Hellenistic date for the myth.Xenocrates, fr. 20 Heinze (= Damascius, In Phaedo 1.2); Linforth, pp. 337\u2013339; Dodds, p. 156; West 1983, pp. 21\u201322; Burkert, p. 298;  Edmonds 1999, p. 46;  Parker 2002, p. 496"]}, {"page": "Ocypete", "response": ["* H.

Prof. Grant mentions a shorter, prior work in Greek, Lucius or the Ass (118), though the story probably first arose as a folktale; Grant later discusses Apuleius' wide influence after 'rediscovery' by Renaissance Europe (121\u2013122). The plot unfolds in Greece where the hero, while experimenting with the ointment of a sorceress, is changed not into an owl (as intended) but into a donkey.Apuleius, The Golden Ass (Indiana Univ. 1960) at 82\u201384 (near the end of book III).Regarding the hero's metamorphosis: one may note the emblem (the imperial Roman eagle, or the owl of Athens) indirectly referenced by the admired bird of prey, versus the North African populist image of the libidinous donkey. Thereafter his ability to speak leaves him, but he remains able to understand the talk of others. In a famous digression (one of many), the celebrated folktale of Cupid and Psyche is artfully told by a crone. Therein Cupid, son of the Roman goddess Venus, falls in love with a beautiful but mortal girl, who because of her loveliness has been jinxed by Cupid's mother; the god Jupiter resolves their dilemma. The hero as donkey listens as the story is told.Apuleius, The Golden Ass (Indiana Univ. 1960) at 104\u2013142 (near the end of book IV to near the end of book VI).Also: a psychological study by Erich Neumann, Amor and Psyche.
