In the first season, Garrett is the mastermind behind Project Centipede, a subset of the S.H.I.E.L.D. infiltrator faction, but was killed by Phil Coulson in the season one finale after being betrayed by his bodyguard Deathlok. Introduced in season two, Whitehall and Bakshi's faction sought to find a lost city associated with an Inhuman Diviner while using Hydra Industries as a front. Introduced in season three, Ward's short-lived faction, which included Werner, attempts to unite Hydra while planning revenge on Coulson's group. Gideon's faction, the original Hydra movement, is a fanatical cult that worships an ancient, powerful Inhuman entity called Hive. Introduced in season five, General Hale's faction wanted S.H.I.E.L.D. to unite with them and the Confederacy due to Thanos' impending attack. Introduced in season seven, Wilfred starts out as a lowly doorman in the 1930s and is initially unaware of his connection to Hydra until he is tasked with delivering what would become the Red Skull's super-soldier serum to them before going on to become a high-ranking agent of Hydra, and ostensibly S.H.I.E.L.D."]}, {"page": "Quantum of Solace", "response": ["* Simon Kassianides as Yusef Kabira, a member of Quantum who seduces female agents and manipulates them into giving away classified information.
