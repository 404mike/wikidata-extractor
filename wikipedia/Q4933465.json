In September, Sproson made a \u00a310,000 bid for Keith Leonard that was rejected.

The \"Valiants\" proved difficult to beat, and heading into Christmas they won six of their last nine league games. Their 4\u20130 win over Huddersfield Town lifted them into third place, though attendances were still below 4,000. A 3\u20131 win over Southend United at Roots Hall then put the club into second spot, at which point Bob Mountford was sold to Rochdale for \u00a32,000. A four-day holiday in Benidorm in the new year did not seem to help the Vale, as three straight defeats followed to drag them down the table. To halt the slide Sproson bought striker Derek Brownbill from Liverpool for \u00a35,000.
