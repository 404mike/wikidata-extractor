The genre of War Requiem is perhaps the most notable, which comprise compositions dedicated to the memory of people killed in wartime. These often include extra-liturgical poems of a pacifist or non-liturgical nature; for example, the War Requiem of Benjamin Britten juxtaposes the Latin text with the poetry of Wilfred Owen, Krzysztof Penderecki's Polish Requiem includes a traditional Polish hymn within the sequence, and Robert Steadman's Mass in Black intersperses environmental poetry and prophecies of Nostradamus. Holocaust Requiem may be regarded as a specific subset of this type. The Requiem Ebraico (Hebrew Requiem) (1945) by Austrian-American composer Eric Zeisl, a setting of Psalm 92 dedicated to the memory of the composer's father \"and the other countless victims of the Jewish tragedy in Europe\", is considered the first major work of Holocaust commemoration. John Foulds's A World Requiem was written in the aftermath of the First World War and initiated the Royal British Legion's annual festival of remembrance. Recent requiem works by Taiwanese composers Tyzen Hsiao and Ko Fan-long follow in this tradition, honouring victims of the February 28 Incident and subsequent White Terror."]}, {"page": "Shepherd's Bush", "response": ["Classical musicians Evelyn Glennie and Robert Steadman have both lived in Shepherd's Bush."]}, {"page": "List of 21st-century classical composers", "response": ["|Robert Steadman || 1965 ||  || British ||  ||"]}, {"page": "Sredni Vashtar", "response": ["\"Sredni Vashtar\" has been adapted as a chamber opera three times.
