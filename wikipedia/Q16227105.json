This was perceived as advantageous to the attacking side, but their choice meant they started the match with the sun in their faces. The Welsh captain Kenrick kicked off the match at 3:40p.m. The Scots gained possession almost immediately and proceeded to attack the Welsh goal as John Ferguson won the first corner of the game after making a run down the wing, but the resulting setpiece was cleared without incident. Wales were forced to defend resolutely; the North Wales Chronicle noted that \"the Welsh defended their goal in such a compact and determined way that the ball could not be passed through them.\" William Evans was called on early on to \"save the fortress\" by intercepting a pass and sending the ball upfield. The Welsh players were unable to break out of their own half as the game progressed and their forwards' passing game was described as \"not much understood\", while David Thomson in the Welsh goal made his first save soon after with a comfortable catch. The Welsh side's strongest play of the first half came from a Scottish corner when the ball fell to Kenrick who beat several opposition players to break into the Scottish half before being chased down by Sandy Kennedy. Kenrick was able to pass to Edwards but he was quickly dispossessed by the defenders.
