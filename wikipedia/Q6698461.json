Sthalekar made her debut in the First Test at the Gabba in Brisbane. She is the 143rd woman to play Test cricket for Australia.  In a low-scoring match, she bowled 11 overs, taking 1/8 as the tourists made 124 batting first. Her maiden Test wicket was that of English captain Clare Connor, caught by Cathryn Fitzpatrick. Sthalekar was then given the duty of opening the batting alongside captain Belinda Clark. She was not successful as Australia then collapsed to be all out for 78; Sthalekar made six from 14 balls and occupied the crease for 13 minutes before being trapped lbw by Lucy Pearson in her maiden Test innings. After taking 1/16 from 15 overs, removing Claire Taylor caught behind by wicket-keeper Julia Price, and catching Clare Taylor from Fitzpatrick, England was all out for 92.
