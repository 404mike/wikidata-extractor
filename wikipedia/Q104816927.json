However, Fulton never made a first-team appearance in the English Football League and by the end of the same year was back in Scotland with Rangers, who finished runners-up in the 1913\u201314 Scottish Division One table, and then immediately sold Fulton back to Morton.\nWorld War I soon broke out, and during the conflict Fulton served in the Scots Guards, attaining the rank of sergeant-major. His military commitments meant he rarely played for Morton (who were one of Scotland's strongest teams during the period) but remained contracted to them. In 1919, with the war at an end, Fulton was permitted to play for Morton's local rivals St Mirren, primarily in the 1919 Victory Cup due to an injury to Bernard Callaghan, and he was part of the team which brought the trophy to Paisley \u2013 his home town \u2013 with a win over Heart of Midlothian at Celtic Park.Fulton retired as a footballer in 1923, becoming a local professional player and greenkeeper at Bushes Golf Club in Paisley. He died in an accident in November 1926 when he fell off a wall at his workplace, and the shotgun he was carrying for pest control on the course discharged, shooting him in the head. His son, also John, played for Queen of the South and Dumbarton in the 1940s.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "John Fulton", "response": ["*John Fulton (bullfighter) (1932\u20151998), American bullfighter", "*John Fulton (cricketer, born 1849) (1849\u20131908), New Zealand cricketer", "*John Fulton (cricketer, born 1965) (born 1965), New Zealand cricketer", "*John Fulton (footballer) (1890\u20131926), Scottish footballer", "*John Fulton (instrument maker) (1803\u20131853), Scottish maker of Orrerys", "*John Fulton (writer) (born 1967), American author ", "*John Fulton (priest) (1834\u20131907), Episcopal priest with The Living Church, writer, lecturer, journalist", "*John Fulton, Baron Fulton (1902\u20131986), British university administrator and public servant", "*John Fulton, American TV host and cat behaviorist, best known for the TV series Must Love Cats and Cats 101", "*John Fulton Reynolds (1820\u20131863), American Civil War commander"]}, {"page": "Jimmy Gourlay", "response": ["He played for Port Glasgow Athletic, and for Everton in England between 1909 and 1913James Walter Gourlay [sic], 11v11.com before joining Morton as part of an exchange deal for John Fulton.James Gourley of Everton and Morton, ToffeeWeb, 14 November 2016 He remained an important member of the Greenock club's strong team in the era spanning World War I when they finished in the top four of the Scottish Football League for six seasons running, and won the War Fund Shield in 1915.Football: War Shield Final, Glasgow Herald, 29 April 1915"]}, {"page": "1913\u201314 Rangers F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\" | John Fulton"]}, {"page": "1919 Victory Cup", "response": ["|DF ||3 || John Fulton"]}]}}
