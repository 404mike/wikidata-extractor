However, Fulton never made a first-team appearance in the English Football League and by the end of the same year was back in Scotland with Rangers, who finished runners-up in the 1913\u201314 Scottish Division One table, and then immediately sold Fulton back to Morton.\nWorld War I soon broke out, and during the conflict Fulton served in the Scots Guards, attaining the rank of sergeant-major. His military commitments meant he rarely played for Morton (who were one of Scotland's strongest teams during the period) but remained contracted to them. In 1919, with the war at an end, Fulton was permitted to play for Morton's local rivals St Mirren, primarily in the 1919 Victory Cup due to an injury to Bernard Callaghan, and he was part of the team which brought the trophy to Paisley \u2013 his home town \u2013 with a win over Heart of Midlothian at Celtic Park.Fulton retired as a footballer in 1923, becoming a local professional player and greenkeeper at Bushes Golf Club in Paisley. He died in an accident in November 1926 when he fell off a wall at his workplace, and the shotgun he was carrying for pest control on the course discharged, shooting him in the head. His son, also John, played for Queen of the South and Dumbarton in the 1940s.", "link_mentions": {}}}
