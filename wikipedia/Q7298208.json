He played primarily as a defensive midfielder, but also frequently played in more attacking positions, including as a striker. He amassed over 500 appearances in the Football League, and achieved promotion to the First Division with Carlisle United, Sunderland, Bolton Wanderers and Watford. After retiring as a player, Train turned to coaching, and briefly managed Walsall as a caretaker in the 1988\u201389 season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Northampton Town F.C. seasons", "response": ["|align=left| Ray Train || 54"]}, {"page": "Bill Moore (footballer, born 1913)", "response": ["After Walsall slipped back into the Third Division in 1963, in the most unfortunate of circumstances, being reduced to nine men in the final game of the season from which they needed a point but ended up going down by two goals to one against Charlton Athletic, Moore left Fellows Park early the following season to take up a scouting position with Fulham. He returned to Fellows Park in February 1969, to succeed Ron Lewin, and over the next three years developed players such as Phil Parkes and Ray Train. But as financial problems loomed large, Moore resigned his post in March 1972 after a disagreement with coach John Smith over a substitution. In later years Moore kept the Bear Inn in Stafford and died in 1982."]}]}}
