Gibson was a town councillor and alderman for 24 years and was twice elected Mayor. He was treasurer of the local British Schools for 45 years, Vice-Chairman of the Board of Guardians, and Chairman of the Management Committee of Saffron Walden Hospital. He was prominent in bringing the railway to Saffron Walden. He was a distinguished botanist and author of the 'Flora of Essex'. He was a leading member of the Society of Friends both locally and nationally. He is remembered as Saffron Walden's greatest benefactor. There was hardly any institution in the town which did not benefit from his liberality. Gibson when he died in 1883 left a substantial estate of \u00a3342,456, worth more than \u00a323 millions in today's money. This was distributed to the hospital, the museum, the literary society, the Grammar School, the British Schools, the Friends' School, the training college for female teachers, the almshouses, as well as causes outside the town.

The work involved a large new porch designed by Edward Burgess in the Tudor style which was officially opened by the mayor, Joseph Bell, who accepted the keys from Gibson, on 1 October 1879. The design of the porch, which was timber-framed on the upper floors, involved a three-opening loggia on the ground floor and a prominent bay window on the first floor flanked by brackets supporting a pediment containing a smaller window and a coat of arms in the tympanum. Following the remodelling, the principal rooms were the council chamber and the assembly room. Pevsner liked the design which he described as \"ostentatious\" but worthy of \"an honourable mention\".", "Works of art in the town hall include portraits by Dani\u00ebl Mijtens of King Charles I and of Queen Henrietta and a portrait by Henry Scott Tuke of the benefactor of the town hall, George Stacey Gibson."]}]}}
