He scored 24 goals in 68 appearances for Wolves, but the club were relegated from the Premier League in 2012. Fletcher was then transferred to Sunderland for \u00a312 million. He played 108 matches and scored 23 goals for them, also spending half a season on loan at French club Marseille in 2016. He then joined Sheffield Wednesday. Fletcher spent four seasons at Hillsborough scoring 38 goals.

Hibs hoped that selling the Easter Road site would allow them to clear their debts and reduce costs.

Farmer expressed support for further redeveloping Easter Road, if it could be part of a viable business plan. During the consultation, Farmer said that his main priority was ensuring the club's survival and denied that any deal had been concluded. The consultation found that the fans were largely opposed to the Straiton proposal, which the club eventually abandoned. To remove part of the debt, the club sold some land to the east of the stadium that had previously been used for car parking. Selling players, including Steven Whittaker, Scott Brown, Kevin Thomson and Steven Fletcher, also funded these debts and further work."]}, {"page": "Scotland national football team", "response": ["Gordon Strachan was appointed Scotland manager in January 2013, but defeats in his first two competitive matches meant that Scotland were the first UEFA team to be eliminated from the 2014 World Cup.

In UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying, Scotland appeared to have a better chance of qualification as the finals tournament was expanded from 16 teams to 24.

Larsson scored another free kick on 8 January in the FA Cup in a 2\u20130 win against Peterborough United at London Road.
