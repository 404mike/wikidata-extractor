It was at the school where Graham developed a close relationship with troubled teenager Joe Tate (Ned Porteous). Joe's aunt and guardian, Zoe Tate (Leah Bracknell) made him Joe's guardian to prevent Joe from being expelled. One night, Graham set his residence on fire with himself inside in a suicide attempt. Joe found him and pulled him out. After the fire, Graham remained sober and started working for Joe.

Following her sentencing, \"viewers' worst fears were finally confirmed\" when it was revealed that Joe Tate (Ned Porteous) is responsible for her lawyer being swapped. This was due to Joe wanting to make Aaron vulnerable for a business deal. Liv repeatedly affirms to Aaron that she is fine in the unit, but when he visits her, she opens up about her alcohol problem. Aaron vows to be supportive of Liv, but Lindsay wrote that it \"may prove easier said than done\" due to being in prison. When Liv is in prison, Gerry is killed, which leads her to be \"overcome with sadness over her loss\". Following her release from prison, Aaron becomes worried that she will not be able to cope. Liv gives Terry (Daniel Casey) a comic strip drawn by Gerry, and Lachlan White (Thomas Atkinson), who murdered Gerry, realises that it incriminates him. Liv begins a cat and mouse situation with Lachlan when she notices that he is hiding something. She texts him threatening messages anonymously, and Atkinson stated that although his character is initially unaware of who is sending the messages, Liv is in danger. He explained that Liv \"doesn't really know what Lachlan is capable of\", as Liv believes he is only responsible for a robbery rather than Gerry's murder. Lachlan realises that Liv is responsible for the text messages when he sees her acting suspiciously with a phone. Emmerdale then listed Liv as a potential victim of Lachlan, who becomes \"grimly satisfied\" when he believes that he has killed her by breaking the carbon monoxide detector at her house and deliberately causing a gas leak. Liv survives and blames Lachlan for her potential death, but nobody believes her. As a result, Liv begins drinking again in a \"heartbreaking twist\"."]}]}}
