The aim of the show was to decide the best new young pop singer (or \"pop idol\") in the UK based on viewer voting and participation. Two series were broadcast, one in 2001\u20132002 and a second in 2003. Pop Idol was subsequently put on an indefinite hiatus after series judge Simon Cowell announced the launch of The X Factor in the UK in April 2004.The show has become an international TV franchise since, spawning multiple Idol series worldwide. In the meantime, a legal dispute arose with the makers of Popstars, which eventually led to the word \"pop\" being excluded from the titles of all the spin-offs, such as American Idol, Australian Idol, Arab Idol, Canadian Idol, Indonesian Idol, Indian Idol, New Zealand Idol, Latin American Idol, Idol (Norway), Idol (Poland), Idol (Sweden), Idols (South Africa), Pakistan Idol, Bangladeshi Idol and \u00cddolos (same name for the Portuguese and Brazilian series).\nThe show's theme music was written by Gingell/Stone and Cathy Dennis.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wald (surname)", "response": ["*Warren Wald (born 1980), English Pop Idol contestant"]}]}}
