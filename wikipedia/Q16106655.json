While on diplomatic trips, her clothes and attire were chosen to match the destination countries' costumes, and while off-duty she used to wear loose jackets and jumpers. \"She was always very thoughtful about how her clothes would be interpreted, it was something that really mattered to her\", according to Anna Harvey, a former British Vogue editor and Diana's fashion mentor. David Sassoon, one of the designers who worked with Diana, believed she had \"broken the rules\" by trying new styles. Diana chose not to practise some of the royal clothing traditions such as putting aside the tradition of wearing gloves when meeting the public as she believed it would prevent a direct connection with the people she met, such as those affected by serious diseases like AIDS patients. She used to wear certain types of clothes at charity events which were appropriate for the people she would meet, such as wearing colourful dresses and \"jangling jewels\" so she could easily play with children at hospitals. According to Donatella Versace who worked closely with Diana alongside her brother, Diana's interest and sense of curiosity about fashion grew significantly after her separation from Charles. Versace also pointed out that \"[she doesn't] think that anyone, before or after her, has done for fashion what Diana did\"."]}, {"page": "Dress of the Year", "response": [": Anna Harvey"]}, {"page": "Norman Bergen", "response": ["His latest album, his first as featured performer, is Symphony of Love.

The soundtrack to the show included unreleased tracks by U2, while John Hurt recited poetry by Seamus Heaney. Anna Harvey of UK Vogue declared Keogh's show the \"jewel in the crown\" of that Fashion Week.
