He played as an inside forward.\nSmith was born in Bootle, Lancashire. After an unsuccessful trial with Liverpool in 1907, he played for Southend United and Chester before joining Bury in December 1911. Though his first season ended in relegation from the First Division, Smith stayed another two years, and over his career at Bury he scored at a rate better than one goal every three games. He joined fellow Second Division club Birmingham towards the end of the 1913\u201314 season. The club were looking for a creative player to supply chances for Andy Smith and Jack Hall, but Smith lost out in this role to England international Jimmy Windridge, whose second spell with Birmingham coincided with Smith's arrival. He went on to play for Altrincham during the First World War.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Walter Smith (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Wally Smith (footballer, born 1885) (1885\u2013?), English footballer", "*Wally Smith (mathematician) (born 1926), American mathematician", "*Wally Smith (disambiguation)"]}, {"page": "Wally Smith", "response": ["Wally Smith may refer to:", "*Wally Smith (baseball) (1888\u20131930), MLB player", "*Wally Smith (footballer, born 1874) (1874\u20131958), English footballer with Lincoln, Brighton, Norwich and Southend in the 1900s", "*Wally Smith (footballer, born 1885) (1885 \u2013 after 1915), English footballer with Bury and Birmingham in the 1910s", "*Wally Smith, La Choy Chinese food co-founder", "*Wally Smith (mathematician) (born 1926), British-American mathematician"]}, {"page": "Walter Smith (footballer born 1885)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Wally Smith (footballer, born 1885)"]}, {"page": "Wally Smith (footballer born 1885)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Wally Smith (footballer, born 1885)"]}]}}
