His talents were noticed by numerous top-flight clubs both in Scotland and England. Cooper chose to sign for Scottish Second Division side Clydebank in 1974, beginning his career as a professional footballer. Cooper continued to show potential at Clydebank, finishing as the club's top scorer in his second full season at Kilbowie Park and helping the club achieve successive league promotions in 1975\u201376 and 1976\u201377.\nCooper signed for Rangers in June 1977 for a fee of \u00a3100,000 at the age of 21. The next 12 years would see him become a Rangers stalwart, playing 540 games and winning numerous trophies with the Ibrox club, including the Scottish Premier Division in 1977\u201378, 1986\u201387 and 1988\u201389. In August 1989, Tommy McLean signed Cooper for Motherwell for a fee of \u00a350,000. He played over 150 times for the Steelmen and was part of the team that won the 1991 Scottish Cup Final against Dundee United. Cooper also represented the Scotland national football team from 1979 to 1990, in which he was capped 22 times and scored 6 goals. During this time, he represented Scotland at the 1986 FIFA World Cup in Mexico, making two appearances for the national team at the tournament.\nIn his later career, Cooper returned to Clydebank in the capacity of a player/assistant coach. He intended to retire as a player at the end of the 1995 season, however on 22 March 1995 he suffered a subarachnoid hemorrhage at Broadwood Stadium in Cumbernauld whilst filming Shoot, a youth coaching television programme. He died the following day at the age of 39. An inductee of the Scottish Football Hall of Fame, Cooper is regarded by many as having been one of Scottish football's greatest talents.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Scots", "response": ["* Davie Cooper (1956\u20131995), footballer"]}, {"page": "March 23", "response": ["*1995 \u2013 Davie Cooper, Scottish footballer and coach (b. 1956)"]}, {"page": "1995", "response": ["* March 23 \u2013 Davie Cooper, Scottish footballer (b. 1956)"]}, {"page": "1956", "response": ["** Davie Cooper, Scottish footballer (d. 1995)"]}, {"page": "Rangers F.C.", "response": ["*  Davie Cooper", "*  Davie Cooper \u2013 2006 Inductee"]}, {"page": "Hamilton, South Lanarkshire", "response": ["* Davie Cooper         (Clydebank, Rangers, Motherwell & Scotland Footballer)"]}, {"page": "Motherwell F.C.", "response": ["*  Davie Cooper", "Motherwell were sponsored in the 2019\u201320 season by online gambling company Paddy Power as part of their 'Save our Shirt' campaign'.

With only nine minutes remaining and Wales leading 1\u20130, Scotland were awarded a penalty kick, which was calmly scored by Davie Cooper. The 1\u20131 draw meant that Scotland progressed, but as the players and fans celebrated, Stein suffered a heart attack and died shortly afterwards. His assistant Alex Ferguson took over.

Paul McStay scored twice in the first half, and came close to getting a hat-trick when he struck the crossbar in the second half. Charlie Nicholas scored Scotland's third goal. Stein observed that Scotland \"won with style\" and singled out winger Davie Cooper along with McStay for the flair they both displayed. The Scots turned in an even better showing in their next tie, a 3\u20131 home win over Spain. Two first half headed goals from Mo Johnston gave Scotland a 2\u20130 lead at half-time. Spain pulled a goal back in the second half, but with 18 minutes remaining Kenny Dalglish dribbled past three Spanish defenders before striking a powerful shot high into the net for Scotland's third. It was Dalglish's 30th international goal, equalling the record held by Denis Law. Stein described the win over Spain as \"the most satisfying since I became [Scotland] manager\", adding that \"we scored three goals against a quality team that came to defend\". Spanish manager Miguel Mu\u00f1oz praised the Scots' performance, describing them as \"tremendous\". Performances and results were more mixed in the later qualifying ties, losing the return match in Spain, going down to a 1\u20130 defeat against Wales in Glasgow and scraping a narrow 1\u20130 win over Iceland in Reykjav\u00edk. Scotland went into their last qualifying tie, away to Wales, needing at least a draw to secure a play-off spot.", "On 10 September 1985, Scotland played Wales at Ninian Park, Cardiff, in a 1986 World Cup qualification match. Wales had been leading 1\u20130 by a Mark Hughes goal, before Scotland were awarded a penalty kick with 9 minutes left. Davie Cooper scored to make the score 1\u20131; the resulting draw secured a qualification play-off against Australia.

Wales then beat Iceland at Ninian Park, before recording a surprise 1\u20130 win over Scotland at Hampden Park with a single Ian Rush goal. A 3\u20130 win over Spain at the Racecourse Ground meant that Wales could secure qualification by beating Scotland in their final qualification game at Ninian Park, though a draw would not be enough. The game ended in a 1\u20131 draw after a late Davie Cooper penalty cancelled out Mark Hughes's opener; Southall got a hand to the penalty, but could not keep it out. However, the result of the game was put into perspective when Scotland manager Jock Stein suffered a heart attack at the end of the game and died shortly afterwards."]}]}}
