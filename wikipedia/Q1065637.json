His subjects have included Christopher Marlowe, Arthur Rimbaud, Leonardo da Vinci, Thomas Nashe and William Shakespeare. He is a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature.\nNicholl was educated at King's College, Cambridge. Awards include the Daily Telegraph young writer award in 1972, which gave him tickets to the Caribbean, as a result of which he visited Colombia. \nSince his early work he has shown an interest in counterculture. In 1974 he was the winner of the Sunday Times Young Writer Award for his account of an LSD trip entitled 'The Ups and The Downs', and he has since written about such topics as the drug trade (for example in The Fruit Palace) and the Elizabethan underworld (for example in The Reckoning). \n\nBesides his literary output, Nicholl has also presented documentary programmes on television.\nHe has lectured in Britain, Italy and the United States. He also lectures on Martin Randall Travel tours.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Christopher Marlowe", "response": ["Marlowe is alleged to have been a government spy. Park Honan and Charles Nicholl speculate that this was the case and suggest that Marlowe's recruitment took place when he was at Cambridge. In 1587, when the Privy Council ordered the University of Cambridge to award Marlowe his degree as Master of Arts, it denied rumours that he intended to go to the English Catholic college in Rheims, saying instead that he had been engaged in unspecified \"affaires\" on \"matters touching the benefit of his country\".This is from a document dated 29 June 1587, from the National Archives \u2013 Acts of Privy Council. Surviving college records from the period also indicate that, in the academic year 1584\u20131585, Marlowe had had a series of unusually lengthy absences from the university which violated university regulations. Surviving college buttery accounts, which record student purchases for personal provisions, show that Marlowe began spending lavishly on food and drink during the periods he was in attendance; the amount was more than he could have afforded on his known scholarship income."]}, {"page": "Leonardo da Vinci", "response": ["Houssaye postulated that the unusually large skull was an indicator of Leonardo's intelligence; author Charles Nicholl describes this as a \"dubious phrenological deduction.\" At the same time, Houssaye noted some issues with his observations, including that the feet were turned toward the high altar, a practice generally reserved for laymen, and that the skeleton of  seemed too short. Art historian Mary Margaret Heaton wrote in 1874 that the height would be appropriate for Leonardo.

According to Charles Nicholl this places the play firmly in the Elizabethan period when the problem of magic (\"liberation or damnation?\") was a matter of debate, and when Renaissance occultism aimed at a furthering of science.
