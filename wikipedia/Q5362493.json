Many of her novels originated as magazine serials and not published in book form.In June 1889, Mrs Humphry Ward's open letter \"An Appeal Against Female Suffrage\" was published in The Nineteenth Century with over a hundred other female signatories against the extension of Parliamentary suffrage to women. Inflamed by this \"most despicable piece of treachery ever perpetrated towards women by women\", Corbett wrote and published New Amazonia.While New Amazonia was the most explicitly feminist of her novels, it was not the only one to deal with the position of women in society. Her novel When the Sea Gives Up Its Dead (1894) features one of the earliest female detectives in fiction, Annie Cory, and is itself preceded by Adventures of a Lady Detective around 1890, possibly published in a periodical. Her writing was not universally well received, but Hearth and Home listed her along with Arthur Conan Doyle as one of the masters of the art of the detective novel.", "link_mentions": {}}}
