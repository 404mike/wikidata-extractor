Many of her novels originated as magazine serials and not published in book form.In June 1889, Mrs Humphry Ward's open letter \"An Appeal Against Female Suffrage\" was published in The Nineteenth Century with over a hundred other female signatories against the extension of Parliamentary suffrage to women. Inflamed by this \"most despicable piece of treachery ever perpetrated towards women by women\", Corbett wrote and published New Amazonia.While New Amazonia was the most explicitly feminist of her novels, it was not the only one to deal with the position of women in society. Her novel When the Sea Gives Up Its Dead (1894) features one of the earliest female detectives in fiction, Annie Cory, and is itself preceded by Adventures of a Lady Detective around 1890, possibly published in a periodical. Her writing was not universally well received, but Hearth and Home listed her along with Arthur Conan Doyle as one of the masters of the art of the detective novel.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Feminist science fiction", "response": ["It was closely followed by other feminist utopian works, such as Elizabeth Burgoyne Corbett's New Amazonia: A Foretaste of the Future (1889).

Set during the antebellum South, it follows the life of a mixed race woman with mostly white ancestry and records the hopes of many African Americans for social equality\u2014of race and gender\u2014during Reconstruction. Unveiling a Parallel (1893) features a male protagonist who takes an \"aeroplane\" to Mars, visiting two different \"Marsian\" societies; in both, there is equality between men and women. In one, Paleveria, women have adopted the negative characteristics of men; in Caskia, the other, gender equality \"has made both sexes kind, loving, and generous.\"Suzanne Romaine, Communicating Gender, London, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates/Taylor & Francis, 1998; pp. 331-2. Two American Populists, A.O. Grigsby and Mary P. Lowe, published NEQUA or The Problem of the Ages (1900), which explores issues of gender norms and posited structural inequality. This recently rediscovered novel displays familiar feminist SF conventions: a heroine narrator who masquerades as a man, the exploration of sexist mores, and the description of a future hollow earth society (like Mizora) where women are equal."]}, {"page": "Matriarchy", "response": ["*Elizabeth Burgoyne Corbett's New Amazonia: A Foretaste of the Future is an early feminist utopian novel (published 1889), which is matriarchal in that all political leadership roles in New Amazonia are required to be held by women, according to Duangrudi Suksang.Suksang, Duangrudi, Overtaking Patriarchy: Corbett's and Dixie's Visions of Women, in Utopian Studies, vol. 4, no. 2 (1993), pp. 74\u201393 (available via JStor)."]}, {"page": "1889 in literature", "response": ["*Elizabeth Burgoyne Corbett \u2013 New Amazonia"]}, {"page": "List of feminist literature", "response": ["* New Amazonia, Elizabeth Burgoyne Corbett (1889)"]}, {"page": "New Amazonia", "response": ["New Amazonia: A Foretaste of the Future is a feminist utopian novel, written by Elizabeth Burgoyne Corbett and first published in 1889.Matthew Beaumont, \"'A Little Political World of My Own': the New Woman, the New Life, and New Amazonia,\" Victorian Literature and Culture, Vol. 35 No. 1 (2007), pp. 215-32.Darby Lewes, Dream Visionaries: Gender and Genre in Women's Utopian Fiction, 1870\u20131920, Tuscaloosa, AL, University of Alabama Press, 1995; p. 142.
