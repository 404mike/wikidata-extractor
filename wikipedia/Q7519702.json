He kept 16 clean sheets from August 2003 to February 2004; including five clean sheets in six matches during November 2003. He sustained an injury in February 2004, which meant QPR signed Lee Camp on loan to cover in his absence, and his Camp's form ultimately kept Day out of the team when he returned. Day was an unused substitute in QPR's 3\u20131 win against Sheffield Wednesday, a victory that ultimately secured automatic promotion back to the Championship. Day returned to the first-team for the club's return to the Championship during the 2004\u201305 season, playing 33 games. He was dropped in January 2005 in favour of loanee Simon Royce, and was, as a result, allowed to move to Preston North End on a one-month loan deal. He made his Preston debut in a 2\u20130 defeat to Nottingham Forest, as well as making five more appearances for the Lancashire club; keeping two clean sheets during his time there."]}, {"page": "Alan Julian", "response": ["Ahead of the 2009\u201310 campaign, manager Mark Stimson admitted he was undecided as to whether Julian or Simon Royce would start in the club's opening fixture of the season. Julian ultimately started in the club's 5\u20130 home win against Swindon Town on the first day of the season. After three straight defeats in the space of a week with Gillingham conceding seven goals, Julian was replaced by Royce ahead of the club's League Cup game against Blackburn Rovers. After the game, Julian only featured twice in the space of four months, both appearances coming in Football League Trophy fixtures. Julian handed in a transfer request in November 2009 as a result of a lack of first-team appearances. However, Gillingham received no offers for the player, with manager Mark Stimson saying \"I haven't had a phone call. He's been on the loan circuit for four to six weeks and I haven't had a call. You don't just say I'm on the transfer list and six teams come in for you\". He remained at Gillingham and after appearing in Gillingham's 2\u20131 away loss at Huddersfield Town in December 2009, Julian remained as a first choice goalkeeper until the end of the season. The club went the whole season without an away victory and were relegated back to League Two on the final day of the season following a 3\u20130 defeat to Wycombe Wanderers. Julian made 33 appearances during the 2009\u201310 season, keeping eight clean sheets."]}, {"page": "Gino Padula", "response": ["After leaving Wigan in 2001 and spending a year in Argentina his most successful spell came at QPR, where he became somewhat of a cult hero. Padula was signed in 2002 by then QPR manager Ian Holloway who he had worked with during his spell at Bristol Rovers. He initially found it hard to break into the first team. Padula made his debut for the club as a substitute against Barnsley on 17 August 2002. His first start for QPR came on 2 November 2002 against Port Vale, however in the first half goalkeeper Simon Royce was sent off and substitute goalkeeper Fraser Digby was brought on for Padula. He eventually got his chance due to injuries from January 2003, and he finally started to display his tough slide tackling and steely determination. Padula became an overnight fan-favourite and one of the first names on the team sheet. As his confidence grew, he became more and more attacking and his prowess from dead balls became legendary with the QPR faithful. He scored his first goal for the club against Port Vale, the same team he was disappointingly substituted off against months earlier."]}, {"page": "Jake Cole", "response": ["Cole was born in Hammersmith, London. He was the second choice goalkeeper at Queens Park Rangers for a number of years, being understudy to Nick Culkin, Chris Day, Paul Jones, Simon Royce and Lee Camp, but was praised by John Gregory as being a model professional. He played for Hayes, AFC Wimbledon, Farnborough Town, Oxford United and Barnet on loan during his six years there. Towards the end of the 2006\u201307 season he became first choice goalkeeper after Lee Camp was recalled from his loan spell to Derby County."]}, {"page": "2007\u201308 Queens Park Rangers F.C. season", "response": ["|  Simon Royce"]}]}}
