His Wisden obituary described him as \"an allround cricketer of sterling merit\".\nHis Cricinfo profile, meanwhile, declares that \"More than any other player, Arnold was responsible for the elevation of Worcestershire to first-class status.\"  With his eighteen tons and well nigh 1,000 wickets in the County Championship, \"his adopted county [... could] take on any opponent\".  Arnold bowled at upwards of medium pace, with variations, and seamed the ball consistently.  He took full toll advantage of his physical stature, bowling with an upright action and, like Bill Bowes, obtaining considerable lift off the wicket.  This was an especially effective ploy on wickets afflicted by rain.  He swung the ball substantially, especially away from the bat.\nAs a batsman, Arnold had a strong command over almost every stroke in the book \u2014 most of them he played with considerable power \u2014 and an impressively dense defence.  He was a fine slips fieldsman with a safe pair of hands.  A tough cricketer, he was the only batsman who put up a fight when his team fell for a dismal 43 against Yorkshire in 1900.\nHe was a member of three Test series-winning England teams, the most noteworthy of which came under the captaincy of Plum Warner in 1903\u201304, a series he kicked off with the removal of openers Reggie Duff and Victor Trumper before the score had reached double figures.  He also contributed a great deal to the Fourth-Test victory: although dismissed for a pair, he took four wickets in the first innings and dismissed Trumper twice.\nHis nephews John Price and William Price both had brief first-class careers with Worcestershire.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Worcestershire County Cricket Club", "response": ["*5th: 393 by Ted Arnold and William Burns v.

Contrary to expectations before the tour, the English won the series and the Ashes three Tests to two. Hill trailed Trumper and Noble in the series averages, making 276\u00a0runs at 27.60 without ever getting to 100 in an innings. In the First Test, Hill was at the centre of what Wisden described as a \"very regrettable and indeed disgraceful [crowd] demonstration\". Batting with Trumper, Hill had run well past the stumps at the bowler's end for a fourth run. The English return gave the Australian pair an opportunity for an overthrow. Hill had to run the entire length of the pitch. Albert Relf at mid-on gathered and threw to the wicket-keeper, Dick Lilley who removed the bails and appealed for the run out. Umpire Bob Crockett gave Hill out. Hill could not believe the decision as the ball had passed behind him when he slid his bat to make his ground. The crowd were also convinced that Hill was not out and began to hoot, chanting \"Crock!, Crock!, Crock!\" Bottles were thrown onto the surrounding cycle track and the English captain Plum Warner threatened to take his team from the ground. At the end of the day, Crockett required a police escort when leaving the ground. Hill's best performance of the series was at his home town, Adelaide, in the Third Test. Hill scored 88 before being dismissed by Ted Arnold, caught by the wicket-keeper. Australia won the Test by 216\u00a0runs."]}, {"page": "Hugh Trumble", "response": ["After playing in one Test match against the South African team on a stopover when returning from England to Australia, Trumble retired from Test cricket, aged 35. When Australia lost to the English tourists in the First Test in Sydney in 1903\u201304, Trumble was persuaded to return for the Second Test under the captaincy of Noble. He was immediately successful taking 4\u00a0wickets for 107\u00a0runs in the first innings and 5 for 34 in the second, but was unable to prevent England from winning the Test by 185\u00a0runs Selected for the remaining four Tests, his 24\u00a0wickets in four\u00a0Tests made Trumble the most successful Australian bowler in the series. The writer Roland Perry described Trumble's final Test match as \"the most dramatic and memorable farewell performance ever by a bowler\". In front of his home town supporters in Melbourne, he took 7\u00a0wickets for 28\u00a0runs, including a hat-trick, to bowl Australia to victory; Wisden describing his bowling in the second innings as \"practically unplayable\". The hat-trick, his second in Test cricket, consisted of the dismissals of Bernard Bosanquet, Plum Warner and Dick Lilley on 7 March. He went on to take the wicket of Ted Arnold, ending the match and his career in international cricket."]}, {"page": "Arthur Fielder", "response": ["Whilst strictly a tail-end batsman, he scored an undefeated 112, his only first-class century, against Worcestershire at Amblecote batting at number 11 and shared a partnership of 235 for the tenth wicket with Frank Woolley who scored 185.

After acting for a short period as curate to Bishop Stretch at Newcastle, New South Wales, he was given the difficult parish of Stockton, New South Wales on the other side of the harbour, then much overloaded with debt. Waddy tackled his task with enthusiasm, wrote his first book, a short one on confirmation, Come for Strength, published in London in 1904, and by the middle of the same year had succeeded in paying off the parish debts. His energy was boundless, as in this year he wrote various tracts, gave over 40 lantern lecture averaged over six services a Sunday in his own parish, travelling about 30 miles on his bicycle, became bishop's chaplain and secretary of the clerical society, and also managed to fit in some very successful cricket. In December 1903 at West Maitland against Plum Warner's English eleven which included such well-known bowlers as Hurst, Len Braund, Ted Arnold, Bernard Bosanquet and Fielder, he made 93 and 102.
