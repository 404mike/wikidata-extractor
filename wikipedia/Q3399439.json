Bradley Pritchard was signed from non-league Hayes & Yeading United Football Club and has excelled in midfield, with Yann Kermorgant forming a formidable strike partnership alongside Wright-Phillips. Captain Johnnie Jackson has been a talisman all season despite numerous injuries, and Chris Solly, a product of the youth academy has made the right back berth his own. Clever loan signings were made throughout the season including Hogan Ephraim, Darel Russell, Dany N'Guessan and the return of Lee Cook. Charlton finished strongly into the second half of the 2011\u201312 season and sealed promotion back to the Championship as champions of League One.

He had a \"car crash\" beginning to the 2010\u201311 season, after being dropped by manager Andy Scott due to a poor performance during pre-season. He spent the early months of the season behind Simon Moore and loanees Alex McCarthy and Ben Hamer in the pecking order and appeared only in cup matches. After starting his first league game of the season against Bournemouth on 2 November 2010, he cemented his place in the team. Brentford's League Cup and Football League Trophy runs were the highlights of his season, helping the Bees to win four penalty shootouts to send them to the fourth round of the League Cup and the final of the Football League Trophy. He missed the Football League Trophy Final at Wembley Stadium and the rest of the season with a dislocated right shoulder suffered in March 2011.

Following a poor run of results and with a relegation into non-league football a possibility, Butcher was sacked on 11 December 2007 and Scott was named caretaker manager. After three wins, one draw and one loss from his opening five games, Scott was named as the club's permanent manager on 4 January 2008. Seven wins and two draws from a 9-match spell between late December 2007 and mid-February 2008 raised the Bees to 11th position, but hopes of a playoff finish were thwarted by a run of just four wins from the final 15 matches of the season. Scott signed a new five-year contract during the 2008 off-season and an overhaul of the squad and the shrewd loan signings of goalkeeper Ben Hamer, centre back Alan Bennett and forwards Jordan Rhodes and Billy Clarke contributed to Brentford winning the 2008\u201309 League Two championship in Scott's first full season in management. During the season he was named the 2008 BBC Radio London Manager of the Year and won the April 2009 League Two Manager of the Month award.
