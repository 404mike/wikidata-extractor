Though born far from the centres of political and religious power, he had risen rapidly in the church during the reign of Edward VI, culminating in his nomination as Bishop of London; the death of the King prevented his taking up the post, and, along with other Marian exiles, Grindal sought refuge in continental Europe during the reign of Mary I. Upon Elizabeth's accession, Grindal returned and resumed his rise in the church, culminating in his appointment to the highest office.\nHe was a supporter of Calvinist Puritanism.The late 16th century was a time of great change in the English church, following the Elizabethan settlement. Although Grindal historically was not regarded as a particularly notable church leader, his reputation has been revived by modern critical scholarship, which maintains he had the support of his fellow bishops and set the course for the development of the English Church in the early 17th century.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Book of Common Prayer", "response": ["Hundreds of Protestants fled into exile\u2014establishing an English church in Frankfurt am Main. A bitter and very public dispute ensued between those, such as Edmund Grindal and Richard Cox, who wished to preserve in exile the exact form of worship of the 1552 Prayer Book; and those, such as John Knox the minister of the congregation, who regarded that book as still partially tainted with compromise. Eventually, in 1555, the civil authorities expelled Knox and his supporters to Geneva, where they adopted a new prayer book, The Form of Prayers, which derived principally from Calvin's French La Forme des Pri\u00e8res. Consequently, when the accession of Elizabeth I re-asserted the dominance of the reformed Church of England, there remained a significant body of more Protestant believers who were nevertheless hostile to the Book of Common Prayer. John Knox took The Form of Prayers with him to Scotland, where it formed the basis of the Scottish Book of Common Order."]}, {"page": "July 6", "response": ["*1583 \u2013 Edmund Grindal, English archbishop (b. 1519)"]}, {"page": "Pembroke College, Cambridge", "response": ["|Edmund Grindal"]}, {"page": "Thomas Cranmer", "response": ["When Elizabeth I came to power in 1558 she restored the Church of England's independence from Rome under the Elizabethan Religious Settlement. The church that she re-established represented, in effect, a snapshot of the Edwardian Church from September 1552. Thus the Elizabethan Prayer Book was basically Cranmer's 1552 edition but without the \"Black Rubric\". In the Convocation of 1563 the Forty-Two Articles which were never adopted by the Church were altered in the area of eucharistic doctrine to form the Thirty-Nine Articles. Most of the exiles returned to England and resumed their careers in the Church. To some like Edmund Grindal, an Archbishop of Canterbury during Elizabeth's reign, Cranmer provided a shining example whose work should be upheld and extended."]}, {"page": "Christ's College, Cambridge", "response": ["|Edmund Grindal"]}, {"page": "1519", "response": ["** Edmund Grindal, Archbishop of Canterbury (d. 1583)"]}, {"page": "John Knox", "response": ["In a letter dated 24 September 1554, Knox received an invitation from a congregation of English exiles in Frankfurt to become one of their ministers. He accepted the call with Calvin's blessing. But no sooner had he arrived than he found himself in a conflict. The first set of refugees to arrive in Frankfurt had subscribed to a reformed liturgy and used a modified version of the Book of Common Prayer. More recently arrived refugees, however, including Edmund Grindal, the future Archbishop of Canterbury, favoured a stricter application of the book. When Knox and a supporting colleague, William Whittingham, wrote to Calvin for advice, they were told to avoid contention. Knox therefore agreed on a temporary order of service based on a compromise between the two sides. This delicate balance was disturbed when a new batch of refugees arrived that included Richard Cox, one of the principal authors of the Book of Common Prayer. Cox brought Knox's pamphlet attacking the emperor to the attention of the Frankfurt authorities, who advised that Knox leave. His departure from Frankfurt on 26 March 1555 marked his final breach with the Church of England.; "]}, {"page": "1583", "response": ["* July 6 \u2013 Edmund Grindal, Archbishop of Canterbury (b. 1519)"]}, {"page": "1575", "response": ["* July 26 \u2013 Edmund Grindal succeeds Matthew Parker as Archbishop of Canterbury."]}, {"page": "John Whitgift", "response": ["In August 1583 he was appointed Archbishop of Canterbury to replace Edmund Grindal, who had been placed under house arrest after his disagreement with Queen Elizabeth over \"prophesyings\" and died in office.

Although he wrote to Elizabeth remonstrating against the alienation of church property, Whitgift always retained her special confidence. In his policy against the Puritans and in his vigorous enforcement of the subscription test he thoroughly carried out her policy of religious uniformity."]}]}}
