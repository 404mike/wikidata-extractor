The group has identified new vectors of BTV that were previously thought to be of low epidemiological importance in transmission of the virus, resulting in better risk assessment for BTV and similar diseases in the northern Palaearctic regions.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of people with surname Carpenter", "response": ["* Simon Carpenter, British entomologist"]}]}}
