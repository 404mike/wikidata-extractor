Albert Spencer, 7th Earl Spencer inherited the estate after his father Charles' death in 1922. Albert became a well-known art connoisseur and was a trustee of the Wallace Collection, chairman of the Royal School of Needlework, a Fellow of both the Society of Antiquaries of London and the Royal Society of Arts, and from 1961 until 1969 he was Chair of the Advisory Council of the Victoria and Albert Museum. Despite his keen interest in art, he began selling off paintings and other items to pay off debts. In the 1930s he was forced to sell off a small but immaculate Hans Holbein portrait of Henry VIII (now at the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum, Madrid) for \u00a310,000 to finance his son's education. Although a large sum at the time, by 1998 it was reputed to be worth around \u00a350\u00a0million. Unlike many country houses in Britain during the Second World War which were occupied by the military and converted into hospitals, training camps and barracks, Althorp Palace remained untouched, thanks to Albert who saw to it that they used the stables instead. A Wellington bomber crashed near the ice house during the war, killing all of its crew. Due to Spencer House being in a dangerous location in London during the Blitz, many of the pieces of furniture and items of the house were brought to Althorp for safekeeping, including numerous fireplaces and doors with curled \"S\" doorknobs, a signature of the Spencer family dating to the 18th century."]}, {"page": "Earl Spencer (peerage)", "response": ["*****15px Albert Spencer, 7th Earl Spencer (1892\u20131975)"]}, {"page": "Earl Howe", "response": ["Several other members of the Curzon-Howe family have also gained distinction.
