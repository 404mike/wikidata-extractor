Gr\u00fcneberg was born in Wuppertal\u2013Elberfeld in Germany. He obtained an MD from the University of Bonn, a PhD in biology from the University of Berlin and a DSc from the University of London. He arrived in London in 1933, at the invitation of J.B.S. Haldane and Sir Henry Dale.\nHe was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1956. Most of his work focused on mouse genetics, in which his speciality was the study of pleiotropic effects of mutations on the development of the mouse skeleton.\nHe was the first person to describe siderocytes and sideroblasts, atypical nucleated erythrocytes with granules of iron accumulated in perinuclear mitochondria. This he reported in the journal Nature. The Gr\u00fcneberg ganglion, an olfactory ganglion in rodents, was first described by Hans Grueneberg in 1973.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of geneticists", "response": ["*Hans Gr\u00fcneberg (1907\u20131982), British mouse geneticist and blood cell biologist"]}, {"page": "Hans Grueneberg", "response": ["#REDIRECT Hans Gr\u00fcneberg "]}, {"page": "Grueneberg ganglion", "response": ["The Grueneberg ganglion (GG), also written as Gr\u00fcneberg ganglion is an olfactory subsystem located at the entrance of the nasal cavity of rodents.
