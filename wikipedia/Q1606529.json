He plays as a midfielder.\nBorn in the north Liverpool suburb of Fazakerley, Kissock joined Premier League club Everton's youth system aged seven; progressing quickly, he began playing for England's under-16 team in November 2004, aged only 14. He appeared for England's under-18 side in September 2006, aged 16, and signed professionally for Everton on 12 December 2006. He became a regular player for the club's under-18 and reserve teams and was an unused substitute for the first team on numerous occasions. Following loan spells at Scottish Premier League club Gretna \u2013 for whom he made his professional debut on 9 February 2008 \u2013 and English fourth-tier side Accrington Stanley the following year, he was released by Everton at the end of the 2008\u201309 season.\nKissock briefly returned to Scotland at the start of the next season, joining Hamilton Academical in August 2009 but was let go by the club after three appearances in four months. He trialled at various English Football League clubs during the 2010\u201311 pre-season but failed to win a contract, leading him to begin the season playing for amateur side Newton in the eleventh-tier West Cheshire League. He transferred to ninth-level Formby in October 2010 and only two months after that moved up another four levels when he signed for Southport of the Conference Premier, having impressed the club's manager, Liam Watson. Kissock performed well for Southport during the second half of 2010\u201311, and after playing four matches in the 2011\u201312 season signed for Luton Town on 26 August 2011.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Formby F.C.", "response": ["*Ex-Everton starlet John Paul Kissock had a two-month spell restarting his career at Formby in autumn 2010."]}, {"page": "2007\u201308 Everton F.C. season", "response": ["|  John Paul Kissock"]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 Everton F.C. season", "response": ["| John Paul Kissock"]}, {"page": "List of Hamilton Academical F.C. players", "response": ["|John Paul Kissock||||2009||3||0||"]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Everton F.C. season", "response": ["| John Paul Kissock || Released || 1 July 2009 || Free"]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Hamilton Academical F.C. season", "response": ["|  John Paul Kissock"]}, {"page": "Gary Martindale", "response": ["Despite turning Formby's fortunes around, including signing notable players like John Paul Kissock, Adam Farley and John Lawless, he felt unsupported by the club and after internal restructuring of the club he resigned in January 2011.
