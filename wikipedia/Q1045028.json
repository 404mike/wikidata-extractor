Pinafore and Trial by Jury and ending with the original production of The Emerald Isle. From 1903 to 1904 he played a small part (the First Watchman) in The Cherry Girl at the Vaudeville Theatre in London. From 1904 and for eight years he made annual appearances at the London Ballad concerts held at both the Queen's Hall and Royal Albert Hall.  He performed in numerous concerts at most of the leading provincial British theatres. In 1907 he joined \"Randall Jackson's Concert Party\" at the Oval in Margate in which he had Hugh E. Wright, Carrie Tubb and Fred Wildon as fellow artists, and it was this association which gained him his eventual popularity. For several summers Ritte ran his own companies in the Worthing, Westgate and Swanage areas of the south coast of England. In 1912 the Ariel Grand record catalogue made the following appraisal of his career:Since his first appearance as a member of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, twelve years ago, Mr. Ritte's career has been an uninterrupted success. He has appeared before enthusiastic audiences in all the principal London concert halls and is well known in oratorio in the largest provincial centres."]}, {"page": "List of fellows of the Royal College of Music", "response": ["* Carrie Tubb, 1976"]}, {"page": "Caroline Elizabeth Tubb", "response": ["#REDIRECT Carrie Tubb"]}, {"page": "Caroline Tubb", "response": ["#REDIRECT Carrie Tubb"]}]}}
