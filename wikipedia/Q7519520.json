Best known for his large-scale public art works for urban spaces in Australia and overseas, Perry's practice incorporates numerous sculptural techniques including casting, carving and fabrication. His works have been created in bronze, concrete, granite, steel, aluminium, wood and stone. Perry's commissioned pieces are predominantly site-specific, and often address elements of environment and public space with a gentle humour.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "White Mischief (film)", "response": ["\"There is a difference between fact and truth,\" said producer Simon Perry. \"You can be truthful without being factual.

The album was released on 3 July 2006, exclusively in Japan, following an argument with Costa's record label preventing a release in the United Kingdom. It failed to chart highly in Japan, and shortly after, Costa was dropped from the label. Only one single was released from the album, Do You Ever Think of Me, which peaked at #19 on the UK Singles Chart."]}, {"page": "List of RMIT University people", "response": ["| Simon Perry", "|Mr. Simon Perry.
