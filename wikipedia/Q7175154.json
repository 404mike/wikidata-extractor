Seeking to reflect his involvement in the anti-Vietnam War movement, he turned from painting to photomontage to better address his political views. He is best known for the images he created for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) in the 1970s\u201380s including a d\u00e9tournement of John Constable's The Hay Wain called \"Haywain with Cruise Missiles\".Because many of the left-wing organisations and publications he used to work with have disappeared, Kennard has turned to using exhibitions, books and the internet for his work.Kennard has work in the public collections of several major London museums and the Arts Council of England. He has his work displayed as part of Tate Britain's permanent collection and is on public view as part of 2013's rehang A Walk Through British Art.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "VRML", "response": ["The term VRML was coined by Dave Raggett in a paper called \"Extending WWW to support Platform Independent Virtual Reality\" submitted to the First World Wide Web Conference in 1994, and first discussed at the WWW94 VRML BOF established by Tim Berners-Lee, where Mark Pesce presented the Labyrinth demo he developed with Tony ParisiMedia Machines Management and Peter Kennard.
