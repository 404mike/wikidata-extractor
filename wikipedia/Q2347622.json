Those who see language as being mostly innate, such as psychologist Steven Pinker, hold the precedents to be animal cognition, whereas those who see language as a socially learned tool of communication, such as psychologist Michael Tomasello, see it as having developed from animal communication in primates: either gestural or vocal communication to assist in cooperation. Other continuity-based models see language as having developed from music, a view already espoused by Rousseau, Herder, Humboldt, and Charles Darwin. A prominent proponent of this view is archaeologist Steven Mithen. Stephen Anderson states that the age of spoken languages is estimated at 60,000 to 100,000 years and that: Researchers on the evolutionary origin of language generally find it plausible to suggest that language was invented only once, and that all modern spoken languages are thus in some way related, even if that relation can no longer be recovered\u00a0... because of limitations on the methods available for reconstruction."]}, {"page": "Otto Jespersen", "response": ["Jens Otto Harry Jespersen (; 16 July 1860 \u2013 30 April 1943) was a Danish linguist who specialized in the grammar of the English language.

All of them suggested that the object and its grooves could have a utilitarian purpose. Zilh\u00e3o hypothesized that the object could be used to produce pigment and that the grooves could be byproducts of this process. Wynn suggested that the object could be a result of \"someone passing time with a stone tool and a pebble\". Mithen also stated that our symbolic understanding of the object does not imply that it was considered as such by early humans who produced it, because the cognitive processes for symbolic thinking we use today may differ from the ones used by early humans."]}, {"page": "Mithun", "response": ["*Steven Mithen"]}, {"page": "Cognitive archaeology", "response": ["Several early books helped popularize the idea that the ancient mind could be investigated and characterized, including Merlin Donald's Origins of the Modern Mind (1991), Steven Mithen's The Prehistory of Mind (1996), and David Lewis-Williams's The Mind in the Cave (2002).", "* Steven Mithen"]}, {"page": "List of cognitive scientists", "response": ["* Steven Mithen (ideational cognitive archaeology)"]}, {"page": "Marek Kohn", "response": ["In 1999, Kohn had proposed, together with the archaeologist Steven Mithen, the so-called \"sexy hand-axe hypothesis.\"Steven Mithen, The Singing Neanderthals, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, London, 2005, pp. 188-191."]}, {"page": "Steve Mithen", "response": ["#REDIRECT Steven Mithen"]}, {"page": "Cognitive fluidity", "response": ["#REDIRECT Steven Mithen"]}, {"page": "Anthropomorphism", "response": ["This anthropomorphic art has been linked by archaeologist Steven Mithen with the emergence of more systematic hunting practices in the Upper Palaeolithic.

Archeologist Steven Mithen contends that it is common for religious practices to involve the creation of images and symbols to represent supernatural beings and ideas. Because supernatural beings violate the principles of the natural world, there will always be difficulty in communicating and sharing supernatural concepts with others. This problem can be overcome by anchoring these supernatural beings in material form through representational art. When translated into material form, supernatural concepts become easier to communicate and understand.Symbolism and the Supernatural Due to the association of art and religion, evidence of symbolism in the fossil record is indicative of a mind capable of religious thoughts. Art and symbolism demonstrates a capacity for abstract thought and imagination necessary to construct religious ideas. Wentzel van Huyssteen states that the translation of the non-visible through symbolism enabled early human ancestors to hold beliefs in abstract terms.", "The use of red ocher as a proxy for symbolism is often criticized as being too indirect. Some scientists, such as Richard Klein and Steven Mithen, only recognize unambiguous forms of art as representative of abstract ideas. Upper paleolithic cave art provides some of the most unambiguous evidence of religious thought from the paleolithic. Cave paintings at Chauvet depict creatures that are half human and half animal."]}, {"page": "Homo erectus", "response": ["In 1999, British science writers Marek Kohn and Steven Mithen said that many hand axes exhibit no wear and were produced en masse, and concluded that these symmetrical, tear-drop shaped lithics functioned primarily as display tools so males could prove their fitness to females in some courting ritual, and were discarded afterwards. However, an apparent lack of reported wearing is likely due to a lack of use-wear studies, and only a few sites yield an exorbitant sum of hand axes likely due to gradual accumulation over generations instead of mass production."]}, {"page": "The Institute for Cultural Research", "response": ["* professor of archaeology Steven Mithen (Problem-solving and the Evolution of Human CultureSteven Mithen, Monograph Series No. 33, Problem-solving and the Evolution of Human Culture, The Institute for Cultural Research, 1999, , .)"]}, {"page": "Up from Dragons", "response": ["* Does not discuss the work of Leda Cosmides and John Tooby nor Steven Mithen."]}, {"page": "Deep history", "response": ["A review of Smail's book by Steven Mithen, professor of Archaeology at the University of Reading, is sympathetic to some parts of his thesis, but says  \"Smail may not be as closely acquainted with the ongoing debates in prehistoric archaeology as he might be\", and on Smail's critical description of historians: \"I have to take Smail\u2019s word for it that such historians still exist, as after more than a century of prehistoric archaeology they would be an astonishing throwback to another age\".Steven Mithen, \"When We Were Nicer\", a review of On Deep History and the Brain by Daniel Lord Smail, London Review of Books, Vol. 30 No. 2, 24 January 2008, pages 24-25"]}]}}
