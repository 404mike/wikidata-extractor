Reviewing the first episode for the same newspaper on the day after transmission, Jim White praised Andrew Davies for \"injecting into the proceedings a pace and energy which at last provides a visual setting to do justice to the wit of the book. With everyone slinging themselves about at high speed (the dances, in a first for the genre, actually involve a bit of sweat), it looks like people are doing something you would never have suspected they did in Austen's time: having fun.\"", "Pride and Prejudice received BAFTA Television Award nominations for \"Best Drama Serial\", \"Best Costume Design\", and \"Best Make Up/Hair\" in 1996.
