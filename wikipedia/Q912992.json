He appeared in several films (including several in the Carry On series) but was more frequently on television, a regular role being Robert Onedin in the BBC TV serial The Onedin Line. He also played character roles in many other TV programmes such as Coronation Street, The Baron, Z-Cars, Market in Honey Lane, The Bill, Heartbeat, Danger Man, Goodnight Sweetheart and Last of the Summer Wine, in which he played Cyril Gridley, which was his final appearance.

It is possible that he also used the pseudonym Tristano.Multiple copies of the catalogues for this artist were found in hist studio and the style appears similar. He did not produce sexually explicit works until he had retired from reliance on mainstream comic work. Homosexual sex and images portraying and encouraging it were illegal in the period before 1967. During the 1970s he was working for the Mansell Collection,The Mansell Collection is now part of Getty Images - see http://creative.gettyimages.com/source/services/rights.aspx  a commercial picture archive which was housed at 42 Linden Gardens; he was living there with actor Brian Rawlinson in an outbuilding that served as his own studio.

He tried, with the help of John Embry to have them returned but failed. Some of his work remained with his \"dowager partner\" Brian Rawlinson in a space he used for drawing but eventually the studio (at Linden Gardens), filled with piles of magazines and detritus, needed clearing. With no idea what to do with the explicit drawings he had been left, Rawlinson's houseclearers were due put them in the same skip as the rest of the contents. Fortunately Bill's model for his character Drum, Robert Bremner (1947-2003), a fellow member with Bill of the London  MSC leather club heard about it with only a day to spare. With Rawlinson's blessing and the help of artist Guy Burch, they sifted the material to extract an archive of work and related ephemera. Bremner also died of AIDS but the works were kept together by Burch but the explicit nature of many drawings made display or publication difficult.See 'The Bill Ward Archive, Photography & Culture, Vol 7, issue 3, 2014 Burch supplied information for \u2018Comics Unmasked, Art and Anarchy in the UK' at the British Library,Curated by Paul Gravett and John Harris Dunning, \u2018Comics Unmasked, Art and Anarchy in the UK', British Library (May\u2013August 2014), Ward is discussed on pages 127/8 of the accompanying publication; see  http://www.bl.uk/art-and-anarchy-in-british-comics which featured him as one of two British gay erotic comic illustrators.
