His appointment inevitably prompted comparison with the Toshack era which began nearly 20 years earlier. Despite relegation in 1996, the club reached the final of the 1997 Third Division promotion play-offs but lost to Northampton Town, whose goal came from a re-taken free kick by John Frain in the final minute.

Typically, the finals of the three divisions would take place, one match per day, across the second bank holiday weekend in May.  During that first \"Wembley Weekend\" in 1990, spectators totalled almost 130,000, including nearly 73,000 for the Second Division final between Swindon Town and Sunderland.  This was markedly greater than the largest crowd during the 1989\u201390 First Division season, around 47,000, at Old Trafford to watch Manchester United against Arsenal, and roughly the same as the attendance at the 1990 FIFA World Cup Final.  All of the second tier play-off finals played between 1990 and 1999 attracted crowds in excess of 55,000 with half of them seeing more than 70,000 in attendance.  During that period, the record attendance for the third-tier decider came at the 1999 Football League Third Division play-off Final when 76,935 people watched Manchester City beat Gillingham in a penalty shoot-out after scoring twice in the final two minutes to force the match into extra time.  The former Wembley Stadium record for attendance in the fourth tier play-off final came in 1997 when a crowd of 46,804 witnessed Northampton Town's John Frain score in the last minute of the match to beat Swansea City 1\u20130."]}, {"page": "Ian Clarkson", "response": ["At Northampton, he linked up with former Birmingham City teammates John Gayle, Dean Peer and manager Ian Atkins, soon to be joined by John Frain.

In August 1998, he suffered a badly broken tibia in a match against Lincoln City. Though he made a couple of appearances for Northampton at the start of the 1999\u20132000 season, it appeared that he was no longer fit enough to compete at that level, and that his league career was over at the age of 28."]}]}}
