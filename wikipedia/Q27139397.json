Fair play protocol dictates that the ball be passed to the Baintree goalkeeper, Tom King, on resumption of play, but Oliver Norburn instead lobbed the ball past King to score an equalising goal. A fracas resulted but the goal was allowed to stand after security staff separated the players and management, and Bower refused to allow Braintree to walk through and score. Bower went on to defend his decision, stating that King \"stood there with his arms in the air and allowed the ball to into the net. It put us in a really difficult position whether we should allow them to score or not but we decided no. I think their keeper was trying to be clever and had simply let the ball go in.\" King responded that he was \"bewildered\" by Bower's statement, and speaking on the incident itself said that: \"It is one of those things that will be remembered for a long time, I'll be remembered for a long time and it will carry on forever\". The following week, Guiseley chairman Phil Rogerson released a statement recognising the fair-play convention had not been followed: \"... myself, Mark [Bower] and the club find the situation most regrettable and not in line with the general ethos of Guiseley AFC. Fair play is and always has been at the heart of the club. The decision to continue playing as normal after the goal was taken on the spur of the moment and under extreme pressure, not helped at all by the heated atmosphere.\" On 21 August 2016, Bower was dismissed by Guiseley, after the team lost their first five matches of 2016\u201317."]}, {"page": "2016\u201317 Millwall F.C. season", "response": ["|31||Tom King||GK||||Croydon||||15||0||Crystal Palace||31 August 2014||Free||Undisclosed", "|31||||GK||Tom King             ||1||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||1||0||0"]}, {"page": "Brandon Thomas-Asante", "response": ["On 28 November 2020, he received the first red-card of his career for a reckless foul on Newport County goalkeeper Tom King, as Salford exited the FA Cup at the second round.
