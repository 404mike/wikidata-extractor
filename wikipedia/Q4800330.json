Through his connections with Stanford, Parry, Vaughan Williams, Gervase Elwes, and through the imitations or arrangements of Irish songs by Hamilton Harty, Arthur Somervell or Charles Wood he was very active in promoting this movement in English and Anglo-Irish art-song. He did this not by succumbing to the imitation of country singing, but by investing whatever he sang with all the principles of good singing - of long and intelligent phrasing, clean, natural attack and diction, lively faithfulness to rhythm and timing, and the powerful engagement of imagination in interpretation. These values were explained in his 1912 book Interpretation in Song which ran through many editions and rapidly became a classic. His advocacy of art-song was indefatigable. His early accompanist Henry Bird gained an appointment as accompanist to the Chappell Ballad Concerts after his very successful partnership with Plunket Greene in the Hungarian Songs of Francis Korbay.Harold Simpson, 'Ch.
