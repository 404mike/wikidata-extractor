Further investigation revealed he had damaged cartilage in his knee, which required an operation.Finch, p. 86. Having had three weeks' recuperation and a cortisone injection, he was restored to the Ipswich squad in time to play in the third round UEFA Cup home leg against FC Barcelona. Ipswich won the fixture 3\u20130, and even though he suffered a reaction in his knee, he insisted he was able to play in the away leg. Robson disagreed, and Beattie was left out of the side for the game; Ipswich were knocked out on penalties.Finch, p. 87. Cortisone injections became commonplace for Beattie, who returned to the team in time for the FA Cup fourth-round victory against Hartlepool.Finch, p. 89. Although Ipswich's form in the league was poor, they were safe from relegation by the time they faced West Bromwich Albion in the FA Cup semi-final at Highbury, a game for which Beattie was given the all-clear. A 3\u20131 victory saw Ipswich into the final, yet the next day his knee was once again swollen and his participation in the final was in jeopardy.Finch, p. 90. According to Beattie, \"the boss secretly told me that if I felt fit enough to play then I was in\".Finch, p. 92. Robson did not announce the Cup final team until the last minute: it included a formation change to include five midfielders and Paul Mariner as a lone striker \u2013 and Beattie in defence.Finch, pp. 93\u201394. Roger Osborne's late goal for Ipswich was the only score of the game, and they won the trophy. Beattie had three cortisone injections to get through the final.Finch, p. 100.

Arsenal kicked off and were initially dominant with as O'Leary shot past the post from an Alan Hudson cross.  At the other end, a Mariner strike from a Woods header beat Jennings' dive but was off-target.  After fifteen minutes, Talbot was beginning to establish himself as the main power in midfield.  Along with Kevin Beattie making runs from defence, Ipswich began to over-run their opposing midfielders Liam Brady and Hudson, forcing them to play deeper in their own half.  Twenty-year-old David Geddis caused the Arsenal left side of defence problems, passing to Woods on the right side of the pitch whose cross was missed by Osborne but struck well by Mariner only for him to see it ricochet off the bar.  Geddis then saw his bouncing shot saved by Jennings and Arsenal's Macdonald cleared another attempt.  The first half ended goalless.  In the 52nd minute, Mariner set Wark up by the edge of the Arsenal penalty area: the Scotsman's firm shot struck the upright, once again leaving Jennings stranded.  O'Leary initiated a rare attack for the London club and created an opportunity for Sunderland who saw the ball saved at his feet by Ipswich's goalkeeper Cooper.  Brady was substituted in the 65th minute for Rix. Woods and Talbot then combined to set Wark up once again but his first-time shot rebounded off the post.  It was Burley's turn next to trouble the Arsenal goal: his header from Woods' cross produced an exceptional save from Jennings to keep the scores level at 0\u20130.  With thirteen minutes left, Geddis took the ball and advanced towards the opposition penalty area, and drove in a low shot at a difficult angle.  Arsenal's Young stuck out a foot to defend it and deflected the ball to Roger Osborne who shot past Jennings with a first-time left-footed shot from  to put Ipswich ahead.
