Milo Talbot, to Edgar Bonham-Carter (later Sir), then the Legal Secretary of the Sudan government. Talbot felt that \"year by year much valuable information was lost or buried in inaccessible files because there was no convenient medium for recording it in the country.\" This was a problem that might be corrected with a journal. Bonham-Carter took the proposal to J.W. Crowfoot, the Director of the Education Department, and a meeting chaired by Sir Lee Stack was held where it was decided to start a journal. Stack became the Journal's patron.
