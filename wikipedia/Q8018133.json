Black noted some of the early difficulties of publishing The Far East: the deleterious effects of the local weather on photographs, the inferiority and rarity of proper photographic chemicals and paper, and the poor quality (in his eyes) of the images produced by Japanese photographers. Until 1873, Black was unable or unwilling to pay the going rate for photographs, which must have particularly discouraged Western photographers from contributing. However, from 1873 on he began to pay an \"honorarium\" for the photographs he published.Bennett, PiJ, 147\u2013148. From July 1874, The Far East was published in Shanghai. Accordingly, the photographic subjects appearing in the newspaper were now predominantly Chinese.Bennett, OJP, 94.
