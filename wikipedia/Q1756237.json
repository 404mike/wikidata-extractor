A competitor at the 2012 Summer Olympics, she won a silver medal at the 2010 Commonwealth Games, a bronze medal at the 2011 World Archery Championships, and was the women's individual recurve champion at the World Field Archery Championships in 2016. Oliver announced her retirement from the British national archery team in 2017.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Naomi Folkard", "response": ["Folkard secured her place as one of three British female archers for the 2012 Olympic Games in April 2012 at the national trials held in Lilleshall. She and teammates Williamson and Amy Oliver exited early from the women's team event after defeat to Russia in the opening round, having finished eleventh out of twelve nations in the ranking round. Folkard entered the elimination rounds of the women's individual event as the highest-placed Briton in forty-second place. Following a first-round victory over Russia's Kristina Timofeeva, which was praised by The Telegraph as a \"fitting riposte\" following the earlier British loss in the team event, Folkard bowed out to Mexico's Mariana Avitia in the second round.", "Folkard won silver medal in the women's team recurve at the 2010 Commonwealth Games, together losing with Alison Williamson and Amy Oliver in the final by a single point to the hosts India."]}, {"page": "Alison Williamson", "response": ["Williamson did not have a strong showing in London. She finished the preliminary ranking round for the women's individual event in forty-seventh place, a position the Evening Standard described as \"disappointing\", before being eliminated by Mongolia's Bishindee Urantungalag in the opening elimination round. Her participation in the women's team event also ended at the first stage after she and her teammates Naomi Folkard and Amy Oliver were defeated by Russia. After her defeat to Urantungalag, Williamson said she was undecided about whether to challenge for selection to a seventh Olympic Games in 2016.", "Williamson won two silver medals at the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi, reaching the final of both the women's individual and women's team recurve events. Despite the controversy over the conduct of the Indian crowd during the final of the team event, in which the spectators were criticised for distracting Williamson's teammate Amy Oliver while she shot her final arrow of the match, Williamson acknowledged that the opposing Indian team were \"worthy winners\" of the gold medal, saying \"if you'd offered us silver on the plane on the way over here we possibly would have taken it\". Her second silver medal came in the final of the individual competition, with India's Deepika Kumari defeating Williamson by six set points to zero."]}, {"page": "1987 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["* 10 July \u2013 Amy Oliver, archer"]}, {"page": "England at the 2010 Commonwealth Games", "response": ["|  || EnglandNaomi FolkardAmy OliverAlison Williamson || Archery || Women's recurve team || 8 October"]}, {"page": "Deepika Kumari", "response": ["In London Olympics 2012, Deepika Kumari lost against Amy Oliver of Great Britain in the opening round, attributing a relatively poor performance to fever and high winds."]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 2012 Summer Olympics", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Amy Oliver", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Naomi FolkardAmy OliverAlison Williamson"]}, {"page": "Archery at the 2010 Commonwealth Games \u2013 Women's recurve team", "response": ["| 2 ||  || Naomi FolkardAmy OliverAlison Williamson"]}, {"page": "Archery at the 2010 Commonwealth Games \u2013 Women's recurve individual", "response": ["The final marked the third time Kumari and Williamson had met competitively. Kumari had won both of their previous match-ups, in the women's team recurve event two days prior and in the second stage of the Archery World Cup in Antalya, Turkey four months earlier. The match was a lop-sided affair, and in a performance described by The Hindu as \"flawless\", Kumari outshot the Englishwoman in a straight sets victory, scoring a maximum 30 points in the third set while Williamson faltered with a score of 7 on her last arrow. Kumari's win earned her a second Commonwealth gold medal in three days following India's victory in the women's team recurve event two days before, making her the most successful recurve archer at the Games.

Chekrovolu Swuro and the highly rated 18-year old Deepika Kumari joined 2008 Olympian Bombayla Devi Laishram to spearhead the Indian contingent, the trio having together won silver medal in the women's team event at the 2011 World Archery Championships after defeating the reigning champions South Korea in the semi-finals.", "World number one Deepika Kumari suffered a shock defeat in the opening elimination round which began on the morning of 30 July, losing to 57th seed Amy Oliver of Great Britain in four sets. Kumari blamed the strong winds for her performance and did not appear comfortable in the cool and overcast conditions, failing to shoot a single arrow in the 10-ring. Her defeat was described by the Press Trust of India as a big setback in India's pursuit of Olympic medals, while the BBC lauded Oliver's victory as her greatest career win. Oliver would later lose to Indonesia's Ika Yuliana Rochmawati in the following round. Oliver's teammates Alison Williamson and Folkard fared little better in front of the home crowd, Williamson losing in the first knockout round to Bishindee Urantungalag of Mongolia, while Folkard was eliminated by Mexico's Mariana Avitia in the 1/16 elimination round.
