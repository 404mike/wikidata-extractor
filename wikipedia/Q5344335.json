Instone died in 1932, Manville died in 1933, and Martin, who in January 1934 replaced Alexander Roger, Manville's replacement, as chairman, retired in 1935. In May 1936 Laurence Pomeroy was fired as managing director of Daimler with immediate effect. Daimler was not paying dividends and the 1936 BSA shareholders' meetings were stormy. Attempted solutions had included the Lanchester acquisition and the introduction of smaller cars, the lower-priced 10\u00a0hp Lanchester and its matching but six-cylinder stable-mate the Daimler Fifteen (later DB17 and DB18) introduced in the early thirties. This particular product line as the Lanchester Fourteen and Daimler Conquest was to run through to almost the very end."]}, {"page": "Knight engine", "response": ["Having virtually ignored two written approaches by engineer Edward Manville, a director of Daimler, Knight changed his mind and decided to try to interest English manufacturers in his engine. In 1907 Knight went with one of his cars to London where he managed to see fellow-American Percy Martin, also a director of Daimler. Daimler's engineers tested the engine and the results were sufficiently encouraging for Daimler to set up a secret team to fully develop Knight's concept. On the project's completion, though, it was no longer \"Wholly Knight\". Knight obtained a British patent for his modified engine on June 6, 1908. In September Daimler announced that \"Silent Knight\" engines would be installed in some of its 1909 models."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1918 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Edward Manville"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1922 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["|Edward Manville"]}, {"page": "List of Old Gowers", "response": ["*Sir Edward Manville M.Inst.
