Stone was sentenced to three life sentences with a tariff of 25 years.Stone maintains his innocence and continues to contest his conviction. His legal team argues that serial killer Levi Bellfield could possibly be the true perpetrator of the attack. In May 2021 a bootlace, which had been tied around Megan's neck in the course of the crime, was found by Kent police who had previously mislaid it. It was suggested it could yield DNA proving Bellfield, or another individual, was the killer, but the lace was contaminated during examinations by the Forensic Science Services in 1998 and contains DNA from different sources.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Michael Stone (murder case)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Michael Stone (criminal)"]}, {"page": "Kent Police", "response": ["On 4 July 1996, Lin Russell, her daughters Megan and Josie, and their dog were attacked with a hammer in Chillenden.

Bellfield denied the confession. A 2017 BBC Two programme, The Chillenden Murders, in which a team of independent experts re-examined the evidence, supported the idea Bellfield should be investigated for the killings. The legal team of Michael Stone, convicted of the crimes, maintains Bellfield is the true perpetrator of the attack. In December 2017, The Sunday Times reported that Bellfield's ex-wife had told investigators in the Delagrange case that he was with her on the day for her 25th birthday, the time of the Russell murders, and had spent all day in Twickenham and Windsor, 100 miles away from the scene of the murders which occurred at around 4.30pm. It was an alibi which detectives found credible.
