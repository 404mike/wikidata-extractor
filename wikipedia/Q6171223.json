Decorated for bravery on the Western Front, he became one of the leading poets of the First World War. His poetry both described the horrors of the trenches and satirised the patriotic pretensions of those who, in Sassoon's view, were responsible for a jingoism-fuelled war.Siegfried Sassoon: The Making of a War Poet, Jean Moorcroft Wilson (Duckworth, 2004). Sassoon became a focal point for dissent within the armed forces when he made a lone protest against the continuation of the war in his \"Soldier's Declaration\" of 1917, culminating in his admission to a military psychiatric hospital; this resulted in his forming a friendship with Wilfred Owen, who was greatly influenced by him.  Sassoon later won acclaim for his prose work, notably his three-volume fictionalised autobiography, collectively known as the \"Sherston trilogy\".", "The discovery in 2013 of an early draft of one of Sassoon's best-known anti-war poems had biographers saying they would rewrite portions of their work about the poet. In the poem, 'Atrocities,' which concerned the killing of German prisoners by their British counterparts, the early draft shows that some lines were cut and others watered down. The poet's publisher was nervous about publishing the poem, and held it for publication in an expurgated version at a later date. Said Sassoon biographer Jean Moorcroft Wilson on learning of the discovery of the early draft: \"This is very exciting material. I want to rewrite my biography and I probably shall be able to get some of it in. It's a treasure trove.\"", "*Jean Moorcroft Wilson, Siegfried Sassoon: The Making of a War Poet (1998).

There is also an implication (given the pun on Rivers's name along with other factors) that Rivers was more to Sassoon than just a friend.  Sassoon called him \"father confessor\", a point that Jean Moorcroft Wilson picks up on in her biography of Sassoon; however, Rivers's tight morals would have probably prevented a closer relationship from progressing:"]}, {"page": "Isaac Rosenberg", "response": ["* Jean Moorcroft Wilson \u2013 Isaac Rosenberg, poet and painter (1975)"]}, {"page": "David Bomberg", "response": ["Bomberg was one of the most audacious of the exceptional generation of artists who studied at the Slade School of Art under Henry Tonks, and which included Mark Gertler, Stanley Spencer, C.R.W.

Bomberg painted a series of complex geometric compositions combining the influences of cubism and futurism in the years immediately preceding World War I; typically using a limited number of striking colours, turning humans into simple, angular shapes, and sometimes overlaying the whole painting a strong grid-work colouring scheme. He was expelled from the Slade School of Art in 1913, with agreement between the senior teachers Tonks, Frederick Brown and Philip Wilson Steer, because of the audacity of his breach from the conventional approach of that time.Jean Moorcroft Wilson \u2014 Isaac Rosenberg (2008)", "* Jean Moorcroft Wilson, Isaac Rosenberg: The Making of a Great War Poet.

He noted down the grass, the willows, the willowherb and meadowsweet, the blackbirds and silence interrupted by the hiss of steam at these two stops. The poem itself was written later: he began making notes for it the following January, and created several versions of the poem before it was ready for publication.
