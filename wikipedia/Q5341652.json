Smithers and Nichols were aligned with William Lazenby, Edward Avery, and Charles Carrington, in a small and tightly interwoven group of late Victorian publishers heavily involved in the production and distribution of pornography in London and Paris.  Smithers worked extensively in the 1890s with Wilde and his circle, as is indicated by the title of James Nelson's book on Smithers, Publisher to the Decadents. Lisa Sigel claims that unlike most pornographers, who were eager to preserve their anonymity for reasons of respectability and safety, Smithers \"embrace[d] public scrutiny\" and managed to earn some renown for encouraging and orchestrating the collaboration of Wilde and Beardsley on Salom\u00e9.Sigel, Lisa, Governing Pleasures: Pornography and Social Change in England, 1815-1914. Piscataway: Rutgers University Press, 2002. From 1892 to 1894 Smithers and Nichols released, among other projects, a series of pornographic novels under the imprint Erotika Biblion Society. Teleny was published 1893 as part of this series in a limited edition of 200 copies, with significant edits by Smithers, including the omission of an introduction and a change in the setting from London to Paris.  Smithers promoted it in an advertisement, sent to a select group of subscribers, as \"undoubtedly, the most powerful and most cleverly written erotic Romance which has appeared in the English language during recent years,\" authored by \"a man of great imagination\u2026[who] has conceived a thrilling story.\" And: \"It is a most extraordinary story of passion, and while dealing with scenes which surpass in freedom the wildest license, the culture of its author\u2019s style adds an additional piquancy and spice to the narration\". Judged by the traditional literary standards of plot, character, suspense, variation, style, etc. which usually find pornography lacking, Teleny stands apart from its contemporaries as the \"most powerful and most cleverly written erotic Romance.\""]}, {"page": "The Whippingham Papers", "response": ["The Whippingham Papers is a Victorian work of sado-masochistic pornography by St George Stock (a probable pseudonym, also credited with The Romance of Chastisement) and published by Edward Avery in December 1887.
