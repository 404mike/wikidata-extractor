His tenure was brief, and in June 1959 Bodle was appointed manager. The club had no money, the team had become accustomed to losing, and the spectators stopped coming. The season ended in relegation with a Third Division record number of 123 goals conceded. The directors chose to dismiss Bodle and appoint captain Jimmy Harrower as player-manager in his place, purportedly because the club were unable to afford a non-playing manager. In 1974, after 14 years of running a grocery shop, Bodle returned to football management with Burton Albion. He took them to the semi-final of the FA Trophy in 1975 and resigned in February 1976."]}, {"page": "Football League Third Division North versus South representative matches", "response": ["| Jimmy Harrower"]}, {"page": "Harrower", "response": ["*Jimmy Harrower (footballer, born 1935) (1935\u20132006), Scottish footballer", "*Jimmy Harrower (footballer, born 1924) (1924\u20131992), Scottish footballer"]}, {"page": "James Harrower", "response": ["James or Jimmy Harrower may refer to:", "* Jimmy Harrower (footballer, born 1935) (1935\u20132006), Scottish footballer", "* Jimmy Harrower (footballer, born 1924) (1924\u20131992), Scottish footballer"]}]}}
