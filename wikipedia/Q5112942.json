The track was a hit single later in the year for Cliff and the title of his 1974 live album.\nNeil started in the mid-sixties as a singer with Manchester group the Chuckles. In 1972 he released a solo album Where I Belong on RAK Records.He worked as an actor during the 1970s playing Jesus in Jesus Christ Superstar and Ginger in Leaping Ginger at the Royal Exchange Theatre Manchester before working full-time as a record producer. His film roles included The Sex Thief (1973), Eskimo Nell (1975), and Three for All (1975), and in 1976 he starred in the British TV series Rock Follies. In 1977 and 1978 he starred in two of the three 'Adventures of...' British sex comedy films: Adventures of a Private Eye and the final film in the trilogy, Adventures of a Plumber's Mate. In addition to taking the lead role, he wrote and sang the theme songs to the two films.

Lodge made a defining shift in his songwriting on this album, leaving his trademark high-energy rock music, and instead gravitating towards slow love ballads such as \"Lean on Me (Tonight)\" (though he had earlier contributed some songs in this gentler vein such as \"Emily's Song\" for his daughter in 1971, \"Survival\" in 1978, and \"Talking Out of Turn\" in 1981), while his more powerful songs continued with \"Magic\" and the Lennonesque \"Shadows on the Wall\". This gentler trend continued on the two successive Moodies albums. Hayward wrote the driving two-part piece \"Say What You Mean.\" Tony Visconti produced some of the tracks on \"Keys\", as did Christopher Neil and Alan Tarney. The ensuing tour saw them invited to play at the Montreux Jazz Festival. A non-album Hayward-Lodge song cut at these sessions, \"Highway\", was included on the \"Say It with Love\" twelve-inch single and on a later box set and compilation album, while the vinyl album did not include their song \"Once is Enough\" as on the compact disc version."]}, {"page": "1987 in film", "response": ["* Train of Dreams directed by John N.

There was change too in the songs.
