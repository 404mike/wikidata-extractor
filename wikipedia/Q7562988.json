She had claimed that he \"performed an unwelcome sexual act in her presence after she was invited up his room at the Savoy hotel 'to watch some rushes'\" for The Hour of The Pig. She called the experience \"the single most damaging thing that's happened in my life\". Some of her scenes in the UK version of the film (including an explicit sex scene), as well as a short voice over, were trimmed or cut. It has been suggested that Weinstein had done this as retribution for her attempted rejection of his advances."]}, {"page": "An Actor's Life For Me", "response": ["* Sophie Dix \u2013 Stage Manager"]}, {"page": "Thief Takers", "response": ["* Sophie Dix as DC Angela Prudhoe (Pilot)"]}, {"page": "Screen Two", "response": ["Cast: Colin Firth, Ian Holm, Donald Pleasence, Amina Annabi, Nicol Williamson, Michael Gough, Harriet Walter, Jim Carter, Lysette Anthony, Justin Chadwick, Sophie Dix, Michael Cronin, Elizabeth Spriggs, Vernon Dobtcheff, Charles Dale and Roy Evans"]}, {"page": "Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse cases", "response": ["#Sophie Dix, actress"]}, {"page": "Sophie Emma Clare Dix", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sophie Dix"]}, {"page": "Military Wives (film)", "response": ["* Sophie Dix as Beatrice"]}, {"page": "A Song for Jenny", "response": ["*Sophie Dix as Sharon"]}]}}
