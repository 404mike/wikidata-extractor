The land system consisted of lines of fixed stations (substantial buildings) with two large, moveable arms pivoted on an upright member.  Such a system was inconvenient to install on board a ship.  Flag semaphore provided an easy method of communicating ship-to-ship or ship-to-shore when the distances were not too great.  According to Alexander J. Field of Santa Clara University, \"there is evidence\" that Popham based his telegraph on the French coastal stations used for ship-to-shore communication.Alexander J.

Many of the codepoints of flag semaphore match those of the Foy-Breguet electrical telegraph, also descended from the French optical telegraph.  Although based on the optical telegraph, by the time flag semaphore was introduced the optical telegraph had been entirely replaced by the electrical telegraph some years previously.Signals at Sea, Information sheet no 104, Library and Information Services, The National Museum: Royal Navy: Portsmouth, accessed and archived 26 October 2019."]}, {"page": "Commander-in-Chief, Africa (Royal Navy)", "response": ["*Commodore Sir Home Riggs Popham, (1806\u201307)"]}, {"page": "British Army during the Napoleonic Wars", "response": ["The naval commander of the expedition, Admiral Home Riggs Popham then conceived the idea of occupying the Spanish Plate River colonies.
