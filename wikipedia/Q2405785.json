Among other duties,  she often served as First Lady due to her mother's preference for devoting her time to other political activities and worthy causes. She also served as an unofficial secretary to her father.  Her responsibilities included answering mail, arranging appointments, and writing presidential speeches.  She became alarmed at the obvious deterioration of the President's health and insisted on seeking the advice of a cardiologist.  When he was diagnosed with congestive heart failure, she was the only family member who was informed.  She petitioned to be included in the Yalta Conference as his aide-de-camp, believing that she could best protect her father, seeing to it that he followed the doctor's orders of diet and rest. She attended the conference, along with Sarah Churchill, daughter of Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and Kathy Harriman, daughter of W. Averell Harriman, Ambassador to Russia.  The Conference lasted from February 2, 1945, to February 11, 1945.  Anna was important to Roosevelt both personally and as aide-de-camp."]}, {"page": "Norman Hartnell", "response": ["*He Found a Star (1941) (dresses for Sarah Churchill and Evelyn Dall)"]}, {"page": "Stanley Donen", "response": ["Royal Wedding (1951) starred Astaire and Jane Powell as a brother-sister American dancing team performing in England during the royal wedding of Elizabeth and Philip in 1947. Judy Garland was originally cast in the lead role, but was fired for absenteeism due to illness and replaced by Powell. In the film, Powell's love affair with a wealthy Englishman (Peter Lawford) threatens to ruin the brother-sister act, while Astaire finds his own romance with another dancer (Sarah Churchill). The film is loosely based on Astaire's real-life career with his sister and early dancing partner, Adele Astaire, who retired after marrying an English lord in 1932 and includes one of Astaire's best remembered dance sequences, the \"You're All the World to Me\" number where he appears to defy gravity by dancing first on the walls and then on the ceiling. The shot was achieved by building the set inside a steel-reinforced rotating cylindrical chamber, with the camera attached to the cylinder. Both Astaire and the film's lyricist Alan Jay Lerner claimed that they thought of the idea. The film included music by Lerner and Burton Lane and was released in March 1951."]}, {"page": "Tommy Kirk", "response": ["I did 37 of those in the next five years.

In 1949, Sarah Churchill married photographer Anthony Beauchamp on the island. Among the thousands of honeymooners to visit were George and Barbara Bush. The island's residential community also grew in numbers and in stature, with some lot prices pushing into the millions of dollars by the end of the 20th century."]}, {"page": "Sarah Churchill", "response": ["Sarah Churchill may refer to:", "*Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough (1660\u20131744), wife of John Churchill, Queen Anne's agent", "*Sarah Churchill (actress) (1914\u20131982), British actress"]}, {"page": "Rachael Stirling", "response": ["|Sarah Churchill"]}, {"page": "Hallmark Hall of Fame", "response": ["Playhouse was hosted by Sarah Churchill and was a weekly half-hour.
