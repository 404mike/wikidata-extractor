Matthews, Jack Buchanan, and Ronald Squire. He admitted that he was drawn to acting because of a \"great need to be liked and admired\". He was eventually fired by the Shuberts at the end of the summer season when he refused to accept a pay cut because of financial difficulties caused by the Depression. His unemployment was short-lived, however; impresario William B. Friedlander offered him the lead romantic part in his musical Nikki, and Grant starred opposite Fay Wray as a soldier in post-World War I France.
