Yates's Black Chalk. Yates's characters are even wittier than Tartt's, but then, as undergraduates at Oxford University, they would be, wouldn't they?\" and concludes that \"Like a locked-room mystery, a boarding-school or college novel reduces the world to a compartment filled with quasi-incestuous conflict. By adding gamesmanship and mental illness to the mix, Yates has achieved something new and impressive.\"Black Chalk' review: A school game turns deadly, Washington Post, Aug. 18, 2015.", "Marcel Berlins also praises the novel: \"Black Chalk is an inventive and intricate psychological puzzle thriller that mystifies, torments, disturbs, beguiles and occasionally irritates...A touch pretentious, in parts overcomplicated, Black Chalk is nevertheless a powerfully intelligent debut for Christopher J.
