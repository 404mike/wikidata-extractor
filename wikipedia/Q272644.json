Jose Casanova, The Opus Dei Ethic, the Technocrats and the Modernization of Spain. February 1, 1983 Also, there were notable members of Opus Dei who were vocal critics of the Franco Regime such as Rafael Calvo Serer and Antonio Font\u00e1n, who was the first President of the Senate in Spain, following the adoption of a democratic Constitution. The German historian and Opus Dei member Peter Berglar calls any connection made between Opus Dei and Franco's regime a \"gross slander.\" At the end of Franco's regime, Opus Dei members were 50:50 for and against Franco, according to John Allen. Similarly \u00c1lvaro del Portillo, the former prelate of Opus Dei, said that any statements that Escriv\u00e1 supported Hitler were \"a patent falsehood,\" that were part of \"a slanderous campaign\". He and others have stated that Escriv\u00e1 condemned Hitler as a \"rogue\", a \"racist\" and a \"tyrant\".See  Opus Dei spokespersons also deny claims that Opus Dei members worked with General Pinochet. Various authors and researchers state that Escriv\u00e1 was staunchly non-political, and detested dictatorships.Julian Herranz, En las afueras de Jeric\u00f3: recuerdos de los a\u00f1os con san Josemar\u00eda y Juan Pablo II, Rialp 2008 Allen wrote that, compared with other Catholic organizations, Opus Dei's stress on freedom and personal responsibility is extraordinarily strong. There are many Opus Dei members who are identified with left-wing politics, including Ruth Kelly, Jorge Rossi Chavarr\u00eda, Mario Fern\u00e1ndez Baeza, Antonio Font\u00e1n, Mario Maiolo, and Jesus Estanislao."]}, {"page": "The Queen's College, Oxford", "response": ["* Ruth Kelly, former UK Cabinet and Government Minister"]}, {"page": "Barbara Castle", "response": ["In September 2008 Northern Rail, Blackburn with Darwen Borough Council and the PTEG (Passenger Transport Executive Group) named a train after her.
