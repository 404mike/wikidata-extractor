His patrons included high ranking naval officers, powerful businessmen, and members of Parliament.  Several upper crust boxing students and alumni from Cambridge University were boxing students of Langham when he lived in Cambridge and may have remained supporters of his club.  Tom Sayers found a worthy adversary to box and spar with at the club when his career was flagging.  Morning boxing matches for purses were staged in the club and sometimes in remote spots closer to Epsom, and were often preceded by lengthy late night meals followed by the Club's prized plum pudding.  Bouts inside the club sometimes featured boxers fighting in the nude, for the unique tastes of some of the aristocratic patrons.  Meals were famously consumed inside a regulation 24 square foot boxing ring, despite the tight fit as Langham acted as Master of Ceremonies.  Aristocratic patrons included James Grimston, known as Lord Verulam, a former member of both the House of Lords and Commons, Lord Caledon, and Admiral Lord Edward Russell.  Other wealthy patrons included Lord Robert Grimston, brother of James, Sir Robert Peel, amateur boxer and son of the Prime Minister, and Robert's brother Royal Navy Captain William Peel, also an accomplished amateur boxer.  Other distinguished patrons included Royal Navy Commander William Hope-Johnstone and Brown and Harris of the London Stock Exchange.  Jem Mace claimed to have once boxed Archibald William Douglas (1818-1856), the 8th Marquess of Queensbury, known as (Viscount Drumlanrig) at the Club.  Douglas had served as a former member of the House of Commons and was the father of John Douglas, credited with helping to establish boxing's modern Marquess of Queensberry Rules.List of patrons, location and details of the club in Thormanby, (1900) Boxers and their Battles; Antecdotal Sketches and Personal Recollections, London, R. A. Everett and Co., pg. 267-8.  The top rated boxers, Cambridge students, and aristocracy who frequented the Club cemented Langham's legacy, and place in society.    When Langham died, the fights and sparring matches staged there moved to retired boxer, club patron, and good friend Alex Keene's \"Two Tuns\" Tavern.Rum-Pum-Pas Club described in Staples, Arthur, \"The Ring\", Times Union, Brooklyn, New York, pg. 15, 1 May 1924"]}, {"page": "Edward Chandos Leigh", "response": ["Leigh started playing cricket as a boy at Stoneleigh Abbey after his father Lord Leigh, Lord Byron's schoolmate at Harrow, established a cricket ground at his country estate at Stoneleigh Abbey in 1839 for his eldest son William Henry Leigh who was attending Harrow.

A professional all-round cricketer, he began his 25 year association with the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in 1843, making his debut in first-class cricket for the club against Hampshire at Lord's. Throughout the 1840s, he played for a number of club sides and played his first-class cricket almost exclusively for the MCC, except for two appearances for an England XI in 1845 and 1847. He first played for Middlesex in 1850, debuting for the county in first-class matches against Surrey. He also made first-class appearances for several other teams, including the Players in the Gentlemen v Players match, for the South in the North v South fixture and for a United England Eleven amongst others. His four appearances for Middlesex were sporadic and spread over a period of twelve years, with his final appearance coming just two years before the formation of Middlesex County Cricket Club. It was for the MCC that he played the vast majority of his first-class matches for, making a total of 51 appearances between 1843\u201361. In these matches he scored 974 runs at an average of 12.02, with a high score of 60. Standing 5 foot 6 inches tall and bowling right-arm roundarm slow, he also took 91 wickets for the MCC at a bowling average of 11.28, with best figures of 8 for 44. He took five wickets in an innings on five occasions and took ten wickets in a match once. His appearances in club cricket continued into the 1850s and early 1860s, demonstrating that Royston was a sought after player, with him making guest appearances for the personal teams of many leading cricket figures of the day, including Sir Frederick Hervey-Bathurst, Robert Grimston and Roger Kynaston.
