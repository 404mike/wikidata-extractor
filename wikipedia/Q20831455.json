Her mathematical interests include higher category theory, and as a pianist she specialises in lieder and art song. She is also passionate about explaining mathematics to non-mathematicians to rid the world of math phobia, often using entertaining analogies with food and baking. Cheng is a scientist-in-residence at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Adjoint functors", "response": ["* \u2013 seven short lectures on adjunctions by Eugenia Cheng of The Catsters"]}, {"page": "Royal Society Prizes for Science Books", "response": ["* Beyond Infinity: An Expedition to the Outer Limits of the Mathematical Universe, Eugenia Cheng (Profile Books)"]}, {"page": "Martin Hyland", "response": ["Martin Hyland is best known for his work on category theory applied to logic (proof theory, recursion theory), theoretical computer science (lambda-calculus and semantics) and higher-dimensional algebra.
