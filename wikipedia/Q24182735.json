It has been reported that in her college years Han became obsessed with a line of poetry by the Korean modernist poet Yi Sang: \"I believe that humans should be plants.\" She understood Yi's line to imply a defensive stance against the violence of Korea's colonial history under Japanese occupation, and took it as an inspiration to write her most successful work, The Vegetarian. The Vegetarian was Han's first novel translated into English, although she had already attracted worldwide attention by the time Deborah Smith translated the novel into English. There has been some controversy over the translation of the novel, as scholars have detected mistakes in it; among other issues, there is concern that Smith may have attributed some of the dialogue to the wrong characters.

Speaking at the Seoul International Book Fair on 15 June 2016, Smith said that a translator \"must be unfaithful to some aspects in order to be faithful to others. I try to stay faithful to the spirit, and faithful to the letter as much as I can, without compromising the spirit.\" Talking about the process, Han said, \"Deborah usually sends me the file of her translation after she finishes, with notes and questions. And I send it back to her with my answers and notes. It is just like having a chat endlessly. I truly enjoy this process. I am lucky to have met Deborah, a wonderful translator who can render subtlety and delicacy.\" Smith has said that her first attempt at Korean translation involved \"looking up practically every other word in the dictionary\". Smith has translated some of Han's other works, including Human Acts (2016) and The White Book (2017).", "Boyd Tomkin, chairman of the 2016 Man Booker International Prize judging panel, lauded the book for its \"disturbing outlook on a subject of vast interest\", and Smith's \"creative effort for blending beauty and horror\".

Deborah Smith's perfectly judged translation matches its uncanny blend of beauty and horror at every turn.\"", "Julia Pascal, writing for The Independent said, \"It is the women who are killed for daring to establish their own identity.
