This led to an extension in the number of performances for it, increasing the overall number from twelve \u2013 the ten finalists from that year's series and two of the semi-finalists, Tracey Lee Collins and Anya Sparks \u2013 to twenty two, including matin\u00e9es, and a duet with Faryl Smith and Andrew Johnston.
