The tenant farmer from Stapleford in the Wylye Valley near Salisbury, Wiltshire applied the systematic breeding used in raising cattle to roses, and emphasised that his roses were raised scientifically from known parents. His hybrids, between Teas and Hybrid Perpetuals, were called Pedigree Hybrids of the Tea Rose. He is considered the father of the Hybrid Tea class. Important cultivars are the Hybrid Tea 'Lady Mary Fitzwilliam' (1882), a parent of 'Mme. Caroline Testout' and the Hybrid Perpetuals 'Captain Hayward' (1893) and 'Mrs. John Laing' (1887).\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Royal National Rose Society", "response": ["The public's growing interest in roses, specifically the new rose cultivars introduced at rose exhibitions, inspired the creation of the society's Gold Medal Award in 1883. Rose breeder and former wheat farmer, Henry Bennett, won the first and second Gold Medals awarded, with Rosa 'Her Majesty' (Hybrid Perpetual) in 1883 and Rosa 'Mrs. John Laing' (Hybrid Perpetual) in 1885. In later years, an important role of the society was to supervise trials of new rose varieties that were submitted to the society's test gardens by rose breeders from around the world. A committee of twenty judges evaluated the rose cultivars periodically throughout the season from June to September over two or three successive years. The Gold Medal was generally awarded each year to two or three roses of exceptional quality. There were several years when no roses would meet the strict guidelines for the award and no gold medal is awarded."]}, {"page": "Henry Bennett", "response": ["Henry Bennett or Bennet may refer to:", "*Henry Bennett (U.S. politician) (1808\u20131874), U.S. Representative from New York", "*Henry Bennett (rose hybridizer) (1823\u20131890), British pioneer in the systematic, deliberate hybridisation of roses", "*Henry Bennett (cricketer) (1869\u20131965), English cricketer", "*J.
