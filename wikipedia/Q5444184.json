He is often noted for his use of offal and other neglected cuts of meat as a consequence of his philosophy of nose to tail eating.  Following in the footsteps of his parents, Brian and Elizabeth Henderson, he trained as an architect at the Architectural Association in London. Most of his dishes are derived from traditional British cuisine and the wines are all French.\nChefs Anthony Bourdain and Mario Batali have both praised Henderson for his dishes, which optimise British food while making full use of the whole animal. A. A. Gill famously retracted his initial hostility to St John in the Sunday Times.Fergus is married to fellow chef Margot Henderson; the couple have three children.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Offal", "response": ["* Fergus Henderson, St John (London, England)"]}, {"page": "Signature dish", "response": ["* Fergus Henderson - roast bone marrow with parsley salad"]}]}}
