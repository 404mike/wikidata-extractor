In 1877 he bought a share in a packet steamer with his inheritance, using the profits to start up his own management company in 1880, R.P. Houston & Company.In 1892 he was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Liverpool West Toxteth, resigning on 26 April 1924 through appointment as Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds. He was created a Baronet, of West Toxteth in the City of Liverpool, in 1922.In 1924 he married Lucy, Lady Byron, widow of the 9th baron, who then became Lady Houston. Research published in 2020 outlined her seven-year pursuit of him. In his will, he left his wife the bulk of his fortune. When he died on his steam yacht Liberty on 14 April 1926, she became the second richest woman in England.\nUsing Houston's money his widow funded the first flight over Mount Everest and the development of the later-to-be-famous Supermarine Spitfire aircraft. She then purchased a weekly journal, the Saturday Review, in which she pursued a right-wing agenda to promote the strength of Britain and the Empire.", "link_mentions": {}}}
