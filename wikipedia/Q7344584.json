Charles Jencks called Lever House's curtain wall a step in \"penultimate development and acceptance\" of the International Style, while Robert Furneaux Jordan felt the building's court \"set a precedent that may lift New York to a new level among world capitals\". Furthermore, following Lever House's completion, numerous glass wall skyscrapers were built in New York City and elsewhere. The surrounding stretch of Park Avenue became developed with commercial buildings. Many of the residential structures on Park Avenue were replaced with largely commercial International Style skyscrapers during the 1950s and 1960s. Those structures included the Seagram Building, whose co-designer Philip Johnson specifically cited the construction of Lever House as a forebear."]}, {"page": "Robert Jordan (disambiguation)", "response": ["*Robert Furneaux Jordan (1905\u20131978), English architect, architectural critic and novelist"]}, {"page": "F.
