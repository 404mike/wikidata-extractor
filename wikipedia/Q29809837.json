The programme is the fourth programme in the franchise of the same name, and replaced Sooty Heights, with Cadell supported by co-presenter Vicki Lee Taylor, and Brenda Longman during the first series, and Sheila Clark for the remaining series. The programme focuses on the exploits of the titular character and his puppet friends in their running of the hotel, and features many elements used in previous programmes. The show saw the return of a puppet character from the franchise, as well as the creation of a new character.\nThe programme was originally produced by Gullane Entertainment, before the production company was bought up by HIT Entertainment following the first series. HIT's decision to cut costs and make changes to the programme, including using new puppets, resulted in several members of production leaving the programme, and Sooty being eventually cancelled in January 2004 due to falling viewing figures.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "The Sooty Show", "response": ["The Sooty Show is a British children's television series, created by Harry Corbett, and produced for the BBC from 1955 to 1967, and then for ITV from 1968 until 1992.

It was also felt that she made Soo sound too old.", "* Brenda Longman (1981\u20131992) - The second voice of Soo starting from the second series of the format change, following Majorie's retirement from the role, who also made frequent guest appearances as various characters within the show's sitcom format.
