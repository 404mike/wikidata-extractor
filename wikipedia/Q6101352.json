The game was played on 16 December 2006, finishing in a 4\u20134 draw at Aggborough. Kidderminster had raced into a three-goal lead, all three goals coming in the opening thirty minutes of the match, from James Constable, Alex Russell, and Iyseden Christie respectively. However, Vauxhall were level ten minutes into the second-half, scoring three quick-fire goals of their own. The home side then took the advantage once again through substitute Luke Reynolds. With Kidderminster defending their one-goal lead, Vauxhall's Lee Furlong scored an injury-time goal with a \"thunderous drive\" to ensure the game went to a replay. The replay, scheduled for 19 December, was postponed due to a frozen pitch. It was eventually played on 6 January 2007, with Kidderminster winning the game 4\u20130, with James Constable getting a hat-trick in the game. A 1\u20130 victory away at fellow Conference National side Exeter City followed in the Second Round a week later, with a first-half Iyseden Christie strike settling the match. The win meant that Kidderminster faced a home tie against Conference South side Braintree Town in the Third Round, drawing the game 0\u20130. Kidderminster won the replay 3\u20131. Despite having trailed to a first-half strike from Russ Edwards, Kidderminster hit back with three goals in four minutes to win the tie and progress to the Fourth Round. They secured a place in the semi-finals thanks to a 3\u20131 victory over Halifax Town on 24 February. Similarly to the victory at Braintree, Kidderminster had trailed at half-time courtesy of a late first-half goal \u2013 this time Halifax's Neal Trotman heading past the outstretched Scott Bevan. Kidderminster bounced back immediately in the second-half, with James Constable scoring his sixth goal of the tournament when he tapped in from close range after Michael Blackwood's initial shot had been saved. Goals from Gavin Hurren, and an injury-time strike from Russell Penn ensured a two-goal victory.", "The first-half started \"tentatively\", with Kidderminster looking the more likely side as the half progressed \u2014 \"controlling the midfield, and taking advantage of a deep-sitting Stevenage backline, Kidderminster started to find some penetration\". On the half-hour mark, Kidderminster took the lead, and it was Constable who supplied the end product, when he was on hand to stab home after Iyseden Christie's shot was blocked. Five minutes later, Kidderminster doubled their advantage \u2013 after a surging run, Constable fizzed in a low shot from the edge of the box, which nestled into the corner and beat the outstretched Alan Julian in the Stevenage goal. Kidderminster leading 2\u20130, referee Chris Foy blew his whistle for the half-time interval.", "Despite trailing 2\u20130, Stevenage manager Mark Stimson opted against making any changes at the interval, whilst Kidderminster also remained unchanged. Stevenage started the second period with \"much more purpose, showing greater thrust and belief\", with Mitchell Cole shooting wide after a mazy run. Six minutes into the second-half, Stevenage halved the deficit, Morison headed the ball down to Mitchell Cole, who produced a neat right-footed finish to beat Scott Bevan in the Kidderminster goal. Centre-back Santos Gaia spurned the opportunity to restore parity when his header narrowly missed the target on the hour mark. Stimson brought on Craig Dobson in place of Steve Guppy after 63 minutes, and ten minutes later, Dobson levelled the scores at two-apiece. Dobson latched on to a \"hopeful long punt\" from John Nutter and toe poked the ball past onrushing Bevan. Kidderminster responded by making an instant change, bringing on Andrew White for Iyseden Christie. However, it was Stevenage who would go on to complete a remarkable comeback with just two minutes of the game remaining. Stevenage right-back Barry Fuller produced a swinging cross that Morison hooked towards goal on the volley, Bevan saved the shot, but Morison reacted fastest to \"smash home the rebound and snatch the glory\".", "|FW ||22 || Iyseden Christie || || "]}, {"page": "List of Kidderminster Harriers F.C. seasons", "response": ["|Iyseden Christie", "|Iyseden Christie", "|Iyseden Christie"]}, {"page": "2002\u201303 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|22||align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Iyseden Christie"]}, {"page": "1997\u201398 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Iyseden Christie"]}, {"page": "2003\u201304 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|22||align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Iyseden Christie"]}, {"page": "1998\u201399 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Iyseden Christie"]}, {"page": "1996\u201397 Mansfield Town F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Iyseden Christie"]}, {"page": "List of Rochdale A.F.C. players (1\u201324 appearances)", "response": ["|Iyseden Christie"]}]}}
