Rycroft was replaced by Marcel Rocque. The Ferbey Four that would dominate the Brier for the next few years was complete. Ferbey made his return to the Alberta provincials in 1999.  While they didn't win, they did return in 2001 with a bang. They went on to win the Alberta final against Kevin Martin, 6\u20134, and then won the 2001 Nokia Brier as well beating Kerry Burtnyk of Manitoba 8\u20134 in the final. This sent the team to the 2001 Worlds where they lost both their semi-final game and the bronze medal game, which they gave up to P\u00e5l Trulsen of Norway. In 2002, Team Ferbey won their second straight provincial final, defeating Mike Vavrek 6\u20135. Ferbey then went on to win his fourth Brier, the 2002 Nokia Brier, which was his team's 2nd. They beat John Morris 9\u20134 in the final. This time, at the 2002 Worlds in Bismarck, North Dakota his team won the championship, beating the same P\u00e5l Trulsen, 10\u20135. After defeating Jamie King 10\u20133 in the 2003 Alberta final, Ferbey and his team would return to the Brier, in 2003 in Halifax, Nova Scotia. In the finals, they beat the home-town favourites Mark Dacey 8\u20134 in the finals. At the 2003 Ford World Curling Championship, his team won their 2nd world title, beating Ralph St\u00f6ckli of Switzerland 10\u20136 in the finals. The team won their fourth provincial title in 2004, defeating the Kurt Balderston rink in the final, 8\u20135. The 2004 Nokia Brier was a blip on his team's record. After returning to the Brier for the fourth straight year, an unprecedented feat especially considering the great number of good teams in Alberta, his team would bow out in the final. After a 10\u20131 round-robin record, Ferbey and his team lost out to the same team they beat the previous year, Mark Dacey of Nova Scotia, in a 10\u20139 game where Ferbey's team surrendered a lead. However, Team Ferbey did not give up, and their reign would not be over. In 2005, they once again won the Alberta championships, for a record fifth time, defeating the Jamie King rink 8\u20136 in an extra end.  The team once again won the 2005 Canadian championships, setting a record, as his team became the first to win four championships as a team. The final was against Nova Scotia again, albeit a different team, that of Shawn Adams. In another close game, team Ferbey pulled it out and won 5\u20134 in the final. His trip to the 2005 Men's Ford World Curling Championships were marked with struggles, as the team finished the round-robin with three losses\u00a0\u2013 tied for first with five other teams.
