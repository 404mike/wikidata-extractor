GameSpy awarded it with the title of \"Most Offensive Game of the Year\", calling it \"absolutely reprehensible\". They wrote that the game rewards players for \"causing mayhem\" and \"killing innocent people by the dozen\", ultimately questioning its appropriateness within the industry. The notoriety of Grand Theft Auto III resulted in American retailer Wal-Mart's decision to check the identification of purchasers who appeared to be under the age of 17 when purchasing mature titles. In an essay, assistant professor Shira Chess identified the lack of conclusion to player violence, due to the ability to respawn upon death or incarceration, and found that it denies the \"reality of mortality and simultaneously [forces] it on players\". When speaking about the game's depiction of violence, producer Leslie Benzies claimed that is intended to be comedic, and that the game is \"not meant to be taken seriously\".
