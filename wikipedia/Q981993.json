He is best known internationally for his starring role as Olympic athlete and missionary Eric Liddell, in the Oscar-winning 1981 film Chariots of Fire. He is also well known for his portrayal of Rev. Charlie Andrews in the 1982 Oscar-winning film Gandhi.\nCharleson was a noted actor on the British stage as well, with critically acclaimed leads in Guys and Dolls, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Fool for Love, and Hamlet, among many others. He performed numerous Shakespearean roles, and in 1991 the annual Ian Charleson Awards were established, particularly in honour of his final Hamlet. The awards reward the best classical stage performances in Britain by actors aged under 30.\nThe Houghton Mifflin Dictionary of Biography describes Charleson as \"a leading player of charm and power\" and \"one of the finest British actors of his generation\". Alan Bates wrote that Charleson was \"definitely among the top ten actors of his age group\". Ian McKellen said Charleson was \"the most unmannered and unactorish of actors: always truthful, always honest\".Charleson was diagnosed with HIV in 1986, and died in 1990 at the age of 40. He requested that it be announced after his death that he had died of AIDS, in order to publicise the condition. This was the first celebrity death in the United Kingdom openly attributed to AIDS, and the announcement helped to promote awareness and acceptance of the disease.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "August 11", "response": ["*  1949   \u2013 Ian Charleson, Scottish-English actor and singer (d. 1990)"]}, {"page": "Chariots of Fire", "response": ["Chariots of Fire is a 1981 British historical sports drama film directed by Hugh Hudson, written by Colin Welland, and produced by David Puttnam.
