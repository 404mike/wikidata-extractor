A hard-tackling defender, he is still regarded as one of Swansea's greatest ever players. Keane was also a dual internationalist and played for both Ireland teams \u2013 the IFA XI and the FAI XI. Two broken legs limited his international career to just five caps and he eventually retired after breaking his leg for a third time.
