Black cut a striking figure in his self-made \"uniform\" of a green topcoat, scarlet waistcoat, and breeches, with a huge leather sash inset with cast-iron rats. Black promoted himself as the Queen's official rat-catcher, but he never held a royal warrant.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Fancy rat", "response": ["The origin of the modern fancy rat begins with the rat-catchers of the 18th and 19th centuries who trapped rats throughout Europe. These rat-catchers would then either kill the rats, or, more likely, sell the rats to be used in blood sport. Rat-baiting was a popular sport until the beginning of the 20th century. It involved filling a pit with several rats and then placing bets on how long it would take a terrier to kill them all. It is believed that both rat-catchers and sportsmen began to keep certain, odd-colored rats during the height of the sport, eventually breeding them and then selling them as pets. The two men thought to have formed the basis of rat fancy are Jack Black, self-proclaimed rat-catcher to Queen Victoria, and Jimmy Shaw, manager of one of the largest sporting public houses in London. These two men are responsible for beginning many of the color varieties present today. Black, specifically, was known for taming the \"prettier\" rats of unusual color, decorating them with ribbons, and selling them as pets.", "Another risk to rat owners is rat-bite fever. This is a rare disease among domesticated rats and is most often found in rats from large chain pet stores who breed their stock of rats in masses (usually with the intention of being snake food rather than pets) or from breeders who fail to take good care of their rats. This disease is fairly unnoticeable in the rat, but is characterized by the swelling of the site of the bite or scratch where it was contracted, a fever, vomiting and body aches. It is contracted by being bitten or scratched by an infected rat. As an early breeder of fancy rats, Jack Black recounted that he had nearly died several times after bites."]}, {"page": "Jack Black (disambiguation)", "response": ["Jack Black (born 1969) is an American actor and singer from Tenacious D.", "Jack Black may also refer to:", "* Jack Black (author) (1871\u20131932), author and hobo", "* Jack Black (rat catcher), Victorian-era rat catcher", "* Jack Black (Viz), a character in the adult comic Viz", "* Jack Black (died 1786), nickname of black Welsh gardener John Ystumllyn"]}, {"page": "Rat-catcher", "response": ["A famous rat-catcher from Victorian England was Jack Black, who is known through Henry Mayhew's interview for London Labour and the London Poor."]}, {"page": "London Labour and the London Poor", "response": ["Mayhew went into deep, almost pedantic detail concerning the trades, habits, religion and domestic arrangements of the thousands of people working the streets of the city.
