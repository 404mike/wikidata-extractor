In 1888, as a result of a tour made with Frank Johnson, Minister of Education, to the Northern Territory, he produced an interesting series of articles for his paper. But he craved an outlet for his independent thought and writing, and with A. T. Chandler (also ex-Advertiser), James Hutchison, Harry Craker, and A. W. Gresswell Smith, founded Quiz, a weekly humorous and satirical publication. Five years later, when Chandler left the partnership, Evans continued as sole editor. The paper was well received by the public and in 1890, by absorbing a competitor, became Quiz and The Lantern."]}, {"page": "Members of the South Australian House of Assembly, 1899\u20131902", "response": ["|| James Hutchison || Labor || East Adelaide || 1898\u20131902"]}, {"page": "Members of the South Australian House of Assembly, 1896\u20131899", "response": ["|| James Hutchison  || Labor || East Adelaide || 1898\u20131902", ": East Adelaide Labor MHA John McPherson died on 13 December 1897.
