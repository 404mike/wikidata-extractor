His best season was 1892, when he scored 1015 runs at an average of 39 runs per innings, and against Gloucestershire at Lord's that season he scored 224, then regarded as a colossal score. He did well that season in both Gentlemen v Players matches at Lord's and The Oval, and was named as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1893.\nBut at the end of the 1893 season he retired to become a stockbroker.\nHe also played football and played for Clapham Rovers in the 1879 FA Cup Final, losing 1\u20130 to  the Old Etonians.", "link_mentions": {}}}
