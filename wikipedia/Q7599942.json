His best season was 1892, when he scored 1015 runs at an average of 39 runs per innings, and against Gloucestershire at Lord's that season he scored 224, then regarded as a colossal score. He did well that season in both Gentlemen v Players matches at Lord's and The Oval, and was named as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1893.\nBut at the end of the 1893 season he retired to become a stockbroker.\nHe also played football and played for Clapham Rovers in the 1879 FA Cup Final, losing 1\u20130 to  the Old Etonians.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "1892 in sports", "response": ["* Wisden Five Batsmen of the Year \u2013 Herbie Hewett, Lionel Palairet, Walter Read, Stanley Scott, Andrew Stoddart"]}, {"page": "Wisden Cricketers of the Year", "response": ["|  Stanley Scott"]}, {"page": "1892 English cricket season", "response": ["*Wisden (Five Batsmen of the Year) \u2013 Herbie Hewett, Lionel Palairet, Walter Read, Stanley Scott, Andrew Stoddart  ", "|Stanley Scott || Middlesex || 15 || 861 || 39.13 || 1 || 5"]}, {"page": "1879 FA Cup Final", "response": ["|FW || || Stanley Scott  "]}, {"page": "List of people from Beckenham", "response": ["*Stanley Scott (1854\u20131933), cricketer"]}, {"page": "1987 Miami Dolphins season", "response": ["*  Stanley Scott"]}, {"page": "1892 County Championship", "response": ["|style=\"text-align:center;\"| 861 ||style=\"text-align:center;\"| 39.13 || Stanley Scott || Middlesex"]}, {"page": "List of Gentlemen cricketers (1841\u20131962)", "response": ["* Stanley Scott (1886\u20131892)"]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1864\u20131894)", "response": ["* Stanley Scott (1889) : S.
