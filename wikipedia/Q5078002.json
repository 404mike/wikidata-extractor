Born in London, England, Harper wrote many self-illustrated travel books, exploring the regions, roads, coastlines, literary connections, old inns etc. of Britain. In later life, he lived in Petersham.\nAside from the some 170 topographical works, he also wrote a few books on drawing and its techniques, including English Pen Artists of To-day (1892) and A Practical Handbook of Drawing for Modern Methods of Reproduction (1894), as well as an anti-feminist polemic, Revolted Woman; past, present, and to come (1894), and a satirical novel, Hearts Do Not Break: a Tale of the Lower Slopes (1896), attacking logrolling among the London literary set.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Petersham, London", "response": ["* The author and illustrator Charles George Harper (1863\u20131943) lived in Petersham in later life, and died there in 1943."]}, {"page": "Coombe Cellars", "response": ["Writing at the beginning of the twentieth century, a local tourist guide stated \"Coombe Cellars can also be approached by a delightful row up the river. But keep your eye on the tide. The inn makes a charming spot for afternoon tea, which can be enjoyed in the gardens, or indoors.\" Other tourist guides of Devon mention the inn, including Charles George Harper's The South Devon Coast, published in 1907. Earlier in its history, the romantic poet John Keats also wrote about the inn, mentioning enjoying cream spread on barley bread. At that time, the establishment was known as the Ferry Boat Inn, the word \"cellars\" referring to the fish cellars. These were huts in which fishermen who did not live on the coast could store their boats, nets and other fishing equipment. Some people had manorial obligations to provide fish to landowners while others were freeholders acting independently. Sea fishing was usually a part-time activity. The location has a long history, being an early base for the local fishing industry, when it had storage facilities. It was also used as a drop off point for smugglers."]}, {"page": "Thomas Hardy's Wessex", "response": ["Artists such as Walter Tyndale, Edmund Hort New, Charles George Harper and others, have painted or drawn the landscapes, places and buildings described in Hardy's novels.

The location of his alleged attempted career as a highwayman was either Hounslow Heath (west of London)\"A mysterious affair, which has never been properly cleared up, was the death of Twysden, Bishop of Raphoe, in 1752. An Irish Bishop, even although a Kentish man of ancient descent, did not perhaps rank very high upon the Episcopal bench, but he was sufficiently exalted to make the innuendo that he had died from being shot on the Heath while taking purses at the pistol-muzzle a very startling one. Grantley Berkeley says: \"The Lord Bishop Twysden, of Raphoe, a member of the old Kentish family of that name, was found suspiciously out at night on Hounslow Heath, and was most unquestionably shot through the body. A correspondent of the Gentleman's Magazine asked, 'Was this the bishop who was taken ill on Hounslow Heath, and so carried back to his friend's house (? Osterley Park), where he died of an inflammation of the bowels?'\" Half-hours with the highwaymen; picturesque biographies and traditions of the knights of the road by Charles George Harper (1908) Volume 1 or Wrotham Heath in Kent.
