It was released on 4 June 2012, by the Greco-Roman label, its remix EP, which features a re-cut of \"Control\" by Hot Chip's Joe Goddard, distributed in September 2012. The four-track record, which contains musical styles of balearic beat, UK garage, dubstep and techno, features vocal contributions from Sin\u00e9ad Harnett and Ria Ritchie. It was described by one reviewer as more a \"youthful\" release of a dubstep and techno scene consisting of artists like James Blake and Little Dragon. The EP is a big departure from their previous works in terms of musical style, its few post-dubstep elements to be the only ones that were also present on their past releases. Promoted one single, \"Boiling\", and one music video for \"Control\", The Face garnered critical acclaim, major praises being towards the quality of the EP's musical style and song structures.", "\"Boiling\", which starts The Face, opens with a R&B-infused landscape of \"bruised color\" synths, which are mostly associated with the works of future garage artists such as Jacques Greene, backing alto vocals by Sin\u00e9ad Harnett. Big keyboard sounds, a deep house bassline, percussion including finger snaps and hi-hats commonly found in early 1990s garage music then pop into the song, as well as reverb effects on the vocals, before some bubbly synth textures \"unravel\" the song. \"What's In Your Head\" contains chops of high-pitched voice samples, a \"distorted-beyond-recognition orgasm sample,\" and \"spacey\" \"sun-bleached\" synthesizers. The later part of the track consists of a harsh drum beat, stuttering vocal chops and \"vamping\" synth lines. According to The 405's James West, the song includes pop music elements similar to those in Be Strong, an album by duo The 2 Bears. Writing for Resident Advisor, Phillip Sherburne described the song's vocal snippets as cleaner versions of those found in the 1997 track \"Fly Life\" by Basement Jaxx."]}, {"page": "Gryffin", "response": ["2017 saw three singles for Gryffin. \"Feel Good\", a collaboration with DJ Illenium and singer Daya, was released on March 3. \"Love in Ruins\" with singer Sin\u00e9ad Harnett was released on July 7 and \"Nobody Compares to You\" with Katie Pearlman was released on October 6."]}, {"page": "Sin\u00e9ad Harnett (EP)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Sin\u00e9ad Harnett"]}, {"page": "Masego (musician)", "response": ["| Sin\u00e9ad Harnett, VanJess"]}, {"page": "Kaytranada production discography", "response": ["Sin\u00e9ad Harnett \u2013 Sin\u00e9ad Harnett EP (August 4)", "Sin\u00e9ad Harnett \u2013 Chapter One (June 1)"]}, {"page": "Lucky Daye", "response": ["|Sin\u00e9ad Harnett"]}, {"page": "Heavy Love (Louise album)", "response": ["Heavy Love is the fourth studio album by English singer Louise.
