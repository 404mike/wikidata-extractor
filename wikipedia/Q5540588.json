He made 231 appearances in the Football League.Born in Salford, Hicks joined Manchester City in November 1923. He played for them in the 1926 FA Cup Final and contributed to them winning the Second Division championship in the 1927\u201328 season. He signed for First Division club Birmingham in October 1928, and scored 12 league goals in what remained of that season. Early in the 1930\u201331 season he sustained a serious knee injury. Though he attempted a comeback twelve months later, playing and scoring against Blackpool in September 1931, that game marked the end of his Birmingham career. He moved to Manchester United in January 1932, but left for Bristol Rovers later that year without having featured for the first team. A further year later, again without playing League football, he joined Swindon Town, for whom he played four matches before moving to his last Football League club, Rotherham United, where he missed only three games in the remainder of the 1933\u201334 season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of Manchester City F.C. players", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|George Hicks||  || Winger || 1924\u20131928||135||48|| ||"]}, {"page": "1926 FA Cup Final", "response": ["| ||Forward|| George Hicks"]}, {"page": "George Hicks", "response": ["George Hicks may refer to:", "* George Hicks (trade unionist) (1879\u20131954), British trade unionist and politician", "* George Hicks (footballer) (1902\u2013?), English footballer", "* George Hicks (aviator) (1900\u20131951), World War I flying ace", "* George Hicks (broadcast journalist) (1905\u20131965), American war correspondent"]}, {"page": "1929\u201330 Birmingham F.C. season", "response": ["Twenty-five players made at least one appearance in nationally organised competition, and there were thirteen different goalscorers.
