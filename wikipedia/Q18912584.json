The excitement was intense and the crowd volatile; tickets had sold out early and seats were hard come by. While at first the play seemed to be a success with the audience, soon fits of laughter were heard and at one point the play came to a complete halt till order was restored. When Barrymore announced another performance of the play, the audience rebelled, and chaos reigned until the management substituted something else.Joseph Farington, diary entry for 2 April 1796, in the Farington Diary (London 1922\u201328), p. 145; James Anson Farrer, Literary Forgeries (London, 1907), pp. 226\u2013232. William Henry Ireland blamed the actors, particularly Kemble, along with a \"Malone faction,\" for the failure of his play.Confessions, pp. 156\u2013159. Others attributed it to the quality of the play itself.Farington, op. cit.; William P. Marsh, Clubs of London (London, 1828), volume 2, pp. 107\u2013111.
