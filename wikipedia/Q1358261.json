In addition to plants that are widespread in Snowdonia, Snowdon is home to some plants rarely found elsewhere in Britain. These include the \"Snowdon lily\", Gagea serotina, which is also found in the Alps and in North America; it was first discovered in Wales by Edward Lhuyd, and the genus Lloydia (now included in Gagea) was later named in his honour by Richard Anthony Salisbury.

This was subsequently published in March 1810 as On the Proteaceae of Jussieu. It is significant for its contribution to the systematics of Proteaceae, and to the floristics of Australia, and also for its application of palynology to systematics. This work was extensively plagiarised by Richard Anthony Salisbury, who had memorised much of the Linnean reading and then inserted it in Joseph Knight's 1809 publication On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae."]}, {"page": "Calypso bulbosa", "response": ["The generic name Calypso , which is still valid today. was described in 1806 by the English gardener Richard Anthony Salisbury (1761-1829) in the work \"Paradisus Londinensis\", which Salisbury with the then director of the Royal Botanic Gardens in London, William Jackson Hooker (1785-1865), published.

He initially used the name Leucojum autumnale for the plant illustrated in plate 21, but when discussing Leucojum pulchellum (now included in L.\u00a0aestivum), illustrated in plate 74, Salisbury noted the differences between the two species, and considered them sufficient to move Leucojum autumnale into a new genus, Acis. Although some botanists accepted the split between Leucojum and Acis, including Robert Sweet in 1829, most did not; for example, Brian Mathew in 1987 placed all the species in Leucojum. Acis was reinstated in 2004, after it was determined on morphological and molecular grounds that the broadly defined genus Leucojum was paraphyletic, with Acis and a more narrowly defined Leucojum being related as shown the following cladogram."]}, {"page": "Trillium grandiflorum", "response": ["Trillium grandiflorum was originally described as T. rhomboideum var. grandiflorum by Andr\u00e9 Michaux in his 1803 work Flora Boreali-Americana.

The species was traditionally placed in the subgenus Trillium, but recent work has shown the phylogeny of this grouping to be paraphyletic. Since then no phylogeny of the genus has garnered much agreement. (The other subgenus, Phyllantherum, includes sessile-flowered species). T. grandiflorum is, alongside the western T. ovatum, one of the closer relatives to the subg. Phyllantherum members."]}, {"page": "Joseph Sabine", "response": ["Sabine was honorary secretary of the Royal Horticultural Society from 1810 to 1830, and treasurer, and received their gold medal for organising the accounts left in a state of disarray by Richard Anthony Salisbury.

He sent David Douglas and others to collect specimens, and initiated local societies as extensions of the society.
