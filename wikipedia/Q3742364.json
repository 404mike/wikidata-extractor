Michael Pennington portrays Moff Jerjerrod, the commander of the second Death Star. Warwick Davis appears as Wicket W. Warrick, an Ewok who befriends Leia and leads her and her friends to the Ewok tribe. Baker was originally cast as Wicket, but was replaced by Davis after falling ill with food poisoning on the morning of the shoot. Davis had no previous acting experience and was cast only after his grandmother had discovered an open call for dwarfs for the new Star Wars film. Caroline Blakiston portrays Mon Mothma, a co-founder and leader of the Rebel Alliance. Michael Carter plays Jabba the Hutt's aide, Bib Fortuna (voiced by Erik Bauersfeld), while Femi Taylor and Claire Davenport appear as Jabba's original slave dancers."]}, {"page": "1997 in film", "response": ["| Return of the Jedi (Special Edition) || 20th Century Fox / Lucasfilm || Richard Marquand (director); Lawrence Kasdan, George Lucas (screenplay); Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee Williams, Anthony Daniels, David Prowse, James Earl Jones, Ian McDiarmid, Kenny Baker, Peter Mayhew, Frank Oz, Alec Guinness, Sebastian Shaw, Michael Pennington, Kenneth Colley, Michael Carter, Denis Lawson, Tim Rose, Dermot Crowley, Caroline Blakiston, Warwick Davis, Jeremy Bulloch, Femi Taylor, Annie Arbogast, Jack Purvis, Mike Edmonds, Jane Busby, Nicki Reade, Debbie Lee Carrington, Sadie Corre, Tony Cox, Phil Fondacaro, Ben Burtt, Richard Marquand, Mike Quinn, Deep Roy, Phil Tippett, Larry Ward, Robert Watts || Sci-Fi, Fantasy || Live action"]}, {"page": "1983 in film", "response": ["| Return of the Jedi || 20th Century Fox / Lucasfilm || Richard Marquand (director); Lawrence Kasdan, George Lucas (screenplay); Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee Williams, Anthony Daniels, David Prowse, James Earl Jones, Ian McDiarmid, Kenny Baker, Peter Mayhew, Frank Oz, Alec Guinness, Sebastian Shaw, Michael Pennington, Kenneth Colley, Michael Carter, Denis Lawson, Tim Rose, Dermot Crowley, Caroline Blakiston, Warwick Davis, Jeremy Bulloch, Femi Taylor, Annie Arbogast, Jack Purvis, Mike Edmonds, Jane Busby, Nicki Reade, Debbie Carrington, Sadie Corre, Tony Cox, Phil Fondacaro, Ben Burtt, Richard Marquand, Mike Quinn, Deep Roy, Phil Tippett, Larry Ward, Robert Watts || Sci-Fi, Fantasy || Live action "]}, {"page": "1980 in film", "response": ["| The Apple || The Cannon Group / NF Geria II / Filmgesellschaft mbH || Menahem Golan (director/screenplay); Catherine Mary Stewart, Allan Love, Grace Kennedy, George Gilmour, Joss Ackland, Vladek Sheybal, Ray Shell, Miriam Margoyles, Derek Deadman, George S.

The original cast included Debra Byrne as Grizabella, John Wood as Old Deuteronomy, Marina Prior as Jellylorum, Jeff Phillips as Rum Tum Tugger, David Atkins as Mistoffelees, and Anita Louise Combe as Sillabub. The Sydney production cost $3\u00a0million to mount and grossed a record $28\u00a0million. It was credited with revitalising the then-stagnant musical genre in Australia. After closing in Sydney, an additional $1.8\u00a0million was spent transferring the production to Melbourne, including $725,000 to refurbish the old Her Majesty's Theatre. The Melbourne run played from October 1987 to December 1988, with an opening night cast that included Megan Williams as Grizabella, Wood as Old Deuteronomy, Phillips as Rum Tum Tugger, Linda Hartley-Clark as Demeter, Femi Taylor as Bombalurina, Rachael Beck as Rumpleteazer and Se\u00e1n Martin Hingston as Plato/Macavity. From 1989 to 1990, the company toured the Festival Theatre in Adelaide, His Majesty's Theatre in Perth, Civic Theatre in Newcastle, Lyric Theatre in Brisbane, and the Aotea Centre in Auckland.

In the 1997 edition, extra shots were inserted depicting her in the pit, including shots where she looks up to the crowd, the pit door being raised, and a shot of her terror. The rancor and Oola as she screams remain off-screen. Femi Taylor, who played Oola, impressed critics with her ability to reprise the role over a decade later without visible difference. Wired notes that \"they put a different eyeshadow color on her, so she's not exactly seamless.\" James Whitbrook at io9 praised the additions to the scene, writing that it teased the rancor well while still keeping the monster a surprise for Luke's later battle with it. Conversely, Den of Geek UK criticized the additions as unnecessary and felt that they made the audience familiar with the pit, weakening Luke's scene."]}, {"page": "The Apple (1980 film)", "response": ["* Finola Hughes, Femi Taylor, and John Chester in their film debuts as dancers"]}, {"page": "Cats (1998 film)", "response": ["*Exotica: A dark, sleek brown and cream female, similar to Cassandra in appearance.
