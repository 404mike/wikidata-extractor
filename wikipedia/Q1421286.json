The place called Misquamicut became the town of Westerly, and Tobias Saunders and others were now townsmen as well as freemen.  Connecticut continued to argue that the Narragansett River was their eastern boundary and that the river and the bay were the same.  Rhode Island, unwilling to relinquish its southwestern territory, referred its adversaries to the 1644 patent, the 1664 charter, and the royal commissioners' determination of the King's Province, all of which set the Pawcatuck River as the Boundary.  The problem as the Connecticut agents (Fitz-John Winthrop, was one of the three) well knew, was that their charter confused the Narragansett River with the Narragansett Bay. Although Governor Winthrop in his agreement with Clarke had acknowledged that \"Pawcatuck\" and \"Narragansett\" described the same river, they refused to deflate their territorial ambitions.  Profitable lobbying by the Atherton Trading Company also strengthened their resolve.
