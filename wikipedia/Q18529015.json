Pease", "response": ["Pease was born near Bristol, the son of devout Quakers, Thomas Pease (1816\u20131884) and Susanna Ann Fry (1829\u20131917; sister of Edward Fry, the judge); he was the sixth of Thomas's 15 children but Susanna's first, Thomas having had five children by previous marriages. One of his sisters was the schoolteacher Marian Pease. His father had been a wool comber and his mother came from the Fry family known for manufacturing chocolate. Edward Pease was educated at home until he was 16, and soon after moved to London where he was taken under the wing of his brother in law Sir Thomas Hanbury. He was initially employed as a clerk in a business where Hanbury was a partner. In time Hanbury arranged for him to become a partner in a stock broking firm."]}, {"page": "Settlement movement", "response": ["Other early examples include Browning Hall, formed in Walworth in 1895 by Francis Herbert Stead, and Mansfield House Settlement, also in east London (see Percy Alden).

She later won a Goldsmiths scholarship to study at Newnham College, Cambridge. However, due to recurring bouts of poor health (which would persist throughout her life, until her death), she was unable to complete her full studies at either Bristol or Newnham. The 1881 census records her as living back at home at Cook's Folly, aged 22, unmarried and unemployed."]}]}}
