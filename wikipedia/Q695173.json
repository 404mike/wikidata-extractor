Patrick Jephson, her private secretary of eight years, wrote in an article in The Daily Telegraph that \"[Diana] had an extra quality that frustrated her critics during her lifetime and has done little to soften their disdain since her death\". Diana was criticised by philosophy professor Anthony O'Hear who in his notes argued that she was unable to fulfill her duties, her reckless behaviour was damaging the monarchy, and she was \"self-indulgent\" in her philanthropic efforts. Following his remarks, charity organisations that were supported by Diana defended her, and Peter Luff called O'Hear's comments \"distasteful and inappropriate\". Further criticism surfaced as she was accused of using her public profile to benefit herself, which in return \"demeaned her royal office\". Diana's unique type of charity work, which sometimes included physical contact with people affected by serious diseases occasionally had a negative reaction in the media."]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 2001 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Peter Luff", "| Peter Luff"]}, {"page": "Monsanto", "response": ["During the late 1990s, Monsanto lobbied to raise permitted glyphosate levels in soybeans and was successful in convincing Codex Alimentarius and both the UK and US governments to lift levels 200 times to 20 milligrams per kilogram of soya.
