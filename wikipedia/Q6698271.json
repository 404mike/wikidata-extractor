It has also been adapted into a children's television programme. While the books were set in Cuddington, Leicester, England, the television show was set in the fictional Australian beachside suburb of Crescent Bay. The books revolve around five young girls who are part of a club in which they sleepover at each other's houses at least once a week. The television series do not portray the same stories as the books with the possible exception of the first episode which loosely resembled the story where the girls try and set up their 'Brown Owl' with their school care-taker."]}, {"page": "Lucy diamond", "response": ["#REDIRECT Lucy Diamond "]}]}}
