Corry went on to say that \"like many of the black women before her, Carey fought for creative control of her career\" and that Carey brought \"hip-hop to a pop audience not out of necessity, but because it was a part of her identity\". Carey straddled herself between the \"pop production of the early 90s\" to find a sound that was not a \"one-size-fits-all approach\". Corry stated that her 1993 album Music Box \"was proof she didn't falter when it came to keeping up with the times\". She also called her \"omnipresent\" and that \"beyond her unnatural ability to sing, the voice she possessed in her songwriting was equally as strong\". Jeff Benjamin, Forbes writer, agreed with this saying that her songwriting is one aspect of her career which is commonly overlooked. According to Stevie Wonder, \"When people talk about the great influential singers, they talk about Aretha, Whitney and Mariah. That's a testament to her talent. Her range is that amazing.\" Carey's songs have been recorded or performed by a variety of artists, including those of older generations, such as Aretha Franklin, Patti Labelle, Dolly Parton, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Shania Twain and Michael Ball."]}, {"page": "1962", "response": ["** Michael Ball, British actor and singer"]}, {"page": "Andrew Lloyd Webber", "response": ["Aspects of Love followed in 1989, a musical based on the story by David Garnett.
