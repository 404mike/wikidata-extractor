He was brought up in Swindon where he was educated at Churchfields School and Swindon College.  He played for Swindon CC and, in Minor Counties cricket, for Wiltshire County Cricket Club in 1993. He joined Northamptonshire in 1994 and played for its Second XI but returned to Wiltshire in 1995. In the same year, he joined Gloucestershire and made his first-class debut. He has played for the English cricket team in Twenty20, One Day International and Test matches. He was appointed Gloucestershire captain in 2006.\nIn 2005, Lewis was included in the England squad for the two Tests against Bangladesh, but did not play in either match. He did, however, make his first international appearance in the Twenty20 game against Australia in June, and took 4\u201324 in his four overs as England recorded a crushing 100-run victory. He made his One Day International debut a few days later in England's win against Bangladesh at The Oval, again impressing with 3\u201332 from ten overs. He was included in the 13-man squad for the home series against Sri Lanka in 2006, making his Test debut at Trent Bridge on 2 June 2006 and taking a wicket with his fourth delivery (and third legitimate ball) in Test cricket. He is the 634th player to represent England at Test cricket.\nHe was selected in a number of Test squads during the summer of 2006, but only played in one Test against Sri Lanka, coming to be regarded as something of a perennial 12th man. He did however bowl well in the ODIs against Pakistan, having finally been given an extended run in the side. Lewis was selected in England's 15-man squad for the Cricket World Cup 2007, which was held in the Caribbean. Midway through the tournament he returned to England for personal reasons, without playing a game in the World Cup. His most recent appearance for England was a sole appearance in the 2007 limited overs series against India.\nOn 29 July 2011, it was announced that after 16 years with Gloucestershire, Lewis was to join Surrey on a two-year deal. Lewis left Surrey at the end of the 2013 season to join Sussex on a one-year contract ahead of the 2014 season. On 28 November 2014, Lewis announced his retirement from the professional game to become bowling coach at Sussex.In 2015 was appointed as Assistant Head Coach at Sussex County Cricket Club. In 2016 Lewis started as the Bowling Coach for England Under 19's.

It didn't look as the score would be as big at first, as Paul Weekes with 81, Ed Smith with 53, Owais Shah with 55 and Scott Styris with 42 kept the score ticking at roughly a run a ball. However, Kenyan-born Jamie Dalrymple slashed four sixes and seven fours in an unbeaten 24-ball 60 to up the run rate late on, and Gloucestershire's Jon Lewis, who earlier in the summer had played ODIs for England, conceded 86 runs in nine overs. Gloucestershire always kept up with the run rate, however, as Phil Weston, Craig Spearman and Matt Windows lifted Gloucestershire to 275 for 2, and despite Paul Weekes' late burst of four wickets, Mark Alleyne and Ian Fisher shared a stand of 18 to see Gloucestershire to the target.", "Three centuries were recorded at Old Trafford, as Gloucestershire Gladiators snatched a victory over the hosting Lancashire Lightning after being regarded with no chance earlier on. The Gladiators won the toss and got immediate success, as Jon Lewis dismissed Mal Loye with the second ball of the day, but pretty much everything went against Gloucestershire from then on, as Stuart Law, Mark Chilton and Andrew Symonds flayed the bowling to all corners. Symonds took 88 balls for his century, and went on to make 129 before being bowled by James Averis \u2013 who finished with four for 40. Law and Chilton also made fifties, but Averis' late spell and a slow 39-ball 11 from Marcus North ensured that the total ended on 267 for 7. Then, James Anderson had three men caught off his bowling, as Gloucestershire crashed to 47 for 4. However, Anderson finished his spell, and Ramnaresh Sarwan crafted a century \u2013 which was shortly followed by Mark Hardinges reaching his first one-day century of his career, and in the process lifting his List A career batting average from 14.23 to 17.50, still below par for a specialist batsman like Hardinges. However, the pair added 221 runs in 116 minutes for the fifth wicket, hitting six sixes along the way, as they guided Gloucestershire out of the relegation zone in the National League.", "Gloucestershire Gladiators crashed back into the relegation zone with a defeat against Glamorgan Dragons at Sophia Gardens, succumbing to medium pace bowler David Harrison, who bowled four maiden overs to end with bowling figures of 9\u20134\u201316\u20132. Despite half-centuries from Kabir Ali and Alex Gidman, who looked to give the visitors a comfortable target after moving to 103 for 3, Dean Cosker ripped out three quick wickets, and Gidman was forced to consolidate. He did top score with 62, but Glamorgan were set a rather modest target of 195 to win. Jon Lewis made inroads with his medium pace early on, taking three wickets as Glamorgan stuttered to 40 for 4, but Michael Powell and Dan Cherry put Glamorgan back in it with a 79-run stand, and Gloucestershire's bowlers were made to rue their 15 wides, as they helped Glamorgan to reach their target with two overs remaining.", "The relegation battle in the National League tightened further, as the match at Trent Bridge became a low-scoring thriller, where Gloucestershire Gladiators failed to put away two good positions \u2013 first they collapsed from 75 for 2 to make 116, then they allowed Nottinghamshire to hit 19 for the last wicket. They were put in to bat by Nottinghamshire Outlaws and after losing Kadeer Ali and Ramnaresh Sarwan for ducks, Steve Adshead and Craig Spearman rebuilt with a 60-run third-wicket stand. Mark Ealham and Gareth Clough shared the last seven wickets, however, after Ryan Sidebottom had bowled Spearman for 18, and Gloucestershire were all out for 116. James Averis then took four wickets for the Gladiators, as Nottinghamshire lost their first five wickets for 32 runs, but Anurag Singh and Mark Ealham put them back on track by adding 30 for the sixth wicket. Jon Lewis broke through their defences, however, shattering Ealham's stumps as he was bowled, and when Anurag Singh departed for 41, Nottinghamshire's task looked steep. They needed 19 for the last wicket with Ryan Sidebottom and Greg Smith batting \u2013 but Smith hit two fours as he ended with 16 not out to take Nottinghamshire to the victory.", "Gloucestershire Gladiators made it past Glamorgan Dragons to take a victory in their final game of the season, but they were still relegated into Division Two, thus suffering relegation in both forms of cricket. Winning the toss and bowling first, Gloucestershire's spinners Malinga Bandara and Mark Hardinges shared four for 87 in their 18 overs after the opening bowlers Jon Lewis and James Averis went wicketless. Gloucestershire did concede 32 extras, however, as Glamorgan assembled 262 for 8. Steve Adshead and Kadeer Ali added 86 for Gloucestershire's first wicket, before Craig Spearman took on the Gloucestershire bowlers to hit 80 off 71 balls.
