His loyalties shifted between liberalism and communism, but he defined himself as a Christian socialist and internationalist. He used his publishing house chiefly to promote pacifist and socialist non-fiction, and also launched the Left Book Club.\nIn the postwar era, he focused his attention on Germany and became known for his promotion of friendship and reconciliation based on his internationalism and his ethic of brotherly love. He founded the organisation Save Europe Now (SEN) in 1945 to campaign for humane treatment of German civilians, and drew attention to their suffering, especially children, and atrocities committed against German civilians. He received an honorary doctorate at the University of Frankfurt in 1949, the Gro\u00dfes Bundesverdienstkreuz of Germany in 1953 and the Peace Prize of the German Book Trade in 1960, and several streets in Germany, including the Gollanczstra\u00dfe in West Berlin, and two schools, the Victor Gollancz Elementary School and the Victor-Gollancz-Volkshochschule Steglitz-Zehlendorf, were named in his honour. He also campaigned for friendship with Soviet Russia. Gollancz once said: \"I hate everything that is pro and anti (different peoples).

Two years earlier, J. B. Priestley had written about England north of the Trent, sparking an interest in reportage. The depression had also introduced a number of working-class writers from the North of England to the reading public. It was one of these working-class authors, Jack Hilton, whom Orwell sought for advice. Orwell had written to Hilton seeking lodging and asking for recommendations on his route. Hilton was unable to provide him lodging, but suggested that he travel to Wigan rather than Rochdale, \"for there are the colliers and they're good stuff.\"Clarke, Ben. \"George Orwell, Jack Hilton, and the Working Class.\" Review of English Studies 67.281 (2016) 764\u201385.", "The result of his journeys through the north was The Road to Wigan Pier, published by Gollancz for the Left Book Club in 1937.Orwell, Facing Unpleasant Facts, Secker & Warburg (new edition 2000), p. 12 The first half of the book documents his social investigations of Lancashire and Yorkshire, including an evocative description of working life in the coal mines. The second half is a long essay on his upbringing and the development of his political conscience, which includes an argument for socialism (although he goes to lengths to balance the concerns and goals of socialism with the barriers it faced from the movement's own advocates at the time, such as \"priggish\" and \"dull\" socialist intellectuals and \"proletarian\" socialists with little grasp of the actual ideology). Gollancz feared the second half would offend readers and added a disculpatory preface to the book while Orwell was in Spain.Ruth Dudley Edwards, Victor Gollancz, a Biography, pp. 246\u2013247; quoted in A Kind of Compulsion: 1903 \u2013 1936 (The Complete Works of George Orwell), p. 532."]}, {"page": "Kingsley Amis", "response": ["In one memoir, Amis wrote, \"Now and then I become conscious of having the reputation of being one of the great drinkers, if not one of the great drunks, of our time\".Memoirs: \"Booze\".

Hilary Rubinstein, who accepted Lucky Jim for Victor Gollancz, commented, \"I doubted whether Jim Dixon would have gone to the pub and drunk ten pints of beer.... I didn't know Kingsley very well, you see.\"Quoted in Bradford, Chapter 5. Clive James commented: \"All on his own, he had the weekly drinks bill of a whole table at the Garrick Club even before he was elected. After he was, he would get so tight there that he could barely make it to the taxi.\"Clive James, \"Kingsley without the women\", Times Literary Supplement, 2 February 2007. Amis was, however, adamant in his belief that inspiration did not come from a bottle: \"Whatever part drink may play in the writer's life, it must play none in his or her work.\" This matches a disciplined approach to writing. For \"many years\" Amis imposed a rigorous daily schedule on himself, segregating writing and drink. Mornings were spent on writing, with a minimum daily output of 500 words.Jacobs, 1995, pp. 6 and 17. Drinking began about lunchtime, when this had been achieved.
