In 1863, members of the family established the sports outfitters Lillywhites.Lillywhite was an all-rounder who batted right-handed and bowled right-arm roundarm, both slow and fast.\nHis known first-class career spanned the 1848 to 1873 seasons.  He took 223 wickets in 185 matches @ 11.56 with a best analysis of 8/54.  He took five wickets in an innings 12 times and 10 wickets in a match twice.  He scored 5127 runs @ 17.43 with a highest score of 138, making two centuries.  He took 94 catches.\nHe served as cricket coach at Rugby School where he nurtured star all-rounder Tom Wills, one of the founders of Australian rules football.\nAt the end of the 1859 English cricket season, Lillywhite was one of the 12 players who took part in cricket's first-ever overseas tour when an English team led by George Parr visited North America.\nFrom 1856 to 1873, Lillywhite umpired in 29 first-class matches. On 26 August 1862, during an All-England Eleven v. Surrey match at The Oval, Lillywhite no-balled Edgar Willsher six times in succession for what he deemed to be illegal \"high\" deliveries. Willsher and the majority of his All-England teammates protested and abandoned the match, and Lillywhite was replaced the following day.

Wills took up cricket within a week of entering Evans House. At first he bowled underhand, but it was considered outdated, so he tried roundarm bowling. He clean bowled a batsman with his first ball using this style and declared: \"I felt I was a bowler.\" Wills soon topped all of his house's cricket statistics. At bat he was a \"punisher\" with a sound defence; however, in an era when stylish stroke-play was expected of gentlemen cricketers, Wills was said to have no style at all. In April 1852, aged sixteen, he joined the Rugby School XI, and on his debut at Lord's against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) a few months later, he took a match-high 12 wickets. While his bowling proved vital that year in establishing Rugby as the greatest public school in English cricket, anonymous critics in the press stated that he ought to be no-balled for throwing\u2014an illegal bowling action. Rugby coach John Lillywhite, considered an authority on bowling, came to his prot\u00e9g\u00e9's defense, rescuing him from further scandal.

Outraged, Willsher left the field in protest with eight of his professional colleagues (the two amateurs in the England team remained on the field) and play was abandoned for the rest of the day. When Lillywhite refused to accept the legality of Willsher's action, he was replaced as umpire so that the game could continue. Willsher went on to take 6 for 49. As a result of this incident, which may well have been planned in advance in order to force the issue, the laws were changed and overarm bowling was legalised from the beginning of the 1864 season.
