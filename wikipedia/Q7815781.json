He made 212 appearances in the Football League in the late 1920s and 1930s.\nBorn in Bulwell, Nottinghamshire, Fillingham worked at a colliery and a dyehouse and played local football in the Nottinghamshire area before turning professional with Birmingham, for whom he went on to play 183 games in the Football League First Division. He was a strong, versatile player; originally a forward, he converted to defence, becoming first choice at centre half as the replacement for George Morrall, but was always keen to push forward. He sustained an injury playing for Birmingham in 1934 which resulted in him losing an eye some 15 years later.In 1938 Fillingham moved to Ipswich Town, and played in their first ever match in the Football League. He made guest appearances for clubs in the Nottinghamshire area during the Second World War, but did not play afterwards. He was also a good cricketer and golfer. He died in Bulwell in 1960 at the age of 55.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jack Coxford", "response": ["Coxford was born in North Seaton, Ashington, Northumberland. He played for North Seaton Colliery and Stakeford United before joining Sunderland in 1924. He made his debut in the First Division on 18 April 1925, in a 1\u20131 draw at Blackburn Rovers, but never established himself as a first-team player. In April 1927, after only 11 games for Sunderland, Coxford joined fellow First Division club Birmingham. He was signed as cover for George Morrall, but the developing Tom Fillingham pushed Coxford down the pecking order, and after three years with the club in which he played only 16 games, he left for Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic of the Third Division South. At Bournemouth, Coxford had four seasons of regular first-team football. Towards the end of the 1933\u201334 season, he played two games for nearby Poole Town before moving on to Northfleet United as player-coach., quoted in "]}, {"page": "Dick Butler (footballer)", "response": ["Butler was born in Eastwood, Nottinghamshire. A centre half, he began his football career with Bestwood Colliery before joining Birmingham in May 1933. Because of the consistency of George Morrall and then of Tom Fillingham, Butler did not make his first-team debut until 12 September 1936, deputising for Fillingham in the First Division game at home to Stoke City which Birmingham lost 4\u20132.Matthews, p. 179. In nearly six years with the club, Butler was a major player for the reserve team in the Central League, but appeared only 11 times for the first team. In March 1939 he joined Crewe Alexandra, but played only six league games before the Second World War put an end to his professional career. During the war he made guest appearances for West Bromwich Albion."]}, {"page": "Arthur Hubbard", "response": ["Hubbard was born in the Erdington district of Birmingham and attended Chester Road School. Birmingham signed him from his works team in August 1932, initially on an amateur basis: he turned professional six months later. He made his debut in the First Division on the opening day of the 1934\u201335 season, deputising for the injured Ned Barkas in a home game against local rivals Aston Villa which Birmingham won 2\u20131. He played in the next four games before losing his place to Tom Fillingham, and, once Barkas returned to fitness, not regaining it.Matthews, p. 177. At the end of the season Hubbard, described as a solid full-back, joined Luton Town of the Third Division South, where he played only four league games, and in 1939 moved into non-league football with Dunstable Town."]}, {"page": "Jim Olney", "response": ["He began the 1936\u201337 season back in the Birmingham Combination as captain of Birmingham's \"A\" team. He played twice for the first team that season, once in January and once in April, standing in for Tom Fillingham at centre half, but made no further appearances. He underwent knee cartilage surgery in January 1938, but even without the injury, he had been unable to displace Fillingham from the regular starting eleven: they played in a similar style, but Olney \"lacked the destructive abilities\" of the more experienced man. Fillingham was given a free transfer at the end of the season, while Olney was retained. Several men were used at centre-half in the first few months of the 1938\u201339 season, but Olney was not, and in December 1938 he moved to Third Division South club Swindon Town."]}, {"page": "Ray Crawshaw", "response": ["Crawshaw was born in Padiham, Lancashire. He began his football career with local team Great Harwood, and had spells with Southport and Burnley, but without playing in the Football League. He joined Accrington Stanley in 1933, and played 19 games in the Third Division North before moving to First Division club Birmingham in April 1934 for a fee of \u00a3600. The form of George Morrall and Tom Fillingham restricted Crawshaw's appearances to four, and he returned to non-league football in 1934."]}]}}
