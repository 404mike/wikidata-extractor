Ellison (1893\u20131976) was an English radio presenter and author who made radio programmes about nature and the countryside for the BBC's Children's Hour, under the pseudonym Nomad the Naturalist, and wrote on the same subjects both as Nomad and in his own name.\nBorn in Liverpool in 1893, he signed up as a private in the 1/6th Battalion, King's Liverpool Regiment, at the outbreak of World War I, and served in the trenches in Belgium. He saw action on The Somme and at Flanders but was discharged in 1917 suffering from trench foot. His war diaries were published in 1997.\nIn later life, he lived at West Kirby, on the Wirral Peninsula, Cheshire. He and Eric Hosking would watch birds together at Hilbre Island. Six of his books were illustrated by his friend Charles Tunnicliffe.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Children's Hour", "response": ["In the United Kingdom, Children's Hour was broadcast from 5\u00a0pm to 6\u00a0pmStrictly speaking: 5\u00a0pm to 5.55. The last five minutes were assigned to the Weather Forecast  every day of the week, with the biggest listening figures being at weekends when parents joined in too. It was the time of day during the week when children could be expected to be home from school, and was aimed at an audience aged about 5 to 15 years.  Programming was imbued with Reithian virtues, and Children's Hour was often criticised, like \"Auntie\" BBC itself, for paternalism and middle-class values. It was nonetheless hugely popular, and its presenters were national figures, their voices instantly recognisable.  Derek McCulloch was closely involved with the programme from 1926, and ran the department from 1933 until 1950, when he had to resign for health reasons. From 1928 to 1960, Children's Hour in Scotland was organised and presented by Kathleen Garscadden, known as Auntie Kathleen, whose popularity brought crowds to the radio station in Glasgow.W. H.

On Scottish Children's Hour their equivalents were Gilbert Dempster Fisher (the 'Hut Man of the BBC'), James Douglas-Home (the 'Bird Man'), and Thomas Haining Gillespie (known later as the 'Zoo Man of the Scottish BBC').", "*Norman Ellison, aka Nomad the Naturalist"]}, {"page": "George Bramwell Evens", "response": ["* Norman Ellison aka Nomad the Naturalist."]}, {"page": "Charles Tunnicliffe", "response": ["* 1946 \u2013 Wandering with Nomad.
