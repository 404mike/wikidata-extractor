The more common problem is that many players are inter-disciplinary i.e. billiards/snooker or snooker/pool, so if we have to have this parameter its default state should be set to \"off\". I think a better approach would be to have a \"tour\" parameter listed alongside the current parameters, so we can explicitly list the tour(s) a player plays on.

For example, the Women's Professional Billiard Association for Allison Fisher, or the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association for Ronnie O'Sullivan.
