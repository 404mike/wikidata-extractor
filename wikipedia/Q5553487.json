Horton Hall had been refurbished, modernised, augmented with pleasure gardens and a swimming pool, and was just too large for private buyers in the midst of The Depression.  The House and gardens were sold to a developer and were demolished in 1936 to make way for new housing.  Of the original 18th and 19th century buildings associated with the main house, four are grade II listed and remain in use today.  These include dual lodges, The Menagerie, fully restored by Gervase Jackson-Stops, The New Temple, \"as fine as any at Stowe or Stourhead\", which was converted so that the portico forms the centre of a substantial property and was renamed Temple House, and finally the brick stable block and coach house, which was restored, converted and renamed Captain's Court.  The beautiful interiors, fireplaces, marbles, panelled rooms, main staircase, \"stone and door knob\" were all auctioned, with some of the murals now held by the Dunedin Public Art Gallery, and the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa both in New Zealand."]}]}}
