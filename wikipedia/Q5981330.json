He trained at RADA with a scholarship when he was 16.\nAn early television appearance was as David Balfour in the BBC's 1963 adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's Kidnapped, set in Scotland in 1751. Balfour is captured while on board a ship, and here he meets Jacobite rebel Alan Breck Stewart with whom he forges an alliance, escaping to the Scottish Highlands while trying to avoid the redcoats. All twelve episodes are believed missing from the archive.Another notable early television appearance in 1964 when he played Ixta in the four-part Doctor Who story The Aztecs. He was interviewed for that serial's DVD release in 2002. In 2012, he returned to Doctor Who to play Nadeyan in the Big Finish audio drama \"Dark Eyes\".\nICullen had numerous roles in British film and television, including regular roles in Emergency \u2013 Ward 10 during its final year (as Warren Kent \u2013 1966\u20131967), Z-Cars (as Joe Skinner \u2013 1969\u20131975), When the Boat Comes In (as Geordie Watson - 1977\u20131981) and Channel 5's soap opera Family Affairs (as Angus Hart \u2013 1997\u20131999). He has guest starred in numerous television dramas, including The Bill, Dalziel & Pascoe and Sorry!. In 2011, he starred as Baron Sterling in the award-winning feature film Dawn of the Dragonslayer.\nWhen joining the cast of Z Cars in 1969 he became a household name.  By this time this popular series was broadcast in a twice-weekly 25-minute format.  His character Joe Skinner stayed for six years and a total of 226 episodes.  The occasionally troubled Skinner enjoyed popularity with the viewing public, being promoted and un-promoted along the way to and from Detective.  In the character's final Z Cars appearance \"Distance\" (Series 9, Episode 28), Skinner was gunned down in the line of duty.  The death of any policeman in real life or fiction was still uncommon in the 1970s and this moment became one of TV's biggest dramatic shocks of the decade.It was not the only time Cullen played a character with an untimely ending.  His character Angus Hart, was the original lead of the Channel 5 soap opera Family Affairs, appearing in over 400 episodes. Angus Hart was killed in a shock storyline when the entire Hart family were killed in a boat explosion.\nCullen's stage work was extensive and saw him perform all over the country, with eight West-End productions to his name and two years with the Royal Shakespeare Company. He won rave reviews for his performance as Jay in Road to the Sea at the Orange Tree Theatre, in 2003. In 2008 he won a Gold Award for his narration of the feature-length documentary The Destiny of Britain (2007).\nAs well as his acting commitments, Cullen also wrote several television series, films and radio plays. He found time to run a very successful youth drama group in Surrey (Surrey Heath Young Actors Company) for nearly 30 years. He was assisted in this venture by his wife Yvonne Quenet, who is also an actress and drama teacher. They were married for over 30 years and had three daughters.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Family Affairs", "response": ["Chris and Annie's parents were also featured.

O'Mara was hospitalised with pneumonia at the time of her son's death and his body was not discovered for three weeks."]}, {"page": "The Aztecs (Doctor Who)", "response": ["The bloodthirsty Tlotoxl begins to suspect Barbara is not Yetaxa returned, especially because she is trying to ban human sacrifice. He sets a series of elaborate traps for her and her companions. For example, Ian Chesterton (William Russell) has been compelled into the military and fights the strongest warrior, Ixta (Ian Cullen), to prove his ability to command the Aztec forces. Thus Ixta develops a grudge against Ian and is used by Tlotoxl to try to prove that Barbara is not Yetaxa. The Doctor unwittingly tells Ixta how to defeat Ian in combat using a drugging agent, and this battle nearly ends in the Doctor witnessing his friend's death. When this fails to be conclusive, Tlotoxl convinces the subordinate priest Tonila (Walter Randall) to make a poison for Barbara; the death of Barbara following consumption of the poison would prove she is not immortal and therefore not a god. However, Ian silently warns her from his hiding place, and Barbara refuses to drink the poison. She tells Tlotoxl that she is not Yetaxa but warns him not to tell the people.", "Keith Pyott was chosen for the role of Autloc, the High Priest of the Aztecs, while Ian Cullen and Margot Van der Burgh played Ixta and Cameca, respectively. Cullen recalled that William Hartnell \"wasn't the friendliest person, but he was trying to remember all those lines\". John Ringham, an old colleague of Crockett, was chosen to play Tlotoxl; for the character, Crockett told Ringham to \"make all the children in the country hate you\". Crockett's secretary June McMullen suggested Walter Randall for the role of Tonila, having met him at a party. Producer Verity Lambert required Randall to shave his face for the role. Martial arts expert David Anderson, who had previously appeared in Marco Polo, was cast as the Captain of the Guard. Anderson also arranged the fight between Ian and Ixta for the second episode, and acted as William Russell's stunt double in the final episode. Lucarotti used Aztec-sounding names for the characters; for example, the character Ixta was derived from the Aztec city Ixtapalapa."]}, {"page": "Z-Cars", "response": ["| PC/DC Joe Skinner || Ian Cullen || 1969\u20131975 || 6\u20139 || 226"]}, {"page": "Play for Today", "response": ["| \tdata-sort-value=\"Cullen, Ian\"|Ian Cullen & John Norton"]}, {"page": "Catherine Cookson", "response": ["* Our John Willie (1980) with Ian Cullen, David Burke, James Garbutt, John Malcolm and Malcolm Terris"]}, {"page": "Voyage of the Damned", "response": ["* Ian Cullen as Radio Officer"]}, {"page": "Return of the Saint", "response": ["| 1\u201312 || 26 November 1978 || \"Signal Stop\" || Ciaran Madden, Frederick Jaeger, Ian Cullen, Brian Glover, Sabina Franklyn, Ralph Arliss, Heather Wright, Royston Tickner, George Sweeney, Renu Setna, Graham Ashley, Kevin Selway"]}, {"page": "Katy Manning", "response": ["After leaving Doctor Who, Manning appeared predominantly on stage consistently.
