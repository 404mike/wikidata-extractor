The group were the original inventors of a form of letter bomb designed to maim or kill politicians or opponents. In 1913, numerous letter bombs were sent to politicians such as the Chancellor David Lloyd George and Prime Minister H.H. Asquith, but they invariably all exploded in post offices, post boxes or in mailbags while in transit across the country. Suffragettes also once attempted to assassinate a judge they considered to be anti-women's suffrage, Sir Henry Curtis-Bennett, with a \"deadly\" letter-bomb made partly out of bullets, but the bomb was intercepted by London postal workers before it could reach him."]}, {"page": "Patrick Hastings", "response": ["The tribunal (led by Sir John Eldon Bankes, a former Lord Justice of Appeal) began sitting on 15 May 1928; Hastings, Henry Curtis-Bennett and Walter Frampton represented Savidge, and Norman Birkett represented the police.

After they arrived at Scotland Yard, Collins told Wyles that he was going to send Savidge home, and Wyles could leave. After Wyles had left, Collins began interviewing Savidge, threatening that she and Money would \"suffer severely\" if she did not tell the truth.Hyde (1960) p. 180 Savidge said that Collins' manner had become more and more familiar during the interview, and that at several points he and Sergeant Clarke had implied that they wanted her to have sexual intercourse with them.Hyde (1960) p. 181 Savidge spent almost six hours in the witness box, and her testimony left Collins looking guilty in the eyes of the tribunal.

Armstrong was defended by Sir Henry Curtis-Bennett, one of the leading criminal trial barristers of the day. Public and media interest was enormous. A year earlier there had been a trial at Carmarthen Assizes of another solicitor, Harold Greenwood, for the murder of his wife by poison, supposedly disguised as an illness. Greenwood had been acquitted. Also, the fact that the three men who brought the charges to the police included Armstrong's business rival and the latter's father-in-law looked suspicious to some people. It was believed by some that Armstrong was being framed.Jones, Frank. Beyond Suspicion: True Stories of Unexpected Killers. Toronto: Key Porter Books, 1992.  pp. 53\u201385 But despite the widespread belief that he would be acquitted, the prosecution case was a strong one. Katherine Armstrong's body was riddled with arsenic and at the time of her death the ingested quantity must have been far higher, and Armstrong had made huge purchases of arsenic. The defence had somehow to make the jury believe that Mrs Armstrong had committed suicide by getting out of bed, going downstairs and helping herself to arsenic without anyone seeing or hearing her; or that massive doses of arsenic had somehow got into her system some accidental way. All witnesses confirmed that towards the end she was almost paralysed. Dr Bernard Spilsbury insisted that the fatal dose must have been taken within twenty-four hours of death, and Hincks affirmed that for Mrs Armstrong to have taken it herself was \"absolutely impossible\"."]}, {"page": "Another Life (2001 film)", "response": ["*Bruce Purchase as Sir Henry Curtis-Bennett"]}, {"page": "Ronald True", "response": ["The trial of Ronald True for the murder of Gertrude Yates began at the Old Bailey on 1 May 1922.

The story he gave the court (which his barrister, Sir Henry Curtis-Bennett, probably did not support) sounded totally peculiar.  Thomson apparently lied (or told a half-truth) regarding his name, calling himself \"Home Thomson\" when he was arrested with Miss de Lava. \"Home\" was one of his middle names.  However he was recognised by the police.  He tried alternately to bluster and to offer a vague bribe to the constables. When he presented his version in the courtroom he said he was researching a book on the danger of left wing agitators in England and he was together with Miss de Lava waiting for the speech to begin. Had this been true, Thomson should have revealed in court who the orator was he was waiting for. He kept refusing, which, with the background of Miss de Lava as a prostitute, forfeited the credibility that Thomson thought would save him."]}, {"page": "Sydney Robinson (businessman)", "response": ["During his time in Parliament Robinson was best known for his introduction of a Bill to include farm workers in the National Unemployed Insurance scheme.

The prosecution further stated Kaye's murder had clearly been premeditated as, contrary to Mahon's claims, testimony and evidence would be introduced proving he had encouraged Kaye to state to acquaintances she and \"Derek Patterson\" would soon emigrate to South Africa, and that he had purchased the chef's knife and tenon saw used to dismember Kaye's body on 12 April, contrary to his claims to police he had bought the items after her death, on 17 April.", "On 18 July, Sir Henry Curtis-Bennett cross-examined Mahon, who remained adamant the decision to rent Officer's House had been Kaye's as a means for her to prove her love of him, and he had only acquiesced to the suggestion as a means of proving to her she \"could not possibly keep or expect to keep\" his affections, as he wished to remain faithful to his wife. He was unable to produce a satisfactory explanation as to why he had rented the property under an assumed name, or why he had embarked upon the affair using an alias. Directing questioning to the date Mahon had purchased the chef's knife and tenon saw, Mahon insisted the items had been bought on 17 April. In response, Curtis-Bennett produced an invoice proving the items had been purchased on 12 April.", "Both prosecution and defense attorneys delivered their closing arguments before the jury on 19 July. In his closing argument before the jury, Mahon's defence counsel, J. D. Cassels, made no attempt to deny Mahon's infidelity or his intimacy with Kaye. Cassels implored the jury to consider Mahon's claims of accidental death, stating: \" Have you, before you an inhuman monster, or a man who is the victim of a most extraordinary combination of circumstances?\" Prosecutor Sir Henry Curtis-Bennett outlined the ample evidence of premeditation, stating the motive for Mahon embarking upon the affair had been to rob Kaye of her savings.

Jowitt subjected Fox to a ferocious cross-examination, and Fox's excuse that he had closed his mother's door \"so that smoke should not spread into the hotel\" appeared to be cowardly. The jury therefore convicted Fox and he was hanged at Maidstone Jail on 8 April 1930, the Home Secretary having declined to intervene.

Four days later, another three suffragette bombs were discovered in the third-class carriage of a crowded passenger train arriving from Waterloo at Kingston, made out of nitroglycerine.
