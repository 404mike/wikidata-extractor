The land passed to his two brothers in a complicated bequest which made subdivision impractical until the property passed to the next generation of heirs in 1856. Ultimo was largely leased as farmland until this time, but when residential subdivision occurred the building and occupation of houses was rapid. The Harris family built housing both for sale and for tenancy and a number of industrial concerns also became established in the area. Pyrmont was already a thriving industrial and residential area by the middle of the century. The 1880s brought the first woolstores to Ultimo, the 1890s ushered in the Tramway Power House and, by the turn of the century, with the population of the peninsula at its peak, large blocks of housing were being purchased for replacement by the massive woolstores which came to dominate the area in the twentieth century. As these and the associated wharves and railyards declined in activity after World War II, Ultimo's population declined further and by the 1980s, redevelopment of the former industrial sites for office, commercial and residential purposes became the most visible activity of the area.

It was acquired by Sergeant Obadiah Ikin before being sold in 1799 to the prominent colonial businessman, John Macarthur. Macarthur is said to have named the area \"Pyrmont\" in 1806 after a spa town in Germany because of the freshwater spring known as Tinker's Well. Macarthur briefly manufactured salt at Pyrmont and constructed a windmill there. After Macarthur's death, his son Edward began clearing the land for subdivision, the windmill was demolished and Harris Street was extended to the estate in 1836. The initial subdivision was placed on the market in 1839-40 and sold well, however when the next lots were released an economic depression had begun and most of these blocks, including the site of the Old Pyrmont Cottages, did not sell. In the nineteenth century Pyrmont proved more attractive to quarrying, waterfront industry and commercial property speculators than those wanting to build large residences."]}]}}
