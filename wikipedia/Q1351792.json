His father was Rev. Thomas Butler, son of Dr. Samuel Butler, then headmaster of Shrewsbury School and later, Bishop of Lichfield. Dr Butler was the son of a tradesman and descended from a line of yeomen, but his scholarly aptitude being recognised at a young age, he had been sent to Rugby and Cambridge, where he distinguished himself.", "His only son, Thomas, wished to go into the Navy, but succumbed to paternal pressure and entered the Church of England, in which he led an undistinguished career, in contrast to his father's. Samuel's immediate family created for him an oppressive home environment (chronicled in The Way of All Flesh). Thomas Butler, states one critic, \"to make up for having been a servile son, became a bullying father.\"Clara G. Stillman, Samuel Butler, a Mid-Victorian Modern Retrieved 11 May 2020.", "Samuel Butler's relations with his parents, especially with his father, were largely antagonistic. His education began at home and included frequent beatings, as was not uncommon at the time. Samuel wrote later that his parents were \"brutal and stupid by nature\". He later recorded that his father \"never liked me, nor I him; from my earliest recollections I can call to mind no time when I did not fear him and dislike him... I have never passed a day without thinking of him many times over as the man who was sure to be against me.\" Under his parents' influence, he was set on course to follow his father into the priesthood.", "He was sent to Shrewsbury at the age of twelve, where he did not enjoy the hard life under its then headmaster, Benjamin Hall Kennedy, whom he later drew as \"Dr Skinner\" in The Way of All Flesh. Then in 1854 he went up to St John's College, Cambridge, where he obtained a first in Classics in 1858. (The graduate society of St John's is named the Samuel Butler Room (SBR) in his honour.)", "Erewhon revealed Butler's long interest in Darwin's theories of biological evolution. In 1863, four years after Darwin published On the Origin of Species, the editor of a New Zealand newspaper, The Press, published a letter captioned \"Darwin among the Machines\", written by Butler, but signed Cellarius. It compares human evolution to machine evolution, prophesying that machines would eventually replace humans in the supremacy of the earth: \"In the course of ages we shall find ourselves the inferior race\".\"Darwin among the Machines\" is reprinted in the Notebooks of Samuel Butler on Project Gutenberg: https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6173 The letter raises many of the themes now debated by proponents of the technological singularity, for example that computers evolve much faster than humans and that we are racing toward an unknowable future through explosive technological change.", "Butler also spent time criticising Darwin, partly because Butler (living in the shadow of a previous Samuel Butler) believed that Darwin had not sufficiently acknowledged his grandfather Erasmus Darwin's contribution to his theory.\"Evolution, Old & New Or, the Theories of Buffon, Dr. Erasmus Darwin and Lamarck, as compared with that of Charles Darwin\", reprinted in the Notebooks on Project Gutenberg", "George Bernard Shaw and E. M. Forster were great admirers of the later Samuel Butler, who brought a new tone into Victorian literature and began a long tradition of New Zealand utopian/dystopian literature that would culminate in works by Jack Ross, William Direen, Alan Marshall and Scott Hamilton.", "Butler's sexuality has been the subject of speculation and debate by academics. Butler never married, although for years he made regular visits to a woman, Lucie Dumas. Herbert Sussman, having arrived at the conclusion that Butler was homosexual, opined that Butler's sexual association with Dumas was merely an outlet for his \"intense same-sex desire\". Sussman's theory puts forth that Butler's assumption of \"bachelorhood\" was merely a means to retain middle-class respectability in the absence of matrimony; he observes that there is no evidence of Butler having any \"genital contact with other men\", but alleges that the \"temptations of overstepping the line strained his close male relationships\".Sussman, Herbert. \"Samuel Butler as Late-Victorian Bachelor: Regulating and Representing the Homoerotic.\" Samuel Butler: Victorian against the Grain, a Critical Overview.

Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2007.", "His first significant male friendship was with the young Charles Pauli, son of a German businessman in London, whom Butler met in New Zealand; they returned to England together in 1864 and took neighbouring apartments in Clifford's Inn. Butler had made a large profit from the sale of his New Zealand farm, and undertook to finance Pauli's study of law by paying him a regular pension, which Butler continued to do long after the friendship had cooled, until Butler had spent all of his savings. Upon Pauli's death in 1892, Butler was shocked to learn that Pauli had benefited from similar arrangements with other men and had died wealthy, but without leaving Butler anything in his will.Robinson, J.

Both Butler and Jones wept when they saw him off at the railway station in early 1895, and Butler subsequently wrote a very emotional poem, \"In Memoriam H. R.

However, once the Oscar Wilde trial began in the spring of that year, with revelations of homosexual behaviour among the literati, Butler feared being associated with the widely reported scandal and in a panic wrote to all the magazines, withdrawing his poem.", "Beginning with Malcolm Muggeridge in The Earnest Atheist: A Study of Samuel Butler (1936), a number of literary critics have arrived at the conclusion that Butler was a sublimated or repressed homosexual, and that his lifelong status as an \"incarnate bachelor\" was comparable to that of his writer contemporaries Walter Pater, Henry James, and E. M. Forster, also assumed to be homosexual but closeted.", "In a book of essays published after his death entitled God the Known and God the Unknown, Samuel Butler argued for the existence of a single, corporeal deity, declaring belief in an incorporeal deity to be essentially the same as atheism. He asserted that this \"body\" of God was, in fact, composed of the bodies of all living things on earth, a belief that may be classed as \"panzoism\". He later changed his views and decided that God was composed not only of all living things, but of all non-living things as well. He argued, however, that \"...some vaster Person [may] loom... out behind our God, and... stand in relation to him as he to us. And behind this vaster and more unknown God there may be yet another, and another, and another.\"", "Samuel Butler argued that each organism was not, in fact, distinct from its parents. Instead, he asserted that each being was merely an extension of its parents at a later stage of evolution. \"Birth,\" he once quipped, \"has been made too much of.\"", "Butler, though strongly anti-Darwinian (that is, anti-natural selection and anti-Charles Darwin) is not anti-evolutionist. He professes, indeed, to be very much of an evolutionist, and in particular one who has taken it upon his shoulders to reinstate Buffon and Erasmus Darwin, and, as a follower of these two, Lamarck, in their rightful place as the most believable explainers of the factors and method of evolution. His evolution belief is a sort of Butlerized Lamarckism, tracing back originally to Buffon and Erasmus Darwin.Vernon L. Kellogg (1912), \"Samuel Butler and Biological Memory\", Science.

I don't think Butler ever looked at anything except his own cat, but he still knew more about evolution than some of the more conventional thinkers.Gregory Bateson, Form, Substance and Difference.
