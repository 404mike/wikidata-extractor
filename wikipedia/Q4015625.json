It was released on 24 June 2015 for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and iOS, and the following year for Android. In the game, the player searches and sorts through a database of video clips from fictional police interviews, and uses the clips to solve the case of a missing man. The police interviews focus on the man's wife, Hannah Smith, portrayed by British musician Viva Seifert.", "The interview tapes feature a woman who introduces herself as Hannah Smith (Viva Seifert), whose husband, Simon, has gone missing, and is later found murdered.  Hannah admits that she and Simon had a difficult relationship, but has an alibi placing her in Glasgow at the time after an argument. As more pieces of the interviews are discovered, it is claimed that \"Hannah\" is actually two women: Hannah and Eve, identical twins separated at birth by the midwife, Florence. Florence was the widow of a war veteran who desperately wanted to have kids, but did not believe in remarrying, so she faked the death of one of the twins to claim one for herself. Florence deliberately keeps Eve indoors as much as possible, much to the latter's frustration. The twins were unaware of each other's existence until years later, at which point they decided to act as a single person, keeping a common diary and a set of rules defining their actions as \"Hannah\". When Eve wanted to conduct independent activities, she would wear a blonde wig.", "Barlow decided to feature live action footage in the game after becoming frustrated with his previous projects, particularly with the technical challenge of translating an actor's performance into a game engine. Barlow set out to work with an actor on Her Story, having enjoyed the process while working at Climax Studios, albeit with a larger budget. He contacted Viva Seifert, whom he had intermittently worked with on Legacy of Kain: Dead Sun for a year, before its cancellation. He felt that Seifert is \"very good at picking up a line and intuitively pulling a lot of the subtext into her performance\", which led him to believe that she was \"perfect\" for the role in Her Story. When Barlow asked Seifert to audition, he sent her a 300-page script, which he managed to reduce to 80 pages, by altering font size, as well as some dialogue; she accepted the role."]}, {"page": "Viva Seifert (athlete)", "response": ["#REDIRECT Viva Seifert"]}, {"page": "The Game Awards 2015", "response": ["* Viva Seifert as Hannah Smith\u00a0\u2013 Her Story"]}, {"page": "New York Videogame Critics Circle", "response": ["| Viva Seifert as Hannah Smith (Her Story)"]}, {"page": "England at the 1990 Commonwealth Games", "response": ["|Viva Seifert\t               ||all-around, ball, hoop, ribbon, rope||2 x bronze"]}]}}
