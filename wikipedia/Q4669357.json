The style of his work \u2013 refined but vigorous compared to the work of contemporaries \u2013 has earned him a place in the pantheon of the best of 20th-century graphic designers. In acknowledging his power as a propagandist, he claimed, \"I wind the spring and the public, in looking at the poster, will have that spring released in its mind.\" Because of the length of his career \u2013 over six decades \u2013 his work is essentially a record of the era's social history. Some of Britain's most iconic images include those by Games. An example is the \"Join the ATS\" poster of 1941, nicknamed the \"blonde bombshell\" recruitment poster. His work is recognised for its \"striking colour, bold graphic ideas, and beautifully integrated typography\".", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Festival of Britain", "response": ["The graphic designer for the Festival was Abram Games, who created its emblem, the Festival Star."]}, {"page": "Stockwell tube station", "response": ["The station was expanded to accommodate the Victoria line, whose extension from Victoria to Brixton opened on 23 July 1971.

A British Transport Police station was later built above the station in 1987, replacing a station at Lambeth North, as part of a BTP initiative to increase police presence across London Underground.

On 4 August 1962, when Radio Times was again revamped, the masthead was replaced with one incorporating the words in the Clarendon typeface; while the main change was the reduction of BBC radio schedules for three stations to a double-page spread brought down into size, the magazine now generally had between 60 and 68 pages, as compared to the relaunched format from two years earlier, which contained only 52 pages."]}, {"page": "GKN", "response": ["As a result of the large number of mergers, Abram Games was commissioned to develop a new corporate identity in 1969 when the distinctive angular GKN symbol was created and the new company colours of blue and white introduced.Design 1969, issue 243 page 82.

As the fighting progressed, the British government became increasingly committed to the idea of building a fairer society when peacetime came. As this was articulated through propaganda, Modernist architecture became the visual expression for this radiant future. Abram Games designed a series of posters comparing the promise of modernism, one featuring the Finsbury Health Centre, with the appalling realities of pre war Britain. The uncompromising title to each poster was: 'Your Britain- Fight for it Now'. A further sign of this political shift was the erection in 1941 of a statue in memorial to Lenin.  Designed by Lubetkin, the memorial marked the site of Lenin's lodgings at Holford Square, London in 1902/3.
