The style of his work \u2013 refined but vigorous compared to the work of contemporaries \u2013 has earned him a place in the pantheon of the best of 20th-century graphic designers. In acknowledging his power as a propagandist, he claimed, \"I wind the spring and the public, in looking at the poster, will have that spring released in its mind.\" Because of the length of his career \u2013 over six decades \u2013 his work is essentially a record of the era's social history. Some of Britain's most iconic images include those by Games. An example is the \"Join the ATS\" poster of 1941, nicknamed the \"blonde bombshell\" recruitment poster. His work is recognised for its \"striking colour, bold graphic ideas, and beautifully integrated typography\".", "link_mentions": {}}}
