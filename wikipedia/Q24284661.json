Brentford went on to have their best season at that time in the Football League, ending 1929 in second place and ascending to the top of the Third Division South on 25 January 1930. The good results were due to a consistently fit starting XI, which went unchanged for 21 consecutive matches in all competitions between 2 November 1929 and 15 March 1930, a club record. Top spot was held onto until a 0\u20130 draw with Exeter City on 29 March saw Plymouth Argyle overtake the Bees and automatic promotion was effectively conceded after successive defeats in mid-April. Brentford finished as runners-up and would remain in the Third Division South for 1930\u201331. The Bees finished the season with four players scoring 15 goals or more \u2013 Billy Lane (33), Jack Lane (19), John Payne (16) and Cecil Blakemore (15).", "|Harry Salt", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Harry Salt", "| Harry Salt"]}, {"page": "1930\u201331 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["|Harry Salt", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Harry Salt"]}, {"page": "1931\u201332 Brentford F.C. season", "response": ["|Harry Salt", "| style=\"text-align:left;\" |Harry Salt", "| Harry Salt"]}]}}
