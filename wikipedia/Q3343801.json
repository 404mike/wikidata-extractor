A younger generation of novelists that emerged in the 1960s and 1970s included Shena Mackay, Alan Spence, Allan Massie and the work of William McIlvanney. From the 1980s Scottish literature enjoyed another major revival, this time led by a group of Glasgow writers associated with critic, poet and teacher Philip Hobsbaum and editor Peter Kravitz. In the 1990s major, prize winning, Scottish novels, often overtly political, that emerged from this movement included Irvine Welsh's Trainspotting (1993), Warner's Morvern Callar (1995), Gray's Poor Things (1992) and Kelman's How Late It Was, How Late (1994). Scottish crime fiction has been a major area of growth, particularly the success of Edinburgh's Ian Rankin and his Inspector Rebus novels. This period also saw the emergence of a new generation of Scottish poets that became leading figures on the UK stage, including Carol Ann Duffy, who was named as Poet Laureate in May 2009, the first woman, the first Scot and the first openly gay poet to take the post."]}, {"page": "Stirling", "response": ["#The University of Stirling (1973) colour and sound 19 min \u2013 1970s campus, students and teachers (includes Norman MacCaig)."]}, {"page": "List of poets", "response": ["*Norman MacCaig (1910\u20131996), Scottish poet"]}, {"page": "University of Stirling", "response": ["* Norman MacCaig, reader in poetry"]}, {"page": "Sorley MacLean", "response": ["Between 1939 and 1941, he taught at Boroughmuir High School in Edinburgh, and in Hawick.

MacLean, also a noted historian, published two influential papers on nineteenth-century Gaelic poetry in Transactions of the  in 1938 and 1939, which challenged the Celtic Twilight view of Gaelic literature. MacLean accused the \"Celtic Twilightists\" with \"attributing to Gaelic poetry the very opposite of every quality which it actually has\", at which they only succeeded because they catered to a credulous English-speaking audience.
