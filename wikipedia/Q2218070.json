While engaged with his first book illustrations, various contests were taking place in London, as a way in which the government could combat the growing Germanic Nazarenes style and promote a truly national English school of art. Tenniel planned to enter the 1845 House of Lords competition amongst artists to win the opportunity to design the mural decoration of the new Palace of Westminster. Despite missing the deadline, he submitted a  cartoon, An Allegory of Justice, to a competition for designs for the mural decoration of the new Palace of Westminster.

Landon had taken \"refuge from [slander] . . . in union with a man utterly incapable of appreciating her or making her happy, and [she] went out with him to his government at the Gold Coast -- to die\" (ibid.). Her death was \"not even -- tragical as such an ending would have been . . . to wither before the pestilential influences that steam up from that wilderness of swamp and jungle\" but rather \"to die a violent death -- a fearful one\" (ibid.). Here Hall asserts his belief that Landon was murdered by her husband's common-law wife: \"unhappy 'L.E.L.' was murdered I have had a doubt. . . . She landed at Cape Coast Castle in July, 1838, and on the 15th of October she was dead . . . from having accidentally taken a dose of prussic acid. But where was she to have procured that poison? . . . .It was not among the contents of the medicine-chest she took out from England\" (ibid., pp.\u00a0395\u2013396). Rather, claims Hall, after arriving in Africa, \"Maclean left her on board while he went to arrange matters on shore. A negro woman was there, with four or five children -- his children; she had to be sent into the interior to make room for her legitimate successor. It is understood the negress was the daughter of a king . . . [and] from the moment 'L.E.L.' landed her life was at the mercy of her rival; that by her hand she was done to death I am all but certain\" (ibid., p.\u00a0396)."]}, {"page": "The Deserted Village", "response": ["There is no single place which has been identified as the village of the poem's title. Although some contend that the location of the poem's deserted village is unknown, others note that Auburn village close to Athlone is the likely subject of Goldsmith's poem. Travel-guide authors Samuel Carter Hall and Anna Hall write in their 1853 Hand-books for Ireland: The West and Connamara that the British tourist should disembark from their train at Athlone's Moate Station and \"make a pilgrimage to the renowned village of Auburn\" located six miles from Moate Station (Hall & Hall, 1853, pp. 4\u20135). The Halls explain that although Goldsmith was born in the village of Pallas (also known as Pallice or Pallasmore), his father was soon appointed to the Kilkenny-West Rectory, and he therefore moved his family (circa 1730) to the village of Auburn, also known as Lissoy and, to the locals, as \"The Pigeons\" (ibid.). Lissoy has \"now and for nearly a century [been] known as Auburn\" and is \"so marked on the maps\" (ibid.). For a similar claim regarding Auburn in County Westmeath as the Auburn of Goldsmith's The Deserted Village, see J. Stirling Coyne and N.P. Willis's The Scenery and Antiquities of Ireland published c. 1841 (Vol. 1, Chap. 4). Others speculate merely that \"the description may have been influenced by Goldsmith's memory of his childhood in rural Ireland, and his travels around England.\" "]}, {"page": "Thomas Crofton Croker", "response": ["Because Croker had lost the manuscript after collecting it from the field, he had to reconstruct the anthology through help from other writers, such as William Maginn, David Richard Pigot, his friend Joseph Humphreys, Thomas Keightley, and R.

Humphreys, a Quaker, was a companion during Croker's excursions into the south 1812\u20131815.

During his short spell in London, Paton became acquainted with Samuel Carter Hall, editor of The Art Journal, and he commissioned Paton to design some of the illustrations for his 1842 book The Book of British Ballads.
