Prime Minister Tony Blair frequently expressed support for the United States in this matter, while Members of Parliament (MPs) were divided. Blair experienced a significant rebellion from many Labour MPs and in a debate in the House of Commons, he achieved a parliamentary majority with the support of most Conservative MPs and Ulster Unionists. Although the Conservatives were supportive of the Government's stance as a whole, a significant minority of their MPs rebelled against the party line, including figures such as Kenneth Clarke. The Liberal Democrats opposed the war, and their MPs were visibly unanimous on the issue. One former cabinet minister delivered a stinging personal attack on the Prime Minister, calling his behaviour 'reckless'. Robin Cook MP and a few other government ministers resigned to the backbenches over the issue. Clare Short MP threatened to resign from the cabinet, but then remained for two months before finally resigning on May 12, 2003. Cook, a former Foreign Secretary and at the time Leader of the House of Commons, delivered a resignation speech, which was received with a standing ovation.

He had vigorously opposed the privatisation of the industry while the Labour Party was in opposition, and disliked the party's policy, established in 1996 just before the flotation of Railtrack on the London Stock Exchange, of committing to renationalise the industry only when resources allowed, which he saw as meaning that it would never be done. Reluctantly, he supported the alternative policy, produced by then shadow transport secretary Clare Short, that the industry should be subjected to closer regulation by the to-be-created Strategic Rail Authority (in the case of the passenger train operators) and the Rail Regulator (in the case of the monopoly and dominant elements in the industry, principally Railtrack). The policy was spelled out in some detail in the Labour Party's statement in the June 1996 prospectus for the sale of Railtrack shares, and was widely regarded as having depressed the price of the shares."]}, {"page": "University of Leeds", "response": ["Former Leeds students involved in international organisations and politics include multiple current and former UK Members of Parliament and politicians, including current Leader of the Labour Party Keir Starmer, former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, and cabinet ministers Clare Short and Sayeeda Warsi.

Some readers regarded the feature as harmless entertainment. However, many cultural conservatives viewed it as softcore pornography inappropriate for publication in generally circulated national newspapers, while many feminists saw it as a misogynistic tradition that demeaned women. Some politicians, notably former Labour Party MP Clare Short, campaigned to have Page 3 banned, but legislation was never enacted against it. In 2012, activists launched the No More Page 3 campaign, which pressured newspaper editors and owners to end the feature voluntarily, arguing that Page 3 was an outdated and sexist tradition that negatively impacted women and girls. The campaign won support from 140 MPs as well as a number of universities, trade unions, and charities.", "Page 3 was controversial and divisive throughout its history. Its defenders often represented the feature as an inoffensive aspect of British culture, as when Conservative Party MP Richard Drax in 2013 called it a \"national institution\" that provided \"light and harmless entertainment\". Many of its critics considered it demeaning and objectifying to women, or as softcore pornography inappropriate for publication in a national newspaper readily available to children. Some politicians, notably including Labour Party MPs Clare Short, Harriet Harman, and Stella Creasy, Liberal Democrats MP Lynne Featherstone, and Green Party MP Caroline Lucas, took stances against Page 3 and made efforts to have it removed from newspapers. Meanwhile, The Sun vigorously defended the feature, often responding to criticism with ad hominem attacks. When Short tried in 1986 to introduce a House of Commons bill banning topless models from British newspapers, The Sun ran a \"Stop Crazy Clare\" campaign, distributing free car stickers, calling Short a \"killjoy\", printing unflattering images of her, and polling readers on whether they would prefer to see Short's face or the back of a bus.", "As a co-founder of Women in Journalism, Rebekah Brooks was reported to be personally offended by Page 3, and was widely expected to terminate it when she became The Sun's first female editor in January 2003. However, upon assuming her editorship, Brooks became a staunch defender of the feature, calling its models \"intelligent, vibrant young women who appear in The Sun out of choice and because they enjoy the job\". When Clare Short stated in 2004 that she wanted to \"take the pornography out of our press\", saying \"I'd love to ban [Page 3 because it] degrades women and our country\", Brooks launched a \"Hands Off Page 3\" campaign that included superimposing Short's face on a topless woman's body, calling her \"fat and jealous\", and parking a double-decker bus with a delegation of Page 3 models outside her home. The Sun also called Harman a \"feminist fanatic\" and Featherstone a \"battleaxe\" because of their stances against Page 3. Brooks later said that she regretted The Sun's \"cruel and harsh\" attacks on Short, listing them among the mistakes she had made as editor.", "The Leveson Inquiry heard arguments for and against Page 3. Feminist advocacy groups argued that Page 3 was part of an endemic culture of tabloid sexism that routinely objectified women, while Sun editor Dominic Mohan defended the feature as an \"innocuous British institution\" that had become \"part of British society\". In his report, Lord Justice Leveson stated that complaints of sexism over topless pictures fell outside his remit of investigating media ethics, but merited consideration by any new press regulator. Noting Mohan's \"spirited defence\" of Page 3, Leveson stated that \"many will feel that Page 3 of The Sun raises a taste and decency issue and none other\". Clare Short questioned Leveson's finding, stating: \"Surely the depiction of half the population in a way that is now illegal on workplace walls and before the watershed in broadcasting, is an issue of media ethics?\"", "Longtime campaigners celebrated the decision. Clare Short called the end of Page 3 in The Sun \"an important public victory for dignity\", while Nicky Morgan, then serving as Minister for Women and Equalities, called the move \"a small but significant step towards improving the media portrayal of women and girls\". Caroline Lucas welcomed the decision to discontinue topless images but criticized the transition to clothed glamour, saying: \"So long as The Sun reserves its right to print the odd topless shot, and reserves its infamous page for girls clad in bikinis, the conversation isn't over\". Others defended the feature and the women who posed for it, with glamour model Nicola McLean telling ITV's Good Morning Britain that: \"[Page 3 models] are all very strong-minded women that have made our own choice and feel very happy with what we are doing. We certainly don't feel like we have been victimised\". In a televised debate with Harriet Harman and Germaine Greer, model Chloe Goodman asked: \"Why should feminist women tell other women how to live their lives?\" Harman responded: \"In a hundred years' time, if you look back at the newspapers of this country, and you see women standing in their knickers with their breasts showing, what would you think about women's role in society?\" Goodman replied: \"What do we think of women and men a thousand years ago, when we see statues [of them] nude? All over the world there are [depictions of] bodies in the nude, so I don't understand why it's just Page 3 that's being targeted\"."]}, {"page": "Secretary of State for International Development", "response": ["| Clare Short"]}, {"page": "Valerie Amos, Baroness Amos", "response": ["When she was appointed Secretary of State for International Development on 12 May 2003, following the resignation of Clare Short, Amos became the first Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) woman to serve as a Cabinet minister.
