With the American singer David Reece (ex-Accept) and his Sainted Sinners (including Frank Pan\u00e9 (Bonfire) and Ferdy Doernberg), another big name joined the label in 2016. In 2017, the European distribution of Beasto Blanco was taken over by Alice Cooper bassist Chuck Garric and Calico Cooper, the daughter of Alice Cooper. Souldrinker and Mystic Prophecy guitarist Markus Pohl made a debut in the same year. The increasing attention in the music scene led to larger and more experienced bands joining the label in 2018: Undertow and the German thrash metal band Necronomicon. With the Italians Alight and the Swiss Bloodlost, other bands joined. The year was rounded off by Mission in Black and Ginger Red. At the turn of the year 2019, Bodo Schopf (drummer from Michael Schenker and The Sweet) and David Readman (Pink Cream 69, Voodoo Circle, Almanac) joined Pendulum of Fortune and Dark Blue Inc. u. a. with Frank Pan\u00e9 (Bonfire), G\u00f6ran Edman (Ex-Malmsteen), Hal Patino (Maryann Cotton, Ex-King Diamond, Ex-Pretty Maids) and Harry Reischmann. The latter came up with a guest appearance by Ian Paice (Deep Purple) on the debut CD. The orientation of the labels, both to oblige bands from the immediate region and to perform internationally, ensured that more international acts joined the label in 2019: Nightqueen from Belgium and, for the first time, a band from Australia - Envenomed. In the summer of 2019, another old friend came with the Austrians Garagedays and the Sons Of Sounds from the Karlsruhe area: David Reece returned to El Puerto Records after a short interlude to continue his solo career there, as well as the Danish / US combo Maryann Cotton. Also from Denmark: Phonomics. But expansion continued in 2020 as well. Welicoruss from Siberia joined them, followed by two German metal bands (Scorged - Saarland, Red To Grey - Bavaria)."]}]}}
