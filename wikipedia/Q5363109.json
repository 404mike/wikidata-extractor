In 1884, he published a book about Stratford-on-Avon, with illustrations by Edward Hull.

These five novels were published under the name of Edmund Yates. Hoey was sole author of the last work. Eventually, the secret of her authorship was revealed, and she also helped Yates in 1874 to plan, and then write, The World. P. D. Edwards in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography describes this account, circulated by Anthony Trollope who held a grudge against Yates, as \"probably spurious\"."]}]}}
