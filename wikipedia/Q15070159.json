Immediately afterwards Charles and Emma rushed off to the railway station, raising their relative's eyebrows, and ate their sandwiches and toasted their future from a \"bottle of water\" on the train.

In September 1880 Charles stayed with Erasmus while his portrait was painted by John Collier. Shortly afterwards, Erasmus became gravely ill and died quietly on 26 August. Emma Darwin broke the news to Charles, who commented that he had seen Erasmus dying slowly \"for many years\", not \"a happy man\" but always kindhearted, clearheaded and affectionate. The funeral at Downe on 1 September was taken by their cousin John Allen Wedgwood, now 85, who had officiated at the wedding of Charles and Emma. Charles, looking \"old and ill\" in a long black funeral cloak, was a picture of \"sad reverie\" as the coffin was lowered. A marble slab was arranged, with words by Thomas Carlyle: \"one of the sincerest, truest and most modest of men\"."]}, {"page": "John Wedgwood", "response": ["* John Allen Wedgwood (1796\u20131882), usually known as Allen Wedgwood, vicar of Maer, Staffordshire"]}, {"page": "John Wedgwood (horticulturist)", "response": ["* The Rev.
