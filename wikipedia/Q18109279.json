The call-out of key parties by telephone and telegram went well, and they assembled at their drill halls within a few hours.

Equipment was drawn from mobilisation stores, and the detachments ferried out to their war stations. Despite some failures and problems, the emergency positions covering London were manned and most of the equipment was in place within 24 hours. The emergency mobilisation lasted nearly three weeks before the TA units were released on 14 October.Routledge, pp. 62\u20133.
