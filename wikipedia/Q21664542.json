When he was ten, he ran away from home to live with an uncle in Padiham. He continued weaving but also received some education at the local Unitarian chapel.Early in the 1860s, Holmes married and the couple moved to Burnley. There, he was a leading founder member of the Burnley Weavers' Association. In 1871, he was elected as its president and served until his death. He focused his activities on promoting collective bargaining for wages; he opposed the eight-hour day and supported child labour, as he believed that they contributed to the weavers' comparative advantage over workers elsewhere.\nDespite his moderation, he was blacklisted by employers and instead took work as a rag-and-bone man to support his family, alongside his union role. In 1878, he led the union in part of a major but unsuccessful county-wide strike. That led, in 1884, to the creation of the Northern Counties Amalgamated Association of Weavers, with Holmes as president.Holmes was a member of the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress (TUC), where he opposed the new unions, which organised unskilled labour, and attended various international conferences representing the organisation.Politically, Holmes was a support of the Liberal Party, and he served on Burnley Town Council. He was an opponent of socialism and of the Labour Party when it emerged.  However, his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and designated successor, David Shackleton, would join the Labour Party.Holmes stood down from the TUC in 1902 and became less active elsewhere.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "David Holmes", "response": ["David Holmes may refer to:", "* David Holmes (academic administrator), former Registrar of the University of Oxford", "* David Holmes (musician) (born 1969), Northern Irish electronic musician and composer", "* David Holmes, drummer and vocalist for Servant", "* David Holmes (actor) (born 1981), British stuntman and actor in the Harry Potter films", "* David Holmes (politician) (1769\u20131832), last governor of the Mississippi Territory and the first governor of the State of Mississippi", "* David Holmes (trade unionist) (1843\u20131906), British trade unionist", "* David Holmes (journalist) (1926\u20132014), BBC political editor", "* David Holmes (diplomat), United States Department of State official", "* David Holmes (businessman), former Chairman of Rangers F.C."]}, {"page": "James Mawdsley (trade unionist)", "response": ["In 1895 there was a nascent plan for Mawdsley to stand for Parliament as a Conservative, in conjunction with David Holmes of the Weavers' union as a Liberal, both being regarded as Labour representatives.Bealey and Pelling (1958), p. 17."]}, {"page": "Amalgamated Weavers' Association", "response": [":1884: David Holmes"]}, {"page": "United Textile Factory Workers' Association", "response": [":1889: David Holmes"]}, {"page": "Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress", "response": ["|rowspan=2| David HolmesWeavers", "| David HolmesWeavers", "|rowspan=6| David HolmesWeavers", "|rowspan=2| David HolmesWeavers"]}, {"page": "Amie Hicks", "response": ["Hicks stood for the London School Board in 1885 and 1888, although she was not elected.

Hyndman, to unsuccessfully contest the Burnley constituency at the 1895 UK general election.  The following year, Liberal-Labour members of the union, such as president David Holmes, overturned the socialist policies, leading SDF supporters to form a small breakaway union.
