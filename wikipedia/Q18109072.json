She made a name for herself as the author of a much-read memoir of her famous father.\nSome of Smith's often-quoted sayings were first recorded in Lady Holland's memoir, including:Why, you never expected justice from a company, did you? They have neither a soul to lose, nor a body to kick. and\nThank God for tea! What would the world do without tea? How did it exist? I am glad I was not born before tea. I can drink any quantity when I have not tasted wine.; otherwise I am haunted by blue devils by day, and dragons by night.\nHer daughters were Caroline Holland (1834\u20131909; author of Notebooks of a Spinster Lady, published posthumously in 1919) and Gertrude Holland (1840\u20131898).", "link_mentions": {}}}
