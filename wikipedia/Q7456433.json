Achiase District is relatively a new district requiring infrastructural development across all sectors. Akim Achiase is the main commercial Centre with two major market days in a week on Tuesdays and Fridays. On such days, the district capital gets busy with heavy trading primarily from traders across towns and villages in the district and also from nearby districts like Birim South, Birim Central and Asikuma-Odoben-Brakwa. The district currently has two senior high schools namely Achiase Senior High and Aperade Senior High. The district also has railway coverage from Achiase through to Aperade but currently require investment as the lines have been idle for over a decade. The Ghana Armed Forces also has a Jungle Warfare Training School in Achiase called Seth Anthony Barracks as it was named after Major Seth Anthony, the first black African Soldier to become an officer in the British Army.
