A week later, half-back Ernie Braidwood netted his first of the season as the team secured another 1\u20131 draw away at Wrexham's Racecourse Ground. In the first home match of the new year, on 17 January 1925, Nelson atoned for their defeat to Accrington Stanley earlier in the season with a 4\u20131 win thanks to two goals from Eddleston, one from Chadwick, and a first goal in almost three months for Cameron. Clem Rigg scored two penalties the following week as the side beat Barrow to move above Bradford Park Avenue into fifth position in the Third Division North. On 7 February Nelson won their third consecutive home fixture, beating Tranmere Rovers by four goals to one. Left-half Herbert Butterworth made his senior debut for the club against Tranmere, despite signing from Wolverhampton Wanderers almost two years previously,Dykes (2009), p. 25 while Chadwick scored twice in one game for the first time. A trip to Walsall seven days later brought a first away victory of 1925 for the team as goals from Chadwick and Hoad gave Nelson a 2\u20131 win, which elevated them to third place in the league. A narrow win against Wigan Borough at Seedhill on 21 February lifted Nelson further up the table into second position, behind only Darlington. The team ended a successful February with a fourth victory of the month, beating Halifax Town 4\u20132 before a crowd of 10,000 spectators at The Shay."]}, {"page": "List of Rochdale A.F.C. seasons", "response": ["Bill Watson"]}]}}
