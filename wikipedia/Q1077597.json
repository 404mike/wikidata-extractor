A critic comments:He writes \"what he likes\" in the way Strindberg does, not trying to characterise his characters, but letting them perform his own specialities, a kind of platform for his own musical specialities. As in Strindberg where you feel every sentence stands for itself and the characters are sort of borrowed for the use of saying them (borrowed to flesh out the text, rather than the other way round), that they've been out for the day. In Gerald's opera the whole apparatus - for that's what it is - takes on a kind of surrealistic shape, like one person's torso on someone else's legs being forced to walk, half the characters in the opera and half the composer.Chris Newman, \"TIOBE von GB\", in: Musik Texte 138, August 2013.", "*The Importance of Being Earnest, libretto by Gerald Barry after Oscar Wilde (2010)Chris Newman, \"TIOBE von GB\", in: Musik Texte 138, August 2013."]}, {"page": "Chris Newman", "response": ["Chris Newman may refer to:", "*Chris Newman (sound engineer) (born 1940), Academy Award-winning sound mixer and director", "*Chris Newman (footballer) (born 1982), Australian rules footballer for the Richmond Football Club (AFL)", "*Chris Newman (artist) (born 1958), composer, author and performance artist", "*Chris Newman (actor) (born 1987), Irish actor from the show Aisling's Diary", "*Chris Newman (musician) (born 1953), American songwriter, singer, guitarist, recording artist", "*Chris Newman (guitarist) (born 1952), British guitarist and songwriter", "*Chris Newman (field hockey) (born 1990), British field hockey player"]}, {"page": "Tania Chen", "response": ["Tania Chen is a mixed media artist and interdisciplinary pianist who composes experimental, improvised and contemporary music.
