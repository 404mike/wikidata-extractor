The Irish word fir means \"men\" and the word bolg/bolc can mean a belly, bag, sack, bellows, and so forth. Kuno Meyer and R. A. Stewart Macalister argue that the name comes from the term Fir i mBolgaib, meaning \"breeches wearers\", literally \"men in (baggy) breeches\", which could be interpreted as a term of contempt for the \"lower orders\". Macalister suggests this expression had fallen out of use by the time the Lebor Gab\u00e1la was written, and the writers tried to make sense of it by creating a story about men with bags.Online Index to the Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn (Book of Invasions) based on R.A.S.
