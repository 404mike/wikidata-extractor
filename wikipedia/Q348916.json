His first book, In Patagonia (1977), established Chatwin as a travel writer, although he considered himself instead a storyteller, interested in bringing to light unusual tales. He won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for his novel On the Black Hill (1982), while his novel Utz (1988) was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize. In 2008 The Times ranked Chatwin as number 46 on their list of \"50 Greatest British Writers Since 1945.\"\nChatwin was born in Sheffield. After completing his secondary education at Marlborough College, he went to work at the age of 18 at Sotheby's in London, where he gained an extensive knowledge of art and eventually ran the auction house's Antiquities and Impressionist Art departments. In 1966 he left Sotheby's to read archaeology at the University of Edinburgh, but he abandoned his studies after two years to pursue a career as a writer.\nThe Sunday Times Magazine hired Chatwin in 1972. He travelled the world for work and interviewed figures such as the politicians Indira Gandhi and Andr\u00e9 Malraux. He left the magazine in 1974 to visit Patagonia, Argentina; a trip that inspired his first book. He wrote five other books, including The Songlines (1987), about Australia, which was a bestseller. His work is credited with reviving the genre of travel writing, and his works influenced other writers such as William Dalrymple, Claudio Magris, Philip Marsden, Luis Sep\u00falveda and Rory Stewart.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Dahomey", "response": ["The Kingdom of Dahomey has been depicted in a number of different literary works of fiction or creative nonfiction. In the novel Robur the Conqueror (1886) by Jules Verne, the crew and passengers of the Albatross interrupt an act of human sacrifice. In Dahomey (1903) was a successful Broadway musical, the first full-length Broadway musical written entirely by African Americans, in the early 20th century. Novelist Paul Hazoum\u00e9's first novel Doguicimi (1938) was based on decades of research into the oral traditions of the Kingdom of Dahomey during the reign of King Ghezo. The anthropologist Judith Gleason wrote a novel, Ag\u00f5t\u0129me: Her Legend (1970), centered on one of the wives of a king of Dahomey in the late 18th century, who offends her husband who sells her to slavery in Brazil; she makes a bargain with a vodu (deity), putting her son on the throne of Dahomey and bringing her home. Another novel tracing the background of a slave, this time in the United States, was The Dahomean, or The Man from Dahomey (1971), by the African-American novelist Frank Yerby; its hero is an aristocratic warrior. In the third of George McDonald Fraser's Flashman novels, Flash for Freedom (1971), Flashman dabbles in the slave trade and visits Dahomey. The Viceroy of Ouidah (1980) by Bruce Chatwin is the story of a Brazilian who, hoping to make his fortune from slave trading, sails to Dahomey in 1812, befriending its unbalanced king and coming to a bad end. The book was later adapted into the film Cobra Verde (1987) directed by Werner Herzog. The main character of one of the two parallel stories in Will Do Magic for Small Change (2016) by Andrea Hairston is Kehinde, a Yoruba woman forced into the Dahomean army; she struggles with divided loyalty, and after the fall of Behanzin, joins a French entertainment troupe who intend to exhibit her as an Amazon at the Chicago World's Fair. The Booker Prize-winning novel Girl, Woman, Other (2019) by Bernardine Evaristo features a character named Amma who writes and directs a play titled The Last Amazon of Dahomey."]}, {"page": "January 18", "response": ["*1989 \u2013 Bruce Chatwin, English-French author (b. 1940)"]}, {"page": "May 13", "response": ["*1940 \u2013 Bruce Chatwin, English author (d. 1989)"]}, {"page": "Slavery", "response": ["| Bruce Chatwin"]}, {"page": "Salman Rushdie", "response": ["Rushdie has been married four times.

Although Pigafetta's account does not describe how this name came about, subsequent popular interpretations gave credence to a derivation meaning \"land of the big feet\". However, this etymology is questionable. The term is most likely derived from an actual character name, \"Patag\u00f3n\", a savage creature confronted by Primale\u00f3n of Greece, the hero in the homonymous Spanish chivalry novel (or knight-errantry tale) by Francisco V\u00e1zquez. This book, published in 1512, was the sequel of the romance Palmer\u00edn de Oliva;it was much in vogue at the time, and a favorite reading of Magellan. Magellan's perception of the natives, dressed in skins, and eating raw meat, clearly recalled the uncivilized Patag\u00f3n in V\u00e1zquez's book.
