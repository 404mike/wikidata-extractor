Squads of young men would drag barrels of burning tar through town on sledges, making mischief. Concern over public safety and levels of drunkenness led to a change in the celebrations, and saw them drawing inspiration from the islands' Viking history.  After the abolition of tar barrelling around 1874\u20131880, permission was eventually obtained for torch processions. The first Yule torch procession took place in 1876. The first torch celebration on Up Helly Aa Day took place in 1881. The following year the torchlit procession was significantly enhanced and institutionalised through a request by a Lerwick civic body to hold another Up Helly Aa torch procession for the visit of Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh.Callum G. Brown, Up-helly-aa: Custom, Culture, and Community in Shetland (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1998), , pp. 126-139. The first galley was introduced and burned in 1889. In 1894 Haldane Burgess, a Shetland author, wrote the book The Viking Path which was a major influence in creating the Viking theme of the Up Helly Aa festival.  Burgess also wrote the Up Helly Aa Song which is sung at the burning of the replica longship and elsewhere. The honorary role of the 'Jarl' was introduced to the festival in the early twentieth century. In reality, despite many sources claiming these ancient origins, the festival, and many like it, were products of Victorian do-goodery. The Lerwick Up-Helly Aa was first established by the Total Abstinence Society in the 1870s to give the young men who would otherwise drink themselves silly something to do. The name itself derives from Upholiday, the lowland Scots' word for Twelfth Day, and was brought by them to the Shetland Islands in the 19th century.Ronald Hutton, The Stations of the Sun: A History of the Ritual Year in Britain (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), p. 43 ff."]}, {"page": "Jakob Jakobsen", "response": ["When Jakobsen left the Faroes for Leith near Edinburgh, his only knowledge of the language of Shetland was drawn from Thomas Edmondston's glossary and those parts of George Stewart's Shetland Fireside Tales that are written in Shetland dialect.

He arrived in Shetland in 1893 and during his field work there he interviewed a large number of Shetland dialect speakers and scholars, including Haldane Burgess, James Stout Angus, John Irvine, Robert Jamieson (1827-1899), James Inkster, John Nicolson, and Laurence Williamson."]}, {"page": "Dunrossness", "response": ["Dunrossness is associated with a number of eminent people, such as Haldane Burgess, George Stewart, Sir Herbert J.C.

The first widely published writers were two daughters of the Lerwick gentry, Dorothea Primrose Campbell and Margaret Chalmers, who wrote for the most part in a rather formal English. Subsequent Shetland dialect writers such as Haldane Burgess, James Stout Angus, George Stewart and Basil R Anderson helped forge the written form of the native tongue."]}, {"page": "Burgess (surname)", "response": ["* Haldane Burgess (1862\u20131927), Shetland writer"]}, {"page": "1927 in Scotland", "response": ["* 16 January \u2013 Haldane Burgess historian, poet, novelist, violinist, linguist and socialist, a noted figure in Shetland's cultural history (born 1862)"]}, {"page": "List of Scottish poets", "response": ["*Haldane Burgess"]}, {"page": "1927 in British music", "response": ["date unknown \u2013 Haldane Burgess, writer and musician, 65"]}]}}
