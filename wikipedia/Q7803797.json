After retiring from playing, he became an administrator, serving the Middlesex County Cricket Club, the Test and County Cricket Board (TCCB) and the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB). His most notable cricket administrative roles were as chief executive of the TCCB and its successor ECB from 1996 to 2004. He later became the chief executive of the Sport and Recreation Alliance (formerly the CCPR) from 2005 until 2014. He left the Sport and Recreation Alliance and set up TML Sports Connections, a sports consultancy. He is also a member of the Cabinet Office Sport Honours Committee.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Shrewsbury School", "response": ["Old Salopians who have played county cricket include James Taylor, Scott Ellis, Nick Pocock, The Hon.

Cork's international career came to an end in 2002, allowing him to dedicate himself to playing season long for Derbyshire.  With the internal problems at the county, Cork's form with both bat and ball was erratic: his first-class bowling average in 2001 was 51.50, 18.90 in 2002, and 27.26 in 2003. His performances in one-day cricket remained more consistent.  The 2003 season was also one of Cork's most controversial.  Following a Twenty20 fixture against Leicestershire in the Twenty20 Cup, Cork branded Australian Brad Hodge a cheat after he appeared to catch Steven Selwood after crossing the boundary rope. He also branded the response of the England and Wales Cricket Board's chief executive, Tim Lamb, as \"pathetic\". Following the remarks, Hodge considered legal action. The England and Wales Cricket Board took action, summoning Cork to a hearing where they fined him \u00a31,000 and banned him for three matches.  The three match ban was suspended for a year. With Derbyshire rooted to the bottom of the County Championship Division Two table at the end of the season and coupled with the internal issues at Derbyshire, including incoming Director of Cricket David Houghton's refusal to confirm him as captain for 2004, Cork requested to be released from the remainder of his three-year contract extension agreed only at the beginning of the 2003 season.

The conditions favoured batting first, but had Somerset won the toss they would most likely have chosen to bat second, given their success in chasing throughout the season. Northamptonshire captain Jim Watts opted to field, giving Somerset the benefit of batting first.Marks (1984), pp. 69\u201370. Somerset's opening batsmen began quickly, taking the score to 34 before Peter Denning was caught by the wicket-keeper George Sharp off the bowling of Sarfraz Nawaz. His wicket in the seventh over brought in Viv Richards.Marks (1984), p. 70. Before going out to bat, Richards focussed his mind on the fact that \"it wasn't a day for daring, carefree sixes. It was a day for maturity\". Rose played a patient innings for his 41 runs, before being bowled by Watts, leaving Somerset 95/2. At the other end, Richards was playing what David Foot described as \"a controlled gem\".Foot (1986), p. 198. He remained at the wicket until the final over, scoring 117 runs in a chanceless innings. His boundaries were scored predominantly from straight drives and leg hits, powerfully struck. Ian Botham played aggressively when he came in at number five, scoring 27 runs off 17 deliveries, and Joel Garner played similarly when he batted towards the end of the innings, adding 24 runs to the total. Somerset batted through their full allocation of overs, finishing on 269/8. Of the Northamptonshire bowlers, Watts was the most economical, conceding 34 runs off his 12 overs. Tim Lamb conceded the most, allowing 70 runs to be scored from his 12. The wickets were shared by the bowlers; Watts, Lamb and Griffiths took two each, while Sarfraz Nawaz and Peter Willey claimed one apiece. Towards the end of the innings, Watts broke a bone in his right hand when catching a throw from the outfield, which prevented him from participating further in the match.", "|| Tim Lamb || 12 || 0 || 70 || 2 || 5.83", "| Tim Lamb || b Garner || 4 || 8 || 50.00"]}, {"page": "Nick Lamb (cricketer)", "response": ["He continues to play Minor counties cricket for Hertfordshire, having made to date 27 Minor Counties Championship and 20 MCCA Knockout Trophy appearances.

Somehow, both Griffiths and Lamb stood firm and held on, managing to accumulate the runs required, with Griffiths getting off the mark after twenty-nine balls and hitting the winning run and being carried off shoulder high by the partisan crowd.Woodcock, John (editor); Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, 119th Year (1982), pp. 679-680 Three years later, Griffiths made eleven runs against Kent to level the scores and was run out attempting a bye off the last ball of the day, resulting in the first tie ever at Wantage Road.Woodcock, John (editor); Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, 122nd Year (1985), pp. 498-499"]}, {"page": "Jim Dewes", "response": ["The son of the Test cricketer John Dewes, who played for England between 1948\u201350, Dewes was born in June 1957 at Rugby, Warwickshire.
