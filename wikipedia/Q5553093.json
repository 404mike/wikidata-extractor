By modern-day calculations, Derby County would have been the first ever table toppers because of their superior goal difference which was +3 after the first game.  Albion won 2\u20130 at Stoke in front of 4,500 spectators and would have headed Preston North End, Derby County and Everton by virtue of an infinite goal average as they kept a clean sheet. Goal Average was the number of goals scored divided by the number of goals conceded.  Goal Average was used to separate teams who were tied on points at that time. Preston defeated Burnley 5\u20132, Derby were 6\u20133 winners at Bolton and Everton secured the points in a 2\u20131 victory over Accrington. Aston Villa defender Gershom Cox was thought to have earned the distinction of scoring the first ever league goal with an unfortunate own goal in a 1\u20131 draw with Wolverhampton Wanderers and Fred Dewhurst opening the scoring minutes later at Preston with the first intentional goal. However the post-match reports of relative kick-off times show most games were delayed allowing for crowds to assemble. A goal by England and Bolton winger Kenny Davenport 2 minutes into the match against Derby County  was scored comfortably before any other and is now regarded as the first ever football league goal."]}, {"page": "Jimmy Warner", "response": ["On 8 September 1888, Villa made their first appearance in The Football League on the first day of the inaugural season, 1888\u201389.
