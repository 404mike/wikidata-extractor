The success was built upon the prowess of Ray Crawford, the division's top goalscorer with 39. The following season, Ramsey led his side to become champions of England in their debut season at the top level. The side had been tipped by many contemporary football pundits and journalists for relegation at the start of the season, making the achievement all the more remarkable. Ramsey created a strong side based on a resolute defence and two strikers, Ray Crawford and Ted Phillips who between them scored more than 60 goals. The key to the side was considered to be left-winger, Jimmy Leadbetter whom Ramsey moved into a deep-lying, left of centre midfielder."]}, {"page": "2006\u201307 in English football", "response": ["*18 July 2006 \u2013 Jimmy Leadbetter, 78, former Ipswich Town winger.Jimmy Leadbetter Obituary  The Independent.

Ipswich were in charge early on in the match and saw an early chance from Crawford go wide as he failed to convert Jimmy Leadbetter's cross.  Ipswich's Inside forwards were covering a lot of ground in both attack and defence, and this soon took its toll as Tottenham remained patient and took the lead through Greaves in the 36th minute.  Peter Baker's pass to Bobby Smith was flicked into space for Greaves to run on and shoot past Ipswich's goalkeeper Roy Bailey.  Five minutes later Smith's backheel from a Greaves pass deceived Ipswich defender Andy Nelson, and Smith doubled Tottenham's lead, who went in 2\u20130 at half-time.  The second half saw Tottenham's veteran defensive midfielder Danny Blanchflower move up the pitch and provided space for his forwards, with John White's pass allowing Greaves to slip the ball past Bailey for 3\u20130.  An injury to Ipswich defender Larry Carberry left the East Anglian club even weaker; Greaves beat five players only to slice his shot wide of the target after side-stepping Bailey.  With less than ten minutes remaining, White headed in from a Terry Medwin pass.  Roy Stephenson scored a late consolation goal for Ipswich but Medwin completed Tottenham's scoring, with a shot following a pass from Greaves to end the match 5\u20131.", "|MF ||11|| Jimmy Leadbetter"]}, {"page": "1963\u201364 Ipswich Town F.C. season", "response": ["|Jimmy Leadbetter"]}, {"page": "1961\u201362 Ipswich Town F.C. season", "response": ["September started with a trip to the Hawthorns where Ipswich faced West Bromwich Albion.
