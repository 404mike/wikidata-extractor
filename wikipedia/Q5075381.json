He was later noted as being able to communicate without any troubles. He became a teacher for the deaf and dumb. It is thought that he may have been inspired to study butterflies by Charles Baker who was a teacher of deaf children who published a book British Butterflies (1828) illustrated by his students at the Edgbaston Institution. Platt-Barrett travelled to Italy several times. On December 28, 1908 he narrowly escaped an earthquake in Messina but his daughter-in-law and her child were killed by the collapsing building and specimens and notes from months of collecting were destroyed. He was elected Fellow of the Entomological Society in 1911. He was buried at Birchington next to his wife who had predeceased him."]}]}}
