He helped the club to the Third Division North title in 1953\u201354 and the Fourth Division title in 1958\u201359. In September 1959 he crossed the city to play one season with Stoke City.

For the return a week later a stadium record 17,883 packed into Gresty Road to witness a goalless draw at Crewe. The attendance figures were helped by the management team of the Crewe Works, who allowed their workforce to leave work an hour early in order to make it for the 5:10pm kick-off.
