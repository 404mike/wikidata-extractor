This was based on an idea of an exclusive authenticity limited to the works of those who had fought and died in the war. It excluded other forms of experience in the war, such as mourning, nursing and the home front, which were more likely to be experienced by other demographics such as women. There were over 500 women writing and publishing poetry during World War I. Examples of poems by female poets include Teresa Hooley's A War Film, Jessie Pope's War Girls, and Mary H.J. Henderson's An Incident. In addition to giving women greater access to work, the war also gave women greater artistic freedom and space to express their identities as artists."]}, {"page": "Risley, Derbyshire", "response": ["* Teresa Hooley, poet, was born here in 1888."]}, {"page": "Hooley (surname)", "response": ["* Teresa Hooley (1888\u20131973), English poet"]}, {"page": "1927 in poetry", "response": ["* Teresa Hooley, Songs of All Seasons"]}, {"page": "Basil Terah Hooley", "response": ["#REDIRECT Teresa Hooley"]}, {"page": "Lines (Unthanks album)", "response": ["*\"War Film\" (words: Teresa Hooley / music: Adrian McNally)"]}, {"page": "Teresa M.
