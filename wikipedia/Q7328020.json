It is a pure theatre in the round in which the stage area is surrounded on all sides, and above, by seating. Its unique design conceived by Richard Negri of the Wimbledon School of Art is intended to create a vivid and immediate relationship between actors and audiences. As the floor of the exchange was unable to take the weight of the theatre and its audience, the module is suspended from the four columns carrying the hall's central dome. Only the stage area and ground-level seating rest on the floor.

Seeking more training for theatrical design, Porteous studied at the Wimbledon College of Arts in London before returning to Canada in 1969. As a student in London, he was exposed to the work of European and British designers such as Richard Negri, Tanya Moiseiwitsch, Joseph Svoboda, and Sean Kenny, and Continental trends became an important influence on his work. He began a long collaboration with the director Christopher Newton as head of design at the Vancouver Playhouse Theatre Company in 1972. At the Shaw Festival, Newton and Porteous championed total design, achieving unity by assigning set and costume designs to the same designer. For the Shaw's ambitious production of No\u00ebl Coward's Cavalcade, the North American premiere of the play, Porteous used a hydraulic turntable to transport actors, props and the elaborate set pieces on- and offstage within seconds, and projections to suggest a variety of settings and time periods."]}, {"page": "Negri, Richard", "response": ["#redirectRichard Negri"]}]}}
