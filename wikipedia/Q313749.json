Jon Anderson of Yes raids rock vault, talks \"Topographic Oceans\" 40 years on. Examiner.com. (12 September 2013) Retrieved on 12 May 2016. Yes were joined by engineer and producer Eddy Offord, who had worked with the band since 1970 and mixed their sound on tour. He pushed their manager Brian Lane to record in the country, thinking \"some flowers and trees\" would lessen the tension that the album had created within the group, but Yes were swayed to remain in London and record at Morgan Studios as it housed Britain's first 24-track tape machine, produced by Ampex, which presented greater possibilities in the studio. Despite the advantage, Squire recalled that the machine malfunctioned often. Squire worked in the studio for as long as sixteen-hour days, seven days a week on the album. Yes's studio time amounted to \u00a390,000 in costs.", "Dean, who primarily describes himself as a landscape painter, wished to convey his enthusiasm for landscapes within the album's artwork. He stressed that nothing depicted in the design is made up, and that everything in it exists for real. Painted using watercolour and ink, the front depicts fish circling a waterfall under several constellations of stars. In his 1975 book Views, Dean wrote: \"The final collection of landmarks was more complex than ... intended because it seemed appropriate to the nature of the project that everyone who wanted to contribute should do so. The landscape comprised amongst other things, some famous English rocks taken from Dominy Hamilton's postcard collection. These are, specifically: Brimham Rocks, the last rocks at Land's End, the Logan Rock at Treen and single stones from Avebury and Stonehenge. Jon Anderson wanted the Mayan temple at Chichen Itza with the sun behind it, and Alan White suggested using markings from the plains of Nazca. The result is a somewhat incongruous mixture, but effective nonetheless.\" The original pressing of the sleeve included a slipstream in the background by the fish that was removed from future reissues. Although it was not a part of the original design, Anderson persuaded Dean to incorporate it after it was painted, so Dean drew it on a clear cel and had it photographed with and without the slipstream. Dean thought the idea still did not work and used the original for the album's advertisements and posters.", "The album was finished in the first week of November 1973, and aired on British radio several times before its release in stores. It was set for broadcast on David Jensen's show on Radio Luxembourg on 8 November, but according to Anderson, the radio station somehow received blank tapes, resulting in dead air after the album was introduced.Jon Anderson on Classic Artists: Yes DVD.

The album had been a success for the band, reaching number one in the UK for two weeks, and became the first to be certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry based solely on pre-orders. Despite the group's success, during recording, Wakeman informed the band of his decision to leave at its conclusion following his disagreements and frustration with the direction the band had taken with the album, with its esoteric concept and its double length which he believed caused the material to suffer as a result. Wakeman confirmed his departure in May 1974, and the news was made public on 8 June.", "*Jon Anderson\u00a0\u2013 lead vocals, acoustic guitars, piccolo, percussion"]}]}}
