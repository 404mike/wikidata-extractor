Originally from the West Indies, Morton was known for his distinctive drumming style that included syncopation and polyrhythm in a rock beat. His reggae drumming helped give The Beat their characterful sound.After The Beat disbanded, Morton and Saxa formed The International Beat, who were fronted by vocalist Tony Beet. The International Beat continued through the 1990s. Morton reunited with Ranking Roger and they performed as The Beat in the UK, until Ranking Roger's death, in 2019.Morton died on 8 October 2021, at the age of 71.
