As a composer he wrote a number of lighter orchestral pieces such as Lullaby for Penelope.\nIn 1976, Osborne worked for ATV Music and was responsible for trying to get the company's catalogue airtime on BBC radio programmes. In that role, he met composer Simon May, who had then recently had a pop hit with his song \"Summer of my Life\". Osborne later introduced May to various other TV executives, and he was commissioned to write themes for Skorpion, Cold Warrior, EastEnders, and Howards' Way.\nBecause of his executive role, Osborne was able to secure a writer credit for the themes for EastEnders and Howards' Way, despite, in reality, May being the sole composer. May says that Osborne \"didn't write a single note... I could have possibly have insisted on retaining the copyright of EastEnders for myself, but if I had done so, I would have probably have lost the Howards' Way commission.\"He also wrote the music for the hymn \"Praise the Lord in the Rhythm of Your Music\", featured in the popular children's hymnal Come and Praise.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of film score composers", "response": ["* Leslie Osborne (1905\u20131990)"]}, {"page": "Howards' Way", "response": ["The theme music was composed by Simon May and performed by his orchestra.https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/tracks/n22mqm Executive Leslie Osborne secured a co-writer credit, but in reality did not contribute to the composition. After series one, Don Black was commissioned to write lyrics for the theme; May had suggested the title \"Almost There\", which Black changed to \"Always There\". The song was recorded by Marti Webb, and reached number 13 in the UK singles chart. The upbeat variation of the theme, \"Barracuda\", was used over the show's end credits in 1987\u20131990, and was a \"re-visitation\" of a section of May's song \"Believe\" for his musical Smike."]}, {"page": "1990 in British music", "response": ["*date unknown - Leslie Osborne, composer of TV and radio themes, 85"]}, {"page": "EastEnders theme tune", "response": ["The EastEnders theme tune was composed by Simon May.
