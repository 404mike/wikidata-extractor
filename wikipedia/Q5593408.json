The production is completely without dialogue and, with the exception of Robert Rounseville and Ann Ayars, none of the actors did their own singing. Some of the singers had established careers in Britain at the time. Grahame Clifford, for example, had been a leading comedian with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company for several years, and Monica Sinclair was fast becoming an audience favourite at Covent Garden; she would later become one of the company's most popular artists of the next two decades. The acting (especially by Helpmann) is highly stylised and similar to that of the silent film era."]}, {"page": "Patience (opera)", "response": ["|Bunthorne||Henry Lytton||Henry Lytton||Martyn Green||Grahame Clifford"]}, {"page": "Martyn Green", "response": ["In September 1939, at the outbreak of World War II, the British government ordered all theatres to close indefinitely.
