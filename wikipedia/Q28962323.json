Reviewing the production for The Washington Post, Peter Marks commented, \"nothing [Garfield's] done prepares you for the star-powered dexterity of his Prior\" and considered his performance to be the \"persuasive moral core of the piece.\" He won the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play for his performance."]}, {"page": "Oxfordshire Blue Plaques Board", "response": ["|data-sort-value=\"Cavendish\"|Robin Cavendish"]}, {"page": "Ed Speleers", "response": ["In 2016, he played the role of Slean in ITV's epic fantasy drama television series from, Beowulf: Return to the Shieldlands.

The film stars Andrew Garfield, Claire Foy, Hugh Bonneville, Tom Hollander, Ed Speleers and Dean-Charles Chapman; it tells the story of Robin Cavendish, who became paralysed from the neck down by polio at the age of 28.", "In 1958 in Kenya, Robin Cavendish falls ill from polio at age 28, not long after meeting and marrying his wife Diana. Paralysed from the neck down and unable to breathe without the assistance of a respirator, he is given only three months to live. He is repatriated to Britain. Initially he is depressed, refusing to see his wife or newborn son, Jonathan, and wishing to be removed from life support. However, Diana is persistent and slowly his spirits improve. When Diana realises she can provide for his daily care and suggests they move Robin and the respirator home, Robin brightens considerably. Over the strenuous objections of the hospital's administrator Dr. Entwistle (who tells Diana that he will die if without the ventilator for two minutes) and with the help of some of the other doctors and nurses, Robin is brought home and meets his son.", "Upon release, the film received generally mixed reviews. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 68% based on 168 reviews and a weighted average of 6.4/10.

The Guardian writer Mark Kermode gave the film four out of five stars praising Andrew Garfield's portrayal of Robin Cavendish stating that \"There's real terror in Garfield's eyes as Robin stares into the abyss, spitting in the face of a hospital chaplain who announces that his suffering is somehow part of God's great plan\". He also gave praise to the film's score and the role of Diana Cavendish's twin brothers, portrayed in a dual role by Tom Hollander. Peter Bradshaw, another writer for the The Guardian added to this stating that the film \"highlights a vital chapter of history\" for disabled people but fails to shed \"light and shade in the Cavendish'es themselves\"."]}, {"page": "Patient Innovation", "response": ["*Category \u201cPatient Innovation Lifetime Achievement Award\u201d: Robin Cavendish (1930 - 1994) and Diana Cavendish, for developing a variety of innovations for polio patients (including a wheelchair with an attached ventilator) and for tirelessly advocating for people with disabilities."]}, {"page": "List of British films of 2017", "response": ["|| STXinternational  Based on the life of Robin Cavendish"]}, {"page": "Responaut magazine", "response": ["There are also articles from noted people of the era, including Stirling Moss, Canon W R Birt, Robin Cavendish, Raymond Baxter, Lord Snowdon, Lord Willis, Alfred Morris (MP), Lord Aberdare and many more."]}, {"page": "List of films based on actual events (2000\u2013present)", "response": ["* Breathe (2017) \u2013 biographical drama film that tells the story about Robin Cavendish, who became paralysed from the neck down by polio at age 28"]}]}}
