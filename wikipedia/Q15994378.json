Later they separated and she started working as a governess in Russia in 1907.", ":Cox's interest lay in the discovery of applications of Grassmann's Ausdehnungslehre and he uses the chain to that end. Any present-day geometer (to whom many of Cox's properties of circles in a plane must appear not a little artificial) would agree that his figure of points and planes in space is simpler and more fundamental than that of circles in a plane which he derives from it. Yet this figure of 2n circles shows beyond a doubt the superiority of Cox's chain over Clifford's; for the latter is included as a special case when half the circles in the former shrink into points. Cox's plane figure of 2n circles can be derived by elementary methods.Herbert W.
