Under the guidance of their mentor and manager Simon Fuller, they advertised for an unprecedented number of brands and became the most merchandised group in music history.

As a result, said biographer David Sinclair, \"So great was the daily bombardment of Spice images and Spice product that it quickly became oppressive even to people who were well disposed towards the group.\" This was parodied in the video for their song \"Spice Up Your Life\", which depicts a futuristic dystopian city covered in billboards and adverts featuring the group.

Instead, two producers from 19 Management approached her and asked her to go into the studio to record a demo tape for Fuller.

The group's entry on the Popjustice website states that at one point they were nearly called \"Sugar Club\" instead of the name that stuck. Another theory is that the group is so-named because  \"S\" is the first letter of the word \"seven\". McIntosh, in a December 2012 interview, said a lot of Simon Fuller's success has been based on the number 19 (owning 19 Entertainment); therefore, as \"S\" is the 19th letter of the alphabet, the \"S\" was put into S Club 7.", "In April 2003, S Club released their first feature film, Seeing Double, directed by music-video director Nigel Dick, which was to be the last time the group would be seen on-screen together.

Cowell's prominence grew, fed by his signature phrase, \"I don't mean to be rude, but ...\", inevitably followed by an unsparingly blunt appraisal of the contestant's talents, personality, or even physical appearance. A lot of these one-liners were the product of coaching that Cowell received from publicist Max Clifford.
