Regarded by his sympathisers as a 'race martyr', he briefly became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre for the tabloid press in the 1970s.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "British Movement", "response": ["McLaughlin, in contrast to Jordan, was under no delusions that the BM might gain a broad following and instead he felt that its best area of possible support was amongst young, working-class males. The BM journals, The Phoenix and British Patriot, thus changed to become much more simplistic and aggressive publications largely shorn of Jordan's pseudoscientific racialism in favour of more basic notions.R. Hill & A. Bell, The Other Face of Terror, p. 121 The BM had also gained some publicity in 1976 when \"race martyr\" and sometime party activist Robert Relf went on hunger strike in protest at the Race Relations Bill but this proved short-lived as Tyndall quickly signed Relf up to the NF.Walker, The National Front, p. 195 Relf had gained national attention after he advertised his house as being \"For Sale - to a white family only\". Meanwhile, McLaughlin's baser ideas struck a chord with the growing White power skinhead movement and large numbers of these youths, many of whom were involved in regular acts of violence against non-Whites, flocked to the BM.R. Hill & A. Bell, The Other Face of Terror, pp. 121-122 By 1980 it claimed to have 4,000 members and 25 branches.", "After he opened contact with Jordan, Hill was expelled from the BM by McLaughlin in 1981. Hill was backed by his Leicester branch, London organiser Tony Malski and Robert Relf and his lieutenant Mike Cole, all of whom backed Hill to replace McLaughlin as leader.Hill & Bell, The Other Face of Terror, pp. 139-141 Hill released a statement to BM members rejecting the expulsion and threatening a court injunction to overturn the expulsion.Hill & Bell, The Other Face of Terror, pp. 145-146 With legal advice provided by British Democratic Party leader Anthony Reed Herbert, Hill soon issued the writ against McLaughlin, who attempted to get around the problems by renaming the BM the British Nationalist and Socialist Movement and claiming that the BM in fact no longer existed.Hill & Bell, The Other Face of Terror, p. 146"]}]}}
