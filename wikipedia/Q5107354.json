Stevenage opened the scoring midway through the first-half, Byron Harrison, starting only his second game for the club, heading in Lawrie Wilson's deep cross. Gillingham equalised in first-half injury time, Cody McDonald scoring from close range. The visitors took the lead just after the interval, Adebayo Akinfenwa, who also scored for Gillingham in the reverse fixture, scored from six yards out following good work by Joe Martin. Stevenage manager Graham Westley made two second-half changes, bringing on Ben May and Peter Winn, the latter supplying the cross for Harrison to score his second with fifteen minutes remaining to restore parity. Another 2\u20132 draw followed three days later, this time against Accrington Stanley. Stevenage had a two-goal lead courtesy of strikes from Byron Harrison and Lawrie Wilson, but two late Accrington goals meant that the points were shared. Three days after the draw with Accrington, Stevenage travelled to Gigg Lane for their first ever game against Bury. The game ended 3\u20130 to Bury, courtesy of goals from Andy Bishop, ex-Stevenage defender Efe Sodje, and Ryan Lowe. Stevenage fell to their fifth consecutive away defeat just four days later, losing 1\u20130 at Shrewsbury Town courtesy of a first-half Nicky Wroe strike. The club made it five league games without victory on 15 February, drawing 0\u20130 at home to Oxford United. Four days after the stalemate with Oxford, Stevenage secured their first away win in four months, winning 1\u20130 at Crewe Alexandra courtesy of an 87th-minute goal from Byron Harrison \u2013 Stevenage's first away goal in the league since 2 November 2010. This was followed up with another away win three days later, this time securing three points against Port Vale at Vale Park, winning the match 3\u20131. Stevenage took the lead fifteen minutes before the interval when Anthony Griffith's 30-yard backpass took a bobble and rolled over Port Vale goalkeeper Chris Martin's foot. The visitors doubled their lead seven minutes later when Peter Winn scored a low drilled effort. Port Vale got a goal back through Sam Morsy, but David Bridges restored Stevenage's two-goal lead after Byron Harrison's cross had ricocheted off the goalkeeper and fell to the feet of Bridges. Stevenage's last game of February was a home game against Cheltenham Town, with Stevenage securing their third consecutive league victory, winning the game 4\u20130. Goals from Mark Roberts and Byron Harrison had given Stevenage a two-goal lead going into half-time. Michael Bostwick added a third in the 52nd minute, lashing the ball across goal from just inside the area after a tidy interchange with Byron Harrison. Two minutes later, Harrison then added his second of the game, and Stevenage's fourth, when he headed in Lawrie Wilson's right wing cross."]}, {"page": "Christopher Joseph Martin", "response": ["#REDIRECT Chris Martin (footballer, born 1990)"]}, {"page": "2006\u201307 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|GK||26||align=\"left\"| Chris Martin", "| March 2007 || GK ||  || Chris Martin || Kidsgrove Athletic || End of season || "]}, {"page": "2007\u201308 Port Vale F.C. season", "response": ["In January, goalkeeper Mark Goodlad was forced to retire due to injury, and young Joe Anyon faced criticism from the fans for his performances.
