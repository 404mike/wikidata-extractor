A previous owner, Randy Lerner, expressed his support for increasing the capacity as average attendances increased. If projected expansions were completed, the capacity of Villa Park would increase to around 50,000. At the start of the 2010 season, designs were at a conceptual stage, and due to a \"multi-year effort to consider business and supporter needs\" there was no defined date for construction to start. In the meantime, the entrance to the North Stand, \"R Block\", was redecorated internally and externally. The facelift has seen the curved fascia above the turnstiles replaced with cladding and canopies similar to those in front of the Holte Suite. The \"R Block\" concourse has been expanded to create a larger, brighter open space. In September 2017 Aston Villa chief executive officer Keith Wyness revealed plans to expand Villa Park, announcing that the club was studying several plans to increase the capacity up to 60,000. , the ground's capacity was still under 43,000 with the time scale of expansion plans forecasted to take \"two to ten years\"."]}, {"page": "Bill Kenwright", "response": ["In February 2005, Keith Wyness stated that the club had begun to look for other potential investors.

Paul Gregg stated that he had been \"led down the garden path and that the whole exercise has embarrassed the club.\" Samuelson re-iterated that funds were ready; \"The fund is approved and ready to go. I have not received the actual certificate of incorporation of the fund but that is a technicality.\" He stated that an EGM was necessary to confirm the FSF fund. \"As far as I'm concerned it's a fait accompli \u2013 subject to the approval of an EGM of shareholders.\" An EGM was never called and the question of investment into Everton from the FSF fell away from the public eye.", "In 2007, Kenwright announced that he would like to move the club to Kirkby as part of a proposal known as Destination Kirkby which included a Tesco supermarket and a retail park. The pursuit of this project led to minor shareholders of the club calling for an Extraordinary General Meeting in 2008.

However he dismissed it as he did not believe it would have the potential for a 75,000 capacity stadium. Sir Anwar Pervez and his company Bestway devised an alternative stadium scheme with Liverpool City Council. It would have seen Everton move to just outside Liverpool city centre. Bestway property director Malcolm Carter said: \"We have recently been presented with an opportunity which, for the city, would combine the massive desirability of allowing Everton FC to remain within the city of Liverpool and come home to Everton, while acting as a catalyst for the regeneration of the wider area. This would involve developing a new stadium and associated commercial enterprises both within our existing location and on neighbouring sites. Bestway already has a design team in place and are in discussion with a stadium contractor about working up proposals which, from an initial assessment, are very feasible. We know that a football stadium will fit into our site and could work in this location.
