Using this, Kane and Neame introduced the \"death squad\" plot. Kane and Neame were influenced by the films Three Days of the Condor, The Parallax View and The Conversation; those films dealt with the paranoia of America brought on by the Vietnam War in the same way Midnight Man dealt with paranoia in Britain following the War in Iraq and the War on Terror.Wood, David (25 April 2008). \"Shot in the dark\".
