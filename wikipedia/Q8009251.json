This is a valuable contribution to the history of India in the early 17th century."]}, {"page": "Chronology of Shakespeare's plays", "response": [":First recorded performance: the entry in the Stationers' Register in July 1602 states that the play was \"latelie Acted by the Lo: Chamberleyne his servantes.\" The title page of Q1 states that it had been performed in London, at Cambridge and Oxford universities, \"and else-where.\" However, there is no record of any of these performances. The first definite performance of the play took place on a ship called the Red Dragon, anchored off the coast of Africa, on 5 September 1607. The evidence for this comes from Thomas Rundall's Narratives of Voyages Towards the North-East: 1496\u20131631 (1849). Rundall includes extracts from the journal of Captain William Keeling, who was in charge of three ships sponsored by the East India Company that left England for India in March 1607, but were almost immediately separated. The Red Dragon, Keeling's flagship, was beset by storms and anchored off what is now Sierra Leone for six weeks. According to Keeling, the crew performed Hamlet on the nights of 5 September and \"31 September\" (presumably 1 October), and Richard II on the night of 30 September. There has been some argument as to the authenticity of Keeling's journal entry. Prior to Rundall's book, Keeling's journal had been published in 1625, but the references to Hamlet and Richard II were not included by the editor, Samuel Purchas. In his 1898 book, Life of Shakespeare, Sidney Lee claimed the entire Red Dragon episode was probably a forgery by John Payne Collier, and in 1950, Sydney Race revealed that the relevant pages were missing from the original journal and argued that a ship's crew would be incapable of mastering two of Shakespeare's most difficult plays. However, William Foster pointed out that the entire journal had been missing since at least 1900, not just the relevant pages, and he countered Race by arguing that the crew probably performed truncated and edited versions of each play. The general feeling amongst scholars today is that the record is genuine. The earliest recorded performance of the play in England took place at court over Christmas 1619."]}, {"page": "William Foster", "response": ["William Foster may refer to:", "*William Foster (GC) (1881\u20131942), British Home Guard officer, awarded the George Cross, 1942", "*William Foster (Medal of Honor) (1832\u20131880), American soldier and Medal of Honor recipient", "*William Foster (New South Wales politician, born 1865) (1865\u20131936), member of NSW Legislative Assembly (1925-1936)", "*William Foster (New South Wales politician, born 1794)  (1793/4-1866), member of the NSW Legislative Council (1843-1845)", "*William Foster (New York state senator) (1813\u20131893), New York politician", "*William Foster (British politician) (1887\u20131947), British Labour Party MP for Wigan, 1942\u20131947", "*William Foster (bishop) (1744\u20131797), Irish bishop", "*William Foster (divine) (born 1591), English divine", "*William Foster (cricketer) (1859\u20131944), English cricketer", "*William Foster (Scottish cricketer) (born 1934), Scottish cricketer", "*William Foster (swimmer) (1890\u20131963), British Olympic freestyle swimmer", "*William Foster (historiographer) (1863\u20131951), British historiographer and Superintendent of Records at the India office", "*William Foster (Iowa architect) (1842\u20131909), architect in Iowa, United States", "*William Foster (British architect) (1876\u20131940), British architect", "* William Foster, captain of the Clotilda and last person to have imported slaves from Africa to the United States", "*William Foster & Co.

He was succeeded by Sir David Dundas (1871\u201377),Wikisource a lawyer and politician, and then by Sir Henry Yule (1877\u201389), an Oriental scholar and former East India Company soldier. Yule took a more direct interest in the editing of the society's publications than either Murchison or Dundas, and it was his decision that all future volumes should be indexed. R. H. Major, who had taken over as Secretary from Cooley in 1849, held the office until 1858 when his place was taken by the geographer, historian and expedition promoter Clements Markham. Markham served as Secretary 1858\u201387, and as President 1889\u20131909, and personally edited no fewer than 29 volumes. From 1893 he was assisted by William Foster, the East India Company historian and India Office archivist, who served as Secretary until 1902. The first permanent Treasurer, appointed in 1908, was Edward Heawood, the Royal Geographical Society's librarian: he remained in office for thirty-eight years.", "In 1909 Markham was succeeded as President by Sir Albert Gray, an ex-member of the Ceylon Civil Service. From this time onwards the Society began to extend its activity beyond that of publication. It supported the establishment of a memorial to Richard Hakluyt in Bristol Cathedral in 1911, and in 1914 Gray represented the Society on the British Academy Committee involved in organising the Shakespeare Tercentenary. The period also saw the emergence of women as editors and translators, notably Bertha Phillpotts, Lavinia Mary Anstey and Zelia Nuttall. Membership increased, largely on account of institutional subscriptions which by 1911 accounted for half of the 440 members. Sir William Foster, the former Secretary, served as President 1928\u20131945, and then as Vice-president until his death in 1951. Foster's skill in annotating rubbed off on his editors and resulted in a period distinguished by considerable improvements in the quality of the Society's publications, together with a steady growth in membership to more than 2000. Foster was succeeded in 1945 by Edward Lynam, Superintendent of the Map Room at the British Museum (now the British Library) and the first of a line of post-war presidents whose terms of office were restricted to a period of five years. In the post-war period the Society's publication programme benefited from the labours of those of its voluntary officers who also took on editorial responsibilities, including R. A.
