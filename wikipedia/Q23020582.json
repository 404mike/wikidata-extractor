The review concluded that Ferrada de Noli and his co-workers \"demonstrated that among refugees with PTSD, major depression was not substantially associated with heightened levels of suicidal behaviour\". Meaning that the path to severe suicide attempts in PTSD victims was not mediated by depression - as it was thought before - but linked directly to PTSD. The discovery indicated modifications in prevention and treatment of suicidal behaviour.Panagioti M, Gooding P, Tarrier N (2009). \"Post-traumatic stress disorder and suicidal behavior: A narrative review\". Clinical Psychology Review. 29 (6): 471\u201382. doi:10.1016/j.cpr.2009.05.001. . Another finding was significant correlations between specific methods in suicidal behavior and methods used in torture inflicted to prisoners later diagnosed with PTSD. In the book Suicide and the Holocaust, David Lester referred to that finding, and summarized: \"for example those subjected to water torture thought of using drowning\".David Lester (2005) Suicide and the Holocaust.
