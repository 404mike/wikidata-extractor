Zeuner proposed a detailed scheme of correlation and dating of European climatic and prehistoric cultural events on the basis of Milankovitch cycles.Zeuner was born in Berlin, Germany, and received his Ph.D. from the University of Breslau in 1927.  After working as a Privatdozent at the University of Breslau from 1927-1930 and a lecturer in geology at the University of Freiburg from 1931-34 he emigrated to England where he worked as a research associate at the British Museum (Natural History) from 1934-36.  Zeuner was lecturer in geochronology at the University of London's  Institute of Archaeology from 1936 to 1945 and received his D. Sc. from the university in 1942.  From 1946 to 1963 he was professor and head of environmental archaeology at the University of London's Institute of Archaeology, where postgraduate students included Andr\u00e9e Rosenfeld.  He was a member of the Geologische Vereinigung in Germany and was admitted to the German Academy of Natural Scientists Leopoldina (1952).  He was also a member of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "UCL Institute of Archaeology", "response": ["The Institute of Archaeology had its origins in Mortimer Wheeler's vision of a centre for archaeological training in the United Kingdom, which he conceived in the 1920s. Thanks to the efforts of Wheeler and his wife Tessa, his ambitions were realised when the institute was officially opened in 1937, with Mortimer Wheeler as its first director. Among its early members of staff were some of the founding ancestors of archaeology in Britain. Foremost among these, apart from Wheeler himself, was V. Gordon Childe, director from 1946 to 1957, but there were many others, including Kathleen Kenyon, excavator of Jericho, initially secretary then the institute's acting director during World War II; F. E. Zeuner, one of the founders of quaternary studies and of zooarchaeology; Joan du Plat Taylor, the institute's librarian for many years, who was a pioneer of underwater archaeology; and Max Mallowan, Professor of Western Asiatic Archaeology (and second husband of Agatha Christie)."]}, {"page": "T. C. Lethbridge", "response": ["Lethbridge's next project focused on searching for a chalk hill figure that was reported to have once existed on Wandlebury Hill in the Gog Magog Hills, Cambridgeshire. Towards the end of 1954 he began investigating the site, inserting metal rods into the ground to determine where he believed the turf had once been removed to expose the chalk below. He believed that he had revealed three large figures, a warrior, a hooded goddess, and a sun god, asserting them to be likely 3000 years old, and then began excavation to remove the turf and reveal the figures. Lethbridge sought much publicity for his discovery, reporting on it to The Times and being interviewed by the London Evening News. However, many archaeologists were sceptical of Lethbridge's methodology and the existence of the hill figures; they believed that the soft patches of chalk were the result of chalk solifluction and were only interpreted as human-made figures through Lethbridge's vivid imagination. The Council for British Archaeology brought together a committee to assess Lethbridge's findings, composed of I. W. Cornwall, W. F. Grimes, Christopher Hawkes, and Stuart Piggott. With the aid of geologist F. E. Zeuner, the committee concluded that the shapes Lethbridge had discovered were natural, having been formed during the last Ice Age. However, Hawkes disagreed with his colleagues, and believed that while not proven, Lethbridge's conclusions could not be disproved. Lethbridge stuck by his original ideas, and wrote a book aimed at a general audience, Gogmagog \u2013 The Buried Gods on the basis of them. It was published by Routledge and Kegan Paul in 1957, but received no supportive reviews."]}, {"page": "Robert Eisenman", "response": ["With his attempts to get free access to the Scrolls, Eisenman claims he was the first to call for AMS Carbon dating the Dead Sea ScrollsCf.

Libby had first started using the dating method in 1946 and early testing required relatively large samples that were destroyed, so testing on scrolls only became feasible when methods used in the dating process were improved upon.Doudna, G. \"Carbon-14 Dating\", in Encyclopedia of the Dead Sea Scrolls, Schiffman, Lawrence & VanderKam, James, eds., Vol.1 (Oxford: 2000) F. E. Zeuner carried out tests on date palm wood from the Qumran site yielding a date range of 70\u00a0BCE \u2013 90\u00a0CE.
