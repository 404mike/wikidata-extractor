She learned to play tennis at the Ealing Lawn Tennis Club where she was first coached by H. Lawrence and later by Charles Martin and Harold Mahony. She won her first senior singles title in 1893 at Ilkley. Between 1893 and 1917 she participated in 21 Wimbledon tournaments. At her first appearance she reached the semifinals of the singles event in which she lost to Blanche Bingley Hillyard. She won her first singles title in 1895, defeating Helen Jackson in the final of the All-Comers event. In that match she was down 0\u20135 in both sets but managed to win in straight sets. In 1896, she successfully defended her title in the Challenge Round against Alice Simpson Pickering. Between 1897 and 1901 the titles were divided between Cooper Sterry (1898, 1901) and Bingley Hillyard (1897, 1899, 1900). The 1902 Challenge Round match against Muriel Robb was halted on the first day of play due to rainfall at 6\u20134, 11\u201313. The match was replayed in its entirety the next day and Robb won 7\u20135, 6\u20131, playing a total of 53 games which was then a record for the longest women's singles final. In 1908 as a mother of two she won her last singles title when she defeated Agnes Morton in straight sets in the All-Comers final after a seven-year hiatus and at the age of 37. She is the oldest Wimbledon's ladies\u2019 singles champion and her record of eight consecutive singles finals stood until 1990 when Martina Navratilova reached her ninth consecutive singles final.", "| style=\"background:#98fb98;\"|Win ||1895 || Wimbledon (1) || Grass ||  Helen Jackson Atkins || 7\u20135, 8\u20136"]}, {"page": "1895 Wimbledon Championships", "response": [" Charlotte Cooper defeated  Helen Jackson 7\u20135, 8\u20136 "]}, {"page": "Bristol Open", "response": ["|1895 ||   Helen Jackson ||  Madeline Fisher O'Neill || 6\u20131, 6\u20131"]}, {"page": "List of British singles finalists at Grand Slam tennis tournaments", "response": ["| Helen Jackson || 1895 || || ||"]}, {"page": "List of Grand Slam singles finals", "response": ["| 1895||Wimbledon Championships||Charlotte Cooper|| Helen Jackson||7\u20135, 8\u20136"]}, {"page": "1895 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Women's singles", "response": ["Charlotte Cooper defeated Helen Jackson 7\u20135, 8\u20136 in the All Comers' Final to win the Ladies' Singles tennis title at the 1895 Wimbledon Championships.
