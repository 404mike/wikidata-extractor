Marcus Haber scored his third goal of the season when he reacted quickest after his initial header had rebounded off the post, giving Stevenage the lead after twenty minutes. The away side doubled their advantage on the hour mark. Hartlepool's Jordan Richards was adjudged to have handled the ball in the area, and Lucas Akins scored the resultant spot-kick. A 2\u20131 home loss to Crawley Town followed a week later, on 15 December. The match was the first home game for Stevenage since Mitchell Cole's passing, and the occasion was marked with numerous tributes to the former Stevenage player. The home side looked on course to take the three points when Robin Shroot neatly tucked the ball home from close range following David Gray's centre. However, Crawley netted twice within the space of four second-half minutes to secure their first league win in seven games. The club's game against Brentford, scheduled to be played at Griffin Park on 22 December, was postponed due to a waterlogged pitch. Stevenage returned to action on Boxing Day following an eleven-day break, losing 3\u20131 at home to in-form Coventry City. A first-half Lucas Akins penalty had given the hosts the lead, only for Coventry to score three times in the final ten minutes to secure all three points. Stevenage's last scheduled game of 2012, a home game against Notts County on 29 December, was postponed due to a waterlogged pitch. The club had held a 9am pitch inspection on the day of the game, and deemed the surface unplayable due to heavy rainfall during the days leading up to the match."]}, {"page": "Brad Halliday", "response": ["Halliday joined League Two club Hartlepool United on a one-month loan on 10 September 2015, as cover for the injured Jordan Richards and Michael Duckworth and the suspended Carl Magnay.
