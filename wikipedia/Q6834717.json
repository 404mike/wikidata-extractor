Between 938 and 941, that is roughly between the Battle of Brunanburh (937) and the recovery of the Five Boroughs (942), the archbishop did not attest any royal charters, but he began to do so during or after the negotiations of 942.The following is based on 'Wulfstan 14, fl. 931\u2013956', Prosopography of Anglo-Saxon England. Accessed: 6 February 2009. What the charters reveal for Eric's first reign is less clear-cut, but intermittent absence may explain gaps in the record for Wulfstan's attestations in the turbulent years 947\u2013948.AD 946 (Eadred's reign): S 519\u201320. In 947, Wulfstan attests six or seven charters (S 522a, 523, 525\u201326, 528, 542 and the spurious S 521), but he is absent from another four (S 522, 524, 527, 530); in AD 948, it is eight charters (S 531\u201332, 535, 542, 547 and the spurious S 536\u201337, 540) against three (S 533\u201334 and the spurious 538). One may compare Wulfstan's attendance (S 544, 546, 548\u2013550, 552) and non-attendance (S 545, 547, 551) in AD 949. Unfortunately, the critical period between 950 and 954 has produced comparatively few charters (owing perhaps to Eadred's deteriorating health), but what little there is may be instructive. Wulfstan is still seen at court in 950, but of the five charters which were issued in 951, not one was attested by him,S 554\u2013548 (AD 951). which once again may imply his backing of Amla\u00edb. Eric's reign (952\u2013954) is more obscure. We do know, however, that in 952, the same year that Eric began his second term at York, Wulfstan was arrested and stood on trial in Iudanbyrig (unknown)On the authority of Simeon of Durham, Michael Swanton (in his translation, n. 10) identifies Iudanbyrig with Jedburgh, \"a manor of the bishops of Lindisfarne\", now in Roxburghshire, in the south-east of Scotland.

These claimants included the King of Norway, Harald Hardrada. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle Manuscript D (p.\u00a0197), the Norwegians assembled a fleet of 300 ships to invade England. The authors, however, did not seem to differentiate between warships and supply ships. In King Harald's Saga, Snorri Sturluson states, \"it is said that King Harald had over two hundred ships, apart from supply ships and smaller craft\". Combined with reinforcements picked up in Orkney, the Norwegian army most likely numbered between 7,000 and 9,000 men.

W. Wade-Evans, Vitae sanctorum Britanniae et genealogiae (1944). He also massacred the monks of Bangor-Is-Coed who were assembled to aid the Britons by their prayers. Bede says that he decided to attack them because, although they were not armed, they were opposing him through their prayers. The number of dead monks was said to be about 1200, with only fifty escaping.Bede, H.E., Book II, Chapter 2. The ASC (E) gives the number of dead monks as only 200, but agrees that fifty escaped. It has been suggested that \u00c6thelfrith may have done this for tactical reasons, to catch the Britons by surprise and force them to change their plans in order to protect the monks. After first killing the monks, \u00c6thelfrith prevailed over the enemy army, although Bede notes that \u00c6thelfrith's own forces suffered considerable loss.Bede, H.E., II, 2. \u00c6thelfrith's victory at Chester has been seen as having great strategic importance, as it may have resulted in the separation of the Britons between those in Wales and those to the north; however, Stenton noted that Bede was mainly concerned with the massacre of the monks and does not indicate that he regarded the battle as a historical \"turning-point\".Stenton, page 78. John T. Koch says that the older view that the battle cut the two British areas off from each other is now \"generally understood\" to be outdated, as \u00c6thelfrith died soon after, and there is \"almost no archaeological evidence for Anglo-Saxon settlement within the pagan period in Cheshire or Lancashire\", and in any case the sea would have been the primary means of communication.Koch, John T., Celtic culture: a historical encyclopedia, p. 318, ABC-CLIO, 2006, , "]}, {"page": "Peada of Mercia", "response": [":In his time they came together, [Peada] and Oswy, brother of King Oswald, and declared that they wished to establish a minster in praise of Christ and in honor of St Peter.
