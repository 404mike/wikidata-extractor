He later became cricket coach at Somerset and played three times for the first team in an injury crisis in 1960. He was born at Paddington, London and died in Bristol.\nLambert was a right-handed lower-order batsman and a right-arm fast-medium bowler who was, in his prime, sometimes genuinely fast. Played by Gloucestershire primarily as the new-ball bowler in an attack dominated throughout his career by spin bowling, he often made useful runs and, in a side which frequently had a very long tail, often batted higher up the batting order than he might have done had he played for other teams.", "link_mentions": {}}}
