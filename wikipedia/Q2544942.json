He later became cricket coach at Somerset and played three times for the first team in an injury crisis in 1960. He was born at Paddington, London and died in Bristol.\nLambert was a right-handed lower-order batsman and a right-arm fast-medium bowler who was, in his prime, sometimes genuinely fast. Played by Gloucestershire primarily as the new-ball bowler in an attack dominated throughout his career by spin bowling, he often made useful runs and, in a side which frequently had a very long tail, often batted higher up the batting order than he might have done had he played for other teams.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "George Lambert", "response": ["George Lambert may refer to:", "*George Lambert, 1st Viscount Lambert (1866\u20131958), British MP and peer", "*George Lambert, 2nd Viscount Lambert (1909\u20131989), his son, also a British MP and peer ", "*George Lambert (Australian politician) (1879\u20131941), Australian politician in Western Australia", "*George Lambert (American politician) (born 1968), American politician in New Hampshire", "*George Lambert (tennis) (1842\u20131915), British real tennis world champion", "*George Lambert (footballer) (born 1889), Australian footballer, played for Fitzroy Football Club", "*George Lambert (cricketer) (1919\u20131991), English cricketer", "*George Lambert (pentathlete) (1928\u20132012), American Olympic modern pentathlete", "*George Lambert (English painter) (1700\u20131765), English landscape painter", "*George Lambert (Royal Navy officer) (1796\u20131869), British admiral", "*George Lambert (VC) (1819\u20131860), Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross", "*George Lambert (baritone) (1900\u20131971), English baritone mainly active in Canada"]}, {"page": "1947 English cricket season", "response": ["Gloucestershire's strong challenge for the title was despite the loss of Wally Hammond but in Tom Goddard they had the best bowler in the country. He took 238 wickets in all matches, 61 more than his nearest rival. He was well supported by Sam Cook who took 120 championship wickets and gained a Test call, but the team lacked quality pace bowlers with George Lambert largely on his own apart from the medium pace of Test batsman Charlie Barnett. Five Gloucestershire batsmen scored over 1,000 runs in the championship: captain Basil Allen, Barnett, Jack Crapp, George Emmett and wicket-keeper Andy Wilson. Playfair recorded concerns about the pitch at Bristol which was alleged by some to have been prepared especially for Goddard. It is true that Gloucestershire won eight of the nine matches played there but equally true that Goddard took most of his wickets in matches not at Bristol. Ken Graveney made his debut for Gloucestershire in 1947 and his brother Tom was waiting in the wings. Other players included Monty Cranfield, Bev Lyon, Clifford Monks, William Neale, Grahame Parker, Colin Scott and Alfred Wilcox.Playfair, pp. 85\u201387."]}, {"page": "List of Somerset County Cricket Club players", "response": ["* George Lambert (1960) 3 matches CA"]}, {"page": "Francis McHugh", "response": ["Initially McHugh was a distinctly fast bowler who came into the Yorkshire team with a major injury to Ron Aspinall who was heading the bowling averages early in 1949.Preston, Hubert (editor); Wisden Cricketers\u2019 Almanack; 87th edition (1950); p. 571 He did modestly and with the presence of Coxon, Trueman and Appleyard, was discarded and did not play even in the Second Eleven in 1950.Preston, Hubert (editor); Wisden Cricketers\u2019 Almanac, 88th Edition (1951); pp. 696-698 McHugh then went to Gloucestershire and upon qualifying he quickly found that his accuracy could only become of county standard when he moderated his pace.
