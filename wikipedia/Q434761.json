In the early nineties, Jimmy Choo met with Tamara Mellon who, as a Vogue fashion assistant, would often ask Jimmy's help in customising shoes. After she quit Vogue, Tamara proposed in 1995 to Mr Choo to develop a luxury, ready-to-wear line of shoes. The company was founded in May 1996 when Tom and Ann Yerdye decided to fund their daughter's idea by investing \u00a3150,000 in return for 50% of Jimmy Choo Limited and the right to use the name Jimmy Choo.

Following this opening, Tamara Mellon, Sandra Choi and Marilyn Heston's Get Good Ink PR agency continued to work on the celebrities angle by making a large showing at the Academy Awards in March 1999: they dyed the Jimmy Choos they were loaning to actresses for the Oscars night in colours that matched their dresses.

[...] I leave the ready-to-wear to my partner and team.\" A pair of couture shoes would take two weeks to manufacture with the assistance of eight people. In 1998, Jimmy Choo moved his couture workshop from Hackney to 18 Connaught Street. Tom offered to buy Jimmy Choo out but Jimmy refused to sell.

The terrorist attacks suspended the transaction. A couple of weeks later, David Burns enquired about Jimmy Choo's sales in the US and was surprised to read they were up by 30% to 40% year over year, which he compared to the tumbling share prices of the companies of the fashion industry.
