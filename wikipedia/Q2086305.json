Steiger played a small role of a destroyer commander among the large ensemble cast of The Longest Day, which included John Wayne, Richard Todd, Robert Mitchum, Richard Burton, Sean Connery and Henry Fonda. According to co-star Richard Burton, Steiger had privately admitted to him that he was in financial trouble at the time and had a face lift, which Burton thought made him look like \"one half of a naked ass-hole\". The following year, Steiger played ruthless Neapolitan land developer and city councilman Edoardo Nottola, who uses his political power to make personal profit in a large scale suburban real estate deal, in Francesco Rosi's Italian production, Hands over the City (1963). According to biographer Francesco Bolzoni, Rosi had cast Steiger in the Italian language film because he had wanted \"a rich interpreter of great capacity\" in the part of the land developer."]}, {"page": "1990 in film", "response": ["| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 14 || Philip Leacock || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 74 || style=\"text-align:center;\"| UK || style=\"text-align:center;\"| Director || "]}, {"page": "Gunsmoke", "response": ["* Philip Leacock"]}, {"page": "A.
