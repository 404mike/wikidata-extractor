Hence a firm may have a high or low level of competence in a particular, notional, abstract capability. There is some evidence that general managers often fail to appreciate the subtlety of the definition of \"core competencies\" and over-estimate the degree of their firm's competence in common capabilities. Consequently, they over-identify \"things the firm is good at\" as core competencies \u2013 which falls foul of the distinctiveness criterion for a core capability (and/or the inimitability criterion of core competencies and core capabilities). Hence some things managers mistakenly identify as \"core competencies\" may be more properly considered as Enabling or Supplemental Capabilities."]}, {"page": "2011 in the United Kingdom", "response": ["*7 September \u2013 Max Boisot, architect (b. 1943)"]}, {"page": "Deaths in September 2011", "response": ["*Max Boisot, 67, British academic, cancer."]}, {"page": "I-Space (conceptual framework)", "response": ["The Information Space, or I-Space was developed by Max Boisot as a conceptual framework relating the degree of structure of knowledge (i.e. its level of codification and abstraction) to its diffusibility as that knowledge develops."]}, {"page": "Max Henri Boisot", "response": ["#REDIRECT Max Boisot"]}, {"page": "Boisot", "response": ["*Max Boisot (1943\u20132011), British architect and management consultant"]}]}}
