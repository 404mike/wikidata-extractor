He supported retention of capital punishment in the most extreme cases, and also signed an amendment which would allow Judges to sentence murderers to whipping in addition to any other punishment. In February 1958 he opposed the government's Recreational Charities Bill, arguing that it extended the definition of charitable purposes too widely. He also opposed the Litter Bill introduced by fellow Conservative MP Rupert Speir, saying that it criminalised those who dropped litter but did not realise it. Bell also opposed the Legitimacy Bill in 1959, contending that removing the legal disabilities of illegitimate children would be a risk against the institution of marriage."]}, {"page": "West Downs School", "response": ["*Sir Rupert Speir (politician)"]}, {"page": "List of Conservative Party MPs (UK)", "response": ["*Sir Rupert Speir; MP for Hexham (1951\u20131966)"]}, {"page": "Speir", "response": ["* Rupert Speir (1910-1998), British Conservative Party politician"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom MPs who died in the 1990s", "response": ["|Sir Rupert Speir"]}]}}
