Stoke did most of the attacking again in the second half until Derby got the lead in an unexpected manner. Of course this put new life into Derby and very little seemed to go wrong with them afterwards although Stoke played up strongly. The weakness in their attack was the centre-forward Fred Molyneux. The Derby players were very vigorous and did not spare the Stoke team in bumping them about. Derby scored a third goal to put the contest beyond the brave Stoke players much to the disappointment of the Stoke spectators.\"", "|align=\"left\"|FW||align=\"left\"| Fred Molyneux"]}, {"page": "1899\u20131900 Stoke F.C. season", "response": ["Stoke began the 1899\u20131900 campaign well, beating Liverpool and Preston North End at home and drawing away at Burnley in their first three matches. Tom Wilkes had replaced the outgoing George Clawley in goal and there was a change in attack as local player Sam Higginson was introduced in the place of Fred Molyneux who joined Bristol City while Jack Farrell joined Southampton. Tom Holford also came through the ranks at the Victoria Ground and he went on to become a club legend making over 260 appearances.  There was also change in the boardroom as Mr W Cowlishaw replaced Mr J Fenton."]}]}}
