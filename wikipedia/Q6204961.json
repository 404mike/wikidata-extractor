Work started on writing the script in 1980 and when the first one was shown to Arthur Lowe he was so taken with it he tried to persuade the BBC to make it a television series rather than radio, however the BBC said no. Recording began in 1981 and picked up the story in 1948 and follows the attempts at trying to save the town's pier. Unfortunately Arthur Lowe died in 1982 and many believed that that was the end of it, however at Arthur Lowe's funeral Joan Cooper (Arthur Lowe's wife) found Knowles and Snoad, and told them that her husband liked their scripts so much that he would have wanted the full series to go ahead.
