She sometimes used the name Jane Warton.Although born and raised in the privileged ruling class of British society, Lytton rejected this background to join the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), the most militant group of suffragette activists campaigning for \"Votes for Women\".She was subsequently imprisoned four times, including once in Walton gaol in Liverpool under the nom de guerre of Jane Warton, where she was force fed while on hunger strike. She chose the alias and disguise of Jane Warton, an 'ugly London seamstress', to avoid receiving special treatment and privileges because of her family connections: she was the daughter of a viceroy and the sister of a member of the House of Lords. She wrote pamphlets on women's rights, articles in The Times newspaper, and a book on her experiences, Prisons and Prisoners, which was published in 1914.While imprisoned in Holloway during March 1909, Lytton used a piece of broken enamel from a hairpin to carve the letter \"V\" into the flesh of her breast, placed exactly over the heart. \"V\" for Votes for Women.Lytton remained unmarried, because her mother refused her permission to marry a man from a \"lower social order\", while she refused to contemplate marrying anyone else.\nHer heart attack, stroke, and early death at the age of 54 have been attributed in part to the trauma of her hunger strike and force feeding by the prison authorities.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Hunger strike", "response": ["In the early 20th century suffragettes frequently endured hunger strikes in British prisons. Marion Dunlop was the first in 1909. She was released, as the authorities did not want her to become a martyr. Other suffragettes in prison also undertook hunger strikes. The prison authorities subjected them to force-feeding, which the suffragettes categorized as a form of torture. Emmeline Pankhurst's sister Mary Clarke died shortly after being force-fed in prison, and others including Lady Constance Bulwer-Lytton are believed to have had serious health problems caused by force feeding, dying of a heart attack not long after. William Ball, a working class supporter of women's suffrage, was the subject of a pamphlet Torture in an English Prison not only due to the effects of force-feeding, but a cruel separation from family contact and mental health deterioration, secret transfer to a lunatic asylum and needed lifelong mental institutional care.

For six months the suffrage movement went into a propaganda drive, organising marches and meetings, and local councils passed resolutions supporting the bill. When the new Parliament convened, a cross-party conciliation committee of pro-women's suffrage MPs was formed under the chairmanship of Lord Lytton, the brother of Lady Constance Bulwer-Lytton. They proposed legislation that would have enfranchised female householders and those women that occupied a business premises; the bill was based on existing franchise laws for local government elections, under which some women had been able to vote since 1870. The measure would have added approximately a million women to the franchise; it was kept to a relatively small number to make the bill as acceptable as possible to MPs, mostly Conservatives. Although the WSPU thought the scope of the bill too narrow\u2014it excluded women lodgers and most wives and working-class women\u2014they accepted it as an important step."]}, {"page": "HM Prison Liverpool", "response": ["* Lady Constance Bulwer-Lytton"]}, {"page": "Jane Warton", "response": ["#REDIRECT Lady Constance Bulwer-Lytton"]}, {"page": "Jane Wharton", "response": ["#REDIRECT Lady Constance Bulwer-Lytton"]}, {"page": "Lady Constance Lytton", "response": ["#REDIRECT Lady Constance Bulwer-Lytton"]}, {"page": "Suffragette", "response": ["* Lady Constance Bulwer-Lytton"]}, {"page": "Constance Lytton", "response": ["#REDIRECT Lady Constance Bulwer-Lytton"]}, {"page": "Constance Georgina Bulwer-Lytton", "response": ["#redirect Lady Constance Bulwer-Lytton"]}, {"page": "Edith Bulwer-Lytton, Countess of Lytton", "response": ["Edith Bulwer-Lytton, Countess of Lytton,  (n\u00e9e Villiers; 15 September 1841 \u2013 17 September 1936) was a British aristocrat.
