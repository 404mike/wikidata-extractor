He held academic positions in English literature at both Oxford University (Magdalen College, 1925\u20131954) and Cambridge University (Magdalene College, 1954\u20131963). He is best known for his works of fiction, especially The Screwtape Letters, The Chronicles of Narnia, and The Space Trilogy, and for his non-fiction Christian apologetics, such as Mere Christianity, Miracles, and The Problem of Pain.\nLewis and fellow novelist J. R. R. Tolkien were close friends. They both served on the English faculty at Oxford University and were active in the informal Oxford literary group known as the Inklings. According to Lewis's 1955 memoir Surprised by Joy, he was baptised in the Church of Ireland, but fell away from his faith during adolescence. Lewis returned to Anglicanism at the age of 32, owing to the influence of Tolkien and other friends, and he became an \"ordinary layman of the Church of England\". Lewis's faith profoundly affected his work, and his wartime radio broadcasts on the subject of Christianity brought him wide acclaim.\nLewis wrote more than 30 books which have been translated into more than 30 languages and have sold millions of copies. The books that make up The Chronicles of Narnia have sold the most and have been popularised on stage, TV, radio, and cinema. His philosophical writings are widely cited by Christian apologists from many denominations.\nIn 1956, Lewis married American writer Joy Davidman; she died of cancer four years later at the age of 45. Lewis died on 22 November 1963 from kidney failure, one week before his 65th birthday. In 2013, on the 50th anniversary of his death, Lewis was honoured with a memorial in Poets' Corner in Westminster Abbey.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Aldous Huxley", "response": ["Media coverage of Huxley's death, along with that of fellow British author C.

Lewis argued that \"conscience reveals to us a moral law whose source cannot be found in the natural world, thus pointing to a supernatural Lawgiver.\" Lewis argued that accepting the validity of human reason as a given must include accepting the validity of practical reason, which could not be valid without reference to a higher cosmic moral order which could not exist without a God to create and/or establish it. A related argument is from conscience; John Henry Newman argued that the conscience supports the claim that objective moral truths exist because it drives people to act morally even when it is not in their own interest. Newman argued that, because the conscience suggests the existence of objective moral truths, God must exist to give authority to these truths.", "Because evolutionary naturalism proposes an empirical account of morality, it does not require morality to exist objectively; Linville considers the view that this will lead to moral scepticism or antirealism.Craig & Moreland 2011, pp. 393\u2013394Boniolo & De Anna 2006, pp. 24\u201325 C.

Margaret Atwood said that she saw the book as \"a fantasy book for adults\", and added that the book could be categorized as either young adult fiction or as fantasy, but since it dealt with themes such as \"life and mortality and who are we as human beings\", it could be read and enjoyed by anybody older than twelve.

However, the rape of women, by men, is found in every society, and there are more societies that see at least some versions of it, such as marital rape or punitive rape, as normative than there are societies that see all rape as non-normative (a crime).

He once wrote to Rayner Unwin's daughter Camilla, who wished to know the purpose of life, that it was \"to increase according to our capacity our knowledge of God by all the means we have, and to be moved by it to praise and thanks.\" He had a special devotion to the blessed sacrament, writing to his son Michael that in \"the Blessed Sacrament ... you will find romance, glory, honour, fidelity, and the true way of all your loves upon earth, and more than that\". He accordingly encouraged frequent reception of Holy Communion, again writing to his son Michael that \"the only cure for sagging of fainting faith is Communion.\" He believed the Catholic Church to be true most of all because of the pride of place and the honour in which it holds the Blessed Sacrament. In the last years of his life, Tolkien resisted the liturgical changes implemented after the Second Vatican Council, especially the use of English for the liturgy; he continued to make the responses in Latin, loudly, ignoring the rest of the congregation."]}, {"page": "J. K. Rowling", "response": ["Rowling describes Jane Austen as her \"favourite author of all time\", and acknowledges Homer, Geoffrey Chaucer, and William Shakespeare as literary influences. According to the critic Beatrice Groves, Harry Potter is \"rooted in the Western literary tradition\", including the classics. Scholars agree that Harry Potter is heavily influenced by the juvenile fantasy of writers such as C. S. Lewis, J. R. R. Tolkien, Elizabeth Goudge, Ursula K. Le Guin, Dianna Wynne Jones, and E. Nesbit. As a child, Rowling read Lewis's The Chronicles of Narnia, Goudge's The Little White Horse, Manxmouse by Paul Gallico, and books by E. Nesbit and Noel Streatfeild. She expresses admiration for Lewis, in whose writing battles between good and evil are also prominent.", "The series has been viewed as a Christian moral fable evoking the psychomachia tradition, in which stand-ins for good and evil fight for supremacy over a person's soul. Like C. S. Lewis's The Chronicles of Narnia, it contains Christian symbolism and allegory. Children's literature critic Joy Farmer sees parallels between Harry and Jesus Christ, writing that \"magic is both authors' way of talking about spiritual reality\". There are numerous connections between Harry's story and that of Jesus: Harry is hidden at birth; Professor McGonagall says of him \"every child in our world will know his name\"; Dumbledore tells Harry \"your father ... shows himself most plainly when you have need of him\"; and Dobby says \"Harry Potter shone like a beacon of hope for those of us who thought the Dark days would never end\". Harry carries the protection of his mother's sacrifice in his blood; Voldemort, who wants Harry's blood and the protection it carries, lacks the understanding that love vanquishes evil just as Christ's love for humanity vanquishes death. Voldemort succumbed to temptation, as did Satan, and is beyond redemption. Harry has divine characteristics whereas Voldemort \"has quite literally risen from the dead to become a malevolent figure who seems larger than life\".  Despite the similarities between C. S. Lewis and Rowling's work, the latter received scathing criticism, has been called \"Satanic\", and thought to advocate witchcraft, which Farmer believes to be a profound misreading."]}, {"page": "Justice", "response": ["A meditation on the Divine command theory by Plato can be found in his dialogue, Euthyphro. Called the Euthyphro dilemma, it goes as follows: \"Is what is morally good commanded by God because it is morally good, or is it morally good because it is commanded by God?\" The implication is that if the latter is true, then justice is beyond mortal understanding; if the former is true, then morality exists independently from God, and is therefore subject to the judgment of mortals. A response, popularized in two contexts by Immanuel Kant and C. S. Lewis, is that it is deductively valid to say that the existence of an objective morality implies the existence of God and vice versa."]}, {"page": "Love", "response": ["Greek distinguishes several different senses in which the word \"love\" is used. Ancient Greeks identified four forms of love: kinship or familiarity (in Greek, storge), friendship and/or platonic desire (philia), sexual and/or romantic desire (eros), and self-emptying or divine love (agape).C. S. Lewis, The Four Loves, 1960. Modern authors have distinguished further varieties of romantic love.Stendhal, in his book On Love (\"De l'amour\"; Paris, 1822), distinguished carnal love, passionate love, a kind of uncommitted love that he called \"taste-love\", and love of vanity. Denis de Rougemont in his book Love in the Western World traced the story of passionate love (l'amour-passion) from its courtly to its romantic forms. Benjamin P\u00e9ret, in the introduction to his Anthology of Sublime Love (Paris, 1956), further identified \"sublime love\", a state of realized idealisation perhaps equatable with the romantic form of passionate love. However, with Greek (as with many other languages), it has been historically difficult to separate the meanings of these words totally. At the same time, the Ancient Greek text of the Bible has examples of the verb agapo having the same meaning as phileo.", "Christian theologians see God as the source of love, which is mirrored in humans and their own loving relationships. Influential Christian theologian C. S. Lewis wrote a book called The Four Loves. Benedict XVI named his first encyclical God is love. He said that a human being, created in the image of God, who is love, is able to practice love; to give himself to God and others (agape) and by receiving and experiencing God's love in contemplation (eros). This life of love, according to him, is the life of the saints such as Teresa of Calcutta and the Blessed Virgin Mary and is the direction Christians take when they believe that God loves them."]}, {"page": "Index of philosophy articles (A\u2013C)", "response": ["* C.

Likewise, C. S. Lewis described evil as a \"parasite\" in Mere Christianity, as he viewed evil as something that cannot exist without good to provide it with existence. Lewis went on to argue against dualism from the basis of moral absolutism, and rejected the dualistic notion that God and Satan are opposites, arguing instead that God has no equal, hence no opposite. Lewis rather viewed Satan as the opposite of Michael the archangel. Due to this, Lewis instead argued for a more limited type of dualism.Lewis, C.
