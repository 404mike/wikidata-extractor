He moved to England with his family for refuge from the Prussian advance on Paris in 1870. After peace was restored in 1871 his family returned to Paris but he remained in London, living in the house of an amateur singer, Georgina Weldon, who became the controlling figure in his life. After nearly three years he broke away from her and returned to his family in France. His absence, and the appearance of younger French composers, meant that he was no longer at the forefront of French musical life; although he remained a respected figure he was regarded as old-fashioned during his later years, and operatic success eluded him. He died at his house in Saint-Cloud, near Paris at the age of 75.", "In February 1871, Julius Benedict, the director of the Philharmonic Society, introduced Gounod to a singer and music teacher called Georgina Weldon.Harding, p. 166 She quickly became a dominant influence in Gounod's professional and personal life. There was much inconclusive conjecture about the nature of their relationship. Once peace was restored in France during 1871, Anna Gounod returned home with her mother and children, but Gounod stayed on in London, living in the Weldons' house. Weldon introduced him to competitive business practices with publishers, negotiating substantial royalties, but eventually pushed such matters too far and involved him in litigation brought by his publisher, which the composer lost."]}, {"page": "1871 in music", "response": ["* Autumn \u2013 Charles Gounod begins a stay with soprano Georgina Weldon and her husband in London."]}, {"page": "List of women composers by birth date", "response": ["* Georgina Weldon (1837\u20131914)"]}, {"page": "St Dunstan's Church, Mayfield", "response": ["Georgina Weldon is interred in the Dalrymple family vault."]}, {"page": "Weldon", "response": ["* Georgina Weldon, a British campaigner against the lunacy laws"]}, {"page": "Henry Chorley", "response": ["In spite of his efforts to promote the music of Charles Gounod in England, the composer disliked Chorley intensely.

It greatly amused Gounod's English patron, Georgina Weldon, who described Chorley as having a \"thin, sour, high-pitched sopranish voice\" and moving like a \"stuffed red-haired monkey.\"Harding, pp. 179\u201380 Gounod intended to publish the piece with a dedication to Chorley, but the latter died before this was possible.
