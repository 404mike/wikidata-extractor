An English expatriate and lesbian feminist scholar, she analyses the history and politics of human sexuality.\nJeffreys' argument that the \"sexual revolution\" on men's terms contributed less to women's freedom than to their continued oppression has commanded respect and attracted intense criticism. She argues that women suffering pain in pursuit of beauty is a form of submission to patriarchal sadism, that transsexuals reproduce oppressive gender roles and mutilate their bodies through sex reassignment surgery, and that lesbian culture has been negatively affected by emulating the sexist influence of the gay male subculture of dominant/submissive sexuality.\nShe is the author of several books about feminism and feminist history, including The Spinster and Her Enemies (1985), The Sexuality Debates (1987), Anticlimax (1990), Unpacking Queer Politics (2003), Beauty and Misogyny (2005), and Gender Hurts (2014).", "link_mentions": [{"page": "May 13", "response": ["*1948 \u2013 Sheila Jeffreys, English-Australian political scientist, author, and academic"]}, {"page": "Radical feminism", "response": ["Some radical feminists, such as Andrea Dworkin, Catharine MacKinnon, John Stoltenberg and Monique Wittig, have supported recognition of trans women as women, which they describe as trans-inclusive feminism, while others, such as Mary Daly, Janice Raymond, Robin Morgan, Germaine Greer, Sheila Jeffreys, Julie Bindel, and Robert Jensen, have argued that the transgender movement perpetuates patriarchal gender norms and is incompatible with radical-feminist ideology.", "In The Transsexual Empire: The Making of the She-Male (1979), the lesbian radical feminist Janice Raymond argued that \"transsexuals\u00a0... reduce the female form to artefact, appropriating this body for themselves\". In The Whole Woman (1999), Germaine Greer wrote that largely male governments \"recognise as women men who believe that they are women\u00a0... because [those governments] see women not as another sex but as a non-sex\"; she continued that if uterus-and-ovaries transplants were a mandatory part of sex-change operations, the latter \"would disappear overnight\". Sheila Jeffreys argued in 1997 that \"the vast majority of transsexuals still subscribe to the traditional stereotype of women\" and that by transitioning they are \"constructing a conservative fantasy of what women should be\u00a0... an essence of womanhood which is deeply insulting and restrictive.\" In Gender Hurts (2014), she referred to sex reassignment surgery as \"self-mutilation\", and used pronouns that refer to biological sex. Jeffreys argued that feminists need to know \"the biological sex of those who claim to be women and promote prejudicial versions of what constitutes womanhood\", and that the \"use by men of feminine pronouns conceals the masculine privilege bestowed upon them by virtue of having been placed in and brought up in the male sex caste\"."]}, {"page": "Sexual revolution", "response": ["Nevertheless, among many feminists, the view soon became widely held that, thus far, the sexual freedoms gained in the sexual revolution of the 1960s, such as the decreasing emphasis on monogamy, had been largely gained by men at women's expense.

Stone worked as a sound engineer for Olivia Records from about 1974 to 1978, resigning as the controversy over a trans woman working for a lesbian-identified enterprise increased. The debate continued in Raymond's book, which devoted a chapter to criticism of \"the transsexually constructed lesbian-feminist.\" Groups like Lesbian Organization of Toronto then voted to exclude trans lesbians.

As Roger Chapman documents in Culture Wars: An Encyclopedia of Issues, Viewpoints, and Voices, Volume 1 (2010), she has drawn frequent condemnation from religious organizations, social conservatives and parental watchdog groups for her use of explicit, sexual imagery and lyrics, religious symbolism, and otherwise \"irreverent\" behavior in her live performances. The Times wrote that she had \"started a revolution amongst women in music\u00a0... Her attitudes and opinions on sex, nudity, style and sexuality forced the public to sit up and take notice.\" Professor John Fiske noted that the sense of empowerment that Madonna offers is inextricably connected with the pleasure of exerting some control over the meanings of self, of sexuality, and of one's social relations. In Doing Gender in Media, Art and Culture (2009), the authors noted that Madonna, as a female celebrity, performer, and pop icon, is able to unsettle standing feminist reflections and debates. According to lesbian feminist Sheila Jeffreys, Madonna represents woman's occupancy of what Monique Wittig calls the category of sex, as powerful, and appears to gleefully embrace the performance of the sexual corv\u00e9e allotted to women.

This encouraged the emergence of androgyny in lesbian feminist circles, with many women wearing clothing like T-shirts, jeans, flannels, and boots.

Specifically, Jeffreys argues in \u201cTransgender Activism: A Lesbian Feminist Perspective\u201d that \u201ctranssexualism is a construction of medical sciences\u201d that aims to profit from expensive surgeries and master the alteration and creation of body parts. Janice Raymond, Mary Daly and among others, argue that the feminist movement should not focus its energy on trans women.

However, not all radical feminists have dismissed transgender acceptance.
