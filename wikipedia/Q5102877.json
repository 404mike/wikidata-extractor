Sandra and her husband, Tim Arden (John Flanagan), are also killed in a car accident in 1991, leaving their 15-year-old daughter Vicky (Chloe Newsome) distraught and orphaned. Vicky moves in with her grandfather at The Rovers, before leaving after a disastrous relationship with bad-boy Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson). In March 1988, Bet finds out she is pregnant, leaving her and Alec astounded. Despite the shock, they start to come around to the idea when Bet suffers a miscarriage a week later. Both she and Alec are devastated, but put on brave faces and carried on. In September 1992, Alec is offered a dream job in Southampton. Newton & Ridley agrees to buy back the licence, and Bet and Alec prepare to move. However, Bet finds herself unable to leave The Rovers as it has been her whole world for the past two decades; as a result Alec leaves alone. The brewery agrees to take Bet back on as the manager. In October 1995, the brewery once again wants to sell The Rovers; this time they are selling not just the licence but the entire pub. If Bet wants to keep her home and her job, she needs to buy The Rovers outright. Bet knows she cannot come up with the \u00a367,000 she needs by herself. First she asks her long-time friend Rita Sullivan (Barbara Knox) to lend her the money and become a business partner. Rita has the money, and is about to agree when she talks with Alf Roberts (Bryan Mosley) who makes her thing about why Bet has no savings despite the pub supposedly being such a success. This causes Rita to realise that the Rovers is a bad risk and Bet is not someone she should be going into partnership with. However Bet, having heard from Mavis Wilton (Thelma Barlow) that Rita was going to buy, is furious, leading to a blazing row between the two. Name-calling and dredged-up memories are flung between the two, and the fight ends their friendship permanently. Bet then turns to Vicky, who is by now married to Steve. She is also unwilling to invest, also considering The Rovers to be a bad investment, and her offer to buy a house for Bet to rent infuriates her. Enraged, she throws Vicky out of The Rovers and, realising that she has nobody else to turn to, throws everyone out of the pub in the middle of a busy afternoon session. Sending the staff home, Bet promptly packs her bags and calls herself a taxi.

Bet visits Sandra and talks to her, persuading to give Alec a chance and after thinking, Sandra agrees. In 1991, days after the death of Alec's former wife, Sandra and Tim are killed in a car crash and Vicky (now played by Chloe Newsome) stays with Bet and Alec, who later become her legal guardians.
