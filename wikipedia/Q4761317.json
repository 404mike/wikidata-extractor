During that time, she met a number of budding musicians in Britain's blues scene. Her first foray into the music field did not come until she met two friends, Stan Webb and Andy Silvester, in a pub one night. At the time, they were playing in a band called Sounds Of Blue. Knowing that McVie had musical talent, they asked her to join. She often sang with Spencer Davis. After five years, McVie graduated from art college, but by that time Sounds of Blue had split up. McVie found she did not have enough money to launch herself into the art world, so she moved to London and worked briefly as a department-store window dresser.", "In 1967, McVie learned that her ex-bandmates, Andy Silvester and Stan Webb, were forming a blues band, Chicken Shack, and were looking for a pianist. She wrote to them asking to join. They accepted and invited her to play keyboards/piano and to sing background vocals. Chicken Shack's debut release was \"It's Okay With Me Baby\", written by and featuring McVie. She stayed with Chicken Shack for two albums, during which her genuine feel for the blues became evident, not only in her Sonny Thompson-style piano playing, but also through her authentic \"bluesy\" voice.Fleetwood Mac, by Steve Clarke, Proteus Books, 1984, p. 47 Chicken Shack had a hit with \"I'd Rather Go Blind\", which featured McVie on lead vocals.Fleetwood Mac, by Steve Clarke, Proteus Books, 1984, p. 48 McVie received a Melody Maker award for female vocalist in both 1969 and 1970.
