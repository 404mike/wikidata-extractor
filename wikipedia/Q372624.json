Birmingham equalised near the end of the game to deal Liverpool's top four ambitions another blow. Liverpool's second game of April was a drab home game against Europea League-contending Fulham at Anfield.

Liverpool were now three points off the top four, having played a game more than Tottenham and Manchester City. Liverpool's third game of April was a Monday night fixture to relegation threatened West Ham United at Anfield. Liverpool took three points from this game, but needed to beat Chelsea to keep their hope of a Champions League place alive.  Steven Gerrard's back-pass allowed Chelsea to score, and after that, Chelsea pressed home their advantage.  The loss for Liverpool meant they failed to qualify for the Champions League.
