A year later his supporters again attempted to persuade Jenkins to challenge Wilson for the party leadership but he again declined.Campbell, Roy Jenkins: A Well-Rounded Life, p. 334. He later wrote in his memoirs that the 1968 plot was \"for me...the equivalent of the same season of 1953 for Rab Butler.

At this stage, however, Jenkins would not fully abandon his position as a political insider, and chose to stand again for deputy leader, an act his colleague David Marquand claimed he later came to regret.

Labour MP David Marquand, a trained historian, wrote Ramsay MacDonald with the stated intention of giving MacDonald his due for his work in founding and building the Labour Party, and in trying to preserve peace in the years between the two world wars. He argued also to place MacDonald's fateful decision in 1931 in the context of the crisis of the times and the limited choices open to him. Marquand praised the prime minister's decision to place national interests before that of party in 1931. He also emphasised MacDonald's lasting intellectual contribution to socialism and his pivotal role in transforming Labour from an outside protest group to an inside party of government.Martin (2003) p 837."]}, {"page": "Aneurin Bevan", "response": ["Bevan was instead appointed Minister of Labour in January 1951 in place of George Isaacs.

Usher stated that MacDonald needed to answer three crucial questions: first, whether he wanted to form a new party; second, whether he envisaged returning to the Labour Party; and third, whether the National Government would continue for a long time and produce a single party of the centre. Usher argued that it was not possible to create a distinctive National Labour Party because any distinctive policy would threaten the unity of the National Government coalition. He also contended that MacDonald could not return to the Labour Party, which harboured extreme bitterness about the manner in which the National Government was formed. Usher concluded that the public favoured a large centrist party, but that existing political organisations would not permit it.David Marquand, \"Ramsay MacDonald\", Jonathan Cape, 1977, p. 675-6.", "MacDonald remained Prime Minister as the head of a coalition government until June 1935, when he gave way to Stanley Baldwin and became instead Lord President of the Council. At the 1935 general election, the party sponsored 20 candidates, eight of whom were elected. A notable new recruit was Harold Nicolson, a former diplomat and an ex-political associate of Oswald Mosley when he created the New Party. Immediately after the election, the News-Letter argued that Labour supporters of the National Government were hidden \"thanks to the trade union 'terror'\" and that the party ought to appeal for the votes of all socialists and trade unionists opposed to being herded into the political wilderness.\"Election of a Speaker\", The Times, 22 November 1935, p. 14.
