In 1830 Lieutenant Governor Sir James Stirling visited the area and a military post was subsequently established; it only lasted six months. The area was renamed Bunbury by the Governor in recognition of Lieutenant Henry William St Pierre Bunbury, who developed the very difficult inland route from Pinjarra to Bunbury.Reed, A. W.

On 24 January 1832, he made the first recorded ascent of a peak in the Stirling Range, scaling Toolbrunup.  Late in 1835, Governor James Stirling and John Septimus Roe led an expedition from Albany to Perth. They first saw the Stirling Range on 3 November, and on travelling closer to them the following day, Roe gave them their name. Because Stirling personally led the Pinjarra massacre and later threatened the Noongar people with genocide, there are some calls to rename the Stirling Range."]}, {"page": "Harvey, Western Australia", "response": ["Harvey's name is derived from the nearby Harvey River, named by Governor James Stirling in 1829, soon after the river's discovery by explorers Alexander Collie and Lieutenant William Preston RN."]}, {"page": "Pindjarup", "response": ["The lands of the Pindjarup were first explored by Europeans in 1829, when Lieutenant P.

The Pindjarup killed one of the exploring party, George MacKenzie, a 19-year-old, in 1830.

The Old Farm at Strawberry Hill has exceptional national and state cultural significance as it was the first farm in the state of Western Australia, about  being developed by the officers of the military settlement of King George's Sound. Vegetables were grown there for the survival of the soldiers and then the early settlers. A cottage was constructed by Dr Alexander Collie, the first Government Resident, for a visit by Governor Stirling in 1831.

Often seen by divers at night in the Pacific Northwest, this cartilaginous fish gets its characteristic name from a pointed rat-like tail. The ratfish lays leathery egg cases on the bottom of muddy or sandy areas, which are often mistaken by divers as something inanimate. While mainly a deep-water species, it occurs at shallower depths in the northern part of its range.  The generic name, Hydrolagus, comes from the Greek words \u1f55\u03b4\u03c9\u03c1, meaning water,Liddell, H.G. & Scott, R. (1940).

Vigors coined the binomial name Pica colleriei, with the specific epithet chosen to  honour Alexander Collie, the surgeon onboard the Blossom, who had presented the specimen to the Zoological Society of London.
