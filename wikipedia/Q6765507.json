These flights were the topic of acrimonious diplomatic cables between British officials and the American embassy, later leaked by WikiLeaks, with David Miliband saying that \"policymakers needed to get control of the military\". The British were concerned that the flights over Lebanon were authorised by the Lebanese Ministry of Defence rather than the entire cabinet, and that the intelligence so gained could lead to the UK being complicit in the unlawful torture of detainees. After warnings that these issues \"could jeopardize future use of British territory\", John Rood, a senior Bush administration official, and Mariot Leslie, the Foreign Office's director general for defence and intelligence, became involved. Leslie said that the U.S. was not actually expected to check on detained terrorists, but that future spy missions would require full written applications."]}, {"page": "List of diplomats of the United Kingdom to Norway", "response": ["*2002\u20132006: Mariot Leslie, C.M.G."]}, {"page": "2014 Scottish independence referendum", "response": ["The former Secretary General of NATO and Scottish Labour peer Lord Robertson said in 2013 that \"either the SNP accept the central nuclear role of NATO ... or they reject the nuclear role of NATO and ensure that a separate Scottish state stays out of the world's most successful defence alliance.\" General Richard Shirreff criticised SNP proposals for defence and questioned whether other NATO members would accept an independent Scotland that rejected the principle of nuclear deterrence.
