By 1796 it represented only one man in every 43 of those eligible. But in that year  an additional ballot was carried out to raise men for the 'Supplementary Militia' to reinforce the standing militia regiments and to form additional temporary regiments. Lancashire's quota was increased to five regiments, and recruitment became difficult. Nevertheless, the 2nd Royal Lancashire Supplementary Militia was raised on 2 March 1797 at Preston under the command of Sir Henry Hoghton, 7th Baronet (Member of parliament (MP) for PrestonHoghton at History of Parliament.) as Colonel of the Regiment. It was formally embodied for service on 25 February 1798, and was placed on a permanent footing as the 3rd Royal Lancashire Militia (3rd RLM) in 1800. The Peace of Amiens was signed on 27 March 1802, and the regiment was disembodied on 24 April, apart from the small permanent staff.Fortescue, Vol IV, pp. 639\u201341, 888\u20139.Frederick, p. 190.Hay, pp. 150\u20131.Hay, pp. 371\u20134.London Gazette, 4 March 1797.Royal Lancashire Militia at Lancashire Infantry Museum.3rd RLM at Regiments.org.Militia at Museum of the Manchester Regiment.2nd-5th RLM at School of Mars.Parkyn.Western, pp. 246, 269, 282.Williamson & Whalley, p. 145.
