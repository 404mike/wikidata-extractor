Smith became a professional player in 1913.He entered the World Billiards Championship in 1920 and then again in 1923, winning it on both occasions.  Arguments with the governing body prevented him from taking part in the competition more often.In 1930 he started writing for The Burwat Billiard Review, a magazine published by the Cue Sport Manufacturers Burroughes and Watts. These were instructional articles with accompanying illustrations and photographs.He turned to snooker for purely monetary reasons but never really took to the game.
