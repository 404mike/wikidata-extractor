In his first season with the club he forged a strong partnership with Scott Doe as the Daggers finished in the top half narrowly avoiding the play-offs. Featuring 48 times for the club, he was also named as runner-up in the Player of the Year awards. He also scored twice during their Football League Trophy run; once against Colchester United and once against Southend United. He started the 2014\u201315 season as first choice centre-back continuing his partnership with Scott Doe, but lost his place in the team around Christmas due to the emergence of loan signing Ayo Obileye. In March 2015, he was sent out on loan to Conference Premier club Woking on a 28-day loan in order to help boost their promotion push. The loan deal was extended three weeks later until the end of the season. In May 2015, Saah was released from the club after two seasons, having made 75 appearances and scoring twice."]}, {"page": "Harlee Dean", "response": ["A centre back, Dean captained the Hall Mead School team for five years and forwent his A-levels in order to join the youth team at Dagenham & Redbridge.
