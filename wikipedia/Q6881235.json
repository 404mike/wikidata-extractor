The match ended as a 1\u20131 draw after referee Stuart Attwell disallowed two Derby goals in the final few minutes. Atwell also booked eight players and issued a straight red card to Forest midfielder Lewis McGugan. Jewell was especially vocal in his dismay at Attwell's performance, accusing the 25-year-old official of 'losing control' of the game and 'robbing' the Rams of a victory. The press furore around his display saw Attwell called in for a meeting with Referee's Chief Keith Hackett and was consequently axed from the following week's fixture list. Days after the game Derby manager Paul Jewell said that a member of the Football Association had contacted him and told him that the second goal should have stood. The Attwell controversy overshadowed Derby's run of only one defeat in 11 and their retention of the Brian Clough Trophy. It also stretched Derby's unbeaten streak against Forest to five, having lost just once to their rivals in the last 11 meetings. Following the Forest game however, Derby's form began to stutter \u2013 despite two wins over League One clubs Brighton & Hove Albion (4\u20131) and Leeds United (2\u20131) in the League Cup, taking Derby to their first quarter-final in the competition since 1989, Derby won just one of their next four league games, a 3\u20130 win over Sheffield Wednesday that gave them their biggest league win since a 5\u20131 win over Colchester United in May 2007. The club's dip in form saw Jewell making vocal his desire to bring fresh legs and impetus into a squad being hit by injuries and a busy fixture list, whilst assistant manager Chris Hutchings called for greater 'consistency'. Despite the club's disappointing form they remained in contention for the play-offs. The last week of November proved to be a busy one as the club signed former Southampton defender Darren Powell on a free transfer and brought in West Ham United youngster James Tomkins and Charlton Athletic's Luke Varney in on loan, with Andy Todd, Liam Dickinson, Jay McEveley and Mitchell Hanson\"Hanson heads to Notts\", dcfc.co.uk, 27 November 2008. going out on loan to Northampton, Blackpool, Charlton and Notts County respectively.", "!Mitchell Hanson", "!Mitchell Hanson", "|align=\"left\"|31||align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"| Mitchell Hanson"]}, {"page": "Mitch Hanson", "response": ["#REDIRECT Mitchell Hanson"]}, {"page": "2009\u201310 Derby County F.C. season", "response": ["!Mitchell Hanson", "|align=\"left\"|28||align=\"left\"|DF||align=\"left\"|Mitchell Hanson", "||DF||align=\"left\"|Mitchell Hanson"]}, {"page": "2008\u201309 Notts County F.C. season", "response": ["| 24 || DF || Mitchell Hanson || 2 || 0"]}, {"page": "2010\u201311 Derby County F.C. season", "response": ["With injuries continuing to bite into the squad, with five centrebacks in Dean Leacock, Russell Anderson, Jake Buxton, Miles Addison and Mitchell Hanson unavailable, forcing rightback John Brayford to deputise at centrehalf and midfielder Paul Green to move rightback, Derby revealed they had made a loan approach for an unnamed 21-year-old Premier League defender ahead of the trip to Swansea City. though it was rebuffed. It was also announced that Arnaud Mendy's loan spell at Tranmere Rovers had been extended for another two months. They also took Euan Holden on trial. Of the loanees at the club, Luke Moore's spell at the club was extended to a second month, though Ryan Noble returned to Sunderland at the end of his 29-day loan after a back injury restricted him to just one substitute appearance, though Clough suggested a desire to bring him back when he regained full fitness.", "The club entered into the second international break of the season with a 0\u20130 draw at Swansea City which took the club's unbeaten run to four games, ending The Swans 100% home record in the process.

The promise of the imminent return of the defensive trio was dampened by the news first-choice goalkeeper Stephen Bywater has been ruled out for four weeks with a wrist injury sustained in training. The club moved to bring in a loan keeper, as they had the previous campaign while Bywater was suspended, and were linked with former number one Lee Grant and former target, Blackburn Rovers stopper Frank Fielding. Fielding eventually joined ahead of the Preston North End game on an emergency four-week deal. Saul Deeney was then ruled out of contention due to being placed on compassionate leave due to a serious family illness, leading to a recall for Ross Atkins from his loan spell at Tamworth, with James Severn instead sent to the club as a compensatory replacement. Fielding kept a clean sheet on his debut, a 3\u20130 victory over Preston North End and then helped The Rams to a second consecutive win as they beat Doncaster Rovers 3\u20132 at Keepmoat Stadium to reach 7th in the table, the club's highest league position since the opening day of the 2009\u201310 season.

Contract-rebel Kris Commons joined Celtic for a fee of around \u00a3300k, turning down a \u00a3500k overture from Celtic's Old Firm rivals who failed to match his wage demands. Left back Dean Moxey was the subject of a \u00a3400,000 bid from Crystal Palace, which was accepted by Derby. Clough stated the bid's acceptance was football, rather than financially related, explaining \"He (Moxey) has not really progressed this season as much as we hoped. We just thought it was a good offer. We have got another good left back in Gareth Roberts and we can always get cover in on loan if we need it.\" Other departures saw Medi Abalimba, whose contract at Derby was terminated but the club held onto his registration, join Oldham Athletic on a free and the young trio of Graham Kelly, Mitchell Hanson and Kallum Keane had their contracts canceled five months early by mutual consent.
