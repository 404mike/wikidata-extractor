In 1861, there were 571 primary and 94 secondary schools for Ottoman Christians with 140,000 pupils in total, a figure that vastly exceeded the number of Muslim children in school at the same time, who were further hindered by the amount of time spent learning Arabic and Islamic theology. Author Norman Stone further suggests that the Arabic alphabet, in which Turkish was written until 1928, was very ill-suited to reflect the sounds of the Turkish language (which is a Turkic as opposed to Semitic language), which imposed a further difficulty on Turkish children. In turn, the higher educational levels of the Christians allowed them to play a larger role in the economy, with the rise in prominence of groups such as the Sursock family indicative of this shift in influence. In 1911, of the 654 wholesale companies in Istanbul, 528 were owned by ethnic Greeks. In many cases, Christians and also Jews were able to gain protection from European consuls and citizenship, meaning they were protected from Ottoman law and not subject to the same economic regulations as their Muslim counterparts.", "Several historians such as British historian Edward Gibbon and the Greek historian Dimitri Kitsikis have argued that after the fall of Constantinople, the Ottoman state took over the machinery of the Byzantine (Roman) state and that in essence, the Ottoman Empire was a continuation of the Eastern Roman Empire under a Turkish Muslim guise.Norman Stone, \"Turkey in the Russian Mirror\" pp. 86\u2013100 from Russia War, Peace and Diplomacy edited by Mark & Ljubica Erickson, Weidenfeld & Nicolson: London, 2004 pp. 92\u201393 The American historian Speros Vryonis wrote that the Ottoman state was centered on \"a Byzantine-Balkan base with a veneer of the Turkish language and the Islamic religion\".Stone, pp. 86\u2013100 The American historian Heath Lowry and Kitsikis posit that the early Ottoman state was predatory confederacy open to both Byzantine Christians and Turkish Muslims, whose primary goal was attaining booty and slaves, rather than spreading Islam, and that only later Islam became the primary characteristic of the empire.Heath W. Lowry, The nature of the early Ottoman state (SUNY Press, 2003).Dariusz Ko\u0142odziejczyk, \"Khan, caliph, tsar and imperator: the multiple identities of the Ottoman sultan\" in Peter Fibiger Bang, and Dariusz Kolodziejczyk, eds.

A Bridge Between Cultures (2006) p. 9. Other historians have followed the lead of the Austrian historian Paul Wittek who emphasized the Islamic character of the early Ottoman state, seeing the Ottoman state as a \"Jihad state\" dedicated to expanding the Muslim world. Many historians led in 1937 by the Turkish historian Mehmet Fuat K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc championed the Ghazi thesis that saw the early Ottoman state as a continuation of the way of life of the nomadic Turkic tribes who had come from East Asia to Anatolia via Central Asia and the Middle East on a much larger scale. They argued that the most important cultural influences on the Ottoman state came from Persia.Ronald C. Jennings, \"Some thoughts on the Gazi-thesis.\" Wiener Zeitschrift f\u00fcr die Kunde des Morgenlandes 76 (1986): 151\u2013161 online.", "The British historian Norman Stone suggested many continuities between the Eastern Roman and Ottoman empires such as the zeugarion tax of Byzantium becoming the Ottoman Resm-i \u00e7ift tax, the pronoia land-holding system that linked the amount of land one owned with one's ability to raise cavalry becoming the Ottoman timar system, and the Ottoman measurement for land the d\u00f6n\u00fcm was the same as the Byzantine stremma. Stone also pointed out that despite the fact that Sunni Islam was the state religion, the Eastern Orthodox Church was supported and controlled by the Ottoman state, and in return to accepting that control became the largest land-holder in the Ottoman Empire. Despite the similarities, Stone argued that a crucial difference was that the land grants under the timar system were not hereditary at first. Even after land grants under the timar system became inheritable, land ownership in the Ottoman Empire remained highly insecure, and the sultan could and did revoke land grants whenever he wished. Stone argued this insecurity in land tenure strongly discouraged Timariots from seeking long-term development of their land, and instead led the timariots to adopt a strategy of short-term exploitation, which ultimately had deleterious effects on the Ottoman economy.Stone, pp. 94\u201395."]}, {"page": "Foreign relations of Russia", "response": ["British academic Norman Stone in his article \"No wonder they like Putin\" compared Putin to General Charles de Gaulle.No wonder they like Putin. by Norman Stone The Times 4 December 2007.
