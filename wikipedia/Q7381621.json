Speculated by the British media and supported in part by various press releases, the club were believed to be given multimillion-pound backing, and were linked during the takeover's initial planning stages with the Qatari royal family by British tabloids. However, the latter claim was denied by the family. The supporters' trust, which owned the majority 60% share in the club, voted in favour of the takeover. On 14 July 2009, the takeover was confirmed, with Peter Trembling being appointed as executive chairman. A week later, former England manager Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson was announced as the club's new director of football, having been persuaded by convicted fraudster Russell King to join Notts County.
