One obvious but unattributed influence is the psychedelic 1967 track 'Embryonic Journey' by Jefferson Airplane. Ross's advanced technique and his sure feeling for rhythm combine with uncommon ideas to make his style instantly recognizable. He often uses percussive techniques and plays intricate down and upstroke patterns with his thumb. These techniques have found their way into the toolboxes of many competitive fingerstyle guitarists. His use of acrylic nails allows him to get a consistent, clean tone without the hassle of broken fingernails."]}, {"page": "Kicking Mule Records", "response": ["| 152 || Stefan Grossman & John Renbourn || Stefan Grossman & John Renbourn || 1977 || guitar duets", "| 162 || Stefan Grossman & John Renbourn || Under The Volcano || 1979 || guitar duets ", "| 163 || John Renbourn || The Black Balloon || 1979 || guitar solos"]}, {"page": "Sunjay", "response": ["In 2012 he supported Wizz Jones and John Renbourn on several of their joint UK tour dates.
