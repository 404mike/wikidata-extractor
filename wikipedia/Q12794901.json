In an effort to downsize the army and consolidate as many men within as few formations as possible to maintain fighting strength and efficiency, the War Office began disbanding divisions, including the 80th Infantry (Reserve) Division. As part of this restructure, the decision was made to retain division numbers familiar to the British public. On 1 September 1944, the 38th Division was recreated as the 38th Infantry (Reserve) Division to replace the 80th as Western Command's training formation. The new 38th Division was commanded by Major-General Lionel Howard Cox, who had previously commanded the 80th Division. At this point, the divisional insignia was worn only by the permanent members of the division."]}, {"page": "80th Infantry (Reserve) Division (United Kingdom)", "response": ["During the Second World War, the divisions of the British Army were divided between \"Higher Establishment\" and \"Lower Establishment\" formations. The former were intended for deployment overseas and combat, whereas the latter were strictly for home defence in a static role. During the winter of 1942\u201343, three \"Lower Establishment\" divisions were renamed \"Reserve Divisions\". On 1 January 1943, these three were supplemented by the raising of a new reserve division, the 80th Infantry placed under the command of General officer commanding Major-General Lionel Howard Cox. The four reserve divisions were used as training units. Soldiers who had completed their corps training were assigned to these divisions. The soldiers were given five weeks of additional training at the section, platoon and company level, before undertaking a final three-day exercise. Troops would then be ready to be sent overseas to join other formations. Training was handled in this manner to relieve the \"Higher Establishment\" divisions from being milked for replacements for other units and to allow them to intensively train without the interruption of having to handle new recruits."]}, {"page": "Lionel Cox", "response": ["*Lionel Howard Cox (1893\u20131949), British Army officer"]}, {"page": "1945 Birthday Honours", "response": ["*Major-General (temporary) Lionel Howard Cox, CBE, MC (5085), late The Gloucestershire Regiment."]}, {"page": "1918 New Year Honours (MC)", "response": ["*Capt.
