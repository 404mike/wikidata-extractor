Drummer Bill Ward of Black Sabbath can be seen playing a brief blast beat in a 1970 performance of \"War Pigs.\"  Additionally, drummer Carl Palmer of the progressive rock super-group Emerson, Lake & Palmer briefly used a blast beat in the band's 1970 instrumental \"The Barbarian\". King Crimson's \"The Devil's Triangle\" from their 1970 album In the Wake of Poseidon also features an early example of proto-blastbeats in the later half of the song. However, the blast beat as it is known today originated in the European hardcore and grindcore scenes in the 1980s. Contrary to popular belief, blast beats originated from punk and hardcore music, not metal music.  DVD: ASIN: B002UD475Y.  In the UK punk and hardcore scene of the early 1980s there were many bands attempting to play as fast as possible. In 1985 emerging grindcore band Napalm Death replaced their former drummer Miles \"Rat\" Ratledge with Mick Harris, who brought to the band a whole new level of speed. Harris is credited with developing the term \"blast beat\", describing the fast notes played on the kick and snare. Harris started using the blast beat as a fundamental aspect of Napalm Death's early musical compositions. It was finally with Napalm Death's first full-length album Scum (1987) that blast beat started to evolve into a distinct musical expression of its own. Blast beats became popular in extreme music from the mid to late 1980s . The blast beat evolved into its modern form as it was developed in the American death metal and grindcore scene of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Pete Sandoval, drummer of Terrorizer (1986\u20131989) and later Morbid Angel (1984\u20132013), purportedly was the first to use blast beats in metronomic time (and not as arhythmic or non-metric white noise) and thus gave it a more useful musical characteristic for timekeeping."]}, {"page": "Gong", "response": ["Hubback's works have been used by many musicians including solo percussionist Dame Evelyn Glennie and rock drummer Carl Palmer."]}, {"page": "Arthur Brown (musician)", "response": ["By 1968, the debut album, The Crazy World of Arthur Brown became a hit on both sides of the Atlantic.

Emerson, Lake & Palmer became one of the most successful groups in the 1970s. Lake became known for performing on a Persian carpet on stage, refusing to take to the stage unless it were present; it was often cited as an icon of the band's lavish and egocentric stagepieces. Years later Lake confessed that the carpet was purchased to disguise a rubber mat he used to alleviate his fear of electrocution, which he developed after an incident with a live microphone. Sinfield, who went with Lake to purchase the carpet, felt that this was only half the story, and said that Lake was driven to keep up with Emerson's extravagant equipment: \"He was one of those classic keep-up-with-the-Joneses cases.\" In addition, Lake would change his guitar strings after each show on tour.", "In October 1983, at friend Carl Palmer's request, Lake briefly joined Palmer in the 1980s supergroup Asia, to replace fellow King Crimson alumnus John Wetton for four scheduled concerts in Japan. Lake agreed and spent six weeks learning Asia's songs, culminating in his performance in the \"Asia in Asia\" concert at the Nippon Budokan Hall in Tokyo, 6 December 1983, the first concert broadcast over satellite to MTV in the United States, and later made into a home video. Lake left the group after the tour, having joined as a favor for the Japanese concerts only.", "In 1986, he and Keith Emerson decided to re-form Emerson, Lake & Palmer to record another album. However, Carl Palmer continued to have commitments to Asia, so Lake and Emerson auditioned other artists. They found good rapport with drummer Cozy Powell, and recorded their eponymous album Emerson, Lake & Powell with him.", "Lake died in London on 7 December 2016, at the age of 69, after suffering from cancer. His manager announced the news on Twitter, describing Lake's battle with the illness as \"long and stubborn\". Numerous fellow musicians paid tribute, including Rick Wakeman and Steve Hackett, Ringo Starr, John Wetton, Opeth's Mikael \u00c5kerfeldt, Jethro Tull's Ian Anderson and ELP drummer Carl Palmer. Lake's death occurred nine months after that of Keith Emerson, leaving Palmer the only living member of Emerson, Lake & Palmer."]}, {"page": "List of people from Birmingham", "response": ["*Carl Palmer \u2013 Musician, Emerson, Lake & Palmer"]}, {"page": "Greensboro Coliseum Complex", "response": ["|Todd Rundgren & Carl Palmer's Elp Legacy"]}, {"page": "Modern Drummer", "response": ["Among the books Modern Drummer Publications has released are titles by well-known drummers such as Gary Chester, Carl Palmer and Bill Bruford.

He is known for having a drum corps background, but never actually marched a summer season. He played tenor drums for the Florida Wave Drum and Bugle Corps through a few years of their winter/spring camps. He studied orchestral percussion at the University of South Florida, but never took formal drum set lessons. Stanier cites Neil Peart as his biggest influence. He has also been influenced by drummers such as John Bonham, Billy Cobham, Bill Bruford, Terry Bozzio, Carl Palmer, and Lenny White. Stanier's drumming with Helmet has been cited as a big influence on a new generation of rock drummers.

Chief among these was guitarist Andy Dalby, who was the only consistent member after Brown himself."]}, {"page": "John Wetton", "response": ["After the break-up of U.K., Wetton released his first solo album, Caught in the Crossfire (1980). Later that year he had a brief stint in Wishbone Ash, appearing on their album Number the Brave (1981). In late 1981 he had a meeting with Geffen Records' boss John Kalodner who took him to task for playing bass in Bryan Ferry's backing band, feeling he should be fronting a group himself. At Kalodner's insistence, Wetton started writing with former Yes guitarist Steve Howe, with a view to forming their own band. Joined by keyboardist Geoff Downes, and drummer Carl Palmer (of Emerson, Lake & Palmer), this band would become Asia, and they produced one of the largest selling albums of the 1980s. Their self-titled debut album \"Asia\" sold over 10 million copies worldwide, making the band a household name across the globe. John worked with Asia until 1983. In that year, Wetton was fired from Asia (at the insistence of Geffen Records) for then unknown reasons, but at least in part due to lower-than-expected sales of the Alpha (1983) album. He returned to Asia in 1985 (with Mandy Meyer replacing Steve Howe on guitar) to complete Astra (1985).\"Asia: Continental Drift?\", CREEM Magazine, April 1986", "In the late 1980s, a collaboration between Wetton and Roxy Music guitarist Phil Manzanera was released as Wetton/Manzanera (1986). Around this time, Wetton began working with Geoff Downes and Carl Palmer to restart Asia. Some of the material they recorded was featured on 1990's Then & Now CD, including a radio hit in \"Days Like These.\"", "The 1990s saw Wetton mostly focusing on his solo career. In 1999, an aborted attempt to reform Asia resulted in Wetton and Carl Palmer forming a short-lived progressive group dubbed Qango with John Young and Dave Kilminster. Qango performed several shows in the UK, and recorded a live album, Live in the Hood, before disbanding."]}]}}
