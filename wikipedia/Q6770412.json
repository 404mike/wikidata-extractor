India ended the tournament with 7 wins, 2 losses and 1 no-result, topping the round-robin stage, with both losses coming against eventual finalists England and New Zealand (the no-result coming against the latter opponent as well). With 648 runs and 5 centuries, including 81 boundaries (67 fours and 14 sixes) and involvement in two record first wicket opening stands of 189 and 180 respectively, Rohit Sharma ended the tournament as the highest scorer and with the most centuries. He was also the first batsman to score the most centuries in a single World Cup. Among the bowlers, Jasprit Bumrah was the highest wicket-taker for India with 18 wickets, placing him in joint fourth place alongside England's Mark Wood. He also took the most maidens (9) in the tournament. Also, Mohammed Shami was one of two bowlers, the other being New Zealand's Trent Boult, to take a hat-trick in the tournament, and only the second Indian bowler to do so after Chetan Sharma in 1987."]}, {"page": "2019 Cricket World Cup", "response": ["Week four saw David Warner score 166, the highest individual score of the tournament, as Australia's total of 381/5 proved out of reach for Bangladesh, despite Mahmudullah and Mushfiqur Rahim getting them within 48 runs of the target. Friday saw Lasith Malinga dismantle the English top order, as his four wickets helped Sri Lanka defend a total of 232 for their second win of the tournament. Despite the best efforts of Stokes, who was left stranded on 82 not out, England fell 21 short. Angelo Mathews top-scored for the Sri Lankans with an unbeaten 85, while Mark Wood was the best of the English bowlers with 3/40. The Saturday games saw the first elimination of the tournament, with Afghanistan's loss to India at Southampton meaning they could no longer qualify for the knockout stage. Despite limiting India to 224 from their 50 overs, a Mohammed Shami hat-trick saw Afghanistan fall 12 runs short. The other match on the Saturday saw a close game between New Zealand and the West Indies at Manchester. After New Zealand scored 291/8, including 148 from Kane Williamson, they had the West Indies reeling at 164/7 after 27 overs. The momentum, though, was swung to the West Indies, with Carlos Brathwaite making 101 (including five sixes and nine fours) as he led them to within six runs of the target; however, his attempt to finish off the game with a six saw him caught by Trent Boult at long on, as New Zealand won by five runs."]}, {"page": "Steven Finn", "response": ["Finn was named as back-up in the first two tests in the series, and replaced Mark Wood in the third test at Edgbaston, making his first appearance in the England test team after two years.

Later in the innings, he bowled Australia captain Michael Clarke, ending with figures of 2/38. During Australia's second innings, Finn again claimed the prized wickets of both Smith and Clarke, as well as his best figures of 6/79 that ripped through the Australian middle order en route to his player of the match honour. In the fourth Test of the series, Finn took 1\u201321 in Australia's first innings but remained wicketless in their second as England won the match in convincing style to clinch the series 3\u20131.

Going into the series, England were underdogs. Ahead of the first Test, there were no changes to the England squad and the same team was selected that played in the New Zealand Test series. England won the first Test by 169 runs, with Joe Root in particular impressing. In the second Test England named an unchanged team but suffered a heavy defeat by 405 runs after a batting collapse in the second innings. England made two changes for the third Test, with Jonny Bairstow replacing the out of form Gary Ballance and Steven Finn replacing the injured Mark Wood. England went on to win the game by eight wickets after dismissing Australia for 136 in their first innings. James Anderson took 6\u201347 in the Australian first innings, while Steven Finn took 6\u201379 in their second innings. Ahead of the fourth Test James Anderson was ruled out through injury and replaced by Mark Wood. England bowled Australia out for just 60 in their first innings, with Stuart Broad taking 8\u201315. After Joe Root scored a century in England's reply, Ben Stokes took six Australian second innings wickets as England won by an innings and 78 runs. With the Ashes already won, England named an unchanged team, with Anderson still injured. Australia made a big total in their first innings, and England were dismissed cheaply in theirs. Although England batted better when following on, Australia won the game by an innings and 48 runs. Despite this, England won the Ashes 3\u20132 and regained the urn. In the limited overs series, England won the first T20 match between the sides. Joe Root was rested for the ODI series and James Taylor replaced him at three. The ODI series got off to a bad start for England, with them losing the first two games. However, they won the third match by 93 runs and won the fourth by three wickets.
