Perhaps most paradoxical of all was the Okhrana\u2019s collaboration with revolutionary organizations.Fredric S. Zuckerman, \"Political Police and Revolution: The Impact of the 1905 Revolution on the Tsarist Secret Police\", Journal of Contemporary History 27 (1992): 281.  Early Okhrana agents to work alongside revolutionaries included Lieutenant-Colonel Georgy Sudeykin of the St. Petersburg Special Section, who, in 1882, set up an illegal printing operation to publish the revolutionary  People's Will literature with Okhrana funds. Sudeykin and his colleague, a revolutionary-turned-police-informant named Sergey Degayev, passed drafts of the publication through Okhrana censors before printing. This episode marked the beginning of the Okhrana's efforts to surreptitiously observe, but also influence and undermine, revolutionary movements.Ronald Hingley, The Russian Secret Police: Muscovite, Imperial Russian, and Soviet Political Security Operations (New York: Dorset, 1970), 75\u20136.  This focus on infiltrating and influencing revolutionary groups, rather than merely identifying and arresting their members,  intensified with the innovations of one Okhrana bureau chief, Sergey Zubatov. While  P.I. Rachkovsky, as head of the Okhrana's Foreign Agency, had long ordered Okhrana agents to infiltrate and influence revolutionary movements abroad, Zubatov brought these tactics to a new level by setting up Okhrana-controlled trade unions, the foundation of police socialism.Richard J. Johnson, \"Zagranichnaia Agentura: The Tsarist Political Police in Europe\", Journal of Contemporary History 7 (1972): 226.  Hingley, Russian Secret Police, 87.  Perhaps recognizing the same discontent among factory workers that the Bolsheviks sought to exploit to start a revolution, Zubatov hoped the unions would mollify factory workers with improvements in working conditions and thus prevent workers from joining revolutionary movements that threatened the monarchy. To this end, Zubatov set up the Moscow Mechanical Production Workers' Mutual Aid Society in May 1901. After Zubatov became head of the Special Section in 1902, he expanded his trade unions from Moscow to St. Petersburg and to Southern Russia.Hingley, Russian Secret Police, 88\u201389.

It is considered one of the four masterworks written by Dostoevsky after his return from Siberian exile, along with Crime and Punishment (1866), The Idiot (1869) and The Brothers Karamazov (1880). Demons is a social and political satire, a psychological drama, and large-scale tragedy. Joyce Carol Oates has described it as \"Dostoevsky's most confused and violent novel, and his most satisfactorily 'tragic' work.\"Joyce Carol Oates: Tragic Rites In Dostoevsky's The Possessed, p. 3 According to Ronald Hingley, it is Dostoevsky's \"greatest onslaught on Nihilism\", and \"one of humanity's most impressive achievements\u2014perhaps even its supreme achievement\u2014in the art of prose fiction.\"", "Dostoevsky biographer Ronald Hingley described the novel as \"an awesome, prophetic warning which humanity, no less possessed of collective and individual devilry in the 1970s than in the 1870s, shows alarmingly few signs of heeding.\" Robert L. Belknap notes its relevance to the twentieth century in general, \"when a few Stavrogins empowered thousands of Pyotr Stepanovichs to drive herds of 'capital', to use Nechayev's term, to slaughter about a hundred million people, the very number Shigalyev and Pyotr hit upon.\"Belknap, Robert.

Encyclopaedia Britannica. The organization had just a few dozen members when student Ivan Ivanovich Ivanov\u2014one of Nechayev's first and most active followers\u2014began to protest the leader's methods. This threat to his authority spurred Nechayev into action. He secretly gathered the group members closest to him, declared that the mysterious imaginary central committee possessed the evidence of Ivanov's betrayal, albeit not producible for security reasons, and obtained his death sentence. Author Ronald Hingley wrote: \"On the evening of 21\u00a0November 1869 the victim [Ivanov] was accordingly lured to the premises of the Moscow School of Agriculture, a hotbed of revolutionary sentiment, where Nechayev killed him by shooting and strangulation, assisted without great enthusiasm by three dupes. [...] Nechayev's accomplices were arrested and tried\", while he managed to flee. Upon his return from Russia to Switzerland, Nechayev was rejected by Bakunin for taking militant actions and was later extradited back to Russia where he spent the remainder of his life at the Peter and Paul Fortress. Due to his charisma and force of will, Nechayev continued to influence events, maintaining a relationship to Narodnaya Volya and weaving even his jailers into his plots and escape plans. In December 1881 69 members of the prison guard were arrested and Nechayev's prison regime was rendered exceedingly harsher. He was found dead of scurvy in his cell on 21 November 1882."]}, {"page": "Tom Hingley", "response": ["Hingley was born in Abingdon, Berkshire (now Oxfordshire) and grew up in nearby Frilford.
