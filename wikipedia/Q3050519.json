Based on her studies in agriculture, she became one of the first to define the field of agricultural entomology. She published an influential series of articles on useful insects and pests in the Gardeners' Chronicle and the Agricultural Gazette along with annual reports from 1877 to 1900. These annual reports were produced by summarizing information provided by her network of correspondents from across Britain. Belonging to the landed gentry, she worked as an honorary consulting entomologist with the Royal Agricultural Society of England and received no pay for any of her work. She also promoted the use of paris green as an insecticide and called for the extermination of the house sparrow.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of biologists", "response": ["*Eleanor Anne Ormerod (1828\u20131901), English entomologist who developed agricultural entomology"]}, {"page": "Dorothea Beale", "response": ["On 11 April 1902, the University of Edinburgh awarded her the honorary degree of LL.D., in recognition of her services to education.
