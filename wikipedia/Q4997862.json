In August 1965 he came on as a substitute, replacing Bunny Larkin; this was the first substitution in the club's history. Lincoln finished 22nd in 1965\u201366, and once again had to apply for re-election. In October 1966 he reverted to solely a playing capacity as Ron Gray was appointed as manager. He scored 21 goals in 1966\u201367 to become the club's top-scorer, but despite his scoring efforts the \"Imps\" still finished bottom of the Football League."]}, {"page": "1960 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final", "response": ["Two weeks before Birmingham's opening match, away to a Cologne representative team, Arthur Turner, who had led Birmingham to the semi-final of the competition the previous season, resigned as joint manager, leaving Pat Beasley in a caretaker role.

Unable to dislodge Dick Neal from the left-half position, Hume had to wait for his Football League debut until 18 March 1959, deputising for Neal in an away game against Leicester City which Birmingham won 4\u20132.Matthews, p. 194.

Beasley had believed he was coming as assistant to manager Arthur Turner, but chairman Harry Morris announced to the press that he was to be appointed joint manager.

He was persuaded to stay \"for the time being\", but finally left in September 1958, and Beasley took over as manager.Matthews, Complete Record, p. 62. Twenty-four players made at least one appearance in nationally organised first-team competition, and there were thirteen different goalscorers.

The score at half time in the first leg of the semi-final, at St Andrew's, was 3\u20133, and Peter Murphy scored the winner after an hour. In the away leg, in the recently opened Camp Nou, El Mundo Deportivo expected a comfortable victory for the hosts, but the result was rather less clear-cut. The only goal of the game was scored after 82 minutes by Kubala, who saw Gil Merrick off his line and neatly lobbed him. With no away goals rule, the game went into 30 minutes of extra time, which remained goalless, so a replay was to be played on a neutral ground. Controversy arose when Birmingham were prevented from substituting the injured Bunny Larkin, contrary to what they believed had been agreed before the match; Barcelona manager Dom\u00e8nec Balmanya claimed the agreement allowed for two substitutes, but outfield players could only be replaced in the first half. Asked what he thought of Barcelona, Birmingham trainer Dave Fairhurst said he thought they played better in the first leg, where they concentrated on playing; here, they spent too much time complaining. Balmanya's opinion of Birmingham had not changed since the first leg: he saw them as a physical team with crude technique, too concerned with the opponent to think much about the ball."]}, {"page": "Bunny (nickname)", "response": ["* Bunny Larkin (born 1936), English retired footballer "]}, {"page": "List of Norwich City F.C. players (25\u201399 appearances)", "response": ["|Bunny Larkin"]}, {"page": "Bernard Larkin", "response": ["#redirect Bunny Larkin"]}]}}
