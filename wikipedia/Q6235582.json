Godfrey was a right-handed batsman who bowled right-arm fast-medium.\nGodfrey made his first-class debut for Hampshire in 1939 against the touring West Indians. This was Godfrey's sole first-class match before the Second World War. In addition to a sole first-class appearance for Hampshire, Godfrey also played two Minor Counties Championship matches for Oxfordshire, with both matches coming against Berkshire.\nAfter the war, Godfrey returned to play for Hampshire where he made his County Championship debut against Sussex. From 1946 to 1947 Godfrey represented the county in eleven first-class matches, the last of which came against Glamorgan. Godfrey was primarily a bowler, although with the ball he failed to impress in first-class cricket with 15 wickets at an expensive bowling average of 50.20 and best figures of 4/116.\nIn 1948 Godfrey returned to play for Oxfordshire, where he represented the county in five further Counties Championship matches from 1948 to 1949, with his final appearance for Oxfordshire coming against Buckinghamshire.\nIn 1950 Godfrey joined Cambridgeshire, making his Minor Counties debut against an Essex Second XI. From 1950 to 1954 Godfrey represented Cambridgeshire in 36 matches, the last of which came against Hertfordshire.\nGodfrey died at Newton Abbot, Devon in October 1995.", "link_mentions": {}}}
