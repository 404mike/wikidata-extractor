Working in domestic service, she caught the attention of Arthur Munby, a prominent barrister and philanthropist, who was making a close study of the conditions of working women. To escape poverty, she married him reluctantly and secretly in 1873, and her diaries provide detailed information on the lives of working-class Victorian servant women. Her relation with Munby was unconventional, with bizarre role-playing, as documented in their diaries, letters and photographs as a farm girl, a kitchen drudge, a chimney sweep with blackface, a well-dressed lady and a man.

Women were seen as subordinate to men, and it is argued Victorian male identity was tied around maintaining control of this hierarchy in both the private and public spheres. Arthur Munby\u2019s relationship with Hannah Cullwick revolved around redefining the established sexual and social norms of Victorian Britain. Their relationship also pushed the social boundaries surrounding race and empire by engaging via Cullwick\u2019s racial crossdressing. The transgressions of sexuality in the public and private spheres, and the intermingling of different socio-economic classes, offered Munby and Cullwick the chance to exercise agency and control over the rigid norms of Victorian society.", "Munby had an interest in working-class women, particularly those who performed hard physical labour. A pastime was wandering the streets of London and other industrial cities where he approached working women to ask about their lives and the details of their work, while noting their clothes and dialects. The observations were recorded in his journals. These journals explore what Munby practiced with his wife, Hannah Cullwick, as well as his desire for the strength and care of a working woman.", "=== Hannah Cullwick ===", "In 1854 Munby met Hannah Cullwick, a Shropshire-born maid-of-all-work and diarist. They formed a relationship in which Munby was the master, to whom Cullwick addressed as 'massa' and Cullwick the slave, with him training her in the virtues of hard work and loyalty. However, Cullwick used this master/slave dynamic to prove her own worth outside of Munby and put herself in a place of power. For example, she used the slave band Munby gave her to display the fact that she was a working-class woman, and that she was not ashamed of it; this can be seen in Cullwick\u2019s journal when she says \"my hands and arms are tho' chief to me, to get my living with.\" Hannah Cullwick gave Munby the opportunity to explore the contrast between woman and man, hardy and delicate, as well as cross-class fluidity that was taboo in Victorian Society.", "* Atkinson, Diane; Love and Dirt: The Marriage of Arthur Munby and Hannah Cullwick.
