Apprenticed in 1804 to a manufacturer of camlets and bombazines, a taste for serious study was stimulated by his master, Alderman John Herring and by Joseph John Gurney. Becoming interested in geology and archaeology, he began to form the collection which after his death was purchased for the Norwich museum. In 1820 he obtained a clerkship in Gurney's (afterwards Barclay's) bank at Norwich, and Hudson Gurney and Dawson Turner (of Yarmouth), both fellows of the Royal Society, encouraged his scientific work.\nHe communicated to the Archaeologia articles on the round church towers of Norfolk, the Roman remains of the country, etc., and other papers on natural history and geology to the Mag. Nat. Hist. and Phil. Mag.\nHe was author of:\n\nA Synoptical Table of British Organic Remains (1830), the first work of its kind in Britain\nAn Outline of the Geology of Norfolk (1833)\nThe Norfolk Topographer's Manual (1842) issued posthumously\nThe History and Antiquities of Norwich Castle (1847) issued posthumouslyHis eldest son, Bernard Bolingbroke Woodward (1816\u20131869), was librarian and keeper of the prints and drawings at Windsor Castle from 1860 until his death. The second son, Samuel Pickworth Woodward (1821\u20131865), became in 1845 professor of geology and natural history in the Royal Agricultural College, Cirencester, and in 1848 was appointed assistant in the department of geology and mineralogy in the British Museum. He was author of A Manual of the Mollusca (in three parts, 1851, 1853 and 1856).\nSamuel Woodward's youngest son, Henry was also a noted geologist.\nSee Memoir of S.
