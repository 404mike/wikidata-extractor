Ballard was grateful to Carnell for the support he provided Ballard in the late 1950s.  Much of Ballard's work appeared in New Worlds and Science Fantasy, and Ballard later recalled that Carnell \"recognized what I was on about from a very early stage and he encouraged me to go on writing in my own way.\"Quoted in Ashley, Transformations, p.\u00a0148.  Carnell also published much of Brian Aldiss's early work in Science Fantasy and New Worlds.  John Brunner, later to become one of the most successful British science fiction writers, appeared regularly in the Nova magazines, starting with \"Visitors' Book\" in the April 1955 New Worlds.  James White began publishing with \"Assisted Passage\" in the January 1953 New Worlds, and in 1957 began his popular Sector General series, about a hospital for aliens, with \"Sector General\" in the November 1957 issue. John Wyndham, who was already well known outside the genre for works such as The Day of the Triffids,John Clute, \"John Wyndham\", in Clute & Nicholls, Encyclopedia of Science Fiction, pp.\u00a01353\u20131354. began a series about the Troons, a space-going family, with \"For All the Night\" in the April 1958 issue.Ashley, Transformations, pp.\u00a0142\u2013143.

This led to derision of the show by the critics of the day, although it always was wildly popular with kids and many adults. This improved after 1952 when scripts began being written by such major science fiction writers active at the time as Damon Knight, James Blish, Jack Vance, and Arthur C. Clarke. These late scripts displayed more intelligence, discipline and imagination than most of the other children's sci-fi series scripts of the era. Other well-known authors who occasionally wrote for the program included Isaac Asimov, Cyril M. Kornbluth, Milt Lesser, Walter M. Miller, Jr., Robert Sheckley, J. T. McIntosh, and Robert S. Richardson. One of the more prolific writers for the show was Maurice C. Brachhausen\u2014who wrote under the name M.C.
