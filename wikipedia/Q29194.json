In the 16th century the claim arose that the Spencers were a cadet branch of the ancient House Le Despencer, though this theory has since been debunked, in particular by J. Horace Round in his essay The Rise of the Spencers. The Spencers were first granted a coat of arms in 1504, \"Azure a fess Ermine between 6 sea-mews\u2019 heads erased Argent,\"  but this bears no resemblance to the arms used by the family after c. 1595, which were derived from the Despencer arms, \"Quarterly Argent and Gules in the second and third quarters a Fret Or overall on a Bend Sable three Escallops of the first\" (the scallops standing for the difference as a cadet branch). Round argued that the Despencer descent was fabricated by Richard Lee, a corrupt Clarencieux King of Arms.Round, pp. 292\u2013309 Citing Round, The Complete Peerage dismissed the alleged Despencer descent as an \"elaborate imposture\" which \"is now incapable of deceiving the most credulous.\"The Complete Peerage, vol. 4, p. 259.  See also the Nov. 1902 edition of The Ancestor Quarterly, which described the Spencers as \"that pushful house of shepherd kings\" with a \"brand new and more than doubtful pedigree.\"  Sounding a more gentle tone, Don Steel in the March 1996 edition of Soul Search noted sadly that the pedigree forgery \"obscures the real achievement of the Spencers of Althorpe. Alone, perhaps among the English nobility, the Spencers owed their riches and their rise not to the favour of a king or to the spoils of monasteries, nor even to a fortune made in trade, but to successful farming.\""]}, {"page": "John Russell, 1st Earl of Bedford", "response": ["* (Includes an early pedigree of the Earls of Bedford, and builds on J.

It seems likely that either a financial or military crisis dictated that the partly completed keep had to be made defensible. A Danish raid in support of the Revolt of the Earls in 1075 or the threatened invasion by Canute IV in 1085 have both have been suggested as possible causes. Another theory is that only a single-story structure was originally intended. The keep today has only two storeys; the original height is unknown because of demolition work carried out in the late 17th century. In 1882, J. Horace Round proposed that, like the White Tower, Colchester would have had four storeys, with a double-height great hall and chapel. This view was widely accepted throughout most of the 20th century. More recently, researchers have supported a three-storey model and some of the latest work suggests that there may have only ever been two storeys."]}, {"page": "Burke's Peerage", "response": ["In 1877, the Oxford professor Edward Augustus Freeman attacked the accuracy of Burke's and claimed that it contained pedigrees that were \"purely mythical \u2013 if indeed mythical is not too respectable a name for what must be in many cases the work of deliberate invention ....
