The Treatise includes images of siege weapons and what is probably the first illustration of a firearm: a pot-de-fer. One of the marginal border illustrations in the Milemete Treatise shows a soldier firing a large vase-shaped cannon, the arrow-shaped projectile is seen projecting from the cannon which is pointed at a fortification. In the 1331 siege of Cividale, German knights used guns which were probably very similar to Milemete weapons.The treatise includes an illustration of St. George giving Prince Edward a shield decorated with coat of arms. The manuscript, in a red velvet binding, is now held by the library of Christ Church, Oxford. The treatise also  depicts a group of knights flying a firebomb kite laden black-powder filled firebomb over the wall of city.\n\n", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Cannon", "response": ["There is a record of a gun in Europe dating to 1322 being discovered in the nineteenth century but the artifact has since been lost.

The 1320s seem to have been the takeoff point for guns in Europe according to most modern military historians. Scholars suggest that the lack of gunpowder weapons in a well-traveled Venetian's catalogue for a new crusade in 1321 implies that guns were unknown in Europe up until this point, further solidifying the 1320 mark, however more evidence in this area may be forthcoming in the future."]}, {"page": "Kite", "response": ["Walter de Milemete's 1326 De nobilitatibus, sapientiis, et prudentiis regum treatise depicts a group of knights flying kite laden with a black-powder filled firebomb over the wall of city.

Ian Mortimer has called the grant she received as amounting to \"one of the largest personal incomes anyone had ever received in English history\". Following Edward's coronation parliament was recalled. According to precedent, a new parliament should have been summoned with the accession of a new monarch, and this failure of process indicates the novelty of the situation.

However by the 9th century, when the first Western European reference to a mangana (mangonel) appeared, there is virtually no evidence at all, whether textual or artistic, of torsion engines used in warfare. The last historical texts specifying a torsion engine aside from the springald date no later than the 6th century. By the mid-10th century, Constantine VII's list of Byzantine artillery weapons and their descriptions contained only traction-powered machines. The exception to this dearth of textual evidence is an anonymous writer under the name of Heron of Byzantium, who repeats ancient descriptions of the onager. However the illustration shows only a traction trebuchet. Medieval illustrations of an onager do not appear until the 14-15th century. The earliest medieval depiction of an onager is from Walter de Milemete's De nobilitatibus, sapientiis, et prudentiis regum of 1326, the same source for Europe's earliest cannon. Michael S. Fulton notes that the engine appears oddly shaped, impractical, and likely based on classical descriptions. While definitions for artillery terms are hard to pin down, artistic evidence of traction trebuchets confirms that knowledge of them was widespread in comparison to torsion artillery."]}]}}
