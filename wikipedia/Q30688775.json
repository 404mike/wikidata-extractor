He became a music producer for the band in 2015 after several years of providing the voice of Russel Hobbs and was listed as an A&R producer alongside Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett in the 2019 documentary Gorillaz: Reject False Icons. In 2007, Kabaka created the audiovisual collective Gorillaz Sound System.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Gorillaz", "response": ["The band's third album, Plastic Beach (2010), featured environmentalist themes, an electropop approach and an expanded roster of featured artists. Their fourth album, The Fall (2010), was recorded on the road during the Escape to Plastic Beach Tour and released on 25 December 2010. During 2015, Remi Kabaka Jr. became a music producer for the band after more than 10 years providing the voice of Russel and was credited as such alongside Albarn and Hewlett in the official 2019 documentary Gorillaz: Reject False Icons. The band's fifth album, Humanz, was released after a seven-year hiatus on 28 April 2017. Their sixth album, The Now Now (2018), featured stripped-down production and a greater musical focus on Albarn. Gorillaz' latest project is Song Machine, a music-based web series with episodes that consist of standalone singles and accompanying music videos featuring different guests each episode, resulting in their seventh album, Song Machine, Season One: Strange Timez (2020).", "Recording sessions for the band's fifth studio album Humanz began in late 2015 and continued through 2016, taking place in London, New York City, Paris and Jamaica. Albarn enlisted American hip-hop and house producer Anthony Khan, known by his stage name the Twilite Tone, to co-produce the album. Albarn chose Khan from a list of possible producers compiled by Parlophone, the band's record label after Albarn and Khan spoke via Skype. Humanz was also co-produced by Remi Kabaka Jr., a friend of Albarn's who had worked with him in the non-profit musical organization Africa Express and also has been the voice actor for the Gorillaz virtual band member Russel Hobbs since 2000. In conceptualizing the album, Albarn and Khan envisioned Humanz as being the soundtrack for \"a party for the end of the world\", with Albarn specifically imagining a future in which Donald Trump won the 2016 U.S. presidential election as context for the album's narrative (Trump becoming president was still considered an unlikely event at the time of recording), explaining \"Let's use that as a kind of dark fantasy for this record, let's imagine the night Donald Trump wins the election and how we're all going to feel that night.\" Khan stated that \"The idea of Donald Trump being president allowed us to create a narrative together. I suggested that the album should be about joy, pain and urgency. That was to be our state of mind before we even touched a keyboard or an MPC. Especially in American music, dare I say black music, there's a way of communicating joy that at the same time allows you to feel the struggle the person has been through. And the urgency is there because something needs to be done. So that was the mantra. I wanted to blend Damon, a Briton, with the joy and pain and struggle that African-American music can express.\" Humanz again featured a large cast of featured artists, including Popcaan, Vince Staples, DRAM, Jehnny Beth, Pusha T, Peven Everett, Danny Brown, Grace Jones and Mavis Staples, among others. The first track from the album released publicly was \"Hallelujah Money\" featuring Benjamin Clementine, released on 20 January 2017 with an accompanying video featuring Clementine. While not an official single, Albarn explained that the band chose to release the track on the day of Trump's inauguration because \"It was meant to be something sung at the imaginary inauguration of Donald Trump, which turned out to be the real inauguration of Donald Trump, so we released it because we had imagined that happening and it did happen.\"", "* Remi Kabaka Jr.\u00a0\u2013 percussion", " bar:RK text:\"Remi Kabaka Jr\"", "* Remi Kabaka Jr.\u00a0\u2013 songwriting, production, percussion, drum programming (2015\u2013present)", "  bar:remi  text:Remi Kabaka Jr."]}, {"page": "Damon Albarn", "response": ["Albarn collaborated with producers Dan the Automator, XL Recordings, Richard Russell & Rodaidh McDonald, Jneiro Jarel, DJ Darren Cunningham aka Actress, Marc Antoine, Alwest, Remi Kabaka Jr., Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs and Kwes, Albarn went to Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo for one week to record an album, Kinshasa One Two, released in 2011.

He is referenced in the lyrics to the Gorillaz track \"Clint Eastwood\". He was originally loosely based on American rapper and actor Ice Cube (the cousin of rapper Del the Funky Homosapien, who raps on \"Clint Eastwood\" and \"Rock The House\" as Del the Ghost Rapper). Russel's speaking voice is provided by drummer and DJ Remi Kabaka Jr., who has been an actual drummer and producer for Gorillaz since Humanz in 2017. Russel's fictional backstory of being possessed by the spirits of dead musicians is what originally inspired the usage of collaborators and guests on Gorillaz' albums."]}]}}
