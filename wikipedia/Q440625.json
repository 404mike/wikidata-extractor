He was named captain of the England team on 4 October 2004, replacing Lawrence Dallaglio, who had resigned five weeks earlier. However, he was kept out of the 2004 autumn internationals by a haematoma in his upper right arm, the captaincy being taken over by Jason Robinson and then Martin Corry.

He was a blood replacement for clubmate Joe Worsley after 13 minutes and on 64 minutes was a replacement for Martin Corry, touching down with a clinically executed charge from the back of the scrum on 70 minutes.

In the Leicester Tigers youth team, he played flanker. He became the youngest Leicester Tigers' player to play a league game at 18 years and 94 days, a record now surpassed by Ben Youngs. He soon became established as Neil Back's understudy for the openside flanker shirt. Making the Tigers starting XV was difficult however, as internationals Neil Back and Martin Corry took two of the three starting positions, with Paul Gustard and Will Johnson (younger brother of Martin) fighting for the remaining place."]}, {"page": "2005 British & Irish Lions tour to New Zealand", "response": ["|Martin Corry", "Taranaki hosted the Lions at New Plymouth on 8 June. The first half was closely fought in more ways than one, as the Lions' Danny Grewcock and Taranaki's Paul Tito came to blows. The Amber-and-Blacks had a 7\u20136 lead at half-time, but soon after the break Martin Corry scored a try for the Lions. Shortly afterwards, Taranaki's Andrew Hore was sin-binned for holding the ball, and the Lions took control. Consensus man of the match Charlie Hodgson kicked two penalties during Hore's absence, and the Lions kept their momentum even after Hore returned. Shane Horgan added a try and Geordan Murphy two as the Lions won 36\u201314.", "The Lions scored their first convincing tour victory in this game at Palmerston North against NPC second division side Manawatu Turbos, winning 109\u20136. They led 38\u20136 at half time and scored 71 unanswered points in the second. Welshman Shane Williams scored five tries to help the Lions post their all-time record score in New Zealand, surpassing their 64\u20135 victory over Marlborough/Nelson 46 years earlier. In addition to Williams' five, the Lions' tries were scored by Ronan O'Gara (2), Mark Cueto (2), Geordan Murphy, Charlie Hodgson, Jason Robinson, Martin Corry, Neil Back, Gareth Cooper, Gordon D'Arcy and Ollie Smith, with Manawatu restricted to two Jonathan Hargreaves penalties. Lock Donncha O'Callaghan and flanker Martyn Williams were substituted at half-time but had impressed enough to secure Test selection for the following Saturday. Murphy also impressed at full-back, but it was Shane Williams, with elusive running and awareness, who most thrilled Lions supporters."]}, {"page": "Northumbria University", "response": ["* Martin Corry, England rugby international, and Leicester Tigers"]}]}}
