He is a member of the Cheshire County Football Association.\nHe began refereeing in the Football League in 1997 and was promoted in 2008 to the list of Select Group Referees who officiate all Premier League fixtures.

Heskey received a yellow card for his behaviour and had to be restrained by teammates such as Brad Friedel and captain Stiliyan Petrov. He played for the remainder of the half, but had to be restrained again in the tunnel at the interval. Caretaker manager Gary McAllister chose to substitute him for Marc Albrighton at half-time, and Heskey was not allowed to remain at the stadium for the rest of the match. Despite his outburst, Heskey received no punishment from either Villa or The Football Association.

On 3 May, the day before his 28th birthday, he won his first Premier League title at the ninth attempt, following a 1\u20130 home win over Crystal Palace. During the penultimate game of the season, away at The Hawthorns against West Bromwich Albion, F\u00e0bregas was shown the red card and booed off by fans for deliberately kicking the ball at Chris Brunt's head while players were speaking to referee Mike Jones.

Following West Ham's equaliser, Fuller argued with team-mate Andy Griffin, before slapping the Stoke captain's face. Referee Mike Jones gave Fuller a straight red for violent conduct and West Ham went on to win the match 2\u20131. Tony Pulis and Stoke teammate Danny Higginbotham commented that the incident would not affect the club. On 1 January 2009, Tony Pulis confirmed that Fuller and Griffin had \"kissed and made up\" after a team meeting. Fuller said Griffin had been \"very rude and disrespectful\", but accepted that his actions had been worse. In a match against Sunderland in February 2009 Fuller dislocated his shoulder and it was feared that he would be out injured for the rest of the season. However Fuller made a quick recover and was out for just two weeks. He bounced back with lively performances against Aston Villa and a goal against Bolton and continued his form to help Stoke to safety."]}, {"page": "Steve Harper", "response": ["In the summer before the 2012\u201313 season, Krul was given the number 1 shirt number, previously worn by Harper.

On 17 September 2012, in a match against Everton, Harper sportingly told referee Mike Jones not to book Victor Anichebe for a late challenge on Harper himself. On 22 March 2013, Newcastle announced that Harper will be leaving at the end of the 2012\u201313 season, thus ending his 20 years service at the club.

Following the match, his role as captain was praised by manager Alan Pardew, who wanted him to captain another match. On 12 January 2014, and with Newcastle trailing 1\u20130 at home to Manchester City, Tiot\u00e9 had a goal controversially disallowed, when referee Mike Jones ruled that Yoan Gouffran had blocked the goalkeeper's view from an offside position, and pundits criticised the decision to disallow the goal. Later that month, Cabaye left the club to join Paris Saint-Germain, thus disrupting the successful partnership between the two men. As a result, his form suffered, with replacement Dan Gosling not up to the preferred standard. However, Tiot\u00e9 was given the captain's armband in the absence of Coloccini, who had suffered a knee injury against West Bromwich Albion. By the end of the 2013\u201314 season, Tiot\u00e9 had made 36 appearances in all competitions."]}, {"page": "Sergio Ag\u00fcero", "response": ["Ag\u00fcero scored a hat-trick in City's 3\u20132 win over Bayern Munich in the Champions League group stage on 25 November, starting with a penalty which he won himself.

Consequently, the win put City top of the league on goal difference after being 8 points behind in the league in March. Only two wins against Newcastle United and Queens Park Rangers were required for City to win the league, which they subsequently achieved. City ultimately won the last six league matches to clinch the league title on goal difference \u2013 the first time a tie-breaker was used to decide the championship since 1988\u201389, and repeated the 1967\u201368 league season, when City pipped United to the title after both teams went into their final games level on points."]}, {"page": "Phil Dowd", "response": ["Dowd refereed the 2012 FA Cup Final between Chelsea and Liverpool, at Wembley Stadium on 5 May 2012.
