Kay composed the incidental music for three serials in the first season of Doctor Who, including the very first, An Unearthly Child, as well as The Keys of Marinus and The Sensorites.\nAfter leaving Doctor Who following its first season, Kay provided the incidental music for many of the Out of the Unknown stories during the rest of the 1960s, as well as composing the atmospheric theme tune of its first three seasons. Kay also provided music on productions such as Late Night Horror in 1968, as well as many other television productions. He also scored the 1968 comedy heist film Diamonds for Breakfast. Kay also worked as a music critic for The Daily Telegraph. He was the first British musician to write a study on Dmitri Shostakovich, a work that was well received.In 1969 Kay married Janice Willett, a former producer with ABC Television, and the couple had a daughter.

Many of the stories of the William Hartnell period were scored by electronic music pioneer Tristram Cary, whose Doctor Who credits include The Daleks, Marco Polo, The Daleks' Master Plan, The Gunfighters and The Mutants. Other composers in this early period included Richard Rodney Bennett, Carey Blyton and Geoffrey Burgon."]}, {"page": "Out of the Unknown", "response": ["A title for the series had not been decided when production began. Names including Dimension 4, The Edge of Tomorrow and From the Unknown were considered, before Out of the Unknown was settled upon. The title music was composed by Norman Kay and the title sequence was created by Bernard Lodge. It was intended from an early stage that, as with Boris Karloff on Out of this World, each story would be introduced by a regular host. Christopher Lee and Vincent Price were approached but were not available and the idea was dropped. The episode \"Some Lapse of Time\" is notable for having Ridley Scott, future director of such films as Alien and Blade Runner, as designer. The opening title sequence was designed by Bernard Lodge, utilising stock shots and specially created optical illusion patterns filmed on a rostrum camera, combined with a face frozen in a scream and a mannequin falling repeatedly through space contrived to create an eerie sense of suspense and intrigue. The forty-second sequence would win a Design & Art Direction Wood Pencil for Television Graphics in 1965."]}, {"page": "List of film score composers", "response": ["* Norman Kay (1929\u20132001)"]}, {"page": "Symphony No. 15 (Shostakovich)", "response": ["Upon hearing its first performance, Shostakovich remarked that he had composed a \"wicked symphony.\" It was received with an ovation by the audience at its premiere. Among its admirers was his friend Marietta Shaginyan, who after the first performance made the sign of the cross over him and exclaimed: \"You must not say, Dmitri Dmitrievich, that you are not well. You are well, because you have made us happy!\" Tikhon Khrennikov praised the symphony as one of Shostakovich's \"most profound,\" adding that it was \"full of optimism [and] belief in man's inexhaustible strength.\" The first movement drew especial praise from Norman Kay in England, who called it a \"tour-de-force of concentration, self-dissolution, and musical economy.\" Eric Roseberry noted that the symphony's instrumental timbres and use of passacaglia suggested that Shostakovich had been influenced by the late operas of his friend, Benjamin Britten.

The score, performed by seven musicians, was recorded in Maida Vale Studio on 7 March 1964; several standard instruments were used, including a clarinet, bass clarinet, double bass, guitar, flute, harp, piccolo, trumpet and percussion. Nineteen new sound effects were recorded for the serial by Brian Hodgson of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, including the sounds of the Conscience of Marinus and the clocks in Millennius. Raymond Cusick, Daphne Dare and Jill Summers were commissioned as the designers for the serial. Dare based the design of the Voord on a rubber wetsuit, while the heads were created using vulcanised rubber by prop builders Jack and John Lovell. The submersible props and the Conscience machine were designed by Shawcraft Models. Cusick used leftover fibreglass to complete the design of the Conscience machine, as the budget was running low. The moving vegetation in the third episode was constructed by Design and Display Ltd. Jablite polystyrene was used to stimulate snow in the third and fourth episodes.
