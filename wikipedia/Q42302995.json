Early Nurserymen. Phillimore, Chichester, UK. though an account of trees growing at Mamhead by Pince (grandson of Lucombe) in 1835 makes no mention of U. laevis nor of any other elms. None of Lucombe's early catalogues are known to survive, and thus the introduction of U. laevis through south Devon cannot be confirmed. However, the tree does not feature in any of the surviving arboreta accessions lists, or catalogues of the larger, nationally famous, nurseries of the day, and its earliest-known mention in commerce remains in the south-west, in the catalogue of the Ford & Please nursery (as U. pedunculata) at Exeter circa 1836. James Main mentions the tree as 'a native of Hungary' and in 1838 only to be met in 'ornamental plantations', but by 1846 was 'becoming available in (UK) nurseries'."]}, {"page": "George Hibbert", "response": ["Hibbert funded various botanical expeditions, notably that of James Niven, an avid gardener and collector of plants, who was sent to the Cape region of South Africa in 1798.
