An intense diplomatic activity has been reported between Borno and the Pachalik of Tripoli at that time. About two million slaves traveled this route to be traded in Tripoli, the largest slave market in the Mediterranean.

Regarding his austere, weather-beaten face, greying hair and simple Dopper dress of a short-cut black jacket, baggy trousers and a black top hat, they considered him extremely ugly. Furthermore, they found his personal habits, such as copious spitting, revolting. Shepstone's legal adviser William Morcom was one of the first British officials to write about Kruger: calling him \"gigantically horrible\", he recounted a public luncheon at which Kruger dined with a dirty pipe protruding from his pocket and such greasy hair that he spent part of the meal combing it. According to Martin Meredith, Kruger's unsightliness was mentioned in British reports \"so often that it became shorthand for his whole personality, and indeed, his objectives\". They did not consider him a major threat to British ambitions."]}, {"page": "Sara Forbes Bonetta", "response": ["In 1848, Oke-Odan was invaded and captured by the army of Dahomey. Aina's parents died during the attack and other residents were either killed or sold into the Atlantic slave trade. Aina ended up in the court of King Ghezo of Dahomey as a young child slave. Dahomey was a major West African power that immensely profited from the Atlantic slave trade. After the British abolition of slavery, King Ghezo fought against British attempts to curtail Dahomey's exportation of slaves. Biographer and historian of Africa Martin Meredith quotes King Ghezo telling the British, \"The slave trade has been the ruling principle of my people. It is the source of their glory and wealth.  Their songs celebrate their victories and the mother lulls the child to sleep with notes of triumph over an enemy reduced to slavery.\""]}, {"page": "Ian Smith", "response": ["The new Zimbabwean parliament opened on 15 May 1980, a month after formal independence from Britain, with Smith as the reconstituted country's first Leader of the Opposition. Continuing a long-standing tradition from the Rhodesian era, the government and opposition entered the House in pairs\u2014Mugabe and Smith walked in side by side with their respective MPs following, \"aptly symbolis[ing] the mood of reconciliation\", Martin Meredith comments. With around 1,000 whites leaving Zimbabwe each month, Smith took to the radio to urge them to stay and give Mugabe's new order a chance, but over half of the country's whites left within three years. As Meredith records, the 100,000 or so who remained \"retreated into their own world of clubs, sporting activities, and comfortable living\". Mugabe made great efforts when he first took power to endear himself to the white farming community, which accounted for at least 75% of Zimbabwe's agricultural output. Amid booming Zimbabwean commodity prices in the years immediately following 1980, many white commercial farmers came to support Mugabe. The new Prime Minister continued cordially meeting Smith until the RF leader took him to task in 1981 for openly calling for a one-party state; Smith said this was putting off foreign investors. Mugabe was not impressed and, according to Smith, refused to ever meet him again."]}, {"page": "Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon", "response": ["According to historian Martin Meredith, Lord Carnarvon was primarily concerned with \"imperial defence\", and \"regarded the Cape and its naval facilities  at Simon's Bay as being the most important link in the imperial network\". He thus decided to force the pace, \"endeavouring to give South Africa not what it wanted, but what he considered it ought to want.\" He sent colonial administrators such as Theophilus Shepstone and Henry Bartle Frere to southern Africa to implement his system of confederation. Shepstone occupied and annexed the Transvaal in 1877, while Bartle Frere, as the new High Commissioner, led imperial troops against the last group of independent Xhosa in the Ninth Frontier War. Carnarvon then used the rising unrest to suspend the Natal constitution, while Bartle Frere overthrew the elected Cape government, and then moved to invade the independent Zulu Kingdom."]}, {"page": "Slave Trade Act 1807", "response": ["As British historian Martin Meredith writes, \"In the decade between 1791 and 1800, British ships made about 1,340 voyages across the Atlantic, landing nearly 400,000 slaves.  Between 1801 and 1807, they took a further 266,000.  The slave trade remained one of Britain's most profitable businesses.\""]}, {"page": "Mero\u00eb", "response": ["Martin Meredith states the Kushite rulers chose Mero\u00eb, between the Fifth and Sixth Cataracts, because it was on the fringe of the summer rainfall belt, and the area was rich in iron ore and hardwood for iron working. The location also afforded access to trade routes to the Red Sea. The city of Mero\u00eb was located along the middle Nile which is of much importance due to the annual flooding of the Nile river valley and the connection to many major river systems such as the Niger which aided with the production of pottery and iron characteristic to the Meroitic kingdom that allowed for the rise in power of its people. According to partially deciphered Meroitic texts, the name of the city was Medewi or Bedewi."]}, {"page": "Bambouk", "response": ["According to Martin Meredith, the Carthaginians used Berber nomads to establish a packhorse trade route across the Sahara between Lixus and \"the goldfields of Bambuk in the Senegal River valley.\""]}, {"page": "Judar Pasha", "response": ["According to Martin Meredith: \"To quell resistance in Timbuktu, the Moroccans sent leading scholars to Marrakesh in chains.

The entire family of a dead matriarch, including her young calf, were all gently touching her body with their trunks, trying to lift her. The elephant herd were all rumbling loudly. The calf was observed to be weeping and made sounds that sounded like a scream, but then the entire herd fell silent. They then began to throw leaves and dirt over the body and broke off tree branches to cover her. They spent the next two days quietly standing over her body. They sometimes left to get water or food, but they would always return."]}, {"page": "Republic of Dahomey", "response": ["The Republic of Dahomey became independent of France on 1 August 1960. In the words of the historian Martin Meredith, the young country \"was encumbered with every imaginable difficulty: a small strip of territory jutting inland from the coast, it was crowded, insolvent and beset by tribal divisions, huge debts, unemployment, frequent strikes and an unending struggle for power between three rival political leaders\". These rivals were Justin Ahomad\u00e9gb\u00e9-Tom\u00eatin, who held sway in the southern and central regions of the country, Sourou-Migan Apithy, who dominated the southeast, and Hubert Maga, whose power base was located in the north."]}, {"page": "Robert Mugabe", "response": ["Margaret Thatcher's UK government was aware of the killings but remained silent on the matter, cautious not to anger Mugabe and threaten the safety of white Zimbabweans. The United States also did not raise strong objections, with President Ronald Reagan welcoming Mugabe to the White House in September 1983. In October 1983, Mugabe attended the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in New Delhi, where no participating states mentioned the Gukurahundi. In 2000, Mugabe acknowledged that the mass killings had happened, stating that it was \"an act of madness\u00a0... it was wrong and both sides were to blame\". His biographer Martin Meredith argued that Mugabe and his ZANU\u2013PF were solely to blame for the massacres. Various Mugabe biographers have seen the Gukurahundi as a deliberate attempt to eliminate ZAPU and its support base to advance his desire for a ZANU\u2013PF one-party state.", "During the 1980s, Mugabe indicated his desire to transform Zimbabwe from a multi-party state into a one-party state. In 1984 he stated that \"the one-party state is more in keeping with African tradition. It makes for greater unity for the people. It puts all opinions under one umbrella, whether these opinions are radical or reactionary\". The political scientist Sue Onslow and historian Sean Redding stated that Zimbabwe's situation was \"more complex than pure venial dictatorship\", but that it was an \"ideo-dictatorship\". Mugabe openly admired Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu of Romania, praising him just before he was overthrown in December 1989.Martin Meredith, PublicAffairs, Feb 20, 2002, Mugabe Power And Plunder In Zimbabwe, p. 95"]}, {"page": "Nelson Mandela", "response": ["Mandela was very self-conscious about being a man and regularly made references to manhood. He was heterosexual, and biographer Fatima Meer said that he was \"easily tempted\" by women. Another biographer, Martin Meredith, characterised him as being \"by nature a romantic\", highlighting that he had relationships with various women. Mandela was married three times, fathered six children, and had seventeen grandchildren and at least seventeen great-grandchildren. He could be stern and demanding of his children, although he was more affectionate with his grandchildren. His first marriage was to Evelyn Ntoko Mase in October 1944; they divorced in March 1958 under the multiple strains of his adultery and constant absences, devotion to revolutionary agitation, and the fact that she was a Jehovah's Witness, a religion requiring political neutrality. Mandela's second wife was the social worker Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, whom he married in June 1958. They divorced in March 1996. Mandela married his third wife, Gra\u00e7a Machel, on his 80th birthday in July 1998.", "The first biography of Mandela was authored by Mary Benson, based on brief interviews with him that she had conducted in the 1960s. Two authorised biographies were later produced by friends of Mandela. The first was Fatima Meer's Higher Than Hope, which was heavily influenced by Winnie and thus placed great emphasis on Mandela's family. The second was Anthony Sampson's Mandela, published in 1999. Other biographies included Martin Meredith's Mandela, first published in 1997, and Tom Lodge's Mandela, brought out in 2006."]}, {"page": "Kingdom of Kush", "response": ["Kushite civilization continued for several centuries.

Martin Meredith states the Kushite rulers chose Mero\u00eb, between the Fifth and Sixth Cataracts, because it was on the fringe of the summer rainfall belt, and the area was rich in iron ore and hardwood for iron working. The location also afforded access to trade routes to the Red Sea. The Kush traded iron products with the Romans, in addition to gold, ivory and slaves. Yet, the Butana plain was stripped of its forests, leaving behind slag piles."]}, {"page": "Tidiani (Jeff) Tall", "response": ["Martin Meredith, historian and journalist, provides a controversial Western viewpoint on fifty years of African independence, and the many failures that have accompanied it, in the book The Fate of Africa: A History of Fifty Years of Independence."]}, {"page": "Lumpenproletariat", "response": ["Fanon's use of the term prompted debates and studies, including by Pierre Bourdieu and Charles van Onselen.

He implied that these accusations were untrue. This account, written shortly after his release from a 27-year imprisonment but before his election as President of South Africa, may have aimed to avoid damaging his heroic reputation. Later biographers highlighted further evidence that suggested Mase's accusation of adultery was correct; Mandela admitted to fellow activist Mac Maharaj that during the early 1950s he had led \"a thoroughly immoral life\". Several biographers, including David James Smith and Martin Meredith, argued that while married to Mase, Mandela was having affairs with both his secretary, Ruth Mompati, and with the ANC activist Lillian Ngoyi. At one point, Mase warned Mandela that if he ever brought Mompati back to their house again she would pour boiling water over her. There were rumours among those close to Mandela that Mompati bore him a child; Smith believed that Mompati's son, Mompati Neo Matsuone, who was born in April 1955, was Mandela's. Mase told Walter Sisulu about the affairs; this angered Mandela, who did not want news of his infidelity shared with others. Nosekeni disapproved of her son's behaviour and because of this, Smith argued, she returned to the Transkei.

The official count released at the time was 260, but historians place the number higher; Martin Meredith records \"more than 300\" dead, while Alexandre Binda writes that the Zimbabwe National Army units alone killed over 400 guerrillas. The Zimbabwe National Army reported no fatal casualties. Hill and Husher were each awarded the Bronze Cross of Zimbabwe for their part in putting down the rebellion, while Dyck received the Silver Cross. In his history of the Rhodesian African Rifles, Binda describes Entumbane as the regiment's greatest victory, commenting that it was won \"by dint of professionalism, discipline and determination\" in the face of forces that were far larger numerically. Major Michael P Stewart of the United States Army writes that 1RAR's actions at Entumbane \"saved Mugabe's Government from certain civil war\", and provided the \"final blow to the military might of ZIPRA\". A number of analysts comment on the irony that Mugabe and ZANU\u2013PF, who had spent years fighting white rule and the Rhodesian forces during the 1970s, were secured in power barely a year after the Bush War's end by ex-Rhodesian troops under white command. Binda furthermore highlights the irony that the RAR's finest hour (in his view) came while fighting for Mugabe."]}]}}
