Other previous collaborators were slated to work on Dune but dropped out before production began, including visual effects supervisor John Nelson and cinematographer Roger Deakins, who was replaced in December 2018 with Greig Fraser.", "More than two thousand visual effect shots were created for the film. These shots used a chroma key process that visual effects supervisor Paul Lambert called \"sandscreen\"; instead of using green-based backgrounds, the visual effects team used brown-colored ones that matched the establishing desert shots intended for backgrounds. The resulting shots appear more natural than with other chroma keys. The sandworms were created through computer-generated imagery, with an original design considered \"prehistoric\" by Lambert, inspired by whales with a mouth filled with baleen and following the underwater movements of whales. While they had considered using rigged explosives to capture the motion of the sandworms breaking the surface in the desert, this would have been impractical in the Middle East, and instead used Houdini software to have sand mimic the motion of water. Villeneuve did not want the sound associated with these special effects to sound as a studio production, and sound designers Mark Mangini and Theo Green used a \"fake documentary realism\" approach to capture natural sounds and manipulate them for use in the film, such as recording the sounds of shifting sands in Death Valley using hydrophones.", "| Theo Green, Dave Whitehead", "| Mac Ruth, Mark Mangini, Theo Green, Doug Hemphill, Ron Bartlett", "| Theo Green, Mark Mangini, Dave Whitehead, Phil Barrie, Lee Gilmore, Greg Ten Bosch, Robert Kellough, Piero Mura, Christopher Bonis, Andy Malcolm, Goro Koyama, Sandra Fox", "| , Mark A.
