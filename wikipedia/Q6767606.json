Roger Ebert gave the film 2 stars out of 4, writing that there were \"some funny lines, and the relationship between the human kid and his best pal the vampire is handled with a lot of original twists. But the movie finally descends, as so many films do these days, to one of those assembly-line endings made up of fights and chases.\" D. J. R. Bruckner of The New York Times called the writing and direction \"weak\" and the story \"so confused, that 'Vamp' often seems as silly as the films it tries to ridicule.\" A positive review in Variety praised the film as \"extremely imaginative\" with a \"very good\" cast, and referred to Grace Jones' dance number as \"an outr\u00e9 showstopper.\" Patrick Goldstein of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \"Despite a few delightfully grim comic touches, 'Vamp' never really captures the spirit of light-headed horror needed to propel this kind of macabre mayhem. Writer-director Richard Wenk has a real flair for offbeat humor ... but we find ourselves much more enchanted by the film's kooky peripheral characters than by its plodding storyline.\"Goldstein, Patrick (July 18, 1986). \"Anemic 'Vamp' But Hot-Blooded Cast\". Los Angeles Times. Part VI, p. 6. Paul Attanasio of The Washington Post panned the film as \"stupid and crude.\" Sid Smith of the Chicago Tribune gave the film 1.5 stars out of 4, writing that \"the laughs are strained, and many of the effects are ludicrous. The filmmakers couldn't come up with enough good plot and dialogue to fill in the gaps between their little satirical stabs.\"Smith, Sid (July 18, 1986). \"Grace Jones is the chief victim as 'Vamp' tries to spoof vampires\". Chicago Tribune. 7A. A review by Mark Finch in The Monthly Film Bulletin was generally positive, finding that although the concept of a club where the strippers possess authority could have been explored more, \"the film remains confident and agreeably scary without becoming lost in a swamp of movie-buff jokes or out-and-out campiness.\""]}, {"page": "The Joy of Life", "response": ["The two stories are punctuated by Lawrence Ferlinghetti's reading of his ode to San Francisco, \"The Changing Light\", and bookended by opening and closing credits music from legendary 1950s icon (and probable Golden Gate suicide) Weldon Kees.

In 1986, while still a student, Olson co-founded the Minneapolis/St.Paul Lesbian, Gay, Bi & Transgender Film Festival, initially under the name Lavender Images.  Olson was inspired in this move by Vito Russo's book, The Celluloid Closet. In 1992 Olson was hired by the company Frameline and moved to San Francisco to work as guest curator on the San Francisco International Lesbian and Gay Film Festival, before being appointed co-director alongside Mark Finch.  After three years Olson left this position to co-found the website PlanetOut.com. Olson worked as director of entertainment and e-commerce for the site, as well fulfilling the same roles for Gay.com. She created the PopcornQ section of the PlanetOut.com website, basing the section on her book The Ultimate Guide to Lesbian & Gay Film and Video.", "In 2005 Olson released The Joy of Life, her debut feature, which won Best Outstanding Artistic Achievement at the 2005 Outfest and at the 2005 Newfest received Best U.S. Narrative Screenplay, and has been favorably reviewed in a number of publications. It garnered Olson the Marlon Riggs Award by the San Francisco Film Critics Circle in 2005. Working on the film led Olson to pen an open letter to the San Francisco Chronicle on the matter of the Golden Gate Bridge's position as the top suicide landmark in the world. Her former colleague, Mark Finch, had jumped from the bridge on January 14, 1995, and Olson used this event to inform her own film. Her letter was published on the tenth anniversary of Finch's death and supported the Psychiatric Foundation of Northern California's launching of a campaign for a barrier to be installed on the bridge.  Olson also distributed her film to the bridge's board of directors, noting \"several of the bridge directors told me they appreciated seeing the film and found it illuminating\", and in March 2005 the board voted to explore the installation of a barrier to prevent jumping."]}, {"page": "The Living End (film)", "response": ["* Mark Finch as Doctor"]}, {"page": "Finch (surname)", "response": ["* Mark Finch (1961\u20131995), English promoter of LGBT cinema"]}, {"page": "British Amateur Press Association (comics)", "response": ["Notable members of this association included Eddie Campbell, Mark Finch, John Freeman, Steve Green, artist Nigel Kitching, Martin Lock, Andy Roberts, Martin Skidmore (later publisher of Fantasy Advertiser and then editor of Trident Comics), and artist Steve Whitaker."]}, {"page": "List of LGBT-related films of 1992", "response": ["| ||  || United States || Comedy, drama || Mike Dytri, Craig Gilmore, Mark Finch, Mary Woronov, Johanna Went, Darcy Marta, Scot Goetz, Bretton Vail, Nicole Dillenberg, Stephen Holman, Magie Song, Peter Lanigan, Jon Gerrans, Jack Kofman, Chris Mabli, Michael Now, Michael Haynes, Peter Grame, Jordan Beswick, Paul Bartel, Craig Lee and Torie Chickering ||"]}, {"page": "Nichola Bruce", "response": ["Bruce's 1985 short horror/drama Wings of Death (BFI) which she co-directed with Mike Coulson, featuring Dexter Fletcher and Kate Hardie, explored addiction.
