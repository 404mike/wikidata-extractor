He was born in St Pancras, London, the son of Henry Latham, a Chancery registrar, and died at Folkestone, Kent.As a cricketer, Latham was a middle-order right-handed batsman. After non-first-class trials matches in 1872, he played fairly regularly in first-team matches for Cambridge University in 1873, and he was picked for the University Match against Oxford University, in which he scored 0 and 48 in a match that Cambridge lost narrowly. The 48 was Latham's highest score in first-class cricket. In 1874 he played for MCC against Cambridge University in the university's match immediately before the University Match, and then was picked for his second game against Oxford; this time, he was less successful with innings of 1 and 4, and Cambridge lost the game by an innings. It was Latham's last appearance in first-class cricket, though he appeared in minor matches for amateur teams to the mid 1880s.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Latham (surname)", "response": ["* Thomas Latham (cricketer) (1847\u20131926), English barrister and cricketer"]}, {"page": "Robert Lyttelton", "response": ["He made his debut in first-class cricket in 1873 for an \"England XI\", batting at number ten in the first innings, in which he scored two runs, and opening the batting in the second innings, remaining not out with three runs when his team achieved victory; fellow opener Charles Thornton scored 27 runs in the innings. He played in two further first-class matches that year, all in May and all against Cambridge; in the third match, once again representing an \"England XI\", he claimed his solitary wicket in first-class cricket, dismissing Thomas Latham bowled. Lyttelton reached his highest score in first-class matches the following year for the same side, scoring 27 runs while batting at number ten (in a twelve-per-side contest). He did not appear in first-class cricket in 1875, but returned to Cambridge in 1876, the year after his graduation, to appear for the Gentlemen of England. Playing for the Cambridge side in that match were two of his brothers, Edward and Alfred. The Gentlemen won the match by three wickets, but Edward and Alfred outperformed their brother, who did not bowl, and scored one run in his only batting innings. The Times said of him, \"'Bob' Lyttelton, though not famous as a cricketer like some of his brothers owing to a certain slowness of foot, was a close student and an able critic of the game\"."]}, {"page": "Thomas Latham", "response": ["*Thomas Latham (cricketer) (1847\u20131926), English barrister and cricketer", "*Thomas Latham (MP) for Westminster (UK Parliament constituency) in 1654"]}, {"page": "List of Marylebone Cricket Club players (1864\u20131894)", "response": ["* Thomas Latham (1874) : T.
