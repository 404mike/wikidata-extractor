He was born in St Pancras, London, the son of Henry Latham, a Chancery registrar, and died at Folkestone, Kent.As a cricketer, Latham was a middle-order right-handed batsman. After non-first-class trials matches in 1872, he played fairly regularly in first-team matches for Cambridge University in 1873, and he was picked for the University Match against Oxford University, in which he scored 0 and 48 in a match that Cambridge lost narrowly. The 48 was Latham's highest score in first-class cricket. In 1874 he played for MCC against Cambridge University in the university's match immediately before the University Match, and then was picked for his second game against Oxford; this time, he was less successful with innings of 1 and 4, and Cambridge lost the game by an innings. It was Latham's last appearance in first-class cricket, though he appeared in minor matches for amateur teams to the mid 1880s.", "link_mentions": {}}}
