William Tuke noted that \"All men seem to desert me.\" However, it became a model around the world for more humane and psychologically based approaches. The work was taken on by other Quakers, including Tuke's son Henry Tuke who co-founded The Retreat, and Samuel Tuke who helped popularise the approach which convince physicians to adopt it in his 1813, book Description of The Retreat near York. His book explained in detail about the approach to use the moral treatment method for restoring the self-esteem, and self-control in individual with mental issues. In doing so, Samuel Tuke popularised his use of the term moral treatment that he had borrowed from the French \"traitement moral\" being used to describe the work of Pussin and Pinel in France (and in the original French referring to morale in the sense of the emotions and self-esteem, rather than rights and wrongs). The term came to refer to a number of moves towards more humane approaches that occurred toward the end of the 18th century in the context of Enlightenment thinking, including also the work of Vincenzo Chiarugi in Italy. Ideas of \"moral\" management were incorporated, and used for various therapeutic and custodial purposes, in asylums and therapeutic communities around the world."]}, {"page": "Tuke family", "response": ["*Henry Tuke (1755-1814)"]}, {"page": "List of people from York", "response": ["*Henry Tuke (1755\u20131814), social campaigner"]}, {"page": "Christian Observer", "response": ["Contributors included Thomas Babington, the clergyman and theological writer Charles Smith Bird (1795\u20131862), the lay theological writer John Bowdler (1783\u20131815), the writer on prophecy William Cuninghame of Lainshaw (c. 1775-1849), the clergyman William Dealtry (1775\u20131847), the clergyman and biblical scholar George Smith Drew (1819\u20131880), John Shore, 1st Baron Teignmouth, Henry Thornton, Henry Tuke, John Venn (1759\u20131813), and Daniel Wilson."]}, {"page": "Religion in York", "response": ["York has a long association with the Religious Society of Friends, known as the Quakers, and founded two schools in the city Bootham School in 1823 and The Mount in 1831.

Its founding premise was to allow the founding artists to exhibit their own works and to exclude those that were deemed not to their taste. The association held an Annual Exhibition in 1886, a riposte to the annual exhibitions of the Royal Academy of Arts that was passively rejecting works by younger artists. Amongst the founding members who exhibited were future stalwarts of the establishment including: Stanhope Forbes, Elisabeth Forbes, Henry Tuke, Steer and Osborne and in 1888 they were joined by Walter Sickert. Stott exhibited two rural scenes at the 1887 New English Art Club exhibition including The Ferry Boat (1887) a painting set in Winchelsea, East Sussex and described by Stott's biographer Valerie Webb as \u2018an early consummate work\u2019.Valerie Webb (2018), Edward Stott (1855 \u2013 1918): A Master of Colour and Atmosphere, page 47, Sansom & Company, Bristol, England.  Stott showed at least twenty works at the New English Art Club between 1888 and 1895, the majority of which are missing. A major work by Stott, On a Summer\u2019s Evening (1892), represents his continuing fascination with the tonal differences of light and shade. The NEAC still exists but within a few years of its founding its Avant-garde mission had given way to more reactionary forces akin to that of the Royal Academy."]}]}}
