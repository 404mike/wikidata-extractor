According to Marco Deseriis, the main purpose of the LBP was to create \"a folk hero of the information society\" whereby knowledge workers and immaterial workers could organize and recognize themselves.Marco Deseriis, \"'Lots of Money Because I am Many:' The Luther Blissett Project and the Multiple-Use Name Strategy\", cit.. p. 70.

Drawing from the work of Italian Workerists, such as Antonio Negri, Paolo Virno, Maurizio Lazzarato and others, the activists of the LBP envisioned Blissett as the expression of the capacity of immaterial workers to produce forms of wealth that cannot be properly measured and attributed to an individual producer. The incalculability of these new forms of labor is articulated in the \"Declaration of Rights of Luther Blissett\", redacted by the Roman LBP in 1995.

In September 1994, a Bolognese community radio began broadcasting Radio Blissett, a late-night show featuring a variable number of Luther Blissetts who \"patrolled\" the city on foot and called the studio from local phone booths. Inspired by the Lettrist-Situationist urban drift or d\u00e9rive\u2014a seemingly aimless wandering through the city whereby psychogeographers go in search of heightened emotional experiences\u2014Radio Blissett allowed players to interact at a distance in real time.

However, Swansea's successive story was short-lived, and their second season among the elite ended in relegation, and by 1986 they were back in the Fourth Division, having narrowly avoided going out of business. In 1982, Watford reached the First Division under the chairmanship of Elton John, management of Graham Taylor, and with the scoring prowess of Luther Blissett and John Barnes in attack. They finished runners-up in the league in their first top division season and were FA Cup runners-up in their second, and survived in the First Division until 1988.
