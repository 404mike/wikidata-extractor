He won 6 caps for England between 1934 and 1937. His younger brother, George, was also a professional footballer and spent his entire career with Burnley.He played for Manchester Central, before spending 1929 to 1938 with Manchester City, winning an FA Cup runner-up medal in 1933 and a winners medal in 1934, before helping the club to the First Division title in 1936\u201337. He guested for numerous clubs during World War II, and briefly managed Watford in the 1947\u201348 season.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Matt Busby", "response": ["During the 1930\u201331 season, City manager Peter Hodge decided that Busby's talents could be better exploited from the half-back line, with Busby playing the right-half role. In his new position, Busby built up a reputation as an intelligent player and a finer passer of the ball. In 1930, Manchester United made an enquiry about signing Busby from their cross-town rivals, but they were unable to afford the \u00a3150 fee that City demanded. By the 1931\u201332 season, Busby was firmly established in the first team, missing just one match that season. Indeed, Busby and Jackie Bray became such fixtures at wing-half that club captain Jimmy McMullan had to move to forward to keep his place in the team. In the 1930s Manchester City performed strongly in the FA Cup. They reached the semi-finals in 1932, and the final in 1933 before finally winning the tournament in 1934. However, from the second half of the 1934\u201335 season, Busby's number 4 jersey was worn by Jack Percival with increasing regularity, and Busby was sold to Liverpool for \u00a38,000 on 12 March 1936, having made more than 200 appearances for Manchester City."]}, {"page": "Oswaldtwistle", "response": ["* Jackie Bray, England international footballer, born in Oswaldtwistle"]}, {"page": "John Bray", "response": ["*Jackie Bray (1909\u20131982), English footballer and manager"]}, {"page": "Eric Brook", "response": ["In the 1934 FA Cup Final Brook set up the winning goal, which was scored by his friend Fred Tilson, to earn City a 2\u20131 victory over Portsmouth. City had defeated Blackburn Rovers 3-1 in the third round of that years FA Cup with the 'penetrative raiding and deadly shooting' of Brook (who scored once) and Toseland (who scored twice) key to victory. City defeated Hull City, Sheffield Wednesday and Stoke City in subsequent rounds to reach the final. Brook scored a 'wonder goal' in front of a record crowd of 84,569 against Stoke City in the sixth round of that year's competition. According to Gary James, 'many fans from the 1930s claimed it was the greatest City goal ever scored at Maine Road'. Brook had made 'a speculative lob' from the wing, which seemed to change direction in mid-flight, which curled past Stoke goalkeeper Roy John. Some claimed that Brook's lob was a cross, but those who knew Brook said it was the type of unconventional thing he would try. The FA Cup winning City team included goalkeeper Frank Swift and left half Jackie Bray, who would both emulate Brook by going on to appear for England. Swift fainted from nervous exhaustion just before the City team were about to ascend the steps at Wembley to collect the trophy and their winners medals. Swift elicited no sympathy from Brook who reportedly ordered him to 'Get up! There's a hundred thousand people here, we've just won the cup and you're making us look fools'. Arsenal defeated City to win the 1934 FA Charity Shield.", "In the 1935 British Home Championship Brook scored once and Tilson scored twice for England in a 4\u20130 victory against Wales at Ninian Park. England won the Home Championship that year despite suffering a 2\u20130 defeat against Scotland. Brook was one of three City players who appeared for England against Wales and then Ireland, the other two being Jackie Bray and Fred Tilson. This would not occur again until 1972 when Colin Bell, Francis Lee and Rodney Marsh all played for England against West Germany. The record was surpassed in 2010 when six Manchester City players (Joe Hart, Joleon Lescott, Gareth Barry, James Milner, Shaun Wright-Phillips and Adam Johnson) appeared in a 3\u20131 victory against Switzerland. Brook also scored for the Rest of England in a trial match against the national team in March 1935."]}, {"page": "List of Manchester City F.C. players", "response": ["|align=\"left\"|Jackie Bray||  || Half back || 1929\u20131940||279||10|| ||"]}, {"page": "1934 FA Cup Final", "response": ["In the days leading up to the match, Manchester City stayed in a hotel in Southport.Maddox, Saffer and Robinson, Manchester City Cup Kings 1956, p. 16.
