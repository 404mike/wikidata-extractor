He made over 190 appearances for Hamilton before joining Wigan Athletic in July 2010. McArthur helped Wigan win the FA Cup in 2013.

He briefly captained Scotland when a substitution took place in a 3\u20130 win against the Faroe Islands on 16 November 2010. His twelfth and final full cap came against Northern Ireland in the 2011 Nations Cup. In total, Caldwell won twelve caps for Scotland at senior international level. Reflecting on his time at the national side, he said: \"I think I was unlucky at times with Scotland. I think there was a certain snobbery about playing in Scotland at the time. Guys who played with Scottish clubs got caps that I was better than. I sit here and I'm bloody proud of those 12 caps I won. I'm especially proud and will be forever proud of the three or four I played with my brother. I can't ever really get across what that feels like, what that means for me, for him, for the two of us. It's one of my greatest achievements in football. I got two late Scotland caps when I was playing for Wigan and I'm really, really proud of those. I felt like it was the start of this era that we're in now. We had these young guys coming through \u2013 Steven Naismith, James Morrison, James McArthur. Kenny Miller was captain in that last game [against Northern Ireland in Dublin in 2011] and as he went off, he gave me the armband. It was another honour. Whatever the game, to have worn the Scottish armband, that was an incredible feeling.\""]}, {"page": "Juli\u00e1n Speroni", "response": ["Despite being told by manager Pulis that he would not be Crystal Palace's first choice goalkeeper, Speroni, nevertheless, continued to remain the first choice following the departure of Pulis at the start of the 2014\u201315 season. In a match against Burnley on 13 September 2014, he saved a penalty from Scott Arfield, as the club drew 0\u20130. After the match, his performance was praised by the returning manager Neil Warnock, saying: \"I think they broke the mould with him. Speroni is just a one-off but he does that every week and that's why he's been here so long with us. Speroni is a gem of a person.\" During a 2\u20132 draw against West Bromwich Albion on 25 October 2014. Speroni was substituted in the 55th minute after he took a blow to the face from Craig Dawson's arm. After the match, manager Warnock questioned the official's failure to take action against Dawson, calling it \"an assault almost\" and that Speroni could have been injured. But he made his recovery and returned to the starting line\u2013up against Sunderland, as Crystal Palace lost 3\u20131 on 3 November 2014. Speroni then made his 347th league appearance for Crystal Palace, breaking John Jackson's record as the team's goalkeeper with the most league appearances, against Arsenal on 21 February 2015, losing 2\u20131. During a 2\u20131 win against Stoke City on 21 March 2015, he made an impressive display by making impressive saves and was praised by his teammate, James McArthur. However, Speroni uncharacteristically had an inconsistent season could be due to a lack of rotation and even a sense of being too comfortable in the number one spot. Despite being dropped to the substitute bench for the last two remaining matches of the 2014\u201315 season, he went on to make thirty\u2013seven appearances in all competitions. On 22 May 2015, Speroni signed a one-year contract extension at Crystal Palace to keep him at the club until at least the end of the 2015\u201316 season."]}, {"page": "Artur Boruc", "response": ["Boruc endured a decline of form in the first half of season 2008\u201309 as he committed several goalkeeping errors, in particular against Rangers in a 2\u20134 defeat at Parkhead on 31 August 2008 where he was badly at fault for Rangers fourth goal, and against Hibernian at Easter Road on 7 December 2008, where John Rankin scored against him from 45 yards out, a goal Rankin later referred to as a \"squiggler.\" He did however save a James McArthur penalty in a 4\u20130 win over Hamilton Academical on 4 October 2008. Despite this run of relatively poor performances, Boruc was one of 55 players (including five goalkeepers) shortlisted on 20 October 2008 for the FIFPro World XI Player Awards.
