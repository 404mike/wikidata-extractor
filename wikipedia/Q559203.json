The judgment noted that Canadian regulations which (in most cases) prohibit the public display of tobacco products at retail locations \u2013 i.e., customers must ask for a brand by name \u2013 exacerbated the situation, as there were now two products that customers might be referring to when asking for \"Marlboro\".

He says that the cowboy in the clip is Marlboro Man, a figure used in advertising campaigns for Marlboro cigarettes, and notes that four of the actors portraying Marlboro Man have died from lung cancer or smoking-related illnesses. Oliver says that cigarette smoking is no longer as prevalent in the United States because of, among other things, mandatory warnings on all cigarette boxes and a ban on TV advertisements for cigarettes. The comedian says that tobacco executives adamantly refused to acknowledge the potential drawbacks to smoking, despite strong evidence to prove these drawbacks. He shows a video of Joseph Cullman, the former CEO of the tobacco company Philip Morris International (PMI), saying that \"some women would prefer having smaller babies\" in response to a reporter's comment that pregnant women who smoke will give birth to smaller babies as a result.For a reference for the quote, see:", "Toward the end of the segment, Oliver offers the mascot Jeff the Diseased Lung for Philip Morris International's use, free of charge.

The segment includes many mischaracterizations of our company, including our approach to marketing and regulation, which have been embellished in the spirit of comedic license [...] While we recognize the tobacco industry is an easy target for comedians, we take seriously the responsibility that comes with selling a product that is an adult choice and is harmful to health [...] We support and comply with thousands of regulations worldwide \u2013 including advertising restrictions, penalties for selling tobacco products to minors, and substantial health warnings on packaging. We're investing billions into developing and scientifically assessing a portfolio of products that have the potential to be less harmful and that are satisfying so smokers will switch to them. And, like any other company with a responsibility to its business partners, shareholders and employees, we ask only that laws protecting investments, including trademarks, be equally applied to us.", "The statement also provided readers with a \"balanced view\", and facts about the issues raised by Oliver, including the company's marketing practices and \"approach to regulation\".

Furthermore, Chris Morran takes aim at the company's claim that it \"[supports] and [complies] with thousands of regulations worldwide\", writing: [...] the tobacco industry doesn't support these regulations.
