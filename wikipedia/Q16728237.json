Cox went on to edit the more mainstream and solidly successful Wycliffe.\nMore recently she has also been involved in children's programmes including I Was a Rat , Bootleg and the multi-award-winning adaptation of Malorie Blackman's novel  Pig Heart Boy .", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Terry Johnson (dramatist)", "response": ["*99-1 (Zenith/Carlton) co-creator with Barbara Cox"]}, {"page": "British Academy Children's Awards", "response": ["* 2005: Barbara Cox (Wipe Out)"]}, {"page": "Barbara Cox", "response": ["Barbara Cox may refer to:", "*Barbara Cox (writer), British television writer and script editor", "*Barbara Cox (footballer) (born 1947), New Zealand international women's football (soccer) player", "*Barbara Cox Anthony (1922\u20132007), media owner, daughter of James M.
