It was not able to enforce them for long against European Communities member countries, as the UK had joined it too, including the EU's predecessor, the European Common Market. As a condition of its membership, the UK had to accede to the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), for which the basics had just largely been negotiated, and share those exclusive waters with other member states, including France and the Netherlands, as well as Norway, a non-member state that jointly manages its fishery with the EU, and the Faroe Islands, an autonomous Danish archipelago northwest of the UK. Sir Con O'Neill, who led the UK's negotiating team, said fishing was the most difficult issue to resolve as part of the UK's accession, calling it \"economic peanuts but political dynamite\". The government at different times feared that it would cost it its parliamentary majority in favour of accession, as had happened in Norway."]}, {"page": "List of female members of the House of Lords", "response": ["|Onora O'Neill, Baroness O'Neill of BengarveDaughter of Con O'Neill"]}]}}
