He played for Corby Town, Northampton Town, Cambridge United, Watford, Newcastle United and West Bromwich Albion. Reilly scored the winning goal for Watford against Plymouth Argyle in the 1984 FA Cup semi-final at Villa Park and played in the 1984 FA Cup Final itself.  In 2003, nearly 20 years later, Reilly was working as a bricklayer on a building site in Corby when he was attacked by another worker who bit part of his right ear off, before whispering \"Plymouth\" in his other ear by way of explanation.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Jack Charlton", "response": ["Charlton was appointed manager of Newcastle United in June 1984 after being persuaded to take the job by Jackie Milburn. Arthur Cox had left the club after leading the \"Magpies\" to the First Division and key player Kevin Keegan announced his retirement. His first action was to release Terry McDermott from his contract, who refused to agree to Charlton's offer of a new contract. He had little money to spend in preparation for the 1984\u201385 season, though he did have young talents in Chris Waddle and Peter Beardsley. He signed midfielder Gary Megson and big striker George Reilly. The \"Toon\" finished safely in 14th place, and a teenage Paul Gascoigne was on the verge of breaking into the first team."]}, {"page": "Paul Gascoigne", "response": ["Gascoigne captained Newcastle United's youth team to the FA Youth Cup in the 1984\u201385 season, and scored twice in the 4\u20131 victory over Watford in the final at Vicarage Road. In the first leg of the final, they drew 0\u20130. Teammate Joe Allon stated that Newcastle were unusually poor in the first leg, but in the second leg, Gascoigne was instrumental in Newcastle's victory. After the match, Jack Charlton told Gascoigne he would be in the first-team the next day against Norwich City. Gascoigne did travel to Norwich, though Charlton chose not to pick him. Gascoigne made his first-team debut as a substitute for George Reilly in a 1\u20130 win over Queens Park Rangers on 13 April 1985 at St James' Park. Charlton later noted that Gascoigne's first-team appearances under him were too brief to suggest he was more than a useful talent. At the age of 18 Gascoigne signed a two-year \u00a3120 a week contract at Newcastle, with the club also having a further two-year option clause. Through noting Gascoigne's generous personality, Charlton arranged that around half of Gascoigne's wage be paid into a bank account for him to collect in a lump sum at the end of his first contract."]}, {"page": "Northampton Town F.C.", "response": ["In 1970, they lost 8\u20132 to Manchester United in the FA Cup fifth round.
