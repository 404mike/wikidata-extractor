According Kathryn Gutzwiller, he \"reinvented Greek poetry for the Hellenistic age by devising a personal style that came, through its manifestations in Roman poetry, to influence the entire tradition of modern literature\". She also writes that his lasting importance is demonstrated by the strong reactions his poetry elicited from contemporaries and posterity. Richard L. Hunter, an expert on Greek literature of the Hellenistic period, states that the selective reception of Callimachus through Roman poets has led to a simplified picture of his poetry. Hunter writes that modern critics have drawn up a false dichotomy between the \"content-laden and socially engaged poetry of the archaic and classical periods\" and a sophisticated, but meaningless style proposed by Callimachus. Echoing Hunter's assessment in their 2012 book on the reception of Callimachus, the Hellenists Benjamin Acosta-Hughes and Susan Stephens comment that the scarcity of primary evidence and the reliance on Roman accounts has created a label of Callimacheanism that does not accurately represent his literary work."]}, {"page": "Dionysius of Halicarnassus", "response": ["* Jonge, Casper C. de, and Richard L.

The poem is regarded by classicist Kathryn Gutzwiller as his \"most influential and original\" work. Latinist Richard F. Thomas, in an article surveying its influence on Roman poetry, describes the Aetia as the \"most important poem of the most influential Alexandrian poet\". However, he adds that much of its perceived influence remained \"speculative\" due to the poem's poor state of preservation. Expressing a similar sentiment, Richard L. Hunter, a scholar of Hellenistic literature, states that Roman allusions to a small number of surviving passages from the Aetia have led to an undue prominence of those passages in modern criticism of Callimachus."]}]}}
