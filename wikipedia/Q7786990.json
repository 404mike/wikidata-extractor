He represented a series of Irish constituencies as a Member of Parliament (MP) in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.\nDickson was elected to Westminster at the general election in 1874 as MP for Dungannon in County Tyrone, and re-elected at the 1880 general election. His re-election was declared void on 10 June 1880 following a petition from the losing candidate, Colonel Knox. His son, James Dickson won the seat at the subsequent by-election with an increased majority.He was returned to Parliament the following year in a by-election for the County Tyrone constituency, and held that seat until the Tyrone constituency was divided at the 1885 general election.He returned to Westminster three years later, in May 1888, when he won a by-election for the Dublin St Stephen's Green constituency. He held that seat until the 1892 general election.He was a Trustee of Magee College, Derry from about 1880.His daughter, Emily Winifred Dickson was the first woman to be elected Fellow of a college of surgeons in either Ireland or Great Britain and she initially had her practice in his home in Dublin while he was based there.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Tyrone (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Thomas Alexander Dickson (Lib)"]}, {"page": "Dungannon (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Thomas Alexander Dickson", "| 1880 by-electionThomas Alexander Dickson had been re-elected at the general election in April 1880, but his election was declared void on 10 June 1880 "]}, {"page": "Dublin St Stephen's Green (UK Parliament constituency)", "response": ["| Thomas Alexander Dickson"]}, {"page": "Thomas Dickson", "response": ["*Thomas Alexander Dickson (1833\u20131909), Member of Parliament for Dungannon 1874\u20131880, Tyrone 1881\u20131885, and Dublin St Stephen's Green 1888\u20131892"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1880 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Thomas Alexander Dickson"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1885\u20131900)", "response": ["|Thomas Alexander Dickson"]}, {"page": "List of MPs elected in the 1874 United Kingdom general election", "response": ["| Thomas Alexander Dickson"]}, {"page": "List of United Kingdom by-elections (1868\u20131885)", "response": ["|Thomas Alexander Dickson", "|Thomas Alexander Dickson"]}, {"page": "James Dickson (Irish politician)", "response": ["Dickson was elected to the House of Commons at a by-election on 25 June 1880.

His father re-entered Parliament in his own right at the next election.Dickson is cited as the youngest since 1832 by a number of sources, but he was about three months older than William Charles Wentworth-FitzWilliam, elected at Malton in 1832 aged just under 21.

This seemed to come as something of a surprise to both sides as the Conservatives had been reported as confident and the Liberals rather despondent.The Times, 23 May 1885 p12 The defeat was taken as a bad omen for the Conservatives in view of the forthcoming general election. One commentator put forward the possible explanation that the Conservatives had not taken the election as seriously as they should, given that the general election would soon be upon them. There was a reduced turnout over the previous general election in 1880 and it was felt that the voters too were underwhelmed by the prospect of going to the polls twice in quick succession.The Times, 23 May 1885 p12 The Liberals believed that their candidates stand on Coercion was an important factor. Thomas Alexander Dickson Liberal MP for Tyrone said he had spoken at one of Sinclair's campaign meetings and had been enthusiastically received on this issue.Stephen Ball (ed.), Dublin Castle and the First Home Rule Crisis: The Political Journal of Sir George Fottrell, 1884\u20131887; Royal Historical Society, 2008 p97 The Times newspaper was sceptical on this as an explanation, which, it reported, could have been down to numerous factors; but it did point to the Coercion question as one which could prove fruitful for the Irish Party at the forthcoming general election and problematic for the Liberals.The Times, 23 May 1885 p11 This certainly seemed to prove true. The Liberals failed to win any seat in what is today Northern Ireland at the 1885 general election, while the Conservatives won sixteen and the Nationalists eight. One psephologist has noted that the fact that the Liberal Party was not in a majority in the House of Commons was caused by the activities of the Irish Nationalists. Charles Stewart Parnell had advised his supporters to vote Conservative if there were no Irish Nationalist candidates running and that it is almost certain the Nationalists caused the loss of at least five, or perhaps seven or more Liberal seats.Michael Kinnear, The British Voter: An Atlas and Survey since 1885; Cornell University Press, 1968 p13"]}, {"page": "1887 South Donegal by-election", "response": ["The Times reported on 21 January that the seat had been offered by the Irish party leader, Charles Stewart Parnell, to the former member for Tyrone, Thomas Alexander Dickson, but that he had refused unless he could run as an 'independent Gladstonian Liberal' and would not sign the pledge required of members of the Irish Parliamentary Party; instead, it was reported that Tim Healy, who had lost his South Londonderry seat at the last general election, was to be the candidate. On 24 January, however, it was announced that Mr Parnell had asked J. G. Swift MacNeill, Professor of Constitutional and Criminal Law at the King's Inns, Dublin, to be the candidate, saying that MacNeill's election, as a Protestant, by the Catholic electors of South Donegal would have a great effect of dispelling the fears and prejudices of Northern Protestants'.The Times, 24 January 1887"]}, {"page": "1888 Dublin St Stephen's Green by-election", "response": ["The Dublin St Stephen's Green by-election, 1888 was a parliamentary by-election held for the United Kingdom House of Commons constituency of Dublin St Stephen's Green on 12 May 1888.
