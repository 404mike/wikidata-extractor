Dunk's Chapel, later known as Little Dicker Chapel and now as Golden Cross Chapel, was completed and licensed in 1813.  The red-brick building was set back from the main road and was described from the start as a \"Calvinistic Independent\" chapel.  The cause was popular, and the building was soon too small to accommodate worshippers who regularly travelled from a long distance; so in 1837 the trustees of Dunk's Chapel paid \u00a320 for some land further along the main road next to the brickworks and spent \u00a3422 on a \"large and comfortable\" new building with a capacity of 400 worshippers.
