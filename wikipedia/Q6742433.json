After a review was conducted by former First Minister of Scotland Henry McLeish, the SFA board structure was streamlined considerably in 2011. Professional game and non-professional game boards govern their respective areas of football, while the main board has a strategic focus. There are eight members on the main board, consisting of three SFA office bearers, two representatives from the SPFL, one from the Scottish Amateur FA and two independent members. As of April 2019, these positions were occupied by Alan MacRae (SFA president), Rod Petrie (SFA vice-president), Ian Maxwell (SFA chief executive), Neil Doncaster (SPFL), Mike Mulraney (SPFL), Thomas McKeown (Amateur FA), Ana Stewart (independent) and Malcolm Kpedekpo (independent)."]}]}}
