With responsibility for addressing the crisis falling to him as governor, Prescott devised a scheme designed to distinguish genuine settlers from land speculators by basing the size of township grants on the expenses incurred by the applicant, which also served to reward those who had begun to develop lands in anticipation of receiving a land title. This satisfied the majority of applicants, but angered speculators, as it limited their ability to profit from merely holding title to lands in Canada. Prescott began to suspect a conspiracy dating back to at least 1794 amongst members of the Executive Council, including William Osgoode, Hugh Finlay (chairman of the land committee), and John Young, to exploit their official positions to acquire large tracts of land for themselves. The Executive Council condemned Prescott's attempted solution to the land issue, leading him to believe that his suspicions had been confirmed. A military figure who was unaccustomed to politicking and perceived insubordination, Prescott lashed out against councillors, openly accusing them of land speculation and jobbery. In April 1799, attempts at reconciliation failed, and the British government recalled Prescott to England, despatching Sir Robert Milnes, 1st Baronet as lieutenant governor to manage Lower Canada in his absence. Milnes promptly permitted the Executive Council the land grants they had pursued."]}]}}
