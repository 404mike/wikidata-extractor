In the same year she embarked on an affair with Alexander Stuart Frere (1892\u20131984), who later became chairman of the publisher Heinemann. He was 26 years her junior. He initially went to stay at the Chalet Soleil to catalogue her large library, and romance ensued. The affair lasted several years. In 1933, he married writer and theater critic Patricia Wallace.
