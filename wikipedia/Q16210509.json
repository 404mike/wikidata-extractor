In her first event, the 100m backstroke, she posted a time of 1:09.98, coming in second to Britain's Chloe Davies, but her time was good enough for her to qualify for the final. In the final later that evening she swam an improved time of 1:09.50 just 4 hundredths of a second behind second placed Taylor Corry, to give van der Kulk the bronze, her first Paralympic medal. Two days later in the 200m freestyle she won her heat with a time of 2:14.43. In the final van der Kulk swam slightly slower with a time of 2:14.80, but it was enough to push Australia's Kayla Clarke into fourth place to give van der Kulk her second Paralympic bronze. Her final event was the 100m breaststroke. By winning the first heat in the inaugural SB14 100m backstroke, van der Kulk, by default, set a new Paralympic record. This record was short-lived being taken from her moments later in the second heat by teammate Magda Toeters. In the final, van der Kulk came sixth."]}, {"page": "2014 IPC Swimming European Championships \u2013 Women's 200 metre freestyle", "response": ["| Chloe Davies|| 2:12.36"]}]}}
