In 1951, Hamilton staged an exhibition called Growth and Form at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London. A pioneering form of installation art, it featured scientific models, diagrams and photographs presented as a unified artwork.https://www.dundee.ac.uk/museum/collections/zoology/renew/hamilton/ In 1952, at the first Independent Group meeting, held at the ICA, Hamilton was introduced to Eduardo Paolozzi's seminal presentation of collages produced in the late 1940s and early 1950s that are now considered to be the first standard bearers of Pop Art. Also in 1952, he was introduced to the Green Box notes of Marcel Duchamp through Roland Penrose, whom Hamilton had met at the ICA. At the ICA, Hamilton was responsible for the design and installation of a number of exhibitions including one on James Joyce and The Wonder and the Horror of the Human Head that was curated by Penrose. It was also through Penrose that Hamilton met Victor Pasmore who gave him a teaching post in the Fine Art Department of Durham University at Newcastle Upon Tyne, which lasted until 1966. Among the students Hamilton tutored at Newcastle in this period were Rita Donagh, Mark Lancaster, Tim Head, Roxy Music founder Bryan Ferry and Ferry's visual collaborator Nicholas de Ville. Hamilton's influence can be found in the visual styling and approach of Roxy Music.  He described Ferry as \"his greatest creation\". Ferry repaid the compliment, naming him in 2010 as the living person he most admired, saying \"he greatly influenced my ways of seeing art and the world\"."]}, {"page": "1987 in art", "response": ["*John Moores Painting Prize - Tim Head for \"Cow mutations\""]}, {"page": "John Moores Painting Prize", "response": ["* 1987 Tim Head - \"Cow mutations\""]}, {"page": "List of Newcastle University people", "response": ["* Tim Head - artist"]}, {"page": "Construction in Process", "response": ["* Tim Head"]}, {"page": "Keith Milow", "response": ["During the 1970s, Milow was considered part of the British artistic avant-garde along with artists such as Richard Long, Gilbert & George, Michael Craig-Martin, Mark Lancaster, Tim Head, Nicholas Pope, John Walker, David Tremlett, Barry Flanagan, Art & Language and Derek Jarman.
