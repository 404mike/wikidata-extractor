This possibility was first raised in a Times Literary Supplement letter by E. St John Brooks in 1937; in a letter to Notes and Queries, John Baker has added that only Marlowe could have been Arbella's tutor owing to the absence of any other known \"Morley\" from the period with an MA and not otherwise occupied.John Baker, letter to Notes and Queries 44.3 (1997), pp. 367\u20138 If Marlowe was Arbella's tutor, it might indicate that he was there as a spy, since Arbella, niece of Mary, Queen of Scots, and cousin of James VI of Scotland, later James I of England, was at the time a strong candidate for the succession to Elizabeth's throne.Elizabeth I and James VI and I, History in Focus. Frederick S. Boas dismisses the possibility of this identification, based on surviving legal records which document Marlowe's \"residence in London between September and December 1589\". Marlowe had been party to a fatal quarrel involving his neighbours and the poet Thomas Watson in Norton Folgate and was held in Newgate Prison for a fortnight.Frederick S. Boas, Christopher Marlowe: A biographical and critical study (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1953), pp. 101ff. In fact, the quarrel and his arrest occurred on 18 September, he was released on bail on 1 October and he had to attend court, where he was acquitted on 3 December, but there is no record of where he was for the intervening two months."]}, {"page": "William Shakespeare", "response": ["In the late 19th century, Edward Dowden classified four of the late comedies as romances, and though many scholars prefer to call them tragicomedies, Dowden's term is often used. In 1896, Frederick S. Boas coined the term \"problem plays\" to describe four plays: All's Well That Ends Well, Measure for Measure, Troilus and Cressida, and Hamlet. \"Dramas as singular in theme and temper cannot be strictly called comedies or tragedies\", he wrote. \"We may, therefore, borrow a convenient phrase from the theatre of today and class them together as Shakespeare's problem plays.\" The term, much debated and sometimes applied to other plays, remains in use, though Hamlet is definitively classed as a tragedy."]}, {"page": "A Midsummer Night's Dream", "response": ["Towards the end of the 19th century, Georg Brandes (1895\u20136) and Frederick S. Boas (1896) were the last major additions to A Midsummer Night's Dream criticism. Brandes' approach anticipates later psychological readings, seeing Oberon's magic as symbolic and \"typifying the sorcery of the erotic imagination\". Brandes felt that in the play, Shakespeare looks inward at the \"domain of the unconscious\". Boas eschews the play as ethical treatise or psychological study and instead takes a more historicist and literal approach. To Boas the play is, despite its fantastical and exotic trappings, \"essentially English and Elizabethan\". He sees Theseus as a Tudor noble; Helena a mere plot device to \"concentrate the four lovers on a single spot\"; and the Pyramus and Thisbe play-within-the-play a parody of a prominent topos of contemporary plays. Summing up their contributions, Kehler writes: \"This is recognizably modern criticism.\""]}, {"page": "All's Well That Ends Well", "response": ["In 1896 Frederick S. Boas coined the term \"problem play\" to include the unpopular work, grouping it with Hamlet, Troilus and Cressida and Measure for Measure."]}, {"page": "The Taming of the Shrew", "response": ["In 1964, Richard Hosley suggested the main source for the play may have been the anonymous ballad \"A merry jeste of a shrewde and curst Wyfe, lapped in Morrelles Skin, for her good behauyour\". The ballad tells the story of a marriage in which the husband must tame his headstrong wife. Like Shrew, the story features a family with two sisters, the younger of whom is seen as mild and desirable. However, in \"Merry Jest\", the older sister is obdurate not because it is simply her nature, but because she has been raised by her shrewish mother to seek mastery over men. Ultimately, the couple return to the family house, where the now tamed woman lectures her sister on the merits of being an obedient wife. The taming in this version is much more physical than in Shakespeare; the shrew is beaten with birch rods until she bleeds, and is then wrapped in the salted flesh of a plough horse (the Morrelle of the title). \"Merry Jest\" was not unknown to earlier editors of the play, and had been dismissed as a source by A.R. Frey, W.C. Hazlitt, R. Warwick Bond and Frederick S. Boas. Modern editors also express doubt as to Hosley's argument."]}, {"page": "Edward II (play)", "response": ["Marlowe found most of his material for this play in the third volume of Raphael Holinshed's Chronicles (1587). Frederick S. Boas believes that \"out of all the rich material provided by Holinshed\" Marlowe was drawn to \"the comparatively unattractive reign of Edward II\" due to the relationship between the King and Gaveston. Boas elaborates, \"Homosexual affection ... has (as has been seen) a special attraction for Marlowe. Jove and Ganymede in Dido, Henry III and his 'minions' in The Massacre, Neptune and Leander in Hero and Leander, and all akin, although drawn to a slighter scale, to Edward and Gaveston.\"Frederick S. Boas, Christopher Marlowe: A biographical and critical study (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1953), pp. 174f Boas also notes the existence of a number of parallels between Edward II and The Massacre at Paris, asserting that \"it is scarcely too much to say that scenes xi\u2013xxi of The Massacre are something in the nature of a preliminary sketch for Edward II.\" Marlowe stayed close to the account but embellished it with the character of Lightborn (or Lucifer) as Edward's assassin."]}, {"page": "Boas", "response": ["*Frederick S.

However, subsequent critics have not concurred in this assessment, most notably the investigations of Knutowski, R.B. McKerrow, and Tucker Brooke found very little that they felt could be credited to Nashe. While Frederick S. Boas admitted a few details had parallels in Nashe's published works and some words or meanings are found in Nashe's works but not otherwise used by Marlowe, \"the scenes in which these passages and phrases appear have, as a whole, the stamp of Marlowe.\"Boas, Christopher Marlowe: A biographical and critical study (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1940), p.51 Some critics have virtually ignored the participation of Nashe \u2014 yet the presence of a collaborator may help to explain the play's divergences from Marlowe's standard dramaturgy. No other play by Marlowe has such a strong female lead character, and in no other \"is heteroerotic passion the centripetal force of the drama's momentum.\"Sara Munson Deats, in Cheney, p. 194. However, more recent studies conducted independently by Darren Freebury-Jones and Marcus Dahl, and Ruth Lunney and Hugh Craig, have failed to uncover evidence for Nashe's participation."]}, {"page": "Frederick Samuel Boas", "response": ["#redirect Frederick S.

Scribner's Sons. pp. 369\u2013370 The term problem play was drawn from the socially conscious drama of playwrights contemporaneous with Boas, like Ibsen and Shaw, and describes a play centred on a social or political problem in such a way as to promote debate but not easy resolution."]}, {"page": "Marlowe portrait", "response": ["Bury consulted with Bruce Dickins, chair of Anglo-Saxon, G K Adams of the National Portrait Gallery, John Bakeless, an American biographer of Marlowe, Frederick S.
