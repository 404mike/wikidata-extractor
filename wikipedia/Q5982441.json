He later admitted that after returning to match fitness from the injury he was only ever able to play at \"half pace\". His long-term replacement was young defender Alan Dodd. The club also faced a major decline following a gale which severely damaged the Victoria Ground's Butler Street stand, and a lack of adequate insurance cover left a significant repair bill meaning the club had to sell Alan Hudson, Jimmy Greenhoff, Mike Pejic, Sean Haslegrave and Ian Moores to fund the repair; Eric Skeels and John Ritchie also retired. Waddington filled in the gaps left by these players with youngsters, and it also meant that Smith could continue to be a regular for the club despite his reduced mobility. Waddington was dismissed in March 1976, and new manager George Eastham failed to prevent Stoke from being relegated at the end of 1976\u201377. Following relegation Smith formed another good partnership, this time with Mike Doyle, which helped Stoke gain promotion in 1978\u201379 under new manager Alan Durban. Smith claimed his two seasons in the Second Division were \"boring\", as even with his reduced mobility few attackers in the division posed too much of a threat for him."]}, {"page": "Terry McDermott", "response": ["From 1985 to 1987, McDermott played for the Cypriot team APOEL alongside Ian Moores, where he won the Cypriot Championship and the Cypriot Super Cup."]}, {"page": "1977\u201378 in English football", "response": ["22 October 1977: Tottenham Hotspur's challenge for an immediate return to the First Division is boosted by a 9-0 home win over Bristol Rovers, in which debutant striker Colin Lee scores four goals and his partner Ian Moores scores a hat-trick."]}, {"page": "Jimmy Greenhoff", "response": ["He scored twenty goals in 46 appearances in 1972\u201373, making him the club's top-scorer.

Manager John Rudge made a \u00a340,000 offer for Bristol City's left-sided midfielder Alan Walsh, which was rejected. He also made inquiries for Nigel Gleghorn and Marc North. Ray Walker put in a transfer request, which was rejected. Rudge's first purchase of the season was Sunderland's left-sided midfielder Paul Atkinson, with a tribunal setting the fee at \u00a320,000; Rudge stated that he \"has the ability to produce the sort of crosses that win games\". His next target was a striker, though he had a \u00a370,000 bid for Hull City's Andy Saville rejected. Attempts to capture Imre Varadi, Wayne Biggins, Keith Bertschin, Andy Jones, and John Pearson all failed. Ian Moores began training with the club, but was not offered a contract. Despite interest from at least three other clubs (particularly Mansfield Town), Rudge signed Ron Futcher, Bradford City's top-scorer, for a \u00a335,000 fee. The veteran striker said \"I could have done better for myself elsewhere, but Vale have a lot more potential.\" Another new arrival was young Brighton & Hove Albion goalkeeper Trevor Wood on a free transfer. The Vale were unbeaten in their seven pre-season friendlies, beating second tier rivals Stoke City 1\u20130 in the process. They also recorded wins over Newcastle Town (6\u20131), Brandon (2\u20131), Spennymoor (3\u20130), and Kidderminster Harriers (4\u20130), and drew 2\u20132 with Walsall and 1\u20131 with Crewe Alexandra.
