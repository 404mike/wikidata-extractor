He was often described as an English Utrillo.Hawthorne was born Elwin Hawthorn in Poplar, London, in 1905. one of six sons and a daughter, whose father was a painter and decorator. He left school aged 14, without obtaining any qualifications.  With no job, he took art courses at Bethnal Green Men's Institute and the Bow & Bromley Evening Institute.  He adopted the spelling \"Hawthorne\" from 1928, having been catalogued as such at an East London Art Club exhibition held at Whitechapel Art Gallery. He subsequently worked, for three years, as assistant to Walter Sickert.He exhibited regularly at Lefevre Galleries, who paid him a retainer and had first refusal on his works, and hosted two solo exhibitions. He painted a number of buildings in London, including St John-at-Hampstead, and the since-demolished St Andrew's church in Vanbrugh Park. Further afield, his subjects include North Foreland Lighthouse. One of his painting was shown in the British pavilion at the 1936 Venice Biennale.He served in the army during World War II, which conflict saw the end of his exhibiting. After discharge, he became a wages clerk for Plessey and taught art part-time.Hawthorne died in the King George Hospital at Ilford, Essex, on 15 October 1954 and was survived by his wife, Lilian (ne Leahy; they married in 1937 and she died in 1996), who was also an East London Group artist, and their two children. By the time of his death, aged 49, he had become so disenchanted with the art world that he had used one of his paintings, on board, as a shelf in a coal bunker. It was later recovered by his wife. HIs estate at probate was worth \u00a31442 8s.The author David Buckman has described him as:\n a prominent talent in the [East London] Group and an integral part of the lost history of one of the major artistic movements to come out of the East End in the last century.\nA number of Hawthorne's works are in public collections in the United Kingdom, including Manchester Art Gallery, the Laing Art Gallery, Ulster Museum, St. Anne's College (University of Oxford), Russell-Cotes Art Gallery & Museum, Aberdeen Art Gallery & Museums, Herbert Art Gallery & Museum, Camden Local Studies and Archives Centre, and the Harris Museum & Art Gallery.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Walter Sickert", "response": ["* Elwin Hawthorne \u2013 artist, worked for a period as Sickert's assistant"]}, {"page": "North Foreland", "response": ["A painting of the lighthouse by Elwin Hawthorne is in the Russell-Cotes Art Gallery & Museum."]}, {"page": "1954 in art", "response": ["* October 15 \u2013 Elwin Hawthorne, English painter (b. 1905)"]}, {"page": "1905 in art", "response": ["** Elwin Hawthorne, English painter (d. 1954)"]}, {"page": "Elwin Hawthorn", "response": ["#REDIRECTElwin Hawthorne"]}, {"page": "East London Group", "response": ["John Cooper, who taught at Bethnal Green, eventually severed his connection with it after a disagreement. From the 1924-25 session he began teaching at the Bow and Bromley Evening Institute in Coborn Road, E3. To this he eventually attracted key members of the Bethnal Green Art Club, such as Walter Steggles, Harold Steggles and Elwin Hawthorne, whom he asked to join him at Bow in 1927.", "The drabness of the East End, painted with a muted palette, is reflected in the early works. In the work of Elwin Hawthorne, the absence of people contributes to an almost surreal atmosphere. As the artists began to travel out of the city, the tone of the paintings lightens. ", "In April 1927, the Daily Chronicle reported on the Bethnal Green Institute exhibition with headlines such as \u2018Workmen as artists\u2019 and \u2018Window cleaner\u2019s work in East End show\u2019. Albert Turpin was the window cleaner who went on to become mayor of Bethnal Green, and made it his mission to record in paintings all the houses and streets around his home before the developers destroyed them. Other exhibitors included Henry Silk (basket maker), Elwin Hawthorne (errand boy) and C Warren (park-keeper) and B R Swinnerton (piano factory worker).", "The show was an enormous commercial success, too, with interest shown by Mayfair art dealers and high society (including Ramsay MacDonald, Lady Cunard, Viscount D\u2019Abernon, and Edward Marsh, a perceptive collector). The noted critic, T W Earp, particularly praised the work of some artists and so the careers were launched of, for example, William Coldstream, Murroe FitzGerald, Archibald Hattemore, Elwin Hawthorne, Cecil Osborne, Henry Silk, Harold Steggles, Walter Steggles and Albert Turpin. By this time Cooper was an established painter, especially of music and musicians, which feature in some of the group shows.", "In 1936, works by Elwin Hawthorne and Walter Steggles were included in Britain's contribution to the 1936 Venice Biennale, alongside well known and established artists.", "Members of the East London Group also painted stage sets and made a film documenting their activities. Phyllis Bray painted three large murals at the New People's Palace (now part of Queen Mary, University of London). John Cooper, Elwin Hawthorne, Brynhild Parker, Harold Steggles and Walter Steggles contributed to the popular range of Shell advertising posters. John Cooper played a major part in developing mosaic work through his courses at the Central School of Arts and Crafts.", "* Elwin Hawthorne ", "* Maurice Utrillo. Paul George Konody of the Daily Mail wrote of the 1930 Lefevre exhibition: \u2018If an Utrillo of London is to come into being \u2013 a painter who would interpret London not only as we see it but as we feel it \u2013 he will come from among the members of the East London Group and his name will either be Elwin Hawthorne or Walter Steggles.\u2019Daily Mail, December 17th 1930"]}]}}
