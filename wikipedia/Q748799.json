He bequeathed the court, its estate, and its major contents to his nephew Henry van Moyland of Los Angeles, while the title passed to the 5th Baron's younger brother Geoffrey. This led to a legal dispute between family members, at the conclusion of which the Raglan collection of military memorabilia, and many of the contents of the house, were sold at auction. In 2015, the house itself was sold. The court is a private residence, but is available for hire as a wedding venue."]}, {"page": "FitzRoy Somerset", "response": ["*FitzRoy Somerset, 5th Baron Raglan (1927\u20132010), British peer"]}]}}
