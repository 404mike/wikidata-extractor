He supposes that Hartlib may have received Milton's Of Education with mixed feelings, \"there being in it both strictures and recommendations from which he was bound to dissent.\" Adamson thinks that Hartlib on the other hand, \"must have extended a whole-hearted welcome\" to The Advice of W.P. to Mr Samuel Hartlib, for the Advancement of some particular Parts of Learning. Petty was in full sympathy of the \"New Philosophy\", of which Francis Bacon can be regarded as the founder, and of which Hartlib was an enthusiastic promoter., chapter 1 is entitled: 'The New Philosophy'."]}, {"page": "School of Education, Communication and Society", "response": ["The Department for the Training of Teachers of King's College was established under John William Adamson in October 1890.
