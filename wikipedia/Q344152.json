He played for England for five years, winning 28 caps and scoring one goal. He played every minute of England's victorious 1966 FIFA World Cup campaign. In the semi-final of that tournament against Portugal, he was given the job of marking the prolific Eus\u00e9bio. His tough performance resulted in Eus\u00e9bio being practically nullified for the entire game. Stiles also played in the final, which England won 4\u20132 against West Germany. His post-match dance on the Wembley pitch, holding the World Cup trophy in one hand and his false teeth in the other, was widely broadcast.\nStiles spent the majority of his club career for Manchester United, spending eleven years at Old Trafford, where he became renowned for his tough tackling and ball-winning qualities. Jonathan Wilson, writing for The Guardian in 2013, labelled Stiles as a type of holding midfielder he described as a \"destroyer\", a player who is primarily tasked with running, winning back possession, and distributing the ball to other players.With the Red Devils, he won two League titles and one European Cup. Stiles is one of only three Englishmen, alongside Bobby Charlton and Ian Callaghan, to have won both the World Cup and European Cup.Stiles also had short spells with Middlesbrough and Preston North End.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Bobby Charlton", "response": ["Charlton became the manager of Preston North End in 1973, signing his former United and England teammate Nobby Stiles as player-coach. His first season ended in relegation, and although he began playing again, he left Preston early in the 1975\u201376 season after a disagreement with the board over the transfer of John Bird to Newcastle United. He was appointed a CBE that year and began a casual association with BBC for punditry on matches, which continued for many years. In early 1976, he scored once in three league appearances for Waterford United. He also made a handful of appearances for Australian clubs Newcastle KB United, Perth Azzurri and Blacktown City."]}, {"page": "Geoff Hurst", "response": ["In November 2020, Hurst offered to donate his brain after his death for research into dementia.

They then beat Mexico 2\u20130 after a \"tremendous goal\" from Bobby Charlton opened up the game shortly before the half-time whistle. England beat France 2\u20130 in the final group game, with Charlton assisting Roger Hunt after heading the ball onto the post. England eliminated Argentina in the quarter finals with a 1\u20130 win \u2013 their efforts were greatly aided after Argentine centre-half Antonio Ratt\u00edn was sent off for dissent, after which Argentina stopped attacking the ball and concentrated of holding out for a draw with their aggressive defending. England's opponents in the semi-finals were Portugal, who had giant centre-forward Jos\u00e9 Torres to compete with Charlton for aerial balls. Late in the game Charlton gave away a penalty by sticking out a hand to stop Torres from scoring; Eus\u00e9bio scored the penalty but was largely contained by Nobby Stiles, and England won the game 2\u20131 after two goals from Bobby Charlton."]}, {"page": "Middlesbrough F.C.", "response": ["* Nobby Stiles", "* Nobby Stiles (2007 inductee)"]}, {"page": "Alf Ramsey", "response": ["Ramsey dropped Alan Ball and John Connelly and brought in Terry Paine and Martin Peters, whose advanced style of play as a midfielder matched the qualities Ramsey looked for in his system. England beat Mexico 2\u20130. Ramsey replaced Terry Paine with Ian Callaghan for their final group match, against France. England won 2\u20130, securing qualification to the knockout rounds. Two difficult situations arose from the final group match. After making a vicious tackle and being cautioned, midfielder Nobby Stiles came under fire from senior FIFA officials, who called for Ramsey to drop him from the side. Ramsey strongly disagreed, and told the FA to inform FIFA that either Stiles would remain in his team or Ramsey himself would resign. Another bad tackle was committed during that match, resulting in Tottenham striker (and one of England's most prolific goal-scorers) Greaves being injured and sidelined for the next few matches. Despite having more experienced strikers in his squad, Ramsey selected young Geoff Hurst as Greaves's replacement, seeing potential in the young West Ham forward. The France match also marked Ramsey's final game with a winger. After it, he dropped Ian Callaghan from his side and brought back Alan Ball to strengthen the midfield.", "For the knockout stages, England's first opponents were Argentina. Ramsey decided to switch from 4\u20133\u20133 to 4\u20133\u20131\u20132. With Ball and Peters operating on the flanks, the midfield now boasted Nobby Stiles and Bobby Charlton in the centre, indeed Ramsey refused a demand from the FA that he drop Stiles, making it a resignation issue. After a violent quarter-final (where the Argentinian captain Antonio Ratt\u00edn refused to leave the field after being sent off), England won 1\u20130 thanks to Hurst latching onto a cross from Martin Peters and heading home a goal. Ramsey came under fire when he stopped his players from the traditional swapping of shirts with the Argentinians in protest at their play and was then reported to have described Argentinian players as \"animals\"; \"It seemed a pity so much Argentinian talent is wasted. Our best football will come against the right type of opposition\u2014a team who come to play football, and not act as animals.\" Jimmy Greaves in his 2009 autobiography, Greavsie, claims that Ramsey had said \"I've been a little disappointed that the behaviour of some players in this competition reminded me of animals\". The belief that he had referred directly to the Argentinians as animals damaged Ramsey's reputation and made successive England teams unpopular abroad, particularly in South America. In the semi-final, England faced a fluent and skilful Portuguese side containing the tournament's top goal-scorer Eus\u00e9bio. However, England won a 2\u20131 victory in a memorable match which saw them concede their first goal of the competition from the penalty spot.", "Ramsey remained his usual self during the celebrations: not joining in, but rather opting to let his players soak up their achievement.  He is the only England manager ever to have won the World Cup. Bobby Charlton praised Ramsey and his approach to managing the England team to World Cup victory: \"He was professional to his fingertips and as popular with the players as any manager I've ever seen. He was a winner and without Alf Ramsey England would not have won the World Cup in 1966. He gave us our proudest moment.\" Nobby Stiles agreed: \"You did it, Alf, we'd have been nothing without you.\"", "Ramsey earned the respect of his players. He strongly supported Nobby Stiles when the FA leaned on Ramsey to drop Stiles from the 1966 World Cup quarter-final following a tackle on Frenchman Jacques Simon in the previous game.  After the final, at the banquet, with the players in one room and their wives forced to sit in an adjoining room, he excused his players early from the banquet to allow the players to join their wives after nearly four weeks apart. In his manner with the players, he was \"usually equable\", but when his 1978 Birmingham City team produced a poor defensive display, \"he blew his top\"; the next game was a \"historic victory\"."]}]}}
