However he put in a transfer request as he and his wife missed their families in Nottingham. Manager Ken Brown allowed him to live in Nottingham and train at the City Ground with Brian Clough's Nottingham Forest team whilst he looked for a new club and whilst Plymouth looked for a new goalkeeper. The club finally found their replacement in signing Rhys Wilmot from Arsenal, which allowed Cherry to join Chesterfield in the Third Division for a three-month loan period from January. He made his debut for Paul Hart's \"Spireites\" on 2 January, and recalled making one of his best ever saves in the 3\u20131 win at Sheffield United.
