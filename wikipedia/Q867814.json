Carlisle represented his home county of Lancashire at youth level. The start of his professional career was his Football League debut for Blackpool in September 1997. He moved to Queens Park Rangers in May 2000. In the same year, Carlisle won three caps for the England under-21 national team. He missed a number of matches for Queens Park Rangers due to a posterior cruciate ligament injury which at one stage led doctors to believe that his career was over. He then missed one month of the 2003\u201304 season because of an alcohol-related problem, and left Queens Park Rangers at the end of that season. In the summer of 2004, he joined Leeds United on a free transfer.\nCarlisle spent just one season with Leeds United before signing for Championship club Watford in August 2005. In the 2005\u201306 season, his first with Watford, the team finished third in the division and achieved promotion to the Premier League via the play-offs. However, a thigh injury caused Carlisle to miss the majority of the team's season in the top flight. In March 2007 he had a one-month loan spell at Luton Town. In August 2007, Burnley manager Steve Cotterill bought Carlisle from Watford for a transfer fee of \u00a3200,000. In the 2008\u201309 season he played over 40 matches as Burnley reached the semi-finals of the League Cup and finished fifth in the league, earning a place in the play-offs. Carlisle was named man of the match for his performance in the play-off final as Burnley beat Sheffield United 1\u20130 to return to the top tier of English football for the first time in 33 years.\nAn imposing figure in the centre of defence thanks to his stature, Carlisle also provided an attacking threat from set pieces.\nHe is a practising Christian and regularly attends church. He attended Balshaw's Church of England High School where he attained 10 A-grades at GCSE and studied mathematics and politics at A-level, and in 2002 was awarded the title of \"Britain's Brainiest Footballer\" in a TV game show. He has been an ambassador for the Kick It Out campaign and is a former Chairman of the Management Committee of the Professional Footballers' Association. Carlisle has suffered from recurring problems with alcohol and depression.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Preston, Lancashire", "response": ["* Clarke Carlisle, footballer and TV personality, born and brought up in Preston"]}, {"page": "Countdown (game show)", "response": ["Contestants who have or had become notable for other reasons include Nuts magazine editor-at-large Pete Cashmore, rugby player Ayoola Erinle, footballers Neil MacKenzie, Clarke Carlisle and Matt Le Tissier, musicians Jon Marsh and Nick Saloman, comedian Alex Horne, noted Irish playwright Peter Sheridan and Professional Darts Referee Kirk Bevins, who won Series 60 and was a quarter-finalist in the 30th Birthday Championship."]}, {"page": "Rio Ferdinand", "response": ["In the wake of a court case involving John Terry and Rio's brother Anton, in which Terry was found not guilty of racial abuse, Rio Ferdinand sparked media controversy by expressing amusement at the comments of a Twitter user who referred to Ashley Cole, who had testified in Terry's favour, as a \"choc ice\", a slang term which is commonly understood to mean \"black on the outside, white on the inside\".

On 1 July 2011, he pleaded guilty at Preston Crown Court to three counts of handling stolen cars.
