In 1935, she married Sidney Joseph Proops, with whom she had a son, Robert.In 1939, Proops became a journalist. Her first job was as fashion correspondent for the Daily Mirror. Following the death of the problem page editor, Proops was given the job of reading and answering her correspondence, and soon became the agony aunt herself, a post she held until her own death. As well as being an adviser, she used her column to campaign for numerous causes. One that she advocated for was the establishment of special \"suites\" for the treatment and interviewing of rape victims, to minimize the stigma of reporting such crimes.Her radio appearances included a guest spot on the BBC Radio 4 comedy programme Just a Minute. Her book Pride, Prejudice and Proops (Time Remembered) was published in 1975, followed by Dear Marje a year later. \nIn 1971 Gilbert O'Sullivan mentioned her in his second single Underneath The Blanket Go.She was appointed OBE in 1969, awarded Woman of the Year in 1984, had a waxwork in  Madame Tussauds in 1977 and in 1971 appeared on This is Your Life.
