Hill had a majority of over 5,000 at the 1959 general election, but the Luton seat was won by the Labour candidate Will Howie with a majority of 3,749.[1]\nFletcher-Cooke entered the House of Commons the following year at the 1964 general election, as Member of Parliament for Southampton Test.  However, he lost his seat two years later, at the 1966 general election, to Labour's Bob Mitchell, and never re-entered Parliament.\nHis younger brother Charles Fletcher-Cooke, was Conservative MP for Darwen from 1951 to 1983.

John opposed sanctions, but his brother supported them.[2]", "link_mentions": {}}}
