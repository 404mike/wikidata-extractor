He scored over 500 tries during his rugby league career, making him the third highest try scorer (and top try-scoring English player) of all time, and now features in a statue of great rugby league players outside Wembley Stadium.He was a Great Britain and England national representative winger, and due to his running speed he was nicknamed \"Chariots\" Offiah after the film Chariots of Fire while playing amateur rugby union at Rosslyn Park. Offiah played for English rugby league clubs Widnes, Wigan, London Broncos and Salford City Reds, and in Australia for Sydney's Eastern Suburbs and St. George clubs.It is believed that the England rugby anthem Swing Low, Sweet Chariot was first sung at Twickenham while Offiah was playing in the Middlesex Sevens in 1987.Since retiring Offiah has appeared on several reality TV shows.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "December 29", "response": ["*  1966   \u2013 Martin Offiah, English rugby league player and sportscaster"]}, {"page": "1985\u20131988 Rugby League World Cup", "response": ["*  Martin Offiah"]}, {"page": "1989\u20131992 Rugby League World Cup", "response": ["|LW ||5|| Martin Offiah", "Both coaches picked experienced teams, with only Australian's Tim Brasher (fullback) and Steve Renouf (centre) making their international debut in the game.

In England's first set with the ball Australia were penalised for their skipper Brad Fittler's high tackle on Andrew Farrell. From the resulting good field position England were able to force a line drop-out and get another set of six in Australia's half of the field. At the end of the set, Radlinski put up a high kick, which Australia's fullback Tim Brasher failed to secure and Australia were penalised for regathering the ball when off-side. Bobbie Goulding kicked the penalty goal from fifteen metres out, giving his side a 2 \u2013 0 lead. From Australia's resulting kick-off, the English players couldn't secure the ball and it was regathered by the Kangaroos deep in the opposition half. On the last tackle of the ensuing set, Johns at first receiver put a chip kick into the left-hand corner of England's in-goal area where winger Rod Wishart dived in and got a hand on it, giving Australia the first try of the match in the seventh minute. Johns then converted the try from the touch-line and the Kangaroos were leading 2 \u2013 6. A few minutes later England were penalised around the centre of the field and Johns attempted the kick at goal but missed. With the game now swinging from end to end, Johns conceded a penalty close to the goal posts and Goulding's kick bounced off the uprights but went in, so England were trailing 4 \u2013 6 by the eighteenth minute. A few minutes later England conceded a penalty in front of their goal posts and Johns kicked Australia to a 4 \u2013 8 lead. Shortly after that England winger Martin Offiah made a break down along the left sideline and was contentiously ruled to have been taken over the sideline by a desperate Tim Brasher tackle as he threw the ball back into the field for Paul Newlove to toe ahead and dive on, though television replays suggested that Offiah had managed to release the ball before he went into touch. After a high shot from Andy Farrell on Mark Carroll, Johns kicked another penalty giving Australia a 4 \u2013 10 lead at the thirty-minute mark.

The Rugby Football League did not object to the move, in spite of his drug-damaged reputation, but stated much improvement was needed prior to any appearance for Castleford in the Super League competition. At a rugby press conference, Chambers expressed a desire to compete in the Beijing Olympics, casting doubt on his dedication to his new career. Chambers officially registered as a player with the Rugby Football League, and Martin Offiah declared that he was prepared to mentor Chambers.

In the post season Meninga travelled with the Raiders to England and captained the team in their 30\u201318 loss to a Martin Offiah inspired Widnes in the 1989 World Club Challenge at Old Trafford. Meninga successfully returned to top level representative football in 1989, playing for Queensland in their State of Origin series whitewash of NSW (though he did suffer an eye socket injury in the second game in Sydney which kept him out of the third), before being selected to the mid-season tour of New Zealand. After playing in the centres for the first two test wins over the Kiwis, Meninga was moved to the second-row for the third test in Auckland with great effect as he scored a try and kicked one goal to add to his 5 goals in the first test and 2 in the second.", "During 1994, Meninga played his final test on Australian soil when he led the Kangaroos to a record 58\u20130 win over France in a one-off test at Sydney's Parramatta Stadium in front of an almost packed house of 27,318. He scored a try and kicked 5 goals in his final test for Australia in Australia. Unfortunately for Meninga, in his last State of Origin series for Queensland as both captain and as a player, New South Wales, led by Raiders teammate Laurie Daley, won the series 2\u20131. The State of Origin series is the only trophy Mal Meninga would not win as a team captain. Meninga captained the Raiders to the Grand final for a record fifth time in 1994. At the end of the 1994 season, Meninga was selected for his record fourth Kangaroo Tour and his record second as captain when he went on the 1994 Kangaroo tour. Meninga became the only player selected to four Kangaroo tours and the only player to twice be named tour captain. Australia again lost the first test against Great Britain at Wembley Stadium, but changes made to the team by coach Bob Fulton saw the Kangaroos bounce back with a vengeance in the second test at Old Trafford with a 38\u20138 win. With the scores locked at 4\u20134 after two penalty goals each, Meninga intercepted a Bobbie Goulding pass only 20 metres from his own line and raced 70 metres downfield, with flying Lions winger Martin Offiah bearing down on him. Just as Offiah tackled him, Meninga gave a perfectly timed pass to winger Andrew Ettingshausen who scored the first of Australia's seven tries that day. After a poor first test, the second saw a welcome return to form for Meninga. The Kangaroos then scored a hard-fought 23\u20134 win in the third test at Elland Road to once again retain The Ashes and keep alive their streak of not having lost a test series in England since the 1959\u201360 Kangaroo tour. On 4 December 1994, at the Stade de la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e in B\u00e9ziers, France, Mal Meninga captained Australia to a record 74\u20130 victory over a very weak French team, scoring the final try of the game, and of his career. In a test career of 46 games for Australia, Mal Meninga scored a total of 278 points (21 tries, 99 goals). Australia won 40 and only lost 6 of the tests Meninga played and did not lose a test series during his time in the green and gold. He played in the centres on 40 occasions for Australia, with one game on the wing, two in the second-row, and three from the bench. On his four Kangaroo Tours as a player, Meninga holds the distinction in playing in every test for Australia on tour, playing all six tests in both 1982 and 1986, all five in 1990, and all four in 1994. Former teammate and coach of the London Broncos, Gary Grienke was hopeful of bringing Meninga to his club for a swansong season, but this did not eventuate."]}, {"page": "Superstars (British TV programme)", "response": ["In 2002, the BBC held a one-off, but truncated, UK Championship as a major feature of its biannual Sport Relief charity telethon.
