His solo works have not survived and he is primarily known through quotations from other sixteenth-century biologists. It is believed that he broke with Aristotle on classification of caterpillars. He was also a Puritan and as such kept a low profile during the reign of Queen Mary I of England. He is perhaps best known for being partly responsible for the Insectorum, sive, Minimorum animalium theatrum or Theatre of Insects. This work was written jointly by Conrad Gessner (posthumously), Edward Edward Wotton, Thomas Muffet, and Thomas Penny.Penny suffered from asthma and dosed himself with woodlice crushed in wine.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Abraham Ortelius", "response": ["In England Ortelius's contacts included William Camden, Richard Hakluyt, Thomas Penny, Puritan controversialist William Charke, and Humphrey Llwyd, who would contribute the map of England and Wales to Ortelius's 1573 edition of the Theatrum."]}, {"page": "Conrad Gessner", "response": ["A number of other works appeared after his death (posthumously), some long after (see Posthumous works).

Both sons-in-law, le Myre and Rumler were pharmacists, with good reputations in London society. He eventually moved permanently to England in 1596. Among the English botanists, his closest friend was Thomas Penny, whom he had first met in Montpellier, and to whom he pays tribute in his dedication of the Stirpium adversaria (1571). l'Obel died in Highgate in 1616 at the age of 78, and was buried in the churchyard of St Denis."]}, {"page": "Timeline of entomology \u2013 prior to 1800", "response": ["*Insectorum sive Minimorum Animalium Theatrum by Thomas Muffet with Edward Wotton, Conrad Gesner and Thomas Penny posthumously published \u2013 Contains first image of butterfly from North America, a woodblock print from a painting by John White in 1587."]}, {"page": "Thomas Muffet", "response": ["Thomas Muffet first studied silkworms while working in Italy, beginning his continued fascination with arthropods in general, particularly spiders. He is best known for editing and expanding the work Insectorum sive Minimorum Animalium Theatrum (Theatre of Insects), an illustrated guide to the classification and lives of insects. Although he is popularly believed to have authored it, he merely inherited and furthered its progress toward publication, which would not occur until thirty years after his death. The book contained significant contributions by three other scientists, the Swiss Conrad Gesner alongside Edward Wotton and Thomas Penny. It appears that it was ready for the press in 1589 or 1590. The original title page (unused) is dated 1589. Muffet's negotiations with printers in The Hague failed in 1590. After his death his papers were sold to Theodore de Mayerne, one of the physicians who attended James I and Charles I. Mayerne edited the work for publication in 1634, adding an introduction. Muffet's original manuscript (along with Mayerne's own papers) was acquired by Hans Sloane and is now among the Sloane manuscripts in the British Library.Victor Houliston, \"Moffet [Moufet, Muffet], Thomas [T.

Trevor-Roper, \"Mayerne, Sir Theodore Turquet de (1573\u20131655)\" in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 The prime reason the book was published posthumously was that the English market for books on natural science was weak at the time.
