Her still life paintings with flowers - even though she also painted still life without flowers, as well as landscapes, seascapes and some portraits - are her most characteristic works. Armour learned from her contemporaries such as Anne Redpath and her close friend David Donaldson, and Still Life with Pomegranate is a fine example of her paintings of the late 1940s. During Armour's teaching at the Glasgow School of Art in the 1950s, she claimed to had learnt much from her students and their response to contemporary painting. As a result, her brushwork became freer and her colour brightened and became more vibrant. Armour and her husband often painted the sea at Blackwaterfoot on the Isle of Arran, and it was for these seascapes that she later told a friend that she would like to be remembered."]}, {"page": "List of painters by name beginning with \"D\"", "response": ["*David Donaldson (1916\u20131996), Scottish royal painter and illuminator"]}, {"page": "Glasgow Art Club", "response": ["* David Donaldson RSA RGI RP LLD DLit Painter and Limner to Her Majesty The Queen in Scotland"]}, {"page": "Alexander Goudie", "response": ["He studied at the Glasgow School of Art under William Armour, David Donaldson and Benno Schotz and where he was awarded the Somerville Shanks Prize for Composition.Obituary for Alexander Goudie - The Daily Telegraph 27 April 2004"]}, {"page": "David Donaldson", "response": ["* David Donaldson (artist) (1916\u20131996), Scottish artist, Painter and Limner to Her Majesty the Queen", "* David Donaldson (composer) (born 1960), New Zealand composer and performer"]}, {"page": "John Greig Dunbar", "response": ["He was portrayed in his ceremonial robes by David Donaldson in 1963.
