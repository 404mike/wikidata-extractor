Playing at inside forward, McNeill started his career at Aberdeen, making his first team debut in January 1951. McNeill moved to England in 1956, and went on to play for Leicester City, Brighton & Hove Albion and Southend United. He returned to Scotland to join Ross County, then a Highland League club, initially as a player before taking over as manager the following season. He led the club to their first ever Highland League Championship in 1967.\nHe then became manager of Wigan Athletic, then a Northern Premier League club, in 1968. McNeill then managed Salisbury in the Southern League, before returning for a second spell at Ross County in 1971. In 1976 he rejoined Wigan Athletic, and led the club into the Football League in 1978. In 1981 he became assistant manager to John Neal at Chelsea. When Neal was sidelined with ill-health during the 1984\u201385 season, McNeill also took temporary charge of first team affairs.\nHe returned to management in 1987, this time with Shrewsbury Town and remained until 1990. After this he became assistant manager to Bruce Rioch at Millwall, and later worked as a scout for Bolton Wanderers, Leeds United, Norwich City, Wigan Athletic and Chelsea. He retired from the sport in 2006 and returned to Scotland.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Wigan Athletic F.C.", "response": ["In the club's first season of league football, Wigan Athletic finished in sixth place, just six points off promotion and playing in front of an average crowd of 6,701. Two more top-half finishes came in the following seasons, though a relatively weak 1980\u201381 season saw the dismissal of long-serving manager Ian McNeill shortly before the end of the season. They gained their first Football League promotion under the management of former Liverpool player Larry Lloyd in 1981\u201382, when a points tally of 91 saw them join the former Division Three for the first time, beginning a 10-year spell in English football's third tier. The club struggled in their first season in Division Three, which led to Lloyd's sacking in early 1983, at which point Bobby Charlton, a director at the time, took over as temporary manager before being replaced by Harry McNally. Under McNally's management, the club stabilised in Division Three and secured a pair of mid-table finishes, but a dreadful 1984\u201385 season cost him his job, with Tranmere manager Bryan Hamilton stepping into the breach. Under Hamilton's management, the club's performances went to the next level and they won their first silverware as a league club that season with the Freight Rover Trophy. They were beaten in the Northern final of the same competition the following season by Bolton Wanderers. More importantly, Hamilton achieved Division Three survival, which had looked an impossible task earlier that season.", "|  Ian McNeill", "| Ian McNeill"]}, {"page": "Shrewsbury Town F.C.", "response": ["* Ian McNeill (1987\u20131990)"]}, {"page": "Larry Lloyd", "response": ["Lloyd left Forest for Wigan Athletic in March 1981, where he was player-manager taking over from Ian McNeill.
