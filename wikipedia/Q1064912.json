In 1880, Charles Howard Hinton popularized these insights in an essay titled \"What is the Fourth Dimension?\", which explained the concept of a \"four-dimensional cube\" with a step-by-step generalization of the properties of lines, squares, and cubes. The simplest form of Hinton's method is to draw two ordinary 3D cubes in 2D space, one encompassing the other, separated by an \"unseen\" distance, and then draw lines between their equivalent vertices. This can be seen in the accompanying animation whenever it shows a smaller inner cube inside a larger outer cube. The eight lines connecting the vertices of the two cubes in this case represent a single direction in the \"unseen\" fourth dimension.", "One of the first major expositors of the fourth dimension was Charles Howard Hinton, starting in 1880 with his essay What is the Fourth Dimension?; published in the Dublin University magazine.

To describe the two additional cardinal directions, Charles Howard Hinton coined the terms ana and kata, from the Greek words meaning \"up toward\" and \"down from\", respectively . ", "As a three-dimensional object passes through a two-dimensional plane, two-dimensional beings in this plane would only observe a cross-section of the three-dimensional object within this plane. For example, if a spherical balloon passed through a sheet of paper, beings in the paper would see first a single point, then a circle gradually growing larger, until it reaches the diameter of the balloon, and then getting smaller again, until it shrank to a point and then disappeared. It is important to remember that the 2D beings would not see a circle in the same way as we do, rather only a 1 dimensional projection of the circle on their 1D \"retina\". Similarly, if a four-dimensional object passed through a three dimensional (hyper) surface, one could observe a three-dimensional cross-section of the four-dimensional object\u2014for example, a 3-sphere would appear first as a point, then as a growing sphere, with the sphere then shrinking to a single point and then disappearing.

This is the problem of how to communicate the meaning of left and right, where the two communicants are conditionally not allowed to view any one object in common. The problem was first implied in Immanuel Kant's discussion of a hand isolated in space, which would have no meaning as left or right by itself; Gardner posits that Kant would today explain his problem using the reversibility of objects through a higher dimension. A three-dimensional hand can be reversed in a mirror or a hypothetical fourth dimension. In more easily visualizable terms, an outline of a hand in Flatland could be flipped over; the meaning of left or right would not apply until a being missing a corresponding hand came along. William James expressed the essential problem in his chapter on \"The Perception of Space\" in The Principles of Psychology (1890), and it is also mentioned by Charles Howard Hinton.
