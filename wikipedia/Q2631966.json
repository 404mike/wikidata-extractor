Nothing is known of the person, and his name is known only from Welsh genealogies, which confirm that he had at least two sons. He succeeded his father Rhun ap Maelgwn as king, and was in turn succeeded by his son Iago. Beli was either the father or grandfather of Saint Edeyrn.\nThe royal genealogies of the Harleian genealogies, Jesus College MS. 20, and Hengwrt MS. 202 show him as the ancestor and descendant of kings, and thus presumably a king himself. The Bonedd y Saint (English: Descent of the Saints) says that he is the ancestor of Saint Edeyrn (the Bonedd y Saint says that he was the son of Nudd or Lludd who was the son of Beli, while Hengwrt MS. 202 says that he was the son of Beli).\nOne of the medieval Welsh Triads mentions a certain 'Rhun ap Beli', implying that there was yet another son of Beli, who was famed for his military exploits. The name is repeated elsewhere in medieval poetry, such as in Hywel Foel's (fl. c. 1240 \u2013 1300) awdl lamenting the capture and imprisonment of Owain ap Gruffudd, where he likens Owain to Rhun: \"Who if free, like Rhun the son of Beli, Would not let Lloegria burn his borders\". There is no confirming evidence that such a person existed, and it is contradicted by records such as the royal genealogies. Scholars such as Thomas Stephens have concluded that this is a mistake, and that the intended person was someone else.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "List of rulers of Wales", "response": ["* Beli ap Rhun (c.\u00a0580\u2013c.\u00a0599)"]}, {"page": "Rhun", "response": ["* Beli ap Rhun (517\u2013599), King of Gwynedd"]}, {"page": "Kingdom of Gwynedd", "response": ["Maelgwn eventually died from the plague in 547, leaving a succession crisis in his wake. His son-in-law, Elidyr Mwynfawr of the Kingdom of Strathclyde, claimed the throne and invaded Gwynedd to displace Maelgwn's son, Rhun Hir ap Maelgwn. Elidyr was killed in the attempt, but his death was then avenged by his relatives, who ravaged the coast of Arfon. Rhun counter-attacked and exacted the same penalty on the lands of his foes in what is now central Scotland. The long distances these armies travelled suggests they were moving across the Irish Sea, but, because almost all of what is now northern England was at this point (c. 550) under Brittonic rule, it is possible that his army marched to Strathclyde overland. Rhun returned to Gwynedd, and the rest of his reign was far less eventful.

He came to the throne on the death of his father, King Maelgwn Gwynedd. There are no historical records of his reign in this early age.
