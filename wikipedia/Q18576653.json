However, this work was interrupted by the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, when the collections had to be moved to storage. Baumgartel herself relocated to Somerville College, Oxford, where she was hosted by Dame Lucy Sutherland and joined a large community of refugee scholars. She modified her plans and, supported by a grant from the Griffith Institute, began working on a comprehensive overview of predynastic Egypt, published in 1947 as The Cultures of Prehistoric Egypt (I). When the Petrie collection became available again after the war, she added a second volume and revised the first. In this landmark monograph, Baumgartel maintained her conviction that the prehistory of Egypt must be understood in the context of the regional archaeology, not through the \"backwards-projection\" of later texts. In particular, she challenged her teacher Kurt Sethe's thesis that Egyptian civilization originated in the Nile Delta, instead stressing, based on archaeological evidence, the primacy of Upper Egypt."]}, {"page": "Dame Lucy Sutherland", "response": ["#redirect Lucy Sutherland"]}, {"page": "Somerville College Boat Club", "response": ["Other notable members of the SCBC were Lucy Sutherland and Dominica Legge."]}, {"page": "List of Somerville College, Oxford, people", "response": ["*Lucy Sutherland, first woman undergraduate to speak at the Oxford Union and first female Pro-vice-chancellor of Oxford", "*Dame Lucy Sutherland DBE FBA FRSA (1903\u20131980), Australian-born historian and head of Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford", "*Dame Lucy Sutherland DBE FBA FRSA (1903\u20131980), Australian-born historian and head of Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford"]}]}}
