The poem may be linked to the alliance of Norse and Celtic kingdoms which challenged \u00c6thelstan at the Battle of Brunanburh in 937.

This usage is followed in the Welsh Triads. Bendigeituran becomes \"Bendigeidfr\u00e2n\" or \"Br\u00e2n Fendigeid\" in Modern Welsh; Bendigeidfran is the form used in many Modern Welsh adaptations of the Mabinogion.For instance, Dafydd & Rhiannon Ifans' Y Mabinogi.

Ifor Williams thought Bendigeit was a late addition, perhaps a replacement for a word that had become obsolete by the time the Mabinogi was recorded. \"Vran\" appears in an old poem in the Book of Taliesin,Book of Taliesin XIV, \"Kerd Veib am Llyr\".

Ifor Williams, whose 1938 text laid the foundations for modern scholarly study of the poetry, considered that part of it could be regarded as being of likely late 6th-century origin. This would have been orally transmitted for a period before being written down.Williams (1938), pp. xc\u2013xciii. Dillon cast doubt on the date of composition, arguing that it is unlikely that by the end of the 6th century Primitive Welsh would have developed into a language \"not notably earlier than that of the ninth century\". He suggests that the poetry may have been composed in the 9th century on traditional themes and attributed to Aneirin.Dillon (1973), pp. 267\u20138. Jackson however considers that there is \"no real substance\" in these arguments, and points out that the poetry would have been transmitted orally for a long period before being written down, and would have been modernised by reciters, and that there is in any case nothing in the language used which would rule out a date around 600.Jackson (1969), pp. 88\u201391. Koch suggests a rather earlier date, about 570, and also suggests that the poem may have existed in written form by the 7th century, much earlier than usually thought.

The context of the poem has to be worked out from the text itself. There have been various interpretations of the events recorded in the poem. The 19th-century Welsh scholar Thomas Stephens identified Y Gododdin with the Votadini and Catraeth as Catterick in North Yorkshire.Stephens (1876),p. 3. He linked the poem to the Battle of Degsastan in c. 603 between King \u00c6thelfrith of Bernicia and the Gaels under \u00c1ed\u00e1n mac Gabr\u00e1in, king of D\u00e1l Riada. Gwenogvryn Evans in his 1922 edition and translation of the Book of Aneirin claimed that the poem referred to a battle around the Menai Strait in 1098, emending the text to fit the theory.Williams (1972), pp. 58\u20139. The generally accepted interpretation for the Battle of Catraeth is that put forward by Ifor Williams in his Canu Aneirin first published in 1938. Williams interpreted mynydawc mwynvawr in the text to refer to a person, Mynyddog Mwynfawr in modern Welsh. Mynyddog, in his version, was the king of the Gododdin, with his chief seat at Din Eidyn (modern Edinburgh). Around the year 600 Mynyddog gathered about 300 selected warriors, some from as far afield as Gwynedd. He feasted them at Din Eidyn for a year, then launched an attack on Catraeth, which Williams agrees with Stephens in identifying as Catterick, which was in Anglo-Saxon hands.
