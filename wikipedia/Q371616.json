Mark may be known best for \"Days of Elijah\", \"Revival\", \"All for Jesus\", \"The Wonder of The Cross\", and \"Not by Might\" amongst the many songs he has written and which are sung throughout the world. He has released thirteen albums in total, with sales of over two million worldwide, and has won the GMA's international award.\nThough known within the United Kingdom and throughout Canada and Europe from the early 1990s, it was not until his 1999 live album Revival in Belfast that Mark became known well in the United States, Australia, and the rest of the world. His signature song, \"Days of Elijah\", has proven popular since 1996.\nMark's album Revival in Belfast, released in 1999, remained high in both the Christian retail charts and Billboard charts for many years. It was still at No. 39 on the Billboard Top Christian Albums chart in 2004. When the follow up album, Come Heal This Land, was released in 2001, it went straight to No. 1 in the Christian Retail Charts in the United States. Robin became the first artist from the UK to accomplish this feat.Robin Mark is also the worship leader in his home church, Christian Fellowship Church (CFC) in East Belfast.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "Elijah", "response": ["* In 1996, Robin Mark created a praise song entitled Days of Elijah."]}, {"page": "List of Christian worship music artists", "response": ["* Robin Mark"]}, {"page": "Belfast, Prince Edward Island", "response": ["Of particular note is the local parish church, St. John's.
