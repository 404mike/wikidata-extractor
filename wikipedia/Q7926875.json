In the United Kingdom, Australia, and other British colonies, Zonophone was the cheaper label for Gramophone Company issues. Issue under the cheaper label appears to have been an arbitrary choice. For example, from the same session in 1905 the matrices of singer Victoria Monks were either issued on full priced Gramophone Company recordings or the much cheaper Zonophone label\u2014with no technical differences (or indeed popularity of song). In 1911 single-sided Zonophones were withdrawn\u2014existing titles were doubled under the Zonophone Twin label. This made the price difference between the still single-sided Gramophone Company issues and the Zonophones even greater. Ten-inch Zonophone Twins sold as 2s.6d. (\u00a30.125) while single-sided Gramo. issues (black label) sold at 4s.6d. (\u00a30.225). In 1913 the Gramophone Company issued an even cheaper label (Cinch) which sold at 1s.1d. (\u00a30.06) while keeping many of the titles for sale under the Zonophone label at 2s.6d."]}, {"page": "St Mary's Catholic Cemetery, Kensal Green", "response": ["*Victoria Monks (1884\u20131927), music hall singer"]}, {"page": "Silchester", "response": ["* Victoria Monks - music hall singer"]}, {"page": "List of British music hall performers", "response": ["* Victoria Monks (1884\u20131927)"]}, {"page": "Peelennium", "response": ["| Victoria Monks with Orchestra B"]}, {"page": "Monks (surname)", "response": ["*Victoria Monks (1884\u20131927), British music hall singer"]}, {"page": "Monks, Victoria", "response": ["#redirectVictoria Monks"]}]}}
