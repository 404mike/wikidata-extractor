Olha Lyakhova was the pace setter, taking the field through the first two laps (measured at the start line, not the quarter-mile splits) in 64.26 and 63.94 (2:08.20). As is typical for Hassan, she was last off the start line, but over the next 150 metres, slowly eased herself around the field on the outside into the marking position behind Lyakhova. Gabriela DeBues-Stafford soon moved through the field in between Hassan and Lyakhova for the next lap before Hassan and Gudaf Tsegay separated from the field as the only chasers. Between 800 and 1000 metres, Lyakhova strained to keep on pace, but Hassan and Tsegay were moving forward. After Lyakhova stepped out, the two found themselves 15 metres ahead of the pack. At 1200 metres, Hassan was looking back at her close chaser Tsegay in 3:10.13 (a 61.93 lap). Hassan accelerated, opening a 5-metre gap over the next 100 metres. Continuing at this pace, she passed 1500 metres in about 3:55. Hassan covered the last 409.344 metres in 62.20, her final time of 4:12:33 breaking Svetlana Masterkova's almost 23-year-old world record. The athletes trailing Hassan rewrote the all-time top 25 list, with Laura Weightman moving into position #15, DeBues-Stafford into #17, and after #5 all-time Tsegay faded into the pack she was followed by Rababe Arafi, Axumawit Embaye, Winnie Nanyondo and Ciara Mageean moving into positions #20\u201323."]}, {"page": "England at the 2014 Commonwealth Games", "response": ["| Laura Weightman", "|align=left|Laura Weightman"]}, {"page": "2014 Commonwealth rankings in athletics", "response": ["| align=left| Laura Weightman"]}, {"page": "2014 European Athletics Championships \u2013 Women's 1500 metres", "response": ["|bgcolor=\"CC9966\"|Bronze|| Laura Weightman  ", "|  || 2 || align=left|Laura Weightman || align=left| || 4:10.55 || Q", "|  || align=left|Laura Weightman || align=left| || 4:06.32 ||"]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 2014 European Athletics Championships", "response": ["|  || Laura Weightman || Women's 1500 m || 15 August", "|align=left|Laura Weightman"]}, {"page": "Great Britain at the 2016 Summer Olympics", "response": ["|align=left|Laura Weightman"]}, {"page": "Athletics at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's 1500 metres", "response": ["Many of these women were in the World Championship race and the world record run before it.  They had a year to think about and prepare their way to beat Dibaba.  The final started off in a walk for these athletes, the first lap in 1:16.57.  Dibaba went almost to the back of the pack, with the last chaser in her previous major races, Sifan Hassan watching her back and only Laura Muir trailing.  Shannon Rowbury was relegated to the unwanted leader duties until Laura Weightman moved forward near the end of the lap.  After the slow first lap, even Muir tired of jogging at the back and moved forward, but not Dibaba and Hassan.  By the steeplechase pit, 550 metres into the race, Dibaba ran a few quicker steps and moved to the outside, foretelling her move.  Over the next 150 metres, Dibaba floated forward with ease, Hassan following.  Over the next 100 metres, Dibaba cruised to the front, with each of the key figures in the race recognizing she had passed and scrambling to follow.  With a lap and a half to go, Muir was tight on Dibaba's shoulder, followed by Faith Kipyegon, Besu Sado, Jennifer Simpson, Hassan and Rowbury.  Dawit Seyaum came up from behind to join the mix of leaders but all were fighting not to let Dibaba get away.  At the bell, Kipyegon had gotten around Muir and was right on Dibaba's back, a gap had separated between Muir and the next chaser, Hassan.  The third lap was run in 56.80.  Both Dibaba and Kipyegon appeared to be in full sprint, but Kipyegon stuck to Dibaba like glue down the backstretch.  Then with just over 200 to go, Kipyegon accelerated around Dibaba.  Dibaba had no answer.  Kipyegon continued to extend her lead on to the finish line.  Behind them was the battle for bronze.  With 150 to go, Hassan caught Muir but Simpson was right on her back and Rowbury was gaining from behind.  Coming off the turn, Simpson went into her sprint, which left Hassan behind.  Rowbury also ran past Hassan and followed Simpson to the line.  Dibaba tied up badly going in to the finish, with Simpson rapidly gaining, but the finish line arrived for Dibaba faster than a sprinting Simpson could get there.", "| 7 || align=left|Laura Weightman || align=left| || 4:08.37 || ", "| 5 || align=left|Laura Weightman || align=left| || 4:05.28 || ", "|11 || align=left|Laura Weightman || align=left| || 4:14.95 || "]}, {"page": "Athletics at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Qualification", "response": ["| || Laura MuirLaura Weightman"]}, {"page": "The Duchess's Community High School", "response": ["*Laura Weightman, middle-distance runner"]}, {"page": "2010 World Junior Championships in Athletics \u2013 Women's 1500 metres", "response": ["| 6 || align=left | Laura Weightman || align=left |  || 4:14.31 || ", "| 3 || align=left | Laura Weightman || align=left |  || 4:17.11 || Q"]}, {"page": "2015 World Championships in Athletics \u2013 Women's 1500 metres", "response": ["| 14 || 3 || align=left| Laura Weightman ||align=left|  || 4:06.13 || ", "|  || 1 ||align=left| Laura Weightman ||align=left|  ||  || "]}, {"page": "Great Britain and Northern Ireland at the 2015 World Championships in Athletics", "response": ["|style=text-align:left| Laura Weightman"]}, {"page": "Jess Martin", "response": ["Martin was unable to compete in the summer of 2013 after suffering a stress-fracture in her foot but returned to competition towards the end of the year.
