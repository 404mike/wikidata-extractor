But later pressings of the single (on a black Parlophone label), and the version used for the Please Please Me album, are the 11 September re-record with Andy White on drums and Starr on tambourine. This difference has become fundamental in telling the two recordings of \"Love Me Do\" apart. Regarding the editing sessions that then followed all these various takes, Ron Richards remembers the whole thing being a bit fraught, saying: \"Quite honestly, by the time it came out I was pretty sick of it. I didn't think it would do anything.\"", "There are major discrepancies regarding the White session, and who produced it. In his book Summer of Love, Martin concedes that his version of events differs from some accounts, saying: \"On the 6 June Beatles session (audition) I decided that Pete Best had to go [and said to Epstein] I don't care what you do with Pete Best; but he's not playing on any more recording sessions: I'm getting a session drummer in.\" When Starr turned up with the group for their first proper recording session on 4 September, Martin says that he was totally unaware that the Beatles had fired Best; and, not knowing \"how good, bad or indifferent\" Starr was, was not prepared to \"waste precious studio time finding out.\" Martin, therefore, appears to have this as the Andy White session in which Martin was present, and not 11 September. This contradicts Mark Lewisohn's account, as in his book The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions, he has Starr on drums on 4 September and White for the 11 September re-make. Lewisohn also says that Richards was in charge on 11 September, which means, if accurate, that Richards was sole producer of the White version of \"Love Me Do\". Martin says, \"My diary shows that I did not oversee any Beatles recording sessions on 11 September\u2014only the one on 4 September.\" But, if Lewisohn's account is correct and \"the 4 September session really hadn't proved good enough to satisfy George Martin\", it might seem odd that Martin was not then present to oversee the 11 September remake.", "Andy White confirms that he was booked by Ron Richards for the 11 September session, not by George Martin, who he says \"could not make the session, could not get there till the end, so he had Ron Richards handle it\".

The point is not addressed in the Mark Lewisohn-researched Anthology notes, although author Lewisohn's 1988 The Beatles Recording Sessions quotes session engineer Ron Richards as saying, \"Ringo didn't play drums at all that evening.\" However, recording technician Geoff Emerick later wrote that, following White's departure, he witnessed Beatles roadie Mal Evans set up Starr's kit and the group record \"Please Please Me\" with Starr on drums. The unexpected rediscovery of the 11 September up-tempo recording raises the questions of when the Orbison-inspired slow version was played for Martin and whether a tape of that version might also still exist in the Abbey Road vaults, inasmuch as Lewisohn's 1988 quote from Martin \"We didn't keep outtakes then [1962]\" was later contradicted.
