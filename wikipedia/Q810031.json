Although he favoured cross country running, he was also a skilled marathon runner and, despite running shoe technology being in its infancy, he was able to adapt easily to the change of conditions underfoot.\nHeatley was a three-time winner of the English National Cross Country title (1960, 1961, 1963). He competed in the International Cross Country Championships seven times between 1957 and 1964, winning the world title in 1961. In the early 1960s, he set a British record and a world record for the 10-mile run, then on 13 June 1964 he broke the record for the world's fastest marathon. Four months later, he won a silver medal for Great Britain at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics when he finished second in the Olympic marathon (defending champion Abebe Bikila broke Heatley's world record on winning his second gold medal). The 1964 Olympics marked the end of Heatley's international career.", "link_mentions": [{"page": "December 25", "response": ["*1933 \u2013 Basil Heatley, English runner (d. 2019)"]}, {"page": "Coventry", "response": ["*Basil Heatley; former world record holder for the Marathon and Silver medalist in the 1964 Summer Olympics."]}, {"page": "Kenilworth", "response": ["*Basil Heatley (born 1933 in Kenilworth) was a marathon runner and Olympic silver medallist.Sporting Heroes."]}, {"page": "Marathon world record progression", "response": ["| 2:13:55 || Basil Heatley ||  || June 13, 1964 || Polytechnic Marathon || IAAF || Point-to-point course.
