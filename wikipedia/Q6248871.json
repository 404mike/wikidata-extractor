The second part of the claim, however, is in error. It could be simply deleted as an error, but it repeats and elaborates William Haller's second thesis as if a fact, that the later Foxe-derived abridgements had lost entirely intellect's levening influence. (The \"Elect Nation\" was Haller's first thesis). Haller read through some of the Foxe-derived martyrologies, editions by Martin Madan, John Milner and John Wesley, and observed \"a progressive corruption and vulgarization of the original for the propagation of an increasingly narrow Protestant piety\".)", "Acts and Monuments was cannibalized for material to warn of the dangers of Catholicism and, in Foxe's name, also to undermine resurgent High Church Anglicanism.

Maitland's and others' critiques helped to awaken increasing antagonism toward intolerance in the public conscience.
