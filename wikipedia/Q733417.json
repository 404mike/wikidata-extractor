Having read the first act\u2014all that was completed by then\u2014Olivier asked to be cast in the part. He had for years maintained that he might easily have been a third-rate comedian called \"Larry Oliver\", and would sometimes play the character at parties. Behind Archie's brazen fa\u00e7ade there is a deep desolation, and Olivier caught both aspects, switching, in the words of the biographer Anthony Holden, \"from a gleefully tacky comic routine to moments of the most wrenching pathos\". Tony Richardson's production for the English Stage Company transferred from the Royal Court to the Palace Theatre in September 1957; after that it toured and returned to the Palace. The role of Archie's daughter Jean was taken by three actresses during the various runs. The second of them was Joan Plowright, with whom Olivier began a relationship that endured for the rest of his life. Olivier said that playing Archie \"made me feel like a modern actor again\". In finding an avant-garde play that suited him, he was, as Osborne remarked, far ahead of Gielgud and Ralph Richardson, who did not successfully follow his lead for more than a decade. Their first substantial successes in works by any of Osborne's generation were Alan Bennett's Forty Years On (Gielgud in 1968) and David Storey's Home (Richardson and Gielgud in 1970)."]}, {"page": "2017", "response": ["* March 27 \u2013 David Storey, English writer (b. 1933)"]}, {"page": "List of winners and shortlisted authors of the Booker Prize", "response": ["|David Storey || Pasmore || Longman", "| rowspan=\"6\"| 1976|| style=\"background:gold;white-space:nowrap\" | David Storey || style=\"background:gold;white-space:nowrap\" | Saville || style=\"background:gold;white-space:nowrap\" | Jonathan Cape", "*David Storey"]}, {"page": "Richard Harris", "response": ["Harris's first starring role was in the film This Sporting Life (1963), as a bitter young coal miner, Frank Machin, who becomes an acclaimed rugby league football player.

When  plays began to supersede traditional West End productions in the later 1950s he found no new suitable stage roles, and for several years he was best known in the theatre for his one-man Shakespeare show Ages of Man.
